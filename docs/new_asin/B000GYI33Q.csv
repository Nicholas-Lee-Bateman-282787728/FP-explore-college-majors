2620977,5,B000GYI33Q,"Wow! If the other reveiws are true, then I will buying this upon release. I thought about not buying this disk if it meant just season 1 (3), was being realeased, but to find out that season 2 (4), which is probably one of the best seasons of any show period, is being encluded is great!

Now we just have to wait for the ""Legion of Doom"" (season 3,5) season to be released.",1155513600,7,374,4.123287671232877
2620978,5,B000GYI33Q,"After the cataclysmic events of the ""Star Crossed"" season two finale of Justice League, the show was re-formatted and re-launched as Justice League Unlimited: and now featured an enormous cast of DC heroes uniting to take on an ever growing list of villains which threaten the world.  In addition to Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, and the distrusted Hawkgirl; characters like Aquaman, Green Arrow, Supergirl, Captain Atom, Dr. Fate, Captain Marvel, Red Tornado, Black Canary, Wildcat, Huntress, the Atom, the Question, Hawk & Dove, Mr. Miracle, Big Barda, Booster Gold, Zatanna, Vixen, and Vigilante join the fold in one capacity or another.  While it gets off to a shaky start, JLU really takes off in the second half of the first season as Cadmus forges ahead with their own agenda (led by Amanda Waller, voiced by the always excellent CCH Pounder) and Lex Luthor (still voiced by the great Clancy Brown) eyes the presidency, and the destruction of the JLU.  The rest of the voice casting is superb as well, including mainstays like Kevin Conroy (still the best Batman voice ever) and Phil LaMar as Green Lantern, but the guest voices are just as great, including Wonder Years brothers Fred Savage and Jason Hervey in reverse roles as brothers Hawk & Dove, Dennis Farina as aging tough guy Wildcat, and Tom Everett Scott as the underappreciated Booster Gold.  The villains that the JLU takes on are a nice assorted bunch as well, including Mongul, Doomsday, Solomon Grundy, and a delicious ode to the classic Suicide Squad lineup with Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and others.  Of the 26 episodes here, many have their own great moments (Superman and Captain Marvel going toe to toe in ""Clash"", Batman, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman jumping across time in ""The Once and Future Thing"", which features Jonah Hex, a grown up Static Shock, and future Batman Terry McGinnis), but the season closing episodes in which the original seven members take on Luthor and Brainiac is truly great animated television.  However, the season closer ""Epilogue"" gives the late Batman Beyond show the closure that it always deserved, as an older Terry McGinnis learns the truth behind his own origin, and a choice Bruce Wayne had to make years before that set in motion his destiny to become the Batman of the future.  There's so much more here worth mentioning, but seeing it for yourself is better.  Undoubtadly the best DC animation since Batman: The Animated Series, Justice League Unlimited is superb, and here's hoping that there's more spectacular super powered action to come.",1155513600,22,2612,5.030092592592593
2620979,5,B000GYI33Q,"If you've seen Justice League seasons 1 and 2, then you HAVE to pick up this great multiseason set.  Looks like we're getting Justice League Unlimited seasons 1 and 2.  13 episodes a piece, totaling 26 episodes on 4 dvds.  I won't give too much away in case someone hasn't seen this terrific series yet.  But really, what are the chances of that happening?

  Superman decides to expand the League due to increasing threats from supervillains and alien invaders.  But the greater the number of heros there are, the bigger the threat.  For a secret government organization known only as Cadmus waits in the shadows.  And everyone's favorite badboy Lex Luthor is suddenly interested in running for President of the United States.  It all comes to a head in an explosive four parter at the end of JLU season 2 which promises to deliver a truckload of action.

  I was afraid the guys at Warner home video would only give us the first season of Jlu like they did with Batman Beyond, but thankfully, that doesn't seem to be the case this time.  I thought I was gonna have to wait until some time in 2007 for the second season and for the completion of the Cadmus story arc, but not so!  Now I just hope that they'll deliver the final season of Jlu by Christmas.  I know it'd be a tall order, but it would sure make a great stocking stuffer!  Jlu season 3 just in time for the holidays, anyone?  I hope so!",1154908800,,1400,4.419607843137255
2620980,5,B000GYI33Q,"When the Cartoon Network picked up Seasons Three and Four of ""Justice League"" after Season Two finished, they did so with the conditions that 1) instead of two-part stories, they wanted half-hour, self-contained stories; and 2) they wanted a fresher version of the show that clearly differentiated Season Three [and up] from Seasons One and Two. The producers obliged. The result was the re-titled ""Justice League Unlimited.""

The series creators' mandate, according to producer/story editor Dwayne McDuffie, was simply to tell really good stories with very small groups of characters, combining some of the original heroes with the new ones. These half-hour, power-packed stories (most notably, the Stan Berkowitz/Robert Goodman-penned ""Fearful Symmetry"") ultimately snowballed into the highly praised, two season-long ""Cadmus arc"" which involves a government conspiracy formed to combat the ever increasingly powerful Justice League. And don't forget ""Epilogue"" featuring a startling Batman revelation.

Watching the original founding members of the Justice League joined by an even greater collection of heroes including Supergirl, Green Arrow, Captain Atom, Booster Gold, Vigilante, and the Question is just fun unto itself. During a given episode, I'd be like Hey, Hawk & Dove! Hey, Booster Gold! Hey, The Question! Hey, Red Tornado! So, for me, part of the fun in having so many heroes available for JLU was seeing which hero (obscure or otherwise) would appear on the show (whether on a mission or in the background). A lot of the heroes would probably never get their own show, so JLU was a fun way of introducing these heroes in animated form.

JLU also benefited from more contributions from well-known comic book creators. Not to mention even more inspired voice casting including TV brothers Fred Savage and Jason Hervey (The Wonder Years) in reverse roles as brothers ""Hawk (the aggressor) and Dove"" (the pacifist), respectively; Dennis Farina (Crime Story, Law & Order) as aging tough guy Wildcat in ""The Cat and the Canary""; Tom Everett Scott (Saved) as gloryhound Booster Gold in ""The Greatest Story Never Told""; and CCH Pounder (ER, The Shield) as Project Cadmus leader Amanda Waller. JLU's new opening rock theme was provided by Michael McCuistion.

Though the box cover of this set is titled ""Justice League Unlimited - Season One,"" this 4-disc Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) set actually contains both JLU Seasons One and Two (each 13 episodes) for a combined count of 26 episodes. No doubt Amazon and the previous reviewer will make edits in their descriptions of this product given this revelation. Season One title aside, just know that you're getting two seasons worth of JLU episodes in one package! Special features include: ""And Justice for all"": The process of revamping the series with new characters and a new creative direction; ""Themes of Justice"": Choose your favorite JLU musical theme audio tracks; Creators' Commentary on ""This Little Piggy"" and ""The Return"".

2620981,5,B000GYI33Q,"YES! I finally got my paws on this - JLU Season One! Don't get me wrong, the first two seasons of Justice League were great! Justice League, after all, was the logical next step in the progression and maturation of the DC animated universe, which began with the superbly gritty Batman: TAS, followed by the aesthetically cleaner looking Superman: TAS. But, as a lifelong fan of crossover comics, where heroes interact daily, I was happily stunned when they, in effect, opened up the whole DC roster of heroes to the viewing audience. Justice League has always had sweeping, big-budget sensibilities and an escalated level of jeopardy. But with JLU, the scope expands even more and the stakes are raised even higher. Time travel, technology run amok, magic of the highest order, clandestine government operations - these are all effectively explored in JLU.

Warner Brothers may label it as the complete first season but this box set actually includes JLU Seasons 1 and 2 (chronologically Justice League seasons 3 and 4, if you really wanna get technical). Following the harrowing closing events of Justice League Season Two, in which the team thwarts an alien invasion and suffers betrayal from a League member, the third season finds the League expanding its roster from the original seven to over 50 costumed heroes, thus meriting the title change to Justice League Unlimited. These new episodes, while still occasionally showcasing the core members, tend to focus more on the new recruits. Noteworthy rookies are Green Arrow, Captain Atom, the Question, Black Canary, the Atom, Booster Gold, and Supergirl. JLU, unlike Justice League, features a continuing story arc which, in effect, inundates the whole season. In JLU Season 1, the focusing element is more or less the shady, super-secret government agency Project Cadmus and its insiduous machinations and escalating hostilities against the League. Project Cadmus, which deals in genetic engineering, is the government's first line of defense should the Justice League go rogue. Project Cadmus initially came into being after a brainwashed Superman attempted to invade Earth (Superman: TAS Volume 3, ""Legacy""). The incident with the Justice Lords (Justice League Season 2: ""A Better World"") merely broadened the Project's goals to include the League. This storyline carries over into the next season and isn't actually resolved until the final episodes of JLU Season 2. These interlinked stories serve to add fantastic depth and a sense of continuity and drive to this animated series. All the episodes are presented in their widescreen cinematic-like glory. The theme music and opening and closing sequences have been altered, but not gratingly so.

All the episodes are excellent (excepting the merely decent ""Hawk and Dove"") but my favorites of JLU Season One  are:  ""Kid Stuff,"" where we see further developments in the Batman-Wonder Woman romance and we also see four of the original Justice Leaguers converted to kids (Batboy is a gas!); ""This Little Piggy,"" where Batman attempts to rescue the porcine Wonder Woman and, along the way, gets to sing ""Am I Blue?"" in a nightclub; ""The Greatest Story Never Told,"" which is all about the glory hound Booster Gold and his sycophant robot sidekick Skeets; and the very cool ""The Once and Future Thing"" storyline, which has League members chasing Chronos and traveling back in time to the Old West and then to the future of the Batman Beyond universe. It was nice to see old friends Static and Terry McGinnis (Bats Beyond) again in the ""The Once and Future Thing: Part 2."" Standout episodes of Season 2 are: ""The Ties That Bind,"" which casts Mr. Miracle in a starring role; ""Task Force X,"" where you just have to root for the bad guys; ""Clash,"" which pits the World's Mightiest Mortal vs. the Man of Steel; and the 4 episodes (""Question Authority,"" ""Flashpoint,"" ""Panic in the Sky,"" and ""Divided We Fall"") which conclude the Project Cadmus arc.

The voice actors continue to lend gravitas to their animated roles. The great Kevin Conroy is simply irreplaceable as Bats. Carl Lumbly contributes depth and weight and conveys a sense of unimagined solitude in his Martian Manhunter vocalizations, while Maria Canals ably portrays the feisty warrior-woman Shayera Hol (Hawkgirl). Phil LaMar gives John Stewart (Green Lantern) a formidable military sensibility. I still miss Tim Daly as Superman, but George Newbern comes into his own as the  season progresses. Clancy Brown's awesome voice is used to great effect in his rendering of the wily, ever-scheming Lex Luthor. Kin Shriner, by the way, voices the stubborn Green Arrow to contentious perfection.

Now, for having 2 seasons come in one packaging, this 4-dvd-set doesn't really have a lot of extra features. Disc 1 has ""And Justice for All"" - a 9-minute look at the revamping process of the series, as well as audio commentaries (by Bruce Timm & others) on 2 episodes: ""This Little Piggy"" and ""The Return"". Disc 4 contains ""Themes of Justice"" - where you select (yawn!) your favorite JLU musical audio track - and trailers for other animated shows. And...that's it! So, yeah, the lack of more extras is very disappointing.

********************************************************************

Justice League Unlimited Season One contains these episodes:

""Initiation"" (episode 1) -  Green Arrow takes center stage as he reluctantly becomes a member of JLI, joining forces with Green Lantern, Captain Atom and Supergirl as they fly to Asia to face off against a gigantic nuclear creature. Green Arrow's loose cannon persona amusingly clashes with Capt. Atom's rigidness.

""For the Man Who Has Everything"" (episode 2) -  Batman and Wonder Woman drop in on Superman for his birthday in the Fortress of Solitude, only to find that Mongol has also crashed the party and has brought snacks for everyone - knuckle sandwiches.

""Kid Stuff"" (episode 3) -  Mordred magicks all adults off the planet, but his mother Morgan Le Fay enchants Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern into tots to combat him. A humorous, must-see episode.

""Hawk and Dove"" (episode 4) -  The focus is on the war-minded Hawk and his peace-loving brother Dove as they, with the aid of Wonder Woman, go up against the Annihilator, an invincible creature of war created by Ares in an attempt to initiate WWIII.

""This Little Piggy"" (episode 5) -  The enchantress Circe transforms Wonder Woman into a pig in this hilarious episode. Batman, with Zatanna, must find a way to change Wonder Woman back.

""Fearful Symmetry"" (episode 6) -  Project Cadmus comes to the fore as Supergirl begins to delve into her disturbing dreams, with the help of Green Arrow and the inquisitive Question. Cameo appearance by Prof. Hamilton from the animated Superman series.

""The Greatest Story Never Told"" (episode 7) -  Booster Gold is shunted off to the side and relegated to crowd control as the big guns battle the powerful Mordru. However, Booster gets a shot at the big time when he chances upon a sentient black hole that threatens to swallow, well, just about everything.

""The Return"" (episode 8) -  The unstoppable superandroid Amazo (from Justice League Season 2: ""Tabula Rasa"") returns from deep space and vengefully targets Lex Luthor, who has ""turned over a new leaf."" The full might of the JLU is set loose for the first time as the heroes attempt to nullify Amazo. Meanwhile, it's up to Luthor and the Atom to come up with a weapon to save the day.

""Ultimatum"" (episode 9) -  Maxwell Lord is the money man behind the Ultimen, a supposedly altruistic band of superheroes, who wants to be the people's choice of heroes. Of course, they end up confronting the JLU. This is a great nostalgia piece for fans of the Superfriends show, as the members of the Ultimen are based in large part on old-school heroes such as Apache Chief, Samurai, Black Lightning, and the Wonder Twins. Also, Project Cadmus once again rears its ugly head.

""Dark Heart"" (episode 10) -  The JLU tries to hold off an invading nanotechnological alien creature, who is self-replicating and ever expanding. It's up to the Atom again to breach the surface of the alien technology and cut things down to size (sorry).

""Wake the Dead"" (episode 11) -  An out-of-control, muddle-headed Solomon Grundy is magically restored to life and begins to wreak havoc. Dr. Fate and Aquaman, among others, attempt to counter him, but it's finally up to a grieving Shayera to put a final end to Grundy. A bittersweet ending to this story.

""The Once and Future Thing, Part 1: Weird Western Tales"" (episode 12) -  A rousing time travel two-parter. Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Bats temporally chase Chronos into the Old West, where they hook up with DC western heroes such as Jonah Hex, Batlash and El Diablo. Then the Justice Leaguers, still tracking Chronos, travel to the future universe of Batman Beyond.

""The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time, Warped"" (episode 13) -  Conclusion. In the Batman Beyond universe, the time-travelling Justice Leaguers partner up with the future Justice League to shut down Chronos. The future Justice League has on its roster Batman Beyond, Warhawk (Green Lantern and Shayera's son), and a mature Static. The current League also meets the future Bruce Wayne, very much older and arthritic but still very intense and in full faculty.

Justice League Unlimited Season 2 contains the following episodes:

""The Cat and the Canary"" (episode 1) - The Black Canary and Green Arrow try to help Canary's mentor Wildcat, who's indulging his midlife crisis by competing in Meta-Brawl, an underground super-powered fight club.

""The Ties That Bind"" (episode 2) - This episode focuses on Jack Kirby's Fourth World characters as only Flash is willing to lend an assist to escape-artist Mr. Miracle and Big Barda, who - in order to save Oberon from Granny Goodness - must infiltrate an escape-proof prison and release Kalibak from the clutches of Vermin Vunderbarr.

""The Doomsday Sanction"" (episode 3) - As the JLU attempts a rescue mission of an island beleaguered by an active volcano and Batman looks into Project Cadmus, Superman tussles with an escaped Doomsday.

""Task Force X"" (episode 4) - An undercover ops group, headed by Amanda Waller and consisting of costumed criminals Capt. Boomerang, Deadshot, the Clock King and Plastique, is given a mission to infiltrate the JLU satellite headquarters to steal an artifact. Shades of the Suicide Squad! What a fun episode!

""The Balance"" (episode 5) - When Wonder Woman tries to steal Hawkgirl's mace, she instead ends up partners with Shayera as they fly to Tartarus, where Felix Faust now reigns supreme.

""Double Date"" (episode 6) - The Huntress and the Question target Steven Mandragora, a crime boss who the Huntress believes murdered her parents. Unfortunately, Mandragora is in protective custody and being watched over by Green Arrow and Black Canary.

""Clash"" (episode 7) - Very cool episode, as Capt. Marvel (""Shazam!"") is the JLU's newest recruit. But Marvel's naive, optimistic outlook constantly irks a disenchanted Superman, and this eventually results in a brutal, drag-down battle royale between the Man of Steel and the Big Red Cheese. Luthor co-stars as the main catalyst for Superman's ire.

""Hunter's Moon"" (episode 8) - Shayera is spotlighted as she, Vixen and Vigilante respond to a distress call from space and are accosted by revenge-minded Thanagarians. The tension between Shayera and Vixen (both of whom have an eye on John Stewart) is palpable. Nice to have Vigilante in a hefty role, for once.

""Question Authority"" (episode 9) - This is the episode that brings the Project Cadmus saga to a head. While nosing around Project Cadmus, the Question unearths an insidious plot that puts the JLU in direct jeopardy.

""Flashpoint"" (episode 10) - Luthor uses his control of Watchtower weaponry to frame the Justice League. Project Cadmus revives Galatea and the Ultimen and points them towards the League. Supes and Capt. Atom face off.

""Panic in the Sky"" (episode 11) - The Justice League founding members (but one) give themselves up to the authorities until the truth is uncovered about the firing of the Watchtower ion cannon. Meanwhile, Project Cadmus launches an all out attack on the beleaguered JLU. Meanwhile, Batman confronts Amanda Waller.

""Divided We Fall"" (episode 12) - The original seven Justice League members battle the combined technological might of Lex Luthor/Brainiac. Flash takes the kid gloves off in this one.

""Epilogue"" (episode 13) - In this season coda, the focus is strictly on Terry McGinnis (Batman Beyond), who questions his past, future and legacy as a crimefighter. Along the way, he chances upon an aged Amanda Waller, who gives him advice and tells him a previously undisclosed Batman story.

Presented in awesome widescreen format, with a running time totalling at 595 minutes, and packaged in a double Amaray case, this 4 disc box set is not to be missed!",1154044800,218,12972,5.064289066166119

For people who want to see more minor DC characters like Green Arrow, Black Canary, Huntress, the Question, and more done brilliantly, this show is excellent.  The dialogue is really well written, and some of the snappy comebacks and arguing between Black Canary and Green Lantern are hilarious.

Since everyone was already introduced and the layout was pasted, they decided it was time to had fun. Ive seen this show a dozen of times and it still remains refreshing to me. I believe this show ended a bit early honestly and I'd wish they couldve had just one more season to sprout some of the league members who weren't on the spotlight that long and leaves you wanting more - rewatching episodes to find more story and layers. This expansion never gets repetitive with it's inside jokes, puns, and cliches. Most fun Ive ever had watching a animated series from Batman TAS the continium grew with the age of it's starting audience making this a gem sprout with strong roots. I mean it...

As a fan of comic books as super heroes, I have watched the entire Justice League series and I have to say it is one of my favorite series of all time along with X-Men which I own the entire collection of.

While this may look like just another cartoon to many, this series should not be so easily dismissed. The writing contains lots of adult subject matter which most kids will not understand, yet they may find this series enjoyable as well. Kevin Conroy is the quintessential Bataman/Bruce Wayne and Michael Rosenbaum does a stellar job as The Flash and is by far the heart and soul of the team.

I will be purchasing the Justice League Complete series for myself as I thoroughly enjoyed it when I originally watched. A must for comic book and super hero fans everywhere!",1391558400,,831,4.496688741721854

2621248,4,B000GYI33Q,"Some other reviews have complained that this series focuses too much on lesser known DC characters. There's nothing wrong with that. Don't get me wrong. Superman and Batman are two of my favorite characters, but there are other interesting characters in DC (Green Arrow, Black Canary, Huntress, Captain Atom). Just like Marvel isn't just Spider-Man and Wolverine, DC has many great characters. If people kept an open mind and watched the episodes, they'd realize that. Since the series was made around the time of the Iraq War, it contains many overt references to government conspiracies. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because the episodes are only 30 minutes long (the original series had a full hour per episode).

2621263,5,B000GYI33Q,"I admit I enjoyed Justice League Unlimited better than the standard Justice League. Adding more heroes to the mix to me at least made the show have more variety. In the regular Justice League animated series there was very little guest stars from the DC Universe, it stayed mainly on the core members.

If your a fan of animated DC universe and haven't seen Justice League Unlimited yet I would recommend picking it up. The box set includes the first two seasons (though it only shows it as the first seasons, the second season box set is actually the third and final).

I would also recommend watching the DC animated movie ""Crisis on Two Earths"" this movie was originally supposed to be a transition episode between the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.
It shows how Wonder Woman all the sudden has the invisible plane in JLU (taken from Owlman), the building of the watchtower,teleporters and them deciding to recruit more heroes into the league.

The discs are shown in Widescreen and look great on DVD. Though on the fourth disc the episodes are mixed up from what it shows on the box. The episode ""Hunters Moon"" was put between ""To Question Authority and Flashpoint"" mixing up the two parter, ""Hunters Moon"" was supposed to the first episode on disc 4 but instead my set had ""Question Authority"" so they were out of sequence. Not sure this is an issues on all sets but was on mine.",1357516800,,1398,4.651821862348178
2621264,5,B000GYI33Q,"I'll start off by saying that the streaming service was excellent. This is without a doubt the best season of Justice League. This season is the Cadmus arc which deals with the Justice League's most dangerous yet legitimate enemy. I say legitimate because they are kind of justified in their actions. Kids will love it because of the superhero actions, and adults will love it because of the political undertones and brilliant writing.",1357257600,,435,4.972602739726027
2621265,2,B000GYI33Q,"I was very disappointed from this season. It is in my opinion far less interesting than the previous Justice league seasons, or the Avengers. Every story is short, and a silly story about one or two of the characters.

And while the 1st two seasons are awesome, we're still quite fortunate to be able to witness more of what Bruce Timm & company would come to unravel on these last two seasons. Dc Comics & Warner Bros. thankfully continue to put out grade A animation series' &  films that precisely captures these immortal pop culture icons gracefully & timelessly. It's like the writers took a syringe & injected just the right amount of history & mythology from the comics into this show. Sadly while Justice League ended we did get several animated films which continue to top just about most of the other animated endeavors from other comic book publishers. Like Batman the animated series, this is a cartoon thats in a class of it's own. The difference between the 1st two seasons is ""Unlimited"" features a much bigger cast of characters but ironically the episodes are much more self contained making it more accessible for the unfamiliar viewer.

2621299,3,B000GYI33Q,"This was my long-awaited introduction to the animated Justice League. I remember the greatest show growing up was Batman. And then like a cybernetic vision of ecstasy, Batman Beyond came and obliterated my 11 year old mind. I never had cable, so I never had the Justice League. Regardless, my imagination explored scenarios of how great the Justice League could be. Now that I'm in my twenties, I've started buying Batman, Superman, and Batman Beyond seasons, and I've been loving them to death. When I got around to this season of JLU, I was shocked at how un-extraordinary this show was. The thing that leaves JLU lifeless in the face of its predecessors, is that those ""Timmverse"" shows were filled with heart and soul. JLU on the other hand, screens like a cold fire.

I can't truly speak for the first volumes of Justice League, because I haven't seen them, but if they're anything like JLU, I believe that they may have ushered in the modern era of bad cartooning. Everything is battle, explosions, bad jokes, heroes butting heads, and animation that makes you long for the real thing. If you were a kid when I was a kid, you might be able to recall how quality shows like Batman, Gargoyles, X-Men, The Tick, and Aladdin started disappearing in the face of garbage like the Jackie Chan show, Static Shock, TMNT, and X-Men Evolution. Maybe it was just cause I was getting older... But even then I realized those shows had a lot of flash, but no substance. JLU falls heavily into this category. I would say that about 1 out of 4 episodes are worth watching, and all those episodes are near the end in the Cadmus story-arc. But even then, you'll have to stomach all the mind-numbing explosions and swinging fists.

I'm just writing this as a warning to people like me who love the Timmverse, but haven't seen the Justice League. You may be disappointed. I wish someone would have warned me.",1306713600,2,1893,4.647761194029851

2621330,5,B000GYI33Q,"I enjoyed both BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES and its Superman equivalent.  And I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons of the JUSTICE LEAGUE series, which focused on the seven founding members -- Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (the John Stewart version), the Flash (the Wally West version), the Martian Manhunter, and Batman (who resists being identified as a JLA member).  At first I did not care for JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED.  I felt that the early part of the expanded series was simply too diverse and focused on too many characters.  Furthermore, few of the newer heroes were especially interesting.  Then something remarkable happened.  About halfway what had been a merely decent season, the show suddenly became great.  How great?  If pressed, I might call Season Three of JUSTICE LEAGUE (or Season One of JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED, depending on how you count the seasons) the single finest season of any show ever made for children (with apologies to ROCK AND BULLWINKLE).

By the end of the first season of JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED, this series did things that a children's' show was not supposed to be able to do.  It had developed a string of emotionally complex and interesting characters.  Novelist E. M. Forster in his famous study ASPECTS OF THE NOVEL introduced the distinction between flat and round characters.  Flat characters are introduced full blown and pretty much the way they will always be.  They do not develop, they do not change, and there is no real depth to them. Novels with flat characters are not necessarily bad.  Virtually every character in all of Dickens novels are flat characters.  Round characters change and develop and alter over time.  They either are deep or acquire depth as they go along.  Some novelists have mixes of them.  Elizabeth Eliot in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a round character while her mother (one of the great comic characters in literature) is a flat one.  Some characters start off flat and end up round.  A great example on television is Cordelia Chase in BUFFY and ANGEL.  Probably 99.99% of all characters in children's TV shows are flat characters.  So the appearance of a number of round characters on this show is almost completely without precedent.  Also unheard of in a children's show is an adult romance, and in JLU we actually get a wonderfully complex and not easy to resolve love triangle (between an African American male, an African female, and alien though Caucasian looking female -- in talking with younger children I'm amazed at how much less conscious they are of racial difference, and given narratives like this is it any wonder?).

Almost every aspect of this show can be singled out for praise.  The animation, while limited by the economics of the half hour television format, is innovative, interesting, and progressive.  While they were clearly on a budget, the limitations of the budget do not make the impact one might have expected.  There is also interesting blending of traditional animation techniques with CGI.  This was one of the earliest places I've seen the two animation techniques combined.

The voice talent is nothing short of astonishing.  Each episode might contain a long string of well known actors, not just voice over actors, but movie and television actors.  Even a partial list of participating actors is overwhelming:  Carl Lumbley, Michael Rosenbaum (who as the voice for the Flash in one episode does a mind swap with Lex Luthor, the character he plays on SMALLVILLE), Mark Hamill, Dana Delaney, Powers Boothe, CCH Pounder, Juliet Landau, Olivia d'Abo, Robert Picardo, Robert Foxworth, Gina Torres, Hector Elizondo, Kevin Michael Richardson, Ron Perlman, Michael Dorn, James Remar, Michael Ironside, J. K. Simmons, Amy Acker, Virginia Madsen, John C. McGinley, Dave Thomas, Elizabeth Pena, Scott Patterson, Morena Baccarin, Eric Roberts, Adam Baldwin, David Ogden Stiers, Dennis Haysbert, Robert Englund, Patrick Duffy, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Jeremy Piven, Mike Farrell, Daniel Dae Kim, Stan Ridgway (the musician), Julie Bowen, Fred Dryer, Pam Grier, Neil Patrick Harris, William Katt, Udo Kier, Michael  McCean, Richard Moll, John Rhys-Davies, Stephen Root, Tom Sizemore, William Atherton, Dan Castellaneta, Enrico Colantoni, Keith David, Brad Garrett, Brian Doyle-Murray, Alfred Molina, Rob Paulsen,  Ed Asner, Robert Forster, and Nathan Fillion (who took a secondary character, the Vigilante, and made him one of the more colorful characters on the show in a couple of guest appearances).  And the list could have been extended by a large number.

All of this -- the writing, the production staff, the directors, the voice actors, the animators -- combined to make one of the most amazing animated shows ever made for children.  The earlier BATMAN and SUPERMAN shows were also good, but in retrospect they were primarily training grounds for a production staff that learned how to make better and better shows.  Much of this same crew, along with the voice over artists, worked on the forthcoming and highly anticipated Arkham Asylum console game.  If it is only a fraction as good as this series, it will be great.",1248825600,2,5139,5.116306954436451

JLU is a great continuation of the JLA stories. The beauty of this series is that you get to see many of the DC Universe's (DCU) characters not previously seen in other places. I particularly enjoyed Supergirl and Huntress, two of my favorites from the comics. Lots of interplay between the characters and maybe a few surprises, like Huntress and The Question. All in all, as an adult who followed these characters in the comics, this was a fun series to watch. Recommended for DCU fans; you'll love it!

The new blood brung in clearly shows, and Juaquin De Santos eps are usually the worse.  At least Dan Ribas feel a little like the Superman TAS in which he played a big part, but Santos's eps are easily identifiable by me in seconds.  And thats not good.

  Hate to be sound so negative, but the 2nd box of JUSTICE LEAGUE was just beautiful, and though i knew Unlimited with a shortened ep time and expanded cast couldn't possibly be as good, i hoped it would be better than it ended up being.

2621376,5,B000GYI33Q,"The thing that I have always loved about the DCAU is that though the characters are fantastic and iconic they are very human and the plots are very layered in nature. The series as a whole explores the role of superheroes in the modern security conscious world. It also seems to reflect the industry of comics itself. The episode ""clash"" is both an excuse to have old rival's captain marvel and superman fight and also could be interpreted as a Meta fictional fight between the more innocent era of comics and the more modern, socially reflective, grittier comics (a kind I personally prefer.) Justice league unlimited also makes reference to the DCAU's past, using plot points and character relationships established years ago, showing the dedication of the creators to make something for the fans. i love the way the series uses all its heros in some form and really make the storyline immersive

A great many of the Justice League appear in the series, including my personal favorites, hourman, and the creeper in small cameos. The question, another of my most loved heroes is shown in a much bigger role. He bears a much stronger resemblance to his earlier appearances but is more of a conspiracy theorist than anything else bringing his character into the modern day at the same time. I did spy some martial arts in tiny doses (He is beaten by green arrow at one point but as a fan of his Richard dragon trained incarnation I choose to think he allowed himself to be beaten...heh). With real human relationships between characters and the feeling of adult drama that the writers bring to the series and voice talent from many Whedonverse actors and other high profile stars (like ben browder of farscape fame) it takes on a level that seems more like primetime drama than kid's animation, something that the creators aimed for.

My one dissapointment with the series is nothing to do with content or quality. its more of a wish. As a fan of Superman's clone Kon-el and his clone Match I saw parallels in supergirl and her clone. I just wish they would (or could? i'm thinking of the superboy court case.) have used Kon-el. particularly since they used the idea of superman being cloned in superman TAS and they had set up cadmus in the same way as the comics. This series is fantastic and I urge you to buy it, what ever your age or your comics knowledge. Oh and look out for Jonah hex in a brilliant showing.",1207440000,,2414,4.6510538641686185

My girl's all-time personal favorite is ""Kid's stuff"", which they can watch again and again. Four of the heroes have to stop Mordrid, who has banished all adults to limbo, and in order to do this, Morgan le Fay turns them back into 8 yr. olds.

2621378,5,B000GYI33Q,"Add another 50 or so members to the 7 core members of Justice League.
Write a terrific story arc mid-to-end of the season, and you have some of the best cartoons Warner Bros have ever made.
This set comes with extras, and brings the Batman/Wonder Woman romance to full fruition in ""Kid Stuff"" and ""This little Piggy"" (in which Batman sings, to persuade Circe to remove her spell which turned WW into a pig.) Is this an homage to the Muppet Show episode with Lynda Carter, where Miss Piggy became Wonder Pig? (The episode also builds on the Batman/Zatanna friendship introduced in Batman episode ""Zatanna"" in 1993).
Sadly the romance appears to be undone by a time travel plot in ""The Once and Future Thing"" pt2 in mid season (or else it's just never shown again. I did read some great online fan fiction stories which filled the gap nicely, for fans of the Batman/Wonder Woman entanglement).

New characters Green Arrow, Question, Huntress, Atom, Black Canary, Wildcat, Capt Atom, Supergirl frequent a number of the stories. You'll also see many other DC heroes, all conveniently added to the newly renamed JLU (including cameo appearances of most members of Justice Society of America, whose heyday was in the 1940s in the comics????).
If the New Gods episodes of Superman and Justice League left you wanting a focus on Mr Miracle and Big Barda, you'll get it in ""The Ties that Bind"". Flash teams with them on a trip to Apokalips.
Hawkgirl gradually rejoins, and Luthor's character development after his JL Season 2 pardon is interesting.
The series is wrapped up with ""Epilogue"" which is set several years after ""Batman Beyond"" and sees an adult Terry McGinnes Batman looking back on his own time with old Bruce Wayne, Justice League Unlimited (introduced in Batman Beyond: The Call), and searching for answers about his own past.

Also, the writers took a step back and instilled some great humor and character interactions into the series that the Justice League lacked.  Finally, the appearance of Batman Beyond sealed the deal for me - great seeing Terry and elder Bruce Wayne interact with modern Batman!  You can't beat Amazon's price for this set.",1193702400,,753,4.976
2621422,5,B000GYI33Q,"I fell in love with the animated DC universe when the Batman series premiered in the early '90s.  When guest stars popped up, I was hopeful there would be some superteam adventures but we all had to wait a few years.  Afte the premier of the Superman series, we did get a decent Superman/Batman crossover mini-series/movie.  But still not enough heroes...

This set, actually the 1st 2 seasons of JLU (which are the 3rd & 4th seasons of ""Justice League""), is the culmination of that.  The stories, given the wider cast than the original Justice League cartoon, are more varied & fans get to see more of the characters they love in the comics universe.

Personal favorite episodes include ""For The Man Who Has Everything"" - a good adaption of the classic Alan Moore story.  Even though this is strictly Batman, Superman & Wonder Woman, it was a great JL story.

The 2-parter, ""The Once & Future Thing"" was another particular favorite.  The 1st part, when the League members are in the Old West working with classic western heroes like Apache Smith, El Diablo, Bat Lash & Jonah Hex, was a lot of fun.  The 2nd part, where the Leaguers meet the future Justice League, was a nice tie-in to ""Batman Beyond"".

Part of the fun, for me, in watching these shows, was trying to figure out who was cast for a particular voice such as Ben Browder for Bat Lash, Adam Baldwin as Jonah Hex, Amy Acker as the Huntress and, one of the best voice casting choices, John C. McGinley as the Atom.

One of the best modern animated series available, it's worth picking up if you are at all a fan of the League or superheroes in general.",1192579200,,1613,4.505154639175258

2621430,3,B000GYI33Q,"I recently picked up the boxed set of Justice League Unlimited, Season One.  The series revolves around the core of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and The Flash.  However, in this incarnation we get a full sampling of the DC universe.  Nearly every superhero from the DC roster, including Booster Gold and Black Canary gets their fifteen minutes of fame.  Its funny how you view things when you're a parent.  I guess I was hoping for a 21st century update of that old Saturday morning favorite.  Unfortunately, that's just not the case.

 So many of the shows were essentially super-powered fist fights.  Good guys fight bad guys.  Good guys fight other good guys.  In one particularly nasty slugfest, Superman goes toe to toe with Doomsday once again.  It struck me as extremely ironic when Captain Marvel steps down as a League member because he feels that his fellow League members are acting a bit less than heroic.

 I realize that a show like this is going to essentially revolve around the struggle of good versus evil.  But all of the animated fist fights were not only just a bit unsettling for me as a parent.  Quite frankly, they got to be a bit repetitive.  I chose Justice League Unlimited over its predecessor because of the wider variety of heroes.  I guess what I'm wondering is have all of the shows basically devolved into 22 minutes of battling ?

 I don't see why more of the episodes could have been about overcoming an obstacle.  Saving the earth from a meteor or a natural disaster.  Using their powers for more than just pummeling the other guy/gal/alien into a puddle of goo.  Am I being overly sensitive as a parental unit ?  The show is clearly well done.  There was character development at times, and you can certainly follow the ongoing arc where tensions abound and superheroes are just as human as you and I, beneath the cowl.  I just think it would have been more palatable, and more interesting, if every episode didn't turn into an animated outing of the WWE.",1187395200,6,2010,4.671428571428572
2621451,5,B000GYI33Q,"An incredible cast of characters, subplots and conspiracies,plot twists

2621452,5,B000GYI33Q,"I really wish they were still making this show.  I enjoy it thoroughly.  It's something that just keeps getting better and better.  From the beginnings with Batman the animated series, then the fully developed story arches of Superman, to the complex character work on Justice League, it seems like the writers and animators get more adept with each incarnation.  I was skeptical of Justice League: Unlimited (JLU), because I know that Cartoon Network had asked them to create concise half hour episodes, rather than the hour long two-parters of the previous season.  In my opinion, this actually ended up working in the show's favor.  Certain stories didn't drag on too long, and it seems like the this allowed the show to be able to explore a lot more of the new and ""minor"" characters this season.

The new characters on the team worked very well.  Among them, there is Green Arrow as the ""conscience"" of the JL.  Supergirl as the still young/inexperienced rookie.  Also, my personal favorite, The Question.  It is a character in the DC universe I really did not know much about (I was more of a Marvel person when I was growing up).  At first, I thought it was a riff on Alan Moore's Rorschach character from ""Watchmen"".  Recently I read that Rorschach was actually Alan Moore's extreme version of Steve Ditko's Question character, developed way back in 1967.  The Question character on JLU appears to be almost a cross between the two.  He is played by the brilliant Jeffrey Combs, who seems to be channeling his paranoid Milton Dammers character from Peter Jackson's ""The Frighteners"".

Speaking of ""Watchmen"", that comic seems to hold the theme for this entire season of JLU.  If you have not read ""Watchmen"", it is a comic by Alan Moore (""V for Vendetta"", ""From Hell"") which delves into the psychological aspects of super heroes.  One question the book asks is who would really become a super hero?  A noble corn fed alien farm boy (like superman), or an unstable vigilante trying to impose his own law and order on a society that he views as out of control (like batman)?  Which is modern society most likely to create?  ""Watchmen"" is one of the most sophisticated analyses of the super hero genre written, and JLU takes a stab at addressing some of these complex issues.

Another question posed in the opening pages of the ""Watchmen"" book is ""Who watches the Watchmen?"".  This question seems to be one of the major themes of JLU.  In their satellite orbiting the Earth like ancient gods looking down on the mortals, what would keep the Justice League from transforming from protectors into keepers?  Are the people worried about this for a good reason?  To answer these questions, watch the series.  In the process of finding these answers, the series presents us with some the best types of antagonists for our heroes.  Antagonists who may not be villains.  ""Bad guys"" who may not be evil.  In JLU answers are not put in simple in black-and-white terms.  This is something they have touched upon in the Batman Animated series, but they really bring it to the front of the plot in this series.

I think all the episodes of JLU are very strong.  Maybe the only weak point is the very last episode, ""Epilogue"" which was the third episode of the season that was a cross-over with the ""Batman Beyond"" series.  I wasn't really fond of the tie-in or where it took the characters, and those episodes assume the viewer has knowledge of the Batman Beyond series.  That said, it was an interesting way to show that all five of the Timm/Dini/etc. animated series were meant to be part of a somewhat contiguous DC universe: Batman, Superman, Justice League, Batman Beyond, Justice League Unlimited (and maybe even Teen Titans?).  That very minor gripe aside, this is an incredible series that is worth picking up for the complex and involved story, incredible animation, and a generally entertaining time. 4.5/5 stars.",1186963200,,3916,4.7925373134328355

2621457,5,B000GYI33Q,"Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are just three of the characters that have been around for more than five decades but their popularity has never waned. When The Cartoon Network gave the go-ahead to produce a show based on DC's The Justice League, the Warner Brothers animation team produced a cleverly-written and really exciting series with updated takes on the aforementioned trio, along with The Flash, The Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, and Hawkgirl.

When the actual third season began, the series revamped itself, not just with the core seven members but expanding the league to include over forty-five other superheroes in the DC Universe. Likewise, there was an increase in the villain quotient, not just dependable bad guys like Lex Luthor, The Joker, or Braniac, but including the likes of Gorilla Groud, Morgan LeFay, and an expanded Legion of Doom.

This compilation has some really standout installments: ""For the Man Who Has Everything"" takes a peek at an alternative life of Superman; ""Kids Stuff"" is an award-worthy tale of four Justice Leaguers turned into children; ""This Little Piggy"" is another lighter tale with a porcine Wonder Woman; and ""The Return"" is an exciting story with an impressive assault on The League by a super android.

""Wake the Dead"" showcases the league's most sympathetic character, Hawkgirl, as she makes a poignant life-and-death decision for a resurrected Soloman Grundy. ""Dark Heat"" features a seemingly unstoppable alien armada that is defeated by the smallest member of the team.  The two-part ""The Once and Future Thing"" is an imaginative journey through time.

However, the best of the bunch are the final eight installments, prior to ""Epilogue,"" which brings the Cadmus storyline to a head. ""Clash"" features a slam-bang battle between Captain Marvel and Superman, while ""Flashpoint"" and ""Panic in the Sky"" have plot twists that couldn't be anticipated.

The aforementioned ""Epilogue,"" which was scheduled to be the final episode, before the show was picked up for an additional thirteen shows, pays homage to not just this show but to ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and ""Batman: Beyond.""

The best thing about the series is its vocal casting.  Besides the original cast members (George Newbern, Carl Lumbly, Michael Rosenbaum, Maria Canals, Susan Eisenberg, Phil Lamar, and Kevin Conroy), the show also boasts a truly impressive array of guest artists.

The inspired casting of Fred Savage and Jason Hervey, brothers on ""The Wonder Years"", helps elevate the rather mundane ""Hawk and Dove"" to somewhat memorable status. The episode also has the distinctive pipes of Michael York as Aries, the god of war.

Recurring characters Dr. Emil Hamilton and Amanda Waller are given wonderful life by guests Robert Foxworth and CCH Pounder, respectively.

And Emmy-winner Ed Asner does double duty by appearing as Hephaestus in ""Hawk and Dove"" and as the deliciously wicked Granny Goodness in ""The Ties That Bind."" The latter episode also features the genius casting of Arte Johnson, reprising his German accent from the old ""Laugh-In"" days in the from of Vermin Vunderbarr.

The show utilizes traditional pen-and-ink animation coupled with impressive computer graphics.

The bonus extras on the disc are also, noteworthy, especially the commentary on both ""This Little Piggy"" and ""The Return.""",1183852800,3,3338,5.287334593572779
2621458,3,B000GYI33Q,"i was orginally going to write a very negative review.  but thats probably unwarranted in hindsight.  as the season progresses, it definitely gets better, with some big storylines developing.  but be warned:  there are some real duds in the season. the introduction of comedy and more dc characters is definitely a negative.

a lot of people seem to think the unlimited seasons are far better than previous seasons.  but as in most comic to screen adaptions, i think too many characters and/or villians 'spoils the broth' (spider-man 3 is a perfect example).  the comedy doesnt really work either.  the previous seasons were great for drama and action.  but we are now left with less of that given the show must make way for comedy and lighter episodes. saying that, when the drama/action episodes do come up, they are done with the usual skill and perfection.

For anyone interested in collecting the ""Justice League"" series, please note that the first part of the collection is ""Justice League of America"" - Seasons 1 and 2. The JLA part of the series is followed by ""Justice League Unlimited"" - Seasons 1 and 2. In reality, all four 'seasons' comprise a 14-disc, 91 episode set of the Justice League series -- from the original 7-member league featured in the JLA episodes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and the Martian Manhunter) to the much larger, much broader collection of superheroes (including Supergirl, Vixen, Black Canary, Green Arrow, the Question (""Q""), the Huntress, and scores of others) who are featured along with the original 7 members in the JLU episodes.

Whether you just really enjoy well designed animation with good storylines, miss the Saturday morning hero cartoons of your youth (though these are WAY better), or subscribe to channels like the Cartoon Network so you can watch cartoons -- even when your kids aren't watching with you, you will truly enjoy owning this collection.

The characters are mature and appear as they do in the comic, not as they should to 5 year olds. This show is smart, and deep, and funny and the animation is simply stunning. I was a pretty hardcore comic fan and the first few episodes I was a little dissappointed. What I had liked about the first 2 seasons was that the show seemed like a Justice League of America comic book. You don't really get that feeling the first two episodes, but before you really realize what's happening; you don't care. You see Flash and Mister Miracle rescue Kalibek on Apokolips, or Green Arrow duke it out with Wildcat. Captain Atom AND Captain Marvel both throw down with Superman and it's absolutely amazing! There's also a continuing plotline and increasing tension between the expanded Justice League and Cadmus Labs.

Helmed by Bruce Timm who was the key designer of the forementioned shows, ""JLU"" takes the Justice League to new heights. It follows the original ""Justice League,"" volumes 1 and 2 and is a natural extension. Timm and Wayne McDuffie and their talented co-horts explore areas most comic fanboys only dream of. ""JLU,"" lets viewers follow characters like Green Arrow, Supergirl, the Question, Huntress, Booster Gold (and many others)and the results are wonderful. Of course, we get to see plenty of the founding seven members.

But the most telling thing is that we get the feeling that Timm and company want to steer their cast to new areas. Hence the inclusion of humorous stories (the story about Wonder Woman being turned into a pig is a brilliant example) which didn't seem practicable in ""Justice League,"" but fits in perfectly with ""JLU.""

The result is animated storytelling at its finest. Not only that, the creators stay true to the characters (a difficult thing to do in animated comic book stories).

I am pleased this series eventually came to an end, but really recommend that if you needed to choose ONE Justice League DVD then pick the previous Justice League first season DVD set which far surpass this mindless season.  It appears that in JLU, most episodes are designed to showcase the many DC Universe stars and sacrifice GOOD story telling in the process.

voice the characters are the best!  If you think, ""It's just a cartoon""

you won't be after watching it. If you really like it then check out

Batman Vol. 4, where they first experimented with adding more superheroes,

then Superman Animated Series and Justice League Season 1 & 2.  The

How wrong I was. Cracked by the publicity and burger toys that came with Superman Returns, and bored with watching Fantastic Four - animated series, I bought this box set. Where have I been going wrong this past 35 years??? This is absolutely knockout, every story a winner, filled with wit and humor, extreme comic book violence without the gore, and the best possible voice acting.

2: No Chapter Breaks. Makes zippping forwards and backwards inside an episode more difficult, having to manually scan.

3: NO SUBTITLES. This i can't understand. Spanish and French audio tracks are included, which is good, but none of the languages have subtitles for hearing impared or when you want/have to watch in a quiet enviroment. This is literally standard for DVDs yet is neglected.

Justice League features similar characters but requires a more mature audience.  It has bad guys with live machine guns shooting at innocent people (though nobody gets hit), and the fighting is quite forceful.  It's not appropriate for kids her age.  (And she agreed.)

If you want a fun superhero show that's more exciting than Super Friends, try Kim Possible.  After that, try the Teen Titans DVDs, which do have shooting, but it's very unrealistic (e.g., energy bolts flying out of someone's hands).",1168300800,,634,4.9904761904761905

I won't do a rundown of the individual episodes, but the story arc for the season involves a top secret collaboration aimed at reining in Earth's superheroes-- namely, the Justice League. Amanda Waller, General Wade Eiling and Prof. Emil Hamilton (all names that should be familiar to longtime DC readers) are at the head of this group... and their weapons include the brutal monster Doomsday and a grown-up version of Supergirl. They have one more partner... but I won't spoil the surprise by revealing THAT.

2621539,5,B000GYI33Q,"I wasn't all that impressed with the original Justice League, seemed like it was just superheros get captured, Batman figures it out, they use their powers to beat bad guys, and repeat.  That being said, they were still a lot higher quality than most animated fare of late.

However, when they went to season 3, they retooled the show.  Now instead of six or seven heroes, you have a lot of them.  The Justice League opens up to most of the DC Universe.  It's worth it alone to see Supergirl brought back again, as well as an episode that includes Static Shock, Batman Beyond, and even Parasite gets a cameo!

This isn't exactly a kids show, though I can see how it'd be quite entertaining to them and they do go out of their way (too much really) to show people getting out of tanks, buildings, etc. so they are clearly not killed.  Nothing to upset the kiddies.  The impressive thing is how the show not only does interesting episodes and introduces characters, there's also an over-arching plot that slowly builds and seems like it would happen in real life, of course if you assumed superheros are real and building contractors work 24/7 fixing all the stuff they trash.

Seriously, this is a must have.  The animation is wonderful, the characters great, the voices superb, the story line detailed.  I can't wait for the next JLU to come out.  I don't get the show anymore, but I'm willing to buy it blind from seeing this season.",1165190400,,1434,4.55859375

This show explores the DC superhero universe in great detail. These episodes use at least one of the Justice League main cast and showlights other DC characters (Hawk & Dove, Captain Atom, Green Arrow, The Question, Supergirl, Question, Vixen,Booster Gold, etc).

To start with , I don't care of this box of Justice League Unlimited is one season or two. This 26 episodes set  are great comics brought to animation life.

My favorite episodes . Well one is the two part, The Once and Future Thing. In the first episode,Batman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman travel back in time to stop a time travel villian and meet and fight beside  DC's Western characters  (Pow Wow Smith, Jonah Hex, El Diablo and Bat Lash). Then in the second  episode, they travel forward to the Future where Batman meets Batman Beyond and other JLU members. Interesting  TV and use of DC characters in these episodes. One would wish they would have done this in thirds to cover the DC World War two charcters of the Haunted Tank, Sgt, Rock, The Unknown Soldier, and The Losers-But alas this never came to pass.

The other favorite  is the four part story line  (Question Authority, Flashpoint, Panic in the Sky, and Divided We Fall). These  episode hinged of last season's Justice Lord Saga covered in Justice League Volume two DVD collection. This has it all, the Government reaction force (headed by Amanda Waller), Lex Luthor (and his bid-if you read the comics -of Lex Luthor for President), Brainiac and the basic Justice League..this has been coming since the beginning of the set second thirteen episodes. The action is good. The story line is riveting for a cartoon

.

A friend who didn't watch many cartoons, said ""This is addicting""..for me to hear that is high praise indeed. I can not wait until the final thirteen episodes of Justice League Unlimited come out in March, I am booking it now!

2621561,5,B000GYI33Q,"Modern comic books seem completely unreadable to me these days.  Every time I have picked up a book that fans rave about as the latest best thing out there, I've been disappointed.  The magic is gone from comic books.

However, ""Justice League Unlimited"" delivers where the modern printed page comic books have failed.  This box set contains the best comic book writing since Alan Moore's ""Watchmen.""  What we have here in this DVD set is a good story told well -- the essence of good writing.  The episodes are creative and nuanced and all the little things are done correctly.  As close to anything available in any medium, ""Justice League Unlimited"" captures the best elements of the Silver Age comic books, yet is completely modern, fresh and new.  It is quite a feat of creative effort to have produced a program like this that will appeal to the typical 8-12 year-old boy and the 40-50 year-old long term superhero comic book fan.

Given the high level of adult appeal for this set, I'm surprised it was not released in HD-DVD like the 5th season of Smallville.  However, I greatly appreciate the recent trend of releasing full-season sets of the Bruce Timm produced shows.

Indispensable elements of this set are the voice performances of Kevin Conroy as Batman and Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor.  Both actors are absolutely perfect in their roles which is great because their characters are the prime movers of the running storyline.  It's quite something when great actors perform great writing.

With the live-action superhero movies making big money with (at best) mediocre writing, I wonder why the big screen movie studios overlook the tremendous talent of Bruce Timm's creative team?  How much money could be made if the next live-action Batman or Superman movie was driven by the creative talent behind Justice League Unlimited?

Justice League Unlimited delivers the goods.  This disc set is a keeper to place in your collection without regrets.  This may be the last time we see something this good in this genre.",1163635200,4,2027,4.894428152492669

2621563,5,B000GYI33Q,"JLU is probably the finest example of how a comic book should be translated into cartoon form. This particular season (technically seasons... since, on Cartoon Network, they were broken into 13 episodes per season...) has the benefit of having some of the best animated television of all time, not only of the Justice League series but of all animated programs ever... First off, as far as the ""Best Of"" list comes 'For The Man Who Has Everything', which is, to my knowledge, the only Justice League specific tale that was taken directly from a single issue of a comic (I say Justice League specifically, because Batman: The Animated Series had a few eps that were directly from comic sources, and of course some of the old 60's era Marvel cartoons, like Captain America, Spider-Man, and Iron Man were practically lifted directly from the page!!). And this particular issue was conceived and done by the single greatest writer in comics history, Alan Moore, and his co-star from WATCHMEN, Dave Gibbons. This is one of the greatest single issues of a comic book of all time, and it is translated superbly. Also in this season is 'This Little Piggy', which is, without a doubt one of the single funniest half-hours you'd ever see on TV. The arc of this set, which involves Project Cadmus and their belief that the Justice League should be considered a very serious threat to the entire planet, is an absolutely captivating one. It permeates almost the entire season, and gives some feelings that is not normally captured in ""kids"" cartoons: Paranoia, suspicion, guilt, fear... this is not necessarily a cartoon that is directed entirely at children, nor just comic book fans. There are several themes that work on par with some of the most powerful live-action programs on television. The two side characters that seem to get the most to do here in this season are Green Arrow and The Question, who are very much opposites of the same coin... GA is extrememly leftist who has no agenda past helping ""the little people"" and is uncertain that a group like the Justice League should be completely trusted to always look out for the best interests of others, and then we have probably the most interesting character the series has to offer, which is The Question... a conspiracy theorist that makes Oliver Stone seem tame, who finds himself at the center of one of the darkest secrets of both the League and Cadmus. The 2-parter 'Question Authority' and 'Flashpoint' are extremely powerful episodes of television and they pave the way for all that is going to come in the season. And the resolution of that leads us to the season's final and perhaps finest episode, simply titled 'Epilogue', which is actually a heavily Batman-centric episode, but not in the way you'd expect. It's an episode that rivals the best that television has to offer, and that's all I really need to say about it. Frankly, this is a program that was so good, it was destined for cancellation from the moment it was conceived as trying to be something more than just a ""kiddie cartoon"". In a time where kids' choices between cartoons are Spongebob and Yu-Gi-Oh and Teen Titans and dozens of other cookie-cutter programs, it was very refreshing to see a show that dared to ask certain questions and maybe make kids think a little rather than be bombarded by wacky visuals that are completely without substance. JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED are simply 2 of the best cartoons to ever air, and I can't wait until they announce the second set of JLU!!!",1163030400,2,3531,4.799671592775041
2621564,1,B000GYI33Q,"The episodes are great! And so it is disappointing as [censored] that WB don't put the episodes out in the right order - which have the consequence of messing up a story arc. It takes so little research to put the episodes in the right order, and it means so much to fans of the series, that it is UNFORGIVABLE ... hence my one star. (I just can't believe it can happen. I thought WB was a giant cooperation with concerns about their image, instead it seems that WB are as infantile as Bugs Bunny, whom I personally outgrew at the age of 3 seconds. If I give WB too less credit, then they must have done the mix-up of episodes on purpose - making it more rational for people in the near future to buy this product AGAIN in high def without the mix-up. So what are you WB? Babys or evil masterminds?)

I'm sorry to create a bad atmosphere, when people, looking at this title, probably just want to read some positive comments, to get excited, when looking forward to buying it (I do, when browsing products), but I believe it is even more dissapointing to discover the episode mix-up on the dvds unwarned, and I just had to get my dissapointment of WB out in the world.",1162857600,4,1168,4.3090909090909095
2621565,4,B000GYI33Q,"Justice League Unlimited is by far one of the best American animated shows ever produced. More than a simple continuation of the Justice League series, JLU throws in almost every hero from the DC comics universe while upping the production quality, storytelling, and complexity immensely. Every episode presents something new to see, some new hero to meet, some plot twist or secret to reveal. It's a full-on spectacle that marches in confidently and pulls no punches. There's enough action crammed into these 26 episodes that its as satisyfing as the full 52-episode run of the original Justice League series, and with none of the excess padding.

That's why its so disappointing to see JLU get a problematic release on dvd. The good news is that Warner gave us two full 13-episode seasons at once, covering the intense Cadmus storyline. We also get an anamorphic transfer, and while its not a perfect transfer the image looks great on an HDTV. However, due to a miscommunication in production, there are no extras that cover episodes 14-26. Warners is trying to compensate with a featurette on the next set, but as it stands we get no commentary on the best episodes of the series. There are also menu problems, such as the switching of 2 episodes that breaks up a 4-part story arc, and also an audio glitch in the episode ""Divided We Fall.""

Objectively, the problems are small. But overall the set has a really rushed feel, and I wouldn't have minded a delay till next year if it meant giving the series the treatment it deserved. The series is worth 5 stars, the set is worth 3. If WHV wants my money, they need to get their quality control back in line.",1162684800,7,1659,4.697594501718213

I just want to say that having grown up reading JLA comics, this old coot turns into a little kid again watching all my buds come to life on the screen.  Now that I have all the released eposodes on these DVDs, it's almost like watching them for the first time with no ad breaks, no stupid Toonami logos with inane, time-wasting robotic crap and no #**@&^$ pop-ups telling me what I'm watching!  I have the episodes in widescreen and all the clarity one could ask for.  For me, there are no bad eps.  Moreover, this is actually JLU Seasons 1 and 2.  I'm now waiting to get that last great season and have the complete series.  The character development is good, and the pairing of some the guys with the gals is interesting, to say the least.  The question and Huntress - I kinda agree with Black Canary - ""Eew"", but it adds to the atmosphere if nothing else.  The artwork and animation staff for the series did good to let Hawkgirl get rid of the head gear.  Batman steadily remains his cheerful self throughout, and Green Arrow holds up his agreement to be their conscience as does the Flash on more than one occasion.  I do wish they would have given more air time for the Creeper.  I have one of his earliest comics, and I love the way he scared the you-know-what out of bad guys with his maniacial laughter.  He's one of my faves.  In the last season, we got to see Supergirl grow up.  What a difference a couple of years made with her.  It's fun to be overwhelmed by super heroes and pause the image now and then to see who all is in the frame.  I will be watching for the last 13 eps.  May they be released soon.

I returned the item to Amazon, and Amazon replaced it in a flash.  Again, Disc 3 would not play in my computer DVD player, and it took several times of ejecting and reinserting the DVD into my standard DVD player to even start the disc.  I returned (sadly) the item again to Amazon who said that they have been experiencing numerous problems with this DVD edition.  So, sadly my wait continues....buyer beware.

2621569,5,B000GYI33Q,"I'm not going to repeat the praise the JLU has received in the previous reviews, I just wanted to point out a couple of errors on Disc 4.  First, the episodes are not in order.  The first episode on the disc is ""Question Authority"" followed by ""Hunter's Moon.""  Okay, this wouldn't be a huge complaint if ""Question Authority"" wasn't part one of four and ended on a cliffhanger.  The way it is, it's a bit jarring if you select the play all.  Was it really that much trouble to look at an episode guide while putting this disc together?  Or maybe actually watch the episodes so that you realize that ""Hey, Question Authority goes after Hunter's Moon!""  The second problem with disc 4 was the sound looping problem on ""Divided We Fall"" that was already pointed out before.  Wonder Woman says ""Mind if we switch dance partners"" or something to that effect, and even though we are on a shot of Superman and Wonder Woman we hear Green Lantern grunting and slamming his hammer down....like 2 times before it actually happens.  It's also telling that the music in the background loops twice as well.  I guess my final complaint about this set is the fact that there were no bonus features for the second season (which is apparently now the second half of season one according to Warner).  Normally, I'm not disapointed by the lack of extras because I'm only after the series it's self, but I was hoping for at least a commentary track or two for the final arc and Epilogue.  I think this is the most disapointed I've been in one of the DCAU box sets.  I thought Justice League season 2 was upsetting, but the releases seem to be getting sloppier instead of Warner learning from their mistakes.  We as fans complain to get the shows we want, but that doesn't mean we want rushed sloppy releases.

An odd looping of the audio track at the 14 minute mark, the scene where Superman and Wonder Woman ""switch dance partners"" is replaced with the audio of Green Lantern smashing the fake Hawkgirl with that big hammer... twice before resuming normalcy.

2621591,5,B000GYI33Q,"I tell my wife that I buy the Justice League season-releases for myself AND the kids. But it is me who sits most captivated in front of the TV with the kids as the episodes roll.

Shushing the kids so I can hear ""cartoons"" on TV is the joke my wife likes to make. I quickly correct her, ""Justice League is NOT 'cartoons.' It's an 'animated series.'"" This clarification for some reason always seems to bring on even more chuckles over a bottle of wine with friends than it does clarify the matter.

Anyway, indeed the kids sit captivated too. The Justice League stories are very well put together with a lot of detail. I'm not sure that my kids (age 3 - 7) appreciate or understand all of the emotion (sometimes pretty deep), heroism (of course), betrayal and just great story telling that goes into these Justice League productions. But rest assured, Justice League Unlimited is definitely for kids too.

Unlike Seasons 1 & 2 of Justice League, Justice League Unlimited are 26 single episodes (with the exception of the 2-part The Once And Future Thing)...but all the episodes tie together nicely, and indeed they pick up right where Justice League Seasons 1 & 2 left off. It is not necessary to have viewed Justice League Seasons 1 & 2 to fully comprehend and enjoy Justice League Unlimited....But I highly recommend it.

The only very minor shortfall of this series release is the lack of extras. I'm not usually big on extras, but a guide to all of the new (to me) heroes, friends and villians in these episodes would have been nice for those that don't read the comic books. A short overview of how we got from Justice League Seasons 1 & 2 to Justice League Unlimited would also have been helpful. Instead they gave me a $5 off coupon for video games. Lame.

2621594,5,B000GYI33Q,"Ill be very brief for those who already know about the show itself. Episodes are some of the best from the whole DC animated universe, specially the last 5 ones. Great show, great drama and action, you cant miss it for anything in the world. HOWEVER, this edition has NO extras on the episodes from the 2nd season (Warner Video decided to merge season 1 and 2 into 1 only for this release), so all the extras are about the first 13 episodes (season 1). Also, altho this set comes with english, spanish and french dubds, this set won't come with ANY subtitles. They decided to change the spanish dubs on the 2nd and 3rd season so its quite awkard after so many time having the same cast. Besides that, art covers and menu covers are outdated and most of the art uses art from previous shows (aka JL, not JLU). No chapter stops as well.

As I said it before, the show itself gets maximum rating from me (Widescreen episodes), but this edition is rushed and somehow incomplete without extras on the 2nd season episodes. The show is perfect and it really deserved a better release but whatever, at least we are getting the episodes right?

Producers have said they will include the missing extras on the next set but thats ANOTHER story (aka more money, since youd have to buy another set to get those extras...hope they won't forget to put extras for the following season by putting the missing ones from this one!!)

If you don't have a problem with that then Id recommend you getting this set RIGHT NOW! You won't regret it!!!! Great job Bruce Timm & co.!!!",1160611200,6,1556,4.491166077738516
2621595,3,B000GYI33Q,"No need to linger on the many qualities of this show.

As for the DVD, it shows once again that Warner Home Video doesn't treat their customers well. They were supposed to release the season one first (ie the 13 first episodes) on 2 discs. For that they recorded 2 commentaries and a few other extras. Since the show is now over (too bad...), they then decided they had to release the rest of it as quickluy as possible, to get rid of it. So they added season two to this set. For those who don't know, season two is pure genius. And of course Warner did not take the time to record comentaries for that one (and it really needed some coverage). That's right, there is not extras whatsoever about the Cadmus plot or the fabulous ""Epilogue"" episode. There won't be any subtitles either, because it would have taken too much time to make, so they put some French track (awful dubbing by the way): another detail showing Warner's despise of their customers. In a nutshell : buy this set, and CURSE WARNER !",1159833600,11,1003,4.421621621621622
2621596,5,B000GYI33Q,"From the WWII episode at the end of ""Justice League"" Season One all the way through to the Last episode of ""Justice League Unlimited"" there are very, very few bad moments. As a lifelong comic book (and especially DC) fan who has waited all his life for someone to finally DO IT RIGHT, I have been awed since episode 1 of Batman: The Animated Series, through Superman: The Animated Series, through Batman Beyond, through Static Shock, through Justice League, and all the way to the end of JLU. That being the case I am simply amazed and apalled at some of the reviews on this page. No market for some of these characters? Like Booster Gold? Have you even been paying attention to the DC stories since Identity Crisis? Booster was an interesting way to tell a story, though different than those of the other heroes. He was a used car salesman that later found it within himself to pull it together, avenge his lost friends, and allow the new post-crisis age to happen. And his episode of JLU was priceless; (not to mention that it featured ""Elongated Man"" talking about ""Plastic Man""!).

I must add: ""This Little Piggy"" gets my vote as the most enjoyable, crazy, chaotic, fun, blissful half-hours of television I have ever experienced, with one of the most satisfying endings of any of the shows I've followed in many years. At least for lifelong DC fans such as I. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

And though I enjoyed Teen Titans as well (mostly because my daughter LOVED it), I have to end by saying that JL & JLU have been one overwhelmingly appreciated breath of fresh air when every other cartoon on television and on the internet is distractingly caught up more in looking like Robotech/Speed Racer/Akira/Yugyo/Pokemon/Digimon same old, same old, same old, same old...",1159747200,8,1774,4.7752442996742674
2621597,3,B000GYI33Q,"I have to say I'm surprised at the above reviews of JLU? It didn't resemble the original idea of the Justice League series at all?  Original idea:  ""Let's put together all the great vital superheroes and leave off those marginal characters from the Superfriends that nobody really liked?""

Good Idea!

JLU: ""Let's put as many DC heroes together on one show so we don't have to put together good stories and CN will be happy, oh yeah we get to charge the same high price for our DVDs that have less material"".

Bad Idea!

I couldn't even watch all the episodes?  I'm sorry, the Supergirl/Booster Gold/? market isn't too large... you can have some of these characters who are relevent in the DC universe:

Supergirl, Green Arrow, Fate, Aquaman, Hawkman, Heroes who might actually have their comic???  If they'd just written better stories, I definitely would have gone over to the 'darkside'.  The 3rd season is absolutely terrible, sans a couple of episodes.  They started to get things together in the fourth season, where we really see the Cadmus arch.  They didn't even know what they were putting together early on, don't let the genius that is ""Bruce Timm"" fool you....The 3rd season will be a great Gift for my friends' 4yr old son, but I won't be buying it for myself.  If they come down at all on the price of s#4 I'll consider it, 13epds for 35.00? Are you kidding me?",1158883200,3,1376,4.613168724279835
2621598,1,B000GYI33Q,justice league may be popular but it was not as popular as the batman animated series or superman animated series their are just to many superheros and villians for a 30 minute show besides i never like this show the way they treat superman and batman is terrible stick with the superman or batman animated series avoid this trash.,1158710400,4,331,4.627118644067797
2621599,5,B000GYI33Q,"From the very first scene featuring one of the most beloved comic characters in the DC world (Green Arrow), The most exciting chapters in Justice League began. After the seven heroes encoutered a threat they almost could not defeat alone. In turn, they called upon all those willing to fight for their cause and the League became 'Unlimited'.

Enclosed in this special treat for fans of this show is not one but two whole seasons in the DVD package. These two seasons will leave you astounded with fantastic stories that range from the exciting to the comedic and even some will cause a tear to be shed. The second season is the one that really made all Justice League fans look at these heroes in a whole new light, when a plot is secretly devised by individuals of genius and power. The mission...DESTROY THE JUSTICE LEAGUE! The heroes go through each powerful episode with links to solve the plot which lead up to one of the most climactic battles ever to grace the small screen.

The major perks in this chapter are the apperances of some DC comic heroes many were eagerly hoping to see as well as appearances of characters from the past. Lex Luthor brings one of the most deadliest plots to the front at the very end with a final showdown that will leave fans awestruck. The final episode of the second season 'Epilogue'is by far the greatst story ever to be devised by Bruce Timm, it will surley leave you in tears and amazment as an unbeleivable hidden secret of Batman's past will shape the future for the DC animation universe.

Be prepared for one incredible DVD that you will surley cherish.",1157414400,7,1602,4.594405594405594
