7200243,2,B00XVJ3LKS,"The show is great and I love it BUT the editing on this ""digitally remastered"" version is sloppy and careless with the picture and sound fading out for a second or two and then fading back in during 3 sections of the story where no original commercial interruption was intended. That is just inept on the part of the technician who worked on this version. Yes the picture and sound are of good quality, but there is no excuse for breaking up the flow of the story stopping Tanta Kringle in the middle of her Toymaker to the King speech, or the little penguin Topper acting as a look out for Kris, or the forest wedding scene. These ""blackouts"" spoil the viewing event. I will go back to my old DVD version from many years ago which plays the show properly and still looks quite fine. I definitely would not call this 45th Anniversary version a Collector's Edition.",1454716800,9,864,4.474683544303797

8716736,5,B00XVJ3LKS,Entertaining origin story of Santa Claus. I love that fact that magic beans make the reindeers fly and a talking penguin help Santa find his home in the North Pole. Priceless. It also has this third-reichy vibe that is very befitting of our times as the Meister-Burger Burger-Meister rules over a miserable medieval looking town keeping the townsfolk poverty stricken and stealing and outlawing all toys.,1525478400,,404,5.136363636363637

First off, my purchase receipt states this item was Sold by: Amazon.com LLC, so, why does this review not then contain the Amazon Verified Purchase tag? Generally, when this happens, I just delete the review, but the product details offered here for this Collectors Edition are pretty sparse. Here are some random observations;

* Originally premiered on ABC the evening of December 14, 1970, Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town was produced by Rankin/Bass, the same folks behind the animated TV classic Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.

* It was created in Animagic _ a Japanese form of stop motion using wood & plastic characters _ and starred the voice talents of Fred Astaire (narrator S.D. Kluger), Mickey Rooney (Kris Kringle), and Keenan Wynn (Winter Warlock).

* The insert to this 45th Anniversary singledisc DVD release provides no actual aspect ratio, though the video presentation is letterboxed on each side providing what appears to be a 1.33:1 (4.3) Fullscreen aspect ratio.

SPECIAL FEATURES
01. NEW! Be An Artist & Create  Learn to draw Santa and Toppa the Penguin from a professional animator. Plus, craft activity for the whole family.

02. NEW! Kringle Jingle  Sing along to one of the most famous and beloved holiday songs, Santa Claus id Comin to Town.

03. NEW! Santa Special Delivery  Delightful letters are opened to deliver 45 jolly notes about Santa and what makes the holiday so special.

* These extras were unsatisfying for a 45th Anniversary presentation. Basically, you get an artist sketching on a pad, two people making a paper Christmas chain, a singalong, and 45 trivia notes popping out of a stationary sleigh. Personally, a youngster when this animated classic first aired, I was hoping for more than just a very basic unrefurbished Fullscreen release. The following information is from the DVD insert(s), while the Audio SetUp on the actual disc offers a choice of English 5.1 Dolby and Spanish 2.0 Dolby.
