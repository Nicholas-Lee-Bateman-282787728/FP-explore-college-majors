3522219,5,B001D25LTE,"Corner Gas, Season 5, is an excellent season of programs.  The Canadian comedy series is just as fresh in Season 5 as it was in the first season, and the characters and actors are still first rate, as is the writing.  If you don't have this season of Corner Gas, you should get it.  As for the advertising for this product by Amazon, however, it was poor and very misleading: I have all the other seasons already, and I also had Season 5 (which I forgot--yes, mea culpa); then I received an e-mail from Amazon saying that Season 5 of Corner Gas was about to be issued, and I could pre-order it; I didn't pre-order, but I ordered it on the day it was released by Amazon.  I received it a few days later and popped it into the DVD player.  To my dismay, the first episode was all too familiar, and I soon realized that I had already purchased Season 5 one year before, from Amazon!  Yes, I should have been more careful; however, Amazon certainly should not have promoted this product, falsely, as being new!  I sent it back and received only a partial refund because I had opened the DVD.  While caveat emptor prevails at most places, I always thought--and had good reason to believe--that Amazon.com was different.  I will still buy from Amazon, of course, but this experience was not a good one.",1253836800,,1296,4.434599156118144

Corner Gas is my new go to comedies, used to be Marx Brothers, which I still do watch, but their movies are too long for a short fix for when I need a distraction from some of life's too ugly to deal with or too stressful to deal with. Like getting up from your desk and doing something totally different such as walking around the building or just cleaning out your desk to relax the tension.

This is a Canadian T.V. sitcom created by Canadian comedian Brent Butt.  (Yes! Thats his real name.)  The series ran for six seasons from Jan 22, 2004 to April 13, 2009 for a total of 107 episodes.

Deriving its name from the roadside gas station in the fictional, small (very small!) town of Dog River, Saskatchewan, Canada, Corner Gas is the only gas station within 37 miles (60 km) in any direction.

The characters of this small town are quirky:

Brent Leroy (Brent Butt) is the proprietor of the gas station.  His parents, Oscar (Eric Peterson) whose favorite word is jackass and Emma (Janet Wright) are life-time residents of Dog River.

Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) works at the stations convenience store as a retail assistant.

An adjoining cafe, The Ruby, is owned by Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller), who inherited it from her Aunt Ruby.

Dog Rivers Police Department (the DRPD) consists entirely of veteran Davis Quinton (Lorne Cardinal) and rookie Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn).

Brents best friend, the perpetually unemployed Hank Yarbo (Fred Ewanuick), spends his time hanging out with Dog River residents or drinking coffee at the Ruby.

A number of notable Canadian celebrities and politicians appear as guest stars or have cameo roles in many episodes.

Most of the episodes are stand-alone and can be viewed in any order.

This very funny show, which was filmed entirely in Saskatchewan, became an instant hit, averaging a million viewers per episode.  In Saskatchewan, April 13 is known as Corner Gas Day.  This show is presently televised in 26 countries.

I found that season five of Corner Gas retained its quirky characters and that all episodes retained the humour Ive come to expect.  In fact, most episodes are hilarious.  Kiefer Sutherland has a cameo in one of the episodes.

Finally, there are three extras: bloopers, a theme song music video, and character mash-ups (short best of montages of each character).

In conclusion, the fifth season of the hit comedy Corner Gas presents episodes in the life of a small town where theres not a lot goin on.

Warning!!  Once you become addicted to this series, you officially become a Butt head.

(2007 to 2008;  19 episodes on 3 discs;  22 min per episode; total time: 420 min or 7 hrs;  wide screen)

Season 5 continues the tradition of being laugh-out-loud funny. The characters remain as quirky as ever, the humor witty and clean.
