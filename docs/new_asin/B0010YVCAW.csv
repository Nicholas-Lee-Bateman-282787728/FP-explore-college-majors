Typical for Tyler Perry's plays, it had wonderful messages and we all had a lot to talk about for the week.

As a black, educated, talented single mother, I hate to say it but these stereotypes DO EXIST.  I've encountered them in the work place-- in one department.  I would like to see Tyler Perry focus on classy and educated women.  All of that aside, I was able to see that he put focus on health (STDs, colonoscopy, & mammograms)as well as FAITH AND TRUSTING JESUS.  I would be remiss to leave out the fact that some performances where painful and bumpy but in spite of that those issues were irrelevant to me.  Instead of focusing on what's 'bad' about the play, focus on the TRUE MESSAGE.",1365897600,2,778,4.81203007518797

3056471,2,B0010YVCAW,"I love Tyler Perry's work and finally broke down to buy this video last week-end.

What I liked:
Mr. Brown was OVER THE TOP!  I laughed so hard at some of the scenes I had trouble going to sleep that evening.  I mean crazy laughing.  ""Doc, you really need to make something of yourself.""
Christian Keyes (is he for real???) and Brian Gentiles are...how shall I put it?  Great to observe (of course, I mean their ACTING talents!)
The young nurse (sorry, I can't remember her name) and the older nurse (whose son played basketball) and Tamela Mann were all good, too.

What I couldn't stand (and why I won't share the movie with my family):
D'atra Hicks' character was terrible.  Her hair, costuming, etc. were unfavorable, to put it mildly.  Her silly, loud and obnoxious style were uncomfortable to watch.  (What a difference from her skills in Madea's Family Reunion!?) Her chasing of the doctor was degrading and again, really hard to watch.  (That couple was 100% unbelievable.  There's NO WAY a fine, nice, successful doctor would take that type of woman anywhere -- not even for coffee.  Sorry.)  I agree with another reviewer, this is not typical of Tyler Perry's style.  It is more typical of those low-budget plays (I would never go see.)  Sorry, D'atra, but this one was not good (and I'm trying not to be too hard on you.)

I also had a problem with all of the story lines going on that didn't make sense.  The high schooler going into the NBA after being shot, the overt affair going on & the wife's attitude, the cheating wife whose husband takes her right back, etc. -- it just didn't work for me.

Also, I'm not trying to be mean, but 90% of the women are extremely over weight in the play.  That's a negative health issue in itself.  The women are all pretty, but unhealthy.  What message does that send?

Overall, I'll probably keep the movie (I'll watch the Mr. Brown scenes when I need a pick-me-up!) but I hope the next play (and I enjoy his plays more than any other thing he does.  I've never been to them personally, but I love them (and I DON'T buy boot leg anything!)

P.S. One of my all-time favorite movies (of all-time but didn't I already say that?) is: Madea Goes to Jail (stage play.) LOVE IT! (Play versions of Madea's Family Reunion and I Can Do Bad All By Myself coming in right after.)

Hope this is helpful.",1228953600,,2342,4.479905437352246

3056474,2,B0010YVCAW,"The ONLY reason to see this play is because of Mr. Brown. (Okay, and maybe the cute doctor.)

Three reasons I didn't like What's Done in the Dark: The health infomercial preaching, partially recycled script, and Nurse Trudy.

I get it! I get it! Diabetes, AIDS, STDs, cancer, heart problems, and high blood pressure=bad. Early check-ups, eating right, exercise=good. But I didn't tune in for the heavy-handed health sermon that saturated the whole play and made me roll my eyes and say, ""Ah. Here we go again!"" It's the same reaction the character Mike had in Perry's movie Why Did I Get Married when Perry's character Terry started spouting the stats on AIDS/HIV cases. It's so blatant that it takes you out of the movie/play, though well-meaning it may seem. Subtlety is thy friend! I know this play was set in a hospital, but that doesn't excuse the over-the-top health sermonizing.

Then there was the partially recycled plot. I don't know which came first, but those of us who saw the movie Meet the Browns will recognize Brenda's storyline. It was like watching a rerun.

Finally, there's Nurse Trudy. I've not seen D'atra Hicks in anything else, and maybe she's a good actress; but not here. It was overacting to the extreme. The growling and yelling just made no sense to me. Latrice Pace was a much better actress and was funny and realistic with a much more subdued performance.

As always, though, David Mann's Mr. Brown saved this Madea-less play. Tamala Mann and a few of the others who have been with Perry for some time showed that they had grown as performers and were quite good. Perhaps Hicks and some of the other first-timers will get there. For now, Mr. Brown was the funniest of the crew and saved this play from being a one-star performance (or no star, if I could do that). He also does a fantastic job in the bonus features, especially the final interview.",1219968000,,1881,4.6878787878787875

And at times some of the dialogue used was not original.  Overall great.  Fan of Tyler Perry an dhis people and will be for time to come.,1219881600,,273,4.4
3056476,4,B0010YVCAW,This is another in a long line of witty and carefully crafted plays from Tyler Perry. His comedic genius is interlaced with the morals and values that have been absent from our modern media. It's a welcome addition to any library!,1219708800,,230,4.634146341463414

3056479,3,B0010YVCAW,"As a huge Tyler Perry fan I wanted to enjoy this play much more than I did.  Brown is always funny and is the reason I gave it 3 stars, without him it would have only been 3 stars.  The characters and the storylines where not well thought out, or acted well.  Too many stories going on and none of them seemed to make a great deal of sense to the overall story.  There also were too many instances where things were just unbelievable.  A married man who has caught VD from his cheating wife does not immediately kiss and make up.  A high school basketball player does not go from getting shot to signing with the NBA straight from the hospital.  The overly suggestive nurse does not in the end get the Dr. most men like to chase not be chased, and finally the cheating chief Dr. and his wife were just plain obnoxious, annoying and totally unbelievable.  All in all if it were not for Brown and his antics this wouldn't even be worth watching.",1212451200,,943,4.288135593220339
3056480,2,B0010YVCAW,"I felt obligated to write a good review about this play since I am very much a Tyler Perry fan but I truly just did not like this play. If it was really about health disparities, I think he should have emphasized it more. I mean, he made me happy by putting Christian Keyes, Ryan Gentles and svelte Terrell Carter in the play but other than them and of course, David and Tamela Mann, everything else fell short. I think I mostly did not like D'Atra Hicks' performance because it was just too much. What man who got a medical degree from Yale would be interested in a woman so CRAZY! And she was so demure in Family Reunion that I was shocked this was the same woman. Her character was just tooo crazy. The plot seemed rushed and points were not focused upon long enough to make them stick.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVED ""Why did I get Married,"" the movie. It is probably Tyler's best work but when he brings movies out too quickly after the other, he falters. For instance, compare Family Reunion and Daddy's Little Girls. Also, Why Did I Get Married and Meet the Browns (he really should not have cast Rick Fox in that movie at all--terrible move). I hope he realizes this; when his movies come out too quickly after another, one pales in comparison and quality suffers. I truly hope he realizes this and takes time to write and produce his plays and movies so that the Tyler Perry can remain above the standard.",1211932800,5,1423,4.390151515151516
3056481,3,B0010YVCAW,I have to be honest this play was long there were some funny parts here and there. I feel asleep and when I woke up I saw Mr. Brown and Cora had came into the picture and thats when it was really funny. Mr. Brown and Cora made the movie. I really believe Tyler Perry movies and plays are better when he is in them just like for instance when House of Payne first started it wasn't really that good (it has improved) but when Madea was on there like one or two epsidoes it was really good. I love Tyler Perry and will always support his movies and plays so if you feel the same way you should buy this DVD.,1209513600,,605,3.9672131147540983

3056485,4,B0010YVCAW,"It begins slow, but becomes hilarious when Brown enters. One character who plays a nurse is over dramatic and acts too silly when the new doctor arrives. She has dated the doctor before in college and have three children, but she acts like a teenager. Brown brings a lot of laughter to the show.",1207526400,,295,4.481481481481482
3056486,1,B0010YVCAW,"Wow this was a terrible play !! I agree with what another reviewer said about the portrayal of black women in this play.  They were loud, gossipy, ignorant at times, and just plain messy.  D'Atra Hicks (Jackie from the Family Reunion play) was in this.  She was so strong and reserved and classy in Family Reunion, but I could barely watch her here.  She looked terrible and she was loud and obnoxious.  And maybe this was how Tyler wanted her charachter portrayed, but it only lends to my belief that black women were portrayed in a negative light.

I stopped the DVD at about 15 minutes at first, and then I restarted it and just fast-forwarded through the moments D'atra Hicks was on stage.

All-in-all I just hated this play.",1207353600,4,729,4.561538461538461

3056488,3,B0010YVCAW,"I love (and laugh with) Tyler Perry's work.  I thought this production was a bit uneven, although the principles ""taught"" are very worthwhile.  And of course, Mr Brown's misspeak is always a hoot.  I would give it a B-, and would recommend it to anyone already familiar with TP works.  If this had been the first I had seen, well, I would maybe or maybe not have made a point of seeing other DVDs. As it was, I purchased this on the strength of what I had perviously enjoyed.",1206403200,,475,4.303370786516854
3056489,3,B0010YVCAW,"In typical Tyler Perry fashion, this production has humor, love, and hard hitting topics.  This latest production does not seem up to Mr. Perry's par.  It tries too hard to establish relationships and forces the humor. The music seemed contrived and placed as opposed to the scenes flowing into the songs with pertinent lyrics. It was enjoyable, but not nearly as good as his earlier productions.",1206230400,,396,4.984848484848484

But Mr. Brown is the one that definitely steals the show!  This play turned out to be a lot more entertaining than I thought it would be.  I love how it has important, spiritual messages.  But not too much to where it's a church sermon.  I rented this video first, but I am definitely going to buy it!!",1205452800,,463,4.193181818181818

3056496,1,B0010YVCAW,"The only things that saved this play were Ryan Gentiles taking his shirt off again (lord have mercy there oughta be a law) and of course, the stellar performance from Tamala Mann.  She always brings the house down and her singing just lifts your spirit every time.  David Mann is usually a riot but he, as well as the other Tyler Perry veterans we've all grown to love, had a challenge - the newer actors were very much lacking in skills...in fact they were terrible. One just kept screaming and overacting...I kept forwarding whenever she came back on the set because she wasn't funny and the screaming was nerve wracking.  I think that Tyler may be trying to do too many things at once or perhaps he is being too nice trying to give breaks to 'c' or 'd' actors.  He is a big hit, we love him.  He needs to ensure that he continues to produce quality film, theatre and tv shows.  I saw the movie ""Why Did I Get Married"", then brought the cd and my family and I have watched it about two or three times because it was so good.  I am looking forward to the movie ""Meet the Browns"".  But I am very disappointed in ""What's Done in the Dark.""  Very.",1205107200,13,1145,4.263888888888889

3056502,2,B0010YVCAW,"I purchased this movie on DVD with high expectation from Mr. Perry.  The only good parts of this play were when Mr. Brown came to the hospital.  The nurse with the crazy speaking was totally ridiculous to me, I was so annoyed with that. Unfortunately not everybody can pull off stage plays and the woman that did the young man's mother, didn't do too well as far as I was concerned.

Lastly, there was no Madea.  What is up with that?

TP takes a comical approach to addressing some serious health concerns within the high blood pressure, diabetes, VD, the need for black MEN to get check-up regularly. All though it's comical you will get the message. I'm going to see the Marriage Counselor next month and I can't wait. I love TP's plays and movies. The DVD has a featurette called Mr Brown goes shopping and he interviews the cast. You have to wait it, he is just TOO much!!",1203379200,7,566,4.4
3056508,1,B0010YVCAW,"This play was very disappointing to me.  As a black woman, I am offended at the perception of black women at this point in his plays. I have bought his plays in the past to support him in hopes of better character development of the women.  If what was displayed in this play is how he views women and the type of interaction he incurs, that is a sad circle.  I have met plenty of women from various scopes of life and have never encountered a woman acting so desperate for a man.  The more I watch of his plays, the more I feel he has put black women in the ""stereotypical"" role this society has already placed on us.  This play is as predictable as the previous plays. Please no more lines from ""The Color Purple.""  A little comedy goes a long way.",1203206400,8,750,4.173611111111111

As a black, educated, talented single mother, I hate to say it but these stereotypes DO EXIST.  I've encountered them in the work place-- in one department.  I would like to see Tyler Perry focus on classy and educated women.  All of that aside, I was able to see that he put focus on health (STDs, colonoscopy, & mammograms)as well as FAITH AND TRUSTING JESUS.  I would be remiss to leave out the fact that some performances where painful and bumpy but in spite of that those issues were irrelevant to me.  Instead of focusing on what's 'bad' about the play, focus on the TRUE MESSAGE.",1365897600,2,778,4.81203007518797

3290968,2,B0010YVCAW,"I love Tyler Perry's work and finally broke down to buy this video last week-end.

What I liked:
Mr. Brown was OVER THE TOP!  I laughed so hard at some of the scenes I had trouble going to sleep that evening.  I mean crazy laughing.  ""Doc, you really need to make something of yourself.""
Christian Keyes (is he for real???) and Brian Gentiles are...how shall I put it?  Great to observe (of course, I mean their ACTING talents!)
The young nurse (sorry, I can't remember her name) and the older nurse (whose son played basketball) and Tamela Mann were all good, too.

What I couldn't stand (and why I won't share the movie with my family):
D'atra Hicks' character was terrible.  Her hair, costuming, etc. were unfavorable, to put it mildly.  Her silly, loud and obnoxious style were uncomfortable to watch.  (What a difference from her skills in Madea's Family Reunion!?) Her chasing of the doctor was degrading and again, really hard to watch.  (That couple was 100% unbelievable.  There's NO WAY a fine, nice, successful doctor would take that type of woman anywhere -- not even for coffee.  Sorry.)  I agree with another reviewer, this is not typical of Tyler Perry's style.  It is more typical of those low-budget plays (I would never go see.)  Sorry, D'atra, but this one was not good (and I'm trying not to be too hard on you.)

I also had a problem with all of the story lines going on that didn't make sense.  The high schooler going into the NBA after being shot, the overt affair going on & the wife's attitude, the cheating wife whose husband takes her right back, etc. -- it just didn't work for me.

Also, I'm not trying to be mean, but 90% of the women are extremely over weight in the play.  That's a negative health issue in itself.  The women are all pretty, but unhealthy.  What message does that send?

Overall, I'll probably keep the movie (I'll watch the Mr. Brown scenes when I need a pick-me-up!) but I hope the next play (and I enjoy his plays more than any other thing he does.  I've never been to them personally, but I love them (and I DON'T buy boot leg anything!)

P.S. One of my all-time favorite movies (of all-time but didn't I already say that?) is: Madea Goes to Jail (stage play.) LOVE IT! (Play versions of Madea's Family Reunion and I Can Do Bad All By Myself coming in right after.)

3290971,2,B0010YVCAW,"The ONLY reason to see this play is because of Mr. Brown. (Okay, and maybe the cute doctor.)

Three reasons I didn't like What's Done in the Dark: The health infomercial preaching, partially recycled script, and Nurse Trudy.

I get it! I get it! Diabetes, AIDS, STDs, cancer, heart problems, and high blood pressure=bad. Early check-ups, eating right, exercise=good. But I didn't tune in for the heavy-handed health sermon that saturated the whole play and made me roll my eyes and say, ""Ah. Here we go again!"" It's the same reaction the character Mike had in Perry's movie Why Did I Get Married when Perry's character Terry started spouting the stats on AIDS/HIV cases. It's so blatant that it takes you out of the movie/play, though well-meaning it may seem. Subtlety is thy friend! I know this play was set in a hospital, but that doesn't excuse the over-the-top health sermonizing.

Then there was the partially recycled plot. I don't know which came first, but those of us who saw the movie Meet the Browns will recognize Brenda's storyline. It was like watching a rerun.

Finally, there's Nurse Trudy. I've not seen D'atra Hicks in anything else, and maybe she's a good actress; but not here. It was overacting to the extreme. The growling and yelling just made no sense to me. Latrice Pace was a much better actress and was funny and realistic with a much more subdued performance.

As always, though, David Mann's Mr. Brown saved this Madea-less play. Tamala Mann and a few of the others who have been with Perry for some time showed that they had grown as performers and were quite good. Perhaps Hicks and some of the other first-timers will get there. For now, Mr. Brown was the funniest of the crew and saved this play from being a one-star performance (or no star, if I could do that). He also does a fantastic job in the bonus features, especially the final interview.",1219968000,,1881,4.6878787878787875
3290972,4,B0010YVCAW,Awesome play but you really don't expect less from Tyler Perry.  Great cast although some of the acting seemed a little over dramatic.  And at times some of the dialogue used was not original.  Overall great.  Fan of Tyler Perry an dhis people and will be for time to come.,1219881600,,273,4.4
3290973,4,B0010YVCAW,This is another in a long line of witty and carefully crafted plays from Tyler Perry. His comedic genius is interlaced with the morals and values that have been absent from our modern media. It's a welcome addition to any library!,1219708800,,230,4.634146341463414

3290976,3,B0010YVCAW,"As a huge Tyler Perry fan I wanted to enjoy this play much more than I did.  Brown is always funny and is the reason I gave it 3 stars, without him it would have only been 3 stars.  The characters and the storylines where not well thought out, or acted well.  Too many stories going on and none of them seemed to make a great deal of sense to the overall story.  There also were too many instances where things were just unbelievable.  A married man who has caught VD from his cheating wife does not immediately kiss and make up.  A high school basketball player does not go from getting shot to signing with the NBA straight from the hospital.  The overly suggestive nurse does not in the end get the Dr. most men like to chase not be chased, and finally the cheating chief Dr. and his wife were just plain obnoxious, annoying and totally unbelievable.  All in all if it were not for Brown and his antics this wouldn't even be worth watching.",1212451200,,943,4.288135593220339
3290977,2,B0010YVCAW,"I felt obligated to write a good review about this play since I am very much a Tyler Perry fan but I truly just did not like this play. If it was really about health disparities, I think he should have emphasized it more. I mean, he made me happy by putting Christian Keyes, Ryan Gentles and svelte Terrell Carter in the play but other than them and of course, David and Tamela Mann, everything else fell short. I think I mostly did not like D'Atra Hicks' performance because it was just too much. What man who got a medical degree from Yale would be interested in a woman so CRAZY! And she was so demure in Family Reunion that I was shocked this was the same woman. Her character was just tooo crazy. The plot seemed rushed and points were not focused upon long enough to make them stick.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVED ""Why did I get Married,"" the movie. It is probably Tyler's best work but when he brings movies out too quickly after the other, he falters. For instance, compare Family Reunion and Daddy's Little Girls. Also, Why Did I Get Married and Meet the Browns (he really should not have cast Rick Fox in that movie at all--terrible move). I hope he realizes this; when his movies come out too quickly after another, one pales in comparison and quality suffers. I truly hope he realizes this and takes time to write and produce his plays and movies so that the Tyler Perry can remain above the standard.",1211932800,5,1423,4.390151515151516

I feel asleep and when I woke up I saw Mr. Brown and Cora had came into the picture and thats when it was really funny. Mr. Brown and Cora made the movie. I really believe Tyler Perry movies and plays are better when he is in them just like for instance when House of Payne first started it wasn't really that good (it has improved) but when Madea was on there like one or two epsidoes it was really good.

They were loud, gossipy, ignorant at times, and just plain messy.  D'Atra Hicks (Jackie from the Family Reunion play) was in this.  She was so strong and reserved and classy in Family Reunion, but I could barely watch her here.  She looked terrible and she was loud and obnoxious.  And maybe this was how Tyler wanted her charachter portrayed, but it only lends to my belief that black women were portrayed in a negative light.

I stopped the DVD at about 15 minutes at first, and then I restarted it and just fast-forwarded through the moments D'atra Hicks was on stage.

She always brings the house down and her singing just lifts your spirit every time.  David Mann is usually a riot but he, as well as the other Tyler Perry veterans we've all grown to love, had a challenge - the newer actors were very much lacking in skills...in fact they were terrible. One just kept screaming and overacting...I kept forwarding whenever she came back on the set because she wasn't funny and the screaming was nerve wracking.  I think that Tyler may be trying to do too many things at once or perhaps he is being too nice trying to give breaks to 'c' or 'd' actors.  He is a big hit, we love him.  He needs to ensure that he continues to produce quality film, theatre and tv shows.  I saw the movie ""Why Did I Get Married"", then brought the cd and my family and I have watched it about two or three times because it was so good.

3291003,5,B0010YVCAW,"this is a great play. Once again, Mr. Tyler Perry has done it again!!! It really emphasizes on real relationship and how GOD is working through each and every situation. GOD is the alpha and the omega (the beginning and the end).",1204502400,,229,4.476190476190476
3291004,5,B0010YVCAW,"It has been a LONG time since I've laughed this hard. Mr. Brown was at his BEST I laughed until I had a headache, literally. TP takes a comical approach to addressing some serious health concerns within the high blood pressure, diabetes, VD, the need for black MEN to get check-up regularly. All though it's comical you will get the message. I'm going to see the Marriage Counselor next month and I can't wait. I love TP's plays and movies. The DVD has a featurette called Mr Brown goes shopping and he interviews the cast. You have to wait it, he is just TOO much!!",1203379200,7,566,4.4
3291005,1,B0010YVCAW,"This play was very disappointing to me.  As a black woman, I am offended at the perception of black women at this point in his plays. I have bought his plays in the past to support him in hopes of better character development of the women.  If what was displayed in this play is how he views women and the type of interaction he incurs, that is a sad circle.  I have met plenty of women from various scopes of life and have never encountered a woman acting so desperate for a man.  The more I watch of his plays, the more I feel he has put black women in the ""stereotypical"" role this society has already placed on us.  This play is as predictable as the previous plays. Please no more lines from ""The Color Purple.""  A little comedy goes a long way.",1203206400,8,750,4.173611111111111
3291006,5,B0010YVCAW,"I SAW THIS PLAY WHEN IT CAME TO CHARLOTTE,NC'S OVENS AUDITORIUM.  IT WAS HILARIOUS AND BOY DID I LAUGH SO HARD.  I LOVED THE SINGING AS ALWAYS AND DESPITE MADEA NO BEING IN THIS ONE, BROWN MADE IT HAPPEN.  MY GIRLFRIENDS AND I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TYLER GOES BACK ON THE ROAD AND PUTS OUT ANOTHER PLAY. KUDOS TO THE CAST BECAUSE THEY REALLY PUT IT DOWN.  I ALMOST WET MY PANTS DURING THE SCENE WHEN BROWN GOES TO THE MD'S OFFICE (I WON'T GIVE IT AWAY, BUT GO TO THE BATHROOM FIRST!) THIS IS A GREAT BUY.  I HAVE BOUGHT 5 FOR FAM AND FRIENDS. LOL

3291007,5,B0010YVCAW,"When it came to Memphis in 2006, my play sister and I went to see it. Because the people sitting right behind us (a couple of course) talked and argued just about the whole play, we couldn't hardly hear and had just lost interest in the play. I ordered the play last week and got it yesterday. I went home and watched it and laughed sooooooo hard and got the many messages Tyler Perry wants us to get from it. It's enlightening and funny. This won't be a waste of your money. I can't wait to share and watch it with my family this weekend.",1202947200,5,539,4.142857142857143
