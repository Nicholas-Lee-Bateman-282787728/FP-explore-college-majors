296515,5,6300276554,"It's a shame that Walt spent so much of his energy making bold leaps forward when the current incarnation of his company spends so much of it making bold setbacks.

  Disney, the corporation, has seen it fit to erase portions from our history books, as witnessed with Pocahontas, and deprive children of all ages an imaginative and entertaining document of our past. And for what?  In hopes of forgetting a disgraceful moment in our countrys collective past?  Ironic that they would appear to be halting relations rather than continuing to improve them.  This is an intelligent look at conflicts that existed within our nation long ago and should be made available to the public for its immense importance on social class during a time when our nation was just getting its legs and figuring out who we were and who we wanted to become.  The Song of the South, is an honest representation of a time and place.  The movie is handled with delightful alacrity towards its subject matter and possesses a charm unmatched by anything the company has released in it's new age.

  Children are often better judges than we, as witnessed in the movie.  So, do as Walt did and let us all be your audience, once again, Disney, and not just wrongly embarrassed old fools.  But, for the time being, I ask you, stay out of my local library, please.  I wouldn't want you erasing away their editions of, Mark Twain, or, Harriet Beecher Stowe.",1010448000,127,1424,4.689516129032258

From my childhood I remember this wonderful story and the fabulous songs that I still hum today...We live in a world of multicultures and multihistories....The Story should be viewed as such and Disney should get over themselves about offending anyone. If anything this heartfelt movie depicts good, wisdom, humor and down right happiness.  How about fabulous story telling....who does that today.. Wouldn't you want your children to be exposed to that instead of all the blowing up, vulgur language crap being shoved at our youth today.

296560,5,6300276554,"I have asked this question many times, why ""Song of the South""
has not been released.  It was brought to my attention that it has
nothing to do with the Disney Company at all! Due to the ""sensitive"" contents of the movie (racial), Disney is not allowed to release this movie in this country.  Disney has been
fighting this decision for over 20 years.  I also got around this
by getting a copy off eBay.  I disagree completely with the reaction of the authorities who think it shouldn't be shown here.
I think it was beautifully done without getting into the messy side
of slavery. Disney also had done a biography about the author of
the Uncle Remus stories, Joel Chandler Harris, which I saw as a child and still remember. Perhaps that has more to do with this
problem than the subject matter.",1280448000,2,794,4.493055555555555
296561,5,6300276554,"Walt Disney did not decide to stop making it: the NAACP threw a fit because Uncle Remus was a willing slave, so it was banned from USA marketing.  The film is still being circulated, copied and sold new in Europe!  If not available on Amazon, try eBay.  Some of the sellers are passing on their copies of it in USA's VHS form.  The European PAL versions do not play on most of our VHS players, but a good video conversion service can make it into a version that will play on all USA players.  That's how I got our VHS copy of the movie.  The film quality is not very good, but the show is still enjoyable.  I agree it is a part of history, a story about how pure hearts can love one another, and shows that the slaves were kind and smart and loving.  Yet the film industry is still allowed to make movies showing blacks being beaten and tortured in the 40's and 50's, which I think is sickening and harmful.  Song of the South took place in the 19th century, when the slaves were free but emotionally attached to their plantation homes.  Makes NO sense that this lovely film was banned.  My Dad used to tell us Uncle Remus stories when I grew up in the 50's, and we loved them.  It never occurred to us to be prejudiced.",1268438400,2,1220,4.1888412017167385

I am a grandmother trying to show my grandsons what wonderful songs came out of such great movies produced by Disney.  All I know is that Disney should re-release such awsome movies so that future generations can admire and enjoy what they're parents grew up with.  I have most, if not all, of the sing along songs made by Disney on VHS and I would like them on DVD.  My children are successful in their careers and by no means did these movies do them any harm.  It taught them to enjoy beautiful music.  I agree with Mr. Willert, there are alot of unappropriate movies out there that should be banned but it seems that the most innocent, patriotic, no violence, no sex and certainly spiritual movies are the ones that are criticize the most.  And us as consumers, a majority, don't have a leg to stand on because of all the politically correct people, a minority, who have the power to decide what we should hear, see and believe.  So please go ahead and re-release all the sing along songs on DVD and believe me you'll have a alot of devoted customers for life (including me).",1156464000,9,1161,4.413145539906103
296564,5,6300276554,"If it is required that a movie show respect to people of any color then why not also ban every movie that has ever shown white people in a bad light?

This movie shows how it really was at one time in our history, it does not say it was right or wrong.  If we hide all of these examples of how things shouldn't have been will African Americans quit bitching about how things were - at some time in the future no white will know what you're talking about if you hide it well enough.",1124668800,23,481,4.0
296565,5,6300276554,"This may be volume two of the Disney Sing Alongs collection in the US, but it was the first one released in the UK where I bought it. It was a Christmas present and I was so excited to get it. In truth, I wanted it to see the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo sequence from Cinderella and wasn't bothered about Zip A Dee Doo Dah, but I enjoyed that too. This video also featured rarer songs such as Mickey Mouse Club March, It's A Small World and The Ballad Of Davy Crockett. Other songs included were Following The Leader from Peter Pan (released several times on different sing along songs videos), The Unbirthday Song from Alice In Wonderland, Casy Junior from Dumbo and Whistle While You Work from Snow White.

The real highlight though was Zip A Dee Doo Dah and the unadvertised Song Of The South from SONG OF THE SOUTH. And here's my sidenote: Now in America, there seems to be some issues regarding the release of the film Song Of The South because of its slavery connotations. In fact, the movie is set after the slavery period. However Michael Eisner as head of The Walt Disney Company has chosen not to release it in case it could fuel racial hatred. Obviously for fans of Song Of The South, that seems ridiculous, but what fans don't know is that Disney have received protests from some celebrities who say they will seriously make some noise if Song Of The South is ever released. By the way, Song Of The South was available on video in the UK years ago- no riots! (And if you really wanna get a copy pirate versions are available in New York) There is a light at the end of the tunnel though- there is a rumor that Disney will release Song Of The South in 2005 or 2006- fingers crossed. They should just get Leonard Maltin to do an introduction about Song Of The South in its historical context. You know what, I think everyone should get over themselves. Song Of The South is a family film after all.

Back to the review. This is one of the more special sing along videos since it really set the bar. Just ignore the Song Of The South argument. You and your kinds will really enjoy this early Disney Sing Along Songs video sensation.",1123718400,18,2133,4.370277078085643
296566,5,6300276554,"This is how I got around the donkey heads at Disney:  I went on eBay and bought a Laserdisc Japanese import of ""Song of the South"".  One audio track is in English and the other is Japanese.  I used a little mono to stereo audio splitter (from Radio Shack) to change the one English channel into a left-right stereo mix.  Then I recorded the movie onto a DVD burner.  Viola!!  I now have a DVD of the ORIGINAL ""Song of the South"".  It's fantastic!  And, yes, the people at Dinsey are flippin' idiots!!  Uncle Remus is the hero of the movie - and an infinitley better role model for black youth today than any of the drug, violence and sex crazed icons in our current culture.

By the way, I also used this Laserdisc-to-DVD burner method to get around other Disney fiascos, such as the ""remastering"" of Fantasia and Bambi.  Try it. It's all digital-to-digital, so the quality is perfect. ""Song of the South"" Laserdiscs are a little pricey, but the others are real cheap.  Just be sure you get the oldest ones possible - before Disney started messing with them.

Isn't it great when you find a way to beat the politically correct?",1122508800,25,1127,4.465686274509804
296597,3,6300276554,"I've glanced at all of the rants and raves on how this movie should be released, and I must state my point of view of why this movie should NOT be released again:

What people must understand is that this film in no way gives an ounce of warmth and pride to someone who is of African descent.  Uncle Remus is clearly an Uncle Tom-like character, and is NOT an image that is to be thought of as positive, except for his humble type of behavior.  But a positive image must also have elements of pride and self-worth. Uncle Remus has none of these, and lives only to please his white counterparts.

Did you know that James Baskett, the actor who played Uncle Remus, prior to this starred in ""Amos and Andy"" skits and also did numbers with the stereotypical tap dancer Bojangles? These are both very offensive racial entities.  Looking at his history, you can see that this man was used to playing in films that re-emphasized the then disrespective image of an African-American, and is giving the ""Uncle Remus"" role the same treatment.

I am glad that Disney has banned this movie.  It is showing progress in their company to respect the civil rights of every color.  If you think about it, all the Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry cartoons that were racially offensive have been either edited to not show racial depictions or banned completely.  And this is to show respect to African-Americans and other minorities that have been discriminated against every time one of these cartoons or movies are shown. It's a step in progress, people.  Please show respect and honor that.",1118016000,6,1571,4.6389891696750905

296600,5,6300276554,"I grew up in the south, North Carolina, and remember the radio program, ""Uncle Remus"".  I loved that program!  Yes, I'm 'white' (I truly hate that I have to clarify this to make my point).  At that early age I had no thoughts one way or the other as to race, color, or creed.  All I knew was that I loved the warmth of this man and his stories.  Later on when I was older and saw the movie ""Song Of The South"" it only reinforced my affection for Uncle Remus. I have for years now tried to get a copy of this movie and am continuously told that it has not been released by Disney.  What in the world is going on?!?!  With all the 'garbage' that is out there why has this movie not been released to counteract some of it.  In my opinion this movie would do so much to educate our children to not only the plight of the slaves but to the ability of a these remarkable people to come through it with such love and caring.  I would much rather my children see this movie than a lot of the 'commercial' gargabe that is flooding the market just to make a buck!!!  Come on! Walt can only be appalled at the fact that this movie is withheld and all the other 'stuff' is being released like crazy.  Well, I've had my say.

So why could I buy it in France and why Americans have not the right to do the same in their country ?

Can anyone give me the answer ?

296663,1,6300276554,"What is going on inside those tiny pea brains at Disney (Eisner, that can only mean you). When you compare the great classic SONG OF THE SOUTH to the violence going on in movies, the sex, the vulgarity, the garbage that movie patrons see every year, something is terribly wrong. When Disney thinks they are being politically correct by disowning SONG OF THE SOUTH, remember they were also the studio that brought out PRIEST (about a gay priest), ALADDIN (portraying Arabs as stereotypes), and violent movies like THE PROGRAM, RANSOM, THE ROCK, CON AIR, etc. And what of GONE WITH THE WIND and it's non-brutal treatment of negroes (Scarlett was about the only Southerner who had a problem, and that was only with Mammy and Prissy). And what of BIRTH OF A NATION? The ultimate racist classic of all time. But it is considered a classic, and studied in all film classes (I studied it when I was attending class). Let's face it. When we see the Ku Klux Klan trying to rescue an all-white town from these ape-like (they acted like apes) negroes, and the audience is supposed to cheer, somehow, especially in today's modern age, something is lost in the translation. But neither BIRTH OF A NATION or GONE WITH THE WIND are banned. They've tried to ban 'Huckleberry Finn' from schools, but have always failed (for good reason). Mark Twain's book is no worse than the tales of Uncle Remus in SONG OF THE SOUTH, and just as fun. I suppose with any great movie or great book, we can always disect it, and discover something negative about it. But with SONG OF THE SOUTH there is very little to find fault with. Perhaps the film is a little too cheery. Maybe there isn't enough brutality in it (like GONE WITH THE WIND or the infamous BIRTH OF A NATION). Maybe Disney should re-edit the film and make certain that there are a few moments where Uncle Remus is whipped by his masters, or maybe we can see more prejudice amongst the townspeople. Maybe B'rer Rabbit or B'rer Fox can offer some disparaging remarks towards Negroes. Then maybe, just maybe, Disney should ban the film. But the film stands on its own. SONG OF THE SOUTH stands tall. And it has every right to be seen as often as the classic GONE WITH THE WIND, or even the twisted BIRTH OF A NATION.",1064534400,289,2247,4.536945812807882

It is unfortunate that a small number of people who call ""Song of the South"" a racist movie (perhaps due to it's depiction of plantation life?) manage to censor it from the rest of us.  To the contrary, it is a heart-warming movie depicting a bond between a young color-blind white boy (Johnny) and Uncle Remus who teaches the young boy important lessons in life through story telling.  I am certain that Walt would be ashamed to know the caretakers of his classic have decided to play 'Mickey Mouse Politics' with it.

I found the content very offensive, and I am not usually sensitive to racial things, as I believe most of it is an excuse or just irrelevant....I realize that in those times, Blacks were portrayed like that, but I don't think it should be released now. ...

I saw the movie for the first time when I was just under 2 years old (and sang and danced through the last scene along w/ the kids on the screen - and nobody stopped me or told me to sit) and for the last time when I was about 13.  Its racial overtones turned me into a terrible person - it taught me that despite my whitebread upbringing I could be friends w/ black kids which I proceeded to do once in college, which, in turn, led me to move to Haiti for ten years where I studied anthropology at the university and learned that Uncle Remus is a ""griot"" or village storyteller whose function is to pass tradition orally to the new generations and that those same stories are known and loved in the West Indies and in Africa.  The ultimate upshot - an almost 35-year interracial relationship which remains stable and strong.  God, yes, that's a dangerous movie.  Whatever you do, Disney, DON'T RELEASE IT!!
