4720714,4,B005LAIH86,"A group of men who are all friends are at varying degrees of relationship status with women. They soon find that their ladies are manipulating the men in their lives using a book that was written for women who are having relationship problems. The men then turn the tables on them by using the information in the book to their own advantage. This all may sound devious, but it is in fact quite funny. An attractive cast of actors and actresses make this romantic-comedy well worth seeing, providing a lot of laughs and relationship situations that many of us may be familiar with. The results may be predictable, but the route that takes us there is funny and entertaining.",1335139200,7,673,4.663865546218488
4720715,3,B005LAIH86,"Truth. Steve Harvey's so-called self help book, Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man is about as sharp in its insights as a dull butter knife. The only reason for the monumental success was a mention by Oprah, and she could push a book about dried poop to the best seller list. Described as the guide to helping women decode the supposedly complicated inner workings of the average guy's brain, the book is really a bunch of cliches given clever little nick names and written for those with the relationship acumen of the 40 Year Old Virgin. The film doesn't fall far from the tree, and is best taken as a simple rom-com with a bevy of incredible African-American talent taking advantage of a rarely given opportunity to shine.

That's not to say that Think Like a Man is a film specifically targeted at African-Americans, because it isn't. One of the true joys is seeing people like Kevin Hart, Michael Ealy, and Regina Hall in a comedy with some universal truths. The never ending war between men and women on the field of love is something everyone can relate to, and the games we play are time tested and battle worn.

Before the manipulation game begins, one has to get through an hour of Steve Harvey ego stroking, as the comedian pops up every couple of minutes, grinning like he stole somethin'(like your money if you bought his book) and mugging for the camera. The story centers on a close knit group of guys who all represent clearly stereotypes depicted in the book: there's the mamma's boy(Terrence J); the ""dreamer""(Michael Ealy); the Playa(Romany Malco); and the man child who won't commit(Jerry Ferrara). The men find themselves taken off guard by the release of Harvey's book, which has apparently been dropped from the heavens and written by the all-knowing hand of some love deity. Book stores can't keep it in stock, you can't even get it on Kindle, and women worship it like chocolate covered diamonds.

Gabrielle Union, Taraji P. Henson, Regina Hall, and Meagan Good make up the ladies who use Harvey's words to try and transform their guys, even though they fit into neat little categories as well, like the ""90 Day Rule"" girl and the single mom. When any of the characters talk about the opposite sex, none of them say anything remotely new. If you saw Two Can Play That Game then it's much the same dynamic, with both sides working the other until all the scheming inevitably falls apart. What works best is when the guys are all together, especially during the hilarious basketball scenes, because we get to see the camaraderie and chemistry of the cast come together.

Once Harvey steps aside, Kevin Hart takes over as the story's primary narrator, in what is the film's funniest, most endearing performance as the guy who most vehemently values his freedom after a brutal divorce. Think back to the way Chris Tucker blew our minds in Friday, and that's the impact Hart brings to the film. He zips in and out of every scene and when not acting like a complete fool he even shows a few moments of sincere emotional depth.

Many of the connecting stories don't stretch beyond familiar territory, with the exception being Ealy and Henson's sexy courtship. She plays a high powered exec who expects her man to match her status and ferocious independence, while Ealy is a poor sous chef looking for his big break. They share some seriously hot moments that threaten to melt the screen.

While not doing anything particularly new, Think Like A Man has enough raw talent to overcome a few flaws with the script and Harvey's burdensome armchair psychology.",1335139200,2,3572,4.725521669341894
4720716,4,B005LAIH86,"It's always fun when the tables are turned on connivers! Advertised like a Chick Flick, I was delighted to hear the most uproarious laughter was coming from the many men in the audience. This predictable, crowd-pleasing comedy is based on thrice-married Steve Harvey's best-selling book ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About Love, Relationships, Intimacy and Commitment.""

After scenes which establish five male stereotypes: Dreamer, Player, Commitment Phobe, Mama's Boy, and Divorc, we then meet their female counterparts: Career Woman, Twice-burned Single, Wanna-be Wife, Single Mom, and Divorce. These women discover Mr. Harvey's best seller which gives them insight into how men think. They quickly modify their behavior, which enables them to ensnare their guys. This works fine until the men tumble to the scheme and decide to fight fire with fire.

You should recognize many of these names:
  * Steve Harvey (""Madea Goes to Jail"") plays himself, a successful self-help author.
  * Michael Ealy (""For Colored Girls"") is an oft-employed dreamer. He's between jobs right now...
  * Taraji P. Henson (""Larry Crowne"") is the career woman. She wants a rsum along with long-term goals from any prospective date.
  * Romany Malco (""A Little Bit of Heaven"") is a smooth operator. It's fun to watch this guy in action.
  * Meagan Good (""Jumping the Broom"") is ready to try the ninety- day trial period...IF she can last that long!
  * Jerry Ferrera (""Entourage"") is an overgrown boy. Why give up that old couch and those video games when he has such a nice woman to support him?
  * Gabrielle Union (""Good Deeds"") has lived with her guy for years; she really wants to get married.
  * Terrence Jenkins (""Burlesque"") knows his mother will look out for him. She makes sure he doesn't date anyone who might not measure up to HER standards.
  * Regina Hall (""Death at a Funeral"") already has ONE boy to raise, she doesn't need a second one.
  * Kevin Hart (""Exit Strategy"") is the divorc. He knows three rings: An engagement ring, a wedding ring, and suffer ring.
  * Wendy Williams (lots of TV) has all three of those rings (see above).

Attractive stars, an intriguing premise and a funny script make for a rollicking PG-13 skirmish in the battle of the sexes. Amazon.com will notify me when it's available on DVD.",1334966400,25,2335,4.895408163265306

Thanks to Steve Harvey's book: Think Like A Man, women have done exactly that-think like a man which really confuses the men in this movie. That is until the men figure out that their women have read steve harvey's book and they get their hands on it to flip things around back on the women fighting for their affection. Winner takes all in this romantic comedy about saying all the right things she wants to hear, then actually having to step up to men what what you say.",1474761600,,696,4.320610687022901

I gave it two stars because the acting was okay, but the advice, games, and lowering of standards to the point of compromising ones value warrants zero stars.  Women do not need to think like men, rather they need to act like ladies who have standards and a sound moral compass.  If this movie was truly reminiscent of the advice and content of the book the tainted advice is provided in two forms of media, and any woman who takes it completely to heart will be lead astray.",1451001600,,639,4.204918032786885
4721561,4,B005LAIH86,"My family found it funny. I was a fan of the book and wanted to see if the movie would hold up. While it's in no way as good, I still enjoyed it a lot. I've read the reviews and really think people are reading too much into the man vs. woman
This movie has great acting, wonderful storyline and was entertaining. I think everyone would enjoy it wether you are in a relationship or not. All in all, a bankable romantic comedy.

review from Metacritic-
Think Like a Man may want to be a self-help catalyst for relational change. Modern relationships are unhealthy, it tells us. It's time to return to a more balanced, even old-fashioned way of looking at things.

I appreciate that. The film suggests that some traditional gender roles have been successful for a reason. It insists that love is more important than sex. And in its own way it encourages men to take more responsibility while asking women to be patient with their guys but insistent that they, as women, deserve to be treated with respect. That they deserve to be pursued.

But while past relational models are templates here for a healthier understanding of relationship, there's a failure to understand what was at the core of those models: an understanding that relationships should echo divine love. The compromise we see is a step in the right directionif tripped up by sex, drugs and swearingbut it falls short of the selfless giving we're to embody. Staying abstinent for 90 days is arguably better than merely holding out for 90 minutes, but it gets nowhere near the beauty and importance of sex reserved for a committed, lifelong love within the protection of marriage.",1450742400,2,1641,4.710801393728223

It's not a movie you have to put a lot of thought into just watch and laugh.,1434585600,,285,3.6885245901639343

4722773,3,B005LAIH86,"Think Like a Man was a romantic comedy that fell just fell short.  In this film four friends get together to turn the tables on their women when they find out that the ladies have been reading and using Steve Harvey's relationship advice against them.  This is based off of the book written by Steve Harvey which is titled Act Like a Lady, Think Like A Man.  Keith Merryman and David A. Newman were in charge of writing the screenplay for this.  Tim Story directed the film and is best known for his works on Fantastic Four, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and Ride Along.

You follow four interconnected and diverse men, Dominic (Michael Ealy), Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara), Michael (Terrance Jenkins), Zeke (Romany Malco), whose love lives are shaken up after the ladies they are pursuing buy Harveys book and start taking his advice to heart.  The guys friends Cedric (Kevin Hart) is recently divorced so he is not caught up in the drama and the same goes for their happily married friend Bennett (Gary Owen) Once Bennett brings it to their attention that these girls are reading a guys playbook written by a guy, they decide to get a copy of the book for themselves and use the information in it to turn things back in their favor.  The only thing is they don't realize that the girls were not trying to ruin their lives they were trying to make them better and by turning things around on them they could lose everything they have learned to love so much.

This film is a decent film to watch if you want to kill a day where you have nothing else to do.  It has a good cast that work really well together which makes for some very good scenes and some very hilarious ones as well.  I wouldn't say this is the best film I have ever seen because it's not.  It's just another attempt to cash in on a book on the big screen and I don't know if it really works here.  There are so many other romantic comedy films out there that I think have been better.  He's Just Not That Into You is one that comes to my head when watching this film and it was so much better.  If you are with your girlfriend or wife and she wants to watch a romantic comedy I will tell you to watch this one though.  It is a more masculine romantic movie than any I have ever seen.

Overall I would give this film a C.  It is not the best film I have seen but at the same time it was enjoyable to watch so if you haven't seen this and you are being forced to watch a romantic comedy it's worth checking out.",1412640000,,2483,4.237791932059448

4723653,3,B005LAIH86,"Ostensibly based on Steve Harvey's best-selling book, this film uses the book more as a springboard for a rather typical battle-of-the-sexes plot that, while rather formulaic, delivers on the charisma and chemistry of its cast. Speaking of the cast, there's a who's who of African-American talent on display, with Kevin Hart, Michael Ealy and Gabrielle Union among the standouts. Everyone here brings their A-game when it came to the comedy, and no one really felt out of place, even the token white guy. Granted, there isn't a whole lot of character development and certain title cards actually play up the stereotype that each person is portraying (originating in Steve Harvey's book), but the actors play their parts very well. Steve Harvey also shows up occasionally to quote his book, essentially providing commentary on some scenes. Of course, the final act has the obligatory melodrama and unbelievably perfect resolution that we've come to expect from this type of movie. It might be sweet, but for me it was a little too formulaic and saccharine. Still, the 90 minutes that preceded it were mostly enjoyable, with lots of great laugh-out-loud moments. This isn't the best romantic comedy in the world, but you could do a whole lot worse. On another note, the soundtrack is great and features a good mix of old-school and modern R&B.",1406246400,,1341,5.017937219730942

I gave it four stars because that's pretty much my highest score. For something to get five stars it really has to be something extra special and there are very few of those. The only detraction for us on this film is the language. My wife and I don't like hearing curse words. Sometimes curse words fit a movie. We didn't see that it added anything to this movie and we'd have enjoyed it more without them. For those who don't mind them and for people who get some thrill from hearing people use curse words you'll love this movie.

Plus, I would've liked to see more of Gabrielle Union. Otherwise, good movie! Terrence J who used to host 106 & Park is good in this movie and plays the mamas boy.

However, this one was 'very' well made, funny, interesting, full of eye candy on both sides of the track and for those who have not seen it, I bet you will be thinking it is about your relationship too.  And I bet you will be taking notes too.  This may definitely be a chick-flick, but, the power of comedy will pull the men in all the way.  In addition to giving them a few pointers.  Yes I said it, pointers!  I mean think about it, how does a boy really know how to be a man?  He doesn't.  Which is why ladies always seem and feel dissatisfied and want more.  Remember for every one women with a great man, there are probable ten women who taught him how to be.  And by the way those other ten women hate his guts.

They were vicious and evil. After watching this here movie, I don't think I want to date...ever! Dating seems like it would be a ton of work, and anyone who knows me knows that I hate work. Wendy Williams pops up in a couple of scenes and was probably the best part of the movie for me. He has the biggest boobs I've ever seen on a man, and I like them hooters!",1387756800,,530,4.155339805825243

4725445,5,B005LAIH86,"Love this movie! I just watched it last night! It's really funny, without ""trying"" too hard to be funny. It also doesn't make either sex look degraded. It shows the essence of both the sexes, the good & bad, without being too condescending to one or the other.  And of course, I had to get this with my leading man, Michael Ealy, in it!  Ok, Ok, so there really isn't ""ONE"" leading man. But I love how each story has a lesson to be learned... even tired-a** divorced ""Cedric"" (Kevin Hart), shares a lesson to be learned. I think it gives us Single Ladies Hope that love still lives, even if you're over 30yrs old. And I like how they pulled some things from the book (which I've read, and probably need to re-read, lol) in order to create the characters. It made what we read in the book more tangible.",1385942400,,802,4.304635761589404

Women are armed with copies of ""Think Like a Man, Act Like a Lady"", a book by Steve Harvey that is selling out at bookstores everywhere.  They are using men's own philosophy against them until one of the guys in the group stumbles upon a copy of it and starts reading it.  Because the ladies have no idea that the guys know the real score in this little War of the Sexes, the tables begin to turn.  But!  No Spoilers Here!  You'll have to watch the movie to see what happens.  This is just a fun ride which I highly suggest!",1381276800,,681,4.106060606060606

4725655,3,B005LAIH86,"too much profanity. I am sick and tired of hearing people cussing particularly black people cussing. Why couldn't the script have them talk to each other without profanity? Even if they have to insult each other couldn't they find a dictionary and some synonyms for all of the four letter words. It's too bad because Kevin Hart, who actually cursed the most, turns in a hilarious performance and Regina Hall is also very good. Megan Good and Gabrielle Union seem to be playing the roles they always play but the strengths of the rest of the actors in the ensemble helps to balance the movie. Too bad about the cussing.",1378598400,2,618,4.627272727272727

4725777,4,B005LAIH86,"Note: I saw this film in HD via XFinity On Demand.

This film is a very funny (mostly in a holy-crap-I-can't-believe-you-said-that kind of way), serious and heartfelt look at the wrong kinds of men, how to avoid them and how some males can actually change their sausage-like behaviour and turn into a real man. The only thing I didn't like was that God's Name was combined with a mild profanity. Seriously? Does almost every movie made now have to disrespect the Creator of the Universe who so loveth the world that He gave His only begotten Son so that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life? That is the only fly in the ointment of what is an otherwise uproariously funny and serious motion picture.

4725892,5,B005LAIH86,I really enjoyed this movie. It touched different aspects of love and how various situations force you to be honest with yourself. The storyline is awesome without having the same old presentation of relationships. Definately a must have! I watched it back to back twice...and the soundtrack is just as good. Check it out!,1368662400,,322,4.981481481481482

4725894,5,B005LAIH86,"This movie went beyond what I expected it. It brought lots of drama and humor to everyday situations with relationships that many of us can certainly relate to.

The eye candy for both men and women, un-be-lieve-able! Each couple brought it! The movie never lost its momentum and was enjoyable from beginning to end.

I would recommend this as a ""couples"" movies. There is something in it for everybody! Deliciousness...",1367539200,,420,4.985714285714286

4725896,5,B005LAIH86,"I went to see this movie the day it came out in the theaters & got it the day the DVD came out. LOVE Michael Ealy & LOVED this movie. I have seen it over 100 times already. Can't wait for ""Think Like A Man 2""",1367452800,,208,3.5434782608695654
4725897,5,B005LAIH86,The DVD came in very good shape. There were no scratches or nicks the case cover was in very good shape. I had no problems watching the movie. If you like to watch movies at a low price then I recommend Amazon. It is the best place to find good deals on movies!!!,1366675200,,263,3.981132075471698
4725898,5,B005LAIH86,"This is a great movie. You can learn a lot from this movie as well.
The actors played great rolls. A must see funny movie.",1366329600,,122,3.92
4725899,3,B005LAIH86,"I'm torn with this film simply because I found it really, really funny and yet absolutely predictable, nothing new or special and somewhat forgettable.  When all was said and done, I forgot about this one rather quickly and yet I can't help but admit that I was thoroughly entertained while watching it.  The humor is high, even if the scenarios are ridiculously formulaic (you can guess every pairing and every outcome a mile away).

Kevin Hart is the star of this show.  His brand of funny is effective in every frame here.  He lands every joke and plays up his part very well.  Sure, he's a stereotype (seriously, he's the token black guy in a black film) but it works.  He anchors the film, giving it a central force while the rest splinters all over the place.

Not sure if the film makes a point other than that Steve Harvey's book doesn't really work.  I mean, you have the women and the men using it and then being offended that it was used and then falling in love on their own rights.  Still, there is some really funny dialog here, and the cast as a whole understands how to make this material work.  It reminded me a bit, in the staging, of `What to Expect When You're Expecting', except this one was actually funny (that movie was terrible).  So, if you want a familiar film with new laughs, check this one out.  I don't quite understand the influx of five-star reviews here (it's not THAT funny), but I can't say that I dislike this one.",1366156800,,1451,4.430188679245283

4725931,5,B005LAIH86,"First off, I love Kevin Hart as I thought he was hilarious. Second, it made sense for women to look at dating from a male POV and also to see how, just maybe we as ladies need to step up our game as well. The movie is based off of Steve Harvey's ""Act like a lady, But think like a Man""..and I like how he gives his little tid-bits through the movie as well. Most of all, it was just pure humor.",1365638400,,394,3.817073170731707

4725936,3,B005LAIH86,"I read the book "" Think Like A Man, Act Like A Woman"" and it was a good read, so I was looking forward to seeing the movie. I guess the book is always better than the movie, because I also have read ""The Secret Live of Bees"" and saw the movie, the book was better. This movie was just o k 4 me.",1364947200,,294,3.609375

4726232,4,B005LAIH86,"I've decided that I like Kevin Hart best in movie format rather than stand up. Don't get me wrong, he's a funny guy; but his language is pretty foul, so I don't enjoy the stand up add much add I would if he'd expand his vocab. This was also a great ensemble cast. Everyone played their parts very well. Stand out was of course Kevin's battered husband, but he didn't steal the show which was phenomenal so it gave every character the ability to deliver several laugh out loud funny moments. Morris Chestnut's cameo is a revamp of the character he played for one epi of Living Single, so that was a little expected and overdone. Wendy Williams' cameo was entertaining and in keeping with all of the stereotypes being made fun of in this movie.  Great job by everyone.",1358726400,,766,4.4714285714285715

4726239,4,B005LAIH86,"When a movie is in the neighborhood of 2 hrs. long, it usually means that it has something to say(Enemy of the State, Titanic, 21, Good Fellas, Casino, Dark Blue, Harlem Nights, American History X, etc); this one does! Steve Harvey's logic misses in some places, but, even if it was some renowned Joe Blow, only the movie and book are important! It's like a better version of Two Can Play That Game and without the religious baggage of that said movie. So, it's better all around. It's a twisted romance flick where every character's romantic life matters a lot and adds value to the movie! There are couples with issues of doing the relationship thing again after divorce(which I don't agree with except for infidelity), a couple with commitment phobe issues, couples where guys don't routinely measure up(financially & dating wisely due to constantly getting the wrong guy), a happily married couple(where the woman isn't revealed), and a relationship where there is this almost unbelievable momma's boy & his momma complicating his relationship(s). Basically, Steve Harvey's book is a popular book among women and a lot of women in this social climate have it or have access to it. At least all of the unmarried couple's women use the book like kids with chocolate; this type of thing can happen rather quickly these days. Anyway, the women apply this book to their very real romance. Eventually, the guys discover what's going on. When they do, they secretly pact together and flip the script--hoping to easily make their relationships smooth(having all the answers to the test). Again, the women figure out what's going on by accident. They break it off, seeing what they are doing as classless and deceitful. They eventually work things out. That's the template, but the movie is more complex than that--as all things don't apply to all couples. Most of the guys are buddies, but the women either section off as friends or are acquaintances. There are not any lessons to be learned, bc how can anyone learn a lesson in a story where people take most of there romantic advice from a love doctor and his book?! But it gets a high rating bc all the work in this kind of soap operatic funneling to add the story and it's far more twisted than any other dating flick; plus, the powers that be really tried hard to please. Like a soap opera, not all characters are connected directly or indirectly. That's real life; many films with a lot of characters don't get this. Problems: Too much unnecessary bad language(over the top usage) esp. from Hart. Everyone ended up too true to form; they should have switched it up or at least changed the timing of everything. People are random and things don't work out that way. They could have still made it good by making sure everyone found happiness(in order to appease romance fans). This movie also has characters known as popular: G. Union, K. Hart, M. Good, and Good's friend looks a lot like Carmelo Anthony's wife; can't confirm anything, though. 4 out of 5.",1358121600,2,3006,4.771593090211132

4726935,4,B005LAIH86,"In 2009, comedian and game show host Steve Harvey wrote a book titled ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man"".  A number one New York Times bestseller, Harvey's book gave millions of women insight on how a man really thinks about love, intimacy and commitment.

And for many men, the fact that their ""game"" was exposed to women, how would a man react and deal with it?

Suffice to say, the ""what if?"" would eventually inspire writers Keith Marryman and David A. Newman (both wrote the Justin Timberlake/Mila Kunis 2011 film ""Friends with Benefits"") to write the 2012 romantic comedy, ""Think Like a Man"", directed by Tim Story (""Fantastic Four"" films and ""Barbershop"").

The film which was budgeted at $12 million, would go on to earn $95 million in the box office (ending ""The Hunger Games"" four-week run at #1).

VIDEO:

""Think Like a Man"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1).  Picture quality is well-lit and the clarity is very good.  Skintones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and the lighting was well done.  I didn't notice any banding issues or see any use of excessive DNR while watching the film.  Closeups to overall detail was very good and the HD presentation of ""Think Like a Man"" was excellent!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Think Like a Man"" is presented with an English 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack.  Also, an English-Audio Descriptive Track, French, Spanish, Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For a romantic comedy, the film is primarily a dialogue, front and center-channel driven soundtrack.  Dialogue is crystal clear and the music for the film is also well utilized for the surround channels. I heard no issues with the soundtrack during my viewing of the film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese, Indonesian/Bahasa, Korean and Thai.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Think Like a Man"" comes with the following special features:

  Deleted Scenes - (6:32) Featuring six deleted scenes total.
  Gag Reel - (5:58) Outtakes from ""Think Like a Man"".
  The Guy Code - (6:41) Producer Will Packer, director Tim Story and the cast talk about the film and its premise.
  Men vs. Women - (11:28) Director Tim Story talks about the casting of the men and women for the film.

  Comedy Behind the Scenes - (6:49) Director Tim Story talk about the cast and those who make people laugh in the film and on the set of ""Think Like a Man"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have a lot of single friends and I don't know many times we sit and discuss the mindset of women.  And in some cases, I know a good number of guys who rely on the teachings of books on how to get the women they want or how they can have an active social life with women.

""Think Like a Man"" is quite interesting because the women are the ones who have dated or have had relationships with bad men, and they just want to find a good man to love and a man who can return that love right back.  So, they turn to Steve Harvey's popular book ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man"" to understand how a man thinks.

And the men who have their game all set, are shocked to see how the women they are with, become more of a challenge to them, because they are not getting the easy sex that they want.

Featuring an ensemble cast, each of the male characters are guys that many men can relate to.  From one who is a non-commiter but just wants to be in a longtime relationship, the player, the mama's boy and the one who is literally searching for himself by pursing a different career path.

The storyline of ""Think Like a Man"" will surely be interesting to men who have been in the position of these guys who are looking to have fun with women.  But what happens when the women use Steve Harvey's book to the point of making sure these men don't get off that easy and have to prove their love to get anywhere.

And what happens when the women see things turning for them for a positive but the men catch on that they are reading Steve Harvey's book and try to turn things around?

It's a romantic comedy featuring an ensemble cast that showcases a ""Battle of the Sexes"" type of storyline, as men vs. women is the primary premise of this film.  But who will be making the changes necessary to find love?  The men or the women?

The film is quite entertaining and comedian Kevin Hart is crazy as ever!  It made me wonder how much of the film was actually improvised because a lot of the dialogue was off-the-cuff and that is where Kevin Hart is in his element, when he gets to go all out and be crazy.

But the casting for this film was well-done and each talent were able to portray the characters magnificently.  The chemistry in this film worked and for the most part, ""Think Like a Man"" is a popcorn romantic comedy that is just hilarious and fun because of the predicaments that the characters find themselves in.

While a little long in duration, there were a good number of additional scenes that could have been cut but personally, I'm glad that Tim Story kept them in.  From the guys playing basketball against LA Lakers Metta World Peace and former LA Sparks player Lisa Leslie was hilarious!  You also get cameos by La La Anthony, Wendy Williams, Sherri Shepherd and also music star Chris Brown.  And of course, you have to showcase the man who's book inspired the film, Steve Harvey!

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality was fantastic and for lossless audio, for a romantic comedy, it's primarily dialogue and music-driven but it fits the film just right and both music and dialogue are crystal clear!  There are also a good number of special features included but would have loved to have heard an audio commentary with the cast.  That would have been crazy but fun at the same time!

Overall, ""Think Like a Man"" is about relationship angst, the constant discussion of what a man and woman thinks and for those trying to get into a relationship, hope that one day you will find true love!  A hilarious romantic comedy that is just a lot of fun!  So, if you looking for a comedy to make you laugh but also a story that pokes fun at the dating scene, then definitely give ""Think Like a Man"" a chance!",1354320000,,6229,4.5
4726936,4,B005LAIH86,Enjoyed the movie.  Would recommend it for girls night or for couples night as well.  Everyone would enjoy this movie.,1354320000,,118,4.85
4726937,4,B005LAIH86,I was dragged to this movie while it was in theaters and was surprised at how funny it was. It was not as chick-flicky as I was expecting and Kevin Hart is hilarious!,1354320000,,166,4.0606060606060606
4726978,4,B005LAIH86,Men....will they ever learn....Women....will we ever learn???  It hit home on a few levels and glad they got the happy ending,1354233600,,125,4.9523809523809526
4726979,4,B005LAIH86,"I watched this movie and I liked the message it delivers in a way. But they based only on certain type of men and women. I also read the book I stole it from my wife and read it. I didn't agree with every single thing but it does give good pointers somehow. I got the book and movie for my sister that might give her an idea what direction she wants to take on her love life. I do think that the problem is how our brain works men and women are wired different. Women use their brains and hearts more than men do. And men usually don't know the real meaning of love until it hits them on the face. Women in the other hand are born with it. Now this decade women are more out spoken and want equality in this crazy society. Women have come a long way from past decades but they are becoming cold and want to act like men sometimes. Do not loose your essence its a gift, be women but choose wisely, its easy to make the wrong choice and hard to make the right one when you sometimes know its right. Men are becoming less interested in relationships because he can get one almost every night there is not much to conquer and fight for. When you give a man the challenge of trying to conquer a woman he will take it head on. That is the right time and opportunity for woman to show a man what love is, by the time he realizes he has conquered he is already in love. We men are a product of your behavior and you women are a product of our behavior. All that has to be done is change the way how we take things and act on them. And remember don't always go for looks and economic stability take a roll of the dice you might find your prince charming in a frogs body but with your intelligence and love you can turn him into the man of your dreams. I love my wife I felt something the first time I spoke to her and I said to myself I want to go out with her and the challenge started. By the time I realized she was mine we were at church getting married, I loved that woman in front of me, she was finally mine but I belonged to her the first moment she smiled at me. We have been together since 1995 married since 1999 under God's eyes when you profess love to one another that is it until death do us part and still I think I would search for her on the after life. We had our share of problems but our foundation is strong and I would do anything for her. She and my daughters are my life but sometimes life blinds you and don't see it. Relationships are a working progress you have to water them in order for them to grow strong. Got of subject for a moment there, well going back to the review its a good movie I recommend it.",1354147200,4,2626,3.975378787878788

4727379,5,B005LAIH86,"I treated myself to some me time and went to see this movie alone when it was showing in the theaters. Once on DVD I made the purchase for our movie library and we watched over and over. We (my husband and I) are still watching and this is going to make a great movie around the holidays.

I love the truth about the mamma boy as many men still seek the attention and approval of their mothers and these type of men are hard to be with in relationships because they put their mothers first and don't seem to understand that their wife comes first. I like this part of the movie because it shows how even though men do this, their mothers have gone on with their lives and will continue to live even though the man is missing out on his wife, because he is so concerned about the cares of his mother and seeking her attention instead of seeking his wife. (remember the apples does not fall to far from the tree, even if it is mother/son). This type of relationship is unhealthy and has boundary issue. (remember when you marry you do marry the family, the myth that you don't is wrong).

Other parts of the movie were great as well.. all parts of the movie will make you laugh, bring joy and make you think. This is at best a fun movie that will teach you some good lessons, and confirm a lot of things you may have been thinking.

I like how it shows the different type's of men and their mindsets.. Most men say it gives all of their secrets away. Many older women that I have talked to about the movie have told me, been there did that and there is nothing new the movie can teach them because they have lived this and know many of the games men play.

As for me, it was just great entertainment and pure fun to see this played out on the big screen. This movie will not disappoint even if you do know all of the games men play..

Women should set standards and not lower their standards. As it is a man comes in knowing what he wants and what he is willing and going to do. He already knows what his intentions are. So I am glad this movie was made, because it will at least make women think and get them to think about standards, respect, and wanting more for them selves than to let just anyone walk over them. Women do deserve better treatment than the songs, and media give them.

There may not be a perfect man, but at least you can be in a relationship and have your standards set and met.

This movie shows you how men do sit around and talk about women, and what some minds sets are and how they choose you. This is a wake up call that puts a fun spin on relationships.

I also love how the married man takes responsibility for his hanging out with the fellows and the responsibility he has to his family.. Many men don't do this and think that work, friends, mother, sister, brother come before his household (wife children). This was a great point in the movie to show how some men do know what their priority really is. Face it ""honor begins at home"" (Courageous movie).And men need to understand that they have to honor their household before anything and anyone else. This character shows that.

To me Kevin Hart was not over the top like some have said... Men do cry and men do cry in the dark (check out the play men cry in the dark). Men have emotions as well, and many don't want to separate from their wives but will not admit to the truth and will act strong around their friends and blood family members, and even co workers.  So to me he played this part well and showed the truth to this issue.

I love Gabrielle Union's role and part in this movie with the exception of the illicit substance. Great clean up role for her. This will help her to change her image as I like to see her in positive role and not the ones that show her taking other people's man. This will also show African American women the other options they have.

It was nice to see some different actors (Kelly Rowland) and many others. And to see some of the same.. good mix of actors. And all of them played their role well.

The book and movie are both great. This is pure fun sit back and relax and enjoy. You will learn some things, but still treat your relationship with real life and know that your spouse is human, this is just comedy.

Other great movies to view along with this one: Undertaking Betty, Marriage Chronicles, She Devil, What My Husband Doesn't Know (play with Michelle Williams, Brian White),  Derailed with Clive Owens Jennifer Aniston, A Good man is hard to find,  Unfaithful with Richard Gere, What goes around comes around (play by David E Talbert, Cheaper to keep her (the play with Brian McKnight), Love me or Leave me (the play) War of the roses, and Everyday Black Man.

Also the movie What Men Think (with Erica Giles, Bj Williams, Adam Rennie, and Natasha Noreiga) is really a great movie. If you watch noting else from the movie list above, watch this movie and Marriage Chronicles. Then work in the other movies from the above list. You will not be disappointed with Think like a man or any movies that I have listed.

I bought this because I wanted the digital copy not knowing that; 1. I would have to become a member
of some Sony service 2. create yet another account for their ""cloud"" service all before I could
get the digital movie that I paid for. I'm pretty tired of all these cloud services. I just wanted
to get the movie, type in the code and download the movie on MY desk to. With the cloud it says I can
you can only share it with up to 6 devices. I'm not sure about the download version yet. (It's still downloading as
I'm typing) But why should I have to create two accounts (one I really had no choice about) with Sony for a servce
I'm probably not going to use again. So annoyed.

Anyway, the movie was great - saw it at the theater -bought it for the Kevin Hart laughs and Michael Ealy :)

4727608,4,B005LAIH86,"This is a fluff movie that is fun to watch when you want to just sit back, enjoy, laugh a little, and take a break from life.  I found most of the characters likable, and Kevin Hart is adorable and really funny in this--every scene he's in is great.

This film is based on the premise of male author of a self-help book ""Think Like a Man"" that if you understand the way men operate and know what to expect them to do next in the relationship, you can outwit them and trap them into a marriage. It's a ridiculous premise (that you can manipulate a person into marriage and that they are clueless enough to fall for it), but it's fun to watch anyway and I would totally watch it again.

This is a battle of the sexes movie full of old cliches that are not necessarily true all the time for either sex.  So take everything negative and bombastic about stereotypes in dating and put those aspects into good-looking people and this is what you get.  I didn't like that for the sake of drama, they make the women so tough-skinned and hard-hearted. I don't care WHO you are, but if a kind man makes a serious effort to be a good man in a relationship, the woman will go with it! --she will not try to implode the relationship--that's hard to believe.  Since it is hard to find a good man who also happens to be into you, if we do find one, we're not going to be that stupid.  I do think though that men more frequently let good women slip through their fingers just because they won't settle down until their ready; they are just wired like that.  Most women I know are ready to settle down yesterday.

Anyway, if you don't judge it and sit back, you will enjoy this predictable movie.  It's cute and likable and if you watch it with friends, you'll have lots to discuss afterwards.  As a latina woman I also really appreciated that african-american people in this film are portrayed as normal, educated, decent, classy, striving, mature, relaxed, and moderate.  This film could easily have replaced the cast with any ethnicity and it would have worked equally--so thanks to the film-makers for avoiding those negative stereotypes!

4727660,3,B005LAIH86,"Based on Steve Harvey's book, this film features a large cast of beautiful men and women, all looking for romance, but for different reasons.  They are mostly unfulfilled.  When Harvey's female targeted book hits the store it is gobbled up, including the ladies in this film (Gabrielle Union, Meagan Good, Regina Hall, La La Anthony and Taraji P. Henson).  They don't all know each other at this point but through the men they date (Michael Ealy, Jerry Ferrara, Kevin Hart, Romany Malco, Terrence Jenkins) paths eventually cross.

As the ladies implement the Harvey strategies, they begin to get their way, but the men who are all buddies, figure out that some of the same lines are being used on each of them. So they find the book and begin a counter strategy.  Yeah, we all know where this is going but there is enough humor (mostly from a sometimes annoying Hart) to keep it interesting.  But really, do we need over 2 hours to get to where we all know we're going?",1349222400,,969,4.604651162790698

In my opinion, that dvd is really awful. They all have sex or cuss 2 much. That is what making movie not enjoyable. I am christian just wanna have fun and laugh looking for men advice. I know abt Steven Harvey's silly advice. I wanna take a peek on movie for his opinion on men/woman. I was giggling in beginning, I was like ""oh probably it true"" then later it got worst with all hardcore sex and cussing.

I had to turn it off. Not just because of that. From my presective, what I have learned...there is a lot things you can say. Why do you have to cuss? It really is not cute or funny at all. Do you notice a person saying the similar bad word over again? It is because he doesn't know what to say. Also he trying be funny. Rolling eye... I would not want watch movie if he say words over again. It too boring. Why do you have to have sex to save/keep man? If you wait, he would show respect and wait along with you . Steve Harvey knows nothing. I know a man waits even longer than a year...

Overall movie is nice but too adultery for kids if you know what I mean.",1348963200,3,1242,3.96

Great movie.,1348617600,,435,4.190476190476191
4727824,3,B005LAIH86,"My wife and I saw the movie Think Like a Man a couple weeks ago and to took a little for my thoughts on it to culminate. The movie is based on the Steve Harvey book, Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, published in 2009. In it, Harvey describes how a woman could learn different types of men and determine if a potential relationship is right for her.

The movie is based on four men and four women, the men being the different `types' the women need to think like in order to have successful relationships. I'm truly of two minds regarding this movie. For starters, it's very heavy-handed that it is based on the Steve Harvey book. I mean, there wasn't a book with a picture of Mario Puzo anywhere in the movie The Godfather, and Rhett didn't need to reference a book before telling Scarlett he didn't give a damn in Gone with the Wind, why couldn't a story be crafted without having extremely convenient and awkward-fitting cut-ins to Harvey mentioning segments of his book or the women saying things that begin with, ""Steve Harvey says..."" And by the way, this is a romantic comedy, to play Steve Harvey serious is a complete travesty. The man is an accomplished comedian and he was a bore.

But maybe I'm being unfair. The Godfather and Gone with the Wind were two completely different kinds of movies from Think Like a Man. A comparison to a movie within its genre would be fair, right? How about, I dunno, say He's Just Not that Into You, starring everyone. That movie was based on the book by the same title, written by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo and made into a romantic comedy. But it didn't need to constantly hearken back to its source material as if seeking purchase in the minds of the people who'd read the book or wanted to. And as romantic comedies tend to go, He's Just Not That Into You was boring (in my opinion).

Which brings me to my other mind on Think. Despite any preconceived notions I found myself laughing frequently throughout this movie. This is mostly due to the efforts of Kevin Hart, who plays Cedric, a man at the tail-end of divorce in the midst of three of his friends involved in budding romances. But Hart is more than just comedy relief. He's the movie's fulcrum and carries it off with a degree gravitas, despite going for the joke in nearly every scene. There's a palpable degree of juxtaposition between what Cedric is going through and what the other three men are experiencing, most apparent during his divorce party when the men are all thinking about their relationships and realizing how they are being manipulated.

So not entirely liking or disliking the movie, the only other means I have to determine if it was a success in my mind is watchability. Would I watch this again? I rented it from Blockbuster, but I don't see myself renting it again (but that's probably more likely because I can get it from my library), but when this comes on HBO or Showtime, unless it's competing with boxing, I think I would.",1348617600,,2962,4.51024208566108
4727825,4,B005LAIH86,This is great movie. The are some truth about love. The reaction of men and the one for the women. You will laugh. You will enjoy it. No regret for me to watch this movie.,1348617600,,171,3.914285714285714

4727868,4,B005LAIH86,Ok well knowing the cast up front is good but it creates a huge problem because you expect it to be incredible!!! so with that being said I thought for how great of a cast it took a long time before it got funny and iteresting. in other words a very very very slow start.... but when it did start it was good. Again maybe if i didn't know everyone in the cast i would have thought it was great but a bit dissapointed. But still a good movie!!!,1348531200,,443,3.9887640449438204

4727871,5,B005LAIH86,"Steve Harvey's attempt to portray man's aura about relationship is quite delightful in this movie.  I am a man and yes, I have read his book (notably coerced by the other half) but nonetheless I was quite surprise at the amount of info he divulged about us ( Any one remember ""How to Be A Player?). Well this is quite the opposite.  This book actually teaches women how to beat men in the everlasting game (ahem...battle) of relationship. He may have given TMI on the subject and on this basis I can understand (and applaud) why is he's called "" a traitor to himself and to all men"".  The film is quite realistic and if you follow the script very carefully you might just find you ""genre"" in on of the characters.  And if any woman reads this....remember it is not a blueprint on how to get and keep a man....It's just a book....Talk to your man...He does have ears you know.",1348444800,,875,4.382716049382716
4727872,3,B005LAIH86,It was entertaining even if it was a bit contrived.  Kevin Hart carried most of the movie.  He's a young comic genius.,1348444800,,118,4.318181818181818
4727873,4,B005LAIH86,"My wife and I rented this movie on a whim the other evening.  I was pleasantly surprised at how funny it was.  Everyone turns in a solid performance, and having a few comedians (who didn't go overboard and chew the scenery) was a definite plus.  The only real drag was the too frequent Steve Harvey interjections where he quotes his own book and moves the plot along.  I guess when you're making the movie you can get away with being a little self serving, even if it pulls the movie down a bit.

It's not a groundbreaking, earth shaking movie with an awesome plot.  It's not going to win any awards.  What Think Like A Man will do is entertain you for the run time.  Grab a bowl of popcorn, grab a significant other, and share a laugh.",1348444800,,736,4.282608695652174

To myself it seemed like Steve Harveys' stand-up routine on film. Nothing different about the ending. The man always gets the girl. Kevin Hart and Michael Ealy were standouts and you kind of rooted for them. Worth the trip,but not a repeat viewing. Good casting.",1348012800,,413,4.914285714285715

4728191,4,B005LAIH86,"I'll keep this short and sweet.

Normally I don't like romantic comedies, I like action, adventure, violence, death, destruction and mayhem.  However I watched this and it was pretty funny!  It was neat to see how men and women act when the other gender isn't around, well at least according to the film-maker this is how they act.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The best parts of this movie are Kevin Hart's antics and voice-over work as the narrator.

We have all the different types of men and women, and as usual the men screw up, but what is really good is that one of the women screws up as well.  So instead of just the men making mistakes, we see that women make mistakes too, so it's kept in perspective.

With the all star cast I felt I would not have been disappointed.  The movie was just ok to me.  I thought it was a little much that the book was literally advertised during the entire movie not including the tidbits of advice from Steve Harvey in between. I mean the appearances from Steve Harvey I think was ok but it just seemed like the book was being pushed too hard. There are quite a few movies that are inspired by books. If you keep seeing the book throughout the movie it takes something from it in my opinion.

Next. I love Kevin Hart but he was just a bit over the top in the movie. Too much. Can't place my finger on why the movie wasn't hitting for me but I will watch it again and see.",1347062400,,816,4.0875

Genre: 6.5 Movie: 6

What's it about?
Four women have given up on getting their men to do what they want until they find a how to book written by Steve Harvey. They start using his advice about relationships, and their men start falling in line, until the men discover what the women have been doing, then the war is on.

What did I think?
This movie was a treat for the romantic at heart.  I think the movie would have been better if it wasn't all happily ever after, but I liked it.  It was funny and down to earth, with real life relationship issues that we all have dealt with.  Ladies...take it from the happily married guy...Men are shallow because deep down they are afraid to be hurt.  I think I just ruined Steve Harvey's book.",1346457600,,862,4.34375

4728253,2,B005LAIH86,"I read the book and based on so many friends/family talking about the movie, I was very interested to finally watch it.

4728256,4,B005LAIH86,"""There is no such thing as a perfect man."" Four male friends think they have it made. The all have great girlfriends who make them happy. Four female friends all think that they have the worst relationship. When Steve Harvey writes a book for women about how they should act the tables in the relationship turn. The men think they find an answer, but like most everything we do that backfires. I have to admit that I am not usually a fan of these types of movies. Without sounding racist I am not a fan of the Tyler Perry movies (even though this isn't one) and this just looked way to girly for me. I can't believe how wrong I was. While the movie is formulaic and predictable it is still very funny and really entertaining. There were a few parts in this that I laughed really hard at and when it was over I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. While this is, and should be, considered a chick-flick this is one of the ""girl movies"" that I liked and I think most men will like it too. Don't base you seeing this or not off of past movies like this. This is much better then I expected. Overall, very funny and much better then I expected.

4728258,5,B005LAIH86,No hating on Tyler Perry (maybe a little LOL) but really this film was worth seeing. It was a balanced film that though it starred an urban/black A List of actors was not stereotypical. It was a movie I believe anyone can relate to.

4728293,3,B005LAIH86,"I love watching African-Americans movies. But, this one just okay. It wasn't really good or bad. Just right in the middle.

I could see why people thought it would be better with fewer characters to make the pace of the movie go much faster. This is a very long movie that needed to be cut down. It didn't need to be ridiculous cut, but maybe quarter or so was not needed.

The movie is very easy to follow and very easy to guess what would happen next. This makes the humor harder to do and much of it isn't that funny after seeing the trailers for it.

Nothing really new happens for this movie that made me really enjoy it. I only found myself just laughing once in the whole movie. You just see each relationship get started, mess up, and get back together. I found some characters were more more interesting than others. And then even some of the characters I didn't even care for or liked at all.

I was expecting more scenarios from real life as in the book instead of your normal predictable ""boy finally gets girl"" or the ""stuck up girl"" finally realizes she can lower her standards. (Boy does not always GET girl in real life) Too easy to predict and I agree with some of the other reviews that there are too many stories at once.  Also, if it hadn't been for Kevin Hart most probably would not found it entertaining at all. Thus, 3 stars.  This movie was too hyped to be too typical.

If you are looking for anything more you will be disappointed.  But none the less, I thought it was great.

I knew going into this film I that I was really going to like it, just look at that cast. Everyone in this film is wonderful actors who always deliver. So when this came out we all got together to go check this out, myself, the wife, my brother and a few others. As I suspected this was a really fun battle of the sexes type of film. Funny and was a good spin on the book that it is based upon by Steve Harvey.

The movie follows five couples although one of those is not revealed until later and the troubles that they are having. All of the women are reading a new book that was written by Steve Harvey which they think gives them a leg up on the competition, their significant others. Little do they know that the other team [the guys], have the play book too.

This was a funny movie full of wonderful performances from everyone involved. I don't even have to go through the cast because you can look and just see who I am talking about and know I am right. Director Tim Story did an excellent job here as he has done in the past with films like Barbershop and Ride Along. Of course credit should also go to writers Keith Merryman and David A. Newman who wrote Friends with Benefits prior to this.

This flick is very recommended as it is a fun movie and the Blu-Ray comes with some good special features. All involved here did a really good job.",1523232000,,1368,4.170454545454546
