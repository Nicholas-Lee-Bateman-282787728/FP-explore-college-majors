8237479,5,B0010A1ECC,"I saw this three-hour miniseries after reading ""Family of Spies"" by Pete Earley. The film, which seems more like a movie than a miniseries to me, is based on this book as well as ""I Pledge Allegiance"" by Howard Blum. (I loved Earley's book, incidentally. It is based on extensive interviews with spy John Walker [in prison] as well as others who were involved in the story. For more details and insights related to the Walker spy ring, this book is recommended. I have not read Howard Blum's book.)

The acting in the miniseries is very good, with seasoned actors/actresses. (The film stars Powers Boothe as John Walker and Lesley Ann Warren as Barbara Walker.) The plot and filming are well done. (It was nominated for two Golden Globe awards, including Best Mini Series.) It holds one's interest and - an aspect that I like - sticks to the facts to a large extent. The film does a good job of showing John Walker's extreme self-centeredness (which is also quite evident in Earley's book). The only weakness, in my opinion, was that it devoted almost no attention to John Walker's brother Art as part of the spy ring, while it does devote attention to the spying activities of John Walker's son Michael and John Walker's friend Jerry Whitworth.

Overall, a very entertaining film and a fairly accurate presentation of this true story.",1241395200,3,1335,4.75
