2553367,5,B000F6IIX0,"James Herriot's Yorkshire is a well done tribute to the world's most famous veternarian, James Herriot aka Alf Wight. Christopher Timothy, who portrayed James Herriot in the BBC series ""All Creatures Great and Small"" serves as the host for this documentary. Christopher takes you inside the popular bestseller ""James Herriot's Yorkshire"" allowing you to glimpse what life in the Yorkshire Dales is really like. Throughout the film you are taken to locations in Yorkshire which Herriot made famous in his critically acclaimed best selling book series "" All Creatures Great and Small,All Things Bright and Beautiful,All Things Wise and Wonderful,The Lord God Made Them All and Every Living Thing."" The only criticism I have is that this film is not available on dvd. This is a must see film for everyone who loves James Herriot's works.",1190419200,8,834,5.139705882352941

8118000,3,B000F6IIX0,"This is a PAL-format DVD. I even had initial issues viewing it on my region-free player. That said, if you wondered what Herriot's Yorkshire looked like in the 90's, here your chance. I'd also suggest the 70's tome ""James Herriot's Yorkshire"" with photos by Derry Brabbs as a accompaniment.",1361577600,3,290,4.938775510204081
8118001,4,B000F6IIX0,"I thought there would be an interview with the author.  There wasn't.  Mostly just a look at some beautiful scenery.  Very little insight into the ""story behind the story"".  All that said, we enjoyed it anyway.",1359849600,6,210,4.75
8118002,1,B000F6IIX0,"My husband is a huge fan of Alf Wight (a.k.a. James Herriot) but the DVD could not be played on our US DVD player.  We had this same problem when we purchased a DVD when we were in England.  Luckily they send us a replacement DVD that could be played on out US DVD player.  I was disappointed fora couple of reasons: 1.) it was not listed as a UK only DVD, 2). now I have the hassle of trying to send this back to get my money back.",1356998400,15,432,3.831460674157303
8118003,2,B000F6IIX0,"This video arrived in good condition on time.  I was a bit disappointed as it was only a short interview with Alf Wight,the real James Herriot, and the rest was scenery.  The scenery was pleasant but I couldn't really recommend this video.",1341792000,,239,4.666666666666667
8118004,3,B000F6IIX0,"Be careful if ordering this in the U.S. - it is in the PAL DVD format that isn't compatible with standard players on this side of the pond.  It will play; however, you only get a portion of the picture and it is in black and white.  (And it's interesting navigating the DVD menu when you cannot see the options on the screen!)  It was a very nice movie otherwise, and I sure wish I could buy it in a format I could actually watch.",1324944000,32,430,4.035294117647059
8118005,3,B000F6IIX0,"Well the cover is the first misleading thing. It has a picture of the real James Herriot (Alf Wight) but there isn't even old footage of him. At the very least it would be nice to have his family say a snippet. I feel like Christopher Timothy is using this video as a portfolio of sorts. If you are interested in learning more about the author, I recommend sticking to his books and also the book written by his son (The Real James Herriot) is amazing! I wouldn't waste my money on this video if I had it to do over again. The music in this video is disturbing as well. It's reminds me of an 80's made for tv thriller movie when I hear the music.",1238457600,8,646,4.094488188976378
8118006,3,B000F6IIX0,"I found this beautiful video to be extremely frustrating and disappointing because Mr. Timothy mentions several times the interview he did of Alf White shortly before Mr. White's death, but we never get to see that interview.  At one point, it seems as if we will.  Mr. White is shown coming out to the garden, sitting down, and we're told that this is where the interview was done.  Then it's off to another location with Mr. Timothy and his friends!  As if we care about them -- I wanted to see Alf White!  Very annoying.  But the scenery, like I said, is lovely.",1224633600,8,565,4.436893203883495
