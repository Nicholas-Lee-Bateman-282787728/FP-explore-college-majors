8204621,4,B000S76NMO,"KDG was a childhood VHS rental that i, at the time, found boring as hell.  I was a thirsty young bloodhound back then, having already been exposed to dozens of slashers and splatter flicks from Europe.
But upon another viewing 22 years or so later, I no longer place this silly little revenge story into the worthless film catagory.  Perhaps maturity has prevailed, for I can appreciate the efforts of independent cinema.
The Sub Rosa DVD of Kiss Daddy Goodbye is the best transfer I've seen, and worth the 3.99 all day for those horror and zombie genre completists- you know who you are.  The average viewer may not enjoy the film for it lacks logic and the pace isn't explosive.
4 stars for authentic B movie content, and for a modest effort from Sub Rosa.",1447718400,,758,4.5588235294117645
8204622,3,B000S76NMO,"Cute little movie, made on a budget of $1.99.
More for my better half's Fabian collection.",1427587200,,90,4.6875
8204623,3,B000S76NMO,"Don't bother with this version of Kiss Daddy Goodbye. The film is presented widescreen (non-anamorphic) and windowboxed. I measured the picture on my 55"" Samsung and its only 25"" wide and 20"" tall. Zooming does not fill the screen on a 16:9 TV. There is plenty of black band still left on the side (besides the picture looking horrible blown up) even when in zoom mode. I almost wished it were full frame so you would get a ""bigger"" picture. This 1.90 transfer is over cropped!! I cannot get past how little the video image is compared to most of the screen is black!!
This is the R-rated 93 minute version (disregard the NC-17 rating posted on Amazon).
Would love to see Code Red or Scorpion Releasing release a proper ""watchable"" version of Kiss Daddy Goodbye because I really like this movie, but not what is presented here.",1414454400,,827,4.594594594594595
8204624,1,B000S76NMO,I was disappointed in this product because there was only 62 minutes of a 92 minutes movie on the DVD I received. The ending is missing.,1385078400,,136,4.269230769230769
8204625,5,B000S76NMO,"this film is yet another hidden jewel in the horror movie classics, I remember this movie as a child and it always creeped me out but good, the character miss dennis you might remember as sally in the very first texas chainsaw massacre.",1369785600,,236,4.511627906976744
8204626,2,B000S76NMO,"This movie isn't really anything special. Really. I'm strangely attached to it simply because Elvira showed it frequently on Movie Macabre when I was a kid and for whatever reason I thought it was the greatest movie then. The acting is stiff and awful; the lines cheesy (deptuty, i am in your custody, says the tall blonde); the DVD has no extras; if you want to select a scene you've literally got only four choices; the picture quality isn't the best, but this is an old, not much reveared movie, so it's not likely they'd put a lot into film restoration. The plot's interesting enough - two twins with special powers witness their father's murder and bring him back to zombie life to exact revenge in a clumsy manner, and for some strange reason I like this movie. If you can get it dirt cheap (i found it for $3 at a used booktore), give it a whirl. It'll at least make you laugh in some places. But don't spend a lot on this. I don't know if $8 is even cheap enough. Oh hell, throw caution to the wind and grab it. :)",1155168000,3,1022,4.27319587628866
