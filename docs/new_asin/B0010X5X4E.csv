8239031,5,B0010X5X4E,"I've never seen anything quite like this moving documentary about the Italian Americans of Federal Hill.
The stories told by each interviewee were touching and familiar as I too experienced so much of the same..either personally or from my own parents shared memories.
And the food...all of us can relate to the connection with all the wonderful food....Love of family and food go hand and hand....that ""bond"" deep and fundamental...( the seven fishes history/stories are great!)
This film brings it all together.
Background music is perfectly introduced and added is the benefit of viewing the musicians themselves as they play.
This is a must see for all Italian Americans.
( great gift idea for the older set..)",1274745600,2,714,5.111111111111111
