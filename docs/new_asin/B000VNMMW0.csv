2946086,4,B000VNMMW0,"'Talk to Me' is a better-than-paint-by-numbers Hollywood biopic of DC-area DJ Ralph Waldo 'Petey' Greene.  I loved the the first-half of the movie.  I'd pay to watch Don Cheadle read the phone book.  He's electric in the parts where he's formulating his post-prison career, breaking into the DJ-ing business and building bonds with the DC community.  Likewise, I'm a very big Chiwetel Ejiofor fan (if you saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pretty-Things/dp/B00018D3LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pretty Things</a>, you know why).  He, too, excels here, especially in the scene where he locks morning DJ Sunny Jim Kelsey (played by the underrated and always excellent Vondie Curtis-Hall) in his office in order to spring Cheadle's Green onto the air.  That's the movie's best scene.

Well, it's the best scene without Taraji P. Henson.  Taraji is a force of nature.  With apologies to Don Cheadle - one of the finest working actors today - Taraji rips the movie away from him whenever she's on the screen.  For those of you asking ""Where have I seen her before?"" - She's  'Shug' to Terrence Howard's Djay in Craig Brewer's 2005 masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hustle-Flow-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000BITUWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;- a brilliant meditation on the creative process.",1190419200,3,1435,6.3076923076923075
2946087,5,B000VNMMW0,"So saith the voice of Petey Greene the super-lunatic madman supreme of DC radio in the late 60s and early 70s that was as crazy as a fox! Don Cheadle and co. ressurect his story in ""Talk To Me.""

Our man is a foul-mouthed drunk ghetto street prophet who has radio show for his fellow inmates at a major prison. Dewey Hughes, a middle class radio exec, hears him but dismisses him upon their meeting as a ""miscreant"" (check your Websters'). Upon his release, our man and his floozy girlfriend, bumrush the radio station and embarrass the bourgie folks and white managers with their ghetto ways and loud profanity, but when Petey averts further rioting after MLK's murder, they realize that he really has something to say and the wild ride begins!

The film deals with a number of issues, such as classism in Black America, ghetto and prison conditions, and what really makes someone a ""leader."" In a way, it's also inspiring in that it shows that even the most downtrodden and unrefined members of society who are often ignorned or seen as embarrassments may have something of value to contribute.

So what happens to Petey? Leave the kids at home, see the film and find out. You'll be glad that you took a trip to ""P-Town.""",1187136000,5,1223,4.60091743119266
2946088,5,B000VNMMW0,I just saw the movie and I LOVE IT! I'm already looking to put this movie on my Amazon wish list!!  Don Cheadle deserves some awards for this performance!!,1186099200,2,155,4.344827586206897
2946089,5,B000VNMMW0,"I had heard an hour long expose on the life of Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene and Dewey Hughes on National Public Radio and was fascinated by the story of their extraordinary partnership/friendship at WOL-AM radio. Arrested for armed robbery and handed a ten -year prison sentence,Petey becomes the disc jockey at Lorton Prison. Upon early release, Petey marches into WOL for a job. With Hughes reluctant help Petey becomes the voice and conscience for Black Americans on talk radio. He is soulful, insightful,many times drunk!...... Interesting story!

Well, this story has become a film to be reckoned with, and in the hands of acting greats Don Cheadle as Petey and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Hughes TALK TO ME is turned into the finest bit of on-screen time by two men this year. These two gentlemen KNOW how to handle their characters. Two finer performances, I dare say, will not be seen this year that are portrayed with such depth,skill and finesse. LET'S TALK OSCARS and GLOBES HERE!!!

 Actress Kasi Lemmons of EVE'S BAYOU fame has made an outstanding film .This gifted actress is also a gifted writer and director. She knows how to let a story unfold and implicitly trusts her stars to do the job naturally and with control.

Also featuring Michael Epps as Hughes' brother and Teraji henson as Petey's girlfriend, Vernell, This film is pure and seamless ensemble work at it's finest. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!",1184284800,29,1405,4.866108786610878

Don Cheadle is a very skilled actor, that I cannot dispute. Yet, for some reason, I wouldn't want to watch this again. Maybe because Petey Green was so flamboyant, it didn't seem real. Maybe because I get turned off when I meet jive-talkin' people like he was.  This is not a film I would love to watch again and again.",1421193600,,465,4.535714285714286

2946181,4,B000VNMMW0,"Superb acting comes from Don Cheadle, British talent Chiwetel Ejiofor and Taraji Henson in this biopic of a down-on-his-luck ex con who defies the odds and goes on to achieve the unimaginable and become a television personality and unlikely cult figure.

The film is set in the 1970s and is a low-key and a cozy account of the decade that really gives you a realistic feel for the times. I love everything about it -the music, the outfits- not to mention the jive-talking, which is good fun and hilarious. Yet at the same time the movie manages to be touching and nostalgic and really goes deep into the essence of the characters, the friendships and parternships in addition to the racial turbulence of the time, which manages not to overshadow the enjoyment of the movie. This is definately an underrated piece of art work by Kasi Lemmons as most quality and substance-based movies are these days, which is unfortunate. I watched it for the first time on a flight over the Atlantic and since then I've watched it 2 or 3 more times and still manage to be touched by characters and the acting. I would definately recommend it. Especially if you enjoy black period dramas in general- such as Ray (based on the story of Ray Charles). .",1279324800,,1233,4.63013698630137

This movie was phenomenal. Not knowing much of the background surrounding this film, I was pleasantly surprised with all the comedy laced throughout! What I found most memorable is the portrayal of the relationship/friendship/business partnership depicted between Petey Greene and Dewey Hughes. It is rare that you see such a strong and well-developed relationship between men. They chronicle the difficulties and challenges as well as the celebratory and great moments in a powerful and engaging way. Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor captured perfectly the dichotomy of Petey Greene and Dewey Hughes's relationship. They were truly the opposite of the other and yet one in the same. The performance of Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor is so compelling. I am not surprised by this because the caliber and capability of these fine actors has preceded them. The supporting cast I found wonderful as well from Blue Blazes (Martin Sheen) to Vernell Watson (Taraji P. Henson) to Nighthawk (Cedric the Entertainer). This film had great casting and great performances across the board.

This movie expertly captured what I have seen of the 60's and 70's in wardrobe and set design down to the little details. Did you see the key holder Dewey had when he locked Sunny Jim in his office? My mom had a similar one in black! That memory is from a child of the 80's. I love how everything blends into that period and is something that would fit. The director (Kasi Lemmons) and set designers did an exceptional job re-creating the riots that occurred after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. A city burning filled with violence that reflected the pain from the atrocity that took place. This piece of the film was very touching. The time period shift is also reflected in the appearance of the actors themselves. Vernell is a perfect example in just looking at the hairstyles alone. Her hair transforms from relaxed and styled in a beautiful up-do (mid 60's), to an Angie Davis-like afro perfectly coiffed (mid-late 60s), to outrageously huge (early-mid 70's) to permed waves (late 70's early 80's). And the threads follow the same beat, which is a wonderful progression to observe. The movement through time shifts flawlessly to the credit of the director, set and, wardrobe designers.

This movie has heart and a whole lot of SOUL!! I cannot forget the music that sets the tone of every scene in this film. The music helps evoke the spirit of the time and the people that are portrayed. This is an extremely well written, well performed, and well-directed film! I enjoyed this film immensely!",1256428800,2,2745,4.823779193205945

2946184,3,B000VNMMW0,I was expecting this movie to be a big-afro-wearin' 1960 fun time.  Then reality hit with a whole lotta drama and civil rights issues; too heavy for a Saturday night.  I guess the movie started out to be a very silly over-the-top flash back to the groovy 60s and took a sharp serious turn that I did not see coming.  I don't think there's anything funny about what happened back then and I didn't care for the comedic start and the dead serious finish.  Confused.  Perhaps the movie-makers wanted to reel the audience in with all of the silly stuff and then bop 'em on the head with what really went down back in those groovy 1960s? I guess I'll watch it again and take it more seriously from the start. It's worth a look and possibly a second,1244246400,,743,4.316546762589928

Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene was only a few months out of prison when, in 1966, he finagled his way into a job as D.J. at WOR, the premier soul station in the Washington D. C. area.  With his sometimes inflammatory rhetoric and fired-up delivery, Petey quickly became known as a ""truth teller"" and the ""voice of the people"" for the station's predominantly black listening audience.  It wasn't long before he was branching out into other areas of the entertainment industry including television and stand-up comedy.

For about the first hour or so, ""Talk to Me,"" directed by Kasi Lemmons, feels like a subdued and considerably lesser version of the far more animated ""Private Parts,"" but then, at about the midway point, the movie hits its stride with the death of Martin Luther King Jr. and Greene's on-air efforts to bring order to a city rent by anger and civil strife.  In many ways, Greene's need to always be true to himself and what he stood for prevented him from ever achieving true mainstream popularity, mainly because he refused to play by the rules set down by the middle-brow entertainment establishment (his abortive - nay disastrous - appearance on The Tonight Show is a highlight of the movie).

The ever impressive Don Cheadle slides effortlessly into the role of Greene, while Chiwetel Ejiofor is equally effective as Dewey Hughes, the man who gets Greene his first gig at the station.  It is their tumultuous and complex relationship - which often deals with the issue of just how ""assimilationist"" blacks were supposed to be at that time - that becomes the galvanizing force of the movie.

The temper of the era - spanning from 1966 to Greene's untimely death from liver cancer in 1984 - is effectively conveyed through a canny combination of newsreel footage and re-creations of key events of the time.",1228867200,,1829,4.839743589743589
2946189,3,B000VNMMW0,"This film has a very good first half, but the script falls apart in the 2nd half.  The dialogue is terrific and Don Cheadle is excellent.  However, the make-up applied to the actor for aged sequences for Dewey Hughes is awful and does the film a disservice.
Kasi Lemmons is a talented director (""Eve's Bayou"" is a classic), but the film wobbles when the wheels start to come off the script later in the film.",1221609600,,408,4.426666666666667
2946190,3,B000VNMMW0,"Director Kasi Lemmons (""Eve's Bayou"") tackles the true story of Petey Greene, the ex-con who became an immensely popular DJ, community activist, comedian and TV show host in the Washington D.C. market from the mid 1960s up until his death in 1984.

Don Cheadle (who co-produced) delivers another amazing performance, and grabs your attention from the get go, as we find Greene working his first DJ gig-broadcasting live and direct from the warden's office over a jailhouse P.A. system. Judging from his fellow inmates' reactions, it becomes clear that Greene has a natural gift, not only for being hugely entertaining, but perfectly articulating what his audience is thinking as well.

In 1966, Greene is released, and through a series of machinations (and sheer chutzpah) manages to ingratiate himself with Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor), program director of D.C. ""soul"" station WOL. Against his better judgment, Hughes puts his job on the line and gives the motor-mouthed hustler a shot in the air chair. Before long, Greene's daily delivery of candid ruminations on the social issues of the day and the urban black experience strikes a chord with the D.C. radio audience. The story then follows Greene's subsequent ventures into television, stand up comedy and social activism.

Unfortunately, the final third of the film gets bogged down in the type of biopic clich that has ultimately demoted other potentially great films into garden-variety banality (""Bird"" and ""Ray"" come to mind). The film is ultimately about yet another gifted performer squandering his or her potential through substance abuse and/or self sabotaging behavior. Haven't we suffered through enough of these predictable story arcs?

I would have liked to have seen a bit more attention to detail in the depiction of the radio station milieu. Let me confess upfront that this is a pet peeve because I have worked in the radio business since 1974, so I tend to get nit-picky about technical inaccuracies in radio-themed films. Oh, and by the way-if I see one more movie set at a radio station that features a scene where a DJ defiantly barricades himself inside the studio and continues to talk while Management and/or security guards struggle to force the door open, I'll rip off my headphones and run screaming into the sunset. It just doesn't happen (that often).

The supporting cast is good, particularly Taraji P. Henson, who portrays Greene's long suffering girlfriend, Vernell Watson, with much aplomb (and a nod to Pam Grier).  Cedric the Entertainer hams it up rather amusingly as late night DJ ""Nighthawk"" Bob Terry (recalling Venus Flytrap on ""WKRP""). Also with Martin Sheen, whose talents seem a bit squandered here as a cartoon character GM who gets to fume and sputter and pound the studio window whenever Greene's antics get too risqu and scream cornball lines like ""What in the blue blazes do you think you're doing!?"".

I want to stress however, that the film is worth watching for two major reasons. Cheadle and Ejiofor. They are both tremendously charismatic and talented actors, demonstrating an onscreen chemistry that I think could turn them into a Newman-Redford sized juggernaut, should they decide to work together again (with some better scripts, I hope).",1219881600,2,3255,5.130188679245283

Chiwetel Ejiofor's portrayal of Dewey Hughes is very strong, making you both like and dislike him at the same time. Taraji P. Henson (Petey's girlfriend, Vernell) was hysterical. I was laughing pretty much throughout the movie. You do have to listen closely...some of the jokes are subtle and take a few seconds to sink in. The music was also great.

2946193,5,B000VNMMW0,"As much as I normally shy away from biopics, this movie sounded so good I couldn't resist. A story that gives much-deserved credit to a man who just wants to shake things up and ends up (at least in part) changing the world is one I wanted to see. It sounds dramatic, and I may be exaggerating to a degree, but Petey Greene was a progressive leader and instrumental in many things, including the Civil Rights Movement.

Petey Greene was a radio personality who got his start as a DJ while in prison - on a ten-year sentence for armed robbery. Creative thinking and good behavior earned him a reduced sentence and passion and persistence got him a job in non-prison radio. Some of the rules bent slightly to keep Greene, a shock-jock who said whatever was on his mind, on the air.

Don Cheadle played Petey Greene. I never knew/saw/heard Petey Greene, but I think I am ok to make the blanket statement that if a movie were being made about my life, and Don Cheadle had the starring role, my story would be in capable hands. Petey Greene seemed to be a very passionate man, and the movie did a great job of showing his passion while still emphasizing the sense of responsibility he felt towards other people. I believe that he knew the power of his voice and he wanted to help people, which he was able to do.

Much like his life, the movie was a roller coaster of emotion. The humor was well-timed and the drama was never stale. While heart-breaking and tragic at times, Petey Greene's life is one that should be celebrated and Talk To Me pays homage to a man worthy of the recognition.

Petey Greene.  Regardless, director Kasi Lemmons' film is ambitious and provocative and well worth your time.  The film is also graced with terrific performances by it's leads, Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ojiofor.  Cheadle demonstrates once again his versatilty as an actor by tackling the profane but prophetic Greene.  Ojiofor's project reared Dewey Hughes serves as the audience's conduit to P-Town, desirous of the  mainstream yet seething with righteous anger against the same system that's kept him down.  Not the least, Taraji P. Henson gives an infectiously brassy turn as Greene's girlfriend.

And lots of it!  I believe Blanchard who has written a lot of scores (many Spike Lee movies) did the score for this in between the song cuts selected from that time period.

2946203,4,B000VNMMW0,"It seems impossible that years after the death of Martin Luther King we would still find a possibility of racism in this country. But instead of the racism once seen we now have a back and forth of prejudice coming from both sides of the coin. Each accuses the other of the same thing. This is not the color blind world envisioned by Dr. King. This is a truth that needs to be told. And it is truth that the film TALK TO ME is all about.

The film tells the story of two black men in the early 60s' who become friends and more. But more importantly it tells the story of Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene (Don Cheadle), a con and a hustler who made his way from prison inmate to radio show celebrity over the years. Petey's path crosses that of Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a young radio executive at a soul station in Washington, D.C.  Via Dewey's brother in prison, Petey attempts to con his way into a gig as a DJ.

Brash and explosive, Dewey resists Petey's natural charms but eventually sees that he has something, a spark that gets people to listen. In an audacious move, he brings Petey into the DJ booth and as they say, history is made. While the station owner at first sees nothing but problems, he also knows a hit when he sees the phone lines light up. Petey becomes the talk of the town, offering the phrase ""talk to me"" to each and every caller he puts on the air.

When Dr. King is assassinated, the town of D.C. begins to burn as many cities did that night. But it was the calming voice of Petey Greene that cooled down the violence in his town. Filled with anger and hurt, with fear and with pride in the goals of Dr. King, Petey rallies the black community to stop the rioting and to follow King's dream. While not everyone followed, many did resulting in less damage in D.C. than in many towns.

The story moves forward from Greene as the hero to the tale of the two men and how their goals and dreams build from this small radio station to an appearance on the Tonight Show. It is Dewey's long held dream but for Petey it is more than he can or even wants to handle and it results in a split.

But the split forces Dewey into finding his own voice to come out with. While he allowed Petey to say all of the things he couldn't bring himself to, he now finds that voice and pulls it out.

The back and forth between characters, the story of Petey and of Dewey, the drama of the times makes this film one that holds your attention from beginning to end. But more than anything is the performance of Don Cheadle that holds you in its grip. The entire ensemble works well, but Cheadle does what he does best, becoming the person he is portraying so well that you feel you aren't watching a performance but actually seeing that person.

TALK TO ME is a powerful film about race and ambition, friendship and the loss of the same, hopes and aspirations and settling for less. It is a drama that captures a time and those who lived through it. And it offers not only drama but entertainment as well. Give this one a watch.",1200700800,,3030,4.2665505226480835
2946204,4,B000VNMMW0,"The Kasi Lemmons-lensed ""Talk to Me,"" starring Don Cheadle as notorious shock jock and television personality Ralph ""Petey"" Greene, is an absorbing, way to spend two hours. A historical drama laced with sharp doses of comedy, the film depicts the roller coaser ride of Greene's life and provides the perfect vehicle for the incredible Cheadle to sink his teeth into.

In mid-1960's Washington D.C. Greene is five years into a sentence at Lorto Reformatory for armed robbey and already infamous as the prison disc jockey when he crosses paths with Dewey Hughes, portrayed by the engaging Chiwetel Ejiofor, a representative of local AM radio station WOL who is leaving the facility after visiting his brother.

""Your brother said y'all need a new DJ at that radio station,"" Greene says to Hughes. ""Hey, I'm your man!""

""You're in prison,"" he replies.

""It's a minor challenge.""

Through smart maneuvering Greene is able to procure an early release, and persistence pays off when he lands his own radio program ""Rapping with Petey Greene,"" although he is under the watchful eye of station head E.J. Sonderling, played by Martin Sheen. Though initially fired for his dirty mouth and brazen manner, it soon becomes clear that he must be reinstated; the people have spoken, and he is their voice. When shocking events like the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. rock the city and bring the turbulent decade to a head, Greene is there to calm the sad, the angry and all in-between as his popularity continues on the upswing. With Hughes as manger and creative partner, will he savor his newfound position as local luminary, or grow too big for his own shoes?

Cheadle nails the role not only because he is an adept comedic actor but also because he knows how to navigate the dramatic nuances that possessed Greene at the height of his fame. His range is so vast yet his performance so natural that, like most good things, it is easy to take for granted. Ejiofor is pitch-perfect as Hughes, candidly displaying the humanity of a man so hell bent on achieving success and rising above his modest upbringing that he soon becomes blind to reason and, most significantly, where he came from. Sheen is also firmly in character as the bureaucratic yet benevolent Sonderling, and Taraji P. Henson is a delight as Greene's brassy girlfriend Vernell.

The film could be a solid 20 minutes shorter, and the few but notable historical inaccuracies peppered throughout the plot are needless, especially in these days of Google and Wikipedia. However, ""Talk to Me"" is still nonetheless wholly entertaining and even inspiring.

The film which tells the story of D.C. legend Petey Green managaes to be funny, heartwarming and dramatic and never falls into sterotypical black film cliches. Don Cheadle has never been better with his portyal of Petey Green. Cheadle is able to create a character ho can easily be felt while Chiwetel Ejiofor is brilliant in his role as Dewey Hughes . Talk To Me is a film that should have been given more due when released last summer ans hopefully the Oscar won't ignore Cheadle come Awards season.",1195776000,,567,4.461538461538462
2946213,5,B000VNMMW0,"""Talk to Me"" is absolutely captivating...draws you back in time effortlessly to the tumultuous 60's and 70's...and gives more credence to Don Cheadle as the present day ""Poitier"". This actor is incredible in his ability to engage your intellect and emotions. He is amazing in his portrayal of a street wise ex-con, who is true to his values, no matter the outcome. He becomes an unexpected hero in a time of mass rage and confusion and with discomforting nostalgia, reminds us of the huge social change encountered in the past few decades.

Mesmerized by this actor in Hotel Rwanda, impressed by the power of ""Reign Over Me"" and ""Talk To Me"" seals the deal of a Triple Crown Performance by Mr. Cheadle---not to overlook the brilliant performances by his co-stars, but Don truly has the energy and charisma to keep your attention soley on his performance...watch this movie!",1194912000,2,873,4.898648648648648
2946214,4,B000VNMMW0,"""Talk To Me"" is a fast moving biograpical film about the broadcasting career of comedian Petey Green. I'd never heard of Green until I saw this film, but I was fascinated by the way he took over the Washington D.C. airwaves on the night that Martin Luther King was killed. While that historic  night is only a short portion of the film, it showed Green's intelligence and influence. This film is  worth seeing by anyone who is studying this time period in American History.

Don Cheadle is hilarious and most of this film will keep you laughing out loud.",1194825600,,554,4.575757575757576
2946215,4,B000VNMMW0,"`Talk to Me' has to be one of the biggest surprises of 2007.  Hardly a blip on the radar, this film is emotionally engaging:  fun, funny, sad, and profound in many respects.  An inspiring true tale, the story revolves around D.C. D.J. ""Petey"" Green (Don Cheadle) who comes to shake up the nation's capital during the advent of the tempest's center during the sixties.  A self-described ""ex-con,"" and having a ""PhD,...for P.O.P.,..."" or ""p-----g off people,.."" ""Petey"" cleverly gets out of prison and takes an acquaintance to his word to hire him at Washington's flagging radio station, WOL.  Station head E.G. Sounderling (Martin Sheen) is tough and unyielding.  Countering his desire for ratings' number changes, he is, nevertheless, too cautious to do what's needed to make them realized. In his favor, he has the judgment to promote Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to program manager.  Once ""Petey"" is released from prison both men put all their money on one another as Dewey places him in a morning slot to shoot his mouth off and spin records.

""Petey"" gives big payoffs, but is a big risk to the station.  From there Dewey becomes his manager, and both have a chance at the top.  Booking dates from nightclubs to a local TV show, ""Petey"" lands a guest spot on `The Tonight Show'.  At this point the two friends and associates hold different priorities, ones that mold their futures as well as their friendship.  Dewey took many risks on ""Petey""'s behalf, but sometimes Dewey's controlling management style make him come off the way Col. Tom Parker did for Elvis.  ""Petey""'s struggle with alcohol and female fidelity (to girlfriend Winfred Watson with a wonderfully cast Taraji P. Henson) make his struggle more interesting, and his commentary during the tragedy of Dr. King's death give the whole biopic solid ground.

Besides a great performance by Cheadle, who in my mind flexes his acting chops and improved his repertoire from fine movies like 'Hotel Rwanda,' 'Crash' and the more recent 'Reign on Me,' the story and dialogue are marvelously engaging.  Supporting cast Ejiofor, Sheen, and Henson keep it all real.  (Guaranteed to produce both tears and laughter.)  (With a cameo role of Cedric the Entertainer as ""Nighthawk"" Bob Terry.)",1194393600,5,2246,4.994623655913978
2946216,4,B000VNMMW0,"""Talk To Me"" is the story of talk radio pioneer Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene and the program manager who gave him stardom in late-1960s Washington, D.C.. Petey (Don Cheadle) discovered his talent for talk and spinning records while doing time at Lorton Correctional Complex. Upon his parole, Petey seeks a job at WOL-AM, where program manager Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor) needs a morning drive DJ who is in touch with the ""real DC"". Petey's controversial debut doesn't sit well with station manager Mr. Sonderling (Martin Sheen), but his blunt talk and straight-up humor make Petey a local media sensation and inspire grander ambitions in Dewey.

""Talk To Me"" spans the duration of Petey Greene and Dewey Hughes' relationship, from 1966 to 1982. From Vernell's (Taraji P. Henson) psychedelic mini dresses to the riots that followed Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination, it's a trip back to late-1960s DC, where the film spends most of its time. Don Cheadle imbues Petey Greene with equal doses of spirited charisma and self-defeating habits. Chiwetel Ejiofor shines when Dewey Hughes is shattered. This script and Kasi Lemmons' direction are a little too tidy to seem entirely authentic. But it's a good story, and Taraji P. Henson is a scene-stealer.

The DVD (Universal 2007): Bonus features are 6 deleted scenes (8 1/2 min) and 2 featurettes. ""Who Is Petey Greene?"" (10 min) interviews the cast, producers, and director Kasi Lemmons about the real Petey Greene, Dewey Hughes and their relationship. ""Recreating P-Town"" (11 min) interviews producers Josh McLaughlin and J. Miles Dale about re-creating the 1960s-70s look, including the 1972 Tonight show and 1968 riots. Costume designer Gersha Williams, cast, and director talk about wardrobe. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, French.",1194307200,,1818,5.26551724137931

I have loved Don Cheadle's movies for years, but he might have outdone himself with this performance, he's sooo talented, versatile, and underrated as an actor.
The chemistry between Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor is unforgettable.  You will love the music in this film as well; don't be surprised if you find yourself singing along to the songs in this movie.
Recommend this movie to your friends.  I hope that it receives Oscar nominations, its too great of a film!",1194048000,,731,4.926829268292683

2946219,5,B000VNMMW0,"I picked this movie up at the video store, just on the strength of the two lead actors: the fabulous Don Cheadle (""Hotel Rwanda""), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (whom I loved as the cross-dressing footwear consultant in ""Kinky Boots"").  I'm amazed that I didn't see this picture in the theatres, and I can't figure out why.  Universal must not have given it a big publicity push or a wide release, which I think is unfortunate.  I certainly hope it does well on video.

This movie is a real flashback look back at the '60's and '70's.  The acting is wonderful - the two men play off each other very, very well.  One of them (Ejiofor with a totally believable accent - you'd never know he's a Brit) is an ambitious up-and-coming businessman, kind of a proto-yuppie from the Projects. The other (Cheadle) is an ex-con with a big mouth.  They grow together and grow apart through a tumultuous period in American (and especially Black American) history.

The look of this film is amazingly good.  The polyester print shirts with the big lapels, the brown-plaid-trousers-with-a-brown-jacket-suits, the pic'd out hair (Tamaji P. Henson sports an afro as large as Angela Davis').  Honestly, between her huge halo of hair and her chest-popping miniskirt outfits, she looks as though she has walked straight out of a black velvet painting.  There's a wonderful, wonderful sequence with Cheadle and Henson at home doing the watusi (or is that the slide? I forget). He is wearing day-glo blue underwear, and she is in bright orange hot pants (rememberhot pants?)  What a flashback fashion moment! It looked like so much fun that I almost got up and started dancing along myself.  But as someone who survived the '70's, I just had to shake my head in amazement and wonder where in the hell they got that crazy underwear.  Whoever did the costume work on this film had a whole lot of fun.

There are a lot of laughs in this picture but it's not a real ""comedy"", which may be why the studio didn't quite know how to market it.  There is a real bittersweet quality to the men's friendship toward the end, and the film does cover some very serious events (such as the riots surrounding the shooting of Marting Luther King, Jr.)

There's a lot of language - the usual ""n"" word, and a lot of ""m-f"" and so forth.  But that's the way these folks talked, so there you have it.  I have to say this picture was a wonderful surprise.",1193961600,,2400,4.604705882352941
3180583,4,B000VNMMW0,"'Talk to Me' is a better-than-paint-by-numbers Hollywood biopic of DC-area DJ Ralph Waldo 'Petey' Greene.  I loved the the first-half of the movie.  I'd pay to watch Don Cheadle read the phone book.  He's electric in the parts where he's formulating his post-prison career, breaking into the DJ-ing business and building bonds with the DC community.  Likewise, I'm a very big Chiwetel Ejiofor fan (if you saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pretty-Things/dp/B00018D3LE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pretty Things</a>, you know why).  He, too, excels here, especially in the scene where he locks morning DJ Sunny Jim Kelsey (played by the underrated and always excellent Vondie Curtis-Hall) in his office in order to spring Cheadle's Green onto the air.  That's the movie's best scene.

Well, it's the best scene without Taraji P. Henson.  Taraji is a force of nature.  With apologies to Don Cheadle - one of the finest working actors today - Taraji rips the movie away from him whenever she's on the screen.  For those of you asking ""Where have I seen her before?"" - She's  'Shug' to Terrence Howard's Djay in Craig Brewer's 2005 masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hustle-Flow-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000BITUWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;- a brilliant meditation on the creative process.",1190419200,3,1435,6.3076923076923075
3180584,5,B000VNMMW0,"So saith the voice of Petey Greene the super-lunatic madman supreme of DC radio in the late 60s and early 70s that was as crazy as a fox! Don Cheadle and co. ressurect his story in ""Talk To Me.""

Our man is a foul-mouthed drunk ghetto street prophet who has radio show for his fellow inmates at a major prison. Dewey Hughes, a middle class radio exec, hears him but dismisses him upon their meeting as a ""miscreant"" (check your Websters'). Upon his release, our man and his floozy girlfriend, bumrush the radio station and embarrass the bourgie folks and white managers with their ghetto ways and loud profanity, but when Petey averts further rioting after MLK's murder, they realize that he really has something to say and the wild ride begins!

The film deals with a number of issues, such as classism in Black America, ghetto and prison conditions, and what really makes someone a ""leader."" In a way, it's also inspiring in that it shows that even the most downtrodden and unrefined members of society who are often ignorned or seen as embarrassments may have something of value to contribute.

So what happens to Petey? Leave the kids at home, see the film and find out. You'll be glad that you took a trip to ""P-Town.""",1187136000,5,1223,4.60091743119266

With Hughes reluctant help Petey becomes the voice and conscience for Black Americans on talk radio. He is soulful, insightful,many times drunk!...... Interesting story!

Well, this story has become a film to be reckoned with, and in the hands of acting greats Don Cheadle as Petey and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Hughes TALK TO ME is turned into the finest bit of on-screen time by two men this year. These two gentlemen KNOW how to handle their characters. Two finer performances, I dare say, will not be seen this year that are portrayed with such depth,skill and finesse.

3180678,4,B000VNMMW0,"Superb acting comes from Don Cheadle, British talent Chiwetel Ejiofor and Taraji Henson in this biopic of a down-on-his-luck ex con who defies the odds and goes on to achieve the unimaginable and become a television personality and unlikely cult figure.

The film is set in the 1970s and is a low-key and a cozy account of the decade that really gives you a realistic feel for the times. I love everything about it -the music, the outfits- not to mention the jive-talking, which is good fun and hilarious. Yet at the same time the movie manages to be touching and nostalgic and really goes deep into the essence of the characters, the friendships and parternships in addition to the racial turbulence of the time, which manages not to overshadow the enjoyment of the movie. This is definately an underrated piece of art work by Kasi Lemmons as most quality and substance-based movies are these days, which is unfortunate. I watched it for the first time on a flight over the Atlantic and since then I've watched it 2 or 3 more times and still manage to be touched by characters and the acting. I would definately recommend it. Especially if you enjoy black period dramas in general- such as Ray (based on the story of Ray Charles). .",1279324800,,1233,4.63013698630137

This movie was phenomenal. Not knowing much of the background surrounding this film, I was pleasantly surprised with all the comedy laced throughout! What I found most memorable is the portrayal of the relationship/friendship/business partnership depicted between Petey Greene and Dewey Hughes. It is rare that you see such a strong and well-developed relationship between men. They chronicle the difficulties and challenges as well as the celebratory and great moments in a powerful and engaging way. Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor captured perfectly the dichotomy of Petey Greene and Dewey Hughes's relationship. They were truly the opposite of the other and yet one in the same. The performance of Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor is so compelling. I am not surprised by this because the caliber and capability of these fine actors has preceded them. The supporting cast I found wonderful as well from Blue Blazes (Martin Sheen) to Vernell Watson (Taraji P. Henson) to Nighthawk (Cedric the Entertainer). This film had great casting and great performances across the board.

This movie expertly captured what I have seen of the 60's and 70's in wardrobe and set design down to the little details. Did you see the key holder Dewey had when he locked Sunny Jim in his office? My mom had a similar one in black! That memory is from a child of the 80's. I love how everything blends into that period and is something that would fit. The director (Kasi Lemmons) and set designers did an exceptional job re-creating the riots that occurred after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. A city burning filled with violence that reflected the pain from the atrocity that took place. This piece of the film was very touching. The time period shift is also reflected in the appearance of the actors themselves. Vernell is a perfect example in just looking at the hairstyles alone. Her hair transforms from relaxed and styled in a beautiful up-do (mid 60's), to an Angie Davis-like afro perfectly coiffed (mid-late 60s), to outrageously huge (early-mid 70's) to permed waves (late 70's early 80's). And the threads follow the same beat, which is a wonderful progression to observe. The movement through time shifts flawlessly to the credit of the director, set and, wardrobe designers.

This movie has heart and a whole lot of SOUL!! I cannot forget the music that sets the tone of every scene in this film. The music helps evoke the spirit of the time and the people that are portrayed. This is an extremely well written, well performed, and well-directed film! I enjoyed this film immensely!",1256428800,2,2745,4.823779193205945

3180681,3,B000VNMMW0,I was expecting this movie to be a big-afro-wearin' 1960 fun time.  Then reality hit with a whole lotta drama and civil rights issues; too heavy for a Saturday night.  I guess the movie started out to be a very silly over-the-top flash back to the groovy 60s and took a sharp serious turn that I did not see coming.  I don't think there's anything funny about what happened back then and I didn't care for the comedic start and the dead serious finish.  Confused.  Perhaps the movie-makers wanted to reel the audience in with all of the silly stuff and then bop 'em on the head with what really went down back in those groovy 1960s? I guess I'll watch it again and take it more seriously from the start. It's worth a look and possibly a second,1244246400,,743,4.316546762589928

Almost no movie made in the last decade is just funny the whole way through, least of all one based upon such serious circumstances.  I was nervous, thinking, oh lord, here we go, they're going to ruin this movie by overdramatizing everything, just like they always do.  But: SURPRISE!  They introduced drama that was believable, and compelling on a human level.  They don't attempt to make Petey and Dewey out to be saints, thus keeping their characters authentic and real.

Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene was only a few months out of prison when, in 1966, he finagled his way into a job as D.J. at WOR, the premier soul station in the Washington D. C. area.  With his sometimes inflammatory rhetoric and fired-up delivery, Petey quickly became known as a ""truth teller"" and the ""voice of the people"" for the station's predominantly black listening audience.  It wasn't long before he was branching out into other areas of the entertainment industry including television and stand-up comedy.

For about the first hour or so, ""Talk to Me,"" directed by Kasi Lemmons, feels like a subdued and considerably lesser version of the far more animated ""Private Parts,"" but then, at about the midway point, the movie hits its stride with the death of Martin Luther King Jr. and Greene's on-air efforts to bring order to a city rent by anger and civil strife.  In many ways, Greene's need to always be true to himself and what he stood for prevented him from ever achieving true mainstream popularity, mainly because he refused to play by the rules set down by the middle-brow entertainment establishment (his abortive - nay disastrous - appearance on The Tonight Show is a highlight of the movie).

The ever impressive Don Cheadle slides effortlessly into the role of Greene, while Chiwetel Ejiofor is equally effective as Dewey Hughes, the man who gets Greene his first gig at the station.  It is their tumultuous and complex relationship - which often deals with the issue of just how ""assimilationist"" blacks were supposed to be at that time - that becomes the galvanizing force of the movie.

The temper of the era - spanning from 1966 to Greene's untimely death from liver cancer in 1984 - is effectively conveyed through a canny combination of newsreel footage and re-creations of key events of the time.",1228867200,,1829,4.839743589743589
3180686,3,B000VNMMW0,"This film has a very good first half, but the script falls apart in the 2nd half.  The dialogue is terrific and Don Cheadle is excellent.  However, the make-up applied to the actor for aged sequences for Dewey Hughes is awful and does the film a disservice.
Kasi Lemmons is a talented director (""Eve's Bayou"" is a classic), but the film wobbles when the wheels start to come off the script later in the film.",1221609600,,408,4.426666666666667
3180687,3,B000VNMMW0,"Director Kasi Lemmons (""Eve's Bayou"") tackles the true story of Petey Greene, the ex-con who became an immensely popular DJ, community activist, comedian and TV show host in the Washington D.C. market from the mid 1960s up until his death in 1984.

Don Cheadle (who co-produced) delivers another amazing performance, and grabs your attention from the get go, as we find Greene working his first DJ gig-broadcasting live and direct from the warden's office over a jailhouse P.A. system. Judging from his fellow inmates' reactions, it becomes clear that Greene has a natural gift, not only for being hugely entertaining, but perfectly articulating what his audience is thinking as well.

In 1966, Greene is released, and through a series of machinations (and sheer chutzpah) manages to ingratiate himself with Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor), program director of D.C. ""soul"" station WOL. Against his better judgment, Hughes puts his job on the line and gives the motor-mouthed hustler a shot in the air chair. Before long, Greene's daily delivery of candid ruminations on the social issues of the day and the urban black experience strikes a chord with the D.C. radio audience. The story then follows Greene's subsequent ventures into television, stand up comedy and social activism.

Unfortunately, the final third of the film gets bogged down in the type of biopic clich that has ultimately demoted other potentially great films into garden-variety banality (""Bird"" and ""Ray"" come to mind). The film is ultimately about yet another gifted performer squandering his or her potential through substance abuse and/or self sabotaging behavior. Haven't we suffered through enough of these predictable story arcs?

I would have liked to have seen a bit more attention to detail in the depiction of the radio station milieu. Let me confess upfront that this is a pet peeve because I have worked in the radio business since 1974, so I tend to get nit-picky about technical inaccuracies in radio-themed films. Oh, and by the way-if I see one more movie set at a radio station that features a scene where a DJ defiantly barricades himself inside the studio and continues to talk while Management and/or security guards struggle to force the door open, I'll rip off my headphones and run screaming into the sunset. It just doesn't happen (that often).

The supporting cast is good, particularly Taraji P. Henson, who portrays Greene's long suffering girlfriend, Vernell Watson, with much aplomb (and a nod to Pam Grier).  Cedric the Entertainer hams it up rather amusingly as late night DJ ""Nighthawk"" Bob Terry (recalling Venus Flytrap on ""WKRP""). Also with Martin Sheen, whose talents seem a bit squandered here as a cartoon character GM who gets to fume and sputter and pound the studio window whenever Greene's antics get too risqu and scream cornball lines like ""What in the blue blazes do you think you're doing!?"".

I want to stress however, that the film is worth watching for two major reasons. Cheadle and Ejiofor. They are both tremendously charismatic and talented actors, demonstrating an onscreen chemistry that I think could turn them into a Newman-Redford sized juggernaut, should they decide to work together again (with some better scripts, I hope).",1219881600,2,3255,5.130188679245283
3180688,5,B000VNMMW0,"This is a great movie-one of the best I have seen in years. You are just riveted by the story and waiting for the next thing Petey Green (Don Cheadle) is going to say. You also can't wait to see how other people in the story react to Petey, because that is always funny. Chiwetel Ejiofor's portrayal of Dewey Hughes is very strong, making you both like and dislike him at the same time. Taraji P. Henson (Petey's girlfriend, Vernell) was hysterical. I was laughing pretty much throughout the movie. You do have to listen closely...some of the jokes are subtle and take a few seconds to sink in. The music was also great. This is NOT for kids: very bad language and a couple pretty steamy scenes.",1217635200,2,695,4.4375
3180689,5,B000VNMMW0,This was an excellent movie. I can watch this over and over again. Don pulls you into this movie.  It also brings out a lot of history and things that black people don't want to talk about any more.,1213660800,3,198,4.076923076923077
3180690,5,B000VNMMW0,"As much as I normally shy away from biopics, this movie sounded so good I couldn't resist. A story that gives much-deserved credit to a man who just wants to shake things up and ends up (at least in part) changing the world is one I wanted to see. It sounds dramatic, and I may be exaggerating to a degree, but Petey Greene was a progressive leader and instrumental in many things, including the Civil Rights Movement.

Petey Greene was a radio personality who got his start as a DJ while in prison - on a ten-year sentence for armed robbery. Creative thinking and good behavior earned him a reduced sentence and passion and persistence got him a job in non-prison radio. Some of the rules bent slightly to keep Greene, a shock-jock who said whatever was on his mind, on the air.

Don Cheadle played Petey Greene. I never knew/saw/heard Petey Greene, but I think I am ok to make the blanket statement that if a movie were being made about my life, and Don Cheadle had the starring role, my story would be in capable hands. Petey Greene seemed to be a very passionate man, and the movie did a great job of showing his passion while still emphasizing the sense of responsibility he felt towards other people. I believe that he knew the power of his voice and he wanted to help people, which he was able to do.

Much like his life, the movie was a roller coaster of emotion. The humor was well-timed and the drama was never stale. While heart-breaking and tragic at times, Petey Greene's life is one that should be celebrated and Talk To Me pays homage to a man worthy of the recognition. I really liked this movie.",1213056000,,1612,4.420875420875421

They'll get him to play a pimp or something slimy, and then everybody will start gushing and come with the rewards. What a waste. But, Brother, you keep coming with the quality parts.

3180692,4,B000VNMMW0,"Screen biographies are tough to pull off.  How do you compress a man's life into an acceptable timeframe and still capture their essence?  That's th enigma of ""Talk to Me"".  For the first hour or so the film teeters on greatness.  The film's second half seems rushed like they were trying to jam all the details of the subject's life, revolutionary Washington D.J. Petey Greene.  Regardless, director Kasi Lemmons' film is ambitious and provocative and well worth your time.  The film is also graced with terrific performances by it's leads, Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ojiofor.  Cheadle demonstrates once again his versatilty as an actor by tackling the profane but prophetic Greene.  Ojiofor's project reared Dewey Hughes serves as the audience's conduit to P-Town, desirous of the  mainstream yet seething with righteous anger against the same system that's kept him down.  Not the least, Taraji P. Henson gives an infectiously brassy turn as Greene's girlfriend.

For me it was only a 3 star movie BUT in the last few scenes and the closing song is some of the most spectacular trumpet playing (on the soundtrack)I've ever heard by Terence Blanchard.  And lots of it!  I believe Blanchard who has written a lot of scores (many Spike Lee movies) did the score for this in between the song cuts selected from that time period.

Blanchard's trumpet playing is all over the last part of this movie... kindof a cross between Freddie Hubbard and the late Don Ellis, using electronic effects and building climax after climax.

beyond that, the characters in the film are complex, well developed... the scriptwriting and acting aren't over the top, but still engaging enough to entertain...  and the film has a very convincing and authentic look that makes you feel like you're in the era, rather than watching a bunch of cliche'd images...

Any great movie captures the emotions of that time as this one did. Love watching the birth of trend setters, too. This character was smooth and abrasive at the same time. That's an enjoyable quality to witness. Petey stuck to his guns throughout a life filled with controversy. He never wavered. That's admirable. When the two main characters acknowledge what their friendship means to each other, it's powerful. A friend had been trying to get me to watch this for months.

These two actors portrayed the unlikely friendship between Petey Greene and Dewey Hughes to perfection! A great supporting cast including Cedric ""The Entertainer"" and Martin Sheen only adds more depth. The most poignant scene of the film was definitely the riots after the King assasination. If I believed in such a thing as channeling I would have thought Cheadle channeled Greene himself. Hilarious...Moving....Downright fantastic!

3180700,4,B000VNMMW0,"It seems impossible that years after the death of Martin Luther King we would still find a possibility of racism in this country. But instead of the racism once seen we now have a back and forth of prejudice coming from both sides of the coin. Each accuses the other of the same thing. This is not the color blind world envisioned by Dr. King. This is a truth that needs to be told. And it is truth that the film TALK TO ME is all about.

The film tells the story of two black men in the early 60s' who become friends and more. But more importantly it tells the story of Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene (Don Cheadle), a con and a hustler who made his way from prison inmate to radio show celebrity over the years. Petey's path crosses that of Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a young radio executive at a soul station in Washington, D.C.  Via Dewey's brother in prison, Petey attempts to con his way into a gig as a DJ.

Brash and explosive, Dewey resists Petey's natural charms but eventually sees that he has something, a spark that gets people to listen. In an audacious move, he brings Petey into the DJ booth and as they say, history is made. While the station owner at first sees nothing but problems, he also knows a hit when he sees the phone lines light up. Petey becomes the talk of the town, offering the phrase ""talk to me"" to each and every caller he puts on the air.

When Dr. King is assassinated, the town of D.C. begins to burn as many cities did that night. But it was the calming voice of Petey Greene that cooled down the violence in his town. Filled with anger and hurt, with fear and with pride in the goals of Dr. King, Petey rallies the black community to stop the rioting and to follow King's dream. While not everyone followed, many did resulting in less damage in D.C. than in many towns.

The story moves forward from Greene as the hero to the tale of the two men and how their goals and dreams build from this small radio station to an appearance on the Tonight Show. It is Dewey's long held dream but for Petey it is more than he can or even wants to handle and it results in a split.

But the split forces Dewey into finding his own voice to come out with. While he allowed Petey to say all of the things he couldn't bring himself to, he now finds that voice and pulls it out.

The back and forth between characters, the story of Petey and of Dewey, the drama of the times makes this film one that holds your attention from beginning to end. But more than anything is the performance of Don Cheadle that holds you in its grip. The entire ensemble works well, but Cheadle does what he does best, becoming the person he is portraying so well that you feel you aren't watching a performance but actually seeing that person.

TALK TO ME is a powerful film about race and ambition, friendship and the loss of the same, hopes and aspirations and settling for less. It is a drama that captures a time and those who lived through it. And it offers not only drama but entertainment as well. Give this one a watch.",1200700800,,3030,4.2665505226480835
3180701,4,B000VNMMW0,"The Kasi Lemmons-lensed ""Talk to Me,"" starring Don Cheadle as notorious shock jock and television personality Ralph ""Petey"" Greene, is an absorbing, way to spend two hours. A historical drama laced with sharp doses of comedy, the film depicts the roller coaser ride of Greene's life and provides the perfect vehicle for the incredible Cheadle to sink his teeth into.

In mid-1960's Washington D.C. Greene is five years into a sentence at Lorto Reformatory for armed robbey and already infamous as the prison disc jockey when he crosses paths with Dewey Hughes, portrayed by the engaging Chiwetel Ejiofor, a representative of local AM radio station WOL who is leaving the facility after visiting his brother.

""Your brother said y'all need a new DJ at that radio station,"" Greene says to Hughes. ""Hey, I'm your man!""

""You're in prison,"" he replies.

""It's a minor challenge.""

Through smart maneuvering Greene is able to procure an early release, and persistence pays off when he lands his own radio program ""Rapping with Petey Greene,"" although he is under the watchful eye of station head E.J. Sonderling, played by Martin Sheen. Though initially fired for his dirty mouth and brazen manner, it soon becomes clear that he must be reinstated; the people have spoken, and he is their voice. When shocking events like the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. rock the city and bring the turbulent decade to a head, Greene is there to calm the sad, the angry and all in-between as his popularity continues on the upswing. With Hughes as manger and creative partner, will he savor his newfound position as local luminary, or grow too big for his own shoes?

Cheadle nails the role not only because he is an adept comedic actor but also because he knows how to navigate the dramatic nuances that possessed Greene at the height of his fame. His range is so vast yet his performance so natural that, like most good things, it is easy to take for granted. Ejiofor is pitch-perfect as Hughes, candidly displaying the humanity of a man so hell bent on achieving success and rising above his modest upbringing that he soon becomes blind to reason and, most significantly, where he came from. Sheen is also firmly in character as the bureaucratic yet benevolent Sonderling, and Taraji P. Henson is a delight as Greene's brassy girlfriend Vernell.

The film could be a solid 20 minutes shorter, and the few but notable historical inaccuracies peppered throughout the plot are needless, especially in these days of Google and Wikipedia. However, ""Talk to Me"" is still nonetheless wholly entertaining and even inspiring.

Look for Cheadle to garner an Oscar nod this coming Tuesday.",1200528000,7,2675,4.928888888888889

Sadly, though it becoming the case for those who have gone on as such is the case on this movie. (The upcoming The Great Debaters is a real close second); Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene, who was a native of Washington D.C. spent most of his life in jail, but he had the gift of gab and a following at Lorton Penetentiary with a show of his own. Dewey Hughes, would have never heard of him if he wasn't in prison visiting his brother who tells him about Petey; TO keep him off his back and hoping he'll never be released, Hughes tells him to look him up once he's released, which he does. Hughes after some reluctance gets him on the air, and in turn becomes the voice of black D.C. The halves become a whole with Hughes guiding Petey's career with his own tv shows, stand up comedy and even a shot on Johnny Carson(Dewey's hero) becoming very successful. A great period piece. One thing that stands out in the movie is when Dewey tells Petey that he tells the things he can't say, but Dewey does the things Petey won't. More like the ying and the yang that worked out very well. One interesting tidbit.

Top to bottom, every one in the cast is superb - especially Taraji P. Henson as the girlfriend and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the best friend/mentor.  It is difficult, I think, to tell the story of a con-man and get you to like him.  Everyone involved was able to do just that.  This film has everything you go to the movies for.  It has humor, drama, pathos, and human interest.  My one quibble is I found some of the language used jarring.  However , given the context, this was necessary.

Mesmerized by this actor in Hotel Rwanda, impressed by the power of ""Reign Over Me"" and ""Talk To Me"" seals the deal of a Triple Crown Performance by Mr. Cheadle---not to overlook the brilliant performances by his co-stars, but Don truly has the energy and charisma to keep your attention soley on his performance...watch this movie!",1194912000,2,873,4.898648648648648

3180712,4,B000VNMMW0,"`Talk to Me' has to be one of the biggest surprises of 2007.  Hardly a blip on the radar, this film is emotionally engaging:  fun, funny, sad, and profound in many respects.  An inspiring true tale, the story revolves around D.C. D.J. ""Petey"" Green (Don Cheadle) who comes to shake up the nation's capital during the advent of the tempest's center during the sixties.  A self-described ""ex-con,"" and having a ""PhD,...for P.O.P.,..."" or ""p-----g off people,.."" ""Petey"" cleverly gets out of prison and takes an acquaintance to his word to hire him at Washington's flagging radio station, WOL.  Station head E.G. Sounderling (Martin Sheen) is tough and unyielding.  Countering his desire for ratings' number changes, he is, nevertheless, too cautious to do what's needed to make them realized. In his favor, he has the judgment to promote Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to program manager.  Once ""Petey"" is released from prison both men put all their money on one another as Dewey places him in a morning slot to shoot his mouth off and spin records.

""Petey"" gives big payoffs, but is a big risk to the station.  From there Dewey becomes his manager, and both have a chance at the top.  Booking dates from nightclubs to a local TV show, ""Petey"" lands a guest spot on `The Tonight Show'.  At this point the two friends and associates hold different priorities, ones that mold their futures as well as their friendship.  Dewey took many risks on ""Petey""'s behalf, but sometimes Dewey's controlling management style make him come off the way Col. Tom Parker did for Elvis.  ""Petey""'s struggle with alcohol and female fidelity (to girlfriend Winfred Watson with a wonderfully cast Taraji P. Henson) make his struggle more interesting, and his commentary during the tragedy of Dr. King's death give the whole biopic solid ground.

Besides a great performance by Cheadle, who in my mind flexes his acting chops and improved his repertoire from fine movies like 'Hotel Rwanda,' 'Crash' and the more recent 'Reign on Me,' the story and dialogue are marvelously engaging.  Supporting cast Ejiofor, Sheen, and Henson keep it all real.  (Guaranteed to produce both tears and laughter.)

3180713,4,B000VNMMW0,"""Talk To Me"" is the story of talk radio pioneer Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene and the program manager who gave him stardom in late-1960s Washington, D.C.. Petey (Don Cheadle) discovered his talent for talk and spinning records while doing time at Lorton Correctional Complex. Upon his parole, Petey seeks a job at WOL-AM, where program manager Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor) needs a morning drive DJ who is in touch with the ""real DC"". Petey's controversial debut doesn't sit well with station manager Mr. Sonderling (Martin Sheen), but his blunt talk and straight-up humor make Petey a local media sensation and inspire grander ambitions in Dewey.

""Talk To Me"" spans the duration of Petey Greene and Dewey Hughes' relationship, from 1966 to 1982. From Vernell's (Taraji P. Henson) psychedelic mini dresses to the riots that followed Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination, it's a trip back to late-1960s DC, where the film spends most of its time. Don Cheadle imbues Petey Greene with equal doses of spirited charisma and self-defeating habits. Chiwetel Ejiofor shines when Dewey Hughes is shattered. This script and Kasi Lemmons' direction are a little too tidy to seem entirely authentic. But it's a good story, and Taraji P. Henson is a scene-stealer.

The DVD (Universal 2007): Bonus features are 6 deleted scenes (8 1/2 min) and 2 featurettes. ""Who Is Petey Greene?""

3180716,5,B000VNMMW0,"I picked this movie up at the video store, just on the strength of the two lead actors: the fabulous Don Cheadle (""Hotel Rwanda""), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (whom I loved as the cross-dressing footwear consultant in ""Kinky Boots"").  I'm amazed that I didn't see this picture in the theatres, and I can't figure out why.  Universal must not have given it a big publicity push or a wide release, which I think is unfortunate.  I certainly hope it does well on video.

This movie is a real flashback look back at the '60's and '70's.  The acting is wonderful - the two men play off each other very, very well.  One of them (Ejiofor with a totally believable accent - you'd never know he's a Brit) is an ambitious up-and-coming businessman, kind of a proto-yuppie from the Projects. The other (Cheadle) is an ex-con with a big mouth.  They grow together and grow apart through a tumultuous period in American (and especially Black American) history.

The look of this film is amazingly good.  The polyester print shirts with the big lapels, the brown-plaid-trousers-with-a-brown-jacket-suits, the pic'd out hair (Tamaji P. Henson sports an afro as large as Angela Davis').  Honestly, between her huge halo of hair and her chest-popping miniskirt outfits, she looks as though she has walked straight out of a black velvet painting.  There's a wonderful, wonderful sequence with Cheadle and Henson at home doing the watusi (or is that the slide? I forget). He is wearing day-glo blue underwear, and she is in bright orange hot pants (rememberhot pants?)  What a flashback fashion moment! It looked like so much fun that I almost got up and started dancing along myself.  But as someone who survived the '70's, I just had to shake my head in amazement and wonder where in the hell they got that crazy underwear.  Whoever did the costume work on this film had a whole lot of fun.

There are a lot of laughs in this picture but it's not a real ""comedy"", which may be why the studio didn't quite know how to market it.  There is a real bittersweet quality to the men's friendship toward the end, and the film does cover some very serious events (such as the riots surrounding the shooting of Marting Luther King, Jr.)

There's a lot of language - the usual ""n"" word, and a lot of ""m-f"" and so forth.  But that's the way these folks talked, so there you have it.  I have to say this picture was a wonderful surprise.",1193961600,,2400,4.604705882352941
