8094609,4,B000BZ8IEE,"I bought this series before it came out as a complete collection so I can't comment on the quality of those collections, only on the series as a whole.  This is one of the many very good anime's in my collection.  I originally rented a copy of the first disc and thought it was a nice lite fan service show.  When I later found a used copy of disc 4, I bought it thinking that it would be a fun disc to watch every once in awhile.  What I got was a surprise.  It turned out that this was a whole lot more that a bunch of fan service.  There was actually a good sci-fi story line here with several twists that makes one question who is friend or foe and who is truly strong.  This is an easy on the eyes series that despite its many twists and turns has a very satisfying ending.  There are a handful of nude scenes, plenty of pantie shots and well endowed women (though not the football sized breasts you find in shows like Misaki Chronicles and Gravion).  Still this is probably not ideal show for young children.  It is however a good show that can be watched and enjoyed more than once.

The one problem I had was that there are only 3 episodes on each disc.  This was the same on the first complete collection, I'm not sure about the S.A.V.E. collection.",1325808000,,1258,4.174273858921162
8094610,4,B000BZ8IEE,I've seen Kiddy Grade on one of my Dish Network stations and really liked it.  So I ordered some of the DVD's. I was very impressed with the amimation and the sound and picture quality--I would recommend the series to any anime fan out there--I like the series very much.,1206748800,2,271,4.42
