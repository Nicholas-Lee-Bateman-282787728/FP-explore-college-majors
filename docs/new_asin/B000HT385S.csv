8141147,1,B000HT385S,"I think the other reviewers must have been watching a different movie. How this ever won ""Best Horror Film"" at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival is a mystery to me. Critics often like quirky stuff. The film looks and feels homemade and hokey. A B-movie even by family home-movie standards. Poor sound and camera quality. Weak script and mostly weak acting. Don't waste your money or time on it. On IMDb it scored 2.4 out of ten from 150 reviewers. That is closer to the truth, although I would still call it generous.",1447200000,,546,4.639175257731959

8141149,4,B000HT385S,"Though it was like watching a live action horror movie, I enjoyed it.  It looked like a movie made with a video camera.  Pretty bloody and had a good story line.  The acting wasn't that great, but not bad for some.  I haven't seen this movie in a while, so I am a little fuzzy on some of the parts.  I can't name the characters off hand, but the story was about some friends that were out having fun.  One of the girls came in with a guy she met and introduced him to her friends.  After deciding to go back to their apartment, that's when terrible things began to happen.  Don't want to tell too much, so I'll end it right here.  Rent it if its available, then decide if its worth buying.",1319932800,,689,4.082089552238806
8141150,4,B000HT385S,"Fairly well done for an ultra low budget thriller. The acting is not top notch, and the story is predictable, but it's the execution and pace of the story and effects that drive this neat little thriller. It made me jump in a few places.

If this can be done with hardly and budget, I'd like to see a movie from this director with a big budget.",1187481600,4,344,4.134328358208955
