5665199,5,B00BQ1S3N8,I was very happy to receive this.  I have wanted it for my kids for a long time.  Quick delivery... looking forward to watching them.,1384387200,,133,4.28
5665200,5,B00BQ1S3N8,"Any time I let me son pick a video at the library, this is always the first series he goes to! He's 5 now and he's been watching choosing these for the past year and a half at least! He will be so excited when we give him the full series for the holidays this year!!",1379289600,3,266,3.767857142857143
5665201,5,B00BQ1S3N8,"THe series itself is fabulous and my children are learning so much.
However the DVDs skip (the result of poor production from amazon???) which is disappointing.",1375747200,4,160,5.1923076923076925
5665202,5,B00BQ1S3N8,"My kids ages 6 & 8 absolutely love these shows. They are interesting for adults to watch as well. We discovered PMK at the library but, they only had a few episodes. I decided to buy the entire collection on Amazon. It's too bad this program is no longer on TV. Kids benefit from watching shows like this!",1372464000,16,305,4.275862068965517
5665203,5,B00BQ1S3N8,"Julie

My kids love this video series. For the last year we keep checking out Popular Mechanics for Kids Dvd's from the library.
We did not even know there were this many available. Keeps the kids minds working even while watching Tv.
 I actually say ""yes"" when they ask to watch a video.
Many times, my 8 year old will come up with a bit of information that seems way beyond his age; when I ask him where that came from, it is more often than not, Popular Mechanics for Kids.

Not just for boys. Hosts are girls and boys, investigating everything from horses to electricity to where water goes when you fluch it, in a very kid-centric way.

Highly recommended. Well worth the cost.",1370563200,3,682,4.432
5665204,5,B00BQ1S3N8,"My 7-year old discovered these DVDs at the library when he was five, and he's been watching them religiously ever since. He's a science lover, and these videos are both fun and educational. We were thrilled when they finally released the entire set and would highly recommend them for curious kids. Parents are likely to learn something too!",1370217600,4,341,4.896551724137931
5665205,5,B00BQ1S3N8,"First found one of the DVD episodes at our local library. Yes, he (then 3) picked it because it had a fireman on the cover...  He loves the content of each disc he's seen and both my husband and I like watching it with him.. pretty informative and funny.. for all of us.  (I do insert ""please don't try this at home, they're professionals"" from time to time for him.)
He is really learning alot from this series.. as am I.

What does he learn?  all kinds of things!  common sense, scientific thinking, concept of safety, lots of science, don't panic if you get lost/ stay calm, how to look at, get an understanding of what might appear scary from creatures, the ocean, the night, etc.. to the fascinating and fun... space, monster trucks, flying, animal world, pirates, water, robots, etc.

Some of the episodes do mention death (wear a seatbelt, etc.).  I wondered if he could handle this.. but it's not overly focused on, just mentioned because it really is part of the aim of what they're trying to prevent with say safety belts for instance.  Just mentioned in case  you need to take this into account with your child.

Might be good for kids who'll like Myth Busters when a little older.

Just covers so many topics and I think all this knowledge empowers him and makes him feel great..  he wants to see them more than anything else..  (He actually doesn't do that much viewing... even days with no screen time needed (gasp!)  when we're on adventures - even the backyard kind)

Too bad the show only had four seasons!

Note:  We haven't watched all of the episodes (70 +?)  but will let you know if anything else to note!  Enjoy.",1369180800,32,1635,4.5

5665213,5,B00BQ1S3N8,We don't let our kids watch too much t.v. so we got rid of cable years ago and started buying DVDs that fit into our lifestyle. We homeschool and try to only get wholesome and or educational  entertainment.  These videos may be one of the only things we allow them to binge watch! They love the kids as well as seeing the exciting adventures they go on. I can actually stand to watch them repeatedly along with my kids. I would highly recommend them to anyone wanting to learn about  a large variety of new things. The pictures show all the episodes to give you a better idea of what they are about. Hope that helps,1465776000,7,615,4.2844827586206895

5665218,3,B00BQ1S3N8,"Our 6 year old LOVES this show, and I was happy to let him watch it since it is (for the most part) educational. I'd argue that point since many things are presented as fact instead of theory. Regardless, it's a good show. But today I heard the female character on the show tell the young boy, ""you suck."" You can't name a show ""for kids"" and have the children on it speak that way to each other. It's just not okay. I wasn't happy to have to explain that phrase to our 6 and 4 year olds.",1463616000,20,488,3.989795918367347

5665223,5,B00BQ1S3N8,"We purchased these DVDs for a road trip and I am extremely satisfied.

Each DVD has about five episodes. Each episode has a new topic that captures the attention of everyone. Great overviews with interesting content that were suitable for my 5 and 7 year olds.

I was tired of the kids watching cartoons and nonsense in the backseat while we traveled, and wanted something that would keep them engaged. This definitely fits the bill. In fact, my husband and I couldn't see the DVDs while sitting in the front seats, but they were interesting enough for us to listen in!

Four cases with DVDs that state the content of each DVD within (multiple DVDs for each season.)",1459209600,5,666,4.627118644067797

Great for kids and you don't have to worry about looking over their shoulder to make sure it's appropriate.  Videos are well done and just silly enough and short to keep their attention.  Appropriate ages would be about 5-9 years. Younger ones might not understand all the concepts but will find it funny (slapstick style).  So glad I found the complete set.",1449532800,,524,4.542553191489362

This series doesn't run on TV anymore, so this set of DVDS is a goldmine that will offer educational entertainment for many years as kids watch it again and again. The teenage hosts make kids aspire to be like them (confident, outgoing and fun) and with up-close, real-life encounters, it's very different from other sources of science education.",1397174400,2,619,4.6880733944954125

5665287,4,B00BQ1S3N8,"This is worth it for the price. It has a lot of silliness in it, but basically introduces kids to the world in various ways. Not as good/ scientific as myth-busters, which is way better. They like this pretty well though, and the price is right. Probably ages 5 - 12",1392163200,,266,4.235294117647059

5665293,5,B00BQ1S3N8,"I know, I know - people hate hearing this sentiment, but it is true - they just don't make television like they used to! Kids shows is no exception. Popular Mechanics for Kids is a great show for kids in the 6 - 12 age range. The kid hosts do all sorts of fun adventures as they learn the inner workings of a wide range of science topics. The topics are great because they answer questions kids would rally be interested in, as well as show them various careers and happenings many kids may not even know exist. Their expert Charlie also has great projects kids can try at home as well (how cool to try and make your own fire extinguisher - just for fun, kids are warned to never try to use it to actually put out a fire). Overall, would definitely recommend for hours of fun and learning for kids.
The series is a bit dated (ran from 1997 - 2001), but most of the science is still solid. Some of the fun is finding things they mentioned were ""going"" to happen and see if they came to fruition (i.e. the International Space Station and their predictions on electric cars).
Also, if the main girl host seems a bit familiar, she went on to play the daughter of Jack Bauer in the television show ""24"".",1388275200,12,1198,4.258771929824562
5665294,3,B00BQ1S3N8,"We bought this for nieces for Christmas. Came back to buy it for as another gift two weeks later to find that Amazon jacked up the price by over $20. Now at $53.95 it is actually about the same price to buy each of the seasons separately. So if the price remains the same, consider just buying just the first one or two seasons to see if you/your kids like it before investing in the other seasons.

I ordered this set so he can watch not only at home but when we travel where there's no Wi-Fi.  My son is 8 and loves them.  He's watched them over and over.  In one recent episode he watched Elisha was showing/doing a sleep study, which was perfect timing when he watched it, as he was doing a sleep study a few days later.  Much easier to explain what was going to happen to him as he watched the episode.  He wasn't as nervous.  I've even used some of the quick science stuff with my cub scout den.",1496793600,,667,4.030534351145038
