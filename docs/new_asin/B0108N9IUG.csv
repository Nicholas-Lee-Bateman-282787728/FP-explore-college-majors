8721648,1,B0108N9IUG,I never write reviews but I wanted you to know this movie was awful. I think the 5 star ratings were from people who made the movie. Do not waste you or your kids time. Kissing was inappropriate for young kids. And overall a stupid movie with lack of ending. Ugh!,1476576000,,263,4.176470588235294
8721649,5,B0108N9IUG,"My 10 year old LOVED this movie.  It was a new take on an old set of monsters.  The story incorporated peer pressure and how to deal with it as well as sending the message that ""it is okay to be different"".  At least as a mom, that is what I saw.  My son saw cool monsters and the bully getting his due.  With all the cookie cutter Halloween specials out there, this one broke the mold and kept my kid laughing.",1446422400,,411,3.9634146341463414
8721650,4,B0108N9IUG,"W2onderfully entertaining. I am not a kid by any means but I do love my cartoons and animation. This is a Canadian effort that succeeds on a lot of levels. Entertaining, wonderful story and just plain good. Our 3 main kids, Gunner the werewolf, Franky the monster and young Dracula play a prank in evil school and get tossed out to human school! they have to fit in or else! Gunner is kind of dumb, franky is the suave ladies monster and Drac is the brains.",1445817600,,457,4.325581395348837
