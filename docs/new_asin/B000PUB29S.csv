2828204,3,B000PUB29S,"This is a very good DVD if you're new to yoga and would like to learn about some of the basic therapeutic poses. There is a list of each of the poses that you can pick in the menu, or just play them all. Desiree gives in explanation of each pose before showing it. For beginner's this is great, but was a bit boring for me. I was hoping for less camera talk and more practice. In most cases she shows beginner level, but for the thigh stretch on the floor, she goes to the extreme which I don't think is appropriate for beginner demonstration. You will however get some great tips and instruction that you don't get on other yoga DVD's.

BTW, I think the other reviews prior to mine seem to be plugging this DVD ;o)",1195689600,8,715,4.181159420289855
2828205,4,B000PUB29S,"Desiree Rumbaugh, Yoga to the Rescue

This is anusara teacher-extraordinaire Desiree Rumbaugh's first video offering.  Workshops with Desiree are always fun and challenging.  Even though she's good at giving everyone a door into the practice, the sessions I've had with her have been somewhat yoga-goes-to-the-circus.  In any event it was a bit of a surprise for me to see that her first video is therapeutic in approach and is such a good one too.  Desiree illustrates very clearly how the home practitioner can build strength and increase flexibility safely, as well as work toward healing injuries, physical imbalances etc..

Yoga to the Rescue is definitely geared toward the beginning practitioner, but I'm a long-time practitioner who has completed teacher training and have still been using parts of this vid in my home practice. She reminds me to do stuff I don't like to do but should, like toe-breaker (although I wish she had spent more time in this one) and she has interesting ways of doing some standard poses. I have to say her way of presenting reclining twist, as more of a shoulder stretch than a core strengthening completely changed the way I approach that pose. Isn't it strange how a simple thing can make such a big difference.

There's some really nice forward bend stuff. She shows it done with toes elevated (that anusara/Iyengar stand by) to help PF and then with hands clasped behind you to open the shoulders. You don't often find really detailed instruction in forward bend and it's nice to see it here.

Again, if you're looking for fast flow you won't find it in Rescue.. You won't find dancey. It's just solid foundation stuff -- even to the natural curve of the lumbar spine. If you've taken a lot of anusara classes, as I have, you'll be familiar with most of this material -- but I still found some surprises.

I like that it really does start with the head and end with the feet by the way - a real change of yoga pace.

I realize not everyone uses videos like I do. I get most of my non-self-generated yoga from my regular classes.  I use media in pieces, worked into my own home practices. I often deviate from the video instruction or pose and I often stop the player so I can insert an inversion practice, or some arm balances or some wheels...or whatever. And I'm not into flow, except the one I follow in my own head.  Rescue is well-chaptered so it's ideal for adjusting to individual needs.  However, I've done it a couple of times as designed and it works fine that way too.

The production is attractive.  Desiree appears a little stiff at times, but no big deal.  The music sucks - wish there were a music-off option (something I think all yoga, pilates etc vids should have) so I could play my own.  The video contains about 50 yoga minutes.  Desiree's solid base of training and experience (anusara and Iyengar) inform her practice and her teaching.",1194739200,49,2899,4.662082514734774
2828206,4,B000PUB29S,Good video for the price.  Pose sequence is easy to follow.  A newcomer will benefit from the explainations for each pose; but it would be good if a more experienced user could skip through those.,1194566400,10,196,4.571428571428571
2828207,5,B000PUB29S,"As a newbie to the world of yoga, and a person who has already had back surgery, I am thrilled to have found Desiree Rumbaugh's Yoga to the Rescue. Though I do attend yoga classes, Desiree's calm and encouraging nature helps me practice at home and allows me to more fully understand how yoga can help me maintain a strong back for my lifetime. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is hesitant to try yoga because of previous injury.

2828221,5,B000PUB29S,"This yoga DVD is very different from most that I have bought.  It is less like a workout DVD and more like a visit from a yoga physical therapist.  Desiree Rumbaugh outlines a series of different yoga poses and shows how they can be used to treat a variety of physical problems that we get from modern life.  Most of the poses are familiar (warrior, triangle, etc...); however, she goes into greater depth about how to do the pose properly.  She does not rush, and she gives each pose a complete description.  She shows positions for the more advanced student and she has a guy who shows the beginner poses.  This DVD would be good for any age or any level.  Desiree Rumbaugh is a very pleasant and understandable guid to yoga!",1388275200,5,727,4.462121212121212

2828223,4,B000PUB29S,"I highly recommend this DVD if you are suffering from poor posture, back pain/strain, rotator cuff pain, carpal tunnel syndrome. This is not your typical 30 minute stretch or workout but a more thorough and targeted stretching and strengthening DVD. This is not a flowing yoga stretch routine, as you'd think or do at the local yoga center, but rather a segmented yoga stretch for specific body parts.  The instructor breaks and opens a new segment for each new stretch and teaches why and how each stretch benefits your body. I've done it one time...ONE!...and already my lower back pain has relief. I'm also on my computer keyboard all day every day and there's instruction for wrist and arm stretches to relieve carpal tunnel.",1359417600,,729,4.879032258064516
2828224,5,B000PUB29S,"I've had a seriously, stiff neck for 5 years, so much so, that I tended to move my whole upper body when glancing right or left, instead of just turning my neck.  The shoulder and shoulder blade problems started when I was removing wallpaper and painting walls and have lasted over 3 1/2 years now.  The pain has been intense and intractable.  Various specialists diagnosed me with ailments such as myofascial pain syndrome and tendonitis, and sent me to a pain therapist because they were concerned that I might commit suicide.  One pain specialist told me there was nothing they could do for me!  Oxycodone, Oxycontin, Morphine, nothing worked. I've been to chiropractors, acupuncturists, pain clinics, physical therapy, water therapy, deep muscle massage while doped up on lots of pain killers, anti-depressants, and muscle relaxers. Are you getting the idea that I've been trapped in my own hell for a long time now?

Six weeks ago, I found the neck and shoulder exercises from ""Yoga to the Rescue"" from Comcast On Demand and tried slowly and tentatively, the ""neck strengthening"" floor exercise twice and my stiff neck disappeared!  It just stopped!

I was so excited that I did the ""wall stretch"" exercise for my shoulders and the pain eased. I immediately ordered the DVD and now every day I do those two exercises even if I do not have time for the entire video, and the pain eases a little bit more.

When I do more than my beat-up upper body can handle and I start to feel sore, I find a place to do a quick version of the exercise I need and get immediate partial or total relief and go out and try to catch up with my long-neglected life again.

Thank you, Desiree,

Cheryl",1345680000,4,1685,4.63973063973064
2828225,5,B000PUB29S,I have been struggling with a herniated disc for 5 years.  I was surprised by how little pain I had after the first time of performing the moves.  IT was amazing.  I would recommend this to anyone struggling with injuries or wanting to get fit.  I can tell a difference[[ASIN:B000PUB29S Yoga to the Rescue - Feel Good from Head to Toe],1343692800,,335,4.442622950819672
2828226,3,B000PUB29S,"I'm relatively new to yoga, practicing less than one year and found this to be an ok stretching video. The title indicates that it would be a soothing yoga practice but it is not. As other reviewers have stated, it's very choppy, there is no transition from pose to pose - at one point you're on the floor on a mat, blank screen, at the wall for an arm stretch, blank screen and then back at the mat, on the floor. Lots of standing, sitting, standing, laying, standing - not relaxing or restorative at all. Even I found some of the cues to be sort of weird - like the groin thing another reviewer mentioned - but I attributed that to my novice state. It's nothing I couldn't get past.

That being said, if you want to get your stretch on, this might be a useful video for specific stretching and she does give some good intro pose modifications to help deepen your commitment to the poses. Desiree is pleasant enough, definitely lovely to watch.",1284595200,2,945,4.4
2828227,5,B000PUB29S,was recommended by my yoga teacher and is a great simple yet effective set of exercises.. ideal for beginner and fine for intermediate too,1284336000,,138,4.791666666666667

2828229,2,B000PUB29S,"If you're looking for a flowing work-out, this is not the DVD for you.  This is actually a series of stretches with explanations for how each one works and is very disjointed.  If you're accustomed to Vinyasa or Ashtanga yoga, you will be as disappointed as I was.  There's no actual work-out, just the demonstration of stretches.  Definitely not well suited for experienced yoga practioners.",1255824000,4,392,4.984615384615385
2828230,5,B000PUB29S,"I bought this DVD because I've slowly realized that lower back pain is not necessarily due to stress created on the lower back alone. Hips, shoulders, and thighs can also be culprits to low back pain--in fact it's quite likely these areas of the body may be more linked to pain than you think.

This video is awesome because Desiree addresses these areas of the body in such clear language. It is, as advertised, a ""gentle DVD"" and not an entire practice, but it truly offers a ""heed to toe"" good feeling after wards. I would recommend it to anyone suffering from back, knee, shoulder, and foot pain. For ten dollars, it's far less expensive than a physical therapy session or a yoga class---and you can watch it over and over again! Plus, if you are a regular yoga practitioner, you will be able to use these alignment principles in your practice! It's a DVD that beginners will benefit from and experienced yogis will learn from!",1248307200,5,931,4.608433734939759
2828231,3,B000PUB29S,"I always look for DVD's that give me an entire workout I can do at home. This is not that. There is also absolutely no flow to this; it feels quite choppy. There are just a lot of poses that are simply presented one after the other as remedies/help for various types of pain.

I will say there are some really good stretches in here, and they are done in creative and helpful ways. The instructor is pleasant enough, which is the difference between watchable and not to many people.

My issues with this DVD are that, as other reviewers have said, she gives instructions like ""widen your groins"" and she also tells you to do things ""organically"" in several places. I have no idea what she's talking about, and I've been practicing yoga about 12 years.

The reason I say this could have been great is I feel she could have created a real yoga practice. Instead, it's something I will probably never use again due to far too much talk, baffling instructions and a complete lack of continuity. The poses fade from one to another (blank screen in between) and are completely disconnected from one to the next. There is at least one spot where you have just done a seated pose and now find yourself climbing to your feet to do a standing pose. If she had just included transitional poses...

I would recommend borrowing this from the library before buying if you want a yoga workout DVD. If you just want some good, creative stretches for specific issues then you will probably find this useful.",1212192000,4,1490,4.5278810408921935
2828232,5,B000PUB29S,"What an amazing DVD. I've done it twice, and both times I've noticed I've felt really great afterwards, like I do after taking an Anusara class.

Desiree Rumbaugh seems friendly to me, not stiff, but perhaps nervous about the camera which is normal. Her voice over is soothing to me. She does very well with details, she knows how stretches work on the anatomy of the body & the planes of movement & rotation of muscles & bones. She uses both western/medical/anatomy teaching/cues as well as spiritual ""lift the heart up"" (just mean to raise the chest) cues which made it very easy to follow. This is the greatest part besides the beautiful production. Since I haven't done yoga in over a week or so, I was tighter then normal so this was a great time to try something light. I did not like the order of the poses/stretches. They felt odd to me & I would do other stretches instead while pausing. There were two forward bends & two of the same reclined spinal twists. Though she gives great details, even in a popular seated spinal twist, she didn't remind that the twist should be focused in the waist/stomach area, not the neck/shoulders to avoid injury & get a greater stretch.
Though this is geared to beginners & those with limitations, seeing a full bow & bridge surprised me as those would be the hardest for those with limitations. Some of the poses she did are innovative & I enjoyed, but if she's trying to open up the hips, I'm surprised there were no butterfly, sitting fwd bends, cobra for the back, etc. I'm not sure if she was trying to be different by not including those since they are in almost all yoga dvds, if she was, then she should have made it 2 or 3 shorter workouts & incorporate those to really great full opening of the hips.
I would love to see her doing an intermediate yoga dvd workout.

You can see the trailer above or also see home videos of her teaching an advanced anusara yoga class.",1202774400,6,3300,4.828621908127208
2828234,2,B000PUB29S,"It sounded like a good way to ease into yoga with my muscles being so tight.  And the positions are great!  However, the hostess does and intro for each pose and goes on and on about it and there is no alternative way to watch the DVD.  I wanted to hear the intros a couple times and then play the poses without all the chatter after I'd learned them.",1202428800,6,351,4.057971014492754
2828235,5,B000PUB29S,"I love Desiree Rumbaugh for all the reasons that come across when you watch her DVD.  She cares about her students and puts a great deal of energy into finding the right balance in each pose between strength and flexibility - and the right mental balance between effort and softening/surrender in each pose.  Carefully designed to work with the breath and in proper alignment, her yoga asanas and the exercises she has developed to help in yoga practice are clearly explained and demonstrated by both herself and her partner (who takes modified versions of the asanas).  I suggest watching the DVD once through before trying to watch and practice at the same time.  Her adjustments are sometimes subtle and her instructions are important, so it's worth taking the time with the DVD and with your practice.  I highly recommend both ""feel good from head to toe"" and ""back pain.""  These are excellent DVD's.

For the days you are not in the mood for a strong practice, but you would like to coach yourself.  A good suggestion for teachers as well. There are important points that are not often brought to the surface, such as retaining the curves, or keep bringing life to painful ares. Desire Rumbaugh sounds sometimes like advertising something, but I overcome it easily and I like her. Her body conveys the instructions in a very clear way.",1200182400,5,523,4.602150537634409
2828237,4,B000PUB29S,"Yoga teacher Desiree Rumbaugh has created a DVD that is designed for both new and seasoned yoga practioners.  Its aim is not to provide us with a practice to follow, but rather it offers a discreet series of yoga poses that can help with typical and specific body problems.  There are eleven poses that are divided into ""chapters"", so the viewer can work with any or all of the poses as needed.  These can easily be integrated into a regular practice, or can be used to help those new to yoga begin to refine their practice.

The main idea here is that ""yoga shouldn't hurt"", and the directions and language guides us to go to challenging, but not hurtful places in our practice.  I like that she is very clear that many of the benefits of yoga occur over time and indeed, progress takes time.  Modifications for most poses are included, making them accessible to just about anyone.  A unique and helpful DVD!",1198972800,7,909,4.539877300613497
2828238,3,B000PUB29S,"I  bought this DVD on the strength of Sharon's review, as I always respect her views.  I tried it last night, and found it very good but also very spotty.  I do't think it's really aimed at most beginners.  To be honest, her language would probably throw most yoga beginners.  How many of us know how to interpret ""Raise and widen your groins""?  there's a lot of this type of language, which sometimes baffles me a little - and I've been practising different types of yoga for many years now and have a huge library of books and DVDs....
Something I really don't like is the unevenness of timing.  The inner shoulder stretch for instance is held for a very short time on the first side and then a relatively long time on the other side.  This happens in other segments, to the extent that I would replay a segment and work opposing sides.  And the long explanations/introductions re benefits etc of the upcoming poses eat into pose time and could have been integrated into the actualy posture segments - this is done a few times, but not enough.

Anyway, I see this as a great dvd for someone who's practised a while, and can take what they need from it and adapt to their own practise.  I shan't be using this as a whole again, but I will integrate things I've picked up into my own sessions.  Beginners would need to watch this a couple of times before trying it, because there are times when it would be difficult and harmful to watch the DVD.",1196812800,30,1446,4.394736842105263
