1248195,5,B000021Y6R,"I am a Team Rocket and Psyduck fanatic, and while watching some of the other tapes, they didn't have much of either. This tape however, has three episodes that were my favorites. In the first episode, The Bridge Bike  gang, It shows the history of Team ROcket. Adn Psyduck is in it alot! In  Ditto's Mysterious Mansion, Ash, Misty Brock and Duplica (Ditto's trainer)  dress up as Team Rocket, which was hilarious. And in the Pikachu episode,  Team Rocket almost gets away with the pikachu! After the first tape, This  one is a great beginners tape and I recommend it to any PokeFanatic!",944870400,2,586,4.650485436893204

7915159,5,B000021Y6R,I just started watching the series again.  I haven't watched it in about 5 years so I'm a little behind.  But i wenr to a bookstore to look for some pokemon/digimon vhs/dvds and I found this video for $2.98.  I bought it took it home and watched it.  This video definetly brought back memories of when i watched it when it was about a year old.  Now I think I'm back on the craze.  This video has three episodes.  I won't describe them because there is already a description for it on amazon but I will tell you they are all good.  This is defenetly worth getting for your collection.  Next I will look for some more videos and the pokemon movies.  I still have only seen the first movie.  Anyway buy this video. It's cool,1115424000,,722,4.235294117647059

7915161,4,B000021Y6R,"I'm such a sentimental slob.  When I saw the Pokemon episode ""Pikachu's Goodbye"" I was crying by the time it ended!  It was so emotional and well-done, bringing up close just how much Pikachu's trainer, Ash, really loves him and, in the end, does what he thinks will be right for his little yellow pal.  (Don't worry - the episode ends happily.)  It's the best feature on this DVD, though the other two are good as well, particularly the episode with Ditto.  Very action-packed, with all the usual gang present, journeying through life and learning about the wonderful world of Pokemon.  Thumbs up!",983664000,3,598,4.757281553398058

But they meet up with more rivals then Jessie and James along the way! Then they meet a Ditto Master whoes Ditto is having trouble imitating faces. Who will help this Ditto? Team Rocket also tries to steal Ditto. Includes a very funny vursion of Team Rocket's motto. Are these Ash and Pikachu's last days together?
