8747842,2,B01AO2RCE0,"This would have been an utterly mediocre three-star show, except that it's also a really bad musical. The terrible music and lyrics had a tendency to ruin any scene that threatened to be dramatic and interesting.

The characters are pretty clich and most of them have no depth at all. The romantic interest was the most boring of the potential suitors, and we don't actually see any romance. They're in love because the writers say so, not because it makes any sense. Heck, Ritsuka's brother is a better choice as a boyfriend!

The main plot is so-so -- which for me means three-star -- but everything else is in one-star territory so I figure it balances out at two. I would not recommend this to anyone but the most undiscerning fan of paranormal romance, but just about everything else is better, so why bother?",1485820800,,814,4.645833333333333
