4491767,5,B004X4O988,"I ordered this documentary and I gathered a whole ton of knowledge about myself and other cultures of people. This movie is highly positive and speaks upon what black people in America really need to do. This movie explains that black people are more than slaves, and more that Malcolm X wanted to find out and share to the people of this continent. I honestly recommend this movie for every black person on this world, white people can also watch this movie and learn this history, asian people too! When you learn more about yourself, you can become a better person and step your game up to a 100%! The instructors in the movie have a lot of references about what they're saying, I highly challenged anyone to debate these professors it seems like they have the knowledge game locked down!",1305244800,17,791,4.617021276595745

I had the great fortune of seeing the movie in the theater and had to view the DVD 3+ more times to process all the historical knowledge presented in this film. Beware, this film will lead you to seek more in depth information, so be prepared to spend extra time in your local library or doing your own research on the internet.",1305072000,315,511,4.389473684210526
4491769,5,B004X4O988,"First off.. I donated to have the movie made.  I have absolutely no regrets about doing so.  I even attended the Sneak Preview (Premiere) in Atlanta. It was awe inspiring.

This movie changed my life. It opened so much history up I was on damn near information overload. I was afraid to go to the bathroom because I thought I would miss something.  This is a must buy for any and everyone who would like to learn African's contribution to the World.  The two hours was clearly not enough. I enjoyed Brother Umar droppin science about the effects of Slavery and Sister Shahrazad Ali frankness as well as Tariq's matter of factness.  All scholars truly represented.

I bought two copies as well as put countless others (Facebook, friends) on to it. I gave all my friends a money back guarantee.. If they didn't like it I would give them their money back.. To this day, no one has been disappointed and I am positive you wouldn't be either.

So forget the person who wrote the negative review and cop this dvd.  YOU WILL ENJOY!",1305072000,20,1024,4.521739130434782
4491770,5,B004X4O988,"Many people of color, African Americans in particular, have been indoctrinated with a European centered education. This film exposes the theft of our true history as the original people of Earth. One thing I wish they would have talked about was irrefutable proof of that Africans circumnavigated the earth well before Europeans. How else could the Great Pyramid of Giza be located exactly in the center of the land masses of Earth?

The film is great for all ages. My wife and kids enjoyed it thoroughly. We can't wait for part 2!",1305072000,160,531,4.771739130434782

4491772,5,B004X4O988,"This movie is a must-see and must-have!  It sheds some light on the vast history of the aboriginal peoples of the earth who are undoubtedly Black (aka Moor).  From America to Asia, this movie thoroughly explains that the indigenous people of every land mass of this planet are the dark skinned woolly-haired people who are despised today due to misinformation put out by the cave-dwelling, barbaric racial supremacists.  All racists will cringe in fear when they find out this movie is in circulation.  They will probably step up their racist attacks, verbal and physical, against people of Moorish descent because they can't handle the truth and the fact that they are not who they claim to be and neither are we.

4491775,1,B004X4O988,"TO AMAZON REVIEWERS: WHY IS THIS NOT THE ""TOP CRITICAL REVIEW?"" THE ONE YOU PUT IN THAT CATEGORY IS VERY WEAK. THIS REVIEW POINTS OUT SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE FILM NO OTHER REVIEWER SEEMS TO NOTICE.

I co-founded an organization that does anti-bias work in my community, and a friend who thought Id be interested in this DVD loaned it to me. When I grew up, history books made you think the only people who made any contributions to the world were white, so a DVD about black contributions was of interest. Unfortunately, the parts of the film that I was able to research, or already had knowledge of, left me uncertain about what in the film is accurate and what is not. I will give a few examples.

(41:02+ = starting at 41 min. & 2 sec. into the film) We know for a factall the cathedrals built in England, the island of England, were built by the Moors. There were Moors in England but the Moors were associated with the Middle Ages  centuries ago. We certainly don't think of Moors as being around in modern times. If you research English cathedrals on the web, you will a problem with the DVDs statement I just quoted. For example, that there are 30 cathedrals in the Providence of Canterbury that were built between 597AD and 1965AD  a period of over 1,000 years. The idea that Moors were still building cathedrals in England in 1965 is not correct. And I could not find evidence that they ever built any in England.

(52:10+) The Bonampak tribe, that was a group of aboriginal people living in the Mexico area. If you go down to Mexico and you look at these murals [they painted] you can see the Bonampak tribe clearly have African features, African nose, lips, hair. This is also easy for you to verify for yourself. First of all, I have visited Bonampak and seen its murals and to refer to Bonampak as an aboriginal tribe is not at all accurate. If you do any research on the ancient Mayans (and there are plenty of books and web sources) it will be obvious that Bonampak was a powerful Mayan city-state that was part of a great civilization. Yes, the Mayans had dark skin from living in the jungle, but they did not have African hair or facial features as is evident when you see todays descendants of the ancient people. If you look carefully at the murals shown in the film, you will see people with long hair  not with afros. A few dozen yards from the building with the Bonampak murals there is an 8th century sculpture of the king of Bonampak. He has long straight hair, a pointed nose, and thin lips and does not look anything like an African. (My photo of the carving of him is attached to this review.) Near the end of this segment on Bonampak (52:25), the film flashes the image of a little sculpture, apparently of an African, but that is not what the Bonampak Mayans looked like.

(15:04+) To support the idea that blacks were in ancient China the DVD shows a Buddhist painting with the image of a scary black figure holding a sword and surrounded by flames. In Buddhism, which I have studied, it is called a wrathful deity and is one of many Buddhist deities. Other deities include the White Tara and the Green Tara. Just as those last two don't relate to white people or green people, wrathful deities don't relate to black people. (This does not mean that there were not blacks in ancient China. It just means their use of the wrathful deity is not correct.)

(52:50-53:09+) Evidence of Africans in America  [author] Frank Josephfound coins with African heads on them. The coin they show on the screen as an example does not look like an African head but more likely a Roman head. The description of Josephs book on Amazon claims he found a cache of over 7,000 artifacts in an Illinois cave. In spite of racism in America, how could a find like this  that supposedly was examined by numerous experts - not be public knowledge? (One Amazon book reviewers comments: There is just a huge gap between the early narrative and the contents of the cave, which should be there if the writer planned to really link the Illinois cave contents to early Roman era immigrants fleeing North Africa. It is also not entirely honest to call these immigrants Africans, especially when the many figures in the book are of Romans.)

(26:47+) Leonardo DiVinci, Gallelo, all of them studied with African peoplewho taught Leonardo Di Vinci brain anatomy, who taught him about the airplane? It is possible these great Europeans studied with black tutors, I don't know. It would be true that the contributions the Moors made in math and science gave DiVinci and Gallelo a foundation to work from. But that does not mean a black tutor should be given credit for DiVincis brain research or invention of the airplane or that the tutor somehow gave him ideas about those things. Can it not be OK for blacks to influence DiVinci AND for him to have done brilliant things that are to his credit? I know a woman (who happens to be black) who went to Catholic school as a child. The nuns made an impact on her life in music and other areas. My friend has gone on to do incredible anti-racist work in her adult life. Even if the nuns gave her a belief in racial equality (and I do not know if they did or not), should the nuns be given full credit for all she has done and achieved with none of the credit going to her?

(19:25+) The DVD makes the point that Christianity copied the Resurrection and other aspects of its religion from the Egyptian gods. It is true the Egyptian religious system pre-dates Christianity. It is also true that Europeans were in Egypt before Christ. But why can Christianity not have some similar elements as the Egyptians without it being copied? Notably, the theme of resurrection existed in a number of the ancient worlds religions, myths, and legends. It was not just found in Egypt. (This is not to say that the idea of a white male God or a white Jesus does not have racist aspects, which the film points out. That is a different subject.)

(52:28+) The film shows Mayan temples. It contends that since Egyptians had pyramids (that pre-date the Mayan temples) the Mayans in Mexico and Central America must have been influenced by Africans. I have been to a number of ancient Mayan cities and rarely have I seen a temple that in any way would suggest the shape of a pyramid. In general, Mayan temples (which varied in their shapes at different Mayan cities) are totally different than Egyptian pyramids and relate to a completely different religions system. Why can it not be the case that Egyptians and Mayans developed their structures independently of each other?

(53:35+)Matsumutsa [spelling?] who became [the Aztec king] Montezumaso Montezuma was actually Matsumutsa  he was a Mali king who came over here with the flotilla of 200 ships of Abu Kahdi II [spelling?]. He [Abu Kahdi II] sent a flotilla of ships, 200 of them in 1306 and then again in 1311. Together they constituted 500 ships that sailed here from the west coast of Africa. There are a couple of problems with this statement. When people refer to Montezuma, they refer to Montezuma II, who was born in 1460. He was killed by Cortez in 1520  over 200 years after the film says Matsumuta came to Mexico and became Montezuma. (There was a Montezuma I who ruled the Aztecs, but he was born in 1398.) How could Matsumutsa have become Montezuma if Montezuma was not even born yet? If the producers are saying Matsumutsa is the Montezuma who confronted Cortez, this runs counter to all the Spanish chronicles regarding Montezuma and the Aztecs. The Spanish conquerors were white and racist, but it is unlikely they would omit something in their chronicles as sensational as an African king among the Aztecs. And why 200 ships (or does it total up to 500 present in Mexico at one time)? Think about this last question a minute. Columbus had 3 ships. Cortes had 11 ships for 600 soldiers and sailors. The entire Spanish Armada, which had ships collected from 8 countries, had 132 ships for 30,000 soldiers and sailors. What were west African kings doing sending 200 (or up to 500) ships? And how could some primitive Mexican costal city even receive that many? It is not impossible that Africans sailed to Mexico at some point, but it would not make sense to send 200 to 500 ships.

I could go on, but this gives an idea of some of the problems I found with this film. A basic point the movie tries to bring home is correct: Africans had great civilizations and great people throughout history. The Moors were very advanced and made many important contributions to Europeans. Their understanding of science, mathematics, and philosophy, part of which came from the Greeks, laid a foundation for Europe that was nothing less than revolutionary. But, again, because of the films errors it is hard to know what parts are correct and what parts are not. Otherwise,

(Amazon, incidentally, offers a great DVD on advanced civilizations in Africas past, aside from Egypt: Lost Kingdoms of Africa with black archaeologist Dr. Gus Casely-Hayford; $23, 2 DVDs. I have had difficulty finding books on the Moors in Spain that are authoritative and do not overly romanticize that era. Moorish Spain by Richard Fletcher [on Amazon] gives a short [175pages] but detailed history. While it can be a little boring to read, at times the author refers to the incredible contributions the Moors made. A more readable account of Spanish history during the rule of the Moors is The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain, by Maria Rosa Menocal, [also via Amazon] but it has only a few references to the Moors achievements outside of the world of literature and poetry.)",1505260800,11,9701,4.630232558139535

4491838,5,B004X4O988,This is the first of four documentaries that really shed light on our black history. It is IMPERATIVE that all blacks watch these films. We are stunted by our own growth and Hidden Colors highlights this. We come from greatness and do not even know it. Many of the things that exist today are because of the black greatness. This is definitely an eye opener! Must see! LEARN YOUR HISTORY!,1464566400,,388,4.557142857142857
4491839,3,B004X4O988,"This is a good starting point to give you ideas of things to do your own research on. However, there is a lot of exaggeration, outright lying and such by the ""experts"". No citations and a consistent snarky attitude that shows these people think they are getting over on their target audience and they know that they are lying. It is true that Europeans falsify history to favor them. But it does not help to lie in response. It is a shame, because some of what is covered here is true and if the interviewees had stuck to the truth and added strong citations, this could have been a very useful.

Example. The content on the Moors was mostly useful. Wikipedia's page is really terrible and full of inaccuracies. Watching this made me do the research to find the real truth and there are many citations from 18th and 19th century European text that backup the account from Hidden Colors.

In contrast, the coverage on European classical music was total crap. The interviewees completely got the history of the harpsichord wrong mentioning nothing about its obvious link to the pipe organ which predates everything they discussed. The pipe organ is clearly of European ancestry.

These are just a few examples. So I encourage you to check it out if you want some starting points for getting a better picture of world history. But Maybe get this DVD on sale or pirate it. Not worth the full price.",1464393600,2,1394,4.635627530364372

4491936,2,B004X4O988,"I was very much looking forward to this documentary, deeply convinced that it could fill a significant gap in human history and present ""non-white"" history.
The documentary does this in part, but in many parts, it falls into the same type of bias that characterizes some of the history books it allegedly tried to prove wrong.
It simply includes a lot of false information which may have been added for dramatization. In the end, this merely questions and undermines the argument. For example, stating for example that the first IQ test were developed by the Nazis is simply historically wrong and misses the opportunity to emphasize that racial stereotypes have also existed in since in the 19th century (when first tests were actually developed) and occurred not only in a single country.
I was further appalled by the homophobic undertones and the argument that the women movement aimed to primarily to de-masculinize men of color.
For me, these comments represent hate and a lack of true self confidence as well as of tolerance and respect for minorities. They also distract from the valid arguments and interesting facts about black history.
I sincerely hope that other documentaries on this topic don't fall into this trap. I believe there are many ways to proudly present black history as it was with all its own dignity, achievements and greatness - without having to falsify facts to emphasize the evilness of everything that is different.",1418428800,10,1448,5.012448132780083

If you're of African descent, all you ever hear is that we were slaves.  You never hear this history.  African/Moorish people were here before anyone one else.  One of the best quotes comes from Tariq at the beginning of the film he says ""When other people tell their history they come across as being patriotic, but when African Americans do it they're labeled as being militant, they're called rebels, they're called Afrocentric.  That's big difference.  Our history for some reason becomes offensive to people, so we have to stop being afraid to tell what our true history is.""

4492013,5,B004X4O988,Everything that was said is true!! And for some of the people who doubt them based on Beethoven I can't see how even though they got historical evidence to prove that people saw him as different from other people in england who were white. They referenced his hair as being a different texture from theirs and how his hair could stand up and not grow downward and even his skin tone of being darker. also they even got real distant past paintings of what Beethoven really looked like. Secondly for the some of the people on here who are arguing over the word moor...moor does indeed mean black. People back then were not color blind!! They knew what they looked like and what color they are distinguished themselves by. Moor means Black and it refers specifically to the black african people of North africa!,1406332800,,808,4.618055555555555

It was well received and totally places the History Channel to its real low level of embarrassment! Its a shame that the U.S. and the world has left out so much information specifically regarding the Black race. This video should be added to many of the public school curriculums in order that young people not only of color gain an understanding of world history in general but, to allow youth to see the cloak of secrecy that has plagued persons of color for several hundred centuries.",1395187200,3,601,4.788461538461538

4492059,5,B004X4O988,No African Americans can not rely on the public educational system to teach them their stolen history. This presentation asks for you to go look up and research soo many things. A lot of ground is being covered here none of the claims seem to fantastic for the worlds oldest race and the origin of the human. Our education of self starts as animals and then we wonder how hatred creeps into the hearts of children who were formerly innocent of race hatred and had multiracial friends. To imagine that there is more to the people that we see today before 1776. To use 1776 as a reference to the AA is another mental slight. Christianity was the rape apparatus of the African peoples.,1393632000,,682,4.508064516129032

These two documentaries need to be seen by every black, brown, yellow, pink, red, peach, tanned, and white person who identifies with a minority group. It also needs to be seen by any group considered a dominant or majority. If you are looking for lies and subjugation, don't view this documentary or its sister because you will be highly disappointed that you would have to accept what you may have chosen to ignore.

It is absolutely incredible the misinformation our children have already received regarding Africa and Africans, especially in regards to the continent. Our oldest is only 10. They began receiving misinformation almost at birth from print, audio, and visual media.
