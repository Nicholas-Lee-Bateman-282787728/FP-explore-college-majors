6135949,5,B00H7E3T5K,"The re-imaginings of classic fairy tales needs to stop. It began with Tim Burtons 2010 Alice in Wonderland, and that went okay. So, Snow White & The Huntsman had us rooting for the villain as the hero was poorly played by Kristen Stewart, who got the part because she slept with the director. Tim Burton had turned down the chance to direct Maleficent, a different angle on the story of Sleeping Beauty. This made me think that the script probably wasn't any good, or that a Maleficent movie would fail. Im glad I actually saw the thing.

""Maleficent"" works for the simple reason of having cast Angelina Jolie. She is a force to be reckoned with as the classic big baddie, who, as it turns out, wasn't that bad after all. The film shows Maleficents back-story from childhood, and adds an interesting layer in the Disney canon.

This classic villain was basically a woman scorned, who acted as any of us would. She was young and full of love and hope once too, but she was betrayed at a crucial time in her life, and that changed everything for her. It brings me to why no one agrees with me during discussions about books or films. I still believe in the heroes, but I prefer the villains. What I like best is when a character is neither the hero nor the villain, but something in between, like we all are. And I think thats what we have in the character study of Maleficent.

Its obvious Jolie was born to play this role. Her performance hits not a single sour note, and everything about her as Maleficent just feels right. Shes in almost every scene, so the viewer really has to grow to like this character, and Jolie allows for that to happen. However, her Lady Gaga Born This Way-cheekbones are never quite explained. But, even that looks right.

There are a lot of great twists in the story too. A narrator tells us at the beginning, this story is not what you thought it was, and she was right. There are quite a few clever surprises that really will change the way you look at this classic story. The script had to be quite good, which makes me wonder why Burton didn't take on the project.

Robert Stormberg, a visual effects guy, has his feature directorial debut in Maleficent, and he does a splendid job. Its also kept at a humane running time, not being the two-and-a-half-hour affair that it could have been. It certainly worked better than the recent re-imaginings of fairy-tales. But for every good one, theres ten bad ones, so Hollywood shouldnt take this as a cue to make more. Quit while you're ahead, I say.

I cant list off the top of my head many moments in, or aspects of Maleficent that didn't work, and thats enough reason to see it.

Grade: A-",1401321600,3,2668,4.4661190965092405
6135950,5,B00H7E3T5K,"Maleficent is a remake of the Disney classic ""Sleeping Beauty."" I assumed that I knew what it was going to be about but, it turned out to be a totally unpredictable and amazing movie. Maleficent is about a betrayed fairy (Angelina Jolie) that curses the king's infant daughter Aurora as revenge. She soon discovers that when Aurora grows up, she is the only one who can restore the peace and happiness that everyone needs to get them out of the depression caused by revenge and war. This movie takes ""Sleeping Beauty"" and turns it into a completely different movie.

By far, this is the best Disney movie I've seen and one of the best movies Ive seen in a while. Everything is just right. For example, the music sets the right mood in every scene. It is strong and loud when it needs to be and quite and shy at other times and, at certain points, it is playful and happy. It really pulls the whole movie together. Along with the jaw-dropping music, this movie has amazing actors starting with Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning (Auora). They fit each role perfectly almost as if they were born for these roles.

This movie is very interesting to watch because it isn't entirely based on ""Sleeping Beauty"" so you get to see a completely different side of Maleficent before she becomes the villain that she is known as. Throughout the movie I found myself wanting the movie to go quicker to see what would happen next but not wanting it to end anytime soon. I think that the director Robert Stromberg and the writers Linda Woolverton and Charles Perrault really outdo themselves with this movie because I cannot stop obsessing about how great it is.

I give this movie 5 out of 5 perfect stars and recommend it for ages 9 to 18. To be honest, this movie is a movie that you should be sure not to miss because IT IS THAT GOOD!

I only got it because I was bored and wanted something light that I didn't have to think about too much.  I was pleasantly surprised.  it's a new twist to the Snow White tale from the ""evil queen"" point of view but nothing is as it seems, or as you expect.  I don't want to post any spoilers but it's well worth a watch, especially if you have children from 7 or so up.

The movie is certainly scary and violent without being gory, but definitely don't take little kids to see this one. It will be quite unsuited for them.

Maleficent begins life as an immature fairy in a beautiful, harmonious fairy world next to a conventional and harsh kingdom. She is visited by Stefan, a boy of a similar age from the kingdom, who implies that someday he will live in the king's castle. An innocent romance begins, but soon ends as the boy grows older, and the current ruler of the kingdom attempts to invade the fairy world with his army to steal its treasures, only to fail. As the old king is dying, Stefan claims the throne by amputating and stealing the fairy's wings. He gets the crown, marries, and has a baby daughter...only for the now-embittered and vengeful Maleficent to arrive and place a curse on the daughter. Stefan is forced to have his daughter raised by three fairies to try to keep her safe...and in the process, becomes embittered and vengeful himself. But over the years, as the daughter grows up, unaware of what had happened, Maleficent sees her and starts having second thoughts. But the cold war has started between Maleficent and Stefan; can Maleficent undo the damage she has done?

Like most characters in recent fairy tale-themed movies, nobody is entirely good or evil, and everyone is the victim of the attitudes of their respective cultures and eras. Good for teenagers or above, but too upsetting for the young kids.",1520208000,,1629,4.814285714285714

She (& the costume designer) nailed the look, the body language & gestures to bring this classic character to life in all her splendor.
If you thrive on nit-picky analysis, or are an ""award-winning"" movie snob, look elsewhere & leave this movie to those who can appreciate something else.  If you can still appreciate a good ""old-fashioned"" story I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1518566400,,901,4.75

I am getting my masters of mental health therapy, I found this movie incredible and it easily makes my top 10 favorite movies. One of my favorite pieces of the film was how Maleficent heals: by the love and relationship of one person.

6136874,4,B00H7E3T5K,"*Spoiler Alert*

Pro: I loved the idea of a live-action Maleficent, and loved Angelina Jolie's costume and performance. Maleficent is cool.

Con: It's a man-hating movie.

The king is a thief in his youth, then a liar, then after kissing Maleficent on her 16th birthday she never sees him until after the battle where he chops her wings because he cannot bring himself to kill her. For the rest of the movie he never really offers an explanation other than the narrator observing ""Men are vain and greedy."" He never screams ""I'm sorry,"" or ""I was wrong,"" or anything. He seemed unnaturally cruel just so the audience will hate him too.

And Prince Philip is just comedy and doesn't even get to wake the Princess, oh no, that's Maleficent's right, she's the one who can REALLY love the princess. The scene where Maleficent knocks the princess out and ""takes her to her place to secretly watch from the shadows"" had a weird predator vibe too.

And the three fairies are WAY dumber than the original. I like how in the original it's the third blue fairy who is able to ""save"" the princess by altering Maleficent's curse, which was to ""prick her finger and DIE."" (I always loved that line) so in order to let Maleficent give the lovely kiss at the end she words her curse differently to that it's ""a sleep LIKE DEATH"" and the third fairy never bestows a wish for the princess.

And the moores seemed like a shoe in opportunity to sell some fairy toys, they're not really involved in the plot at all after the battle and seem really out of place considering the original lived in a castle with goblins instead of the woods with fairy aliens.

Another pro though, the movie is definitely better than I feared, it does have a good message about things you wish you could take back and falling in love again even after being hurt, and Jolie's line about ""losing her wings"" after the actress ""lost"" her breasts made me sit up.

It's candy coated for the kiddies and super feminist, but it is a story about one of the most famous Disney villains ever, so it earns a four star, but like many films I do think it could have been better.",1499817600,,2124,4.484455958549223

6136924,5,B00H7E3T5K,"I have enjoyed the live-action renditions of the Disney classics, and this one takes a twist on the story and puts it in the perspective of the villain herself. Although if it's not the story you recall seeing, it definitely holds its own with storytelling. Maleficent is the ""Wicked"" of Disney movies, where we see the actions and reasons for why she became evil, and also the redemption arc that is not present in the original film ""Sleeping Beauty."" I truly enjoy this change, but for fans of the longtime film it may come as a shock to see the changes made to the tale.

Aurora is now in the film for much longer, Stefan is an evil king, and the three good fairies are very different than the previous in terms of their actions. Some of the moments from the original are in there, but rushed and short. The main focus is on Maleficent, and her story arc. However, for fans of the original, this can also open up more to things we didn't know before about Maleficent.

I highly recommend this to any Disney fan, however I also advise that they brace for the changes in the story.",1490918400,11,1082,4.405

I happened to see this movie twice in theatrical release. There was a slight difference in the edits (still don't understand how it happened): In the castle of a sinister king, 1st viewing I clearly remember a clear glass window with an abstract design of 3 crosses. The king & Maleficent crash through this window doing battle. In the 2nd viewing, the window was visible but mostly shuttered. Some of that weird Disney dark ""magic.""

6136948,5,B00H7E3T5K,"Angelina Jolie is absolutely brilliant in this retelling of the ""Sleeping Beauty"" story by the Bros. Grimm; which comes with a surprising twist.

The plot is very similar to the Broadway production ""Wicked""; a clever variant on the witches of Oz theme.
We have  Elphaba;( the acid green skinned wicked witch of the west), who actually isn't so wicked and her sister Galinda (Glinda the ""good"" witch of the north; who is in fact a beautiful but mean spirited, bitchy, blonde bimbo.

Maleficent is the Elphaba in this story and as her story unfolds, we see that she is in fact a loving and gentle soul who cares for and protects the fabled princess. Maleficent was once the protector of the inhabitants of the enchanted forest but turns bitter when she is unjustly wronged by the king. However, she doesn't allow her bitterness to lose her sense of what is right and just.

The costumes and special effects are wonderfully balanced to perfection. The production values add just the right touch to create a magical atmosphere but are carefully restrained so as not to distract the viewer from the premise of the storyline.

Ms. Jolie's performance is powerful yet carefully paced with an impressively intuitive understanding of her role.
The role of the princess is important but at the same time; almost relegated to a supporting character.
It is the story of Maleficent that we are focused on and as we learn more about her plight, we become sympathetic and allied to her feelings of sadness and betrayal.

The subject matter is deceptively simple but later uncloaks a more profound revelation and finally a resolution that has long been hoped for.
It's a beautiful and compassionate story that reflects many aspects of the human condition, hence, the absence of the usual inane, sugar coated, oversimplified good vs evil dreck that puts you into a diabetic coma.",1488499200,,1862,4.8765822784810124

6136963,1,B00H7E3T5K,"Positive: This film is visually striking ~ stunning cinematography.

Cons: Maleficent literally means one who brings harm. There is a sympathy for the devil type theme. The leading character looks extremely sinister with large horns, bat wings, and she is dressed completely in black,she resembles Baphomet. The general public is so brainwashed and desensitized these days that they will not understand that this movie is mocking God by glorifying the Luciferian archetype - how many parents will even realize that what they are putting in front of their children's minds is blatant satanic mind control.

The film makers are pushing a satanic Gnostic belief system onto innocent unsuspecting minds. Gnosticism teaches that Lucifer is not bad - this philosophy is an occult inversion of Christian teaching. Early experience has an important influence on adult behaviour. When the children watching this sort of material grow up they will easily accept occult themes because they have sentimental,warm memories of films like this. Disney would never have been able to get away with this a few decades ago,they have always had subliminal messages & occult symbolism woven into their films but now they aren't even bothering to hide it.",1487462400,,1233,5.285714285714286

6136965,4,B00H7E3T5K,"This movie is captivating. It is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty, and it is a far cry from the original. Prince Phillip is a minor character, Maleficent is considered a fairy, the king is the bad guy, there are strange creatures in a place called the Moores, and instead of the gift of song, Aurora is given the gift of happiness. The animation of magic is incredible, and Maleficent casting the spell will give you shivers of delight. The movie also shows us Maleficent's motivations. Why did she choose a spinning wheel, of all things?  What made her cast the spell in the first place? The reasons seem to have been carefully thought through. One of the producers mentions an inspiration in the bonus features.  The bonus features are interesting, one of them being the creating of the battle scene. However, there is one weakness to the movie, and that is the bad guy. Villians are supposed to be strong and evil, but you can see this one looks like a wimp. In addition to that, listen to his voice. It sounds like he is pinching his nose the whole time.

So, I wish we could have had a better bad guy, but otherwise, the movie is captivating and has a message.",1487376000,5,1163,4.476415094339623

6136980,4,B00H7E3T5K,"Disney released this reimagining of the animated movie Sleeping Beauty a couple of years, and while i have enjoyed the movie some of the changes in storyline from Sleeping Beauty to this movie I think are pretty cheesy. For example here is one o them, when Princess Aurora gets into her ""death like sleep"" curse some of the characters expect Prince Philip to be the one to kiss her and be true love's first when one that they had barely met and barely had a chance to fall in love. If you haven't had  chance to watch this movie yet, check it out for yourself, but if you haven't watched Sleeping Beauty in a long time, I would recommend you to watch it first so you can know the changes in storyline but the time you see this movie. As the movie opens, we learn from the narrator of two kingdoms one named the Moors and the other is an unnamed kingdom. The Moors is the home to young Malfecient where as a child she learns a intruder has come into their world, and had stolen something. She goes off a finds it is a boy that introduces himself as Stefan. And she orders him to give back what he has stolen, which he does and returns it to the waters. And they begin to becomes friends. Where many years later as adult Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) is the leader of the Moors and has become more estranged from Stephan (Sharlto Copley)  who is working on his goal to become king. But when King Henry (Kenneth Cranham)) tries to invade the Moors but Mafecient successfully stops him, which the King orders her to die. And Stephan denies to steal her wings while she is sleeping, and pretends that the job is done. And informs King Henry one his death bed as he was wounded during the battle, and promised who ever kills her will become the king and watch after his daughter. Realizing her wings are gone Malfiecent gets herself a new henchman named Diaval (Sam Riley) and makes her kingdom dark upon Stephan's betrayal which has made her mad. Diaval vowed to serve however she wants, and she told him she needs him to be her wings. Then later on she is informed by him that King Stephan and the Queen has had a daughter, and he is having a christening for his new daughter. And 3 fairies  Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton), Thistlewit (Juno Temple), and Flittle (Lesley Manville) are there and give their gifts, and Maleficent shows up invited and informed by Stefan that she was unwanted. And she gives her gift that she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel, and fall into a sleep like death that she will never awake from. Stephan asks her mercy, and she recently adds an antidote, that she can only awaken by true love's first kiss. He has all the spinning wheels in the kingdom burned, and send Aurora t o leave with the fairies until the day after her 16th birthday. Which this is where I leave it up to you to find out what happens next.",1486252800,,2839,4.383301707779887

The story has you laughing and crying and totally invested in each character.  I also loved the way it turned out explaining the events surrounding another fairytale we've all grown up with.

Glad to see Disney putting out some movies here lately that help to better depict that true love is about sacrifice--putting others' interests before your own.

We have watched is several times already.  Angelina Jolie is her usual great self and shows how she can be a good/evil/good witch as well as a hit woman/Tomb Raider/everything else with aplomb.  The 3D version is so much more engrossing.  So much more fun.  Excellent 3D rendition.  Surround sound is clear and comes from all sides.  No need for subtitles in this one. No ghosts.  Lots of depth and lots of pop-outs. Great story...No Tolstoy, mind you, but I am not looking to Tolstoy for entertainment.",1476662400,,679,4.630252100840337
6139807,3,B00H7E3T5K,It had more potential.  This climactic fight between Stefan and Maleficent ruined it for me.  I really hate it when movies have to sacrifice common sense to justify adding thrill to a scene.  It made absolutely no sense that Maleficent had such unstoppable power through the length of the movie and decided on the horrible decision to turn Diaval into a dragon instead of just laying waste to every soldier in that room with a snap of her fingers.

Angelina Jolie nails the role of Maleficent beautifully.

6139866,3,B00H7E3T5K,"Besides passing the Bechdel Test this movie does not do much on the Feminist front. They even give the role of the dragon to her male sidekick. The moment where Maleficent is the most powerful isn't hers, it's HIS. Prince Philip doesn't need to be in the movie at all. Had Maleficent had him prove his love by fighting her... The ""Comedy"" of the three fairies falls flat. Most of the people Maleficent fights are  weak. The reason she struggles at the end is because she is NOT the dragon. In short ""Feminism"" is not the films strong point, The film's strong point is special effects.",1475539200,,584,4.509433962264151

8630459,2,B00H7E3T5K,There was nothing wrong with the movie. It was the digital copy issues that we were having. This is the third one I purchased where the digital copy either does not work or was not in the case. I wish Disney would get their act together in reference to these digital copies so that you didn't have to go to a different location to log in your digital copy. Like I said before the two previous boxes didn't have the digital copy in them and when it did have the digital copy it didn't work.,1532217600,,489,4.157894736842105
