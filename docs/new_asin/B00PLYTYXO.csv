6817551,1,B00PLYTYXO,Seriously bad acting...I love a good vampire movie and even some not so good vampire movies but this one I couldn't get through.,1466467200,,128,4.608695652173913
6817552,2,B00PLYTYXO,Starts off as a good story but then goes south. Nothing is explained and the ending made no sense to me. I give it 2 stars for good makeup.,1466380800,,139,3.8275862068965516
6817553,1,B00PLYTYXO,Everyone involved in the making of this movie should burst into flames in the middle of Death Valley and have their ashes thrown into a lake of Holy Water. Calling this movie bad insults the bad movies I've seen that are infinitely better than Joe Vampire. I've sworn to shave my head if I ever watch more than 10 minutes of any movie this bad ever again.,1465689600,,355,4.313432835820896

This is so not at the top of my list. I am so sorry to be let  down.",1464652800,,133,3.5517241379310347
6817556,2,B00PLYTYXO,"Horrible plotting. No reason is given for most of the things that occur.

Vamps out in broad daylight didn't help in a couple scenes.",1464566400,,133,4.541666666666667
6817557,5,B00PLYTYXO,Awesome movie!!! Loved it!,1442275200,,26,5.75
6817558,2,B00PLYTYXO,"Bad music, missing scenes, technical flaws. The acting was good though as was the camera work.",1438646400,,94,4.9375
6817559,4,B00PLYTYXO,"A tale about an every day Joe who happens to be a vampire in modern society.  He's poor, lonely and out of blood.",1417046400,2,113,3.9130434782608696
8688574,2,B00PLYTYXO,"Seriously bad acting, mediocre special effects and lame script.  I just couldn't take this film seriously as a genuine vampire flick. Especially when almost every time Joe had on his sunglasses I could see the camera man in the reflection.",1503705600,,239,4.975
8688575,3,B00PLYTYXO,"yah i know, as a whole, it wasn't that great, but, it wasn't that bad either. and my very good friend who starred in it was awesome!",1495670400,,132,3.925925925925926

8688578,1,B00PLYTYXO,Don't do it!,1470700800,,12,3.3333333333333335
8688579,3,B00PLYTYXO,"Low budget, cheesy acting, mediocre special effects, a strip club scene that had no reason to exist and that's just the good stuff.

Joe, a Civil War Confederate soldier is shot and wounded.  He is found by a vampire and turned.  He tries his best to be a decent guy but the script just won't allow it.

Who knew Florida could be so dangerous?",1470009600,,343,4.3125
8688580,2,B00PLYTYXO,"I actually thought this was pretty good despite the amateur aspect... until the 10 minute stripper scene.  Seriously, even though its low budget hand cam crap, it was shaping up to be interesting....  I could actually watch it....until the endless stripper scene with the terrible boob job.  ....ANNNnnnd like that it lost me.",1468540800,,326,5.113207547169812
8688581,2,B00PLYTYXO,poor low level production,1468540800,,25,5.5
