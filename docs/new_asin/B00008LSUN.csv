7985274,2,B00008LSUN,"I recently watched this and, with it's documentary-like nature as well as general lack of dialog, I would normally enjoy this type of film. However, it's not just slow, it's glacier-like in its pacing. Worst of all, it contains a [spoiler alert] scene in which the locals sacrifice a lamb. While this was likely a practice of rural Tunisians in the early 1960s, it appeared to me that the animal was sacrificed specifically for the film and I find that truly offensive. In addition, the director spends several minutes of screen time showing the lamb struggle and suffer, which is excruciating to watch.",1398556800,,603,4.864077669902913
7985275,4,B00008LSUN,"An unusual, haunting film, made in 1970 about a labor revolt in a tiny, primitive Tunisian town in the early 1960s. Slow, deliberate, with
almost no dialogue at all (I don't speak French and saw this DVD version without English subtitles, and felt I missed nothing) it feels much
more like a beautifully photographed documentary on a disappearing way of life, than a narrative film. The 'plot' doesn't even start to
develop until more than halfway through the film.

The first half simply gives us an overview of how life in the village works through carefully chosen images and sounds. And even when
the face-off does occur, it is presented in muted, slow-moving visual strokes. Faces, and body language tell the tale as the French
bring in troops to stare down the quietly dignified striking workers.

A film that acknowledges there are gains that come with progress (education is clearly noted as a plus by the film), but at a high cost
in terms of exploitation of the majority, and the loss of a simple and honest way of life, as generations worked the earth while living
in comparative harmony with it and each other.

It's sad and surprising that this film, critically praised and Oscar nominated has become so heard to see.  The French DVD is available at
Amazon.fr and it's a decent, if not great transfer.",1388016000,,1314,4.75
