8588264,5,B00D0V7YD2,This dvd has some songs from Island Tunes for kids dvd but not all songs are the same. I would recommend  them both.  The music is upbeat and some songs are very silly while others are moving. The scenery is beautiful and the grandkids watch these dvd s daily. Highly recommended.,1522454400,,280,4.470588235294118
8588265,5,B00D0V7YD2,"LOVE IT, AND SO DO MY KIDS!!  If you want a DVD that's full of island fun, this is a great choice.  The songs are fun and creative and the music is very well produced.  As a parent, I really appreciate that because it's easy to listen to.  There are songs about islands, coconuts, monkeys and mangoes but our favorite is ""The Green Iguana Bellyflop!""",1398211200,,350,4.338461538461538
