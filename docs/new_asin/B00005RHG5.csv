1655566,4,B00005RHG5,"Based on a novel of the same name by Pearl S. Buck
 Father Andre is a missionary in 19th century China.  He is everything a missionary should be.  Ms. Wu is the wife of a very wealthy man.  She heads a typical, large multi-generational household with plenty of servants and maids.  Her husband is usually drunk or opium when he comes home at nigh, and his treatment of her is beyond crude.  Ms. Wu fetches a young girl from the country side to be a 2nd wife for her husband, so he will keep his hands and body off her.
It seems that Father Andre loves Ms. Wu, and it seems she grows to crave the attentions of Fr. Andre, the likes of which she has never experienced before.  Late in the film, they go for a walk and end up making love in a touching cathartic scene..  Ms Wu, in her forties, had never been touched in a loving or caring way by a man before.  A conservative may think it is bad to portray a priest this way, but in the context of the story, you want to cheer for the both of them.
Much of what is portrayed in the film is very authentic.  It does a very good job in showing some of the differences between ancient China and the west.
 The Missus didn't like the film that much.  She says no Chinese man could possibly be as despicable as Ms. Wu's husband was depicted in the film.  She excuses the husband by saying that back then in China no one knew anything about sex or love.  Also, Lindy claims that in China at that time, if Fr. Andre and Ms Wu had made love together, they would have been trussed up like pigs and thrown into the river!  Thanks for puncturing my fantasies...Needless to say, no of this happened in the book version.",1026604800,2,1654,4.1572327044025155
1655567,3,B00005RHG5,"This would have been an excellent movie for anyone who hadn't read the book but, Mr. Wu's character was completely distorted. He was a kind, gentle man who went along with all of his wife's suggestions even though he wasn't really willing to take a concubine. The rest of the movie followed the book very well but a lot was missing. The charaacter of Father Andrew was fairly accurate up to a point. I would reoment the book to everyone. I really enjoyed it.",1024704000,2,458,4.464285714285714
1655568,5,B00005RHG5,"I rented this movie because Pearl S. Buck (the author of the novel for which the novel is based on) is my favorite author.
I read Pavilion of Women about 10 years ago and I still remember the plot and characters of the novel. I love it so much. I was skeptical when I rented the movie because I was afraid the movie couldn't keep up, but I was wrong. Even though reading the novel will give you intimate details, the movie entertained as well.",1015113600,5,443,4.223529411764706
1655569,5,B00005RHG5,"It was fascinating to see China through the eyes of someone who loved the land, the culture and the people.  I think even the Tibetans would like this movie if for no other reason than the scenery, the soundtrack and the mood.  All in all it was quite an experience.  The only flaw I found in it was really minor; the view of Japanese war planes bombing the city was so amateurish as to be laughable.  Other than that strange incongruity, the filming was absolutely brilliant and gorgeous.

Some reviewers have complained about the sex portrayed in the movie, even though everything was only implied--just like in Pearl Buck's descriptions.  It was there, but put delicately. It's nothing to get worked up about, unless you are a nun...or a Jungian.  LOL!",1320364800,,755,4.717557251908397

1655571,4,B00005RHG5,"A fascinating film about China in 1938, just before the arrival of the invading Japanese. The film shows the real culture of China in a bourgeois family, how they are divided between respecting the traditions that set women apart, that provide married men with concubines, that marries sons and daughters at birth, but the film also shows how the refusal of these alienating traditions leads the sons and daughters of these families into the arms of the Communists, especially with the Japanese arriving. The film also shows how the Americans are trying to meddle with China via the good old Catholic religion that has nothing to do in China but that provides the poorest, in that case orphans, with a little hope and survival. But then the film turnes sentimentalese. To make the elder son fall in love with the young concubine of his own father is far-fetched, and to add the mother falling in love with the American priest is even more far-fetched. And that makes the film mushy about good and evil and it forgets a country can only change from inside. It tries to impose onto China a change that comes from outside, from a foreigner who breaks the traditions instead of at the most helping them change all by themselves. It also shows that China in 1938 needed a big break, a big change and that this was going to come from the Communists prompted into taking the control of China by the absurd invasion from Japan. Some beautiful scenes, particularly the fast visions of the play telling the doomed love affair of two young people. Beautiful theater, beautiful drama.

1655572,5,B00005RHG5,"PAVILLION OF WOMEN (2001) - A WONDERFUL JOURNEY TO ANOTHER CULTURE

I was pleasantly amazed by this film. When I read the title and saw the poster for the first time, I thought it would be about some kind of sordid story between a western man (Dafoe) and an eastern -chinese- woman, above all because I associated  ""pavilion"" with a jail. Of course, when one watches the film, it becomes clear  that it indeed refers to a jail, although in metaphoric terms....

So, first of all I think the landscapes shown are really beautiful. On the second place, one can realize without doubts  the role women played  in Chinese society and family, the absolute lack of consideration for love  in marriage, and the fulfillment of the married woman duties towards her husband.

The discovery of real love by this woman, who, after 25 years of serving her husband, decides to call for a young girl in order to better satisfy him and to relieve herself from her conjugal duties... One could say that she was lucky that her society allowed her to give another wife  to her husband...although it wasn't all she needed to be happy, of course. On the other hand, the fact of love growing between her and the western Priest, it was so subtle, she wasn't ""searching"" for anyone -at least in a conscious way, in my opinion-. The hint of a search for freedom in a society where women were under men's rule is shown in the fact of the two women attending the Priest's classes.... I think they discovered that the world was more than sewing and serving a husband....

I must admit that  I bought the movie just because Wilem Dafoe was there....his particular features and ways have always attracted me. After watching the movie I can say that this is an excellent performance from him. One has to consider that he and the Chinese woman are the most important characters  around who the story developes, and they both catch the audience's attention, her performance is excellent too.

Well, as I don't want to be a spoiler, I won't write about the end, but I only want to say that it provoked in me a sort of impotence and sadness, for a while I thought about the relevance of a feeling, a caress, a glance, I mean, as a still photograph and without looking forward for much more... and about the vulnerability of human life.

There are several superior values expressed : boldness, corage, respect for tradition, but in the same way the conflict between a too closed ancient tradition and freedom of choice, or free will, arises, as in the young son's decision of leaving home in order to pursue his  political ideas and the woman he did love; the Chinese woman's choice of not going with her husband and the rest of the family when the war exploded, among others.

There's only one detail : I think there wasn't any conflict shown between the fact of Andre being a Priest -and consequently, a celibe- and his love for the Chinese woman - perhaps only when he prays ""God, forgive me, because I have sinned"", but it was all. I wonder if he would have left his religious position, married or at least lived together with her.... Well, but these are only speculations of mine, which don't add to my review, I guess.",1199491200,,3187,4.564912280701755
1655573,1,B00005RHG5,"...it you have no skill at it.  What was lacking?  An excellent and thoughtful plot?  Well-developed characters?  A moral conundrum that has falls into shades of gray and is not black and white?  Pearl Buck provides all of these in her skillful novel.  The lady of the house does not fall in love with the American priest because her husband is as disgusting as he is portrayed in this film.  In the book, he is a common, simple man, whose greatest fault is stupidity.

I watched only the early part of this film and then trashed it.  The first analogy that came to mind, like another reviewer, was the rendition of Mansfield Park on film where there is a similiar obsession on the part of the filmmakers with sex and violence (together in the same scene), thereby denoting that they always go together.  PLEASE, spare us your excessive imaginations.  DON'T mess with a classic.  If both Pavilion of Women and Mansfield Park are classics and have survived through so many years and are beloved to so many readers, consider this fact. Their authors know MUCH MUCH more than you do, are FAR more sensible people, have a MUCH greater sense of how humanity functions than you, (quite obviously with your record here) will EVER have.

Kapish?  Don't mess with greatness, and don't add your own seamy and dirty version of what you consider to be reality to it.  If you do want to make films like this, join another branch of the film industry and leave the greats alone.",1114387200,11,1464,4.598455598455598
1655574,5,B00005RHG5,"I remember reading Pearl Buck's ""Pavilion of Women"" as a child and loving it.  I've forgotten the details of the plot long ago.  But I do remember it was about Madame Wu, a wealthy Chinese woman who, on her 40th birthday, decided to stop marital relations with her husband and find him a young concubine.  At that time 40 years old seemed very old to me. Now it seems quite young.
This 2001 adaptation of the novel is set in 1937 and was filmed in China and partially financed by the Beijung Film Studios.  The Chinese actress Yan Luo not only stars as Madame Wu, but also helped write the screenplay and produce the film.  She's beautiful and stately and gives a fine performance.  Willem Dafoe is cast as a village priest who runs a local orphanage.  They are attracted to each other and the inevitable happens.  But that is only part of what the story is about.  Basically, it's about the oppressive world of the old-fashioned traditional Chinese family.  And the future promise of communism.  I read the book a long time ago and don't remember such a strong emphasis on communism.  But this film is, after all, produced from a modern Chinese point of view.
Many critics hated this film, called it too slow and too romantic.  And all of them objected to the fact that the characters spoke English.  I usually would agree with all those objections.  It IS an overblown soap opera after all.  However, I found watching this film a delight.  I loved the opulent world of pre-communist China that I remember so well from Pearl Buck novels, including the acceptance of the concubine.  And I liked the fact that the bedroom scenes were much more explicit than what was hinted at by Pearl Buck.  I just relaxed and let myself be part of this fantasy world for a little while.  And even though the film was a full two hours long, I never was bored.
Taste is personal, of course.  And even though I can't understand why I enjoyed Pavilion of Women so much, I do recommend it.",1059609600,23,1969,4.505649717514125
1655575,4,B00005RHG5,"This film is one of those movies you like to watch with your better half on a rainy Saturday afternoon with a large couch and a bowl of popcorn. Don't expect a lot from this particular movie (loosely based on Pearl Buck's book). It would never win an Academy Award, but not every movie is made for such shallow recognition. The Chinese women characters are stunningly beautiful, the location photography is breathtaking, and even Willem Dafoe is pleasant enough to watch in this film. This is one of those movies guys love because it has enough story to keep the girls interested, and enough slow periods where you can get a lot of hugging and kissing in. For that reason alone, I should have given this movie 6 stars!",1054080000,9,718,4.573643410852713
1655576,1,B00005RHG5,"'Pavilion of Women' is an unintentionally hilarious film.  The movie is set in China, all the dialogue is in English - stilted English at that (including Willem Dafoe's as a matter of fact) - though it is meant to be in Chinese.
The characters are incredibly broadly drawn - husband's a sex-addicted lying cheat, wife's a saint, son's a rebel, etc.  Watching this film, we turned to each halfway through and wondered ""Why haven't we turned this off yet?""  The answer: the movie was so bad that watching it had become fun - just *how bad* could it get?
Well, when the son and his girlfriend come over the hill wearing their new Communist attire...Aahhh!  We knew the filmmakers had attained camp nirvana.  You can't invent a moment that goofy.  Simply wonderfully bad moviemaking!  Excellent!!",1039996800,9,792,4.822222222222222
1655577,4,B00005RHG5,"Anyone who liked Zhang Yimou's ""Raise The Red Lantern"" is a prospect for ""Pavilion Of Women"".  Whereas ""Raise The Red Lantern"" explores merely Chinese taboos about marriage and concubinage, ""Pavilion Of Women"" centres on a romance between leading characters in whom both Chinese and Western mores collide.  This is a cross-cultural romantic story adapted from a book by the prolific American writer on China, Pearl S. Buck, set in the late 1930s.  It is a cross-cultural challenge to the audience, as much as to its characters.  Many Chinese would say that its romantic plot was unthinkable or impossible in the 1930s--which is, of course, part of the point of the story.  Western fans of Pearl S. Buck might be irritated by deviation from her book.  However, this film has first class cross-cultural direction and acting, and was beautifully photographed on location in elegant settings of old Suzhou.  It is a fine example of what the Chinese film industry can achieve in co-production.  The DVD has high quality picture and audio, but could be improved with special features such as biographical and production notes.",1031961600,13,1120,5.081967213114754
1655578,1,B00005RHG5,"Do I have to give it a star? Awful, just awful. No other words could describe this terrible adaptation of the book it is named after. It is so far removed from the original that one can't help wonder what Pearl Buck would be thinking if she were alive today.
The characters are the same in name, only. I don't understand why the screenplay had to deviate so greatly. Mr. Wu went from being a happily married man (who, by the way, did not want a concubine to begin with) to an opium depraved sex-aholic bent on receiving as much oral sex as possible by whatever means possible.  Why was there a need to color this man with such depravity?
The beauty of the book lies in the richness of the allegories that Pearl Buck so intricately wove into the story. Mrs. Wu's love for Father Andre was the love of his spirit and being. It was who the man was and not what he was physically made of. Father Andre was Christ-like in his devotion to his calling in China. There was never any hint of a sexual attraction to Mrs. Wu.
The recent adaptation of ""Mansfield Park"" came to mind when I watched this movie. Another disastrous attempt to adapt a classic and beloved book to today's morally vacant mind-set. After watching both of these movies I felt violated and betrayed.
Shame. Shame.",1027036800,25,1275,4.425531914893617

7952372,1,B00005RHG5,"There is not much to say about this film but that it contains nice pictures and any amount of clichs: one of the film versions that were badly made but could perhaps wake the viewer's interest to read the book. Who in God's name wrote this script? I am a fan of Pearl S. Buck and in particular of this novel, and the only thing that consoles me is the fact that the author is already dead and did not have to watch what was made of this beautifully written and most of all wise book.

In this film Madame Wu is degraded to a woman who is not remarkable about anything and who is illuminated and brought to the path of ""civilization"" by Brother Andr, the advanced US American (in the book he was an Italian priest). Pearl S. Buck's approach, which she preached throughout most of her books, that different nations and cultures ought to learn from one another is eroded here through the blatant superiority of the US American, the hero, the selfless saviour, neglecting among other things the fact that he later seduces Madame Wu to adultery and thus breaks his own oath of celibacy.
Madame Wu's husband is nothing but the typical brutal macho no woman would want to be married to, while his son Fengmo and his second wife Ch'iuming are the romantic, unhappy couple separated by convention and which can only find together thank to the intervention of the wise US American, thus leaving the evil Chinese conventions behind them. And where, by the way, are their other three sons and their wives, which gave the book its title? I guess the authors couldn't find clichs that would have fitted to them.

Though he technically is a priest, of course Brother Andr is also an extraordinary physician, so that it is he who saves Madame Kang's life during her difficult delivery instead of Madame Wu. And of course in the end he must die in the course of saving innocent children from Japanese soldiers - notwithstanding the fact that he loved hearing ""Madame Butterfly"" so much - what an irony to have an opera set in Japan being played in China as an example for occidental music, shortly before the beginning of the Chinese-Japanese war.
From the non-carnal, pure ""courtly love"" between Brother Andr and Ailien Wu of course a forbidden passion must be spun, since obviously the unintelligent and clich-loving viewer is expected not to understand anything else. Of course the two lovers find together because she had to save him from a burning house, and they make love because a sudden storm forces them to find shelter in a barn... oh dear. I will not continue because I have already forgotten (thank God) all the other deviances from the novel, abstruseness and trash that find place in this film. It may perhaps meet the expectations of US American politics, but certainly not the deep wisdom of the novel. I can't see any other aim in it than to interest possibly many viewers by coming up to what the authors seem to believe are their expectations. Why didn't they make a film out of a dime novel in the first place, may I ask?

The only interesting part for me was seeing Willem Dafoe again - the last time I saw him he called himself the ""Green Goblin"" and was fighting against Spider Man over the roofs of New York. :-)",1394323200,,3220,4.557858376511226
