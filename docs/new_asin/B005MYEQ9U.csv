4839184,5,B005MYEQ9U,"This performance of Donizetti""s Anna Bolena is a must for anybody who is an Opera Buff.  Anna Netrebko and her rival have provided the opera world with  what must surely be the supreme performance of this Donizetti masterpiece. If you have a home theatre  one can invite ones friends to view this production in the comfort of ones home and be guaranteed that any guest will be simply delighted. ""Hats Off"" to the Wiener Staatsoper for such a wonderful production. Above all Amazon .com are to be congratulated for  making it possible to purchase this DVD in time for Christmas.",1322179200,2,577,4.74
4839185,5,B005MYEQ9U,"Even with all those books, websites and television series about Henry VIII, it is still hard to gauge his true character and his motives. Historians differ...Even the British, I understand.  About twenty years ago there was an Anna Bolena performance in la Monnaie, Brussels.  The performance was sponsored by a large international organization, and its chairman praised it during supper afterwards.  This chairman, being British, said he enjoyed the opera, but then he hesitated, realizing all this had happened in his ""beloved"" country...
I have seen the television series, I have read some books.  I guess that this magnificent video expresses everything that can be expressed about the history of Anna Bolena.
All characters are very meticulously casted.  They perfectly fit the images I made based on books, historical articles and television.  I do recognize the main characters, Anna, Jane, the King, Percy...  They are what I imagined they should be.  With all their emotions, with all their motives, with all their personality.  This is not only magnificent belcanto, but also magnificent drama and tragedy.
The music is outstanding, all performers sing outstandingly, the choir and orchestra are outstanding, the production is outstanding.  And it all fits together.  Go and buy this dvd!",1322092800,5,1298,5.344827586206897
4839186,4,B005MYEQ9U,"Wow got this DVD from Amazon three days ago and have watched it three times....what a great opera!  Too bad it is not more routinely staged...the music is fantastic..................In this production the two real standouts were the Vienna Opera Orchestra and the great Elina Garanca.  Anna Netrebko looks great but honestly she cannot sing belcanto to save her life.........why does she continue to embarass herself by singing this kind of opera?  She really looks bad when paired with Garanca who is the best female voice on the planet and who sings belcanto with authority.

In spite of all this, this is a great opera and so much fun to watch...............I really want to see the two other Donizetti Tudor queen operas.",1320883200,6,725,4.966942148760331
4839187,5,B005MYEQ9U,"Well I'll give it five stars! This is a masterful, vivid presentation of a truly great opera; one of the very best of it's genre. Yes, this is Donizetti's first great international success. He would write many more great and not so great works numbering in the 70s but he would not exceed this tight,well crafted, non-stop drama to its forgone ending; a true work of genius. My introduction to this work dates to the late fifties when on radio I heard rebroadcasts of RIAA broadcasts of Callas in the role (with Simionato) from La Scala. I really got to know the work at NYC Opera with Sills and the subsequent recordings of the Donizetti Tudor Queens. If Callas was a tigress (and she was), Sills was affronted majesty, Gruberovna betrayed innocence but with Netrebko we have all three stages of development to the great climax at the end. You can quibble as some reviwers have about her voice type but in the end it's the art that Netrebko puts into the role that counts and this performance on the whole is simply great. I agree that the most satisfying scene is the Bolena/Seymour duet. The ice blond Garanca and the ravenhair Netrebko in a duo made in heaven. The male members do a good job in their roles. Meli's A! cosi neidi ridenti (an exquisite gem of a melody) was lackluster but he became more lyrical later in the opera. D'Arcangelo, not the handsomest face on the roster made a fervent creditable king. The costumes were excellent especially the two ladies gowns that complemented them so beautifully. Evelino Pido kept a tight reign on the entire undertaking and brought forth a truly magnificent performance.",1320883200,41,1624,4.701754385964913
4839188,3,B005MYEQ9U,"I hope the Met puts out this opera on DVD as I liked the production a bit better than this one from Vienna.  I love Garanca and she had to bow out of the Met's run due to pregnancy so I bought this for her performance as much as for Anna's.  The singer in the role of Henry wasn't as impressive as the Russian in the Met's version but the Russian singer of J. Seymore wasn't as good as Garanca.  The sets for the Met production were far superior as were the costumes.  I do love this opera and recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to hear great singing and I'm glad I have it in the collection.  It will do unless the Met issues theirs on DVD, then this one may sit on the shelf more often.  It was Anna's debut in the role and I though it excellent - but in the Met's - she was just stunning!!",1320710400,18,796,3.9130434782608696
4839189,5,B005MYEQ9U,"All three female principals in this opera are fantastic. Netrebko, Garanca and Kulman own the screen. They deliver a performance that will have you glued to your seat. I agree with some of the reviews I've read on Amazon regarding Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and Francesco Meli not being as strong as the part may demand, and I must say I preferred Ildar Abdrazakov as Henry VIII in the Metropolitan Opera's production this year. Ironically, he sang against Netrebko at the Met and was wonderful. It's really a small quibble. D'Arcangelo and Meli deliver world-class performances and they are wonderful voices against Netrebko and Garanca.

In addition, the Vienna Opera Orchestra will leave you breathless with this performance. The music took on a dimension I haven't heard with other productions of Anna Bolena, so it was like hearing it anew. Evelino Pid conducted this performance, and I was enthralled at his interpretation. Make sure to play it LOUD!

For my money, if you're an opera lover, this is a not-to-be-missed performance. At $29, you're crazy not to buy it!",1320364800,93,1069,5.033898305084746
4839190,3,B005MYEQ9U,"It is beautiful scenery. Like a Shakespeare drama. Anna was betrayed by her maid. They are both in love with the King Enrico VIII. The king is bored with Anna and wants to get rid of her. Along comes Percy. It is for the king the right opportunity to take action against them. Both are charged of adultery and are imprisoned. In the second part of the opera the maid wants to plead for forgiveness. They sing a beautiful duet. In the end Anna falls in a delusion and thinks of the younger Percy she had known in her youth. The aria of Anna is the best part in the opera. She gets executed with Percy, her brother and Smeton. The opera had beautiful actors. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo plays the king, Anna Netrebko plays the queen, and Elina Garanca plays the maid. The brilliant voice in this opera is Elina Garanca. She had this clear high unique voice you know from her recordings. The other both voices are dominated by a dark voice not so often seen by them. Anna Netrebko had some highlights but Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is very disappointing. His voice is dark like he had a cold.",1320192000,11,1080,4.459595959595959
4839191,4,B005MYEQ9U,"Why not 5 stars for such luxuriously beautiful musical performance?
Indeed, the female singers almost scored perfect marks: Netrebko, Garanca and Elisabeth Kulman, all sung with flying colours, especially Kulman and Garanca, who displayed not only exceedingly good vocal timbres, but also tremendous portrayals. Anna Netrebko is better here than in MET's Lucia di Lammermoor, with perhaps the only reservation that hers isn't a true dramatic coloratura, and the last Scene is not as emotionally eruptive as it should be.
Garanca has a mesmerizing deep mezzo soprano with a vibrant top register that would easily put any top soprano to shame, and her duet wit Anna Netrebko is the high point of this performance, undoubtedly. Her coloratura technique is also rock solid. As Smeton,
Kulman's trouser role is also tremendously well sung and acted, almost the most vocally stunning performance of the evening, to many's real surprise. She sang with real limpid beauty, with a firm grasp of the bel canto style.
As for the male roles, I regret to say that they are less outstanding than the ladies.
First of all, I have a strong feeling that Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is severely miscast as Enrico VIII. He is neither regal nor powerful. His bass baritone is lyrical, but lacks the deep punch and squillo required of this role that previously was so well-portrayed by Cesare Siepi and other real basso. Visually, alas, the quasi-gypsie king hardly looked the part he was playing.
As for the 'lover', young tenor Francesco Melli's performance is highly variable. He has the goods, no doubt, but it does appear that he needs more experience and confidence to convince 'himself' that he IS the tenor for the big roles. As it is, his performance smacks tentativeness and though there are no lack of great moments, at many other instances his portrayal is not convincing enough.
Lastly, the sets and costumes are not historically informed, as Tudor women were not allowed to show off their hair as they do in this production.",1317513600,5,2012,5.008955223880597
4839192,5,B005MYEQ9U,"This opera arrived today and it went into the player as soon as the box was opened. If you are at all ""into"" bel canto, you must have and experience this performance. From a music standard, from a dramatic standard and from a technical standard, it is a hands down winner! In addition to having experienced this performance, I was able to attend my first ever Met HD simulcast of Anna Bolena on 10/15, featuring Anna Netrebko and an entirely different cast. If that performance gets onto DVD, I will have two splendid renditions of this opera.

But let's address this Anna first, because if you are reading this, it is this disc about which you are curious. First, the disc is qualitatively perfect. the picture is crisp, the colors are vivid and the sound in DTS is still a marvel to me. There is a real sense of ""being there""; if you have a good surround system, just disable the surround and then re-engage it. There is a sonic collapse to the front speakers which reverses to a sense of the ""house"" when the surround is clicked back on.

The conducting of this opera is splendid throughout. I have become real fan of Maestro Pido of late, especially in bel canto operas. You can see from the very opening of the overture how engaged he is in the score, and his work with the singers is impressive. Along with Marco Armiliato ( who conducted the Met performance ) and Antonio Popano, I think we have a cadre of talented and experienced bel canto interpreters on hand for the near future.

So, how do the singers do? With one exception, the performers sing and act at a very high level of excellence.

Netrebko's Anna is a vocal and dramatic tour de force. She is an exceptional performer. I know from reading esteemed reviewers here that many fault Netrebko for taking on such roles as this because of a lack of real coloratura, which is true: Netrebko is not a lyric coloratura soprano. What that means is that she will not be as agile on runs and trills and lacks the extreme upper range of the true coloratura. But roles like Anna are not just about trills and E flats. One reason that Anna Bolena was Donizetti's first breakthrough opera has to as much with dramatic intensity as with vocalism. What Netrebko does here is to bring the character of Anna to life, both musically and dramatically. If I want E flats, I can listen to Sutherland or Sills. The former, whose work I enjoy and who was in life a most gracious person, had little stage presence, while Sills was a formidable stage presence without the depth of Netrebko's voice.

Elina Garanca is also definitive in the role of Joanna. I think that along with Joyce Di Donato she is the best of the current mezzo stars. Elisabeth Kulman ( Smeton ) was new to me, but is also very talented from both the vocal and dramatic perspectives.

As far as the men are concened, Ildebrando D'Archangelo is a compelling Henry VIII. He is not as much of a bully as was the real Henry, but has no trouble negotiating the vocal aspects of the role, and being a bit older than is Ildar Abdrazakov, who sang the role in the Met HD performance, brings more believeability to the part. Francesco Meli ( Percy ) is very good vocally, but not as involved in his character as he might have been. His competiton in the Met version was the hugely talented Stephen Costello, with whom there is simply no comparison. But this did not dimish my enjoyment of and enthusiasm for this performance.

""Extras"" are limited to Mme. Garanca outlining the plots of the two acts. I wish there had been more. If the Met version makes it to disc, and I hope that it soon does, I really hope that the interview with the costumer is preserved. The Met Costumes are the real deal with wimples for the ladies and lots of lacing for all. Much historical research went into Met Costumes. In this DGG version, the costumes are not much like Tudor England.

My original review of the opera was based on having access to an ""unauthorized"" version of this same performance. I posted it when this set was in pre-release to alert bel canto fans of its merit. For reviewer integrity,it appears unedited below. while it was a recording of this exact performance, the DGG set, with better picture and incredible sound quality is a winner! One other thing: Amazon shows the total timing at 140 minutes; the actual performance runs a bit over three hours.

And one last teaser: in the Met simulcast it was announced that stage director David McVicar was planning on staging both Maria Stuarda and Roberto Devereux at the Met. With Anna Netrebko, one wonders?

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I have a DVD of this production of 4/7/2011 from a French HD telecast with the same principals singing. There's no DTS, nor is there any indexing and no English subtitles. It was a no brainer for me to pre-order this one, because the performance is simply outstanding. To me that means the singing, acting, staging, orchestra,etc. all work. They do! If you like Bel Canto, this is one to pick up and enjoy. I'll come back to this review in November when I have a chance to view DGG's release, but knowing the quality of their recent discs, I do not expect the rating to drop.",1316822400,66,5162,4.527896995708154

4839201,5,B005MYEQ9U,"The singing and acting of Elina Garanca is, once more, the highlight here as it is everywhere she sings. One of greatest mezzo sopranos?sopranos(??) since Shirley Verrett and Giulietta Simionato, along with  Christa Ludwig . Garanca;s phrasing here, her fioritore, tessitura are breathtaking. She is a singer who has worked on her gift and shaped it into an instrument that marks her as a prima donna, the first instrument in the opera.

Her confrontation with Anna Netrebko is wrenching, her reactions tol Enrico Ottavo's claims upon her are memorable, casting one back to 1957 when Simionato and Callas sang this same duet.

The other trail blazer here is the fantastic Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Henry VIII..no one can touch this performance, except James Morris. But this is better his..caressing, declamatory, destructive tones delivered at Anna Bolena. His demand that Gionanna Sey mour love him and him alone..startling!

It is a fest of bel canto.

Anna Netrebko has sung this part at the Met, after this performance. This one is her best for this role. She is more secure, less uninvolved, stronger high notes, fabulous pianissimo, especially in her rendition of ""Al dolce guidami"" in the final scene. She had high e flats, but after singing more Russian operas they disappeared, or she just lost them. In any case, she is very good, and anyone who would tackle this role, practically complete, deserves all the hurrahs there are to give. Anna Netrebko needed to learn Italian, as Eilina Garanca did..and she is from Latvia speaking a language that has no affiliations with Italian, and she is letter perfect..as she is in English in her interviews after her electrifying Carmen.

A magnificent cast all through, great choral work,,sets are sparse but the costumes are without equal. The time of Henry VIII was a black period, so the funereal mood s\truck here is appropriate.. Buy this and be transfixed.

Also, buy Garanca's Carmen..a conclusion that had the Met audience stunned, shocked, and silent.",1403913600,9,2011,5.094224924012158
4839202,5,B005MYEQ9U,"As one who would enjoy seeing anything that features Anna Netrebko I'm not exactly an objective critic but look at the rest of the cast: Elina Garanca's incredibly beautiful and generous mezzo soprano and the multi-talented Ildebrando D'Arcangelo  who portrays a very unlikeable Henry VIII very convincingly. Young Francesco Meli sings with a beautiful lyrical tenor voice but he seems a little too young to be Anna Bolena's former beau. Elisabeth Kulman as Seaton is very convincing as Anna's secret admirer and also sings beautifully. I liked the minimalistic but essential staging, leaving much to the imagination and not distracting from the music and the singing. In contrast the costumes were elaborate and period appropriate. I thought the entire cast was well chosen and I'm enjoying this DVD very much- again and again.",1402790400,4,828,5.225563909774436
4839203,5,B005MYEQ9U,"By the time I received my DVD in the mail on 5/30/14, I had already watched the Bolen/Seymour duet at least five times on youtube. I couldn't know for sure what was going on (no subtitles) but I knew it was an INTENSE situation indeed. I very much admired the acting ability of both ladies. I've been a fan of both of them for a few months and have seen that they perform together often. When I watched several times (with English subs), I really enjoyed and was moved by it.
  Also, the scene with Seymour and the King a little later shows just how great Elina Garanca really is. A true Bel Canto performance. I know I will watch this opera many more times.

There are beautifully sung solo, duets trios and emselbles as well as perfect choruses.

I am most impressed with Donizetti and the libretto. I love that one of the least likeable characters in English history can generate such pity and empathy with the help of a good libretto and a perfect score.

The costumes were the only imperfection, not bad but not perfect.  Everything else even the ovations were all you could hope for in a DVD.

Enrico, Anna and Seymore could not have been more perfectly cast for voice.

4839207,5,B005MYEQ9U,"Netrebko is the first singer after Callas who can actually sing all the notes written in the score both low and high. She does not add fioritura in order to hide her inadequate low register (Gruberova Sills) and she is not afraid of her top notes plus she is in excelent vocal form - added to all that she is magnificent to look at from an acting point of view.
Truly the first descent Bolena after Callas'",1386288000,3,406,4.285714285714286
4839208,5,B005MYEQ9U,"First, the less than stellar:

 1) the stage scenery was inappropriate to the era of the early and mid 16th century. This is especially so, in the early part of Act 3, during which we clearly see an overhead bank of florescent light fixtures, while Anne Boleyns (Anna Bolena) ladies-in-waiting make their entry into the hall. The rest of the set looked like steel girder framework, with vertically-moving tambour panels of brick, also not appropriate to the era.

 2) Elna Garanas voice is excellent; however, her ability to express emotion reminds me much of Joyce DiDonato. Both just stand and deliver, with no effective emotion or the wrong emotions presented.

 3) When we have the appearance of Elizabeth 1st, Annes and Henrys daughter, in Act 3, were presented with a young girl, of about the age of nine or ten, with blond hair. Elizabeth was a redhead and could have been no more than two and one-half years old, when Anne was executed. Anne and Henry were only married for a bit more than 3 years: January 25th, 1533~May 19th, 1536 and Elizabeth was born on the 7th of September, 1533, which confirms that Anne was early into her pregnancy, when they married. Annes execution took place on May 19th, 1536.

 I can appreciate not wanting to dye the hair of a child but a simple wig would have sufficed, to make that more accurate and a more age-appropriate child would have been more realistic, if she had to be included at all, which was not necessary to the operas drama.

 Now, the good:

 All of the costumes were period appropriate, even though we do see some obvious zippers, in some of them, especially in that of Jane Seymours (Giovanna Seymour).gray and silver costume, in the latter part of Act 3, as well as some of the mens armor costumes, at various times.

 The quality of the singing, in general, plus the correct and appropriate emotions, were outstandingly presented, except as noted, above. Netrebko was magnificent!

4839222,4,B005MYEQ9U,"This beautiful, intense opera fell out of favor because of a preference for love stories and novelties. But in 2011 the work was revived for Anna Netrebko, perhaps the greatest dramatic soprano of the decade. The staging for the Vienna State Opera production is basic, and the costumes show that they are made of light, modern materials, but the singing is incredible. Netrebko as Anne Bolyen and beautiful Elina Garanca as Jane Seymour are outstanding, especially in Act II. There is no sign of strain in their voices, even in what seem like extremely difficult passages. The recent Met production with Netrebko was visually more compelling, but I think this production is a little better. The last few minutes -- in which Boleyn's young daughter, Elizabeth, appears wordlessly and sees her mother's (simulated) execution -- are striking. This two disc set is something that may lead you to go out and tell others about it.",1357171200,,924,4.967741935483871
4839223,3,B005MYEQ9U,"Recently I watched the July 1986 Bregenzer Fest production conducted by Patane on the web, and by Jove, I like that one much more than this 2011 production, though also in Vienna!
Viennesse audiences are probably too forgetful,especially the media, to hail this version as the best since Callas and Sutherland.
Netrebko has more voice than Katia Ricciarelli in 1986 (a rather late period of the latter's career), but in termsm of vocal acting and drama, Katia is miles ahead of Anna.  Katia's singing is not only much more stylish (she has ALL then fiorature), her ability to shade phrases and bring out nuances are something that are so evidently superior to Netrebko's rather basic rendition.
As for Seymour, Garanca is on par with Tocysz vocally, but notn dramatically.  Her Seymour is an rather insipid character, and it is difficult to figure out why Henry VIII would fall for her in Boleyn's stead.
Nestrenko is, even if no longer in his vocal prime, a preferred King Henry over D'arcahgelo, who was ill in this performance, alas.
The major difference between this and the Bregenz performance is the scene between Bolene and Percy.  In then Bregenz version, the Percy was portrayed ton great artistic height (not just vocal or muscial, but also dramatic) by Francisco Araiza, who sung all the high notes of the role without the slightest qualm, and gave the character of Percy such a colourful portrayal that really stands on full footing with the rest of Henry, Seymour and Boleyn, some thing that NO single tenor is capable of today! Not least Meli here.",1356220800,8,1562,4.864661654135339

Garanca is more on style here and her voice blends perfectly with Netrebko's. I didn't care so much about the production. A dull scene with lavish costumes but static, and with little interest apart from looking at the gorgeous dresses. The Wienners sound glorious, even with a 'routinier' like Pid. There are many cuts, most the cabalettas are abridged. Also the confrontation scene from Act 2 is heavily cut.",1346371200,3,748,4.897637795275591
4839227,5,B005MYEQ9U,"""Success, triumph, delirium -- it seemed the public had gone mad. Everyone says they cannot recall a triumph so complete.""
The words are Donizetti's, writing home after the premiere of his Anna Bolena at Milan on 26 December, 1830. The role of the heroine was then sung by Giuditta Pasta, the astonishing soprano who on that same day the following year was to be the first Norma, who earlier in 1831 sang Amina in the premiere of Bellini's La sonnambula and in 1833 created the role of Donizetti's Beatrice di Tenda.

Operatic legend once had it that in the autumn of 1830--whose beginning saw the premiere in Paris of that source of the romantic movement, Victor Hugo's Hernani--both Bellini and Donizetti were working at Lake Corno on operatic commissions from the impresario of the Teatro Carcano, Milan, Bellini staying at Moltrasio with Giuditta Turina on one side, Donizetti on the other at Blevio with Giuditta Pasta. Each composer had a libretto from the celebrated Felice Romani and each was determined to outdo the other. Like mostt legends, the facts are a little different; Donizetti's libretto for Anna Bolena was in his hands on November 10th (the composition was finished by December 10th), Bellini's for La Sonnambula only in December.

At the time of Donizetti's death, the critic of the Revue des Deux Mondes pointed to five of his operas as most likely to survive: Lucia, La Favorite, L'Elisir, Don Pasquale and Anna Bolena, and certainly the opera was in as high favor with the public as with prima donnas, who found a perfect vehicle for their gifts in Anna's `Piangete voi?' and `Al dolce guidami', a mad scene to vie with those from Sonnambula and Puritani, Lucia and Linda. In the 1950's, Anna Bolena was one of the most successful of the several operas to benefit from the revival of interest in bel canto that owed its impulse initially to the sovereign interpretative powers of Maria Callas.

It was with Callas in the title role and in a magnificent production by Luchino Visconti that the opera triumphed at la Scala in 1957, repeating the delirious success of the premier 127 years earlier.  Alas, we do not have a video with aforementioned Queens of bel canto; yet how fortunate we are to see the new Queen making her regal entrance in the role.

La Netrebko is so glorious as the wounded Queen that it is quite difficult to imagine anyone in the past possibly being better.  The beauty of her tone, the richness and evenness of her timbre are simply unique; perhaps Callas sounded as great at a live performance, but from the recording we can hear a very expressive performance&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donizetti-Anna-Bolena-complete-opera-live-1957-with-Maria-Callas-Gianni-Raimondi-Gianandrea-Gavazzeni-Orchestra-Chorus-of-La-Scala-Milan/dp/B00000630Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donizetti: Anna Bolena (complete opera live 1957) with Maria Callas, Gianni Raimondi, Gianandrea Gavazzeni, Orchestra & Chorus of La Scala, Milan</a>&nbsp;but not as impressive vocally as Netrebko's extraordinary interpretation.

Anna's Anna captivates the audience with the plush sensuality of her voice, chiseled phrasing, highly nuanced attack.  No wilting violet is she, but a proud and ferocious tigress, just as the real Anna Boleyn was in real life.  It was that extraordinary strength of her character and celebrated intelligence that warranted her demise from the crowned male filled with deep-seated insecurity and inferiority, obviously grounded in impaired sexuality.  As often happens in such unions, the weak and inferior initially strongly admires an exceptional figure, as Anna Boleyn was when returned from France - highly educated, cultured, elegant and enthralling; but then, unable to measure up, destroys the source of the constant reminder of own inadequacy.

It must be said that the historic Anna Bolena was not just an innocent victim;  she was a highly energetic intrigant actively involved in the plot against Henry VIII first wife Catherine of Aragon, and even more infamously, in the execution of Sir Thomas More.  The latter tragedy is a conspicuous parallel to another royal story of Poppea, whose influence over Nero brought the downfall of Seneca&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monteverdi-L-Incoronazione-di-Poppea/dp/B000JJSRMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monteverdi - L'Incoronazione di Poppea</a>.

I could not fail to notice a few parallels with another fascinating doomed heroine of the opera, although a very different one - Manon Lescault by Puccini.  As with Anna Bolena being Donizetti's first opera,  same is true for Puccini's Manon Lescault.  And as with Donizetti's Anna, it was the scheming brother in both operas whose reckless insistence brings about the sister's destruction.

Another star in the evening was Elina Garanca, and really judging by these two ladies physical and vocal beauty one can appreciate the opportunities of choice available to powerful tyrants.  Garanca gives equally stunning performance as Netrebko; her luscious mezzo is a perfect match for the incomparable soprano.  I also loved the historical accuracy of their portraits - Anna was a brunette, while Jane Seymor was a blonde, and a younger one, too, although no one could call Garanca's Seymor submissive - something that according to historic accounts was her main quality that attracted the desperate despot.

Henry VIII probably never looked such a sexy brute as Ildebrando d'Arcangelo.  His famous Holbein's portrait&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-VIII-Holbein-Earl-of-Egremont-Wm-Derby-T-A-Dean/dp/B007WUW02W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry VIII,Holbein,Earl of Egremont ;Wm. Derby,T A Dean</a>&nbsp;shows us quite an abominable figure, matched by his misdeeds.  Yet d'Arcangelo gives a formidable performance.  The decidedly covered tone adopted throughout his range brought the most menacing nuance to its finest.

Francesco Meli's Lord Riccardo Percy was excellent, although his squillo was at times forced and his timbre thin in the top of his range.  I saw him in live performances a few times - once in Pesaro in 2006 where he was simply sensational, and another time last October in Parma, at Verdi's Requiem, where he was astonishing.  But this role is obviously larger than Requem's tenor, and although he is still so great in it, it seemed as he struggled a bit at times with its demands.  I do admire his singing here nevertheless, because while there are recordings with great voices singing Percy, we don't know how they would sound in a live performance.  My most recent experience at Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino was quite poor when it comes to Percy - it's enough to hear a very mediocre one (it was Shalva Mucheria) to appreciate the mastery of Franceso Meli.

Elisabeth Kulman was very good as Smeton, although this is the only role that the Florentine production provided at the same level - Jose Maria Lo Monaco was as eqally delighful Smeton.  Lo Monaco is quite an comparable contralto.

And one of the main reasons which made this Vienna production such a delirious triumph was the musical direction of Evelino Pido.  He drew magnificent playing from Weiner Staatsoper orchestra.  He mastered the emotional ebb and stylish restrain, never once overwhelming a voice, allowing us to savor every syllable of this deeply felt interpetation of an opera that can be rightfully considered Donizetti's masterpiece.  I had an opportunity to further appreciate Evelino Pido's genius when I was at Rossini's Otello in Brussels this May; he made a sensational representation of that opera that otherwise remains in  obscure slumber on a few recordings available.  Truly there is nothing that can replace a live performance of a piece of classical music, and it is a wonder of life when it exceeds all possible expectations.

For me, every moment on March 15, 2012 in Teatro del Maggio  where I was listening to ""Anna Bolena"" with Mariella Devia in the title role and Sonia Ganassi as Jane Seymor was ringing with memories of this Viennese musical feast.  Even though the Teatro del Maggio production by Graham Vick was much more lavish, ornate and inventive, it could not save the vocal deficiency of most singers.  I include links in comments section for comparison.

This Anna's Anna is a must-see; a counsel already firmly supported by countless admirers, and in this case exceptionally well-deserved.

Bravissimi!",1342915200,4,8527,5.482047364400305
4839228,5,B005MYEQ9U,"This is a remarkably fine performance of Donizetti's first major success - his 31st opera. By that stage he had really learnt his craft and knew precisely how to sustain musical interest and tension. In this opera he has also got the advantage of an inherently dramatic moment in history as envisioned by a good librettist.

So how have the performers risen to this challenge? In my opinion the whole enterprise is very fine indeed.

Anna Netrebko in the title role gives a performance of real dramatic bite ranging from the reflective and forgiving to the passionate and fiery. She is totally on top of the considerable musical demands of the part. Her voice has also acquired an interesting greater richness and depth of tone and this is one of her finest performances to date.

Elina Garanca is well able to match Netrebko musically and delivers bel canto singing of great accuracy. This is well up to the exalted levels we have come to expect of this artist. The scena and duetto in Act 2 featuring these two fine singers is a high point of intensity creating real sparks of temperament. However the part of Seymour as one would expect does not carry the same dramatic or musical weight as the title role so the limelight rightly remains on Netrebko.

Ildebrando as Henry VIII is in good fine voice too with plenty of regal sonority to his voice and convincing acting. His confidence in the kingly role reminds one of his authoritive Escamillo role in the Royal Opera's production of Carmen.

The roles of Seaton, Percy and Rochefort are all capably sung and acted whilst not being a serious challenge to the three main stars of the opera. The chorus is effective in a rather static production - although, to be fair, this is also the way they were cast by Donizetti - rather like commentators on the unfolding events. Little room for action therefore.

The production values focus attention on the singing with little action to distract the attention. This would be unsatisfactory if the three main roles were not acted or sung so well. The costumes have caused some negative comments concerning Tudor period but I did not find this to be an issue that bothered me!

The recording is crystal clear as regards both visuals and surround sound and I found the camera work to be sympathetic to both the singers and the opera itself.

I would suggest that this recording warrants the full 5 stars and provides a phenomenal role that seems to suit Netrebko perfectly.

In summary therefore, I would suggest that this disc warrants very serious consideration from anyone interested in purchasing a good, modern recording of this relatively rare work which offers both fine performance and production credentials.",1342224000,,2710,4.810752688172043

I decided to buy this DVD when I saw the Metropolitan Production on PBS public television which I enjoyed very much, both are very good, but my interest now is to write about the one that I bought.
I knew some of the cast: Anna Netrebko ,Elena Garanca and Idelbrando D'Arcangelo from other productions, and I could see their transformations in each of the roles they had previously done.
The main character, Anna Bolena played by Anna Netrebko was outstanding; she had to show great stamina to maintain the power of her role singing for a very long time and acting at the same time to be able to perform the complexity of this character.
Enrico VIII and Giovanna Seymour played by D'Arcangelo and Elena Garanca respectively were in a similar level as the main character. The rest of the cast was very good.
At the beginning of the opera Enrico VIII has an affair with Giovanna Seymour and wants to annuli his marriage with Anna Bolena ,to do so he has to make a plan to probe that she is the one who is unfaithful ,to achieve this plan he looks for Lord Richard Percy  who is in love with Anna and after falls in the trap, Smeton, a page who also is in love with Anna is caught and tortured until he admitted that she is unfaithful. Enrico  tried to press her to admit that she has an affair ,she denies even though she later admit that she is in love with Percy and they were married before she met and marry the king.
Enrico VIII is a very cruel man an condemns all the people who are in the plot: Lord Richard Percy, Anna's brother, Smeton and of course Anna who later is executed which was very dramatically shown at the end of the opera.
The direction of this performance was perfect as well as the costumes and scenery which showed the era of Enrico VIII as well as England at that time.
The performers were very powerful .The music is very beautiful like all Donizetti's compositions.
The quality of the DVD is outstanding I gave it 5 stars.",1335484800,,2127,4.7588075880758804

I have seen that production both at the Met and in the HD broadcasts (which presumably will be released on DVD soon).  There are those who are waiting for the Met performance, but in my opinion, the Vienna production is superior on all counts.  Vocally there will not be much to choose from in Netrebko's performances, but Garencia is a marvel, and the rest of the cast holds up very well.  Visually, the Met performance prided it self on authenticity, but authenticity does not necessarily translate in to theatricality.

4839233,5,B005MYEQ9U,"Quick and dirty summary: This is an excellent production, very well conducted and directed with three superb leads. Anna Bolena is one of most dramatic and musically deep Donizetti operas; it requires at least three singers (Anna, Jane Seymour and Enrico (Henry VIII) who can both sing bel canto lyric and virtuostic lines AND portray a real human being.  The characters in Anna are much deeper, truer to life than, say, in Lucia.  They are, of course, drawn from English history, Anna Bolena and Jane Seymour being the 2nd and 3rd wives of Henry VIII; Henry VIII being the king who broke off from the Roman Catholic Church and founded the Anglican Church, the English State Church and the mother of our Episcopalian Church.
  In the twentieth century when Anna returned to the repetoire, it was through the medium of Maria Callas who sang Anna in the pathbreaking La Scala production of 1957. So far no one has come close to matching Callas in this role, her combination of force, fury, plangent lyricism and beautiful line are thus far unique.  Anna Netrebko, in this production, comes closer than anyone I have heard.  She lacks Callas' plangent lyricism (her lyricism is merely nice), but her fury is something to behold and she always holds the stage when she is on it.  I have hopes of seeing her sing Medea and Norma, two other great Callas roles.  (Side note: I love opera DVDs but they carry the danger of too many closeups and letting the viewer confuse opera Hollywood movies)  The reviewer who whined about Netrebko gaining weight is descriptively correct but unkind.  And, it's truly none of his/her business since it doesnt effect her performance.)  Truly matched with Netrebko is the Seymour of Elina Garanca. who sings spectacularly, beautifully, and intelligently and is so charismatic on stage that even when she and Netrebko are duetting, it is hard not to watch Garanca.  Ildebrando D'Arcangelo very good at Henry VIII, appropriately filling the stage with his fury.  All he lacks is a genuinely deep bass voice (his is closer to a bass-baritone and is a bit too light) but he holds his own.  The tenor is fair; Elizabeth Kulman as Smeaton is much better than fair. Between the conductor, director, and the three main leads the beauty, passion and drama of this fine opera are powerfully set before us.",1327104000,7,2322,4.816120906801007

All of the performances were strong & the staging of the end of the opera, with Anna in the Tower of London (I won't give it away) was truly moving.  Beautifully done by all.  This is a monumental role in Netrebko's career & will be remembered for a long time.  A must see for any opera fan, especially someone who likes Netrebko.",1325635200,6,583,4.178571428571429
4839237,5,B005MYEQ9U,"Anna Netrebko as Anna Bolena is amazing to say the least.  She truly captures the full range of emotions of the doomed queen in both her acting and her singing.  Elina Garanca is wonderful as Seymour and Elizabeth Kulman was brilliant as Smeton.  The music is awe-inspiring in this set.  If you are a fan of Bel Canto opera or just a fan of Anna Netrebko, this is a MUST HAVE.

I have to say, however, that I much prefer the production (sets, costumes, and character interpretation) of the Met, which I hope they will release as well...my fingers are crossed.  The Vienna production of this set is minimalist and a bit abstract, which is okay, given the superb cast they had to work with.  However, there was such a richness of authenticity and story in the Met's production which I felt was largely absent in this production.

I thought Gubanova's interpretation of Seymour (at the Met) as a more tortured/conflicted lover much more powerful than what often feels like Garanca's ""ice queen.""  During the first act her portrayal of Seymour seems terribly calculating and uncaring.  It isn't until her duet with Anna and later with Enrico that Garanca acts out the anguish and confusion of her character...in this she was convincing and made her interpretation of the character work.  I also found Costello's Percy much more powerful, at least in terms of characterization/acting. Meli's singing is wonderful, but he often seems to just deliver the lines with little of the emotion Costello used so effectively.  However, all of this probably comes down to personal taste.

4839239,5,B005MYEQ9U,"Aristotle wrote that Tragedy is about a great mind living a reversal of fortune, because an inner drive (not external events) drives him/her towards self-knowledge and death: the performance must offer aesthetic pleasure. Anna Bolena fits the definition as few other operas can ever hope to (except of course when they are transcriptions of Sophocles, Shakespeare, Racine, and a very few others). No weepy drama, no red eyes when Bolena is judicially murdered. Felice Romano is a great poet! I am not a native speaker of Italian, but I do have the privilege of speaking a Latin Language. If you can, learn Italian, the payoff is huge. The plot is reasonably faithful to history, but that is irrelevant: it unveils a totally different, totally convincing vista: the hypothetical face-to-face conflict between Boleyn on her way to the scaffold and Seymour on hers to the throne. In real life it probably never happened; actually the real Jane Seymour was a simple lowly educated country girl. Giovanna Seumour is a Felice Romano character. But if you enjoy a truly mega-conflict of noble minds seek no further! Then there is the music. At his best, Donizetti is one to beat and here he is at his absolute peak best. The Wiener Statsoper, under Maestro Pid has been lavishly praised by others and I remember no other performance as good as this one. This is a brave new world of sound, the rendering of a complex elegant score, at one time dark and brilliant. Anna Netrebko remarked during a recent interview that Boleyn must have been quite a lady to make a king change the religion of an entire country ""simply"" to be able to marry her. So, said Netrebko, Bolena must die gloriously as the great Queen she was. Her madness is not lunacy like Lucia's, because it has method in it: she simply wonders back to her happy days, before walking to the scaffold. It is a historical fact that Boleyn died greatly. Anna's Bolena dies tragically and magnificently. I was not privileged to witnes La Callas, but I have her CD. She is definitive, but Anna is another of the wonders of the world. She may not have the coloratura agility but this is really immaterial. Here is Her Majesty, a Tragedy, as great as they come. When she solemnly declares  ""Cessa! A questa iniqua accusa mia dignit riprendo!"" you feel instinctively you should kneel. The voice is velvety dark (when was it anything else?) and how wonderfully does this reflect the great mind experiencing reversal of fortune. Then of course, there is Elina Regina Seymour. Whenever on stage, in farce, comedy or drama, Elina is never less than phenomenal. We have Roberto Alagna's word that she is the most complete Carmen. Her Giovanna Seymour is definitive. Her Majesty is exquisite, her acting brilliant but her timbre is out of this world. The legendary Bolena / Seymour duet, possibly one of the greatest moments in the history of music, is sung and acted but two very different, contrasting voices and actresses: verdict has to be, it has never been done this way before. Bravo to Donizetti and Romano who created this textual and musical marvel, bravissimo for Pid and his Wienners, but on you knees for Anna and Elina. Elizabeth Kulman is a great Smeton: first time I heard or saw her: she raises it to the higher level, sings and acts beautifully, and completes the ladies' dominant role in this production. The trouble in the plot (and in history) is how to believe that even a young Flemish musician could have been duped to confess what he did. The gentlemen are variable. Archangelo's Enrico is not sufficiently villainous. But everyone must make way for their Majesties. Not having a Callas video is as sad as all the lost Greek tragedies, but this DVD is way ahead of everything else so far! I saw (and loved) the Met production live: Netrebko may have surpassed herself (is that really possible?), Elina and Pid are head and shoulders higher, the Vienna gentlemen not as good, but I would like to have the Met DVD to compare. Let's hope it can match this Viennese glory. Not an easy order. If you like bel canto you must have this. A gripping story that runs before your eyes before you can take yourself away from it.

Netrebko has put on a little weight so is not quite as super slim as previously but, if anything, it has added a mellowness to her voice without losing any of the power of a great soprano.  Her acting is utterly convincing.

If you love opera and the female voice in particular, you are guaranteed an enthralling experience.  And the music itself, completely new to me, is a revelation in the best company that anything offered by Verdi or Puccini. Add in a plot based on history, and you end up with a great package.
