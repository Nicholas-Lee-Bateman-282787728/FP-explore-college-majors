3526936,4,B001D7T6D6,"In my opinion, Les Miserables is the best movie of all time. It has a powerful moral message which is enhanced by the book by Victor Hugo. This is a movie you will want to see over and over. House of Mirth, not so good.  Too complicated for us old folks, maybe it will be better the second time.",1405900800,,295,4.0
3526937,5,B001D7T6D6,I just love romances of the traditional ethical bent. True this story is that of a fall but there is redemption.,1390521600,,112,4.380952380952381
3526938,3,B001D7T6D6,"The house of Mirth was a disappointing movie. It's the whole over-all story that is slow and ''not much there''. The film it's self is beautiful and the acting was good,,,,but it shows the stuggles? I guess of women in that era trying to ''make it'' through a rich marriage.
Les Miserables,,,I 'liked',,,,bought it because I like Liam Neeson in it.......but again the story could have been better in this many done again film. The scenes skipped around. I still liked Liam in it and his co stars were good too. It's not bad, but I would have saved my money.",1374796800,,557,4.524752475247524
3526939,4,B001D7T6D6,This is a 2 disc set. Les Misrables has a good cast with strong and good performances. Liam Neeson delivers one of his best drama performances. I have to mention I have not read the book. This movie is hard to get so I decided to buy this double feature. The House of Mirth was just a bonus. I am not a big fan of dramas but I like Les Misrables sense of mystery. There are a lot of emotional moments here. The movie is in English with optional English/French subtitles (widescreen). The House of Mirth is in English with optional English/Spanish/French subtitles.,1365206400,8,564,4.485436893203883
3526940,5,B001D7T6D6,"Liam Neeson is one of my many favorite actors.  He did a really good acting job in Les Miserables.  I read the book in school and enjoyed it.  After many years, to see the movie was to bring back the memories of the book I so enjoyed.",1363219200,,234,3.9361702127659575

8292172,5,B001D7T6D6,Gillian Anderson is a wonderful actress who transforms herself into the character she is playing.  Great cast and a movie you can easily re-watch.,1493424000,,146,5.083333333333333

8292177,5,B001D7T6D6,"The performances of Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush are priceless in Les Miserables, though it seems to be somewhat less interesting after Valjean successfully establishes himself in Paris.  The House of Mirth is captivating in the way we are immersed in the mores and machinations of high society in that era.  I bought this for Les Miserables, but I found The House of Mirtth to be the more precious gem.",1426377600,2,404,4.757142857142857

8292180,5,B001D7T6D6,"I haven't watched Les Mis yet, but House of Mirth is faithful to Wharton's novel, even given the necessary compression (fewer characters and situations) in translating a novel to film. The Laurence Selden character seemed miscast to me, otherwise the casting and acting are first rate.",1413331200,4,285,5.217391304347826
