2649365,3,B000I0QLTG,"It seems tradinonal for most comic companys to have their heros forme a group. DC has JLA, as well as JSA, Teen Titans, etc. Marvel has the Avengers and so on. Thus it only seems natural for King Features to have their comic book heros team up. Fan boys like to see their heros in the same world team up and fight evil, they also like to see heros fight eachother to see whos better. Its a natural thing in the comic book world. thus its no surpise for these heros to join up to forme a team. I don't understand why so many complain about that aspect of this cartoon.

First off this was a great cartoon. Allthough admitdly of the main chartures, Flash Gordon is more well known. (Intrestingly this series was my first introduction to The Phantom). Secondly this series last for at least 65 episodes, long enough to maintain interest in the charture. In regards of Flash Gordon this series is my third favorit incarnation of the chartur. The first is the 80s movie, and the second the filmation series.

Now for a bit of background. Flash Gordon was a top althlet who was rocketed to Mongo to fight the evil tyrant Ming the Merciless. The Phantom is a hero who lives in the jungels and fights crime. (Hes like a cross between Tarzan and Zorro, but has his own special storyline). Mandrake the Magican is an illusionist who poses as a stage magigian and fights crime. His companion is Lothar (a rather uninteresting charture in the comics). what I liked with this series is that Lothar is upgraded to hero states. sure ok hes the token black guy, but he is such a great charture. its good to have him in this series. these three main chartures have previously had their own seprat comic strip adventures. for this cartoon all three join up to fight evil. Each brings something to the team, as the credits proclaim. Flash the pilot, Mandrak with his illusions, Phantom with his cunning, and Lothar brings strength. added to this are the young companions. first there is Flash's son, Rick. there is Lothar's son LJ (Lothar JR). The Phantom's daughter, Jeda, who can camunicat with the animals. finaly there is Mandrake's ward, Kashin. together they forme the Defenders fighting none other then Ming himself. (Ming seems the only big enough villain the heros could face, as Gordon has the only worth while reacuring villain on his roster.).

Flash has lost his wife to Ming's crulety (one of the few times a death is depicted in comics). she is never named on screan. allthough it would be hard to imagine Gordon marrying anyone other then Dale Arden. (I think in the four comic book series based on this cartoon she is even given that name.) However her memory lives on in the computer Dynac. Dynac is an artifial intelligence that at Ming's side are his computor Octon, his Ice warriors, and his treacherous son Kro-Tan. Ming also has a duaghter, but she is NOT named Aura. there are other villains as well. Interestingly there is the Phantoms evil brother, Kurt Walker, who becomes the Weather Demon. the Sky Band, old foes of the Phantom, the episode even retells the orginal storyline of that comic allthough breifly. the Defenders face many challenges along the way.

the setting is in the future, here Mongo is a desolat planet which Ming has used up its resourses, and he wants to claim the earth. the Defenders attempt to stop his plans. there are some interesting episodes, such as when Jedda thinks her father is dead and she must take on his mantel. Krotan would later betray his father and attempt to take over Mongo, only to face a bigger threat. there is even an episode featuring someone I call the the 10th Defender, Prince Valiant of the Hal Foster comics. Valiant's son even makes an apperance. (allthough Valiant would get his own cartoon series much later on). its still nice to see him make an apperance here.through out this series there are many surpises and interesting episodes. some so so storys, but some good episodes.
(I wonder if the story Root of Evil was an early pilot since the art is so different.)

Again this is a rather good series I felt.
a unique cartoon series. well worth watching.",1253059200,8,4120,4.615279672578445
2649366,4,B000I0QLTG,Nice series. Graphics good for the 80's. Nice to see another universe besides Marvel and DC. The last 5 episodes in this set are the best.,1247702400,,138,4.346153846153846
2649367,4,B000I0QLTG,One of my favorite cartoons as a child. This cartoons brings back so many memories. My children even love it. Thank you for the condition of it and the delivery time.,1231200000,,166,4.387096774193548
2649368,4,B000I0QLTG,"I loved the Defnders of the Earth when I was a kid.  I remember rushing home to see it every day after school.  I've been looking for it for the past twenty years, convinced that I was the only one that still remembered the series with any fondness.  Yes, the animation is terrible (not bad for the time though) and the stories are sometimes a little hacknied but I still love it.

The extra features on the DVD are a little disappointing.  The one commentary track is great and I wish they'd done another.  They tended to repeat a lot of what they said in the commentary in the interviews.  It's also missing the advertised Flash Gordon animated episode.  Not a great loss, IMHO, but it makes the set look unfinished.",1227052800,2,718,4.427480916030534
2649369,3,B000I0QLTG,"as is the case, with most cartoons from my youth, Defenders Of The Earth was somewhat of a dissapointment. It was nowhere near as good as i remember. But all in all still a great purchase that i am happy to have in my collection.",1196380800,,229,4.111111111111111
2649370,5,B000I0QLTG,"Well, it's finally here: the 5-dvd set release of Defenders of the Earth, Volume One! This was one of the cartoons I used to look forward to watching every Saturday when I was a kid in the mid '80s. The short-lived Defenders of the Earth took three classic pulp adventure heroes from the comic strips published by King Features Syndicate - Flash Gordon, the Phantom, and Mandrake the Magician (and Mandrake's former manservant, now upgraded to hero in his own right, Lothar) - and banded them together against the great villain Ming the Merciless, who again is bent on invading Earth. Defenders of the Earth only lasted one season, in 1986, but still managed to churn out a mind-boggling 65 episodes!

The show also introduced a younger generation of heroes: Rick Gordon - Flash Gordon's brainy but brash son; Jedda Walker - the Phantom's daughter, who has telepathic powers; Kshin - Mandrake's adopted son, who is the magician's apprentice and who has an alien pet named Zuffy; Lothar Jr. (or LJ) - Rick's best friend, who's into martial arts and is also the son of Mandrake's friend Lothar. These kids did their own share of world saving, but, every now and then, also got in the way of the big three.

And let's not forget Dynak, the computer that the Defenders of the Earth heavily relied on. Here's the twist: in the first episode ""Escape from Mongo,"" Ming the Merciless had captured Flash Gordon's wife, Dale Arden Gordon, and was using brainwashing techniques to get her to tell him the whereabouts of Flash. Dale resisted, fatally. But, before she perished, her ""soul"" was saved into a crystal, which was then used as a power source for the computer Dynak.

Other changes that were made for the cartoon show: Ming's appearance was altered for us sensitive moderns; he went from bearing a haughty Fu Manchu countenance to a more alien, greenish, and, therefore, less offensive appearance. With the same thought in mind, Lothar, formerly Mandrake's manservant, was elevated to full hero status and was shown as more intelligent than he had been previously portrayed. Also, in the comic strips, Mandrake only had hypnotic powers. As a Defender, he drew on actual magic.

To folks out there who enjoy some darn good, hand-drawn animation and nicely paced adventure stories, and especially to those ""older"" folks who'd thrilled to the exploits of Flash Gordon, the Phantom, and Mandrake in the past, in their different incarnations and mediums, this dvd is a must have. I think Alex Raymond, who created Flash Gordon, and Lee Falk, who created the Phantom and Mandrake, would've been happy with this show. The episodes took place in outer space, in the jungles, in urban and exotic locales, which gave each of the three classic originals a spotlight to strut his stuff in his preferred environment. The youngsters, too, were showcased quite a bit, particularly Rick and Jedda, who possibly had a romance blooming. Kshin, as the youngest of the kids, had the most to prove (or so he thought), thus leading to several scrapes, none more dire than in the episode ""A Demon in His Pocket.""

Over the course of 65 episodes, the Defenders of the Earth, time and again, staved off invasion attempts by Ming the Merciless and his minions. But not every episode had Ming as the main baddie. Longtime foes also popped up to annoy the Defenders, such as in ""The Evil of Doctor Dark,"" where an old foe of Mandrake re-surfaces. Kurt Walker, who was the Phantom's brother but who became his enemy, was developed specially for this series. And, sometimes, Ming eschewed his armadas and blunt tactics and opted for more subtle ploys, as when he tricked the Defenders into entering the computer Dynak into a chess competition in ""Bits and Chips"" or when he took advantage of the latest Earth craze for household robotic aides in ""Ming's Household Help."" One of my favorite episodes was ""Terror in Time,"" wherein the Defenders time travelled back to the days of King Arthur and hooked up with Prince Valiant.

I remember the 1980s as a time when there were a lot of good cartoons on tv. I remember rushing home from school just to watch G.I. Joe, Transformers, Thundercats, He-Man, and Robotech. On Saturday mornings, I would wake up early (even before my parents woke up) just to watch Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, Battle of the Planets, Voltron, the SuperFriends, and the Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour. And, of course, Defenders of the Earth. God, I miss those Saturday mornings.

Anyway, hot on the trail of the excellent Flash Gordon: The Complete Series dvd collection, BCI does it right with Defenders of the Earth, Volume One with regards to the dvd extras. Special Features include an audio commentary on the pilot episode ""Escape from Mongo""; interviews with the show's creators; a full length animated storyboard with Interactive Comparison for Episode #126 ""Terror in Time""; an original presentation pilot for ""Defenders of the Earth"" featuring alternate characters and animation; image galleries; Dvd-ROM features: scripts, storyboards and the complete series Bible (PDF format, PC/Mac readable); detailed character profiles; trivia and fun facts. This dvd collection also comes with a booklet of episode guides and 2 ""Comic Strip Champions"" art cards (4"" X 6"") by comic book artists Rafael Kayanan and Mike Allred. Now, there's also supposed to be a bonus episode here from the Flash Gordon animated series - Episode #1 ""A Planet in Peril"" - but, for the life of me, I can't find it anywhere on the discs. But that probably has to do more with my being mechanically illiterate than anything else.

For those who hearken back fondly to their youth and for the new generations of youngsters who are curious about animated shows done before CGI really took off, this is surely worth dropping a few hard-earned dimes. And, needless to say, keep an eye out for Volume 2, which contains the remaining episodes, also imminently coming your way.

And here are the included 33 episodes (I know, the episode numbering's a bit wacko, but this is how the box set episode guide lists them, so who am I to argue?):

I took a chance on this 65-episode collection of the animated television series from 1985 and, to my amazement, scored a bullseye. The boy absolutely loves the stories and action. ""Papa"" hopes that one day he'll enjoy the comic strips from 1936 on. But, for now, I enjoy his excitement when the Ghost Who Walks takes on the ""power of 10 Tigers"" and defeats the evil minions of Ming the Merciless, long-time nemesis of Alex Raymond's  Flash Gordon.

however, like a lot of cartoons from the 80's, there are so many episodes that just doesn't have certain excitement factors in them... after 1 cd, i had to take a break from it and move on to the next series that i bought.

I'm here to buy, not to see what other people think about a movie or TV show. I will say that the transfers on these DVDs is very good. Not perfect, but they look better here than they did on my TV back when this show first aired, so that's an improvement.

The thing I will say is that these discs came packaged in a DVD box, but with the DVDs in little black sleeves inside the box. That doesn't really matter, as long as the discs are protected. But the thing is, I don't know if they protect, as the first side of the second disc (Oh, did I mention the discs are double-sided. Yuck!) had a big scratch on it. I could see the scratch before even taking it out of the sleeve (the front of the sleeves have a clear plastic to see through) & naturally, the disc didn't play. Figuring I should return it, I see that it would have cost me money to do so, & since I paid $10 for it anyway, decided to keep it as is, with 8 or so episodes unwatchable.

So a bit of a disappointment, but at least I can see most of them. If not for this disc being damaged, I would give my review 4 stars.",1288396800,10,1223,3.967479674796748

2649439,2,B000I0QLTG,I was surprised at just how good this cartoon is from what I remember it. The characters a brill: Flash Gordon and the Phantom together in one cartoon. It has to have the best theme music ever created for a cartoon - including anime. Sadly though the disgustingly cheap presentation of this box set ruins it. The DVD's come in paper bags which are placed inside the case. The picture on the outer box looks photocopied. When I received it I first thought it was a bootleg copy. Still it's a cheap way to get all the episodes and the quality of the picture and sound on the disks is good. It really is one of the best cartoons to come out of the 80's. The animation is far ahead of others at this time. The stories are good too and all the characters except for maybe the little monster thing called Snarf. Could've done without him.,1277942400,9,832,4.305732484076433

Every single solitary listing of features on the set (which I bought new and still in shrink wrap) lists the missing features, and with no manufacturer's note about them included, you are left to discover it for yourself.

Likely not a big deal to most, but it was the series bible PDF that really sold me on getting this set. The worst part is that the original manufacturer is out of business, so there's no one to complain to.",1262995200,,674,4.524590163934426
