Now normally, you can watch it on the internet. But hey, what's better than watching your favorite internet cartoon while snuggling with your girlfriend?? This is actually great for any age. It's clean and still very hilarious. My mom even likes it! So I have no complaints about this one! Hope you guys enjoy as much as we do.",1231286400,,478,4.263736263736264
