1802342,5,B000077VQ4,"I have never seen KoRn live, but I have seen many shows on MTV (after the release of ""Untouchables"", MTV's done about 15 things on KoRn) and have seen them on TV.

1802343,5,B000077VQ4,"Any KoRn fan, like myself, will greatly appreciate the release of this dvd.  I don't think much needs to be said about it, I just wanted to be the first person to review this great dvd.
KoRn LIVE!  JUST BUY IT!  ...",1037059200,,215,4.071428571428571
1802354,5,B000077VQ4,"KoRn just surprised me. I haven't had great expectation on seeing them live on stage. Always thought Davis' voice was a kind way weak on the stage but at this point I should review my opinion on that.

Not only KoRn's singer performs well on this show as the whole band do it fairly.

Bottom line is that this footage will entertain you for sure because they honestly did sweat to make it genuine.

Technicaly and musicaly this was a great show.",1152230400,,445,4.402439024390244
1802355,3,B000077VQ4,"This concert DVD of Korn was just about okay. They are pretty heavy and if you enjoy hard rock, this shall please you. Alot of there songs do sound the same with the same riffs, so if you like variety, you may be dissapointed. And also, Korn is by no means metal. If you are looking for something in the metal genre, look somewhere else.",1128384000,,337,4.2
1802356,3,B000077VQ4,"This DVD Korn released was most likely a response to the low sales of Untouchables (their worst album, my opinion). But with that fact aside, let's look at what we have here.  Two DVDs, 15 songs, and parts of two other songs as Make me bad is combined with One and Justin (Justin isn't labeled on the back of the case and both are only segments of the whole songs.  Korn Should have played One in it's entirety as they were rushed yet again when they first performed it and therefore shortened it from 9 to 5 minutes.  Well that's just my opinion, but they do play the best part of the song (""Darkness, imprisoning me, all that I see, Absolute horror!"").  There are a few standouts in the concert but there is just something not right.  The director cuts and edits like crazy, sometimes finnaly frustrating you so much, you find yourself yelling at the TV.  This is evident mostly at the opener Here to Stay.  Several times he will cut to something for less then a second, thus you'll find yourself asking yet again ""what was the point of that cut?""

Other then the editing job, the song selection is a problem.  They only Picked Twist and A.D.I.D.A.S. from Life is Peachy (My favorite Korn album), which disappointed me to no end.  Most of their songs are the ""light"" singles that receive all the airplay, ignoring other classics like Good God, Ball Tongue, Need To, Dead bodies Everywhere, Etc. But Korn's delivery is the top thing here that irritates me.  It's actually very boring most of the time.  Jon has clearly aged as he hardly moves around on stage at all anymore.  I have a film of them playing at Woodstock 99 and Jon is jumping around like crazy, moving all over the stage.  Here Jon has clearly lost the energy.  I don't blame them, they all have had kids by now and age has taken its toll.  This also shows throughout with the other band members as well, but it's most obvious with Jon.  As for the extras on disc 2, the alternate version is audio of the concert with just the giant screen that played behind them, showing disturbing pictures and the like.  Although interesting at first, one can hardly watch the concert like this all the way through.  The only thing worth while is the really, really short behind the scenes documentary.  They didn't include any other bonus material, no music videos, no Easter eggs, nothing.  Well if you have never seen Korn live before, this makes a great gift, but otherwise, you can skip this, there's nothing special about it, but then again there is nothing terrible either.  Hoped this helped.",1117929600,4,2553,4.540481400437637
1802357,4,B000077VQ4,"I enjoy KoRn. But this DVD went over the top I think. I picked it up today and placed Disc 1 (there are 2 discs for those of you that don't know) into my DVD player. Checked to make sure that 5.1 was on and then let the concert roll. I started out like what was happening. The camera changing so much. Then it slowed down a little and I was like, ok this is pretty good. One thing you should know, I am 15. You should know that because all the camera effects, strobe lights, etc. started to hurt my eyes. Normally I love strobes and all that, but this was to much. I haven't started disc 2 yet so I can't tell you how that is. The audio quality of the concert is pretty good, could have made the voices a little bit louder. The video quality is great but they went way to far with camera cuts, etc. One other problem was, with all the speed, even my DVD player started to make the video block up at times.",1112659200,2,905,3.978021978021978
1802358,2,B000077VQ4,"I borrowed this DVD from my friend, who got held back in high school. As I went through it, I noticed something very strange and familiar. Most of Korn's fans are kids. Mostly kids buy their cd's. Jonathan Davis always sings about crap that happened to him when he was a kid. I then turned off the DVD when to go for a walk and ponder my maturity. I think Korn needs to grow up. I mean, they still put out good material, but they need a new quality to appeal to. I have their self-titled album as well as Follow The Leader. Why are two-discs necessary?!",1108425600,,553,4.177570093457944
1802359,4,B000077VQ4,"I debated for some time on whether or not to give this DVD three stars or four stars. Consider my rating as a weak four star.

The audio quality is quite good as well as the visuals. The lead singer's voice is weak at times, but, overall, he does sound good and pulls off some fun vocal ranges.

The editor gets a little carried away with the post production effects, and the editing is a little frenetic at times.

Nonetheless, here's the bottom line - I enjoyed the DVD. I cranked up the sound system and really had fun watching and listening to the performance; and, more times than not, I enjoyed the effects that were added in.",1105142400,4,632,4.338983050847458
1802360,4,B000077VQ4,"I am a huge Korn fan, so I went out and bought this DVD right when it came out.  I love watching Korn live.  They are probably my favorite live act, considering I have seen them live 5 times so far and every show has been amazing.  They play a lot of great songs. Yes most of them are their singles, but oh well, all those songs are great.
What I did not like about this DVD is the ridiculous amount of camera changes and some of those unnecessary special effects they throw in, but hey that's not the bands fault; so don't rip on Korn for it.  Another thing is that Jon voice was a little weak on some songs... but I understand because it was Korn's first show in a long time, and Jon wasn't in his top form.
But other than that I love this DVD because I love watching Korn live, because they put on a great show every time.  So if you are a Korn fan you will love this DVD despite the camera changes, etc. So go out and get it if you don't already have it!",1085356800,2,958,3.94300518134715
1802361,4,B000077VQ4,"It's pretty good. There are some awesome graphics... the live show itself is pretty awesome. They completely nail every song, I didn't hear any mistakes. The only problem I have is that Head's guitar is too loud. When he goes into a lead it's hard to hear Munky. Other than that the DVD's awesome. And on the second disc there's a behind the scenes thing which is kinda cool. It could have been longer, but it's still good. They kinda try to fill up the second disc with the video that's playing behind them throughout the set. That's kinda dumb. I just watched the whole set and now you think I'm gonna listen to the whole thing again with a different video in front of me? Uh no.",1072483200,4,681,4.328125
1802362,5,B000077VQ4,"I have not bought the dvd yet but I know it will be rad. I think KoRn is the coolest band ever,you should buy this dvd. If you like rock then you will love KoRn!!!
  p.s.try to buy some KoRn
  albums too!! they're rad!",1070928000,2,218,3.8863636363636362
1802363,3,B000077VQ4,"I think having two discs was a waste of space, because on the second disk it's only the live show music with the background video playing, it is not a multi-angle option (like the dvd says).  Also the sound is just bad.  A lot of the guitars and stuff is just indistinguishable, I know Korn is capable of doing a lot better.  I guess I can give them a break considering they were just out of the recording studio when they filmed this, so they weren't quite warmed up to the live playing aspect.  But a lot of the sound problems occur in the eq'ing.  There are too many mid's, whoever engineered this should be shot because he did a bad job making the band sound their best.  It's a good effort, and I hope that Korn comes out with another live DVD showing their real talents.
ROCK ON!",1069718400,3,785,4.23489932885906
1802364,5,B000077VQ4,"this dvd is verrryyy good. it misses some very good songs like clown, good god.. the only weak point is the bass. all your hear is the song of the 5th string hitting the fretboard; it sounds a lot better on cds
the other things were already mentioned, like the camera that changes too fast, and the second dvd that it useless.
and the cover of 'one' it's only the end, the ""darkness, imprisonning me.."" .. don't expect metallica, if you've ever seen them live, you know how good it is ;)",1066089600,,487,4.304347826086956
1802365,4,B000077VQ4,"i will start with the only drawback for this live DVD.  i found the filming to be choppy.  for example, the camera is on johnathon and then blink, move to head or fieldy or whatever.  blink move blink move repeat.  the camera never stayed still long enough for me to focus.  it was quite annoying and difficult to adjust to.  this is why i could not give this 5 stars.
  other than this it was pretty damn good.  i did not expect the korn ""sound"" to come across in the dvd as well as it did.  i have seen korn 2x live and they have this incredible sound  that is really awesome on record.  it is 1000x sweeter live.  i was bowled over to hear that sound pumping thru my speakers as i watched the dvd.  korn is not a fan to take lightly.  there is an incredible amount of energy on stage as well as with the fans.  this all expldoes live and this dvd captured that. they captured the frantic and frentic vibe quite well.
  the show itself was quite awesome and having been to the hammerstein (what a phenominal place to see a show) i can say that this dvd captured that amazing show and all it had to offer.  from the opening of ""Here to stay"" thru their cover of ""one"" to the end with ""got the life"" this is one amazing show and the dvd gets it all.
  as for the features, when this show was played live, the band was not only recording but broadcasting to select movie theatres throughout the U.S.  they document the band and its plans to take on such a venture.  it was pretty cool.  you see the band in a very different light.  they got pretty nasty with the crew.  there are some alternate angles from the show and some remixes that are freaky.  all in all a worthwhile venture.  i had to own this.",1064793600,,1702,4.138036809815951

1802368,5,B000077VQ4,"KoRn is the best live act I have ever seen, no question.  The first time I went to their show I knew only their radio hits.  A buddy had an extra ticket, so I went.  I went to the show as an open-minded listener and left as a rabid fan!
Ever since that concert (and the two other times I've seen them live since) I have wanted a DVD that captured the frenetic energy of the band in a concert setting.  Family Values DVD only gives a brief glimpse, while Deuce DVD focuses on behind the scenes footage and the band's music videos.
Finally the band granted my wish and released ""KoRn Live"" DVD.  The live footage is taken from their CD release party performance at the Hammerstein Ballroom for the Untouchables disk.  This footage was broadcast to KoRn fans at various lucky movie theaters across the US.  Now all of us can see the concert in all its glory in this very professional looking and sounding concert.
The energy of the band and crowd are really incredible.  The ballroom looks terrific, the stage looks amazing with the giant television theme, and the guys are really giving it their all.  You can tell it's their first concert in awhile since Jonathan Davis loses his voice towards the end of the show.  It's a testimony to how much effort these guys put in for the fans.
There's a brief episode on the second disk showing ""the making of KoRn Live"" which will show you a totally new side of the band.  Wow!  There was some real friction between the bandmates and the director of the production!  You'll see the heated exchanges as the production crew and the band try to bring everything together before the curtain drops.  The guys of KoRn always show themselves as fun-loving and cool, but you will see that mask drop as they get pretty nasty with some of the crew!",1052179200,16,1778,4.447530864197531
1802369,4,B000077VQ4,"To the guy who said he wouldnt buy it because it was just like everything else they did, and had all there radio songs: I say thats not totally true, They play a few songs off their new album, do a metallica diddly (which i never heard them do live). There is lots of songs on here, whether you liek their mainstream stuff, or their more obscure stuff, there is something for everyone on here, plenty of live performance, and as close as you can get without actually being there. I didn't give it 5 stars because their newest album is really amazing, and heavy. It would have been nice to see more material from it.",1051833600,,615,4.310344827586207
1802370,3,B000077VQ4,"The problem with this DVD is that if you have seen any other Korn concert videos/specials, you've seen this one. All of the typical hits are here, nothing we haven't seen before. Although the band is in top form and everything sounds nice, it just gets boring and tiring because we've all seen this before (Like we haven't seen 'Got The Life' or 'Blind' performed three-dozen times already). This is pretty much an extended version of the special that aired on MTV over the summer. The concert itself was broadcast over the nation in certain theaters on June 10th, 2002 to celebrate the impending release of 'Untouchables.' It's worth a viewing, but as a Korn fan, I found that one time was more than enough. Just buy a ticket or settle for the much better, more interesting, and much more satisfying Family Values 98 video.",1050451200,3,824,4.689655172413793

1802372,4,B000077VQ4,"I like to think that i am one of Korn's most divoted fans. Yet on this dvd they probably took Korn's worst live show ever, and worst of all they released it to the public. Jon's voice and Jon physically were not ready for this show. You could tell blantantly on ""Thoughtless"" and on ""Make Me Bad""; however whose ever idea in the band to do ""One"" was brillant, the way they meshed Make Me Bad, One, and Justin together was just breathtaking almost. I would've liked to see more bonus material, but I guess Deuce has enough of that to go around.",1044921600,,543,4.281553398058253
1802373,5,B000077VQ4,"KORN LIVE AT THE HAMMERSTEIN BALLROOM is another great DVD. The set list is not bad. There is one special feature I thought was intresting was the alternate angle of the concert, the alternate angle feature is just was on the screen behind KoRn. There should of been a multi angle feature on this disc. Overall this is a good concert DVD.",1042761600,,338,4.467741935483871
1802374,2,B000077VQ4,"I think this DVD is not great because the sound [isn't very good]. The voice of Jonathan Davis [isn't very good] and not mixed great.
The 5.1 sound is a joke and don't work propedly because the sound mixer of Korn is a newbie i think
But The song on this Dvd is so sweet, we can listen new tracks like here to stay and old track like falling away from me
But the worst thing on this DvD is the voice of j. Davis, this guy cant sing good on all songs.
The worst song on the Dvd is Thoughtless. All the musician [isn't very good] onb this track and the songs look like an imitation of the real by a no talented band.
But if you really like the band and don't know anything in music buy this DVD.",1042243200,,693,3.921985815602837

Its such a good inidication of what the band is like live, and they are so sweet.  The crowd gets so into the music, and they have just enough crowd shots to show that, but still not take away from the band.  Also the second disc shows the video they show at the concert, which is awesome, not so cool for an hour and a half, but still cool.  The set list is good too, except it didn't have Good God or Clown, which kinda sux, but otherwise, get this DVD",1041638400,2,566,4.017857142857143

1802378,3,B000077VQ4,"Overall this is a good dvd but NOT great. The Production is the worst ive seen in a while. MTV usually gives it 3 seconds before changing the camera angle which is annoying but these guys are taking it over the top! Every one second the camera angle changes to where you cant focus on anything. VERY dissapointed with that part. You can barley hear Monkey playing at all...I was also dissapointed that the ""Making Of"" untouchables wasn't on there that you can see at korn.com. It had great studio footage and how they write the songs, picking the producer etc... Overall this dvd is fair and only buy it if your a hardcore korn fan I guess. Dissapointed with the MTV production.",1037923200,,678,4.520325203252033

It also incudes a documentary on how they made it. If you like Korn this is a must buy and you probably have it already. The only bad thing about this is that during the concert there are a lot of weird effects and things that just flash on the screen, its not a big problem but it can definately take away from the experience.

7974306,2,B000077VQ4,"Korn is one of the best live bands I've ever seen.  I should know.  I've seen them FIVE different times in concert.  In 2002, on the eve of the release of ""Untouchables"", they played a sold out show at the Hammerstein ballroom in NYC.  What followed was a band that obviously hadn't played a live show in some time.

Jonathan is overweight, out of shape, and seems (at that time) to be losing his hair.  He has to hold onto his microphone stand half of the time.  He has gotten into shape (and looks much better now), but in June of 2002 he looked as if he had one too many cheeseburgers.

The rest of the band plays pretty subdued compared to other performances I've seen.  They have obvious difficulty on (then) new songs such as ""Blame"", ""Embrace"", and ""Thoughtless"".  Jonathan's vocals, especially when he has to sing high notes, really suffer.  I'm not trying to slam them or anything, but you can tell they needed to get some more touring under their belts to get the rust off.  The opening ""Here to Stay"" is the highlight, with everyone hitting on all cylinders on that one.

The back of the case lists Metallica's ""One"" as er, one of the tracks (no pun intended).  However, while they do perform the song, they only play about one minute of it (the fast ""darkness, imprisoning me, all that I see...."" part) as part of a melody with ""Shoots and Ladders"" and ""Justin"".

There is a 2nd disc, with a 10 minute or so feature on creating the lights/effects for the show.  Apparently they almost didn't pull it off, and if you watch the show, there is one major production screwup:  The curtain falls to reveal the band about 3 seconds too early.

There is also the option of watching the background videos that play behind the band during the concert as a standalone.  It's a nice touch, but gets old real fast, unless you're planning on recreating the concert in your basement or something.

Overall, I applaud the effort and am glad it was released, but it just doesn't hold up to other performances.  The ""Live on the Other Side"" DVD from 2006 (from the same venue) is miles better.",1159488000,,2087,4.482758620689655
7974307,5,B000077VQ4,This DVD rocks! The set list is great! You get sweet songs like Trash and Faget as well as some rarities like Embrace and Blame.  KoRn is on fire during this show.  If you like KoRn get this DVD now and rock out!,1154217600,,212,3.9069767441860463
