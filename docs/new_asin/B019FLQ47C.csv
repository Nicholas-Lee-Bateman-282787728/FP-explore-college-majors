8745069,5,B019FLQ47C,"This is a really nice set for a complete triumph in the Mission Impossible movie franchise! I love this and Paramount has done an outstanding job all around on this set.  Part V, Cruise and his ""team"" take on more than seemingly ""possible"" in this sequel. They race against time to stop the ""Syndicate"", a deadly network of rogue operatives turned traitors. To stop this global threat, Ethan must join forces with an elusive, disavowed agent, (Rebecca Ferguson) whose loyalty is suspect from the ""get go"". I loved part IV especially, but this one is also sensational.
This edition features an all exclusive ""Bonus Blu-ray"" disc and a lovely 48-page Behind-The-Scenes Book with colorful pictures throughout. It fits neatly in the Blu-ray sleeve with the Blu-ray movie.
DVD of the movie is also included for a 3 Disc, Booklet Edition.
