It is truly the best I have ever seen, and moved me to tears several times.
The last minute, about Eisenhower, was truly touching.  You must see this.",1404691200,3,228,4.181818181818182
6363647,5,B00JJRLG8U,This is the best show I have seen on the d-day.  It doesn't end with the actual day but proceeds in what everyone went thru afterwards.  It was so well done and really captivated me.  I am buying it to give to my dad for Father's day.,1402012800,4,234,3.9361702127659575
6363648,5,B00JJRLG8U,"Both of my Grandfathers served in World War II.  This film brings to life the events that lead up to ""The Longest Day"" and how it unfolded.  The battlefield secrets that were once hidden from us, held underwater for so long, are now revealed in incredible detail using today's modern technology.
""D Day's Sunken Secrets"" is an indispensable documentary and should be shown in every US History classroom and to every future generation to educate, inspire and honor those bravest of soldiers who fought and often perished in this Great World War.",1401580800,7,544,4.9021739130434785

6363661,4,B00JJRLG8U,"I was expecting a documentary about what had sunk during the D-Day invasion. Only one fourth to one third of the video deals with what is under water. The rest is general information about D-Day, even including the gliders and parachutists. The video is interesting, it just doesnt deal exclusively with what sank.

The back of the DVD case states that the video is 60 minutes long, but it is actually 112 minutes (Amazon says 120).",1429315200,,432,4.684210526315789
6363662,4,B00JJRLG8U,"I would have given it five stars if more had been dedicated to what was beneath the sea.  I realize that you are talking about hallowed

8651514,5,B00JJRLG8U,"This was extremely moving for me. My uncle was on LST-523 when it hit the mine near Normandy beach. His body was never recovered, so when the DVD showed the sunken ship I knew it was highly likely he was still onboard. I thought this documentary was well done and handled difficult situations with tremendous respect.",1438214400,2,317,4.678571428571429
