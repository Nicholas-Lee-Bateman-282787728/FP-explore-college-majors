5471689,5,B00AQN7R8E,"Havin seen Wallander under the faces of Krister Henriksson, then Kenneth Branagh,
before seeing him through Rolf Lassgard, I can understand why H. Mankell would
have said Lassgard revealed more to him about Wallander: simply because he has
so much of the looks and demeanor Wallander has in the stories - that is he doesn't
look like he's always sorry for himself (like Branagh), nor does he appear, at times,
a bit aloof (like Henriksson), he just looks like a regular bloke, sometimes a bit besides
his own self, most of the time dealing with reality and trying to make it work for his
entourage and himself. He's somewhat like a mirror of our own society.",1371340800,19,658,4.681034482758621

5471691,3,B00AQN7R8E,"Very dreary, even for Wallender.  Much prefer the relieving warmth other actors have brought to the role.  Rare, honest and disturbing moments of our protagonist's flaws.",1366156800,,170,5.5
5471692,5,B00AQN7R8E,Has all the quality of the Wallander stories with a delightful and thoroughly appropriate Lead man.  The best of the Wallander series and I have now seen them all.,1363478400,4,163,4.620689655172414
5471693,5,B00AQN7R8E,"Lassgard's interpretation of Mankell's famed Swedish detective, the tormented Kurt Wallander, is one of the two great ones, along with Krister Henricksson's.

If you like provocative storytelling, superb acting, mind-bogglingly beautiful scenery, unexpected plot twists, don't miss this Swedish series.

I have all the Wallanders (including the latest incarnation which, to me, doesn't compare to either of the Swedish versions) and can tell you that, although it has English subtitles, you don't really need them. You know what Lassgard's Wallander is thinking because you can read his expressive face.

Lassgard is an experience not to be missed, especially in this role.",1360972800,15,673,5.643564356435643
5471694,3,B00AQN7R8E,"This rendition of the Wallander is very well done production and direction-wise, but credibility is soon destroyed since they try to portray him as a sexually attractive man
with romantic scenes and obvious intercourse. it's ludicrous.  The actor, Rolf Lassgard, is a gigantic 300 pound lumbering tank of a man and when  hey pair
him with a slim, attractive, much younger women it totally detracts from the stories and makes the whole viewing unauthentic. The two other series with portrayals one with Kenneth Branagh is far, far better, tho he plays him too morose.  By far the very best interpretation is the series starring Krister Henrikkson. I've watched 13 of these twice and find them far superior to either of the other two.",1359676800,26,732,4.934959349593496
5471705,4,B00AQN7R8E,"just love Wallander character  and have read every book that  Henning  Mankell wrote on him, so interesting.
 and gripping stories.",1393804800,3,131,5.4
5471706,5,B00AQN7R8E,"Absolutely loved Rolf Lassgard as Wallander!  He displays all of Mankell's fictional Wallander with aplomb;  the
drinking, loneliness and moodiness combined with brilliance.  A tour de force;  wish there were more episodes
with this fantastic actor!",1393718400,2,249,5.833333333333333
5471707,5,B00AQN7R8E,"He is the best Wallander, that's why.  He is tired but not boring.  His portrayal is spot on.
He has a way of conveying his feelings that do not appear anything but real.  Great character
study.",1389052800,2,194,4.333333333333333
5471708,5,B00AQN7R8E,"Great stories, well cast.  Rolf Lassgard certainly put his mark on this character.  His characterization was the model for the later British version of this series.",1387065600,,164,5.269230769230769
5471709,4,B00AQN7R8E,"This DVD set contains 4 discs: ""The Man Who Smiled,"" ""Firewall 1,"" ""Firewall 2,"" and ""The Pyramid."" Rolf Lassgrd does a great job as Wallander.  I like the Swedish series much better than the British version; however, the other Swedish series staring Krister Henriksson in the title role is my favorite. These are a little confusing in terms of the plots, but overall are fun to watch.",1381536000,10,385,4.746268656716418
5471710,4,B00AQN7R8E,"I have seen both the British Wallander and the other Swedish one and though I enjoyed them all, this is my least favorite. One problem is a serious lack of chemistry between Wallander and  the woman in his life. The other problem is over acting- hard to believe and not the way Mankell described him.",1378944000,,300,4.454545454545454
5471711,4,B00AQN7R8E,". . . so I'm always fond of his performances.  I admit that Kenneth Branagh's Wallander captures the character even better, is truer to the original text, and thus has now become my Wallander of choice.  However, don't want to lose touch with Lassgard.",1378166400,2,252,4.704545454545454
5471712,5,B00AQN7R8E,"After having seen the Swedish TV version (and the Brannagh English language version), it was interesting to see a Wallander closer to the novels - a bit more unkempt, a bit more woeful, and with stories based more directly on the books. It was very very enjoyable to watch. More Nordic Noir, please!",1377820800,2,299,4.660377358490566
5471713,5,B00AQN7R8E,"The dvd arrived in the promised time frame. No problems with the product. First time I've seen Rolf Larssgard in the lead role. Personally, I like Krister Henriksson in the role but I eventually warmed up to Rolf. I enjoy the series because it's rare one sees any beautiful, handsome, Hollywood types (Rizzoli and Isles) in the stories... the actors look like real people. If subtitles put you off choose the English option, but it doesn't take long to get used to the subtitles. I find I prefer the show in Swedish. I'm no expert on foreign films, but I know what I like... and I like the Swedish versions of Wallander.",1376352000,2,620,4.544642857142857
5471714,4,B00AQN7R8E,"Excellent, must see for fans of this detective series.  Ranks a bit above the British and slightly lower than the more recent Swedish version.",1372636800,,142,4.916666666666667

Turned me off the entire series because somewhere someone will try to duplicate the horrific abuse to swans.",1413849600,2,136,4.666666666666667
8556573,4,B00AQN7R8E,"I like this chap as Wallander, but the production values are not up to those of the series with Krister Henrikksen. Also, Lassgard's portrayal is one of a much more sickly, lumbering Wallander. I suspect that's how the director and writers saw this. Don't let this be the first or only Wallander you see. Henrikksen and Kenneth Branagh are both a little easier to watch. Still, I'm glad to have added this to my collection.",1413676800,,423,4.653333333333333
