3718577,5,B001NGF7LW,"This movie is terrific.  It was my favorite of the 2009 Palm Springs Film Festival.  The director/lead actor and supporting cast are excellent -- it is hard to believe they are acting and not ""being.""  I recommend this highly -- you will become completely immersed in this snapshot of the characters' lives.",1232236800,6,307,4.865384615384615
8326933,5,B001NGF7LW,"It has been  a long time since I have seen a really good foreign movie.  Eldorado is Film Movement's production from Belgium and it is a story of two unlikely man making a bond together.  They do not know each other, they do not trust each other, but they are both restless, searching for things neither can define and by all means, they are outcasts.

Both men are trying ot make sense out of their lives.  Can they help each other?  Can they save each other?  Can each help the other find the way and peace where emotional pain can finally go away - if not only for a moment.  As they embark on the road to visit young man's parents, they encounter a number of unfortunate events that are hillarious and bizzare at the same time.  Of course, visit to the young man's parents is not a happy one and the end is as heartbreaking as it is explosive.",1408752000,,847,4.24375
8326934,5,B001NGF7LW,"Eldorado is a road movie filmed in the south of Belgium .The director, Bouli Lanners, also acts as one of the main characters in this tragi-comic story which unfolds at a leisurely pace, indeed much like the relaxed pace of the whole of Wallonia.
Lanners also acts in the recommended Rust and Bone by Jacques Audiard. Lanners' other directorial exploit The Giants is  worth watching, even though the reactions on this one are widely varied.
Typical of the French speakers of Belgium, in an interview Lanners confesses his deep love of Flanders and thanks some of his Flemish friends, ""without whom the film wouldn't have been possible"", but ""regrets not to speak their language"" meaning that if the Flemish friend doesn't learn to speak French there will be no friendship.",1405814400,,772,4.938461538461539
8326935,4,B001NGF7LW,"Although set in Belgium, the movie has a strong French influence in its total composition. However, the unique aspect of the movie is its minimalist style, on the verge of becoming a melancholy short story. Throughout the show, we get glimpses of our utterly day to day humanity, in bits and pieces. It's hard not to feel emotion and not to identify with the vulnerability of an individual character. In contrast with Hollywood productions, European ones like this have a knack for reminding their audience that life is either a pure tragedy or an odd continuation of an eternal short story. I doubt there is any morality tale, except a surrendered soul's sigh, not too different from ""well, this is life."" I did feel sad at the end though. If you can tolerate the slow pace, you will be fine. Give it a go.",1386979200,,807,4.611111111111111
8326936,2,B001NGF7LW,"Character study of two down and outers who are brought together by one burgling the others house and the victim responding with pity and compassion. Story drags from one unfortunate situation to another.  The big problem with the movie, besides the pace, was I never cared about either character.  Neither character was sympathetic.",1345766400,,332,5.245283018867925
8326937,3,B001NGF7LW,"A young junkie, trying to quit breaks into the home of Yvan (Bouli Lanners). Through a series of circumstances Tvan agrees to give his new acquittance (Fabrice Adde) a lift home, rather than have him use that great European public transportation. They take off in his 1979 Chevrolet wagon toward the border (in Belgium, really how far can anything be from the border). The road trip has several stops along the way to peak your interest.

The story tells us that none of us are perfect. There is good and bad in all of us and that when we are a person in need, we can overlook a lot. You need to nurture your relationships with family. Mildly humorous. The road trip sound track is a steel guitar you might expect from some grindhouse. I was bored with most of the film and tiresome dialouge. The car is the metaphor.

F-bomb, no sex, full frontal male nudity.",1336348800,2,860,4.471337579617835
8326938,5,B001NGF7LW,"There are some stories that start in an unfamiliar place, follow a completely unpredictable path, and land somewhere...else. Bouli Lanners' strange and wonderful road movie, ELDORADO, is such a tale.

Here's the story. A used car salesman drives a drug-addicted young man home...along two-lane highways in rural Belgium. But home is not as it should be. So he drives the kid back to the big city.

But road movies are rarely about destinations. They are about what happens between travelers along the way. And a whole lot happens to these offbeat travelers on their journey.

There are the predictable road movie moments: the falling asleep at the wheel near-miss, the broken down in the middle of nowhere scene. But these are handled so imaginatively, so not-clich: a very naked man steps out of his RV to offer assistance, a local yokel has a fetish for accident scenes.

Both characters are haunted by lost relationships--and it is this point of connection that keeps them together, moving forward. Until there is nowhere left to go. And this relationship is lost, too.

ELDORADO is funny, heartbreaking, strange, and incredibly entertaining from first to last frame...a must-have addition to any home film library.",1303689600,2,1218,5.100502512562814
8326939,4,B001NGF7LW,"For no apparent reason, an antique car dealer decides to drive a petty thief and (apparently) recovering addict to his parent's home and then to a city.  The dealer is rather quiet, but there is pent up sadness in him, like he is trying to help the thief for some personal reason.  The thief is talkative, dumb, and damaged, realistically funny yet pathetic. Their dialogue is a classic of dysfunction, convoluted about things that don't matter - like whether to smoke inside even though there are no cigarettes -  but that still get to an important place on occasion.  They go through a series of comic meetings with very strange people, all of them fantastic yet completely believable, in the best tradition of cinema magic.  Even the most banal incidents are perfectly sculpted with truly fine acting.

Of course, along the road more and more is revealed of the situation of each life.  It is very moving and sad, doesn't really point to recovery or any durable friendship for either of them, and ends on a depressing note that reminds the dealer of the state of his life.

Warmly recommended.",1299110400,,1096,4.731578947368421
8326940,5,B001NGF7LW,"Beautifully shot (with scenes like this - [...]), this small movie about two loners embarking on a bizarre journey across the Belgium countryside is both spectacular and crazy.
Yvan is a quick-tempered 40-year-old vintage car dealer while Elie is a young burglar and ex-junkie. Both are trying to piece their lives together. This funny and warm film is a great delight to watch.",1294790400,,378,5.015873015873016
8326941,4,B001NGF7LW,"A man drives home and discovers that his house is broken into by a scared drug addict looking for money to use for a busride back to his parents' home in the country.  After seeing that the intruder is unarmed and scared, he lets him relax and volunteers to drive him back to his parents' home the next day.  Why?  Because the older man connects with the younger intruder.  What keeps viewers watching is why.

Both men have secrets they are hiding.  Both reveal them during the course of the movie.

The plot of this movie takes place ""along the road,"" where they meet every imaginable flawed character:  a car collector, a nudist, bikers and drug pushers.  Is anyone normal?  The older man's hair is never combed and he's wearing an oil-stained mechanic's overalls.  The younger man never takes off his old cap.

Most of the conversation between the men takes place in the older man's (Yvan, played by Bouli Lanners who also directs this movie) car or at rest stops along the way.  The dialogue is laconic.  One senses that neither trusts the other. Elie, the younger man (played by Fabrice Adde), never gains the trust nor shows any comfort around Yvan.  Yvan wants to, yet resists, to be the younger man's older brother.  Characters develop as various scenes unfold and we see their reactions and learn of their intentions.  In the end we are comforted that the end has come but it's an end without resolution.

Scenes of open fields, billowing clouds, wet country roads all add to the melancholy of this movie.  The sountrack is in English and the car is a 1979 Chevloret station wagon.  Eerieness and absurd suspense fill in the voids.  At best this is a convincing man flick of two confused men looking for acceptance in a strange universe.

4+ stars.",1260835200,4,1758,4.6396103896103895
8326942,5,B001NGF7LW,"ELDORADO is a road movie with a difference; the humor's subtle here, the heart's subterranean, the little lessons from life usually learned in this kind of mismatched buddy flick muted, at best.  But writer/director/star Bouli Lanners knows what he's about, and his film gets under your skin and stays there for days.  Haunting images, excellent acting, memorable soundtrack.  ELDORADO richly deserved the honor it took at Cannes, and is highly recommended to all adventurous fans of foreign films.",1236729600,5,498,5.358974358974359
