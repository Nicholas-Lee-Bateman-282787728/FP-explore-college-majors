The movie belongs to Bobby Deol who has given an excellent performance.  This is by far one of his best roles to date.  You will be crying, a lot!  If you would like to watch a movie with substance, then this is a good pick.",1456012800,,350,4.028985507246377
8381349,2,B002UNZO1A,"Vaada Raha' is all about Hope and Believe. Bobby stars as Duke, who's life today can be called gratifying. Everything works on his advantage. But in a unfortunate accident, he loses everything, be it physically & mentally. He becomes a negative pile, until, a kid enters his life and returns him what he had lost - HOPE.
Vaada Raha' has it's share moments, and a power-packed performance by Bobby, but overall, this comes out as a half-baked venture. The film begins well, but becomes a bore in the most vital moments, it's culmination. It's far from being touchy, it in fact is depressing.
What stands tall in 'Vaada Raha' is undoubtedly, Bobby's power-packed performance. On the whole, watch this one for Bobby's work, as that's the only substantial plus in this film!",1301011200,,770,4.840909090909091
