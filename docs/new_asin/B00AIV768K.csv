8552311,4,B00AIV768K,"Pretty good overall.  I know how difficult it is for 1 person, let alone 2 people to make hunting videos without getting busted / winded by the game, especially deer.  Sometimes in rut, the bucks are really stupid, tho.  I challenge anyone to go up against a herd of mature does and see how they do, lol.  My only complaint with this video has to do with my personal opinion, and that is some of the deer that were shot on these videos were not trophies (again, in my opinion) or anything spectacular.  There were several deer that looked to me to be well under the 130 P & Y score.  Again, I suppose it comes down to a person's definition of trophy or their personal experience and level of enjoyment.  Definitely worth watching, probably a couple times, for $10.  Buy it.",1389657600,,773,4.394366197183099
