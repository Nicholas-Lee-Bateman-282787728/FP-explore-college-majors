7888945,2,6305247951,"Let me start with the down side of this disc.  First it is listed as 60  minutes, alas the only way you'll get 60 minutes of viewing out this is to  either watch it twice or spend 30 minutes looking for the other 30  minutes.
On the plus side the color was great, and the sound as good as  could be expected for 40 to 50 year old material. There was even some  footage of Eisenhower viewing his steamer when it came stateside.
What  there was of this DVD was OK, but only if you are one who finds most  anything on a flanged wheel fascinating.
The bonus material pages are  only 1 page of text for each option, and the trivia game has debatable  answers.
I expected much more and am sure glad I rented before  purchasing.",965865600,9,721,4.1521739130434785
