8343455,3,B001UE7C10,"Overall the short culture clip is ok for people who would like to know Chinese cuisine for a general idea. If for classroom use, letting students understand the details of various Chinese cuisine, the video looks not very informative and attractive. The video does provide a few languages for narrative, but for Chinese narrative, I feel like it is a little advanced for foreigners who learn Chinese as a second language.",1274140800,,421,4.943661971830986
