8285151,5,B001BXRRY2,"I enjoyed this Biography.  There is SO MUCH out there about this film star twisted this way and that, that makes the assemblence of the documented materials used a very welcome change!  The use of film clips and newsreel images is very well done.  As always the late Peter Graves lends an air of authenticity without being so fact laden to become boring.

Definitely worth owning.",1362355200,,380,4.712121212121212
