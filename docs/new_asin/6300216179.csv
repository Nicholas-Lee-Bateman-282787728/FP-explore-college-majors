256914,5,6300216179,"If you've never seen this movie, you must see it to truly experience great comedy...one thing after another and you just can't believe that this could happen to 2 people all in 24 hrs.  But I lived in NY and it can!  It's so  terrific, you will not regret spending your time with this fantastic movie.  Lemmon and Dennis - so great - a true classic!",944697600,4,349,4.242424242424242
256915,5,6300216179,"What appears to be the plot for a lengthy kids cartoon comes to live action with all the desired results and then some. Lemmon and Dennis, both of whom are Oscar-winners, are genuinely perfect in the leads of the  All-American family trying to make it in a big city, with one disastrous  mishap topping another, from missing trains to losing luggage to broken  teeth and even to broken high heels. It's a wonder Lemmon's character kept  from spewing off an endless barrage of foul dirty cussing, something  typical of the trashy comedy we see in the movies today. Dennis's portrayal  of the ever-so supportive wife is outstanding, as she just takes what comes  despite her own misery just to keep her husband happy. Nearly everything  one can imagine to make a business trip turn to a total nightmarish  cataclysim happens here, and shows just what can happen in the Big Apple,  but with a hilarious rather than serious approach to it. ""Never give  up"" seems to be Neil Simon's message here when trying to make it in  the business world. Nevertheless this film is brilliantly produced,  directed, superbly scripted, and giftedly edited. The two leads are  irreplaceable, and stands alone as one of the best comedies of life as we  know it.",935193600,52,1239,4.778301886792453
256916,5,6300216179,"This has to be one of my all time favorite films. I cannot see Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn topping this. Jack Lemmon is masterfully funny with his whistling teeth, broken on a crackerjack. This man is a genius and  should be recognised so. I hope it comes out on DVD soon.",933292800,,273,4.25

This movie captures your every moment and leaves you laughing so hard that i would not view it in public. Just the mention of this movie brings a smile to my face that brightens my day.

256979,5,6300216179,"This is a very, very good movie.  I'm not sure it's really a comedy, however.  It has the structure of a classic suspense/horror film.  The audience anticipates each disaster and wants to warn the characters not to do what ever they are about to do.  The apprehension leaves the viewer in fear that this may not really be funny and at any time could become a tragedy",1500163200,,366,4.417910447761194
256980,5,6300216179,"This is an excellent movie and Jack Lemmon never disappoints..This movie is hilarious. Whatever can go wrong, does. Sandy Denis who plays his wife shows great comedic talent here as well.. Both of them were cast perfectly for these roles. This comedy is going to keep you laughing because it seems no matter where they are, what they do, nothing goes right. They leave the comfort of their home to go on a trip to New York for a job interview for Lemmon and the money and fringe benefits he is offered are something that most people just wouldn't turn down.. Does he or doesn't he. That's something I'll leave up to the audience to watch. The movie is fun, active, hilarious. I think one of the best comedies I've ever seen with Lemmon and Sandy Denis. They mention Anne Meara plays such a small role in the movie that you could easily miss her performance if you don't watch every moment of it. The way they added her as cast seemed as if she had a much bigger role in the movie, which is not the case as a heads up. Great movie and the 5 stars are well deserved.",1498694400,,1064,4.298507462686567

And it gets less funny as it goes on, Jack Lemmon is always yelling and threatening to sue someone, and Sandy Dennis...what the heck is that accent? Certainly not any kind of Ohio I can recognize (and Dennis was from Indiana so I'd think she had an idea.) Anyhow, after a half hour of this I needed a drink.

257313,5,6300216179,"I have to be careful not to like this movie *too* much.  After all, I'm a country guy who isn't acclimated to the city life at all.  Perhaps some of the stuff we see in this movie would be relatable to ME if I was placed in Jack Lemmon's shoes, lol.  Basically it's about Jack Lemmon and his wife (Sandy Dennis) who have to make a trip to the city for an important job interview.  When they leave their suburban home, NOTHING goes right!  From the moment they leave and enter the city, nothing but one nightmare scenario after another occurs.  You basically feel sorry for poor ol' Jack and especially for his wife who Jack basically drags around and treats like a dog or a little kid.  No love at all there.  Just aggression and uptightness.

Basically what makes the Out-of-Towners so memorable is Jack Lemmon's character.  He's constantly obnoxious and demanding towards his wife, easily agitated and VERY talkative.  His character might get under your skin if you're not prepared for it.  He's about as much of a jerk as one can be, but I can sympathize and understand how he feels.  I imagine myself in his shoes and well, to be perfectly honest, I can see myself acting the same way!  The city life just brings out the worst in people sometimes.  Not that I'm criticizing city folks- just the nature of a fast-paced hustle and bustle environment can easily make a situation very tense.  I wouldn't be able to handle it without pulling my hair out.

Anyway some of the best scenes in the Out-of-Towners is probably when Jack and his wife arrive to the hotel after what they thought were secure room reservations only to find that they've been given away due to a time mix-up.  I KNEW something was going to go wrong while this scene unfolded but I wasn't sure what!  Also earlier when Jack wants his wife out of the bathroom as quickly as possible to catch a train and asks another woman (a cleaning lady I think) to walk in and grab her.  The lady comes out with the wrong woman, lol.  Of course when Jack and his wife are standing in the rain admiring trash- well, the rain just caps off the kind of day they're having doesn't it!

Also funny, perhaps unintentionally so since I find it hard to believe, is when the taxi driver doesn't have change so he accepts the 20 dollar bill.  Jack wants him to mail the change and even provides the address, and the taxi driver is somehow miraculously able to not only remember but recite the address perfectly as Jack is walking away!  If I was the taxi driver, well, you'd have to repeat it 20 times for me to be able to remember it, lol.  Also Jack often gets so upset that he threatens to sue anyone who rubs him the wrong way.  There's all kinds of memorable scenes.

Overall really hilarious with memorable characters, really believable and top-notch acting, and a solidly written movie overall.",1430179200,,2848,4.490272373540856

yes, it's a light comedy written esp. for ""New Yorkers"" by a ""New Yorker, par excellante"" and so the credulity of so much of it can be overlooked. yes, when it connects, it connects.

this New Jersey-New Yorker knows about and remembers garbage strikes and transportation shutdowns, etc. and remembers ""New York, 1970"" and appreciates all the location shooting.

Executive Lemmon flies (or tries to fly) to New York for a night out on the town of towns and instead winds up pondering the necessity of mugging a kid sitting alone on a Central Park park-bench. in this chaos and confusion, all ""Executive"" thinking flies out the plane, train, bus window and he...makes some bad choices. Lemmon turns in an Oscar worthy performance.

257467,1,6300216179,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I have been visiting NYC since the early 70's, so I was most interested to see if any fond memories highlighted this collaboration. As a huge fan of Lemon, I knew this film would be first rate. Oy Vey! What a challenge to watch even 5 minutes between commercials for another film.

First, you have a high level executive interview which translates, at least to most I assume, this guy has it going on. They used Travel Agencies back then, hence this big time NYC company would use only the best. Of course they would be aware of the perils of taking a late flight the night BEFORE an early appointment which might POSSIBLY lead to difficulties. Hence, right off the bat I am being conned into the ramifications of implausible events.

Comedy typically comes from unexpected actions and consequences and when you see them coming at every turn it gets EXTREMELY boring! Whoever read this script and kept laughing every five minutes to give the green light owed Mr. Simon a HUGE debt or knew where the bodies were buried.

I believe Lemon accepted the role without reading the script and this explains his involvement in such a deleterious role. Dennis was bad enough in WAOVW, so was prepared for yet another annoying performance.

Perhaps if you had him coming to town to visit a dying relative and develop the comic action in the ICU this would have more credibility. I advise anyone considering this worse than drivel of a film to complete avoidance.

I can only recommend for those who want to see reminders of the old NYC and how it was regarded as a languid, sorrowful, corrupt city and how mightily it reincarnated and rose from the ashes to become the shining star of destination locations in the world.

Simon, this was your town and no one wanted to live there anyways then, so why the F U??? Please explain if we ever meet.",1420243200,,1874,4.592814371257485

Admittedly, it's a nerve wracking film that won't be for everyone, but I remember it in the theater at the time and really enjoyed it. I especially enjoy the final scene in the hotel when Lemmon comes back from the meeting.

One thing to note that is apparently only going to be known by those who saw it in theaters:

SPOILER ALERT PLEASE DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM......

At the end of the film as it exists now, the last line is Sandy Dennis saying ""Oh My God...."" and it's over.

When the film was in theaters, hijackings...or ""skyjackings"" as they became known....were rampant. The actual final line in the theatrical version was 'Oh my god, we're being hijacked!.""

By the time this film was first shown on network television, hijackings had become a real problem, and the TV networks decided they didn't want her to say that. So they cut out the phrase ""we're being hijacked.""

To this day, apparently the only version that still exists is this edited version that simply says ""OMG"" at the end.

I've seen this movie countless times since its debut and never tire of its tragicomic hilarity.  As George Kellerman, Jack Lemmon's faith and trust in humanity are utterly destroyed over 24-hours trying to survive in New York.  Sandy Dennis' comments ""Oh, my God!"" and ""I can verify that!"" are priceless.  Highly recommended.",1419465600,2,435,5.338235294117647

are perfect married couple who travel to New York for Lemmon's big job and the big city beats them up and spits them out. Lemmon has never
been funnier especially with the one liners provided by the brilliant Neil Simon. I can only picture maybe Tony Randall in this role other than
Lemmon. If you like quick wit one liners with physical comedy at it's best then you can't miss this movie! Dennis plays the wife trying to keep up
with Lemmon and is hilarious herself especially when she's trying to comfort him or her whining and crying episodes. I saw this late night on TV
back in the day when they had late night TV movies and kids could catch these type of great movies FREE! This is a classic! Watch it with the Kids!",1411862400,,858,4.40251572327044

257809,3,6300216179,"I thought this was going to be funny. Parts of it were mildly amusing, but on the whole it was just annoying.

For example, the wife wanted to carry a smaller bag with essentials onto the plane, but the husband took it out of her hand and checked it anyway, and later he *blamed her* for not carrying it on. Throughout the whole movie, she was asking for a cup of coffee, and he wouldn't let her. After all of the catastrophes (and still no coffee) she said, ""George, can I please have a cup of coffee? It won't ruin my dinner."" (Apparently she had to ask permission, like a child.) And STILL he said no!

I agree with the others who said this movie was just whiny and obnoxious, but I think he was much more irritating than she was, even with her nasal voice.",1405123200,,760,4.198630136986301

The same dynamic that fuels most of Simon's plays is in force here:  a neurotic vs a placid person who swop personas.  Jack Lemmon reprises his Felix Unger character in different guise, an uber-anxious character.

257883,3,6300216179,"I love Jack Lemmon and enjoy most of his movies (go check out: How to Murder Your Wife, Good Neighbor Sam and the Odd Couple). I wanted to see a light comedy that would give me a smile at the end of a tough work day. Maybe I wasn't in the mood, but the comedy just didn't hit me. The basic plot is traveling and everything going wrong (the title doesn't really indicate that). While that can be funny, Lemmon's character was a bit too abrasive  . . .  especially how he treated his very meek wife. His treatment of her bordered on the abusive. That's not funny to me. It would have been much more pleasant if she would have been a little more assertive and the one to make all of the right moves, showing Lemmon's character to be the irrational goofball. Also, the movie didn't show enough of their love and commitment to each other until the very end (which was the only pleasant scene for me).
One other note: It was kind of fun to watch how airline travel was back then. No security. Smoking on the plane. Much more lax rules.",1397865600,,1029,4.244897959183674

It would run it for me :)  And Sandy Dennis--- I can't imagine anyone else bringing to the part a character so trusting, so understanding of her neurotic husband, so determined to keep a stiff upper lip even when he won't give an inch.  Such a dithering, stammering, smiling, nice person put in such a difficult, harried situation with a loving but uber controlling husband-- who else but Sandy Dennis could make you believe this is a REAL person you're watching and not someone acting this way?!  :)  I just love her!

258584,5,6300216179,"This is a throwback to the classic American screwball comedy, and as such, is a coherent sequence true to that art form. This style of film making was popular back in the 1930s-40s, characterized by fast-paced reparte, or wit and intellectual humor. Themes of this genre centered on farce, escapist and love and marriage situations, often depicting characters in positions of social conflict. Another element of this film is the use of the satire genre. Satire focuses on abuses, defects and imperfections. Although satire is disguised as humor, it is, in effect, social commentary, used for the purpose of criticizing society (and the individual) into bettering itself, often using wit, as a tool for the action.

Jack Lemmon's over-the-top artistic prowess and pure genius, coupled with Sandy Dennis' renowned proficiency in her supporting role, are the famed characteristics that make this film classic. Jack Lemmon was an amazing talent, including an accomplished pianist! His skilled timing, innate connection to the human condition and relation to being in the moment are what distinguished him from his accomplished veteran acting colleagues. Mr. Lemmon always ""stole the show,"" while simultaneously raising the bar for performances of his fellow actors, some of the best in Hollywood. One is truly missing the essence of this captivating film and Mr. Lemmon's incredible contributions to cinema, if this film does not hold your attention, in my opinion! There really is no actor capable of Jack Lemmon's believability and validity when he commits to his choices of actions. For me, this is what makes this film worth owning! You actually experience this artist living his part, not merely acting it when you are privileged to view his work.",1327622400,2,1748,5.242857142857143

to give to friends who are much younger than me who lived in NYC for a few
years. They fell over laughing, my friend saying, she wasn't sure she would
have moved to the city if she had seen this movie first. Lemmon and his
wife live in the midwest and they are flying to the city for a job interview
and one disaster after another occurs. Seems there is a garbge strike going
on in NY at that time with garbage all over everywhere (can you imagine the
most exciting city in the world covered in garbage!); their hotel room had not
been held for them and there were not rooms to be found. At one time they
are in Central Park, the wife limping having broken a shoe and this is at
night of all times. The end of the movie is a real corker.  I wish we had
the talents we had back then to make really good movies and the actors
in them.  This is a 'don't miss"" movie.",1326844800,2,1092,3.9817351598173514
258586,5,6300216179,"Long a favorite, but clearly a divisive film.

I've witnessed reactions swing from laughter to frowning serious statements of ""please-change-the-channel"". So obviously this isn't for everyone.

Interestingly, this reminds me of another polarizing movie that I recently reviewed - '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridesmaids/dp/B005O71CVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridesmaids</a>'. And like that moronic ridiculously overhyped disaster, you tend to see a clear divide through the audience. Rarely do you get the 'Eh' shrug. No dithering or sitting on the fence - it's either love or hate. (hated Bridesmaids)

For myself - love this flick.

I completely understand the hate though, because this production, even though dated, speaks to the unending frustration you face in real life. There's no point where you feel like it's something long gone, a past we don't see any more like horse-driven carriages. In fact, given the downward slide of every known educational standard combined with an ever increasing arrogant general populace - sadly, this movie is as relevant today as when it was released.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Idiocracy/dp/B000K7VHOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Idiocracy</a>&nbsp;triumphant.

Tells the story of a midwest couple, George and Gwen Kellerman. They're making their first trip to the big city.

George has one final perfunctory interview before given the job of regional vice-president of his plastics company. This is everything he's worked for - and he can't wait. More money, more opportunity, the life he's always wanted; though Gwen is less than enthused. A small town girl, she's comfortable with what they've built in quiet Columbus, Ohio. Uprooting their lives and their children's lives is not the ideal choice. Still, she supports her husband's dream. So after a quick flight to New York, a planned fabulous dinner at the Four Seasons, the next day's quickie interview, they're off for a few days scouting NYC's schools and upper middle-class homes.

Seems pretty straight forward. But from the get-go everything starts to go haywire. Simple glitches that begin as minor irks and inconveniences, particularly given George's riotous and unyielding sense of 'the right way', quickly snowball into a spectacular disaster of epic proportions as every possible thing that can go wrong - does. Murphy's Law cubed.

What follows is twelve hours in Hell. A tortuous journey with multiple twisting pitchforks to the spirit. Can George and Gwen survive the big city - will they even live long enough to make it back home?

Again, this film quickly defines who you are as a person. Not so much that it would break apart a couple, but enough to reveal the type of personality you have, and the sheer amount of insanity and indignity you can or are willing to withstand. <g>

Movie Note: I saw an interview with Neil Simon where he described a vacation he and his first wife took to the Bahamas and their return trip to New York - which formed the basis for the screenplay. Completely hilarious, as several of the scenes in the film are directly replicated from his account. In particular: Avoiding the unappetizing airline meal in favor of a reservation made to a favorite restaurant, only to have their flight diverted to Boston and the mad rush for the late night trains with only leftover clam juice and green olives to eat.

But hey, this is like almost a real life situation! I mean, how many of us have been delayed at the airport, problems with our rental cars, lost/stolen credit cards, etc.

It is non-stop comedy all the way, and Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis play their characters to the hilt (I don't think any other famous two actors could have played these characters as humorously as Lemmon and Dennis did in 1970). I did see the remake from 1999 with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn as the title characters.

The running gag of taking names may wear on some viewers, but I had to laugh each time at Lemmon's neurotic ranting and bluffing.

The story, as such, concerns a couple who arrive in New York and have everything possible go wrong.  It could have been funny, but Jack Lemmon- who I usually like- misses totally.  Instead of being a sympathetic character, his constant bitching and whining about every misfortune becomes irritating, and eventually you don't care if anything happens to him.  You almost want someone to finish him off and end the movie.

Sandy Dennis, who I always considered to be an adequate- not great- actress, actually hits the marks better, and her character is much more likeable.

George Kellerman (Lemmon) desperate to impress when he gets an important job interview in New York, leaves comfortable Ohio with his wife Gwen (Dennis) in tow, for a weekend of luxury in the big city...  Pretty soon, everything goes pear-shaped, as the Kellermans find themselves in the middle of a New York transit strike, and later ""submit"" to a series of bizarre muggings, cancelled hotel reservations and shady characters.  In the midst of the comedic whirlwind are the full-blooded characters of George and Gwen, broke and stranded in the big city, who quickly endear themselves to the audience.

Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis are such a joy to watch in THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS, which has a zesty comedy screenplay by Neil Simon.  There's non-stop hilarity in store whenever Jack Lemmon is on the screen, and this movie is no exception.  Sandy Dennis is also wonderful here, with her zany deadpan performance as Gwen.

Jack Lemmon was a hugely talented actor, but his character here is unnecessarily  obnoxious and irritating beyond belief. His wife, portrayed by Sandy Dennis, is a high-maintenance nasal voiced annoyance. Although I'm not familiar with Dennis' full career body of work, at least in this film, she can't seem to act her way out of a paper bag.

The story is a series of ""anything that can go wrong, will go wrong"" occurrences that are both predictable and unbelievable. This film's schtick got old in the first ten minutes and died after the first half hour. Without a single laugh generated from the opening to the closing credits, The Out of Towners fails miserably as a comedy. With all the irritating ranting, raving, whining and complaining, it fails as any type of entertainment at all.

It's hard to believe that The Out of Towners was ever considered a good film (although supposedly, it was). If so, it's aged about as well as month old milk in a faltering fridge.

Modern comedies that seem to be spewed out on an assembly line (many of which are bad remakes, INCLUDING this movie which is nowhere NEAR as funny!) rely too much on unseemly gimmicks like nudity, foul language, special effects and horrifically distracting camera angle changes every two seconds in order to keep people watching, but The Out of Towners (rated G!) shows them all how it is done in a tasteful and howlingly funny manner! I recently told my friend about this movie as he had never seen it. I brought over my VHS copy a few days later and he laughed right along with me and now has a new movie to add to his list of favorites! This comedy is truly a hidden treasure of laughs. It's not a widely-known film, but everyone I've introduced it to has loved it!

Jack Lemmon has me laughing throughout this entire film! He was a master of comedic talents, from his facial expressions to his eccentric outbursts, and is very realistic as a harried, at-the-end-of-his-rope traveler, and is incredibly funny! I think most people can see a lot of themselves and others in George Kellerman. Sandy Dennis also does a great job as his patient, doting wife Gwen, however she too gets fed up at one point and lashes out in her own unique way.

This hilarious film has us laughing at almost all of life's mishaps, from the mildly annoying to the outrageously frustrating. Late-arriving planes, lost luggage, missed trains, getting caught in a rainstorm in downtown NY, broken heels, chipped teeth, and on and on and on. Every couple of minutes is another mishap! It never ends for these poor travelers and it's so exhaustingly funny that the ending is almost anti-climactic, although VERY fitting!

I give it 5 stars. It's engaging, well-acted, non-stop and FUNNY as hell. Oh, and did I mention it was a Neil Simon film?",1167264000,3,1844,4.6503067484662575
258807,4,6300216179,"Just before tackling the treacle of ""Love Story"", journeyman director Arthur Hiller did a pretty decent job maneuvering this kinetic 1970 Neil Simon-penned comedy. The movie follows the misadventures of the Kellermans, an Ohio couple who journey to New York City because husband George is up for a much anticipated VP promotion in his plastics company. Wife Gwen is supportive but reticent about coming to the big city, and it turns out her hesitations are well founded. First, their flight is rerouted to Boston, and then they are crowded onto a commuter train to Grand Central Station where they are in the midst of a transit strike. The Kellermans get kidnapped in a squad car and then mugged. The Waldorf-Astoria has given away their room, and they have to spend a night in Central Park where they get mugged for a second time. George chips his front tooth on a Cracker Jack while Gwen suffers from weak ankles. The clock continues to click until George's appointment with the company president.

In typically manic form, Jack Lemmon has to play a complete jerk as George, and he luckily does not go soft with his character as he faces one indignity after another. It's just that he starts to sound more like a Neil Simon character than a real human being after a while. The shamefully underused Sandy Dennis effectively plays Gwen with cautious subservience from the outset but gradually makes her character funnier by turning her into a whining neurotic. Both actors use their familiar mannerisms maximally here, but more importantly, they are completely credible as a suburban married couple who have to lean on each other throughout. Hiller smartly uses real locations and captures an urban grittiness that makes sense within this story. Quincy Jones provides the jazzy background music here. John Hughes' partial knock-off, the equally hilarious ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" (1987), bears a more than passing resemblance to this film.

He's an uptight upper management type from Ohio who falls victim to NYC's never ending supply of madness inducing fodder. From the moment he and his wife get on the plane to NY they are trapped in a never ending cycle of misfortune, bad luck and crime ridden streets. Jack Lemmon walks a fine line between nervous hostility and dramatic comedy. I am a native New Yorker and I myself have fallen victim to NYC's endless barrage of crowds, lines, apathetic cops, red tape, crime, pollution and all the other trappings of a big city. Lemmon adds a special touch that you rarely find in an actor. He doesn't come off as a blundering idiot like Steve Martins' rendition of this film and he brings you right into the scene as though it's happening to you. Paul Giamatti is about as close to Jack Lemmon as any of today's actors will get. He has that certain edge that makes him funny and intense all in one performance.

258834,3,6300216179,"Having successfully avoided the apparent train wreck of a remake of this starring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, I thought I'd rent the original Neil Simon film starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis to see what caused such a fuss as to remake it after such a short period of time.
Jack and Sandy are on their way to New York city from the suburbs, to see about Jack taking a big job there. Suffice it to say, everything that can go wrong does go wrong, and the two are trapped in hell, trying to survive the night before his interview in the morning.
This is considered to be classic dark comedy, that will be annoying to some and funny as heck to others. I think I fell in between the two. Jack Lemmon is such an ass, and his wife such a dunderhead, that it's hard to have much sympathy for either one. As their problems pile up, it's all too obvious that the cause is mainly his own agonizing egotism, being thrown as the small fish into the huge pond. New York chews up and spits out idiots like this daily, and rightly so. Beyond this criticism (coming from a city boy, admittedly), there are some genuinely funny moments here and chuckle worthy constant prattle back and forth between the always talented Lemmon and the creepy huge-gummed Dennis. Still, I felt the ""lost in NY hell"" story was much better and sympathetically told, as well as more funny in Martin Scorscese's superior ""After Hours"".",1077494400,2,1402,4.48046875
258835,5,6300216179,"THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS was written by Neil Simon and remains one of his best works, even though Simon is mainly a playwrite. The movie starts off fairly slow and uneventful as George and Gwen Kellerman, from Twin Oaks, Ohio, are flying to New York where George has an interview (just mere formality) for a vice presidency. They are expecting to eat dinner at 8:30pm at the Four Seasons, but they never see the inside of that famous eating establishment. Instead, the plane circles for hours and ends up going to Boston because of fog. Once in Boston their luggage is lost, they miss the train to New York, and catch the train to New York. Once in the Big Apple, they find that the city is in the middle of transit and garbage collectors strikes. In the pouring rain they walk to their hotel only to find that their room wasn't held and has been given away. Later the couple are mugged, kidnapped, and George is mugged in his sleep. Having not eaten for several hours and with no money they chase a stray dog for a breakfast of a half-eaten box of Cracker Jacks. More chases follow and they are even kicked out of praying in a church because of a televised special. George eventually does make his morning meeting, but by then has learned some very important lessons about family and the simple life back home in Twin Oaks, Ohio.
Jack Lemmon is great in this movie, but I find it's Sandy Dennis who really steals the film. She plays Gwen perfectly, brilliantly foiling Lemmon's performance as the loud and boistorous George. The ""O, my God"" line, which signals a major worry by Gwen, keeps me laughing every time I hear it.
THE-OUT-OF-TOWNERS is a very witty comedy and one of Neil Simon's finest pieces of writing. It's a great movie to watch alone or with family and friends. It's relatively short (around 90 minutes), too, so even if you don't enjoy it, you won't have wasted much time.",1074470400,31,1884,4.544117647058823
258836,5,6300216179,"I met Sandy Dennis backstage at a play once and wanting to say something more than the usual remarks of admiration I told her that my father stayed up one night to watch ""The Out-of-Towners,"" which was of some import because my father never stayed up to watch anything.  She said her father liked that one too and I got an autograph in which she spelled by first name correctly.
This 1970 film, the original version of ""The Out-of-Towners"" for those who say the recent version that is part of Steve Martin's attempt to be in more remakes than any other living actor, is my favorite Neil Simon script, which is rather ironic when you consider that he is primarily a comic playwright.  However this script takes the hapless couple of George (Jack Lemmon) and Gwen Kellerman (Dennis) from their home in Ohio to New York City, where he has a job interview.  However, their plans for a nice dinner at the Four Seasons are dashed when the plan circles the airport for hours before being diverted to Boston.  Instead of eating at one of the best restaurants in the world they end up with her eating peanut butter on white bread and him eating crackers and olives with no drinks.  This actually ends up being the best thing that happens to George and Gwen the rest of that night, which involves a train ride to New York, no room at the inn, a garbage strike, a mugger, and being kidnapped while in the back of a police car.  This is without even mentioning the lost eyelash, the broken heel, and the chipped tooth that resulted from a bad encounter with the prize in a box of Cracker Jacks.
Throughout it all, George and Gwen keep up a running dialogue as he gets angrier and take more names while she tries to be the voice of reason and attests that she can verify everything her husband says in his growing list of complaints against the city is true.  Everybody always talks about Lemmon's comic partnership with Walter Matthau, but Dennis comes across as the more perfect foil.  Eventually her pessimism is turned into paranoia as the city takes the out of town couple for everything they have and keeps on grinding them into the rain soaked streets where the garbage is piling up to the sky.  Eventually the idea of being Vice President in a company that has something to do with plastics does not seem like a step up in the world if this is the world in which they have to live.
I am surprised that this movie is only 98 minutes long, but I suppose it is because of all those commercials with late night television and the way Simon keeps pouring one misery after another on George and Gwen that makes ""The Out-of-Towners"" seem a lot longer, but not in a bad way.  The pacing is pretty brisk for a story about two people who have a hard time getting to where they are going, and there are a lot of patented Neil Simon one liners, most of which are true to character and context, although Dennis gets maximum mileage out of repeating the phrase ""Oh my, God!"" and getting big laughs.
Simon won the Writers Guild of America award for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen for this script, which was originally going to be one segment of ""Plaza Suite,"" which came out the next year.  But freeing it from the setting of a hotel room or even a hotel, into the wider expanse of New York City and the surrounding environs was what made this black comedy really work.  Keep your eye out for lots of familiar faces who were relatively unknowns when this film came out: Anne Meara, Graham Jarvis, Ron Carey, Robert Walden, Richard Libertini, Paul Dooley, and Billy Dee Williams.  Final thought: If you want to see a film that takes the exact opposite approach to New York City then that would have to be Woody Allen's ""Manhattan,"" which would come out at the end of this same decade.",1073606400,39,3776,4.462989840348331

In fact, no remake or sequel of any classic movie has ever been better than the original, so it's a huge waste of time quality-wise, done only to rake in a few extra bucks from ignorant young viewers whom the producers hope won't get wise to the scam too soon.
The Out-Of-Towners doesn't just illustrate how New York sucks (if you're not rich) but that all big cities suck for the average person. Sure it's done as a dark comedy, but beneath the humor the lesson is still there that cities should stay smaller and more workable; whenever they get too huge they always turn into an unwieldy maze of inefficiency and nightmarish confusion.
So if you live in a nice, comfy small town like the Ohio one Lemmon does in this movie, and your company someday decides to give you a corporate pat on the back, tell them thanks for the compliment but that you AIN'T going to any big city to collect it!",1070150400,3,1210,4.40625

First they lose their luggage, then their hotel reservations.  Everything is on strike (transit, garbage).
Throughout the movie, the frustrated Lemmon can only ask people who have wronged him for their names.  This he writes down in a little black book while informing the offender to expect a call from his lawyer.
Don't even think to get the remake of this film.  It is already the perfect comedy!

258889,5,6300216179,"I always loved, The Out Of Towners.  I saw it first as a movie of the week when I was in high school or there abouts and I saw it as just plain funny and interesting.  Gave me lots of insights into humans and their odd ways but thats all until I had my own first adventure on my own in a big city.
I recently had to visit New York City on my own for business after living a very sheltered life.  OyVey the things the Out Of Towners prepared me for.  That movie just means so much to me now that I have personally experienced the full weight of  feelings as the characters in the movie.  Of course I did not have the comedic bad luck at every turn they did thank you but, I sure had my moments.  I guess I am saying once you have traveled this movie is even funnier as life in a new world not your own is a strange experience.
The movie is a light hearted fast paced rollercoaster ride of events that occur to a happless but far from helpless midwest couple visiting New York City.  The city never turns a cold shoulder to them but never exactly warms up to them either.  With relative good cheer and true midwest grit the intrepid couple deal with thugs, exploding man hole covers, rude hotel staff and one misunderstanding after another in a way both real and funny.  The husband is just confused you know the way Lemmon plays it.  The wife is just whiney enough to be real but never nerve wracking.  There is lots of physical humor and running jokes throuhout the picture.  The picture is not high art and does not pretend to be.  This is a movie you watch just to laugh at the madcap humor that life sometimes can just spew out to hit the a first time traveler.
I loved it so much I brought it and do not regret my selection one bit.  Its every bit as funny today as it was when I first set eyes upon it in prehistrotic times of my youth.",1061078400,,1841,4.089136490250697

258892,4,6300216179,"Getting ahead in your career or moving on with your life doesn't necessarily mean moving ""up.""  That promotion or ""golden opportunity"" that comes along may not in reality turn out to be all that it would seem, initially, especially if it involves an unprecedented upheaval in your life, like a transfer to another city.  It's a situation that becomes grist for Neil Simon's humor mill in the comedy-of-errors ""The Out-of-Towners,"" directed by Arthur Hiller.  Jack Lemmon stars as George Kellerman, a Midwesterner who finally gets that ""big chance"" when his company offers him a job in New York City.  It sounds good, and just like that, George and his wife, Gwen (Sandy Dennis), are on a plane headed for the Big Apple to look into this opportunity of a lifetime.
 When their plane lands in New York, however, it's as if the wheels touching the runway triggers something in the cosmos alerting Murphy (whoever he is), who instantly puts his ""Law"" into effect.  And, as Dinah Washington once said in a song, ""Now it begins--""  In this case, one cliche after another, all falling into place like dominoes during a tournament in the park.  Missing luggage; a problem with their hotel accommodations-- as in, they have no reservation; being taken advantage of by a stranger, a native New Yorker looking for an easy mark; getting mugged; a broken tooth.  Think of anything that could possibly go wrong, and it's in here.  And you know what?  it's funny stuff.
 Under Hiller's steady, if not too imaginative direction, cliche-ridden as it may be, this comedy works, and the reason can be summed up in two words:  Jack Lemmon.  The whole concept of the story is tried and true, but tired; and this is definitely not one of Simon's best efforts (good as it is).  But Lemmon immerses himself in his character, takes the laughing ball and runs with it, and makes even the most weathered and worn situations seem fresh and new.  And, most importantly, he's going to make you laugh, which in the end is what this movie is all about in the first place.
 What makes Lemmon so successful is that chameleon-like quality of his that enables him to become whatever character it is that he's creating.  His creations may share that frustrated stammer and that tendency toward animated behavior that is so ""Lemmon,"" but beyond and beneath that, he has the ability to bring a definite sensibility to his characters that makes each of them unique.  Here, you believe that George is a lifelong Midwesterner, and it shows in his entire countenance:  His manner, attitude, body language and approach to everything he encounters in the Big City.  George, however, is not your typical wide-eyed, naive and overwhelmed country-bumpkin-come-to-the-city.  Instead, Lemmon creates a very real sense of an average guy facing a new experience in his life-- one that just happens to go completely awry.  And by developing a character grounded in reality, he makes the humor work; it gives the audience someone to whom they can relate.  It's something that Lemmon does so well, and he makes it look so easy while he's doing it.
 As Gwen, Sandy Dennis is pointedly droll, so low-keyed in the face of their predicaments, in fact, that it would not have been out of character had George checked for her pulse occasionally.  Her performance is fairly ""theatrical,"" more conducive to the stage than film, but in contrast to Lemmon's antics, it somehow becomes quite viable, and actually turns out to be one of the memorable aspects of the film.  When you think about George later, you're going to have to think about Gwen, too.  Gwen serves as something of a sounding board for George, a mirror in which his frustrations are reflected and enhanced.  Ultimately, her non-expressiveness itself becomes an expression of her character, and though Gwen comes across as more caricature than character, within the context of the material, it works.  And, as Lemmon's counterpoint, she plays it very well, and pulls it off without a hitch.
 In addition to Lemmon's presence, one of the things that makes this film so funny is the accessibility of the characters; it is so easy to project yourself into their situation, and sharing their misadventures through the magic of film makes it hilarious.  And you can empathize with George and Gwen, because down deep you realize that actually having to live through such an ordeal would be anything BUT funny.  It IS fun, however, to experience it from the comfort of your own living room.
 The supporting cast includes Sandy Baron (Lenny Moyers), Anne Meara (Woman In Police Station), Robert Nichols (Passenger), Ann Prentiss (Stewardess), Ron Carey (Cab Driver), Philip Bruns (Officer Meyers), Graham Jarvis (Murray), Carlos Montalban (Manuel), Billy Dee Williams (Clifford), Richard Libertini (Railway Porter) and Paul Dooley (Day Porter).  After seeing this movie, who would ever be able to forget George, finally at the end of his rope, standing in the middle of the street, refusing to give up and railing at the city itself, challenging it to take it's best shot at him.  And that's just one of the many moments that makes ""The Out-of-Towners"" such a delight, no matter how many times you watch it.  At times, the humor is a bit acerbic; but in the final analysis, this is a film that's going to connect with just about any audience.  It's the magic of the movies; but more than that, it's the magic of a terrific actor named Jack Lemmon.",1011571200,5,5440,4.866449511400652
258893,4,6300216179,"The lighter side of the depressed Lemmon which turned up in so many great films in the 60s and 70s.  The man was a bona fide acting genius.
But for my money Sandy Dennis steals the show.  She glows through the rain and delays, muggings, mountains of garbage and all the rest.  Somehow, through it all, with Lemmon quickly deteriorating and predicting doom around every corner, Dennis keeps some kind of suburban elegance.  She makes a breakfast of Cracker-Jack after a cold wet night sleeping on the ground in Central Park look like heaven.",1007596800,2,540,4.712765957446808
258894,5,6300216179,"I love this film! I very seldom disagree with one of Leonard Maltin's reviews. But I sure did on this one. He claims this movie is ""excruciating"". Well...yes, I think so too. Excruciatingly funny, that is!

I think that Jack Lemmon is wonderfully ""over the top"" in this picture. His character (as far as I see it) is obviously written to be played way, way over the top. That's what makes it funny. Realistically, we have to know that all 64 (or so) crises and maladies that befall this poor midwestern couple could not ALL happen at once in a million years. So, therefore, I think the viewer must look upon Lemmon as more of a ""caricature"" than a ""character"" in this film.

Most of this movie was filmed outdoors, and there's a nice ""Big Apple"" flavor here (circa 1970).

Some of my favorite lines of dialogue from ""The Out-Of-Towners"":

Lemmon (upon hearing his luggage didn't arrive): ""Well you flew ME through the fog! How come you're now worried about two leather valises?!""

Lemmon (after frisking little boy in bushes searching for funds): ""...Explain to the police? What I was doing in the woods with a little boy...with my hands in his pockets?!? They'd give me twenty years!""",997660800,6,1185,4.677884615384615
