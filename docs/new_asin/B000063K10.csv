7959241,5,B000063K10,"There is a certain expectation with Fred Olen Ray films. We expect great opening music, super hot actresses and familiar F.O.R returnees.  It's all here as usual and is just as entertaining. If you are new to the ""B"" Movie experience you might want to observe some of the differences before you watch. These type of movies are very low budget and there is not a lot of plot and story happening. This movie is completely shot in, around and in the street outside of the Sorority house. That being said it is a very entertaining Horror/Comedy.  The story begins at the Witch Academy/Sorority House where 3 Witches put a potential member/Pledge through her paces for fun. While that's happening Robert Vaughn enters as the Devil secretly on a mission that puts all in peril . Priscilla Barnes enters  and is clearly ruling the members with an iron fist. The movie isn't laugh out loud funny but is very sexy and kinky at times with numerous nude scenes thrown in to stimulate interest. Everyone involved has bought into the concept setup here and the way especially the actresses remain in character really sells the movie. The extras include a video slideshow, outtakes, a trailer and a really exceptional audio commentary by Fred Olen Ray. Most audio Commentaries suffer from actors or actresses rambling on, talking over each other or can barely be heard at times. That's not a problem here, crystal clear audio by F.O.R. telling you everything about the movie, the actors and actresses and a lot of inside really interesting stuff about how these movies are pieced together . It's a funny/sexy adult comedy and Witch Academy offers something for everyone but not for the kids, 5 stars in my book!",1481587200,,1697,4.784982935153583

Some of the girl's boob shots are nice, but not nice enough to waste your money.  Unless you're dying to see these girls mostly nude, skip this one.

7959244,2,B000063K10,"This DVD is another installment of the B horror movie line.  While many of the B horror movies that I have seen in the past were entertaining and enjoyable, Witch Academy is simply awful.
The plot (if you look hard enough for it) deals with what I believe to be a college serority, but I can't be sure because all of the actresses (for lack of a better word) are way to old to be in college.  Anyway the serority sisters all seem to have special powers (if you call causing unseen explosions powers) which they use mainly for pranks on eachother.  Other than the pranks these powers seem to serve no basic purpose in this movie.  After a party with the local frat gets cancelled, the girls invite a guest over who hopes to become part of their sisterhood.  Little does she know she is being invited over so that the bored serority sisters may harass her and play jokes on her.  To make a long painful story short, she ends up getting locked in the basement of the serority house where she makes a murderous deal with the devil. She undergoes a personality and immage change (compliments of the devil) so that she may find human sacrifices for the devil.  And so it goes....
This movie suffers from terrible acting by just about the entire cast and a story that a two year old must have come up with.  The only bright spot in this flick is the attractive actresses that bare it all time after time.  The nudity however does not make this movie worth viewing much less owning.  Save your time and money for something a little better than this. I don't think that even the most dedicated B movie fan will enjoy this movie.  There is far better out there.",1016582400,5,1651,4.380327868852459
