7689816,4,B01CT3SW46,"While some shorts surpassed others by leaps and bounds, this movie was overall pretty f-ing awesome. This is NOT a movie for horror fans that want something serious with intricate plot-lines, twists, or even mind-blowing special effects. But! If you're a fan of cheesy effects, satirical comedy and dark humor -this is the film for you. The monsters featured are either not commonly seen in films or are well-known creatures with original stories. The shorts don't connect like in films such as, Trick r Treat or Southbound, but for me that's not an issue. If you've seen ABCs of Death 1 or 2, that's essentially what you're getting into, but with more of a comedic twist.

Overall I thought it was entertaining and the gems in the anthology line up made up for the shorts that were kind of a miss. Oh and I must recommend you do not watch this sober for ultimate enjoyment. Especially with that one short (and if you've seen it, you know exactly which one I'm referring to).",1466640000,4,975,4.635838150289017

There were a couple that were somewhat scary but none of them take themselves seriously.a couple of stand outs for me are ""Stay At Home Dad""  ""Curiosity Kills"" and ""Hellyfish"".

There was gore but very unrealistic effects. This anthology wasn't meant to be at all serious but pure schlock and comedy! I found it entertaining in a ""that was so ridiculous but hilarious kind of way"".",1465430400,6,631,4.814814814814815

7689831,1,B01CT3SW46,"OK, I failed in this case to read the reviews where this is described as a ""horror anthology"".

Horror Anthology means a load of brain flatulence reflected as short pieces. I stopped halfway through to write this review because I still feel ripped off.

Often the trailer to a film can be described as ""giving away the movie"": in this case the trailer seemed to indicate this was full-length creative horror film and not a useless mix of lame vignettes with lots of red liquid splashed around.

I don't accept the ""It's camp!"" defense, either.

Really not happy I rented this.",1468713600,,576,4.673267326732673

7689833,3,B01CT3SW46,"Well that was certainlyweird. Produced by Dread Central, Monsterland is a horror anthology that features several short film segments and a wraparound story. The project not only utilizes film but also animation, stop-motion Claymation, and even, dare I say itpuppets. And by puppets I mean the type that look like they were made during a childrens TV show like Sesame Street. Monsterland embraces the bizarre! monster 2

The wraparound story which kicks off the movie finds a survivor of some sort of monster attack taking refuge in his neighborhood theater, surrounded by dead bodies and carnage, grabbing some popcorn and sitting down to watch the movie. Roll a series of short films that all feature a monster theme but are otherwise not connected.

In Grey Matter an office worker has a huge hole in the back of his head but is otherwise normal. Normal except for the fact that his brain is missing and he has a worm-like parasite that talks and gives him dating advice about how to attract the hot girl in the office.

Curiosity Kills is essentially a live action cartoon. Theres no dialog other than some screams and shrieks. A little boy gets into his scientist fathers briefcase and concocts a potion which turns his rat into a super, carnivorous rat. It is beyond silly and filled with cartoon-style sound effects and sight gags.

Hag finds a man who begins to experience terrible nightmares and sees a withered woman in his bedroom. But what does his wife have to do with it? Easily the most terrifying of the shorts.

House Call features a prominent dentist who has an unwanted visitor show up on his doorstep. Armed with a gun, the man claims he is turning into a vampire and demands the dentist remove his incisors. Without his regular tools or anesthetic, he is forced to use a monkey wrench to remove the teeth. Not for the squeamish!

Happy Memories is the aforementioned homemade puppet sequence and honestly its like arts and crafts day if someone was on hallucinogenic drugs.

In Stay at Home Dad we find a father who stays home to take care of his baby daughter while his wife works. To earn extra money he takes part in an experimental testing program that develops breasts in men so he can breastfeed his baby.  Some Lovecraftian undertones are the highlight of this one.

Finally Hellyfish, my favorite short in the batch, is about giant jellyfish that attack beachgoers. These range from beach ball-sized to monstrous Kaiju-sized terrors. Its good, cheesy sort of 1960s monster movie fun.

The wraparound sequence concludes with our lone theater patron having to flee from an attacking monster. Monsterland is uneven as most anthologies usually are. Hellyfish and Hag and the gems; Curiosity Kills and House Call are ok. The rest is forgettable. The film would have worked better had there been something to tie the various shorts together but as it is they are completely random.  I can honestly say, however, that you have probably never seen anything quite like Monsterland.",1466899200,3,3001,4.853228962818004

8754131,2,B01CT3SW46,"I saw MONSTERLAND at my local video store (yes, they still exist and I regularly support them). Im always on the lookout for the next great bad movie and based off the description on the cover, MONSTERLAND looked like it might be one of those. I was really wrong.

MONSTERLAND is labeled as a horror anthology.  The movie is an anthology in the sense it is a collection of short films. However, thats about it. In terms of horror, there are only a couple of shorts that are truly scary.

The overall concept for the anthology is that the world is undergoing a monster apocalypse and one of the remaining human survivors decides to take refuge in a movie theatre. After every two or three shorts, the camera breaks back to the man in the movie theatre and we return to him at the very end of the movie, too.  The shorts in MOSTERLAND are as follow:

Dont Go Into the Water  this very, very short film revolves around a group of young friends who go skinny dipping in a lake late one night.

The Grey Matter  a man wakes up with a hole in the back of his head that he believes he received from a fall. He discovers that there is a grey parasite living in the hole that offers the man some dating tips to land the hot girl in the office. Theres a kind of twist ending to the short.

Curiosity Kills  this short is kind of like a live action cartoon; more like ITCHY AND SCRATCHY than TOM AND JERRY. A man, who is a scientist, comes home one day with some beakers full of some dangerous chemical and warns his son not to mess with them. However, the boy steals the vials and experiments on his pet rat. The rat mutates and causes death and destruction.

Hag  this short is legitimately the most frightening of all the shorts in MONSTERLAND. A man wakes up to find his wife sleepwalking and sleeptalking to their open bedroom window doors. They seek counseling, but the probably persists. However, soon the man begins seeing an old hag at the foot of his bed and hovering over him, preventing him from moving. His nightmares continue and become worse. Who is the hag and what does she want?

Monster Man  this is a short cartoon. It features a couple of hunters being hunted by a monster. One of the hunters makes a telephone call to the Monster Man to kill the monster. When the Monster Man shows up, the hunter is taken back because the Monster Man is an old man with a walker. However, hes not exactly what he appears to be.

House Call  a man breaks into the home of a dentist a threatens him at gunpoint to remove his bicuspids. He claims he believes he is turning into a vampire. The dentist illustrates to him that hes not a vampire because his reflection can still be seen in a mirror, but relents and removes the mans teeth.

Happy Memories  this is basically a puppet show written by someone on an acid trip. It makes no sense and has no meaning.

Stay at Home Dad  a slacker father agrees to undergo a medical procedure so he can produce breast milk to feed his young child and so his wife can return to work.

Hellyfish  a short movie that has effects the look like something made by The Asylum. Basically, an undetonated nuclear bomb in the ocean has caused a swarm of jellyfish to mutate so they can walk on land and grow in size.  Chaos erupts when the jellyfish invade a popular beach.

There were a few shorts I really enjoyed. These were The Grey Matter, Monster Man, Hag, and House Call.  The Grey Matter feels more like a short part of a longer story. Hag is a really well developed and rounded short film. House Call feels like a Stephen King story brought to life on screen.  Some people won't enjoy Monster Man, but I found this short animated bit to be really funny.

Overall, I was disappointed by MONSTERLAND. Most of the shorts weren't very good or were completely underdeveloped and one was plain awful (Happy Memories).  There are a few gems, but because of the lack of quality of the other films, it really isn't worth watching this whole DVD just to watch those shorts. Id recommend checking them out individually online.",1476748800,2,4047,4.381526104417671

8754135,4,B01CT3SW46,"This is a series of campy shorts. During a monster attack, a man sits in a movie theater and makes me crave popcorn. He watches on the screen a number of short features, campy with a twist. There was a puppet sequence at about an hour into the film I could have done without. In 1958 Iran was a US ally, and not a Russian ally...just saying. The animated monster hunter was similar to a man in ""The City of Rott"" which used the same type of animation. If you like camp and Creepshow, give it a view, I am sure one bit will make you smile. Shorts include a parasite in a man's head, mutant Jellyfish, a man with nursing breasts, vampire at dentist, kids skinny dipping, radioactive rat, and a hag.
