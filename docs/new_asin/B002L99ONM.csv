Seeing ethical harvesting of a wide variety of animals at 1000+ yards is simply amazing.  Mark Thompson uses a video camera that films from inside his scope during the shots, so you feel like you're right there.  You have to see it to believe it.  Mark doesn't hide his methods or equipment either.  There's no magic here.  Rather, he goes into great detail about what it takes to repeat these amazing shots over and over again and seeing is believing!  I think about all of the shots at trophy deer and elk that I did not take on past hunting trips because they were too far away and I just wish I would have seen this film sooner.  I was so inspired by the DVD that a couple months later I took Marks long range shooting course and bought one of his guns and scopes. It's now been 4 years since I took his course and I couldn't be happier with my ability to now make accurate 1000+ yard shots.  I am so glad I saw this video!  I still watch it before I go on hunting trips because it helps me prepare for the shots and during the off season because it's so much fun to see the animals, and all the cool places they hunt.  Buy this DVD, you won't be disappointed!",1463616000,,1264,4.160493827160494
