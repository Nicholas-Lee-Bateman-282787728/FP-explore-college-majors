8307994,5,B001H5OOZO,"Great coming of age movie from 1970 Sweden. A very simple story, but done really well, with heartfelt and meaningful performances from the main characters. Ann-Sofie Kylin, who plays Annika, is so incredibly beautiful, she really captured my heart from first scene to last. The film is beautifully shot and gives a wonderful look at Sweden of that time, through the eyes of teenagers then. The strong influence of American and/or English pop culture is present in many scenes throughout the film. You can almost hear ABBA coming, just right around the corner. Beautiful orchestral music opens the film and is woven throughout. Loved this movie.",1462838400,,644,5.084905660377358

8307996,5,B001H5OOZO,"A Swedish Love Story (1970) entirely filmed in the summer of 1969, was the debut full-length film by Roy Andersson who is now internationally known for his surreal and quirky Swedish films he so rarely makes.  Before shooting the love story between two teens, Andersson was fascinated by the Czechoslovak New Wave Cinema, which propagated and poked fun of
absurdities of everyday life.  A Swedish Love Story is a film similar in many aspects to films such as:  Blue Lagoon (1980), Pauline on the
Beach (1983), and Love Story (1970).  However, this film is not only about the love between two young people.  To that innocent first love, Andersson adds the world of adults...a world that is full of hatred, envy, personal problems, loneliness, emotional pain, drama, etc.  Andresson masterfully captures two young people falling for each other while being surrounded by jealous friends and occupied with their
own problems parents who at first think nothing of the growing love between the two youngsters.  The last 15 minutes of the film are really
absurd and the film becomes very reminiscent of the Czechoslovakian films made in the 1960's.  I did not like the ending, but I guess there is a message there...those last 15 minutes do serve some sort of purpose...to say the least.

Quick synopsis:
Fifteen year old Par while visiting his grandfather at a sanatorium sees a beautiful young girl who is also visiting one of her ill stricken relatives with her entire family. The beautiful young girl is a fourteen year old Annika, who is paying a visit to her aunt who has suffered from a mental breakdown caused by a love affair gone wrong (inferred).  Annika quickly catches Par looking at her, and she too becomes
interested in the boy.  Both visits soon end, and the two teens leave with their parents in separate ways.  Sometime later, Par (who works at his father's auto garage and owns a small motorcycle) runs into Annika on the street...

PS.
Irwin Barbe incorporated some footage of the film to the rhythm of ""Thieves Like Us--Shyness"", which can be found on YT.  A well done video that captures the atmosphere of the film.",1434326400,4,2131,4.8347107438016526
8307997,5,B001H5OOZO,"This is a wonderful film about the innocence of youth and the pureness of love that is only possible when you are untainted by failed dreams or the harshness of the real world.  This film excels at showing the attraction and feeling between two young lovers - Annika and Par - who engage in awkward courtship rituals, then fall head over heels in fascination and longing for each other.  Their love seems true and pure and sincere, and the acting, screenplay, and filming all create a truly magical ambiance here, and you just *feel* the emotions that these two 14 year olds feel.

Ambiance is where this film shines.  It creates beautiful moods.  It shares feelings in an empathetic way to the characters.  You could even say that the ambiance alone makes the movie memorable and worth seeing multiple times.  Suspend your cynicism, and just allow yourself to be 14 and feel what a 14 year old feels.  This film works at that level of pure emotion better than almost any similar themed film I have ever seen.  As one example, the opening scene where Annika and Par first notice each other while standing together in a line looks like each of them feels love at first site, and as a viewer of that moment I believe that emotion was present in each of them.  I cannot remember seeing a movie that caught that moment in such an authentic way.  Another highlight is when the two young lovers slow dance on top of a bed, each of them lost in happiness.  These are remarkably genuine moments that you rarely see in films.

Where this movie does not do as well is in the power of its story telling.  This film spends a lot of time interacting with the adults in Annika and Par's families.  The adults in this film are jaded.  Some of them - like Annika's father - have had their spirits and any optimism destroyed by life.  The film apparently wanted to make thematic points by juxtaposing the cynicism and bitterness of these adults against the innocence and pure belief in emotion of the young lovers.  Yet the film really does not do this story telling well.

Here are points the film could have made, and here are the ways it failed to make those points well:

* The movie could have told a Romeo and Juliet story about how bickering adults try to stop star-crossed lovers.  But this theme is never developed.  The bickering between the adults is awkward and unclear.  It is clear that Annika's father and Par's father grow to dislike each other, but that is not explored well or clearly explained.  And in the end the fact that the families have these issues with each other imposes nothing on the young lovers.  There is no ultimatum to stop seeing each other.  There are no difficult choices being imposed on Annika and Par.  In fact, the young lovers seem oblivious to any knowledge about the growing feud between their families.

* The film could have told a story about how cynical adults can ruin innocence.  Sure, many 14 year olds can feel pure emotions, but adults can weigh down young people with rules and anger and cynicism and not let them experience the world with full joy.  But the movie never explores these points.

* The film could have told a story about how the young lovers might become jaded and ugly like their families, by studying the relationship over a period of time, as the lovers become more adult.  But - again - the film failed to do this.

What was the purpose of the many sequences with the adults?  There are many ways a theme or two could have been developed and then could be weaved into the story to actually affect the relationship between the lovers.  That never happens.  This all leaves you feeling that the sequences with the adults are wasted story-telling.  I wish I could take the original film sequences, write in a narration, and re-release this film.  I think this film could become something amazing.

Perhaps the film just wanted to make the point that youth can be pure joy and lack of stress whereas adulthood will always mean a lot of responsibility and stress and significantly compromising your happiness.  This could have been done by having the adults connect back to their own childhoods in their dialog, but the points are never clearly made.  It's sad that the film may be showing us a window into young Annika and Par's joyful love, only to imply to us that they too will be destroyed by adulthood.

Here are some minor nit picks I had about the main characters:

* Annika does not talk enough in this movie.  The movie seems to just ride on her beauty and gives the distinct impression that she has very few real thoughts.  I thought that was too shallow, even for a movie about shallow 14 year old love.

* Why don't we hear the conversations between the two lovers?  On top of there being very little actual spoken dialog from the two main characters, the few times they are together and openly sharing with each other, the movie usually keeps their dialog silent.  There were opportunities there to have the dialog make you believe that the love was more than shallow puppy love.  But all of that opportunity is lost because when they hold each other and whisper and speak to each other, there is only background music.

Video ID B-I5Xr88vhs on Youtube takes a few key scenes from the movie and turns them into a music video.  I think it communicates the ambiance pretty well.

The two kids in this movie are now 59 and 60 years old.  This is shocking because the film looks like it was created yesterday.  The truth about their ages is a reminder to everyone viewing the film that life is but a snap of the fingers and passes amazingly fast.

If you want a movie that lets you remember what it was like to feel 14 years old again - and you aren't too demanding on the requirement to tell a story with important themes worthy of a Shakespearean play - then this movie is a must see.  If you are a person who needs a well developed story line and important themes developed and fully expressed, then you might be a little disappointed.  The things the movie does do well it does brilliantly well.  So even with its flaws I give it five stars.",1425254400,2,6151,4.54

8308000,5,B001H5OOZO,"This is a great little Swedish film released in 1970 but looks like it was filmed yesterday. Others will comment on the portrayal of Sweden and the angst of the adult characters. I love the simple emerging love story between two great kids. In the midst of very ordinary lives with somewhat dysfunctional families, two kids meet and fall in love. A simple old fashioned love story with two actors who were born for these roles. If you are a romantic and still believe in true love in a jaded world, you will love this movie. Just took me 42 years to catch up with this classic.",1329264000,,577,4.401869158878505
8308001,5,B001H5OOZO,"En krlekshistoria (A Love Story) is very much better than anything I have read about it would lead me to expect, and the reason it is so much better is something many who otherwise love the movie criticize it for: that it is NOT just a love story. It is NOT just about the two ethereally innocent and lovely pubescent lovers but about the ugly adults who surround them.

If this movie HAD been only about Pr and Annika, it would indeed have been an extraordinary and breathtakingly beautiful love story, and it would have fulfilled the promise of its title and the hopes of very many viewers. But it is a Roy Andersson movie, and even as a fresh-out-of-school twenty-something making his very first feature-length movie, his genius for cutting through illusion to the hardness under the surface of life was fully in evidence.

Those who see En krlekshistoria as being radically different from his recent movies -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Songs-from-the-Second-Floor/dp/B0001AP0PE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Songs from the Second Floor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-the-Living/dp/B002VWNIFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You the Living</a>&nbsp;- and even from the grossly under-appreciated Giliap, made only a few years after En krlekshistoria, are wearing blinders, choosing to see only the loveliness on its surface and denying the hard reality under and all around the loveliness.

ALL of Andersson's movies are like this one. ALL of them are beautiful on one level and devastatingly harsh on another. That is what makes him such an extraordinary movie-maker and his movies so extraordinarily rewarding to watch. Without the hardness under the surface, the beauty on the surface would be empty and of only minimal, temporary value. It might entertain and delight us, but it would not teach us anything about our own world or change us in any way. We would have been made to feel good for a few minutes, but we would not have gotten anything of lasting value from the experience.

So the ugly adults HAVE to be in this Love Story, because without them this is nothing but a daydream, a fleeting glimpse into the world of young love, a world that is open to us for only a few months as we are making the astounding transition from childhood, like butterflies emerging unsteadily from our cocoons. That innocent, pure and lovely love is not available to adults, or even to adolescents. Once the cocoon has been sloughed and the wings dried and warmed, the butterfly flies off into its ""real"" life, and our fragile, emerging innocence is gone forever.

The adults in En krlekshistoria give its love story the context it needs, call our attention to and accentuate its purity and loveliness, and show us how transient that loveliness is. The point (only one of many) Andersson is making (and we do not want to see) is that Pr and Annika are going to turn out to be just like their parents and other relatives: hard, selfish, stupid, abusive, and ugly. They cannot turn out any other way, because - like it or not - that is how we adults are.

By showing us what Pr and Annika will be like in just a very few months (the bully who beat up Pr is only slightly older but already like the adults), Andersson gives us an invaluable frame for the lovely snapshot he took of them at their loveliest. That moment, that loveliness, is just as real as and certainly more pleasant to look at than the other, adult reality, but the two sharply contrasting realities need each other to make life tolerable. That contrast is what makes En krlekshistoria a work of genius and power, much more than just a sweet but vapid story of young love.",1311811200,3,3733,5.071661237785016
8308002,5,B001H5OOZO,"One of the most realistic portraits of teen-age love I've ever seen.
Sensual, sad, and funny. Two terrific lead performances. Very different
from Andersson's later, much more surreal films. This is grounded in an
amazingly universal reality.

The only weak spot is how the secondary stories of the grown ups around
them take over the last third of the film. These are interesting and
entertaining characters, but it's a bit like 'Romeo and Juliet'
suddenly became about Friar Tuck. Andersson is exploring
class and politics in Sweden, and the point is to set the kids'
innocence against that. But I still feel it's a bit unbalanced.

But all that aside, this is a film I love for the way it captures that
moment where love becomes something real, not just an idea,
and sensuality becomes a part of your life. It's ironic that it's called
'A Swedish Love Story', because - aside from a few cultural markers -
this could be anywhere.

It's a shame that this lovely, gentle film never got a decent US DVD
release, and even the region 2 version is hard to find.",1290124800,6,1057,4.641711229946524
