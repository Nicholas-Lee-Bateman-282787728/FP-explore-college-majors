8760134,5,B01F57SR0W,"A delightful comedy feature from Danny DeVito, a love story to a bygone era.",1475971200,,76,4.5
8760135,5,B01F57SR0W,"The Ratings Game is a hilariously brilliant movie, I'm so glad it's been restored in HD and put out on Blu-ray and DVD. This is my favorite Danny DeVito movie and he directed it too! The writing and satire is witty, on point, and still relevant today. Definitely a must-watch.",1469923200,,276,4.54
8760136,5,B01F57SR0W,"The Ratings Game is a hilarious satire of network television.  They don't make em like this anymore, and didn't make em much then either.  DeVito employs his comic troll persona as Vic DeSalvo, a starstruck trucker from New Jersey, determined to make it big in Hollywood.  With more chutzpah than talent, he's picked the perfect town.  When Vic is treated unfairly (as Mr. Trump might say) by the Industry, he resolves to beat them at their own game, devising a scheme that gets funnier as it goes along.  You may catch echoes of Ealing Studios, Sgt. Bilko, and even Kaufman & Harts Once in a Lifetime here.  Or you may not.  Either way, its funny.",1468886400,3,648,4.582608695652174
8760137,5,B01F57SR0W,"I personally think that ""The Ratings Game"" is the funniest TV movie ever made and long overdue for a Blu-Ray release. It's a sharp satire on the era when the Big Three Networks ruled TV.  Snappy direction by Danny DeVito (Who also stars), a smart script, and an eclectic supporting cast (Huntz Hall, Selma Diamond, Tracey Walter, Kevin McCarthy, George Wendt, Gerrit Graham, Ronny Graham, John Megna, Steve Allen, Michael Richards) make this a must-see.  Letter-perfect take-offs on 80's  television programs with titles like ""The Dawn Patrol,"" ""H.O.T.B.O.D.s and LaVar,"" ""Sittin' Pretty,"" ""WACked Out"" and ""Bayonne"" still make me laugh. The love story between DeVito and Rhea Perlman is funny and touching at the same time.",1464739200,3,724,5.224137931034483
8760138,5,B01F57SR0W,"First off, the trailer is for ""MATILDA"" not ""The Ratings Game."" Second off, all the reviews here are for ""MATILDA"", NOT ""The rating Game."" My 5* is for The Ratings Game. Fun movie. The Ratings Game was a made for TV movie.",1464307200,,222,4.309523809523809
