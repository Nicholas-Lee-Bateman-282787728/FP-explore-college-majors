8340073,4,B001SQ1ZZE,"This DVD is a great amuse bouche, to decide if you may be interested in having Dr. Crossan speak to your group. I used it to advertise his appearance at the Moravian College / Seminary in October, and it worked like a charm. Dr. Crossan is exactly as he appears on this long interview. One almost wishes the moderator's introduction and the interviewer's questions were edited out. When I showed it, I fast forwarded through them, and felt I missed nothing at all. It may seem a tad pricey for just an interview. But, if you are having him speak for you, it is a great means of building up interest in his lectures.",1419724800,,615,4.4035087719298245
8340074,3,B001SQ1ZZE,"Crossan speaks before an audience about his book JESUS: A REVOLUTIONARY BIOGRAPHY (which I'd read prior to seeing the video). Much of the video is also devoted to Q&A, which could have been better edited. Specifically, the viewer must wait 15-20 seconds while the person carrying the microphone for audience members to ask questions moves from one side of the auditorium to the other. Why these numerous pauses were not edited out of the video is beyond my comprehension.",1369872000,2,471,4.974683544303797
8340075,5,B001SQ1ZZE,Crossan explains cutting edge scholarship in such a clear and lucid manner that old prejudices and ideas can be suspended while new research results can at least be assessed and thought about. First class.,1266969600,2,205,5.0588235294117645
