3105310,4,B0013ERFFU,"Okay, so Christopher Guest only makes a movie every three or four years, and For Your Consideration was not up to snuff: The Grand is in the fine mockumentary tradition started by the funniest film ever (AFI rating) ""This Is Spinal Tap."" The Grand is in the same vein as Best In Show, following disparate wacky characters in a contest, interspersed with interviews. It does not feel improvised, like the best Guest films and TIST--more scripted like The Office. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is very amusing--no gross-out bathroom jokes, not cheap-shot sophomoric humor; instead, well-crafted  (appropriately exaggerated) characterizations. Druggie Woody Harrelson has been living in a rehab facility for the past two years b/c it was easier than constantly readmitting him. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins in TIST) plays a Donald Trump type real estate mogul trying to buy out Woody's Las Vegas casino, the site of the Grand poker tournament (winner-take-all prize $100 MM). Various competitors include filmmaker Werner Herzog as The German, a rodent-killing sociopath, Dennis Farina as a Rat Pack style Old School Vegas guy, David Cross as the loser acting-out brother of Cheryl Hines, a Poker Mom. The Announcers are poor imitations of Fred Willard's Best in Show tour de force, but there are several clever products mentioned that are worth replaying to read all the stuff written on the boxes.
Bottom line: if you like the Guest films, The Office, and This is Spinal Tap, give this a try.",1214956800,2,1503,5.109756097560975
3105311,4,B0013ERFFU,"I don't know much beyond the basics about the game of poker.  I usually flip right past those poker tournaments that are always being shown on cable these days - although, after watching this movie, I think I'll be more inclined to put down the remote and stop to watch them from now on.  This movie is a very well-edited mix of written dialogue and (more) actor improvisation that surprisingly works most of the time.  There are a few parts, mostly involving Woody Harrelson's character, that are a little over-the-top.  However, even those are pretty funny in context.  Most of the actors (except one) are pretty serious poker players in real life, so they were able to get completely into their parts.  In fact, the climactic final round of the tournament was staged as a REAL game between the actors where the director and producer actually did NOT KNOW who was going to win.  Because of that, they pre-shot different versions of some of the post-tournament scenes because some actors had to leave early and they didn't know in advance which ending they'd need to use.  The unused scenes show up as extras on the dvd.  Because they were playing for real, the final showdown between Woody Harrelson and Cheryl Hines was a huge shock for both the actors and the audience.  It was great to see the genuine surprise on their faces, rather than to see them ""acting"" surprised.  So, I recommend the movie itself quite highly.  However, as a bonus, this dvd also has one of the most informative and entertaining commentary tracks I've heard with a movie.  Usually, directors drone on and on about camera angles and lighting.  These guys just let loose with anecdotes about every interesting thing that happened while they were making the movie, and it is as entertaining as the movie itself.  This one's a keeper.",1214784000,4,1810,4.738019169329074
3105312,4,B0013ERFFU,"This was a funny, well-written satire of those who populate the poker championship world. Such people are often flamboyant odd balls, willing to do almost anything to have the edge over the competition. This movie makes you feel like you know them up close, and yet are sympathetic to their oddities.

The cast of the Grand (the name of the champioship) is an impressive group of well-known comedians and character actors, including Ray Romano and Jason Alexander, among many others.  It is fast paced and interesting.

Whether you are a poker player or not, this movie is worth seeing for the outstanding performances and good script.",1214784000,3,635,4.971698113207547
3105313,4,B0013ERFFU,"If this movie were directed by Christopher Guest it would have been great, but it is still pretty funny. The characters are all pretty funny in a dry mockumentary sort of way, and the jabs at televised Texas Hold Em are right on. You'll like this movie if you play cards and/or you already like any of the actors. You won't cry laughing but you also won't roll your eyes at some stupid joke(s).

Not bad for Zakk Penn's debut as writer and director. He's pretty much written most of Marvel's back catalog of superhero films--X-Men, etc...

3105314,1,B0013ERFFU,"I like playing poker, but very few films can take a card game and turn it into something that will hold your attention for an hour or more.  Sadly, neither my husband nor I enjoyed ""The Grand"" and for once, we're both in agreement on a star rating.

The idea behind ""The Grand"" is to turn a poker tournment into something of a reality show with game play interspersed between character commentary. Writer Zak Penn's script is really only about 29 pages long, so the cast is doing a lot of improv.

""The Grand"" follows six players as they compete in a $2,000,000 pot Texas Hold'em tournament in Vegas.

Woody Harrelson is Jack Faro. He is a lifetime drug abuser (he's tried everything you can smoke and snort) who has inherited the ""Rabbit's Foot Casino"" from his grandfather. If he doesn't win the tournament, he's going to lose the casino.

Plus there are the twins:  Lainie and Larry Schwartzman. Laine (Cheryl Hines) is a Mom who works to support her family playing poker.  Her husband is a fantasy football junkie who she wishes would find 'something else.'

Larry Schzartzman (David Cross) is a single man who's known for his obnoxious behavior at the table.

Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell) is a statistics savant with what I suspect is a massive case of Aspergers. He still lives with his Mom, who is about the only person he can (barely) stand.

Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina) is a politically-incorrect old geezer who has been on the circuit for years and will cheerfully bemoan what has become of the game to anyone who's foolish enough to listen.

Andy Andrews (Richard Kind) is a newbie who knows nothing about poker, but by sheer luck has won a chair in the tournament.

You also have a huge supporting cast of actors and real poker players. My problem was, there wasn't a single player in the tournament who I could cheer for. Worse, when the announcer mis-called a hand, I was pretty much ready to fold on the film myself.

I've enjoyed several gambling films, including ""Maverick"" and ""Rounders"", but ""The Grand"" failed to live up to my expectations.  Thanks, I'd rather spend an hour and a half playing penny ante and experience the thrill first hand.

3105315,5,B0013ERFFU,"A light hearted comedy with a fantastic group of comic actors, many of them on my top favorites list. You don't have to be into cards, or know anything about poker, to enjoy this story about a drunk casino owner (Woody Harrelson) who gets out of rehab eager to get 'The Rabbit's Foot' out of hock by winning 10 million in a winner takes all card game. The viewer gets a quick behind the scenes look at each 'quirky' character sitting at the table. Be sure to watch the special features as well including commentaries with some of the actors. I always enjoy the 'extras' added to the DVDs.

The last 1/2 hour of the celebrity tournament goes on way too long - it's like they were looking for filler to make it a 90 minute release. Some hilarious moments - Chris Parnell, Werner Herzog, but overall a bit of a dud. I guess that's why limited theatrical release didn't go national.

As a rule, I enjoy the extras, while my sainted wife is there strictly for the movie or TV program.  Sorry... bottom line.

3105328,2,B0013ERFFU,"As you can see, I did buy the DVD for this movie and it's not worth the $3 I paid for it.

I didn't find this movie that good. It starts off very slow and the drags a lot by showing and introduction of these 6 main players. These 6 people are for the final poker table for The Grand. They all have their own story to tell and they take awhile telling it. Also, they follow each character around after their poker matches, and this slows down the movie even more. In fact, it's take up more 80% to 90% of the movie. Everything else after that is just them at the final table and finishing up the movie. BTW, this is the only real poker scene in the whole movie. Everything is just a back story of more back stories.

So, what we got here is one back story after another and it's so boring. This really slow down the peace of the movie and bores the audience to death. If they wanted to do characters development, they needed to do that some other way, where the movie itself isn't killing itself slowly by not just going to the next back story.

People say this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but it's just below average slap-stick film. The jokes involve the ""Real"" Poker Players' stories and they take that and then mix it with the main characters' stories. All of them main characters represent real life poker players' and so of the stories can be funny and some are not funny.

An example of what I'm talking about is the Unabomber Phil Laak. He is known for taking his hood and wrapping it around his head with his sun-glasses on. This makes him look like the Unabomber. Well, in this movie, you see that, and then you see another main cast member. He'll take a knight's helmet and puts that on, then, he'll shuts the lid looking at Phil Laak. If you think that's funny, that's about the funniest thing in the movie and you don't need to watch it now. All the jokes after that is sup-par and won't make you laugh after that. I can't even remember the rest of the jokes because they just didn't make me laugh or were memorable.

If you do manage to get the DVD, you might be interested in the movie because it does have two more alternative endings. They do not make the movie any better, but it does let people know what the writers thought what else could work as the ending. In the end, yes, the movie chose the correct ending for the movie because the others would open up more questions and they would need to do more stuff to finish the movie.

The DVD also has extra scenes to the movie, but they do not make the movie any better. In fact, they should be extra scenes because if they actually left those scenes in their, it will even make a worse movie, even more boring.

The DVD also has one more section for extra scenes for each main character. They are not worth the time to even watching. They add nothing!!!

I only recommend this movie if you want to see a lot of famous poker faces in the movie. They don't do much in the movie as they are just making cameos. You won't even see them play poker, they just are there and you see them. Also, don't watch this if you want to see good poker plays, moves, or strategy. This is just an below average comedy.",1364256000,,3174,4.208881578947368

3105332,3,B0013ERFFU,"The Grand (Zak Penn, 2007)

It is damned tough to make a good movie about poker. Many have tried since the poker boom hit. None have succeeded; the only truly great poker movie, Rounders, was made five years before that. But that doesn't stop folks from trying, and let's be honest--while a poker player is going to be able to comment on the ridiculousness of the final hands in movies like The Cincinnati Kid, Maverick, or (the worst case of poker egregiousness in history, to date) Casino Royale, maybe the general public won't notice. Or, at least, that's what I'm figuring the writers of these movies say to themselves when trying to pitch themselves on writing scenes that require one's suspension of disbelief to stretch farther than the Overseas Highway. The Grand's isn't quite that bad, but the errors that plague the movie's poker are of the even-more-egregious variety, and Penn and co-writer Matt Bierman decided to try to pair the poker movie (already an ill-fated venture) with the improv comedy movie. That as much of it succeeds as it does is a minor miracle.

Plot: One Eyed Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson) is the wastrel son of a casino owner who finds himself in desperate need of cash to save the family legacy, which a robber baron (Michael McKean) wants to buy and turn into a million-dollar-per-night hotel/entertainment extravaganza. Thus, he does what any enterprising young man in need of cash would do--enter a major poker tournament that will win him enough money to pay off the casino's debts, as long as he can outlast such poker-playing lights as Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina), Lainie Schwartzman (The Ugly Truth's Cheryl Hines), Fred Marsh (Ray Romano), Yakov Achmed (Jason Alexander), Reggie Marshall (Mike Epps), and the mysterious player known only as The German (Werner Herzog in a rare trip in front of the camera), along with a few other guys you may have heard of like Doyle Brunson, Daniel Negreanu, Phil Laak, Phil Hellmuth...

When the movie stays on point, it's quick, it's funny, and as long as the writers aren't attempting poker analysis, it's reasonably intelligent. The poker profiles, a la the WSOP filler material on ESPN, range from the amusing (Ray Romano's skit) to the downright hilarious (every time the Schwartzmans are onscreen). Michael McKean, as usual, is gold every time he gets in front of a camera.

And then there are the downsides, which start with every time the movie attempts to show poker being played. I'm amazed Phil Gordon, who plays the poker commentator announcing the tournament for TV, didn't smack people upside the head with the script for all the stupidity they send spewing out of his mouth. The improv comedy bits... well, some of them work (see previous bit about the Schwartzmans), but most fall flat; the only other character who really works 100% of the time is The German, and that's because Herzog plays him straight, with an air of menace that does not fit at all with this movie, and yet it works. Which should be an indicator right there that something is failing, but somehow it didn't raise any alarm bells.

Short answer: if you're in the mood for a poker movie and you've watched everything else on the subject you own, give this a go. The parts that work make it worth your time, and hey, it's a helluva lot better than Lucky You. ** ",1357430400,,3327,4.797556719022688

3105334,3,B0013ERFFU,"This is a fairly plot-less quirky movie about a poker tournament. The film gives you the background of a number of fictional players, and then you watch them play cards and interact. THE PLAYERS:

""One Eye"" Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson)- Has spent his last 2 years in rehab. Has never met a girl he didn't marry or a drug he didn't like. Wants to save the casino he inherited.

Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell)- He is a math nerd who his heavily into ""Dune"". Lives at home with his mother (Estelle Harris)....by will alone.

Laine Schwartzman (Cheryl Hines)She is from Long Island and has always been her Dad's (Gabe Kaplain) favorite. She is married to Fred (Ray Romano ) who has been hit by lightning and is not all together, but is functional. He likes to make up handshakes and sayings.

Lanny Schwartzman- (David Cross) The nerdy brother of Laine. She always beat him at games as a child. Nobody beats her at Candyland...ask her kids.

Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina)- Old time poker gambler.

The German (Werner Herzog)- He is also an old time gambler. He enjoys all kinds of gambling and killing small animals.

Andy Andrew (Richard Kind)- He is the new breed of Internet gambler, a math teacher from Wisconsin. His wife Sharon (Judy Greer ) owns the finest ribbon shop in Dour Wisconsin.

The movie is hit and miss. If you are into the characters, you will find a film worthy of a view. If not, you will be bored to tears. It is difficult to determine that before you watch it. I like Woody, so for me it was an easy choice.

3105338,3,B0013ERFFU,"The Grand is a mockumentary that lacks Chris Guest's magic touch, but does have its moments. It's a lampoon of an easy target: poker and the selling of it and the WSOP on tv. The subject needs little tinkering to be funny/ stupid: the real shows are such hymns to greed and selfishness that one need add little.

The highlights here are a few of the actors, specifically Chris Parnell as the internet poker geek, Herzog as The German (playing into type, perhaps), McKean as Steve Lavisch (clearly based on Steve Wynn), and a few of the others at moments. Woody is good enough as a Ted Binion-type, and David Cross is a humorous cross between Howard Lederer and Phil Hellmuth (now there's an unholy union), with Cheryl Hines as his Annie Duke-ish sister. Any poker fan will recognize the references, but will probably also wonder why this isn't quite as funny as it should have been.

Director Penn has his concept right but never delivers in full; there are laughs but many are forced. My favorite line is Cross' ""Is that Rush?"", and one guesses it was an improv, like much of this. But where Guest has an ensemble that can ad lib with genius, only Cross and McKean can do it at that level here. And seeing as McKean is in all of Guest's movies, I'd recommend all of those before this.

Nonetheless, if you've played cards much or watched the WSOP on the tube, you're bound to enjoy some of The Grand. But if you're not a poker fan, there will be precious little for you here. Not to worry; you'll see many worse rivers than that as life plays out.",1270598400,,1548,4.443661971830986

3105340,3,B0013ERFFU,"Borrowing the basic structure and  plot of Christopher Guest's 'Best in Show', 'The Grand' is an improvised, ensemble driven comedy that follows a group of crazy competitors playing for big bucks in a poker tournament. The six featured  players include : Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson), a  drug addict who has been married as many times as he has failed rehab. His uncle left him his casino before he died but Jack lost it to a greedy developer (Guest regular Michael McKean) who plans on tearing it down and building a giant hotel with one room. Jack hopes to win enough money to save his uncle's legacy. Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina) is old school Vegas who fondly remembers the kneecapping days as he zips around the casino on his scooter complete with a bottle of scotch and vanity license plate.  Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell) is a nutcase who lives with his mom. An Internet player he's  constantly chugging a dark concoction  dubbed ""brain juice"" that his mother prepares for him daily.  Andy Andrews (Richard Kind) is a lovable doofus who  stumbled on a pro poker site while looking for antique fireplace pokers. Before he knew it he'd  won the qualifying round and landed himself a seat at the Grand. The German (Werner Herzog) is a scary dude who arrives at the hotel with a luggage cart full of live rabbits. In the next scene he's shown gently petting one of the rabbits before admitting that he calms his nerves by killing something every day. Rounding out the field of players are brother and sister team Larry and Lanie Schwartzman (David Cross and Cheryl Hines). Raised by a competitive father (Gabe Kaplan), Larry has had to watch as Lanie has had more success than him and he burns silently each time his father shows up to their matches holding a sign for her. She is married to a lightning survivor (Ray Romano) whom she doesn't take seriously. There are too many characters and while the film has some funny moments many of them could have been eliminated. This would have freed up more screen time for people like Kind and Herzog. Both Parnell and Hines were hilarious on  T.V.  but it doesn't translate as well on  the big screen. The Parnell character stops the movie dead in it's tracks and should have been cut entirely. Harrelson is decent in the lead but he has a few too many slurred speeches at the main table. The poker action isn't too exciting and not enough real life pros figure into the movie. With that being said there is a priceless scene between Kind and poker legends Doyle Brunson and Phil Hellmuth. David Cross is his usual crazy/brilliant self and him and Gabe Kaplan have some funny and touching scenes together. Herzog is a blast as a man reduced to wandering the halls searching for his rabbit that ran away.

A game, eclectic cast - Woody Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Chris Parnell, Ray Romano, Werner Herzog, Gabe Kaplan - struggles with a mediocre script that, in tone as well as in style, steals clumsily from all those far superior Christopher Guest movies like ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind.""  In the case of ""The Grand,"" the humor is largely lacking, as each eccentric character plays out his little assigned shtick over and over and over again.

As executed by writer/director Zak Penn, the poker scenes are particularly languid and lifeless and utterly incomprehensible to any non-poker players who may happen to be a part of the audience.",1226534400,,795,5.0534351145038165
3105342,2,B0013ERFFU,"I had no idea what to expect when I received ""The Grand"" to review. I had never heard of it. And seeing the cast of well-known actors (Woody Harrelson, Ray Romano, Cheryl Hines), I didn't have a good feeling about it. It's been my experience these are typically flops if I've never even heard of them.

My presumption turned out to be largely correct. ""The Grand"" is cut from the same cloth as ""Best In Show"", ""Spinal Tap"" and the like, and in fact includes many of the same actors tha that you'd expect for what seems like the loosely-scripted genre that included Cheryl Hines (""Curb Your Enthisasm"") and Michael McKean (who is in most of the Christopher Guest mockumentaries).

There are lots of familiar faces in this movie. David Cross (Arrested Development), Gabe Kaplan (Welcome Back, Kotter), Chris Parnell (Saturday Night Live), Dennis Farina, Estelle Harris. The actors all do a decent job but there just isn't much material to work with.

I do have one caveat. Poker has become big business in the USA, and it may well be that I am just ""out of the loop"" in this area and don't understand the subtleties of the game. There are some cameos from real poker players in this movie, and in fact Gabe Kaplan (skin stretched too tight for his years) has been a prominent poker player for years.

The acting is good, the story was not interesting to me, but this may well be worth a view if you're a big fan of any of the actors or the world of Poker.",1226016000,,1453,4.471698113207547

Woody Harrelson (as Jack Faro) heads up an all-star ensemble as a drug-addled loser who has to take the big prize or he'll lose the casino his Grandfather left him. He has the part down as a discombobulated stoner whose multiple ex-wives keep dropping in. He's about the funniest thing here. The only other really interesting character is Cheryl Hines (as Lainie Schwartzman), who at least doesn't act like a cardboard cut-out (Dennis Farina, I'm looking at you).

There are also a ton of cameos, like Jason Alexander, Ray Romano, Hank Azaria, and Shannon Elizabeth. Real life Poker-Pros Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, and Phil Laak also make appearances, as well as filmmakers Brett Ratner and Werner Herzog (who puts in a goofy performance as a bunny loving ""The German""). But none of this jump starts. A few of the folks are genuinely annoying (although naming a soulless numbers geek Harold Melvin is a good joke) and I just wanted to smack Gabe Kaplan's ugly mug as the creepy, overbearing Dad to the Schwartzmann twins. Too many of the 'jokes' were unfunny and forced - especially the tournament TV announcers. Sometimes, a script ain't such a bad idea.

I was literally counting the mintutes till it was over. At 56 minutes there was 48 minutes left. I felt like a marathon runner hitting the wall.

Yet, I feel a strange sense of accomplishment for having lived through it.

A fine cast of actors. Was this supposed to be a mockumentary or a comedy?
There was no clear vision.  There was very little crispy dialogue, no synergy or connection between the characters. There were two jokes, that made me laugh hard, the first was forty minutes, and second was about six minutes later.

As for the acting, Cheryl Hines was good, I think her experience in Curb Your Enthusiasm was invaluable here. Woody Harrelson, well you would have to be a big fan to sit through this one.

If you want to see funny mockumentary, check out the works of Christopher Guest, such as Best in Show, and Spinal Tap, and even A mighty Wind which was a spoof on folk singers.",1221523200,2,1030,4.371727748691099

Unfortunately, The Grand, while occasionally quite funny, is kind of a mess.

In The Grand, a movie about a high-stakes poker tournament, it seems like the director just gave the actors bare outlines of their characters and said ""do something funny."" The whole thing is a pretty clear attempt to make a movie like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-in-Show/dp/B00005ALS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best in Show</a>&nbsp;(Penn goes so far as to use Michael McKean in a small role), but the results just aren't as good.

The problem I often have with ensemble casts is that usually some of the performers are much better than others, but they all get about the same amount of screen time. In The Grand, Richard Kind, Chris Parnell, and Ray Romano seem to base their entire performances on one or two quirks, and really, they aren't very interesting. Werner Herzog, who I would probably watch reading the phone book, is criminally underutilized, and is essentially one joke that keeps repeating itself.  Woody Harrelson, David Cross, and Denis Farina all have some hilarious scenes, but they're few and far between.

The movie also features Celebrity Poker Tournament commentator Phil Gordon as...the tournament's commentator. Gordon's color commentator, played by Michael Karnow, is a combination of Fred Willard's character in Best in Show and Jason Bateman's character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodgeball-A-True-Underdog-Story-Unrated-Edition/dp/B0009HBPN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story (Unrated Edition)</a>, except that he isn't funny.

The biggest problem is that the movie is terribly lopsided.  The first half or so is pretty good, giving background on the players and showing them working their way toward the final, big-money game.  Unfortunately, once they get there, the movie slows to a crawl and the comedy mostly disappears.

Overall, The Grand is a really problematic movie with a few hilarious lines. For fans of Michael McKean's ensemble improv comedies, I'd suggest renting this one.  For others, I'd say skip it.",1219363200,,2410,6.278787878787878

The cast was an excellent choice for an improv style film. They handled their scenes well and some of them left you wishing they had more screen time.

I'm not a big fan of televised poker. It gives me that same feeling as when I flip the channel and find bowling. There's just not enough going on to keep my attention (Generation X). However after watching The Grand I might give it a chance on one of those evenings when nothing is on. Thanks to DVR that doesn't happen too often.

I'm not in the minority giving this movie 3 stars. At the time of my review that's the average. I don't believe that most people will either love or hate this film I think that most people will feel neutral.

With less than predictable results.

THE GRAND doesn't work because of its story, which is hardly worth mentioning.  I'll mention it anyway, since the rest of the review would make less sense if I didn't.  A collection of poker players with different motives and styles come together to compete for $10 million dollars.  (The ""grand"" of the title comes from the name of the tournament.)  There you go.  Now you're all caught up.

Much like Guest's films, plot takes a backseat to the characters who populate it.  These kinds of ensemble comedies are more about giving the actors/actresses a chance to have fun.  The actual script for this film was only about twenty-nine page long; the real treat to the flick is watching a dozen or more comedians at the top of their game bantering the way you'd expect them to if they were, say, playing poker together.

Of course, they stick to personas.  Ray Romano is the lightning-addled Fred Marsh, husband of Cheryl Hines' no-nonsense Lainie Schwartzman, sister to David Cross' overly competitive Larry.  Michael McKean, Woody Harrelson, Dennis Farina, Gabe Kaplan, Chris Parnell.  I could list all of the talent, but then I wouldn't have time to tell you how much I loved this film.

Okay, so I didn't love it.  It runs a little long, and some of the cameos are bewildering (Hank Azaria) and just plain bad (Jason Alexander).  Being a film buff, there were a few that I enjoyed on a rather obscure level (Are you ready for this one?  German director Werner Herzog plays a cut-throat character called The German; four years ago, Herzog stared in a film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incident-at-Loch-Ness/dp/B0006UEVNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incident at Loch Ness</a>, which was a mockumentary of a documentary, directed and co-written by Zak Penn, director of THE GRAND).

Yeah, so that's not what most are likely to get from the movie.  I'll just say that there are things that don't work (try as you might, watching poker is hardly ever what anyone would call funny), but many more things that do.  If you like even half of the names I've already mentioned, you can place odds you'll enjoy, on some level, this little film, even if it doesn't bother hiding any aces up its sleeves.",1216771200,,2991,5.906976744186046
3105352,3,B0013ERFFU,"There's enough funny material in THE GRAND to construct a really funny, sharp comedy film, if the feature were on the short side (say about an hour).  Unfortunately, the film as released runs a long one hundred and four minutes.  It's notoriously difficult to stretch a light, comedy movie for over an hour and a half, and despite possessing a lot of good things one could say about it, THE GRAND shows us why length can hurt.

The film starts with an entire tournament worth of poker players attempting to win a ten million dollar grand prize.  While eventually the cast is whittled down to six, many of the secondary characters get a fair amount of screen time.  The guy with the most compelling case for getting the money is Woody Harrelson (our protagonist), a man who is emerging from a two year stint in rehab and looking to win the money in order to keep his dead grandfather's casino financially afloat.

The cast is filled with a plethora of well-known actors and comedians.  So much so that it's more of a shock when a new character is introduced and one doesn't, in fact, recognize the actor or actress.  For the most part, the cast is uniformly good; even actors I don't usually care for did an admirable job.  Kudos to the rarely seen Gabe Kaplan who easily walks away with every scene he's in.

So it wouldn't be fair to point any fingers of blame for the film's woes in the direction of the actors.  The problems come mostly from the outline of the script and the pacing.  The film really starts to drag the farther along it goes.  This isn't helped by the fact that during the final third, the emphasis appears to move from telling jokes to concentrating on the outcome of the poker games.  I don't think this worked.  The poker stuff was fine when it was a stage for telling jokes, but I don't think it was developed enough for it to carry what nominally is a light and fun comedy.

A film of this length isn't helped by recurring jokes and situations that simply aren't funny.  You'll remember the funny announcers from BEST IN SHOW.  There is a similar gimmick here, but it lightning fails to strike twice.  Just because something was funny in a similar mockumentary, it doesn't follow that the same idea will work in a different film.

If you're a fan of any of the huge number of celebrities who appear, then you'll probably want to check it out.  And even if you aren't, this is still a film worth watching once.  The actors and comedians are all hugely funny.  Many of the one-liners and gags are simply great.

I always liked watching Woody Harrelson on ""Cheers,"" as the dumb bartender who got off good one-liners. He falls flat on his face here, however, as the gambler with 74 wives. If one of those is the runaway bride from the Atlanta area-- the photograph looks just like her with that wide-eyed stare-- then that is mildly amusing. But all the king's horses and all the king's men can't save this scrambled egg of a movie.

3105354,3,B0013ERFFU,"The World Series of Poker on ESPN is a popular game show. This game has become increasingly popular on few other TV channels, and this movie capitalizes on this TV interest. The story revolves around Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson), a semi-rehabilitated gambler, womanizer and a serial groom, hopes to save his casino, left by his grandfather, by winning $10 million at The Grand Championship of Poker in Las Vegas. The field consists of six poker pundits and experts. Jason Alexander (TV series; Seinfeld), Ray Romano (TV Series; Everybody Loves Raymond), Gabe Kaplan (TV series; Welcome Back Kotter), Denis Farina, and Richard Kind (Spin City) star in this comedy directed by Zak Penn. The movie set in Vegas has plenty of inappropriate language, and it moves slowly; many times it is boring. At one instance the ghost of grandfather of Jack Faro appears for no apparent reason and then after a brief conversation disappears. There is no interesting plot or suspense, although I am a fan of Woody Harrelson, I will say that you could do without this movie.

Zak Penn's ""The Grand"" is a Christopher Guest-style improvisational mockumentary that sometimes slips outside of that style into regular movie mode and is not quite as marvelously entertaining as Guest's own work. Perhaps it can be blamed on the subject matter, but the humor here feels a bit darker, and not always in a good way, than the popular Guest mockumentaries, yet it's still got enough funny moments from a fantastic cast to make it worth watching. Probably even more enjoyable for the fan of real TV poker tournaments, this one is worth checking out if anything about it strikes your curiosity. It's nothing too outstanding, but it's worth at least one try. David Cross is hilarious as always, Ray Romano is classic Ray Romano, and Richard Kind is charming as ever. Chris Parnell's character also brings on some of the best moments. There are a ton of other stars in big and small roles, and a nice pile of DVD extras.

What happens when you take a whole bunch of small screen stars - almost none of whom have any major movie presence - into the same movie?  If it's The Grand, it winds up being pretty good.

The Grand is one of those mockumentaries a la This is Spinal Tap or Best in Show (and in fact, Michael McKean from those movies does appear in this one as well).  The backdrop in this case is the world of Championship Poker, where six will meet at the final table for a winner-take-all prize of $10,000,000.  These six are: (1) Woody Harrelson, the more-or-less central character, who is a fast-living partier who needs the money to save the casino he inherited; (2) Cheryl Hines as a mother of five married to Ray Romano and is the brother of (3) David Cross, whose style of play is to be as obnoxious as possible; (4) Richard Kind as the amateur who somehow has made it further than he ever should have; (5) Dennis Farina as the old-school player who bemoans the old days in Vegas; and (6) Chris Parnell as the weird mathematical genius.  A number of other TV stars also appear, including Hank Azaria, Jason Alexander and Gabe Kaplan, as well as some real poker players.

I went into this movie not expecting much and pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  In fact, compared to the other poker movies I've seen, The Grand more than holds its own, with the right amount of humor against a setting that feels like a real poker tournament.

However, what came across as an interesting concept quickly turns into ""Who will have the next cameo"". There are several times in the movie where I felt the plot took a backseat to getting someone screen time.

This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but the only thing to laugh at is the poor plot. I can not believe this movie was able to get the star power in it. Not even a high rolling cast of actors could save this terrible story.

I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more poker and less filler and uninteresting plot lines.

In the end, this is no where near the quality of movie I Was hoping it would be. If you are looking for a poker-ish movie watch Rounders or 21. Skip this one all together and save yourself the time.",1215820800,2,905,4.154285714285714
3105359,1,B0013ERFFU,"I really looked forward to watching this movie.  It seemed an interesting premise: a man, (""Jack Faro"", played by WOODY HARRELSON),
wants to save the large, Las Vegas Casio-Hotel which he inherited from his grandfather, (the casino's builder), from a greedy developer.  To do so, he must enter a Poker Tournament, and win the winner-take-all ten million dollar prize.  He must play against an assortment of other players -- a housewife, an old-time gambler, a computer genuis, an amateur who has practiced online, and other assorted gamblers.

If this movie were written well, it would be an insight into human beings and human nature.  As a comedy, (which this movie purports to be), it would also be funny and enjoyable to watch.  But this movie is not funny, and tells little of real human nature.  It is not a comedy -- at least, I found nothing funny in it, except for two small jokes, at the beginning of the movie, when Jack Faro has a conversation with a barmaid.....

What this movie is, is a film full of is a story that drags on and on, and on and on, and on, and.....on....and...on.... with bad writing -- and even worse language.  I'm not a fan of four-letter words, but have
still liked some movies, (""Love Story"", and ""The Blair Witch Project""), which included them.  These two movies had GOOD WRITING, and AN EXCITING STORY, which, sadly, ""THE GRAND"" does not.  Four-letter and slang words, in these two movies, were used at appropriate times.  In ""The Grand"", they are, most of the time, just put in for shock value.

The writers of this movie MUST have written better movies. (No-one could continually write movies of this calibre and have them released, could they?)  This movie, unfortunately, belongs to a type of movie which I once saw categorized as: ""It wasn't released. It escaped!)  One thing I will say: they are equal-opportunity stereotypers!
Germans, Jews, (of both the secular and religious variety), Arabs, cross-dressers, adult children who live with their parents, (and those parents),
old-time gamblers, handicapped people....all are stereotyped here, presumably for a ""laugh"" value....but I found myself groaning instead.

The acting isn't half-bad, the directing is quite good, and the music is tuneful and appropriate.  The costuming, lighting, and camera-work are OK as well.  It's also nice to see real-life Las Vegas locations, (the movie was filmed at the Golden Nugget Casino-Hotel in Las Vegas)  -- but NOTHING, nothing at all, can ever save any movie with as terrible a script and story as this one has ):  it's really too bad -- because handled differently, this could have made an interesting, involving, and funny movie.....

The poker scenes are exciting.  I wish there were more of them!  Seeing GABE KAPLAN -- who once starred in ""Welcome Back, Kotter"", and is now a real-life professional poker player -- was a treat! It would have been nice, as well, amidst the poker tournament, to have these poker players interact with players of other table games -- roulette, blackjack, dice -- and one could have seen the different types of personalities which are drawn to each these different games....  But only poker players -- and more accurately, stereotypes, (and unfunny stereotypes, at that), of poker players, are seen here.

The packaging for this DVD is far better than the movie itself!  On the cover are 8 poker chips, two of them enticingly and realisticly embossed. Portraits of 6 of the leading players, (all in very character-revealing poses), are pictured.  The one in the top left -- of Woody Harrolson -- is, really, pricelessly funny -- funnier than most of the entire movie, in fact!  Jack Faro's devil-may-care attitude towards life -- shown by his semi-cowboy shaped straw hat, his long hair, and his face which seems not to have been shaved that day -- is in stark contrast with his attitude: he is obviously concentrating on his cards with all the seriousness of a diplomat, scrutinzing a peace treaty to see that his side is fairly treated!  Mr. Harrolson is also pictured on the back of the packaging, in the middle of a poker-chip, as are other characters of the story.  Looking at them all, one wishes again and again that these good actors had had more of a story to display their talents!

This DVD also includes extras: deleted scenes, alternate endings, profiles of the actors, audio commentary with the writers and directors, and selected scene commentaries.  If you want to see these extras, I suggest you watch them BEFORE you attempt to view the main movie.  Because after watching this movie, you will feel you have totally wasted your time, and not wish to waste any more of it, by looking at these ""extras"",  Sadly, one cannot call this movie, ""Grand"".  It is far more like a house of cards!",1215734400,4,4775,4.853086419753087

this film has  a great cast of actors ( Jason Alexander, David Cross, Dennis Farina, Woody Harrelson, Gabe Kaplan, Richard Kind, , Michael McKean, Ray Romano, Chris Parnell, and Cheryl Hines) . All handle the improv with ease.

I don't want to be revealing of the plots, but this is an actor's films that works.

3105361,2,B0013ERFFU,"While I had not previously heard of The Grand, I was impressed by the cast - Jason Alexander, Ray Romano, Dennis Farina and, Woody Harrelson to name a few.  After watching the preview on the product page, I thought this was a shoe in for an evening of laughs.  Well, they say that the distance between theory and practice is shorter in theory than it is in practice...

The problem with The Grand is not the cast.  Believe me they put in a truly valiant effort to save poorly conceived and written script.  Part of the problem is the format of the movie, or should I say formats?  The film is centered on the $10 million poker tournament known as The Grand.  The movie starts with the backstory for the six contestants that wind up at the final table for the tournament.  The transitions between character stories are abrupt and keep the movie from establishing a natural flow early on.  The remainder of the film splits between the tournament action and ""announcer commentary"" along with additional backstory and outside events.  Just when you get into the flow of the poker action the viewer is smacked upside the head with a hard left into backstory.  It creates a very choppy experience.  One would hope that the flow of the movie would be offset by some great one liners and laugh out loud moments.  Sadly the rare moments I would myself laughing were out of disbelief at how utterly stupid something was.  At these moments I would look over at my wife and see that she was merely shaking her head.  Finally, this is all packaged with a fairly low production quality.  While we aren't talking about The Blair Witch Project, the picture and sound are not on par with what you would see from a big time movie either.

Overall recommendation:  Skip this one",1215561600,4,1759,4.565495207667731
3105362,1,B0013ERFFU,"I love watching the World Series of Poker on ESPN.  I try to catch at least some of the championship rounds every year; so much so that I recognize many of the pros now.  So, I thought a movie with that basis would be fun. Unfortunately, this wasn't.

This movie was incredibly slow; in fact, we finally turned it off 45 minutes in. There was very little plot, or motivation.  While I'm sure most professional poker players only play for the love of the game and the money, I didn't even get that from the players in this film. Casino owner wants to win the jackpot to buy back his casino.  I'm supposed to care, why?  I think this movie would have been better if there was more actual poker playing and less ""character development."" The little cut scenes about the characters and their families that were supposed to resemble the personal bits in championships were just annoying and silly. I enjoy the World Series of Poker for the strategy, for the tension between the players, for the energy...this movie has NONE of that. And since you know it's fake, you can't even drum up any suspense for the jackpot.

I'm guessing this was supposed to be funny, but all it had were bad stereotypes. You have the statistics genius who has horrible social problems and lives at home with his mother. There's the internet player that has no idea how to play poker, but is very lucky. The drug-addict casino owner, the punk mother with a mouth full of foul language, the old-timer who reminisces about how much Vegas has changed...it goes on.  They took every one of the ""pros"" from the real world, magnified them tenfold and through them into this movie.  On the surface, you'd think ""spoofing"" the real poker stars would work.  But this wasn't really a spoof and you know these are actors, and they aren't nearly as funny as a real life person who's an a@@ at the poker table!  Or knowing he's losing money on the blinds because he's been sent to the sidelines for 10 minutes for swearing.

I would only recommend this to die-hard fans of the actors in it.  Poker fans should check out the classic poker film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rounders-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002DRDB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rounders (Collector's Edition)</a>.

3105363,2,B0013ERFFU,"This film had its moments of humor, but they were few and far between, and likely as not to be found in one of the deleted scenes or character profiles. In fact, some of the funniest bits are with the real-world poker stars who make cameo appearances in the film.

The story centers on a $10 million poker tournament called The Grand (hence the name of the movie). The film was made on location in the old section of Las Vegas, in and around the Golden Nugget. Woody Harrelson is the main character in the movie and the only one in the tournament who is trying to win for semi-altruistic reasons. A heavy drug and alcohol abuser, who has lived in a rehab center for several years, he wants to buy back the casino he inherited from his dead uncle and then lost through various combinations of substance abuse and stupid decisions.

Of all the main characters, Woody Harrelson is perhaps the most likable, with Dennis Farina taking a close second place. Richard Kind's character is funny at first, but he quickly gets annoying and you find yourself glad when he makes his exit. The rest of the crew is a combination of mean and/or pathetic in different amounts.

The film is somewhat educational in that, if you know nothing about poker, you'll learn a few terms and some of the techniques employed by professional players. It is also good in that it doesn't really glamorize gambling, as the players are generally pathetic losers, each with their own crippling idiosyncrasies and lack of social skills. Harrelson's substance abuse is likewise portrayed in a pathetic light - he only manages to pass out in his hotel room after his ""bender"".

There are some small attempts at promoting familial reconciliation, but the people involved are so pathetic and mean spirited that it is more of a disappointment than heartwarming.

If someone is really into poker and/or thinks that cut-downs and insults are the height of humor, they would probably really enjoy this movie. If someone is a huge Woody Harrelson fan, or a fan of one of the other stars in the movie, they would likewise probably enjoy this movie. At Amazon's current price of $10, you can probably take a chance and see if it is for you, but you're likely to find this one for $5 or less in a bargain bin somewhere within a couple of months.",1215475200,6,2298,4.622549019607843
3105364,4,B0013ERFFU,"""The Grand Championship of Poker"", held at the Golden Nugget Hotel in Las Vegas, furnishes the backdrop for this cleverly constructed mockumentary that will please aficionados of the card game, although viewers not conversant with the rules of poker will understandably be more interested in the personalities involved, thanks to the able leadership of director Zak Penn, who provides his cast with only a briefly outlined scenario from which to work.  This, then, is primarily an improvisational work, with the actors representing actual well-known poker tournament contestants, all the while not themselves knowing the film's outcome, since they are engaged in ongoing competition with highly proficient professionals, contending for a winner-take-all prize of $10 million.  Resourceful editing is the determinant to success for an episodic affair of this sort, and that duty is capably handled by Abby Schwarzwalder, being of particular value during the production's earlier segments, when a wide range of defined character types is created by director Penn.  The film loses much of its impact during its lattermost sequences as a result of poker jargon being extensively utilized, and probably not comprehensible to a good many viewers. The Anchor Bay DVD release enjoys outstanding audio and visual quality and offers a liberal number of interesting extra features.  These include: a brace of alternate endings; some truly comedic deleted scenes that have optional commentary by Penn, writer/executive producer Matt Bierman, and actor Michael Karnow; ""Wild Cards"" - a goodly amount of footage that profiles major players along with some cameo roles; a full-length audio commentary with Penn, Bierman and Karnow, marked by the director's efforts to keep the other two focussed upon the film; and a substantial group of selected scene commentaries with Penn and Woody Harrelson, in addition to one with the director and players Cheryl Hines and Ray Romano.  From among a large collection of talented performers we may enjoy some excellent turns, acting honours going to Chris Parnell as a social misfit who is also a genius at poker.  These extras, taken together, will comprise the principal reason for a majority of those who are not fans of poker playing to acquire this work, their entertainment value offsetting any constraints caused by a self-destructing effect fashioned from the game's usage of poker nomenclature, a failing that will leave many viewers adrift.",1215302400,3,2473,5.41038961038961
3105365,2,B0013ERFFU,"I usually enjoy ensemble comedies, but not this one. It started out hopeful with Woody Harrelson really doing some funny lines as a recovering addict (such a bad addict he LIVES at a drug rehab full time), who, while on a binge, takes out a loan on his grandfather's casino with a land developer (Micheal McKean). Woody checks out of rehab to join a poker game called "" The Grand"", in hopes of paying off the loan and getting his casino back. The movie just goes down in a BORING ball of flames at this time. I had to FORCE myself to finish watching it. I won't give away the ending, but it ended okay in a BORING way.
I don't recommend this comedy, which is sad, because there are some really good actors in this movie. Just not an entertaining movie.",1215129600,4,752,4.302816901408451
3105366,2,B0013ERFFU,It comes close to being a waste of resources.  A lot of plastic was used unnecessarily to do this movie.  Slow and boring are a bit understated but I know of no words that sound worse or more informative.  The acting was stiff and almost unnatural.  It is a shame that some folks are going to think that this is the way to play polka.  Perhaps this is the way to dance the polka but certainly not the way to play it.  This was a movie that you did not push the pause button.  You simply went to the fridge to get your icecream and come back when you were ready but hoping that the movie would be over and low and behold - it was not.,1215043200,6,633,3.937007874015748
3105367,1,B0013ERFFU,"""The Grand"" starts off with an amazing lack of humor, especially considering how hard it tries.  Woody Harrelson as one-eyed Jack Faro is probably a take-off on Johnny Depp's role as one-eyed Jack Sparrow.  It's not funny.  The film centers on Faro's drug and alcohol addiction that have left him close to losing the family business, a gambling casino called the Rabbit's Foot.  That's not funny.  Cheryl Hines who was nominated for an Emmy for ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" in 2005 plays gambling whiz Lainie Schwartzman.  She's not easy to like, constantly complaining.  One wonders what the attraction is with her husband played by Ray Romano.  David Cross plays Lainie's gambling brother.  He's obnoxious, a loser, and completely self-centered.  Dennis Farina as L.B.J. Deuce Fairbanks plays a gambler who treats everybody badly.  Richard Kind plays Andy Andrews, a bumbling amateur who by sheer luck makes it to the finals.  Chris Parnell from ""Saturday Night Live"" plays the stone-faced Harold Melvin whose lack of emotion is something we're supposed to find funny.  Director Werner Herzog who won a Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1982 for ""Fitzcaraldo"" plays the German who likes to kill animals.  Michael McKean who was Lenny on ""Laverne & Shirley"" plays the ruthless rich guy trying to foreclose on The Rabbit's Foot.  The scenes are improvised and mostly don't work.  The climax comes more as relief that the film will finally be over than as an exciting conclusion.  This film didn't work on so many levels for me.  It wasn't funny.  While the actors did what they were supposed to do, none of the characters were interesting or someone for whom you could cheer.  Director Zak Penn has done a lot of work in the industry such as writing ""The Incredible Hulk,"" but this was not the project for which he'll be remembered.  Taxi!",1215043200,4,1850,4.922330097087379
3105368,3,B0013ERFFU,"I cannot believe I watched this the night before the world series of poker finals in Vegas.  Hearing the back and forth between the players actually made me understand what the movie was attempting to say and how it was attempting to say it.  Also, a man was hit by lightning the day following watching the movie and had a burn mark in his baseball cap to prove it.

Ray Ramano's character was apparently hit by lightning a few years back so he is a little off and he shows his baseball cap to prove where he was hit.  So, did the person above just follow the movie as a hoax or what?

Well, the subtitle ""A Comedy About the Fine Art of Losing,"" really is where the movie is headed from the beginning.  Here we have six losers, two from the same family, who are destined to be on the last table at ""The Grand.""  Basically, the world series of poker.  We go through the lives of each of the characters, so the film is very slow in developing as we see the lives of each.  Once we get to the big poker game, things pick up a bit and the back and forth between the characters is a bit funny.  Some of the humor is a bit gross, so there are scenes definately not for kids.  The back and forth of the announcers of the event is really one of the best parts of the film.

There are definately some great talent too.  Ramano does a good job.  Jason Alexander is a bit funny, but a little off and well too short of a time in the film.  He is facing off with Woody Harrelson, so you have two big players with a ton of potential.  Gabe Kaplan is superb.  It was great to see him again and his playing the dad of a set of twins, identical (really, a boy and a girl being identical????), where they keep fighting all the time.

The movie is billed as one of the greatest collection of comedians in decades, I think Rat Race could be billed as that actually.

What could have been done for improving it is starting off with the final table and where they are when they are there, then flashing back to the beginning of the tourny with each of the focused characters including the finalists, being focused on.  Maybe a split screen with them betting and playing while there is discussion of their life history, or whatever as they approach the tournament.  The movie is slow enough in places where you could have had moved to split and four way shots (ala Time Code). which would have made the movie more appealing and upbeat.

In the end though, listening to and seeing the conversation and conduct of some at the Poker championship, really, they nailed the characters, people who have rough edges, competing for money in a poker game that is nationally recognized.  Fun for some, and a little rough on the edges.  For those who like poker, it should be a fun romp.  More focus on the game would have brought the game to more people.",1214956800,2,2820,4.2556390977443606
3339807,4,B0013ERFFU,"Okay, so Christopher Guest only makes a movie every three or four years, and For Your Consideration was not up to snuff: The Grand is in the fine mockumentary tradition started by the funniest film ever (AFI rating) ""This Is Spinal Tap."" The Grand is in the same vein as Best In Show, following disparate wacky characters in a contest, interspersed with interviews. It does not feel improvised, like the best Guest films and TIST--more scripted like The Office. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is very amusing--no gross-out bathroom jokes, not cheap-shot sophomoric humor; instead, well-crafted  (appropriately exaggerated) characterizations. Druggie Woody Harrelson has been living in a rehab facility for the past two years b/c it was easier than constantly readmitting him. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins in TIST) plays a Donald Trump type real estate mogul trying to buy out Woody's Las Vegas casino, the site of the Grand poker tournament (winner-take-all prize $100 MM). Various competitors include filmmaker Werner Herzog as The German, a rodent-killing sociopath, Dennis Farina as a Rat Pack style Old School Vegas guy, David Cross as the loser acting-out brother of Cheryl Hines, a Poker Mom. The Announcers are poor imitations of Fred Willard's Best in Show tour de force, but there are several clever products mentioned that are worth replaying to read all the stuff written on the boxes.
Bottom line: if you like the Guest films, The Office, and This is Spinal Tap, give this a try.",1214956800,2,1503,5.109756097560975
3339808,4,B0013ERFFU,"I don't know much beyond the basics about the game of poker.  I usually flip right past those poker tournaments that are always being shown on cable these days - although, after watching this movie, I think I'll be more inclined to put down the remote and stop to watch them from now on.  This movie is a very well-edited mix of written dialogue and (more) actor improvisation that surprisingly works most of the time.  There are a few parts, mostly involving Woody Harrelson's character, that are a little over-the-top.  However, even those are pretty funny in context.  Most of the actors (except one) are pretty serious poker players in real life, so they were able to get completely into their parts.  In fact, the climactic final round of the tournament was staged as a REAL game between the actors where the director and producer actually did NOT KNOW who was going to win.  Because of that, they pre-shot different versions of some of the post-tournament scenes because some actors had to leave early and they didn't know in advance which ending they'd need to use.  The unused scenes show up as extras on the dvd.  Because they were playing for real, the final showdown between Woody Harrelson and Cheryl Hines was a huge shock for both the actors and the audience.  It was great to see the genuine surprise on their faces, rather than to see them ""acting"" surprised.  So, I recommend the movie itself quite highly.  However, as a bonus, this dvd also has one of the most informative and entertaining commentary tracks I've heard with a movie.  Usually, directors drone on and on about camera angles and lighting.  These guys just let loose with anecdotes about every interesting thing that happened while they were making the movie, and it is as entertaining as the movie itself.  This one's a keeper.",1214784000,4,1810,4.738019169329074

Such people are often flamboyant odd balls, willing to do almost anything to have the edge over the competition. This movie makes you feel like you know them up close, and yet are sympathetic to their oddities.

The cast of the Grand (the name of the champioship) is an impressive group of well-known comedians and character actors, including Ray Romano and Jason Alexander, among many others.  It is fast paced and interesting.

You'll like this movie if you play cards and/or you already like any of the actors. You won't cry laughing but you also won't roll your eyes at some stupid joke(s).

Not bad for Zakk Penn's debut as writer and director. He's pretty much written most of Marvel's back catalog of superhero films--X-Men, etc...

3339811,1,B0013ERFFU,"I like playing poker, but very few films can take a card game and turn it into something that will hold your attention for an hour or more.  Sadly, neither my husband nor I enjoyed ""The Grand"" and for once, we're both in agreement on a star rating.

The idea behind ""The Grand"" is to turn a poker tournment into something of a reality show with game play interspersed between character commentary. Writer Zak Penn's script is really only about 29 pages long, so the cast is doing a lot of improv.

""The Grand"" follows six players as they compete in a $2,000,000 pot Texas Hold'em tournament in Vegas.

Woody Harrelson is Jack Faro. He is a lifetime drug abuser (he's tried everything you can smoke and snort) who has inherited the ""Rabbit's Foot Casino"" from his grandfather. If he doesn't win the tournament, he's going to lose the casino.

Plus there are the twins:  Lainie and Larry Schwartzman. Laine (Cheryl Hines) is a Mom who works to support her family playing poker.  Her husband is a fantasy football junkie who she wishes would find 'something else.'

Larry Schzartzman (David Cross) is a single man who's known for his obnoxious behavior at the table.

Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell) is a statistics savant with what I suspect is a massive case of Aspergers. He still lives with his Mom, who is about the only person he can (barely) stand.

Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina) is a politically-incorrect old geezer who has been on the circuit for years and will cheerfully bemoan what has become of the game to anyone who's foolish enough to listen.

Andy Andrews (Richard Kind) is a newbie who knows nothing about poker, but by sheer luck has won a chair in the tournament.

You also have a huge supporting cast of actors and real poker players. My problem was, there wasn't a single player in the tournament who I could cheer for. Worse, when the announcer mis-called a hand, I was pretty much ready to fold on the film myself.

I've enjoyed several gambling films, including ""Maverick"" and ""Rounders"", but ""The Grand"" failed to live up to my expectations.  Thanks, I'd rather spend an hour and a half playing penny ante and experience the thrill first hand.

3339825,2,B0013ERFFU,"As you can see, I did buy the DVD for this movie and it's not worth the $3 I paid for it.

I didn't find this movie that good. It starts off very slow and the drags a lot by showing and introduction of these 6 main players. These 6 people are for the final poker table for The Grand. They all have their own story to tell and they take awhile telling it. Also, they follow each character around after their poker matches, and this slows down the movie even more. In fact, it's take up more 80% to 90% of the movie. Everything else after that is just them at the final table and finishing up the movie. BTW, this is the only real poker scene in the whole movie. Everything is just a back story of more back stories.

So, what we got here is one back story after another and it's so boring. This really slow down the peace of the movie and bores the audience to death. If they wanted to do characters development, they needed to do that some other way, where the movie itself isn't killing itself slowly by not just going to the next back story.

People say this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but it's just below average slap-stick film. The jokes involve the ""Real"" Poker Players' stories and they take that and then mix it with the main characters' stories. All of them main characters represent real life poker players' and so of the stories can be funny and some are not funny.

An example of what I'm talking about is the Unabomber Phil Laak. He is known for taking his hood and wrapping it around his head with his sun-glasses on. This makes him look like the Unabomber. Well, in this movie, you see that, and then you see another main cast member. He'll take a knight's helmet and puts that on, then, he'll shuts the lid looking at Phil Laak. If you think that's funny, that's about the funniest thing in the movie and you don't need to watch it now. All the jokes after that is sup-par and won't make you laugh after that. I can't even remember the rest of the jokes because they just didn't make me laugh or were memorable.

If you do manage to get the DVD, you might be interested in the movie because it does have two more alternative endings. They do not make the movie any better, but it does let people know what the writers thought what else could work as the ending. In the end, yes, the movie chose the correct ending for the movie because the others would open up more questions and they would need to do more stuff to finish the movie.

The DVD also has extra scenes to the movie, but they do not make the movie any better. In fact, they should be extra scenes because if they actually left those scenes in their, it will even make a worse movie, even more boring.

The DVD also has one more section for extra scenes for each main character. They are not worth the time to even watching. They add nothing!!!

I only recommend this movie if you want to see a lot of famous poker faces in the movie. They don't do much in the movie as they are just making cameos. You won't even see them play poker, they just are there and you see them. Also, don't watch this if you want to see good poker plays, moves, or strategy.

3339829,3,B0013ERFFU,"The Grand (Zak Penn, 2007)

It is damned tough to make a good movie about poker. Many have tried since the poker boom hit. None have succeeded; the only truly great poker movie, Rounders, was made five years before that. But that doesn't stop folks from trying, and let's be honest--while a poker player is going to be able to comment on the ridiculousness of the final hands in movies like The Cincinnati Kid, Maverick, or (the worst case of poker egregiousness in history, to date) Casino Royale, maybe the general public won't notice. Or, at least, that's what I'm figuring the writers of these movies say to themselves when trying to pitch themselves on writing scenes that require one's suspension of disbelief to stretch farther than the Overseas Highway. The Grand's isn't quite that bad, but the errors that plague the movie's poker are of the even-more-egregious variety, and Penn and co-writer Matt Bierman decided to try to pair the poker movie (already an ill-fated venture) with the improv comedy movie. That as much of it succeeds as it does is a minor miracle.

Plot: One Eyed Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson) is the wastrel son of a casino owner who finds himself in desperate need of cash to save the family legacy, which a robber baron (Michael McKean) wants to buy and turn into a million-dollar-per-night hotel/entertainment extravaganza. Thus, he does what any enterprising young man in need of cash would do--enter a major poker tournament that will win him enough money to pay off the casino's debts, as long as he can outlast such poker-playing lights as Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina), Lainie Schwartzman (The Ugly Truth's Cheryl Hines), Fred Marsh (Ray Romano), Yakov Achmed (Jason Alexander), Reggie Marshall (Mike Epps), and the mysterious player known only as The German (Werner Herzog in a rare trip in front of the camera), along with a few other guys you may have heard of like Doyle Brunson, Daniel Negreanu, Phil Laak, Phil Hellmuth...

When the movie stays on point, it's quick, it's funny, and as long as the writers aren't attempting poker analysis, it's reasonably intelligent. The poker profiles, a la the WSOP filler material on ESPN, range from the amusing (Ray Romano's skit) to the downright hilarious (every time the Schwartzmans are onscreen). Michael McKean, as usual, is gold every time he gets in front of a camera.

And then there are the downsides, which start with every time the movie attempts to show poker being played. I'm amazed Phil Gordon, who plays the poker commentator announcing the tournament for TV, didn't smack people upside the head with the script for all the stupidity they send spewing out of his mouth. The improv comedy bits... well, some of them work (see previous bit about the Schwartzmans), but most fall flat; the only other character who really works 100% of the time is The German, and that's because Herzog plays him straight, with an air of menace that does not fit at all with this movie, and yet it works. Which should be an indicator right there that something is failing, but somehow it didn't raise any alarm bells.

Short answer: if you're in the mood for a poker movie and you've watched everything else on the subject you own, give this a go. The parts that work make it worth your time, and hey, it's a helluva lot better than Lucky You. ** ",1357430400,,3327,4.797556719022688

3339831,3,B0013ERFFU,"This is a fairly plot-less quirky movie about a poker tournament. The film gives you the background of a number of fictional players, and then you watch them play cards and interact. THE PLAYERS:

""One Eye"" Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson)- Has spent his last 2 years in rehab. Has never met a girl he didn't marry or a drug he didn't like. Wants to save the casino he inherited.

Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell)- He is a math nerd who his heavily into ""Dune"". Lives at home with his mother (Estelle Harris)....by will alone.

Laine Schwartzman (Cheryl Hines)She is from Long Island and has always been her Dad's (Gabe Kaplain) favorite. She is married to Fred (Ray Romano ) who has been hit by lightning and is not all together, but is functional. He likes to make up handshakes and sayings.

Lanny Schwartzman- (David Cross) The nerdy brother of Laine. She always beat him at games as a child. Nobody beats her at Candyland...ask her kids.

Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina)- Old time poker gambler.

The German (Werner Herzog)- He is also an old time gambler. He enjoys all kinds of gambling and killing small animals.

Andy Andrew (Richard Kind)- He is the new breed of Internet gambler, a math teacher from Wisconsin. His wife Sharon (Judy Greer ) owns the finest ribbon shop in Dour Wisconsin.

The movie is hit and miss. If you are into the characters, you will find a film worthy of a view. If not, you will be bored to tears. It is difficult to determine that before you watch it. I like Woody, so for me it was an easy choice.

3339835,3,B0013ERFFU,"The Grand is a mockumentary that lacks Chris Guest's magic touch, but does have its moments. It's a lampoon of an easy target: poker and the selling of it and the WSOP on tv. The subject needs little tinkering to be funny/ stupid: the real shows are such hymns to greed and selfishness that one need add little.

The highlights here are a few of the actors, specifically Chris Parnell as the internet poker geek, Herzog as The German (playing into type, perhaps), McKean as Steve Lavisch (clearly based on Steve Wynn), and a few of the others at moments. Woody is good enough as a Ted Binion-type, and David Cross is a humorous cross between Howard Lederer and Phil Hellmuth (now there's an unholy union), with Cheryl Hines as his Annie Duke-ish sister. Any poker fan will recognize the references, but will probably also wonder why this isn't quite as funny as it should have been.

Director Penn has his concept right but never delivers in full; there are laughs but many are forced. My favorite line is Cross' ""Is that Rush?"", and one guesses it was an improv, like much of this. But where Guest has an ensemble that can ad lib with genius, only Cross and McKean can do it at that level here. And seeing as McKean is in all of Guest's movies, I'd recommend all of those before this.

Nonetheless, if you've played cards much or watched the WSOP on the tube, you're bound to enjoy some of The Grand. But if you're not a poker fan, there will be precious little for you here. Not to worry; you'll see many worse rivers than that as life plays out.",1270598400,,1548,4.443661971830986

The film is well made, and the actors are given room to improvise which makes the comedy seem fresher. If you liked 'Best in Show', you'll like 'The Grand'.",1260835200,,457,4.4523809523809526
3339837,3,B0013ERFFU,"Borrowing the basic structure and  plot of Christopher Guest's 'Best in Show', 'The Grand' is an improvised, ensemble driven comedy that follows a group of crazy competitors playing for big bucks in a poker tournament. The six featured  players include : Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson), a  drug addict who has been married as many times as he has failed rehab. His uncle left him his casino before he died but Jack lost it to a greedy developer (Guest regular Michael McKean) who plans on tearing it down and building a giant hotel with one room. Jack hopes to win enough money to save his uncle's legacy. Deuce Fairbanks (Dennis Farina) is old school Vegas who fondly remembers the kneecapping days as he zips around the casino on his scooter complete with a bottle of scotch and vanity license plate.  Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell) is a nutcase who lives with his mom. An Internet player he's  constantly chugging a dark concoction  dubbed ""brain juice"" that his mother prepares for him daily.  Andy Andrews (Richard Kind) is a lovable doofus who  stumbled on a pro poker site while looking for antique fireplace pokers. Before he knew it he'd  won the qualifying round and landed himself a seat at the Grand. The German (Werner Herzog) is a scary dude who arrives at the hotel with a luggage cart full of live rabbits. In the next scene he's shown gently petting one of the rabbits before admitting that he calms his nerves by killing something every day. Rounding out the field of players are brother and sister team Larry and Lanie Schwartzman (David Cross and Cheryl Hines). Raised by a competitive father (Gabe Kaplan), Larry has had to watch as Lanie has had more success than him and he burns silently each time his father shows up to their matches holding a sign for her. She is married to a lightning survivor (Ray Romano) whom she doesn't take seriously. There are too many characters and while the film has some funny moments many of them could have been eliminated. This would have freed up more screen time for people like Kind and Herzog. Both Parnell and Hines were hilarious on  T.V.  but it doesn't translate as well on  the big screen. The Parnell character stops the movie dead in it's tracks and should have been cut entirely. Harrelson is decent in the lead but he has a few too many slurred speeches at the main table. The poker action isn't too exciting and not enough real life pros figure into the movie. With that being said there is a priceless scene between Kind and poker legends Doyle Brunson and Phil Hellmuth. David Cross is his usual crazy/brilliant self and him and Gabe Kaplan have some funny and touching scenes together. Herzog is a blast as a man reduced to wandering the halls searching for his rabbit that ran away.

A game, eclectic cast - Woody Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Chris Parnell, Ray Romano, Werner Herzog, Gabe Kaplan - struggles with a mediocre script that, in tone as well as in style, steals clumsily from all those far superior Christopher Guest movies like ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind.""  In the case of ""The Grand,"" the humor is largely lacking, as each eccentric character plays out his little assigned shtick over and over and over again.

As executed by writer/director Zak Penn, the poker scenes are particularly languid and lifeless and utterly incomprehensible to any non-poker players who may happen to be a part of the audience.",1226534400,,795,5.0534351145038165

And seeing the cast of well-known actors (Woody Harrelson, Ray Romano, Cheryl Hines), I didn't have a good feeling about it. It's been my experience these are typically flops if I've never even heard of them.

My presumption turned out to be largely correct. ""The Grand"" is cut from the same cloth as ""Best In Show"", ""Spinal Tap"" and the like, and in fact includes many of the same actors tha that you'd expect for what seems like the loosely-scripted genre that included Cheryl Hines (""Curb Your Enthisasm"") and Michael McKean (who is in most of the Christopher Guest mockumentaries).

There are lots of familiar faces in this movie. David Cross (Arrested Development), Gabe Kaplan (Welcome Back, Kotter), Chris Parnell (Saturday Night Live), Dennis Farina, Estelle Harris. The actors all do a decent job but there just isn't much material to work with.

I do have one caveat. Poker has become big business in the USA, and it may well be that I am just ""out of the loop"" in this area and don't understand the subtleties of the game. There are some cameos from real poker players in this movie, and in fact Gabe Kaplan (skin stretched too tight for his years) has been a prominent poker player for years.

Woody Harrelson (as Jack Faro) heads up an all-star ensemble as a drug-addled loser who has to take the big prize or he'll lose the casino his Grandfather left him. He has the part down as a discombobulated stoner whose multiple ex-wives keep dropping in. He's about the funniest thing here. The only other really interesting character is Cheryl Hines (as Lainie Schwartzman), who at least doesn't act like a cardboard cut-out (Dennis Farina, I'm looking at you).

There are also a ton of cameos, like Jason Alexander, Ray Romano, Hank Azaria, and Shannon Elizabeth. Real life Poker-Pros Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, and Phil Laak also make appearances, as well as filmmakers Brett Ratner and Werner Herzog (who puts in a goofy performance as a bunny loving ""The German""). But none of this jump starts. A few of the folks are genuinely annoying (although naming a soulless numbers geek Harold Melvin is a good joke) and I just wanted to smack Gabe Kaplan's ugly mug as the creepy, overbearing Dad to the Schwartzmann twins.

As for the acting, Cheryl Hines was good, I think her experience in Curb Your Enthusiasm was invaluable here. Woody Harrelson, well you would have to be a big fan to sit through this one.

Unfortunately, The Grand, while occasionally quite funny, is kind of a mess.

In The Grand, a movie about a high-stakes poker tournament, it seems like the director just gave the actors bare outlines of their characters and said ""do something funny."" The whole thing is a pretty clear attempt to make a movie like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-in-Show/dp/B00005ALS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best in Show</a>&nbsp;(Penn goes so far as to use Michael McKean in a small role), but the results just aren't as good.

The problem I often have with ensemble casts is that usually some of the performers are much better than others, but they all get about the same amount of screen time. In The Grand, Richard Kind, Chris Parnell, and Ray Romano seem to base their entire performances on one or two quirks, and really, they aren't very interesting. Werner Herzog, who I would probably watch reading the phone book, is criminally underutilized, and is essentially one joke that keeps repeating itself.  Woody Harrelson, David Cross, and Denis Farina all have some hilarious scenes, but they're few and far between.

The movie also features Celebrity Poker Tournament commentator Phil Gordon as...the tournament's commentator.

The biggest problem is that the movie is terribly lopsided.  The first half or so is pretty good, giving background on the players and showing them working their way toward the final, big-money game.  Unfortunately, once they get there, the movie slows to a crawl and the comedy mostly disappears.

Overall, The Grand is a really problematic movie with a few hilarious lines. For fans of Michael McKean's ensemble improv comedies, I'd suggest renting this one.  For others, I'd say skip it.",1219363200,,2410,6.278787878787878

I'm not a big fan of televised poker. It gives me that same feeling as when I flip the channel and find bowling. There's just not enough going on to keep my attention (Generation X). However after watching The Grand I might give it a chance on one of those evenings when nothing is on. Thanks to DVR that doesn't happen too often.

THE GRAND doesn't work because of its story, which is hardly worth mentioning.  I'll mention it anyway, since the rest of the review would make less sense if I didn't.  A collection of poker players with different motives and styles come together to compete for $10 million dollars.  (The ""grand"" of the title comes from the name of the tournament.)  There you go.  Now you're all caught up.

Much like Guest's films, plot takes a backseat to the characters who populate it.  These kinds of ensemble comedies are more about giving the actors/actresses a chance to have fun.  The actual script for this film was only about twenty-nine page long; the real treat to the flick is watching a dozen or more comedians at the top of their game bantering the way you'd expect them to if they were, say, playing poker together.

Of course, they stick to personas.  Ray Romano is the lightning-addled Fred Marsh, husband of Cheryl Hines' no-nonsense Lainie Schwartzman, sister to David Cross' overly competitive Larry.  Michael McKean, Woody Harrelson, Dennis Farina, Gabe Kaplan, Chris Parnell.  I could list all of the talent, but then I wouldn't have time to tell you how much I loved this film.

Okay, so I didn't love it.  It runs a little long, and some of the cameos are bewildering (Hank Azaria) and just plain bad (Jason Alexander).  Being a film buff, there were a few that I enjoyed on a rather obscure level (Are you ready for this one?

Yeah, so that's not what most are likely to get from the movie.  I'll just say that there are things that don't work (try as you might, watching poker is hardly ever what anyone would call funny), but many more things that do.  If you like even half of the names I've already mentioned, you can place odds you'll enjoy, on some level, this little film, even if it doesn't bother hiding any aces up its sleeves.",1216771200,,2991,5.906976744186046
3339849,3,B0013ERFFU,"There's enough funny material in THE GRAND to construct a really funny, sharp comedy film, if the feature were on the short side (say about an hour).  Unfortunately, the film as released runs a long one hundred and four minutes.  It's notoriously difficult to stretch a light, comedy movie for over an hour and a half, and despite possessing a lot of good things one could say about it, THE GRAND shows us why length can hurt.

The film starts with an entire tournament worth of poker players attempting to win a ten million dollar grand prize.  While eventually the cast is whittled down to six, many of the secondary characters get a fair amount of screen time.  The guy with the most compelling case for getting the money is Woody Harrelson (our protagonist), a man who is emerging from a two year stint in rehab and looking to win the money in order to keep his dead grandfather's casino financially afloat.

The cast is filled with a plethora of well-known actors and comedians.  So much so that it's more of a shock when a new character is introduced and one doesn't, in fact, recognize the actor or actress.  For the most part, the cast is uniformly good; even actors I don't usually care for did an admirable job.  Kudos to the rarely seen Gabe Kaplan who easily walks away with every scene he's in.

So it wouldn't be fair to point any fingers of blame for the film's woes in the direction of the actors.  The problems come mostly from the outline of the script and the pacing.  The film really starts to drag the farther along it goes.  This isn't helped by the fact that during the final third, the emphasis appears to move from telling jokes to concentrating on the outcome of the poker games.  I don't think this worked.  The poker stuff was fine when it was a stage for telling jokes, but I don't think it was developed enough for it to carry what nominally is a light and fun comedy.

A film of this length isn't helped by recurring jokes and situations that simply aren't funny.  You'll remember the funny announcers from BEST IN SHOW.  There is a similar gimmick here, but it lightning fails to strike twice.  Just because something was funny in a similar mockumentary, it doesn't follow that the same idea will work in a different film.

If you're a fan of any of the huge number of celebrities who appear, then you'll probably want to check it out.  And even if you aren't, this is still a film worth watching once.  The actors and comedians are all hugely funny.  Many of the one-liners and gags are simply great.  But there is some wasted potential here, which is a shame given the cast and the parts of the film that do succeed.",1216598400,,2650,4.461538461538462

Under the Special Features Section I noticed that there are ""Alternative Endings"" and ""Deleted Scenes"" listed. I can't imagine what scenes were deleted. I can only say that not eough were.

I always liked watching Woody Harrelson on ""Cheers,"" as the dumb bartender who got off good one-liners. He falls flat on his face here, however, as the gambler with 74 wives. If one of those is the runaway bride from the Atlanta area-- the photograph looks just like her with that wide-eyed stare-- then that is mildly amusing. But all the king's horses and all the king's men can't save this scrambled egg of a movie.

Walk your dog, play with your cat or treat youself to a good chocolate dessert but avoid this film at all costs unless you are certain you will live to see a hundred and have precious time to waste.",1216425600,3,966,4.331491712707182
3339851,3,B0013ERFFU,"The World Series of Poker on ESPN is a popular game show. This game has become increasingly popular on few other TV channels, and this movie capitalizes on this TV interest. The story revolves around Jack Faro (Woody Harrelson), a semi-rehabilitated gambler, womanizer and a serial groom, hopes to save his casino, left by his grandfather, by winning $10 million at The Grand Championship of Poker in Las Vegas. The field consists of six poker pundits and experts. Jason Alexander (TV series; Seinfeld), Ray Romano (TV Series; Everybody Loves Raymond), Gabe Kaplan (TV series; Welcome Back Kotter), Denis Farina, and Richard Kind (Spin City) star in this comedy directed by Zak Penn. The movie set in Vegas has plenty of inappropriate language, and it moves slowly; many times it is boring. At one instance the ghost of grandfather of Jack Faro appears for no apparent reason and then after a brief conversation disappears. There is no interesting plot or suspense, although I am a fan of Woody Harrelson, I will say that you could do without this movie.

3339852,4,B0013ERFFU,"A star-studded cast plays an oddball collection of poker players competing in the biggest game of their lives for a ten million dollar prize. Zak Penn's ""The Grand"" is a Christopher Guest-style improvisational mockumentary that sometimes slips outside of that style into regular movie mode and is not quite as marvelously entertaining as Guest's own work. Perhaps it can be blamed on the subject matter, but the humor here feels a bit darker, and not always in a good way, than the popular Guest mockumentaries, yet it's still got enough funny moments from a fantastic cast to make it worth watching. Probably even more enjoyable for the fan of real TV poker tournaments, this one is worth checking out if anything about it strikes your curiosity. It's nothing too outstanding, but it's worth at least one try. David Cross is hilarious as always, Ray Romano is classic Ray Romano, and Richard Kind is charming as ever. Chris Parnell's character also brings on some of the best moments. There are a ton of other stars in big and small roles, and a nice pile of DVD extras. There is an audio commentary, deleted scenes and alternate endings, the trailer and TV spot,  character profiles, and a great looking widescreen presentation.",1216252800,,1230,4.885167464114833
3339853,5,B0013ERFFU,"Some TV actors have big screen presence and others don't.  While Bruce Willis could make it as a big movie star, Tom Selleck could never really make the transition.  What happens when you take a whole bunch of small screen stars - almost none of whom have any major movie presence - into the same movie?  If it's The Grand, it winds up being pretty good.

The Grand is one of those mockumentaries a la This is Spinal Tap or Best in Show (and in fact, Michael McKean from those movies does appear in this one as well).  The backdrop in this case is the world of Championship Poker, where six will meet at the final table for a winner-take-all prize of $10,000,000.  These six are: (1) Woody Harrelson, the more-or-less central character, who is a fast-living partier who needs the money to save the casino he inherited; (2) Cheryl Hines as a mother of five married to Ray Romano and is the brother of (3) David Cross, whose style of play is to be as obnoxious as possible; (4) Richard Kind as the amateur who somehow has made it further than he ever should have; (5) Dennis Farina as the old-school player who bemoans the old days in Vegas; and (6) Chris Parnell as the weird mathematical genius.  A number of other TV stars also appear, including Hank Azaria, Jason Alexander and Gabe Kaplan, as well as some real poker players.

I went into this movie not expecting much and pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  In fact, compared to the other poker movies I've seen, The Grand more than holds its own, with the right amount of humor against a setting that feels like a real poker tournament.  If you're a fan of the game or just comedies in general, this is a nice movie to see.",1215907200,,1684,4.403225806451613

Did they not grasp the concept that this film is strictly a comedy that pokes fun at poker tournaments?  If you go into this film knowing that it is a comedy then you will enjoy it.  I laughed so hard at some points I had tears in my eyes.  So did my friend whom I watched it with.  We had to pause and rewind a few scenes too because we were laughing so hard.

3339855,2,B0013ERFFU,"Let me prefice this review by saying I enjoy watching the world Series of Poker on ESPN. I have followed it for several years, so I was anxious to watch this movie.

However, what came across as an interesting concept quickly turns into ""Who will have the next cameo"". There are several times in the movie where I felt the plot took a backseat to getting someone screen time.

This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but the only thing to laugh at is the poor plot. I can not believe this movie was able to get the star power in it. Not even a high rolling cast of actors could save this terrible story.

I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more poker and less filler and uninteresting plot lines.

In the end, this is no where near the quality of movie I Was hoping it would be. If you are looking for a poker-ish movie watch Rounders or 21. Skip this one all together and save yourself the time.",1215820800,2,905,4.154285714285714
3339856,1,B0013ERFFU,"I really looked forward to watching this movie.  It seemed an interesting premise: a man, (""Jack Faro"", played by WOODY HARRELSON),
wants to save the large, Las Vegas Casio-Hotel which he inherited from his grandfather, (the casino's builder), from a greedy developer.  To do so, he must enter a Poker Tournament, and win the winner-take-all ten million dollar prize.  He must play against an assortment of other players -- a housewife, an old-time gambler, a computer genuis, an amateur who has practiced online, and other assorted gamblers.

If this movie were written well, it would be an insight into human beings and human nature.  As a comedy, (which this movie purports to be), it would also be funny and enjoyable to watch.  But this movie is not funny, and tells little of real human nature.  It is not a comedy -- at least, I found nothing funny in it, except for two small jokes, at the beginning of the movie, when Jack Faro has a conversation with a barmaid.....

What this movie is, is a film full of is a story that drags on and on, and on and on, and on, and.....on....and...on.... with bad writing -- and even worse language.  I'm not a fan of four-letter words, but have
still liked some movies, (""Love Story"", and ""The Blair Witch Project""), which included them.  These two movies had GOOD WRITING, and AN EXCITING STORY, which, sadly, ""THE GRAND"" does not.  Four-letter and slang words, in these two movies, were used at appropriate times.  In ""The Grand"", they are, most of the time, just put in for shock value.

The writers of this movie MUST have written better movies. (No-one could continually write movies of this calibre and have them released, could they?)  This movie, unfortunately, belongs to a type of movie which I once saw categorized as: ""It wasn't released. It escaped!)  One thing I will say: they are equal-opportunity stereotypers!
Germans, Jews, (of both the secular and religious variety), Arabs, cross-dressers, adult children who live with their parents, (and those parents),
old-time gamblers, handicapped people....all are stereotyped here, presumably for a ""laugh"" value....but I found myself groaning instead.

The acting isn't half-bad, the directing is quite good, and the music is tuneful and appropriate.  The costuming, lighting, and camera-work are OK as well.  It's also nice to see real-life Las Vegas locations, (the movie was filmed at the Golden Nugget Casino-Hotel in Las Vegas)  -- but NOTHING, nothing at all, can ever save any movie with as terrible a script and story as this one has ):  it's really too bad -- because handled differently, this could have made an interesting, involving, and funny movie.....

The poker scenes are exciting.  I wish there were more of them!  Seeing GABE KAPLAN -- who once starred in ""Welcome Back, Kotter"", and is now a real-life professional poker player -- was a treat! It would have been nice, as well, amidst the poker tournament, to have these poker players interact with players of other table games -- roulette, blackjack, dice -- and one could have seen the different types of personalities which are drawn to each these different games....  But only poker players -- and more accurately, stereotypes, (and unfunny stereotypes, at that), of poker players, are seen here.

The packaging for this DVD is far better than the movie itself!  On the cover are 8 poker chips, two of them enticingly and realisticly embossed. Portraits of 6 of the leading players, (all in very character-revealing poses), are pictured.  The one in the top left -- of Woody Harrolson -- is, really, pricelessly funny -- funnier than most of the entire movie, in fact!  Jack Faro's devil-may-care attitude towards life -- shown by his semi-cowboy shaped straw hat, his long hair, and his face which seems not to have been shaved that day -- is in stark contrast with his attitude: he is obviously concentrating on his cards with all the seriousness of a diplomat, scrutinzing a peace treaty to see that his side is fairly treated!  Mr. Harrolson is also pictured on the back of the packaging, in the middle of a poker-chip, as are other characters of the story.  Looking at them all, one wishes again and again that these good actors had had more of a story to display their talents!

This DVD also includes extras: deleted scenes, alternate endings, profiles of the actors, audio commentary with the writers and directors, and selected scene commentaries.  If you want to see these extras, I suggest you watch them BEFORE you attempt to view the main movie.  Because after watching this movie, you will feel you have totally wasted your time, and not wish to waste any more of it, by looking at these ""extras"",  Sadly, one cannot call this movie, ""Grand"".  It is far more like a house of cards!",1215734400,4,4775,4.853086419753087

3339858,2,B0013ERFFU,"While I had not previously heard of The Grand, I was impressed by the cast - Jason Alexander, Ray Romano, Dennis Farina and, Woody Harrelson to name a few.  After watching the preview on the product page, I thought this was a shoe in for an evening of laughs.  Well, they say that the distance between theory and practice is shorter in theory than it is in practice...

The problem with The Grand is not the cast.  Believe me they put in a truly valiant effort to save poorly conceived and written script.  Part of the problem is the format of the movie, or should I say formats?  The film is centered on the $10 million poker tournament known as The Grand.  The movie starts with the backstory for the six contestants that wind up at the final table for the tournament.  The transitions between character stories are abrupt and keep the movie from establishing a natural flow early on.  The remainder of the film splits between the tournament action and ""announcer commentary"" along with additional backstory and outside events.  Just when you get into the flow of the poker action the viewer is smacked upside the head with a hard left into backstory.  It creates a very choppy experience.  One would hope that the flow of the movie would be offset by some great one liners and laugh out loud moments.  Sadly the rare moments I would myself laughing were out of disbelief at how utterly stupid something was.  At these moments I would look over at my wife and see that she was merely shaking her head.  Finally, this is all packaged with a fairly low production quality.  While we aren't talking about The Blair Witch Project, the picture and sound are not on par with what you would see from a big time movie either.

Overall recommendation:  Skip this one",1215561600,4,1759,4.565495207667731
3339859,1,B0013ERFFU,"I love watching the World Series of Poker on ESPN.  I try to catch at least some of the championship rounds every year; so much so that I recognize many of the pros now.  So, I thought a movie with that basis would be fun. Unfortunately, this wasn't.

This movie was incredibly slow; in fact, we finally turned it off 45 minutes in. There was very little plot, or motivation.  While I'm sure most professional poker players only play for the love of the game and the money, I didn't even get that from the players in this film. Casino owner wants to win the jackpot to buy back his casino.  I'm supposed to care, why?  I think this movie would have been better if there was more actual poker playing and less ""character development."" The little cut scenes about the characters and their families that were supposed to resemble the personal bits in championships were just annoying and silly. I enjoy the World Series of Poker for the strategy, for the tension between the players, for the energy...this movie has NONE of that. And since you know it's fake, you can't even drum up any suspense for the jackpot.

I'm guessing this was supposed to be funny, but all it had were bad stereotypes. You have the statistics genius who has horrible social problems and lives at home with his mother. There's the internet player that has no idea how to play poker, but is very lucky. The drug-addict casino owner, the punk mother with a mouth full of foul language, the old-timer who reminisces about how much Vegas has changed...it goes on.  They took every one of the ""pros"" from the real world, magnified them tenfold and through them into this movie.  On the surface, you'd think ""spoofing"" the real poker stars would work.  But this wasn't really a spoof and you know these are actors, and they aren't nearly as funny as a real life person who's an a@@ at the poker table!  Or knowing he's losing money on the blinds because he's been sent to the sidelines for 10 minutes for swearing.

I would only recommend this to die-hard fans of the actors in it.

3339860,2,B0013ERFFU,"This film had its moments of humor, but they were few and far between, and likely as not to be found in one of the deleted scenes or character profiles. In fact, some of the funniest bits are with the real-world poker stars who make cameo appearances in the film.

The story centers on a $10 million poker tournament called The Grand (hence the name of the movie). The film was made on location in the old section of Las Vegas, in and around the Golden Nugget. Woody Harrelson is the main character in the movie and the only one in the tournament who is trying to win for semi-altruistic reasons. A heavy drug and alcohol abuser, who has lived in a rehab center for several years, he wants to buy back the casino he inherited from his dead uncle and then lost through various combinations of substance abuse and stupid decisions.

Of all the main characters, Woody Harrelson is perhaps the most likable, with Dennis Farina taking a close second place. Richard Kind's character is funny at first, but he quickly gets annoying and you find yourself glad when he makes his exit. The rest of the crew is a combination of mean and/or pathetic in different amounts.

The film is somewhat educational in that, if you know nothing about poker, you'll learn a few terms and some of the techniques employed by professional players. It is also good in that it doesn't really glamorize gambling, as the players are generally pathetic losers, each with their own crippling idiosyncrasies and lack of social skills. Harrelson's substance abuse is likewise portrayed in a pathetic light - he only manages to pass out in his hotel room after his ""bender"".

There are some small attempts at promoting familial reconciliation, but the people involved are so pathetic and mean spirited that it is more of a disappointment than heartwarming.

If someone is really into poker and/or thinks that cut-downs and insults are the height of humor, they would probably really enjoy this movie. If someone is a huge Woody Harrelson fan, or a fan of one of the other stars in the movie, they would likewise probably enjoy this movie. At Amazon's current price of $10, you can probably take a chance and see if it is for you, but you're likely to find this one for $5 or less in a bargain bin somewhere within a couple of months.",1215475200,6,2298,4.622549019607843
3339861,4,B0013ERFFU,"""The Grand Championship of Poker"", held at the Golden Nugget Hotel in Las Vegas, furnishes the backdrop for this cleverly constructed mockumentary that will please aficionados of the card game, although viewers not conversant with the rules of poker will understandably be more interested in the personalities involved, thanks to the able leadership of director Zak Penn, who provides his cast with only a briefly outlined scenario from which to work.  This, then, is primarily an improvisational work, with the actors representing actual well-known poker tournament contestants, all the while not themselves knowing the film's outcome, since they are engaged in ongoing competition with highly proficient professionals, contending for a winner-take-all prize of $10 million.  Resourceful editing is the determinant to success for an episodic affair of this sort, and that duty is capably handled by Abby Schwarzwalder, being of particular value during the production's earlier segments, when a wide range of defined character types is created by director Penn.  The film loses much of its impact during its lattermost sequences as a result of poker jargon being extensively utilized, and probably not comprehensible to a good many viewers. The Anchor Bay DVD release enjoys outstanding audio and visual quality and offers a liberal number of interesting extra features.  These include: a brace of alternate endings; some truly comedic deleted scenes that have optional commentary by Penn, writer/executive producer Matt Bierman, and actor Michael Karnow; ""Wild Cards"" - a goodly amount of footage that profiles major players along with some cameo roles; a full-length audio commentary with Penn, Bierman and Karnow, marked by the director's efforts to keep the other two focussed upon the film; and a substantial group of selected scene commentaries with Penn and Woody Harrelson, in addition to one with the director and players Cheryl Hines and Ray Romano.  From among a large collection of talented performers we may enjoy some excellent turns, acting honours going to Chris Parnell as a social misfit who is also a genius at poker.  These extras, taken together, will comprise the principal reason for a majority of those who are not fans of poker playing to acquire this work, their entertainment value offsetting any constraints caused by a self-destructing effect fashioned from the game's usage of poker nomenclature, a failing that will leave many viewers adrift.",1215302400,3,2473,5.41038961038961

Woody checks out of rehab to join a poker game called "" The Grand"", in hopes of paying off the loan and getting his casino back. The movie just goes down in a BORING ball of flames at this time.

3339864,1,B0013ERFFU,"""The Grand"" starts off with an amazing lack of humor, especially considering how hard it tries.  Woody Harrelson as one-eyed Jack Faro is probably a take-off on Johnny Depp's role as one-eyed Jack Sparrow.  It's not funny.  The film centers on Faro's drug and alcohol addiction that have left him close to losing the family business, a gambling casino called the Rabbit's Foot.  That's not funny.  Cheryl Hines who was nominated for an Emmy for ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" in 2005 plays gambling whiz Lainie Schwartzman.  She's not easy to like, constantly complaining.  One wonders what the attraction is with her husband played by Ray Romano.  David Cross plays Lainie's gambling brother.  He's obnoxious, a loser, and completely self-centered.  Dennis Farina as L.B.J. Deuce Fairbanks plays a gambler who treats everybody badly.  Richard Kind plays Andy Andrews, a bumbling amateur who by sheer luck makes it to the finals.  Chris Parnell from ""Saturday Night Live"" plays the stone-faced Harold Melvin whose lack of emotion is something we're supposed to find funny.  Director Werner Herzog who won a Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1982 for ""Fitzcaraldo"" plays the German who likes to kill animals.  Michael McKean who was Lenny on ""Laverne & Shirley"" plays the ruthless rich guy trying to foreclose on The Rabbit's Foot.  The scenes are improvised and mostly don't work.  The climax comes more as relief that the film will finally be over than as an exciting conclusion.  This film didn't work on so many levels for me.  It wasn't funny.  While the actors did what they were supposed to do, none of the characters were interesting or someone for whom you could cheer.  Director Zak Penn has done a lot of work in the industry such as writing ""The Incredible Hulk,"" but this was not the project for which he'll be remembered.

Hearing the back and forth between the players actually made me understand what the movie was attempting to say and how it was attempting to say it.  Also, a man was hit by lightning the day following watching the movie and had a burn mark in his baseball cap to prove it.

Ray Ramano's character was apparently hit by lightning a few years back so he is a little off and he shows his baseball cap to prove where he was hit.  So, did the person above just follow the movie as a hoax or what?

Well, the subtitle ""A Comedy About the Fine Art of Losing,"" really is where the movie is headed from the beginning.  Here we have six losers, two from the same family, who are destined to be on the last table at ""The Grand.""  Basically, the world series of poker.  We go through the lives of each of the characters, so the film is very slow in developing as we see the lives of each.  Once we get to the big poker game, things pick up a bit and the back and forth between the characters is a bit funny.  Some of the humor is a bit gross, so there are scenes definately not for kids.  The back and forth of the announcers of the event is really one of the best parts of the film.

There are definately some great talent too.  Ramano does a good job.  Jason Alexander is a bit funny, but a little off and well too short of a time in the film.  He is facing off with Woody Harrelson, so you have two big players with a ton of potential.  Gabe Kaplan is superb.  It was great to see him again and his playing the dad of a set of twins, identical (really, a boy and a girl being identical????), where they keep fighting all the time.

The movie is billed as one of the greatest collection of comedians in decades, I think Rat Race could be billed as that actually.

What could have been done for improving it is starting off with the final table and where they are when they are there, then flashing back to the beginning of the tourny with each of the focused characters including the finalists, being focused on.  Maybe a split screen with them betting and playing while there is discussion of their life history, or whatever as they approach the tournament.  The movie is slow enough in places where you could have had moved to split and four way shots (ala Time Code). which would have made the movie more appealing and upbeat.

In the end though, listening to and seeing the conversation and conduct of some at the Poker championship, really, they nailed the characters, people who have rough edges, competing for money in a poker game that is nationally recognized.  Fun for some, and a little rough on the edges.  For those who like poker, it should be a fun romp.  More focus on the game would have brought the game to more people.",1214956800,2,2820,4.2556390977443606

8250511,3,B0013ERFFU,"This movie is all about characterizations and performance as the story line is very slim and not all that important.  However, the characters are interesting and well performed.  The movie has plenty of comedy and pathos but could have been more tightly edited as there are some moments where things seem to drag. There are some really excellent performances but they unfortunately are delivered in a rickety vehicle.  Did I love it? No.  Did I like it?  Yes.  Would I watch it again?  Maybe.",1431388800,,492,4.785714285714286
