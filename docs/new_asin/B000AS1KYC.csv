2390894,2,B000AS1KYC,"This 3 CD set is an excellent bargain.  It contains many old TV programs and movies relating to Christmas as we all used to know and love it.  You will enjoy its drama, humor and heart string pulling for the entire season.",1200096000,3,222,4.261904761904762
2390895,4,B000AS1KYC,"If you grew up during the 50s, 60s, or 70s buy this collection and keep it with your other Christmas treasures. There were so many old holiday shows, movies, and specials that you simply do not see very much anymore on TV.",1199577600,3,222,4.309523809523809
2390896,2,B000AS1KYC,This was a good DVD if you like very old shows. There were some shows that clearly told the Christmas Story that we had never seen. But there were many that we clicked quickly through because the quality of the piece was so poor.,1199059200,10,229,4.2272727272727275
2390897,5,B000AS1KYC,"5 stars from me because this is what I expected when I ordered.  All Christmas themed, vintage B&W TV episodes along with old 2 star quality, no longer shown on TV, B&W movies and cartoons from a bygone era.  Enjoy!",1198713600,9,215,4.35
2390898,2,B000AS1KYC,"This set is just ""o.k.""  The main problem is that the description said it contained ""Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer."" What it doesn't say is that it is not the classic TV version that we all associate with the story. Instead, it's a brief cartoon of the story. Since this was the reason I chose this collection, I was disappointed. There are some entertaining programs on the video, but it was not what we expected. We wouldn't have purchased it if we'd veiwed it first.",1198195200,2,469,4.583333333333333
2390899,3,B000AS1KYC,"For under 10 bucks you get three dvds. One has movies, the second has tv shows and the third has cartoons, all with a Christmas theme. I most enjoyed the rarely shown TV version of Miracle on 34th Street (with Uncle Billy as Kris Kringle) and the almost forgotten Beyond Tomorrow, both on the movie disc. I also got a big kick out of the Bev Hillbillies, Burns and Allen, and Jack Benny episodes on the TV disc. Picture quality varies from feature to feature (don't expect restored prints at these prices) but even so, you'll find hours of holiday entertainment for next to nothing. So, if you're over 40, go for it! Enjoy and Merry Christmas.",1197936000,50,643,4.504273504273504
2390900,4,B000AS1KYC,"I love almost anything that is done for the Christmas season!  I chanced upon this little gem after reading one of the reviews, and thought it was worth the money (less than a lot of dvds with only one movie) to at least take a look.

I wasn't disappointed.

There are three disks: the first is full of old 1940's and 1950's television shows that I hadn't seen in ages, and they brought back some happy feelings I used to get as a kid at this time of year.  The second disk contains a variety of cartoons, Christmas and winter themes; I thoroughly enjoyed the ones I remembered, and now have some new favorites from the oldies I've never seen before!  The third disk has some Christmas ""TV movies"" which I don't even remember being on TV!

The video quality is something to be desired for some of these little gems, but for the money, it is well worth having in your Christmas library!",1197417600,69,885,4.365853658536586
2390901,5,B000AS1KYC,"Upon ordering this 3 disc collection I wasn't really sure what to expect but am plesantly surprised to say the least. I have always adored anything with a Christmas theme and this set doesn't disappoint in the least.

2390903,3,B000AS1KYC,"This 3 Disc Christmas Collection, like Christmas itself, offers a mixed bag of goodies. But, at 13 hours long, it certainly provides hours of holiday entertainment. Even if you don't like EVERYTHING included here, you're sure to find  some things that will please you. And, at a mere $[...], this Collection certainly offers A LOT of bang for your Christmas buck. Amazon sent me a set this week that had a Nutcracker on the cover rather than the Christmas tree pictured here, but I'm sure it is the same product.
  Disc 1 is old TV shows with Christmas themed episodes. I did not care to watch ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" or ""Ozzie And Harriet."" But DO WATCH ""The Jack Benny Show: Christmas Shopping"" for the outstanding comedy performance of Mel Blanc (voice of Bugs Bunny and nearly every other Warner Brothers cartoon character) as the frazzled store clerk that Jack drives to a nervous breakdown. And Christmas certainly doesn't get more ""Gay"" than the 1954 episode of ""The Liberace Show"" included here. Disc 1 Extra: Christmas On The Radio.
  Disc 2: With the exception of ""The Christmas Burro"" I did not care for the endless assortment of old Christmas cartoons. But parents may find Disc 2 an agreeable ""Christmas babysitter"" when they need a little peace and quiet  and the kids still need to be entertained. Disc 2: Extra: Christmas songs with on-screen lyrics.
  Disc 3: With four Christmas movies, this disc contains the real prizes. I haven't seen ""Beyond Tomorrow"" (""Beyond Christmas?"") yet, but I intend to. Apparently, it's an overlooked classic. Seymour Hicks stars as ""Scrooge"" in yet ANOTHER version of Charles Dickens' over-done ""A Christmas Carol."" If I have to see another version of Scrooge's Christmas reclaimation, I'll SCREAM! But, if you MUST, see the beautiful 1984 TV version starring George C. Scott and skip this version.
  In the superb 1980 TV film ""A Christmas Without Snow"", Michael Learned moves to San Francisco to start her life over after divorce. She finds community within her church, where the  crotchety, gruff choir master (John Houseman) is determined to make something wonderful out of the church choir with a performance of Handel's ""Messiah"". This is one of the few holiday films to address the fact that Christmas is a season of stress and pain, as well as joy, for many people. The movie is uplifting and never depressing, but it does address the emotional realities of the Christmas Season.
  ""Miracle On 34th Street"": This is a 1955 TV remake  from ""The 20th Century Fox Hour"" starring Macdonald Carey and Teresa Wright. It's amazing how well this Christmas charmer (Yes, Susan, there IS a Santa Claus!) holds up in this shorter, 47 minute version. Of course, I recommend the original 90 minute 1947 film starring Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Natalie Wood, and Edmund Gwenn as the definitive cinema Santa Claus. But, if you're short on time and still want to see this story, this version will do quite nicely. Plus, it is interesting to compare the two versions. Disc 3 Extras: Images Of Christmas.",1228348800,4,3046,4.912280701754386
2390904,3,B000AS1KYC,"This DVD brought back the old memories of Christmas celebrations I enjoyed as a child through the use of black and white cartoons, old movies, songs, and Christmas TV specials.  The most entertaining of the entire collection is Ozzie and Harriett.  These folks can still bring laughter and fun to your heart.  The collection can be enjoyed by the young and old and will take many down memory lane.  Grab a copy for a stocking stuffer or for a that ""special"" group that hangs out during the holidays and complains that they're bored.  It will liven up any snowy day and keep 'em coming back for more!",1228003200,,599,4.5607476635514015
2390905,4,B000AS1KYC,"This collection of Christmas videos is actually better than what I thought it would be.  All of the titles in this collection appear to be public domain material (no copyright) but that doesn't diminish the enjoyment you will get from them.
The tv episodes are probably the ones you will enjoy the most and include The Beverly Hillbillies, Ozzie & Harriet, Jack Benny and a Liberace Christmas.  The Christmas specials are mostly short cartoons related to Christmas but I wouldn't consider them tv specials.  The films in the collection are ones that are seldom seen.
If you like watching offbeat material, give this one a chance.  It is worth watching mainly for the rarity of the material.  One caveat.  The film quality of most of these have degraded extensively and if that annoys you, you should probably pass.",1227398400,2,814,4.86231884057971
2390906,5,B000AS1KYC,my kids and us enjoy watching those dvds around xmass time. every year. very nice collection to have for xmass time.,1226966400,,116,4.571428571428571
2390907,5,B000AS1KYC,"First I must say my deepest sympathy goes to anyone who is disappointed with this collection.

I do not believe the review by ""Mysterious Mr Wong"" can be improved, but perhaps I can expand it a bit.

Disc I, without a doubt offers humor and nostalgia.

Disc II, is a windfall for fans of animated cinemaphotography. For them, the Jack Frost title noted by ""MMW"" as, ""(Not the famous version)"" is an Ub Iwerks, classic ComiColor Cartune. With a little Googling you may discover that Iwerks, a fantastic innovative animator was the creator of Mickey Mouse, it wasn't Walt Disney. Several Fleischman productions are included on this disc too.

Disc III, the movies are excellent Christmas fun. In my opinion, ""Beyond Tomorrow"" aka ""Beyond Christmas"" could easily rate with ""The Bishop's Wife"", ""A Christmas Story"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as a forever classic. ""Miracle on 34th Street"", was first aired on TV, Dec. 14, 1955 on ""The 20th Century-Fox Hour"". A review of that may be found at The Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

If you buy this, enjoy!",1222387200,11,1048,4.832402234636872
2390908,5,B000AS1KYC,"The Christmas collection has over 13 hours of Christmas entertainment. It contains everthing from TV shows from the past, such as Ozzie & Harriet and The Jack Benny Show, to TV classics like Rudolph and Jack Frost. There are also several movies, Miracle On 34th Street being my favorite. I think anyone who loves Christmas will find several shows that bring back memories and help to make new ones.",1217376000,7,398,4.782608695652174
2390909,1,B000AS1KYC,"I was extremely disappointed in this collection.  I have never seen ANY of the Christmas cartoons that were included and believe me I've seen a bunch of them.
One thing's for sure, they were not your (my) traditional version of classic Christmas cartoons.
I got them and sent it back them back all in the same day.",1205020800,2,314,4.508771929824562
2390910,5,B000AS1KYC,"This collection is marvelous!  It contains many of the Christmas shows I remember from my childhood, and I even discovered a few wonderful shows that I had missed.  The DVD format is great.  I had a great time playing these shows for my children this season.  Many of them were also the perfect length for playing on our DVD player in our van when we were driving to various holiday events and parties.",1201478400,18,402,4.465753424657534
2390911,5,B000AS1KYC,"excellent, alot of older cartoons, and the old miracle on 34th street black and white, 4 other movies about 40 minutes long, real good. i would recommend this to anyone who loves christmas movies and cartoons. a version of rudolph the red nosed reindeer, not the popular one, but its real good about 20 minutes.",1200528000,4,311,4.672727272727273
2390912,5,B000AS1KYC,"There were many other features I might have added to this collection were I the one in charge, but then, it would have been a 40-disk collection.  Let me just say that I got an awesome collection of good old, nostalgic Christmas goodies I'll be a long time viewing and re-viewing.  Lots of baang for the buck - 6 stars worth.

8079295,4,B000AS1KYC,This was a nice collection. I thought it was worth the money. I especially liked the TV shows. I hadn't seen Ozzie and Harriet for some time. Alot of laughs.,1230422400,2,157,4.266666666666667
8079296,5,B000AS1KYC,"I bought this collection in hopes that it would contain the Christmas cartoons I watched in my youth, and I wasn't disappointed! ""Santa's Surprise"" & ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" (on the 2nd disc) were my favorites as a kid and watching them again brought back so many memories! And there were other cartoons that I immediately recognized once they came on, but never would have remembered otherwise.

As the cartoons are from the 30s and 40s, they are NOT PC, and contain what would now be characterized as ""racist"" undertones... but I only notice this now that I am watching them as an adult. I didn't pick up on anything when I was a little kid watching them in the 80's, so I still consider it a ""safe"" collection to purchase for your children.",1229558400,3,744,4.593984962406015
