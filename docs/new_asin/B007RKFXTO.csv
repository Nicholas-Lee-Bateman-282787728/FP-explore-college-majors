5108868,4,B007RKFXTO,Remembered seeing it a long time ago and was thrilled when I found that it was available on DVD. I really enjoyed watching it.,1358553600,3,126,4.291666666666667
5108869,5,B007RKFXTO,"I am totally captivated by actress Aline MacMahon. While an acknowledged first rate actress, Aline never really became a full fledged star. However, it really doesn't matter because she ripped the heck out of any role she took on and the films she was in were better for it. Since I had never seen this film I bought the DVD, popped some corn, and camped out.
This is one of those whodunnit movies. Very much reminiscent of Cat and the Canary, there is a lot going on in this one. Seemingly there is plenty of slight of hand and confusion, secret doorways, shadowy characters hiding behind curtains, a large cast of characters, and plenty of thunder and lightening and even a couple of deaths.
MacMahon plays a nurse who is inserted in the story to tend to the master of the creepy old house. Guy Kibbee is the detective investigating a murder in the house. As luck would have it, Kibbee is sweet on MacMahon's nurse. As he tries to woo the nurse while investigating first one murder and then another, there is marvelous banter between the two that takes comedy to another level. Of course, MacMahon always seems to be one step ahead of her wouldbe beau. Working together, they solve the crime and you see MacMahon warming a little to Kibbee.
Aline and Guy really play off one another with confidence and ease. The dialogue is snappy and the story never slows. For a short film made on the cheap this movie is a delightful gem and is another example of why MacMahon and Kibbee were teamed together so often in the early to mid 1930's. On top of it all, there are good performances by Henry O'Neill, Dorothy Tree, Lyle Talbot, Allen Jenkins, Robert Barratt, Patricia Ellis, and the great Hobart Bosworth.
The print is actually in good shape and my only complaint is that Ellis' makeup was less than flattering.",1342915200,16,1809,4.58641975308642

8521395,4,B007RKFXTO,"It is clear, from the included movie trailer, that Warner Brothers was trying to come up with a popular mystery-solver series like Fox Film Corporation's Charlie Chan, who was played by Warner Oland at the time ( 1935).  It claims that Detective O'Leary will out-Chan Charlie Chan . . . alas, it was not to be.

On a mystery level, its a mishmash of nonsensical red herrings and incomplete story lines - in the beginning, much is made of old Mr. Federie's calling the family together to tell them something vitally important, but before he can, he has a stroke.  All of them and the lawyer are dying to be the first to talk to the old man when he recovers . . . of course, one of them dies before he does.  It never explains what is going on here;  there are, however, a few clues from which you might surmise what had happened to lead to this situation and what Mr. Federie intended to do . . . you just need a little imagination to do so.

On a comedy level, it has its moments.  Much of the humor comes from the interplay between Inspector O'Leary and Nurse Keate.  Perhaps, the more funnier moments come from the brash Sergeant Jackson.

Overall:  Although it is not a great mystery or comedy, it is still an enjoyable movie to watch more than once.

DVD-R - 2012.  Sharpness: good.  Contrast: excellent.  Defects:  grainy, small white flecks with occasional short vertical streaks.  Sound: clear.  Music: well done - perfectly sets the mood for the murder scene.  Subtitles: none.",1383696000,,1485,4.518796992481203
