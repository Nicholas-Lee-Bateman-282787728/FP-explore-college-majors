8518719,5,B007K7ICMY,"This is not a high-production video -- no fancy graphics or animations. What it is is an excellent, easy-to-understand, step-by-step process for how to swing a golf club in a classic, text-book manner. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced player who just needs to tune-up, it will get you there if you apply yourself to the lessons for a few minutes a day. Bannon's language is straightforward and to the point; there's no baloney or hype. Five stars.",1452902400,,458,4.810126582278481
8518720,5,B007K7ICMY,I like Rory McIlroy's swing and this is the guy that built it. This video lays the foundation to build a really nice swing.,1372896000,,123,4.166666666666667
8518721,1,B007K7ICMY,Do not buy if you are a serious golfer.  Does not give you much detail and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under a 5 handicap.,1370822400,,128,3.923076923076923
