8186091,1,6304843364,"Man, I was so pumped to see this movie, I'm a huge Chow Yun Fat fan. I see the cover, looked cool, the back plot description sounded promising. I pop the tape in, and what do I see? A horrible light hearted comedy, with crappy subtitles.

  I review this from a fan perspective of Yun Fat's work with John Woo, as well as his more dramatic roles, but don't be decieved by the box. I read somewhere that Yun Fat has countless,nameless generic Hong Kong films that he worked on when he was younger. Don't buy this unless your a fan of cheesy poorly subtitled light hearted Hong Kong comedies from the early  80's. Oh yeah shouldn't there be a law against false movie advertisment.",1097020800,,678,4.4
