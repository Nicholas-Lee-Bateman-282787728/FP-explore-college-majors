8171714,5,B000MRY03Y,"From the back cover:  ""The true stories of six ordinary Americans who performed extraordinary deeds in the face of death and earned our nation's highest honor.  Intense, powerful battle scenes combine with moving, firsthand accounts of the events which culminated in such incredible acts of selflessness and bravery that...these remarkable souls [were awarded] the Medal of Honor.""

Highly recommended for older students--too intense in my opinion for pre-teens.  Includes the amazing story of Clarence Sasser, one of the nation's few African-American Honor Medal winners--no affirmative action here!  Has stories from WWII to Somalia.",1221523200,,635,5.78494623655914
