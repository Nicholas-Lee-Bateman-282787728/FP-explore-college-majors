7919149,2,B00003M5HB,"Holiday On The Buses was the second film to be adapted from the popular British sitcom. This time it's set on a typically English holiday camp and all the double entrendes and comic misunderstandings makes very predictable viewing. Reg varney and the cast are all likeable in their flamboyantly exagerated characterisations but this is just like most other movies to be adapted from a television series. Interest wanes after about 25 minutes - normally the running time of a standard episode of the series, so this just seems like one ponderous extended t.v sketch. To be fair though there are some laughs along the way with Anna karen as Olive, always providing the funniest moments. Unfortunatley though the whole film seems quite dated now and was obviously very cheaply made. fans of the series will love this. If you've never even heard of the series though there is little to recommend apart from the fairly likeable albeit caricture performances. Typical British 1970's vehicle.",992476800,,985,5.049079754601227
7919150,5,B00003M5HB,"Holiday On The Buses sees Stan and Jack taking a job at a Holiday Camp in Wales. With all that Sun, Sand, Sea etc, what could possible spoil the fun. There is the small matter of the Camp Security Inspector (Yep you know who). Blakey is there to try and keep the two under control. Holiday romance is in the air though, with Stan's Mum and even Blakey finding a love interest. Amongst the regular cast There are some guest appearances by well-known faces. Hilarious and chaotic adventures follow in what is probably the best of the 3 On The Buses movies..  British comedy at it's best. Climb aboard, sit back, relax and enjoy the seaside humour.",980035200,2,645,4.512820512820513
7919151,3,B00003M5HB,"Stan and Jack get fired from the bus depot and decide to go and work as a bus crew for a holiday resort. The family of course decide to go on holiday with hilarious results. This was the last of three films made of the  popular British television series. Stars Reg Varney, Doris Hare, Stanley  Lewis et al. A good buy if you prefer British humour.",958694400,,347,4.242424242424242
