The show looked like grainy videotape when it first aired, it looked that way on Netflix, and it looks that way on DVD. They could ""remaster"" it, put it on Blu-ray, and it would still look like that. I suppose the people who like the look of the show when it first aired should hook their DVD player up to an old tube television and watch it that way. It seems tube TVs don't show the flaws in the original footage as well as HD screens. Oh well.

731046,5,6303918522,"""The Wonder Years"" is both a coming of age piece like Stephen King's ""The Body"" (""Stand By Me""), an important documentation of American History (Teaching The Cold War and the 60's-70's cultural revolution is very hard) and a critical look at how American families have changed since the mid 20th century. ""The Wonder Years"" set out to do the first and has subsequently done the other two.  Neal Marlens and Carol Black have changed America with thunder (Gay rights, ""Ellen"") and with respectful reflection as America explodes with change here.
  Some critics have focussed on picture quality, digitation music quality while ignoring what it took to secure the rights of Joe Cocker, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, The Monkees, Joni Mitchell, Jimmi Hendrix, Carole King and dozens of other top notch classic songwriters. Much of the footage is meant to look like a 16mm camera from the 1960's, the rest is restored from the best available masters; when the material's this brilliant to complain that you should have cleaned your glasses before watching means you've missed the point. In the case of ""The Wonder Years"" that's a tragedy.
  Historically everything is dead on accurate. From wardrobe (Deborah La Gorge Kramer) to setting and properties (Jimmy Cuomo) on to scripts, performances, the nuances of a changing America. The original music is by W.G. Snuffy Walden, who is to television scoring what John Williams is to film scoring except that, like Stephen Sondheim, you never hear the same thing twice. (Who knew that ""The West Wing"" and ""Roseanne"" were composed by the same man?)
  Subsequently, this has become a remarkably important piece of television. Teachers will play it in classrooms and it will suit many disciplines: History, music, civics, English, health. As a man in his 50's it is Nostalgia to the extent that we're reminded of when we were Kevin Arnold. But the ugly parts aren't erased and the beautiful parts aren't embellished. (Nostalgia comes from ancient Greek: Nostra meaning home, Algia meaning pain.) We will never return to the time in America when so many were fighting and giving their lives for freedom. When a unified country was important; when there was national pride; when the American Flag was more than a magnet for your truck to equate with a LaCoste Crocodile or Ralph Lauren Polo Player. The people, no matter their personal view, fought the system, something that hasn't happensd since. The Civil Rights movement, Women's rights, Human Rights, the solidarity of our Constitution; they were all worth dying for. The Vietnam War is always there subtly in the background and there is always the question of whether or not Kevin Arnold will turn 18, draw The Lottery (a draft system that would have had Shirley Jackson shaking her head with tears in her eyes) and be sent to Southeast Asia to die. It underscores every moment, just as it did for any male who was born between 1946 and 1962.
  The performances are brilliant and given how many are children actors and that a narrator reflects back 20 years, it's the direction, the editing, the cinematography the dozens of writers and the 430 people who create perfection.
  Season one was a replacement series, and thus has only 6 episodes. Seasons one and two can be bought together or, for $12 you can sample just this in case you don't believe me.
  I pray that all six seasons are released. ""The Wonder Years"" is a title with many meanings. The Pilot is in 1968 so the finale demands to be 1974. These are the crucial years of The Cultural Revolution. The assassination of Bobby Kennedy to the departure of Air Force One from the East Lawn on Aug 9, 1974. Nixon resigns.
  Every episode is bookended by Joe Cocker's cover of ""With A Little Help from My Friends."" A piece of music that is as multi layered and as classic as the the series itself. This is television at it's finest. This is Sorkin before Sorkin. This is fun, universal, moving, classy and brilliant.
  This is a myst for yourself and your children. This is a moving gift for anyone- even though there is a difference between those who were born before 1962 and those born after.
  Buy it. Settle in and have a remarkable experience.",1424476800,21,4207,4.826147426981919

731051,4,6303918522,"The Wonder Years  Season One

It was 1988 and those Happy Days had been over for a while when ABC decided to take another walk down memory lane and once again tap into the publics love for nostalgia.  Displaying confidence in their new product, ABC launched The Wonder Years on January 31st 1988 following Super Bowl XXII and made sure you knew it was coming by advertising it during the game.  Perhaps not quite as well as the Redskins did against the Broncos in the big game, The Wonder Years did defeat its competition that night and continued to be a solid hit for ABC ranking in the Nielsen top 30 for its first four seasons.

The Wonder Years chronicled the life of Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage); a normal twelve year old boy growing up in the suburbs during the turbulent times of the late sixties and early seventies.  The obvious keys to the success of the show were the writing and the casting.  For many people, Kevin, his family and friends, were like us and the people we knew.  Add to that the first person narration of adult Kevin (Daniel Stern), which had been used so successfully in the film Stand By Me two years earlier, created a dynamic that allowed us more insight to the story than had been experienced on television since the days of Dobie Gillis.

With each episode of The Wonder Years filled with music of the era, the half hour of real comedic moments and poignant drama were indeed a weekly opportunity to visit that adolescent time of wonder.  Unfortunately it was the rights to the afore mentioned music that made it so difficult to get the show released to the public on DVD.  On October 7th 2014 StarVista and Time Life Entertainment released season one in a two disc set featuring the first six episodes of the series and a substantial amount of bonus material.

When experiencing the first episode on DVD you can easily see why the show was so successful in pulling in an audience.  Series creators and writers Neil Marlens and Carol Black do an amazing job of not only introducing us to the characters but making us care about them as well.  The true value of the narration is highlighted as Kevin is being questioned by his principal and we hear the voice of adult Kevin (Stern) letting us know what he wanted to say.  A relatable situation indicative of things to come and reflective of a key success factor to the series as a whole.
Watching this new release is a pleasure.  It invokes not only memories of the time period reflected in the series, but also of the time when the series first ran.  The music of the era and that created for the series by W.G. Snuffy Walden are a perfect fit.  Unfortunately, once you remove the rose colored glasses and memory muted headphones you see and hear that some of the quality is not what we have come to expect in the releases of today.  This may take some time to adjust to or may simply be unacceptable to some, but, if you focus on the storytelling you will find satisfaction.

The bonus material is briefly entertaining based on a desire to see how the stars of the series look and is certainly informative, but is ultimately long winded, repetitive, and awkward.

The cast reunion accomplishes the desire to see how the cast looks, but clearly needs a moderator to control the flow as certain cast members dominate the conversation while others are left out.

The featurette With a Little Help from My Friends: The Early Days of the Wonder Years is the best of the bunch as it contains much of the information provided in the other pieces, but in a more concise and entertaining format.

The interviews have a Public Access quality as it is just the stars talking to the camera.  The Neil Marlens and Carol Black interview is in need of editing and is the most awkward as the two don't interact well.  Notice how he never laughs especially when she is laughing.

Often the material in the interviews has been mentioned in the other bonus material and it would have been far more enjoyable had they edited in segments of the show that the interviewees are describing.

Recommendation:  This is an iconic series that was far ahead of its time.  The quality may not be perfect but the content is very close to perfect.  The bonus material is almost as long as the six episodes but will seem much longer.  This is good for those just looking for a trip down memory lane, but the true fan should opt for the complete series set.",1423008000,2,4406,4.511335012594459
731052,4,6303918522,"I grew up watching this program with my mon and dad.  They grew up in this era (both were born in '62).  I always had an affinity to the 60s and 70s and this series portrayed this period very well.  That was such a magical time in this country.  I was amazed at all the negative reviews for the picture quality.  I just bought this last night at Target so I checked out a couple minutes of the first episode.  Admittedly it is a bit out of focus and slightly grainy but I think it was probably intended to look that way to give it a vintage, dreamy feel just to help you feel even more like you are back in the 60s.  Could the picture quality be better? Yes, but as it stands I think it is just fine.  I hope people don't start boycotting this just because it is not absolutely perfect and cause Star Vista to not release all 6 Seasons individually.  I know I plan to buy all 6 Seasons myself.  Nitpicking is just ridiculous in these instances.  People just expect too much with BluRay and HD TV these days.  For God's sake, this is a 27 year old TV show filmed on videotape, give the Studio a break.  Yes there are some classic shows out there a lot older than this that have been beautifully restored, but I guess Star Vista put the emphasis on obtaining licensing rights to the music.  Had the Picture quality been top notch these would probably be around $30 instead of $15.  Just be happy this isn't being handled like In the Heat of the Night, TGG Direct has just made a mess of that series on DVD!",1422403200,,1504,4.173611111111111

It apparently does contain all of Season One, however that season was six episodes long.  The extras that are included (over 2 hours) are ridiculously repetitive and not worth the time it takes to watch them.  Additionally, for some reason the video is very grainy at times and looks like it could have been copied from a VHS tape.  The music seems to be as originally broadcast, but in no case that I noticed was an entire song ever played on the show or the DVD.

I have TWO bootleg versions of this entire series and BOTH versions are of better quality. Now one version came from Nick At Night and it has many commercials that interrupt the show but the other version that I own is from another network and it makes this OFFICIAL RELEASE look like the garbage that it is. For years I wanted to see this show on dvd but the companies behind the series would not release the series. So I went to a bootleg site and bought two version of the show. One show from a specific rerun network made it very easy for a FAN to dvr the show. That fan copied the entire series. I OWN the entire series and it is of MUCH BETTER QUALITY than what the company put to dvd in this official release. The main problem with the dvds is that the image is OUT OF FOCUS and the image is BEYOND GRAINY. The product is nothing other than old video tapes slapped onto a dvd. DO NOT BUY IT. I'm very sorry to deliver such bad news to fans, and I am a HUGE FAN of this GREAT SHOW. Who didn't love this show with all of it's tales of kids trying to grow up. I drive a school bus and this show is near and dear to my heart but this product is just AWFUL.",1419638400,4,1300,4.042635658914729

However, having seen how beautifully some older shows have been restored recently, I have to confess that the video and audio quality of The Wonder Years is a major disappointment. Since it originally aired, I've watched it in syndication on various networks, and also on Amazon, and it seems to me that these DVDs simply are not very good. If this was the best possible quality that could be achieved, then so be it, but I caution anyone who hasn't seen these DVDs yet; be prepared to be disappointed.

731213,5,6303918522,"I have to say I'm getting tired of reading the reviews by people who say the picture quality is bad or substandard. They are completely wrong.

I bought the set of the first two seasons of ""The Wonder Years"" at Costco, having bought Season 1 at Amazon first. I can assure the readers of this review that the picture quality is excellent, and absolutely the best this show has ever looked. No, it's not Blu-ray, so for those who say this series should have been ""updated for high-definition televisions,"" that is a ridiculous comment-- DVDs are and always were meant for tube/CRT televisions, never for HD televisions. The show was not shot in high-definition, which didn't exist in 1988, and this offering is a DVD, not a Blu-ray. Which you knew before you made the purchase.

Second, for those of you complaining about lines going down the middle of the screen, both black lines and white lines, which are actually white dots, that is only in the opening montage with the opening credits. That's it. AND, guess what, as every long-time viewer of this show knows, that was all done ON PURPOSE. That opening sequence is meant to look like an old 8mm film, as if it was someone's home movie of that time period, 1968.  Understand, that was intentional, and it was ALWAYS that way from the very first season in 1988. My God, just look at the shape and footprint of the opening sequence-- it is smaller than the regular-size frame of the remainder of the show, and it has rounded corners, for goodness' sake, just like an old 8mm home movie.

However, once each new episode begins (after the opening credits), the film becomes much sharper and of a much higher quality. Again, just as in 1988, but this DVD set is just a little bit sharper and better.  Clearly, this DVD set WAS remastered, and these DVDs have excellent picture quality, better than any Wonder Years episodes that we viewed in 1988 or 1990-- not much better, but clearly a little better. I would rate the picture quality as being about excellent for this TV show, I'd call it a 9 out of 10.  Most other TV shows made at the same time, that may look better today on DVD, were shot on video, which is inherently much sharper than film.  Or, even if on film, other TV shows from that time were meant to look newer. This TV show, conversely, was always meant to look a little bit less than brand-new-- evidently, to invoke feelings of nostalgia.

Regarding everything else about this DVD set, this is a 10+.  The Time-Life/Star Vista people who put together this DVD set obviously did it with a lot of love for this TV show, its characters, producers, writers, and actors.

There really isn't much more to say. This was a unique, memorable TV series for the ages, and this DVD set more than does it justice. As there is no reason to expect a Blu-ray offering, this will be the best picture quality we can get. But, again, the picture quality is excellent, and those of you who are judging each entire 23-minute episode by just the opening montage, which was MEANT to look old, grainy, and amateur-home-movie-ish, you simply don't know what you're talking about.",1415664000,4,3120,4.585278276481149

This series was most surely shot on 35mm but in a 4 X 3 format..(conventional TV size).....for it not to be re-mastered is a crime, and it has NOT been.......HD quality it is certainly not.....It is more to be compared with great VHS quality.  And the problem is compounded when most wide-screen TV's and/or DVD players have settings that automatically zoom in the picture to fill up the screen so people won't have black bars on each side of the frame, making the picture look even worse.  You can defeat those functions and the picture quality does improve, but again, it should have been re-mastered.  I have Gunsmoke episodes from the 50's that are tack-sharp and look amazing.  This, sadly, does not...but the quality of the writing and acting on the show, ALMOST makes up for the sub-par picture.",1414540800,3,909,4.770700636942675

Anyway, this show is mostly about the great writing and great music, and as an overall experience it definitely stands the test of time.  I love The Wonder Years!",1414281600,5,334,4.55
731219,5,6303918522,"What a great series.  If you were around the same age as Kevin Arnold during the late 60's/early 70's, you realize that this show is so spot on, it's scary.
Now, to address the reviewers that don't like the quality of the release.  This show, although filmed in the late 80's, was designed to give a 60's feel, so it was filmed to give it that look, which included use of 8mm or super 8 film in the opening credits.  The look of the show is a bit soft, but it was designed to be that way.  That look is a bit exaggerated with todays much larger TV's, but I'm watching on a 70in big screen and it looks fine.  Yes it has some grain, but that's not going to get cleaned up without ruining the intended look.  I look forward to getting season 2 and the rest when they become available.",1414195200,6,782,4.1118421052631575

731221,5,6303918522,"In reading the reviews I was amazed at the diversity of opinions regarding the video quality of the shows.  I was able to get a copy of the season one set from my local library and find no problems at all with the video or audio quality.  I certainly don't see any lines or other obvious defects.  I consider a reasonable amount of ""grain"" to be normal in film and not a defect.  I've seen home videotaped episodes of the show and these DVDS are significantly better.  I must admit to be speaking from the perspective of one who's been watching TV  since the early 1950s, so while I appreciate HD, surround sound, and mega-sized screens, they are certainly not a necessity.

The bonus features include a 2014 reunion of the cast members who recall their years on the show as a very special time.  For true fans of the show I believe this more than compensates for the relatively short season one.  And for the present price of $14.99, what's the big deal anyway?",1414022400,14,962,4.451428571428571

I bought just season 1, and it is only 6 episodes. I agree with other reviewers, they really should have waited & combined season 1 & 2 together. The biggest disappointment though is that the episodes are so blurry its as if I am watching them on a Zenith from the 70s or 80s. You know how sometimes you watch an old show on TV that hasn't been updated yet for HD and its a little blurry? This is 100 times worse! It really is that bad.

My husband always cherished this show, and after watching a few episodes, I now know why. I didn't ""get it"" earlier, but now, at a different time in life, I think it's genius. I think anyone ordering this is already sold on the show itself, so I will concentrate on the DVD release quality and extras. I really don't think the one and two star reviews on this are a good representation of the quality; this may not be HD-BluRay-Latest-Minute-Technology in viewing, but the show wasn't filmed that way, either. I never once thought about it while I was watching it. (And I do hope that that low reviewers do understand that the opening credits were filmed as a ""home movie"".) I would buy this DVD again in a heartbeat! The quality is beautiful, in my opinion. There is no reason for it to be trashed, or the music. Again, they waited until they were able to secure a huge percentage of the music rights, and it plays out exquisitely. I am now hooked, and I pray that the negative reviews won't prevent the rest of us from enjoying all the rest of the seasons. I repeat:  The DVD is excellent,  and was never intended to be ""HD"" or whatever.

The extras that they put together for this are absolutely worth the price of admission and more. They are just EXCELLENT. You will get so wrapped up in watching and listening to the cast and creative team talk, that you will totally lose yourself in complete enjoyment and interest. They are an intelligent bunch of people with so many great memories and insights to share; this alone makes the DVD more than worth whatever you pay for it.

731334,2,6303918522,"OK. as others have mentioned this was a great series and it's about time it was available on DVD with most of the original soundtrack intact. However, it appears zero dollars went into the video remaster. The picture quality is worse than a good VHS tape (it's really poor)! If you're use to watching HD content you will be shocked at the poor quality. The aspect ratio is 4:3 (typical for that era) and as I started watching the first episode ""Pilot"" I also noted that there is a vertical band about a quarter inch in from the right side of the frame (playback on a PS3). Very annoying and most pronounced on the first episode. Played through my sound system, there also isn't much depth to the great songs that apparently were the big stumbling block to getting this series available on home media. If this first season is any indication, I can't imagine paying $250+ for the complete series (based on Star Vista's lackluster effort). For as long as this took to become available, it should look and sound much better!

So, 5 stars for fact this is now available. One star for the overall effort on the finished product (weighted much higher). A very generous 2 stars overall..........

Edit: Enjoyed the bonus features on Disc 2. It was great to see and hear ALL the original cast members chat about the series and learn interesting inside tidbits. Good stuff! Video quality infinitely better than the episodes.

As a warning for anyone planning to purchase this series, please note that as of October 16, 2014 only one of the 16 - 5 star reviews is actually a ""verified purchase"" and that reviewer admits the video quality is poor.

Note on the VIDEO QUALITY: You have to understand that TV shows produced in the late 1980's & 1990's were filmed, sometimes on 16mm instead of 35mm, then transferred to analogue video tape for editing.  Thus the final edit of the episodes are on analogue video tape.  So unless the original camera film negatives are re-transfered to HD Video and re-edited to match the original edits (like Star Trek TNG, Seinfeld, That 70's Show), this is the best it will look.
I notice that there is no continuity to the run times of each show, which indicates if a song was cut out.

As far as the show itself, Fred Savage & Danica McKellar give amazing performances as Kevin & Winnie.  Every subtle nuance of their personalities is perfectly portrayed.  The stories themselves capture the 1960's era perfectly.  The original music included is essential to the mood of the show and thankfully most of it is here.

This is much more affordable than the cheaply packaged complete series sold at Time-Life's website.",1412640000,17,3373,5.1648148148148145

I really don't understand how they could release it looking this bad. It is quite a disservice to the fans of The Wonder Years. The company that released it also released Mama's family and that looks wonderful compared to this. It's obvious that there has been no re-mastering whatsoever. What a shame!

Superb writing and acting.  I was the 'wonder years' age in the mid 70's but much of what is shown on the show, I could relate to.
I was excited to find out earlier this year that it was going to be released on video even with the difficulty of getting all the songs rights to be used.
I did not spring for the $250 set (I don't feel the need for all the swag for I am about the show only) so I only own Season 1.
Though I give 5 stars for the show (is there a sixth star?), I can not do so for the quality.  I know its from the 80's but I have bought many a shows on dvd/bluray over the years to know that the picture could have been cleaned up a bit.  Another question is...why not on bluray?  The Wonder Years is a hugely important show and I just think 'whomever' could have given it the quality treatment it deserves.  I can only give it 1 star for quality.
Still....if you are fan....and this is obviously the only way we can get this show in an official capacity....dont hesitate.  Just know the quality of the picture is not the best.  Buy it for the quality of tv that it is",1412640000,5,1252,3.893700787401575

These are the technical specifications for ""THE WONDER YEARS"" according to IMDB (Internet Movie Database). It seems it was originally shot on film and then transferred to videotape. That would account for the soft picture on DVD if they used the videotape transfers. But why didn't TIME LIFE go back to the original camera negatives and remaster the image is the question? Are the original camera negatives still in existence?

NEW DEVELOPMENT 2

After watching the DVD set of Season 1 and comparing it to the NETFLIX shows, it looks exactly like they used the same masters. I have concluded if you love this show. It is watchable.

BRING ON SEASON 2 PLEASE!",1412553600,4,1670,4.939068100358423

 I remember asking them if it would be packaged like Charmed and possibly get scratched, and they assured me they don't make products that easily scratch. Yea, like the DVD's they use are better than Paramount and other studios lol. My disc's are already scratched to hell, and the video quality looks almost as bad as my VHS that I have. Worst $250 I have ever spent in my life. I am going to return mine, buy the individual seasons in regular cases as they get released, and save over $100. There is absolutely NO excuse for a DVD of this show to look so crappy, when older shows have come out looking damn near perfect.

However, when trying to buy the series from the Timelife website I was prevented from doing so because copyright restrictions they can only sell the entire series to people living in America and Canda. Now, yes there are sellers on this website, but the cost is such that I feel unable to buy the whole box set. So I will buy this DVD which I sure will be fab and wait till all the rest come out next year.",1412380800,2,527,4.076923076923077

The picture quality is perfect for a TV show that is nearly 30 years old and shot in standard definition.  Kinda sad that the reason we had to wait so long for this show to finally be released was the music rights.  How lame is that?

731399,5,6303918522,"I had never heard the word ""dramedy"" when I watched the series premiere of ""The Wonder Years"" but after I read a review of the show and saw that word used, I thought: perfect.  I was amazed by how much the series resonated with me.  As a boy growing up in the NYC suburbs in the '60s, I saw my childhood in Kevin Arnold's eyes: his friends, his parents and siblings, his teachers, his home, and so on.  And, of course, his girlfriend Winnie Cooper.

Years later, I loved watching the reruns on cable with my own young kids and surprising my then- eight-year-old daughter by taking her to see Fred Savage and Dan Lauria in a summer stock production in Cape Cod, where they patiently greeted their newest fan after the show.

Now, I look forward to surprising them again by pulling out this DVD for an old-fashioned family TV night.  Only this time, I know what ""dramedy"" means.  What a great show!",1412035200,7,896,4.426829268292683

The discs are placed in tight cardboard sleeves that are hard to take out, especially without scratching them. Scratched discs don't always play properly. Worst of all the picture quality is NOT dvd quality. The picture is basically somewhat grainy. Full House, Family Matters, and Roseanne, which all aired in the same time frame of late 1980s - 1990s, boxed sets are all flawless picture quality worthy of a dvd release. The price they are charging for this
set is downright appauling!!!  What a HUGE disappointment! To wait so many years for this crappy release of one of the best shows to ever air on television. They have not done this show justice by any means. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!

The issues and situations of every episode will be completely relevant to today's audience, too.  Such a gem of a show.",1411344000,4,423,4.5
731454,5,6303918522,"Wonder Years is one of the most beloved comedy dramas of all time, sort of like a more modern version of Leave It To Beaver with music thrown in, especially fun is the sister played by Olivia D'Abo. There are only 6 episodes in season 1, it would have made a lot more sense to have released season 2, which contains only 17 more episodes, together with season 1 in the same package, apparently there was a writer's strike at this time accounting for the shortage of episodes in the first two seasons.

Included with this set is a 12 page leaflet that has an introduction by Fred Savage, full episode guide with liner notes and other interesting features such as Music Appreciation, Wisdom of Wonder Years and Kevin's (Daniel Stern) comments about their first kiss - a neat overall package. The cast reunion is the best part of the extras, about 20 minutes long , sort of like a disjointed conversation, the interview with Fred about 30 minutes. Danica and Paul about 20 minutes each, but aren't as enlightening as I would have hoped for, they all basically have similar comments, I would have preferred more episodes instead, the first 6 left me longing for more.

A few minor issues I have with this release are 1) the brief clips of season 1 included on the extra bonus features seem to have a brighter clearer image than shown in the actual DVD episodes themselves . so how is that possible?, and 2) during Fred Savage's interview, he seems to punctaute most of his comments with a ""you know"", this becomes quite distracting, you would have thought that with all his acting experience, this could not be happening.

Actually the complete series is available from TIME LIFE, 115 episodes on 26 DVD's for $249.95 and includes over 23 hours of bonus features in a collectible metal locker with a replica yearbook and includes more than 300 songs as they were featured in the original broadcast.

Some Interesting facts you may not know about Fred Savage :

At the age of twelve, he became the youngest person ever to be nominated for an Emmy as best leading performer.

Appeared in Little Monsters (1989) with brother Ben Savage and sister Kala Savage.

He first met his wife, Jennifer Stone, where they were neighbors as children. Coincidently, he became famous for playing a character on The Wonder Years (1988) who has a childhood romance with his neighbor

After having not seen each other in over five years, Fred was reunited with his fellow The Wonder Years (1988) cast member Jason Hervey, who played his older brother Wayne when they did a guest spot on the animated series Justice League (2001) in the episode ""Hawk & Dove."" They played, of all things, bickering brothers who were also superheroes

Ranked #27 in VH1's list of the ""100 Greatest Kid Stars""
Danica McKellar ranked #55.
See the complete list in my first comment

Some Interesting facts you may not know about Danica:

Together with her younger sister, Crystal McKellar, she began acting at a young age in her mother's dance studio. In 1982 the family moved to Los Angeles and a few years later she appeared in her first commercial and a few guest appearances in The Twilight Zone (1985) before she went onto Wonder Years.

She is of Scottish and Portuguese descent.

Is now a two-time New York Times bestselling author with books ""Kiss My Math"" (2008) and ""Math Doesn't Suck"" (2007).

Gave birth to her 1st child at age 35, a son Draco Verta on September 7, 2010. Child's father is her estranged husband, Mike Verta.(June 4, 2012) Filed for divorce from Mike Verta, her husband of three years

Wonder Years, like Leave It To Beaver, was on for 6 seasons. Kevin Arnold, like Theodore Cleaver, always found a way to get into trouble with girls or at school. his brother Wayne though was mean and conniving, more like a Eddie Haskell, than a Wally Cleaver, Winnie Cooper was charming and desirable, like  Violet Rutherford and Cheryl Holdridge, who played Wally's girlfriend, Kevin's dad, played by Dan Lauria was always there to give advice, like Ward Cleaver and Kevin's mom. played by Alley Mills was always there to help in any way she could, like June Cleaver.

731457,5,6303918522,"Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) travels thru adolescence with his two best friends -- the brainy Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano) and the rapidly maturing Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) -- in this Emmy-winning comedy-drama set in the late-1960s, early-'70s. The family: older obnoxious brother Wayne (Jason Hervey), rebellious liberal sister Karen (Olivia d'Abo), sweet mom (Alley Mills), and old fashioned dad (Dan Lauria). This landmark series chronicles the challenges of coming of age thru home, school, work, and romance. The series features some fantastic music of the late 60's and early 70's-a trademark of the series. Daniel Stern's narration is warm and funny and the voice-over is never intrusive. This late 80's TV series continues to be enchanting because of its ability to mix comedy and drama with good music in the background.",1350000000,,834,5.374045801526718

731459,5,6303918522,"Awh, what a treat. Without a doubt, this simply was the only television show that ever captured the beauty of living in America. The pilot episode takes us back, not only to 1968, but to every adolescence childhood memory of growing up.

What made the first season so enjoyable, this collection offers 2 episodes of the original six, is that they all inter-twang so perfectly with one another. Both the pilot episode and 'Swingers' portrayed and honest truth to everybody's youth without overdoing the essence of the time period. I often say, '1968' was a great character , something most shows about adolesence never use to there advantage.

When this show originally aired after the Superbowl 1988, narration for the pilot episode was done by Arye Gross. Daniel Stern redid it for its network run and the real 'pilot' seems to had gotten lost along the way. If hope pervails, maybe we could see it again with the original monologue of Kevin and Winnie sharing their only kiss together. I have to say, what a bummer that would had been if they kept that line in. Danica, oh Danica. Well, you know the rest.....

I recommend this tape to all fans of this show. Although some of the songs heard on this aren't the exact original recordings, ( Turn, Turn, Turn, and Young Girl) volume 1's episodes are some of the most brilliantly written and well thought out stories television has ever told. It's a shame no one dares to let the light of day shine with its ultimate release on dvd. Anyone can dream, can't they?",1090972800,18,1511,4.651685393258427
731460,5,6303918522,"You can't help but interject yourself Kevin's life.  He is so relatable.  Also with the narration it makes us think of our own glory days of youth and the important people in our lives.  The first kiss.  First experience with someone dying.  The intrigue of sex ed.  Our best friend and knowing everything about that person.  Nagging brother or sister.  Fighting parents who loved each other and us.  The popular music that defined the era we grew up in.  I'm sure there are special songs that conjure up powerful images from your past just as the special songs from the Wonder Years does the same for each episode.
With the narration of the young Kevin and the 60s setting it reminds me of the movie Christmas Story.  The Messy Marvin actor and the narration of his thoughts/dreams of the Red Ryder bb gun.  Another classic!  But I digres . . .
