8022397,5,B00025923Y,My 6 year old son loves these movies!,1421798400,,37,3.75
8022398,5,B00025923Y,"My husband was a submariner, so when my daughter was born, I bought this for her to see what life was like for Daddy when he was on the boat. My husband has been out of the Navy for 3 years now, and this is still my daughter's favorite video. It's fun and informative for young children who want to see what life is like on a submarine.",1392681600,,336,3.9558823529411766
8022399,5,B00025923Y,Good teaching tool driven towards younger children. Put at their level. I was stationed on this class submarine and got it to show my kids what daddy used to do.,1363046400,,161,4.4
8022400,5,B00025923Y,"My kids (5 and 7) watch this DVD a lot.  Their father was a Navy sonar technician on a submarine, which makes this even more exciting for them.  My husband even agrees with the descriptions of this documentary.  Great for kids.",1356566400,,227,4.487804878048781
8022401,3,B00025923Y,"My grandsons, aged 3 and 5, have enjoyed this video.  The cover might make one think it's a cartoon, but it's actually quite factual, showing the inside of working submarine.  Not a video they'll watch over and over, but they did learn from it and will watch it from time to time.",1254182400,,280,4.365384615384615
8022402,5,B00025923Y,"This movie is wonderful.  I teach 4th grade and also have a son serving on a Trident submarine (the submarine shown on the video).  I use it as a combined Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts lesson.  The kids enjoy the ""science"" lesson they learn, and then are able to use the information they learn to write messages and create artwork to send to my son's crew before they leave on deployments. The language used makes learning about life on a submarine easy to understand, and all the kids have nothing but positive comments when they are finished viewing the movie. They are really concerned about sending the sailors positive messages and want to let them know they appreciate what they do.
A great video and teaching tool!",1237593600,,734,4.71875
8022403,5,B00025923Y,"A great video for kids, narrated by kids.  Contains technical information but does not go over a child's head.  Good for 4 years old up to at least 10 years old.  Even Dad enjoyed it and learned a few new things.  A great family and educational video to watch over and over again.",1123459200,2,280,4.226415094339623
