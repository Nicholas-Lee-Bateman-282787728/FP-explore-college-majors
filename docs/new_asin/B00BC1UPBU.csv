5572444,2,B00BC1UPBU,"???Plot spoilers??? The reason why I question this is because there is a severe lack of plot.

Tania (Kanisha Buss) suspects all men and hates to see anyone happy. She is hanging out with Vicki (Gloria Huwiler) planting ideals in her head that her man Alex (Darric Terry) may be cheating, that she needs to pop into his office unannounced.

As it turns out Tania is correct. Alex is a sex addict, but not a bad guy as he realizes his fault and has asked God for help.

At this point the couple never talk to each other and resolve things in their own camp of friends with the help of God...eventually. That is the film. Grandma (Efe) was an over the top character, afraid of germs. The movie is shot on 4 sets, the office and living room, with minor bedroom and bar scenes. It feels like a play.

There is an Ed Wood moment with Alex's tie. Vicki picks out a blue and white stripe tie for him to wear. That day at the office when Maxi (Yazmin Watkins) shows up he has on a blue and red stripe tie. Later, when Grandma shows up and comments on his tie, it is blue with white dots. That night in the bar, the tie is black.

Perhaps the most ridiculous thing is that Alex keeps a massive black photo album with the word ""CONQUESTS"" on the front. Who does this besides Gene Simmons? Clearly this is playing to a woman's worst fears.

This is a faith based film that didn't hook me. No swear words, sex, or nudity. A little cleavage.",1368230400,7,1428,4.231617647058823
