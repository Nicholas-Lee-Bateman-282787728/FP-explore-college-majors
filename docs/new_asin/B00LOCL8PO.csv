8667387,3,B00LOCL8PO,"I have to admit that this movie got to 3 stars based solely on the 2 actors who play brothers. Milo Ventimiglia and Jonathan Schaech. These 2 men picked up and carried a mediocre story to something a little bit better but even they can't work miracles. Psychological thriller? This same premise has been done better in the past. Very predictable but not that bad. I can't say too much about it, don't want to give anything away. Now for the really bad news. On the Back of the DVD cover they introduce the female of the piece as ""rising star"" Rebecca Da Costa....rising to what? new heights of nausea. A worse actress I have rarely seen, here accent is so thick, I missed most of her dialog, who's girlfriend is she? The producer or the director? She has huge....glands...I guess that is her claim to fame.",1437091200,,806,4.489795918367347
