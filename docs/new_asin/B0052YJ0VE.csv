8454806,2,B0052YJ0VE,The DVD picture quality is fine but THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES ARE HORRIBLE.  The grammar is so incorrect that it difficult to follow the plot of the movie.  They also reference signs and paperwork in the movie which aren't translated at all.  I couldn't give a full review of the quality of the film because the English subtitles are so bad.  Stay away from this DVD version of the film.,1419206400,,383,4.507246376811594
