4671072,1,B005F3XV6C,"I've heard of some of these projects before (particularly the use of a vacuum tube radio to communicate with the ""spirit world"") on other websites.  They have interesting ideas about how to ""communicate"" with the dead, but I've never actually seen video and/or audio footage except bits and pieces that have been provided to JKCinema's paranormal series and others like it.  To actually see the processes in action, however, showed me nothing even remotely conclussive that any of these people can talk to the dead.  And that right there is the biggest flaw of this movie.  It tries so hard to convince the viewer that what they are hearing and/or seeing are voices of the dearly departed that it leaves no room for speculation, even though it is nearly impossible to understand any of the alleged dialogue with the spirits without the aid of the captioning at the bottom of the screen.  In addition, their methods of ""verifying"" some of these techniques for communicating with the dead (by bringing in mediums and other paranormal investigators with equally questionable tools and techniques) hurts the movies cause.  If they're going to prove that this method of communicationg with the dead works, then use confirmed scientific instruments and methods to prove it, instead.  Sorry, but that leaves me giving this video 1 star only.",1365379200,10,1334,5.009049773755656

4671076,5,B005F3XV6C,"I was completely astonished at the irrefutable evidence that this team of paranormal investigators have found! After watching this documentary, I ""KNOW"" that we DO have a soul, and it DOES live on after death! It's only natural, in a sense, because we, as human beings, have that strong desire to live. So, why would it be improbable to believe that the will to survive doesn't stay intact after death? Many people will remain skeptical, but once you watch this particular documentary, even the most die-hard skeptic will scratch their head and ponder the thought and say, hmm, maybe...maybe...",1355443200,2,594,5.01010101010101
4671077,1,B005F3XV6C,"Start with a carnival barker / infomercial-style host. Take a couple of camera shots of Rupert Sheldrake staring into a microscope for no apparent reason. Throw in some 'actual footage' from the Scole Experiments. Then toss in a lot of simulated footage and actual audio coupled with simulated images overlaid onto 'actual video'.
 Start flipping back and forth between actual and simulated states so frequently that the viewer loses track of which is which, then wrap it all up in a cheesy tabloid style package, and you'll have a movie called the Afterlife Investigations.

 The best thing I can say about this decidedly unscientific endeavor is that it might be worth a $1.99 rental on a rainy afternoon, but I wouldn't buy it to keep around the house. Someone I respect might come by one day and see me with it.  :-)",1349395200,9,820,4.753521126760563

4671114,4,B005F3XV6C,"I thought the Afterlife Investigations was an interesting approach.  It seemed to follow more the ""Spiritualist"" approach rather than a more scientific approach.  I was sure that the presenters were sincere in their approach, but I must admit I still remain a little skeptical that we really can communicate with those who have past.  I am not sure how you can separate apport's and other events from some more likely psychic event than a spiritual event.  Well worth watching though.",1383264000,,484,5.0125
4671115,3,B005F3XV6C,"Interesting video but unconvincing. The problem I have with what was presented as evidence is that logic tells me that it is improbable. This is why:
The ghostly images and voices (EVP) seem to present themselves as they were when they were alive. Logic tells me that this is highly improbable from a scientific viewpoint because as the physical body goes through stages of development (babyhood, childhood, etc.), we cease to be the one we were in previous stages. We can never go back to being exactly the same we were before. For instance, just as a caterpillar transmutes into a butterfly, it becomes a different being (and consciousness) that can't ever go back to being a caterpillar.
Therefore, when our body dies, we transmute into a different being with new consciousness and memories (not just a different plane of existence) and cease to be who we were when we were alive.
Therefore, the physical manifestation of ghosts as the image they had while alive is highly improbable.
Moreover, regarding recorded or broadcasted voices (EVP), there are specific physical elements that we need to produce a voice and other sounds: vocal cords and voice box organs. Those elements are part of our physical body and are lost at the time of death. Therefore, how can ghostly voices be recorded or broadcasted without the physical elements to do so? How would they remain the same?
There might be life after death but I don't believe that we remain the same after we go through the passage. To start anew, we need to leave the old behind, which includes memories, consciousness, and feelings.
These facts make it hard for me to believe that this film is irrevocable proof of life after death. We'll find out in its due time.",1381190400,2,1722,4.801346801346801

4671117,5,B005F3XV6C,"Yes this is evidence of the after life. Yes these things should not logically happen if there is no after life. Yes the events recorded are statistically unlikely to happen by chance. In short this does appear to be a good scientific investigation of the after life. Use the ""scientific method"" and you'll notice all this is evidence in favor of their hypothesis that there is an after life. As layman we are constantly confused by the word proof, mostly because are partial understanding and intuition isn't strong enough to detect the truth of matters like these. Especially so, since if it were true, what extreme consequences it would have on are lives! If this documentary isn't just fluff made up by the film makers it does show us some very convincing evidence in favor of an after life.",1379462400,2,794,4.719424460431655

4671142,5,B005F3XV6C,"this was a fascinating movie.  not only did it cover ways to communicate with those who have passed, but it showed various experiments that had positive results that were just amazing.  easy to understand.  made by credible scientists, and those who are well known in this field of study.  Experiments were done so that accurate results were reliable, not fake.  I highly recommend if you have questions about the afterlife, or someone you love has recently left this world for the afterlife, that you see this movie  it is not scarey, or intended to inflame lies about this subject, or do anything more than explain what is known at this time in history about where we go once we leave our human bodies.  HIGHLY Recommend.  However, use discretion  when watching.  Do not show this to a child, or person younger than 14  years old.  It could be life changing for them, as I am sure it will be for you!",1366243200,3,902,4.56875

Then again, if anything is outside of normal perception and conventional science, it's too easy for the cynic to scream, FRAUD, FRAUD!!

The editor constantly duplicated the person interviewed several times, (talk about fluff), to the point of boring. The Editor(s) should get an award for redundancy!!!
Another point, in the ""Editorial Review"" they mention renouned Psychic Allison Dubois- she only gets about 1 or 2 minutes time, as compared to Psychic Marcello Bacci Who uses electronic devices to secure spirits, they give too much time to.

8469537,5,B005F3XV6C,"This is a truly remarkable documentary that covers the sorely overlooked and often ignored topic of physical mediumship.

In 1993, four individuals sat in a private circle, hoping to stimulate spiritual activity and communicate with the ""other side"". They sat twice a week. For the better part of a year, they experienced little to no activity, and then things changed rapidly and dramatically. What occurred is arguably the most profound experience in physical mediumship ever recorded. The activity experienced was carefully documented and shared with hundreds of sitters over a number of years.

Multiple ""entities"" provided instructions that resulted in documenting some amazing evidence. Canisters of unopened film rolls, carefully guarded by a third party, were developed to find the entire roll exposed with astonishing images, writings, hieroglyphics, poems, plans, and drawings. This was later expanded to video. Over the years, nearly 100 apports dropped into the room with a loud ""THUD"". These apports ranged from pristine newspapers from the 1940s to money, jewelry, and even roses. Wild lights danced and spun around the room in a flurry, often touching individuals and entering and exiting their body, all captured on video. Levitations, voices, ethereal hands touching sittersthe breadth of experiences were amazing.

It is so fantastical, on the surface, it sounds unbelievable, which is probably why the mainstream public and media are unaware of this remarkable history. The intent of the documentary is not to convert or convince but to convey and report. It's a fascinating documentary that makes you think. Whether you decide to believe is entirely up to you.

The group started as a small circle of four that met in a blacked-out basement--known as the Scole Hole--in Scole, England in 1993. A few years later they toured to share the experience, eventually arriving in America in the late '90s. In 1998, the spiritual activity abruptly stopped. For approximately five years, over 1,000 hours of activity and communication was recorded. This documentary shows this activity. It also contains interviews with the four circle members; members of the scientific community who attended and scrutinized the occurrences; witnesses who sat with the circle, stunned at what they experienced; members of the Society for Psychical Research who documented the events; and others who had association with the Scole Experiment.

Along with the Scole activity, this video also documents the instrumental transcommunication (ITC) work of Marcello Bacci. Bacci is a world authority on the use of electronic instrumentation (radios and recording devices) to communicate with spiritual entities and has been actively influential in this field for over thirty-five years. His work has been studied in strict, scientifically controlled settings. This video briefly profiles his work.

The two individuals who are considered the mediums of the circle--Alan and Diana Bennett--have since ventured into a new set of experiments using cameras, photographic equipment and video, with crystals, lights, and filters. This work will be documented in a new book with a working title of The Norfolk Experiment.

A book has also been written that documents the Scole Experiment, and it can be found here on Amazon. Having also read the book (long before this documentary was released), I highly recommend it.

If you're interested in evidential documentaries about the afterlife, this documentary is a must watch!",1433203200,,3504,5.452029520295203

Some of the experiments performed would have been more compelling with video documentation of scientists over-seeing the experiment. So I don't think it rises to the level of proof positive, but what is presented should be enough to grab the interest of hard scientists to investigate further. As a film, the photography, editing and sound are top notch and at a very professional level. And if you have interest in ghosts or the possibility of a soul, this film should be right up your alley.
