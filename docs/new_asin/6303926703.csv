733128,5,6303926703,"You'll read ""Party Movie,"" ""Outrageous,"" and ""Wickedly Funny"" on the outside of the keep case, but the movie ""Unzipped"" deserves a much more dignified description as a smartly filmed and edited documentary with an alluringly exotic flavor.  Isaac Mizrahi's talent, creativity and personality are wonderfully revealed in this excellent view into one small, but glamorous corner of the fashion world.
""Unzipped"" revolves around the making of a fashion show, beginning with Isaac reading the reviews of the just completed (Spring 1994) and ending with him reading the reviews of the one we see him create (Fall 1994, the subject of the movie).  I became enamored of so many aspects of this movie:  Isaac's passion for all things glamorous, his acute attention to detail in cinematic portrayals, his relationship with family and business associates, the modeling experience, and the show itself.  The filming alternates between black-and-white to color, in a manner which differentiates between intimacy and all-access reportage.  There is so much that meets the eye.
I truly believe that anyone would be interested in Isaac as a person inasmuch as his creative character fits so perfectly into the realm of design and glamour.  His presence is at once dominating and yet so dependent upon the whims of a fickle business filled with unpredictable turns of events.  Ideas come from everywhere:  movies, television, dreams, and images of performance art.  The viewer literally sees a fashion show evolve from concept to performance, and witnesses all the twists and turns in between.
From Amber to Yasmeen, virtually all of the top models of the mid-90's are involved.  But, the best ""behind-the-seems"" experience is what Altman couldn't capture quite right in ""Pret-a-Porter"":  the backstage goings-on prior to, and during, the actual fashion show.
Although only 73 minutes (and no DVD extras), it's pure enjoyment all the way through.",1076112000,3,1930,5.315789473684211
733129,5,6303926703,"Unzipped is intentionally and unintentionally hilarious. It's real life caught on celluloid, even though few of our lives revolve around putting on a fashion show, chatting with Sandra Bernhardt (thank god), or having to deal with capricious super-models.
Mizrahi is eccentric and entirely loveable. I bought this movie for my wife who LOVES fashion and hair and, well, all that dreck. Still, I enjoy this movie too. While not taking itself too seriously, the film exposes much of what passes for normal conversation and attitude in the world of the rich and fashion paranoid.
In the end, the designer, though flamboyant, comes across more as an artisan. He's really dedicated to his trade and loves the path he's taken. His Jewish ""coffee-talk"" mother hovers around the picture as an eternal reminder that the famous Mizrahi was once just a little boy who liked to shop for fabric with money he pinched out of her purse.
The film is also a valuable reminder to those of us who covet fame and fortune. Oftentimes, when you gain fame, whether as a designer, a writer or a musician, much of your time is suddenly taken up with the marketing and selling of your product. This leaves you very little time to do what you really love.",1011312000,5,1228,4.769953051643192
733130,5,6303926703,"Explosively funny and seductive, ""Unzipped"" is a clever comedy somewhere between Robert Altman's ""Pret--porter"" and ""In bed with Madonna"", with a classy  cast, a great soundtrack and delightful guests appearances. EARTHA KITT highlights the moovie with an outrageous and very glamourous sequence. Fun!",979689600,2,301,6.0
733131,5,6303926703,"A must-see and perhaps must-have movie for anyone that is into fashion, models, and documentaries.  We follow designer Isaac Mizrahi after a collection which had received horrendous reviews, as he tries to not only  regain his confidence, but to also design his next line of clothing.  I  really liked the fact that most of the film is shot in b/w which is  intertwined with bursts of grainy-color scenes.  The film is especially  interesting now that Mizhrahi's line has been discontinued.  Mizrahi is  perhaps one of the brightest most unknown personalities around, and  Unzipped is not only an excellent peek into the fashion world, but also  into the man himself.",915667200,5,667,5.027522935779817
733296,4,6303926703,I gave this to my girlfriend's 17 year old daughter who hopes to be a fashion designer. It was a big hit with her and her gal-pals!,1283385600,,131,3.888888888888889
733297,4,6303926703,"In 1995, Isaac Mizrahi, his A-list supermodels, and celebs like Sandra Bernhard were a fabulous sight to see working behind the scenes. How would they interact? Where does each find key inspiration? What past events brought them to this position? What do they wear? Are they as nice as they appear? We learn all this and more.

But a decade later, I am more fascinated at the quiet presence in this movie of people who have since become semi-famous:

Robert Best, from Season 3 of Project Runway, is present throughout Unzipped as Mizrahi's unsung assistant. Tricia Helfer of Battlestar Galactica and Padma Lakshmi of Top Chef appear as then-unknown models. Mizrahi praises another ever-present assistant, Nina, but we learn little about her.

Thanks to shows and movies such as Project Runway, The Devil Wears Prada, and Ugly Betty, audiences know more about fashion than they did in 1994. And so, while respecting that only so much ground could be covered in one movie, I am left wanting to know a bit more about the activities and inspirations of the workers that made Mizrahi's success possible.

This information as well as followup information about Mizrahi and the supermodels could have been provided as extras on the DVD but sadly, the DVD has no extras.",1197331200,,1263,4.915492957746479
733298,4,6303926703,"Fashions move through this movie (1995) as they did 12 years later with The Devil Wears Prada.  And the stars of Unzipped are still in the fashion and celebrity news today, 2007, providing this zippy movie with an enduring quality.

In 2007 who has not heard of Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evengelista?  And here they are in Unzipped with unabashed glamour and style.

For that reason alone the movie is worth watching, and the DVD worth keeping in your library for later viewing.  One thing is for certain - the stars of Unzipped are not going away and will be in the Celebrity news for many years to come.

And you can decide - have fashions changed so much in 12 years?  Be the judge.",1174176000,,708,4.484375
733299,5,6303926703,"Not only becasue he is a fellow New Yorker, I feel Mr. Mizrahi is one of the best fasion designers. More props to him.",1171670400,,118,3.9583333333333335
733300,5,6303926703,"Oh, how I love this movie.  I originally saw it in one the art house movie theaters here in Denver and was just laughing to tears half of the time.  I love Isaac Mizrahi, and this movie is the primary reason why.  Why is this man not my best friend?

This movies is the perfect mix of haute couture, the characters that inhabit the fashion world, Isaac's witty sensibility, the most amazing soundtrack, and great camera and directing work from Isaac's then boyfriend, Douglas Keeve.  I love all of Isaac's references and influences.  I want to call him irreverent, but in actuality he is anything but.  He holds his influences in such high regard, and his fashions are always executed as a respectful nod to those social and pop cultural trigger points.

Even if you know nothing about fashion, or even Isaac himself, I would recommend this movie on its exceptional eye candy alone.  This movie is a time capsule for the early 90's reign of the supermodel.  Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista (warning! you'll never be able to get Linda's grating, shrieking voice out of your head after seeing this), Carla Bruni, Amber Valleta, Patricia Velasquez and Shalom Harlow are all here, front and center, working Isaac's catwalk.

LOVED Polly Mellon in this.  She and Isaac's interactions are hilarious.  And I loved when Isaac and Amber were talking about Polly and her ""this changes everything"" catch phrase.  Why is she no longer with Allure magazine?  Did she just retire?  I pray she didn't pass away.

And I'm sorry for John, the previous reviewer, who was extremely disappointed with Patricia Velasquez's brief appearance in this documentary.  John, you do know that Patricia is gay and that she and Sandra Bernhard dated for some time (presumably they met through Isaac since Sandra is prominently featured as Isaac's friend and confident), allegedly, don't you?  Not saying you can't still have love for the girl, but still, FYI in case you didn't know.",1148083200,2,1981,4.894894894894895
733301,1,6303926703,"Well this was apparently supposesd to be funny, I don't think so.  What a waste of money.  It said that Patricia Velasquez was staring in it, main motive for purchase, she appears briefly before she goes on the catwalk and for a few seconds at the end.

733302,5,6303926703,"A season in the life of former fashion designer, Isaac Mizrahi, as documented by his (then) boyfriend/director/former-Sundance-Film-Fest-Darling, Douglas Keeve. Opening with Mizrahi reading a devastating review in *Womens Wear Daily* of his most recent collection, it is a heartbreaking moment that only artists really understand. But unflattering criticism is part of the ballgame, and Mizrahi rolls with the punches. There is no time to wallow - there's another collection to be designed, and we watch as Mizrahi looks for inspiration in a variety of sources, eventually becoming most inspired by the idea of basing his Fall collection on the 1935 film *Call of the Wild* and 1922s *Nanook of the North*. What seems such an unlikely course becomes magic as we watch the rough ideas of suede boots and fuzzy jackets transform themselves into a cohesive statement of winter luxury that is completely modern. We watch the details being refined, the fabrics being selected, and most amusingly, the fittings being done with the Holy Trinity of supermodels, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington. We see Evangelista exactly as we expect to - the biggest diva of them all - whining of being discriminated against in shoe selection. This is the woman who once said, ""[We] don't get out of bed for less than $10,000,"" but the power she brings to the runway appears to make her worth every penny. We feel the utter despair that Mizrahi feels as he reads that Jean-Paul Gaultier has just unveiled his own Eskimo-themed collection. We see Mizrahi try to persuade the models to undress behind a backlit scrim during the show, and some of them pointedly refusing. But the ones that do, become a stunning backdrop for a knock-out show. The documentary runs full-circle, ending with Mizrahi reading a fabulous review of his excellent collection. It is a film rife with stereotypes of fashionistas, but these stereotypes, like most, have sprung forth from a good bit of truth. And given what is perceived to be the shallowest of milieus, it is a very touching story combining the elements of creativity, criticism, hope and redemption. Mizrahi, whose eponymous fashion house closed a few years ago, entertains in front of the camera, as well as designs, and the constantly revolving cast of characters is a Who's Who of late-90s fashion magazines. It is Keeve's first project and was a critical success, presciently capturing Mizrahi at the peak of his career, and the fashion world in one of its most decadent eras. Though neither Mizrahi nor Keeve have attained such prominence since *Unzipped*, is even more special because of it. It was the right combination of the right qualities at the right time that garnered the film and its participants such attention, but, in retrospect, it is a moment that is bound to burst like a garishly elegant soap bubble.",1106438400,12,2862,5.040084388185654
733303,5,6303926703,"You can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't really remember hearing about any fashion documentaries before ""Unzipped.""  I have heard about (and seen) documentaries about theatre, the ballet, actors on location during a filmshoot, artists and musicians.  Of course, fashion is, in and of itself, a form of theatre, as well as a dance with actors (aka models) and artists (aka fashion designers) on location, presenting to us, the unsuspecting audience, high drama incomparable to none.  I am speaking, of course, of the runway show.  The high drama that goes into the preparation for this ""clothing revue"" that can make or break the career of a fashion designer is truly brought to the foreground, through the eyes of Isaac Mizrahi, the irrepressible New York fashion designer.

This film presents to us a glimpse of the kind of blood, sweat and tears that goes into preparing for a major fashion show.  Also, we get a better sense of Isaac Mizrahi, the man, and not only Isaac Mizrahi, the artist.  We learn of his penchant for Mary Tyler Moore reruns, quoting obscure lines from cult films, wildly practicing classical piano in the privacy of his own home, where his inspiration comes from for themes in his fashion collections (the Inuit documentary, ""Nanook of the North,"" wallpaper from a French bistro, and 200 year old French evening wear, consulting Tarot card readers, just to name a few examples).  We learn that he used to steal money from his mother's purse to purchase material in order to make designs when he was four years old.  All of these charming (and curious) personality quirks are presented with broad humor, full acceptance toward his eccentric and unusual tendencies and are also woven with footage from his studio, with his numerous assistances, in the company of models and celebrity friends (including Sara Bernhardt, Roseanna Arnold, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and the internationally known dancer and choreographer, Mark Morris).

Though, I can already tell you, this film might not be for all tastes, it was definitely to my liking!  It's great for a laugh and you even learn something about the fashion industry!  I am really glad that he has made his fashions affordable for the rest of us who can't afford to fork over $500 for evening wear.",1102118400,,2279,4.921671018276762
733304,5,6303926703,"This is a film, that I've watched over, and over, and over.  Because I never get enough of it.  Everyone in this film is crediable to watch --- and you get a honest (and funny) look at the models, and major players in the Fashion World.  This film gives an eye-opening look at the ""true"" nature of creating a collection, and the adversity a designer can face.  Issac, reveals his sincere soul in this movie.

As Polly would say; It opened my eye.....and it erases, everything!""  Miss Kitt, had me cracking up, Issac, gives an amazing collection.  Niomi,  showed the down-to-Earth side of her beautiful nature -- and is embeccable.  Linda, had me rolling with laughter --- while (funny) plucking Issac's nerves during his show. And Kate, placed her signature into runway 'walking'.  And Issac's mother ---- with an inspirational and supportive mother like her, you can't go wrong in life.  His ""94 Fall\Winter collection is superior.  Katty, Polly, and Leon are ""key"" personalities like no other.  And I couldn't conclude this review without mentioning; Sandrah Bernhard's adds' ""flavor"" and her opening song --- at the beginning of the film, and the opening song for the fashion show --- sets' the theme of the entire film.

I have always been fascinated by the fashion industry and always wanted to get involved. Isaac's passion for the creative process inspired me into applying to the fashion institute. I love how it's mostly in black and white, it feels like an old movie. The backround music and random home movies of Isaac's childhood are charming and very comical. After watching this you want to become best friends with him because his personality shines and you feel somehow close the artistic side of him.

Unzipped (1995) **1/2 / 4 -- Recommended viewing
D: Douglas Keeve
C: Isaac Mizrahi, Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Sandra Bernhard, Eartha Kitt, Christy Turlington, Amber Valletta, Shalom Harlow, Richard Gere, Liza Minnelli, Faye Dunaway
P: Documentary following the trails and tribulations of Isaac Mizrahi as he gets ready to present his fall collection in 1994.

Lively documentary comes alive with energy & momentum. Unzipped offers an entertaining behind the scenes look at the world of fashion complete with drama, heartbreak, bi*chyness and glory.

However, Unzipped never really raises above being nothing more then pure fluff. While the film goes into the thought process of how Isaac Mizrahi gets inspired to design a collection, Unzipped never fully delves into where his passion for fashion stems from, what makes him tick or what makes him who he is today. There is also a certain distance, because viewers mainly only get to see Isaac in his business dealings. There isn't enough scenes showing Isaac in his own personal life.

In order for viewers to feel intimately connected to a character, they need a complete portrait of that person. Unzipped only gives viewers half the scoop into who Isaac Mizrahi is. Still, for those that love fashion pure and simple, Unzipped is pretty spot on its portrayal of the industry and there is, of course, plenty of celeb cameos to help maintain interest throughout. Unzipped delivers on being an amusing portrait into the world of fashion, but it fails to deliver a more meaningful glimpse into its central figure - Isaac Mizrahi.
