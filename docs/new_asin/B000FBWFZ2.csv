8120487,5,B000FBWFZ2,This film deserves credit for its masterful choreography and well filmed scenes. This rare Shaw bros gem is a must own kung fu flick from a long lost era of kung fu movie classics. Don't hesitate to pick this one up if you are a fan of the old school kung fu films. Highly recommended.,1393200000,,285,4.2
8120488,5,B000FBWFZ2,"momkey kung fu AKA stroke of death is one of the best shaw bros movies. The kung fu rarely lets up and its all high quality action. The monkey style here is some of the best ive seen. Like a shaw film the sets are good, great re-masterd quality....I know, I suck at writing reviews.",1222905600,,282,4.1454545454545455
8120489,5,B000FBWFZ2,"In the late 70s, early 80s, director Lo Mar shot a handful of decent movies for Shaw Brothers.  This one, along with ""Five Superfighters"", are two of my favorites.  ""Stroke of Death"", original title ""Monkey Kung Fu"", is expertly choreographed by Ching Siu-Tung and wouldn't ya know it, he's the star of it too.  Ching is probably best known for directing & choreographing his ""A Chinese Ghost Story"" trilogy, ""The Heroic Trio"" films and, most recently, his incredible choreography on Jet Li's ""Hero"" several years ago.  Here he delivers the goods old-school style, aided not only by director Lo & screenwriter Szeto An, but also by real-life Monkey style expert Hao Chao-Sheng (who acted as martial arts advisor) & Lo regular Kuan Fung, who shows here that he's one of the best pole fighters around.  Check Kuan out also in Chang Cheh's ""Flag of Iron"" as killer ""the fortune teller"" & at the end of ""Ten Tigers of Kwangtung.""

I don't want to give away too much of the story; besides, plot synopsis' never really register unless you actually see the film.  Let's just say Ching's character, Wei Chung, has something in his possession that villain Kuan Fung wants and co-star Hao Chao-Sheng wants but with different intentions.  Eventually, the reasons are revealed, which lead to Ching & Hao teaming up, learning White Monkey style (an authentic style in the Monkey Boxing system), & gearing up for a final showdown with Kuan and his men.  Tremendous performances by all, look for cameos by fellow choreographer Hsiung Kuang a.k.a. Leung Siu-Hung, Lin Hui-Huang and female kicker Wong Mei-Mei.  Numerous amazing martial fights, comedy that's actually funny, real Monkey kung fu and this all culminates in a final battle that will leave you exhausted.

As far as the DVD goes; crisp, blemish-free picture & widescreen.  It's only in English, but it's the good ""Drive-In Movie"" voices.  It switches to Cantonese for four small moments that weren't shown in the U.S. release, but those scenes are subtitled.  In fact, the whole movie, despite being in English, has optional English subtitles that are slightly different but tell the same story.  This was released by Red Sun, and as usual with that company ~ great picture, decent audio, but no special features on this one.  If you're a fan of either Shaw Brothers, Ching Siu-Tung or both, plunk down $11.24 and get this.  Trust me.",1206230400,2,2380,4.91
