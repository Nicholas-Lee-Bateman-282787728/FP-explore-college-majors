The story is fine its the graphical aspect of the movie. Most older movie that are converted from vhs to dvd are set to fit your lcd or plasma tv. However those dvd's aren't. Most of the time you would see 2 black thick lines between the images if it's an old movie, but this one, its 4 thick black lines, like the shape of your old TV which the ratio was 4:3. Makes the character smaller on screen.

I am waiting for the other supposedly remastered version dvd's of Asterix and the 12 tasks and see how it will come out. Hopefully it will look better.",1257984000,6,730,4.069444444444445
