1355874,4,B00004UB6Q,"Not having read the book (though I plan to now), I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.  I found the movie to be well-made and intriguing,  although it left some questions which I hope will be answered in the book.  I can't discuss specifics without spoiling the movie, and I realize that a  two-hour show must omit some details, but those omissions are the reason  for my rating.  Sigourney Weaver is fantastic as a mother nearly  overwhelmed by her responsiblities, but her character's stubbornness kept  me on edge, wondering what she would do next to jeopardize her own  well-being.  The sisters who portray Weaver's daughters in the show do an  impressive job, as well, particularly the oldest, who, as Emma, grows and  changes convincingly as her world comes down around her.  It's a powerful  movie, with poignant performances by the lead actors and an impressive  supporting cast.",965347200,7,895,4.912751677852349

1355900,3,B00004UB6Q,It's just a tragedy in this movie. Anything can happen at any given moment in time. Forgiveness plays a part in our everyday lives. At least everyone was able to move past the tragedy and look at the bigger picture. Sad to say sometimes these things happen in the real world. We just have to embrace and learn from our mistakes. I would recommend anyone to watch this movie to past time.,1400284800,,387,4.388888888888889

1355918,3,B00004UB6Q,"A Map of the World (Sigourney Weaver, Julianne Moore, David Strathairn & Chloe Sevigny) is a movie about the difficulties encountered by most people at sometime in their lives, add a tragic child's death & then what happens when false allegations are added to that stress & you get this movie. Those who have raised children & those responsible for children's welfare know very well how you can be pushed to the brink of your limits by these circumstances. Inappropiate speech intended to be humor can easily creep into the attempt to maintain ones equilibrium & sanity.

The strange thing about this show is that it has a very believable beginning. Powerful, extemely well acted & constructed. The quality of the acting continues throughout the movie & sometimes the power of the story resurfaces. The street police procedural & courtroom scenes are sadly laughable. That is especially strange as the prison scenes are, just like the beginning, well constructed.

I feel the Director is to blame for this not being a top-flight movie throughout. This could of been a tour de force movie but the inconsistent flow of the story as well the scenes obviously constructed simply to play on the emotions we all have make it far less than favorable in my estimation.

I could easily rate this as a 1 star movie for it's faults but the good portions are better than good, they are great. An overall rating of 3 stars for a movie that isn't true to life but needed to stay closer to that than it did. 5 star acting all around by this cast. They did better than what they were given to work with. If you like emotional manipulation you'll like this. If not I would stay away. I know I'll never watch it again & be glad I didn't.",1320278400,3,1719,4.592833876221499
1355919,2,B00004UB6Q,"I was really disappointed in this movie.  So disappointed, in fact, that I couldn't watch more than the first third of the movie (I kept hoping it would get better).  The overall feel of the movie was flat.  I don't know if it was the way it was filmed or the lack of background music in many parts, but I couldn't get into the emotion that should have come with the movie.  Some of the scripting was preposterous such as when some investigators just show up at a school meeting.  That just didn't ring true.  After that, I quit watching.  I couldn't imagine that things would get better.",1315267200,,588,4.388888888888889
1355920,5,B00004UB6Q,"""I came to this DVD because I have cherished the soundtrack album by guitarist Pat Metheny since it first came out. It contains simply some of the most beautiful and touching music I have heard in the past few years. The soundtrack album is also a fanstastic companion to the book by Jane Hamilton, because on the album (which is expanded by almost a half an hour beyond the music in the film) Metheny really tells Hamilton's tale without words.""

1355921,3,B00004UB6Q,"I was not really impressed with the acting or directing of this movie.  Think me a prude, but I did not see any reason for the nudity and lovemaking in this type of movie.  I did not hate the movie, but I thought with the cast of stars it would be better.  I don't understand why directors think these types of movies need nudity.  I would have thought Sigourney Weaver would have fought not to have these scenes.  To me, the character did not seem to worry enough.  I also didn't understand why such a young child would say she hated her mother so much.  I've only seen teenagers hate their parents, not a child so young.  The director did not pull this movie off.  Sorry, it was a pretty good movie, but I figured with those actors, it would have been a much better movie.",1313366400,,774,4.2465753424657535

Sigourney Weaver is Awful , a very stilted performance, awkward and spooky, slow, not moving, unsympathetic, not at all how i would have cast it. so i didn't watch it to the end. someone told me several yrs ago that it wasn't good but i wanted to see for myself.
sorry i invested in it, should have looked for a rental, but even that would've been too much money for this pic.",1206748800,,598,4.2
1355923,5,B00004UB6Q,"We all know it but most of us labor to ignore it - disaster dogs our every step and falls from grace don't come with parachutes.  Alice Goodwin, played brilliantly by Sigourney Weaver, lives on a farm with husband Howard, David Strathairn.  She works as a school nurse and is raising two, often difficult, daughters almost single-handedly.  When her friend Theresa, Julianne Moore, drops her two girls off for a play date, it's a mundane, domestic situation.  Moments later one of Theresa's daughters drowns in Alice's pond and life is irrevocably altered.

Alice's innocence, and the knowledge that something like this could happen to anyone anytime, helps no one - least of all Alice - and changes everything.  Suddenly her activities as school nurse are called into question, careless, sarcastic comments are seen in a new light, mob rule - with all of its inherent stupidity, appears - and the judicial system's gears begin grinding.  Before long Alice is in jail, which is both a safe-haven from the real world's unbearable torment and an ideal delivery mechanism for the punishment she craves.  Ultimate exoneration achieves almost nothing; this movie is far too real to sell you that cheap.  After all, lurid accusations always appear on the paper's front page while retractions are buried far in the back with the garden supply ads.

A Map Of The World is mercurial; it keeps evading your grasp.  That's thrilling, because most movies are so predictable.  In large part this is because of Alice herself, a smart, feisty woman who speaks first and thinks later, a woman who wants life to work as it should and doesn't feel like doing the schmoozing and nice-making it takes to keep people happy.  We know her, we care for her, and we fear for her, because - like so many people who are their own worst enemies - it galls her to ""play the game.""  In our hearts we know that attitude can work when everything's going your way, but after the fall from grace, a little ""go along to get along"" is considered good form.

The film belongs to Weaver; she is credible and strong in every frame.  Moore's expression of maternal grief is unforgettable.  But the sleeper performance here is David Strathairn.  As a quiet man hurled into extraordinary situations he gives a clinic on the notion that all great acting is re-acting - brilliant.  Even the soundtrack, by jazz icon Pat Metheny, shines.  A Map Of The World reminds you that film, in the right hands, can be art.",1196467200,,2467,4.76
1355924,3,B00004UB6Q,"I know this film is based on a popular novel but it almost felt like there was too much story here.  Two families dealing with the tragic death of a daughter in the other's care (one movie).  A woman unjustly thrown into jail with other ""baby-killer"" women (another movie).  A courtroom drama of fighting sexual abuse charges (yet another movie).

A MAP OF THE WORLD nearly pulls off all of these storylines...except Sigourney Weaver's character keeps confounding us with distracting and even frustrating lines and actions.

Don't get me wrong: I love Sigourney Weaver.  I loved her in ALIEN, I loved and lusted after her in HALF MOON STREET (and GHOSTBUSTERS).  I loved her in GORILLAS IN THE MIST.  I even remember falling for her the first time I saw her in 1981's EYEWITNESS.

And she's outstanding here.  Even playing a difficult woman like this character, you sit back and watch, amazed.  But this character makes it hard to root for and like her sometimes.  This obviously works for a lot of reviewers here, but the story takes too many twists and turns that you end up wanting to throw your hands up at (at least) one point (and it's a courtroom scene).

I don't know how the book reads, but there are several times that Sigourney's character has so much contempt for country folk--like when she's pratically sneering at a priest arriving at the hospital to comfort Julianne Moore's family--that I could see where viewers would lose sympathy for her.  David Straitharn's husband remains aloof and wounded but never really lets us in.  I don't know.  No easy answers with these characters.  Kind of like life....

So obviously this is one of those movies where it doesn't matter what I say or all the other reviews: you may like or dislike this film, but it will challenge you.

The overall cast is great.  I really enjoyed Arliss Howard's attorney.

But if you enjoy Sigourney Weaver, definitely check this out.",1191024000,,1919,4.754545454545455
1355935,4,B00004UB6Q,"This film was hugely overlooked and underappreciated.  The performances are honest and very real.  The story of a woman who, through a series of horrific incidents, misconceptions and misunderstandings, loses everything including herself.  Sigourney Weaver portrays this broken down human being with humility and elegance.  Weaver is all at once, strong, emotionally unavailable, depressed, sad, scarey, loving, supportive and charged.  This is an Oscar performance if there ever was one.  The style in which Weaver illuminates her character is completely different than any other performance in any of her other films (Aliens, Gorillas In The Mist, The Ice Storm).
The story is challenging, but the rewards are fascinating.",1183507200,,724,5.657407407407407
1355936,3,B00004UB6Q,"I have to agree with those who thought this movie was well done. I also have to side with those who found it frustrating and confusing at certain times. I can't blame this frustration and confusion on Sigourney Weaver though. I had to place it on the direction. There were times I felt as though the character was intentionally trying to punish herself. In the courtroom, the visitor's section of the jail. Maybe it's me, but I just didn't know at times which way the direction of the character was going.

The film is worth seeing and, despite what others may say, the actors played their parts very well.",1173744000,,606,4.559633027522936
1355937,3,B00004UB6Q,"Sigourney Weaver gives an excellent performance as Alice Goodwin, a woman who undergoes trying times when a friend's child dies while under her care, followed soon after by charges of child abuse against her by members of the small community in which she lives.  This is a well-made, sincere film, but I couldn't help feeling that it was just trying to pile on too much drama.  I was frustrated by the introduction of the child abuse angle and Alice's subsequent prison stay because I felt that the film had never dealt adequately with the horror of the dead child and all of the emotional consequences of it.  The parents simply moved away so we could get into the next crisis before their return.  Jane Hamilton probably handled this more successfully in her novel, which was the basis of this film, because she didn't have the time constraints of a movie.",1118448000,2,858,4.7
1355938,4,B00004UB6Q,"I honestly found this movie to be disarming, mostly because of Sigourney Weaver's performance as an unapologetic and perhaps too honest and too direct woman whose very regular life unravels under tragic consequences and the scrutiny that comes afterward. Weaver plays Alice, a school nurse, wife of a Wisconsin farmer, who comes off as coarse, abrasive and unmannered. This makes very little difference at first, except that she might be something of an outsider. This, however, bears a great deal of difference, when, while babysitting for her best friend Theresa (Julianne Moore), one of Theresa's children drowns. Ultimately Alice is scrutinized following this accident, and later is held legally accountable for charges of child abuse made against her.

The story delves very deeply into the three-dimensional characters in this film; a psychological and adult film that probes various dimensions of its character's lives very effectively. Weaver's Alice particularly has the greatest burden to bear, the most weakness and frailty but at the same time the most strength. She is stripped to bare bones (from a psychological standpoint) in jail, and though she has to be strong and resolute to live there, the aftermath of the events reveal immediate impacts on her family (her husband has been content to run the farm and leave the daily life business to her; suddenly he is confronted with rearing their children, whom he hardly seems to know, and coming up with ways to handle the mounting legal bills, etc.) Relationships are tested in the film (both relationships people have with themselves as well as relationships between people), and the performances delivered by Weaver, David Strathairn as her husband and Moore as the grieving mother, Theresa, are deeply felt, human performances.",1111622400,2,1794,5.2727272727272725
1355939,5,B00004UB6Q,"I actually bought this movie because I enjoyed the soundtrack CD by Pat Metheny so much, and because the reviews here on Amazon are favorable.  I got more than I expected from this movie.  It's so good that Metheny's music is overwhelmed by the drama.  I won't go into summarizing the plot, as several other reviewers have done that very well.

If only Sigourney had kept her clothes on, this would be a perfect film for almost the whole family.  She delivers an excellent performance, as do Julianne Moore and David Strathairn.  The gratuitous sex scenes and home sex video banter amongst the couples should have been left on the cutting room floor to improve the movie.  I saw enough of Sigourney in the movie Alien...not that I'm complaining!

This movie highlights how pack-driven we as a people can be in damning innocent people.  You see it often in newspapers and magazines.  That said, if I were in her place I would be racked with guilt at having let the little girl out of my sight long enough for her to reach that body of water next to their house.  It's not like the pond just suddenly appeared at dawn.  Heck, a fence only costs a couple of hundred bucks to put up yourself.

Buy it, enjoy it, have a good cry, but keep your finger ready on the fast forward button to skip the aging-actress skin scenes.",1099440000,,1317,4.483193277310924
1355940,5,B00004UB6Q,"There isn't a false note nor a dishonest scene in this drama of tragedy and its aftermath.  A wonderful cast, led by Sigourney Weaver in a superb performance, play recognizably flawed and human characters coping with the tragic death of a child, and then, later, arrest and imprisonment for child abuse.

Rarely has the stresses and strains of child-rearing and married life been presented so honestly.  Sigourney Weaver's Alice Goodwin is a farm wife and mother and part-time school nurse.  She is often exhausted and frustrated with her children, the eldest girl being a real pill at times, and bored with the routines of family life.  Her husband is a decent, taciturn man, content to deal with the farming and leave the children's need for constant attention and domestic chores to his wife to handle.

Weaver's best friend and neighbor is Theresa, wonderfully played by Julianne Moore, is the perfect wife and mother with a house neat-as-a-pin in contrast to the chaos of Weaver's.  A tragic accident sets in motion a series of events that land Weaver in jail, and upsets all the relationships and the world of these very decent people.

What is so refreshing in this film is that all the characters are not cliches.  Weaver's Alice is a sharply intelligent, sometimes abrasive, prickly personality.  She does not submit humbly to her imprisonment and in fact becomes even more difficult.  David Strathairn as Howard her husband, is a man overwhelmed by the sudden responsiblity for his children and household.  There is a nice turn by Arliss Howard as Weaver's attorney, self-amused and egotistic at the legal games he plays.  Julianne Moore's Theresa is believable in her stricken grief.

This is a sharply observed study of real people under stress and passing through the kind of events that change lives forever.  It is worth your time alone to see Sigourney Weaver's masterful embodiment of this beautiful, difficult, ornery and truthful woman.  But her marvelous performance is matched and ably supported by her co-stars.

There may be missing that ""big"" cathartic moment to round out the picture, this film opting to reveal its truths more quietly and matter-of-factly, but it has something to say about how people cope with and are transformed by tragedy and tribulation, and that makes it reach farther than most of the fare we get.  A solid 4-1/2 stars.  Worthwhile.",1058400000,28,2382,5.0
1355941,4,B00004UB6Q,"Based on a novel by Jane Hamilton, Map of the World is a gripping family drama. Alice  ( Sigourney Weaver ) and Horward ( David Strathairn ) have moved to the countryside and  own a farm. Alice is a nurse at the local school and Horward tends his farm. Alice is active and a loving person at heart. However, she is disorganised, speaks her mind and often attracts trouble. They have two demanding young kids who get Alice to her wits' end. Their neighbours are Theresa ( Julianne Moore ) and Dan also with two kids. One day Alice offers to take all the four kids for a swim while Theresa goes for an outing. Alice has her hands full with the kids and while she is in the bathroom, tragedy strikes. Theresa's younger daughter has strayed into the pond and is lying face down in the water when Alice frantically finds her. They rush to the hospital, but the worst happens and  the child dies. Theresa is completely shattered while Alice is filled with guilt. She is unable to face Theresa and the family goes through social backlash. However, there is more trouble on the way as Alice is arrested for alleged child abuse at school. Horward is now overwhelmed with the troubles in the family. One the one hand he has to take care of the farm and the kids while on the other he has to get Alice out of prison.
Director Scott Elliott has handled this family drama well. Several scenes stand out, one between Alice and Theresa after the loss for her child is heartbreaking, a series of scenes showing Alice's anexity at the hospital when the child is strugging for life and then there is one scene where Horward leaves the children in a store of a mall and rushes to meet Alice in prison just in time for the visiting hours. Elliott has also shown the understanding and love between the couple quite naturally. Alice's dislike for her  know-it-all mother-in-law  comes through clearly. All young parents will easily relate to the tandrums their children throw at the busiest times of the day. There are some unrealistic scenes in the movie too. The women's prison seems like a smart hotel with concealed reading lamps next to the bed and the prisoners are dressed in neat and attractive clothes. What also hits you in the movie is the loneliness and helplessness of the family in difficult times. It's the typical social reaction that is encountered in today's society.
Sigourney Weaver and David Strathairn have done a fantastic job. Julianne Moore seems a little less expressive considering her tragic role. The pace of the movie is fair but you will absorbed in the story till the very end. Recommended.",1033776000,6,2600,4.606911447084233
1355942,4,B00004UB6Q,"Amazing Sigourney Weaver, Julianne Moore, and David Strathairn portray middle America and a compelling drama in this little known, overlooked movie.  More movie-of-the-week than theater going movie, the acting is the major propellent in this piece.  Weaver plays a overworked, underacknowledged mother, wife, and school nurse, who while watching her best friend's daughters tragedy strikes.  Weaver's character is brought to the edge and back, while her husband now has to learn how to care for all the things he just seemed to overlook so easily because his wife was there.  Strong performances make this a standout, especially for any fan of these actors.  The movie shows how circumstance can bring you to the edge of the world and bring you back and show you what you have and what you never want to forget you take for granted.",1030233600,,832,5.0
1355943,4,B00004UB6Q,"The summer of 2002 finally saw the long-awaited theatrical (though limited) release of ""Map of the World,"" and the wait was long.  But the film turned out what I expected.  Mature film for any moviegoer who knows that Sigourney Weaver is far more than Ripley who fights vicious aliens.
Weaver plays Alice Goodwin, whose life in a countryside of America turns an emotional turmoil when an accident killed one of the daughters of her friend.  And as she begins to lose her touch with the world outside herself, she is arrested for abusing child at the school where she works.  Put in jail, she is given an opportunity to think again about the roles of herself in the family.
As the film is determined to be introspective, the proceedings of the trial is not so important.  The first-time director Scott Elliott (previously working for stages including that of Broadway) points our attention, from the first, to the disfunctional relations inside and outside the Goodwin family; Alice's own daughter hates her mother: Alice's husband (David Strathairn), though he surely loves her, is somehow aloof from her emotional stress coming from her daily chores: and her work as a school nurse is nothing but hard and demanding before the wilful kids and irresponsible parents.  Any working females like her can soon relate to her, I suppose.
But her life changes after the accident and her arrest; but why not?  The point is the long way for Alice and people around her to accept it, and here again Weaver shows one of her greatest works.  Her agony is conveyed to us viewers with her strong performance which she displayed once in ""Gorrillas in the Mist,"" but this time with more understandable situations.  Also of note is Julianne Moore, whose role, a relatively small but important one, is another testimony that she is one of the best actors you can find in Hollywood.  Males are of course not bad, especially when Strathairn is on the screen, but my impression is that the film belongs to the female parts, and probably appeals more to female audience.  (But I'm a male, and I was enormously impressed, I must tell you.)
As many reviewers pointed out, the story looks uneven sometimes, and the last one-third of the film is losing its power a little by blurring the forcus which till then has been set on Alice's character.  But as for its grim contents which are surely very hard to look at, I am always ready to defend.  Indeed this is not an easy material to see, but worthy of their efforts to put into a film.  You may be put off by what you expect to see, and your instinct is right.  But for all its a bit weak conclusion and very serious subject matter, the film is worth watching because of the impressive turns coming from those talented players. Weaver and Moore.",1026345600,,2770,4.670781893004115
1355944,5,B00004UB6Q,"Strong performances by Sigourney Weaver and Julianne Moore highlight this involving and, at times emotionally draining film about the boundaries that are inherently a part of our lives, and the limits of those boundaries, both in how much we are able to give, as well as how much we can take.  ""A Map of the World,"" directed by Scott Elliott, examines the confines of the parameters within which an individual must live, and the finite capacity of any one person to endure stress that exceeds the specific limitations established for that individual by nature.  And it's not a matter of one knowing one's limitations; rather it is a matter of knowing how to cope with the results, once one has been driven past the breaking point into a world that can no longer be viewed in black and white, but only in shades of gray-- that point beyond right or wrong or what is politically correct; the point at which nothing matters but survival-- how to live in a world that can have so much to offer, while being so relentlessly unmerciful and decidedly unforgiving at the same time.
Transplanted from the big city to a farm in Wisconsin, Alice and Howard Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver, David Strathairn) are attempting to make a go of their own dairy business.  But it isn't easy.  Howard is immersed in his work, while Alice, in addition to taking on the full time responsibilities and pressures of raising their two daughters and maintaining the household, also works as a school nurse.  And though Alice likes her life, the constant strain of keeping her own life on task, as well as seemingly everyone else within her sphere of existence, begins to take a toll on her.
With no respite from the daily grind, Alice becomes increasingly exhausted and exasperated.  She finds some solace in her close friend, Theresa Collins (Julianne Moore), but what she really needs is some time to herself; some time to clear her head and regroup.  Instead, an unexpected summer tragedy strikes the Goodwin and Collins households, which damages Alice's much needed relationship with Theresa.  And as if that isn't enough, further trials and tribulations are about to descend upon Alice-- one of those curves life has a way of throwing at you when it's least expected, or needed.  And it's something that will test the limits of Alice's capacity to endure, more than ever before.
Working from a remarkably insightful screenplay by Peter Hedges and Polly Platt (adapted from the novel by Jane Hamilton), director Elliott presents a genuinely honest film that takes an in-depth look at what it often takes just to ""maintain"" on a daily basis, and the very real issues and situations that a person like Alice is apt to encounter.  From the very beginning, Elliott establishes the credibility of the film by creating an atmosphere and setting that is entirely real-- so real, in fact, it will be more than a bit disconcerting to many who will so readily be able to identify with Alice and relate to her situation.  And, having effected such realism, Elliott then moves on to deliver a thoroughly engrossing, emotional drama, which he renders with great care and sensitivity.
Elliott achieves success with this film through an obviously keen understanding of the material, the story, and the characters and their corresponding attitudes and reactions to given situations.  And he keeps it ""real"" throughout by eschewing any superfluous melodrama or sub-plots, the likes to which a film like this in lesser hands could easily lend itself.  In the final analysis, Elliott knows what he wants to convey, and furthermore, knows how to do it by exacting the kind of performances from his actors that really sells it.
As often happens (too often, in fact), the extraordinary performances in this film were inexplicably overlooked (as well as the film itself) and/or ignored.  Sigourney Weaver gives a commanding performance as Alice, arguably as affecting and effective as the work that earned Hillary Swank the Oscar this year for her portrayal of Brandon Teena in ""Boys Don't Cry.""  This is quite simply some of the best work Weaver has ever done, and it's a shame that she has not enjoyed the kind of acclaim that would accompany such an accomplishment in a perfect world.  Which adds some irony to the whole thing, inasmuch as part of what this film is attempting to convey (and does so, successfully) is that we do not, in fact, live in a perfect world.  All that aside, this is a memorable portrayal, in which Weaver exhibits a phenomenal depth and range of emotion.
The field was strong in the Supporting Actress category this year (Angelina Jolie received the gold for ""Girl Interrupted""), but Julianne Moore's performance here stands alongside any of those honored with a nomination for their work.  Like Weaver, Moore faced the challenge of creating a character that is so mainstream and ""normal""-- one of those everybody's neighbor or the-clerk-at-the-store type of roles-- that the real difficulty lay in making it look so natural, which when successfully effected, makes it all look so ""easy.""  Which is exactly what Moore did with her portrayal of Theresa.  And-- again, like Weaver-- it's a performance for which she has never received the deserved acknowledgement.  Suffice to say, it's terrific work, and a big part of what makes this film so emotionally stirring.
Also effective is David Strathairn as Alice's self-absorbed husband, Howard, a man suffering from a terminal case of tunnel vision.  How good he is here, in fact, can be measured by the feelings of disdain he manages to evoke toward his character, which at times, is quite substantial.
The supporting cast includes Arliss Howard (Reverdy), Louise Fletcher (Nellie), Sara Rue (Debbie) Nicole Parker (Sherry) and Aunjanue Ellis (Dyshett).  An ardently thought provoking film, ""A Map of the World"" invites a sense of introspection and reflection; a film that's definitely going to make you do some thinking.",1026345600,,5948,4.9557788944723615
1355965,4,B00004UB6Q,"This is an excellent adaptation of Jane Hamilton's best selling novel of the same name. It is a somewhat difficult book to capture on screen, as it centers primarily upon the emotional transition of one character, Alice Goodwin. Still, the film makes a herculean effort to do so, and in doing so, Sigourney Weaver, who plays the role of Alice, gives an award calibre performance. Wonderful performances are also given by David Strathairn in the role of Alice's husband and Julianne Moore as Theresa, Alice's neighbor and friend.
Alice Goodwin and her easy going, ineffectual husband, Howard, together with their two bratty, young children, move from the city to the country, so that Howard may try to achieve his life long dream of being a farmer. Alice works as a nurse in the local school, where she does not win many friends, given her prickly personality and tendency to speak before she thinks. Theresa is a neighbor with two children with whom Alice becomes close friends.
Alice is a very complex character. She is intelligent, outspoken, abrasive, sloppy, disorganized, and always seems to be walking out of step with everyone else. Theresa is her total opposite. She could be the poster child for good housekeeping. Yet, they click. One day, Theresa leaves her two children with Alice, who is going to take them swimming in the pond with her own children. While the kids are playing together in the house, Alice slips away upstairs to get her bething suit. When she return, one of Theresa's children is missing and is later found floating face down in the pond. At the hospital, all attempts to revive her fail.
Needless to say, though it clearly was an accident, Alice's and Theresa's friendship suffers a set back. As Alice is not well liked, the townspeople do not gather around her in her moment of need. Instead, those whom she has irritated use this moment to mount allegations of child abuse in Alice's capacity as school nurse. As the scandal snowballs and Alice is arrested, she seems almost to welcome the opprobrium heaped upon her by the townfolk. She stoically awaits her trial in jail, almost as if she were expiating her real and imagined sins, while her puzzled husband is left to cope as best he can, as his world and dreams topple in one fell swoop.
What happens to Alice, Howard, and Theresa is gripping, due to the outstanding performances given. In particular, it is riveting, as well as frustrating, to watch Alice's handling of her own situation. It is as if she were playing a role belonging to someone else, as the perception the town has of her has no real bearing on reality. In that context, the film is, in some measure, reminiscent of Albert Camus' existential work, ""The Stranger"". It is fascinating to watch Alice's metamorphosis, as she ultimately comes to grips with all that has happened to her and finds acceptance of self. This is a film well worth watching. It will not disappoint the discerning viewer.",1006646400,6,2949,4.7956777996070725
1355966,3,B00004UB6Q,"I've been a Sigourney Weaver fan for about 20 years now without ever being convinced that she's much of an actor. I've decided that she's a female Harrison Ford - authoritative in heroic roles calling for steely resolve and clumsy at everything else, particularly romance and comedy.
""Map of the World"" is a fine showcase for her flinty screen persona and astoundingly well-preserved bod (showing full frontal at age 50 must be a Hollywood record) but it can't transcend its soggy Oprah-fied storyline.",1005609600,4,502,5.0602409638554215
1355967,3,B00004UB6Q,"A Map of the World finds Sigourney Weaver as Alice, a school nurse who stands accused of child abuse following an unfortunate accident that left her best friend's (Julianne Moore) daughter drowned while in her care. The film occasionally descends into movie of the week territory (particularly during the ending's Voiceover narration), but for most of its duration manages to avoid the trap.
Weaver's Alice is quite interesting. She scoffs at the charges, since she feels she did nothing wrong. She initially looks at her jail stay as a vacation from her two children. Her character's attitude diffuses many of the melodramatic aspects of the events on display.
Moore turns in a terrific performance, as always, in what is a small role. One scene in particular, in which Moore and Weaver collide at night near the pond where Moore's daughter died is a powerhouse. David Strathairn, playing Alice's husband, does what he can with an underwritten role...
The film is not very well directed, but the sheer drama of the events carries the film to watchability. The script is uneven, but it works more often than it dosen't",1000080000,,1118,4.952127659574468
1355968,3,B00004UB6Q,"Weaver and Moore are the standouts here, especially Moore. The husband, played by David Strathairn, is an ineffectual, cardboard character to whom one cannot relate well. Although the film holds one's attention, it is not especially fulfilling when one reaches the end. I believe this is because there is no clear relationship between the elements of conflict (the drowned child, the false charges of child abuse brought by a parent against Alice, who is the school nurse, and her jailing as a result), and of resolution. We are allowed to experience very little of Alice's feelings of guilt and remorse (maybe she didn't have them?) over the death of a child in her care, and the interplay between Alice and the child's mother, who is also Alice's best friend, is limited mainly to a single intense confrontation. The friend goes away for a while and returns to read in the papers that Alice is in jail. She's a bit too ready to come to Alice's defense, perhaps; yet she remains the most human and believable character in the film.
The film is also too long and drawn out, with zero comic relief. At the end I was exhausted but unfulfilled.",992995200,,1141,4.71

1355970,4,B00004UB6Q,"This movie proves Sigourney is move than a good alien killer. She really draws you into her world, and when everyone is against her, she doesnt lash out, she takes it out on herself, physically. This proves she really cares about those around her. The ugliness and accusations really upset me, because she was not at fault, yet everyone believed all the lies. So typical of todays society though.  I recommend this movie if you a fan of Sigourney, once again she proves that she has wisdom and can survive in the face of tragedy.",971395200,3,529,4.568421052631579
1355971,3,B00004UB6Q,"While this movie offers a terrific performance by Julianne Moore, Signourney Weaver's highly praised interpretation of Alice Goodwin was somewhat uneven.  The movie itself suffers from inconsistency, mostly because Alice's motives and attitudes aren't always easy to interpret.  It's a frustrating experience, watching ""A Map of the World.""  For every powerhouse scene, there's an awkward, muted one.  In the end, I don't know how well Weaver conveyed what Alice was supposed to have gained from her troubling experiences.  She still seemed somewhat caustic and distant.  Was it the screenplay or the direction?  Whatever the reaason, this is an uneven and frustrating film, full of good moments and weak ones.",971136000,3,710,5.458715596330276
1355972,5,B00004UB6Q,The book this movie was based on was just wonderul. Many people have found it depressing but I have found it more interesting than sad.  Sigourney Weaver was just perfect as Alice.  We could easily see her inner turmoil even though she actually didn't speak many words about how bad she felt.  I thought it was handled with delicacy and taste.  The supporting actors added greatly to this fine movie but it all belonged to Weaver and she handled it all perfectly.,970358400,5,463,4.609756097560975
1355973,5,B00004UB6Q,"My husband and I did not read the novel this film is based upon nor had we heard anything in advance about the film.  We are also not typically fans of Sigourney Weaver, usually finding her too abrasive.  The reason we watched this DVD version was because we really love Julianne Moore. Thus, we were delighted to discover that Weaver did an incredible job of bringing this very complex character, Alison, to the screen.  Alison's friend's child drowns in Alison's pond one day when the four children are believed to all be playing together in her house while she is upstairs.  Normally it is Alison who is very judgmental of others and acerbic in her portrayals of people in this small town.  Thus, it is Alison herself who is her hardest judge when the child drowns.  The townspeople find this the ideal time to start complaining about Alison in her other role as the school nurse and the situation rapidly goes from bad to worse.  If you like complex characters and intelligent well-rounded renderings of their psyches, you will love this film.",970358400,2,1047,4.71978021978022
1355974,3,B00004UB6Q,"When I finished this film, I was sure that it ran over two and a half hours.  In reality, it was only 125 minutes.  That reveals something about the pace.  If you can imagine a worm burrowing through granite, you have the idea.
Actually, the story was a good one.  The problem was the screenplay and the direction.  This is a story of Alice Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver), a city girl who has moved to the country so her husband could try his hand at farming.  However, this is no Green Acres.  Alice is having difficulty coping with country life and her relationship with her two children.  One day she is minding a friend's children and leaves them playing with her own children momentarily to put on her bathing suit.  Upon returning, she discovers one of her friend's little girls missing and after a desperate search finds her face down in the pond.  Subsequent to this tragic accident, Alice is accused of child abuse by another child who claims she molested him in her duties as school nurse.  The two incidents together turn the whole town ugly as they assume she must be guilty.  The story is an in-depth character study of Alice and her struggle to cope with both her guilt and innocence.  The guilt is her feeling of responsibility for the little girl's drowning and the innocence is the knowledge that she is not a child abuser.
Usually I enjoy complex character studies with deep conflicting emotions, but this one left me exhausted.  This is not because of the story, but because of the script and the presentation by Director Scott Elliot.  Far too much time was spent on scenes that weren't really interesting or relevant.  The dialogue often seemed inconsistent with the characters, especially in Howard's (David Straithairn) case.  The lawyer was made to look like a buffoon.  Having seen Arliss Howard in a number of other films, I know he is a capable dramatic actor so I have to assume this was the director's interpretation of the character.
Sigourney Weaver has received much critical acclaim for this performance, but I found it to be somewhat uneven.  She was superb in parts, especially the parts where she was playing the strong woman trying to hold it all together.  However, she seemed to struggle with the vulnerable parts, as if she wasn't comfortable with the character.  I realize that part of the point was that Alice wasn't comfortable in her own skin and used a lot of defense mechanisms to cope, but Weaver seemed unnatural and forced in these scenes.  She seems to have a lot tougher time playing weakness than strength.  In that regard, Julianne Moore's performance was much better.  Her breakdown scene in the woods was compelling and heartrending.
David Straithairn was well cast as the self-sacrificing and supportive husband, a role with which he is well familiar.  However, he too seemed uncharacteristically tentative.  When veteran actors have so much trouble giving confident performances, one has to wonder if there was a disconnect between the actors and the first time director.
Overall, despite some good performances and a solid story, the whole project just didn't come together and dragged ponderously from scene to scene.  I rated it a 6/10.  For patient viewers only.",969667200,2,3219,4.846153846153846
