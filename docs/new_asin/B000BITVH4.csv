2418145,5,B000BITVH4,"Very occasionally an ensemble of young actors, an unknown director and a seasoned veteran can come together to produce movie magic.  Movies that combine this motley blend of talent launch careers and inspire film makers and audiences alike.

The Ginerdead Man is not such a movie.

The plot of the movie is as follows:  A cold-blooded murderer (Gary Busey) kills everyone in an innocent young girl's family, except, of course, for the innocent young girl.  He's repaid for his mercy with her damning testimony and is sentenced to death by electrocution.  Did I mention that his mother is an evil gypsy witch?  That turns out to be important.  She takes his ashes and delivers him in the form of ginger-dough to the innocent young girl's bakery.

I should mention some side details.  Gary Busey actually kills the protagonist in the first scene of the movie.  In the next scene she is no longer dead.  This makes for a bit of a continuity error.

Also, the bakery belongs to the innocent young girl's mother, a drunkard who shoots down a competing bakery's banner in the dead of night.  Apparently, two bakeries on the same street is a little much--can't over saturate the market.  The competing bakery is owned by a bad guy with no respect for little businesses or their belligerently drunken proprietors.

One look at the bakery and it's not too difficult to deduce why they are going out of business.  The innocent young girl seriously considers selling the business for 50K, it has an employee who goes by the alias ""butcher-baker"", and they make twelve inch gingerbread men one at a time.

The Gingerdead Man comes to life and starts killing people.  Actually, he kills two people, the competing baker/real-estate moguls daughter (who we learn was awarded the auspicious title ""Ms. Pretty-Face of Waico"") and the competing baker/real-estate mogul.  The audience won't miss them.

The Gingerdead Man himself looks frighteningly like a terd with a face.  He's strong though, strong enough to put a Rambo-style survival knife right through the front of someone's cranium.  He's also a bit of a cynic, but never once laments that his lot in life is to be a vengeful pastry.

The scene of the Ginerdead Man is at the innocent young girl's bakery.  No attempt is made to isolate the Gingerdead Man's victims from the outside world.  At any time they could simply walk out of the bakery.  In ""Jaws"" the victims are on a capsizing boat in the middle of the ocean, in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" the astronauts are stuck in deep space with a killer-computer.  In ""The Gingerdead Man"" the victims have their cars parked outside and are at the scene of repulsive horror at their own volition.

These blatant contradictions and ridiculous plot inventions are exactly what makes ""The Gingerdead Man"" such an entertaining movie.  The dialogue even has deliberately self-depreciating asides, making characters re-hash the previous events in a manner that highlights just how retarded the central theme is.  In fact, on the blooper-reel you can actually see how many takes it took for a character to summarize the plot without laughing.

Is ""The Gingerdead Man"" a satire on bad B-movie horrors?  Yes, but not in the slapstick vein of the ""Scary Movie"" series.  The movie makes all of the pitfalls of bad B-movies, points out that it is making those pitfalls, and then makes no attempt to apologize for them, and that is a recipe for comedic genius.  We laugh at the fact that they could leave the bakery at any time, but then notice that a shot of the window reveals cars driving up and down the street outside.  The director knows the characters can leave, he even subtly points it out.  The joke is on the audience, and it's a funny one.

Ms. Pretty Face of Waico laments the death of her father for about fifteen seconds, steals the ring right off his finger, and then gets stabbed in the face.  The Gingerdead man fires a revolver thirty-seven times without reloading.  The butcher-baker tears the head off the Gingerdead Man and gasps ""Got milk?""  The hits just keep on coming.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I think the world is ready for a sequel.",1137801600,5,4141,4.781382228490832
2418146,1,B000BITVH4,"WARNING possible spoilers ahead, and bad news for fans of Full Moon movies from the 90's...

Another lame movie from the newly resurrected Charles Band and Full Moon, this is basically just CHILD'S PLAY with a cookie instead of a doll. Gary Busey overacts for the entire 10 minutes that he's actually in the film as a grimacing, murdering maniac who returns from beyond the grave to possess a gingerbread man.

From that moment on, the story revolves around the owners of a bakery trying to escape from the bakery while the gingerbusey tries to kill them while making lame Freddy Kreuger one-liners. This is almost bad enough to be enjoyable if you watch it after drinking a bottle of whiskey, but then chances are it would just put you to sleep.

I've said it before in my reviews Full Moon's other recent flops like DOLL GRAVEYARD and DECADENT EVIL, but it bears repeating. Band should be banned from making any more horror films. The really sad part is that I used to like Full Moon movies. They were just bad enough to be enjoyable, and I have quite a few of the Full Moon movies from the 90's sitting on the shelf with my Troma flicks. But these recent movies are poor and shoddy in comparison, and they lack the humor and campiness that the early Full Moon flicks had. These recent ones aren't worth the time it takes to watch them, much less review them.",1137110400,,1361,4.502024291497976

Gary Busey is a murderer who is resurrected as a gingerbread cookie. The formula is old, especially with Full Moon movies, but it's a formula I love and think is quite funny. If you don't laugh with delight when you see the Gingerdead Man in action, you don't have a sense of humor - and you should stay away from all of the fun Full Moon movies. The acting is quite good for such a cheesy movie, the lead girl is gorgeous, and the foul-mouthed Gingerdead Man doll is very well done. Just look at the DVD cover. Oh man, that says it all.

2418148,1,B000BITVH4,"During the 90s, Full Moon Entertainment and Charles Band were the KINGS of ""direct to video"" and ""B movies"" with CLASSICS like Puppet Masters, Castle Freak, SubSpecies, etc...

But since the millenium, it seems Full Moon and Band have become a spoof of themselves releasing terribly bad movies that are not bad due to budget limitations, but simply due to silliness, stupidity and campiness.

GingerDead Man may be the final blow.... this HORRIBLE film  epitomizes what has become of the once cool FULL MOON ENTERNTAINMENT.

All the Band films are now the same formula... usually some variation of small re-animated monsters (Doll Graveyard, GingerDead Man, etc...) and don't even try to be good anymore..... it is almost as though they revel in their own badness.

Go to the old 90's back catalog if you want to see some good FULL MOON movies and Charles Band when he took his film-making seriously.

But stay away from the new FULL MOON stuff....... GingerDead man was the final blow for us !

As if that premise needed a little extra kick, this monstrous devil-cookie also happens to be voiced by Gary Busey. The concept itself is hilarious for all of ten minutes, but burns out quickly as the plot tries, courageously but hopelessly, to make us care about his victims. It's atrociously acted of course, the equivalent of D-grade porn stars who keep their clothes on, so those misguided storytelling efforts don't even have a fighting chance. A moment rarely passes without some manner of absurd stupidity. If it isn't a particularly bad pun, a wickedly awful special effect or a pathetic dash of vacant dialog, surely there's a glaringly obvious editing mistake in view. We're talking night-becomes-day-becomes-night, several times in the same scene.

2418331,4,B000BITVH4,"The Gingerdead Man is classic Charles Band  a bad, completely ridiculous, abnormally short film (the film itself runs about an hour) that somehow manages to be entertaining.  The Charles Band recipe of filmmaking rarely produces a product that tastes delicious, yet its good enough to keep many of us just keep coming back for more.  Admittedly, Gingerdead Man is pretty ridiculous, even for Charles Band.  So, yeah, I can believe that the grieving mother of executed killer Millard Findlemeyer sent his ashes in the form of gingerbread spice to the pretty young baker that testified against him, but theres no way she could have even fantasized that someone would drip blood in the batter, actually bake it up with the blood, and time it so that a freak electrical incident would supply the necessary juice to actually imbue Millards murderous spirit into the baked product.  Of course, watching any Charles Band movie requires you to accept the impossible  its all in the name of camp.

Millard Findlemeyer (Gary Busey) isn't the smartest of criminals.  First, he decides to rob some dive with about four customers in it, then he hangs around to taunt, kill, and injure the diners until the cops show up.  For some reason, though, he decides not to kill young Sarah Leigh (Robin Sydney) after offing her father and brother, so shes able to guarantee him a trip to the electric chair two years later.  Now Sarah is struggling to run the family bakery.  A city slicker competitor and his mega-spoiled daughter Lorna (Alexia Aleman) are trying to run her out of business.  Thats the least of her problems, though, when she lets one of her workers hold his bleeding arm over a bowl of batter, which said worker then goes ahead and bakes up.  The next thing you know, a foulmouthed little gingerbread man is running around chopping off fingers, cold cocking people in the head, and inventing some new baked goods of his own.  Trapped inside the bakery (only because they think its safer to stay inside than to leave, despite the fact that they know the killer is in the bakery), Sarah, Amber, and misunderstood bad boy Amos (Ryan Locke) must find a way to stop Millard Findlemeyers tasty little mini-me before he kills them.

Gary Busey is great as Findlemeyer and the voice of the Gingerdead Man, delivering even the cheesiest of one-liners with gleeful hostility.  I loved Robin Sydney, as well, and not just because shes extremely easy on the eyes.  All of the characters were pretty much stereotypes  the misunderstood bad boy, the narcissistic beauty (and drama) queen, the baker with aspirations of wrestling glory  but thats fine.  A film about a killer gingerbread man doesnt really call for any deep character development.  This is just a fun little farce of a horror movie, and it makes for an hour of great B-movie entertainment.",1450915200,,2837,4.832298136645963

Scream Queen Robin Sydney faces off against the mean little cookie with the BIG mouth in THE GINGERDEAD MAN, the latest Slasher series from Full Moon Entertainment. While THE GINGERDEAD MAN has all of the ingredients for a good B-Movie, it is taken far too seriously for a horror comedy, but is way too stupid to qualify as true horror, so it lies somewhere in between in killer cookie limbo. For the short run-time, the film sure is padded out with a lot of filler, and not of the gooey, gore-filled variety. The miniature cookie version of Gary Busey is armed to the teeth with bad puns and silly one-liners as he takes off after the kids, who never think to leave the bakery once the bodies start piling up. John Carl Buechler handles the make-up and special effects amiably, with his best efforts going into the design of the pissed-off cookie monster. Full Moon fans will know what to expect going into this mindless Slasher, which still gets away with a few cheap laughs and some campy cookie fun!

2418411,3,B000BITVH4,"I am a huge fan of straight to video release and b-rated movies. I look for them almost more than I do large budget films. I saw this title and Gary Busey's name and for the laughs bought it for 2.99. I popped it in and as expected it was extremely terrible but it was funny and it kept my attention.

It had some funny and great stupid one liners, the animation used for the gingerbread was laughably bad in a good way and it never took itself too seriously. the characters are all really stupid, they tell us over and over that they're trapped in a bakery but it's a very small shop and had two easily accesbile exits.

This is a perfect movie to watch with a friend that the two of you can laugh at and make fun of  during it's short 1 hour time length

Sarah makes one big gingerbread man from the mix and brings Findlemeyer back from the dead. Now one by one, Findlemeyer kills anyone in his path as he sets to get his revenge.

There are no computer special effects in the movie. What we do get is a gingerbread puppet as the killer. Yes, it is laughable. I ended up actually liking for the movie for what it was - a horror comedy, but it is only an hour long, not counting the credits.",1345334400,,1334,6.441340782122905
2418414,3,B000BITVH4,"When I first heard about the premise for The Gingerdead Man, I thought, ""Now THAT sounds like a fun movie!""  Even after reading all of the one and two star reviews here on Amazon, I decided that I still wanted to see it, and thereby make up my own mind about its merits, or lack thereof...

This movie has two things going for it - the overall ridiculous concept, and of course, Gary Busey.  Busey is actually on camera for only the first five or so minutes.  After the beginning, he doesn't ""reappear"" until near the second half of the film, and then as the voice only of the titular character.

It turns out that what could have been a great B-movie ends up being let down by a weak and meandering script, some oftentimes painful and dull acting, and some rather uninspired direction.  Like many other reviewers, I remember Charles Band and Full Moon from their glory days in the late 80s and 1990s.  Sad to say that if The Gingerdead Man is any indication, those days are long past.  Oh, it has its moments, mostly once the maniacal killer cookie comes to life.  But even then, many of the jokes and one-liners fall flat, and don't even begin to make up for the slow moving pace and rather depressing atmosphere of the first half of the film.  In fact, the female lead's morose behavior started to get to me after awhile.  Understandable, taking into account what her character had been through, but considering the film's title and its outrageously laughable premise, the script just seemed to dwell on the poor girl's overwhelming sense of loss and heartache for far too long.  I wanted it to get to the fun stuff!

When the fun stuff finally came, it was almost too little too late.  There were a couple of cool kills, but nothing we hadn't seen many times before.  Only these came by way of a killer pastry.  It was pretty much a one-set movie, with all of the action taking place inside the bakery, or on the street just outside. I think perhaps the most amusing part was the short sequence where the Gingerdead Man drives a car.  Pretty funny stuff, but again, all too brief.

In short, with a good bit of hesitation, I suppose I would rate it as a film that just might be worth seeing.  Just don't expect to be dazzled and blown away by a witty script, deliriously goofy dialogue, and heavy doses of humor, because it just isn't there.  As I said, there were a few good bits to be sure.  But I can't help but feel the filmmakers squandered a golden opportunity to possibly do something really great.  The whole thing just seemed a bit lazy and uninspired.  I rate the film itself two stars, but I'll toss in an extra star for Gary Busey's presence, even if he did only have five minutes of screen time.",1342310400,,2712,4.423387096774194

- the movie's a measly 71 minutes
- the opening credits take at least 3-4 of those
- I imagine the ending credits take even longer
- you'll see a hand of the Gingerdead Man early on, but he doesn't fully appear alive until  approximately 24 minutes in; that wouldn't be bad if the movie was 90 minutes minimum
- there are many spots where you can't even hear what's being said...made worse by overlapping
musical garbage
- there are no subtitles
- the Gingerdead Man shoots way-too many bullets out of his gun and doesn't hit anybody who's so close
- the nerdy guy rips off some of GM's head, but he's all fine the next shot

A bad flick but passable for a bad-weather day or when you're having trouble sleeping. I fell asleep and I can't recall when that's happened in a movie. This could have been a fun B-horror flick, but it stunk and there's nothing worthwhile about it. Unbelievably -- or believably, considering it's from ""Full Moon"" films -- they've actually made two sequels so far. I can't comment on those and I suspect I never will.

2418458,4,B000BITVH4,"Oh man what can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. I discovered it from a site called Crack and looked it up on Youtube because I had to see it to believe it. I'll try to explain the overall set up as best I can.

 Let me see, we start out with the worse bank robber in the world who takes no money, but shoot people in this cafe. One of the 3 people in there Jeremy decides he ain't taking! This dude pulls out his knife and decides to give this robber a fight he'll never forget. He gets up and walks his way over to the robber and surprisingly doesn't get too far before he shot. MAN! I didn't see that coming! I had faith that Jeremy could kick some ass, but once again guns beat knives. Too bad. Next Jeremy's son is killed, but even killers have standards and decides to spare her (Sarah/Jeremy's daughter)...for some reason. The robber is caught, electrocuted, and then cremated, with his ashes sent to his mother. Skip ahead later and we find Sarah working in the family bakery with a boy named Brick. There's a knock on the door and Sarah answers it to find a box of gingerbread seasoning and the back of a retreating figure in a black robe. Not suspicions at all she assumes the person leaving this ONE box of gingerbread seasoning is the delivery man despite no papers having to be signed or anything. She and Brick proceed to prepare gingerbread mix. Brick somehow cuts his damn arm opening a box and instead of looking at the cut somewhere away from the dish their preparing, Brick hovers his bleeding arm over the bowl with the seasoning in it and blood drips into it without them seeing it. Somewhere a health inspector is crying. The oven malfunctions and out pops a killer cookie. You hear me right! We have killer dolls, killer animals, killer plants, and now kill pastries that throw out baking puns.

 This is definitely a movie you have to not take seriously to enjoy. It actually made me hungry for some cake and cookies so if you smoke weed this is the movie for you.

2418463,5,B000BITVH4,"THE GINGERDEAD MAN

I am a huge B movie fan and a fan of Charles Band and his Full Moon Pictures love the low budget style they bring. This one is one of those that you have to go into this knowing what you are getting and accept it. Gary Busey is indeed the Gingerdead Man; yes a gingerbread cookie with a killer attitude. This is absolutely not a classic and is absolutely pure low budget greatness, I love it. Plus I like the fact that the film is set in Waco Texas which is like little over an hour away from me.

The Leigh family is killed in a robbery by a madman played by Busey except the little girl of the family. She sends him to jail with her testimony at court and he eventually goes to the chair. His mother says she will get revenge and after receives her son's ashes her plan takes place. She takes them to the bakery that Sarah Leigh owns and works at and gets it mixed into the gingerbread mix. Once the cookies are cut [this one in particular is bigger for some reason] and baked the fun begins as does the killing.

Let me say from jump that the special effects for this film are as funny as the idea of this movie. The Gingerdead man looks cool and Busey is absolutely brilliant as the cookie, the writing favors him a lot. Writers August White and William Butler came up with a crazy idea some horrible dialogue and some funny one liners for the baked good. Charles Band is a producer and director for this one and while nowhere near earlier classics it is kinda funny.

As for acting every one other Busey and his voice over and lead Robin Sydney need some work, some pretty bad stuff. Our lead shows that she can carry herself for the entire film but that is about it, also that one guy she hooks up seems like he is older than the character he plays. But overall the deaths are ok but are really funny because of how bad the film kinda is. I thought this film was funny and did not regret buying it, in fact part 2 [passion of the crust] here I come.",1260748800,,1975,4.148825065274152

2418505,3,B000BITVH4,"In 1989 the world was intorduced to Charles Bands' super low budget horror company know as Full Moon Productions. The company became popular off of it's cult favored Puppet Master in 1989 and has been pumping out a variety of a films over the years. They all tend to be extremely low budget but that's really their claim to fame. The company doesn't try to be something it's not and that's why I enjoy their films. Yes the acting, special effects, and storylines are really bad. But they are really fun to watch in that so good it's bad way. The Gingerdeadman stays on the border of watchable and promises to provide some laughs if nothing else. Hey they even got Gary Busey to show up straight from his celebrity rehab session. However after a couple days of shooting he probably checked back in for an extended stay.

We start off with crazed killer Millard Findlemeyer (Gary Busey) after he wipes out a family at a diner except for one girl. This girl winds up sending him away to be charged up by the electric chair and somehow his remains get into a box of gingerbread batter. This batter is then delivered to the bakery she works at and the laughs insue. A drop of blood winds up going in the batter forcing the spirit of Millard to come to life as a gingerbread man. For a 2 ft bakery item this is one tough cookie. It is just hilarious to watch these terrible actors running around as if there is no script to be found trying to hide from the wrath of the Gingerdead man.

The only way possible to enjoy this movie is if you're a huge fan of extreme low grade b horror. In no way is The Gingerdead Man a good movie for the serious watcher. It's really geared towards those who are looking to get a good laugh, not a scare. For those people who have any question if Gary Busey has completely lost it all you have to do is pop this one in.

2418509,2,B000BITVH4,"The Gingerdead Man has an outrageous and fun sounding concept.  Unfortunately that's all it has going for it.  Charles Band continues his obsession with tiny terrors by shelving the killer dolls and puppets and making way for a killer gingerbread cookie.  Sound fun?  Sure it does, but is really isn't.  Well, it has a few fleeting moments.
Gary Busey is a lunatic who goes on a killing spree in a bakery(Why?  How the hell do we know?), leaving only two survivors, Robin Sydney and her mother.  Busey is apprehended and sentenced to the chair.  Sydney and her mother continue to run the bakery.  Soon after Busey's execution a mysterious figure drops a package of gingerbread seasoning on the doorstep of the bakery.  Guess what's in it?  It's Busey's ashes!  Through a series of ludicrous and totally illogical events, these ashes become the Gingerdead Man.  Now he's out for revenge, terrorizing the few occupants of the bakery after business hours.  It's pretty much the same concept as Child's Play or Jack Frost with a murderer being reborn as a seemingly harmless inanimate object.
First off, we never leave the bakery.  The entire film is either shot inside the bakery or right out in front of it.  This is kinda irritating, especially since there are numerous opportunities for the characters to simply leave the bakery, but they don't.  Gotta keep within budget, ya know?  Can't have another set for Pete's sake!  Band seems so thrilled with his concept that he simply doesn't care how Busey goes from human killer to cookie killer just as long as it happens.  I know logic must be somewhat ignored in a horror film, but a middle school kid coulda wrote a better series of events.  Let me ask you all something:  If you owned a bakery and an employee cut his hand, would you quickly move his hands over the cookie batter so he could bleed into it?  And still bake the cookies???
Anyhow, also like Child's Play and Jack Frost, Busey shows up briefly in the beginning of the film and spends the remainder as the voice of the ""monster"".  He spews profanities and terrible one liners, some of which actually are kinda funny.  Busey is one of the more better known character actors of the last 20+ years, and I'm sure he's not exactly in dire straits.  I wonder why he did this film.  Maybe he liked it and did it for fun.
But as we all know, Full Moon has made some very cool little horror pictures throughout the 90s, but the quality of the films started becoming very questionable by the end of the decade.  This film is a good example of those latter days and not so much an example of the Puppet Master days.  I've certainly seen worse films from Full Moon.  The Gingerdead Man isn't terribly good, but it isn't without a few moments of fun.  But anyone familiar with Full Moon should know what to expect from this, so judge accordingly.",1214438400,,2847,4.600397614314115

You may be asking yourself what was your favorite part?  Well I will tell you.  The best part would have to be when the mom was out side drinking Jack Daniels with her shotgun shooting at the rival bakery's sign across the street.  The scene was perfect.

2418511,4,B000BITVH4,"This week we decided to give you our thoughts on The Gingerdead Man staring Gary Busey. This is the prototypical B movie ladies and gentlemen. It had it all! Awful acting, special effects that could have been topped by a third grade art class, ridiculous dialouge, and for an added bonus: rednecks!

Gary Busey plays a killer who kills all but one in the family who owns and opperates a diner in Anytown, U.S.A. The daughter who remains alive, now runs the place. She has since testified against Busey, who is executed and cremated. Now, Busey's mother is heartbroken, so she does what any good Mom would do: she dumps her son's ashes into the gingerbread dough at the diner in order to exact revenge. At this point, all she needs is a little blood to drip into the dough, and that's it, instant horror B! It's that easy, folks. Anyway, the blood is provided by the idiot boyfriend who pretends to be a wrestler. He gets cut while trying to give himself a sharpshooter.

It's here that Busey comes alive as the Gingerdead man and starts the body count rolling. A bright spot is that the Miz was among the first to go. So, he obviously is stopped. But, they leave this one open for a sequel. Sid can only hope that Full Moon will stay with the Celebrity Fit Club routine and get Screech to star in Bearded Gingerdead Man 2. Maybe the gingerdead man can come back as the keyboard player in Zack Attack. Just the fact that Sid considered this while watching the movie tells you how B it was.

 Note an added star was added due to an accidental appearance by a stagehand hiding behind a ladder.  Good work Full Moon!  Just when we thought you disappeared off the face of the earth, you totally redeem yourself gaining a star below the one and only DEATH RING. So, once again, we definitely recommend The Gingerdead Man if you're in the mood for a good old-fashioned B-horror. A hands down recipient of the Sid the Elf seal of approval.",1181520000,9,1931,4.456090651558074

To subtly emphasise this, every single scene she appears in she is seen swigging copiously from a bottle of whiskey - indoors and out. That's what kind of film this is. I can't work out if it's deliberately bad or not...the actors seem to be playing it deadpan, but the plot and dialogue are beyond absurd. Another flaw is this film's seeming lack of awareness. When the ""Gingerdead"" man comes alive and starts killing people in the bakery, he comes equipped with some knock-out punchlines to add a bit of vile humour to proceedings...the only problem being that they're not remotely funny. For example one girl gets hit on the head with a frying pan, accompanied by the remark: ""Ooh, that's gonna leave a mark.""...where's the joke? Of course that would leave a mark. I basically can't be bothered to dissect the rest of this flimsy film suffice to say that co-star Alexia Aleman is mesmerisingly attractive and probably the only reason I carried on watching this total nonsense.

(every now and then the DP tilts the camera angle, like THAT's supposed to make it creative and edgy). The acting is horrible, but you can't really blame the actors. The script is pretty pathetic.

It's a good idea for a B horror movie, and that's why I rented it, but it's only 71 minutes long and focuses on this stupid love story instead of the fact that there's a COOKIE KILLING PEOPLE!!!

You heard me... 1 HOUR.  and 7 minutes of it is beginning and ending credits.  Even as a derivative work this falls woefully short of being entertainment.  The plot resembles swiss cheese that's been hit with a 12 guage shot gun.  Gary Busey, who must still be suffering from being on his ""celebrity fat farm"" show and grappling with alcohol and/or substance abuse, provides all of 3 minutes screen time and the incessant ""chucky like"" audio of the ginger bread man to this garbage.  The plot is almost identical to Child's Play.  A killer dies and gets re-animated vis a vis an improbable inanimate object. (in this case a gingerbread man, and yes they make a pillsbury dough boy joke in this god awful waste of celluloid)  The acting is spotty all around from the cast. (Snotty rich blonde girlfriend, unworthy for me to remember the name, is sooo bad at her role I actually wanted to throw a brick at my TV) Gary gets points for acting crazy... but is it really acting?  The filmmakers make sure to add plenty of nubile 20 something eye candy (for both guys and girls) by making sure all the main characters are in skin tight clothes.

8087128,4,B000BITVH4,"Charles Band has created some of the oddest horror films in history (e.g. ""The Evil Bong""), but he's really outdone himself with ""The Gingerdead Man"". Millard Findlemeyer (Gary Busey) is a psychotic lunatic who guns down the Leigh family in a diner, sparing only the daughter Sara (Robin Sydney). If the film's opening gambit about demonic baked goods features a heroine named Sara Leigh, it's only got to get more ridiculous, and it does. Findlemeyer has a lot of unhealthy emotions about his mother, but after Sara's testimony at the trial leads to Millard's execution, his mother has him cremated and his ashes disguised as gingerbread spice and delivered to Sara's bakery. Through an accidental introduction of blood into the mixture (what are the odds?), the cookie comes to life and is out for vengeance. Now that I've told you that, you can probably figure out how the next 70 minutes goes and you'd probably be close.

This is one of Band's true masterworks, and the subplots mount in inexplicable ways: a vain girl named Lorna arrives at the bakery with a rat and a nefarious plan; she brings her somewhat dim boyfriend, Amos, with her but then he kind of hits it off with Sara, creating the traditional love triangle malaise; there's a murderous pie trap and the cast gets thinned out (I don't want to give away too much); there's a demonic possession of the assistant baker and part time wrestler, Brick, and throughout it all the demented cookie with a heart full of malice, big teeth, and the voice of Gary Busey gets more and more creative with his particular brand of crusty mayhem. I particularly enjoyed the scene where he drives a car, reaching the accelerator with a rolling pin.

The stirring conclusion involves trying to burn the evil cookie up in an oven, but do you really think that can work? The horrifying bake sale at the end should answer that question for you (if the fact that there are several sequels doesn't give it away). Of all the Charles Band movies I've seen I enjoyed this one most. It's completely original, features lots of bad puns and baking references, and is immensely creative despite being obviously made on quite a low budget.

The DVD has some quite good extras, including Band hosting an excellent ""making of"" feature where we see the puppets and the stunt cookie. The blooper reel is just OK, while trailers for other Band movies intrigue as always. This is definitely not a good movie in the traditional sense, but if you want a truly over-the-top horror-comedy hybrid like no other, ""The Gingerdead Man"" has all the right ingredients!",1485820800,3,2588,4.772321428571429

8087131,3,B000BITVH4,Too short. Not enough of Gingerdead guy. Too many slut outfits and vulgarity. No re-watchability.,1483833600,,97,5.533333333333333
8087132,1,B000BITVH4,"Good: The Gingerdead Man character looks pretty amazing and is hilarious in his delivery.

Bad: Super short. After a 20 minute intro credit scene and a 20 minute end credits, I really think this movie only had about 30 minutes of actual movie. Acting was terrible too.",1480896000,,268,4.702127659574468
