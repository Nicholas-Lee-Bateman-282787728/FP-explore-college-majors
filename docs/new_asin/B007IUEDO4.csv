8517973,2,B007IUEDO4,I am sorry to say I did not ike this video. I purchase videos to show my biology classes. I thought this would have to do with the DNA code of koalas and it had nothing to so with the DNA. I could live th that but there as wy to much talking and not enough action for my students to stay interested.,1365033600,,299,3.761904761904762
8517974,3,B007IUEDO4,"Big cities are sprawling into areas in which koalas live.  The work looks at how the two can co-exist.  I thought this work would be full of koala roadkill and be quite depressing.  However, they try to describe the sad facts without displaying them.

The work has a subplot and a surprise ending.  The work shows a koala youth and tracks him until he leaves his mother's back and pouch.  Also, by the end, there is a new alpha male for the colony researched.  The work admits that baby koalas eat their mothers' dookie.  Still, they show the joey when he has hair and is cuddly.  They don't show him in his original, worm-like state.

The work says that 1/3 of koalas in this area are killed by cars.  But there are laws that humans cannot pet or pick up koalas.  The Aussies are trying to make underpaths for the marsupials, but they also show that a koala can traverse a six-laned highway.  The work admits that koalas can catch an STD.  Luckily, veterinarians are trying to cure those who have been ""burnt.""

""March of the Penguins"" showed those birds breeding.  This work also shows a koala pair doing da nasty.  A similar documentary was made about kangaroos in urban environments.  Viewers who enjoyed this doc should also see that one.  However, that one shows more death and dispair.",1357344000,,1292,4.563318777292577
