2519080,2,B000EHQ7YW,"I originally thought this was a remake of the 1985 classic as they are remaking every classic zombie munchfest these days. But it turns out it's the 4th installment. Well, that right there should be reason enough to avoid this. I chose to check it out and it is, next to Day of the Dead:Contagium the WORST horror remake I've ever seen and I've seen plenty! This one has more mistakes than an abortion clinic seriously. Don't even mention the horrendous acting and plot. I mean, the 1985 original ""Return of the Living Dead"" had pretty lousy acting but gosh darn it had Mr. Pathmark!!! That's a plus in my book, not to mention it's actually a GOOD movie. This is horrible in every which way, in the beginning of this flick a zombie can only be airholed by the famous shot to the head. A few zombies take body shots only to keep trudging forth. BUT all of a sudden towards the middle, they start dropping like flies when shot anywhere BUT the head. That did it for me. It just got cheesier as the movie went on and on. The ONLY reason it gets 2 stars is that the special effects are actually pretty good, pretty authentic compated to others. And there are a few scenes that showcase these efx, like a steamroller squashing a head into raspberry jam! Other than that, stick to the 4 star winners like ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Day of the Dead"" and of course the granpappy of them all, ""NIGHt of the Living Dead."" In other words, if it ain't Romero it ain't right!! There are exceptions to the rule, but this ain't one of them!! Darn at LEAST they coulda brought back Joe Pathmark!!!",1145664000,2,1575,4.378839590443686
2519081,2,B000EHQ7YW,"The first Return of the living dead is considered a classic by many horror fans. The second is my favorite movie of all time, because it was great sequel that brought back a lot of actors and comedy elements from the original. And it had awesome looking zombies. The third one had a serious plot and seemed like a thinly disguised sequel to Re-animator. And the forurth entry tries to make fun of the Resident Evil movies (And in my opnion those movies are allready a parody of themselves) were a group of teenagers must fight against zombies created by a mad scinetist. These zombies are not the buried, skeletal corpses we all know and love like in the first two entries, but a cross between zombies and cyborgs. And to make it worse, the zombies can be easily killed by a braking the neck. Come on, that dosen't even work on Romero's zombies! Seems like all the recent sequels of the great horror flicks of the 80's sucks. So far we have Jason in space, Chucky with a sexually confused son, Kelly Rowland ""street talking"" to Freddy and did we really need a Resident Evil-inspired ROTLD sequel?",1142553600,4,1096,4.540404040404041
2519082,1,B000EHQ7YW,"It's been quite a while since there was any film made with the words ""Return of the Living Dead"" in the title, and hearing those words brings up some great memories.  The 1985 comedy/horror classic, it's lesser but even more comedy-laden sequel, and the third film which traded in the laughs for all out shocks and gore.  All three films were good in varying degrees, which is why the idea that a made for the Sci-Fi Channel sequel will surely leave you thinking that the results of this will be anything less than comprehensible.  Filmed in Romania, Peter Coyote is the only recognizable face as a mad scientist whose teenage nephew and his friends get mixed up with the local evil company; which leads to zombies running amok.  Make no mistake that Return of the Living Dead 4 is beyond bad with a few good moments (when two friends come across a former female friend turned zombie, the one yells at the other one to shoot her, as the other responds ""but I lost my virginity to her!"") but what else did you expect?  And if you think this is bad, just see the sequel (yes you read that right) entitled Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave.",1142380800,14,1150,4.431279620853081
2519083,3,B000EHQ7YW,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is not at all good, but it could've been alot worse.  Now this movie is supposed to be the 4th in the Return Of The Living Dead series, but doesn't have much to do with the other films other than the ""Trioxin"" drums, and it mentions something about the first outbreak in the first movie.  This ones about the Military again trying to use re-animated corpses as bio weapons, this time making trying to make some (Weak-assed)Robocop wannabe's, that's all you really need to know.  Now one of the main things that seperated the ""ROLD"" zombies from Romero's zombies was that they were only vulnerable to electricity, in this movie we see them taken out with bullets to the head and some other wacky ways.  We also get karate zombies; haven't we had enough karate zombies in other films, haven't we as a society moved on from karate zombies?

So far I've really done nothing but crap all over this movie, however when put up against other straight to disc/TV movies(the awful ""House Of The Dead 2"",the horrid ""Day Of The Dead 2:Contagion"") this one is actually watchable.  It seems like the filmmakers may have watched(and for the most part ignored)the first 3 movies.  The make up and special effects are alot better than I expected, the acting while not great definately could've been alot worse.  In the end I think this movie is worth a rental....DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!  I think what really needs to be done is someone take the rights to all the Zombie movies Lions Gate has (They're clearly only cashing in on the latest craze and care little about the genre)and give them to Universal, even if they're never made, we'll never have to sit through another House Of The Dead 1 & 2....and maybe, just maybe we might get another Shaun or Land of the Dead.  Buyer Beware",1140393600,,1799,4.576323987538941
2519084,1,B000EHQ7YW,"I remember watching the original Return of the Living Dead in 1985. That zombie movie played on the premise that Night of the Living Dead actually happened. It was a great twist and interesting idea. The zombies in that film weren't shambling and dumb like the one's in Romero's film. Instead these zombies were pretty quick and could talk and formulate plans and traps. Also these zombies couldn't be killed by destroying the brain. It was the birth of the superzombies and it made for a fun experience. One thing it also had was a nice dose of comedy mixed in with the horror.

A few years later they had a sequel to Return of the Living Dead that was a good second helping. Nothing to write home about but it was a fun gory flick. Then came a second sequel which dropped the comedy and instead tried to be Romeo and Juliet meets brain-eating zombies. Other than the usual gore and bloodsplatter this second sequel was an utter failure. It took over 10 years for someone to try making a couple more sequels, but sure enough someone found a way to do it. They even found a good enough director in Ellory Elkayem (he directed the fun, campy giant spider monster flick Eight-Legged Freaks). There was talk that this third sequel will return the ROTLD franchise back to its roots of horror mixed with comedy. I was stoked about the news. Then when it came time to see Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis, I found out that it was going to go direct-to-cable. This usually means bad news all around about the overall quality of the finished film, but I was still going to give it a chance.

I finally saw its premiere on Sci-Fi channel in 2005 and all my low expectations weren't even reached by the what I saw on the TV. The movie starts off well enough and right from the get-go they don't hide the fact that the film is taking place in some Eastern European country. Peter Coyote the --- only actor with any sort of talent --- makes his appearance in this scene and there's not even any attempt to make his character abit mysterious of whether he's a good guy or a bad guy. Coyote's scientist role in the film screams evil mad scientist. The rest of the cast seemed like it was randomly picked from a college campus and from the streets of Romania. The dialogue was bad enough but having them read out loud by amateurs just made it all worse.

The whole premise of the film outside of reintroducing newcomers to the zombifying effects of Trioxin seemed like the writers were trying to emulate Resident Evil instead of Return of the Living Dead. There's the mega-corporation which deals with everything known to man and also research and develops illegal biowarfare technology like zombies armed with hi-tech weapons. Resident Evil did this better (thats not saying much) so it goes without saying that ROTLD4: Necropolis just didn't know what it wanted to be. There wasn't any of the comedy that made the first two films in the franchise so fun to watch. It looked as if they tried to make a serious zombie movie and instead it turned out to be seriously bad.

Even the zombies themselves ended up being inconsistent with the zombies from the first two films. Some seemed smart enough but most were of the Romero kind which goes against everything that is ROTLD. Their feeding habits even changed from eating nothing but brains but to eating other parts of the body. And they're not indestructible anymore. Shooting these zombies in the head will drop them like a sack of bricks.

There really wasn't anything fun about this sequel. I would've given it a second star if they just made the zombies right and added a higher gore-quotient. Zombie movies are suppose to be dumb, gory fun but instead Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis just ends up being dumb, horrible and awful. I had alot of hope in Ellory Elkayem as an up-and-coming genre director, but cranking out this film after making such a fun one in Eight-Legged Freaks is a mystery and saddening. I wouldn't recommend this film as a rental on dvd. Just go rent the original two films in the series and leave this one alone.",1139961600,49,4089,4.550271739130435

2519157,3,B000EHQ7YW,"Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis starts out with Charles Garrison traveling to Chernobyl to purchase canisters of Trioxin, the substance that reanimates the dead into zombies. He works for a company called Hybra Tech, who is experimenting with the Trioxin. A lab accident causes the release of the gas, & a zombie outbreak occurs. That's what this movie is all about.

For the Return of the Living Dead to be such a staple in the zombie genre, I'm seriously wondering why the powers that be let Ellory Elkayem put his brand on the series. As far as it being a zombie movie, it's okay. Well acted by those who made it with an okay script. However, as a Return of the Living Dead movie, this movie is awful. Simply awful. It, in no way, bears any resemblance to the series previous installments nor does it share anything with those movies(other than the reference to Trioxin). If this were released under a different title, this movie may have had a chance.

To recommend this movie to other RotLD fans so they can complete their collections, I'm afraid I can't. I will recommend to those who just want a decent zombie movie. It's not quite that bad. It's just NOT a Return of the Living Dead movie. Once you get past that, it's all good.",1348617600,,1242,4.540178571428571
2519158,3,B000EHQ7YW,"I love the first 2 ROTLD movies, and hated the 3rd. So going into this 4th one I was skeptic that I was going to hate it. The story is about a scientist who finds a few Russians (I think) who have 3 of the zombie chemical canisters in their possession. He buys them wanting to create zombie soldiers for the future. The main star of the film is the scientists nefue, whom he lives with and does not know what his uncle does at the research facility. One of the kids friends ends up having a motorcycle accident and is taken away in an ambulance. When the son arrives at the hospital to see his friend, he is informed that his friend had an allergic reaction to the pain killers and was pronounced DOA. While he sits waiting in morning at the hospital, his friend rings him to say his so called dead friend was taken to the research facility she works at as a monitor guard, and they decide to get some friends together to rescue his friend from the facility. The only thing is, the facility is not just doing the kind of research the claim, and you can guess what is inside, and what ends up being released. All hell breaks loose and a zombie infestation riots the building.

Now, I know a lot of people have been slamming this movie saying it broke all the rules. And yes, it does. I was not a fan of the fact that you can now shoot a zombie in the head, and it will die. In the first 2 or 3 movies, you couldn't kill them, shoot them anywhere, they still run around like a headless chicken... but I thought maybe, maybe the scientist did something to the chemical so that if it reanimated the corpses, or infected the living, the dosage is different and they can be stopped now, provided the brain is damaged? Of coarse, this is NOT the explanation at all, the makes of this film just didn't do their homework, but when I looked at it that way, the movie is not all that bad. It has blood and guts and a few decent moments.. yet again, there are some down right stupid moments too, but in defense of that, all 5 of these movies are guilty of that.

I dunno, it may just be me, but I thought this wasn't that bad of a movie. Maybe if you look at it as a separate movie to the ROTLD films, you may enjoy it. There where some rules not followed, and that really did not sit well with fans, but overall, I have seen way worse zombie films, and I don't think this one deserves to be slammed as a 1 star cluster %$#@. It was entertaining enough from start to finish, and I think the only thing that needed to be changed was when a zombie is shot in the head and goes down, he/she gets back up eventually. But oh well, what can you do, it's not like someone will ever officially change it... I mean look at what a disaster that so called comedy version of that Zombie on the island of kids graduation rave party movie was. It was as bad as the original.

I think something else that drew me to liking the movie was the inclusion of ""Cold Machines"" by Alice Cooper. Great song, and fit into the movie well!",1327104000,,3000,4.151202749140894
2519159,1,B000EHQ7YW,"So I had no expectations when I bought the movie, but one: it must be good. How wrong I was. It was not entertaining at all, acting was fair in some places, plot is typical for this kind of movie. I don't like it. Come on every civilian made like so many head shots compare to the Swat team in the end of the movie which made none lol. Even when people have no ammo left, it was looking so ridiculous. Similar to other movies. The last zombie wave and gunshots were pathetic. I was counting minutes til the titles would be rolling. Verdict: No satisfaction from the movie, plain waste of time. What about the bunch of teenagers in this boring, bad movie(as the main characters)? They are not quite good at acting. You have every reason to skip this movie.",1320624000,,755,4.323943661971831
2519160,1,B000EHQ7YW,"As Solomon once wisely wrote, there is a time & a season for everything. And while I love my 'Dead' set & some of the variations spawned from it, this movie was so bad it will never be good. If there were a time machine it would be wise for someone to go back & make sure this, & the subsequent, and to be honest, even III, were never made. II was ok but I would have been happy w/the 1st one being on its own. And while there was a good effort put into the remake of the original ""Night..."" I would have been content w/o the remake of that one as well.
One thing I always admired Mr Romero for was that he didn't use cheap tricks to try & sell an audience. What do I mean by that? Well, altho it has been awhile since I watched the ""Return..."" I was a bit amazed at the copious amounts of nudity in the film, given the lack thereof in Mr Romero's outputs. I guess that is what I mean by cheap tricks. He didn't need to expose women to get people to watch his films. At least not on the levels seen in some of the offshoots.
Be that as it may, this film, regardless of anything, is simply a waste of time, money, etc. And thankfully, because of reviews of the others, i will not even waste either w/the subsequent follies.
There is indeed a time for all things to end, and i think, barring Mr Romero's mind developing a new one himself, I will be more cautious before any further wastes. Have a great day.

This movie has pretty much the same storyline as the first Resident Evil movie with Milla Jovovich. This is still an interesting take on zombies, but entirely unexpected after Return of the Living Dead 3. RofLD 5: Rave to the Grave returns the series to where it was with 3.

He now does lots of narration of national geographic channels shows, he needs to act too though. Anyways he can't save this , noone can if it was a stand alone zombie flick you could say well that is a ok low budget zombie flick but this one isn't stand alone they claimed sequelality. and that's why it's bad on that level.

2519195,2,B000EHQ7YW,"In 2005, the rights to the RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD series were bought up and shipped out to Romania for two back-to-back video releases with expectantly poor results. This fourth film pits a new group of teenagers against a zombie horde that has been created by a hi-tech weapons manufacturer with the intent of turning the undead into mechanical bio-weapons. The plot and characters have been streamlined down to their most basic forms, and have only been introduced as filler to pad out the run time until the inevitable zombie outbreak. Once the flood gates are opened, however, the film skates by thanks to a surprising amount of bloody gore. All of the gut-munching, head-exploding action is created in frame using practical effects, which is a welcome change from the exploited computer effects that are commonly used in such low-budget zombie efforts. The film builds up to a final anti-climactic battle between the surviving teens and the two weapon-clad undead soldiers, neither of which prove to be formidable foes against the unarmed kids. After putting aside the stock ingredients in this bland entry, the hardcore zombie fan will find just enough gore to make this one worth a watch.

2519196,3,B000EHQ7YW,"Yuppers, we get more and more Zombie stuff out there these days. Return of the Living Dead has to be one of the more ingenious ideas when it comes to the genre. I can say that long gone are the days of the indestructible Zombies from the films past. Now we get the Zombies that can be killed with a shot to the head. Still lets not argue these semantics and lets get down to the Nitty Gritty of the film itself.

Filmed in Romania and Ukraine, the film has a natural style to it's look. It really doesn't need a whole lot in the way of sets, nor did it really have a whole lot in the way of sets. Most of what you see here is natural surroundings. The acting in the film was not half bad and the dialogue actually was not too bad either. If you are going to make a crazy style Teenage Zombie Flick, this is how to do it and make it work . . . just don't call it ""Return of the Living Dead"". In a sad twist, this film sits in the same category as films before it like Halloween III. Had Halloween III released under a different title, the film might have done better. People looking for Michael Myers wouldn't have been so angry. As a spooky film on it's own, it's a fairly well done movie that is worth watching. The same can be said here. Return of the Living Dead Necropolis is not a horrible Zombie film on it's own, but as a sequel in the franchise, it is just bad. The people responsible for the film seem to have ignored every ""Rule"" for the Zombies set up in the first three films, trying to rewrite the mythology of the series and falling flat on their faces in doing so.

Still, as a Zombie film on it's own, it isn't a horrible film and can still be enjoyed if this is your thing. I am into more hardcore Zombie films than this, but I can still appreciate it for what it is. Mistitled, but not horrible and worth a watch. I have seen far worse Zombie flicks for sure that people love but they give this film a ration of crap, go figure.",1263945600,,1946,4.0519480519480515

The zombies look awesome, but thats about the only plus to this movie. First annoying thing about this movie is how they kill zmbies. The first few need the classic bullet to the head, but then it seems like a direct shot to the pancreas will kill them. Consistent, no. The next thing is how the zombies act. In the beginning they are all the classic moaners and shufflers. At the end, one holds a conversation, throws out some one- liners and engages in a fist fight like they were Bruce Lee. Consistent, no. The last major problem I have is the ending with the zombie- borg- resident evil zombies. It made no sense. Why go in that direction at the end ?

It was filmed near the infamous Chernobyl Reactor 4, and should have stayed there in the concrete dome protecting the people from the lethal nuclear pile still burning in the reactor pit.

This film tries to be something different and completely rip-offs the Resident Evil franchise as well as trashing Return of the Living Dead. At the end, the kid has to basically fight off a tyrant wannabe after the 2-4-5 Trioxin was revamped to make it more lethal like the T-Virus in RE. Instead of turning the dad into a zombie, he becomes a Borg-like super tyrant and is miraclously killed..... Yeah, I can feel the radiation coming off this one.

2519204,1,B000EHQ7YW,"The Return of the Living Dead series is one of the staple series of the zombie genre. You have Romero's films, and you have the Return films. Unlike Romero's films, the Return films have now gone down the path of utter disgrace.

 Everything in Necropolis destroys everything that parts 1-3 of the series grounded. The zombies can be killed with a shot to the head now, yet a severed limb can exist without a brain? Some zombies have no control over any bodily function, yet another zombie can talk, recall memories, and have the urge to fight a victim for pure spite and never act upon taking a bite out of him? And what the heck was with the ""oh, let's think we're funny and spoof the first one"" with the whole ""Send more security"" bit?

 If anything could have saved that mess, it should have been the characters. No, not at all. There may have been one character I cared about, but in the end, she didn't even matter. And the one character they tried to play as sweet and innocent and then turn her into a ""foul-mouthed tough chick"", that was a big joke. And one thing about the plot - in a way - is how can a guy see his thought-to-be-dead parents as now biological weapons be blowns to pieces and his little brother with his head ripped open and act like he doesn't give two cents about it, yet when the girl he supposedly likes is gunned down, he acts like it's the end of the world?

 No ma'ams and sirs. Everything about Necropolis is a disgrace, and it should be disregarded from the series. Nothing here has to deal with the original 1-3 except for the name and some useless little nods to those previous installments.

Most of the acting is beyond horrible though, along with the dialogue. The movie is more in the vein of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise, rather than ""Return of the Living Dead"". The zombies are no longer extremely agile or fast-moving, but slow and dim-witted.

The characters often make dumb moves like upon learning that the zombies ONLY die when shot in the head they STILL waste countless bullets on shooting them in the torso or chest. Morons!

Trash, Suicide and even Julie Walker will roll over in their graves.

I wonder if the makers have even bothered to watch the first three films. Unlike Romero's walking corpses, the Return of the Living Dead zombies are not supposed to die when you shoot them in the head! Nor do they give speaches or box.

The movie does have one thing going for it, though: it proves that all those B actors they got playing KGB agents in cheap 80s crime flicks got their accents right after all.",1168819200,3,974,4.34065934065934

You basically go into these knowing what to expect, but every now and then, you get one that manages to redefine what horror really is. In this case, horror is the 88 minutes of awfulness that is this film. Horrible dialogue, worse acting, and the assumption that the viewers themselves are as brain-dead as the zombies in the film. That ailment would be about the only way any form of entertainment is going to be had, unless you're a fan of an incohesive storyline, nonexistent direction or 20-something year-old teeny-boppers who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper sack. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that on the steaming pile of crap that the zombie film genre has become, this one is squarely at the top.

Director Ellory Elkayem should be tried for crimes against humanity, because that's exactly what this film is. In my opinion, he's managed to even usurp laughingstock Uwe Boll for the title of the world's most incompetent director. I'm sure some will say, ""But it's just a zombie horror movie, you knew what it would be going in."" Sure, that's true, but that just goes to show how this movie takes awful to a whole new level.

2519229,1,B000EHQ7YW,"There are some things that are sacred to me, and the genre of zombie films is one of them. When George Romero and John Russo the original writers of ""night of the living dead"" had a dispute over how to handle a sequel, they decided to split up and from then on Romero's Films would be known with the title ending in ""the dead"" and Russo got ""the living dead"" While still having the original film to reference. George went on to make Dawn, Day Land and the upcoming Diary of the Dead all sticking to his original zombie formula: lurching, hungry, dumb, and basically empty vessels of putridity and few words. Russo went on to write Return of the Living Dead, which he eventually gave control to Tobe Hooper who eventually gave it to Dan O'Bannon to rewrite and direct.  Return took a whole different path than the original, the zombies were juicer, they talked, were faster and more intelligent. There was no more unexplainable event that caused the dead to walk; we now had Trioxin a military made chemical used originally to get rid of marijuana plants (actually based on the chemical Agent Orange). Unlike Night of the living dead, the zombies in Return cannot be killed by a shot to the head, rendering them ""immortal"" unless blown to bits.  That film made 14 million.
Return, and Return II were amusing, funny, completely different than Romero's commentary on Society in his films. They have been called ""SplatStick"" for that reason.
Return II was written and directed by Ken Wiederhorn in 1988 and it followed the first even had some of the same actors and while it was no masterpiece it was still a well done film that made 9 million at the box office, and then came Return III five years later in 1993 written by John Penney and Directed by Brian Yuzna  it had little resemblance to the two before it the only plot line surviving is the use of the Trioxin. It wasn't comedic but rather a doomed love story which again redefined the zombie M.O. It was poorly shot, had terrible if not laughable special effects (I have seen better zombie masks at the dollar store) and seemed to just be one big S&M hot mess. At this point we all got the feeling the series had lost its momentum, unlike Romero's Films which still have, pardon the pun, all the life left in them. Return 3 cost 2 million to make but it only made back 54,000.
The Fourth Installment proves this series is....well dead. Necropolis, written by William Butler and Aaron Strongoni Directed by Ellory Elkayem. This installment still has the Ole Trioxin Oops, but has now made the zombies more destructible, perhaps even weaker than the Original Night of the living dead zombies. They can be killed by a few punches!! The movie is inconsistent, has poor effects, worse acting and is an affront to zombie lovers everywhere. Gone was the humor, the zombies being even slighty scary, and the continuation of the original Return. Its like they hadn't even watched the originals, but instead decided to make a lame teenage semi-medical disaster stinker. There is another film coming out soon, or has come out called ""Return of the Dead: Rave from the Grave"" egads, its about the same evil scientist played by peter coyote one year later, and now the Trioxin has been manufactured into a drug called ""Z"" and whoever takes it, turns into a zombie.

2519231,2,B000EHQ7YW,"Nobody would take seriously such ultra-gory horror films as `Return of the Living Dead' and nobody should. It is a film made for fun, and most audiences know that before watching it. Ironically, the fourth entry of the `ROTD' series, made after more than 10 years since the third one, is not much fun. It's not funny enough, campy enough, let alone scary enough. Well, I like the Russian mafia zombie growling `BRAAAAINNN!!!' but that does not amount to much.

[THE FORMAT] is a familiar one. One big company, one secret experiment, lots of the un-deads eating human's brains. Motorcycle-riding high school students sneak into the company's facility in order to rescue their friend who is brought there after he is badly injured. Please don't ask me how they manage to break into the building riding the bikes, or manage to forge ID cards. This silly story must be believed for the director is Ellory Elkayem, whose previous film as jolly sci-fi film `Eight Legged Freaks,' in which giant spiders attacked humans.

However, the film lacks the tongue-in-cheek attitudes seen in `Eight Legged Freaks,' the very thing that should have made this `Necropolis' more entertaining. The first half of it is just boring, edited clumsily, and very slow. The second half gets better with the teenagers' bloody fight against zombies and ""zombie soldier unit,"" but these zombie attack scenes are at best inferior copies of George A. Romero without humor or irony. It is like watching clones of Romero's `Land of the Dead' or Zack Snyder's `Dawn of the Dead,' and perhaps those superior films, made primarily to scare the audiences, have more funny scenes than `Necropolis' which just doesn't know why it was made in the first place.

[SHOT IN ...] Talking about scary, `Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis' has one scary part. That is the opening set in Chernobyl, Ukraine, where the story begins. In the deserted nuclear power station, Peter Coyote's scientist purchases green, slimy toxic waste which turns humans into zombies. But I'm not talking about the green slime; I'm talking about the location because they really shot several scenes in Chernobyl! WOW! I really hope they didn't actually get into the contaminated area, but if you watch `Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis' (and even if you don't), you will think -- What is the point of doing that?",1157846400,5,2350,4.944303797468354

There wasn't enough blood in the movie to keep me happy, and it only got ""good"" 50 minutes into the movie, but by then you'll probably be asleep, even after the movie was lame.

Anyway, a bunch of no-names, standard cliche zombie moments... eating brains, lots of gunfire, screaming, running around.... feeling doomed.  Obligatory couple having sex getting eaten...

I suppose a zombie army with machine-guns for arms could be pretty handy... if you could control them... but the fact they were taken out in less than 4 minutes of screen time made me and my friends laugh.

When you rent or buy a movie like this you can't expect Oscar material, you are aware that what you're about to see is a B horror film wich means gore, silly plot and nudity (the last characteristic sadly not the case in this one and I really mean it because the girls are hot!).

Although you can't say that Necropolis brings anything new to the genre you CAN say the following:

1. Gore: Plenty of it, more than the first two installments combined and sure gives a run for its money to the third one. Also no CGI, old school kind of stuff.

2. Cool makeup: With a few exceptions the makeup looks very fine, there's even a zombie that resembles the classic main one in Fulci's ZOMBI (that there is an extra credit for paying ""homage"" to a genre masterpiece).

**SPOILER ALERT**

3. As the title of my review sais, It has I'ts moments, like  the whole scene involving the death of the guard at the reception desk (funny stuff), the death of the main character's little brother (I didn't see that one coming), the crazy karate style fighting with the ghouls (nothing new in TV series like ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"" but not to expect in a ROTLD movie), the big ending with S.W.A.T. arriving and kicking serious zombie ass (what can I say...I'm a big fan of guns vs. monsters ""a la Aliens"") among others.

**SPOILER ENDS**

Downers? YES, LOTS... terrible acting from the main character (even for a B movie), Peter Coyote's facial expression (could have played an exellent mad doctor in the 50's and 60's but here his lame grinn looks stupid), the two Borg-like zombies and the worst one: These zombies are not as tuff or quick as the ones in the other movies, and the way to kill them is erratical, sometimes all that it requires is a shot to the body or the breaking of a neck, other times the shot HAS TO BE IN THE HEAD (What the???).

2519278,3,B000EHQ7YW,"Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis (Ellory Elkayem, 2005)

It's been twelve years since anyone poured any new blood into the Return of the Living Dead franchise, one of the best (if you overlook the woefully ill-thought-out second film)horror/humor blends in the business. While it would have been preferable to have Dan O'Bannon back in the big chair, Elkayem (Eight-Legged Freaks) was a good second-string choice; the man already has a demonstrated ability to blend horror and humor. Which is why the straightforward dramatic nature of this flick is so surprising.

Don't get me wrong, there's humor. (What would a TROTLD flick be without a ""send more security guards!"" line?) However, Elkayem and scriptwriters William Butler and Aaron Strongoni (who previously collaborated on last year's Madhouse)  had a lot they wanted to get accomplished here, and when something fell by the wayside due to time constraints, it ended up being the slapstick.

Thus, what we end up with is a straight horror flick that rarely feels as if it has anything to do with the TROTLD franchise. It's amusing enough, in its way, but it really wouldn't stand on its own without the power of the franchise behind it.

Much of this has to do with the acting. It's extremely hard to figure out what the usually underrated Peter Coyote (recently of the short-lived, but wonderful, The Inside) was thinking in this flick; he walks around with a look on his face that says someone in the room just passed very nasty gas, which would be understandable if the look didn't persist in scenes where he was alone. The rest of the cast, mostly comprised of the usual young-and-beautifuls one expects in a horror flick, do their jobs capably, but nothing more than that.

While the movie does have an appealing ""turn your brain off and enjoy the fun"" quality to it, it's not well-done enough or seamless enough to really allow you to turn off your brain (in the way, say, C.H.U.D. 2 was).

A much better flick than Return of the Living Dead 2, but not even close to the quality of the original. ** ",1148342400,2,2068,4.756983240223463

Don't get me wrong this does not compare to the first two return of the living dead films but is still a good movie. But I must say I liked it better than part three. Part three didn't have enough zombies but it was still a decent movie. this film has a slow start but once it gets going it is half way decent. My only complaint is this movie was suppose to be like the first two but it wasn't a hundred percent. First off the zombies in return of the living dead part one and two ran so that was like their trademark (Not to mention eating only brains this one doesn't do that). Also I was hoping to see zombies come out of the ground with the trioxin mist going throughout the cemetary. To me that is what made the first two so cool. But despite those minor flaws this is still a good movie. I actually give this movie a four and a half star rating. But of course cdnow doesn't give half ratings so I gave it four stars. The zombies in this movie I thought were cool though I thought the old man bum zombie was cool. I also liked the scene with the rat. The characters were good too I liked the Carlos character I thought he was kind of funny. The story was moreless a continuation of part three where they were trying to use the zombies as weapons.

I understand that it is downright mean to be so critical of a group of people that had the courage and vision to put this film together, but I can't help but wonder what they were thinking; did they really see this as coming anywhere near a good finished product?

This movie is about as interesting as listening to Air America!

Avoid this movie if you can.  It has a terribly boring script, a slew of actors that don't deserve the label (except Aimee-Lynn Chadwick who is such a natural at what she does, even in a bad movie), and even the stunts are pretty lame.

Ellory Elkayem should find a new profession.
