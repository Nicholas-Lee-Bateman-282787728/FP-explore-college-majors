8599439,4,B00DZDY1EK,"The cover art on the case is a lie, special effects are grade b and acting is so so.... But what makes this movie better than friday the 13th is that the technology actually exists and the sereno is totally plausible That is what makes this the scariest grade B movie I have seen recently",1487808000,,288,4.254545454545455
8599440,1,B00DZDY1EK,"Duke (Ethan Flower) gets laid off from his NSA job. He moves into his grandfather's mountain home, only to find out it is rented out to a Mexican (Eloy Mndez). About the same time the US defaults on our loan to China and the next thing you know, planes are dropping out of the sky. This is Y2K bug on steroids. Duke, with the help of an old time neighbor, (William Knight) work to survive against no TV, no phones, no new cars operational, and every man suddenly becomes a rapist.

As dad tries to save the world, mom (sa Wallander) whines he doesn't spend enough time with his daughter (Hope Laubach). They run out of food about the same time his sister (Jenn Gotzon) announces... ""the toilets are out of water!!!!""

The US falls into a police state with ""citizens"" wearing controlling wrist bands just like the preppers predicted. Americans freely side with the Chinese Communists....for a nifty red wrist band. Not as good as a Nokia concept phone, but hey, it makes the arm.

This is a low budget ""Red Dawn"" light, that has so many plot holes, the movie is ridiculous. At the end, during the most serious scene of the film, as Duke makes a hard decision, I was laughing at the MST quality.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Off screen rape. No nudity.",1391904000,,1246,4.5
