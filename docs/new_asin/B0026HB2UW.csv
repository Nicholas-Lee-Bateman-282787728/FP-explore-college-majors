8352576,4,B0026HB2UW,"This is a DVD re-release of a 2002 PBS Frontline VHS release documenting the deeper nature of corporate fraud and corruption as it stood then and that extends beyond Enron and its auditors to many other firms. Bankers, lawyers and accountants all colluded in enabling these frauds, and many were inadequately punished. Check ""The Smartest Guys in the Room"" book and DVD, and then consider the Supreme Court's decisions this term. So much for consumer expectations of ""honest services"" or accountants' fiduciary duties! In my view this failure to punish many of the players led to the continued moral hazard: take risks, and we'll get away with it or be bailed out --- that has resulted in the financial meltdown of 2002-2010. Coupled with the 5-4 decisions of the Roberts Supreme Court, business has been freed of much legal liability while being freed to buy Congress in the coming election. It will lead to a failure of democracy. I suggest that you note when a ""new"" DVD was originally previously released on VHS, since some university libraries have tight budgets and may wish to rely on the existing VHS for a while to cut expense.",1277942400,4,1136,4.8307692307692305

8352578,5,B0026HB2UW,"Required viewing for all concerned Americans! Frontline offers an objective and compelling case for our present economic and social crisis. From the dismantling of appropriate federal regulation beginning in the Reagan era, to the laissez-faire casino capitalism of Bush/Cheney, this documentary precisely traces the sequence of events that have lead to our current ethical and economic debacle. As is also well illustrated in David Callahan's best-seller ""The Cheating Culture,"" America's moral meltdown is indeed bigger than Enron.

When legal guidelines are lacking and mandates for transparency in corporate and governmental affairs are absent, we open the door to abuse, greed and corruption. This is as true today as it was in 1929. Even the champion of conservative free-market ideology, Adam Smith, wrote in 1776 that appropriate governmental controls are necessary to limit the excesses and abuses of the ""unseen hand"" of the market. The issues raised in this eye-opening Frontline video bring to mind a timely quote by Justice Louis Brandeis, ""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""",1249776000,4,1181,5.349462365591398
