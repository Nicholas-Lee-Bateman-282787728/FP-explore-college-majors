8748096,5,B01ARYG1CY,"This one really surprised me.

Indie movies on the whole are really hit-or-miss, and in reality are all-too-often a miss. The actors aren't strong enough to carry the film, the story falls through (or was just bad in the first place), they aimed to high and fell flat... about a zillion and a half things that can cause an otherwise okay film to to fall flat and boring.

That being said, the reason I loved this so much was the interaction of the three main characters. They start off as fairly standard roles you see pretty often. Spunky cute girl, comic relief best friend... okay, okay I've seen this before. But at some point when you're not looking, you're sucked right into it and that's where the movie really starts. I don't know if the actors were friends in real life, but the bond between them grows so much over the course of the film, and you fall right into it with them. It's little things, like their body language towards each other, the little interactions and insults, inside jokes you don't catch right away. There's even little bits in the movie itself, like the McGuffin that keeps popping up (so good). It's a lot like spending an afternoon with your friends. Your total #$%hole friends.

Overall a really fun ride with a few subtle heartstring tugs, and well worth a watch.",1462838400,,1298,4.586206896551724
8748097,5,B01ARYG1CY,"What a surprisingly feel-good movie! Don't be fooled by the title, you're in for a hilarious, raunchy, rowdy ride with this film! The story centers around Dave, played by the talented Stephen Medvidick, who captures the fine line of dark humor to a T, while also maintaining the ability to pull at your heart strings in an unpredictable way. In the story, Dave has recently lost everything important to him causing him to contemplate suicide. In bursts his lovable partner-in-crime Steve, played by the hilarious, Kramer-like Rick Lundgren. Steve suggests a zany money making scheme- either Dave raises $100,000 in two weeks... or he kills himself! The cold-hearted yet undeniably endearing Anna Shields plays Gidget, a smoking hot social media guru who leads the way on their bizarre adventure. The three characters compliment each other perfectly and by the end of the film, you'll feel like a part of the gang, yourself. Do yourself a favor and check it out! Laughs are guaranteed.",1462838400,,984,5.042944785276074
8748098,5,B01ARYG1CY,"As far as independent comedies go, this one got it right! Memorable characters, original plot and funny dialog. Solid indie dark comedy",1462752000,,135,5.181818181818182
8748099,5,B01ARYG1CY,"It's what It's a Wonderful Life would be if National Lampoons made it.  It's a dirty, goofy, trendy, character-driven, dialog-centric film!  Ultimately it's a sit-com in a feature film format.",1462752000,,192,5.366666666666666
