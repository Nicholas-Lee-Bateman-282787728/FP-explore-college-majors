8205923,5,B000SM6FCW,Highly recommened and the packaging met expectations.  Bought it used to save some funds for our Media Center.  Very excited to be able to save so much on these videos.,1384732800,,168,4.566666666666666
8205924,3,B000SM6FCW,"This video is good only for a few things: a) the 1st Chapter on Disc 1 (United States Becomes a World Power)which covers time from the Reconstruction to the popping off of WWI.  I could see showing about 5 minutes of this at the beginning of a 1865+ US survey course to set the stage for what will happen over the next few weeks b) 2nd disc - the Korean War chapter is pretty good, despite the monotone narrator.  c)Operation Storm - good info, but horrible dvd quality in this Chapter.

IMPORTANT HEADS UP: There is no chapter jumping within a war.  For instructors or buffs interested in a specific battle, you'll need to fast forward manually (time consuming), rather than click on a chapter to get there.  Make time notations on your own as to when a specific event takes place on the disk.",1268179200,4,794,4.448275862068965
8205925,2,B000SM6FCW,"I bought this DVD set because I thought it was the Time-Life ""Century of Warfare"" DVD series. IT'S NOT! This is published by TIMELESS which is not the same group as Time-Life. When I saw this in the store, I felt it wasn't marked to clearly indicate that this is NOT a Time-Life production. I feel that I was a bit mislead by the markings on this box. Perhaps the low price should have hinted to the fact that it's not the same except that this DVD set was on sale when I found it anyway. I found the markings and presentation of this DVD set to be confusing and misleading. I'm not saying it's not a decent DVD set; however, if you are looking for the product from the highly reputable Time-Life group...this is NOT it.",1256688000,3,720,4.262773722627737
8205926,4,B000SM6FCW,"The best part is the 1st chapter; ""United States Becomes a World Power, 1900 to 1917""
It provides a good overview of US military situation at the beginning of the 20th century. This, I have not seen in any other presentation.
WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf Wars are covered, but not in detail. It emphasizes campaigns, and not the strategy or politics of the time. If you want an overview of US involvement in those events, this is great. Otherwise, this material is a subset of other War Documentaries. Else, the video quality was notoriously bad, which makes me question the authenticity of my DVD. Thus, I recommend to buy from a known name, instead of the lower price, as I did.",1254528000,2,689,4.564516129032258
8205927,4,B000SM6FCW,"I bought this for my husband who is in the military. He is also a history buff. I agreed to watch it with him, not all that happy about it. I quickly changed my mind.  The transitions from scene to scene are nice and they way they describe the events is very real. For a documentary, this was entertaining.",1242864000,4,306,4.186440677966102
