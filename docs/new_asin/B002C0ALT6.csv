8362713,5,B002C0ALT6,"If you want to understand Colombian culture particularly, or Hispanic culture as a whole, watch the first half of this standup. For a non-native speaker it can be a challenge, but well worth it. Andres Lopez breaks down universal themes by generation, and weaves together a tapestry that is common to most Hispanic cultures.",1486598400,,324,5.018518518518518

8362716,3,B002C0ALT6,It has good quality. Andres Lopez is a great professional comedian but the English subtitles say barely what he is saying.,1410652800,,122,4.857142857142857

8362719,4,B002C0ALT6,"If you are not colombian, you may not like it, since jokes and stories during decades make references to inside colombian jokes , for us colombians=This one is better than second one , me pido la ventana",1361404800,,203,4.513513513513513
8362720,5,B002C0ALT6,"I went to this comedian's show and I just had to have this DVD, 3 hours of laughs, although I can't rate the English version as I just saw the Spanish version and I am not sure if the jokes would be as fun in English (just something for you to consider before purchasing if you don't speak Spanish).",1354665600,3,299,4.084745762711864
8362721,5,B002C0ALT6,"Hilarious stand-up comedy from Colombia.  The humour is quite national, but great for an education of the Colombian mentality, especially recommended for Colombians or people with an affinity with the country.

(This one is far superior to the follow up CD by the same chap.)",1288051200,6,275,5.088888888888889
