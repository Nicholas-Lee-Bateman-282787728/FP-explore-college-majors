2379556,3,B000A88EVO,It was very good stuff but I have a live nazi across town. I need to see the documentary that aired on network around 2006-2008. During the summer-3 or 4 consecutive evenings. I think he is John Demjanjuik's boss at the Sobibor camp-contact Gordon 260-493-6043,1247529600,,260,4.8
2379557,2,B000A88EVO,"The Gestapo is an organization which gets things done. Unfortunately what they do is mostly evil. The players in this film are well known. But I was disappointed in the terrible video quality of scenes lifted from TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. Leni Riefenstahl produced a beautiful propaganda film, which has been re-mastered. In the ""Gestapo"", those scenes were muddled and blurred. There are many films about the Third Reich with good video quality, but this is not one of them.",1244678400,18,471,4.9
2379558,5,B000A88EVO,"I would have liked to see closer shots of the uniforms, but considering that these footage is more than 60 years old and there are no more rolls, I think it is a great movie to know and understand what happened those days.",1235606400,,222,4.186046511627907
2379559,3,B000A88EVO,"This documentary is that : a documentary, so you should expect a lot of pre-war and war news reels and you do get them. One hour of them, actually. There is an acceptable commentary running the whole length of the film that tries to explain the who's who of the Gestapo. You will see many of the news reel that you have seen elsewhere, assuming you have at least a modicum of interest for that era.

The disturbing element is always the same: the gradual disappearance of any deference to the rule of law. It ends up with not even a lip service to due process. No need to even rig a trial, it would be a waste of time and the Fuhrer does not like to waste time. The turning point is probably the Rohm purge: kill first then legalize the killing the day after.

The commentator does make an effort to show the how and when of this progression but the limited time available (1 hour) put this goal a bit out of reach.

Commendably, the movie does a good overview of the Gestapo at work in most occupied territories, something I had not seen before.

The movie is also an excellent memory exerciser that will give a fresh layer on many fading memories of those archetypal villains. Yet, we see them usually beaming and the horrifying acts they committed are rarely documented with news reels, apart from very late shots on the concentration camps made by Allied reporters.

Still, it is worth to be seen.

2379561,5,B000A88EVO,An all to vivid example of how governments maintain power by creating division and fear amoung it's people. A lesson to many have learned to well. The me first mentality at it's ugliest.,1187913600,11,186,4.666666666666667
2379562,4,B000A88EVO,Interesting to say the least. The documentary on the Gestapo was informative to a tee. The only fault I found was that some emphasis could have been placed on the more dubious characters that made up the Secret State Police such as Klaus Barbie ( The Buthcher of Lyon) etc.. Otherwise well worth it. A must have for those who are interested in the goings on in the Third Reich.,1167868800,49,377,4.4

8076226,4,B000A88EVO,This documentary is pretty dry.  The narrator put me to sleep about 3/4 of the way through.  It was so hard to stay awake that I am not even considering trying to watch the last half over again.,1284076800,4,194,4.078947368421052
