8526415,1,B0089PZBX4,The whole set is a random collection of videos. The real kicker is that narrator suggest that current Arabs of Egypt are descendants of ancient egyptians. At one point he talks about pharos covered with traditional arab scarf. Amazing that such ignorant person tries to lecture on subjects he knows nothing about.,1356480000,4,313,5.038461538461538
8526416,2,B0089PZBX4,"this set i bought for my wife, resident egypt nut around here. seems its a repack of several other dvd sets with a new cover. Check episodes too make sure you don't have them already. History channel has licensed this too other companies. to milk every dime out of this footage caveat emptor, or buyer beware........",1356393600,6,316,4.660714285714286
8526417,3,B0089PZBX4,"As one who has only recently taken an interest in learning about ancient civilizations, I cannot comment regarding the historical accuracy of the product, however I wish I would have known more about the contents before I bought it. I made this purchase because I thought an anthology would provide a good basic overview of the culture of ancient Egypt. I assumed, since it was being produced in 2012, it would contain all new or at least fairly recent components.  I found the anthology to be a mixture of some new, good items mixed in with some old components (looks like from the 1980s or 1990s). So, before you buy the entire anthology, you might want to consider just getting a few items separately.

Disc 1 and 2: Planet Egypt (2012).  Planet Egypt contains four 45 minutes segments (about 3 hours total). This is the gem of the set in my opinion and I found it to be fairly engaging. This item is currently listed separately on Amazon for about $18. If the entire anthology was of the quality of the first two discs, I would be giving the anthology 5 stars. I would recommend this video to someone who wants to begin learning about ancient Egypt.

Disc 3 and 4: Egypt: Beyond the Pyramids (2001).  The video looks like it was made in the 1980s or 90s.  I don't think I would buy it, but it's available separately for about $15.

Disc 5: Egypt: Engineering an Empire (2006). 90 minute Available separately for about $10.  Again, this is a well-done video. It is informative and interesting. I would recommend buying separately for $10.

Disc 6: Random Videos
Ancient Egypt: Modern Medicine (2009). The video quality looks like it was made in the 80s.  $11
Egypt's Great Queen (2008).  The video quality looks like it is from about 1990.  $25.
The Great Pyramids of Giza and Other Pyramids (1997) $25 (not worth it at all).
(Lost Worlds) Ramses' Egyptian Empire (2010) $9 (I liked it.)

In closing, while I did enjoy disc 1, 2, 5, and half of disc 6, I can't recommend this anthology. I just expected it to be much better. I expected more from the History Channel.",1350345600,16,2069,4.559459459459459
