5525536,5,B00AX7PGQS,"From the earliest days of cinema - from the small black and white projections that could astonish simply for the fact of their movement, for the sight of a moving body on the screen, to the massive 3d and CGI spectacles in which the performance is captured, fed into a computer and transformed, cinema has evolved, and yet has always depended for its capacity to fascinate on the power of actors, who transform themselves into the personas we witness and care about, fear or revile on screen, and then they disappear into some shadow realm, into a limo perhaps, to appear again before us on screen in yet another role, transformed. If they have lives in between, all that we know of them, really, is some juicy tabloid gossip, some bits of PR or bits that slip through the cracks. Do their roles rub off on them, do they form connections as they perform, does it impact them, do they carry the scars of the pasts they've portrayed? They stand up after being shot, rise again after death, but do they really, can they really, pick up where they left off when they put off the mask?

Holy Motors, as I see it, examines and celebrates the history of cinema (from the earliest spectacles that played to amazed audiences to the CGI extravaganzas that barely faze us, we are so jaded) - but above all the film celebrates the power of performance and of a particular and highly physical performer (Denis Lavant) who, from other roles I've seen him in, appears to have no fear, who puts his body on the line, and whose performances always seem to blur the line between street art and cinema. The film bears witness to the oddity of the life of the actor - who is celebrated like the wealthy, but plays and becomes all things, rich and poor, young and old, lively and sick, on screen - and even while the performances become something timeless, the sequence of performances inevitably reveals a body that ages. Life goes on, cinema is eternal. Or is it? Are images seen on laptops and cellphone screens still cinema? At what point in its evolution does cinema become something else? I suspect that for Leos Carax, the director of Holy Motors, who has never shied from trying new things, what ties the future of film to its origins is, as I've suggested, the power of performance.

The film explores the connection between cinema and life, on screen and behind the scenes, what happens when we blur the lines between acting and being, between life and performance. It also, I think, reflects upon the oddity of life, where we are, as it were, born into various roles we simply play out (badly or well) until our performance is at an end - what was it Shakespeare said about the world and the stage? The film also provokes reflection on the impact upon our lives of the technological changes that have accompanied and facilitated the development of cinema. It is no wonder that it is set in Paris, which can seem at once urban and provincial, is both intensely modern and aged.

It's a lively, lovely, bizarre, unsettling film. Well worth watching.",1362096000,6,3037,4.599630996309963
5525537,4,B00AX7PGQS,"Horrible film or amazing achievement, you decide. Despite disappointment after my first viewing, the essence of the film and the images still linger inside me. Not so much a cohenrent film as a symphony of episodic musical cues and blissful visuals. Hit me with moments of brillance and headscratching bewilderment. Once the cars start having a comversation in the parking lot and the credits roll, you'll feel you need to see this film again. Not because it requires your undivided attention, but because you'll probably be dying to see it again.",1362009600,3,547,5.021978021978022
5525538,3,B00AX7PGQS,"I am appalled to discover that Amazon censors movies on VOD. And I thought censorship was dead. Well, it's not. It's alive and flourishing at Amazon!

Knowing little about the scene in question, I initially thought the blur was the director's choice, perhaps to suggest that Mr. Merde had no genitalia. But, now, I understand differently and I am rather disappointed in Amazon and will AVOID RENTING R, NC-17 or unrated titles through their VOD service in future. They may not require membership, but they still charge a fee, so shouldn't their VOD be treated similarly to NetFlix, who I can confirm appears to not be constrained by FCC rules and regulations for TV/cable broadcast?

At any rate, I'm going to be more cautious now when renting streaming movies from Amazon.

UPDATE: I can't hold Amazon completely responsible, anymore, though they should be aware of any censorship in their streaming titles, and I would expect them to refuse titles from companies who censor them. The same censored version of this film has been added to another subscription-required streaming service. I thought they might have the uncensored version, since they require a membership, but they are streaming the same version as Amazon, so it must be the studio's decision to censor the movie for streaming purposes.",1362009600,77,1301,5.0418604651162795
5525539,5,B00AX7PGQS,"At first while watching Holy Motors, I was frustrated and angry... I didn't get it! Then I found myself thinking about it all the next day, and the day after that. The urge to watch it again kept growing and now I am finding myself purchasing it on Amazon. When I watch it again, I feel like I can actually enjoy it without the frustration of trying to understand it.",1360368000,5,367,4.257142857142857
5525540,5,B00AX7PGQS,"Some movies are made for a very specific audience. The kind of audience that yearns for a creation that has never been tried before and when transformed into an audio-visual format, leaves you speechless and spellbound once you have had the luck and the pleasure to view it. That's Holy Motors for you. There are quite a few actors in the movie. And kudos to the director for extracting every bit of acting abilities from each one of them. Be it the lead protagonist or the assistant of the photographer who gets shocked when trying to interrupt him from admiring beauty or even the kid playing his teenaged daughter. No matter how big or small the size of your role or your screen time, everyone did an amazing job - thanks to the director.

It is not very often that you get the opportunity to watch a movie that has almost no relationship to anything you might have seen before on the big screen or has any association with life as it exists (for the most part) and yet is not about special effects or scifi or historical events or futuristic fantasies. That's Holy Motors for you. Every scene is a fantasy of it's own special kind and leaves you thinking - thinking about the purpose and need of the event that you just saw. More often than not, you won't be able to derive any logical reason out of what you saw? But isn't it what we deal with on a day to day basis in our day to day lives - trying to find reasons and logic behind anything and everything that we have to go through (be it the good, the bad or the ugly); go through extreme emotions of happiness and excitement and sadness and dilemma that our lives subject us to? What if we go through emotions that we cannot define? That's what Holy Motors did for me and for all the reviews I have read about the movie - ever since I saw it on big screen - that is what I understood from all the other viewers who saw this movie. Anyone who had the time and patience to give a true description of what they thought about this movie had one common thing to say - the movie left them thinking. But no one could truly define what is it that the movie left them thinking about. It is extremely hard to put down in words because that's how intriguing and deep and intricate this movie is. To be honest - I really don't want to know the answer and the gist about what this movie is trying to convey or what the director had in his mind when he was making this piece. It is personal to him. And in a similar way - he has given a personal gift to everyone who was touched after watching this movie and yet cannot define or put in words what exactly touched them. That is what movies should be all about - and unfortunately for the most of them, they are not. But i am glad I saw Holy Motors and it succeeded in giving me what I was looking for - nothing at all, yet everything that I don't find in movies that I am subjected to in the world that we live in.

Parting thoughts - How come Kylie Minogue never ceases to look beautiful and has a voice to match? Lucky, Lucky, Lucky!",1360108800,15,3029,4.193825042881647
5525541,5,B00AX7PGQS,"People often dismiss Holy Motors as absurdist nonsense, which is in a way true, but also far from accurate. The film is many things, absurd is one of them. But mainly it is a surreal journey through the director's (Leos Carax's) life. It is his way of looking back on his life through the films he's made and the experiences he has had. It's also about the loss of his wife, which is prominent in the first scene where Carax himself wakes up in a room with an empty bed next to him. Holy Motors is also a way of looking back on the history of cinema itself through a series of stories. Holy Motors is led by Denis Lavant, who gives the best performance I have ever seen, portraying upwards of ten characters in one movie. If you're frightened that you might not like it because it's stereotyped as a weird French arthouse film then I urge you to rent this movie and judge for yourself, while it is weird, French, and close to being arthouse, it is still incredibly fun and definitely leaves you feeling like you had an experience like no other.",1358812800,6,1044,4.358974358974359
5525542,5,B00AX7PGQS,"If there is still such a thing as the ""tortured artist"" in this day and age, Leos Carax is definitely it. Hailed as a genius with his first films in the Eighties ""Boy Meets Girl"" and ""Mauvais Sang"", and boasting the up and coming Juliette Binoche as a girlfriend, Mr. Carax seemed poised for an extraordinary career and a place in the Pantheon of the great filmmakers. However, all came to a crashing halt with the release of ""Les Amants du Pont Neuf"", his masterpiece, in 1991.
If you watch that film today it's impossible to think of it as anything other than a classic, but at that time the movie was the most expensive French film ever made, caused the bankruptcy of three producers, and was a critical bomb in France. An enthusiastic reception in the US might have changed the course of history, but as it happens, the film got a negative review by then New York Times critic, Janet Maslin, and you know what a bad NYT review can do for an art film. This does not mean that the film did not have fans, as it topped Film Comment's list of the Greatest Unreleased Films of the Nineties.
Carax and his career crashed and burned (including his relationship with Binoche) and he didn't make another film until 1999, ""Pola X"", which received a lukewarm reception.
And now 20 years after ""Les Amants du Pont Neuf"", and 13 years after ""Pola X"", Leos Carax has made a triumphant return with ""Holy Motors"", acclaimed at Cannes, getting awards in France, and being hailed as one of the year's best films by many of the major critics in the US.
This introduction is for those unfamiliar with Carax and who might not understand what all the fuzz is about, especially because as brilliant as ""Holy Motors"" is, it might not be the most immediately accesible of his works; if there is such a thing, it would be ""Les Amants du Pont Neuf"", but this is not an arthouse film for the ""Downtown Abbey"" crowd.
""Holy Motors"" is a deliriously, joyous, operatic odissey through Paris, through cinema, and through the contemporary world. A mysterious man (Dennis Lavant, a Carax regular since his first film) rides around Paris in a limousine, as he assumes different identities, which include a homeless lady, a corporate raider, a working class dad, and a crazy elf. The film is constructed as a series of gorgeous set pieces which participate of different worlds and different movie genres: fantasy, science fiction, crime movies, contemporary realism. In this sense ""Holy Motors"" is poetic rather than narrative cinema, so don't expect an easy explanation or resolution.
This does not mean the film lacks suspense, on the contrary, it's a consistently dazzling and surprising experience, as M. Oscar goes about the world changing identities and doing everything, from engaging in a form of virtual sex in some futuristic games, to (as an Elf) kidnapping a silent Eva Mendes and taking her to an underground hideout in a Beauty and the Beast homage. There is also an extraordinary interlude featuring Kylie Minogue (yes, Kylie Minogue) which showcases the movie's and Carax's mad romanticism.
In this sense, ""Holy Motors"" is to be first experienced rather than understood, it's an spectacle, and at some points it has the feeling of a carnival. The director is putting on a show for the audience, as his main character is doing when assuming all these different identities and that gives the movie a Carnivalesque feeling, as we move through different worlds and characters: sublime, grotesque, disturbing, romantic. And you can feel the Director as the Orchestra Conductor, and in this sense, the film calls to mind, among many other films, Federico Fellini's 8 1/2, but with a much darker and maybe metaphysical understreak.
But let's the director end this review with his own words:
""In this world I invented, it's a way of telling the experience of a life without using a classical narrative, without using flashbacks. It's trying to have the whole range of human experience in a day"" said in an interview with Indiewire. And then to Aintitcoolnews: ""I really think of it as a film about the experience of being alive nowadays, alive in this world""",1356825600,9,4133,4.798036465638148
5525543,4,B00AX7PGQS,"Enter at your own risk. This movie is quite capable of confusing you and making you angry.  It could delight or overwhelm you, win you over or enrage you. It could make you feel like cursing and truly hate all art-house in general,  French art-house in particular, and Leon Carax, and his collaborators, specifically.

For me, ""Holy Motors"" is very interesting, unpredictable, shocking and ever-changing.  It is my kind of movie in which the writer/director expresses  his  admiration for  cinema as an art form. I've always felt a deep respect for the filmmakers who use in their original and unpredictable pictures  the references, allusions, and direct calls to the other movies and to film creators  who inspired them.  ""Holy Motors"" is one of those pictures - about film and film-making.

Our life - is a (movie) theater, and we are actors in the movie that plays in the theater. For me, it is the first thing to keep in mind when you try to make sense of what is actually going on and what ""Holy Motors"" is about. I see it as a dedication to all movies and the genres. Here they are, the Umbrellas of Cherbourg and deadly struggle of the character and his doppelganger in the gangster movie. There are also the references to beauty and the beast, not Disney's version nor Jean Cocteau's, but shockingly funny monster of Walerian Borowczyk's La Bete (1975) aka The Beast. Still gorgeous Edith Scob (Celine, limo driver and Monsieur Oscar's business partner), puts on a mask in the latest episode of the film - direct reference to the classic horror, Georges Franju's film ""Eyes Without a Face"" (1959), where she played her most famous role in the film, which defined the whole genre. And, perhaps, ""Holy Motors"" is an update version of Celine and Julie that looks at the story or many stories from different angles and plays with them. Could it be Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" in Paris, with limousine - sort of Charon's boat plying between the worlds of the living and the dead, reality and illusion, film and audience, between the actors and their characters? Or maybe this is Un Chien Andalou / Andalusian Dog for our time with the script by Charlie Kaufman - open doors to the irrational; do not try to explain the unexplainable. Maybe Carax could say just like Luis Buuel, ""You need an explanation? I do not have any."" Just look closely at images and metamorphosis and try not to search for the meaning in them. They may not have a special meaning at all but would it make the movie any worse? Would the movie affect you any less if you can't grab its meaning? Perhaps the meaning in the words by Monsieur Oscar as father to his teenage daughter in his most realistic role: ""You are punished by being just yourself all your life."" Isn't it sad never let the world of imagination, illusion and fantasy pull you beyond reality, where you are just you? ... But can one only exist in a world of illusion and change masks one by one and forget what the real face is?

Denis Lavant, director-screenwriter Leos Carax's alter ego, works wonders here, changing into nine personalities during the course of movie. His face is fascinating - the face of  Socrates, and satyr,  murderer, and  wise tired clown.  Of modern actors, John Malkovich and Malcolm McDowell have such impressive faces... And so, Lavant's hero or, rather, heroes  travel all day long with Celine, the driver, passing striking views of Paris, impersonating different personalities, who are on the  weird, shocking, crazy, unbelievable missions, ordered by someone unknown, captured on the camera by someone unseen but always present.

I read somewhere that  idea of Motors came from  Carax interest and curiosity in  very long limousines, obsolescent powerful toys, whether messengers of the past in the future, or, on the contrary, from  future in the past, sort of motorized brontosaurs. What's inside, who is inside? The size is such that it is possible to live ... or to prepare for the transition from one life to another, and then,  third, and more.  And to appear in every life in a completely different roles - a  killer,  a victim, a beggar, a  millionaire, a  monster named Monsieur S***,  a caring father to a shy, awkward teenage girl ,  then the futuristic creature having sex  with the elastic beauty covered in red plastic...And then he returns home...Or does he?

And maybe Holy Motors is not just about us looking  at  stretched limousines, but about them looking at us and gossiping  about us and their future in hushed silence and darkness of the company ""Holy Motors""'  night garage.

But what Holy Motors is for sure - the message that was sent beyond our world - ""Katya, this is for you"" - the last frame of the movie with a picture and dedication to Leos Carax's  muse and beloved, Ekaterina Golubeva (1966-2011).",1356048000,34,4802,4.746682750301568
5525544,5,B00AX7PGQS,"It's not that most people have many expectations when seeing this movie.  I was unfamiliar with the Writer/Director Leos Carax, most of the lead actors and the trailer left me puzzled.  It's the ability of the movie to continually surprise, confuse and alternately either amuse or frustrate you that is its greatest delight.  There is a narrative throughout the film that involves Monsieur Oscar (Denis Levant) being chauffeured in a tacky limousine by a middle-aged, classically French beauty (Edith Scob).  He goes from ""job"" to ""job"" during the course of one day and becomes different characters, presented in a series of vignettes that are very different, mostly stand-alone stories filmed in different styles and moods.  Don't expect to learn much more about Monsieur Oscar.  You don't even know if he is really alive or dead and end the end it doesn't matter.  He's just a vehicle (metaphor?) to tell the different stories.  Some you will like more than others.  My friends I spoke to about this film didn't agree on which ones they liked.  They cover a pretty vast range of emotions in the human experience.  It's whatever strikes a chord with you.  The stories themselves can be enjoyed at face value but there is plenty of symbolism to give those who enjoy interpreting such things fodder for many a dinner party.  I haven't read any official reviews of this film but I did see a quote from Leos Carax that the film is (paraphrasing) ""not about the cinema... who would go see a movie about that""?  Well, for me that's confirmation that on one level that the film is indeed about cinema itself and how audiences expectations have changed.  In this sense, this is a movie for movie buffs which is probably why it has won so many awards.  That's just one of many themes running through it.  There are others that you may perceive... or not.  I loved this film while watching it and thinking about it for days later, which is not something I normally do.  If you can let go of the classic Hollywood storytelling model, you may be surprised how much you like this movie too.",1353888000,21,2078,4.706371191135734
5525545,3,B00AX7PGQS,"My first reaction was disappointment. The premise--a middle-aged man is shuttled around Paris in a white stretch limousine so that he can don disguises and act out a series of seemingly unrelated scenes as different people--has potential but ends up more arty than mind-blowing. There's melodrama but little real feeling, and no clear rules governing what unfolds, so the stakes feel low. This is a series of gestures, not a fully-realized world. Disappointingly for a movie that sets itself up to go practically anywhere, many of the vignettes are not that interesting, and the visual style has a dim-lit uniformity. Holy Motors feels like it could have been a lot weirder than it is.

And yet I found myself still thinking about it the next day. The boring parts receded in my memory, leaving the good bits to stand out more. Leading man Denis Lavant is a compelling presence, both as the various characters he inhabits and as the actor behind them, bone-weary in the back of a limo peeling off makeup. Likewise you can't fault director Leos Carax for lack of ambition. He's aiming for something specific and personal, if oddly muted. And the movie still has its go-for-broke moments, including two musical numbers, one of which is the most electrifying accordion intermission ever committed to film. I can't say that I enjoyed Holy Motors, or tell you if it's any good, but I'm glad I saw it.",1353283200,28,1395,4.836820083682008

5525562,4,B00AX7PGQS,"""Holy Motors"" is at once lyrically beautiful and unabashedly confounding. Director Leos Carax has made an utterly unique film that is so entirely unlike anything I've ever seen before that it is impossible to categorize in any relevant way. The film stars the amazingly versatile actor Denis Lavant as Mr. Oscar, a mysterious man who assumes nine completely unique identities in wholly separate storylines that are seamlessly integrated in unpredictable ways. The film plays on several levels, most obviously as an allegorical piece about the nature of life, dreams, and film through the years. The intriguing opening sequence in the theater and naming the character Mr. Oscar make the movie theme more obvious, but there is extensive symbolism throughout the film, some of which is fairly obvious, but most of which is challenging to obscure. The film is visually gorgeous, and every frame is interesting, but one thing's for sure: the film demands your full attention if you have any hope of keeping up.

The connecting fiber of the film is the dreamlike ""appointments"" Mr. Oscar has to keep throughout his ordeal-laden day. He is escorted to these appointments by Cline (the still lovely Edith Scob,) the limo driver of the netherworld. The film careens wildly between the appointments, and the suspense of what is coming next is almost palpable. One minute Lavant is running on a treadmill with a machine gun, the next minute there are snakes kissing before moving onto a flower eating scene in a cemetery. Note in the graveyard the tombstone that reads ""Visit My Website.""  Humorous images like this pop up at the least expected times during the film and vanish quickly leaving the viewer to question what all has been missed. There are, by the way, a couple of uses of nudity in a non-erotic arthouse manner; both scenes are far more disturbing than titillating, and in both examples I was wholly unprepared for the exposure.

I liked the metaphor of Oscar's limousine, which is also a makeup and prosthetic lab to enable his transformations: he is being transported in grand Hollywood style between fateful appointments. The dialogue is sparse and the English subtitles are excellent, but most of the nuances of the film are visual, and require viewer cooperation to connect the dots as to what's going on at any moment. Lavant is a stunningly brilliant actor who slips seamlessly between roles, though some stories require more thespian skill than others, one that I found especially challenging was the scene in which Theo is murdered. I have never seen another film killing as deliberately misleading until the very end, and the ability of Carax to lead the audience into thinking they know what is coming next only to completely alter their outlook in the least expected way possible is astounding. Although the dialogue is generally sparse, what there is is both wry and brilliant. When Cline suggests that Mr. Oscar is feeling ill, for instance, he replies ""I think I caught a cold killing the banker."" There's no sign in his voice that there should be anything out of the ordinary in that killing (which is another visual stunner.) Likewise the surreal nature of the film is manifested in more incidental dialogue. When there is an altercation between drivers one yells the scathing insult ""Ectoplasm on wheels!"" You'd have to look far to find dialogue like that elsewhere.

I found the final appointment the most disturbing and poignant of all. Kylie Minogue turns up as a beautiful flight attendant; she does a great job with the role, and even though it had not previously been a musical, you take in in stride when she breaks into song without warning, because that's just the kind of thing Carax can do effortlessly. As Cline finally drops the weary Mr. Oscar off at his home after his exhausting day, we get the one glimpse into his personal life as we see him interact with his longsuffering wife. This twist is one of the greatest delights in the film, and it would be positively criminal to reveal it. Even as Cline takes the limo back to the garage to put it to sleep with all the other limos, she reprises her famous identity from 1960's ""Eyes Without a Face,"" another coy nod at the cinematic roots of the film. I was also amused by the limos in the garage bantering back and forth before bedtime as they come to the realization they are all relics doomed to the scrapheap (""Old 5700-BC-78 is speaking the truth...."") The film is a dreamlike circle of life movie with many intentional ambiguities (it is sometimes impossible to know if the characters are dead or alive) anchored by the theatrical trope that's the glue that holds the film together.

""Holy Motors"" will be a very divisive love it or hate it movie. It is in your face and yet intensely subtle and is nearly impenetrable in a variety of ways. It is certainly not for the casual viewer, but if you love French cinema or you simply want to be challenged by a film that it alternately playful and morbid, it's definitely a film worth seeing.",1425686400,5,5028,4.814814814814815

5525569,5,B00AX7PGQS,"This movie is absolutely insane, and I mean that in the best possible way. It is an art film--I guess--but it's a rare film in that category that can both entertain you and make you think. It's elusive when you try to interpret it, but at the same time, it rewards multiple interpretations. You could call it a comment on the film/media industries. You could call it a comment on modern society and the multiple faces we have to wear (at home, at work, on social media, etc.). You could call it merely an abstract film that makes no comment but what the viewer thinks it does.

Whatever the case, it's fun. Don't try to figure it out as you're watching it--just sit back and enjoy the insanity of it all. Watch it alone and then watch it with friends. That's what I did, and I have to admit that I was very amused when one of my friends said, ""What the $^%$ did I just watch?!"" Then we had a thirty minute conversation about it. That is so rare with a film these days.

Ultimately, this film is like The Matrix or The Truman Show or Dark City--but without any of the exposition of those films.  Don't expect characters to say, ""Oh, here's some freaky stuff, but now I shall explain it to you.""  It's freaky.  It's fun.  It's intellectual without being off-putting.  And yes, there are some shocking images that other reviewers have noted.  I think those all serve to disorient the viewer.  Anyway, go out and watch it!",1407456000,,1418,4.402298850574713
5525570,5,B00AX7PGQS,"Saturday night, and I was looking for something different to watch.  Usually I'm all about sci-fi or zombie flicks, but both Amazon and NetFlix are looking a little picked over these days (c'mon guys, we really need some new titles).  So I did some googling for obscure movies and that led me to letterboxd.com, which brought me to 'Holy Motors'.

I really enjoyed it.  It's beautifully shot, very well acted, with an excellent script.  Is it confusing?  No, not really, although my opinion of what the film was about did change as things progressed.  The movie depicts a principality making the rounds through his day, with each round having him adopt a different persona to perform different activities, whether it be begging, performing motion capture video, portraying a disappointed father, killing a former friend, or dying in the arms of a loved one.  It is a tad slow in places, but so is life.  The slow bits provide time to reflect.

After finishing 'Holy Motors' and thinking about it a bit, I realized that I had just watched a day in the life of an ascended master.  Hats off to Mr. Carax for this.  Highly recommended.",1391904000,,1132,4.719387755102041

5525583,4,B00AX7PGQS,"""Holy Motors"" is nearly impossible to describe - it really needs to be seen to be believed (or appreciated).  I've seen over 4,000 movies, and it is easily one of the oddest.  I often dislike films that try so hard to be bizarre, but this one works despite itself.  There's not much of a narrative here.  Mr. Oscar (played by Denis Levant) has a mysterious job that involves being chauffeured around Paris in a stretch limo driven by Celine (played by the legendary Edith Scob).  His profession seems to revolve around putting on various costumes and elaborate makeup and acting out different lives, including playing a disfigured old woman and a sewer-dwelling troll.

Essentially, ""Holy Motors"" unfolds like a series of short films that meld together despite having little in common; none of them even have beginnings or endings - they're all middles.  If you want a linear narrative or a strong storyline, then you will probably hate this film. ""Holy Motors"" verges on pretentious, as director Leon Carax (The Lovers on the Bridge, Pola X) seems intent on confusing the audience and throwing everything he can at the camera.  A scene in which Levant and a female actress wear full body suits and writhe around as though simulating sex is particularly audacious.

Yet for me, it ends up working despite the pretentiousness, mostly because of Levant's extraordinary performance.  To call him brave here is an understatement - it verges on insane and he's frequently nothing short of repulsive.  I've never seen anything like it.  I wouldn't say that I truly enjoyed ""Holy Motors,"" and I doubt that many will; however, I was mesmerized at times, and that's a sign of good cinema.",1371945600,2,1679,4.893992932862191

I suspect that viewers will either love or hate ""Holy Motors,"" a surreal French drama that eventually falls victim to its own pretentiousness.

It tells the tale of an actor/quick-change artist who rides around Paris in a specially designed stretch-limo, donning various costumes and enacting bizarre movie-type scenes for paying customers. One moment he's a sewer-dwelling beast in search of a ""beauty;"" the next he's a hit man , then a female beggar, then a dying old man, even, at one point, a CGI effect come to life.

Written and directed by Leos Carax, the movie ultimately emerges as a cinematic Rorschach Test, open to whichever interpretation each member of the audience cares to get out of it. Is it about how we all eventually wind up donning masks and false identities as a means of escaping the crushing monotony of our daily lives? Or is it about how we use such masks to avoid showing ourselves and the world-at-large who we really are? Or is it a dissertation on the nature of art and the artist, or on the changing nature of movie making in an era in which the camera has become a ubiquitous part of everyday life, available to anyone and everyone at all times?

Who knows, and, frankly, who really cares? In terms of execution, Carax lacks the light hand and delicate touch of a Luis Bunuel from his late French period. ""Holy Motors,"" on the other hand, is redundant and, at times, downright unpleasant, and much too impressed with its own cleverness to be of much interest to any but the most esoteric-minded of viewers. But the Paris locales are nice.",1366243200,4,1578,4.6859205776173285

5525611,3,B00AX7PGQS,"""Holy Motors,"" Leos Carax's latest film, is fascinating and baffling at the same time. Filled with cinematic references, the film is puzzling, funny, strange and often dark. It's a Carax film made for Carax. We just follow his journey.

The film centers on a mysterious man played by Denis Lavant, who moves around in Paris in a white limousine. The driver Cline (dith Scob) calls him M. Oscar, but nothing is certain, except that ""Oscar,"" who always looks tired, wears make-ups in the car and plays eleven roles after reading the dossiers given to him. In short, he lives eleven different ""lives"" over a course of a day.

""Holy Motors"" is full of cinematic allusions including some major works like ""The Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Godzilla"" (what a combination!) as well as ""Max My Love"" and Carax's own ""The Lovers on the Bridge."" Kylie Minogue's character would remind us of Juliette Binoche's heroine on the Pont Neuf.

The film can be interpreted in many ways. But we should also keep in mind that Leos Carax's last feature film ""Pola X"" (made in 1999) was based on Herman Melville's unconventional novel ""Pierre: or, The Ambiguities.""

I know it's a matter of taste, but for all the film's touching moments, I didn't like ""Holy Motors"" very much, not because of its ambiguous nature, but because of its pervading pessimistic tone. Considering the death of Carax's Yekaterina Golubeva (her brief footage inserted at the end of the film), this is only natural.

5525613,4,B00AX7PGQS,"Wow!!! This is not a movie for the casual viewer. But if you love film as art, and have some patience, there are huge rewards here.

Here's the scoop. A man in a room has a key on his finger (or part of his finger?) and opens a concealed door onto the balcony of a cinema where a naked child is running down an aisle (nod to Au revoir les enfants?) followed by a slobbering, loose-skinned hound dog (nod to Un chien andalou?) He looks at the movie screen where we are introduced to Mr. Oscar, who is chauffeured around in a stretch limo and has to  meet ""appointments."" These appointments require him to adorn theater make-up and perform different roles. Some roles are not even human. So what's the scoop?

This is as off beat a movie as you're likely to see. If there is a thread running through it that can be pulled to gather the disparate elements you'll need to dig deep to find it. Like a film by David Lynch or a play by Harold Pinter, you feel lost. But there's something going on that might be making sense at some level. Maybe I just couldn't find it, or maybe this is cinema for cinema's sake. In some scenes Mr. Oscar merely seems to be playing a role. In others he seems to be a real person and the people he interacts with know him as that person. In one scene, the person he interfaces with has the same job as him. Really off the wall.

This is a beautifully shot and seamlessly edited film. The music is good and Denis Lavant, as Mr. Oscar, is really good. Edith Scob plays his chauffeur. In one scene she dons a mask similar to the one she wore in 1960's ""Eyes Without a Face"" which makes me think that the director, Leos Carax wants to treat his audience to the joys of film.

This is one heck of a film. Again, it's not for everyone. But if you are a lover of the art, this is for you.",1364774400,,1806,4.148571428571429
5525614,2,B00AX7PGQS,"""Holy Motors"" is an attempt at a reflexive film about making and watching films by French director Leos Carax. Making a film about films that doesn't alienate the audience is a difficult trick to pull off. Unfortunately, ""Holy Motors"" is a lesson in how not to go about it. We follow Mr. Oscar (Denis Lavant) over the course of a long day, as he is driven around Paris in a limousine by an assistant named Cline (Edith Scob), from one ""appointment"" to the next. In each of nine appointments, Mr. Oscar, a great actor and master of disguise, takes on a different role: a hunched elderly panhandler, a character in an erotic computer-generated game decked out in a catsuit with motion-capture sensors, a middle-aged family man, a mustachioed murderer, Mr. Merde, a grotesque character taken from Carax' work in the film ""Tokyo!"" (2008). The list goes on.

It seems that Oscar is an actor, working for a mysterious employer who criticizes his performance as being ""tired"" midway through the film. But this exercise is meaningless without context. We never see what impact Oscar's hard work and dedication to craft has on him. On the few occasions that he seems to step out of character, it is just another layer of the performance, a fiction inside of a fiction inside of a fiction. Oscar says he does it ""for the beauty of the act"". I would have thought he did it for the money. He complains that he can't perform well when he can't see the camera, and the cameras have become too small to see. That doesn't make him sympathetic or interesting. He's self-indulgent and whiney.

Perhaps the story is to be found in Oscar's employer. Notwithstanding the personification of this employer in one scene, Oscar's employer is, of course, the audience. It's us. But I can't say that Oscar's histrionics had any effect on me. Not even one is the least bit engaging or intriguing. A couple of them are unbearably maudlin. So if ""Holy Motors"" is asking why we crave this kind of spectacle from other people, well, we don't. Watching Oscar's ""appointments"" would put a crackhead into a coma. This film is an hour and 50 minutes long, but the material could have been packed into a film half that length. I think Oscar's real motive for wearing himself out, physically and emotionally, putting on shows for invisible audiences, is that he doesn't know how to do anything else. I suspect that is also Leos Carax' motive. In French with optional English subtitles.",1364774400,4,2447,4.741784037558685

There is some innovative thinking in this movie, but there is also some stupid imagery from a college film (like cars talking while their taillights flash?

5525617,5,B00AX7PGQS,"For cineaste, many are calling ""Holy Motors"", directed by Leos Carax (""The Lovers on the Bridge"", ""Mauvais sang"", ""Boy Meets Girl"") as a true masterpiece!

Cahiers du Cinema voted the ""Holy Motors"" as the #1 film of 2012.

Richard Brody of ""The New Yorker"" praised the film writing, ""These images and sounds that reveal the mind in matter and the soul in bodies suggest Carax's ultimate definition of the cinema, and it's one of the best and grandest that a movie has ever offered.""

For French cinema, as names such as Jean Renoir, Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, Andre Bazin, Jacques Rivette (to name a few) are highly regarded for their part in cinema that was know as the ""French New Wave"", Leos Carax is one who was influenced by it, especially the works of Godard.

And similar to Godard who worked with Anna Karina, Jean-Paul Belmondo or Jean-Pierre Leaud, Carax would work with Juliette Binoche and Denis Lavant.

While his last film was back in 1999 with ""Pola X"" and taking part in a segment for the film ""Tokyo!"" in 2008, it was the latter in which he worked against with Denis Lavant, that Leos wanted to create a film written specifically with Lavant in mind.  It took five years for Leos to find funding for the film and sure enough was able to get funding from companies in France and Germany.

And now this critically acclaimed film will be released on Blu-ray courtesy of Indomina in Feb. 2013.

I will first say that describing this film doesn't do any justice. ""Holy Motors"" is a film that must be experienced and watched against due to its complexity and the fact that cineaste may find references or find something profound with each segment.  And each segment features actor Denis Lavant in multiple roles.

But the film begins with a character known as ""Le Dormeur"" who awakens and finds a secret door in his apartment where he ends up in a theater where people are watching King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" and surreal imagery begins with a young child and a very large dog walks around the aisle.

We are then introduced to Oscar, a man who rides in a white limousine driven by Celine (portrayed by Edith Scob).  While she drives him to multiple appointments, Oscar's job involves wearing makeup and costumes and performing various scenarios, not on stage or for the big screen but what appears to be reality (or is it?).

One scene involves Oscar in character wearing a motion capture suit and meeting up with a woman also wearing a motion capture suit and the two engaging in a simulated sex scene while motion capture is recording their movements.  We watch as Oscar then dresses up as the sewer troll Monsieur Merde (which was originally featured in the film ""Tokyo!"").

During a model photoshoot with model Kay M (portrayed by Eva Mendes), he captures her and brings her down to his cave/sewer where he begins eating the contents in her purse and her hair.  But he then begins to modify her dress towards his own sense of fashion.

Another sequence includes Oscar playing a father who picks up his daughter from a party, to be told of how much fun she was having until he catches her in a lie.  And he finds out in reality, no guys want to party with her and he begins to question why she isn't attracting any guys.

Another sequences features Oscar as a man who murders another man.  But when he shaves the man's beard, the man turns out to look exactly like the person who is responsible for the murder.

Another sequence involves meeting up with an old flame, Eva (portrayed by Kylie Minogue) and the two going out to talk to each other and reminisce of the past.

We see many more appointments as Oscar takes part in a man who is dying, a musical, a gangster and many more.

VIDEO:

""Holy Motors"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and to bring costs down, despite not being known to work with digital film (and even a character mentioning big film cameras being missed), shot with an Red Epic camera, the cinematography by Caroline Champetier (""Tokyo!"", ""Of Gods and Men"", ""Ponette"") is gorgeous!  The film is well-contrast and because every sequence is difference, scenes such as the motion capture scene to scenes visiting various areas in France is quite beautiful to see.  The film is well-contrast and I didn't detect an aliasing, banding or artifacts during my viewing of the film.

I was a bit surprised as the Artificial Eye release features a French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless soundtrack, but I went to confirm on my receiver to see if its DTS-HD MA 5.1 but it shows up as Dolby digital 5.1.  For the most part, the 5.1 soundtrack does offer much more dynamic range than the stereo track.  Dialogue and music are crystal clear and I detected no pops or hiss during my viewing of the film.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Holy Motors"" come with the following special features:

  Drive In: Making of Holy Motors - (47:28) A featurette on the behind-the-scenes making of ""Holy Motors"".
  Kylie Minogue - (13:22) Kylie Minogue is interviewed on how she was cast for the film and her impressions of ""Holy Motors"".
  Trailer - Featuring two trailers (2:32) and (1:51).

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Holy Motors"" is what I would call profound cinema.

Cinema intended to make one think, complex to make one re-watch and entertaining because of how audacious and surprising the film is.

Is the film intended to be a message from filmmaker Leos Carax or is this a tribute to cinema and each segment/appointment featured in the film is a tribute to other cinema?  Was the character of Celine wearing a mask as homage to Georges Franju's 1960 film ""Les yeux sans visage"" (Eyes without a Face)?  Was Kylie Minogue's Eva Grace modeled after actress Jean Seberg, best known for starring in Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 film ""A bout de souffle"" (Breathless)?  Was the musical inspired from ""The Umbrella's of Cherbourg""?  Or what about the scene with chimps was that a homage to the Charlotte Rampling film, ""Max Mon Amour""?

We see references to Carax' previous work such as the motion capture sequence that is reminiscent to a scene in ""Mauvais Sang"", a limo scene reminiscent of a scene from ""Boy Meets Girl"", the beggar from ""Les amants du Pont-Neuf"" (The Lovers on the Bridge) and we also see the hideous Monsieur Merde of ""Tokyo!"" making his appearance.

I watched ""Holy Motors"" and my feeling was that Leos Carax, in going digital for this film, it was a homage but also like a somber goodbye to cinema of the past.  I have no question in my mind that the film contains imagery and situations and possibly a form of communication from Carax of how he feels about society, about himself, about cinema.

But that is what I see in this amazing film.  Segments that provide something new, unique and you can't help but wanting to watch it again and again to see what you got out of it.

It's quite amazing of how he constructed a character that is an actor that takes his acting not on stage or movies but to actual settings in Paris.  There is no need to ask if this segment was real or if it was imaginary, the point of the film is to make one think, to make one entertained and to escape the banalities of modern cinema.  Being creative, imaginative and a hint of an Elegiac.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic but I do question the choice of going Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of DTS-HD MA like the European Artificial Eye release.  But with that being said, both are different in terms of special features with thie Indomina release featuring a making of and an interview with Kylie Minogue.

Overall, ""Holy Motors"" is breath of fresh air, something unique and different when compared to today's modern cinema and possibly a film that many consider as filmmaker Leos Carax' Magnum Opus.  Entertaining, complex and wonderful!",1364601600,2,7919,4.678468208092486
5525618,5,B00AX7PGQS,"`Holy Motors' has been that one film released this year that has garnered so much critical attention for its mere being that I was convinced all year it was going to be the best thing I'd ever seen.  The amount of outlandish and unrestrained hyperbole that was spewed all over this film for months had me anticipating the second coming.  It has me recalling when `Margaret' was finally released after being shelved for like five years and people saw it and claimed it to be the most remarkable film they had ever laid eyes on.  That was just a year ago.  Already people have abandoned that notion and moved onto Leos Carax's `Holy Motors'.

The similarity between the two entities doesn't die there, for my reaction to each over-hyped masterpiece is the same; they are both the best and worst films of their respective years, which leaves me at a bit of a crossroads as far as my own personal attachment to the piece is concerned.

The main focal point of almost all the `talk' surrounding `Holy Motors' has been the fact that absolutely no one has any idea what this film is about, and so by virtue of that sentiment it must be about all things at once, thus becoming the only film in the history of cinema to say everything there is to say about absolutely nothing at all.  I concur with this assessment because, when all is said and done and the limousines have stopped talking to one another I feel as though I have experiences something completely unlike anything else and yet I have no idea what it is that I have just experienced.  Somewhere between the makeshift parade through the streets and the Disney inspired swan song in an abandoned building this film gained and lost and then gained me again and yet I'm still struggling to put any of it all together.

The basic gist of the story follows Mr. Oscar as he travels in a limo with Celine, his driver, from one appointment to the next.  At each appointment he transforms into someone different and causes chaos of some sort, whether it be emotionally or physically.  Each segment flows into the next, each feeling somewhat cohesive despite being drastically separate and by the end of the film they all seem to become a part of a larger whole.  The many themes approached by this film are as varied and as complex as the many genres that the film tackles, explores and exemplifies.  If balances the style with the substance in a way that I've never seen a film do before because the substance becomes a part of the style and visa-versa.

For the sake of trying to makes and tails of this film, and for the mere fact that that is what we are supposed to do with films like this, I'll throw out some random thoughts I had while watching the film and see if any of them stick.

Carax, to me, seems to be exploring the death of cinema.  That was one of the more overwhelming feelings I had while watching the film, as if Lavant's Mr. Oscar represented cinema of the past and his journey to the film's end was like watching it slowly become corroded by new entities and whims and eventually die out.  It became conformed and `tired'; stripped of its life and buoyancy thanks to the weighted feeling of change.  In a way, I felt as if this signified a deeper stance on the more universal feeling of life's progression in general, the way that we as individuals fear adaptation and grow `tired' of the pressure to conform.

But there is more.

Within each segment, we are introduced to various characters, not only through Lavant's multi-faceted performance by through the various people he comes across.  In each of these pairings we are shown another side to Mr. Oscar and thus given a chance to evaluate the themes of the film.  The remorse of lives unfulfilled, the pain through stunted conversation and the tragedy of misunderstanding loom all over these acts and display a form of humanity that feels authentic and raw without becoming betrayed by theatrics (despite containing moments of outlandishness).  The use of masks and makeup as a way to transcend daily routines give an air of melancholy with regard to the mundane quality of life as we live it and the need or desire to make it something more agreeable.

And yet I'm brought back to the central theme of film itself, for `Holy Motors' is above all else (at least in my eyes) a film about film and the love of film and the passion behind keeping film alive.

All hyperbole aside, `Holy Motors' is an experience.  Depending on how you react to that experience will of course shape what it is you actually take away from it, but there is no denying that `Holy Motors' is a film that defines film, whether that be in a good or bad way.  There are few films that can rest on that merit alone.  Whether you love or hate this film, the bottom line is that you lived it.  Say what you must, but the film's greatest asset is probably the fact that everyone walks away feeling something totally different, and so it has the ability to become all things to all people while seemingly being about absolutely nothing at all.",1364515200,4,5033,4.530386740331492

5525620,3,B00AX7PGQS,"Don't really know what to think of this film.  It's hard to review something that has such a 5 star performer in a film that, while I can't give it as high marks as the performer, I have to give it some for its ingenuity, style, imagination, etc.  Truthfully, I don't want to sit through this again, but then, if I had to watch it over, I would probably not fall asleep or be bored, and I might get something out of it, like maybe a clearer understanding.  It's a very metaphysical journey this film takes you on, and, if your into spirituality and stuff like that you just probably may find a lot that would be valuable to you.  Hell, I didn't understand 2001, A Space Odyssey in my 20's, except it was good to watch the colors and get high on it, but then I actually read the book and then when I saw the movie again, I really, really understood it and think it is way up there in the classic film category.  Maybe, this film might be like that.  I don't know, it's just I'm now in my 60's and my journey, while not at an end, is closer to an ending and I just don't think about these things that much anymore.  I'm not that afraid of things anymore, so I'm not the searcher I once was.  I would say, this film is for the searcher out there who is still looking for answers.",1364342400,2,1276,4.096385542168675

Thinking of its proper ancestors, my thoughts turned to the two ""Jeans"" (Vigo and Cocteau) and Luis Bunuel, but cinematic pioneer George Melies is its truest primal predecessor. ""Holy Motors"" updates the magic lantern of cinema to our own time.",1364256000,2,657,4.721739130434782

5525626,5,B00AX7PGQS,"Holy Motors was my favorite film of 2012.  A tour de force by Leos Carax. Denis Lavant playing 11 characters: A ratty gnome from the sewers who kidnaps supermodel Eva Mendez, a beggar woman, a man-lizard engaged in intercourse, an assassin who has to murder himself and an accordionist leader of a rogue band to name a few.

One minute we're in the throes of heavy drama or comical melodrama, followed by absurd comedy, then horror and more comedy.. An impromptu accordion romp, video game alien sex, Edith Scob reprising her role in Eyes without a Face, talking white limousines, penile prosthetics, Kylie Minogue's nod to Jean Seberg, a musical number, chimpanzee children, doppelgangers and more...

all this dancing around an adroit commentary on Social Media, the Facebook generation, technology & sexual disconnection. I guarantee you will not find a more inventive film this year or maybe this decade.",1363305600,7,908,5.080536912751678

I became bored about 30 minutes in but kept watching for something more....it never came.  The only way it is thought provoking is because you find yourself trying to make up a plot and a reason to justify the last two hours that you wasted of your life.

5525632,3,B00AX7PGQS,"The premise of the film is fairly easy to comprehend, although many reviewers seem puzzled by the format and editing. The main character, played by Denis Lavant, is a highly paid mercenary actor aptly named Oscar. His clients hire him to act out their fantasies in real life by seemingly abruptly intruding into their everyday existence and playing out some oddball fantasy script. To wit, Kay M (played by Eva Mendez) is a woman with obvious image issues who goes from preening at a fashion shoot to being kidnapped by a hobo (played by Oscar). The hobo takes her into a cave where instead of raping her, makes her wear a burka... The point of this particular tale being a philosophical inquiry into what is the correct 'posture' for a strong beautiful woman to adopt, struggling between the extremes of narcissism as a fashion model to a retiring beauty hidden by a full body burka.

The other tales follow a similar psychodrama style, wherein a banker pretends to get murdered at a restaurant on the Champs Elyses, a teenager acts out some unresolved father-daughter conflict and a flight attendant (played by Kylie Minogue) mourns her lost lover before committing suicide.

The pacing of the movie is slow by American standards and will no doubt tax the average viewer. The different chapters can be seen as small stand alone short subjects, but really only come into focus when viewed as a whole. The ending is perhaps the most surprising part because it seems to confuse the matter even more.  If however you keep in mind the film's beginning and the fact that Oscar is driven around in a 'holy' limousine, perhaps what we are witnessing are Oscar's own post-mortem fantasies.

There are many hidden clues and nods to film buffs, from the main characters' name Oscar, to the Jean Seberg wig sported by Kylie Minogue. However, I find the rhythm to be ponderous, as is won't for typical French fare. Additionally some areas feel unresolved, like the motion capture sex scene which feels amateurish and shows Leos Carax' disdain for the splashy computer generated films of today. There are other hints of his displeasure with modern day moviemaking as when Oscar complains to Michel Piccoli that actors can no longer even see the cameras anymore because they are so miniaturized. Even the cars complain at the end that they feel obsolete. Perhaps the most pervading message Leos Carax tries to get across is a sense of regret over the loss of glamour in films today. There is a certain charm to this posture that I somewhat share although I feel this particular movie could have used some sharper crafting.",1362873600,5,2609,4.816964285714286
5525633,4,B00AX7PGQS,"This is a weird one; not really for someone who isn't prepared to think, and has some extreme moments so should not be considered family-friendly. I do not suggest watching this if you are easily offended, as there is one scene with gratuitous nudity--albeit blurred out in the edition I watched--and some over-the-top, almost comically so--violence (not much, but it is there).

Not a particularly complex film, but very dense with symbolism and film imagery and memes; this is a film that will probably leave you scratching your head and thinking ""What did I just watch?"" However, the lack of complexity is subjective; this film will be as complex or as simple as you decide it is, since it's interpretation is very much up to the observer.

Personally, I feel that the key to ""understanding"" it (if this is even necessary) is to realize who the person at the beginning of the film is; with that understanding, suddenly the whole film takes on a whole new meaning and became (for me, anyway) clearly understandable.

They're only likely to give you spoilers or preconceptions, and although the film is well worth watching more than once, I would not want anyone to miss the type of first-time experience that I had:  just strolling into an art-house theater, knowing nothing about the movie, and wow.

There are at least ten scenes, any one of which is itself worth the money and the time spent viewing, because you will not forget them.  And NO, don't go sneaking selected peeks on YouTube.  Buy or rent the whole thing.  Or see it on the big screen at a theater near you, if possible, then procure it online if desired.  I am not into Best Picture of the Year awards or top-ten lists.  There are lots of good movies to see.  But as a person of eclectic tastes, I do have a list of films that have stayed with me.  They range from foreign films like Jesus of Montreal, Pan's Labyrinth, and The Return of Martin Guerre to American mainstreamers like Saturday Night Fever and Ace Ventura Pet Detective (one of the great works of American cinema), to non-mainstreamers like Henry Fool (another one) ... and now, most definitely, don't miss it folks, Holy Motors.",1362355200,4,1253,4.524444444444445
5525635,3,B00AX7PGQS,"From the opening sequence wherein our director Leos Carax (perhaps playing himself, perhaps not) awakens (or only dreams he awakens) in a dark Lynchian hotel room only to grope his way along an artificial wilderness of wallpaper (visual reference to Nic Roeg's Man Who Fell to Earth) towards a secret door hidden in a wall that leads down a long corridor and into a Lynchian movie theatre, we know we are in, well, the land of David Lynch. Unfortunately, this opening sequence that plays like an homage to Lynch (especially the Lynch of Mulholland Drive) promises a more interesting meditation on film history and contemporary reality than the one that Carax actually delivers. Despite that evocative prologue, Holy Motors is not a very complex film really. It is simply the story of an actor, and the film is about a day in the life of that actor. We get to spend an entire day with the very busy Oscar (Carax regular Denis Lavant) as he rides in a limo from location to location, and from part to part. We never see any producers or directors or cameras or crew, all we know is that he receives scripts (or assignments) from some unknown agency and that his performances begin as soon as he exits the limo. It must be said that Lavant is an extremely visceral and versatile performer. In the course of one working day, he plays a street person with a severe slouch, a stunt man, a sewer troll, an assassin, an accordion player, an actor playing a death scene from a Henry James novel, a father, and someone's old flame etc...Suffice it to say, he is the kind of actor who wants to spend as little time as possible being himself (unless, of course, you view the playacting as opportunities to, in fact, be himself, and this is certainly a distinct possibility). The film wants to be a meditation on the art of acting (and perhaps on acting as existential condition) but it also wants to be a meditation on our uses of film to escape (and/or expand) that existential condition. Certainly the digital age offers us more and more elaborate and more and more immersive ways to both escape and become ourselves. But in this particular film, there is so little connective tissue between performances, so little chance to reflect upon them, that it's hard to tell precisely what Carax wants the cumulative effect of these performances to be. Like Mulholland Drive, Holy Motors functions as a meditation on our ability to play more than one part and live in more than one reality (or simulation of reality) at a time (and on art, specifically cinema, as a kind of ontological enabler) but where Mulholland Drive succeeds in thoroughly excavating its singular subject's dreams and desires only to reveal the seedy reality seething beneath the Hollywood veneer, Holy Motors never really probes its central character's consciousness and so we never know why he is an actor or what motivates his performances or how he may view the connection between his own performances and movie history. Granted, some of the performances are quite interesting (my personal favorite is the sewer troll who kidnaps a fashion model and this very funny sequence is maybe the funniest thing I've seen on film this year) but the individual sequences seem like individual tableux more than parts of a synergisitc whole. And, as it turns out, the troll sequence was indeed originally made as a short film (and included in the omnibus collection entitled Tokyo). A friend of mine who is a big fan of Carax defended the film by saying Carax is a director of moments, but, I argued back, in order for a film to be succesful the moments/the individual performances have to add up to something and in this film they do not. After each performance (each of which plays like a separate short film) our actor simply moves onto another performance and then another performance. Sometimes the performances are merely comic, other times they are disturbingly real as in the scene when Lavant plays father to a teenage girl. In this scene, we are uncertain if the actor is acting or playing out a scene from his own life or some comnbination thereof (and this is compelling). But Carax seems content to leave it at that and to simply leave us wondering what the significance of this scene might be. And so rich and resonant as each performance might be, the actor remains a cipher throughout the film---we are given no way to connect to him, no access to who he is (other than through his performances which reveal nothing specific). It would seem that Carax is more interested in being clever (and foregrounding his clever homages to other art films---which sometimes veer perilously close to parody) than in making any real point about the mysteries or origins of art or identity or culture (or cinema). In other words, for all its trippiness, Mulholland Drive does, in the end, add up to something quite extraordinary and insightful (and offers a frightening but facinationg glimpse into the psychic processes of one highly delusional discontent) whereas Holy Motors simply does not add up to anything specific enough to merit much reflection. Even that opening scene that features Carax standing in the balcony of a movie theatre in his pajamas (by far the best scene in the film) pales in comparison to the Club Silencio scene in Mulholland Drive. Carax is ultimately less interested in making you think than in inviting you to giggle as you identify reference points (Lynch, Roeg, Lynch, Lang, Lynch, Fellini, Lynch, Antonioni, Lynch, Godard, Lynch, Demy, Lynch). And Lavant is just the guy--the human or subhuman cipher-- who will do whatever Carax wants him to. The individual performances might leave you breathless, but the overall effect will leave you groping in the dark for something that isn't there. Each critic that reviews this film seems to fill in its absences for themselves and to see in them exactly what they want to see.

Spoiler Alert: The film does have the potential to be what some viewers seem to want it to be (existentially complex), but despite all that guesswork (is he still acting?, is this really him now?) the ending undermines the complexity it works so hard to build. The ending (or double-ending: monkey house and limo garage) both suggest that Oscar (Lavant) is just a performing monkey and that the limos are more reflective than their charges. So the whole thing becomes a postmodernist joke. The only question is whether Carax really buys this hokum about the end of individual subjectivity or if he is parodying that as well. It would seem that Carax is undecided as to whether he wants us to see Oscar as a man or as some posthuman X. And that indecision about what kind of vision of humanity or posthumanity he wants to put forth prevents this interesting film from becoming a profound one.",1362268800,3,6794,4.787052810902896

He then leaves his home and enters the long white limo. He is given a book and begins to trasform himself into a character. He has 9 clients this day.

8558764,3,B00AX7PGQS,"I'm kind of shocked I didn't love this. I have a huge penchant for surrealist filmmaking and my current top four favorite films all have varying degrees of surrealism, most notably Bergman's Persona and Lynch's Mulholland Dr. (the others are The Shining and 2001: A Space Odyssey, if you're curious). Given the hype behind this film from critics and cinephiles alike as one of the best avant-garde and surrealist works of the current decade, I thought this would be a surefire winner for me. Sadly, I just didn't connect with it in the way others have seemed to.

It is certainly interesting as a piece of existentialist filmmaking that ruminates over how easy it is for people to become lost in the various ""roles"" they play as well as humanity's endless search for worth, meaning, and purpose. But there's just something about the execution of the film that didn't appeal to me. It had a very detached quality and although it showed me a lot of striking images, it failed to compel me intellectually or emotionally. It's hard to pinpoint why that may have been the case as abstract films like this have no rules and thus no clear recipe for success to follow. It was likely the combination of many things, though I feel chief among them was an overall lack of forward momentum or intrigue. The film is very fragmented and episodic by design, and I felt that while each ""episode"" was a mildly interesting vignette, the film didn't weave them together in a way that generated a sense of propulsion or growth towards a bigger picture. Yes, the existentialist musings of the film did become more apparent as it progressed and it didn't feel entirely directionless by any means, but I just didn't find that progression terribly compelling or satisfying as it was. Perhaps it'll click with me more on a future viewing should I decide to return to it.

In a movie, you are watching expert actors portraying the final living moments of an man with his beloved niece and yet you forget that they are actors and you enter into it and feel it, just like you forget that a movie soundtrack is very artificial and if you were walking down the street and suddenly a huge swell of music came out of nowhere, it would scare the hell out of you. But we have these intimate moments where we forget the roles we're playing and for a moment we're not just ships passing in the night and that moment is all that there is.",1519430400,,816,4.339869281045751
8558766,5,B00AX7PGQS,"I'm not an analytical movie watcher, I'm a ""let art flow over you"" movie watcher and this movie flows over me well. If you have to know who is who and what is what and why who is doing what don't even, but if you like wildly creative weirdness give it a shot. The many characters/performances of Denis Lavant are fantastic.",1517529600,,323,4.311475409836065
8558767,5,B00AX7PGQS,One of my favorite films of late. I love Lavant and Carax working together.,1509235200,,75,4.428571428571429
8558768,4,B00AX7PGQS,"Leo Carax adresses the cinema a bnew dimension. And that's a good point to his favour. Imagery, allegorical situations, dazzling images thorugh a frantic script with good doses of black humor, spiced with sublime irreverence and certain surrealistic visions.

The initial images captured m,e my whole attention. because it made me think on Blood of a poet's Jean Cocteau. But as the film goes on, you understand that even the narrative pulse is sustantially altered ( a sort of Peter Greenaway with Ken Russell; you know what I mean).

Disturbing, poignant, tense, provocative and mordacious. But once the film is over you think the final sequence is more than a bitter reflection about the human condition.

Carax alludes to many filmakers of the past: Jean Luc Besson, Terry Gilliam, Peter Greenaway, Robert Bresson and Federico Fellini. But you will be challenged with this artistic proposal that definitively demands from you your maxim attention.

If you accept these rules of game please go on; but if you don't, please cross the street!!!",1502236800,,1045,5.093567251461988
