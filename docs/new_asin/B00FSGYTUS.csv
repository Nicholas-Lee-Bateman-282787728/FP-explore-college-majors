6030819,4,B00FSGYTUS,"I know squat about Doug Stanhope but have been indulging in Stand-up videos as of late so I thought I'd give it a shot. This is really creepy/funny. You'll laugh and squirm at the same time.

Here's the scoop. Stanhope does his routine in a smallish venue in Portland. He takes things that are nowhere near funny at their core and somehow makes them hilarious. This man has a rare gift.

He tackles things like the death of his mother. She was wrestling with emphysema and decided to end her life in her way. He talks about that and how he and his brother assisted her. Now. How could a story of someone's mother committing suicide be funny!? You have to see this to believe it but you'll be rolling on the floor. hen he tackles issues about causes. Breast cancer awareness, the Occupy Movement et al and shows how silly our handling of these causes is. I have not participated in them because I have my own thoughts concerning wall street and the American Cancer Association and, after seeing this I'm glad I haven't participated. Everyone needs to see this to get a truly brilliant take on how they should approach any cause in the future.

He also deals with his homosexuality in a way that nearly had me rolling on the floor. His take on fantasy football (his fantasy with the players) is so openly pornographic it left me squirming in my seat.

Stanhope might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those among you who are adventurous in your comedy, he pays huge dividends.",1387411200,6,1478,4.503731343283582
6030820,5,B00FSGYTUS,"This is one of my favorite works of his. I have only listened to the audio of this, but I expect the DVD to be even better. There are some absolutely brilliant lines in this that only Stanhope could have come up with.

I loved this, but you probably won't if you do not enjoy dark, vulgar comedy.",1386892800,2,296,4.103448275862069

8618484,5,B00FSGYTUS,"Doug Stanhope is an excellent comedian. He is naturally smart, talented and very modern. Do people still say ""edgy?"" I cried a little at the section about his mom. It was hard-core, really moving and sad. But, that made the jokes even more hilarious. Be aware there is some sexual stuff toward the end. Also, there is pro-LGBT content, which I found very refreshing.",1403136000,,366,4.734375
