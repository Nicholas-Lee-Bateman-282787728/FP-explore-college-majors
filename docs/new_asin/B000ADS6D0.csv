2385647,3,B000ADS6D0,"Fans of the novel by Fredrick Forsyth will more than likely be disappointed. But if you are interested in seeing a decent spy thriller, Then I would recommend this. The film sports a good and its got some high production values.

The cast is a good which is awlays a plus. Patrick Swayze fits the role of Jason Monk perfectly and bares quite a resemblance to the character in the novel. Patrick Bergin and Ben Cross are excellent as the villains. But the best acted part in the film has to go to Micael York for his role of Sir Nigel Irvine. Joss Ackland also gives a good, underused performance as the Russian General turned presidential candidate.

Also on the plus side,the production values are high. The action sequences are good and exciting. The locations look real and are obviously not faked and the score is one of the best I've heard recently in a TV production.

On the downside, the film's plot and its length are a downside. Most of the novel is scrapped and the great Black Manifesto is replaced (for the most part) by a virus. The addition of Monk's daughter and the female FSB agent are also added on to the novel's plot and are often irrelevant to the main part of the story. The plot is highly unbelievable and the duologue come in the tons in this film and winds it down several times.
The biggest flaw is the ending which is a let down compared to the ending of the noval and in either case is an anti-climactic ending if there ever was one.

Despite these flaws, Icon is still watchable and, while not faithful to the novel, is a decent spy thriller. It has a good cast and some good prodution values which help to even out it flaws. Fans of the nvoel may be disapointed but fans of spy thriller should find plenty to enjoy.",1217635200,2,1746,4.396284829721362
2385648,4,B000ADS6D0,"First of all, yes the main baddie was a Russian, but to bring him down required not only Patrick Swayze's character, Monk, but also the woman agent of the FSB and also Monk's Russian friend. What's more, a Russian general is portrayed as a hero to his country, both past (his refusal to butcher Chechneyans) and in present (he orders the troops not to fire on the demonstrators). Also there were two morally ambiguous to downright evil Americans involved in the plot as well. As for Patrick Swayze being 50, get over it - he handled his action scenes quite well. All in all an enjoyable mini-series from Hallmark/Forsythe.",1193788800,2,622,4.715596330275229
2385649,1,B000ADS6D0,"Icon brings to the screen the highly unlikely scenario that the Russian president would unleash deadly viruses on most, if not all, ethnic minorities living within the Russian Federation.

The film starts off very well with a James Bondish beginning and continues so, up until about 15 minutes into the movie; from then on it's downhill all the way to the very bottom.

The good things first:

1) Annika Peterson (who is GORGEOUS)!

2) The music is really good.

3) It provides for some GREAT scenery of Moscow.

On the negative side now:

1) It's the same old/usual clichs involving one of Hollywood's favorite villains/scapegoats: the Russians  (surprisingly there were no Serbs or Germans in this one...).  Can we not find something more original than the USUAL crazy/deranged/dangerous Russian ""boogieman"" (or the USUAL German/Nazi ""bad guy"" clich for that matter), together with the leading to the USUAL need to be rescued by the benevolent Anglo-Americans?  Is that too much to ask?  Why aren't the Turks or the Israelis ever the villains or even the Portuguese, the Swiss or the Swedes (names of countries chosen randomly)?

2) Bad choice of actors.  The aged Patrick Swayze does not live up to our expectations in his role as Jason Monk.  Moreover, the choices for Komarov and the American campaign manager are poor at best.  In all these cases, the actors' performances are disheartening and subsequently they are not convincing in their roles.

3) The FSB has the ability to track down and kill everyone except the ""heroes""...

4) Weak car chases and action scenes serve more to annoy than to entertain.

5) How did the girl, Elena, survive all these years without parents in a country where the economy has seen better days, yet alone have a gorgeous, big apartment (???), not to mention her superb handling of computers and surveillance equipment!

6) What's the point of the fictitious/non-existent Russian Liberation ""terrorist movement"" when there are real Chechen terrorists out there?  Oh, I forgot; the Russians have to be the baddies while the Chechens are the poor victims...  Have mercy on us, please!

7) To call the ending ""predictable"" is the understatement of the year!

8) The not-so-hidden and rather dangerous political and ""moral"" (or lack of...) messages included in the film, plot/storyline.

There is the association of patriotism and nationalism with madness and lunacy, unless it is of course in the name of democracy...

There is a term used in such situations and it's called... propaganda!

In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of biological weapons and the danger that they pose.

If a Patrick Swayze is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING series North and South, and the movies Next of Kin and Ghost.

In conclusion, the potential for a great movie was there.  A shame really...1.1 Stars",1132099200,6,2923,4.932377049180328
2385650,5,B000ADS6D0,"Based on Frederick Forsyth's novel ""Icon"", this Hallmark production has a large and excellent international cast, car chases, gun battles, and the latest in espionage gizmos. What is truly wonderful is the scenic, bustling, city of Moscow used as a backdrop for this story of terrorist activity in connection with political gain, in the midst of a presidential campaign. It is a city we rarely see in current films, and makes this above average TV miniseries a delight to watch.

The sometimes improbable plot is complex with many twists and turns, and concerns 2 candidates for the presidency, Igor Komarov (Patrick Bergin) and General Nikolayev (Joss Ackland), and the devious methods used by one of them to win. Sir Nigel Irvine of the British Embassy  (Michael York) gets ex-CIA man Jason Monk (Patrick Swayze in a marvelous performance) to uncover the truth, and he teams up with his old friend Viktor (Steven Spiers) and investigator Sonija (Annika Peterson). Others in the cast include Barry Morse as the current Russian president, Jeff Fahey as a political consultant, and Ben Cross as a thuggish ex-KGB man. Directed by Charles Martin Smith, with terrific cinematography by David Connell and an atmospheric score by Mark Kilian and Daniel Licht, this is a lavish production, and highly entertaining.

The DVD package contains the full 3 hour 2-part miniseries, and comes with 2 discs, 1 with a wide screen version, the other with full screen. Bonus features include ""The Making of 'Icon'"", which has a short interview with Swayze and otherwise just follows the cast and crew as they are filming, with no commentary. Those who enjoyed Cold War spy thrillers will like this ""modern day"" film about Russian politics and intrigue",1129248000,14,1734,5.055944055944056
2385661,1,B000ADS6D0,"I purchased this dvd for the bonus film ""THE HOLCROFT COVENANT "". I am a big fan of older Robert Ludlum thrillers. Sometimes they even translate into good films (the Bourne Series was very entertaining ) The plots are so intricate it can be difficult to create and sustain the suspense and twists. I would normally like to comment on this very thing. However , the film transfer from master or remastered was so poor it was not watchable. There is actually a Warning before the credits on the poor quality in spots of the remaster transfer. There seems to be a haze and  sputtering as the movie plays. I stopped watching after the first 10 minutes. So for this reason you should stay away from this print and find one that is watchable. Granted this a a very inexpensive  dvd (new) or I would have walked to post office and sent the dvd back for a refund. I would have expended more energy rewrapping this dvd and  walking to the p.o. then its cost value. Amazon does have a good a to z guarantee but this wasn't worth the phone call.
I am a big fan of Michael Caine films but even his star appeal could not help me bite the bullet and watch this version from ECHO BRIDGE HOME ENTERTAINMENT.Im sure they do other films and dual packaging nicely but not here.
THE DVD was paired with ""Icon"" a Frederick Forsyth thriller. I did not watch this as I was disappointed  with the second feature. I have no comment on quality of this printing version of Icon. STAY AWAY IF THE HOLCROFT COVENANT IS THE REASON FOR THE PURCHASE.",1428105600,,1518,4.391459074733096

As a Patrick Swayze fan, I was glad to find a Swayze that I had not seen before. Whatever the mini-series lacks is not on Swayze's part; Patrick delivers a solid performance. The conversion of the Forsyth novel is a little less than stellar--but, overall, I enjoyed the film a great deal. I definitely would recommend it to a friend!",1416614400,,389,4.557142857142857

2385666,5,B000ADS6D0,"I got this because of Patrick Swayze. I didn't know what to expect. I had never seen  any preview on this at all.  I never saw it either. So when I got it In the mail I thought okay lets watch.  Patrick worked at one time for the C.I.A.. So he know what to look for In cases and why they happened. The government went to him and asked him to come back and he would do all these things for him. Russia was having a problem that some of their high ups got murdered. So he had to go over there and find out way. He had been sent to Russia when he was with the C.I.A.. So he knew some of the agents still lived there. When he got there he hooked up with another old agent, that other agent told him the only thing that he would help him in, is he would set him with the things that he would need and other agents that could help him. All the agents that helped him got killed and the only person that ended up helping him was this officer that got fired from the K.G.B.. So between the two of them the found out that their was a plot and that plot. End the end the plot never happened. The only thing that I didn't like is that in middle of the dvd the movie stopped and stated to be continued. Then about three minutes later it started back up, so that showed me that this movie was probably made for tv. I liked this movie and it was very good.",1394841600,,1342,3.8905109489051095

2385669,1,B000ADS6D0,"From the very beginning one can see that it was a very cheap, low budget series or movie, whatever. There're some shots in Moscow but it was cheaper to film in Sofia, Bulgaria, and using Bulgarian actors in Russian roles. Easy, most of them already speak Russian. There's a bomb explosion, a deadly virus stolen and a police ... woman? There's only one important character in the book and that is a British embassy employee, Celia Stone. OK if you want to please the female audience, but you scare the male 'cause skeleton looking Annika Peterson moves around probably with batteries and suffers from bulimia and anorexia at the same time, besides being a pretty bad actress.
There's a so called Black Manifesto stolen in the book, no deadly virus. Who was the idiot who wrote the script? Yes, I know, I saw his name in the end credits, but why on Earth Forsyth accepted the destruction of his book? Yes, there are too many time jumps, but that's what makes it great and filled with suspense. Well, probably it was that old saying that ""everybody's got a price"".
So, our ""hero"" is living in Andalusia (wrong, it should be written correctly Andalucia, yes, with a C), by a ... lake? There are no lakes in Andalucia. In the book Jason Monk was stationed at one point in Madrid, Spain, but that is far away from Turks and Caicos in the West Indies. Besides, Michael York didn't manage to portray the old British chap and gentleman Sir Nigel Irvine is supposed to be in the book. The fact that he was born in England doesn't make him suitable for that role. Pity South African born Nigel Green died so many years ago.
No more comments 'cause at this point of the movie I stood up and jerked the DVD out of the player in order to put it in its rightful place ... the garbage.
Buy the book, read it and enjoy the real stuff. Even if the end feels a little bit like a trick pulled out of a hat, it gave me great pleasure and I felt satisfied with it. Kinda poetic justice.",1325635200,,1965,4.3863013698630136

2385697,3,B000ADS6D0,This probably isn't a bad movie. Full of physical action etc but I'm biased; I read the book. And the movie is nothing like it. I can understand that Frederick Forsyth's original story might have been too tough to transfer to the big screen but the movie lacks the Forsythian complexity and intrigue of the book.  Compared with the book the movie plot is insipid. I'm surprised that Forsyth had anything to do with it (he was a story consultant or somesuch).

It is a very good movie, but it is long so plan the time to watch it accordingly.  Swayze's charcter in this movie is similar to his character in his last work, ""The Beast"", which aired last season on A&E TV (exceptional work).

8078027,4,B000ADS6D0,"After playing a drag queen in ""To Wong Fu, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Wong-Foo-Thanks-for-Everything-Julie-Newmar/dp/B0000714BP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar</a>&nbsp;in 1995, Wesley Snipes stepped into the ultra-macho Blade Daywalker character. (Then he stepped in a pile of problems with the IRS. But that's a different horror story.) After ""To Wong Fu,"" John Leguizamo went right back to playing (or voicing) complex oddball characters in movies and on Broadway. Leguizamo's meat had always been those supporting parts.

But Patrick Swayze almost vanished for several years following his drag-queen turn. After so many sweet, sensitivebut essentially masculinestarring roles, the sweet sensitive Vida Boheme of ""To Wong Fu"" may have been just a bit too close to the edge. Oh, he got cameos and supporting roles. ""Donnie Darko""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Darko-DIRECTOR-S-CUT/dp/B003MXD6Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Darko DIRECTOR'S CUT</a>, for example, has a great Swayze moment or two. He appeared in a couple of films as a dance instructor. But Id heard Swayze really wanted to play bad guys, and those roles didn't seem to mesh with his Latin motion.

Then came ""Icon."" To start with, the icon of the film and that of the Frederick Forsyth book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ICON/dp/0552139912/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ICON</a>&nbsp;are totally different. The movie never really develops the icon idea, in fact. But Swayze gets to play Jason Monk, a somewhat-bad guy, a secret agent who abandoned his Russian wife and child in that country when he was made by really-bad guy Anotoly Grishin (Ben Cross of ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""Exorcist: The Beginning""). The novel thoroughly explores the troubled past and poor decisions of Monk; the movie reduces them to the single sin of abandonment. We also don't get to see the reasons behind the CIA double-cross that is central to the plot; it just happens.

The best bad guy in the film is a Russian Presidential candidate, vaguely post-Putin. Igor Komarov (excellently played by Patrick Bergin) runs a pharmaceutical firm, and has secret yearnings to commit genocide. Theyre not secret enough, though. When his company is burgled and a vial of a nasty super-Ebola bug is taken, the game is on. Swayze is unable to track down the thief before the virus is released, but with the help of his daughter and a comely Russian KGB agent (sorry, thats FBS now, I think), he manages to stop Komarov.

There are a couple of other wonderful casting choices. Jeff Fahey plays a slimy Russian campaign manager, using US-style spin-and-dodge to help his man Komarov win at any cost. And Joss Acklund, who usually plays a nasty fellow, or at least a genial boob, is the good-guy candidate General Nikolayev. Together with Swayze and Bergin, they keep the film from descending to a hopeless waste of air-time. Barely.

So my recommendation is, if youve read the book, don't expect the film to match it. If you're a Swayze fan, its definitely worth the time. If neither is true, skip the movie. Buy the book.
