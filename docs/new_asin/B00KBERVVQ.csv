8657336,4,B00KBERVVQ,"I bought the DVD and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Congratulations to all involved.
To be honest though, anyone expecting a film with the 'polish' of a Hollywood production will be disappointed, which is itself a refreshing change, and I don't believe any of the cast or crew need to clear room on their mantelpieces for a swathe of Oscars - at least not this year. Personally I'd like to see a longer version of the film (or a book of the story) as, to me, the 26 minutes or so just wasn't long enough for either sufficient character or story development. (Leaving the audience wanting more though is, I suppose, a good thing in the film industry). However I expect the duration was more a product of $$$ necessity than artistic or intellectual choice.
For nudists, it's also a good laugh, effective message and great to see the nudist character portrayed as the more 'normal' (in that regard) of the pair compared to the hungup textile one.
I look forward to seeing more work from the cast & crew, hopefully in the near future.",1408492800,,1029,4.5978260869565215
8657337,4,B00KBERVVQ,"Refreshingly original and not over-long. Yes, it's a short film, just under half an hour in duration, but it fills the time perfectly. A good story is unfolded, explored and neatly tied up without missing any loose ends. The fact that it's a film about nudism among today's 20-somethings just adds to the compelling nature.
Though archetypes, each character gets their moment and often it's the minor characters that linger in one's mind longest.
If you broke the film down, there is really only five minutes worth of nudity in it, if that. And it's all tastefully done, though totally unabashed. This provides an interesting viewing experience. You neither strain to catch glimpses nor do you have to avert your eyes to get a break.
There are genuinely funny moments, slapstick gags and surprise one-liners to augment the straight-forward story of a nudist and his conservative counterpart.
Thought there are reminders of this film's thread-bare budget throughout, it delivers a quality product that clearly too a lot of effort and skill. The acting is solid, the script is well-crafted and the overall film is definitely worth the look. Better, it's the sort of short film one can see over and over and always find new amusement in.",1404000000,,1234,4.966183574879227
8657338,4,B00KBERVVQ,I enjoyed it. It shows how different people react to naturism and how they can slowly come around given time and once they have experienced it.,1403913600,,143,4.538461538461538
8657339,4,B00KBERVVQ,"I enjoyed the film, despite the content & storyline (related to nudity). I felt it was compelling viewing, & rather tastefully done, given the content. It had a definite beginning, middle, & end, & provided not only food for thought, but also a few good laughs along the way. All in all, I liked it.",1402876800,2,299,4.454545454545454
8657340,4,B00KBERVVQ,"This film has everything a nudist film ought to have. As a narrative story (with plot and character development) it has the freedom to make the jokes and create the drama that a naturism documentary would be hard-pressed to achieve. There is plenty of flesh in it, so it delivers on the promise of full frontal male and female nudity. However, in a faithful depiction of the nudist lifestyle, they are in all shapes, sizes and sporting tattoos, piercings and body grooming.
Above all, despite the unabashed (though not-necessarily-gratuitous) nudity, the acting performances are solid and memorable. There some standout gags and one-liners, which puts ""Complex"" above other films of the genre. It is not a cheesy skin flick, but a clever and succinct short film with a clear and thought-provoking message.

There are a couple of moments that don't quite hit the mark. There are a few minor sync issues (but on repeat viewings, not all of them are recurring, so this might a DVD fault?). The soundtrack is catchy, if a little limited and they could have done so much more with the nightclub scene.

I would recommend it to anyone partaking in the naturist lifestyle, lovers of independent cinema and fans of films that are not afraid to break new ground or challenge convention.",1402444800,,1277,4.880184331797235
8657341,3,B00KBERVVQ,"In mainstream society naturist's largely find themselves in the minority, relegated to the fringes.
In Davo Hardy's short feature film 'Complex' we are given a humorous yet even handed perspective of the life of the average nudist.
Lachlan puts out an advertisement for a housemate and after navigating that minefield of psychopaths and generic weirdoes finally meets Travis, who appears to fit Lachlan's criteria. Things seem to be going well until it becomes confrontingly apparent to Travis the straight-laced IT professional that this new house he has moved into is in fact a nudist household. You can imagine the ramifications.
Without giving too much away the story depicts two people from vastly different backgrounds and frames of reference coming to accept each other.
In terms of production values the trained eye will automatically pick up on the fact that it is an independent film on a limited budget, however this is mitigated by the performances from the main cast which are of a very high quality.
(SPOILER ALERT) The once instance in the film that had me cackling insanely was when actress Georgina Neville's character threw the Director into the pool during the nudist BBQ sequence. For me that made this DVD worth every cent.",1401840000,,1244,5.073170731707317
