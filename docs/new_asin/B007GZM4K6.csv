This was the first James Bond film to become a smash hit in America. It had higher production values than Dr. No and more than enough action and adventure. A lot of exotic scenery to entertain as well. A formula for success. The plot is a staple of counter intelligence. Dangle a lure to attract an enemy agent. Capture him, then double or neutralize him. Alternately, pass on information that is mostly true but contains misleading information for a purpose. Does this sound like a plot for a novel?

The movie starts with James Bond being paged, then answering on a car phone. Commonplace now, but far out 40 years ago. JB checks out his hotel room, and finds it bugged. I wonder if this is still common in certain hotels today? The pot is stirred up to provoke a feud (like COINTELPRO?). The film tells how tribes (Gypsies and Bulgars) are used as substitute fighters; not too different from third world wars today. The action at the Gypsy camp is full of sound and fury, but is just a sideshow to pad out the film.

Another sideshow distracts people at the Embassy, and the coding machine is captured. They make a quick getaway to a train to skip the country. All seems to go well, but Tanya is seen boarding the train. Not seen boarding the train is Red Grant the professional killer (or Tom Nash, a pun in Russian). The stop in Zagreb shows the need to avoid tardiness! Or a recurring password. In the dining car Red Grant makes a faux pas that betrays his non U background. After getting the upper hand, Red Grant is betrayed by his greed, and James Bond wins again (its all in the script). The train, which carried them away, must now be abandoned for a new escape route. A Bell helicopter shows up to attack their Chevrolet truck (a technical flaw?). They reach the motor boat to make their escape across the sea. (This scene was popular enough to be repeated in another film.) A final attack occurs at the hotel, but Tanya saves Bond and the machine by shooting Rosa Khleb. Was James Bond ever saved this way in any other film?

Are the Bond films full of violence? Not really. Violence has always been a staple of gangster films. You should understand 007 as the top troubleshooter for a ruling gang (the Imperialists) who squashes upstarts and rivals. Originally the enemy was SMERSH, but changing politics meant a new enemy (SPECTRE) in this film.

Ian Fleming based his stories on his experiences as an agent for British Intelligence. He brought Dusko Popov to warn J Edgar Hoover of Pearl Harbor in July 1941. Robert Shaw may have been picked to play the part of Red Grant because of his resemblance to a real professional agent, as described in the book. Around June 1969 the newspapers printed the picture of a Lee Harvey Oswald who resembled the Red Grant character more than the alleged lone gunman of Dallas. Did Hollywood tell us more that we could understand at the time? The name Rosa Khleb seems like a pun on Bread and Roses.",1454112000,,2983,4.5269016697588125
