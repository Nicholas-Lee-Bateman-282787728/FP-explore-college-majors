There were a couple of warnings that quality was starting to slip in the second season.  The first was the identity of the main villain, the Roman Catholic Church.  To begin with this was better than most modern American television or movies in that they recognized a difference between the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches; however, despite the cleverness of the story, the portrayal rather quickly degenerated into young, busty, beautiful, skimpily attired nuns....  Not that I have anything particularly against that, but it certainly called the rest of their research not to mention their underlying motives into question....  Nevertheless, that along with the brilliant humor of the middle part of the series had me thinking this was another five star effort until I reached the last story arc,...

which made no sense at all.  (hint: when a story's VILLAINS publicly wonder what the Hell is going on, viewers are in trouble.)  Now, given the record of the original author, Kazuma Kamachi, I'm betting that the original story is told with a lot more depth and will make a lot more sense, but this is no way to end a TV series.

Note: As near as I can determine right now, the series should be watched in the following order:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-Season-1-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00OLII9RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Scientific Railgun: Season 1 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Magical-Index-Season-1-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00MP2G3C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Magical Index: Season 1 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-S-Season-2-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B01711CI7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Scientific Railgun S: Season 2 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>, this set, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Magical-Index-The-Movie-The-Miracle-of-Endymion-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00PBE2H6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Magical Index: The Movie - The Miracle of Endymion (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>.",1476403200,7,3288,8.288951841359774
