8291726,4,B001D5C1JE,"1944, Part 1.  Highlights of Vol. 17:

B-17s shot down by Me-109Gs and FW-190As and Me-110s or 210s.

U boat crew action off the African coast and the Indian Ocean:  Los!  Ab!  Exciting footage, but we saw this same ship sinking in Voume 16 previously.

Italy, Rome:  Allied prisoners, 4000, marching off in captivity in front of the Coliseum.  Rail gun at Nettuno area fires.  It looks like the Dora that is at Aberdeen proving ground.  One of the largest artillery pieces in history, or the largest.

Rommel inspects Western fortifications.  Heavy artillery in forts are ready to repel the attackers!

Eastern Front:  Tactical withdrawals.  Supplies delivered are ""the same as in the first year of the war.""

Wounded prisoners, including soldiers interned in Mexico, and civilian prisoner exchange for US troops at Saarbrcken.

Goliath mini-tank, remote controlled, destroys an enemy tank. A trainload of new Panther tanks travels to the Front.

Air raids on Berlin. Battle for Monte Cassino.

Bad translations here and there:  ""Oberstleutnant"" is lieutenant colonel, not ""captain lieutenant.""

Tiger Is in action.  Lots of them.  More air raids.  More B-17s shot down.

Field Marshall Rommel inspects Atlantic defenses.  Rundstedt inspects an SS unit.

Italian Front.  Fallschirmjger (paratrooper Green Devils) in action.

Major Rudel.  He personally destroyed more than 200 tanks.

Wounded PWs from USA arrive in the South of France.

6 June 1944:  Invasion.  Allied gliders destroyed and paratroopers captured.  Sherman tanks destroyed.  Big holes punched through their armor.  PzKw-IVs with sheet armor racing around in Normandy.  From this footage, you would think that the Allied Invasion failed.

Set the audio to German with English subtitles, then start from Main Menu.

8291727,5,B001D5C1JE,"If you are one to enjoy watching real history, without all the usual critiques on this and that, narrative, these are excellent films.  One ignores the sad, Nazi commentary and watches the action and the faces.  It gives you the flavor of what it must have really been like, to have been there.",1301875200,,294,4.528301886792453
