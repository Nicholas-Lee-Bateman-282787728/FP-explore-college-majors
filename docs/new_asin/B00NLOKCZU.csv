6667115,4,B00NLOKCZU,"Fun adventure story, with vibrant Technicolor photography, good music and romance, and rousing action scenes. I was glad to see this long-unavailable film being released on DVD for the first time. The image quality looks great and clearly a lot of care went in to this presentation.",1415145600,21,282,5.0212765957446805
6667116,3,B00NLOKCZU,"Saw this when I was in grammer school - music was pretty good and scenery was good too. Yes, it is worth seeing, but not as good as the latest version.",1414800000,,151,3.903225806451613
6667117,4,B00NLOKCZU,"I think because it was made in 1943 the original story was chabged somewhat to make it almost a musical Casablanca. This was a bit of a shock, but on second viewing it works quite well; obviously some of the original songs are missing to keep the length down",1478476800,,258,4.285714285714286
6667118,5,B00NLOKCZU,"this is not movie i thought it would be.  when i was young i saw one in which the riff leader was called 'THE RED SHADOW""  it must predate this one but as a movie made from the stage play this was an inte3resting version of the desert song.",1478304000,,240,3.877551020408163
6667119,5,B00NLOKCZU,Thought it was the best movie adaption of the Desert Song.,1471046400,,58,4.363636363636363
6667120,5,B00NLOKCZU,"I was asking t.cm back in 2014 ,and before, to get their bosses to work on the copyright problems of this film ,so they could show it. In2016 I discovered that this film was out on DVD for 3 years. It arrived on time .",1469750400,2,218,3.8666666666666667
6667121,4,B00NLOKCZU,Every musical Dennis Morgan did I have enjoyed.  I didn't particularly like his leading lady.,1464825600,2,93,5.2
6667122,4,B00NLOKCZU,Great music & songs.,1458777600,,20,4.25
6667123,5,B00NLOKCZU,"Who could hate this movie? I see the three words, ""I hate it."" and then I see the retort ""I love it.""  Ditto the ""I love it.""

It's rather like ""Casablanca"" meets ""Lawrence of Arabia"" meets ""Showboat"". I was completely entertained. I wish that more of the Romberg music were in it, particularly the incredible tenor-bass combination of ""When One Flower Grows Alone in Your Garden"". It plays as background music, but I sure did want to hear it and see it in this movie.

I loved the Moroccan musical interludes and for the first time recognized a lot of those Arab motifs in the beautiful Romberg tunes.

Dennis Morgan, I see now, has great charisma and a good tenor voice. I had never heard of the soprano, and she is just a bit weaker of voice than I would have liked. I remember Anna Moffo's recording for Readers' Digest production multi-album ""Treasury of Great Operettas"", to which few sopranos could compare favorably.

Nice movie and I repeat, what kind of person could possibly hate this film????? Donald Trump probably, but who else?",1457568000,3,1042,4.672131147540983
6667124,4,B00NLOKCZU,"I first saw this movie when it was released in 1949. Over the years, I saw other versions, but never forgot this one. Although the script for this version is weak, to me no voice or manner other than Dennis Morgan's suits the music or its major male role better. The combination of him and Irene Manning was worth the worth the wait to see it again.",1445644800,2,349,4.223880597014926
6667125,3,B00NLOKCZU,Not good,1442534400,,8,3.5

6667127,5,B00NLOKCZU,Great to hear Dennis Morgan sing the songs from Desert Song again.,1438300800,,66,4.583333333333333
6667128,5,B00NLOKCZU,Dennis Morgan is terrific.,1437609600,,26,5.75
6667129,1,B00NLOKCZU,I was very disappointed as ti did not follow the script and music of the original operetta.  The story line was completely changed and the words of the Riff Song were also changed!  The 1953 motion picture with Gordon MacRae was true to the original script and music and I find it much more enjoyable.,1436313600,2,301,4.454545454545454
6667130,5,B00NLOKCZU,I've been looking for this DVD ever since DVDs came out.  I loved this picture in 1944 and it's just as good today.,1435968000,2,115,4.0
6667131,5,B00NLOKCZU,"I have been wanting this version for many years, having been told for so long it was not available. I am now happily satisfied.",1435017600,,127,4.333333333333333
6667132,5,B00NLOKCZU,Better than the later version. A good updating of the story for its time. Item arrived exactly on true. Quality very good for its time.,1434412800,,135,4.44
6667133,5,B00NLOKCZU,"Have been looking for this version for my elderly bedridden mum who I care for, for over 10 years and am so pleased to say that Amazon have done a wonderful job recreating it to dvd. I'd say many peoples dreams are coming true just like they made my mums dream come true. Excellent job guys xxxxx",1432252800,6,296,4.2105263157894735
6667134,5,B00NLOKCZU,excellant -  wonderful music and romantic story the likes of which is not seen today - the  past great voice of  Dennis Morgan all makes great viewing and entertainment - the quality of the film itself  despite its age  is perfect with no freezing  -  Joan Thompson,1431734400,3,265,4.51063829787234
6667135,5,B00NLOKCZU,"Service was great. I've been looking for this rendition for years, every since I saw it as a young boy in the 1950'd",1430352000,,116,4.086956521739131
6667136,5,B00NLOKCZU,"great gift to my mother  she loves it. been trying to get this for a long time. good color  good sound
excellence music  DENNIS MORGAN AND IRENE MANNING SANG BEAUTIFULLY. wish we could know
more about the making of the film THANK YOU",1429920000,3,233,4.372093023255814
6667137,5,B00NLOKCZU,Great quality just as I remembered it seated in a theater in 1946.,1428537600,,66,4.153846153846154
6667138,5,B00NLOKCZU,Been looking forward to seeing this movie for many years.  Saw it last when I was about 4 or 5 and never forgot Dennis Morgan,1427587200,2,125,4.0
6667139,5,B00NLOKCZU,Very Nice. This was hard to find.,1427414400,,33,3.857142857142857
6667140,1,B00NLOKCZU,"disappointing, at best",1426204800,,22,6.666666666666667
6667141,5,B00NLOKCZU,I waited a long time for this DVD to be available. I was not disappointed.,1426204800,,74,4.0
6667142,5,B00NLOKCZU,I have waited many years to get this movie that I first saw at the Wiltern theater in L.A. back in 1943. Dennis Morgan was the ideal tenor for Romberg's music!,1425600000,3,159,4.161290322580645
6667143,5,B00NLOKCZU,Yay! My mom has been asking me to check on this movie for years to see if it was released. Finally! She remembers it when she was a girl and loved it back then. The story was so memorable to her she wanted to see it again. The movie color and sound of this old movie is great.,1425340800,2,276,3.7758620689655173
6667144,4,B00NLOKCZU,"Like many seniors, had not seen this since 1943. lived up to my expectations--good mix of music and action. Love Dennis Morgan's version of ""One Alone"". For a period piece this is great. Did not need the Spielberg treatment--computer enhancement or millions of dollars of special effects. The actors are real, look clean and bright, and obviously enjoyed their roles. Reflects a time when Hollywood was much more genuine--sorry Madonna and Rosie; not your cup of tea!",1424131200,7,467,5.077922077922078
6667145,1,B00NLOKCZU,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it again. The last time I saw it was back when I was in high school, and I liked hearing Dennis Morgan sing. However, I note that some songs from the original ""Desert Song"" were omitted.  This 1943 version was really somewhat of a propaganda version since we were still at war with the Nazis.",1422835200,,320,4.423728813559322
6667146,5,B00NLOKCZU,"I have been looking for this movie for years.  I loved it when I first saw it and am so glad that I now own it and can watch it more often.  It is a little dated, but Dennis Morgan's voice is fantastic and the songs never go out of style.  It is so wonderful to be able to hear the voices of those who are gone, but not forgotten.",1422489600,10,330,3.6857142857142855
6667147,5,B00NLOKCZU,"It's been unavailable for so long, and was a welcome Christmas gift for the folks.",1421020800,2,82,4.533333333333333
6667148,5,B00NLOKCZU,"This production of the Desert Song has so much more to offer. I had seen it in 1951. And have been waiting for it to come out on DVD. I think it the best version. A well directed and acted film, beautifully reproduced on DVD with astoundingly rich Technicolor.",1420588800,11,260,4.326530612244898
6667149,4,B00NLOKCZU,"first saw this movie when I was 5 my parents went to see it, after seeing remake in later years I wanted to see the 1943 version again. Was not disapointed.",1419206400,5,156,4.064516129032258
6667150,5,B00NLOKCZU,"I've been waiting for this to be released ever since tapes came on the market. Finally it is released on DVD and every bit as good as I remember from seeing it years ago. It's a shame we don't have singers like Dennis Morgan anymore. His voice is wonderful to hear. So if you want a movie without monsters, vampires, lots of bloodshed (though there is some in this), all the way out things now in movies, just a movie to make you feel good, this is it.",1418428800,15,452,4.1477272727272725
6667151,5,B00NLOKCZU,good price fast service,1417996800,,23,5.0
6667152,3,B00NLOKCZU,Music and action.  Who could ask for more?,1417046400,,42,4.25
6667153,3,B00NLOKCZU,It's OK.  But anyone ordering this version of The Desert Song should really keep in mind that it's not the original and that the plot is changed to reflect World War II and Nazi involvement in North Africa.  I was hoping it was more like productions of the original that I have seen live.,1416960000,,288,4.314814814814815
6667154,5,B00NLOKCZU,We were so exited they finally released this version on DVD.  They never did have on VHS.,1416700800,4,89,4.235294117647059
6667155,4,B00NLOKCZU,Was not my favorite movie with dennis morgan. i don't understand the refusal to release  it until now.,1416700800,,102,4.666666666666667
6667156,5,B00NLOKCZU,"I first saw this movie when I was about 7 years old and as I am now in my seventies,  it is a joy to be able to see it again.  With the 1953 version of The Desert Song, it is interesting to see the difference in the songs included, as what was in the 1943 version are not in the 1953 version in some cases.  No matter what version I see, I just love The Desert Song........thank you Sigmund Romberg.",1416096000,23,399,3.9012345679012346
8678955,5,B00NLOKCZU,Loved the wonderful music!! And any chance to look at Dennis Morgan isn't hard to take!!,1519171200,,88,4.5625
8678956,4,B00NLOKCZU,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

Great Movie !!",1505865600,,617,4.719626168224299

8678958,5,B00NLOKCZU,"Dennis Morgan, one of America's most beloved Irish tenors as...a Berber?  Sure, why not!  A fun, breezy and completely implausible desert romance.  My wife jokes that we watch Dennis Morgan films during the year because it is too early to watch ""Christmas In Connecticut"", and she may not be wrong.",1504569600,,298,4.92
