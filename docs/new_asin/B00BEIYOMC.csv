5591018,5,B00BEIYOMC,"So back in 2011 Insidious came out and it was made a low budget film. Nothing to Great, but once it hit theaters it shocked audiences. When I came in to watch it I was blown away with the music choices they had, it set up a great tone for the movie and I must say Insidious is one of the best horror films of 2011 and so on. Most horror films suck these days only a few stand out. Now we have Insidious 2 and when the trailer came out I got so excited I clicked on it and loved it. I can't wait to see it sept 14. I've seen positive reviews and I know it will be great. James Wan never disappoints. The plot to the second film is more of supernatural mystery film. I can't wait.",1379030400,3,678,3.85
5591019,5,B00BEIYOMC,"I used to hate horror movies because of how easily I get scared. I slowly worked up the courage to see a few modern scary flicks before checking out the original Insidious. It blew me away. I was in sheer terror the entire time, and yet there was a smile on my face because I was so impressed at how effective it was. When the second one was announced, I was a little surprised but pretty intrigued to see it. I knew it couldn't possibly be as good as the original, so I kept my expectations as low as possible so as not to be disappointed. And once again, I was blown away. While not as scary, the tension and suspense are back in full force in such a manner that only the great James Wan could create. What really stood out to me (aside from Patrick Wilson's excellent performance) was the story. It truly does what any great sequel is supposed to do: take elements from the original and blend them into new material to build off the storyline. So in short: not as scary or quite as effective as the original, but a very good story and thoroughly chilling overall. Highly recommended if you enjoyed the first Insidious as much as I did!",1379030400,40,1138,4.297674418604651
5591020,5,B00BEIYOMC,"Contrary to what others have said on this product, Insidious 2 is quite good, and is as good as the first if not better. Others have commented on the use of loud music, this is quite purposeful and is an excellent example of incidental music in the horror genre something so many horror films in the past ten to fifteen years have done poorly if at all.

Insidious and the Conjuring are not gory movies, they don't have scenes depicting some guy in a skin mask wielding a chainsaw or a guy in a striped sweater with knives on his hands. If this is your definition of a good horror film, these two are not for you. They deal with the paranormal in a way different from the likes of Paranormal Activity, Grave Encounters, and other films. They rely heavily on atmosphere and the use of sound to create a strong emotional response to go along, appropriately, with the images on screen. I have watched hundreds of horror films, they are my absolute favorite genre, and I've seen all the campy classics, all the slashers, all the torture, zombie, and mass murderer films out there. These two movies, along with the Conjuring(also by Wan) are some of my absolute favorites because of the overall excellent execution of classic horror style.

Everyone is different, and what scares people, or what entertains them is almost never the same. If you like Paranormal and Horror, give the James Wan films a shot, keep an open mind and let the atmosphere envelope you. If you go into it with the words of critics who may not watch horror films or of those who expect more action and gore you probably won't enjoy it.

Five out of Five stars, one of the best horror films of the year.",1379030400,32,1670,4.5049504950495045

5591164,2,B00BEIYOMC,"Oh, look, an abandoned hospital with all the patient records still intact. Yep, that pretty much sums up this awkward, cliche-ridden and embarrassingly scare-less sequel.

I enjoyed the 1st movie despite some plot holes and cliches that I could overlook. The story was interesting enough to keep you engaged and motivated to see it through. Elyse was fantastic, of course.

The sequel is just cliche-upon-cliche. Let's see if I can remember a few (I'm sure it's not exhaustive): toys lighting up and moving on their own, chandeliers, lights flickering, light bulbs exploding, music playing and stopping when someone approaches, evil sounds and voices on the baby monitor, a laundry room in the basement, doors slamming (oh boy, are there doors slamming), a cobweb-filled abandoned hospital with pristine patient records for exactly who they're looking for, intact.

This movie also performs the cardinal sin of horror in making the first installment less entertaining by trying to create a movie based on explaining what happened in the first (the very things that made the first movie a success), instead of developing the story.

Oh, did I mention the dynamic duo of Specks and Tucker? The wannabe X-files fanboys haven't changed a bit despite the loss of their beloved, recently murdered mentor, Elyse.

And, yes, there's lots more of the baby crying. And enough cheap jump scares to do nothing more than prompt you to turn down the volume.",1516665600,,1443,5.0974576271186445

5591282,3,B00BEIYOMC,"This a well-meaning and intense immediate-time sequel to the original tale of a possession/haunting. Most of the original characters return but the focus is no longer on the child per se. But, it seems like a half-hearted effort after the first 30 minutes. From that point on, the script seems flat and the delivery seems frustrating. The movie wraps up loose ends but there is a quick and predictable ending with another climax tacked on at the end. Of course, there is another haunting which sets up another sequel.",1509148800,,517,4.820224719101123

5591284,4,B00BEIYOMC,"This was a fun thriller.  Very few thriller/horror films are as good as the classics, but this one is pretty enjoyable and up there for a modern day scary flick.  I'd even go as far as saying that it's better than the first Insidious.  The first one is good, but the first half was super slow before anything really happens as it's spending time setting up the story and the characters.  Whereas this sequel immediately gets to it right away taking you on a wonder thrill ride until the end.  Patrick Wilson who plays the husband does a terrific job at playing a dual character in this.  Rose Byrne plays more of a basket case whose been dragged through the ringer.  They do a decent job at being convincing.  I love it when filmmakers of scary films actually cast accomplished actors.  Lots more jumps and scares in this one over the first, but you do kind of need to see the first one before this as it's a continuation.  There are quite a number of references to the first that will be confusing if you're only seeing this one.  Although there are some ridiculous silly moments or cliche dialogue in this here and there, but overall this is a good movie with good actors who know how to elevate the material.",1507507200,,1211,4.4343891402714934

5591338,1,B00BEIYOMC,"I try to  watch  movie  but  region  attention  this disc  has been coded for  region B only and  will  not play in the this  machine  please  eject  this  disc and play and  region B player. I was find out  it What Blu-ray and DVD Region Codes Are
Region Codes are pieces of data that are embedded into Blu-Ray and DVD Discs to act as a restriction. This data, or region code, is read by the player and if it doesnt recognize the region code as compatible or local, the disc will not play. Since region codes are specific to certain geographical locations, a disc can typically only be read and played by a Blu-Ray or DVD Player that was manufactured and/or intended for use in that same specific region.
In other words, if a disc is inserted into a player that originated from another region, it will not play because the region code does not match that of the player. Usually this doesnt pose a problem to the average user, but it may for someone who has purchased discs from a foreign website or while visiting another country. For example, if you live in the UK and purchased a few DVD discs while on vacation in the United States, those discs are not going to be playable in your DVD Player back in the UK  since the discs have been embedded with a region code for the US, they are only able to play on a North American DVD System. Its the same situation for nearly all areas of the world; playback depends on the region code which the disc was embedded with and the region where the player was manufactured.",1492560000,,1514,4.327402135231317

At times, the movie becomes a complex tale, but this is unraveled and made simplistic -- to placate the ""average"" viewer?  I do recommend watching this, as it is good.

5591600,4,B00BEIYOMC,"While not as flawless and masterful as The Conjuring films, the Insidious series still manages to be engaging and downright chilling at times. The second chapter starts moments after the first one left off, feeling like a genuine continuation of the story. While the first film was very in the same vein as Poltergeist, almost beat for beat, part 2 is more in-tune with The Shining, and is a great improvement over the first, i think. The plot itself, and the events that unfold, as well as all of the twists and turns are engaging and a bit less goofy this time around. I've always found that the first film fell apart tonally in the last act, but this movie maintains its creepiness throughout. My only real gripe that stops this from living up to The Conjuring films are the frequent jumpscares, and the characters, who feel less real and important. I haven't seen the third entry, but i've been impressed so far, so why stop here?",1476057600,3,934,4.598802395209581

5591877,5,B00BEIYOMC,I don't usually review movies...but after trying to catch this on tv and finally deciding to watch it here on amazon I thought it worth saying that this is REALLY good. I actually liked this movie better than the first one. Horror movies these days usually let me down but this one was great. There was some stuff to make you jump...but just overall I thought it was creepy and had a great plot (which is often lacking in these sorts of movies).

5592269,4,B00BEIYOMC,"As a fan of the Insidious franchise, I thought that Wan did a great job weaving the story in this. It follows directly in the heels of the first Insidious movie, and goes further by explaining some ""happenings"" that occurred in the first. As far as scares and thrills go, I can't vouch much for that since I haven't found any movie that scared me or thrilled me in a visceral way. That is not to say that there aren't thrills to be had, since that is something subjective and can only be answered by the viewer. What I can say is that is brilliantly directed and acted, and a lot of fun to watch. I ding it a star due to a lost opportunity with one of the characters; one whose story could have been explained more, since the way this character is in the movie makes it difficult for the viewer to connect with. Other than that, another stellar job by a stellar director.",1446768000,,871,4.253012048192771

5592550,4,B00BEIYOMC,"Insidious 2, as far as it goes, is more fun than scary. It's a good horror movie for the family to watch together, and you could let your grandmother watch it without giving her heart palpitations or nightmares.

There's nothing original here. You'll recognize everything from The Shining and Poltergeist to the less familiar Carnival of Souls and Sleepaway Camp. Wan and Whannell also rely far too much on sudden loud noises rather than genuine scares.

Patrick Wilson, however, does some very good acting. He handles his nice guy/bad guy part very convincingly. He also gets to keep his shirt on for the whole  movie, which might be a sign that he's evolving from Hunk Of The Month into a credible, bankable lead actor. Barbara Hershey is convincing as Wilson's mother, and Jocelin Donahue is just as effective as Hershey's younger self. Some viewers might remember Donahue as the ingenue in Ti West's In The House Of The Devil. Her presence adds a spookiness to this movie if you're familiar with her work in the other feature.

The Blu-Ray quality is good though not high. Images are sharp, colors are rich. The most effective feature is the Insidious logo itself. It comes on the screen in screaming blood red letters accompanied by a very frightening sound effect that resembles a scream but isn't.

James Wan and Leigh Whannell have always spent their careers following the money. Only a few years ago, the money was in torture porn. Hence Saw. Nowadays, the money is in understatement and family-safe movies. Hence Insidious 2. The highest compliment I can make is that I could easily watch this movie once or twice more whereas I don't care if I ever see any of the Saw movies again.",1442275200,,1692,4.761092150170649

5592806,3,B00BEIYOMC,"My only issue with Chapter 2 is the almost grandiose persona that seems to shadow the nature of this familys tale. At times the context and explanatory content seems a bit forced and over-exaggerated even for a fictional film setting. Even in fantasy and fiction the story needs to carry a bit of believability and realism. You need to think that this could actually happen to someone (given that you believe in hauntings and a supernatural presence in the world). Yet at times Insidious Chapter 2 comes off more like those stories that get bigger the longer they are shared among peers, like going to a haunted cemetery and a sound becomes a presence, becomes an attack and before long someone became possessed and so onThat is how much of Insidious Chapter 2 came off to me personally.

The effects and suspenseful thrills in the film are pretty effective. At times the shock value aspects worked perfectly with the sound effects to actually make me jump. There some definite creep elements to this film that manage to pull you into the terrifying even though Chapter 2 carries an obvious overproduced quality. Unfortunately there are times when you should fill spooked or the film tries for an intense chilling moment, it all just falls flat. Over all Insidious Chapter 2 works at carrying this nightmare to the next stage and works in creating a sort of mythos for this supernatural concept. It will scare enough for some fun moments, but it doesnt go far enough to allow for replays of the movie that are just as thrilling as watching it for the first time. So really Insidious Chapter 2 is one of those 50/50 films where it is cool if you like it and it is worth owning if ghost stories do it for you but if you choose to skip it then that is just fine too. I am definitely on the fence about this one. I will buy the DVD because I own the first film but not sure if it will be in rotation during my Halloween ghost story binge because it does walk the thin line between hokey and entertaining.",1432339200,,2000,4.509641873278237

As a paranormal enthusiast myself, I can see that being along the lines of plausible in theory... however, Insidious 2 took it a step from - ""hey, this could happen in the paranormal world"" to ""only in Hollywood"". That's not saying it was bad though. It was still a good movie with a strong performance by the returning cast... I just wish they kept the, ""Plausible in the paranormal world"" feel the first movie had. Other than that, creepy, and not filled with typical horror movie cliches. They didn't throw in shock value because the writing stood on it's own. Good movie for fans of paranormal/horror",1420416000,,640,4.723214285714286

Most of these movies have repetitive actors, which can sometimes take away from the movie, but what bothers me is that the directors takes some of the same scare tactics and regurgitates them onto his other film.

Sure, a few ""bads"" might be written off as ""negative attitudes,"" but how do you explain 50 warnings not to watch?

5593591,3,B00BEIYOMC,"""Insidious"" ended with a gloriously creepy cliffhanger -- Josh Lambert was possessed by an evil ghost who had been stalking him since childhood. And it murdered Elise.

And as the subtitle suggests, ""Insidious Chapter 2"" is less a sequel and more a continuation of the story that was left unfinished. The first movie was a bit like a modern version of ""Poltergeist,"" but this one is more of a supernatural version of ""Psycho"" -- and while chillingly spooky, it leaves a number of loose threads hanging that are never really addressed. Come on, where is Darth Maul demon?

Many years ago, Josh Lambert was haunted by a spirit, and Elise was called in to somehow deal with the situation. Now the police are investigating her murder, and Renai (Rose Byrne) is trying to get back into normal life now that her son has been returned to her. But weird things keep happening around her, including the piano and/or baby toys playing by themselves, and more weird visions of a creepy white-clad woman.

And Josh (Patrick Wilson) seems strangely unconcerned about what's going on -- possibly because he's not actually Josh. And, well, because he's hearing voices commanding him to kill the Lambert family in order to stay alive.

Meanwhile, Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) suspects that something supernatural is still up, so she accompanies Specs and Tucker (Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson) as they try to contact Elise. Thanks to a dice-using medium named Carl (Steve Coulter), they head to a hospital where Lorraine used to work -- and they soon discover that a bizarre ICU case many years ago may be connected to the current supernatural events. But to save Josh -- and stop a crazed serial killer ghost -- someone will have to venture into the Further again.

""Insidious Chapter 2"" is pretty appropriately named, as it forms a complete self-contained story with the first ""Insidious."" This time around, James Wan abandons the throw-in-everything-creepy-I-can-think-of approach in favor of a more focused plot about hidden dead bodies, a ghostly killer, and his creepy grinning psychotic mother who controls him even in death. Think an even more sexually-screwed-up version of ""Psycho,"" but with ghosts.

That, ironically, is the movie's biggest weak point. The movie is not a sequel, but a second part -- and yet there are big aspects of the first movie that go unaddressed. For instance, the Darth Maul demon is left completely unaddressed, even though Dalton ventures back into the grotesque shadow-world of the Further -- you would expect it to be waiting for him. It feels like James Wan selected certain supernatural bits of ""Insidious"" and sculpted a narrative around them.

However, Wan has lost none of his skill in creating creaking, eerie, pale-lit atmosphere, and slowly sinking his audience into a quagmire of nightmarishness. However, there's a bit more investigative mystery in this one, with Lorraine and Elise's sidekicks investigating the source of the current spookery -- murder, castration and a hidden room filled with corpses.

But a lot of the spookiness also relies on Patrick Wilson, who gives a very nice, subtle performance as Not-Josh for most of the movie -- there's nothing OBVIOUSLY wrong with him, but the chilly flatness when he speaks about anything serious is a dead giveaway. But he also depicts the crazy creepy killer during a bathroom scene where Not-Josh weeps and whines at his undead mommy as she commands him to kill the Lambert family.

Rose Byrne is basically doing the same thing as in ""Insidious"": wandering around witnessing spooky stuff, and gradually figuring out what's going on. So much of the plot relies on Hershey and Ty Simpkins, who provide solid performances as a strong-willed matriarch and a boy who discovers that he can use the powers that endangered him to help his father. And while Lin Shaye's character is dead, she's not gone -- and she's still a powerful, charismatic presence.

""Insidious: Chapter 2"" suffers from some dangling plot threads, but it is still creepy and bizarre, with an excellent performance by the underrated Patrick Wilson. If you've seen ""Insidious,"" see this to complete the story.",1401062400,,4161,5.034883720930233

I really enjoyed Insidious (the first one). I thought it was pretty creepy and clever and I just plain enjoyed it. So, when I saw that a second chapter was on its way, I was excited! I mean, I'd assumed, by the ending of the first, but, still...

The previews were certainly creepy enough. I was definitely looking forward to this...

Then I watched it. I can honestly give you my true thoughts on it in one simple word (or sound?). ""Bleh.""

I gave it two stars because I have seen so many absolutely horrific (not in a good way) horror films that I couldn't possibly compare this to those. So, it's not that bad... but, it's definitely not good.

It was predictable, boring, missing some extremely important components that existed in the first one... I don't want to spoil anything so I will just stop now.",1399248000,2,886,4.478260869565218

While this movie does continue from where the first movie ended (which is a nice turnabout compared to most sequels), it has issues.  First, you must have seen the first to even try to grasp what is going on in the second. Second, Patrick Wilson does as good as a job as possible with such a mediocre script and third, there are way too many plots to this movie, making it as convoluted as possible. Yes, the entity was after Patrick all along, after that I fail to understand what is going on between each and every character. Many have stated it ties the first story together and answers any lingering questions. I was willing to leave well enough alone after Chapter 1. The movies just goes the limit on how bad a sequel can be, but more importantly how moronic it can be as well.  I love horror (and not slasher type, either), but this is not a paranormal or thriller in any sense.

Haunted house movies have become so similar and generic in their content and style, that's it's getting harder and harder to tell a good one from a bad one these days. ""Insidious Chapter 2"" strikes me as a fairly good one - at least up to a point. It's not that there's anything particularly groundbreaking or new about it; it's just that the level of filmmaking is a notch or two above what one frequently finds in the genre.

Written by Leigh Wannell and directed by James Wan, ""Insidious Chapter 2"" follows the standard blueprint for films in this genre: a couple with young children finds itself bedeviled by restless spirits in an old Victorian house that, just from the looks of it, practically screams ""Haunted."" We're already familiar with most of the characters from the original ""Insidious,"" including Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson as the distraught parents and ""Entity"" star Barbara Hershey as the grandmother. There's the usual calling in of ghost-hunters and the standard mumbo-jumbo about ""the other side,"" but at least ""Insidious Chapter 2"" goes that extra step by actually entering into that alternate world and confronting the spirits residing therein.

""Insidious Chapter 2"" is a bit too derivative of ""The Shining"" in the dad's seeming descent into madness and possession and his posing a threat to the safety of his family (a baseball bat and a fire extinguisher have replaced the ax in the earlier picture as the weapon of choice here). And even though the movie wanders off into some pretty goofy territory in its second half, the excellent cinematography, imagery and sound effects manage to keep the fright meter in the red zone for most of the duration.

And credit those who made the film for having the good taste to include a brief clip of Herk Harvey's seminal 1962 classic ""Carnival of Souls,"" one of the creepiest horror films of all time, playing on a TV nearby. Now THERE was a groundbreaking film!",1397865600,,1939,4.848942598187311
5593740,1,B00BEIYOMC,"Words can not describe how terrible this sequel was. Without a doubt the worst sequel I've ever seen. I can't say anything good about this one. I would rather have a real ghost haunt me than ever see this again. I feel sorry for anyone that bought this or even saw it in theaters. I rented this for $5 and feel robbed. The movie is so boring. Barely any ghosts, bad acting, stupid plot. Pointless sequel if you ask me. The storyline went no where. I enjoyed the first one, but this was just terrible. It's like they didn't even try. This should have been straight to video. I've heard real ghosts in the past and that was more exciting than watching this. Just my opinion though. I'm just glad I didn't buy this.

Directed by James Wan. Written by James Wan and Leigh Whannell.

Returning: Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey, Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampson, Andrew Astor, J. LaRose.

 When first movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insidious/dp/B0055D3EFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insidious</a>&nbsp;(2010) ended with Josh (Patrick Wilson) bringing back his son, Dalton (Ty Simpkins), from the other side. Elise (Lin Shayne) sits in a living room chair to relax. With the digital camera, she takes a picture of Josh. He did not like the flash and becomes angry at Elise for taking the picture. He strangles Elise to death. Renai (Rose Byrne) enters the room and finds Elise dead. Josh has disappeared. She looks into the camera screen and is scared. Suddenly a voice from behind her says, ""turn around"". Josh touches her. She turns around and what she sees scares her.

This second movie begins with what happened in 1986. Elise (Lindsay Seim) arrives at the home of Lorraine Lambert (Jocelin Donahue) by the request of Carl (Hank Harris), a ghost hunter.  Elise and Carl have worked together before. Elise questions the young boy, Josh (Garrett Ryan). She needs to know who the ghost is. It is a she. While Josh is concentrating with his eyes closed, Elise carefully walks about the house. Josh tells her if she is hot or cold as Carl holds the baby monitor. She enters the children's bedroom. A light fades on by itself. Josh becomes a emotional and tells her ""hotter"". The closet door has opened.
  That is all I will tell you. You will have to see the movie to find out the rest.

Now the present story begins from the ending of the first movie. The Lamberts go to Lorraine's (Barbara Hershey) house while Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) are in Josh and Renai's house alone. The ghosts are still there and the ghosts are also in Lorraine's house.

Also in the cast: Steve Coulter, Danielle Bisutti, Tyler James Griffin.

There appears to still be some belief among the police that Josh killed Alice who died at the end of the last movie but not enough to stop them from moving back into the house where Josh grew up. There, amid many flashbacks, how the trouble really started is explained.  Of course eerie happenings are already manifesting themselves--piano music at midnight, the baby's musical walker playing by itself--and Renai wants to leave but Josh is adamant that if they just ignore everything going on, it'll stop.

As if.

If that were so, this'd be the shortest horror movie in captivity.

Although this was a well-done movie, camerawise, sometimes it was a little difficult to keep up with because of the scene-switching. In fact, in a couple of cases it looked as if some scenes were  out of order. They kept flipping from the Lambert homestead to a second house. I don't know if I took a seconds-long doze or what but I never really understood why anyone went to the other house in the first place.  There's a hunt for Alice but with all the flashbacks and scene changes and jaunts in the ""Other World"", I guess it was too much for this little brain to comprehend. However, I was determined to watch the entire movie in hopes ""All would be revealed.""

It was.

Finally.

Nevertheless, I was left with the feeling Insidious 3 is lurking in the shadows. There are a few jolts and some goosebumps along the way but quite a few questions left over at the end.

The film has some great writing and super smart storytelling going on. Like the first film, there are really two stories rolling along within the film. Both story lines and are fantastic and both had me laughing out loud and saying, ""Oh wow....nice!"" a few times.

My wife claims it's because there's not enough gore.  She may have a point (I am of the school that some well placed and not so well placed gore usually ups the ante in any movie), but I'm starting to think that Mr. Wan, who was (and hopefully still is) the new face of movie-horror, is fast turning into the new M. Night Shyamalan.  In other words, all this ""suspense"" build up with little pay off.  Sure there are some shock edits, but darn, this ""Insidious 2"" is just plainly not as scary (and surprising) as the first one.  I still think any self-respecting horror aficionado owes it to him or her self to check this out, but I suspect the James Wan formula is wearing a little thin.

  So I made it a point to get it on Blu-Ray when it came out.  The second one, as I said before, is just as good as the first one.  THey tied it in with the first movie very cleverly.  Hardly any gore.  And the story line was great.  Not as eerie as the first but still had some excellent scares.  And the set up for a 3rd movie (Which I am sure they are going to have), you know your going to get answers for a particular character(s) from  the first that you didn't see in this one.

As soon as I heard what they were calling this ""place"" I just felt the movie was a joke.  It was suggested by another with the promise that once I watched part 2 I would be scared a bit more, but definitely come away more satisfied than I was from part 1.  Well, I watched part 2 and was actually a little scared, though I still dislike the name they use for the ""place"".  I can honestly say that after watching Chapter 2 I decided to buy both parts.  Now I'm hoping and wishing that the studio decides to release both movies as one long movie which I would definitely buy.",1393459200,,678,4.224806201550388

I'm thinking that alot of people are taking this to be a horror movie...well I don't see how.
There is very little we haven't in the first one, or in a multitude of other movies.
To me at first I was disappointed as I sat there going ""Hey ya did this already in the first one!!"" but as the movie progressed I realized that the first and the second Insidious are simply two parts of one story.
As in that aspect (not the suspenful or scary aspect) is where to me this movie redeemed itself greatly.
More twist about the old lady and the overall story behind that almost gave this movie a cold case kinda feel as they need to discover it's origins in order to have any chance of fighting back.
I did not look at this as a horror movie...just a movie about supernatural battle between a family that is desparate to stay intact and old malicious spirits that want what they have.

If you approach the movie from that regard you may enjoy it ...because even at four stars I cannot say that this scared me in the slightest nor did it have too, to captivate my attention for an hour and a half or so.",1393372800,,1262,4.214876033057851

5594247,1,B00BEIYOMC,"Moving on from the the original movie ""insidious"", which was a bit below average but fairly decent that had an unusual but strange theme, which was what made it worth watching at times. Insidious 2 seems to pick up exactly where it left off in the original and somewhat becomes a caricature of it's first release, by being this obscenity of a huge joke. The things i really hated about this movie was the very lame and tiresome over used jump scares of the big or small empty rooms looking for ghosts or demons, it was very predictable and got old very fast. To be quite honest i don't know if the director was aiming to make a horror movie or a comedy because this movie came off as a joke and NOT a real horror that i could take seriously. When you make horror movies and add a lot of levity it becomes laughable and ruins the purity of horror movies, if this was meant to be a comedy horror then i guess i'll let this slide but personally i HATE comedy horrors for reasons previously stated. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a REAL serious horror movie, i seriously think it's about time for creativity to come back into the horror genre and bring some REAL scares like the way it was done when i was a kid.",1392854400,4,1225,4.2844827586206895

5594303,5,B00BEIYOMC,"I really enjoy the horror genre.  So many horror movies are awful, but when one hits, it is a great movie.  Insidious in in this category.

Another thing about horror.  Sequels are near impossible.  Insidious 2 does a wonderful job as a horror sequel.  Possibly the best done sequel of a horror movie I can recall.  It wasn't a great stand alone movie, and there were a few instances of poor/hasty writing that created unrealistic human reactions that broke the immersion factor, but the overall picture, the tie-ins with the original, the way the movie continues immediately after the original, the way they dealt with time.  I just thought it was well done.  Normally a horror sequel just tries to repeat the original and make it a little more over the top and scary, which doesnt work.  This movie is a different style of plot, which is unique as it is on the same timeline and deals with the same plot.

To me, this originality and writing, and how neatly everything comes together deserves my 5 star respect.",1392595200,,1013,4.634831460674158

There was a lot of suspense and not a lot of gore - which apparently Hollywood  feels that ""horror"" movies need.
I disagree!
It wasn't until this movie was over that I realized Id had my fists AND my teeth clenched!!
True suspense is what makes a good Thriller not all the blood and guts!

5594307,2,B00BEIYOMC,"Maybe the fault was in that it was a continuation of the first...although that was a necessary step in the plot unless they wanted to make a vague reference to the family's death and the start of a new saga. However, it was just poorly executed. Too many of the old methods were utilized. The dynamic of the family had changed; it was a mistake to make the wife (agreeably the most disliked character from the first film) as protagonist. Too much time was spent exploring The Further (also a weak point in the first one...myself and my friends who watched this film all agree that the parts pre-Further were the scariest).

This movie was creepy, I actually thought the first one was creepier but I think that is because the storyline was new and there was 100% shock factor there. A sequel almost always feels a bit more familiar than the original movie did and for horror movies that just shaves some of the edge off of the creep factor but I still had to give t his movie 5 stars because what it does is done so well, and it is a good continuation of a good story began in the first movie. Oh yeah and if you haven't figured it out yet I highly recommend that you watch the first Insidious before you watch this movie, it just brings everything into context.",1392249600,,660,4.124031007751938

5594345,3,B00BEIYOMC,"On some levels, this film is a pretty decent sequel of Insidious in that it begins basically where the first one left off and much of the plot is derived directly from the first film. Also, in many respects, the actors do a solid job in the film and there is a sense of foreboding and mystery surrounding certain plot elements. However, as it is with sequels, this one is not quite as good as the original film and fails to be as engaging. I think that the first one, while not totally an original concept, kept us quite in the dark as to the many spooks, scares and twists.

Insidious 2 does have some moments of intense mood and atmosphere. In fact, this is one of James Wans biggest strengths as a director, he shows rather than tells, and never uses gore as a substitute for true horror. Horror directors could take a clue from him: he, for the  most part, tries to steer away from horror film ploys, and basic lame scary clichs. However, there are moments where this rule is broken and we can see the scare a mile away (the door slowly creaking and opening as the strange mist and smoke emits from underneath.). There are moments of implied gore, which happens off screen.

Probably the biggest problem with this chapter of Insidious is that the plot gets way, way too silly and convoluted, to the point where we basically know they are setting up the third installment of the film. Its not bad as long as the film doesnt waver off into the usual sequel awfulness, but lets hope it doesnt. Still, Insidious 2 isn't a bad horror film per se. It definitely has suspenseful moments, and some genuinely creepy moments, and doesnt take the nosedive that many sequels take from original to second film.",1392076800,,1701,4.480645161290322

What appreciate about this film is that while it reference the original film we are not offered a rehash of the first film as horror films often do. If you prefer your scary film sequels to be the same film with a new batch of victims you will be disappointed.

 In defense of the critics who say this movie is not scary I would say that they are correct if they are looking for the jump out of your scares often invoked by a loud noise or a bit of on screen action that happens to startle like a dog jumping out during a quiet scene. This film has its scary moments much like Kubrick's the shining- they are quiet, suspenseful and full of dread.

What truly shines for this film is how the story is integrated into the first film. As the film explored the characters past and and work towards resolving the issues the writers brilliantly fuse the two films together.

However, the movie is not on my top ten horror film list. It has earned four stars because the film brings your sense of reality and confidence in the paranormal in to question. It's not a ""shock horror"" film, which is great. But it doesn't measure up to classic horror films because most people will not walk away thinking: ""that can happen to me"".

5594501,4,B00BEIYOMC,Good.. not great. The first Insidious scared the bajeebers out of me and was a movie that I continued to think about and could still creep me out long after I had watched it. So I had pretty high expectations for Chapter 2. It picked up right where the first one left off but this one just never got to the crazy creepy level that the other one did. Chapter 2 also introduced two bumbling idiots ghost hunters that added some comedy to the movie. I don't know why scary movies do this and I suppose there are people that like it but to me this just cheapens the movie. Overall this was a good scary movie but it just doesn't compare to the first one. There is one crazy twist but it becomes apparent almost right away in the movie.

5594676,4,B00BEIYOMC,"I enjoyed the first film and the second is a decent sequel, it's far from the best horror film out there, but it is an entertaining watch. The story continues from the first film, but the family have moved into a new house, unfortunately strange occurrences and visitations continue to haunt them. Even more troubling is the fact that the father may not have returned from the other world, but something more sinister has taken his place.

As I said I enjoyed this sequel, it continues the story in an interesting and entertaining fashion. The production values are high and everyone does a good job with their roles.

The main flaw with the film is that it takes the ghost train approach of using sudden movements and loud noises to scare the audience. While it does this reasonably effectively I personally prefer a more considered approach of creepiness and tension.  The shame here is that the film does go someway to building a sinister atmosphere, but then shatters it with a sudden bump.

Still the film is what it is and that is a well made shock horror that is a fun watch, although if you didn't enjoy the first film then you're unlikely to enjoy this one.",1390608000,,1166,4.591346153846154

I'm still not sure I understand what happened.  Sort of a ""Freddie's Nightmare"" sensation where so much of the movie, especially near the end, is a disjointed dream where all the parts don't fit together.  you don't really know the intentions of the apparition.  Why is it manifesting through these young people.  And what are it's intentions besides to scare the bejesus out of everyone in the house.  I like to understand the story AND be spooked.

The plot goes in so Many directions and is confusing at best. The actors are either excruciatingly earnest or ham it up (particularly the bumbling paranormal investigators).

5594712,4,B00BEIYOMC,"Some said there were too many scenes from the first movie. Not true. Others said it was too confusing to follow. Not true. Many have stated it's just not as scary. WHAT?

The first movie took a bit to get started. Not 2. It picks up where the first left off and leaves you riveted till the end. You are treated to many more nightmarish glimpses -- and extended shots --- of the bride in black (played by Fitzgerald) and the sinister wide-eyed woman (who apparently shoots her whole family in the first one -- a plot point not explored in this interesting mix of sequel and prequel, so possibly explained in Chapter 3).

I don't know if you'll like 2 as much as the first one. And I seem to be very alone in thinking it's actually creepier than the original. I guarantee you, however, watching Chapter 2 will not leave you wishing you could recapture the last hour and forty-five minutes of your life. It is far from dull. I outgrew the horror genre three decades ago, but my students, James Wan and Leigh Whannell brought me back.

Not-PC (and SPOILER) ALERT: Points deducted for the ""funny"" stance on homophobia (a couple scenes in which Tucker suspects his friend and partner-in-ghostbusting Specs may be gay) and the portrayal of a boy forced to be a girl by his psychopathic mother. It reminded me of the confusion caused by the character Buffalo Bill in _Silence of the Lambs_; he is not, if you listen carefully to the dialogue, a transgender person. He just thinks he is. Nonetheless, the less-thinking in the audience will have their stereotypes of transgender people ""confirmed"" by some of the scenes. Similarly, the character of Parker in Insidious 2 is not trans gender by any stretch of the imagination, but the images of man dressing as a woman (a la Norman Bates' mother in Psycho) are going to disturb some for the wrong reasons.",1390089600,,1844,4.598784194528875

The movie starts off with Josh and his family moving into his mom's house to leave the events of the first movie behind them and start fresh.  But SURPRISE paranormal activity begins to happen again.  I really liked how this movie clears up some things from the first movie that were left unanswered.  It also manages to link together with the first movie as well and expands on the Further and who was that old lady ghost at the end of the first movie.

SPOILER: We also get the return of Elise, which was one of my favorite characters from the first movie.

Some negatives:
There's a scene here where Josh's mom and the ghost hunters from the first movie walk around an abandoned hospital and it feels long and kind of drags out.  Another thing to point out is that this movie does repeat things we already saw in the first film. Like instead of Josh saving Dalton, Dalton now needs to save Josh, but I'm just nitpicking.

5594738,3,B00BEIYOMC,"The story of Insidious: Chapter 2 starts immediately after the ending of the original. (The sequel has no recap of the story up to this point.) We meet a married couple Josh and Renai Lambert and their children again, who have moved into Joshs mother Lorraine's house after the event that happened at the end of the original, but there strange events continue to take place.

In the meanwhile Chapter 2 introduces another story about young Josh and what happened to him back in 1986. With two plotlines converging towards the climax, Insidious: Chapter 2 explains backgrounds of characters including Josh Lambert and one Parker Crane.

Thus the sequel slowly explains these mysteries surrounding Josh and Parker (and one creepy lady) to us while attempting to scare us here and there. Director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell have managed to pull off this difficult task pretty well, but still the film gets confusing at times. For all the more complicated narrative, the sequel does not have much to offer, replying too much on dialogue and familiar jump scares.

5594742,3,B00BEIYOMC,"I will say that I liked this Insidious better than the first one. The first one I found to be very hokey and disappointing. Why would I watch this one? I was bored and I figured I'd watch it just to watch it. I am running out of inexpensive flicks to watch. I think this was worth my few dollars to rent. TLDR for below: I didn't hate it. I would say watch it if you're running out of other scare films to watch.

What I didn't like:
*Over-used scare tactics - how many times do I have to see a scare film with people terrified of flickering lights, clothes in a closet or a toy rolling around on the floor? These things occur in my house often. I am pretty darned sure my house is not haunted.
*The story was still ""hole-ridden"" in that there were things that didn't make sense. I know it's fiction, but fiction can still have its own physics and rules with far fewer swiss cheese story. I'll leave out specifics for less spoilers.
*I would have liked more back-story on the main antagonist. There seems to be more than one, but I'm not sure. The ending clearly indicates another movie, but this one didn't do a lot of explaining of the current antagonist. Nor why the previous antagonist was involved. Part of the hole-ridden story I guess.

What I did like:
*I did think the story and acting improved from the first movie. I like Rose Byrne in these movies. She makes it feel less cheesy. I empathize easily with her and feel most of her actions make sense. Both kudos to her acting and maybe a bit of the story for her character.
*It was interesting to have the movie start almost immediately where it ended from the previous movie. I'm not a huge move-watcher, so maybe this is done a lot, but it isn't something I have come across in the thriller/scare films I watch.
*I actually liked the ending. The first film kind of ticked me off with the ending. The whole last 20 minutes or so seemed out of place. This one felt a little better. At least it wasn't worse than the first. Some people compared this to The Conjuring saying that The Conjuring was as bad or worse. I actually think The Conjuring was better.

I feel sorry for the actors having to say those lines seriously along with acting eye-rolling plot 'twists'... they did the best they could... it's not their fault. However, I did enjoy seeing Barbara Hershey back on the big screen. She's a fine actress, but nothing she could do could save this screenplay.

5594888,4,B00BEIYOMC,"I thought it was a pretty good movie. They tied it into the first film in pretty creative ways... it was pretty creepy at times too. I really can't complain about anything other than the flashback when they dubbed Lin Shaye (Elise)'s voice over the actress playing young Lin Shaye. You see a young 25-30 year old woman but hear the voice of woman who is 70... doesn't sound very natural (or believable) plus her lips don't completely match up the entire time. Also, I'm not sure if it was fake or not, but the guy playing young Steve Coulter(Carl) had an extremely fake-looking beard. Like... so fake that it looks like part of a cheesy Halloween costume.

I had 100% expected to find out that this was a ""movie within a movie"" type of thing. Like in the ""Scream"" sequels when they where filming the movie ""Stab"", based on the character's story from ""Scream."" When I slowly started to realize that this was NOT the case and the director had expected us to overlook how terrible of a job they did on this portion of the film... I was pretty disappointed... I started to think ""Holy crap... they really dropped the ball here..."" and they DID really drop the ball... but the rest of the film was good enough for me to still admit that I really did like it, and I'll give it 4 stars.

It's worth watching so long as you can ignore the crappy voice overs.",1389571200,,1350,4.396
5594889,4,B00BEIYOMC,"It's always a risk to watch a second movie! I am impressed that this one was so well done.

I have been disappointed with other sequels and was a bit hesitant to rent this, but am happy to report it was well done!

The crew did a great job of offering a better explanation of the first movies events, without spoon feeding the plot to you.

 It seems to be difficult for series of this sort to continue without either offering up a really off the wall, ""what the heck"", explanation, or spending an awful lot of time with over explaining. I will give credit where its due! This movie felt more like a fresh exploration of events that tied in with the first movie, even though it is basically happening right after the first one.

The spirits are still creepy!  The characters are convincingly terrified!

 I am impressed that the assistants from the first movie are so well done and though there is not much background on them given, I really feel they are great characters! I am really getting attached to them, and look forward to more of their exploits and investigations. I hope the lead in to the next movie, starring them, is as good as the little preview at the end implies! Looking forward to it!",1389571200,,1203,4.4363636363636365

I personally preferred Insidious 2 though, as I appreciated the rich character development and the concept of the Further. There are clear references to The Shining and Psycho but this movie leaves its own mark of disturbing. Of course it's always great to add some light humor in between to dilute the scares (as they REALLY packed a punch in this second installment). So if you're kind of doubting the movie based on its bad rep, don't listen to the negative comments/reviews as this is easily one of the best movies this year.

5595044,2,B00BEIYOMC,"He is literally one of the absolute worst things to happen to horror. Insidious 1 has decent jumps, surrounded by zero cohesive story or meaning. The story was confusing and jumbled, and took an absolutely awful turn 20 minutes before it's end. The Conjuring was even less effective. The scares provided are manufactured and set up in such an obvious way. It goes in with the idea that the movie should be about scares, rather than letting the scares come out of the story. You build an effective horror movie around a well written horror story and script, not a few good ideas for jumps, which is the direction James Wan seems to like to take. I could not pay attention to this movie at all. Dull, dull, dull. The story was essentially non existent, non explained, and didn't get me invested at all. It was another case of writing around scares rather than scaring around writing. Not to mention this one was 100% an attempt to grab more money from the masses due to the popularity of the first. Creepy moments exist, yes. But they don't make up for an awful movie. I hate the direction American horror is taking. Cheap thrills and obvious scares. The tactics have devolved so much. We need a new horror director who knows what they're doing.",1389312000,,1243,4.57847533632287

Saw them both in theaters and crowd was really into it, really fun scary stuff for people to jump out of their seats. I relate this type of movie with the Universal Studios HHN events, and I guess I kinda expect it to be maze like, which it most certainly is. That gives it that something extra for me. As for The Lone Ranger, I bought that one also. Who cares what anyone says, it was fun.",1389312000,,491,3.92

I ended up renting it a year later and I loved it...go figure.
Based on the reviews for part 2 I was expecting the worst.
I actually came away pleasantly surprised.
Here's why...
The same family returns from the first film.
Same actors also.
Excellent acting, score etc...
Now granted the scares aren't nearly as abundant as the first film.
Really, by the middle of the second act I almost turned the movie off.
I'm glad I didn't.
The third act is what really saves the film.
Everything is tied together brilliantly from the first film.
Like I said, not very scary.
But we're treated to an expertly crafted story that twists, turns and weaves its way around the dark corners of the mind.
It's not perfect, it's not as good as the first but it excels in the story dept. which so few horror films do.
Give it a shot if you liked the first one.",1389225600,3,913,4.376470588235295

In fact I was so surprised that I almost felt I should have paid more attention to the film and given it a fair chance-
but I simply couldn't- I found it that boring.
""Insidious"" , the first movie, I liked very much. It was genuinely scary, creepy, creative and well acted by the entire cast.
Perhaps- ironically- therein lies the problem.
This sequel is nothing more than a rehash of the previous film with less provocation
for the ""scary"" or suspenseful scenes. The sequence of ghostly  apparitions and
""horrified"" looks on the actors faces are gratuitous and disjointed as far as the
plot goes.
The film was weak and pretentious, capitalizing- and overdoing-the same type of
eerie scenes as the first film. Being pretentious, the directors felt all they needed to do was simply retell the same story since it was successful the first time around,
even incorporating, verbatim, the same sentences (uh... ""I don't think that so and so is the problem here""... and ""it's not the house that's haunted... its so and so) as the previous film without a solid provocation for these stilted, reused phrases.
In other words, one is left with the feeling of

""Yeah, we got it.
We know it's not the house that's haunted
We saw it already"".

Disappointing.

What's worse is that a sequel this poorly executed can sometimes, as a byproduct of ones disdain for the film, cast a negative view on the integrity of the actors who chose to engage in such a bad representation of what was, previously, a good film.

So in conclusion, if you are curious enough to see it as I was then go for it.
But if you are truly a discerning fan of horror movies as I consider myself to be
I would not advise that you spend your money on this film.
I feel it was that bad.
I rented it through pay per view and, halfway through the silly and
predicable plot, I left to log onto the computer and simply listened to the rest of the
dialogue in the back round.
All sequels ,like Anne Rice's "" The Vampire Lestat"", should be able to stand
completely alone on their own merit in order to be successful.
This sequel fails miserably in that respect and, again, was so bad that it even
infected the way I feel about the first movie.

5595316,5,B00BEIYOMC,"Insidious: Chapter 2 more than delivers on the promise of the first film; it doubles up on this strange, terrifying astral dreamscape that perhaps only Carl Jung could have conceived, and even then only in a fearful mood and having ingested a psychedelic.

Sort of picking up where it left off--Wan is too singular in his style to go for the trappings of beginning, right away, where he ended--we see that Patrick Wilson's character is still very sketchy indeed, as we had presumed, and Dalton is not anywhere near a cure.  The green and red hues, the lighting, the Carnival of Souls-esque (probably a tribute by Wan) psychic trips and scares are as blood curdling as anything in the original, and the way Elise's character does what she does redeems her most compromised position in the first one.  There's Argento here, Tobe Hooper, all the greats of horror, and Wan wraps them into a hybrid completely of his own making.

The movie picks up pretty much after the events of the first film. And the Lambert family now have their son back and are trying to get back to normal family life. But as the movie goes on they can tell that something is off about Mr. Lambert played by Patrick Wilson. He just is not the same after saving his son from the other side following the events of the first film. Loved how they tied everything together in the sequel and I would definitely watch this again.

Patrick Wilson is excellent in this one! The theme of this film feels darker than the first. The whole hospital scene was creepy and very effective. The sets, sound effects, and costumes are great!

I don't want to spoil anything by describing detailed scenes or moments, but there was about 10-15 min. of action to which I could only react with stunned, and increasing, incredulity.  Whereas the first movie I loved until the last 10 minutes or so, which I thought was way too abrupt and not handled very well.  Chapter 2 takes a while to get going, but once you finally get introduced to most of the pieces of the plot, it rolls along nicely, and continues weaving together some of the themes (i.e. the spiritual ""never never"", and the beings trapped within it) introduced in the first movie without belaboring them. There are several gaffes further on, of course, where you will probably find yourself looking around and going ""What? No...really?!? Come ON!"", which again, tried my patience.
En sum, a sequel worth sitting through, and if you can make it through the first 30 min. then the rest of the movie is your reward.  Not great, and not as good as the original, but good enough to scratch that horror-flick itch.",1388793600,,1092,4.731578947368421

5595533,2,B00BEIYOMC,"Insidious and The Conjuring are in my assessment two of the best horror films to come along in quite some time,.In fact The Conjuring might very well be one of the 10 best horror films ever made. It had me feeling convinced that James Wan may very well be the new master of horror, it's that good in my opinion. 'Saw' was not everyone's cup of tea, but for a directorial debut it was a very impressive first outing. Insidious is generally considered to be a very good if not -superb horror movie. The vast majority of viewers considered it one of the better horror movies they had seen in awhile, I know I did. It had plenty of good freights, lots of truly horrific moments, plenty of creepy chills, and everything we always hope for but never quite get in most horror movies that have come along this past 20 years.

I'm convinced The Conjuring is perhaps the third best Horror movie since the Exorcist and perhaps the Shining. I can't think of one better except those. If someone can think of one let me know. But what happened here with Insidious II? It felt totally derivative and predictable of a lot of poorly written and poorly executed horror film sequels. Since Wan is in charge you should expect more mastery, craftsmanship, originality and a carefully constructed script and execution. Instead what I see here is a cheap shot script that simply doesn't have the unique and intelligent qualities that chapter one did- Saw or The Conjuring. It instead  seems to swerve into lazy scripted ideas and less than magical movie making this time. It's not as if Insidious Ch. 1 doesn't have a few little weaknesses, it does, but they are hard to notice. This reminds me of too many first efforts that had mediocre part II's. A good example is actually The Exorcist, Exorcist II, which was a disaster, and Exorcist III, which was not as bad as II but nowhere near as good as I. In my opinion Wan's Insidious ch. II is in about the same territory as Blatty's Exorcist III. Pretty good, but basically an average horror movie. Insidious was a way above average horror film, and Conjuring is I think as close to a horror masterpiece as I have ever seen. So with that kind of opinion about Wan's most recent films, you'd have to wonder why I was not all that impressed with Insidious II. Speaking simply, it's just an average horror film that is fine on it's own merits but simply does not live up at all to the original. Not an epic fail at all, but an epic fail for a master film maker like James Wan.",1388793600,8,2499,4.466083150984683

5595642,3,B00BEIYOMC,"I wish, I wish, I wish that Wan had the foresight and sensititvity to go deeper into the Parker Crane character; it would have made this a much richer movie.  The character of Parker is deeply pathetic and I was feeling sorry for his predicament and for his short time of happiness with his new family.  It was inevitable that his mother would destroy any sense of comfort or joy for him, but did Wan have to portray him so unsympathetically?  He might as well as had him storm through the cellar door shrieking, ""Heeere's Johnnie!""  I understand what kind of movies Wan makes and they are never about just one character, they are about the movie as a whole, the characters are always 2 dimensional and secondary to the thrills and shocks that are the main event of his films.  Perhaps witih a different director and maybe with a better script, a better movie could have been made about the character of Parker, about his child abuse, life after death and his second chance to get it right.  I liked Patrick Wilson's depiction of Parker as really trying, playing games with the children, albeit awkwardly, but trying all the same.  It's a shame his portrayal had to be reduced to just another maniac busting down doors and terrorizing women and children, like we have seen a thousand times already.  It could have been a much better movie and Wilson could have really pulled it off.  As I said, it's a shame.",1388620800,4,1408,4.555555555555555

5595732,2,B00BEIYOMC,"This film is a perfect example of trying to mine for oil more than once and coming up with crud rather than crude.  Insidious Chapter 2's biggest failing in not being un-scary, it is being boring,  I could not wait for this film to end.  The original recipe Insidious had me jumping and on the edge of my seat.  Chapter 2 had me struggling to remain awake.  Sadly, Chapter 2 also fiddles with the boy who floats to another realm concept that was the heart of the first film.  This tinkering undermines the film as a whole and results in some convoluted story telling in an attempt to explain things away.

So disappointed because I was really looking forward to this film when I heard it was going to be made.  I will credit the actors because i think they did a really good job and in the hands of lesser talent, it would have been a complete disaster.",1388534400,,853,4.320754716981132

5595737,3,B00BEIYOMC,"This film would have truly ranked two and a half stars, but there were a few things that warranted the stronger margin. To be fair I start with the pros, but there are few.
What ""Insidious 2"" does very well is maintain its pace. There is never a dull moment and there are many ""great"" films that can't claim that. It will hold your attention. There are a few genuinely creepy moments (which will be picked at in a moment), but the legitimate scares become corrupted very quickly.
The main problem with this film seems to come from over-eagerness. The frantic pacing which holds your attention also manages to confuse and promote irritation. An example would be (spoiler free), they are seeking a female ghost and go to a hospital. There they have a vision of a male ghost and start to follow his history. There is absolutely no explanation of why they think one is connected to the other - if at all.
The largest disappointment comes from the ""cheap tricks"". Every single ""scarey moment"" is punctuated by an incredibly loud blast of discordant music. That is what causes you to jump. I do not exaggerate when I say incredibly loud. I turned down the volume because of it but was no longer able to understand the dialogue. I had to chose between hearing what was going on or the headache that was being induced.
The timing was also off in many ways. There are two ""ghost hunters"" (though you don't realize that's who they are until quite a ways in) who are really supposed to be comic relief (one of them being the film's author). The gags would have worked, and worked well - if but for two things. First, each of the gags has been done to death in many other films. The other is the incredibly poor either editing or directing in the execution. A lot of humor is tied to timing and this one thing that was sorely missing. Those few necessary beats that turn a punch line from a laugh to ""huh?"" are never there.
Overall this film is a waste of money for purchase and I regret the momentary lapse of reason which prompted the sale. I was still riding high from ""The Conjuring"". If there was a bright side to dropping the cash it is this, I have once again learned the lesson of renting before purchasing.",1388534400,2,2203,4.441975308641975

There were still a few jump out and scare you moments, but mostly my brain was trying to figure out why I was seeing a particular scene at a particular time.

Just remember that you're not rating Amazon's video player, you're rating the movie.

Insidious Chapter 2 is fantastic! Not as terrifying as the first (I mean hey, it's a sequel), but it does much to explain things from the first movie. Things such as why the ghost following the father around is some ancient-looking woman (in the first movie you think to yourself, ""Wow, that crazy hag must've been an evil ghost for centuries,"" but you learn the truth in this movie), as well as what happened to the family after the first movie's chilling final scene.

Definitely worth a rent! But maybe if you want to ""own"" it, you should get a hard copy (DVD/blu ray). You don't want to dish out 12.99 and then throw a fit and 1-star this movie because your browser/computer/internet provider can't support the amazon player. ;)",1388448000,4,922,4.714285714285714

The over-used Jump Scares of quiet passages of conversation or quietly peering about in the creepy house, looking for the lame-looking Ghosts, followed by the predictable LOUD bang or boom noise to unnerve you, got old very fast. And the constant close-ups of the horrified women, with their staring eyes wide open, and their mouths hanging wide open, every time one of them appeared frightened by some unknown scare, just out of sight of the camera, was also over-used to the point of being laughable. Then, there were the several times that women or one of the kids was doing the fake crying act, but NO tears, which has become standard, and acceptable in today's Hollywood productions. Then, there are the predictable, stereotypical Hollywood  characters, of the woman victim, the white male, unstable killer, who is abusive towards the woman, and the token black, positive, role model, Business Professional, in this case, a Psychologist ( usually a Police Chief, or Investigator, Medical Professional, or Case Worker,...who is there to provide support for the mentally/physically abused white female lead character.)

Then, there are the Scares: The over-used routine of the poorly made up Ghosts (pasty looking white people, wearing tattered white sheets. Then, there was the possessed kid doing the silent, Zombie-like finger-pointing act at the dark closet, or the dark-empty room, or down the empty hallway. Then the fake looking Ghosts doing the same Zombie-like, silent pointing act. This too,  as a spooky effect,  lost it's credibility as a spooky effect, just from being over-used. Then here were the Ghost people. First, there were too many of them, that all looked alike, and second,....they just looked like regular people with white make-up on their faces, and the give-away red around the eyeballs, which reminded you that they were just regular people, made up to look like Ghosts. Wearing low budget tattered white sheets, some wearing the sheets over their heads. No CGI Special Effects here.

If this movie hadn't had such poor Directing, which regurgitated over-used special effects, that have become standard in all the recent el-Cheapo horror sequels, and hadn't tried to give itself credibility, by constantly relying on flashbacks from the first movie, and had used better effects for spookiness, instead of fake-looking Ghost people, and loud Jump-scare noises, and Hollywood Politically-Correct character role stereotyping.....maybe it might have had a chance to be better.  This had all the appearances of a last minute production, slapped together, to try to ride what was left of the success of the first movie. As a long time fan of well made Horror Movies, I rate this pathetic production at ONE star rating out of five possible stars",1388448000,6,3076,5.105367793240557
5595849,5,B00BEIYOMC,"Loved this movie, was very happy with everything in it.... left ya hanging in suspense before the amazing end! Would watch again!",1388448000,,129,4.909090909090909
5595850,5,B00BEIYOMC,"There are few directors who can make a truly scary movie. I'm not talking about the run of the mill movie where something jumps at the camera, the music screeches and you feel that instant adrenalin rush from what happened. I'm talking about a scary movie that has a few of those moments perhaps but that has something deeper about it that makes you walk out of a theater or turn off the DVD player and wonder if something terrifying from the screen didn't walk off and stay by your side. James Wan is a director whose name you might not know but who makes movies exactly like that.

Wan first came to notice when he co-wrote and directed a small low budget film you may have heard of called SAW. Things he did in that movie, his creative use of light and shadow, of wringing a story to get everything out of it, can be found in the other films he's done in follow up. In 2010 he made another horror film called INSIDIOUS. The story of a haunting that wasn't of a house but of a boy was a hit with movie fans that made it a successful release. It ended with the boy and his father leaving the Further, a not quite limbo between the worlds it the living and the dead, and returning home safe and sound. Or did they?

INSIDIOUS 2 comes out on DVD this week to answer that question. Picking up immediately where the first film ended, Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) stay at his mother's house since their old house is now a crime scene with the death of Elise Rainier (Lynn Shaye), the spiritual investigator that helped rescue them. Within minutes of trying to go to bed things begin to happen. Renai is the first to realize that it hasn't ended yet.

In the first moments of this movie we see the past and discover that it wasn't the first time Elise had a meeting with Josh. As a child she was there to help as well. Under hypnosis she finds out what she needs to know about the haunting and thinks that using the hypnosis she can erase the knowledge of the Further from Josh's mind forever. Alas this isn't the case.

As things begin to happen in Josh's mother Lorraine's (Barbara Hershey) house, Renai is frightened once more for her family. But this time she also has a fear of Josh as well. While he may have rescued their son and brought him back from the dark place he went to, he seems somehow different. The police suspecting him of being the one that killed Elise doesn't ease her mind any.

As Lorraine begins to see ghostly figures in her home she and Renai begin to attack the problem from different angles, neither knowing at first what the other is doing. Lorraine approaches Carl, Elise's assistant from year's back who brought her into the case. Renai on the other hand approaches Elise's assistants Specs and Tucker. Eventually their pursuits cross paths and the trio teams up to help this family.

I won't give away the details of the reveal here but the fact is they give it away early on, as a matter of fact with Renai's fear that Josh isn't the man he was. Suffice to say that the bride in black from the first film hasn't gone off to her just desserts yet. As a matter of fact just who the bride is is revealed more here than in the first film. The jump scares aren't as many here but the depth of story is more fleshed out and when it is revealed it's a much creepier concept than originally brought out.

The actors do a wonderful job here with not one taking center stage. That's a tough job when there are 2 to 3 name actors who normally would dominate the film. Instead this feels more like an ensemble piece where each has a role to play in the telling of this story. The stand out character in this film is more the lighting and camera work on display. Both flesh out the tale more than the words and acting. This isn't denigrating the actor's performances, just noting that everything from start to finish is enhanced by the use of light and shadow.

It may seem odd for this to be the top release coming out the week of Christmas to DVD but horror films seem to be more widespread these days than ever before. The good news is that this one seems to fulfill every need that horror and suspense fans will love. That means that not only is this one worth watching but one to add to the collection as well. It's that good.",1388448000,,4274,4.307213930348259

5595909,2,B00BEIYOMC,"A great sequel, prequel, or in this case chapter should stand alone. You should be able to watch it and have some sense of the movie it's connected to. You should expect that it will be just as entertaining as its predecessor.  Insidious: Chapter 2 fell short on both. The twists and turns of IC2 were so screwy, I found myself bumping into its dark places with nary a flinching of horror, only a wincing of pain. The creaky, busted rooms, broken boards, rotting skin, dusty apparitions, muddled flashbacks, and flashbacks of flashbacks so cluttered the story, that by the middle of the movie I was pushing through the detritus hoping I wouldnt get stuck there never to make it to the end. I have this horrible sense that if I continue to pick at the problems with the storyline, I might end up halfway understanding where the writers were trying to take it. Should that happen, I may get sucked into what looks to come another chapter down the road. To be honest, Im really mad; scared that Im going to scream; fearful that Ill give up watching horror movies altogether--I had so been looking forward to Insidious: Chapter 2. Could it really have been that bad? Yes, Im afraid it was.",1388361600,,1185,4.563380281690141

5595914,5,B00BEIYOMC,"What is there not to like about these Insidious movies?  I am a huge horror/thriller movie fan and so far Insidious 1, 2, and The Conjuring have been the best horror film ever.  The story is great, the thrill is great and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The storyline of Insidious has been well thought out and put together.  The second chapter basically sums everything up that has led up to this point.  It goes in great detail to tell you what and why everything has happened.  Yes the second chapter jumps around, but unless you pay close attention you might get lost.  Which therefore those ""lost viewers"" will give a bad review.  This is not your typical blood gasher, serial killer type movie, this movie delivers a thrill that most horror movies do not.  For anyone to give Insidious a bad review, just does not simply enjoy a real horror movie.  Great movie and hope they continue with a third!",1388361600,,911,4.466666666666667

I liked the 1st one better..... But it is  worth watching...... I think or hope this does it for anymore of the insidious movies.  The Conjuring was much better and a better made movie.

5595966,4,B00BEIYOMC,"This movie attempts to expand upon the story presented in the first movie and explain who the black bride was. It does a good job and the explanation is a plausible one that fits the Insidious universe.

There is a lot of violence against women and children in this movie. It is justified to a point to fill out the evilness of the black bride.

There is one thing about the movie that made me think ""really?"". At the beginning, they show a young woman playing a younger version of the Barbara Hershey character and another young woman playing a younger version of the Lin Shaye character in a ""flashback"" sequence. Both actresses have very distinct voices. However, only Lin Shaye's voice is dubbed over the actress's voice in her speaking parts. The makers of this film have just put an elephant in the room and hope you won't notice it.

The ending of the film is an open door for a chapter 3. It appears that Lin Shaye will be back for more adventures in the Further.",1388188800,,971,4.443820224719101

It's been a while since a movie has made me feel scared or truly uncomfortable, but this one doesn't even try in my opinion. The first one was much better in that regard and definitely has a creepy vibe to it. This one feels like a slap in the face to horror fans. Sure, people that don't usually watch horror flicks will soil themselves with anything remotely macabre. For those people i highly recommend watching this movie (and more importantly the first one) with all the lights on and probably a few people. However, in my opinion (whatever it's worth), if you like horror films and watch them regularly (or somewhat regularly), you'll find this either lightly entertaining, or you will be waiting for something big the whole movie and never get it, and be mostly disappointed in the end.",1388102400,2,928,4.734567901234568

Granted, there were a few moments of horror cheesiness, but this is still above par than most ""scary"" movies.  Even though the ending leaves room for a Chapter 3, I don't really know how much farther they can go with this storyline.  I hope this doesn't become another Paranormal Activity franchise.

5596101,4,B00BEIYOMC,"""Insidious: Chapter 2"" creeps its way on to Blu-ray and DVD for horror fans to either take in for the first time or enjoy again. Most people rightfully go into sequels with low expectations. They'll be happy to know that the bar has once again been raised by this thrilling follow-up to the highly successful 2011 haunted house spectacular.

The Lambert family moves into Josh's childhood house to escape the supernatural powers which manifested themselves in their own home. It doesn't take long to realize that whatever Josh (Patrick Wilson) brought back with him from the spirit world has followed them. The family must come together to uncover the dark secrets of the past and put an end to the otherworldly reign of terror they've been subjected to.

Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell fabricate a disturbing and complex tale that perfectly extends the story started with the first ""Insidious."" They've crafted something that stays with you rather than just being a short-term influence on the viewer. I walked away from it thinking I was fairly safe from any after-effects. It wasn't until I slipped into bed, fell asleep, and started having nightmares that I began to comprehend the sort of long-term influence ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" had on me.

The DVD version of ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" contains a couple special features. It includes two featurettes entitled ""Peripheral Visions: Behind the Scenes"" and ""Ghostly Transformations."" They concentrate on the making of the film and highlight the makeup process for the ghouls and ghosts.

""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of terror and violence, and thematic elements. It's a straight-shooting supernatural horror film with no detours into adult situations or nudity. I wish more genre movies would borrow from this playbook.

If you look at ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" from the point of view of a Christian, it might not be for you. It features astral projection and communication with the dead. The afterlife begins with a pit-stop of sorts that seems to be purgatory. However, it's not a nice place as reflected in its dark and shadowy atmosphere. If you can look past these different elements and just enjoy a creepy flick for what it is, this is guaranteed to satisfy.

""Insidious: Chapter 2"" starts off a little rough because of its awkward editing. The acting was a bit rusty at first as well. The movie finds its footing and makes up for all the above complaints. It has a well-thought out story that builds on, instead of repeats, what we experienced in ""Insidious.""",1387756800,,2561,5.0
5596102,5,B00BEIYOMC,This is an awesome addition to the first film. It cleverly fills in gaps and seamlessly expands the universe of Insidious and the Further.

The Director seems to have mastered the subject of making horror movies that can scare the s*** out of audience watching this film.

Storyline: The mysterious astral projection ability of Josh to be able to communicate with the Other Worlds spirits leaves him possessed by the spirit of Parker Crane, who wants to kill his family, to keep himself young, through his evil mother. In an attempt to know about the possession, Elise gets killed, by Josh for knowing the secret. Twenty five years later, Dalton, the son of Josh inherits the same ability of Josh. During investigation of the death of Elise, her friend Carl also gets killed. The displaced spirits of Josh and Carl find Elises spirit in the other world only to discover that it was Peters mother who is killing young brides, after abusing Peter. Meanwhile, the real Josh who is possessed by Peter attacks his wife Renai and his kids at home. Just at the time when the possessed Josh is about to kill them, Elise evicts Parkers mother in the Other World, thus freeing real Josh from Peters spirit. Josh and Carl in the other world, are fetched back to the real world by Dalton, with his ability to travel to the other world in sleep, and everyone is back to real world, finally. The movie ends with astral projection to be erased from the minds of Josh and Dalton through hypnosis by Carl.

Positives: A sheer horror experience more than any of the previous projects of the Director. Thoroughly enjoyable screenplay with excellent cinematography and music. Can be phrased as horror redefined. Un-believable and fictitious characterization added fuel to fire. The memories of the movie carried for a long time by the spectators. The sound effects made the film one of the best horror films ever.

Negatives: Definitely not for the weak-hearted and people with nervous disorders. Too many characters and over fictionalization confused the audience with no clear cut understanding of the story, if watched only once.

My rating is 4 out of 5",1387584000,,2187,4.868279569892473
5596104,3,B00BEIYOMC,"""I went into that place to get our son back and something followed me and killed Elise, you saw it."" After Josh Lambert (Wilson) goes into the spirit world to save his son he is shocked when he finds that this event causes the death of the woman trying to help them. When his wife Renai (Byrne) questions what happened she notices a change in Josh. This change begins to effect the entire family and when a group arrives to help the family begins to experience the terror over again. I have stated that it takes a lot to scare me. I'm not saying that to brag I'm just saying that very few movies have scared me. The three that come to mind are Poltergeist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and the first Insidious. That said I was hesitant to see this one because I was worried I would be scared again. On the plus side I wasn't scared at all, on the down side I wasn't entertained by this movie either. The first one was scary to me because of the possession of the little boy and creepy kids scare me a lot. Without trying to give too much away this movie was almost the same thing as the first one but this time Josh was possessed, and because it was an adult acting that way it didn't have the same effect on me. It felt just like another possession movie. I will say that this is still much better then most horror movies that come out but this is no where as good as the first one. Overall, yet another sequel that falls short of its predecessor. I give it a B-.",1387497600,,1462,4.151408450704225

5596190,4,B00BEIYOMC,"When the first Insidious came out, I was very impressed that a PG-13 rated movie was able to scare me so effectively.  I watch many horror movies and rarely am I impressed by one but I was very much so by the first.  Naturally, I was quite happy to learn that a second was being made and wasted no time in seeing it.  I will state up front that I didn't find is as scary as the first, the jump scares and jarring loud noises just didn't seem quite as well done.  However, I really enjoyed the storyline.  The focus isn't so much on the activity of the ghosts as it is the motivation.  Its not about what they do but why they are doing it.  We learn about Josh and his history and in doing so, many of the questions from the first film are resolved, even if those questions didn't actually feel unresolved in the first.  The story in Chapter 2 is well done and the effortless way it weaves itself into the story from the first is a testament to the wonderful writing ability of Leigh Whannell, who I personally believe is one of the best horror movie writers of our day.  James Wan returns as director and his unique visual style is on display throughout the movie.  I do see some growth in his directing from the first to the second and attribute that to his having directed The Conjuring which, while still a paranormal horror movie, was grounded in a more realistic reality.  Patrick Wilson does a wonderful job playing both his characters and it is nice to see Ty Simpkins (Dalton) have a more substantial role this time around and it appears as though he is growing into quite the young actor.  I didn't find Rose Byrne's (Renai) performance to be as great this time, her character was just a static carry over from the first.  One thing I did find distracting, but not detrimental, was the dubbing of ""old"" Elise's voice over ""young"" Elise's scene.  Again, it wasn't detrimental to the movie, just a bit distracting at first.  Overall, very good movie though I anticipate hard core fans of the original will be divided about this sequel since some of the novelty and a good deal of the scares have disappeared.",1386720000,3,2115,4.414948453608248
5596191,5,B00BEIYOMC,"Better than the first & if you haven't seen the first; no worries there's a 5 minute recap woven nicely into the first minutes of Chapter 2 (C2).  I thought C2's horror rated first class including racing pulse, jump out of my seat and believable storyline. With all the first movie starring roles appearing in C2.  Rightly so, they read a wicked good script!  This is a first rate horror movie; not a slasher or blood & guts, no exploited women or backwoods inbreds - this is what HORROR is (at least in my opinion).  If you liked Insidious, I think you'l love this one as I did.  Tell me if you agree, the last 20 seconds.......we may be lucky enough to see a C3?  Don't do it if you can't bring Patrick and Rose along for the ride......Trust me........watch it, have I ever let you down?",1386633600,7,789,4.333333333333333

5596194,3,B00BEIYOMC,"The Insidious Series has something not a lot of horror films have had and that is a creative curiosity arousing storyline. The first Insidious was one of the most riveting films I have seen. It shook the very foundation of my understanding of my senses and truly showed me what my body is to do and how it is to react to FEAR. Maybe I have never known Fear the way i did after watching Insidious.

Insidious 2 takes off from where the first one left but the overall effect is short of being called overwhelming. Yes, it is definitely scary and more or less in the same prose but I couldn't help feel this isn't James Wan at his best.

Having said that, the rating on IMDb is perfect right now for the film. It is still many notches more scary than anything else I have seen released recently.

The Conjuring and Insidious remain his best films with this at third.

James Wan has opened up the horror genre for me the way Walking Dead opened up the zombie genre. So this is what the world has come to :)",1386547200,,1002,4.230366492146596

Im looking forward to insisious becoming a trilogy!,1383091200,7,348,5.017241379310345
5596239,5,B00BEIYOMC,"""Insidious Chapter 2"" is a smart, spooky, stylish supernatural thriller that may even be better than the first movie. It is also the perfect example of why a good movie depends on more than a good director.

I can't really talk about the plot of this movie without giving away spoilers from either this movie or the previous one, since it's basically a continuation of the paranormal terrorism faced by the Lambert family. Basically, there is a woman in white, and a woman in black, each stalking the boundaries between life and death, and each with sinister intentions towards one member or another of the family. With the help of detectives, psychics, and paranormal investigators, the mother and father (who may or may not be possessed) try to solve the deadly mysteries that follow them.

Director James Wan has the strange honor of directing both the best horror film of the year, ""Insidious Chapter 2"" and the worst horror film of the year, ""The Conjuring"". I've always liked Wan's style - there is a kind of hyper-real theatricality to his filmmaking, and there is kind of a trademark visual style that he uses in all his films. But what separates ""The Conjuring"" from ""Insidious"" is the writing.

""The Conjuring"" was written by guys that wrote episodes of the ""Baywatch Nights"" TV show, as well as the Paris Hilton horror movie ""House of Wax"". The ""Insidious"" movies are written by Leigh Wannell, who also wrote several of the ""Saw"" movies. Now, you can say what you want about the damage to society inflicted by the torture-porn genre, but the screenplays of the ""Saw"" films were cleverly written to loop back and forth on each other, making a sort of meta-puzzle that could only be clearly seen from a distance above them all. Whannell does the same thing here. Some puzzling events from the first ""Insidious"" movie (that I thought were plot holes) are explained here. You can't really appreciate what this movie does if you don't remember the first one.

Sure, ""Insidious"" covers similar territory to every other horror movie of the past 40 years (and who are we kidding, the Lambert family is just an updated version of the Freeling family from ""Poltergeist""), but Whannell and Wan do pull some new things out of the bag. Instead of slamming the audience through 90 minutes of random non-stop funhouse scares (like ""The Conjuring""), Whannell is willing to let the story marinate for awhile, requiring some actual brain activity and memory recall from the audience. You don't have to understand ""The Conjuring"" to experience the fright scenes (mostly because there is nothing to understand), but some of the impact of ""Insidious"" only comes when you put the pieces together yourself.

The movie is rated PG-13 because there is no gore. But that doesn't mean it's a soft movie. There are real adult situations here, including psychosexual child abuse, serial killers, and the most over-the-top crazy mother since ""Mommy Dearest"".

If you see only one horror movie this year, see ""Insidious Chapter 2"". Well, if you've seen the first one.",1381017600,3,3047,4.8839458413926495
5596240,2,B00BEIYOMC,"Insidious took audiences by surprise in 2010, with its stylish plot elements and unique ending. Insidious broke no new ground, but everything in it worked. Now James Wan dumps the sequel in theaters to a lackluster reaction from critics (no surprise), and right on the heels of The Conjuring. I wasn't expecting much. A few laughs and intriguing suspense would have satisfied my expectations. Instead, the editing in this movie is possibly the SLOPPIEST job I have seen on film in recent memory. One scene jumps to another with little lead-in or explanation, all kinds of lame plot elements are thrown in, and the demon fails to make an appearance. That last part, being the demon's absence, is what made the first installment such a kickass flick. The cast is the same, but rather than borrowing elements from Poltergeist, the entire movie takes a turn into The Shining territory, with hints of latter-day Elm Street lameness. I was yawning by the end. BORRRRRRRIIIIIIING!",1379894400,3,973,4.975460122699387

It was a lot different than what i had imagined, i loved it, i enjoyed it and i actually went out with friends to see it on Friday The 13th which made that experience a whole lot more fun and the movie was really creepy definitely scary, that red demon in the first film wasn't really doing it for me :/ The ""Bride In Black"" just gives me the hebbie jeebies. That is the one thing i did not like about this film, we didn't get to see much of her creepin around which in my opinion would have made the film a lot better. Though saying that i do like that by not showing too much it gets the audience to wanna see more and not over show things is a good thing at times. Well anyway hell yes im buying this intimately on blu-ray whenever it comes out, i'm hoping this year and not January. I seen this 3 times at the cinemas :D hope you all enjoy it cuz i know i did. I hope they make a 3rd somehow, we need more movies like these and i hope next time around we get to see more of The Bride In Black Dx awesome scary movie i give it a 5 lol duh",1379808000,2,1078,3.8603603603603602

Pros
+All The Same actors/writers/director return for the sequel
+3 Scenes in the film worth atleast watching once

Cons
-Weak storyline
-Not frightening at all (the first was done really well and gave me a run for my money a few times)
-Comedy was over done (Not here and there to keep things a little light, but like in every scene)
-NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE FURTHER! (Just like the hellraiser series, give us more PINHEAD! Seriously tho, the first film was paced great and the sequel follows the same pacing?! Its the sequel, supposed to have more of what the first lacked? More of The Further is what I came for and didn't get)
-Same old Same old, if you have been watching horror films for a few years you will see half the film done over many times. I got bored with it, predictable.

All in all, its worth watching once. I wouldnt buy just rent or go check out in the theaters. In Theory, if you liked the first then you WONT like the second due to the fact that all the things that made the first great where missing in the second. **Dear Internet Trolls, I don't care to hear your opinion. This is my opinion, im sorry if you don't agree**",1379289600,4,1423,4.262962962962963
5596244,5,B00BEIYOMC,"[I bought the combo and here is my review]

I really hesitate to call this totally original film a franchise. James Wan creates a film that is a superb experience in the cinema, and is brilliant on the Blu-ray delivery in all respects. Thankfully, it is not a sequel in the traditional sense, and delivers the scares with both barrels. I would expect that you probably know the story by now, if not, you should see INSIDIOUS first and then come back to INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2. This film starts with scares right from the beginning, and takes you on a tremendous roller coaster ride with the original cast.
  The extras on Blu-ray are brilliant again. The work in progress: onset Q&A deals with story issues and last 23 minutes. Peripheral vision: behind-the-scenes is a great bonus and last 15 minutes. Insidious: spectral sightings are supposed to be web-i-sodes, which I hope is self-explanatory, but if you have not seen it this is next level freaky, even from the point of view of INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2, mainly because it is so intense and in a few short minutes Lynn Shaye delivers more of a power packed punch than she does in the main film. I think that if you enjoy insidious chapter 2, then insidious spectral sightings is going to be something you love. The extra HAUNTED HOSPITAL: ON LOCATION is kind of so-so but one item in it may give you a spine tingling fright. GHOSTLY TRANSFORMATIONS is about the makeup and is intriguing but would've been better in a wider documentary. Leigh Whannell's Journal is actually quite enjoyable but at eight minutes it is way too short. Overall, whilst I would've liked a commentary in the bonus, I think that what we have at the moment is pretty fun. I hope you enjoy this roller coaster ride as much as I did, or even more; I know I'll be watching it a few more times the volume up and the lights turned down... Pleasant dreams.

********************************************************

I rarely write a review of the films before the DVD or Blu-ray is out. I had no expectations of what the sequel would bring to the party. After seeing the promo I was won over. Anyone who has seen the promo/s will have an idea of what I mean. The one thing I do agree on is that any comment on this story would give away too much, but not to mention by word-of-mouth that this is a great supernatural horror film would be a disservice. As many horror films as I have seen,I sometimes think I am a little jaded, or even more accepting of the spook type of films. Lucky for me I had about 15 young people sitting in the row behind me, and every time I got spooked, they screemed or more, and this was a good barometer. For a truly scary film this one touches all bases, and if James Wan is leaving horror, then that is a big loss to supernatural horror. If you have ever walked through an old house late at night which you thought was haunted and felt the chills, then this film is for you. Even if you have ever seen what you thought was a ghost, or just a shadow casting a weird caul across your eyes, then this film is for you. Forget what people with negative comments have said, this film checks all the boxes... Pleasant dreams.",1379289600,36,3164,4.467128027681661
5596245,5,B00BEIYOMC,"""Insidious Chapter 2"" is great! This is how the story goes: The horror team of director James Wan and writer/co-star Leigh Whannell reunite with the original cast of Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey and Ty Simpkins in INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2, a sequel to the acclaimed horror film, which follows the haunted Lambert family as they seek to uncover the mysterious childhood secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world.

The cast led by Patrick Wilson (as Josh) & Rose Byrne (as Renai) is great. The directing by James Wan (also did the story) is great. The story by Wan & Leigh Whannell (also played the role of Specs) & screenplay by Whannell is great.

The music by Joseph Bishara is great. The cinematography by John R. Leonetti is great. The film editing by Kirk M. Morri is great. The casting by Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy is great. The production design by Jennifer Spence is great. The art direction by Jason Garner is great. The set decoration by Lori Mazuer, set dressings by Daniel Vazquez & Nic Weethee is great. The costume design by Kristin M. Burke is great. The visual effects supervised by Ray McIntyre Jr. is great. The special make-up effects by Liz Briseno, Steve Costanza, Mark Garbarino & Kelly Golden is great. The stunts coordinated by Joel Kramer is great.

This is a great, well-made and well-done horror movie sequel that is entertaining and intriguing. It is also, a well-crafted scary horror movie, as well. This is another great hit from James Wan (continuing his roll of hit horror movies starting with Insidious & The Conjuring), as well as, Leigh Whannell. This is one of the best horror movies of the year. It is also a great horror movie to watch on Friday the 13ths, which, ironically, it opened on.",1379203200,2,1775,4.737864077669903
5596246,3,B00BEIYOMC,"The horror genre is currently in a state of heightened popularity - and one of the men responsible is James Wan.  For those that don't know his name, he is one of the creators and directors of the horror saga, Saw - which introduced the Jigsaw killer, a mysterious vigilante that tested the will of his victims through various methods of torture.  While the Saw franchise wasn't exactly a critic's delight, the series went on to become the highest grossing horror film franchise of all-time.  After exiting the Saw franchise, Wan went on to direct two more popular horror flicks - Insidious in 2011 and The Conjuring in the summer of 2013.  With the massive success of Insidious (grossing nearly $100 million on a measly budget of $1.5 million), a sequel was quickly predicted, which is also written and directed by Wan - titled Insidious: Chapter 2.

The horror sequel, Insidious: Chapter 2, picks up right where its predecessor left off - focusing on Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson), his wife, Renai (Rose Bryne), and their son, Dalton (Ty Simpkins).  Just when they get their son back and assume their lives can return to normalcy, Renai and her mother-in-law, Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), continue to see ghosts in their home.  With the death of Elise (Lin Shaye) and Josh acting peculiar, the family enlists the help of Carl (Steve Coulter), a former friend of Elise that attempts to discover the identity of the ghosts and also who is responsible for her murder.  Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampons, and Jocelin Donahue also star in supporting roles.

The Insidious films are just two films on an ever-growing list of horror flicks that stick to the generic, yet oddly popular supernatural haunted house gimmick.  It would appear the days of the slasher killer have gone by the wayside (a trend that will no doubt return with full force one day), giving way to stories about families living in houses with creaky doors, uninvited ghosts, and children with bad dreams.  You'd think this style of storytelling would have grown tiresome long, long ago, but the majority of the modern horror genre heavily resembles films similar to Insidious.  Even James Wan's previous endeavor, The Conjuring, deals with supernatural ghouls invading the home of an innocent family.  And, although these films all resemble one another - they work.  The stories are interesting, creepy, and have propelled the horror genre to unimaginable, unpredictable heights - a trend that will continue with the success of Insidious: Chapter 2.

We all know that sequels carry more criticism than the originals, due to their long history of being inferior in comparison.  Sure, we can always find a few exceptions to the rule, but more often than not - sequels simply act as desperate attempts to cash in on a massive wave of success.  This Insidious sequel is guilty of being both inferior to its predecessor and riding the wave of success.  However, this film needed to be made and that's saying something that doesn't usually need to be said about most sequels.  Insidious: Chapter 2 is a must see for anyone that enjoyed the first film, mostly because it does a better job of telling a meaningful story.  The first film, for all its successes, lacked closure for characters that were undeniably enjoyable.  Thankfully, this second film wraps up the story of the Lambert family with a big red ribbon, and even makes plans for the future of the franchise.

This is one of those reviews where even the simplest comment can give away big pieces of the story, so there's no need to go into too much detail other than to say Josh is definitely possessed - which was made abundantly clear at the end of the first film.  From there, this story explains who the ghosts are that continuously haunt the family in their waking hours and in their dreams.  And, even though the story gets a little too carried away with itself as the major plot secrets are revealed, it all works out very well in the end.  This story incorporates a weird time travel element that really makes absolutely no sense, but the way in which it's used is cleverly constructed - thus making a fully explained story out of both films, which now act as one complete circle of events.  James Wan even goes the full length to show reconstructed scenes from the first film that was left unexplained, like the scene where Josh hears a knock at the front door, which will clearly explain what was mysteriously setting off the home security system.

While the child, Dalton, was the center of attention in the first film, the father - Josh, is now the central character that's in need of rescuing.  This is exciting news for fans of Patrick Wilson, who absolutely shines in this role of protagonist and antagonist.  There's a certain mysterious attraction to his style that makes him a pleasant addition to horror flicks - which he's been thriving in after starring in Insidious, The Conjuring, and now Insidious: Chapter 2.  However, if the story follows the course laid out in the closing moments of this film, it would appear Wilson may be done with the Insidious franchise, which will undoubtedly spawn at least one more sequel - and likely even more than that.  Still, it might in fact be the supporting cast, which includes Saw and Insidious co-creator Leigh Whannell, that (minor spoiler) carries this franchise into the second sequel.

Overall, Insidious is nothing more than an average addition to the horror genre.  It's certainly not the scariest movie you'll ever see, and definitely not as scary as the first film, but it manages to fulfill its duty of making people squirm in their seats every few minutes.  The bottom line here is that this particular film will have more significance to the fans of the first film - since it picks up right where that story lives off.  While the first flick could have stood on its own merit, this sequel serves as a prequel and sequel all in one, providing origin stories for several characters, all while progressing the overall vastness of the Insidious experience.  The film can be overzealous at times, but in the end, it all works itself out in a way that will appease horror fans and also create a moderate amount of buzz for the next sequel.  Much like the Saw franchise, it would appear that this franchise will carry on, only with a new set of victims set to replace the Lambert family (and no that doesn't necessarily mean they die).

5596247,5,B00BEIYOMC,"First of all, let me just say that The Conjuring, Insidious, and Insidious Chapter 2 are all very effective and well-done horror movies. James Wan is on a roll, and honestly, so is Patrick Wilson because he is the common denominator in all 3 of these movies. Quite frankly, in my opinion, it is thanks to these movies that have successfully breathed life back into the horror genre. This is refreshing after sitting around for the last decade and a half watching campy, slasher, gory, and extremely bloody so-called scary movies that have left me nothing but disappointed and anything but scared. I was wondering when Hollywood was going to realize that tons of blood splatter is just like any other over-used effect; there's nothing really that special about it. I'm not sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what's going to happen next if I can already expect a masked killer, a home invasion, tons of teen sex and drug use, contraptions of torture, or a documentary-style horror film that looks like someone just grabbed a video camera, took it into a dark backyard or the woods, cut on the night-vision, and relied on heavy breathing and running away from unseen forces to move the audience. All of that is lazy, mundane, and it shows lack of creativity as well as originality. I am sick to death of that crap. As a horror movie buff, I thought it was virtually impossible to make a scary movie these days, or at least try to make a movie that pushes the envelope a little bit...dare to be different if you will! I know there isn't much that many of us can say we haven't seen before, but how it's executed is what's important in my book.

This movie starts right at the end of the first one (smart move). The audience is thrust right back into the evil that is STILL following the Lamberts from the first film (another smart move). If you want to keep me interested in something; please don't ignore the film's predecessors just to make money. Those films still have merit, and have laid the foundation for what comes next. Anyway, it's clear that there's still a murder to be solved (another smart move), and there's something seriously off about Josh. The film also includes more interaction with the Lambert children this time around. The dead spirits are more aggressive, so it's clear they aren't there to mess around.

This movie also didn't drag around for the first 40 minutes like the first film did. However, what I loved most about this movie is that it answers all your questions about the previous film (gigantic smart move). Nothing from the first movie is what it seems. I'm so glad this movie didn't start off with an entirely different entity before they expounded on what the first one was in its entirety. I wanted to know the story. I had already figured out the ending from the first film that some overlooked because they were so focused on the music and the look of the red-faced demon. The fact of the matter is that the target never was the little boy; the target was the dad all along. The child was just being held hostage and used to lure the dad back into the Further so the dead spirit that almost had him while he was a child could successfully take his body which was originally intended. The boy was the bait. Don't get me wrong, the red-faced demon with the hooves was going to take the boy's body too; he just wasn't the primary focus. Red face was just ensuring Dalton stayed out long enough to be possessed as well. I don't think some people got that; it was a win/win situation for both entities who wished to live again. Knowing that, it all makes perfect sense.

I don't want to give too much of this movie away, but you will be surprised to see what this thing is that has been following Josh since his childhood which just shows how tenacious and persistent these entities can be. It also gives you more insight into how deep Josh's gift of astral projection really runs. Josh and Dalton's out-of-body experiences play an interesting role in this movie, and adds something a little different into the mix instead of a typical family battling the paranormal. I appreciate that! Dalton proves to be quite useful and clever in this one, and he handles his gift like a seasoned pro. I had to mention Ty Simpkins because he did great in both films.

This movie is just like The Conjuring in the sense that there is something for everybody and it plays on your worst fears:
Afraid of the closet...check!
Afraid of the dark...check!
Afraid of the things that go bump in the night...check!
Afraid of ghosts, possession, and dead demonic spirits...check!
Afraid of harm coming to your children...check!
Afraid of being a prisoner in your own body and your home...check!

My suggestion is that you have to see this movie at least once.",1379116800,122,4775,4.586651053864169
