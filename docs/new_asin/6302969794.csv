530328,5,6302969794,"I became a fan of the more artistic genre of Japanese film with Kurosawa's Throne of Blood and Hidden Fortress, both black and white classics of the style.  After I happened to see this collection of stories on TV,  I  ordered the video.  Still impressed after several viewings, I've decided to  purchase the DVD version when it comes out this fall so I can see the film  in it's most perfect form for home viewing.  The collection is based on a  series of short stories by a Louisiannan writer, Lafacado Hearn.  Kwaidan  is Japanese for ghost stories, a type of fiction I've enjoyed since  childhood introduction to MacBeth and The Christmas Carole, and these are  some very well written examples.  My favorites of this collection were the  Woman in the Snow and Earless, the former for director Kobayashi's  incredible sense of color, sound and setting, and the latter for his sense  of historical pagentry and drama and its surprise ending.  An incredible  piece of artwork.  I will probably give my video version to a friend who is  also fond of the genra and an afficionado of all things Japanese.",964828800,32,1102,4.73015873015873
530329,5,6302969794,"""Kwaidan"" is a cinematic masterpiece of the horror genre which, unfortunately, is not nearly as well known to genre fans as it should be. In my view it ranks with Werner Herzog's 1979 re-make of  ""Nosferatu"" as the finest horror film ever made in color. Part of  the reason for  ""Kwaidan""'s obscurity is its national origin  (though, strangely enough, the Japanese folktales which form its basis were  written by an American expatriate, Lafcadio Hearn). Yet even in Japan, the  film was a commercial flop, despite superlatives from critics. More likely,  the obscurity of ""Kwaidan"" derives from its artistry; viewers who  come to it for the first time will probably be only marginally aware that  they're seeing horror at all. Search in vain for gore and special effects;  the film almost recalls Val Lewton's old classics in its reliance on  suggestion. As an anthology, moreover, ""Kwaidan"" is in the same  league as the 1946 British film, ""Dead of Night,"" except that it  has no over-arching ""frame"" device to tie the stories together.  All four films which make it up are essentially revenge plots: simple and  straightforward, like most folktales, though I would like to mention a  personal favorite: ""Yuki-Onna,"" whose surrealist account of a  female vampire awed me with its weird snow-scapes and  eerie soundtrack. By  all means, see ""Kwaidan"" if you have any curiosity at all about  horror as viewed through the lens of an artistic master; I only wish  American directors had a comparable interest in quality.",963532800,26,1517,5.036290322580645
530330,5,6302969794,"This film is so utterly magnificent, it's on eof the greatest films of all time. It has the most gorgeous art work, dream-like visuals, color photography I've ever seen in film. This is based on tales by Lafcadio  Hearn. A bizzare, eerie and horrifying musical score by Toru Takemitsu  works exellently with the beautiful visuals. This video also has a gorgeous  color Cinemascope widescreen presentation. The first tale Black Hair, is a  bit slow, but's it's so worth it in the unbelievable horror climax. The  second tale, Woman in the Snow, is one of the best and most beautiful in  the whole film. Masaki Kobayashi uses just all white during the blizzard  sequinces with some blood reds, lush greens, dream like blues, and odd  purples. The third story, Hoichi, the Earless, begins with one of the most  beautiful scenes in the film. An epic sea battle between the Heikie and  Genji clans. This scene feautures all kinds of bizzare and beautiful colors  including a firey red sky. The rest of the film concerns a young blind  man's horrifying ordeal with ghosts. I can see some references to this  segment in Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The final segment is called In a Cup of  Tea and is the weakest. It's too short, and too fast moving. It does  feature lots of gorgeous visuals to make up for it. I recommend this film  to anyone, if you haven't seen this film. CLICK BUY RIGHT NOW!",946425600,15,1383,4.652892561983471
530331,5,6302969794,"Fine, fine movie; sometimes I like Kobayashi even better than Akira Kurosawa. This movie reminded me of Kurosawa's ""Dreams,"" only it is 4 ghost stories rather than 8 (was it 8?) vignettes. The visual style is  coloful, surreal, and deliciously imaginative, and the emotional and  aesthetic atmospheres could be described exactly the same way. An  incredible and bizarre soundtrack aids the film further yet. The only  weakness is that it's a bit slow on the start-up; the first tale is good,  but a bit simplistic to serve as a kick-off, and the second tale, despite  some amazing visual imagery, is the least satisfying of the four. The third  is excellent (although you have to change tapes halfway through it, grr),  and the fourth is wonderful as well -- if it were a little longer, and more  complete, it would be my favorite. All in all a fine, unusual, and  rewarding atmospheric Japanese film.",939513600,7,901,4.830065359477124
530332,4,6302969794,"Of the four stories, ""Hoichi the Earless"" is the most memorable. Not only is the famous composer Takemitsu Toru's music used most eeriely, the ghosts really have a reason to be grumpy (they all died  ""heroic"" deaths in a battle from ancient Japanese history.) This  third tale also features Takeshi Shimura, who reprises the role of a priest  from Seven Samurai - for real this time. His presence in reassuring, even  after he admits to the mistake that costs Hoichi his appendages.
The  uneveness mainly has to do with the first two tales, ""Black Hair""  and ""Woman of the Snow"", both of which suffer from weak  editing/pacing of the narrative. ""Black Hair"" does live up to the  promise of a ghostly tale by the end --- a beautiful fusion of restrained  eerieness and horrifying effects of camera-induced disturbance. Famed actor  Tatsuya Nakadai remains his own profile in ""Woman of the Snow"",  however, making the most disappointing segment of the movie (even the eye  in the sky is more contrived than the corlorful battle-scenes of Hoichi!)  These first 2 stories are also typical of demonizing the female as  threatening supernaturals, but that's a construction the movie obeys rather  than creates.
All in all, Kwaidan's successfully rendered atmosphere of  horror and despair in the last two tales are well worth the time. Don't  skip the beginning though - for Takemitsu's masterful music and the  effective dye-in-motion that introduce the tales.",928454400,5,1455,5.042016806722689

530334,5,6302969794,"Kwaidan presents four stories of the supernatural. Each story is beautifully produced and thought provoking. Kwaidan is not a horror film in the American context of freightening images and fast pace. Freightening  aspects of this movie are generated by realizations and associations that  occur in the viewer, as a result of the images and story line presented by  the movie. It is a much more personalized form of horror than we normally  experience.
I recommend this movie highly to anyone with a thoughtful  turn of mind.",915494400,3,524,5.046511627906977
530383,5,6302969794,"I have always had a fascination with culture, and spirituality. Japan has always ranked high on my list. This is a movie which takes several of its traditional stories as penned by the late Lafcadio Hearn. Which if you have read any Japanese folk tales in English, you have come across at least something influenced by him.
Either way, this film is artistically done, and the stories are woven well, and with a sense of Nuance, always keeping to the atmosphere of the original tales. If you want a taste of Japanese Folklore, and not ""holly-wooded up"" then you will certainly enjoy the stories in this film.",1488240000,,607,4.682242990654205
530384,5,6302969794,"I've been looking for this movie since it was mentioned in Carl Sagan's ,""Cosmos"" tv series. The Young Emperor's story was mention when Sagan talked of the evolution of the soft shell crabs with a warrior's face on the back of their shell. Seems the cabbers saw the face and through all the crabs with that face back into the bay where they found them out of respect for said warrior's. So,now all of those crabs have that face on them.

This struck my interest. A number of years later I was flipping channels and just happened to come across the segment of Kwaidan that was use in the Sagan Series. Love this movie! Haunting without all the gore.",1486684800,,648,4.445378151260504

530390,5,6302969794,"This film of four ghost stories, based on Lafcadio Hearns retelling of Japanese folktales (though only one seems to be specifically from the book called Kwaidan), is a visual treat. It is more meditative than scary, having the ceremonial dignity of traditional Japanese theater. Indeed, with its live actors placed in artificial, sometimes even painted, sets and backdrops, it has very much the air of expanded stage plays. (Even the comic servants in the longest story, Hoichi the Earless, bear more resemblance to Shakespeares clown characters than to real people.) Its beauty lies not so much in the tales themselves as in the brilliant colors and dancelike movements with which they are told. Every shot is as carefully composed as a Japanese painting. The strange (at least to Western ears) music and sound effects add to the striking yet distancing mood.

As Geoffrey OBrien points out in the thoughtful essay included with the DVD, the four stories feature promises broken, deliberately or otherwise, and the dangers of interaction between the natural and supernatural worlds. In the first story, The Black Hair, a selfish samurai deserts his painfully patient first wife, then finds, after a long absence, that going home again is not as easy as he had hoped. The young woodcutter in the second story, The Woman of the Snow, more understandably forgets a promise he made long ago in what seemed like a dreambut with equally disastrous results. In Hoichi the Earless, the blind young musician-monk Hoichi does not willingly stop entertaining a court of long-dead nobles with his bardic account of the battle in which they all perished; he is more or less forced to do so by the older monks who are trying to protect him, but he is nonetheless the one who suffers when their protection proves not quite good enough. The final tale, In a Cup of Tea, is a suitably mystifying story-within-a-story that, in a sense, breaks a promise to its viewers in that it has no ending.

This Criterion recording, a 2015 Blu-Ray reissue of Masaki Kobayashis 1965 film, is beautiful throughout, as they usually are, though it is a little grainy at times on a large TV screen. Its dialogue is in Japanese, with English subtitles.

530433,5,6302969794,"This is a most see ghost story.
I said ghost story not a horror film since it is not that horrifying but rather a bit scary.
It is consists of four tales that are  ""Black Hair"": ""The Woman in the Snow"":  ""Hoichi the Earless"":  ""In a Cup of Tea"":

First story is about a samurai who was divorced with a truely good wife and remarried with a wicked new woman and felt regret and goes to the first wife to ask for forgiveness only to find that she is now dead and became a dead corpse.
He spends a night with her not knowing that she is dead. She appears to be alive and they made love. She was a ghost.
It was too late when he felt regret and came back to her.

The second story is about a man who meets this strange ghost like woman in the forrest and she tells him never to tell anyone about her. He tells her that he will never tells anyone.
Later she reappears to him and not knowing that she is the one who he met, he falls in love with her and married, bear three child and lived happy.
But he made mistake and tells her about this woman whom he met on the forrest.
Being angry, she leaves.
It was too late for him. One mistake ruined his whole happiness.

Third story is about this blind young man who sings so well that ghosts who are asking him to sing an epic ballad of their death battle for them.
They invites him to their strange place.
Knowing that he is bewhitched, and ghosts are draining away his life, the monks set out to protect him by writing a holy mantra over his body to make him invisible to the ghosts.

Fourth story is about a writer tells the story of a man who keep seeing a mysterious face reflected in his cup of tea. It is kind of spooky.

All four stories tells some kind of meaning, teaches us something in life.
None of them are very scary but from time to time we feel that they are very well made and artistic.

The sky being painted- eye in the sky, blue, red, purple, and so on- are so beautitul and mystery to look at.
All of them are totally controlled by the crews and they are mostly shot in set just like the movie 2001 Space movie.

You should watch this movie for sure.",1466294400,,2113,4.045563549160671

I won't go into a plot summary that you can read elsewhere, but everything on the disc is everything you need to know about the film and its source's author Lafacadio Hearn. There's an interview with the director Masaki Kobayashi and his assistant director, and another one about Hearn. The 2K digital restoration is marvelous and what's even better is how we have the complete film for the first time on video. On other Criterion reviews I complained about hard-to-read subtitles on their B&W films, but these are generally good on this color film. It would have been better if they were presented on the lower black bar below the 2:35 Image because they sometimes distract from the glorious visuals. Luckily, there are not a lot of them as the four stories have long stretches not requiring them.

The best part of this disc for me is Stephen Prince's explicit commentary. I know many people who don't listen to them, but Criterion ones are scholarly and not from a director blowing his own horn. I own his fine book on the films of Kurosawa called 'The Warrior's Camera' and he's provided great Criterion commentaries for some of his films. Not only does he tell you about KWAIDAN's history and the period it's set in, you will learn why camera placement and movement, and editing are important in telling a story. Prince spends plenty of time discussing Toru Takemitsu's music and sound design, both as important as the visuals. If you don't listen to this commentary, you'll be missing a lot and it will be your loss.

Overall, bravo Criterion!

Four ghost stories make up this over three hour long film which are based on Lafacdio Hearn's collection of Japanese folk tales. Most of the films were staged in an aeroplane hangar with meticulous sets that often don't hide the fact that they are stages as abstract painted skyscapes dominate the backgrounds. The film combines naturalism with theatre to create a unique vision of a haunting supernatural world.

530484,5,6302969794,"Kwaidan (1964) Japanese folk/ghost tales /fairy-tales with supernatural and theatrical like cinematography.  That is right this film is very artsy and the settings, camera work, light is very nostalgic and Gone With the Wind-like.  Actually, the cinematography of story # 2 is the equivalent of Scarlet O'Hara's Tara plantation set.  The film is 183 minutes long. It is composed of four stories, approximately each one 40-45 minutes long.  The budget of the film was estimated at the time for 350,000,000 Japanese Yen.  Tremendous amount of money.  I would not classify this entirely into a horror.  Only the first two stories have something to do with horror.  The last two stories are weakest and make this film lose its interest after the first two.  Be there as it may, I still gave this film 5 stars.  It is a feast for eyes...cinematographicly dazzling !

*Favorite stories out the four:
1) ""The Black Hair"" [husband leaves wife for a wealthier woman...the new marriage is unhappy...years go by...husband leaves the second wife and heads back to the previous wife...upon his return...
2) ""The Woman of the Snow"" [young lumberjack together with his master gets trapped in a snow storm in the middle of a forest...the two find
 a hut to wait-out the blizzard...a young woman dressed in white appears and kills the master...she lets the young man live, but asks him to keep a secret about what has occurred or else he too will be killed, to-which he agrees...the young man gets back to his home where quickly recovers from sickness and soon meets a young and pretty lady he marries...the couple have children...years go by...

Worth mentioning is also the music...it is creepy at times and very oriental.

If you like the literature by Edgar Allan Poe, The Grim Brothers, and Christian Andersen this film should blow you away.

Rating = ***
Director:  Masaki Kobayashi
DVD
1964

Film = barely three (3) stars; production values = 4.5 stars; restoration = three (3) stars.  Director Masaki Kobayashi has strung together four short stories that come across more as one-act theater plays than as film shorts.  This overly long production suffers from the major flaw of telling ghost stories that are NOT scary!  Each act proceeds at glacial pace without even a surprise ending (the script telegraphs the final outcomes well in advance).  After putting what appears to be a major chuck of his production budget into lavish sound-stage sets, the Director does not seem to have had much left over for ghost effects, aside from jump cuts, basic stage-like lighting (spot lights, fades to and from dark, etc.), and primitive optical dissolves.  Acting is mostly bland and undistinguished.  Cinematography (wide screen, color) and set design are excellent.  Scene lighting is often too dark, especially for interiors.  (This is a shame, since it reduces the impact of the film's spectacular sets as well as the body language and facial expressions of the actors.)  Restoration fails to remove wear lines that appear during the opening credits and periodically in each story.  Often the sound track sounds like there is a washing machine operating in the background.  The long opening credits are almost totally silent.  (So don't panic and think that your audio system has failed!)  Much of the film's ""score"" consists of bizarre, random sounds/noises unrelated to what is taking place on screen.  Be prepared to be disappointed.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1443225600,,1670,5.191011235955056

530530,4,6302969794,"These four stories offer a pleasant change from most ghost-story movies - Western ones, where shock value trumps plot or imagery. ""Snow Woman,"" in particular, offers remarkable skies and snowscapes. The third piece, about the blind story-teller, features spectacular, elegant interiors - and a stark, startling contrast to how Western palace interiors and events might be staged.

And, with its distinctly Eastern tone, it's hard to believe that these stories were written by Lafcadio Hearn, originally a Westerner, but who assimilated Japanese culture so completely that little if any trace of his European roots remained.

530639,5,6302969794,"Amongst all the great films from the Golden Age of Japanese cinema (roughly between ""Rashomon"" in 1950 and ""Samurai banners"" in 1969), this one is amongst the longest and the most peculiar - but it is nevertheless a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

After being very busy in the 50s and once the monumental trilogy ""The Human Condition"" (his Opus Magnum) wrapped up in 1961, Masaki Kobayashi had to slow down a little, mostly because of sheer exhaustion... Between 1962 and 1968 he made only five films (and then had to take again a two years sabbatical) - but three of those films immediately entered to the patheon of world cinema. The first one of this trio was ""Harakiri"" in 1962 and the third was ""Samurai rebellion"" in 1967. Between them, there was ""Kwaidan"".

""Kwaidan"" is very different from other Kobayashi's films and also very different from virtually any other Japanese film I ever saw. Come to think of it, it is actually completely different from ANYTHING I EVER SAW on the screen... It is an anthology of carefully selected Japanese folkloric ghost stories - but even if ghosts and also one vampire appear, it is NOT REALLY a horror film.

There are four stories and Kobayashi decided to NOT link them together - they are completely separate tales.

1. The Black Hair

It is the saddest and the most shocking of them. A dirt poor samurai brutally divorces and abandons his loving, hard working, devoted wife to marry again, this time into a rich, influent family. Can anything good come out of such a dark deed? Is it even possible to atone for such a deadly sin? This story answers those questions without any ambiguity. Beautiful Michiyo Aratama, who already starred in ""Human condition"" as Michiko, plays here the wronged first wife - and she is a splendor to contemplate!

2. The woman of the snow.

One winter, in the high mountains, two poor woodcutters surprised by blizzard have the misfortune to meet a deadly vampire - the Snow Woman. One will quickly die, the other one... well, the rest is for you to discover. An excellent story, found in many regions of the world, including the places greatly distant from Japan... Tatsuya Nakadai, one of Japan's greatest actors ever, plays the main hero of the story. This segment includes also as background decorations some surrealistic paintings,  la Salvador Dali.

3. Hoichi the Earless.

The longest and the most spectacular segment. Hoichi is a young blind boy, working as servant in a buddhist temple. He is also gifted with excellent memory and already earn renown for his recitations of the great epic saga ""Heike Monogatari"", describing the Gempei War, in which in XII century clans Taira and Minamoto clashed for domination. One evening Hoichi is invited to recitate by a proud samurai claiming to work for ""the most distinguished person in the land"", but who asks for great discretion. What follows is for you to discover... Takashi Shimura, who much earlier, in 1954, became worldwide famous as the leader of the ""Seven samurai"", plays here the important character of the head priest of the temple.

4. In a cup of tea.

One day a thirsty samurai goes for a drink of water - and then discovers in the cup something completely unexpected! This is the shortest segment and also the only one left- deliberately - without ending, as it is adapted from a fragmentary old script, which its anonymous author never finished. It is also the only one to contain a little bit of humor in it - albeit ultimately the story is NOT funny AT ALL! Nothing more will be said.

At 183 minutes ""Kwaidan"" is a long film, but I didn't really feel it! In fact, at the end I was pretty much game for more - but sadly, there will be no more... because Masaki Kobayashi never considered making a suite and since 1996 he is no more with us... It was very deservedly nominated for the Oscar of best foreign film in 1965, but didn't get the award.

IMPORTANT! If you consider purchasing this film, make certain that you buy the edition, which offers the restored FULL length (183 minutes) version. I have the Region 2 ""Masters of Cinema"" version, but please be aware that it will NOT play on US+Canada DVD players - you will need a multi-region DVD player for that.

Bottom line, this is a very original and very good, powerful and beautiful film. I am very happy that I bought and watched it and I will keep my DVD for a future re-viewing. Enjoy!",1380585600,3,4436,4.683804627249358

non-fiction books (Christian); history; ancient biblical archaeology and cultural anthropology. I also love watching foriegn films.
Kwaidan is a Japanese (4) story horror movie which is excellent and I have been watching this movie since I was a little girl.
the translation is ""ghost story"" Kwaidan. is a 1964 Japanese portmanteau film directed by Masaki Kobayashi; the title means 'ghost
story'. It is based on stories from Lafcadio Hearn's collections of Japanese folk tales. The film consists of four separate and unrelated stories. Kwaidan is the archaic transliteration of Kaidan, meaning ""ghost story"". It won the Special Jury Prize at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival[1] and an Academy Award nomination. Kaidan is a Japanese word consisting of two kanji. In its broadest sense, kaidan refers to any ghost or horror story, but it has an old-fashioned ring to it that carries the connotation of Edo period Japanese folktales. Kaidan may have been influenced by its Chinese counterpart, a collection of ghost stories known as Liaozhai
zhiyi , or more popularly known as Liaozhai. The term is no longer as widely used in Japanese as it once was: Japanese horror books and films such as Ju-on and Ring would more likely be labeled by the katakana hor (""horror"") or the standard Japanese kowai hanashi Kaidan is only used if the author/director wishes to specifically bring an old-fashioned air into the story. It is an
unusual ghost stories - nothing like the so called horror movies that you would find in the states. There are a lot of lessons to be
learned after watching these stories. I loved Kwaidan, but, you would have to appreciate foriegn films and especially foriegn horror
films. This is not a episode of slasher movies. These 4 stories all have to do with the ""SUPERNATURAL""!!! and it is all subtitled
in english. I hope you enjoy it.",1379376000,10,1977,4.869436201780416
530641,5,6302969794,"Master filmmaker Masaki Kobayashi presents four chilling tales of terror in the Japanese classic, KWAIDAN. As adapted from the works of Lafcadio Hearn, these traditional ghost stories draw deeply from the cultural roots in which Hearn had become immersed.

""The Black Hair"" follows an estranged husband who leaves home to marry in to a rich family. He only finds further discomfort in this new marriage, and decides to return to the wife he loved some years later. Although she shows no signs of aging and welcomes him home with an eager embrace, something seems terribly off upon his return... The next tale, entitled ""The Woman in the Snow,"" finds two woodcutters trapped in a terrible snowstorm. They take refuge in a small hut, but the mysterious woman that controls the elements returns to claim them. The woman takes pity on one of the men, and spares his life in exchange for his silence. Years pass, and the young woodcutter takes a wife. After experiencing an odd vision over dinner, the woodcutter forgets his vow, and tells his wife of that fateful night, never expecting the grave consequences that would follow. ""Hoichi the Earless"" is by far the strongest of the stories, and tells of a great battle between two rival clans that left hundreds of soldiers dead in a sea of blood. The spirits of the fallen warriors lure a blind musician from the local monastery to perform their tale in song, but with each nightly visit to their sunken shrine, more of Hoichi's life force is stolen. It is up to the remaining monks to place a protective spell over Hoichi in order to save him from entering the spirit world. Finally, a writer's fate is sealed ""In a Cup of Tea"" when a ghostly tale comes to life and threatens to entrap his soul.

Kobayashi fully explores the medium of film making as a dramatic art form, using sights, sounds, and storytelling to achieve the the otherworldly visions of horror that come to life on screen. The most impressive aspect of the film, beyond even the acting, is the incredible art design. From the expressionist backdrops to the immaculate sets, KWAIDAN provides a stunning visual experience that gives the film a sense of dreamlike wonder. The frightening image of Hoichi set amongst the fog as he plays to the spirits is a moment of pure mood and atmosphere that bests even the works of the great Mario Bava. Tru Takemitsu is very careful with his use of sound, relying just as much on the eerie ambiance of the quiet sets as he does on his own jarring effects. Meanwhile, Kobayashi takes great care in developing his characters through a slow and deliberate pace. It is here that we find true horror, not in momentary shocks or gore, but through the deeply disturbing scenes of human tragedy that provide no emotional recourse. This is best seen and felt throughout the first two stories, in which love and loss are personified in the most horrific of ways.

KWAIDAN exemplifies the traditions of Japanese Horror, and will forever remain a classic within the genre.

530642,2,6302969794,"This movie is apparently a series of classical Japanese horror stories.  While they may have been effective as storytelling in an agricultural era, the movie version is extremely tame by today's standards.

It is basically a collection of four ghost stories and won an award at Cannes in 1965, probably because the special effects were new at the time.  But this shows how quickly movies can become outdated as it pales with anything seen today.

These stories lack the realism shown in great Japanese fictional works such as Rashomon, Woman in the Dunes, Onibaba, and Tokyo Story.  Most of the scenes are done in studios and this further lessens their appeal. I got so bored that I couldn't watch the last story.  But people probably want to watch this movie because they are familiar with the underlying stories.

This is the second movie I have seen by Kobayashi and it hardly measures up to the great Japanese masters such as Kurosawa, Teshigahara, Shindo, or Ozu.  This movie may be primarily of interest to students of Japanese film history.",1368835200,3,1047,4.842696629213483
530643,3,6302969794,"Visually this film is stunning, but on the level of horror its not very creepy. The best segment is The Lady In The Snow which is a little bit creepy, but in a very minimal way. The sound was extremely poor at times with effects such as the clanking of horse hooves done so badly that youd feel relieved to hear the sound of two pieces of wood being wacked together as an effect of people hitting each other in a very trashy Kung Fu movie. The sound effects are absolutely horrid in this film much of the time. The ghostly stories are not all that haunting, scary, or unsettling. There are better older Japanese horror films that are far more effective on the creep meter. If you want something much creepier try Onibaba instead. If you want lush visuals rather than splendid substance then this might be the ticket. All in all very beautifully photographed with lovely backgrounds and colors, and some mild chills. Other than that I found this film to be more of an artsy experiment lacking any real solid horror.",1367712000,2,1014,4.516304347826087

530645,5,6302969794,"These four short ghost stories are lessons in lighting, art direction and economy. I was very impressed with the cinematography, the moody build up of suspense and clever use of colour which was controlled by the artificial sets spectacularly. What I mean about economy - take a look at the second short which is worth the price of admission alone. The snow Goddess is bent over the wood collector and takes the heat of his life away from him. The way this is depicted is a simple change of lighting. Such brilliance so simple yet real -wonderful art! The other three films are also very good. I loved the amusing surprises and twists that are typical of strange and mysterious ghost stories the world over.
Not for everyone - not sure why. I have recommended and lent this out to many but not everyone gets it. - Fortunately the stories are short so investing 20 minutes to watch at least see one (I'd recommend #2) or so is really worth it.

530709,5,6302969794,"Many people would put a movie by Akira Kurosawa on the list of top ten films, and that choice would be justified.  There are quite a few Japanese filmmakers who have earned a place on that sort of list.  But for me, the first movie that always comes to mind when I think of great Japanese films is the horror classic, Kwaidan, directed by Masaki Kobayashi.

Based on the ghost stories collected by Lafcadio Hearn, Kwaidan is spooky, gorgeous, and fascinating.  It takes its inspiration from classic Japanese illustrations of ghost stories.  The last time I watched it I realized something amazing - this lavish production was filmed entirely inside a studio.  This includes a segment depicting sea battles.

The first segment, ""Black Hair,""  is not my favorite, but I like it more every time I see it.  I think it depicts the true experience of a haunting, which is always more psychological in nature.  A samurai is sick of poverty, so he abandons his wife and marries the vain daughter of a wealthy nobleman.  His fortunes immediately improve, but he can't forget the wife he so callously abandoned.  Eventually this obsession with the past wrecks his new life, and he goes home again to salvage his old life.  But what is waiting there for him?  I love the gorgeous, moody sets in this one.  I especially like the character of the spoiled new wife.  She isn't likable, but she's very interesting.

The second story, ""The Snow Maiden,"" has a lot in common with European fairy tales.  A man witnesses a fey creature killing another man.  She almost kills him too, but she falls in love with him and can't bring herself to kill him.  Instead, she makes him promise never to tell anyone what he's seen.  The actress who plays this creature manages to make her really scary, just with her body movements and facial expressions.  I think she takes her cues from classical Japanese theater - at times her expressions are mask-like.  The same actress manages to look warm and kind when the fey creature imitates a human woman so she can marry the man.  The outcome of this union also mirrors European folk tales - I won't reveal it here.  I love how this segment uses stage techniques for its special effects.

My favorite segment is the third, ""Hoichi The Earless,"" and I suspect that's the case for most viewers.  It has spectacular battle scenes, and the way they're narrated is particularly brilliant.  Hoichi, a blind monk, is a very talented balladeer, and he knows the story of the Dan-no-ura battle from beginning to end.  As he performs this ballad, the scenes are enacted.  The camera alternates from live-action segments (entirely filmed inside the studio, though they're sea battles) to painted panels depicting the battle.  You could consider this the most kick-butt segment of the movie.  But I like it for more oddball reasons.  To me, the ghosts in this segment aren't just shadows of that battle and that ruined clan, they depict a lost age.  The remarkable formality of their lives, the protocol dictating their day-to-day existence, is marvelous and awe-inspiring - and lends credence to Shakespeare's assertion that all the world is a stage.

After that amazing third sequence, the final story, ""In A Cup Of Tea,"" is a bit of a let-down.  I think the purpose of that sort of story in a book is to bring the readers back down to earth and end on a humorous note.  But in the movie, I often find myself running out of patience with it before it's over.  It probably should have been placed at the beginning instead of the end.

Despite that minor flaw, Kwaidan still rises to the top.  It will always be on my list of top ten movies.",1345420800,2,3646,4.671383647798742
530710,4,6302969794,This film is a gem for its time. The stylized sets and acting lend a theatrical feel and mood of the stories. The filming and screenplays are exceptional. Well worth the extra length of the film.,1329868800,2,195,4.444444444444445
530711,5,6302969794,"I've written it before, but will state it again: Nobody can do a Vampire/Ghost story like Asians. Their blending of terrifying images with what can only be described as ""High Art"" is unparalleled. KWAIDAN is a masterpiece of Japanese horror & cinema. I'm not sure if the viewer requires an appreciation of Asian art & story telling to fully appreciate what a gem this film is, but I suspect anyone open to cultural fusion will ""get it.""

The 4 stories in the movie are a great sampler of the Japanese horror genre. Filmed in 1964, I think it is way more interesting than THE GRUDGE today (and I liked THE GRUDGE.) The use of color & abstract sets is stunning. KWAIDAN references to traditional Asian theatre like Noh & Kabuki. There is a scene with a woman who is a Snow Vampire that is absolutely striking in its elemental beauty. Her face is completely dead white, framed by long raven black hair, soft blue spot lighting & her dark, penetrating eyes. She is phantastically gorgeous (they say an Asian woman is the Anima for a Caucasian man & after seeing this woman I can well believe it.) This story was lifted & transplanted in one of the TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE, THE MOVIE (first one I think.) In that rendition the Snow Woman is a gargoyle.

Another story opens with a highly stylized sea battle, pitting one noble Samari family against another. One family is completely wiped out, the wife having drowned herself & daughter when seeing her husband's forces defeated. They have all become ghosts & haunt the cemetery where their ashes are buried, marked by stone monuments. They design to have a blind boy visit them by night because he sings the story of their battle so well. He doesn't realize that they are ghosts. At dawn they fade back into their respective monuments. It's wonderful.

I can definitely recommend purchasing this one--or renting it, of course.",1282435200,,1872,4.683890577507599
530712,5,6302969794,"For those looking for cheap jump scares and gory special effects creatures, steer clear of Kwaidan. You will be as disappointed as you will be confused. Kwaidan is a horror movie in the classic storytelling tradition. The horror is in the atmosphere and in the imagination of the viewer not in the jump cut or special effect. The film is simply gorgeous! It's more like a moving picture scroll than a film. Kwaidan has a dream-like quality that takes you into the realm of the subconscious world of fairy tale.

Kwaidan consists of four short stories.

Black Hair - is about a selfish samurai who abandons his poor wife to get position and a wealthy wife. He grows tired of her and his new life and longs for his old wife. Their reunion is bittersweet and ghoulish.

The Snow Woman - the beginning is just surreal with an imaginative painted backdrop from which the eyes of the snow spirit appear. It feels like stepping into one of those hoary old forests of fairy tales. Yuki Onna is the snow woman who freezes her victims. She represents the beauty and cruelty of winter. In this tale she lets a young woodsman live so long as he never tells his tale of their meeting.

Hoichi the Earless - this is my favorite story! It tells of a blind biwa player who unknowingly plays for the ghosts of a defeated samurai clan. The battle scenes are beautiful and sad. The colors, the imaginary, and the sound of the biwa combine to make this story a masterpiece in every respect. To protect Hoichi from these restless forlorn spirits, he is covered in Buddhist texts from head to toe all save his ears...

In a Tea Cup - this is a strange story that never really gets explained as the viewer will discover at the end. A samurai retainer to quench his thirst drinks from a tea cup from which the image of strange smiling man appears. Later the samurai is visited by this strange samurai and his retainers.

If you like movies and you like good old fashion ghost storytelling then Kwaidan is for you. Just the set pieces alone are worth watching the film for.",1264723200,3,2048,4.491935483870968

530729,5,6302969794,"When one thinks of Japanese horror in the U.S., there seems to be one stereo type that abound to most recent films. Ever wonder how the older, Japanese horror classics played out? Masaki Kobayashi's KWAIDAN (1965) gets the Criterion treatment and rightfully so; the film is a masterpiece in Japanese film-making. Black and White horror films that preceded it such as ""The Innocents"" and ""The Uninvited"" speculates and teases with the premise of the existence of ghosts, ""Kwaidan"", however, meets the spirit world head-on. It is a very effective rendition of terrifying reality. What would happen if the spirit world collided with the Samurai period?

Kwaidan consists of 4 episodes. Loosely based on the writings of Lafcadio Hearn; a folklorist of Greek-Irish ancestry who was naturalized as a Japanese citizen who renamed himself Yakumo Koizumi. Koizumi definitely embraced his adopted culture. If this film is any indication, the source material has no Western influence and definitely feels more geared towards Japanese than anywhere else. Kobayashi's direction takes the definitive style as if the audience is reading a book. The visuals unfurl with a style very similar to Japanese paintings of the historical periods from which the backdrop is set.

Black Hair
A poor ambitious young samurai (Rentaro Mikumi) divorces his beautiful, loving wife (Michiyo Aratama) to marry a wealthy lord's daughter (Michiyo Watanabe) for the promise of social prestige and fortune. Despite his newfound fortune, he discovers that wealth cannot buy you happiness and true love. He happily returns to their dilapidated house after his term had expired to find his ex-wife as beautiful as ever, her black hair as shiny and dark as before. He swears to never leave her side again for all eternity. Unbeknownst to the samurai, the meaning of eternity may prove to be something else...

The Woman of the Snow
A young woodcutter (Tatsuya Nakadai) is lost in a blizzard with his friend, Masaku. They take shelter in an old shack and sleep from exhaustion. When the young woodcutter awakens, he finds a mysterious ghost-like woman (Keiko Kishi) draining the life from his friend by blowing her icy breath into his mouth. Spotting him, the whitish phantom takes pity on him and spares his life, on the condition that he never tells a soul of what he had witnessed.
Years passed and the young woodcutter is happily married to a woman named Yuki. Praised by the village folk of her timeless beauty. He loves his wife so much, that he considers revealing his sinister secret to her...

HOICHI, the EARLESS
The tale centers on a blind musician (Katsuo Nakamura) who lives in a monastery. He specializes in the songs and sonnets about the Heike and Genji clans, whose burial grounds are a mere walking distance from the monastery. So well versed is Hoichi to these songs that it causes the spirits of the clan rise up to listen to his music. Hoichi is willing to do so since he is unaware that his regal audiences are the spirits of the dead clan. The head monk (Takashi Shimura) informs Hoichi that the unquiet ghosts will rip him to pieces if he continues to sing for them. The monks take steps to protect Hoichi from the spirits by writing the Holy scriptures all throughout his entire body.

IN A CUP OF TEA
This is a tale of ""incomplete"" storytelling as a writer discloses the saga of a samurai retainer (Kanemon Nakamura) who sees the reflection of another face within his cup of tea. That evening, that samurai is confronted by the phantom in a duel. The warrior soon learns that he is dealing with something not human. How does this encounter play out?

The film's strengths lie with his excellent storytelling. While it does revolve around the supernatural, it never loses its very human premise; Love and ambition, Trust and betrayal, commitment to an art, human neglect and laziness. The film is quite frightening, but not in the sense of ""in your face horror"" and cheap scares. The viewer must immerse himself to the character's point of view to truly appreciate ""Kwaidan"". I really loved the way it dealt with Japan's cultural, social and even political views at a certain period. The film's proceedings may feel like a ""stage performance"" at times but it never loses its sheer frightening aspect. Kobayashi has achieved something spectacular; from the film's elaborate costumes and set designs, the director certainly has made one successful (if subtle) blend of realism and stylization. He has definitely cemented the idea that beauty and sheer horror can coexist on one medium, and effectively complement each other with coherence.

Highly Recommended! [5 Stars]

Criterion sports a very impressive transfer in a 2.35 ratio Anamorphic Widescreen. Minor print damage is visible on some scenes but the color is radiant and the picture is sharp. Excellent subtitles with the original monaural Japanese track is used.",1204156800,6,4903,4.99265605875153
530730,5,6302969794,"While the film is superb to most viewers, a person with knowledge of the Japanese traditional performing arts would enjoy an even greater appreciation of it.  I was astonished to see how skillfully the centuries-old theatrical and musical forms of Bunraku/Gagaku, Noh, Kabuki, and Bunraku were integrated into this production.  Please let me share those with you.

As a graduate student and research assistant in the Asian traditional performing arts at the Univ. of Hawaii, which has a superb program in this field, I learned a fair amount about these arts over a two-year period.  Many touring Japanese troupes gave performances at UH on their way from Japan to other international performance sites.  We saw top-notch Japanese productions.  The department also prepared and produced several Asian theater performances, including a version of the Hoichi story, brilliantly written into a script by Prof. James Brandon, a well-noted Western scholar in the field.

Again and again, while my husband and I watched the film, I noticed elements of the four classic theatrical forms of Japan, as well as reflections of the literature and visual arts.

There were moments when the music was purely Gagaku, a very ancient style that accompanied Bugaku dance, and one that is alarming to Western ears.  In one scene, there was actually a Bugaku stage on the set.  But people wouldn't know this without some background or research.

Some of the women's facial makeup--the high foreheads, elevated eyebrows, and black-pigmented teeth--come straight from Noh drama and the early Japanese court styles that Noh reflected.

The brilliantly colorful, wide, shallow-in-depth sets are from Bunraku, a Japanese puppet drama in which it takes as many as three puppeteers to manipulate one large puppet together.  The colorful, deeper sets reflect Kabuki, a very dynamic dramatic form that was performed primarily for the masses while the older, highly stylized Noh drama was still favored by the imperial court.

In one story on the film, the white kimono of the ghost is a direct imitation of a kimono style worn by Noh actors portraying women.  Women weren't allowed to act on the stage for many centuries.

The sudden lengthening of the hair and wild aspect of a man in one of the stories come from both Noh and Kabuki and reminds me of the Kabuki play ""St. Narukami and the Great God Fudo.""

The phenomenally dramatic narration and chanting are from both Bunraku and Noh, in both of which the chanter/s tell the story from the side of the stage, accompanied by musicians who play the shamisen and other instruments.  The chanters use variations in their vocal techniques to deliver dialogue from all of the characters.  It's an extremely demanding art, and is awe-inspiring to hear, even more so in person.

Many viewers will be impressed by the drumming in the soundtrack.  Among the most complicated drumming cultures of the world (including India, Africa, and Indonesia), Japanese drumming is especially evocative and deeply appealing.  Fortunately, the traveling Japanese troupe known as the ""Kodo Drummers"" often goes on tour in the US.  They perform on taiko drums, and there are many amateur taiko groups in the US.  I recommend the CD ""The Best of Kodo"" as an introduction to this art form.

It is my pleasure to own a hira-daiko taiko drum.  It hangs on an enormous stand in our kitchen, and has drum heads that are 44"" in diameter.  To play a drum like that, especially in time to a recording, is a marvelous experience.  For those of you who enjoyed the recent popular US film ""The Last Samurai,"" please listen to the music at the beginning of the final battle scene.  The drumming draws the emotions forward powerfully in the viewers.  Those are taiko drums.  Percussion has always been intrinsically appealing to humans.

I hope that this information will give you a deeper enjoyment of the film.  So much of what we enjoy depends upon our cultural background.  Aesthetics vary broadly from culture to culture.  As we learn more, we enjoy more.  I wish you well.",1194048000,4,4062,4.974777448071217
530731,4,6302969794,"Director Masaki Kobayashi created an impressive quartet of short films based on the ghost stories of Lafcadio Hearn.  Perhaps it is misleading to call this a horror film, because that may cause many people to expect a more aggressively upsetting experience than Kobayashi intends.  These are quiet stories about people who encounter the spirit world.  The intent is to maintain a consistently eerie mood rather than to make the viewer jump out of his seat, and it succeeds at this very well.  Kobayashi does not try to conceal the fact that it was filmed entirely on sound stages.  Rather, he exploits that fact to produce many astonishing, beautiful images.

My only problem with the film is that the archetypal nature of the stories makes it easy to guess their resolutions, so I sometimes became a little impatient with the deliberate pacing.",1193529600,3,845,4.957446808510638
530732,5,6302969794,"Kwaidan is a beautiful looking film with lavish colorful sets, dreamlike images, and great atmosphere.  The director Masaki Kobayashi drew on his own training as a student of painting and other fine arts.  I also like his patient movie making style, Kobayashi takes his time and let's his viewers experience the film and feel a bit of what the characters are going through.  We as viewers also get to soak up this film in all of it's beauty.  Some viewers that are looking for explosions and things to jump at you maybe disappointed, this is the type of film that seeps into your subconscious, you experience a film like this almost as if it becomes one of your memories.  However for those who do not like subtitles this film isn't bad, basically pay close attention at the beginning of each tale then there is very little dialogue.  The score is also very unsettling, eerie and effective.  David Ehrenstein a film critic for 30 years wrote a in depth synopsis in the dvd jacket and states, ""while classic black and white chillers as the Uninvited, The Innocents, and The Haunting teasingly speculate on the existence of ghosts, this lavish wide screen and color production deals with the spirit world head-on, as something completely and frighteningly real.""

There are four separate stories in Kwaidan.  With 58 in depth insightful reviews (at the time I'm writing this) for Kwaidan here on Amazon, and with Amazon itself providing a thorough review, there is no need repeating what has already been said.
I will say these four stories are very deep and could be taken and analyzed in many different ways.  I also noticed perhaps films that were influenced by some of Kwaidan's eerie scenes such as ""The Black Hair"" in flims such as Ringu and Ju-on.
Criterion as always does an amazing job on their dvds, however there was little special features, for a Criterion dvd there isn't much besides the original theatrical trailer.  With that said the transfer looked amazing and the colors pop off the screen, some Criterion dvds are the closest in video quality to an actual hd image, even better in some cases with such pristine transfers.
Kwaidan is a must for any film lover.  More specifically fans of ghosts and supernatural horror such as The Haunting, The Innocents, and The Twilight zone series who want to see something unique, something that is scary and eerie and believes itself and it's material without having to shock you with exploding heads.

To call it a horror film somewhat diminishes the work because the films is so rich, both visually and thematically, that it shouldn't be pidgeonholed in any category.  It's an anthology film with 4 stories, The Black Hair, Woman in the Snow, Hoichi the Earless, and In a Cup of Tea.  The stories all unfold quietly and deliberately, building a beautiful tension and sense of place.  This is the type of ""horror"" film I really like, one that is moody, that draws you in quietly and leaves you haunted and uneasy after you leave the theater (in other words, not the typical gory, violent garbage peddled by current day filmmakers).  My favorite is Hoichi the Earless.  It is rather gruesome (as you will soon discover).  But I also like The Black Hair, which is a rather moving story in addition to being frightening.  The art direction, photography, and direction are truly stunning.  This films HAS to be seen in widescreen.  I initially saw it in a really bad VHS transfer from a company called Video Yesteryear.

530766,5,6302969794,"This wonderful cinematic masterpiece is highly recommended. Kwaidan centers on four visually beautiful and hauntingly stunning stories of the supernatural. The visual effects of Kwaidan alone are remarkable, especially considering that this great film was released in 1964. CRITERION has done an excellent job [as usual] with the transfer. I like all of the episodes in Kwaidan, however, my favorite is ""Hoichi the Earless."" It is the tale of a blind musician monk who sings ballads to ghosts. Unfortunately for the monk, each time he plays and recounts the epic battles before these ghosts he becomes weaker. The other monks try to rid the blind monk of these spirits, including a senior monk played by the great, and legendary actor Takashi Shimura.

The monks write a holy mantra over the blind monks body in order to protect him from the ghosts he plays for each night. This is done to make the blind monk invisible to the ghost of the samurai warrior who visits him each night and calls him forth to play for the other ghosts. However, the monks forget to write the mantra on his ears. When the ghost arrives, all he sees are the monks ears. I will leave the rest of the story for you viewers to watch. A truly great episode. Another great episode is the one titled, ""In A Cup Of Tea."" You viewers will be pleasantly surprised by these great stories brought to the screen by one of my favorite directors, Masaki Kobayashi. The same director who brought the world the great films ""Harakiri"" and ""Samurai Rebellion.""

One of the things you will notice in these four incredible tales of the supernatural, directed by Kobayashi, is the incredible colors in the film. Moreover, Kobayashi also gives the viewer ghost stories which are extremely creepy, and filled with the nuance of terror which I still find creepy and eerie every time I view this beautiful masterpiece. Further, the cinematography is just incredible. I saw this film for the first time in 1968, and this film has never lost its appeal for me. It is highly recommended. The first story in the film deals with a masterless samurai [Ronin] who leaves his wife. I once thought that this was one of the weaker stories, I have since come to find it one of the eeriest of all the tales in KWAIDAN. This is a highly, highly recommended classic.

530769,5,6302969794,"If nothing else, ""Kwaidan"" can at least be called imaginative. It was the most expensive Japanese film in existance when it premiered at Cannes and took away the Grand Jury's Prize in 1964 and Kobayashi's first color film.  He used this to his full advantage. There is no wasted frame, no color taken for granted here. This is an atmospheric dreamworld vision of a folk-tale Japan where night skies are a moody purple with bright gleaming stars or a classic black drear, snow sparkles beneath it in majestic rolls, and water is either dead-still or crashing epically on the rocks.  This is to legendary folklore Japan what Tim Burton is to small, misty towns surrounded by woods. The characters are conficting with spirits and souls of the dead as well as their own. Each story deals with a person who has become involved with ghosts in some way, shape, or form. Of course, this does have a kind of unrealistic beauty in coexistance with what is supposed to be horror, but the horror seems a bit dated and almost devoured by the beauty rather than enhanced.  Now I've never been taken in by cheap slasher movies, but this film makes me wonder if I have been spoiled somewhat by something, because while these stories are classic Japan, the endings often have the common predictable twists of American campfire stories. Don't count on a tie-up that'll make you jump or even wince. If anything, these stories might add an air of creepiness to the room. That's not really what makes this film memorable though. The Criterion Collection made an incredible transfer with not so incredible special features.

1- The typical Asain superstition

and
2- The more than enthyusiastic and amazing stories of the samurais.

There is surely little I can add to what's already been said here about this film. So maybe what I have to say boils down to a YES vote for the pacing, atmosphere and story content of Kwaidan. But I will venture a few comments.
Unlike some other reviewers, I don't consider the first two tales, Woman of the Snow and The Black Hair-- nor the last tale, In a Cup of Tea-- negligible. Your pulse and breathing slows, the pitch of your senses drops an octave and even time seems to step off its treadmill to oblivion as you enter into the warp and weft of Kwaidan through The Black Hair. Over all, the director showed great ingenuity in the way he 'shot around' moments that could have been sunk by the formative level of special effects at that time. (How many films of this vintage are ruined for modern viewers by the universal presence of the veritable zipper in the back of the monster suit? Nearly all. This film avoids that pitfall, and yet still manages to give you something awesome to look at. --In other words, the director didn't just lazily avert his camera's gaze, as low budget horror films of the time often do, and fall back on what became an abused old saw that ""the audience can always supply stronger horrors in their mind than I could for them."" The director gives us plenty to look at and remember visually later.)
Woman of the Snow develops a poignant relationship between a wife-- who is not what she appears-- and her husband. Their story is sweet. You hope they prosper as a family, while you fear otherwise. A tone that is basically domestic and anti-horrific is set.  When the serenity of their lives is climactically shattered, it is doubly hard to watch. You feel pity and sorrow for the man, and even for the monster, more than horror. There is no gore. A beautiful way of life is dissolved forever by a careless word, a moment of candor with a loved one that prompts unforeseeable consequences. That is real horror.
Hoichi is probably the standout story, if only because it is given the full space in time for which storytelling at this sort of pace begs. The visual effects in those scenes involving Hoichi's visits to the dead are handled with incredible deftness. They are the best this pre-cgi, pre-morph technology era could have hoped to achieve and they still stand up amazingly. I fairly gasped when I saw these scenes.(The most beautiful use of what are essentially dissolves I have seen.) This segment makes some of the best use of silence and near silence also. As the ghost assaults Hoichi, there are sparse, muted musique concrete plocks and bings on the soundtrack. The effect is suffocating. No flurry of Wagnerian sturm und drang could have worked as well for this rending scene.
After the breadth and luxury of the Hoichi segment, In a Cup of Tea may seem a little abrupt. This is not a bad thing. Hoichi was allowed enough latitude that they even managed some rare comic relief there. A Cup of Tea is a tart, terse afterword of a segment. It's like an episode of the half hour Alfred Hitchcock Presents in that it explodes the surprise at the very end, then exits with no comment at all. This is perfectly in keeping with Hearn's source stories or a John Collier or W.W. Jacobs short story. --Anything written in the form after Poe, really. Everything builds toward the final effect.
If you haven't seen Kwaidan, I recommend it. You need a grey day, first of all, or a night to view it. You need to banish all your irreverant, overly-ironic friends who might surprise you and 'get it', but as likely won't. And you have to want to like it. If all these conditions are in place, I can almost guarantee you'll be very glad you invested the time in the film.",1056758400,41,3905,4.539007092198582

Composed of four unrelated chapters, ""Kwaidan"" clearly finds it's roots in traditional Japanese theater.  Rather than cinematic, the stories are theatrical.  The pace is slow, patient and haunting.  Stage lighting and costumes are used, although the camera work is film like.  It is not a filmed stage play, but instead has elements of both film and stage.
Some familiarity with Japanese folklore and history would be helpful when viewing ""Kwaidan.""  The third story, ""Hoichi the Earless,"" deals with the battle of the Genji and Heike clans which is familiar to any Japanese person.

But if you can allow yourself to fall into the eerie visuals and sound, the pacing winds up making the film that much more haunting when it finally does become scary.  The stories are very simple but dark parables.  One of the keys to the film's quality, in addition to the beautiful visuals, is the music/sound by Toru Takemitsu.  He often incorporates sounds into the music, for example, breaking wood or a creaking spindle, to a fabulously creepy affect.  At other times he replaces sounds with a musical representation of the sound like the ""sounds"" of the storm in the ""Hoichi the Earless"" segment.  Takemitsu was such an assett to every film maker he worked with.  Kobayashi is a terrific film maker... ""Harakiri"" and ""Samurai Rebellion"" are also must sees.  ""Kwaidan"" is very different from those films, but then again, it's also very different from every other film ever made.  It's a totally unique work of pure art.",994636800,4,1032,4.8125

It does.  However, this is not the ""scare you out of your mind"" type ghost story.  Instead, these are the most artistically rendered ghost stories that you could possibly imagine. The cinematographer and director work with a harmony rarely seen in film so they can deliver a surreal tour de force to your home entertainment center.  Although this was made in the 1960s, it holds up to any time period and will not strike you as the least bit dated.  We cannot say that of many films made in the '60s, alas.  Even if you are not an artist, it is hard for me to imagine anyone not being taken by this film, which I consider flawless in every regard.

530842,5,6302969794,"With his ""Kwaidan"" score, Toru Takemitsu created the most remarkable work of art by using sound as music and music as sound. The line between the two is as blurred as the film form would allow it, in 1964 or nowadays. True to the Japanese tradition, his sound is minimal and well measured. It is executed with great taste and utmost precision but retains all of its natural qualities. It is probably the most effective score that I've ever heard. The only question for me is whether this can even be called 'a score': it certainly deserves a new word to be coined for it. In fact, I do remember noticing unusual opening credit for it but I can't remember the exact words that were used.
If you were moved by the flow of his notes in ""Woman in the Dunes"" or were intrigued with Masaru Sato's amazing score for ""Yojimbo"", this will take you to a completely new level of listening. It's an absolute aural masterpiece from this high master of film music!
Of course, this is only my opinion but I usually listen to movies more carefully than I watch them. You'll just have to trust my ears and their taste on this one.",984873600,9,1113,4.407766990291262
530843,4,6302969794,"The best work of director Masaki Kobayashi is within calling distance of the achievements of other Japanese masters like Kurosawa and Mizoguchi. Perhaps inevitably uneven, given that it consists of four stories, KWAIDAN's best moments combine a graphic sense of composition, lush, dense colors, a tactile response to materials, and a tart, poetic use of sound. All, despite the occasional ragged shot, are served admirably by Criterion's transfer.
Watching KWAIDAN is a lot like sitting down to a full meal. The first course, ""The Black Hair,"" is a fairly bland and predictable salad, spiced with some extraordinary filmmaking. (The sound of the second wife's kimono gliding over the wooden floors hauntingly condenses her character to a single, silky detail, for example.) It isn't bad, just mildly disappointing, leaving us hungry for more.
""The Woman in the Snow"" would be a perfectly realized appetizer, except that with its powdered sugar snow, painted sunsets and theatrical lighting effects, it looks more like dessert. The sweet taste is a trick, however, a way of disarming us so that when the horror arrives, its raw simplicity is deeply frightening.
""Hoichi the Earless,"" the main course, is simply stunning, executed at a virtually indescribable level of formal control. There are no fewer than *five* layers of representation in the segment. The relatively Realistic framing story of Hoichi seamlessly slides into dreams and fantasy in which mists and shadows creep around characters posed as motionless, hieratic masses. A legendary battle between the Genji and Heike clans is staged in Kabuki-like bright colors, broad gestures and theatrical backdrops, intercut with a painting of the battle, while the soundtrack provides a *third* description through both a musical recounting and a narration of the story. ""Hoichi"" has the pictorial extravagance of RAN's battle scenes, but where Kurosawa paints his canvas with broad, epic strokes, Kobayashi abstracts the action into a few, highly compressed gestures. The segment is marred only by some low-comedy scenes which fortunately are brief enough not to get in the way.
The film concludes with ""In a Cup of Tea,"" the most original as a story and, with its subdued colors, traditional editing and focus on the actors instead of the decor, the most Naturalistic as filmmaking. ""Tea"" combines a kind of Borgesian menace with an understated, knowing sense of humor. This is the real dessert, pleasant, surprising, occasinally funny but also, in its very last shot, an astringent reminder of what has come before. It is a suitably satisfying conclusion to a filling meal.",975369600,6,2630,5.279236276849642
530844,2,6302969794,"I first saw this film in college in 1970.  I had remembered only the first of the 4 stories, and the third, ""Hoichi the Earless"", which my freshman roommate and I thought was a hilarious title.  I had no idea what the collection was called, and had not seen the film since it finally came out on DVD.  I rediscovered in a roundabout way: I had visited Matsue and became very interested in the life and works of Lafcadio Hearn after visiting his home there.
The movie is somewhat reminiscent of a kabuki performance in that is slow and boring, with a beautiful visuals.  It is interesting to me that after thirty years, I had absolutely no recollection of the second and fourth parts stories in this film.  This time, I liked the fourth story the most, because the sets reminded me of places I had visited in Western Honshu (Matsue, Himeji, Hagi for example).
The DVD reproduces the original color of the film beautifully but adds absolutely nothing to the film in terms of bonus material except the original Japanese trailer and the fact that you can turn subtitles off.  The subtitles are somewhat distracting and since the stories have practically no plot whatsoever I might have enjoyed Kwaidan more without them.  If you are the sort of person who enjoys watching 8 hours of Noh drama sitting on your knees, you should buy this DVD.",971740800,9,1336,4.6118143459915615
530845,5,6302969794,"Wow! What a gorgeous film this is!  Kwaidan is quite possibly the most beautiful scary movie you will ever see.  The cinematography in Kwaidan is superb, and the film has an epic feel to it, rather unusual for a horror film.  In fact, I would even call this film the ""2001"" of horror movies, and I imagine that if Stanley Kubrick had gotten around to directing a Japanese-style horror movie, it would look a lot like this film.
Kwaidan was made in the mid-1960s, and at the time, it was the most expensive Japanese film ever made.  It was a big success at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Special Jury Prize.  The film is a collection of four ghost stories, told with a decidedly Japanese flair.  The first story is about a man who abandons his wife only to return years later.  The second story is about a man's encounter with a snow vampiress.  The third story, my favorite, is about a monk who gives nocturnal recitals for mysterious and ghostly hosts.  The last story is about a man who drinks down a ghost.  That's all you really need to know, as the stories are quite straight-forward.  It is the manner in which they are told and photographed that makes them so powerful.
The pacing is very deliberate and slow but gives you plenty of time to appreciate the numerous beautiful images that appear on-screen.  The director, Kobayashi, filmed Kwaidan in a very surrealistic fashion, and the entire soundtrack was post-dubbed.  As such, the sound effects come and go in very unexpected ways, like nervous twitches.  This lends a further eerie atmosphere to the film.
The DVD is by Criterion, so you can expect a great transfer.  And the transfer is absolutely stunning!  Just look at the trailer (included on the DVD) and compare with the quality of the film itself, and you will be amazed.  The picture is crystal clear with bright colors and deep black (the many night scenes look great, not muddy at all).  There are no pixelations or artifacts and barely a trace here or there of scratch marks that belie the film's age.  Sound is monophonic.  Too bad Criterion didn't include a commentary track, but I suppose with an almost 3-hour film, there wasn't much room left on the DVD for anything else.
Still, if you like eerie ghost movies like The Innocents or The Haunting (original B/W version) or The Changeling, you will really appreciate this film.  Kwaidan is not horrifying or scary in a ""Halloween"" or ""Scream"" manner; rather it creates an uneasy sensation of dread and despair.
