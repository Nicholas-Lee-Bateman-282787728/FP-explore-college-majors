8652227,5,B00005KHJD,I loved it!!  The Hunters continue their mission to rid the Spooner Continent of all evil sorcerers.  Carrot is back to chasing every girl in sight and Tira and Chocolate are still beating him back in line.  In episode 8 you get a glimpse of a dark secret all the Hunters have had wiped from their memories.  You get a sense of the coming battle with Zaha Torte who you will meet for the first time in episode 12.  You begin to see more depth in each of the Hunters personalities as the plot develops.  In episode 13 Between Dreams & Reality you see Each Hunter's deepest fantasy.  Carrot's is a no brainer.  I was really looking forward to the second volume and wasn't disappointed!,996192000,3,683,4.408
