2635922,5,B000HEVTKE,"If you liked the original Avengers, you'll like this one.  Steed is still there, plus Purdy and Gambit to help fight crime.",1392595200,,123,4.590909090909091
2635923,3,B000HEVTKE,"During the shooting of the last season of The New Avengers, Patrick McNee ran into Peter O'Toole, who asked him what he was doing. ""I'm doing The New Avengers"" ""Patrick, you're always doing The Avengers."" Each episode beginning with a pre-title cliffhanger and a strident martial variation of his original theme music by uncredited co-producer Laurie Johnson, the show itself is nowhere near as bad as its reputation - the trouble is, it's nowhere near as good as the original series, even in its Tara King days. What's missing most of all is not just the straight-faced whimsy and the innocent kinkiness but the playful banter between Steed and his female partner, be it Cathy Gale, Tara King or Emma Peel. Indeed, rather than a double act, he cuts a more paternal (or should that be Maternal?) figure with two young pretenders handling the fighting and the banter in the form of Joanna Lumley's Purdey and Gareth Hunt's Gambit, (probably British television's first working class Jewish action hero).

The plots are generally a little more grounded in the first season, which translates as more ordinary, with the unnamed foreign power now openly Russia this time round and the violence somewhat more serious - fewer blas reactions to exotically murdered corpses this time round - even if the fight choreography was a lot less impressive. Steed even found himself picking up a gun in a couple of episodes in the second season despite McNee's well-known intense aversion to them. Nor is the series especially nostalgic: it may have launched with a plot to revive Hitler from cryogenic suspended animation in a Scottish castle run by monks, but many of the plots revolve around schemes hatched at the height of the Cold War that the classic episodes treated so frivolously finally coming home to roost or around characters from the past obsessing over old grievances presumably incurred around the time of the show's glory days coming back to haunt the main characters. Rather than fending off the threat of reality or consequences with witty banter, Steed occasionally cuts a more serious, sombre figure, not quite taking everything cheerfully in his stride and not necessarily meaning it when he does. Despite the distinctive dress sense and the steel bowler, there's the distinct feeling that the producers have decided it was high time he had finally grown up, even if only a little.

As if to underline the more serious approach, the show's original leading man Ian Hendry turns up in as a guest star in one episode in a quite different role, and a rather unfortunately autobiographical one at that as a down-and-out alcoholic former spy trying to get back into the game and failing miserably. Sadly, with all but one of the first season's episodes lost, this now stands as 50% of Henry's surviving legacy in the series his one-time sidekick inherited and made his own.

Taken as an Avengers series, the first season isn't flattered by the comparison, though as a 70s action thriller series it's more than passable fare. Things went wrong with the visibly underfunded second season. By then the show seemed to be reverting to its roots in the worst way, becoming a rather tired, run of the mill spy series at times. With producers Albert Fennell and Brian Clemens busily developing what would become The Professionals, the series almost turns into a blueprint for that, with Steed assuming the Gordon Jackson role and Purdey and Gambit the Martin Shaw and Lewis Collins roles (indeed, Collins and Shaw actually co-star in one episode, Obsession). Gambit had given up his attempts to get Purdey into bed and resigned himself to being more comic relief than action man. The writing is often lazy, relying on huge suspension of disbelief to overlook gaping plot holes like security men not bothering to check bell towers when looking for an assassin or McNee and co taking a car with a vital palm print by the most roundabout route to a police station to give the bad guys ample opportunities to destroy it.

It's also the one where the co-producers started demanding their pound of flesh, with three episodes being shot in France (though the French co-producers only came up with the money for two) and the last four being shot on the cheap in Canada under the title The New Avengers in Canada. The most reviled of the series, these at least did show a return to the odd moment of surrealism, with Complex offering a fully-automated building that doubles as an assassin (an idea it sadly makes little of and which Philip Kerr lifted for his novel Gridiron) and Forward Base delighting in a corner of Lake Ontario that dries up and floods in the blink of an eye.

Still, even that season had its moments - Dead Men Are Dangerous sees Steed targeted by Clive Revill's terminally ill old school friend who always came second to you-know-who in every sporting and spying endeavour, and it deserves points for cheek for using a bit of stock footage from The Winged Avenger and A Touch of Venus to add Emma Peel to the beginning of another episode, K is For Kill.",1232755200,17,5059,4.823732718894009
2635924,5,B000HEVTKE,"Once again, an offer comes by (like the Persuaders) to get a complete series but is NOT a Mega Set.  All this is both halves of the short lived Avengers revival being sold together in 1 order.  Nothing is different physically (in other words this is not 1 combined 8 pack of thinner cases, it is the same as ordering both sets of separately).  The only difference may be the price and the shipping charge (for those of you who don't follow my example and choose super saver shipping all the time that is ;-)).  My advice, get them the best way you can (price wise).  If this turns out as a mega set someday of all 8 discs as the Emma Peel Avengers episodes, Nero Wolfe and other A&E manufactured sets did, that is another story.",1206748800,4,728,4.2846715328467155
8139132,4,B000HEVTKE,"This is a very good reboot, about 7 years after the original Avengers series with most of the original production team intact.
Writers, Directors and supporting actors/guest stars are very familiar.
New participants such as Deep Roy add authentic character to their performances. The episode Target! is Roy's auspicious debut, followed by Doctor Who's The Talons Of Weng-Chiang.
Impressive talent.
There is more emphasis on action, violence and sexuality with this series. Reminds me of the Honor Blackman (Cathy Gale) era, but the New Avengers are more intense.

There are some very worthwhile episodes here, all are interesting others are surreal and rather bizarre.

This release is sourced from high quality prints and is well mastered but not restored obviously. A little disappointing and surprising, most Optimum Studio/Canal offerings are digitally restored now.
This being said audiovisual quality is as good as can be expected, it just depends on the overall condition of the prints used. Some are more scratched & blemished than others and colors are off occasionally, I would say video quality is about 8/10.
These discs upscale very well with a multi region 4K Bluray player & 4K TV, no serious pixelation noted but video quality is much less impressive than the restored original Avengers releases.

This is a decent classic series, a relevant chapter in the history of The Avengers and Patrick Macnee.
It deserves to be restored!

Macnee's participation is more involved than I expected but his younger associates are charged with physically sorting things out.

Still fun, still The Avengers, just a different era along with some new faces.

Please note this is a Region 2 DVD release, it will not play in a restricted Region 1 & A player but I assume it is Xbox and Play Station compatible.

4 Stars overall, if restored I would rate 5 definitely.

Essential for Avengers fans!",1522713600,,1894,5.087096774193548
8139133,5,B000HEVTKE,"I liked this series much better today than when it first appeared on TV.  Joanna Lumley is gorgeous and incredibly athletic.  She would have made a good partner for Steed in the original series.  A few episodes are stinkers, notably the ones made in Canada, but most are pretty good.  A few episodes have commentaries by Gareth Hunt and Brian Clemens, but that's it in the way of extras.  Also, the discs are not SDH subtitled.  And one last word of warning: the discs are Region 2.  If you live in North America and don't know what that means, don't buy the set.",1497484800,,563,4.407766990291262
8139134,5,B000HEVTKE,"This seller is great! Item was shipped from U.K. to New Jersey the day after the order was placed. It arrived at my door 13 days before Amazon estimated arrival time. The disc set was brand new in plastic wrap. The content was in great condition. I only watched 10 minutes of the first disc so far but don't foresee any problems. As advertised, the DVD has a different regional code, so, to watch them, you will need a multi-region DVD player or like what i did, just play on the computer.",1490832000,,489,4.326086956521739

8139140,3,B000HEVTKE,"This series, a successor to the well-known Avengers series of the 1960s, ran for two seasons in 1976-77.  There were some changes in the format, but the premise was similar.  With lead actor Patrick MacNee now in his fifties, his role was upgraded to that of the senior spymaster, who mentors two members of the younger generation.  The new roles were played by the lovely and talented Joanna Lumley and the ruggedly masculine Gareth Hunt.  As with the earlier series, the plots were a blend of complex intrigues and lighthearted adventure.  The scriptwriting was intermittent, with some fine episodes, some that were passable, and a few that fell completely flat.  Still, on balance, this series was quite enjoyable  it always had a discrete, distinctively British charm.",1426809600,,772,5.079365079365079
8139141,3,B000HEVTKE,"The action scenes with Purdey and Gambit were good at times, Steed hardly got into any of the action in this series, in which I believe was the downfall to this series.  Plus, he's not driving that Green Rose Royce vehicle that he had in the original Avengers.  Plus, it didn't quite have that tongue-n-cheek format like in the original Avengers.  Steed's wardrobe was still in his browler hat and umbrella made it worth while somewhat to watch the show, but he was rarely in action on this series.  Overall, it was ok, but could never stand up the original Avengers series.",1424736000,2,574,4.598039215686274
