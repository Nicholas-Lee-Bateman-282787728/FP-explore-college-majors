There are four of these, Castle Ghosts of England, Castle Ghosts of Scotland,Castle Ghosts of Ireland and one I have yet to see, Castle Ghosts of Wales. They are extremely well-made and narrated by a wonderful actor Robert Hardy. With so many sub-standard ghost-themed productions out there, it is mind-boggling why this hasn't been released on DVD. They are really good.",1236556800,2,476,4.888888888888889
