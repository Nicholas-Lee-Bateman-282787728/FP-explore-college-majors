8071792,5,B000A0UIC0,"I have a family history so I've done a fair bit of research on my own prior to viewing this dvd.  I was a little jealous that I'd put so much of my own hours into researching when it was all consolodated in this easy to understand dvd.  This information is from many different journals of health and cancer studies and it's the most varied but concise version of advice that is up to date on the war on breast cancer.  I highly recommend this video.  My only critisms are that he's speaking most of the time, so if there is something that's not understood, there's not a power point or anything ""written"" on many things mentioned so you can do further research unless you're already familiar with the term he's using.  And, it's just him in front of a small group of women speaking so it may not hold your attention.  If that's the case, I'd recommend taking it in a little at a time.",1240185600,,884,4.295180722891566
8071793,5,B000A0UIC0,"I have a number of breast cancer risk factors including family history, and as a result have been staying ""abreast"" of the scientific literature on breast cancer prevention for many years.  I was therefore extremely impressed that in this DVD Dr. Conley managed to come up with several important studies that were new to me, and also that his explanations were very helpful at clarifying information that I already had.  While many of the ""secrets"" he discussed are hardly secret (alcohol consumption and antibiotics increase risk; lutein, lycopene, carotene, folic acid, and Vitamin E from food sources decrease risk), Dr. Conley does provide more in-depth discussion of why these factors may be important.  I have a pretty strong BS detector and am very skeptical of snake oil type pitches, but I can honestly say that I feel confident Dr. Conley's advice is well-founded.  For one thing, at the beginning of each section he generally cites the major peer-reviewed medical journal article on which he is relying.  And, having perused so much of this literature for many years, I found much of what he said consistent with information I had gathered independently.  This is not to say that I take everything he says as gospel -- most of these areas remain controversial.  But the good thing is that most of his advice can be followed through simple and healthy dietary changes that, even if they proved ineffective for preventing breast cancer, would at worse be harmless and in most cases would strongly promote overall health.  So, we have absolutely nothing to lose by following this advice, and a great deal, potentially to gain.  I say, thank you Dr. Conley for putting together this valuable lecture!",1199491200,,1707,4.982394366197183
