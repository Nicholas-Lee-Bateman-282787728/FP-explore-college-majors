8574136,5,B002WIOKGI,"Try This At Home is an outstanding tribute to juggling for the novice.  It breaks down, in very simple steps and helps the user build the skills necessary to juggle two or more objects.  This would be a perfect present for an active 12+ to teenager or anyone who is open to building their fine (and large) motor skills!  The video production is outstanding and we felt it was a pleasure to watch and participate.  Kudos!  Good work!",1259625600,9,432,4.487179487179487
