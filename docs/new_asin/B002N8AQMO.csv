8374854,1,B002N8AQMO,"This movie is linked to the wrong Honey. I wanted to watch the 2003 Honey with Jessica Alba, which is what I selected. But when i purchased it, this crappy movie came on instead. Be careful",1421366400,,189,4.277777777777778

8374856,5,B002N8AQMO,"Watching Honey is a thinking person's film - definitely not a bubble-gum movie. The movie follows two NY couples as they navigate or rather ""avoid"" the realities of their relationships.  The movie opens with one couple engaged in a role-playing scenario - through frequent role-playing ""trysts"" the couple manages to have some-what honest conversations. The other couple deals with their dysfunctional relationship through passive-aggressive behavior and conversation.  Without using obvious cliched conversation or music or characters, Honey conveys all the complexities of the inter-relationships through great acting, awkward pauses, silent flashbacks, and close-ups.  Watching Honey, you realize that you don't need all the usual Hollywood handholding to convey richness of characters or plot.

A great movie that is both thought and discussion provoking.",1259971200,,859,5.959349593495935
8374857,5,B002N8AQMO,"This film isn't ""about"" anything. It's about everything. David Ball's script deals primarily with 2 couples whose relationships are teetering on the brink of...destruction, reconciliation, oblivion, harmony, anything really, it all depends on which moment you are watching. These are character's who react according to their own mysterious internal logic the way we do in real life. They don't react according to the contrived ""beats"" of a hollywood script but rather to each others actions and words. Ball has not copied Cassavetes as much as he has internalized the master's ability to create art through surface yearnings and tics. We get to know these people through their inscrutable actions rather than through cliched ""point of view"" visual narration. You know, the way most Hollywood films let you know EXACTLY what a character is feeling either through having them tell us without any sign that the filmmaker doubts their words, or through visual shorthand like lingering close-ups, powerful tracking shots and swelling, emotional music. Honey has none of that. You will feel as though you are as unsure of what is going on in the room as the characters are and that is not because it's sloppy but rather because the film is alive the way we are alive.
There is sadness here but it isn't the cynical, easy sadness of a Revolutionary Road. Honey is sad, funny, bitter, hopeful and much more but it does the film a disservice to break it down into any list of qualities. The film is not a series of parts but a living breathing whole that wraps itself around you and doesn't let go go until you cry ""thank you,"" then it ends and it continues to hold you.
See this film now",1252886400,4,1679,4.813148788927336
