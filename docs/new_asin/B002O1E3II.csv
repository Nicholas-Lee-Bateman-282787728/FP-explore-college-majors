8375816,1,B002O1E3II,Should have been new! First time use skipped over damaged part! So you miss part of the movie. Movie not true to history of hart kidnapping and San Jose hanging!,1460332800,,161,4.4

8375818,3,B002O1E3II,"Based on a true story from 1933 in San Jose, California, this film closely follows the book, SWIFT JUSTICE by Harry Farrell.  I have to say the book is better than the movie, but true crime buffs will enjoy this tale of Prohibition-era mob violence.  The film is a bit rambling, and has more emphasis on local politics than the actual events which occurred.  Acting is mediocre.",1430092800,,378,4.611940298507463
8375819,5,B002O1E3II,I choose this because it is a local city story.  Very good.  In good shape and good quality.  Received it promptly.,1393200000,2,115,4.380952380952381
8375820,3,B002O1E3II,"This movie is certainly historically significant, so I am glad that I watched it. The acting was not the best, though. That could be the responsibility of the director, because there were actors in this film who I have seen do better work. Hard to say, as a non-industry person, but I'd say rent it if you are interested in the story, in California history, or in the history of mob violence.",1370390400,5,392,4.458333333333333
8375821,1,B002O1E3II,This is just a so so movie and I should not have wasted my money buying it!,1279584000,2,75,3.4705882352941178
