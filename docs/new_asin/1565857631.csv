I have learned details on early US history I didn't know and refeshed information I have long forgotten.  The lectures are 1/2 hour each, which isn't quite long enough to provide all the details I would like.  But the accompanying booklets provide references for additional reading which are very useful.",1353369600,2,465,4.716049382716049
