7167606,3,B00XHY6MW6,"""Samba"" (2014 release from France; 115 min.) brings the story of Samba Ciss. As the movie opens, the camera pans from a wedding reception to ultimately the back kitchen, where we meet Samba, an illegal resident in Paris hailing from Senegal, making ends meet as a dishwasher. It's not long before Samba gets into trouble, and he faces possible deportation, despite having live in France already 10 years. Alice, a novice social worker/pro bono immigration adviser, is assigned to Samba's case. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a return of the team that brought us the delightful ""The Untouchables"" a few years ago: co-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, and lead actor Omar Sy. On top of that, one of my favorite actresses, Charlotte Gainsbourg, co-stars. So this just HAS to be a great movie, right? Alas, it was not to be. From almost the very beginning of the movie, the plot is riddled with clichs and one-dimensional characters. Alice, played by Gainsbourg, is a rookie, literally the first day on the job. She is told by a co-worker who is training her that she should never, ever give out her phone number to any of the immigrants she is assigned to assist. So what does Alice do within minutes? Give her phone number to Samba, of course! The immigration system is portrayed as absurd, and I'm sure that there are serious issues there, but the way that the directors present it to us (all illegal immigrants: angels! immigration officials: the devil incarnate!) just made me roll my eyes. As for the supposed ""comedy"" aspects of this movie, I didn't notice much of any. I'm sorry if I'm being harsh on this movie. I'm sure this movie was well-intended, and I really wanted to like it, but when the movie was over, I felt very disappointed and, frankly, let down. Please note there is a nice soundtrack (available in Europe but not in the US, as far as I can tell), which features the Brothers Johnson's ""Stomp"", Bob Marley's ""Waiting In Vain"", and Cyreeta's ""To Know You Is to Love You"", among many others.

I saw this movie during a family visit in Belgium in November, 2014 (yes, over a year ago). The early evening screening where I saw this at was quite well attended actually. Given the success on the art-house theater circuit of ""The Untouchables"", I would've expected this to get a US release at some point, but I don't think that happened (and if it did, it never made it to my art-house theater here in Cincinnati). Whether on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray, I encourage you to check this out and draw your own conclusions about ""Samba"", although in all honesty I cannot recommend this movie.",1454284800,,2742,4.686721991701245
7167607,5,B00XHY6MW6,"Omar Sy lights up the screen!
I loved this movie. i'd seen Intouchable with Omar Sy and it was great. I have been anticipating Samba's release for a while.
The film centers around Samba and Charlotte Gainsbourg character as they navigate their way towards each other. The tension builds throughout the film as to will they or won't they have a happy ending. There are various subplots concerning his fellow illegal immigrants. The best is his 'Brazilian' friend. The Diet Coke scene was great!
It's a interesting topic (illegal immigrants) and currently topical and gave me compassion for why people leave their own country and the struggles they face.
If you like a uplifting film with great actors (especially Omar Sy), with humour, sadness but triumph over adversity, plus a healthy dose of romance, rent this movie!!!",1454198400,13,821,5.0

But, from my perspective as a black woman it is so disappointing to see handsome black men continually isolated from their families and communities in films. the actress that plays Gracieuse is a fashion model, a really attractive. She is shown as callous and unfeeling for the 10 minutes she' on screen. But Charlotte Gainsbourg's character is fully developed and made to seem likeable.

7167649,5,B00XHY6MW6,"This film is absolutely incredible. I think Omar Sy is the best actor in French cinema. His breakout role as a troubled French delinquent in the film Les Intouchables has no-doubt kept him working and he does just as good of a job acting in this film Samba. I am not a huge fan of Charlotte Gainsbourg but I think she played the part well. This film shows many relevant issues: the French woman had a ""burn out"" while the Senegalese immigrant is simply trying to find stable work, the loops and difficulties that refugees face, the economic hardships faced by many in France and the wealth that French citizens have been able to hold onto. I appreciate that the ending is not cliche.

It's a story of a woman who's on sabbatical from her job due to a mental break down and decides to do volunteer work being an advocate for immigrants. (Lose job...no money...VOLUNTEER??) Then she falls in love with Samba. An executive hooking up with an immigrant who has nothing, is washing dishes to get by and is in constant fear of being deported?  Again, ridiculous.  I watched it because I'd seen Omar in ""The Intouchables"" which was great. His talent is wasted in this movie and he's paired up with an actress who for some reason, no matter what, plays her role with a perpetual look of shock and bewilderment.

7167669,5,B00XHY6MW6,"This is a beautifully-done movie showing the plight of the illegal immigrant and the bureaucracy of immigration law in France.  Omar Sy (Samba) and  Charlotte Gainsbourg (Alice, his case worker) give top performances in this sensitively-portrayed movie.

Samba came from Dakar after his mother died and had been staying with his uncle Lamouna for ten years. He's an honest, law-abiding citizen as best as he can under the status thrown at him. He's working as a dishwasher at an upscale restaurant.  When he's offered a job there as a chef, he learns that his residence permit had been denied and is arrested.  He's now having to figure out how to stay in France and do odd day jobs and get paid under the table. He befriends a Brazilian named Wilson (Tahar Rahim, another great talent in this movie) who turns out not to be who he claims to be, but who helps him meet ordinary people.  Samba also befriends a man from Senegal who desperately wants to stay in France and get married to a woman he met when he first arrived in the country.  All he knows is that her name is Gracieuse and works as a beautician.  In short, this movie is about a lot of people with dreams who just want to work their way to achieve those dreams, but their status does not permit them to.

Alice also has her secrets.  She's working as an immigration case worker while on sabbatical from her real job.  She had a mental breakdown and assaulted a co-worker.  She suffers from insomnia and has a hard time relax, but she finds something in Samba that attracts her to him, as he is attracted to her.  A friendship develops that becomes stronger throughout the movie, and which I feel is what carries this movie.  The chemistry between these two actors is real.  Both Samba and Alice learn about each other and themselves through talking with one another, and they get to see what it's like in each other's life.

The bitter-sweet end is a bit surprising, but it leaves the audience realizing the daily fear and terror illegals can face just because of their residency status.",1468886400,4,2051,4.578082191780822

7167690,5,B00XHY6MW6,"This review refers - as usual with me - to the original version with subtitles + and also: no content information - so no SPOILERs:

after having watched this blockbuster ""Intouchables"" - rather lately on dvd only 2 years ago, I was really pleasantly surprised. A significant reason for this I will come back to again down below...

""Intouchables"" from 2011 was a comedy, ""Samba"" is more of a social drama with some comedic ingredients.

So Samba is completely different from its predecessor. Still, I was not disappointed with it at all as some other customers here. Right on the contrary:

The serious issue of the ""sans-papiers"" (illegals without a passport/ aliens) is dealt with in a quite credible way, given the fact this is a mass-compatible movie (!)
Omar Sy from Intouchables is acting really great here. He plays his character with soooo much heart and sincerity and does completely without any cool antics/ moves.
The well-known C. Gainsbourg shows a largely credible acting burnout patient in action. Her initially so brittle restraint and awkward uncertainty until she all of a sudden explodes in the office with anger, fit quite wonderfully.
Certainly some stereotypes can not be avoided, but an enormous advantage is, that the two directors Toledano + Nakache cast amateur actors for numerous supporting roles of the ""sans papiers"" - yes, authenticity rules !!! Very good.

In order to finally come back to the one main reason referred to above:

I loved it, how this splendid Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi adds layers to the film by creating a wonderfully melancholic atmosphere, that simply works tremendously right and honest for me.
I thought, that was just as awesome with Intouchables. Timid beauty that a lot of cheeky Hollywood film music scores can only dream of - cos this is the old Europe, yanks !!!

Conclusion: One more time, Nakache + Toledano manage to deal with a serious issue credibly and yet to stage it with fairly light hand. Good job.

However, the film should have been edited so parts don't become boring.  Many times, I found myself feeling like saying, ""OK, I GET it,"" because the scenes were too long.  Even so, it portrays well the plight of undocumented foreigners in France.",1510876800,,357,4.983050847457627
