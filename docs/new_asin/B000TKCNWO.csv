8209916,3,B000TKCNWO,"This second disk shares the numerous drawbacks and few strengths of the first one.  The manufacturer bizarrely believes that they should release these disks one at a time and charge a high price for a 22-minute episode.  It's crazy and it is the primary reason why you should not buy this disk.  Eventually Geneon will release all the episodes in a single box set and then it may be worth buying (depending upon the price).  But right now if you buy each disk you will end up spending over $150 for what amounts to about two hours of entertainment.  Is it really worth $80 an hour?  No.

There are other odd things about this release.  The first disk had English dubbing.  This one does not.  That means that you have to read the subtitles all the way through the episode.  I know that anime fans insist that this is the only proper way to watch, but while you are reading the words you cannot watch the action, and vice versa.  Why are the two disks inconsistent in format?  Similarly, disk 2 has some background explanation (as an intro to the episode) that was missing--and badly needed--on disk one.

I also did not find any extras on this disk (and did not find them on the first disk either).  I've read about all the ""great extras"" but they are either hidden behind confusing menus or they are only unlocked by going to a website.  To repeat: I cannot find any of the extras on either disk.

That said, the story for disk two is better and more engaging than disk one.  Disk one was more subtle and simply introduced the characters and it was only at the end did we get an intriguing mystery.  That mystery is explored much more in disk two and the story darkens.  The benign government of the lunar colony appears to be hiding a big secret.

The imagery is great (even without HD-DVD), the colors are bold, the animation is top notch.  This would be a very enjoyable series if only the studio would come to its senses and release it properly, as a box set, with real extras, and at a reasonable price.  How long will we have to wait for them to do that?",1192060800,,2061,4.36578947368421
8209917,3,B000TKCNWO,"I know this product has not hit american shelves yet but I had a chance to screen it at otakon in baltimore on an impressive HD-TV and sound system.

I screened both episodes and the plot of the first was not all that interesting to me.  Worth watching on the equipment that was avalible to see it on just to see the high def in action but aside from that nothing special.

This episode really got me intersted in seeing the rest of the series, however, as it delves far deeper into the exodus from earth as well as exploring more fully what is apprently a giant lunar government conspiracy.  I fully expect to watch all of the remaining episodes when I have the time and the money...

Which brings me to my last point.  In order to get $30 out of this HD DVD you would have to be a big fan of akira and that kind of animation style AND own an impressive 1080p television AND own a surround sound system to match.  Even given the criteria that you love the series and the other work but the director and writter (like Akira) it's still barely even worth the money unless you have the equipment to see it on.

As far as this episode goes I'd say it was a very entertaining <30mins and on the system I viewed it on it might actually be worth a buy at $30 but on a more common system or a PC I'd have to say pass.

Episode: 4 stars maybe 4.5
Price: 2 stars
Overall: 3 stars",1190246400,2,1370,4.101123595505618
