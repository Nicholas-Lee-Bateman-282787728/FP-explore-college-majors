7853038,2,6303695175,"I got this video because I have the Reebok Hi-Low Impact Video - which is AMAZING, I have been using it for 15 years. And I have the Legs video which is also amazing. The Legs video can be pretty challenging and it really tones your legs. I expected the same with the Abs video. It however is not challenging at all. Maybe if you were 100% out of shape this would be difficult but I got through the first two exercises (10 minutes each)and I felt like I had wasted my time. I haven't even bothered with the 3rd exercise yet. It may be much more challenging, but I didn't want ONE 10 minute workout, I wanted a whole video.",1337299200,,622,4.148760330578512
