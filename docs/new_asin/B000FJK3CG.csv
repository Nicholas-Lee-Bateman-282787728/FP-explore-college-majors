I used this after I had my son and continue to use it years later . There is also a twenty minute fast paced full body routine for those of us who have busy lives with not a lot of time for work outs.
Your flexibility and core strength will greatly improve.",1462752000,,481,4.182795698924731

8123618,5,B000FJK3CG,"A perfect workout-especially if you are trying to make that slow and steady ''postpartum comeback''. I've used this video after having both of my kids now, and each time it helped me get back into shape without being too time-consuming and is a ''gently challenging'' workout. Love that it is broken up into three 10-minute segments, so if you need to run and check on baby/toddler there is time to do that AND get a good workout in!!",1417996800,,434,4.576923076923077
8123619,5,B000FJK3CG,"I used to own a copy when I lived in Colorado and it did what I wanted.  I lost weight and I looked good.  I used it for toning my body too.  I like doing aerobics in front of my t.v. at home.  It's my time and then when I'm done I hit the showers.  I have found because I exercise to Cindy's work out video when I go to work I have more energy.  My body got in shape to do labor.  I'm a substitute food server for Tippecanoe Schools in Indiana and there's a lot of heavy lifting like either pans with food in them or boxes with frozen food to be organized and put on shelves.  There's a lot of walking around and sweeping and mopping with brooms and mops.  Bending down.  And because I'm exercising at home, it helps me to not have a pain in my body because my body is used to exercising.  I have better balance and I just function better.  I like how I feel too.  I'm happier.  I went 1 year too long without exercise because I lent my copy of this video to a friend and decided I need to buy another copy for myself and so that's why I bought this.  She has my old copy and I have this new copy.  :)  I have had 2 empty baby sacs and Cindy's workout helps to get rid of that extra kangaroo fat where the baby bump was.  I did get blessed with 1 child who is now 10 and I lost weight when I had her using Cindy's workout.  :)",1381276800,,1327,3.830258302583026
