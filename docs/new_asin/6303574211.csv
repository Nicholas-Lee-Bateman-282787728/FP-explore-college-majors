7851287,5,6303574211,"We had been looking for the Snoopy episode where he becomes a sled dog leader for over 20 years,I had tried once before but was unsuccessful. My wife and I frequently talked about how much we enjoyed the episode, but this time through Amazon a copy was found.
The promptness in sending the copy surprised us, and I kept it as a surprize for my wife,

we would have waited for winter to set the mood, but could not.
It's a good copy and made a wonderful night in front of the tely.

7851290,4,6303574211,"""What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown"" is not your typical Charlie Brown special.  Snoopy has one too many rootbeers and pizzas and dreams he's in Alaska (or the Yukon) during the Gold Rush as part of a team of surly huskies via bobsled.  Too bad Snoopy's faithful master wasn't able to  bail him out of dreamland!  More fantasy than anything else, which makes  this a unique treat!
In ""It's Magic, Charlie Brown"", Snoopy  makes Charlie Brown invisible and the blockhead takes the opportunity to do  something he's always wanted to do!  You'll have to see it for yourself in  order to get where I'm coming from (and if he succeeds)!",955756800,4,627,4.678899082568807
