1903255,4,B0000A5A3L,"The price is right for this nice collection of videos from Audioslave, the super group featuring Chris Cornell of Soundgarden with Rage Against the Machine (minus Zack de la Rocha).
This DVD is worth getting alone for the ""Show Me How To Live"" video which cleverly samples the vintage '70s car chase film, Vanishing Point. MTV has yet to show this video -- they may have banned it because of the ending of the video -- and so this may be your only chance to get a really good copy of it.
Also included on the disc are the videos for ""Cochise"" (awesome video for this rockin' tune) and ""Like A Stone."" There is also bonus concert footage from when the band performed on Letterman ontop of the marquee of the Ed Sullivan theater.
If you're a fan of the band then this is a must-have item.",1059955200,37,786,4.35374149659864

7996068,4,B0000A5A3L,"Picked this up for $2 at Goodwill, actually. Two bucks is about right, I wouldn't want to have paid $10... Good sound quality, and 30 minutes is about right for my maximum Audioslave exposure. 'Like a Stone' is such a great song and the '02 video from some New York concert is worth watching. My opinion of 'Slave was reestablished from  seeing the fabulous show by Rage Against the Machine (reunion) at Coachella.",1321315200,,414,4.671232876712328
7996069,5,B0000A5A3L,Nice addition to my audioslave DVDs..  Chris Cornells voice is great!  The band members (rage against the machine) are a perfect match with Chris Cornells voice!,1284681600,,161,5.153846153846154
7996070,1,B0000A5A3L,1st this dvd I believe is the same as the other DVD of a similar name. 2nd I am guessing this is the same DVD because it doesn't work in any DVD player. Please don't be fooled by the different cover like I was.,1250208000,,210,3.7954545454545454
7996071,4,B0000A5A3L,"Unfussy in execution this DVD is aimed squarely at fans just wanting the music clips from Audioslaves first S/T album. Delivered hot to your DVD player without any interview footage, hardly any cringeworthy behind the scenes stupidity or shameless self promotion. Which is a bit of a bonus feature in itself if you get what I mean.

As to what is here, well we get the clips to the singles Cochise, Like A Stone and Show Me How To Live. And taken as a whole it's a pretty enjoyable package of quality rock `n' roll without too many of the usual histrionics and it's always a joy to hear Chris Cornell croon away. The guy could sing a shopping list and it would still sound good. Well OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration...

To flesh out the package just a bit there is footage of the band playing in New York - the two songs in question being Set It Off and Gasoline and this was recorded on November 25th 2002. The songs are actually fairly strong, as were most of the tunes off the bands self titled debut and seeing them cruise through a couple of live numbers does round off this release nicely.

As I said, one for the fans, the video clips are good - I won't spoil them for you by describing them in detail - but get this package cheap which shouldn't be hard since it was actually marketed very cheaply when it was new. A band not out to screw every cent out of their fans pockets? Now that's priceless as the folks at Visa would say.",1195171200,,1441,4.251824817518248
7996072,5,B0000A5A3L,"This is an affordable, and potent little dvd that contains 3 videos, cochise, like a stone, and show me how to live, along with 2 live tracks gasoline and set it off.  Plus there are interviews with all 4 of the bandmates, and a brief origin of the band as told by all of them.  For the low prices that this DVD is going for right now, this is a must have for all audioslave fans.  Check this out, well worth it.",1183334400,,412,4.0
7996073,5,B0000A5A3L,"This DVD single packs a lot of punch for only a few bucks. You don't be a diehard fan to enjoy this DVD.If you don't know Audioslave (or they former bands Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine) and you like rock - real rock - not the wimpy pablum that passes for music today, pick this up and give them a listen. Audioslave's music is raw, powerful and edgy with lyrics so deep they may haunt you.  This is a wonderful collection of 3 conceptual videos (""Cochise"" - Do play it loud as the intro suggests; ""Like a Stone"" and ""Show Me How to Live"") and live performances of ""Set It Off"" and ""Gasoline."" The production values on the videos are among the very best; everything looks and sound great. Have you seen any music video lately that matches the intensity of  ""Show Me How to Live?""  I think not. Unless you get MTV2 or Fuse,you may never see these videos. In which case, you are really missing out, so buy this DVD.",1065225600,22,923,4.323699421965318
7996074,5,B0000A5A3L,"There isn't much to this DVD, but it's all good. The videos for the three singles ""Cochise"", ""Like a Stone"" (my favorite), and ""Show Me How To Live"" are all good, even if you've seen them before. ""Live"" is as heart-pumping as any Hollywood action flick with an ending that surprised me (I hadn't seen it). The live footage of ""Set it Off"" and ""Gasoline"" is good, but herein lies my only complaint: why couldn't they have just gone ahead and put the whole show on here? I believe they only played six or seven songs, so it easily would have fit. Personally, I would have paid an extra five bucks to see the whole thing on here. The interviews are insightful, interesting, and definitely spice things up a little bit. All in all, for ten bucks, you can't go wrong. If you like the band, this will give you something to do while waiting for the next album (or DVD).",1060041600,15,862,4.3602484472049685
