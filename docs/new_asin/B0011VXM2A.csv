8242740,2,B0011VXM2A,"This is one of the most one sided biographies that I have seen. According to Prof Fears and his hero worship, Churchill could do no wrong. Shortly after his appointment to Lord of the Admiralty Churchill was removed from the office. Fears says that it was jealousies, but if those jealousies were so strong how did Churchill get the appointment in the first place. Churchill was uniquely prepared to lead Britain through the war years but his extreme political views got him voted out of office in a landslide shortly after the war ended. Fears would have us believe that Churchill was the genius, not Roosevelt. But it was Roosevelt who repeatedly had to tell Churchill that America was in the war to defeat Germany, not protect Britain's colonial empire. Churchill adamantly opposed the allied invasion of France until Roosevelt insisted that America would go it alone if necessary. Only then did Churchill back down, but Fears would have us believe that Churchill's wisdom delayed the invasion until the proper time. As early as 1942 American generals knew that the only second front that could be adequately supported by Allied air cover had to be in France. Churchill wanted an invasion from Italy in order to keep Romania, etc out of Russian hands, and extend British dominance to Greece, but Roosevelt would have none of it. If you are looking for a balanced presentation of Churchill based upon the facts, look elsewhere.",1451865600,,1429,4.909090909090909

8242742,5,B0011VXM2A,"As always, I must begin with just how fantastic a presenter J. Rufus Fears is.  One of the keys to a great storyteller, in my experience, is the ability to convey a story with some sort of artistic elan.  Fears is fully capable of that, fully rapping the viewer in Churchill's history.  Fears presents the information as though he were an actor, at times, and able to apply voices to many of the relevant individuals in Churchill's history.  On top of this, Fears has such an organized understanding of all of the information that he is able to present the information on the fly.  That is, he does not read from a teleprompter, which can be a baneful experience many viewers, as it feels so unnatural.  Not to worry, because Fears does not do this.

As far as the content, I think Fears gives a very fair assessment of the information, and he often includes opinions that counter his own, which is refreshing.  He begins with the first Duke of Marlborough, which sets the stage for Churchill, and goes from there.  One of the things I especially liked about the presentation was that there was quite a bit of content on Churchill outside of WWII.  Fears has a deep appreciation for Churchill's spirit, and features it in his storytelling, so that the viewer has a deepened sense of who Churchill was.

This is an outstanding and quick lecture series, and I highly recommend it.",1331856000,,1378,4.60655737704918
