8185764,4,B000OONRPC,"The DVD shows Dr. Barnett performing the Rapid Reintegration Procedure on a client.  The DVD is an adjunct to the book of the same name published by Junica Publishing ([...]  If you purchase the book for $49 (well worth the price) you can purchase the DVD for $15 from the same site.  After reading the book, the DVD is the capstone showing how the ego state hypnotherapy procedure is used to aid a client in ridding him/herself of parent/child conflicts that result in long term personal issues. The book takes you step by step through the procedure. The work is done by the client and the client does not have to disclose any issues to the hypnotherapist - it is essentially internal work to the client with the hypnotherapist providing guidance.

I gave the DVD a 4 out of 5 rating because the sound quality on the DVD is poor - you have to turn the volume up high to hear it.  If you are listening to it on your computer, all the normal beeps and other sounds are then greatly amplified to the point of being irritating.  I find this a typical problem with CDs that have recorded audio sessions on them (as well as garage band demo CDs) - a recording studio would normalize the output during editing before creating the master and avoid the problem. It doesn't diminish the content, just the ease of use in my opinion.",1228521600,3,1322,4.464730290456432
