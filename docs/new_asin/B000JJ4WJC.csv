8150669,5,B000JJ4WJC,"Abel Nightroad is a Cruznik. A vampire that feeds on the blood of other vampires. He is also a clergyman that fights to protect the humans. A organization is out to start a war between humanity and the nations that are ruled by the vampires. Abel and his friends must fight to protect humanity and the vampires from a war that could wipe out both races. Like it almost did 900 years ago.

This anime is beautifully done. The animation and voice acting are great. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. Like all the great animes this story has tons of great characters and very compelling story. There's nothing bad about it. I am shocked to see that there are people out there that didn't like this series. It's certainly different, but not one you'll soon forget.",1354752000,,760,4.547445255474453
8150670,5,B000JJ4WJC,I loved the series when it aired on TV. however I was saddened when the creator of the series died suddenly and the series was cancelled. I had to get due to it's unique take on vampires bring them a bit closer to being human however still possessing the typical traits of a vampire. loved the story line scenes etc. I just wish there was a season two.,1339372800,,352,4.1911764705882355

8150672,5,B000JJ4WJC,The artwork is beautiful as always for Suwabe's anime.  The plot is interesting with action/drama and humor.,1180137600,,108,5.352941176470588
8150673,5,B000JJ4WJC,"The Ibelis (pts. 2&3) (Episodes 13-14) Abel and Ester form and alliance with Brother Petros of the Inquisition(He works for Cardinal Francesco).  Ion insists on completing his mission to meet with Cardinal Caterina.  Petros agrees to help and then promises to kill him.  The order or Rosenkreutz works to prevent this meeting and start a war between the Empire and the Vatican.

The Nightlords(pts. 1-2) (Episodes 15-16) Abel and Esther are sent to the Empire to open diplomatic relations.  Ion's return home leads to attack on his family home and the death of his grandmother.",1179532800,,577,5.031578947368421
8150674,4,B000JJ4WJC,"These are the turning point episodes of Trinity Blood, when questions begin to be answered and things start to proceed at full speed.

The first two episodes involve the continuation of what must be the worst few days of Ion Fortuna's life as his allies try to get him to the negotiation table alive.  That's only half the problem though, as the last two episodes begin Abel and Esther's journey with him back to Methuselah to report to the Empress and complete his mission - a mission that more than a few don't want to succeed...

This is also an important volume for Esther, as she's forced to come to terms with Abel's dark side and the worst aspects of his being a Krusnik - and starts to form a deep bond against all odds with Ion in spite of her hatred of Methuselah, no longer able to see the essentially gentle young vampire in the same light now that she's gotten to know him.

The arcs revolving around Ion's mission are arguably the best of the entire series, and Trinity Blood fans often point to these episodes as some of their favorites.",1173571200,,1052,4.435233160621761
8150675,5,B000JJ4WJC,Trinity Blood is a very character driven story. The main plot is a bit odd since it takes place in a world where vampires and humans live side by side fighting for control after a huge world war almost destroyed both sides. The war is never really talked about so we don't know much about the world before that which leaves many questions unanswered. The character are so good that you won't care about a hole or two in the basic plot. Go for it.,1171584000,,446,4.258823529411765
