8036570,5,B00061UHYC,"I had this version of Thumbelina when i was a kid on vhs tape and watched it so much it broke the tape. When I finally found it on dvd I was so excited at the thought of being able to watch it again after at least 15 years. It was even better than I remembered it! The stage setup is absolutely amazing and beautiful throughout the whole movie. The cottage Thumbelina's mother lives in is adorable, the stream that Thumbelina travels down on the lily pad looks so realistic with all the plants and the beautiful outdoor scenery. The field mouse's home is decorated with such amazing detail-the cast iron cook stove,the bed posts made from Indian corn,the arch wooden door,the piles of nuts he has gathered for the winter,everything a mouse would have in his house! The field mouse takes her to meet his friend Mr. Mole who of course lives in a tunnel under ground. The tunnel looks incredibly real,you can even hear the sounds of a train and horses above ground. Inside Mr. Moles house it is packed with all kinds of cool things that appropriately have spider webs strung from here to there. Then Thumbelina meets the swallow in the tunnel. After she nurses him back to health he saves her from marrying Mr. Mole and takes her to the most beautiful flower garden where she meets the Flower Prince and falls in love with him. They play a game of chess and the chess pieces have butterflies on them,it's just beautiful! There is not anything about this movie I don't LOVE! The day I got it in the mail I watched it with my 3 year old who now loves it too. It is the perfect fairy tale for the young and young at heart! You cannot go wrong purchasing this movie,it's worth every penny and then some!",1303257600,2,1696,4.404458598726115

Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Thumbelina"" is yet another superlative entry in the series.  Starring Carrie Fisher and Burgess Meredith, it also features a sharp script and strong soundtrack.

The visual effects are also exceptional, as Ms. Fisher really does appear to be extraordinarily small, and the production design and costumes are elaborate.  In particular, Burgess Meredith gives an impressive performance as Mr. Mole, the admirer and would-be rodent husband of Thumbelina.  The makeup and costuming on Mr. Meredith is stunning and even gross.  Carrie Fisher herself gives a remarkable and genuine performance as the title heroine.

Also starring Lu Leonard, Donovan Scott, and William Katt Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Thumbelina"" is one of the very best titles in the series.",1268438400,2,789,5.525
8036572,4,B00061UHYC,"FAERIE TALE THEATRE's adaptation of THUMBELINA is one of their most imaginative, featuring Carrie Fisher in the title role.

A lonely char-woman (Conchata Ferrall) is given a magical barley seed, which sprouts into a lovely flower.  When the flower opens, out pops beautiful Thumbelina (Carrie Fisher).  The char-woman's wish to be a mother has been granted, and the pair could not be happier.  But Thumblina's happy life with her mother is short-lived when the tiny creature is kidnapped by Mother Toad...

A beautiful entry in the series.  Co-starring William Katt as the Prince of the Flowers and Burgess Meredith as Mr Mole.  Carrie Fisher is radiant in her performance.",1099958400,5,674,5.128440366972477
8036573,4,B00061UHYC,"My three-year-old daughter fell in love with this the first time we borrowed it from the library. I enjoyed it myself; my only gripe is Conchata Ferrell's performance. This usually very talented actress seems bored to tears and injects absolutely no feeling into her role as Thumbelina's mother. It's as if she was directed to perform as stoically as possible. I don't get it at all. I am also not impressed with Carrie Fisher's singing here. I know she is capable of singing quite beautifully, I just don't think the folkish songs in this tale are well suited to her instrument. It's hard to pull off such dirges unless the singer has that ethereal, almost mediaeval quality to her voice (think Loreena McKennitt, Mediaveal Baebes). But those minor complaints are of no consequence whatsoever to the intended audience. Children will certainly be enchanted! It's witty script and a fun production.",1041984000,2,897,4.986666666666666
8036574,5,B00061UHYC,"""Thumbelina"" is a fantastic retelling of the classic Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, ""Little Thumb"".
Produced in 1983 (and released the following year), as part of Shelley Duvall's charming live-action ""Faerie Tale Theatre"", the narrative is told with good humour, imagination, and a great sense of fun.  The magnificent cast adds much colour and warmth to the proceedings.  In particular, Carrie Fisher, in the title role, delivers a captivating performance.  She makes an extremely attractive heroine, not to mention one who's ""more than just another pretty face"".  She's an absolute delight, adding her unique qualities to the role.  Not only is she pint-sized in real life (although not quite as tiny as a thumb!), she has a lovely, deep voice that is quite at odds with her diminutive stature.  When she sings, it is a beautiful and rewarding experience.  Indeed, she sings with ""an angel's voice"".  (This is also a highlight for any Carrie Fisher fan, as she began her career as a singer, and yet she only sings briefly in ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", 1986, and in the Walt Disney live-action comedy, ""Sunday Drive"", also released in 1986.)
Carrie Fisher is supported by equally delightful character actors.  The late Burgess Meredith is in top form as Mr Mole, the second would-be husband of Thumbelina.  Likewise, William Katt makes a very positive impression as the Prince of the Flower Angels.
This wonderful fairy tale is further enhanced by excellent production values, including great music, atmospheric sets, and good costumes and creatures like Mother Toad, her hapless son, Herman, the Fieldmouse, and the Swallow.
The script faithfully follows the original story, although the gender of the Fieldmouse has been changed, making for a more convincing friendship with Mr Mole to exist, as well as creating a heartfelt guardianship of Thumbelina along strictly platonic lines.
This well-written and perceptive tale (""I'm always the bride, but never the bridesmaid"") makes for enchanting family entertainment.  ""Thumbelina"" delivers a great message, too, but above all, it's storytelling at it's most memorable.
I applaud executive producer Shelley Duvall, and all involved, for giving such a wonderful gift.  It's up there with Jim Henson's equally engaging ""Storyteller"" anthology series, produced in the late 1980s, and the ""The Doll"", an Emmy Award winning episode of ""Amazing Stories"" (of the same era).
For me, it's an extra special treat because Carrie Fisher became much more than just Princess Leia with this performance.  Besides, she continues to melt me every time she smiles as the Ultimate Flower Angel!  Let's hope that this ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" production, along with my other favourites like ""Beauty and the Beast"", are re-released soon.  Preservation on DVD for future generations is highly recommended.",996278400,14,2835,5.296875
