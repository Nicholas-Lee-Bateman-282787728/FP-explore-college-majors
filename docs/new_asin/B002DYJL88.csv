8366392,1,B002DYJL88,"I hope no one finds out I actually rented this thing. I was hoping for something like another killer clown movie with much better special effects, but this was nothing like it. It was more like a PG-13 snuff film",1479772800,,212,4.325
8366393,1,B002DYJL88,"I pride myself on knowing the B movies. Most have some good parts. This abomination shouldn't even be called a movie. It is definitely the worst thing I've ever watched. This disc shouldn't even be available for sale. All copy's should be destroyed. I know you are thinking ""I have to watch this if it's that bad!"". NO YOU DON'T!!!!!!!!!!! Forget about that and close you browser right now. I'm serious. DO NOT ORDER OR WATCH THIS PIECE OF TRASH! I wish I could give it 0 stars. Or go back in time before I watched it.",1439078400,,518,4.350515463917525
8366394,1,B002DYJL88,"I like twisted and funny horror movies.
This thing is not twisted. It is not funny. It is not even horrific. I don't know if it even qualifies as a movie.
There is no acting here - unless you call people grinning or screaming or running for apparent reason.
There is this endless voice over that tells us what is happening - except not much happens. Girls and guys get killed by clowns, supposedly in horrific manners, but because there is nothing horrific about any of it as (obviously for budgetary reasons) there is no horrific things on display.
No, I take it back.
It is twisted that this thing was made. It is funny that I paid for it (the joke is on me). It is horrific that this is available on Amazon.
Wish I could give it zero star.",1339200000,,742,4.2695035460992905
8366395,5,B002DYJL88,"A lighthearted film for the modern romantic. A classic artistic tale of love, acceptance, and self discovery. For a good laugh and touch of the heart you won't be disappointed.",1328659200,7,176,4.9
8366396,5,B002DYJL88,"I love clown movies so this obviously had to be in my collection. I purchased without any anticipation of it being any thing more than just OK. I was wrong. I truly love this movie. The narrating is awesome. It really isn't as gory and bloody as the cover suggests, but it does have some sick, creepy moments. The atmosphere fits nice. The animation parts are very cool. This movie is truly made for stoners. I couldn't/wouldn't imagine watching this movie any other way.
I wanna check out more movies from these guys (if there is any).
I HIGHly recommend this movie to horror and/or clown loving stoners.",1315180800,7,605,4.611111111111111
8366397,1,B002DYJL88,"I love watching B-horror movies, unfortunately, this one rates an F.  How bad is it?  They flash the word HORROR on the screen when you are supposed to be scared! I can't figure out why--perhaps because they realized it wasn't scary too, maybe it is intended to distract from the fact that the actors don't look scared, or can't act, or that they shot it with a consumer grade DV camera.  Who knows?!?  Ultimately, if you like wasting money this is a great way to lose a couple of bucks.",1255564800,6,487,4.377777777777778
