8507145,1,B0012TBLHO,"I bought this DVD hoping that it would help me groom my bichon at home.  I had my doubts about it when I took it out of the box and saw the cheap graphics on the DVD cover.  It starts off showing how to bathe a dog for which they use an Australian Shepherd - they could have at least used one of the dogs featured in the rest of the video.  This segment seems to last forever with its terrible, repetitive music and narrator who seems extremely bored as he describes the various scents available in shampoos.  The narrator is hard to understand and is almost drowned out by the bad music.  The DVD continues on to drying, clipping, ear cleaning, and nail clipping.  They show the groomers using various brands of clippers but don't really tell you what blade or comb size they are using.  The groomer uses scissors on the face and paws of the bichon, but they don't tell you the size and type of scissors.  Also, it would have been helpful if they would have demonstrated grooming each particular breed from start to finish.  Instead, they jump between the poodle, maltese, shih tzu, havanese, bichon, and cocker spaniel in each segment and identify only a few of the breeds they are working on.  A little more detail from the narrator during the clipping would have been nice too.  This DVD is basically just watching someone groom a dog while listening to annoying music with a few comments from a narrator and some written instructions (some with typos) flashing on the screen.  Needless to say, I am continuing my search for another, hopefully more informative DVD.",1230940800,8,1569,4.564285714285714
8507146,1,B0012TBLHO,I buy a fair amount of items on Amazon. This is the first time I have bothered to review an item. This DVD in my opinion is not worth the money or time I invested in it. The quality is very poor. Sometimes out of focus and shaky. The narrator sounds like he is bored and he doesn't even say that much. Apparently you are supposed to learn by watching without much instruction. There was annoying music playing over and over and sometimes made it hard to hear the narrator. Another thing...if you're going to show a closeup repeatedly of a groomer's arm how about putting some makeup on the big scab she has. Not everyone cares to see that sort of thing. Probably what bothered me most was they showed you what to do if you cut a dog's quick while trimming their nails - I got the distinct impression the groomer cut the quick on purpose for this scene.,1209427200,20,852,4.298136645962733
8507147,1,B0012TBLHO,"This DVD provided hardly any information at all beyond just watching the groomers.  These groomers (or a voice-over) should have been explaining WHAT they were doing in detail.  There was no indication of which blade they were using on the various dogs and the reason for that choice; we didn't get to SEE a detachable blade being changed out or the pros and cons of detachable vs. fixed blades; there was no discussion of the difference among the various brands of clippers available on the market; no discussion of attachment combs or why they used scissors at times rather than clippers, etc., etc., etc.

Finally, I thought the groomers were a little too rough with the dogs, and the tables and environment a little shoddy (and let's not forget that large scab on the one groomer's arm that we kept seeing over and over), and I never saw one of them disinfecting their tools before working on a dog.  PLUS, the ""brand new"" DVD came with fingerprints on the play side and hung up during play in one section.  All in all, a VERY unsatisfactory experience.

Because the DVD was defective, I asked them to send me a return label, but they did not.  They said I would get a full refund, but after I returned the DVD, to this day (4 months later), they have not refunded my money.  My emails since then have gone unanswered.",1208649600,11,1322,4.548523206751055
