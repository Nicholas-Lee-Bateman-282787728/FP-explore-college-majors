7863738,5,6304143648,"My daughter begins ballet classes this month and seems to be pretty excited about it.  I bought a ballet book and three ballet dvds for Christmas.  I could have saved my money by only buying this one.  She is FASCINATED by this tape.  The actual Nutcracker is too long for her to sit and watch (she just turned three) but this tape provides clips from classes, the Nutcracker auditions, and the Nutcracker itself.  It is short and exciting enough to keep her attention (the instructional dvds bored her), and she runs around the house dancing and calling herself Clara.",1199836800,,569,4.707070707070707

She watches it all the time and her 19 month old sister loves it too! She is a ballerina in the making and walks around the house saying ""nina, nina"" when whe wants to watch the video!",990835200,,299,4.2631578947368425
