4205628,5,B003UNK8RE,"This is a must see film for anyone that has or knows a teen girl. Women will be inspired to share their stories to help young girls. Men will gain insight about the emotional lives of women and more effective ways to parent and be in relationship with women. There is no shame in having a past, the shame comes when you are unwilling to share it. Our community has been in need to this type of dialogue for some time. Kudos to Janks Morton for heeding the call.",1279065600,,461,4.191011235955056
4205629,5,B003UNK8RE,"This film holds you in your seat from beginning to end because it is just the truth! It searches out a place that many women have buried deep inside. It talks about the ""unspoken;"" it brings to light a process of reasoning that many women are silently faced with, some forced into... but many do not talk about.  It helps us to look at who we are and think about why. It brings some questions to mind... Young teen, old-timer or in-between: Do we have the courage to really take the masks off and be transparent, knowing that this is the only way to get to the root of some issues and really deal with them?  Are we ready to be real with ourselves and give of ourselves, share with others?  Do we really want to be healed? Is there someone in your life who needs to have a REAL conversation?  Do YOU? If so, then We NEED to TALK!  This is where prevention can occur, and healing can begin...",1279065600,4,891,4.2176470588235295
4205630,5,B003UNK8RE,"This is a great and powerful presentation for the need to talk to the teens in our life! No matter who you are this film will cause you to assess your role in the life of teens, women and men. You will ask yourself ""What am I really doing about the issues confronting the teens in my life?"" I have had numerous deep and encouraging conversations after viewing this film with friends. This film will get you to not just think, but to act on what you truly believe. If we are to stop the madness in any community, we must open our mouth and tell our real stories. It is time to stop covering up and looking the other way. As women, we must open true and honest dialogue - We Really Do Need to Talk. Don't hesitate, buy it NOW!",1279065600,,724,4.105633802816901
8406074,2,B003UNK8RE,Was very disappointed and embarrassed showing this to my womens group because of the poor quality. During the first 10 minutes the tape jumped continually and was unclear. Certain segments of the filming the camera man must not have realized he was holding the camera down facing the ground while he was talking to the participants so you saw feet and grass. Overall the parts that we could hear and see were very good. Sorry that I was not able to enjoy the entire film,1454889600,,470,4.541176470588235

8406076,3,B003UNK8RE,"It's okay. I guess I was expecting something else.  Hearing about other women's experiences is always helpful, because many women have stop talking to each other. I especially hope black women start trusting each other again.",1355529600,3,225,5.25
8406077,5,B003UNK8RE,The product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  I am very happy with the product that I have received.,1326153600,2,117,4.318181818181818
8406078,5,B003UNK8RE,"I saw this movie during an internet promo that was completely free.  I am here to buy a copy because I want to have this movie on hand when I have the opportunity to talk to girls.  The message, although delivered by brown faces, is applicable to all women and girls in this American culture.

I laughed, I listened, I cried, and I rewound the video and my life thinking of all of the demons that I have riding my spirit from choices made in the past.  This movie offers the message that you are loved and that redemption is your right.  The women in this movie say without hesitation that you can push past mistakes and victimization to become whole and beautiful to yourself.  And that is where the healing begins!",1296345600,,716,4.386363636363637

8406080,5,B003UNK8RE,Well done and a much needed movie on a topic that has been ignored for too long.  Every women and daughter should see it!,1283644800,,121,4.041666666666667
8406081,4,B003UNK8RE,We Need to Talk is an insightful and powerful documentary that addresses the misunderstadings in our community and how we need to open up the dialogue like this to facilitate honest healing.,1281484800,,190,4.96875
8406082,5,B003UNK8RE,This is an amazingly insightful and humbling docoumentary.  I am recommending it to all my friends.  So many young girls do not have wise people speaking into their lives and helping them make better decisions.  The women in this documentary are doing such a service to everyone that sees it!  Definitely another MUST SEE from Janks Morton!!,1280707200,,341,4.9298245614035086
8406083,5,B003UNK8RE,"Wow! Where to begin! This video will make you laugh, cry, think, and want to tell someone else about it so they too may see it.  Although older women are the focus, teens male and female, and young adult women and men need to see this film.  It will give men insight into women that has been kept secret for way too long. I pray it reaches everyone in any community, but especially the African-American community, because the secrets we keep as women are silent killers of our culture, souls, and spirits.  The transparency of the women is so brutually honest...and heartbreakingly real. This is a MUST SEE!!",1279065600,3,608,4.611111111111111
