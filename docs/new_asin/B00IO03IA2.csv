8643793,2,B00IO03IA2,"There's no denying Stan Lee's a giant on the super-hero scene. He had a hand in creating some of the most famous and enduring characters of the genre. But that was back in the 60's, and if this is any indication, his instincts haven't had much in the way of updating since then.

This is one of the most cliche super-hero offerings I've ever seen. A bunch of aliens, who all look human and each have a distinctive special power crash their ship on Earth, and might never get home. To fill the time while they wait, it very conveniently turns out a race of evil aliens they've fought before are secretly taking over Earth. One of whom is secretly a powerful and respected business mogul (but he has an eye patch so you automatically know he's really a bad guy). And not only are there a race of evil aliens to contend with, the ruthless leader of an Ebil Gubmint agency's out to get them too. The alien heroes don't even use their real names, they immediately start using the ones Stan makes up for them when he decides to launch a new comic book about them.

Which kind of leads up to the most unique thing about the movie, which is that Stan Lee himself is a character in it, hanging out with a group of actual (if bland) super-heroes. Beyond that, the trite plot, the generic characters (including some unjustly accused not-really bad guys), the contrived villains, it's like Stan's relying on the exact same tricks that worked when he was a daring young artist and still expecting them to work now. Despite 5 decades of countless other peoples' work changing the medium, the expectations of audiences being different now, etc.

It's all so flat, so dull, lifeless. This is supposed to be the first in a trilogy, maybe they were hoping to get all the boring setup out of the way and flesh things out in the sequel, but why should I care about the sequel when the first movie gives me no reason to be excited about this story?",1406246400,,1927,4.437853107344632
