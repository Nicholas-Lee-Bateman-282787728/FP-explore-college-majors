While I eventually grew weary of DBZ's pension for protracted battles and ""power up"" sequences, I found its precursor series, ""Dragonball"", far more rewarding.

I didn't start out watching the Dragonball series because it was difficult, and expensive, to watch before it made its way to TV. So, I made due with the movies, of which ""Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle"" was my favorite. What makes Dragonball work is the wild, absurdist sense of humor that permeates the show and beautifully showcases the oddball gallery of characters. ""Dragonball"" isn't memorable because of intricate plots, it's the characters that make the show great and Akira's deft humorous touches highlight them well.

This self-contained movie is a strange mix of horror, adventure and humor that uses the series as a jumping off point for a fun little adventure. Goku and Krillin star in his one and the character's chemistry makes the movie's goofy plot stay afloat. The only caution I should give is that the dubbing on this release does not use the same actors as the popular dubs from TV, and that took me aback at first. Even so, that little hiccup shouldn't diminish enthusiasm for this fun little movie.",1408752000,,1432,4.9625

The moive is mostly about the tortutment saga except the begianing is longer. Goku shows up at Roushis place asking him to train him in martial arts so he can beacome a good fighter. But then kurrin  shows up asking him to train him too. So Roushi makes them go on a task to find a princess and whoever brings her back will get to be trained. Goku plays fair and can win it. But after one secould of the race kurrin is already cheating. Later Bulma, Yamcha, Puar, and Oloung show up and want to see Goku Roushi tells them that he has sent them on a task to get the princess and the gang goes to tag aloung. But on the way Goku and Kurrin will learn that team work might be the only way to win this game ans save there lives! The reason I gave it 4 stars is beacuse Goku and Bulmas voices were just not right and made the moive fell a little less dragon ball. Over all it's alright.",1142812800,,988,3.9648241206030153
