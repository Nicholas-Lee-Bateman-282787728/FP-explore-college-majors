1846775,4,B00008H2H4,If you are a DAC fan you gotta have this. Just wished that when they mixed it the lead guitar had more volume.,1127347200,,110,3.8260869565217392
1846776,5,B00008H2H4,"I have about 40 music DVDs, including rock, country, bluegrass and blues. This one is the best. I have watched this DVD (according to DAC it means Drunk Very Drunk) about 20 times in the last five months. The music is great and the crowd is so into it. They know the words to the songs and just when to hoot, holler, gesticulate, etc. I envy those who were at that show. David Allan Coe is in top form here. I love all the name dropping. DAC is obviously a very smart guy who knows exactly what he is doing as a showman, and of course as a songwriter. (I bet there are incidences where people have underestimated his shrewdness to their own detriment.) The most important comment I could make to a potential buyer is that it's a real cultural thing. People of a narrow city-folk mind probably won't get it. Too bad for them. The last two tracks alone are worth the five star rating...and that's just for the shock value they provide. A note worthy of mention is about the production quality of this DVD. The camera work is very good, the editing is superb, and the sound (especially the DTS soundtrack) is outstanding. Hat's off the David Allan Coe and to Billy Bob's Texas.",1090800000,18,1174,4.389908256880734
1846777,5,B00008H2H4,This is a great DVD and if you love real Country you should get this now! DAC is a performer like no other and the interview segment is riveting!,1074211200,,145,4.0344827586206895
1846778,5,B00008H2H4,"There's a little bit of everything on this DVD.  Mr. Coe starts out solo with a gritty, touching ballad ""Heaven Only Knows"", and then goes through warm country staples, like Waylon Jennings ""Storms Never Last""...and ultimately into his biker anthems and some rowdy blues...even a bluegrass number complete with banjo.  Like I said, a little bit of everything.
The band in this one features a more polished lead guitarist than the ""Biketoberfest"" CD release from last year.
For the ladies out there - don't judge a book by it's cover.  If you can get past the facade you'll find an amazing songwriter.",1072828800,,600,4.862745098039215
1846779,5,B00008H2H4,"The only thing I can say is BUY IT ! You will not be disappointed. It's Excellent ! Too bad he isn't respected more for his contribution to country music. He's put in alot more years into country music then all these new people that they play over and over on the radio! He was 62 when this was made. He will be like Waylon & Johnny and they will give him his 5 minutes on the radio when he passes and say how great he was, but never played their songs. Oh I forgot I was talking about DAC, maybe they won't give him his 5 minutes of fame !!!!!!!!",1070236800,9,547,3.936936936936937
1846780,5,B00008H2H4,David allen coe is the greatest country singer of all time. A must for true country fans. Forget that whimpy countery they play on the radio today if u like country u willl luv this dvd,1056240000,4,185,4.166666666666667
1846781,5,B00008H2H4,"I have been a David Allan Coe fan for many years.  My wife, however, could be best described as very much a non-fan!  I convinced her to sit down and watch and listen to this DVD and by the time it was over, she was converted.  If you like outlaw country, the blues or just plain old rock and roll, this is a very good DVD.",1053475200,10,323,3.8636363636363638

1846813,5,B00008H2H4,we like DA Coe we saw him in Spanaway WA HE WAS GOOD We had a blast. Wish he'd started a bit earlier as it was hard to hear through the chanting DAVID ALLAN COE over n over,1357084800,,172,3.5526315789473686

1846817,5,B00008H2H4,I purchased this DVD about a month ago. I have watched I several times since. The songs are great and video quality is excellent. It's a must have for any David Allan Coe fan!,1283644800,2,175,4.176470588235294
1846818,5,B00008H2H4,"The following is a review I wrote for the CD version. There is only a few differences.
1. The track listing is slightly differnt, although both contain the same songs, just in a little different order.

2. The DVD contains a bonus interview with DAC, which is very cool.

3. The DVD has a little more between-song banter.

NOTE: There is a Cd/DVD combo version available, I don't know if that has the entire concert--it is not listed that way on Amazon. Buyer beware.

I am a recently converted DAC fan. For the last 25+ years of my life I have hated country music and have been a die hard Heavy metal/hard rock fan.

I had heard the x-rated stuff a long time ago, but that's not my thing. And it's a very poor representation of DAC.

My second exposure to DAC was on Rebel Meets Rebel, the DAC/Pantera collaboration. Now that was up my alley! Being a long-time fan of Southern Rock, especially the harder variety i.e. Molly Hatchet, that album really got me interested in the man, David Allan Coe.

This CD, Live at Billy Bob's Texas, is my very first DAC cd. I took a chance on it, not really knowing any of the songs or having read any reviews on it. I had a choice between this one and a few greatest hits CDs. Not being a country fan, the only song I had ever heard was Take this job...So my election to buy this CD instead of one of the Greatest Hits CDs was based on
1. My love of live albums (hoping it would have the live ""energy"" that makes a great live album.

2. The fact that it had more songs (20 tracks incl. most of the ""hits"" listed on the other CDs) It also had ""Nothin to Lose"" from Rebel Meets Rebel.

3. The album cover, depicting a heavily tattooed, long-haired guy with beads in his beard and a Washburn Rebel Flag guitar. (I figured if any of those CDs was going to be like the Pantera collaboration it would be this one!)

Well it's not a Heavy Metal album, but I'm not disappointed either. This Cd is freakin awesome, it's dominated my CD player for weeks now. Of the 20 songs, there's only a couple I could do without (#1 & #5)and they're not horrible, just a little TOO country for me.

This Cd is so full of heart and soul, very atmospheric. The songs seem as if he's lived every line. (In truth, I bet he has lived most of them).

Highlights include:

#2 Talkin to the blues--cool lead guitar, very bluesy and gritty.
#3 Son of the South--this is Southern Rock party music at its finest.
#4 59 Caddy 57 Chevy--Another cool RnR song about the good ole days.
#8 Nothin to lose--wrote this song with Dimebag and Vinnie from Pantera, this is a more stripped down country/bluegrass version.
#9 Time off for Bad Behavior--This is a great Friday-gettin-off-work song.
#10 & #11 When I was a young man, If that ain't country pt. 2-- These two fit together like a glove, this is REAL.
#17 The Ride--I guess all you Country fans already knew about this song, but it was new to me, and this live version rocks.
#18 Free my Mind--this song is so hilariously cool.
#20 You never even call me by my name--I guess this is another country hit I never knew about, this is a great rousing, live version.

These are just the ones that kind of stick out in my mind right now, the whole CD is great--buy it.

Note: This is DAC live, so be prepared for a little bit of profanity--there is no Parental Advisory label because that is voluntary.",1254355200,2,3350,4.3036565977742445
1846819,5,B00008H2H4,"A must own DVD for any David Allan Coe fans,Watching this 63 yr. old Under rated country Icon, sent chills up my spine, In this incredible peformance, and even brought a tear to my eyes on how under rated and under apreciated he is. This is not one of those DVD's that you watch one time and put away to collect dust, this is something that you'll watch over and over again. Well Im going to close for now, so I can go see what other David Allan Coe DVD's I can buy next....Definitly hooked on COE",1174089600,3,497,4.134020618556701
