7825010,4,6302365791,"I enjoyed this slasher film. It seemed a notch above the others of this type, probably because of the direction and the actors were good. Care was taken to create a forboding suspence to it, and it had an underlying evilness to it. The actors were convincing in their fear. Highly reccomended",1125446400,3,292,4.634615384615385

7825012,4,6302365791,"Hello,
Just thought I'd say thanks to the folks out there who said they  enjoyed my film ""Prom Night 4 - Deliver us from Evil"". I've got a  few more listed films so if you have seen them let me know what you think  and I would be happy to answer any questions.
Thanks, Clay Borris -  Director",968198400,5,292,3.9827586206896552
7825013,3,6302365791,"So we know what to expect from the Prom Night series by now: cheap and  nasty efforts. But this is a lot better than the stupid Prom Night 2 and 3.  It's a pity they hadn't done this one before 2 and 3 because Jonas, the  killer, is pretty cool and he actually has motives for his madness. If he'd  have been in 2 then we would never have heard of Mary Lou (urgh) and this  guy would be the star of the sequels. Am I asking for too much with a  higher body count? Probably. But this is worth a look. Forget 2 and 3 and  pretend they don't exist. Just get this one and the original. You won't be  disappointed.",953942400,5,609,3.9344262295081966
