8289690,5,B001CUB86W,"My husband and I are scuba divers, and like most divers will only get to a fraction of the great places to dive, during our lifetimes. This series, ""Deep Sea Detectives"" allowed us to watch hosts John Chatterton and Richie Kohler as they explored some of the less accessible underwater places, and wrecks, on Earth. This is my favorite episode of the whole series, because it goes to a place very few people have even heard of, let alone visited: the remote Pacific island of Pohnpei. And the mystery they explore there is an archaeological one: who built the megalithic stone structures on this island, and why? If you are fascinated by the well-known mystery of the Easter Island (aka, Rapa Nui) heads, you will enjoy this virtually unknown, but in many ways parallel, mystery.
John Chatterton and Richie Kohler first came to public attention as the divers who solved the mystery of a WWII German U-boat that ""shouldn't have been there"" off the coast of New Jersey, in the book ""Shadow Divers"" (by Robert Kurson). I can highly recommend that book too; and we are very glad that these guys got the chance to explore more underwater mysteries in this series, and share them with us!",1428364800,,1182,4.714975845410628
