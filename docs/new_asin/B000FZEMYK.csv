Read the book Ship of Ghosts for a great account of these brave men.",1480636800,,304,4.446428571428571

8127648,5,B000FZEMYK,"This a great DVD with 1st hand accounts of the sailors who lived through this ordeal. I'm a big World War 2 buff and Read the Book ""Ship of Ghosts"" first and then watchedthe DVD and they are both excellent.",1396137600,2,206,4.175
8127649,3,B000FZEMYK,"The Last Stand is a poor quality DVD, but does include very rare photos and movies of the ship, sometimes without annoying titles popping up over them.  The audio is terrible, so just put your TV on mute until the survivors come on.

Otto Schwartz, Dutch Kooper and other USS Houston sailors, at the time in their later years, are featured in the DVD.  Buy this DVD for the interviews, if you buy it.  ""The Last Battle Station"" by Schultz and ""The Ghost that Died at Sunda Strait"" by Winslow are my recommended reading on the USS Houston.  Winslow also wrote ""The Fleet the Gods Forgot"" as a perspective on the action in the Phillipines in the late months of 1941 and early months of 1942.

For my money, considering all the material available on the USS Houston in the Cruiser Houston collection at the University of Houston, and in the US archives, this DVD was a dissappointment.",1188518400,5,882,4.550632911392405
8127650,5,B000FZEMYK,"This is excellent work providing information about the CA-30.  My dad was survivor and never spoke of it.  This film finally tells the story of the CA-30 and crew.  It contains information you won't find in any history book.  It's an excellent educational piece.  Finally, a piece that tells of history that has been ignored or forgotten.",1166227200,3,338,4.859649122807017
