2602331,5,B000G8NVSY,"I first heard Tom Rush playing ""Urge For Going"" on Jefferson Kaye's radio show, ""Insight Out"", back in the late 1960's, on WKBW radio in Buffalo, New York.  Blown away.

Later on, I bought the ""Circle Game"" LP.  Played it thin.

Many years later, I purchased ""Circle Game"" on CD.  As I listened, I realized that I had always wanted to learn to play ""Rockport Sunday"" on guitar, but could never find the proper tab.

I own other Homespun DVD's; all very well-produced.

This one is fantastic.  Kind-of-like you get the tabs with a personal ~2 hour guitar lesson with Tom.

Highly recommended.

Cheers; have to tune the old D-28 to a C-tuning...

2602332,5,B000G8NVSY,"Veteran folk singer/songwriter/guitarist Tom Rush delivers

""noteworthy"" versions of ten prime songs from his vast repertoire. This instructional DVD has full length performances

of each song: 1} No Regrets 2} Rockport Sunday {instrumental}

3} River Song 4] Urge for Going 5} Circle Game 6} Child's Song

7} Moles Moan {instrumental} 8} Panama Limited 9} Diamond

Joe & 10} Drop Down Mama. Tom offers instructional tips following

each selection. The first three songs are Rush originals. Tom

interprets two Joni Mitchell songs {""Circle Game & ""Urge for

Going""} which he popularized well before Joni was well known.

These interpretations are stunning and render the songs golden

classics. He also displays his guitar prowess, with crisp renditions of ""Mole's Moan"" and the epic train song, ""Panama Limited"". Tom employs intricate bottleneck technique on the

latter. He revives an old traditional song, ""Diamond Joe"", which

dates back to his 1963 recording. Tne new rendition is quite

inspired with its affecting melody, catchy guitar treatment

and engaging lyrics. The selections are very impressive

highlights of his career. Both the audio and video quality are

top-notch. The viewing experience is the closest approximation of

hearing Tom perform solo.",1151625600,15,1267,5.481865284974093

8129441,5,B000G8NVSY,"Tom Rush doesn't seem to have an ounce of pretention. Instead, he finds songs that touch the listener, and puts his laconic style on them. I used to use ""The Urge for Goin"" in my high school English poetry classes every November. Its great to hear him talk about how these favorites came to him and how they are played. And that wonderful old war horse of a guitar has a beauty that could have only been earned! Tommy, if the Smithsonian asks for it, put it in your will so that a grateful nation should see it - holes, repairs, and all! If, like me, you're just starting to learn acoustic guitar, don't be intimidated. Getting to where he's gotten to takes time and perseverance. You can do it! Let this video be a springboard for your own practice sessions!",1389052800,,759,4.390070921985815
8129442,5,B000G8NVSY,My husband and I love Tom's music and the Rockport Sunday instrumental is one of our most favorite. So he's working hard on learning how to play it and retuned his guitar to the special key that it needs.,1388880000,,204,4.256410256410256
8129443,5,B000G8NVSY,"I bought this for my father.  It was the best gift I ever got him and it didn't cost much.  Tom Rush does a great job showing techniques that help out the beginner and can also give insight to the experienced guitar player.

8129444,5,B000G8NVSY,"For Tom Rush fans or Tom Rush song fans or wannabe folk guitarists, this is a must.

He is so self-deprecating and personal in the stories he tells along with the instructions he gives this DVD is a real winner whether you are trying to learn
how he plays or gain insight into this great artist.

Enjoy.",1250899200,,303,4.298245614035087
8129445,5,B000G8NVSY,"Having been a Tom Rush fan since the late 60's and always wanting to learn how to play several of the songs covered, (especially Mole's Moan) I was eager to check out his DVD. To my delight the codes were broken along with all the other things that make his style unique. It finished by a hilarious song (The Remember Song) which now as I approach 60 I can really relate to.  For all the folkies out there this is a must buy.",1234656000,3,425,4.120481927710843
8129446,5,B000G8NVSY,"For whatever reason, I grew up not having ever heard Tom Rush.  I don't know his songs at all; yet, upon hearing a clip of the DVD for guitar instruction, the entire DVD is wonderfully put together; as is the norm for Homespun.  Tom is an excellent teacher; easy going, moves at a pace students can follow; has a beautiful voice, and an excellent demeanor.  This is no prima donna condenscending to us to share his immense talent.  This is a man who seems to still enjoy the music and enjoy sharing it with us.  Very impressive.",1210636800,4,528,4.402061855670103
8129447,5,B000G8NVSY,"Several great old songs from my past, taught by the very guy who brought them to me. It turns out he is also an excellent instructor, with lots of patience, a good sense of humor, and the willingness to share his own personal performance techniques. I wish there were more DVDs like this, from the original artists. I would buy several.",1179014400,6,336,4.524590163934426
