8379554,5,B002SS3F6I,"I've been a big Manilow fan since the 70's!  Haven't been able to go to a lot of his concerts, so this is great to watch.  He puts on quite a show, they never change, just keep getting better.  Only took a few days after ordering, until I received it.",1393545600,4,251,3.98
8379555,5,B002SS3F6I,"This gem of a concert performed by Barry Manilow is awesome! I saw it when it was shown on HBO in about 1979 or 1980. At the time, HBO was just starting out. The concert really boosted their ratings and subscriber numbers at the time.",1377302400,5,234,4.222222222222222
8379556,5,B002SS3F6I,"I was happy to see this released, as it was only previously available on LaserDisc and VHS.  They did some moderate remastering, nothing heavy, but they also left the concert virtually untouched which is rare these days!!  A great treat for Barry fans or anyone else interested in seeing him during the late 70s when he had huge hits and was just starting to gain confidence (and money) to make his shows a bit more ""produced""... the version of then-new ""Copacabana"" on this tour is a classic... but there are plenty of Barry-staple moments from behind the piano or atop a stool that balance everything out well.  A few moments that were carry-overs from previous tours, such as the Jump Shout Boogie Medley, seem a tad stale, but they are still delivered well and are overshadowed by his light-hearted banter and, of course, the fact that we can SEE them instead of just listening.  The ""Here We Go Again"" opener is a great rarity and some of the ballads in this set, most notably ""Looks Like We Made It"", are outstanding.  The audio track sounds great and is pretty well-balanced, if a bit treble-heavy, especially given its age.  Packaging and DVD authoring is top-notch.",1325030400,9,1174,4.730392156862745
8379557,1,B002SS3F6I,Was excited to find this concert in the height of his career.  This DVD will not play in the eastern United States.  This was a waste of money.  Ask this question before purchasing.,1316476800,,181,4.424242424242424
