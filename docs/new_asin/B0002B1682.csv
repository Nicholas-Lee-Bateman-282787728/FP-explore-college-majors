2073678,5,B0002B1682,"I love all the Bratz movies, but I think this one will always be my favorite. Sasha isn't as self-absorbed and Cloe isn't a drama queen (except for maybe that one part where *spoiler* Cameron blames her for the bad things the gossip column said about him */end spoiler*).

This movie is about how the girls need to do a project on self-expression, but it's prom week so of course they need to figure out how to make prom a part of the assignment. However, their friendship is put to the test when a gossip column is put up in the paper. The DVD comes with a purse, but the VHS doesn't. The DVD has several bonus features, including a deleted scene called ""The Haunted Elm"".

I wish they had continued in this direction. No Burdine, no tweevils, no self-absorbed Sasha, no drama queen Cloe. And the animation in this movie is better. Like I said, I love all the Bratz movies, but this will always be my favorite for those reasons.",1341964800,,929,4.395348837209302
2073679,5,B0002B1682,"My daughters love love love the Bratz series, books, dvd's and dolls. We have each of the Bratz movies, I found them all on Amazon.com for the most part. Each story has great characters, storyline, and music, very entertaining to the kids.  Believe it or not, the Bratz are actually positive girls and spread the message of being about good friends, helping each other and others, and about being confident in yourself and all that you can be and do.  They like to be creative from singing,dancing,acting, or running their own magazine or forming a band each Bratz movie has the girls actively taking part in doing things big and living life to the fullest with best friends always there.

This story they meet Katia, a girl with special genie powers who can grant wishes but only for good.  She however just wants to be free to be a normal teenage girl. She and her father work for what they believe is a government agency doing good and find out actually they are criminals. Together the Bratz Girls find a way to help free their friend and her father before the world is taken over and held captive by these villians.",1290816000,,1120,4.557213930348259

2073687,5,B0002B1682,"My daughter and I loved this Bratz adventure. I've been a fan of all things genie since I was a kid and first watched ""I Dream of Jeannie"", so I really love the theme. We have the whole set of dolls from this Genie Magic series. They're all very pretty and have great costumes. I love the way these movies are animated because it really looks like the dolls. I won't bother rehashing the plot because you can read that on the product description page, but I will say that it was a very good story and lots of fun to watch. Many of the kids DVDs and videos are not written to be enjoyed by adults, but the Bratz series is. Even friends with no kids have enjoyed this DVD with us. This is a story about parents learning to let go, as much as its a story about a magical genie. Very well done.",1181865600,,790,4.07051282051282

2073704,3,B0002B1682,"My daughter discovered Bratz about a year ago, and I immediately tried to discourage her interest. Barbies are one thing, but Bratz are simply hoochie-mamas designed to influence little girls into wearing clothes that are simply innapropriate. That being said though, I totally get the appeal for the younger girls. Fashion, a little romance--it's all very tres chic. Doesn't mean I have to like it, though.

She loved it, of course, when they came out with Bratz Babyz, so we had to watch the movie. On its own merits, the movie is pretty cute. The girls lose their dog at the mall, where they're pursued by an older bully, a security guard, and the baby-care center director. Except for the plot, though, this movie loses serious points with me. The Bratz Babyz go around in belly button-baring shirts and diapers! That's it! Where the heck are their clothes? Teen hoochie-mamas are one thing; baby hoochie-mamas are just plain scary.

Overall, sure, the movie is a cute one for the little girls to watch once. After that, besides just getting on your nerves, this one can go back to the video rental store.",1179100800,,1109,4.770833333333333

Latest Indian trends especially.  The graphics are good, and the ending is encouraging.  Good prevails and the world is a safe place again.  Very entertaining and worth the money in my opinion.

2073714,3,B0002B1682,"I don't understand why the ""babyz"" have to run around in their underwear, especially since they are so focused on fashion.  I thought, ""Maybe they'll get dressed later"".  Then the twin girls in the day care had cute little skirts on.  Why didn't they put skirts or shorts on the other ""babyz""?  I guess I don't get it.

But with that being said, my daughter (5) loves this movie.  It's really her style.  She a tom boy but enjoys nail polish and cutesie clothes.  I've tried to keep her away from Bratz for the last couple of years.  Out of no where yesterday she mentioned she wanted a Bratz doll for her birthday.  So now she's beginning to show interest.  I'm a bit concerned because of the ""half naked"" dolls.

The girls in the movie try to encourage the twins to not fight and to be nice to eachother.  That's why I have hope that the ""personalities"" of Bratz will encourage positive behaviors for the young girls growing up.

I think this will be a hard one to take back to the video store.  She just might have a meltdown.  Oh, and did I mention the pets in the movie are so cute?",1162598400,3,1087,4.280788177339901

2073746,4,B0002B1682,"Cloe, Yasmin, Jade, and Sasha are getting ready for the best prom EVER!  But a newly assigned school project about ""self-expression"" sticks them with a heavy load, and the girls are wondering if they'll be able to ace the project AND have a rockin' prom.  When it's finally decided that the girls will take turns filming their preparations for prom and day-to-day lives for the project, the girls are thrilled that things are working out.  Will the prom be the best ever, as the girls dream it will be?  Or will the new gossip columnist ruin the prom AND their friendships?

First off, let me just say that after watching this movie, I couldn't help smiling at how odd it was to see characters that I'm so used to giving a personality to, with their own personalities.  But I still liked the personalities that were given to them!  Well, all except for Cloe, anyway.  She was conceited and a little bit stuck up sometimes.  The only personality that never sickened me once was Sasha's.  She was cool!  Anyway, this was a good movie, considering that it's based on dolls.  It was longer than the ""My Scene"" movie (a rip-off forty-some minutes) lasting for one hour and one minute.  The animation seemed lame at first, but it was better after getting used to it.  The movie was sickening in some parts (ex: Jade is afraid she's losing her ""fashion sense"") and the movie was almost more like a long episode of a T.V. show than an actual movie, but I say that it's worth renting, especially if your child, sister, etc. is not old enough to realize that some parts are cheesy, or if you don't mind, yourself.  The bonus features were cool, although I highly recommend that you don't let little ones watch the deleted scene, because it was surprisingly creepy.  (I was watching it in the dark, too!)  The dress-up game was basically just the game off the website, the karaoke looked uninteresting, and the music video was boring, but the horoscope was okay, and the trivia was sort of fun.  I guess I just think that the special features were nice because it's just a shorter-than-most-movies-and-never-been-in-theaters DVD, and to have all of those bonuses is a big extra.  Overall, I say rent the movie, like I did!  It was good, but unless you have a younger child who adores it, it's not worth buying.",1117324800,6,2299,4.615763546798029
2073747,5,B0002B1682,"This movie is great for the following reasons:

2073758,1,B0002B1682,"This movie wasted an hour of my life and made me dumber in the process. Me and my friend rented the video as a treat for her little sister who was eager to see it. We sat down and watched it to find that it was complete nonsense. It was certainly not ""funk-a-lish"" as Cloe said. The car accident scene scared her and she thought the gang was seriously hurt. And tell me who misakes a skunk for a cat! Really People! And how are they wearing sun glasses with no noses! Also the clothes were extreamly inappropriate! And poor Jade got insulted for picking out an appropriate outfit! Also one of the Bratz semi betrays her frends and they take her back! Making children believe that you can betray your friends and they'll just forgive you. My advice, this movie is not entertainment. My friend's sister who is obsessed with Bratz even thought it was completley mindless. If we could rate it -5 we would. So don't waste your money.",1105315200,9,928,4.432748538011696

2073761,4,B0002B1682,My 6 & 4 year old girls love it! They especially like the part when the prom king & queen are announced.  They had fun seeing all their dolls in the movie. I would recommend this movie for any girl who likes Bratz dolls!,1095465600,2,220,4.0
2073772,5,B0002B1682,"My five year old has been a Bratz fan since she was practically a toddler, so when she saw the commercial for their first movie, she almost hyperventilated!  Needless to say, it is now a part of our collection, and is probably the most watched DVD she has...even more than the Barbie movies she loves so much.

The animation is very clear and the storyline is typical teen angst...Yasmin, Jade, Cloe, and Sasha are assigned a project that may clash with their plans to get ready for the prom.  When certain Bratz secrets are revealed in the course of the assignment and published for all to see, one of them is falsely accused and the arguments begin.  Dana and Nevra also make cameo appearances during the course of the movie.

I've been kind of love/hate about the Bratz because of their too sultry appearance, sexy clothes, virtual lack of noses, and feet that pop off, but my daughter is enthralled with them, and seeing as Barbie hasn't had any major lasting negative effects on my life, I'll go with the flow of the new generation of dolls!

Since we've gotten the Bratz movie, she's probably watched it 3 or 4 times per week...definitely worth our investment.",1094083200,15,1166,4.635922330097087

If your a Bratz fan, this is a great buy. The only part that bothered me is that there is no parental control, as if these 16 years olds live on there own. Well, it is their movie debut, so I guess you can't ask for much, after all, did we ever see Barbie's parents...?

If your child is really into Bratz, trust me, they will get a kick out of this movie, and hopefully more will follow. Great dvd extras to enjoy. It's basically the 4 friends  being teenagers, having fun, and learning a lesson along the way. Hope this helped! Have fun!",1091836800,7,696,4.148148148148148

I was forced to watch this video with my twin tweens (who are still in the hospital and in desperate need of entertainment on a 24/7 basis) and i am surprised to say that I loved it!  It was very, very funny.  The kind of movie that is smart enough to entertain the parents while giving the kiddies a really good time.  Although I find the Bratz dolls somewhat frightening (they do look a bit 'loose', don't they?), I must recommend this film highly to anyone with kids - or anyone, really.  You will be surprised by the level of entertainment.  All credit must go to the screenwriters, I think.
