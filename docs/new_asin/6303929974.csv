734514,4,6303929974,"This story revolves around a girl (Deanna Durbin) who happens to witness what looks like a murder outside of her train window. However, the girl was reading a murder mystery novel on the train, and one suspects that her accusations may be the result of an active imagination. The police suspect the same thing, which forces her to go to the only other source of help she knows, the author of the murder mystery novel. This film is much more comical than thrilling fueled by the girl's eccentricity, but it is no less entertaining.

Deanna Durbin is stunningly beautiful in this film. Her blonde hair shines in the soft lighting and she is obviously more grown up than in most of her films. She is still impulsive and charming, but her hair-brained schemes are executed with a subtle maturity. For once, Durbin looks like a gorgeous glamour girl of the era instead of a child star.

The songs in this film are unusual for a Durbin film. Most of her songs in other films are quite juvenile like Judy Garland's, but those in this film are ones you might expect any adult to sing in a film. ""Silent Night"" is a song that is sung over a telephone. It is filed in soft lighting with Durbin's hair cascading over the bed like the glamorous Rita Hayworth. Although it is beautifully sung, the transition from dialogue to song is not very smooth. The next song is by far the best even though the title would suggest it is silly. ""Gimmie A Little Kiss, Will You Huh?"" is sung with the suggestiveness of a Marilyn Monroe song. The song is languid and underplayed. Needless to say, it is quite unlike anything one might expect from Durbin, but she does it so well, one wonders why these types of songs did not continue. The last song is ""Night and Day,"" a standard of the era. It employs some of Durbin's operatic training and is not as outstanding as the previous song, but it is a nice change of pace for the star.",1128211200,,1904,4.45272206303725
734515,4,6303929974,"A gem of a comedy who-done-it, with 3 or 4 great songs beautifully performed by Deanna Durbin.  The comedy and music don't interfere with the suspense that effectively leads to a surprise ending.  There are a lot of familiar faces giving very good performances, including Ralph Bellamy (Ellery Queen, Trading Places), Dan Duryea (Black Angel, Scarlet Street), Allen Jenkins (Five Came Back), Edward Everett Horton (Top Hat, Pocketful of Miracles), William Frawley (I Love Lucy, My Three Sons) and Samuel S. Hinds.  In one scene that stands out Durbin inadvertently prevents thug Allen Jenkins from ambushing her, with her beautiful rendition of Silent Night over the phone to her father.  If you're old enough to remember, or if you're just into old movies enough to recognize any of the names here, this is one you'll want to check out.",1115596800,,837,5.0
734516,5,6303929974,"This film is a Christmas snowflake from the wonderful Deanna Durbin. She may have saved Universal from bankruptcy as a young musical sensation in the late 1930's, but by the mid 1940's she had matured into a pleasantly gorgeous actress who made several memorable light comedies. This breezy murder mystery is one of her best. The entire film takes place over the Christmas weekend and it is snowing in almost every shot, making a marvelous backdrop to this fun film.

Nikki Collins (Deanna) is on a train bound for New York for the holidays. While reading a mystery by her favorite author, Wayne Morgan (David Bruce), she witnesses the murder of Josiah Warring from the window of her compartment. When no one will believe her, she hunts down mystery writer Morgan and slowly drags him into her enthusiastic search for the killer. He is engaged to a rather stuffy society babe, and we know right away that he and Durbin will end up together before the final curtain.

The murdered man was a rich shipping magnate and when Durbin attempts to snoop around the tycoon's mansion she is mistaken by nephew Arnold (Dan Duryea) for Margo Martin, the nightclub singer to whom Josiah has left everything, much to the chagrin of everyone. This gives Durbin an opportunity to go to the nightclub and do some amateur detective work, as well as do a sexy rendition of ""Give Me a Little Kiss, Will Ya?"" and the lovely ""Night and Day"" while she pretends to be Margo.

The real Margo gets murdered, of course, as does the owner of the swanky nightclub. And everyone seems to be after those blood stained slippers Nikki has found which prove the tycoon was really murdered. David Bruce does a nice job as the mystery writer Morgan as does Duryea as the black sheep of the family. Ralph Bellamy is fine as the good nephew. Edward Everett Horten gives a very funny performance as Mr. Haskell, who has been instructed to keep an eye on Durbin by her father, which proves to be a nearly impossible task!

This is an entertaining muder mystery that is a lot of fun to watch. Deanna Durbin and the great cast make this film light and airy. She married director Charles David II later on and maybe that's part of the happiness you feel from the screen. We get to watch a glowing Durbin solve a murder, fall in love and sing some nice songs, all during a snowy Christmas weekend. What could be wrong with that?",1112313600,13,2384,4.576112412177986
734517,1,6303929974,"Sappy and soporific, this attempt at seriocomic film noir is like a nightmare that rambles senselessly hither and yon, engulfing the viewer in a morass of near surreality of silliness!  One could well imagine Abbott and Costello showing up at any moment!
Why Deanna Durbin's comedic and musical talents were plastered onto such a plot is a mystery, especially since the story spasmodically struggles to rise above the manic stooginess of it all.  Some of the actors actually manage to perform unscathed by the flakiness--particulary Dan Duryea, who serves as a painful reminder of what the film could have been.  Most, however, are utterly wasted--including a white cat lugged listlessly about by one villain.

I saw this movie when it appeared in DEANNA DURBIN'S SWEETHEART COLLECTION, which I bought years ago. I've come to think of this movie partly as a CHRISTMAS MOVIE because it takes place during THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. Actually it's a WHO DONE IT. Nikki Collins (Deanna) travels to New York, on a train, to visit her Aunt Martha (who never materializes). She's reading a Mystery Novel and when the train slows down, she casually looks out the window and witnesses a murder, in a room, in a building, directly across from where the train had slowed down. The comedy then begins when she tries to report the murder. First she goes to the police, but she isn't believed because she tells the officer that she lives in SAN FRANCISCO. She tries again to tell him that it took place there in New York but the officer sees the Mystery Novel that she is reading and dismisses her. After she makes her way back to where she was staying, she tries to enlist the help of the Mystery Writer Wayne Morgan, (David Bruce), much to the annoyance of his fiancee, Joyce Williams (Patricia Morison). Nikki gets her hands on a pair of bedroom slippers, which the murdered victim had been wearing when he got murdered. She is then pursued because of them. After Wayne finds his way to the place where Nikki impersonates Margo Martin, (Maria Palmer), a singer at THE CIRCUS CLUB, she confronts Margo about the money she is to inherit from Josiah Waring's will (Thurston Hall). Nikki gets rid of Margo, by locking her into the closet and then takes her place on the stage. All of the key players also wind up at THE CIRCUS CLUB because one of them murdered Josiah. Wayne is attacked and locked in the wine cellar. He gets out and warns Nikki that the murderer is sitting at the table where she is.

The murderer then begins killing off some of the other suspects, killing Mr. Saunders, (George Coulouris) at the club. When the police arrive at the club, Nikki and Wayne get out of there quick, but not before she gets her hands, again, on the slippers. She, of course can't go back to her place because she would be found there, so she spends the night at Wayne's apartment, with Wayne on the sofa. The next day Miss Fletcher, (Jacqueline DeWitt), Wayne's Secretary, Maxwell, (Ben Carter), Wayne's House Assistant, and Mr. Haskell, (Edward Everett Horton) all show up at Wayne's apartment, which puts Nikki in another comedy of errors. Then the police shows up with Danny, (Allen Jenkins), a thug for Mr. Saunders, and accuses Wayne, because the police finds Wayne's overcoat at the club, which Danny had taken off of him earlier in the movie. Wayne and Nikki are then carted off to jail, accused of murdering Mr. Saunders. Nikki comes up with a way to solve the crime. She tells Wayne to confess, then the police will let her go, then she will solve the murder, and Wayne will then be set free. But then Mr. Haskell shows up and bails her out of jail. Mr. Haskell gets into a riff with the photographers and Nikki goes off with Arnold Waring, (Dan Duryea), who starts questioning her about the murder. She tells him that she saw it. He then takes her to the office. But there isn't anyone there, so she gets scared and runs off. She is soon rescued by Jonathan Waring, (Ralph Bellamy), who takes her into a room that she soon realizes is the very room where Josiah Waring was murdered. Then Arnold shows up to rescue her from Jonathan but then is mistaken to be the murderer by Wayne. Wayne, Nikki, and Arnold are then all at risk of being murdered by Jonathan. Wayne bluffs Jonathan by claiming the police was outside. The police does show up, much to Jonathan's shock and he faints.

Wayne and Nikki gets married and are traveling on a train. Nikki is reading another Mystery Novel, which Wayne wrote. He wants her to put the book down so he tells her that the man in the green hat Did It. Nikki pretends that she is upset then rings for the porter. THE END

THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DEANNA DURBIN MOVIES. IF SHE WERE ALIVE, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN 94 YEARS OLD TODAY. BECAUSE I LIKE HER SO MUCH, I'VE DECIDED TO ADD ""LADY ON A  TRAIN' AS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TO WATCH FILMS AT CHRISTMAS TIME. AFTER ALL, SHE DOES SING ""SILENT NIGHT"".

THIS IS AN EXTRA: ONE OF MY HOBBIES IS LOOKING UP ACTORS AND ACTRESSES FROM OLD MOVIES AND SHOWS. THE ONLY ACTRESS I FOUND WHO IS IN THIS MOVIE AND IS STILL ALIVE IS PATRICIA MORISON, (JOYCE WILLIAMS, WAYNE'S FIANCEE). SHE WAS BORN ON MARCH 19, 1915. WOW! SCOTT FEINBERG INTERVIEWED HER LAST YEAR.

734741,4,6303929974,"LADY ON A TRAIN is a dizzying blend of young, blonde Deanna Durbin watching a murder take place in a tenement through a window with shades drawn while the train is stopped at 125th Street on its way to Grand Central Station and three songs: ""Silent Night,"" ""Gimme a Little Kiss"" and Cole Porter's fabulous ""Night & Day"" which she sings mostly in an anonymous New York nightclub.

Almost single-handedly, she discovers who the murderer is as well as the love of her life (David Bruce) and is off on a honeymoon, once again on a train travelling away from New York.

Ralph Bellamy, Patricia Morrison and Edward Everett Horton provide ample support for the child star turned adult in one of her last films for Universal before marrying her director, Charles David and spending the rest of her life in France.

My only problem with this disc was that the seller sold me a Region 2 standard DVD, playable only in ""Japan, Europe, South Africa and the Middle East, including Egypt"" which I sent back to the seller for a refund on advice from Amazon.  Consequently, I had to watch the film on a Region 1 disc borrowed from a friend.  This is the first and only time I had this experience with a disc clearly marked Region 2 on its back cover and discovered why it was unwatchable on 2 DVD players I own.  With help from Amazon, I discovered the truth about Region 2, so buyers, beware.  I assume the seller will make good on a refund to me in the near future. I purchased this DVD through Amazon.

But the film is worthwhile as a child singing-star transitions to a young woman who uncovers the murderer in a film noir that was the predominant style of film in 1945.  I'd highly recommend it if you have never seen Deanna Durbin in a musical and now a mystery.",1370649600,4,1752,4.433021806853582

734744,3,6303929974,"Lady on a Train (1945) Mystery loving Nikki Collins (Deanna Durbin) witnesses a murder in a building outside her train window, then can't convince anyone she saw it in this entertaining comedy mystery. When she can't get the police to believe her, (they think the death was an accident) she turns to mystery writer Wayne Morgan (David Bruce) but he is also skeptical. Nikki then mixes herself up with the dead man's family (including Ralph Bellamy-Trading Places) to try to prove there was a murder, even as the murderer continues to kill, making each murder look like an accident. This is a very entertaining blend of comedy and mystery, which was a vehicle to move singing star Durbin away from the romantic musicals she was hugely popular in. To ease the transition Durbin does sing three songs, which are spaced out well and aren't too obtrusive. The mystery is fun, there is some suspense, and Durbin is a very attractive lead. If you like a good old fashioned movie that throws in a little of everything to entertain, this is a safe bet.",1229126400,,1043,4.704918032786885
734745,4,6303929974,"Another radical change-of-pace for the rapidly maturing songbird Deanna Durbin, LADY ON A TRAIN (1945) was directed by her future husband Charles David.  This entertaining murder mystery, with liberal doses of comedy (and chances for Durbin to belt out a few choice musical numbers) is a winner all the way!

Young socialite Nikki Collins (Deanna Durbin) witnesses a man being murdered from her train window.  When the police refuse to believe her, Nikki decides to take action herself, enlisting the help of her favourite mystery author Wayne Morgan (David Bruce).  Later becoming mixed up with the family of the deceased, Nikki assumes the identity of a glamorous nightclub singer in order to track down the killer.

Deanna Durbin in a film noir mystery?!  It happened in LADY ON A TRAIN, one of the most entertaining of all the movies Durbin starred during her Hollywood career.  Of course, the nightclub scenes allows Durbin to cut loose with sizzling numbers like ""Night and Day"".  Durbin's co-stars include Ralph Bellamy, Dan Duryea, Edward Everett Horton and Patricia Morison.  David Bruce, who plays the hapless mystery writer, also co-starred with Deanna the same year in ""Can't Help Singing"", her first and only Technicolor movie appearance.

LADY ON A TRAIN is definitely on the short-list of the all time best Deanna Durbin movies.",1211068800,,1343,5.1192660550458715
734746,3,6303929974,"""Lady on a Train"" is a comic mystery starring singer/actress Deanna Durbin, who was a sensationally popular star of the 1930s and 1940s before retiring from show business in 1949 at the age of 27. The film may be of mild interest to film noir fans since it is a noir spoof, but this is primarily a lighthearted comedy that showcases Ms. Durbin's unaffected manner and singing talent.

Nikki Collins (Deanna Durbin), a young society woman, witnesses a man being murdered from the window of her train as she is arriving in New York to spend the holidays with her aunt. After having no success convincing the conductor or the police to take the matter seriously, Nikki decides to enlist the aid of Wayne Morgan (David Bruce), a mystery novelist whose books she adores. Her persistence isn't getting her far when she sees a newsreel about the man she saw murdered. He was Josiah Waring, a wealthy ship-building magnate, who is reported to have died accidentally. She visits the Warings' Long Island estate in search of clues, where she is mistaken for the dead man's torch singer fiance by half of his family and suspected of being trouble by the other half. Now the murderers are on to her, the relatives believe she's someone she's not, and Mr. Morgan is annoyed but intrigued.

Nikki's actions don't make much sense, but her plucky, mischievous, slightly bubble-headed persona are supposed to charm the audience as they charm the handsome Mr. Morgan. ""Lady on a Train"" is very much in the style of 1940s light comedy. The writing is not great. The personalities and comic situations are the entertainment. It either works for you or it doesn't. I think ""Lady on a Train"" would have benefitted from better dialogue, and I find the Nikki character a bit grating. But Deanna Durbin does sing three times, so this is a nice film for her fans. The story takes place on a snowy Christmas Eve in New York, so it's a fun Christmas film as well if you want something insubstantial.",1129593600,2,1971,4.69364161849711
7856184,4,6303929974,"I've seen a few instances of people calling this a film noir. It isn't.

7856186,4,6303929974,"Deanna Durbin plays Nikki Collins, a young woman who is on a train pulling into New York when she witnesses a murder through the window as it is happening in a building that the train passes.  She reports the crime to the police who don't believe her so she investigates the murder on her own.  Based on this brief description I expected Lady on a Train to be a straight thriller.  It's not.  Actually, Lady on a Train turns out to be a daffy comedy, although it's also surprisingly funny--particularly in the film's first half when Durbin gets the opportunity to show off some unexpected screwball comedy skill.

The reason the police don't believe Nikki is because the desk sergeant sees that she's carrying a lurid murder mystery and assumes she is making the whole thing up.  The author of that mystery happens to live in New York so she tries to enlist his help in proving there was a murder.  When he initially refuses she investigates on her own, getting more entangled than she intended with the murdered man's family through a misunderstanding that becomes harder and harder for her to maintain as the film goes on.

One of the problems with Lady on a Train is that the studio couldn't resist having Durbin sing three songs in their entirety.  Since she was known for musicals the producers probably felt they needed to give the audience what it wanted but in every case the songs stop the flow of the movie dead in its tracks, completely disrupting the film's comic momentum.

Another problem is that the actor who plays the mystery author (David Bruce) is a bit too much of a lightweight to be an effective lead.  He's the kind of actor who should be playing the stuffy boyfriend you don't want the girl to end up with. Bruce is handsome enough but isn't nearly as talented a comic performer as Durbin and isn't much of a romantic lead when his mystery writer eventually realizes he's falling in love with the dizzy blonde who keeps disrupting his life.  I couldn't help thinking that Durbin's Nikki Collins could definitely do better.

The supporting cast makes up partly for the film's weak male lead.  Edward Everett Horton is priceless as the unfortunate man assigned by the New York Office of her father's company to keep an eye on Nikki but who finds himself almost perpetually flabbergasted as she constantly disappears or gets into trouble.  Ralph Bellamy is charming as the smooth Jonathan Waring and tough guy actor Dan Duryea equally effective as brother Arnold Waring--both of whom seem to have taken a shine to Nikki, although it might be because they both mistakenly think she inherited everything in the dead man's will.  But one of those two men is the murderer and Nikki doesn't know which.

If the second half of Lady on a Train were as funny as the first half the film would be much easier to recommend--but the movie becomes less effective as the focus drifts away from Durbin's comic talent and gives her singing and the weak mystery writer character a more prominent place in the proceedings.  But even with some rather frustrating flaws Lady on a Train is more entertaining than not and provides an excellent showcase for Durbin, an actress I've only seen in one other film because I'm not a fan of old Hollywood musicals.  But based on this movie I would definitely be much more inclined to watch another of her films.",1502582400,,3353,4.66213921901528

7856188,1,6303929974,"Ms. Durbin carries this entire movie almost single-handedly.  She does have an able cast supporting her all the way through, no problems there.  But the story...where to begin?  To begin with, this IS a believable idea, a woman riding a train (through Jamaica, NY, I believe), spots a man being murdered in his apartment.  From there, she begins unraveling the plot behind the murder.  This is where the story falls apart, yes, a mere 10 minutes into the film.  The problem with this story is that each part feels contrived on an ever-increasing basis so that by the time the end is nearly reached, the viewer has grown weary of having to keep ""supposing"" for the entire picture, and just wishes the finale would rise up (it doesn't, though, there's still 17 minutes left to the picture).

They used to make pictures like this in the '80's, where the stories were so far-fetched that the viewer was often forced to feign a headache just to be able to politely flee the theater.  Sadly, film writers still haven't learned their lesson, as we occasionally still are asked to sit through some present day film, long past our good natured attention span.  And so, dear reader, I can't recommend you view this film, possibly not even the trailer.  Unless, of course, you have guests you want to get rid of.  In that case, why, just cook up a great big bowl of popcorn and invite them to get comfy.  Meanwhile, you go get their shoes and coats ready for a fast exit.
