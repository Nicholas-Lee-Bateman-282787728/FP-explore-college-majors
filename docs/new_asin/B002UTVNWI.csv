8381543,3,B002UTVNWI,"This British 'road trip' movie has quite a few funny moments, and several interesting storylines evolving within the ensemble cast that unfortunately are never fleshed-out. For much of the film we're left feeling like we've missed the first half of a two-part series, because the characters clearly know each other well, but the audience is left mostly in the dark. There are laughs in this film, just not quite enough to offset the serious bits, which tend to land with a heavy, awkward thud. 3 Stars.",1400889600,,502,4.848837209302325
