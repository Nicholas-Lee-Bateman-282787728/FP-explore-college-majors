They take the material they are riffing and use it as raw material. Only MST3K and its successors had a better handle on the art of the riff.",1470009600,,274,4.288461538461538

At the three minute mark you'll be OK with it because the writers are very funny and they didn't make a MST3K in 3D. The field sequential 3D in this case was filmed with the home format lens so you get great depth but it only pops out a couple of times. Being that this is a for a limited market it's the best we can hope for. The old camp fest about Bela manufacturing a huge bat to do away with his enemies has been pared down to about 25 minutes and sweetened with a faux 3D effect. With the added impertinance of the aliens watching along it goes very quickly. Better than the first Apt. 51 featuring Robot Monster.

8125422,3,B000FPDWCI,"Some clever puppeteers and fans of MST3K have decided to take a stab at yakking over movies as well and for the most part it's pretty funny but still not original. The film Robot Monster is presented here in 2d although it was shown upon release in partial 3D but the parts with the puppets watching Robot Monster is in 3D. Huh? You'll figure it out. Some of the quips are priceless but you can tell they are still working out some of the bugs with camera placement. A must for 3D fans but Apt. 51 Devil Bat is much better in every way except that it is shorter.
