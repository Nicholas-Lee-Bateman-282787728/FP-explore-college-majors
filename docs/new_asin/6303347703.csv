632290,4,6303347703,"It's a shame that MY FOOLISH HEART is not currently available on video. For the movie is an excellent, bittersweet love story with one of Susan Hayward's finest performances.
The film is based on a short story written by J.D. Salinger for The New Yorker magazine (although I've read the story and the movie's script is MUCH expanded from the original). A trusting and somewhat naive college girl named Eloise Winters falls for a charming but irresponsible man on the eve of WWII. She gives her heart a little too quickly, and tragedy results.
Although some reviewers peg MY FOOLISH HEART as little more than an old-fashioned ""weepie,"" the movie actually has many sound virtues. The script is sharp and realistic, with some welcome touches of humor. The black-and-white, deep-focus photography is excellent. And Victor Young's musical score--with its famous title tune--is beautiful.
Dana Andrews and the supporting players do fine work (with Robert Keith, as Hayward's loving, level-headed father being a real stand-out). But it's Hayward who truly wraps up the film with her outstanding performance. She may not always be entirely convincing, especially in some of her early scenes as a dewy-eyed college girl. But when the script turns darker, she reponds with an acting job that is stunning and deeply felt. She really gets to the heart of Eloise's fear, longing and regret. Even in shots where she has no dialogue, Hayward's facial expressions can be absolutely devastating.
If you look to movies for a good, emotionally cathartic experience, you won't be disappointed with MY FOOLISH HEART.",970444800,80,1595,5.138461538461539

The only minor drawback was that some of the sections had better contrast then other sections. Perhaps the movie needs to be remastered. Other than that, I am thrilled to have it in my collection, so that I can view it whenever I wish. This movie is definitely a 5 star movie.",1483574400,2,383,4.12

632420,5,6303347703,"A nicely done, post-war romantic drama staring the versatile and vivacious Susan Hayward. A story within a story common to movies of this era, the backdrop is a love affair between two people at the onset of World War II. This is classical, quality, late forties fare which are notable for lacking the often crude salaciousness of late 20th and current 21st century movies. Although I like Dana Andrews, in this film his acting style comes off as palatable, but a little stale. The real performance, as usual, is turned in by Miss Hayward, whose petite and adorable sexiness is always a welcome visual distraction. Being a romantic drama, this film will generally be more appealing to women, but from a man's point of view it represents a fair glimpse of American life and the common travails of the years immediately following WWII.",1470441600,3,833,4.8321678321678325

632498,5,6303347703,"My Foolish Heart is a glorious soap opera made in 1949, when the Hollywood studio system was breaking down and television was becoming a real threat to the film industry. As the film opens, Eloise (Susan Hayward) is about to end her unhappy wartime marriage to Lew Wengler (Kent Smith). In flashback, we see her romance and brief affair with New York City playboy Walt Dreiser (Dana Andrews). Eloise becomes pregnant, Walt is killed in the war, and Eloise hastily marries Lew, her best friends fiance. She doesnt love Lew but wants her unborn child not to have the stigma of illegitimacy.

The role of strong-willed Eloise earned Hayward the first of her five Oscar nominations. Though its a bit of a strain to accept her as a college student in the flashback sequences, she gives the role tremendous sympathy and clearly dominates the picture. Her Eloise not a stereotype but a real woman toughing it out in a judgmental, male-dominated world.

This film is what was once described as a womans picture, the kind that propelled Bette Davis and Joan Crawford to stardom in the 1930s. The script by Casablanca writers Julius and Philip Epstein, based on the J.D. Salinger story Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut, is lively with sharp dialogue. Acting overall is first rate, with effective supporting performances by Jessie Royce Landis, Robert Keith, and young Gigi Perreau. Director Mark Robson captures the energy and emotions of young lovers during World War II, an era of uncertain futures.

The title song, by Victor Young, was instrumental in publicizing the film.  Recorded by both Gordon Jenkins and Billy Ekstine, it received considerable radio air play, with Ekstines version reaching Number 6 on the pop charts.

There are no bonus features on the unrated, full-screen DVD.",1462838400,,1776,4.986486486486487

632500,5,6303347703,"""I was a NICE girl, wasn't I?"" So asks Susan Hayward, more than once. Forget Ingrid Bergman. Susan Hayward at her best, and this is her best, could act any other American actress off the screen. Having seen and loved this movie on TCM, I was one of the many begging to have it on DVD, and, by gosh, our wish was granted! Dana Andrews, also, was a great and greatly unappreciated actor, and the combination is splendid. I do wonder, however, if some cuts were made in the DVD version. Among others, I seem to remember a longer scene in which Susan Hayward's father makes it clear that his marriage to her mother involved the metaphorical shotgun. Also, watching the movie this time through, it seemed as if a few too many scenes took place in Grand Central Station or on Hudson River line trains, where the scenery took one's attention away from the lovers. Altogether, though, a sound five-star movie, and the rare kind of movie that is better in black-and-white than it would have been in color.",1462233600,6,996,4.538888888888889

From that showing, I don't really remember much (I saw it later and caught up), but I do remember Susan Hayward's face as she waits in the airport for her love (a pilot if I recall correctly) and how her face changes when she discovers his plane has gone down and he is dead.

632504,5,6303347703,"Another classic Susan Hayward film finally released to DVD.  Ms. Hayward plays the role of a rather loose young woman who has an affair and becomes pregnant as a result.  Since the father had gone off to war before she knew she was pregnant, she then proceeds to seduce her best friend's fiance into a hasty and spiteful marriage to avoid the unacceptable stigma associated (in those days) with being unmarried and pregnant.  How times have changed.  Now days it seems to be the norm rather than the exception that to be unmarried and pregnant is no big deal.  Ms. Hayward and Dana Andrews turn in great performances as was always the case with both actors in every film they made.  So good to see the studios release more of these old but classic movies that can be watched without having to be subjected to foul language, bare T&A and such.",1457049600,7,842,4.543046357615894
