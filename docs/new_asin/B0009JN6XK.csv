8061978,1,B0009JN6XK,"First, let me say I bought two sets of these three dvds by Johnson.  The first set all worked but vol. 3 of the second set did not.  This seems to be consistent with the poor quality of the Black Belt dvds.  There are two martial art dvd companies out there that have very poor quality goods and Black Belt is one.  Since the first set I bought worked I can tell you that Johnson's concepts and instruction are great... He is five stars all the way. Unfortunately, Black Belt tends to fall short too many times letting down the buyer and the folks that present their skills.",1313798400,2,574,4.287037037037037
