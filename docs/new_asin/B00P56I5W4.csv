6787584,1,B00P56I5W4,"Hardly a great film, ""Prince of Players"" once boasted a period richness which was greatly enhanced by the widescreen CinemaScope process, which was very new and exciting when it was first released.  Its cast boasted some very fine actors delivering very good performances, and its subject, focusing on the famous brother of John Wilkes Boothe gave the film strong historical interest.  The horror, right now, in 2016, an era of large high definition 16x9 TVs is that Twentieth Century Fox has reverted to the wretched old VHS-era practice of turning out a pan-and-scan adulteration of the movie.  One wonders what sort of thought process was led to the insensitively tasteless decision was made to release a version of the production, stripped of one of its best attributes.  Speaking of VHS, the quality of the visuals has a distinctly soft, fuzzy look.  Ironically, on the cover art on the DVD packaging, the reminder that this was, proudly, a CinemaScope picture is a very prominent part of the poster art they utilized.",1466035200,14,1023,4.9941176470588236
6787585,1,B00P56I5W4,Another wonderful early Fox widescreen movie gets a pan and scan presentation. Who the hell makes these decisions at Fox Cinema Archives? They must be total idiots. And to add insult to injury the box art prominently features the word CinemaScope. Another favorite movie I'll skip buying thanks to a shoddy Fox DVD presentation.,1464393600,9,328,5.092592592592593
6787586,1,B00P56I5W4,The movie is terrific and gets 4 stars. But Fox Cinema Archives has struck again releasing this CinemaScope film in an unwatchable Pan & Scan version. When will they learn? PLEASE do not support this film or any Pan & Scan version. It's a crime in this day and age to not release films in their original widescreen version.,1463788800,14,323,4.491525423728813

8686432,4,B00P56I5W4,"From the past, a chance to hear the real Prince recite Shakespeare. Richard Burton was considered to be the heir to Olivier's crown in Shakespearian theater during the 1950's. Burton shone like a tarnished star in Camelot on Broadway. And then there was this movie about John Wilkes Booth's brother. You get to see Raymond Massey as Junius Brutus Booth, their father, and Burton as Edwin Booth. They presented Shakespeare's plays in venues across America and even in Europe. Both were played with gusto which today would be considered over-acting but was actually representative of theater of that day. ""Be Quiet! And I will show you the damnedest Richard III ever seen."" The movie even throws in a love interest so that Burton can quote the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet. Then there is melodrama during Burton's Hamlet.  The movie is a pretty piece of work typical of the 1950's movies. But, the scene to see is the last when Edwin takes the stage to receive the ire of the audience after his brother killed Lincoln. Played to excess but still remarkable and memorable even after 60 years. It is wonderful and maybe the best movie that Burton ever did. Sorry, Burton never lived up to people's expectations. Gravel voiced, drunken and flawed he was the best damned King Arthur
ever seen.",1494892800,2,1294,4.802690582959642
8686433,5,B00P56I5W4,"PRINCE OF PLAYERS is one of my favorite films. I waited years for it to be released on DVD. This film was shot in CinemaScope. PRINCE OF PLAYERS is an outstanding, underrated and forgotten film despite 4 x 3 pan and scan presentation. I have been trying to get a copy of this film for years. 4 x 3 pan and scan will have to do. I simply yearn to have yearn to have this marvelous film.

The cover of this DVD uses the artwork from the film's poster and it prominently states CinemaScope that would indicate that the DVD would be in some form of 16 x 9 wide-screen or whatever. Unfortunately it is not. This DVD is in Full Frame 4 x 3 Pan and Scan. Visually, this presentation is a  monstrosity, but a rather curious one at that. The plot gives us insight into the Booth family and the possible psychological dysfunction due to hereditary  The only saving grace is that we get to hear Bernard Herrmann's interesting score. I am utterly disappointed. A few days before I ordered this DVD I was able to watch the widescreen version on TCM. It was brilliant. This DVD is not.",1490832000,3,1071,4.318407960199005
8686434,4,B00P56I5W4,Decent though not perfect resolution and a interesting story. Nice to hear Richard Burton playing Shakespeare parts. Not sure how historically accurate it is but still entertaining.,1489968000,,181,5.7407407407407405
8686435,1,B00P56I5W4,"I was just about to add this film to my ""Wish List"" as I always enjoy anything that Richard Burton does.  Alas, the other comments have convinced me to pass on it.  I've been burned before with Fox Cinemascope films being issued on ""Cinema Archives"" in pan-and-scan (notably ""23 Paces to Baker Street"").  I promised myself that I would not make the same mistake again.  When the word ""Cinemascope"" is plastered right on the front cover as part of the cover art, why would they even consider releasing it in anything but widescreen?  If Warner Archive can do it, then Fox should be able to do it too.  Get with the program!",1488758400,2,622,4.508928571428571
