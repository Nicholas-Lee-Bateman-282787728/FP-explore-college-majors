3798136,5,B001UELBZ8,"I took my two teenage daughters to a special screening of this movie and they thoroughly enjoyed it, but what most surprised me is that this seems to be a great film for the entire family (sans the kids under 12 or so).

The story was interesting from beginning until the (somewhat surprising) ending of the film and the acting was quite good from the entire cast. We're looking forward to seeing it again on DVD; the bonus features should be interesting!",1278547200,2,455,4.548780487804878

3798138,5,B001UELBZ8,"This story of a young teen outsider turns a familiar theme on its ear. Winningly smart and smart-assed, the film, written and directed by Cathy Randall uses intelligent and witty choreographed imagery (camera work so expert), as much as clever dialogue, to tell the story of Esther Blueburger (Danielle Catanzariti), the 13-year-old adorable awkward Jewish misfit at a posh private girls school. Opening with a Busby Berkeley type Hollywood extravaganza on the school lawn, where multiple cliques of 4 , first perform extreme rhythmic gymnastics, and then seated in unison, in perfect synchrony, perform a variety of mundane tasks, while Esther can only watch furtively from an attic window.  Esther befriends a precious yellow duckling she names Normal, and he's her constant shadow. But even Normal will be lost to her as he appears shockingly deceased and a candidate for dissection in her science lab. She's certain it's he, feathers or not. At last a friend emerges, Sunni ( Keisha Castle- Hughes), and Esther. with no authorization, transfers to her public school under the guise of a cultural exchange student in an experimental program. There are so many excellent comic, as well as serious and touching vignettes, which I won't spoil. This really is a story about bullying and rejection, but it's told in a wonderfully satirical and human way, and not an instructional lesson-teaching style. The acting is first rate, as are all the filmmaking disciplines.  A strong recommend.",1475971200,,1486,5.1875

3798169,5,B001UELBZ8,"Esther is an outcast at a private school. The uniformity of the school is shown to the extreme. Esther wants to be part of the crowd, yet at the same time strives not to be part of the group. She attempts to talk to her parents, but they ignore her to excess. Esther meets Sunni (Keisha Castle-Hughes), a public school student. They connect and become friends and she also makes friends with Sunni's mom (Toni Collette) who works as a dancer. Esther decides to stop going to Rowan and attend public school with the unorthodox Sunni...without really telling anyone. Here she finds her comfort zone.

The story is basically a witty coming of age story. The story becomes serious and sad toward the end, which I thought ruined the flow.

Serious thumb in the eye to the 'no god but man' fools.
If she could only be slightly more charitable to her parents in the movie, even as I am sure she would be in later life, I'd add another half-star.
You fail to know her namesake's story at your peril.

3798212,5,B001UELBZ8,"This captures a girl in the very last moments of childhood.  She is not in any hurry to grow up, but simply wants caring friends and a way to be herself without being pressured or judged.

3798216,4,B001UELBZ8,"This received some good reviews so I gave it a shot. The opening song sounded very ""after school special-ish"" and I thought I really screwed up this time, but thankfully I was wrong........way wrong. This was about as pleasant a viewing experience as I've ever had.

Set in Australia, the story is about a 'coming of age' Jewish girl in an uppity type prep school. She's more than a bit on the outside of things and just cannot get accepted by the other girls. She's quite bright but with a quirky sense of things. She meets a rocker type girl from a public school and schemes a way to go to said public school, (unbeknown to her parents) where she seems to fit in a bit better. The scheme goes south and she needs to re-evaluate where she thinks she should be.

This is a good movie. Maybe not a great movie as the story does ramble a bit, but it rests solely on the shoulders of Danielle Catanzariti as Esther Blueburger. She is outstanding. For my money she hit every note on the head. The way she delivers her lines, her facial expressions, even the way she walks is spot on. The other actors are all decent, and I'm always game to see Toni Collette, but they pale in comparison to Esther.

The production values are good enough to get you through the proceedings and the music/soundtrack is great. Seeing a 100+ girl chorus singing House of the Rising Sun is priceless.

This falls squarely into the category of films such as ""Juno"" or ""Little Miss Sunshine"", so if you liked either of those, chances are you'll adore this.",1279756800,10,1528,4.446428571428571
