1697457,5,B0000640U4,"Ed Emberley presents his 9 item drawing alphabet that any child can use to make better drawings. Emberley is a Caldecott winner. This video was selected as one of the top six children's videos of the year by Parents' Choice/Good Morning America. A top-10 by Billboard. Ed Emberley also created books presenting the drawing alphabet (dots, lines & shapes) but this video is enthralling to elementary age children. Nothing like a video to teach visual arts.

A VHS copy was used about 15 years in my elementary art classroom with grand results. Children watch, listen, and learn to use basic shapes to enhance their drawing skills. They enjoy seeing children of their own age using the alphabet. Kids drawing a detailed pirate ship during the video is inspirational to any age.

A perfect gift for budding young artists. A gift for the art teacher. This is entertainment and arts education packed into a child-friendly 25-minute length. This fundamental art lesson will never be out of date educationally.

WARNING (with a smile): Have paper and drawing/painting supplies handy--they WILL be desired after the viewing.",1210204800,,1116,5.087431693989071
1697458,4,B0000640U4,"my mother must have bought this tape for my brother and i in the early 90's. we were both around eight or nine at the time. to this day i recall the theme song melody.

a great thing about this film is the way that it inspires children to draw regardless of their age or skill level. if i recall correctly, illustrations as simple as dots representing ants are animated and provided a story. the way which ed emberley expresses the ability to enstill life within the most basic of drawings is great for children with imagination and a desire to draw.

if i were to watch this film now i'm positive that it would provide a wonderful sense of nostalgia. over the years i watched it again and again. moving from apartments to apartments to houses. it truly became a part of my childhood. and i have to admit that as a child who loved music the theme song was always one of my favorite parts of the film.",1174176000,,900,4.288235294117647
1697459,4,B0000640U4,"This tape is really good for the begginer. It's well filmed and easy to understand. My parents bought it for me for Christmas and it's helped me a lot. I also recommend all of Mark Kistler's books and tapes and a cute book that can inspire any young artist (The Butterfly by Singh). I got many other presents, but these were the best.",1041465600,5,334,4.317460317460317
7960075,1,B0000640U4,"Ordered with hopes of sitting with my child and working on a drawing lesson... not at all what I expected. This DVD is mostly like a very long commercial selling the idea but there was never a tutorial of any sort, had to return it. I am now looking into other options hat we can sit and learn together from, my daughter kept fast forwarding looking forward to any drawing.. never happened.",1493164800,,390,4.430555555555555

7960077,5,B0000640U4,I'm a teacher and I've used this every year to teach students how to use Ed Emberly's drawing books.  It's a little dated but the kids still enjoy it.  I've used it in grades 1-5.,1474675200,,179,4.085714285714285
7960078,5,B0000640U4,"Five stars!  My kids loved this when it was new, so I took a chance when I saw it on DVD.  It encourages creativity in a way that makes you want to try what he's doing.  My grandkids will love this and so will the kids I work with every day.  I am so glad it is available!",1398902400,,272,3.6379310344827585

7960080,5,B0000640U4,"O.K.  I read the other reviews and almost did not spend the $10 on it but it was WELL WORTH the price.  I am a K-2 art teacher and wanted something for an art party.  I mix things up and wanted to introduce Ed Emberley's system of the Shapes Alphabet.  I started by fast forwarding parts that I thought they would not want to see but the kids protested and really  loved it.  I showed it to about 15 classes and without exception, hands down they were into it.  I then downloaded a few of his shapes alphabet characters. The kids could see how in the video the point wasn't that it was the only way to draw but just one way to look at things.  Ed Emberley's technique is empowering to even my most timid artists. Smiles on all the faces and great variety.  I encouraged kids to choose one animal and do it in Emberley's style and then put it in a world of its own, or a setting and it made for a great class.  If you are working with young kids this is a great video.  Not sure about older ones by 5, 6, 7 and 8 years for sure.
And indeed they loved the corny kid actors the most!!  Go figure.",1356220800,,1093,4.0092592592592595

7960082,2,B0000640U4,"I'm mystified by the positive reviews here. I borrowed this at the library, and I'm glad I am glad I didn't pay $10 for it.  The fact that it was 1980s and bad child acting with bad music did not really bother my child, because he does not watch any TV so any video is a treat, but 80% of the video is introduction and fluff and the substance (the alphabet of drawing) when they finally get to it, is rushed.  It would have been better to develop the alphabet over a few lessons with lots of examples, but that might have taken more than 20 minutes.  Clearly the video was made back when video production was still expensive and they obviously had a very tight budget.  Doubtless there are hours of better instruction online now, some appropriate for kids, and I aim to find some of it.  Bottom line: library item as long as you don't have high expectations.",1318377600,,858,4.3375
7960083,5,B0000640U4,"Ed Emberley, in this video and his books, offers children and the adults in their lives a way to think about what they see: a visual language akin to Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language yet on a basic, easy to grasp level. Referred to as a drawing alphabet, viewers are introduced to the basic shapes (squiggles, dots, and lines) surrounding us, waiting for us to see them and create with them. If the video had just a little less music aimed at very small children I'd recommend it to adults interested in drawing more impactful images on whiteboards during meetings. At every age we benefit from being able to make a doodle and grow an idea out of it.",1248393600,,658,4.584745762711864
