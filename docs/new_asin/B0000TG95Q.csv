1943127,4,B0000TG95Q,"This is Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell at their best.  While the men are off to war (WWII), the woman are called to help their country by working for an airplane manufacturing factory.  It's a woman's coming of age story in many ways with some great music and a few love stories thrown in for good measure.  Christine Lahti is a stand out in her co-starring role.",1252454400,2,361,4.358208955223881
1943128,3,B0000TG95Q,"This movie looks at the ""Rosie the Riveter"" phenomena of World War II, in which women stepped in take over the assembly lines of factories which desperately needed manpower. Goldie Hawn plays one of these women while Kurt Russell plays a coworker who winds up seducing her.

I like both of these actors but this film wasn't a good vehicle for them. The story is a good one but not suited to Hawn, who seems to do her best in slapstick comedy roles. A good movie, but not one I think I will go out of my way to see again.",1241654400,,520,4.148514851485149
1943129,4,B0000TG95Q,"Swing shift was one of my favorite movies about WWII because it was

1943133,5,B0000TG95Q,I love this movie it is fun loving and heart warming it is a great movie that brings back a time when every thing was simple even in war time.

1943134,5,B0000TG95Q,"""Swing Shift"" has proven to be a marvelous nostalgia trip for those who remember the '40s, and for those self-proclaimed nostalgia buffs like myself who enjoy the music of the era.
 Goldie Hawn has a childlike innocence as a housewife to Ed Harris in a working class neighborhood in 1941 California. Jack and Kay Walsh deal with Jack's having to work on Saturdays, a rather vampy neighbor at whom they make derogatory remarks when they see her going to work, and enjoy time at the roller rink.
 While they are at the roller rink, the attack on Pearl Harbor is announced and their world changes. Jack enlists in the Navy and Kay decides to work as riveter, who helps to build airplanes at a local munitions plant.
 She develops an antagonistic relationship with her neighbor, Hazel(Christine Lahti), the singer-turned riveter, whom she and her husband used to taunt, and an even closer relationship with a plant worker named Lucky (Kurt Russell)who repeatedly invites her out to hear him play his trumpet at a club leading to gossip and speculation about their relationship among their co-workers.
 During the course of the film, we see the reluctance of the women's male co-workers to accept them as equals in the workplace, and one of the male instructors gets a little too familiar with Hazel while instructing her on how to drill.
 The unspoken problem in all this is the women's inability to defend themselves against sexual harrassment in the workplace  at that time. In modern times, Lucky never would have been able to make the kind of advances that he made towards her in this film, at least not without Kay filing a complaint. This film suggests that such situations may have been common back then, largely because of this fact. It leads a viewer to wonder how many affairs between the female swingshifters and their male counterparts took place at that time, regardless of the marital status of either of them.
 But we share the triumphs as well as the tragedies of the swing shifters; Holly Hunter, as Jeanne Sherman, receives her husband's death notice while at work, but later gives the audience a lesson in how life can go on afterwards.
 Jack discovers his wife's affair when he comes home on furlough, and is heartbroken. As Kay tries to figure out how best to resolve the situation, Hazel and Lucky begin a dallience of their own after Hazel's relationship with her former boss appears to be over.
  After the inevitable fight between the two women, they avoid each other at work. Lucky gets his big break as a musician, and leaves the plant, which makes it easier for Hazel and Kay to eventually make peace with each other.
 I found this film--a counterpart to that other portrayal of life in World War II California, ""Racing With the Moon"", which was released the same year--to be a fine tribute the the women who helped win World War II--to their endurance of heartache and sacrifice, demeaning treatment, the realism of the marginalized  treatment of the African American women at the plant, and the support that women in general can give each other in times of crisis. When Kay is promoted after saving a co-worker's life,  we see how the men begin to respect their female co-workers for their intelligence. Interestingly, these themes were later echoed in the 1992 film, ""A League of Their Own"".
 Sadly, these women had to give up their jobs once the men returned home from the war. But those who see this film should come to appreciate the way the women of this era paved the way for equality in the workplace.",1097884800,26,3534,4.7438825448613375
1943135,4,B0000TG95Q,"I was riveted to this film the first time I saw it.  I loved the period piece and the authenticity of the time they were capturing.  My dad and mom both agreed it kept with the time.  I especially loved the Rosie the Riveter aspect, as that character always intrigued me and Goldie does an excellent job in filling that role.  This type of setting and story probably happened hundreds of times across the US during the Pearl Harbor days.  Maybe others feel it wraps up too pat (like a typical Hollywood ending) but I felt it was true to what probably happened in those days.  I love this film for all the marvelous acting and pairing Goldie with Kurt was great casting.  They do it again in Overboard, another often overlooked Goldie film.  I would recommend this film for anyone who likes historical fiction and who enjoys Goldie & Kurt.",1088553600,7,838,4.503311258278146
1943136,4,B0000TG95Q,"You may have heard how the original cut of this film was considered great until Goldie Hawn demanded re-shooting to further elevate her character's story.  Regardless, it still is a fun movie to watch.
Jonathan Demme re-creates a very believable 1940's Santa Monica, CA and the lives of the women who worked in the war factories. Everyone in this film delivers the goods - including Hawn, but Christine Lahti literally steals the show (despite Goldie's re-takes) as the dance hall singer turned riveter.  I loved all the scenes inside the airplane factory where they work. Not only do we have Hawn, Lahti and Kurt Russell, but a great supporting cast including Holly Hunter, Ed Harris, Sudie Bond and Fred Ward.",1075766400,8,711,4.916666666666667

Admittedly, as a young, romantic woman, all I saw, the first time I saw it, was the turmoil of a married woman falling into love with another man and a bittersweet ending.  Felt sad for the Kurt character.

This time around, I saw the story differently with different eyes.  Now, I see the story was much richer.  How the war and war effort changed women's lives.  Those women who emerged loving and appreciating what was good in themselves and their effort was the central theme.  Now, I saw the fate for Kurt, made sense.
Notwithstanding, however..more could have been included, to pay respect to the men and women who served.  The honors they deserve. I thought the actors who played the service men, did an excellent job.",1478649600,5,787,4.578571428571428

1943180,5,B0000TG95Q,"I've watched so many movies that I get one mixed up with another or insanity is just around the corner.
  I do, however, read everything I can and see everything I can regarding the Holocaust and World War II. This movie staring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russel. They actually fell in love during the making of this movie and have been together 30 years or in Hollywood terms FOREVER!
  The movie takes place in 1941 and the men who can fight are sent to fight and the women must take over their jobs building airplanes and other things that are needed in the war effort.
  The only thing I sort of objected to was that when the war was over the women were sent home and the men took their jobs. Would it kill them to have a few women around. These gals were competent and made all kinds of rivets and bullets and airplane parts and whatever else was needed for the war but they were sent home to take care of their men and, of course, many wanted to do just that but a few would have liked to stay on. I would think all that was used in the war needed to be replaced.
  All in all this was a really good movie; Christine Lahti and Ed Harris also were main characters. All of them were so young that's it's a shame they're now older than me (choke, choke).
  Two words; FANTASTIC
OK, I can't spell either!!!

1943189,4,B0000TG95Q,"Another Hawn and Russell movie, but this one isn't up to their best - in my opinion.  Swing Shift is the story of Kay Walsh (Goldie Hawn) who is married to Jack Walsh (Ed Harris).  It's World War II, Jack signs up to go to war.  Kay signs up to be a Rosie at an aircraft manufacturing plant.  Neighbor and previous pain-in-the-arse, Hazel (Christine Lahti) befriends Kay and the two soon become chums.

Hazel is a singer when she's not putting together planes for the war effort.  Mike ""Lucky"" Lockhart (Kurt Russell), a war reject and trumpet player for the group keeps hitting on Walsh hoping to take her out.  Eventually Kay gives in with a ""It won't hurt anything"" attitude until hubby Jack, remember him?  He's her husband, comes back.

As always Hawn and Russell play well together.  The vibe is there between them because it is real.  But this movie just doesn't hold up in the long run.  It's fun, but it's nowhere near what Russell and Hawn can do together.",1433894400,,966,4.520231213872832

1943204,1,B0000TG95Q,This is about as loathsome a mainstream release as can be imagined.  In a nutshell husbands go off to war to battle our nation's aggressors.  Wives go to work in the factories to help with the war effort.  To alleviate their tedium the wives' engage in extramarital affairs with the males rejected by the military.  Men come back victorious and everybody gets a house in the suburbs with a washer and dryer.  What a slap in the face to the men who shed blood for our freedom and the women who maintained morale on the home front!  This trivializes the efforts of the Greatest Generation and reduces it to a soap opera.  It doesn't help matters that there are no redeeming characters in the piece unless you count the cuckolded spouse played by Ed Harris.  Shockingly the directorial credit goes to Jonathan Demme though rumor has it that star-producer Goldie Hawn hired another director to shoot footage to make her character more sympathetic.  It didn't work.  The screenplay is ascribed to a Rob Morton which is a pseudonym for a group of top scribes.  Demme should have taken his name off this tripe and did an Alan Smithee.,1416528000,,1127,4.641414141414141

1943213,5,B0000TG95Q,"Goldie Hawn (Kay) and Kurt Russell (Lucky) may be listed as the 'stars' of this movie, but it is definitely an ensemble cast.  Christine Lahti (Hazel) gives a break-out performance. Minor characters add some wonderful humorous moments.

Kay's husband Jack is sent overseas to fight during World War II.  Lucky is a man who is not able to fight due to being designated 4F.  While working as a 'Rosie the Riveter', Kay meets Lucky and eventually the sparks flame into a fire they can't ignore.  Hazel's beau decides to enlist, so she goes to work as a riveter and becomes close friends with Kay, her neighbor.

Hazel's role in Kay's life is pivotal, especially when Jack returns from the war unexpectedly and suspects Kay is having a fling with Lucky. Hazel covers for her and, subsequently, she and Lucky do become romantically involved, which strains Kay and Hazel's friendship almost to the breaking point.  Ultimately, however, amidst all the personal post-war adjustments, they realize the bond between them cannot be broken.",1411430400,6,1028,4.976608187134503

1943217,3,B0000TG95Q,Although I enjoyed seeing Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell when they were young and oh so cute and I do like period pieces; I was disappointed.  I was hoping for a more detail on the events of the war in relation to the factories and how hard it was for the woman even though the government was encouraging them to work. I suppose the romance was the main focus.  But neither character aroused much sympathy from me.,1407110400,,412,4.337662337662338

1943219,1,B0000TG95Q,This is one of the worst experiences we have ever had with Amazon. We paid to stream this movie. The movie was interrupted about every three or four minutes. Each time we had to wait a minute for it to resume. The movie is one hour and 40 minutes long. You can imagine what it was like. Don't waste your time in watching this movie. It is clearly defective for streaming. Amazon should be ashamed.,1402358400,3,397,4.306666666666667

1943221,4,B0000TG95Q,i remember seeing this in the theater when first released and loved it! from the opening uplifting song by Carly Simon (which was an actual single here in SC that was played on the radio for a bit) to the great acting from Goldie to Kurt to a young Holly Hunter and many others. i think Christine was nominated for a supporting oscar also which she so deserved as she is the heart of this movie. if you want a movie that will move your heart and make you feel good and if you want to take a trip down memory lane of either knowing folks from this era or just reminding yourself of going to the movies in the 80's when it cost 1.50 before 6 and 3.00 after 6 lol this is the flick to get.,1400112000,,686,3.9782608695652173

1943223,4,B0000TG95Q,"I didn't give this 5 stars because its not Goldie Hawns usual type of movie. There was more drama than comedy. I love Goldie Hawns work and this doesn't disappoint. It has a good story to it, and alot of well known actors giving a good performance. I recommend this movie, its very entertaining and kind of gives you a feel for what it was like during the 40's for the women left behind when their loved ones went off to war.",1395792000,,425,4.195121951219512
1943224,5,B0000TG95Q,"SWING SHIFT stars Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Ed Harris and Christine Lahti in a nostalgic look back at the U.S. home front during World War II. Combining a Rosie-the-Riveter romance with time in a capsule, the movie has the look and feel of the 1940s and the music is a treat.

Anyone too young to remember World War II might be surprised by the attitudes of the time. The ""little woman"" was expected to stay at home, cook, clean house and raise kids. The scenes in the defense plant are eye-openers.

Women who took part in the war effort were sometimes looked on a helpless jokes or as sex objects. They proved to be competent workers who could give as good as they got.

Naturally, when women and men worked together in such close quarters, romantic entanglements developed. Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell sizzle as a woman whose husband is overseas and a 4-F ""lead man"" who falls in love with her. Both are in their young and gorgeous prime of life and deliver solid performances.",1388880000,,982,4.568181818181818
1943225,3,B0000TG95Q,"a cute sleeper hit with a cult following, a warm fuzzy movie about women working on the airplane assembly line during WWII. For my money an underrated gem!",1385596800,,155,4.571428571428571
1943226,4,B0000TG95Q,"I got this dvd used but it seemed brand new and was only about $2 plus about $4 for s/h. It arrived promptly within like 2 days. I'm so glad I got it used since the Amazon price for new was almost $40 and definitely not worth that much. I had been curious to see this movie but have never seen it ever come on tv so decided just to buy it used and cheap.

This was a cute sweet little movie. It was touching but a little sad. It is probably one of the more realistic storylines, though, for a Goldie Hawn movie. She plays Kay, a sweet, quirky officer's wife who goes to work while her husband fights in World War II. She, like many other women during that time, goes to work in a factory filling in for the men who are off at war. She is romanced by a man named Lucky who is her superior at work and also befriended by a neighbor named Hazel who, up until that time had been the brunt of jokes from Kay's husband.

This is the movie that led to Goldie Hawn's romantic real-life involvement with Kurt Russell. I didn't find him to be the charmer he usually plays but their relationship is believable after he finally convinces her to acknowledge it. At first Kay resists his advances saying she's married but then after several months gives in and seems to fall hopelessly in love with him. Needless to say, her husband then surprises her by coming home unannounced. I won't give anything more away but I will say that I was not too thrilled with the ending.

Goldie Hawn did a great job and manages to play her character with vulnerability as well as believability. Like I said, Kurt Russell is not his usual charming self but is still believable as the feisty musician Lucky. (I read Kevin Costner was wanted for this role but was unavailable.) Great supporting work here from Christine Lahti who plays Kay's wild singer friend Hazel. Ed Harris plays Kay's husband and Holly Hunter also has a small role. Carly Simon sings the opening theme song.

I read in Goldie Hawn's memoir that this movie was completely different when it was first made but that the producers and Goldie were not happy with Jonathan Demme's direction so it was almost completely re-shot. I wonder what the original shoot would have been like. Guess we'll never know...",1378512000,2,2242,4.421307506053269

1943243,3,B0000TG95Q,"Swing Shift is one of those movies that couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama and didn't quite succeed as either one. I like the premise, about women going to work on the home front during WWII. It's a great opportunity to explore gender roles and sexism in the workplace. ""Swing Shift"" does explore those themes but only briefly. Most of the time it's a tired tale of romance and jealousy that we've seen many times before. And despite the big budget feel of the movie (impressive factory scenes, etc.) the story didn't seem quite convincing. Didn't Goldie's characted have any correspondence with her husband for three years?

The actors do a fine job. One of my favorite actresses, Holly Hunter, has a small role and shines in her few scenes. And the production values are good as mentioned, so I blame the screenwriters for not making this interesting premise into a more entertaining story. This just wasn't very entertaining. 3-",1342051200,3,951,4.728915662650603

When Goldie Hawn's husband goes off to war, she gets a job in a defense plant. A ex-nightclub singer (Christine Lahti) also works at the plant and the two become friends.

Kurt Russell is a lead man at the plant and soon finds himself in love with Goldie. The nostalgia of the era is all around--a time when ordinary people bonded to accomplish extraordinary things.

Love flourishes until wars end, then the men come home and interestingly things return to normal--but never the same.

Holly Hunter plays a small role as one of the defense plant workers.",1325894400,4,616,4.838095238095238

I also see the pride in being an American and defending our nation in this movie. The actors played their parts well. Goldie Hawn was entirely believable as a slightly naive, home-spun girl. Christine Lahti was outstanding as 'Hazel', the aspiring singer.

1943248,4,B0000TG95Q,"I was not expecting much more than typical Hollywood schlock from this one, but director Jonathan Demme delivers much more than that. Produced in 1984, SWING SHIFT tells the story of a young woman (Goldie Hawn), who begins working in an airplane factory soon after her husband (Ed Harris) joins the U.S. Navy in December of 1941. She is tempted to indulge in an illicit affair with her foreman at the factory (Kurt Russell), while knowing full well that this would be wrong and inexcusable behavior. I won't reveal the plot for you, in case you have a chance to see this interesting film, but the acting is believable, the dialogue sounds natural, and the period detail is convincing. These characters seem like real people. I enjoyed it very much and found funny girl Goldie Hawn to be a talented and likeable dramatic actress. So, too, is Christine Lahti, who plays the role of her best friend. The whole film is nostalgic, evoking the Los Angeles of WWII very well indeed, and the editing keeps the story line moving. The critiques for SWING SHIFT were decidedly mixed, but I can recommend it with enthusiasm. Worth seeing.",1252800000,6,1126,4.75
