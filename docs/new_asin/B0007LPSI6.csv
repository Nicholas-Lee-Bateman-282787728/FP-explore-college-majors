2218308,5,B0007LPSI6,"SLEDGE HAMMER! was the most outrageous parody show of all time! It's absolutely side-splitting. It ranks right up there with Family Guy, Married With Children, Get Smart and the Simpsons on a short list of my favorite shows of all time.

The Season Two DVD looks like it's going to be great!  Four disks with the entire second season, plus TONS of extra goodies.  My episodes of Season II are 'Play it Again Sledge' where Sledge leaves the force and tries his hand as a private investigator (I'll let you take a wild guess how that turns out!?) and 'Model Dearest' where we are graced with many lovely 80's beauties and many big guns all in one episode (what more can a man ask for!?).  Season II even has Sledge Hammer doing Max Headroom!!!!

TWO BIG THUMBS/GUNS UP!!!!",1111536000,4,770,4.550724637681159
2218309,5,B0007LPSI6,"Season Two of Sledge Hammer! lives up to the high quality of the first season. Part satire, part drama and all quality, there are plenty of laughs to be found in these episodes. The ingenious solution to season one's cliffhanger ending is merely the first salvo in a season-long comedy fest. My personal favorite is ""Last of the Red Hot Vampires,"" which features a nice tribute to Bela Lugosi. The hysterical audio commentaries from creator Alan Spencer also continue in this set and they alone are funnier than anything on the networks these days. The humor and quality of Sledge are even more relevant in today's society and clearly leave us all hoping for a Sledge Hammer! movie.",1108512000,11,682,4.788135593220339
2218310,5,B0007LPSI6,"The second season of this show picks up where the first left off.... or doesn't, exactly. But that is all part of the joke as more genres of film and TV get sent up in a second season of a show that survived tough competition, a nuclear blast, and even an assault by heavily armed Amish farmers.

In our second season, there are plenty of sendups both of 1980s era stuff and other classic material. Hitchcock gets it in ""Vertical,"" and there is a loving tribute to Bela Lugosi in the Halloween episode ""Last of the Red Hot Vampires."" Fans of the first season will like the chance to see Harrison Page take charge in ""They Call Me Mr. Trunk"" and everything from 1940s Bogart detective movies to Paul ""Crocodile Dundee"" Hogan to Paul Verhoeven's ultraviolent ""RoboCop"" right on to the 1980s pop culture (and dark future) touchstone ""Max Headroom"" get sent up in this second season. Also, ""Dressed to Call"" spoofs the phone call horror film genre seen most recently with ""Scream.""

On a more serious note, the show continued the powerful dramatic arc which made it unique among other comedies of the time, most nobatly in the final episode of the season, and, as it turned out, the series.

The 1940s detective episode is a personal favorite of mine, and lovers of good spoof comedy and film in general will find interesting takes on the material. ""Hammer"" fans who liked the first set should get a kick out of these as well.

Fnally, I will love the chance to complete the set. There are very few shows I have been able to watch once, then remember so much for years, as this one - and most of those shows are dramas. It wil be fun to see these again. Another nice touch is that some comedy and film buffs who didn't catch the show's first run will be able to catch some of these. Kudos to ABC for giving the show the shot (I had to have some firearms reference in here!) for a second season, as the DVDs will show, it was a well-deserved one which the ""Sledge"" writers and players played very, very well.",1107043200,12,2003,4.434782608695652

2218344,1,B0007LPSI6,"Trust me, I know what I'm posting : I remembered liking the series, so I ordered season 1 & 2 from two different sellers.
Season 1 was why I liked the series, but what I'd forgotten about was that the second season really sucked. The seller also sent me library copies ( original discs without the packaging ). Order season 1 ONLY, and the first disc of season 2 if only to see the flimsy premise that it occurs five years earlier than when he was teamed with Doreau, his partner in season 1. only he is teamed with her 5 years...um,...earlier ?

Given the constraints of television, and the limited talent and imagination of Alan Spencer, the series creator, this series died a slow painful death by the end of the first season due to writing, and too much retreaded gags. The price of ordering Season 2 would be better spent on Police Squad's entire series and movies, but not this exercise in demonstrating how weak writing and direction in the 1980's on ABC killed many series there. Alan Spencer should have been a writer for local cable channel horror movie hosts, but not for creating a network series.

2218365,3,B0007LPSI6,"I went into this show completely expecting some goofy, cheesy '80s fun which it delivered. This TV show is a straight up parody in the vein of Airplane, Naked Gun and similar.
It has a decent premise that was inescapably hobbled by its status as a network TV show broadcast in the 80s. I've found so far that many of the jokes seem to fall flat. I can tell when they're *supposed* to be funny, but missing some je ne sais quoi, some vital spark to really give it life.
The main character is somewhat of a bumbling, clueless Dirty Harry. His partner is a smart, sassy, strong '80s woman and his boss is a parody of every high strung hot-headed police lieutenant on TV.
The premise sounds hysterical to read, but in practice there were many ridiculous moments and some great homages to the popular media of the day, but few genuine laughs. I'll be keeping it around to share with friends and family, but it doesn't warrant much re-watch value to me.",1374969600,,947,4.448275862068965

When there was asniper up on the roof of the building. Builets flying all around him.  He took out his gun and looked at it and said we will use something bigger.  He open the back of his car and got out a rocket.  He looked at the guy and said this will do.  He aimed it at him and then fired it at the doors of the building.  The whole building came down.

2218382,5,B0007LPSI6,"I remember this TV series from my childhood. It was made through 1986 to 1988. This obviously being the '88 season. The nice thing about the show is that even though it was made 25 years ago, with me in my 30's. It's still enjoyable to watch, I just wish it had ran longer than 2 seasons. In this season, the creator talks about how the filming quality has been reduced from the previous season, however I did not see any major discernible viewing disappointments from it.

2218419,5,B0007LPSI6,"Ignoring continuity but not the fans, series creator Alan Spencer dubbed the second season of Sledge Hammer! a ""prequel"", choosing not to ""cop out"" in resolving the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/previous-season/dp/B0001ZX0EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">previous season</a>&nbsp;cliffhanger (where Hammer set off a nuclear bomb) by saying it had all been a dream. To that end, the following disclaimer precedes the season premiere episode...

""The following season of Sledge Hammer! takes place five years before that nuclear explosion. Thank you.""

Despite the continuity issues this presents, you will be glad that Doreau still appears this season as Hammer's partner. The season also greatly benefits from the addition of Bill Bixby (The Incredible Hulk) as one of the show's resident directors (starting with ""Play it Again, Sledge""). Sledge Hammer! fans will benefit in knowing that these final 19 complete episodes are fully remastered and that the set is armed to the teeth with great extras - all personally supervised by Alan Spencer.

No doubt the great packaging for these Sledge Hammer! season sets has a lot to do with Alan Spencer's level of involvement and relationship with the fans and Anchor Bay Entertainment. Typically, when the original creators get so actively involved in the DVD releases of their shows, the better the finished release e.g. Peter Chung with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aeon-Flux/dp/B000B8I9XQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aeon Flux</a>&nbsp;and Paul Simms with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NewsRadio/dp/B0000ZMH8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NewsRadio</a>&nbsp;DVD sets.

He means well, , but his total disregard for due process and the rights of criminals nets him more time on suspension than on the job.  Don't stop with one season - get both.  The producer's fights with the network produced changes throughout the show, which actually made it funnier as it went along.  Each set is about 8 - 10 hours of constant laughter, and the versions with the producer's comments are almost as funny.

2218454,5,B0007LPSI6,"The DVD collection of the Sledge Hammer series from the mid 80's is of great quality.  The show was a blast at the time, and I think it still is, 20 years later.  If you like Cop humor, want a good laugh, and want to remind yourself of 80's fashion, buy this set.

 Don't let the neo-Fascists at the official Sledge message board site trick you in to thinking most fans are that un-American, they are a small lot. Most fans can make you proud to still love the show.",1136505600,6,377,4.123287671232877
2218475,5,B0007LPSI6,"I was THRILLED that the second season of Sledge Hammer came out on DVD. It is just as brilliant, original and funny as the first and badly needed in this day and age. Alan Spencer is definitely an original (which is rare) and should be given more credit than he has. The show was supported by an exceptional cast and should have been nominated for and won an Emmy at the time. I can't say enough about how phenomenal David Rasche is as Sledge. He truly is a rare gem of talent.

A message to the film studios: Several ""Sledge Hammer"" features should be made PRONTO!! COME ON, PEOPLE!! What are you waiting for? An invitation?!?!?

Congratulations to all at Anchor Bay and to Alan Spencer (shows creator) you have made my dreams come true with these box sets. Awesome stuff. Enough endorsement. Buy it now, you won't be disappointed.",1115337600,7,461,4.3604651162790695

Last night I watched the whole thing and it did not disappoint.  I laughed so hard that my sides are sore this morning.

This weekend I'm having a group of friends over to watch seasons 1 and 2 back to back non stop.

Alan Spencer is a genius and it's a shame that Sledge Hammer didn't run longer than 2 seasons.",1113955200,11,405,4.153846153846154
2218481,5,B0007LPSI6,"Other companies that release TV shows on DVD need to take a look at these Sledge Hammer season sets to see how it should be done.  Plenty of extras (including outstanding commentary tracks, and interviews with the actors and creator) and most importanly UNCUT EPISODES.  If you liked the show, there is no reason not to pick this up. If you didn't like it, give it another shot, you may like it now.  I had not seen many of the season 2 episodes and was worried that they might not be as good as the first season.  Fortunately I was wrong.  I think season 2 may even top season 1.  I would like to thank Alan Spencer and everyone else that made the Sledge DVD releases happen.",1113955200,45,676,4.283464566929134
2218482,5,B0007LPSI6,"Sledge Hammer! was a great TV comedy that has never been surpassed.  Season One of Sledge Hammer! was such an excellent DVD and so loaded with quality extras that it would be extremely difficult for Season Two to surpass it.  And yet producer Alan Spencer has done it with an absolutely delightful Season Two!

Season One introduced viewers to Inspector Sledge Hammer (David Rasche), a parody of Dirty Harry, his glamorous sidekick Dori Doreau (Anne-Marie Martin) and their perpetually frazzled boss, Captain Trunk (Harrison Page).  Brilliant, witty scripts and the great comic acting skills of this exceptional group of actors resulted in an outstanding Season One.  All the 22 episodes of Season One were great, but two in particular - Haven't Gun, Will Travel (a superb performance by David Rasche wherein Sledge lost his beloved 44 magnum) and Desperately Seeking Dori (where Anne-Marie Martin will have you rolling on the floor laughing as she brilliantly mimics Sledge) - made that Season truly exceptional.

Season Two not only maintained the brilliant comedy, but it had much more heart as the characters were fleshed out as real people you cared about.  This second season had three outstanding episodes - It Happened WHAT Night? (Sledge and Dori were caught in bed), Icebreaker (where Dori's heart was broken), and best of all Here's To You, Mrs. Hammer (the finale where Sledge grew up).  The second season finale had more emotional impact than the 1st Season's finale that ended in a nuclear explosion.

Not only do the episodes on Season Two outgun Season One, but the extras are much better (which is saying quite a lot).  This DVD box set has just set a new Gold Standard for DVD extras.  The documentary Gun Crazy was hilarious with it's behind the scenes insights on such great episodes as Hammeroid and Desperately Seeking Dori.  All of the audio commentaries are amusing and informative, but be sure to listen to the best of them - the Icebreaker audio commentary where producer Alan Spencer clowns around with Anne-Marie Martin in an ""I can't believe I just heard that"" performance that will leave you yearning for a Round Two.

This set is packed with lots of great extras -  TV spots (especially the Christmas greeting), scripts, a ""Sledge Hammer Casefile"" - which are delightful and well worth your time going through.

This is truly a precious gem of a TV series.  Perhaps the truest test of a great TV series is the ability of a viewer to watch an episode again and again and still get more out of it, and both Seasons of Sledge Hammer! more than pass that test.  Trust me, amigos, when I urge you to buy Sledge Hammer!",1113177600,15,2644,4.814159292035399
2218483,5,B0007LPSI6,"I have this set (early!) and can confirm that it not only lives up to the first season but exceeds it, both for the gleeful insanity of its spoofs, and for the character development unusual in a comedy show (apparently the studio wanted more emphasis on the relationships, and the writers and actors obliged). The episodes look as good as they have any right to, having been shot on 16mm as an economy measure but now digitally enhanced. (Slightly more successfully than the 'colorization' process parodied in one episode here!) There are more laughs in the three commentaries by creator Alan Spencer - helped out on one by the wonderfully talented lead actress Anne-Marie Martin - than in a whole season of most top-rated comedy shows. The other extras are well worth having, and along with the smart booklet show how much care has gone into crafting this set.

If you remember it from the 80's, buy it. If you remember the 80's, buy it. If you can remember anything, remember to buy this. Even yogurt-eatin' liberals like the President will love it.",1112659200,13,1051,4.743169398907104

8048330,5,B0007LPSI6,"I love ""Sledge Hammer"" and this Season Two is a great addition to any video library.  David Rasche is great as Inspector Sledge Hammer as well as the entire cast.  As a comedy takeoff to the Dirty Harry character, ""Sledge Hammer"" is great entertainment.  It ran for two years in late 1980's and should have continued.  I highly recommend this collection, as well as Season One.  The interaction between Inspector Sledge Hammer, his partner Detective Dori  Doreau and Captain Trunk is great.

My favourite episodes include ""Play It Again, Sledge"" (where Hammer and Dori are suspended from the police force and they open a private eye business and he's visited by the ghost of Humphrey Bogart giving him ""career"" counseling); ""Sledge, Rattle & Roll"") where Sledge and Dori investigate the murder of heavy metal singer Rak Vulture -- Davy Jones of The Monkees playing their manager); ""Hammeroid"" (where Hammer becomes ""Robocop""); and ""Death of a Few Salesmen"" (where Hammer poses as an Australian car magnate, Crocodile Bruce, to catch whoever has been killing used car dealers).
