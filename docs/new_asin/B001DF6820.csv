8293097,2,B001DF6820,"Sorry to say I was very disappointed in this film. The plot was very old and tired, the acting mediocre and characters cliched. I'm glad that I've seen Yannick Bisson in other films. If I judged his acting from this one, I would not have gone out looking for him in other projects.

So two brothers set off to find gold. One of them is gung ho and willing to take chances. The other is not so sure about the success of this venture. There's lots of back and forth between the two about going home or staying. The older brother always seems to win over his doubtful sibling.

Another scene shows the boys entering a saloon. Pretty girl playing a piano. Yannick's character and girl lock eyes. Which of the brothers will end up with the girl? Can you guess?

A accident in a rushing river has the older brother saving the preacher's life after a tumble thru rushing water. All is well and the brother is covered in a strange, golden silt from the river. Wow, what could it be?

Gold is found. Rushes ensue. During it all a very nasty bad guy lurks in the background and kills people. I guess the law here is much nicer than in the USA. We would have strung him up the first time we caught him.  Not so here. He gets booted out of the area after a few lashes and told not to come back. What do you think he did?

The preacher doesn't like gold. A very well-spoken Chinese man does. The constable is either stupid, lazy, cowardly or all of the above.

I made it to episode 4 and gave up. Other viewers have mentioned the quality, or lack there of, of the film.  It's not the sharpest shooting I've ever seen, but I would have watched more of the episodes if not for all of the things I gave above.

I honestly don't see any reason to watch this.",1522022400,,1741,4.2042042042042045

8293099,4,B001DF6820,"I enjoyed this peek into the history of New Zealand, and the performances of the cast. Yannick Bisson did not disappoint. The only drawback is that this dvd is not hd. Otherwise it is an enjoyable collection of adventures that explores western as well as the themes of the gold rush.",1447804800,,283,4.568627450980392
8293100,4,B001DF6820,Ordered this because I just got introduced to Yanick Bisson and wanted to see other work that he has done.  This is a good show for the whole family.  The only thing I don't like is I don't like double sided DVDs and this is that.,1442275200,,230,3.9782608695652173

8293104,5,B001DF6820,"I ordered Gold, and it arrived within 2 days, and in brand new condition!

 As to the content of the disk ""Gold"", I found the story to be very interesting.  The acting was quite good, with Yannick Bisson's portrayal of Johnny Roggin outstanding. Times were quite hard, and it is a good reminder to us in this day and time, how good we have it.  The story is a sort of coming-of-age tale about Johnny Roggin who with his brother made his way to the gold fields in search of the elusive gold. He meets several very colorful characters with their own agendas. His growth as a person, and the events of the times makes for a very colorful plot.

I would recommend this story to anyone.",1411516800,2,681,4.330708661417323

I am a HUGE  fan of Yannick Bisson and am frantically trying to buy everything I can lay my hands on with him in it so was DELIGHTED to find this item on Amason as it is a few years old.  It is a lovely old-fashioned Western set in the Gold Rush era and great family viewing with lots of fantastic horse riding and shooting scenes (none at all gory!), plus a tender love story.  It is something I know I will watch over and over again.  HIGHLY recommended and especially from this Seller.",1383177600,7,766,4.428571428571429
