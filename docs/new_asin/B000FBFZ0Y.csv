8199889,5,B000FBFZ0Y,Best documentary!!! Why isn't this broadcast more often?!? This helped and is helping me in so many ways as I reflect back to where I came from and remember where I'm going. I'm in school now and needed this! Special thanksto the Collin's family and Tod for the gift. May God continue to bless the family in so many ways.,1455408000,2,321,4.366666666666666
8199890,5,B000FBFZ0Y,A great opportunity to SEE the legendary maestro in action. His no-nonsense podium manner gets great results and his interpretations are always right on target.,1380672000,2,160,5.44
8199891,5,B000FBFZ0Y,"The Steinberg/Boston 1962 collaboration on Bruckner's colossal Eighth Symphony is an outstanding musical experience, provided that one can accept the singular flaw that has plagued so many Bruckner symphony scores: cuts.  There are large cuts in the third and fourth movements which, the accompanying notes explain, were necessary to fit the symphony into the television schedule. This is a different aesthetic from what drove Haas and Novak in their revisions.

But in Steinberg's hands what music there is glows. The video is black and white, with occasional lapses in the visual portion of the CD. They are annoying but not crucial to enjoyment of the grandeur, the spirituality, and the enormous range of emotion the music embodies. Steinberg is deeply involved in the music, but spare in gesture. Steinberg has a sense of the whole musical architecture into which each measure and episode fits, giving the music an integrity that is often missing in performances of Bruckner Eighths that thrive on the Big Moments.

In my youth in Pittsburgh, I heard in person Steinberg and his Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra perform this symphony.  I will refrain from comparisons of the Steinberg/Boston live concert with performances by other conductors and orchestras. For me, this one is a keeper, to which I will return both to experience and to learn from Bruckner.  I rated this DVD a 5 despite the unfortunate cuts.",1344211200,7,1412,5.148471615720524
8199892,5,B000FBFZ0Y,"""Legacy"" should be broadcast on national televison. . .There are so many damaging ideas of what happens in the urban ghettoes of our nation. . .I lived in the city of Chicago for sixteen years, and for almost a decade defended convicted felons in the appeals of their convictions. . .Today I teach high school in the Twin Cities (MN) and on a daily basis instruct young people who have fled the mean streets of Chicago's West Side--one of the only places in America that harbors a significant number of families who are subject to multi-generational public assistance dependency (see William Julius Wilson's book: ""When Work Disappears""); yet, in this beautiful documentary the strength of a family--all women--shone through this tragedy. . .I show this to my students every year, not your typical Minnesotans--95% non-white, 60% English as a second language, 90% free and reduced lunch, and it serves as an inspiration for them. . .""Legacy"" should be seen by all Americans. . .",1211673600,8,978,4.969512195121951
8199893,4,B000FBFZ0Y,"Legacy is a sure winner. This documentary covers the lives of three generations of women as they struggle through life. These women live in poverty and desperation, but still manage to love eachother and work as a family unit. The murder of a close family member ends up providing the inspiration for finally securing better lives for themselves.",1198800000,4,346,4.982758620689655
