2284911,4,B0009ETD1E,"This is a very odd, completely over the top film from the seventies that was amazingly enough made and released in Mexico, considering the extreme prevalence of Catholicism there.  If you are in any way a follower or sympathizer of the Catholic faith then you are more or less obligated to be offended by this film.  For those not Catholic however, it is a bizarre story thinly disguised as a morality tale simply to provide an excuse to show a nun who is naked for much of the film and engages in a broad variety of sacreligious activities including but not limited to raping and murdering a 13 year old boy and turning the nunnery into what I guess is supposed to be a house of debauchery (some naked nuns dancing and playing acoustic guitars).  If you like strange movies with gratuitous violence and nudity, this is an absolute must have!!",1122854400,10,843,4.569536423841059
2284912,5,B0009ETD1E,"I was blown away by this film - a real surprise and a fascinating oddity from south of the border. The film has a real primal feel and it's obvious how the makers were attempting to prick the sensibilities of the Catholic church. Sure its low budget, sure the effects aren't up to the standards of Revenge of the Sith - but that's exactly why we should applaud releases like this - if you can't see beyond this then go elesewhere. If you want a truly different experience from mainstream hollywood then this is for you.

Considering the rarity of the material the transfer is stunning and the extras are a fascinating look at a bygone age.",1116028800,4,639,4.461538461538462
2284913,3,B0009ETD1E,"Mondo Macabro's Satanico Pandemonium is a Nunsploitation film from Mexico that at the time of its release was meant to provoke and shock its audience, but which today does neither (at least not as intended), and is at best an amusing entry in this sub-genre of film. As usual, the story is about a nun's fall from grace, in this case brought upon by the temptations of a ubiquitous apple-wielding Lucifer. As the sister continues to plummet  further into darkness, and into Lucifer's apple-scented clutches, she turns from her daily regimen of self flagellation, and other forms of self inflicted torture, and begins hurting the people around her - nuns in the nunnery and a young, innocent shepherd boy who lives in the village.

The film has its fair share of nudity, and a little bloodletting here and there, but Pandemonium there is not. Unfortunately, even the bloody bits in the film are basically rendered impotent due to incompetent effects work. The result is ineffectual gore that is at times mildly amusing, but never really startling. Where the film succeeds admirably is in the cinematography department. Although it gets off to a shaky start with some sloppy second  unit work during the film's opening, the majority of Satanico Pandemonium is bolstered by striking visuals via some remarkably beautiful cinematography.

As always, Mondo Macabro has done a stellar job bringing another little seen film to DVD, with a practically flawless looking print (until the final seconds of the film where some print damage is visible) and a handful of extras. Most notably, there is an interview with the director's son, and the writer of the film, Adolfo Martinez Solares, and a documentary featuring the man behind the Redemption films DVD label, Nigel Wingrove, rhapsodizing (a little too ""passionately"") over the Nunsploitation genre.

Thus far, I have not seen any nunsploitation films which I have loved, so if you're a fan of this sort of film then I would recommend this DVD. Note: I arrived at a 3 star rating by comparing this film to other nunsploitation movies I've seen - mainly Flavia the Heretic and Alucarda - and the overall quality of the DVD itself.",1115942400,24,2173,4.958791208791209

8059801,1,B0009ETD1E,"I expected a nunsploitation masterpiece. This film is badly staged, with a weak story. There is no plot. Many bad scenes to mention, without any ""logic"" or continuity. It seems to me that the director doesn't know much about exploitation filmaking. This film  is extremely overrated!",1408665600,,283,5.1521739130434785
8059802,4,B0009ETD1E,"SATANICO PANDEMONIUM is an utterly insane film from Mexico about Sister Maria, a nun (Cecilia Pezet) who, after having an encounter w/ the devil (Enrique Rocha), goes on a mad spree of sexual deviance and bloody homicide! The main reason for this film's notorious reputation is due to Maria's lust for an underage boy. This was pretty shocking in 1973, and still manages to be disturbing today. Whether she's inside or outside of the convent, Maria is relentless in her pursuit of debauchery, finally committing several murders in order to cover up her sins. It's fascinating to watch her transformation from a devout, Julie Andrews / Audrey Hepburn-type nun into a full-on, eeevil maniac! The ending is sort of a jip, but it was added to placate the church and the censors...",1373673600,,776,4.886363636363637
8059803,5,B0009ETD1E,This is an awesome movie.  A MUST HAVE FOR MOVIE COLECTORS OF HORROR CINEMA. HAUNTING IMAGES. I give this film two very firm thumbs way up.  This is an extremely entertaining film that will leave you extremely satisfied.  I highly recommend it.  Cudos to Mondo Macabro for making this gem available.  Get this movie.  You will not be disappointed.,1364169600,,347,4.796610169491525
8059804,2,B0009ETD1E,"I'd have to say maybe back in the old days when this film was first released it could've passed as a decent horror film for me, but this film just seemed rather poorly put together for me.",1355961600,,188,4.108108108108108
8059805,3,B0009ETD1E,"From Mexico, we have this unique entry in the 'nunsploitation' subgenre: ""Satanico pandemonium"". Directed by Gilberto Martinez Solares whose long and prolific career encompassed a wide variety of films. He made some 50 comedies with German Valdez, better known as 'Tin Tan'. He also produced dozens of the Mexican sex-comedies of the 70's and 80's. I think ""Satanico pandemonium"" was probably made around 1972 or '73, but possibly not released until 1975. It was made on the heels of the uproar and success of Ken Russell's ""The Devils"" 1971, but before the box-office behemoth ""The Exorcist"" 1973. This explains its other title ""La sexorcista"", upon release in 1975. Anyway, it was pretty interesting! It had an almost 'Grimms fairy tales'-like quality to it, of which the same can be said for its religious aspects. Seriously, the film did make the best of its macabre story of cloistered-nuns (circa 18th century Mexico) experiencing lust, visions of the devil, racial injustice, and the ever-present Inquisition, etc. There was even a not so-subtle reference to the biblical: Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Some of the pastoral and idyllic settings resembled: colonial religious-art that can be found in the ornate churches and cathedrals of every Latin American city. Mr. Solares tried very hard to incorporate Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's surrealist style, and one scene was even lifted right out of ""Viridiana"" 1961. The film wasn't filled with excessive goriness or gratuitous sex (although it would have probably made it more interesting), so it didn't go overboard in that respect. The film felt incoherently short (just under 90 min.) which threw-off the plot and continuity. This was possibly due to cuts, brought on from pressure by the Mexican Church and the state-censors too. I have to say Cecilia Pezet was very good as the main character 'Maria'. Mondo Macabro did an excellent job on the restoration and transfer. The DVD picture quality is very good, and the English subtitles were easy to see and read. NTSC, Spanish (English subtitles), NR 89 mins. (Just the fact that these films were made at all, is pretty bizarre!)

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1330646400,3,2168,5.089887640449438
8059806,3,B0009ETD1E,"Satanico Pandemonium (a/k/a El sexorcisto) is a very short (87 minutes) but satisfactory film. Shot in spanish, subtitled in english, there is very little dialogue and some critical scenes are hurried while other unimportant ones drag on and on.

This flick has plenty of blood and nudity to temporarily satisfy gorehounds, but the special effects of 1974 simply weren't special. The acting is surprisingly fairly good and I wonder if the main character had roles in other obscure titles.

While there is very little creativity and originality with regards to Horror coming out of Hollywood these days (read: bad re-makes aplenty), Satanico Pandemonium has enough solid potential to BEG for a GOOD remake!",1171929600,,705,5.230088495575221
8059807,4,B0009ETD1E,"Satanico Pandemonium is a rare example of Mexican Cinema, for starters it's a horror movie without any wrestlers. This statement may seem odd for those unfamiliar with Mexican movies, but back in the 70's most movies with a supernatural theme had either Santo or Blue Demon (or some other famed Mexican wrestlers) as heroes battling werewolves, vampires, or mad scientists. Satanico Pandemonium is a seriuos attempt to tell a spooky story on its own terms.

The story's main protagonist is Sister Maria (the beautiful Cecilia Pezet), who upon meeting Lucifer slowly descends into madness, lesbian lust and murder. There's nudity aplenty and this is one the films main sellings points since the gore is few and far between and hampered by rather low budget special effects. The movie is often categorized in the genre of Nunsploitation and that would be a very fitting label, but there's also a surreal atmosphere that makes Satanico Pandemonium worth watching. Also, the cinematography is just outstanding, with great color throughout the film and lush vistas of the Mexican countryside.

I admit the movie does feel more than a bit dated, though in it's time I'm sure it was rather shocking. Still very much worth a look for those who can appreciate off-beat movies.",1150848000,3,1267,5.057416267942584
8059808,4,B0009ETD1E,"The Italians are well-known for having brought exploitation cinema to new levels of disturbing heights in the 70's with their cannibal and zombie films.  Another sub-genre  that flooded the video-nasty market were ""nunsploitation"" films, which involved nuns doing deviant, illicit, erotic (!) and highly immoral acts.  It all started in 1971 when Ken Russell's ""The Devils"" became a cult hit worldwide. The success of Russell's controversial masterpiece then opened the gates to an entire sub-genre of sleaze in which many of the best-known exploitation auteurs of the 70's chose to capitalize on.  Joe D'Amato's ""Images in a Convent"", Bruno Mattei with ""The Other Hell"", Andrea Bianchi with ""Malabimba"".  Even Lucio Fulci joined the fray in 1990 with ""Demonia"" but by then the genre had already died a derivative death and these films would be relegated to being nothing more than cult exploitation curiosities.

One of the best films from that era in my opinion is ""Satanico Pandemonium""(1975, Mexico).  The film is lensed by none other than Gilberto Solares, who just happens to be Mexico's most prolific filmmaker ever, with close to 200 films to his name, including a bunch of those cheesy ""Santo"" films.

Story: Sister Maria is a nun who is practically a model of saintliness, one who the other sisters look up to and who is always there to lend a hand and console others in troubling times.  However things take a turn for the worse when Maria starts seeing a naked apple-chewing guy who she is convinced must be the devil incarnate.  From then on, Sister Maria begins a downfall into hallucinations, insatiable lust for boys and other sisters within the convent, self-mutilation, stabbing and a host of other unpleasantries.  Sister Maria, somewhat against her will, has now gone on a rampage within the convent and no amount of cold showers will do anything to decrease her insatiable lust for pain and flesh...

If the thought of fully-robed nuns suddenly baring it all and engaging in lesbian lust appeals to you, then Satanico is a real treat.  Director Solares definitely chose his lead actress well, as Cecilia Pezet delivers a fearless performance.  I really liked her transition from model of saintliness to woman of depravity, the descent is gradual and she is extremely convincing in the role.  Satanico Pandemonium is gory but not uber-gory.  However there are so many objectionable things tied in with religion and sexuality that it's bound to make the majority of viewers (especially those Catholic) blush a few times throughout.

The best part of this movie to me is the beautiful way in which it is lensed.  The screen just explodes with colour, the sets and costumes are flawless and it has some absolutely beautiful shots of the Mexican countryside.  This movie is so much more than just a piece of sleaze and I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD, which has been given a gorgeous transfer and includes lots of informative special features.  Amen to that.",1125792000,38,2978,5.014227642276423
8059809,4,B0009ETD1E,"Inspired by Bunuel's unused script that was inspired by Matthew Lewis' excellent novel ""The Monk"", SATANICO PANDEMONIUM is well-made and pretty interesting, not in an erotic sense (even though there is a lot of mediocre nudity) but in a story sense. Virtuous Sister Maria is picking flowers one day outside the convent when she sees the Devil (in human form) naked as a jaybird. She runs away but it's too late cause she's already tempted/possessed and soon goes bonkers.

Her rejection of Christ rampage starts out innocently enough with Maria throwing her prayer book on the floor and a little sinful licking, but before you know it she's killing other nuns and even rapes the stable boy before killing him! Hell yeah!

Maybe not as wild as some (CONVENT OF SINNERS) in the ""nunsploitation"" genre, but definitely more entertaining than others (THE SINFUL NUNS OF SAINT VALENTINE). The picture on the Mondo Macabro DVD is better than I expected.  I also really liked the psychedelic music.",1124668800,20,990,4.951807228915663
