2478697,2,B000E13NLI,"APPOINTMENT FOR A KILLING is another one of those early 90s tv movies that gave tv stars a chance to ""stretch"" their wings and try something different from their current series.  Too bad they didn't put a little more life into their portrayals.  Based on ""true"" incident, the movie follows the psychotic crimes of dentist Corbin Bernsen who has been offing people for about twenty years.  He is currently married to Markie Post (who appears to be on Sominex), and has a sleazy mistress (Suzanne Barnes, over the top indeed) and an ex-con sidekick (Don Swayze in a wasted character).  He confesses his latest crime to Markie and she goes to the FBI (a stoic Kelsey Grammer) who uses her to get a confession out of Bernsen.  Corbin's real life mom (YOUNG AND RESTLESS's indefatigable Jeanne Cooper) also appears.  There's little suspense and a very wimpy climax.",1154822400,6,860,4.816326530612245

My uncle (by marriage) was a twisted man no doubt.",1447977600,,153,4.133333333333334
8103713,5,B000E13NLI,Excellent story and film. Well acted could not fault it. Far better than some of the modern rubbish,1442361600,,99,4.555555555555555
8103714,5,B000E13NLI,"The story line in this movie is unbelievable but true.  A devoted, successful, highly-respected dentist has an interesting hobby besides adultery--murder for profit.  He murders in-laws & husbands & splits the insurance payouts with the wives.  The role is superbly played by Corbin Bernsen, who more than makes up for any flaws in the movie.  Look for Patrick Swayze's lookalike brother in the role of ""Business Partner"" in the murder plots.  The movie is definitely worth watching & keeps you tense throughout - especially the ending.",1435881600,,536,5.186046511627907

8103716,1,B000E13NLI,On paper a good idea - but the protagonists downfall was very flimsy and the climax felt like something which they'd come up with at the last minute.,1387238400,,149,4.357142857142857
