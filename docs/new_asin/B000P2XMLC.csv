8188542,2,B000P2XMLC,"This was a disappointment since it gives an extreme overview of what this was was about.  I was expecting a lot more since this is one of the more important events of the 19th Century and one of the many events that led to the First World War.

It is good if you have no idea what the Franco-Prussian War was or what it was about, but it doesn't go very deep into that topic.  I was expecting a lot more on the events leading up to, the battles, and the outcome of the war.  This was like a refresher course on the topic, but there is a lot more importance to this event than this video gives justice.  For example, this led to the end of the ""Second Empire"" in France and the events leading to the Third Republic.  Additionally, it was instrumental in the unification of Germany.  I would also add that it was probably a factor in the rise of Nazism due to the quick victory of the German Army in this conflict being compared to the ""surprising"" defeat in WWI.

I didn't really spend a lot of money on this, but I did get what I paid for in a product that was not as informative as it should have been.",1427500800,5,1103,4.097674418604651

8188545,4,B000P2XMLC,The negative reviews seem to want another level of detail. The DVD gives a reasonably accurate and detailed analysis of the military events but blossoms with the description of the Commune. The product is a fine introduction and should either lead students to probe deeper or give others a solid if basic understanding of the events.,1363132800,9,333,4.964285714285714
8188546,4,B000P2XMLC,"Those looking for a sensational war film will be disappointed. Those looking for action, will be equally disappointed.

This DVD provides a well-balanced historical review of a very European war. Also in many respects a very important war, mostly due to its far-reaching political consequences. Anyway, a war resulting from the complex European politics most Americans aren't used to  --  and don't like.

Be prepared for a couple of British university historians, extensively explaining this war and its whereabouts to you. Military as well as politically. The picturing on this DVD is meagre, for the simple reason that in 1870-'71 films did not exist and photography was primitive and clumsy.

Some criticism may be found in the (too) scarce use of maps. As well as in the lack of any modern shots of important 1870-'71 sites, and its memorials.

Watching this DVD is like getting a lecture on university level. It may be a little 'dry', but its quality is good.",1251849600,12,965,4.962732919254658
8188547,1,B000P2XMLC,"This video is terrible.  There must be hundreds of books with illustrations on the Franco Prussian war and yet they use the same pictures and engravings over and over again.  They also over employ film related to the napoleonic wars and even WWI.  There is no real critical analysis of the military campaigns, which is what I was really expecting.  I was sadden to realize that I has wasted my money",1248998400,8,399,4.577464788732394
8188548,1,B000P2XMLC,"This is not a very good short film on the Franco-Prussian War. It jumps around to much, and doesn't seem to have a focus. The actors used look awful. The film uses little art from the period or about the war.  I wasted my money because I'll never use this as a teaching tool.",1197331200,8,275,4.092592592592593
