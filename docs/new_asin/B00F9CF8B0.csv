8613391,5,B00F9CF8B0,"This is the longer, European version (nearly four hours), of DAY OF THE SIEGE, which was the American release version. It fills in a few of the story lines in the shorter release. As in DAY OF THE SIEGE, the language of the film is English (there are Polish and other subtitles available). I can recommend both versions unhesitatingly. F. Murray Abraham truly stands out as the Blessed Marco d'Aviano, and his role in the famous defense (1683) of Vienna against an immense Turkish army under Kara Mustafa is rightly highlighted, without falling into the pitfalls and cliches of viewing history through politically correct lens.  The Turkish Grand Vizier is treatly fairly, not as a caricature, but he and the Blessed Marco are world's apart, as the films rightly shows. There is a remarkable confrontation between them later in the film, and neither one bends in his faith and beliefs. And, indeed, that is the way it was and should be... American purchasers need to check the DVD format; but, for certain, if your player supports this format, you needn't hesitate. I ordered my copy from a fine Polish seller, and I had the DVD in less than a week.",1427587200,3,1149,4.745
