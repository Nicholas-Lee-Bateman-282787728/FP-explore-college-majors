I think it should be noted on the description that this Blu Ray is recorded in PAL System. Big mistake!!",1351728000,2,370,4.6923076923076925

8434914,1,B004LV32N6,"Video Quality it's so poor. That I think an Old VHS movie has more video quality than this concert.
Dissapointing Blu Ray concert. Don't waste your money on this one.",1482019200,,166,4.566666666666666
8434915,3,B004LV32N6,"I was finally able to watch this almost all the way through, and when I got towards the end it just freezes, both on the concert and the documentary. When I tried to start the DVD again my playstation kept giving me an error code, which I looked up. The code means there is an error with the DVD itself. When it first happened I just assumed it was my player and thought nothing of it.  I looked at the disc and the disc is perfectly fine, so I am not sure what was wrong. Other than that, delivery was prompt and was packaged well",1466726400,,531,4.057142857142857
8434916,5,B004LV32N6,Avantasia is one of the greatest super groups in the world! Highly recommend. Bought this for my Dad for Christmas and he loves it!,1430611200,,131,4.5
8434917,5,B004LV32N6,I found this band after I heard one of my favorite singers Roy Khan did a song with them. I listened to the song with Roy and then I listened to their other music. I found them to be a great change in rock/metal.,1422057600,,212,3.840909090909091
8434918,5,B004LV32N6,"Some people will complain about the video quality not being up to par but if your wondering about the content,  hands down this is one of the greatest concerts to date for this genera of music. This tops Live Crime (Queensryche) in my book. What particularly impressed me is that every song in this concert packs a huge punch due to excellent song writing as well as the awesome cast of top notch metal artists Tobias has assembled. It never gets boring or peters out. The mix of instruments was done very with all instruments blending nicely with no one particularly dominant. And about that video quality, I would compare it to what you get from the typical cable/u-verse feeds. There is a little compression blur here and there but it is virtually un-noticable as you get sucked in to the actual concert it-self. Like anything else, if you are looking for it, you will see it but, if you just chill and watch, the concert will blow you away. If you are into Progressive/Melodic Power Metal this Blu-ray is a must have.",1395273600,,1021,4.579234972677596
8434919,3,B004LV32N6,The show itself is not bad though I wanted to see more of featured artist from the albums. But the quality of video is so poor that ou loose much of the energy from Tobias and his friends. They should have noted that it was recorded in such a quality.,1386633600,,251,4.04

So you change your mind & still get a headline slot.
Yes, Avantasia is that much in demand.",1372636800,,164,4.32258064516129
8434922,5,B004LV32N6,"Avantasia is one of my favorite bands right now, and since they will probably never play in the US, this is the closest I will ever get to seeing them live.  My only real complaint was no Michael Kiske, but thats no real biggie, because the rest of the DVD was fantastic.",1359936000,,271,4.211538461538462
8434923,4,B004LV32N6,"Tobias Sammet has emerged as one of the most creative forces of the European metal scene in this decade with this show, the culmination of one of the most spectacular collaborations of the last decade.  The cornerstone of course is the stunning ""Scarecrow"" album and its many great songs.

If you haven't ever heard the amazing 2008 CD ""The Scarecrow"" by Avantasia, you really should!  It is one of the best metal albums ever made.  Yes, I said it.  But when your supporting cast includes Roy Khan, Jorn Lande, Michael Kiske, Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann, Amanda Somerville, Eric Singer, Alice Cooper, Miro, Kai Hansen, Rudolph Schenker, this is not a boast.  This is True Metal!

For the last decade we have had a flood of opera and symphony into the European metal scene.  This was not a bad thing.  Some stunning, complex, rich, subtle music was made.  But with the 2008 release of ""The Scarecrow"", I think we saw the pendulum swing back (truer today in 2012) to more of a basic True Metal, or a Heavy Metal style reminiscent of its roots in the late 70s and 80s with bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Saxon, Sabbath (with Dio singing), etc.

So even though the cast of characters are heavy players in the operatic / symphonic metal scene over the last decade, I would not say this work goes too deeply into those themes, although it would be incorrect to say ""The Scarecrow"" is absolutely not a symphonic metal work.  It certainly is.  But it also heralds a return back away from the operatic, to the pure rock vocals of Heavy Metal.  of True Metal.

Tobias Sammet gets most of the credit there, and his older band Edguy was pretty much meat&potatoes metal too, so he is a good apostle for this return to roots.  And to accentuate his points he chose one of the most ferocious, as well as one of the most ""throwback sounding"" metal monsters alive today, Jorn Lande.

Lande adds the thunder to Sammet's lightning.  Their duets on ""The Scarecrow"" and ""Another Angel Down"" on the Scarecrow CD were some of the greatest moments in metal in the entire 2000s decade.  If you've heard the songs you know this is fact, it is not mere hyperbole.

With so much talent in Europe, these collaborative efforts become something greater than a mere band.  Avantasia is a Supergroup.  You are getting nothing less than pure professionalism, impeccable taste and passion with their products.

The sound on this disc is quite good, as is the video quality.  It definitely feels like a Blu Ray quality show, not something shot in standard definition and then upscaled.  Clarity and color are good for a rock concert shot at night.

This is the best performance I have seen from Sascha Paeth and Oliver Hartmann on guitar.  Paeth especially was ""On"" here and plays especially well.  I esteem Hartmann even more due to his amazing singing voice - arguably better than any of the others here - and Hartmann's guitar skills are not to be underestimated, he is in fact a very accomplished neoclassical shredder on demand - but Paeth seems to get the better of him this night.

The set list is amazing and Avantasia throw in just enough lighter material to allow you to catch your breath between the faster, true metal songs.  Luckily we get treated to some of the songs that are essential that weren't on ""The Scarecrow"" album, like ""Reach out for the Light"", and ""Serpents in Paradise"".

At their most metal, Avantasia remind one of Helloween, Rhapsody, Gamma Ray, the oldschool Eurometal bands from late 90s.

I can't say enough about what a good frontman Tobias Sammet is.  He handles the crowd with class and charm.

The bottom line is that this is a great show in HD quality by a great band filled with total pro musicians and playing very listenable, very good quality heavy metal, played the European way.

You won't regret buying this disc.

The only criticism I can offer here of this very-well made Blu Ray concert event is that Tobias' voice unfortunately has deteriorated a little bit, and though he warms up 3 or 4 songs into the set, he does not give his best performance on arguably the two best songs from ""The Scarecrow"", that being the title track, and the blistering ""Another Angel Down.""  Sammet recovers, but he seems very winded at the beginning of the show and can barely hit the notes in ""The Scarecrow"".  Picking ""Another Angel Down"" to follow it was unfortunate, as Sammet appears completely gassed during that 3rd song.  The pace was a little quick, and Jorn Lande stumbles a little trying to keep up a faster pace than on the album cut.  Compared to their Wacken 2011 daytime performance, this Blu Ray show is slightly below it in quality of singing from both Sammet and his amazing guest, Jorn Lande.  As ""Another Angel Down"" is probably my favorite Avantasia song, it was definitely disappointing that Sammet had his worst performance on my favorite song.",1352246400,,4870,4.675675675675675
