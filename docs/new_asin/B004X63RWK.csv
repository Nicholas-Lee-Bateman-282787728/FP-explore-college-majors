4492278,5,B004X63RWK,"I hate DVD-R's and won't buy then. However, regarding the movie - ***** (5 stars). It gives an excellent insight to the early newspaper business in New York. Park Road is the street that held the many papers of the time(the 1880's).",1343606400,,232,4.5476190476190474
4492279,3,B004X63RWK,"such a treasure of history of late 19th century newspaper business, Sam took on the whole enchilada with impressive results! Some technical detail that was hard to appreciate, Mergenthaler's Linotype machine seemed surreal and the tactics utilized by competitors demonstrates the guerilla warfare typically employed by smaller dictatorships to remain in control... surprised the ending alluded to the goodwill of man, (or in this case woman), with talent and hard work prevailing... high recommend for printing press tech and overcoming many odds to achieve a dream...",1342224000,3,568,5.616279069767442
4492280,5,B004X63RWK,"I, too received the wrong movie when I ordered Park Row. Amazon and the manufacturer are both aware of the mixup. I received an email from Amazon about a week ago stating that they have gotten a new shipment of corrected Park Row dvds, and they will mail me one  within the next week. Haven't heard anything more yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed as I've wanted to see this title for a long time!
If you want this title just wait a couple of weeks before ordering it and Amazon should mail you the correct one.
UPDATE: Just got my corrected copy of Park Row from Amazon. They have the right movie now so no one should hesitate to order. Love the movie!! Transfer looks good too.",1308700800,13,684,4.3023255813953485
4492281,1,B004X63RWK,"""Park Row"" is the one Sam Fuller movie that many Fuller fans (including me) have been waiting for....well, the wait continues.
I received my copy of ""Park Row"" this week. Both the DVD case, and the disc itself are labeled ""Park Row."" However, when I went to play it, the film ""Harry in Your Pocket"" was on the disc, NOT ""Park Row.""

I'm going to return it to Amazon, but since I've discovered that I'm not the only one this has happened to, I will NOT ask for a replacement.
I'm going to opt for a refund.

The first DVD company that manufactured these ""MGM Movies-On-Demand"" discs was dumped because of mistakes like this (as well as lots of 'freeze-up' image problems, and discs that wouldn't load properly).
Now, it looks at though this 2nd manufacturer of MGM's M.O.D. products is just as bad as the first manufacturer.

I got stuck with some of the first MGM line. My set of ""Highway Patrol, Season One"" is chock full of problems, but because it's a 12-disc set, I didn't catch the problems until after the 45-day warranty ran out.
Now, Amazon won't take back that 12-disc set, so I'm just out the $50++ cost.
Well, it won't happen again.

Once I get my refund on ""Park Row,"" I'm finished with this MGM M.O.D. line.

If ever there was a case of ""let the buyer beware,"" this is it.",1307664000,16,1285,4.405063291139241

8446244,5,B004X63RWK,"A vigorous Sam Fuller film (which of his films isn't?) that looks great despite the low budget.  A must-see for Sam Fuller fans, and a fascinating period piece for anyone else.",1473465600,2,176,4.67741935483871
8446245,4,B004X63RWK,"Found it to be educational, since it involved early newspaper and in fighting.  All involved the invention of linotype (originall called line of type) which speed up type setting for Newspaper in the late 1800s.  Pretty good acting as well.",1453507200,,240,4.975
8446246,5,B004X63RWK,Great movie. Need more like it!,1433894400,,31,4.333333333333333
8446247,5,B004X63RWK,"Sam Fuller's love song to the newspaper biz. If you're already a fan of his work, this is definitely worth seeing but not necessarily the best movie to start with. If you're new to Samuel Fuller, see Pickup on South a Street, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, or White Dog.",1431820800,2,271,4.44
8446248,5,B004X63RWK,Well acted and admirably captures the era. The character of Davenport certainly appears to be based on Erskine Sanford's character in Citizen Kane.,1415577600,2,147,5.434782608695652

8446250,3,B004X63RWK,"I purchased this movie on the basis of it's letterpress printing content. I hoped there may have been more presses running, but I guess that doesn't sell movies to the general public. A little bit over the top acting, but interesting little story. Some genuine letterpress things happening, although I've never seen compositors working like these guys!",1375574400,,352,5.192982456140351
8446251,4,B004X63RWK,"This is a film that Sam Fuller wrote, directed, produced, and paid for himself. It really captures the time period it is portraying with great sets and costumes. It never tries too hard to tell anything more than the story it sets out to, the birth of the modern newspaper. For those who only know Sam's pulp fiction films, don't expect that sort of thing with Park Row. His love of the subject was personal and great, since Sam himself had worked in the paper's, before he joined up to fight the Nazi's in North Africa. His fondness of the pioneers of modern print comes through in every written word of the script and spoken by the great actor's who inhabit the film. It's a valentine to the industry that gave him his first career and jump started his love of storytelling.

The print for this release is mostly in good shape and does not detract from the viewing experience.",1349654400,3,878,4.4875
