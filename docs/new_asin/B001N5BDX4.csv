3711300,5,B001N5BDX4,"Imprint was great the first time, but I have found that every time I watch it I find a new detail that I missed. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and never get bored.

The thoughtful treatment of Native American culture also provides an interesting backdrop to a suspenseful story.",1234137600,,307,4.385964912280702
3711301,5,B001N5BDX4,"This is a great thriller! I watched it 3 times and each time it made me jump and gasp. The ending was shocking and wonderful to watch. This movie sparks conversation and moves beyond the word ""thriller"". Imprint is a must see!",1233446400,3,226,4.404761904761905
3711302,5,B001N5BDX4,"I first viewed this film alongside the director, Michael Linn, at the Sedona Film Festival in April 08, which could have put me in an awkward position had I not liked the film. And quite honestly, I thought this would be a typical suspense movie with an ending I could figure out in the first ten minutes. Happily, I was wrong! With a skillfully written plot, an outstanding cast, and some chilling special effects, this film did not disappoint. The unusual twists kept me on the edge and the ending totally blew me away. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a fresh take on a suspense/thriller.",1231977600,46,614,4.590909090909091
3711303,5,B001N5BDX4,"I was lucky enough to watch an advanced copy from the director.  This is the first film I have watched in a very long time that made me think  after it was over and I immediately watch it again.  Smart and stylish, the film keeps you guessing until the very end.  Finally, an intelligent thriller.  Every actor plays their role perfectly, the film was shot and directed with great care.  All I can say is BUY IT!",1231977600,7,412,4.285714285714286

3711305,1,B001N5BDX4,"More ""Native American"" tropes forcefully pushed to their limit.  I kept expecting Tom Laughlin to appear as Billy Jack on a vision quest...too bad he didn't.  No highs, no lows, no tension, no suspense, no nothing.  Just a series of flat, static scenes with flat, static dialogue and a thin, ethereal soundtrack.  This is a case-in-point proving that a ""Native American"" theme does not automatically impart a quality story, much less an interesting one.",1525910400,,453,5.081081081081081

3711307,5,B001N5BDX4,Great film to watch. I knew nothing going into it. I'm glad I watched it. Good acting. Good story. Why not on the big screen? I'd have paid for the movie ticket to watch it in the theater.,1525651200,,188,3.973684210526316

3711311,5,B001N5BDX4,"I dislike violent movies and I usually avoid murder mysteries. I even avoided watching this movie for that reason.  I do watch Native American themed documentaries or movies. I BUY NEW DVDS OR BUY THE VIDEO TO SUPPORT NATIVE ACTORS OR FILM MAKERS.
  I really liked this movie, I am glad I relented.",1524528000,,298,4.584905660377358
3711312,5,B001N5BDX4,"Very good Native American movie. It brings to light the heritage and beliefs of what is around you that can lend a hand if you listen. Acting was good I would not rate it a B movie.. It was life,",1515369600,,195,3.9

3711318,5,B001N5BDX4,"although it's not supernatural to the Lakota, it's part of their life.  I absolutely loved it!  Spellbound from start to finish and didn't want it to end.  All the characters and storyline were so believable, I wish there would be a sequel for Shayla and what good she would do for the reservation.  I have so much compassion for the native Americans and it breaks my heart to think of all the wrongs done to them.",1500940800,,414,4.407894736842105

3711322,5,B001N5BDX4,"Other reviewers have described it well. Although it was low budget and some of the plot was rushed it was a wonderful insight into the world of the reservation, how visions from the world of spirit must be understood through the passage of time, and was in general just a lovely unique piece. It had flaws but it felt like it captured something genuine--it left an Imprint on me.",1499731200,,379,4.507246376811594

3711324,2,B001N5BDX4,"I detest writing a poor review, because I believe it is hard to bare one's passion for art to others. So while applaud the effort I did not agree with the reviews that said the script, acting, and production were top notch. I was not surprised by the ending. It was predictable, yet the villain did not even have a believable motive
. The film starts with the murder of a woman, and a young man wrongly convicted of the crime. I don't want to give any spoilers, but the film never does answer the question of who did kill the woman. They don't even seem to care about her at all.",1499385600,,579,4.178571428571429

3711331,5,B001N5BDX4,"I concur with other reviews that raved. Well written, excellent cast. I was impressed with the acting skills. The main character was on point.  Much better than an A list over the top Hollywood movie. It felt authentic. Filmed in South Dakota with it seems with a lot of tribal members. Very unique movie.",1498262400,,305,4.648148148148148

to watch at all, I say give it a try.",1498003200,,273,3.7241379310344827
3711334,4,B001N5BDX4,it was a low budget film. If you look past the poor effects and focus on the story then it's a decent thriller! Interesting plot and the acting wasn't half bad!,1497916800,,160,4.193548387096774
3711335,3,B001N5BDX4,Boring. Needs more than a cliche wolf and Indian folk lore to make this interesting.,1497744000,,84,4.666666666666667
3711336,5,B001N5BDX4,"This time, my five stars means, yet again, something other than ""I loved this movie."" The five stars mean that YOU will probably love this movie. Also highest possible praise for the many, many aspects of it that were sterling, gorgeous. But the movie was ruined for me, BY ME, not by the movie when, at the very beginning, I could clearly see where the storyline was going, and I so hoped I was wrong and would be surprised, but I wasn't.  (NO SPOILERS SO DON'T WORRY!) I am a screenwriter with a man who won an Oscar for screenwriting a movie you would DEFINITELY know. And I now see (STILL NO SPOILERS) things in movies that I would have never ever noticed, if I hadn't worked with this genius and written with him, and if I hadn't watched him do the same things in our storylines that this movie did, to create surprise for the viewer. So I guess I'm kinda wrecked for being surprised at movies any more. Before this screenwriter taught me, I couldn't even follow PLOTS! So as long as you are not a screenwriter, you WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE LIKE WILD!",1497657600,5,1052,4.36734693877551
3711337,5,B001N5BDX4,"I loved it. It was honest, clear and very real. I would love for them to focus more on the relationship with the wolf and horse but . . .I guess that was left on the cutting room floor :D.  Anyway, It seems that the movie was made by a family who are Native American which helps greatly and it seemed to stay real. This is set up for a sequal and I would love to see that happen.  ENJOY :D",1497571200,2,389,3.7901234567901234
3711338,5,B001N5BDX4,This movie is excellent.  Not what you think.  Lots of twists and turns.  Beautiful acting and characters.  This is a true gem and a must see.  Hope you get the message.,1497484800,,169,4.32258064516129
3711339,1,B001N5BDX4,No Native would walk under an arc with a cross above it. Bad medicine of the white man.  This is clearly an attempt by Hollywood to portray a fantastical account of our spirituality.,1497484800,,182,4.515151515151516
3711340,5,B001N5BDX4,"Absolutely loved this movie. The story had me spellbound. If you like the current genre of CGI / gratuitous violence/ flash flash flash, blood spurting/ ""horror"" with fake ghosts or copious blood ... this is not for you. However, if you are drawn to well written and well crafted pieces of film making that use old fashioned good writing, direction and acting to create atmosphere... watch.  I found the scenes in the isolated little house on Pine Ridge rather scary. Clearly the woman is seeing something supernatural, but what? The twist towards the end is brilliant; I did not guess it and thought it totally plausible. I really appreciated the inclusion of some Spiritual Lakota values in the form of the Grandfather who advises her to go cleanse and asks her if she's hearing voices. As he says, most people don't listen. Do you listen? That scene at the memorial for Wounded Knee was full of palpable energy and sentiment. I also liked the inclusion of the one word Tom says to the boyfriend ""Respect"".  Aho!  I have spent time on Pine Ridge and am fascinated by the Lakota culture which I consider to be one of the most inspiring & wise in the world.  It was very well acted by all, very well directed and in short, a shining example of a terrific production on not much money. I also loved the music... gosh the Linn family seems to be multi talented.",1497398400,4,1359,4.580246913580247
3711341,5,B001N5BDX4,"Wow, wow, wow!  Epic indie movie set on the Pine Ridge Reservation.  I can't believe it received such few stars.  I can't believe it received such low user ratings on IMDB.  The story of a young Lakota attorney who has embraced the world outside the reservation.  She comes home to see her dying brother and is beset by visions.  She trys to see the truth the visions are showing her but has trouble because she has lost touch of that part of her life.

Incredible twist at the end, something I never expected, takes this movie to the next level.  I highly recommend it.",1497312000,2,570,4.413461538461538

3711345,5,B001N5BDX4,"Thank goodness there are other film narratives, however rare, other than White Hollywood's vision of Native American culture. The point of view, rhythm of language, physical landscape, and female protagonist in this film are as intriguing, refreshing, and thoughtful as other Chris Eyre projects. If you want the usual high-action-white savior-cowboys-n-injuns movie, please skip this film as you will be very disappointed. If you are interested in multiple perspectives on Native culture and enjoy mystery-thrillers with unusual plot twists, give this film an open-minded viewing.",1496966400,4,581,5.847058823529411

3711706,3,B001N5BDX4,"Imprint (Michael Linn, 2007)

Imprint is one of a handful of movies that have historically made it to my Netflix instant list by mistake--I thought it was another movie of the same name, rated it, couldn't figure out (hey, I was new to Netflix streaming at the time) how to unrate it, and so figured I'd watch it instead. (If you know me, you'll know that the movie I mistook it for was Takashi Miike's infamous Masters of Horror entry of the same name). In other words, I would probably have never found this movie except by accident. I'm glad I did.

Plot: Shayla Stonefeather (Unearthed's Tonantizin Carmelo) has worked hard to leave her past on the rez behind, and she's now a successful prosecuting attorney in Colorado. She's got to tread lightly as the movie opens, however; she's prosecuting Robbie Whiteshirt (Joseph Medicine Blanket in his only screen appearance to date), a Lakota Indian from her reservation who has never once wavered in proclaiming his innocence. Rumors and allegations of conflict of interest abound from both sides. In the middle of the trial, Stonefeather gets word that her father is dying, and returns to the reservation to say goodbye. While she's there, Robbie Whiteshirt is murdered, and something seems to be reaching out from the spirit world to let Stonefeather know that she is more involved in this case--and rez life--than she thinks, or than she wants to remember.

It's a low-budget indie flick, so if you go into it expecting some sort of Michael Bay cheesefest, you're bound to be disappointed. But take the movie on its own terms and it has some goods to offer, though it's not the best movie you will see in any given month. The plot is well-presented and believable enough if you believe in the spiritual-realm stuff, the acting is about baseline for a movie of this variety (in other words, I'm not going to count points off for, shall we say, some overly-enthusiastic amateurism), and Linn (Into His Arms) has a pretty good idea of what to do with a camera to get the mood and atmosphere he desires. No, the special effects aren't the greatest, but they show an inventiveness with a minuscule budget that has to be respected. This is not a bad little movie at all--give it a look. ***",1357948800,4,2237,4.701530612244898
3711707,5,B001N5BDX4,"So I'm a sucker for Native American movies. This one is a major keeper. I'm not going to give away the story, but if you like paranormal stuff, you got to buy this one. Very very cool.",1356048000,2,184,4.0
3711708,5,B001N5BDX4,"This movie was excellent. Took a while for the story to spin up and ended with some twisty suspense. I love being surprised and this movie hit the spot. The acting was great, story pacing was great. Best part for me, though, was the female protagonist who didn't whine, whimper or scream when confronted with the supernatural. Sure, she's scared, but she just keeps pushing through until she finds the answers. And the unexpected ending: WOOOOO!",1353110400,2,445,4.868421052631579
3711709,3,B001N5BDX4,"I'm always a bit leery when I see a given name hogging all the credits in a film. How many film makers are so talented they can cover all the main bases in production? That's the case here and it hurt the overall outcome.

Here's the scoop. A female Native American lawyer from the Dakotas, now living in Denver, has just prosecuted and won a case where a juvenile was charged and convicted, as an adult, for murder. The young boy was subsequently killed in an escape attempt. She now heads back home to the reservation to see her dad who is on his death bed. An unsolved mystery lingers in regard to the whereabouts and well being of her brother who has had a troubled past. Strange things begin to happen around the house that lead her to question both her place in the Native American community as well as help answer recent and past questions.

This has a lot of good things going for it. The viewer gets a good taste of the culture and mysticism in the Native American community. How time doesn't exist. Past present and future flow together and imprints of things and events are left in the earth and sky. It shows the resemblance to the African American community in regard to their current troubles. As our heroine, Shayla, notes: Yes the white man done us wrong but we cannot blame him for the pain we are inflicting on ourselves now. She wants out. She has a white boyfriend with political aspirations and no longer lives with her people on the reservation where she could be doing a lot of good. Now she's back and there are portents. A horse from a neighbor's ranch keeps showing up. A wolf, who may or may not be real, seems to want to show her something. She hears things and has visions. They lead her to answers and a realization of what she should be doing in her life.

This is a well intentioned but less than solid effort. As I mentioned in the opening, Mike Linn wore too many hats. Director, writer, producer, music score and editor is too much to expect one person to handle well. He should have delegated some of those tasks to those better suited for them. He did everything Okay, so he ended up with an Okay movie. Some of the writing was too pointed and sincere. It needed more flavor. There was too much focus on the story and not enough on the atmosphere. It was totally devoid of humor so there was nothing to relieve the darkness of it all. And though this is more a mystery thriller than a horror movie there were some cheap horror movie scares. One scene, involving spirit imprints, was almost painful to watch it was so ill conceived. He also needed to coax better performances from the actors. Like everything else, they were just Okay.

This is not a bad watch and it gave me much food for thought. It just needed punching up on pretty much evey end. I hope Mike Linn watches this a thousand times so he doesn't make the same mistakes on his next effort.",1351814400,,2890,4.3861940298507465
3711710,4,B001N5BDX4,"I enjoyed this little gem quite a bit. Beautiful art, lovely landscapes, and a cast that actually includes Native Americans in a Native American based film.

The main character, Shayla Stonefeather, a Lakota woman, educated in law and working as a prosecutor in ""Denver"" (it was actually filmed in South Dakota) returns home after prosecuting a young Lakota man for murder. The young man is killed in an escape attempt, leaving Shayla depressed and questioning her choices. Upon returning to her home on the rez, to see her dying father, she begins to see what she thinks of as the ghost of her missing brother.

I adore ghost stories, and the concept behind this one was excellently done. I wasn't able to figure out the end of the movie, which was cool.

Overall a lovely little indie film I would have given a five if the very end of the movie hadn't been somewhat of a downer for me.

This film was made with real stars, genuine sentiment and excellent effects, the story, the screenplay and overal production are all appropriate and clear. I applaud.

I don't see why more stores, libraries, and rental companies don't stock it. Its a real winner for me. I gathered several of my friends to watch it and everyone agreed. Please make more supernatural thillers from a Native American perspective like this.

I never once suspected the ending (and I really believe that anyone who claims otherwise is a boastful liar), and the consistent suspenseful moments kept me on the edge of my seat.  But what makes the movie so memorable is the greater lesson it teaches about our responsibility to others, our debt to the past and the support we should always show for our people.

I also really like to see us break away from stereotypes about Pine Ridge.  A family with a large house, a sizable herd, and laptops and cellphones?  Right on - yes, America, the Lakota DO live in the 21st century.",1263081600,28,787,4.514084507042254
3711721,4,B001N5BDX4,"It's hard to believe this thriller was shot for 150,000 USD (that's what I read somewhere - I apologize if my info is wrong!). The plot is not very complicated, but well thought through. What makes this movie stand out is the setting on a Native American reservation. This gives the story an unusual flavor, and you get to see faces that don't show up in ""standard"" movies. And what you cannot always expect in a mini-budget movie is solid actors - here the acting is great!",1251676800,3,474,4.459770114942529
3711722,5,B001N5BDX4,"This is a very good movie, you will have to watch it from the beginning to the end. It will throw you a loop until the end. Meaning it is alittle scary and like they say a six sence kind of movie but with native americans casting in it. I think it was good enough for at least a 4 star or more.",1242345600,3,294,3.6825396825396823
3711723,5,B001N5BDX4,"I have to admit, I picked this movie up as a rental, because of the lovely, mysterious artwork on the cover. There was also reference to the fact that it won 'Best Film,' at the 32nd American Indian Film Festival for 2007. I casually thought I'd give it a try, but my expectations weren't high.  At the time, I didn't know I was holding a little Indie jewel.

I'm still struggling with placing this film into a genre. It's not slasher horror, because it's free of blood and guts, but it WILL frighten you, at times.  It's not just a thriller, because of the supernatural aspects.  It is also an atypical ghost story. I think it is a category of its own, encompassing a little of several genres that many of us love.  But, what makes it so interesting is the spiritual aspects, and magical realism of the Lakota, woven throughout, which culminates into a crescendo of an unexpected ending.

Shayla Stonefeather (Tonantzin Carmelo) is the chief protagonist, a Native American Attorney, returning home to the reservation to visit her father, who is facing death. She is initially very ambivalent about this visit.  She has allowed herself to be removed from the traditions of her people, preferring to base her beliefs on science, rather than superstition and magic.  In 1 hour, 28 minutes, we witness all of her current and past beliefs challenged, as she begins receiving messages from the spirit world. These messages represent violence and death, but who are they intended for---and who are the intended victims.  The supporting cast, including Michael Spears (a Tribal Officer), her mother(Carla-Rae Holland) and the Medicine Man (Lakota Chief David Bald Eagle) all give top notch performances, as they assist Shayla on her journey of self discovery.

I think that viewers need to keep in mind, that this movie was not high on budget and, from the extras, it was shot in just three weeks time. So, you won't get any of the heart-pounding CGI afforded major productions. But, the scenery is beautiful---the countryside, the roaming buffalo, the stalking wolf and the noble pinto horse. You will feel the splendor of S. Dakota.

I applaud the producers of this movie, for giving an almost all Native American cast the opportunity to shine, in a contemporary film, minus the stereotypical images.  We could use more like these.  In fact, I can even envision a series---maybe Shayla's character teaming up with Tribal Police in solving crimes---a little romance.  Yeah, it could work!",1241827200,147,2482,4.9066985645933014
3711724,1,B001N5BDX4,"Since I respect anyone that wants to watch this, I won't give away much of anything (though if you're above 5 years old, you'll have it figured out in about 10 seconds). The performances are fine (and probably the only thing I can recommend here), but it's nauseating ""reverse-stereotype"" conceit is beyond the pail. The writer's/filmmaker's one-track-minded hate is the only ""imprint"" left when the final credits are rolling and it's really sad to see it on display. I am part of a minority here in the U.S. (albeit not Native American) and I can tell you that this kind of thing does NOT help advance us, as a human civilization, beyond the sins, prejudices and horrible mistakes of the past...it only feeds into them.

Total and complete garbage packaged as ""art.""",1240358400,15,767,4.8106060606060606
3711725,5,B001N5BDX4,"As an avid movie fan and collector of Native American films, I found this spooky little gem well worth the investment.  Where is Hollywood?  There is an abundance of Native American talent out there in need of some Big Bucks Backers.  Instead, we get the 90th Friday the 13th sequel.

Five stars for Imprint.",1240272000,4,308,4.648148148148148

3711727,5,B001N5BDX4,Chris Eyre does it again!  Great film with a wonderful cast!  It's like the 6th Sense with a Native twist.  (Be sure to watch it more than once... you won't believe all the little things you missed the first time!),1236470400,3,214,4.3
3711728,5,B001N5BDX4,I loved this movie. I never saw the ending coming. The actors and actresses in this movie were wonderful. They really got into their characters. Tonantzin Carmelo is a wonderful actress. She always delivers no matter what. I love anything that Michael Spears is in and he did not disappoint in this film.  The ending was sectacular.  I loved every minute in this movie. I can't wait to see what these actors and actresses do next in their careers. Chris Eyre always has a hand in some of the best Native American movies. Thank you for such an astounding movie.,1235433600,5,560,4.59
3711729,4,B001N5BDX4,"Tonantzin Carmelo plays a modern day successful Native American prosecutor. Born and raised on the Pine Ridge rez, once the little girl that saved her change to buy food for the suffering of her tribe, she has moved away from her Lakota beliefs and culture when she moved to the big city. With her white boyfriend and co worker by her side she tries one of the most controversial cases of her career; a teenage Lakota boy accused of murdering a white woman. After the trail Tonantzin journeys home to bid her dying father goodbye. Home is a jar of painful memories and worry for the long lost brother that simply ran off and had not been heard from. In her heart she feels he is dead. Not even a day later she receives the shocking phone call that the Lakota boy she had tried as an adult was shot and killed when he tried to escape prison. Not only would she have to survive the threats from his vengeful family, she would endure a series of terrifying moments from angry spirits; the condemned boy or her brother's agonizing ghost? She will have to face her worst nightmare and the betrayal could prove deadly.
  Sexy Michael Spears plays a tribal officer set on keeping Shayla (Tonantzin Carmelo) safe. I only wish Michael was in the film more.
  Imprint was an edgy thriller without the gore and blood. A good plot with a surprising ending.... A talent cast of Native American actors, finally in a MODERN DAY film. I hope Hollywood makes more.",1234915200,19,1447,4.511450381679389

Ghost story or Murder Story? Touched on some adult themes like: violence, drugs, racial intolerance. These very briefly, only enough to support the story line.  It is a definitely not a horror film but, I'd recommend as PG 13 because their are some rather dramatic supernatural events.",1526256000,,461,5.361111111111111
