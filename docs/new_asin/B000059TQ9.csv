1410502,4,B000059TQ9,"With the current lacklustre season of the X-Files (largely sans Mulder) screening here in Australia, it is good to know we can return to the glory days of the X-Files on DVD. I agree with the previous reviews in that this was the best season of the X-Files, prior to it being all consumed with the ""mythology"" episodes and sheer stupdity at times. On average, season 3 had a good balance between these types of episodes and the one-off 'monster of the week' episodes (which are much more fun if you ask me). By the time this season was playing here in Australia, The X Files had reached the mega-hype level, and deservedly so. It is a shame that the X-Files has almost become a mockery of the great show that this set clearly proves it once was.  It was for sets such as this that I first bought a DVD player - now I can watch my fave episodes as many times as I like. Highlights from this season include: The Blessing Way, Paper Clip, Piper Maru, Apocrypha, Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"", Talitha Cumi.  This DVD set also has the distinct advantage of providing an audio commentary (presumably from Chris Carter), which the previous sets have not done. All in all, Season 3 on DVD looks like a must buy for both fans and those with a passing interest in the series.",982886400,17,1268,4.414529914529915
1410503,5,B000059TQ9,"I have only recently become a fan of the X-Files, having first seen the movie, then the available videotapes (24 in total for 48 episodes), and finally the Series 1 and Series 2 DVD sets.  I have really enjoyed the DVD sets for a number of reasons, the least of which is no commercials!  X-Files productions are generally of very high quality in terms of their photgraphy and look more like a movie than a standard TV show.  This aspect of the series, along with the good use of sound effects and music, really makes the DVDs more valuable than they would be for most TV series.  There are a few bonuses that come with the sets, incliding some interviews with Chris Carter and others involved with the series.  The first two sets contained a nice 20-minute retrospective of the series that they covered -- this one will have one too.  In earlier sets, there were a small number of deleted scenes.
Everyone is going to have their favorite episodes, but I thought that the third series had some of the best I've seen -- My favorites (seen from the tapes and a few reruns) included out of the 24 on this set are the Blessing Way, Paper Clip, Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,  Nisei, Piper Maru, Apocrypha, Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"", Avatar, and Talitha Cumi.  Many these fill out the conspiracy plot, and I am looking forward to watching through the full set.
This is a fairly pricy set of DVDs with 7 disks, but my recommendation if you like the series is to buy it and enjoy each episode at about $4-$5 a pop.  You can always invite your X-Files friends over for a cheap evening at home!",982713600,13,1590,4.455172413793103
1410504,5,B000059TQ9,"This set of 24 episodes from the third year of the X FILES represents what I think is the best overall season to date. Of course, when discussing a television show of the unprecedented high quality of the X FILES, ""best"" certainly is a qualified term. Every season, with the possible exception of the current one ( the  jury is still out ) has maintained a high level of artistry and craftsmanship.  In fact, I believe the X FILES is the single greatest show ever to be aired on television.  In so many areas, whether it be writing, acting or the shear beauty of the production, this show is truly a miracle occurring in medium which, in truth, doesn't often rise above mediocrity. The credit for this phenomenon is shared amongst many dedicated individuals, most working behind the scenes ( Chris Carter obviously deserves special mention, as the creator of the show).
For many seasons Carter maintained the integrity of an artistic vision that the Fox executives were smart enough to take a gamble on. Given the ""franchise"" nature of the X FILES, their gamble certainly paid off. And, if parts of the last 2 seasons have been rough  ( a portent that the show will not necessarily fade gloriously into the sunset ) that does not take away from Carter and company's magnificent achievement.
Although a casual awareness of the X FILES may bring to mind government conspiracy, aliens, ""spooky"" supernatural phenomenon, the core issues in the show are that of truth, faith, love, good and evil; those issues that have captivated mankind's imagination for as long as it has had the capacity to record its artistic, philosophical and revelatory reactions.
Another very strong part of the X FILES' appeal is obviously the complex relationship between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully; one needn't be ""married"" ( pardon the pun ) to the notion that the show revolves COMPLETELY around some sort of nascent romantic relationship; it's sufficient to acknowledge the respect, camaraderie  and genuine love (  whether it's romantic or platonic ) the two share. Mulder and Scully, two deeply serious  ( however witty )  people  help ""ground"" each other in their respective ""quest"" (s).
As good as the actors and production team are, the writers are the bedrock of the X FILES. And, if irony constitutes one of the primary elements in the work of great writers, the core writing staff can at least be described as striving for greatness. The self-reflexive humor constantly on display in the central characters of Mulder and Scully, superbly acted by Duchovny and Anderson, fleshes out the nuances appropriate to the background of these committed and eccentric personalities. Also, the 1013 team delights in a playful, ""embedded""  concepts that recur time and time again in the background of the show. Without going into ridiculous detail ( which others can document better than I can ) there is a certain archetypal X FILES ""iconography"", which has developed more and more with each successive season. A fondness for neon lights or flashing sirens of ambulances and police cars; a humorously morbid fascination with the bathroom as a crime scene ( etc. ). One of the true beauties of the X FILES is that it so ""layered"" that one can appreciate it on any one of a number of levels. This is why it's possible to watch these episodes over and over again and not be bored.
As far as this DVD box is concerned, the 3rd season's consistency episode to episode is magnificent. The ""mythology"" two-parters are tightly written, beautifully produced ( amazing stunts and cinematography ). ""NISEI / 731""  and ""PIPER MARU/APOCRYPHA"" are really ""mini movies"". I'm still flabbergasted that these episodes could actually be prepared for television.
The ""stand alone"" (  or ""monster of the week"" ) episodes are equally well done.  ""OUBLIETTE"" has a tremendously strong performance from David Duchovny and the guest actress; a real heartbreaker, this superior episode strikes me as a precursor to the more acclaimed 4th season ""PAPER HEARTS"".
 The ongoing exploration of Scully's conflicted inner feelings ( manifested in her two ""contesting"" traits, scientific rationalism and religious faith  )are nicely portrayed in ""REVELATIONS"".
""PUSHER"" deserves its reputation as one of the most popular  ""stand alone"" episodes. Its famous villain, Robert Patrick Modell,  has a favored place among the most memorable evil characters from the show ( Eugene Victor Tooms and Donnie Pfaster also come to mind ).
""QUAGMIRE"" fits into a sort of outdoor or ""forest"" X FILES sub-genre ( first seen in Season 1's ""DARKNESS FALLS""  and continuing in Season 5's ""DETOUR"" ).  All these ""forest"" episodes were hellishly difficult to film in Vancouver's rainy woods but the results are yet another of the series' delights; the location shooting is spectacular. In particular, the scene in ""QUAGMIRE"" with the ""stranded"" Mulder and Scully is priceless.
Then there are writer Darin Morgan's three masterpieces, quirky and self-mocking yet at the same time strangely touching. In particular,  ""CLYDE BRUCKMAN'S FINAL REPOSE"" and ""JOSE CHUNG'S `FROM OUTER SPACE' are two of the finest individual episodes in the entire history of the X FILES.
Inevitably, even in such a strong season, there are ""clunkers"".  To a certain degree, ""DPO"" and  ""2 SHY"" fit this category but I consider ""HELL MONEY and especially  ""TESO DOS BICHOS"" as the worst of the 3rd season ( however, these two episodes, judged by the standards of other television programs, would be graded more leniently ).
The season closing cliffhanger,. ""TALITHA CUMI"", displays the type of writing, acting and production strengths exhibited throughout most of the glorious third season. This was from a time when the myth arc was fresh and excitement among fans at a fever pitch waiting through the summer for the next developments.
Fnally, while it is legitimate to argue that Season 4 offered more opportunities for Gillian Anderson to develop the character of Dana Scully, Season 3 still ranks at the top for me.  I'm partial to the variety and freshness of the stand alone episodes and the excitement of the mythology arc was never topped.",982540800,188,6140,5.020669291338582
1410505,5,B000059TQ9,"Others may disagree, but I think this is the best season of the X-Files by far.  Although it lacks the drama of the cancer arc from Season 4, the episodes in this collection consistently feature on my and most fan's lists of the best episodes ever.  Blessing Way/Paper Clip, Piper Maru/ Apocrypha, and Nisei/731 showed how to do a multi-part episode the right way, the three Darin Morgan penned episodes are undeniable classics, and Pusher and Wetwired feature on many fan's fave list (including mine).  By the numbers, Season 3 hit way more times than it missed.",981936000,7,563,4.783505154639175

1410509,5,B000059TQ9,"This Blu-ray version of the original DVD issue is far superior than the DVD. Picture and sound quality are theatre quality. Sound levels are too loud at times, but that's not a problem most of the time. Watch Piper Maru on DVD followed by Piper Maru on Blu-ray. You'll see huge improvements in resolution, shadow detail, and overall color accuracy--especially during the night scenes in Hong Kong.

Most of the episodes are still enjoyable, despite all the conspiracy theories that lead nowhere. The Y2K menace--though never mentioned explicitly--was no doubt fueling the overall sense of dread and suspicion during the otherwise up-beat 90's. The show holds up well now that Y2K is behind us.",1491696000,,693,5.078947368421052

Twilight Zone as a procedural with a dash of spiritual seeking -- that's the best way I can describe it. ""When you come looking for me, youll find me.

The X-Files in 16:9 high definition Blu ray! Been a huge fan since season 1 and i finally get to re live these massive TV moments in awesome detail and quality!

Being a believer of the paranormal and government conspiracies i instantly got turned on to this excellent show!

In most episodes, Mulder and Scully investigate paranormal happenings that defy the laws of nature or the universe. Scully proves to be ever the skeptic she set out to be, never being convinced of Mulder's work.

Should you pick this up if you are a fan? Absolutely. Is it worth it? Positively!

1410957,4,B000059TQ9,"A lot has been said about this release so I just like to leave a short note about the Region Coding of the US Blu-ray release of the third season. The back of the jacket states that this release is Region A.  However, I was able to play the discs on my Region B PS3 and I'd assume that all the other season are also Region Free.

This is great news as the UK/Australia region do not have individual seasons for sale but only a box set that includes seasons one to nine which isn't cheap.  I was able to purchase Season 3 for only $US15 which is great value and if there are no individual seasons released in the near future here in Australia I'll be more than happy to purchase to individual US releases.

I also hope that the aspect ratio for seasons 1-4 being 16x9 (original broadcast was shown in 4x3) won't stop you from purchasing this amazing show on blu-ray; you'll miss a bit from the top and bottom but will gain more on both sides.",1450656000,4,941,4.211111111111111

1410969,2,B000059TQ9,"This is a comment about the blu-rays themselves, not the content, which is excellent.

The X-Files was aired on TV in a day prior to the widescreen TV being a common item in people's homes.  As such, seasons 1-4 were shot in 4:3 and seasons 5-7 were 16:9.  Unfortunately, neither of those aspect ratios were used here.  Instead, the powers that be decided to reformat the series into 1.78:1.  That means we are seeing an image that is zoomed in so the sides fit onto a widescreen display and that means the top and bottom of every shot are cropped off and everything is too close up.

I am VERY disappointed to learn this after having sold my original SD seasons for a blu-ray upgrade.",1449964800,5,685,4.44
1410970,5,B000059TQ9,"Three was the lucky number for ""The X-Files"".

Season one was intriguing with many terrific and strong episodes and season two, likewise, followed suit with an expanded amount of episodes and a series of stirring and powerful episodes (the last episode of season two was simply put--amazing--especially given the burden of a massive amount of episodes ordered) but season three cemented the mythology AND had a variety of tone, unusual episodes that permanently opened up the series to experimentation with the weird, wonderful episodes by Darrin Morgan.

That's not to suggest that Morgan's were the only great episode--EVERYBODY on the writing staff was writing amazing episodes thst both worked in the mythology and as stand alone. The directors, likewise, blew it out with some amazingly creepy episodes that didn't miss a beat. Season three also demonstrated how good and versatile they were at handling the material.

The Blu-Ray looks terrific with a relatively high bit rate, all the special features are ported over but they are all in standard definition (they were shot in SD on videotape). The 5.1 audio mix is very good but remains dialog heavy. It still sounds very good in stereo as well if you choose to listen to it that way. Rescanned at 2K (4K wasn't an option for Fox I suppose although they certainly have made enough money on the series to justify it), the show looks exceptional except for an occasional upscaled SD shot  (I suspect they couldn't find the film for those particular shots and had to resort to upscaled SD from the previous transfers for the DVDs).

The drawbacks, well, there are minor issues. The menu is less than inspired using the opening titles and I dislike the general design but it is clean, neat and simple so there is something to be said about that.

There is an episode guide on the inside of the cover but it doesn't provide a synopsis of the plot. Special features are listed there as well. There are no extras.

Over all, this is a terrific season and porting over the special featurs from the previous edition is a nice touch.",1449792000,4,2081,4.812324929971989

We find episodes like the Lake Creature that almost took a bite of Mulder (first time I have seen Mulder empty his clip into anything), or being re-wired with TV mind control (Mulder almost gets killed by Scully).

And this applies to the series as a whole: It's good fun, as long as you don't take it too seriously.",1448236800,,351,4.5

The plots and production values stand the test of time, although their cell phones and computers bring a smile here and there due to their size -- and antennas.

The characters are well thought out and the variety of genres: mystery, horror, drama, action, and even some comedy! Of course, the underlying conspiracy thread that overshadows all that the X-Files universe is about fuels the endless variety of stories. I'm looking forward the 2016 broadcast!

1411459,5,B000059TQ9,"Season 3 locked The X Files into a position of power.  By that point, Chris Carter's creation had taken on a life of its own.  Scully and Mulder were the team to watch.

During Season 3 several new tidbits of lore were introduced.  There was the ""Black Oil"".  Nobody knew from whence it came.  Nobody knew the power it could yield.  One of the best bits was Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) finding that she had an implant of unknown origin in her body.  This piece of info would weave in and out of various episodes during Season 3.

The X Files had their stride.  Twenty-six episodes kept VCR machines busy during the 1995/1996 Season.  Many of episodes of The X Files during this period are probably some examples of the finest work of the series.  The story had been set, the way had been paved and the actors were fresh, ambitious and exciting.",1421280000,,853,4.467532467532467

1411500,4,B000059TQ9,"If you have never seen The X-Files, a keyword that best describes the content of the X-Files series is ""nightmare.""  FBI agents Mulder and Scully live in a world where the paranormal is gruesomely real and that elements of various governmental agencies are carrying out secret, nefarious activities.

In this season, some of the titles are rather obscure in their meaning - for example: ""War of the Coprophages.""  What is Coprophagy?  It means: the eating of feces.  Does that tell you what it is about?  Hardly.

In the first two seasons, the relationship between Mulder and Scully have been primarily as partners who have become friends, however, in this season, in ""War of the Coprophages,"" Scully becomes clearly jealous when Mulder is working a little too closely with a very sexy scientist named ... Bambi.

Extras:  (1) Deleted Scenes: 5 episodes.  (2) Commentary Track: ""Aprocrypha.""  (3) International Clips (Castilian, German, Japanese, & Italian): 5 episodes.  (4) Cast Credits: Text pages of actors and their character names.  (5) DVD-ROM: Its features are accessible only on computers with a DVD-ROM drive, running Windows 95 or later.

I have been totally ""taken"" by this amazing series.....(something I thought could not ever happen again).

Not since ""Twilight Zone"", ""Star Trek"" and ""Outer Limits"" has ""Suspense, Science Fiction, and/or Scary TV"" have I felt so completely engaged with a television series that ""no matter what episode it is, one is completely absorbed and whisked thoroughly into the story----right from the few minute's worth of lead-in before the titles come up"".....this is First Rate Entertaining, Worthwhile Television. The stories are deeply interesting and totally worth one's time to watch...again, ""something to think about"" comes immediately to mind when I reach for a ""quick"" descriptive comment that captures the heart of this wonderful series.

Totally, Highly, Honestly Recommended for your watching pleasure, whether for the first time or as a repeat watcher....this IS good stuff!

I wear $4.000 dollar hearing aids and even those do not filter out the USELESS interference, which is why I tend to concentrate on older black and white programs offered on Amazon - these mainly lack a background of interference.

I am totally in the tank for Scully--even when her refusal to believe is getting harder and harder for me to believe. Anyway, I'm still finding the series to be holding up beautifully, with just the occasional too-padded shoulder and the odd teenage character cranking up something ""90's alt-rock"" to betray its age. That said, since every locale from a dentist's office to a grocery store to the interior of a lighting showroom is poorly lit and creepy looking, it'd be hard to tell if anything looked its age anyway. Have you ever been in a poorly lit, creepy metropolitan police station? Me neither. I've decided that the X-Files surely exists in an alternate universe, where the two differences between ours and theirs being that aliens, telepathy, vampires, prehistoric flesh-eating bugs etc etc exist, and that every, any and all locales are poorly lit. Other than that, identical. There are a few funny episodes in a row this season which I had totally forgotten about, which was a pleasant break from the horrors of confronting deepest fears and insecurities (and death-dealing satanist teenagers and poultry-plant cannibals with a penchant for beheadings).

There are a couple good episodes in this but it is pretty hit or miss.  I do think you have to do a scan of it to get the clues for stuff later.  It is not obviously a set up season but I think it is.,1401408000,,360,3.6973684210526314

1411577,4,B000059TQ9,"When I watched this series on broadcast TV I enjoyed it, but it wasn't a must-see.  I don't really remember the undercurrent of government conspiracy in the series from my first viewing, so I was surprised how pervasive it is.  I probably just accepted it originally since our government seemed more capable of such things and more powerful back then -- plus the only media outlets that covered aliens, conspiracies, and such were in the sensationalized genre of the National Enquirer et al.

So, what does all of that have to do with the X-Files on Amazon Prime?  Not much.  The X-Files is well written and well acted.  Some episodes are better than others, but all I've seen so far on the first 3 seasons have been very watchable.  I am enjoying watching the X-files again.",1397260800,,775,4.654411764705882

I will say however, not having a play all function in the DVD menu is infuriating.  Maybe I just want to sit down and speed ball the whole dvd instead of picking each individual episode out and having to read a little bio-oc about it before viewing.

1411615,5,B000059TQ9,"There has been so much written by Amazon reviewers and TV critics that to provide my view of
this wonderful season would only echo most of what has been written. Sooo...first the mundane
and then on to the big picture.

The BIG PICTURE:
This season concludes several plot lines started in the Second Season and introduces some more
plot elements. Some of those plots arcs are, an elaborate conspiracy being uncovered when a
fake alien autopsy video is acquired, the search for killer of Skully's sister, and more of the
mystery surrounding X.

The Black Oil is introduced in this season and there are some stand-alone episodes that feature
monsters that do not intersect with the main alien plot arc of all the seasons. Again you have
themes of distrust of government, shadow governments (a reality in the USA), a serial killer that
influence and changes people and (for those who hate cockroaches), there is one about killer
cockroaches.

Then there is the episode, 'The Pusher'. This episode is considered the best of Season Three and
some consider it one, if not THE best episode, of the X-File series. The plot is about a man who
seems to be able to bend people to his will and uses his ability to manipulate Mulder into a
dangerous game. Seems simple and you have probably heard of this kind of plot before. It is an
excellent episode and should meet and exceed your X-File expectations.

To sum up this overview I will quote Eugene Wei who, working for Amazon, wrote an Editorial
Review, ""Series creator Carter realized wisely that fans did not look to the X-Files to explain
the unexplained, but to question that which they thought they understood. The third season was
effective because it hinted that while the truth was out there, it was more complex, sinister, and
amazing than even Mulder had imagined.""

Ditto.

1411644,5,B000059TQ9,"""The X-Files"" was one of the most successful science fiction series in television history and one of the first big hits for the Fox television network, and this DVD set contains the third season of the series in its entirety.  These 24 episodes were originally broadcast from September 1995 to May 1996.

FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate crimes and other happenings that involve the paranormal--Mulder is a believer in paranormal phenomena, while Scully has a medical degree and thinks that all weird happenings can really be explained by science.  However, that area of disagreement does not prevent them from trusting each other and making an effective team as they go all over the country to investigate situations involving murder, the afterlife and reincarnation, UFOs and alien abductions, lightning, psychics, and even killer cockroaches.

The show is very well-shot and has a latter-day Twilight Zonish feel.  The only acting flaw is when Scully on a couple of occasions acts overly surprised at what she sees, but even that comes off as sort of endearing.  Recognizable guest stars in these episodes include Alex Trebek, Jesse Ventura, and Lucy Liu.  Some consider Season Three to be the best of the series, and those who watch these episodes will understand why science fiction fans made ""The X-Files"" a long-running hit.",1378080000,2,1384,5.179372197309417

1411657,4,B000059TQ9,"There are only two strange reasons why I don't believe X Files deserves 5 stars.  I love the actors and the stories they go through.  I'm a big fan of well-done shows like Str Trek, Fringe and the like.  But X Files has two flaws: The scenes are mostly in the dark with flashlights which makes everything difficult to see, and sometimes the plot's holes are *too* big.  Sure, we need to expand our imaginations, at the same time we are accepting that we won't know the answers to every question, but watching this show for the first time, en masse, I see holes that are beyond shrugging our shoulders and just plain frustrating.  Totally committed and continuing to watch.",1372550400,,672,4.566666666666666
1411658,5,B000059TQ9,"This season is the best of the first 3.  I started watching this season on TV at the tail end, & even as a kid I could tell it was a great show.  Here's a review of each episode, with synopsizes from the case.

50.  The Blessing Way:  As a Native American mystic attempts to heal Mulder, Scully pursues secret files on alien experimentation and unwittingly becomes a killer's target.  A+

51.  Paper Clip:  While trying to expose a government plan to create an alien/human hybrid, Mulder gains startling new information about his sister's abduction.  The show's first 3 part story is excellent all the way through.  A+

52.  D.P.O.:  The agents investigate a series of electrical deaths linked to a teenage boy who may be able to control lightning.  A

53.  Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose:  On the trail of a serial killer, the agents seek the help of a clairvoyant who predicts Mulder's death.  Easily one of the greatest episodes of the whole show.  A+

54.  The List:  Mulder and Scully trace a string of prison murders to an executed inmate who has seemingly come back from the dead.  I didn't like the lack of a resolution, but it did keep my interest all the way to the end.  A-

55.  2Shy:  Murders involving overweight women lead Mulder and Scully to the trail of a mutant killer who may be feeding on the fat of his victims.  A

56.  The Walk:  Astral projection becomes a vehicle for murder when the agents encounter an embittered quadriplegic with the ability to project his spirit outside his body.  A

57.  Oubliette:  The abduction of a young girl prompts Mulder and Scully to seek the help of a woman with an unusual psychic connection to the victim.  This episode is rated D for depressing.  I couldn't even finish it, it was so horrible.

58.  Nisei:  While investigating a videotape of an alleged alien autopsy the agents uncover what seems to be tangible proof of the government's contact with extraterrestrials.  Much better.  A

59.  731:  Mulder finds himself trapped on a speeding train with a government assassin, a ticking time bomb and a deadly virus.  Unlike the last 2 part story that didn't span 2 seasons, this is a satisfactory conclusion.  A

60.  Revelations:  Scully questions her own faith in God when she's forced to protect a stigmatic boy who exhibits miraculous Christ-like wounds.  C

61.  War of the Coprophages:  While investigating mass hysteria in a small town, Mulder and Scully discover that killer cockroaches may actually be extraterrestrial robots.  An excellent episode.  Not for those who really hate roaches though.  A+

62.  Syzygy:  The agents must discover what is causing teenage girls to commit brutal murders - a rare planetary alignment or a satanic cult.  This had an excellent build-up, but fizzled at the end.  It wasn't terrible, just anti-climactic.  A-

63.  Grotesque:  Mulder and Scully explore the thin line between sanity and madness when they track a serial killer who claims to be possessed by an evil spirit.  It kept me interested for a bit, but then I was afraid I saw where it was going.  But I was wrong.  A

64.  Piper Maru:  The agents face their old foe, Alex Krycek, while pursuing a radioactive entity unleashed from a sunken WWII wreckage.  An episode that was so good, I had a feeling I was going to love the second part.  A+

65.  Apocrypha:  Scully learns new details about her sister's murder as Mulder pursues the shapeless alien entity inside Krycek's body.  A worthy follow-up to the last episode, with a fitting end for Krycek.  A+

66.  Pusher: A sadistic killer, who possesses the ability to control people with the power of his voice, enlists Mulder in a deadly test of wills.  A+

67.  Teso Dos Bichos.  While investigating a curse on an unearthed artifact, Mulder and Scully battle a shaman spirit that takes feline form.  C+

68.  Hell Money:  The agents discover a dangerous game of chance that is killing Chinese immigrants and securing internal organs for the black market.  I didn't understand the ending, but other than that the episode was great.  A

69.  Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"":  Mulder and Scully probe a government cover-up of a UFO adduction, leading to a bizarre encounter with an offbeat novelist.  I heard this was a funny episode, but while it had some good laughs I didn't think it was as funny (or as scary) as Humbug.  It was, however, one of the most interesting episodes of the whole series.  I know how that guy who didn't know what was real felt.  A+

70. Avatar:  When Skinner is accused of murdering a young woman, Mulder theorizes that the true killer may be a succubus - a jealous female spirit.  The set-up felt a little contrived, but the rest of the episode was really good.  A

71.  Quagmire:  The agents investigate a series of attacks that may be the work of a legendary lake creature named ""Big Blue"".  The first episode I ever saw.  I still love it, except for- well, let's just say that I felt sorry for Scully.  A

72.  Wetwired:  While probing a string of small-town murders, Mulder and Scully uncover a conspiracy involving mind control through television signals.  This was an interesting, creepy episode.  A+

73.  Talitha Cumi:  A supernatural being with miraculous healing powers provides the agents with clues to a mysterious alien conspiracy known only as ""the project.""  Another excellent season finale.  A+

Like I said, best season yet.  I think the fourth one will be my favorite as that was the one full season I watched with my aunt (I was with her when they first aired Home). But we'll see about that later.  For now, I am very satistied with this season.",1372204800,2,5610,4.676318510858325

The X-Files were one of those magic shows that came together at just the right time in just the right way and still defines the genre decades later.  There is no show to date that can touch the creepy/classic feel of X-Files.  If you've never seen the show then you need to start from the beginning.

1411691,5,B000059TQ9,"The x files was a phenomena, and it changed tv and inspired many new series. (fringe is the closest to it) , and of course we got two feature length movies from this too. The series has backstory that is the heart of the first few eps of this season , then we gets lots of the team investigatig many strange events and places. The effects are 90's of course and that's fine. But in spite of that future generations can enjoy the chemistry of lead characters as they discover new amazing things. Even after we make contact and explore space , one could watch this show to get a good view of where we were in the 90's-2002 period in some ways. But the it's the actors and great stories that made this such a huge enduring show. This season continues the great storylines and we do see the aliens , so at we the audience knows they are around. ONe of the more memorable eps is the late peter boyles excellent turn as a psychic who is being stalked by a serial killer. This season is not widescreen and the film used back then was far from hd quality. It's grainy and murky sometimes. But they wanted a dark feel to the show. Even in hd it lurked murky to me. (on bbc america). Still season 3 continued the greatness and freshness.  I enjoyed the show right up to it's end and wish it had gone for a few more. But without david mcoveny it just lost viewers, for it's last two series.  But the mulder character is iconic and here he's in full concept. at this point it's still all shot in b.c. canada too.",1363046400,,1500,4.204861111111111

Not only are they suspenseful, but they help you look at every day situations through different lenses.  While one episode can be filled with drama and the show may appear to attack conspiracy coverups, the next episode may be light and funny, filled with hokey humor.  Great show, but don't expect every episode to connect to the previous as in most of today's shows.  There are still a few ""To be continued"" episodes sprinkled in there and there are still a lot of references to things that happen in previous episodes.  Fun show.",1360800000,,609,4.654205607476635

I like this season. It is one of the top four I would say, and many people will disagree, calling it the best set of episodes the series has to offer. I couldn't argue with that, it just all has to do with personal preference.
Season 3 is actually pretty lighthearted, with some interesting twists and turns intertwined throughout. The mythology episodes in this season, however, are some of my least favorite, dealing with the alien healer Jeremiah Smith, the black oil, and a digital recorder with evidence of an alien conspiracy. This does have an exception, however. ""Nisei"" and ""731"", especially the latter, are two of the most exceptional episodes ever created. It is also a delight to witness Alex Krycek under control of the black cancer, towards the end of the season. Let's just say that when it leaves his body in the abandoned missile silo, chills ran up my spine. Truly haunting!
As far as monster of the week episodes go, I have to say I wasn't a huge fan of this bunch. ""Avatar"" wad particularly annoying for me, adding a convoluted Skinner plotline and just throwing out the paranormal element in the middle of the episode. There are also many comic elements to these MOTW episodes. Jose Chung is possibly the most famous comic X-Files episode. Personally, I like the darker, more frightening episodes the best, but nontheless these are all a delight to watch.
""Quagmire"", while not scary in the least, is a very fun episode because it almost tricks you into thinking that Mulder is wrong just this one time, but then again the truth is never what it seems. Keep an eye out for this one, there is a great balance of chemistry between Mulder and Scully.
The special features are in abundance here, with deleted scenes, behind the scenes, commentary, interviews, and promo spots. It will keep you busy for hours.
Any X-Phile must pick up this set. Hell, I think any fan should own at least seasons 1-6, as they are terrific, all of them. But season 3 is a terrific investment, and some of the best hours of the best sci-fi series of all time.",1219881600,2,2279,4.6575682382134

Whatever one may think of later seasons, there were quite a few highlights here.  Two ambitious two-parters advanced the overall arc in intriguing directions.  Other stand-out episodes include ""DPO"" (this excellent episode about a disaffected teen with the power to control electricity benefits from pre-stardom appearances by Giovanni Ribisi and Jack Black), ""Pusher"" (an assassin with the power to control minds wants to defeat Mulder in a game of cat-and-mouse), ""Grotesque"" (a demon possesses men and turns them into murderers), and ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" (Peter Boyle is clairvoyant in a funny and touching episode).

1411745,5,B000059TQ9,"As far as X-Files seasons were concerned, they were always sort of hit-and-miss. The 2nd season had a number of great episodes but they were usually surrounded by interesting but less than the standards they can set when they really deliver a great hour. The third season, while still having a couple of lulls, are surprisingly really slight and not as much of a detriment. From the mythology to the ""stand-alones"", this is probably one of the most consistent seasons and certainly one of their best.

The Blessing Way: Mulder's supposed death is dwelt on as well as Scully discovering something surprising in this great season premiere. 8/10
Paper Clip: Part 2 finds Mulder and Scully reunited and finding an elaborate project that they might be included in. 8/10
D.P.O: Rather average episode about a guy who can produce lightning-like powers. Saved by guest star Giovanni Ribisi and an actual dramatic performance from Jack Black. 6.5/10
Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose: A series classic as Peter Boyle plays a psychic with the ability to see the deaths of others. 9.5/10
The List: An average episode of a recently executed inmate who swore revenge on those who wronged him. 7/10
2Shy: Another meh episode about a guy who drains heavy women of fatty tissue. 6/10
The Walk: A great idea but somewhat underwhelming execution of a soldier who can astral project and kill others without moving anywhere. 7.5/10
Oubliette: Even if it's far-reaching even for this show, it's an underrated compelling tale of a former kidnap victim somehow psychically linked to another kidnap victim. 8/10

Nisei: Mulder learns of a secret medical project in boxcars while Scully learns more about her abduction. 9/10
731: A more tense episode as Mulder is found trapped in a boxcar with 2 interesting guests while Scully finds survivors of a medical program. 9/10
Revelations: Okay episode of a boy with religious-themed wounds that's hunted by a man believed to be one of the devil's disciples. 7/10
War of the Coprophages: A great episode as Mulder tracks down paranoia set on my cockroach visitations. Scully in cute jealous mode. 9/10
Syzygy: Deaths believed to be Satanic in nature but actually caused by girls with planetary-influenced abilities. Scully in antagonistic jealous mode. 7/10
Grotesque: Great character idea, ok story of Mulder's obsession to track down a killer saying he's possessed by a gargoyle spirit. 7.5/10
Piper Maru: Amazing episode and pivotal mythology one as Mulder discovers divers with severe radiation burns and an ever-changing alien being. 9.5/10
Apocrypha: Less ambitious but just as great conclusion as Mulder hunts Krycek, the digital tape seen in Blessing Way and a salvaged UFO. 9/10

Pusher: Classic villain centering on Robert Modell who can make anyone do what he wants: namely kill themselves. Joins Squeeze and Irresistible as some of the best memorable villain episodes. 9.5/10
Teso Dos Bichos: Rather meh episode of an indian artifact with a curse and a nasty killer from it. 6/10
Blood Money: Another meh episode as the agents track Chinese people who specialize in reluctant organ donors for a chance to win big at the lottery. 6/10
Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"": Hard-to-follow but really kooky as the agents try to solve the abduction of 2 kids and the abductor of their would-be abductors. 9.5/10
Avatar: Skinner is a suspect when he wakes up next to a woman murdered while seeing visions of an old woman. Kinda good and one scene while Skinner's asleep is kinda creepy. 8/10
Quagmire: Pretty standard monster episode except for one scene with the 2 on the rocks makes it a worthwhile episode. Also final appearance of a beloved X-Files character. 8.5/10
Wetwired: A look into subliminal messages and violent behavior which starts to affect Scully. Gillian Anderson is great in this one. 8/10
Talitha Cumi: A good but not stellar finale as a man who healed people shot might come in handy when one of Mulder's loved ones falls ill. 8.5/10

Granted there is episodes like Hell Money, 2Shy and D.P.O which are maybe not as excellent as Coprophages, Pusher or Clyde Bruckman but then again some of the standalones like Oubliette and Quagmire are worth a watch so it's up to you whether to determine if this is a best season but from episode to episode, this is probably is their best.",1186358400,,4315,4.964038727524205

1411747,4,B000059TQ9,"A decent continuation of the series, as the mythology continues to form. While there is plenty of stock fare involving ""little greenish-gray men with oversized heads and eyes"", the real stand-outs in this series are those involving quirky humor, both black and side-splitting. Some of these are:

Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose - A psychic serial killer stalks other psychics and fortune tellers, with reluctant psychic Clyde Bruckman, played to bizarre perfection by Peter Boyle, enlisted by Mulder to assist. Bruckman predicts Mulders means of death many years hence, involving a length of rope, some hand cream and an erotic video. One of the best of all nine seasons.

D.P.O. - Giovanni Ribisi and his ""best bud"" Jack Black are Beavis and Butt-Head types who while away their miserable lives by throwing lightning bolts at folks they don't like.

2Shy - A mysterious scholar feeds vampire like on women he meets through internet chat sites, siphoning off their body fat in order to survive. A (blackly) humorous study of online dating.

Revelations - Mulder and Scully reverse roles, as Scully funds herself drawn into a contest between a young stigmatic and the human personification of the Devil.

War of the Coprophages - Everyone hates cockroaches, and the producers of the show engage in a humorous free for all that will have your skin crawling. And what was that that just crawled across the TV screen? Genuinely funny episode.

Syzygy - Marcie and Terrie have a birthday on the worst of all possible days, from a cosmic perspective. A nod to the classic film, ""Carrie"". A very funny episode, and one of my favorites.",1173052800,4,1627,4.963235294117647
1411748,5,B000059TQ9,"I wanted to point out something technical about the slim set discs that I bought.  If you're looking for insight into the episodes or characters - please look elsewhere.

When I put the first disc of Season One into my DVD player, it started the ""loading"" process and gave me a disc error after about one minute.  Instead of cursing Fox (well, I did it later anyway) I turned the player off, leaving the disc inside.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my DVD player on and Viola!  I heard the X-Files theme and saw the menus (after the obligatory FBI copyright infringement warnings).

For those wondering, the DVD player in question above is a Philips Progressive Scan.  The same problem occurred on a newer Panasonic player.  No glitches materialized when I tried the discs on the Sony or AKAI players.  In all cases, I was eventually able to get to the episodes.  With the first two the screen sometimes showed up scrambled and the menus inaccessible.  On other occasions I was able to access a root menu similar to one you would see if you ""explore"" the DVD contents on a PC (Video_TS files, etc.), though the players would not load any content from these menus.  Speaking of PC viewing, I experienced no problems with any of the discs on my PC and all four programs my PC has to play DVDs functioned perfectly.

PLEASE DON'T READ INTO THIS TOO MUCH.  I don't work for Fox - I'm not trying to encourage sales of the more expensive sets.  This was just a personal experience I had, and it seemed to occur less frequently with Seasons 4 - 9.  My uneducated opinion: the equipment I have isn't top of the line, and maybe wasn't equipped to handle the way the content was compressed.  I was impressed that 4, sometimes 5 episodes were squeezed on one disc.  That's three - almost four hours of content.  I know - dual layer DVDs and blah, blah, blah.  But c'mon - even Lord of the Rings - Return of the King was issued on 2 discs!  (By the way, the content looked and sounded great.)

Another side note: Seasons 1 - 4 that I got were full frame, and 5 - 9 are widescreen.  At first I thought I had missed the option when purchasing these discs, but these are the only way I've found them at retail stores and online.  Nothing major; I just thought I was losing my mind at first.  (Which is still a possibility.)  I can't remember if they aired this way on television - I just noticed that the cinematography got revved up a bit starting with Season 5.  If this observation is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.

Okay.  If you have read this entire review give yourself a pat on the back, a cookie, I dunno - watch some old Doctor Who episodes or something.  A better price, better packaging, and better for you.  (They were giving out a carton of Morley's with the bigger sets, right?)  By the way - the 5 stars is based on my overall X-Files enjoyment.  Sure, there are episodes I can skip through.  But for me, it's good bang for the buck.  Enjoy!",1172361600,10,2967,4.381651376146789

This show blasts right off from the cliff hanger left at the end of Season 2, and finishes off an amazing three parter that is like a book you can't put down.  As with the last season this one builds a lot on the characters including Skinner and Krycek, who gets a 2-parter mainly devoted to his slimey self.  Season 3 also features the final three comedy episodes written by Darin Morgan, who wrote Humbug, the original one.  They're all very tasteful with an oddball sense of humor with ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" being one of the best X-Files episodes in the whole series.

1411752,3,B000059TQ9,"One of the great hallmarks of The X-Files is its cinematographic quality. Unfortunately the DVDs of the slim-set edition of season 3 fail to deliver the visceral punch the show means to deliver, because of one simple reason: poor picture quality. Interior scenes are marked by pervasive grain and intermittent fuzziness. Outdoor shots fare no better. The beautiful urban and natural scenery of British Columbia, where the show was filmed, is dreadfully marred by grain and fuzz. At least the sound is good--clear two-channel Dolby Digital.

But sound alone doesn't cut it. We all know that the crisper the picture, the more quickly and deeply we become absorbed in what we see on our TV screens, forgetting momentarily the real world. Why else are so many people buying high-definition TVs? If you want to own this season's episodes and want a clearer picture as well, then tape the episodes from your cable channel; feel free to use your VCR--you'll still come out ahead in picture quality.",1156291200,6,991,4.969879518072289

1411755,5,B000059TQ9,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements with the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making it 25 episodes in total. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

X-Files: Season two, widely considered the best X-Files season by fans, sent the show flying up the rankings with the season finishing in a cliff-hanger `to be continued' ending with the possibility that Mulder had been blown up by the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis). The first episode of X-Files season three is also another `to be continued' which in the second episode results with Mulder and Scully back as a team with an X-Files mandate directly instigated by Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund), the mysterious Mr X (Steven Williams) are also back. The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville from ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"") is introduced. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) also makes a return. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) appears in a dream sequence and in a special effect. A lot of characters in the previous seasons episodes almost make surprise apperances towards the end. Between Season Two and the start of Season Three there is a whopping three-part X-Files episode. The X-files is firmly reinstated at the FBI. The Cigarette-Smoking Man is having a hard time pleasing his bosses. There is lots of double-crossing. There is more history and revelation about Mulder's dad. However instead of making every other episode conspiracy orientated, Season Three decides to bulk the conspiracy right at the start and middle, with a little at the end for a low-intensity cliff-hanger, but leaves room for lots of sequential individual episodes with some that may actually be better than the conspiracy episodes, which is a change from Season Two that has better conspiracy ones. Season Three is less violent than Season Two and the hard-hitting action has been toned down (Scully doesn't get beaten-up as much this time). Season Three writers go back across the same grounds as Season One covering a broad general range of paranormal topics. Still though there is plenty of room for dealing with the unified underlying causes that the government is trying to protect and there is a greater revelation about a `date' for a threat that faces the Earth. Season Three also boasts a lot of recognizable supporting actors you have seen in the movies. It has also redone the opening theme. Season three of the X-Files is mostly about - Majestic 12, human experiments, lightening, clairvoyance, reincarnation, fat-sucking vampires, phantom limbs, empathy, alien autopsies, stigmata, alien robots, astrology, gargoyles, alien black oil, willpower, shaman, organ theft, eye witness testimony, succubus, lake monsters, mind control and colonization. In Season three the episodes are much more logical, with very few episodes going for general weirdness, with more explanation and hardly any rough edges, with the characters doing more believable things. `Piper Maru' is the most popular show in Season Three because it contains our first images of the mysterious Alien Black Oil that became synonymous with the X-files. However the individual shows `Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose' about psychics, `Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'' about eye-witness testimony are great episodes and very memorable. So are `Quagmire' about lake monsters, `The Walk' about astral projecting serial killers, the `Nisei' about alien autopsies and the `Grotesque' about demons is scary. `Talitha Cumiare', the low-intensity cliff-hanger episode is a interesting conspiracy revelation episode. Although not as gross as Season Two, all of the episodes are highly enjoyable. There are a lot more murder orientated stories so it feels a little bit like the other `Millennium' series that X-Files creator Chris Carter produced. The X-Files: Season Two it is widely considered by fans to be the best season of them all but Season Three can hold its own. There are quite a few `to be continued' double or triple episodes in this season.",1154131200,4,7232,4.986754966887418
1411756,5,B000059TQ9,"I never got the chance to see the X Files when it aired originally. I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes. I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it. Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each. I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later. That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library. Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary. The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical. Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and mobid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project. Either way it's a piece of perfectly executed, mega budget, TV history and it shows in every episode.",1153440000,,1436,4.7023809523809526

I got lucky and purchased the original first season box set for less than $40 right here on Amazon. The packaging for these more expensive sets are downright atrocious. It's one of those fold out thingies that are annoying to unfold completely when you just want to get to one disc. I felt like I was trying to take apart complicated origami everyttime I opened the set. Now with these new sets, the discs come in individual slipcases, minimizing wear and tear on the box itself and making it loads easier to get the specific disc that you want to watch. Also, the bonus stuff wasn't really that in depth and I can do without it.

1411762,5,B000059TQ9,"THE X FILES third season continued the impressive momentum that was kickstarted by the superb first and second seasons of the show. The show turned from an underground hit into a worldwide sensation, sparking conventions dealing specifically with the show. Mulder and Scully continue to remain, as they did throughout the entire series, two of the best characters ever created for television. Their travels continue to broaden, and in this season, they deal with a more expanded palette like the second season introduced to us.

The beginning two parters ""The Blessing Way"" and ""Paper Clip"" start the season off on a mythical note, and actor Floyd ""Red Crow"" Westerman really makes a good impression in the two episodes that link with season two's ""Anasazi"" to make it the best 3-parter in television history. They deal with Mulder's fight for survival and coping with the loss of his father. The two part episode ""Nisei"" and ""731"" are also full of action, and expose an even deeper corruption than Mulder thought was possible. Other stellar episodes include ""War of the Coprophages"", a rather ""buggy"" affair that will induce your fear of cockroaches; ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" which features a stellar performance from Peter Boyle of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND fame; the memorable comedy of ""Jose Chung's From Outer Space"", which is both very funny and twisted; and ""Hell Money"", in which a Chinese band of spirits hunts down Chinese men marked for their arrival. It's one of the best of the season, and the ending will make your eyes pop out of your sockets. And of course, who can forget the fantastic season closer ""Talitha Cumi"", which marks yet another link to the next chapter.

So for a show that so far had two gargantuan seasons under its belt, the third season marks yet another superb chapter in the ongoing X FILES series. And while season three marked a significant turn of events, season four would further expand the show's quest of mystery while continuing to retain the power the show held over its first six seasons. Season Three will charm you, scare you, and make you laugh with its blend of comedy, mystery, and the ultimate ingredient of every episode: unbearable suspense.",1138492800,,2199,4.940540540540541
1411763,5,B000059TQ9,"Thank God! Finally, after for several years having only the option of the very expensive original release of THE X-FILES DVD boxed sets, we have an affordable edition. In fairness, THE X-FILES was one of the first television series to become available on DVD. It was a moderate seller, but did not sell nearly to the same degree that most sets today do. For instance, only a couple of years later BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER began being released in sets priced approximately half and sold quite well. In other words, as a pioneer release there was not yet a sense both of what the demand for television shows on DVD was or what the proper pricing was. I believe there are a very large number of X-FILES fans such as myself who have put off buying the series because of the exorbitant price. This new release fills a major need.

Season Three was, in many ways, the pivotal season in the development of THE X-FILES and arguably the best.  I won't say it is the best, only that if one wanted to argue that it is, I wouldn't take issue with them. Though the show would continue to develop and evolve, there was beginning this season a self-consciousness about the show that hadn't previously existed, a self-consciousness that expressed itself brilliantly in several episodes that are among some of the finest instances of self-parody that has ever been witnessed on television. In engaging in self-parody, the show learned to laugh at itself and not take itself so seriously, while at the same time continuing with some very serious plot lines. I have to confess that the shows that were essentially comic are among my favorites among the stand alone episodes. One can precisely pinpoint the moment that THE X-FILES developed a sense of humor.  In ""War of the Coprophages"" Mulder becomes involved in an investigation in which humans are apparently being killed by cockroaches. One's initial reaction upon seeing this is that it is the most stupid idea in the history of TV, until the realization kicks in that this is supposed to be absurd, that it is all a big joke. After that, it is all laughs, including Mulder working, to Scully's great and unexpected jealousy, with a entomologist improbably named Bambi. Later in the season people become endangered by gangs of killer feral kitty cats, and in a superb parody, we see an X-File investigation through the eyes of folks unfamiliar with Scully and Mulder, and see them hysterically transformed into sinister and threatening Men in Black. There were, of course, plenty of serious episodes as well, such as ""Pusher,"" in which the veteran supporting actor Robert Wisden gets the role of his career as a villain who can compel others to perpetuate all manner of evil deeds by merely talking to them.

My favorite episodes during the course of the series are often the ones that link two or three episodes together, and there are some spectacular such sequences. But I think that during this season the stand alone episodes were sharper than ever. Many of the most famous shows of the series appeared in this season, and only rarely was there a weak episode. We get gradual hints as to the expanse of Cancer Man's responsibilities and to whom he answers. Skinner comes to be a more integral part of the show, and begins siding more openly with Mulder and Scully. Although Seasons One and Two were both fabulous, this surpassed both.

Special mention has to be made of writer Darin Morgan.  Morgan made a small yet astonishing contribution to THE X-FILES as a whole.  Very rarely has any television writer turned out three scripts so spectacular as the three he wrote in Season Three.  ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" not only won Morgan a very well deserved Emmy for writing, but provided the basis for what is easily one of the four or five finest episodes in the history of the series.  Peter Boyle also won an Emmy guest starring in the title role.  ""War of the Coprohages,"" mentioned above, is the first truly comic episode in the series, one that will have you laughing as hard as any comedy.  Finally, he penned the magnificently anarchistic ""Jos Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" in which a wonderfully over-the-top Charles Nelson Reilly plays the writer Jos Chung, doing research for his new book about UFOs.  Morgan also managed two small acting jobs, most memorably as the nondescript man in ""Small Potatoes"" in Season Four who is able to change his physical appearance at will and who nearly seduces Scully after taking on Mulder's visage.

This is also the season where some of the systemic problems that eventually afflicted the show's overall structure started appearing. This is a difficult issue, but perhaps it can best be explained by contrasting THE X-FILES with another show. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER over the course of seven seasons had many stellar seasons, but apart from the internal coherence of each season, they also related marvelously to each other. The writers created a worldview and mythology that created structures around which all of the individual seasons could relate. For instance, we are told repeatedly that only a girl can become the Slayer, and in Season 7 the reason for that is explained. The show would bring forth ideas, and then manage to relate them to all of the other elements of the show. On THE X-FILES, however, a continually increasing number of elements were being introduced in each season, without them being clearly related to any of the other aspects of the show. No doubt some of this was due to the producer wanting to inculcate a sense of a mystery and conspiracy that was so vast and unfathomable that it was impossible to make complete sense of it. But as the show went along, this felt less like paranoia than like they were simply making it up as they went along. Any great show-and by any standard THE X-FILES was a very great show indeed, despite this structural failing-needs when it ends either to have made some sense of all its disparate elements or at least leave the impression that this could have been done had the show gone on a bit longer (e.g., DARK ANGEL ended with many loose ends, but it is clear they could have tied them up). The result of this weakness in the show is that THE X-FILES, unlike BUFFY or FARSCAPE, is best enjoyed in bits and pieces, rather than in huge swathes. BUFFY is like reading a novel, while THE X-FILES is more like a series of short stories with the same characters. Or, BUFFY is to albums what THE X-FILES is to singles. I enjoy watching Season Five or Season Three of BUFFY; I like watching individual episodes of THE X-FILES.

Although the show started before the advent of DVD, it is absolutely perfect for DVD viewing. THE X-FILES is an atmospheric show, and nothing could be worse for breaking the mood than a commercial. There is simply no better way to view these shows than on DVD. And now we can all afford to buy and not merely rent them.",1137628800,6,6895,4.711203319502075
1411764,5,B000059TQ9,"I just completed the first four episodes, and find myself impressed. These may just be the best string of episodes to date.

The two opening episodes tie up some loose ends from season two, yet several questions remain. The main stroyline ends with Skinner and ""the smoking man"" pitted in a game of poker regarding data contained on a tape. We begin to see ""the smoking man"" lose control over his situation.

Episode 3 ""DPO"" could be written off if not for the evilness of the antagonist, who puts a new twist on courting a love interest.

Episode 4, ""Cylde Bruckman's Final Repose"" is haunting and delivers a strong psychological thriller. Bruckman, played by Peter Boyle, is an ironic charecter in that he sells life insurance for a living and has the ""gift"" of seeing how people will die. Bruckman is called in to help solve a case involving a serial murderer, that also happens to have psychic abilities.",1135814400,,908,4.69811320754717
1411765,5,B000059TQ9,"The third season of ""The X-Files"" found Chris Carter and the writers/producers on the show taking chances. The series entered into whimsy and humor with two great episodes written by Darren Morgan (""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" with Charles Nelson Riley we hear all about alien visitation from the most unlikely and uncredible of sources. Alex Trebeck guest stars as, well, one of the Men in Black. ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" about a nice man who can see the future and doesn't want to and his involvement with a serial killer looking for someone who can--which won an Emmy).

There were plenty of the mythology episodes as well and we meet the shape shifting alien Jeremiah Smith who may or may not be out to help humanity. We also discover about Scully's neck implant. It's a stellar season with a strong series of story arcs and stand-alone episodes. Mulder also discovers the alien ""black oil"" that appears to migrate from person to person.

What's different about this set? It's less expensive and it's in the better slimline DVD boxes (the really skinny ones). This set should stand up to wear and tear a bit better than the more expensively produced fold out set. The episodes look the same because the same digital masters were used to produce this set as the other sets. It all comes down to a more affordable set for fans of the series. The disc with all the extras is not part of this set as well and this is basically just the episodes with whatever extras were on the first disc discs of the set (commentary tracks, etc.).

Is it worth it? Absolutely as this is one of the best seasons of the long running series (the show would continue to get better with each successful season and peak around the fifth season). A great show, a great price and in great packaging. What's stopping you from buying it? Oh, by the way Fox plans to release everything from the show through the sixth season (at this writing 12/27/05) through mid 2006.",1135641600,27,1955,4.628242074927954

I thought TV had hit rock bottom a few years ago when countless reality shows dominated the airwaves, but it seems to actually have gotten worse. Personally, I'm down to about one hour of TV per week and I don't miss it at all. Besides, there are so many great books and movies to occupy my leisure time that are far more rewarding and entertaining than anything on television. That's why a program like The X-Files shines for me like the North Star to a lost traveller. The first five seasons blended complex plotlines, impressive production values, intelligent dialogue, genuine suspense, a great sense of humor, and (after the first dozen or so episodes) excellent acting; Gillian Anderson, in particular, is a revelation. After season 5 however, the show began to decline. The movie felt simply like two long episodes put together and, while pretty entertaining, didn't answer any questions. Seasons 6 and 7 I would label as merely decent, with less satisfying storylines, uninspired atmosphere, and (worst of all) bizarre and infuriating alterations in the personalities of Mulder and Scully that didn't work at all. Seasons 8 and 9 were awful in my opinion, and I would advise the newcomer to ignore their existence. So-called completists would argue with me that all nine seasons of the show are worth owning, but it simply isn't true. Next, my review.

Season 3 of The X-Files is my personal favorite. The show seemed to be truly hitting it's stride in this season and everything just ""clicked"". The mythology episodes were awesome and some of the stand-alone episodes were among the best of the entire run. ""War of the Coprophages"", ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"", ""Quagmire"", and (the Emmy-winning) ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" are especially stellar. I could go on spending time describing each episode, but if you're a newbie you're better off just watching them with as little prior knowledge as possible. By the end of this season The X-Files was an unqualified phenomenon, and rightly so.

In conclusion I will say that almost anyone that enjoys intelligent science-fiction will be thrilled with this DVD collection. The extras are somewhat sparse but the show itself is what's really important. If you're not sure if The X-Files is your cup of tea, however, season 3 is a great place to sample. Watching any half-dozen episodes of this season will tell you the answer. I've created fans of this show out of X-Files-virgins before by putting on a few episodes and asking them to watch with an open mind. If you are similarly convinced I envy you, because you have a bevy of brilliant television ahead of you (and you have good taste). Enjoy!",1123113600,,2724,4.893939393939394
1411771,5,B000059TQ9,"Nominated for 12 Golden Globes and 61 Emmys, including 4 for Outstanding Drama Series, The X-Files is one of the world's most popular science-fiction drama shows. Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...

The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...

The X-Files (Season 3) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""The Blessing Way"" in which Mulder remains missing from last season's finale and Scully must track him down with her job on the line and while the cigarette-smoking-man pursues the stolen X-Files. When a group of Navajo Indians discover Mulder's body in a cave, they must summon the forces of the spirit world in order to breathe life back into his empty shell of a body... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Nisei"" in which Scully and Mulder's investigation of a videotaped alien autopsy leads them to the doorstep of a World War II-era series of experiments by Japanese scientists, and ""Pusher"" in which Mulder matches psychic wits with a dying serial killer who harbors a unique power to practice mind control on his victims...

1411772,5,B000059TQ9,"Season three is where the ""glory years"" of the X-Files begins. And they begin here for a good reason. The third season contains such classic episodes like Paper Clip, 731, Quagmire, and some one the most famous X-Files episodes Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose. Although I don't think season three is the best season, it is definentely up there. Warning, spoilers ahead.

Paper Clip: Scully discovers that Mulder is in fact alive, and they go out searching for the men who may have information about the conspiracy.

Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose: a man is killing several other people, and Mulder and Scully think a reluctant physic might be able to help them.

731: Mulder is trapped on a train with what he believes to be an alien human hybrid. Too bad for him there is also an assassin on board, not to mention a bomb.

Piper Maru: Not one of the better mythology episodes, but still good. A mysterious substance has infected several passsengers on a submarine, and Mulder soon discovers that it originated from a WW II bomb.

Pusher: Mulder and Scully track a killer who pushes his victims into killing themselves.

Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"": a novelist tries to discover the truth about what happened to a couple of teens who claimed to have been abducted.

Avatar: when a dead prostitute is discovered in bed with A.D. Skinner, he becomes a suspect in a murder case.

Quagmire: Mulder and Scully try to find what is killing the residents of a quiet town.

Wetwired: TV transmissions are acting upon peoples worse nightmares, causing them to go crazy.

Talitha Cumi: One of the best episodes. Mulder and Scully try to find a man who can miraculously heal people, but soon stumble upon something much more sinister. Return of the ABH.

In the end, season three is a very good season, but like every other X-Files season, it has its share of clunkers [2Shy, Teso Dos Bichos] which is why it is not my favorite season. The standalones are pretty bad. Here's my order for seasons, best to worst.

1411773,5,B000059TQ9,"Series 3 really catapulated the X-files into super show status, and saw the show introduce a new element to some episodes- comedy.

Some of the humour was quite dry- The excellent Clyde Bruckman's Final Reprose , and some bordered on the ridiculous "" Jose Chung's from Outer Space"", the latter was still hugely popluar with fans, and rated as one of the best ever ( I thought it was just OK, but you do need to watch it two or three times to understand it )

The conspiracy episodes deepened, leaving the viewing begging for more. "" Nisei "" and "" 731 "" were high quality television bordering on movie quality.

I found season three to be the weakest of the first five outstanding seasons, simply because for me a few episodes just didn't work- the first since the show started for me.

"" The Walk"" was just average, but "" Teso Dos Bischos"" was a plain stinker, the first, thankfully rare episode to fit that catergory!

But the show continued it's brilliant special effects, great scripts and great casting and interaction between the characters, and worthy still of 5 stars as an excellent series into the paranormal and unusual.

Those viewers unfamiliar with the early seasons, should definitely buy this series if they are not sure that it will be up to the standard of the first two- it is.

The brilliance of a number of episodes, more than makes up for the few bad ones in this season.

Overall, a worthwhile addition to your collection of "" X- Files""

Excellent TV viewing in the comfort of your lounge room!

1411774,5,B000059TQ9,"This is an excellent season for the X-Files.  Here things get more intense than in the first two seasons.  Here you get to see how badly Mulder's enemies want to eliminate him.  It becomes a personal battle when both Mulder and Scully lose their loved ones in their quest to expose the truth.  This season also has some wonderful stand-alone classics: Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose, 2Shy, War of the Coprophages, Grotesque, Pusher, Teso Dos Bichos, Hell Money, and Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"".  They're all highly recommended.  Kudos to the actors, directors, producers, and others behind the making of X-Files Season 3.  Here, they are at the top of their form.",1102377600,4,666,4.945945945945946
1411775,5,B000059TQ9,"Season Three was, in many ways, the pivotal season in the development of THE X-FILES. Though the show would continue to develop and evolve, there was beginning this season a self-consciousness about the show that hadn't previously existed, a self-consciousness that expressed itself brilliantly in several episodes that are among some of the finest instances of self-parody that has ever been witnessed on television. In engaging in self-parody, the show learned to laugh at itself and not take itself so seriously, while at the same time continuing with some very serious plot lines. I have to confess that the shows that were essentially comic are unquestionably my favorite among the stand alone episodes. One can precisely pinpoint the moment that THE X-FILES developed a sense of humor. Mulder becomes involved in an investigation in which humans are apparently being killed by cockroaches. One's initial reaction upon seeing this is that it is the most stupid idea in the history of TV, until the realization kicks in that this is supposed to be absurd, that it is all a big joke. After that, it is all laughs, including Mulder working, to Scully's great and unexpected jealousy, with a entomologist improbably named Bambi. Later in the season people become endangered by gangs of killer feral kitty cats, and in a superb parody, we see an X-File investigation through the eyes of folks unfamiliar with Scully and Mulder, and see them hysterically transformed into sinister and threatening Men in Black.

My favorite episodes during the course of the season are always the ones that link two or three episodes together, and there are some spectacular such sequences. But I think that during this season the stand alone episodes were sharper than ever. Many of the most famous shows of the series appeared in this season, and only rarely was there a weak episode. We get gradual hints as to the expanse of Cancer Man's responsibilities and to whom he answers. Skinner comes to be a more integral part of the show, and begins siding more openly with Mulder and Scully. Although Seasons One and Two were both fabulous, this surpassed both.

This is also the season where some of the systemic problems that eventually afflicted the show's overall structure started appearing. This is a difficult issue, but perhaps it can best be explained by contrasting THE X-FILES with another show. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER over the course of seven seasons had many stellar seasons, but apart from the internal coherence of each season, they also related marvelously to each other. The writers created a worldview and mythology that created structures around which all of the individual seasons could relate. For instance, we are told repeatedly that only a girl can become the Slayer, and in Season 7 the reason for that is explained. The show would bring forth ideas, and then manage to relate them to all of the other elements of the show. On THE X-FILES, however, a continually increasing number of elements were being introduced in each season, without them being clearly related to any of the other aspects of the show. No doubt some of this was due to the producer wanting to inculcate a sense of a mystery and conspiracy that was so vast and unfathomable that it was impossible to make complete sense of it. But as the show went along, this felt less like paranoia than like they were simply making it up as they went along. Any great show-and by any standard THE X-FILES was a very great show indeed, despite this structural failing-needs when it ends either to have made some sense of all its disparate elements or at least leave the impression that this could have been done had the show gone on a bit longer (e.g., DARK ANGEL ended with many loose ends, but it is clear they could have tied them up). The result of this weakness in the show is that THE X-FILES, unlike BUFFY or FARSCAPE, is best enjoyed in bits and pieces, rather than in huge swathes. BUFFY is like reading a novel, while THE X-FILES is more like a series of short stories with the same characters.  Or, BUFFY is to albums what THE X-FILES is to singles.  I enjoy watching Season Five or Season Three of BUFFY; I like watching individual episodes of THE X-FILES.",1099958400,5,4231,4.8076923076923075
1411776,5,B000059TQ9,"This season was when the X-Files was still on on Fridays, and people (like me) would have watching parties. ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" was like a lightning bolt when it aired. I recall trying to tell a late-arriving friend about the opening to that episode, he was like, ""What??""

This is a DVD set must have for those times when you're ill, stuck in a strange house, or it's late at night and want to chill (or for a low-key date). The X-Files was a great show, really ""1990s,"" and you should totally pick up a few of these DVDs.",1099526400,4,537,4.316831683168317
1411777,5,B000059TQ9,"Another great season.  The episode titled, ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" on Disc 5 is one of my favorite X-Files episodes ever!  The 'From Outer Space' episode is extremely funny, witty, cheesy, and original; makes the whole season even better.",1098057600,,248,5.175
1411778,5,B000059TQ9,"Of all nine seasons of THE X-FILES, I would not call Season 3 my personal favorite---I'll always have a soft spot for Season 2, being the season during which I discovered the show. Still, it must be said that of this season's 24 episodes, not one of them is a flat-out dud, making it arguably the most consistent season of the nine (and especially more consistent than the first two seasons).

If the first two seasons' mythology episodes mostly set the groundwork, establishing and defining key players and throwing out shadowy hints of a vast government conspiracy at work, the  two-part epics of Season 3 expanded the breadth of the mythology and started providing some possible answers. ""Nisei""/""731"" is the most revelatory in this regard: perhaps Mulder isn't really chasing after aliens at all, but simply disfigured human guinea pigs for horrible government tests of some sort. Then there is ""Piper Maru""/""Apocrypha"", which introduces the malevolent black oil into the mix, some kind of alien being that transports itself via diesel oil and jumps from host to host, HIDDEN-style. I dunno; it was always kind of a silly idea to begin with, but at least the episodes are reasonably suspenseful, and it certainly gives the special-effects crew a chance to pull off some marvelous visual effects (particularly the ""misty-eyed"" effects).

Any review would be remiss if it didn't mention the three contributions of writer Darin Morgan, who puts his wonderful sense of the absurd---so effective in Season 2's ""Humbug""---to good use in ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,"" ""War of the Coprophages,"" and ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"". Of the three, ""Clyde Bruckman"" is the best of them, with a touching Emmy-winning performance by Peter Boyle as the reluctant psychic who would rather die than live with his ""curse."" If the later two episodes become a little too self-consciously wacky, ""Clyde Bruckman"" manages to skillfully balance both humor and pathos. It is, I daresay, perhaps the best episode of the season. ""'From Outer Space'"" also has its funny moments too, being a paranormal-comic reworking of the basic idea of RASHOMON. Once you get onto Morgan's far-out wavelength, it becomes a silly slice of lighthearted comic heaven.

As for the remaining standalone episodes: all of them range from suitably spooky to genuinely haunting; there are no dull episodes like Season 1's ""Lazarus"" here. My personal favorite is ""Grotesque,"" in which Mulder goes to the edge of madness in trying to catch a supernatural killer. It is a powerful study of how even detectives can go a little mad sometimes even while trying to keep their cool when dealing with the worst of mankind. Other notable standalone thrillers include ""2Shy,"" ""Oubliette,"" ""Revelations,"" ""Pusher,"" ""Hell Money,"" and ""Quagmire."" But really, there is not a dud in the bunch, and the best of them deal personally with the characters of Mulder and Scully one way or another. (I would also feel remiss if I didn't put in a defense of the much-maligned ""Syzygy"": it might not be pleasant to watch our two heroes act so mean to each other, but it is logically consistent with the supernatural astral phenomena writer Chris Carter explores; and on a whole it must be said that, on its own twisted terms, ""Syzygy"" is highly effective, and certainly never boring. There's nothing technically the matter with it, even if you might not like the concept of M & S at disgusted odds with each other.)

Mulder and Scully's tenuous relationship is certainly put to the test time and time again throughout the season. In some episodes the tension between them is palpable; but I'd rather see a little bit of tension instead of allowing the relationship to fall into amiable predictability. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson still manage to work well together (although the freshness of their initial encounters has long subsided), and quite a few of the episodes really allow them to explore their characters more in-depth, giving the actors plenty to work with. Anderson always amazes with her commitment and skill, while Duchovny remains the smooth underplayer, who still has a witty way with a cheesy one-liner.

All in all, Season 3 is yet another accomplished season in the early years of THE X-FILES, more consistent than the previous two, more prone to go to the depths with their characters (although Season 4 goes a lot deeper). The mythology episodes still retain its down-to-earth freshness, and the standalone episodes are no less impressive for its character depths as much as for its freaky intrigue. In short, it's sci-fi television at its best. Highly recommended.",1092960000,5,4629,5.044444444444444
1411779,5,B000059TQ9,"If this isn't the best season of X files, it must be at least equal. they didn't step a foot wrong here, the pacing of the one shot stories mixing with the on going story arc (which is fully flowing by this season)is amazing.

1411780,5,B000059TQ9,"Up until recently, I never watched a single episode of the X-Files. However, now that the DVD sets have been reduced in price, I had the opportunity to start watching the show. The first two seasons of the X-Files made me become an instant fan of the show, and my only complaint so far has been the lack of consistancy brought on by the 6-8 boring episodes per season. After watching the third season of X-Files, I can finally say that there was a season that deserves a 5 star rating by being great from start to finish. By the end of the third season, the X-Files really becomes established as one of the best and most addictive sci-fi shows ever created.
The third season only featured two bad episodes, which means that 22 out of 24 episodes were fantastic. The third season offers some of the best stand alone episodes of the show like ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Response"", ""Pusher"", ""Quagmire"",  ""War of the Coprophages"", ""2Shy"", ""Hellmoney"", and ""Wetwired"". The mythology episodes - ""The Blessing Way"", ""Paper Clip"", ""Nisei"", ""731"", ""Piper Maru"", ""Apocrypha"", and ""Talitha Cumi"" do a very good job on expanding the overall conspiracy of the show by introducing a powerful group of men called ""The Syndicate"" which are connected to the conspiracy and the Cigarette Smoking Man. There is also a few things that are revealed about Mulder's source ""Mr. X"" as well.
The third season of X-Files on DVD also continues the tradition of offering a fantastic set filled with wonderful extras and wonderful picture/sound quality. As with the previous two sets, series creator Chris Carter takes you through the best 12 episodes from season three and talks about each episode. There is also a great documentary that covers season 3 as a whole. If there was one season of the X-Files that you should buy, it is definately the third season. The season is amazing from start to finish, and the DVD extras are great.
A solid 5 stars...",1086739200,,1923,4.75748502994012
1411781,5,B000059TQ9,"You ask any X-files die-hard fan about which is the best season of the series and they will readily answer either the third or the fourth. This is no coincidence, and i would totally agree with them.
  In this third season all the elements of the series come of age: the two main protagonists are at the top of their game giving very high quality performances and cementing the legendary characters of Mulder and Scully. While in the first 2 seasons these two characters were essentially still being constructed and the relationship between them two still being built up, in the 3rd installment this has all fallen into place making it a very solid, very well put together dram-plot, equal of which you'd have to search hard to find in TV history.
  But even better than that, the script-writting hits masterpiece levels, not in a few episodes, but rather all and throughout. In fact, as far as season 3 is concerned, any ""weak"" episode would still be considered top-level stuff for any other TV series. But the overall level of the storylines introduced here is so high that your expectations rise as you move along from episode to episode. This is basically a season that made anyone that watched it at the very least more suspicious (do a simple search on google on some of the storylines and you'll understand what i mean) or simply a more intelligent viewer and thinker alltogether.
  Another important factor introduced in Season 3 is that certain plotlines were here to stay, that is, they were stories to be extended and interweaved in following seasons as well, stories that were among the very best the X-files have offered us.
  Big time fans of the series (and man, there are many) cherish this season for mega-classic episodes such as :
""Paperclip"",
""Nisei"",
""731"",
""War of the Coprophages"",
""Grotesque"",
""Apocrypha"",
""Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space""
""Wetwired"" and
""Talitha Cumi""....
But watch anything at random from the 6 DVDs with episodes and the chances are very high you'll be in for a major cerebral treat.
  The success of this tremendous series is not only on the artistic achievements but even more so on the fact that most of the dramaturgy involved in the X-files is tied with multiple leads to realities most people are absolutely unaware of, in certain cases even X-Files fans themselves. This is a feat only achieved to a similar degree in that other TV classic from the 60s, the Twilight Zone.
  If you're not very familiar with the series i wouldn't reccommend you to start at Season 3, mainly because you simply need to watch the characters develop from the very beginning, at Season 1. What i am saying though, and that with emphasis, is that having watched all of the seasons involving Mulder and Scully, Season 3 and Season 4 are beyond any doubt stunning.",1083456000,2,2791,4.767634854771784
1411782,5,B000059TQ9,"Once again, the creative team behind the X-Files brings us another season. And it topped the first two combined! The Alien mythos was even more in the forefront, with the ""The Blessing Way and Paper Clip"" concluding the last season's cliffhanger finale. It was clear that the mythology was going where no one had expected - and that was a good thing. This was the most exciting aspect of the show. We were always given something new, and yet still kept guessing. It really made you want to keep watching the show to find out what happens next - even so much as sitting through a bunch of stand-alone episodes(great in and of themselves) to get to the next mythology episode. I think that this is the show's greatest strength. It wasn't all mythology, so that made it so that when we did get a mythology episode, we were excited!
Also, this season introduced the black oil plot, and the alien-human hybrid plot. We also got more into the plot of the shape-shifting aliens and their abilities.
Yet another brilliant season. And as always, we get ""The Truth about Season [fill in the blank with the corresponding season]"" documentary, as well as other great special features that are worth watching for any X-Fan.

1411784,5,B000059TQ9,"Season two had ended with such a cliffhanger episode that my anticipation was very high for this next season.  Fox Mulder (David Duchovney) was assumed dead when the train car he was in (filled with alien bodies) was bombed and exploded.  The season opens with the discovery of Mulder's body and he is barely clinging to life.  As he is nursed back to life, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) has to deal with the suspicions surrounding the absence of her partner, and the murder of her sister (Scully was the target).  The first several episodes of this season deal with the mythology of the show, and the conspiracies that abound.  We get deeper glances into what may really be going on, and who is respsonsible.  When things get a little bit settled (with just as few answers as you might expect), we get more of the ""monster of the week"" episodes that this program does so well.  Season 3 mixes in some of the alien/conspiracy storylines in with the MOTW episodes and just when I thought the season was not building to anything, the season finale throws me for a complete loop (in a different way than the ending of season 2 did) and I'm now looking forward to Season 4 and seeing how this storyline progresses.
Overall, this was a very strong season with several absolutely excellent episodes.  My interest lies in the alien/mythology storyline, and this season touched upon that several times.  I wish that I would have watched this show back when it was on television because after watching three seasons, this is one of my favorite programs.  You really can't go wrong watching the X-Files, but as a suggestion to new viewers, start at the beginning, some things will make more sense in the mythology storylines.  Highly recommended,  but any person who is going to watch season three probably already loves the first two.",1067212800,,1826,4.725552050473186
1411785,5,B000059TQ9,"By it's third season, it was clear The X-Files wasn't what everyone had expected from the time it had premiered.  Now, creator Chris Carter begins to bring the long running alien conspiracy story arc to the forefront; and this season is nothing short of brilliant, and is possibly the best season in the show's history (and that is saying something).  David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are perfect as ever as FBI Agents Mulder and Scully respectively; and this season contains some of the series' most memorable episodes.  It was also in Season 3 that the series' style of subdued satirical comedy began to shine, but it is the mythology of the series that made this season go excellent.  Standout episodes (and there are aplenty) include the season opener The Blessing Way, Paper Clip, Oubliette, Nisei, 731, War of the Coprophages, Grotesque, Pusher, Avatar, and Quagmire; but the main season (and series) highlights include Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose (which features a standout performance from Peter Boyle) and Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"" which features a great commentary track from fan favorite series vets Darin Morgan and Rob Bowman (both of whom helped craft the brilliance of the show).  All in all, this is possibly the best season of The X-Files, and if this handsome package came in widescreen format this would be essential.",1062720000,9,1347,5.04954954954955
1411786,4,B000059TQ9,"Man I love this show.  Always interesting on a cerebral level and yet each episode is easy to enjoy on a purely fun and entertaining level.  The DVD quality is fabulous, even on my laptop, and the sound is magnificient.  I never realized before I got this set(my first set of DVD's for this show) just how incredible the production values really were.  The cinematography, especially in these early years, is something to marvel at.
My one issue with these and my S4 DVD's, and any other X-Files set I'm sure to get, is the major lack of episode commentary.  I loved the Darin Morgan/Rob Bowman commentary on ""Jose Chung's..."" because they seemed to truly enjoy talking about the work and gave some insightful looks into the making of the episode and the show.  But ""Apocrypha"" is the only other full episode with commentary, and Chris Carter does commentary on a bunch of DELETED scenes.  S4 DVD's have just one episode with commentary.  What's going on here?  Is everyone just too busy?  That's what makes me gripe with the price of these DVD's while a show like ""BUFFY"" goes for significantly less but evidently has much more to offer in terms of special features.  But that's just one gripe.
All and all, having the episodes is more than enough for me.  I LOVE this show and I'd pay anything to have it.  Nobody will be disappointed by getting these.  It's more than worth it!  In it's prime, which is what these early seasons represent, THE X-FILES was one of the top 2 or 3 shows on television.  It's enjoyable on so many levels, easy to admire everything from the outstanding acting to the marvelous writing to the sharp directing and, of course, the sensational cinematography!  I LOVE THIS SHOW!  AND YOU WILL TOO!",1047600000,4,1723,4.63036303630363

Mulder's return from the dead leads him and Scully to an abandoned mine that raises even more questions. In this season the Syndicate makes it's first appearance to which Scully looses a family member, and Mulder learns more of his father's involvement in the conspiracy. Krycek turns up in the least likely of places, and the mysterious Black Oil makes it's first appearance as well. In the season finale, Mulder's mother is visited by the Cigarette-Smoking Man, which turns out to be nearly fatal. Mulder discovers a deadly weapon which my have ties to a man that can miraculously heal people, has the answers to all of Mulder's questions... and is being stalked by the Alien Bounty Hunter.

1411788,5,B000059TQ9,"Season Three of The X-Files has got to be one of the best seasons of any TV show in history. The plot lines are amazing, the sets are eye-popping and the acting abilities of FBI Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are excellent. Show creator Chris Carter didn't just have a semi-popular show with a few sci-fi fanatics here, he had a worldwide phenomenon in which almost everyone watched - you weren't cool if you didn't watch The X-Files! Suddenly, being a geek was cool! Season Three of The X-Files was nominated for 8 Emmy Awards and won 5 - so they actually do take note of sci-fi/fantasy shows? Must be just Buffy that they have a grudge against then...

The mythology arc of The X-Files is ever expanding as the show progresses, and Season Three has a lot of them! After held in suspense at the end of Season Two with Anasazi, we are treated to a superb season opener with ""The Blessing Way/Paper Clip."" In the former, Scully pursues secret files on alien experimentation and unwittingly becomes a killer's target as a Native American mystic attempts to heal Mulder after his accident last season. In the latter, while trying to expose a government plan to create an alien/human hybrid, Mulder gains startling new information about his sister's abduction - and Scully's. The scene where Mulder and Scully are in the abandoned building looking through files, spotting what seem to be aliens and a spacecraft are some of the most infamous scenes in the show's history. This trio of episodes was also recently voted the greatest X-Files moment in the history of the show in an Internet poll. Another superb two-parter is ""Nisei/731."" In ""Nisei,"" the agents uncover what seems to be tangible proof of the government's contact with extra-terrestrials when they investigate a videotape of an alleged alien autopsy. In ""731,"" Mulder finds himself trapped on a speeding train with a government assassin, a ticking time-bomb and a deadly virus. Scully also makes a shocking and emotional discovery.

The next two-parter of Season 3 is ""Piper Maru/Apocrypha."" In the former, Mulder and Scully face their old foe - Alex Krycek - while pursuing a radioactive entity unleashed from a sunken WWII wreck. In the latter, Scully learns new details about her sister's murder as Mulder pursues the shapeless alien entity inside Krycek's body. The Season Three finale, ""Talitha Cumi,"" is a brilliant episode, but not quite up to the standard of either Season Two or Four's finales. In the Season Three finale, a supernatural being with miraculous healing powers provides the agents with clues to a mysterious alien conspiracy known only as ""The Project."" The episode does leave you on the edge of your seat, however, as that spooky alien bounty hunter approaches the agents!

The stand-alone episodes of Season Three are perhaps the best of the entire show. They include ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,"" ""The List,"" ""The Walk,"" ""Pusher,"" ""Teso Dos Bichos,"" ""Hell Money,"" ""Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"" "" (check out Mulder's girly yelp when he discovers an alien!), ""Avatar"" and ""Quagmire."" In ""D.P.O."" the agents investigate a series of electrical deaths linked to a teenage boy who may be able to control lightening. ""2 Shy"" is just a downright scary episode in which bizarre murders involving overweight women lead Mulder and Scully on the trail of a mutant killer who feeds off the fat cells of his victims.

""Grotesque"" has to be a show highlight in which Mulder becomes obsessed with a case about a man who uses sculpture through gargoyles to kill young men. The colours in this episode are so dark and bleak, resulting an absolutely beautiful, classic episode. The two episodes ""War Of The Coprophages"" and ""Syzygy"" are absolutely hilarious. The former sees Mulder and Scully discovering that killer cockroaches may actually be extra-terrestrial robots while investigating mass hysteria in a small town. The episode is so over the top that it makes fun of itself in a brilliant way never seen before or since in The X-Files. In the latter, the agents must discover what is causing two teenage girls to commit brutal murders - a rare planetary alignment or a Satanic cult. It could be either, but it's definitely the former when Mulder and Scully start to fall out and act strangely. The scene with Scully trying to look all serious smoking a cigarette is just madness! She'd never touch a cigarette in her life! ""Wet Wired"" is another outstanding episode in which Mulder and Scully uncover a conspiracy involving mind control through television signals while probing a string of small-town murders.

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

A fan of The X-Files cannot begin to explain just how stunning and amazing Season Three of this worldwide phenomenon really is! After Season Three, the show just continues to get better and better with Seasons Four and Five, before taking a gradual downfall with Seasons Six and Seven. However, if you want to relive some of the best episodes of the one best seasons of one of the greatest TV shows in history, buy Season Three of The X-Files on DVD.",1042848000,,5100,4.9175377468060395
1411789,5,B000059TQ9,"As stated above, the series is truly in its prime in season three.  Chris Carter now knows he has an international hit on his hands that will go for quite some time.  I don't know that he knew whether or not they'd get nine seasons out of it or not, but he knew by now that it was here to stay.  With the season two season finale, ""Anasazi"" and the furtherance of the X-Files mythology, we went through a long summer waiting on the Season three opener, ""The Blessing Way.""  Two of The X-Files best shows out of its entire nine year run.  What was truly maddening was the long summer wait, the season opener and then to top it off, ""The Blessing Way"" ends with a huge To Be Continued and another weeks wait for ""Paper Clip"" and the conclusion of this trilogy of The X-Files finest.
Season three is jam packed with excellent episodes, the only difference between the superb episodes and the excellent episodes is whether or not they dealt with the mythology aspect.  The mythology episodes of this season served well in carrying the on going story along, those episodes being:  ""The Blessing Way;"" ""Paper Clip;"" ""Nisei;"" ""731;"" ""Piper Maru"" which is named after Gillian Anderson's daughter and serves as introduction to the ""Black Oil"" aliens; ""Apocrypha;"" ""Wetwired;"" which is part mythology, and finally the season finale ""Talitha Cumi.""  All of these episodes leave you floored by their brilliance and desperate for more.
The non mythology episodes are true masterpieces in and of themselves.  ""D.P.O,"" is about a young man who is struck by lightning, lives and is able to use lightning at his will.  ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,"" is a truly wonderful episode, highlighting the writers and producers talents to produce comedic and yet serious episodes.  This also includes a wonderful performance by Peter Boyle.  ""The List,"" a man on death row is treated quite poorly while there and comes up with a way to come back after his execution and kill those who treated him poorly.  ""2Shy,"" is just a downright scary episode about a man who kills large women to consume their fat cells.
""The Walk,"" is an excellent episode about a Gulf War vet who has lost all of his limbs and decides to take revenge upon those he felt were at fault.  This is the one episode where I do have a minor complaint.  As a soldier in the US Army, one does notice how poor the producer's research was in providing uniforms for those who were supposed to be in the Army.  The female captain was wearing ""Infantry"" crossed rifles signifying her branch as infantry, this is impossible.  The dress shirts for all of the officers were blue, wrong again, not in the Army.
""Oubliette,"" is a great episode about a young girl who is kidnapped and at the same time an earlier victim of that same kidnapper is experiencing, physically and mentally, everything the young girl is.  This is an extremely emotional and well written episode, superbly performed by David Duchovny.  ""Revelations,"" is about a young boy who experiences ""crucifix"" type wounds and a possessed businessman trying to track him down and kill him.  ""War of the Coprophages,"" is a strange episode where we, one get to meet a very beautiful Bambi, and two see some serious jealousy and friction between Mulder and Scully.  There also some great acting by the cockroaches in this one, LOL.  ""Syzygy,"" is a great episode where the planets and stars line up perfectly and bring out pure evil in two young women.  ""Grotesque,"" is an extremely well written and performed episode about a demon who possesses its victim and then uses that victim to kill young men.  ""Pusher,"" is an amazing episode about a dying man's ability to control other people's thoughts.  ""Teso Dos Bichos,"" is about the bones of South American female shaman being brought to the states and a series of bizarre murders occurring, which culminates in an unexpected ending.  ""Hell Money,"" is a great episode that in one way is not a true X-File and could be something that is ripped right out of reality.  ""Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"" is just a great episode that takes a lighter look at the X-Files, truly one of the best non mythology episodes of the entire nine year run.  ""Avatar,"" is a scary episode that will initially have you wondering if AD Skinner's future on the show is in jeopardy.  This one also has Jennifer Hetrick, Star Trek The Next Generations ""Vash"" playing AD Skinners wife.  ""Quagmire"" is one of the serious, yet funny shows that also portrayed the demise of Scully's dog.
Of course the seventh disk has several special features that are a must see.

1411790,5,B000059TQ9,"This is the best season of the X-Files!!! Pros: Jose Chung's ""From Outer Space"" (Darin Morgan written episode. Many very odd characters in this episode concerning a possible abduction of a teenage couple. So many funny lines.  Alex Trebek as one of the Men in Black.), Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose (Another Darin Morgan episode.  Peter Boyle's character can see how you are going to die (autoerotic aphyxiation (?)).  M & S enlist him to catch a serial killer of psychics.  Very sad & funny.), Oubliette (Guy kidnaps young girl.  M gets the killer's former victim to help.), War of the Coprophages (Morgan episode #3.  Killer cockroaches episode.  M hits on S (""Scully, what are you wearing?"") and Dr. Bambi (""I find bugs...very interesting"").  S gets very jealous (""She?""...""Her name is Bambi?""), Grotesque (M's former superior from VCU enlists his help to catch a serial killer who has a fascination with gargoyle drawings/sculptures.  AngstyMulder.), Pusher (Serial killer can push his victims to do things by mind control.  Great M & S interaction.  Angsty M & S.), Revelations (Good vs. Evil.  S's faith is tested.  M is the skeptic.  Eerie ending.), Syzygy (Strange astrological happenings.  M & S act weird.  M is looking for the horny beast and S is smoking.  JealousScully.  M & S are PO'd at each other.), Quagmire (M is looking for a swamp thing.  Funny lines.  Queequeg gets killed.  S's insight into M on the rock.), and Wetwired (Mind control via television.  AngstyScully tries to shoot M when she thinks he has stabbed her in the back.).  Cons: Teso Dos Bichos (Killer kittens!!!  Bad effects.).  I love this season.  Probably the last season when I really liked Scully throughout.  Very highly recommended season.  I believe that at least two episodes were nominated/won an Emmy (Darin Morgan episodes).",1034380800,2,1821,5.0
1411791,5,B000059TQ9,"Do you remember what the X-Files were like before the plots started to recycle?  Before 'X-Files:  Fight the Future' ('Fight the Fatigue' is more like it)?  Before Mulder left, then came back, then left again?  Before Agent John Doggett?  Well, here it is.
Season Three is, in my humble opinion, the second best season the X-Files had.  Deep Throat, killed off (prematurely, I think) in Season One makes a token appearance.  X is still alive.  Scully doesn't have cancer yet she gets it in Season Four and it goes away in Season Five).  The plots are fresh and interesting.  The mythology hasn't become so complex and impenetrable.
The epiodes alone are worth the price of the DVD.  But that's not all Chris Carter gives us.  The interviews and segments with production staff and Chris Carter himself, all apparently gathered from the FX channel, are excellent.  The Third Season is better than the first two DVDs technically - it seems like the menu is faster and easier to manage.  And when there are no ""special"" options like deleted scenes (I LOVE those), little bonuses are thrown in like a list of actors/actresses in each show.  Oh, and the alternate language clips are a riot.  It's a blast to see Scully talking to Mulder in Japanese, or Mulder expounding something to Skinner in German.
Get the First two seasons first, of course.  But the watch the Third Season and remember why you liked X-Files in the first place.",1029110400,2,1427,4.735772357723577
1411792,5,B000059TQ9,This is on of the most elequent season that TV has ever put out.  the great part of the X-files is its completeness.  It has fantastic:writing acting directing and score.  What else could you ask for.  i think that the show stepped into its own half way through season two and then moved at full pace in season three.  It is up there with the first season of Roswell or any of the Babylon 5 seasons(Well maybe not quite that good) but anyway it is truley something remarkable.  It is unique clever and entertaining.  Check it out.,1024617600,,530,4.402061855670103
1411793,5,B000059TQ9,"Season three of The X-Files carried the mythology introduced in season two into different directions while still maintaining the classic X-Files formula. The episodes kept getting bigger, with such Emmy Award powerhouses as ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" and the great ""Jose Chung's From Outer Space."" Elaborating on the drama, the beginning of the season deals with some dark plot points, including the death of Melissa and the rise of the Syndicate. What really shines this season is the relationship brewing between Mulder and Scully. Seeing how bad things can get for them and dealing with the loss of loved ones, they form a bond like never before and finally come together as one. Everything about this season is good. The mythology was still fresh and exciting, and the drama and humor were all on stride. Highlights include ""The Blessing Way"", ""Paper Clip"", ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"", ""Nisei"", ""731"", ""War of the Coprophages"", ""Piper Maru"", ""Apocrypha"", ""Pusher"", ""Jose Chung's From Outer Space"", and ""Talitha Cumi.""

1411795,5,B000059TQ9,"This season takes the mythology and makes it as large as you can not imagine (or at least that was the case when I saw it for the first time). For the first time the project is seen as the enormous plan that it is: the medical records stored in a mine (Paperclip 3x02), the post-world war II scientifics from Japan involved in the experiments (Nisei/731), the black oil's appearence in a world war II submarine which was ordered to go to its specific location (Piper Maru/Apocripha), and finally the begining of the colonization (Talitha Cumi). Besides, the emotional arc of the characters grows just as much: Melisa's death, Mulder's way to resurrection, Scully's implant (The Blessing Way 3x01). The standalones are really great with only three or four exceptions. This is the season of the very best comedic episodes: Clyde Bruckman's final repose is just a classic of TV (winner for best writing in the EMMY awards -they almost died for actually giving an award to a sci-fi series), Jos Chung's ""from outer space"" is one of the most complex things I have ever seen in my life, War of coprophages manages to make everyone just eat [refuse] and laugh, and Syzygy. Mythologic standalones are unbeatable: Avatar focuses not only on Skinner's intimate life, but on his alliances with both Mulder and Scully, and the syndicate; Wetwired reveals a great work with images and also is the begining of the end for Mr. X.
My top 10 for this season goes like this:
10. Pusher (an excelent episode written by Vince Gilligan)
9. Avatar
8. wetwired
7. Nisei / 731
6. The Blessing Way/ Paperclip
5. 2Shy (in Scully's words: a fat sucking vampire... I just loved this episode, it's simple, but the relation between the killer and his victims is thrilling. This episode really constructs a whole world --more normal than Jose Chung- around this monster... and his final line was breathtaking to me).
4. Syzygy (the universe is in armony in order to give all its power to a couple of crazed teenagers)
3. Jos Chung's ""from outer space"" (what is this? What's the reality behind all the witnesses, all the words, dialogues and lines? Who are the aliens? the ones out of this world or us, here but out of it, as well?)
2. Revelations (the religious topic is so well treated and Scully's belief being tested by Mulder make you relate more with the skeptic -now a believer-).
1. Clide Bruckman's final repose (can you be so obsesed with an idea that it makes you a psiquic? And what if this psiquic ability takes away from you your love for life?)
Also look up for other really good ones like Oubliette and Grotesque.
The extras are better than the ones in the previous package. The footage of David Duchovny fighting with the puppet of a cat for the episode Teso Dos Bichos always makes me laugh.",1018828800,,2777,4.6578411405295315
1411796,5,B000059TQ9,"The third season will most probably be the point at which the X-files had me captured. The story lines, development of characters Mulder and Scully along with their problems encountered continue to draw me into the show.

One thing I never really realized when these shows aired, was that these are actually some good solid stories. Some of the monster/mutant episodes do kinda 'bite', but there are many arching stories that connect with one another and many stand-alone episodes as well that are just fantastic when you consider the budget. For instance, in an episode about an alien bounty hunter who comes to earth for a seek and destroy mission on some rogue aliens that are camped out here, your not seeing any huge sets or blockbuster effects, but the stories impact is the same due to good scripting, filming, appropriate effects at the right time, and most importantly-originality. It's the originality of most of these episodes that make them what they are. I thought the first season was a little hoky, but the second and third were great.",1002067200,2,1036,4.761111111111111

To watch these shows is always a thrilling experience. The material here gets 5 stars, probably the apex of a truly great show. But technically, this box set has some of the worst digital compression I've seen on a DVD that isn't 'Almost Famous.' The detail is sharp, but cramming 3+ hours on each disc makes the fast action digital 'crawl' hard to watch. Sometimes Mulder & Scully move like claymation dolls. It was a distracting problem for the first two DVD box sets, but by now SOMEONE at FOX should have noticed. Next time, they should remove useless features like 'international clips', unrevealing commentary by Chris Carter and CD-ROM games that many 'non-computer' fans cannot play. 'The X-Files' is all about aesthete and mood. If the next installment doesn't solve the visual/technical problems, there is no chance that I'll be a sucker for a 4th time.

1411802,5,B000059TQ9,"This season is, to me, one of the best ones for the X-Files.  There are so many good episodes, it's hard to know where to begin.  I guess the beginning.
The Blessing Way / Paperclip is the best season-opening story in the history of the show, IMO.  It's non-stop action and revelation, tinged with a bit of mysticism as well.  The stand-off between Skinner and Scully at the end of Blessing Way  is not to be missed, along with the exchanges between CSM and Skinner.
It continues on with other winners, Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose, Jose Chung's From Outer Space (both by the incomparable Darin Morgan), Oubliette, Revelations.  My favourite of the conspiracy eps, though, is Wetwired.  I've seen it many times since I bought this DVD, and it never fails to thrill.  The descent of Scully into mania, Mulder's determination to know the truth, save his friend, and unmask what's really going on, it's all here.  All of the episodes (with the exception of the really terrible Teso Dos Bichos) have at least something to offer, even if they're not the best.
I've talked a lot about the season itself, but how are the discs?  The picture quality is really good, the extras are interesting, but there's one thing that brings this set a step above the first two seasons (other than the season itself being the best).  Commentaries!!!!!
Yes, the X-Files people have finally decided to include audio commentaries of a couple of episodes.  I didn't realize what I was missing until I watched Jose Chung's From Outer Space with the commentary track on.  Darin Morgan is a god, and Rob Bowman plays well off of him.  I loved hearing the behind the scenes details of why this happened, what Darin was trying to say when that happened, etc.
The commentary for Apocrypha is also very interesting, though I find Chris Carter's voice a little annoying.  Still, he is the main X-Files guy, and it was interesting.  Being from Vancouver, I found Carter's insights about shooting up here were worth the price of admission by themselves.
Buy this DVD set now.  Buy the first two if you can, but definitely buy this one.  Then, in November, buy Season 4, which is the second best season.  Then prepare to be entertained for a long, long time.",999820800,18,2222,4.695090439276486

1411807,5,B000059TQ9,"Wow... These DVD sets just keep getting better and better. Not only does this set contain what is, in my humble opinion, the best season of the show ever, it also contains some pretty neat extras.
Once again Fox has produced beautiful packaging with great artwork and a nice little booklet. The packaging does contain an amusing mistake in the text inside - see if you can spot it... The set folds all the way out to reveal 7 glorious DVDs containing 24 of the best episodes ever to grace our TV screen. The first six DVDs contain the episodes, while the seventh DVD contains all the extras. There are more extras in this set than either of the first two sets. Two of the episodes have director/writer commentary, which is great. The deleted scenes are generally interesting to watch, and the 20 minute documentary is really great. I'm a die-hard x-phile so there's not much I don't know about the show - however, the extras contained a LOT I didn't know.
The season as a whole is almost perfect, containing just the right amount of stand-alone and mythology (ongoing storyline) episodes. The season opens with a bang, concluding the major cliffhanger that ended the second season. There is really not a bad episode in the whole bunch, except maybe one or two near the end of the season but the quality of those is debatable.  Writer Darin Morgan contributes the three 'comedy' episodes, all of which work well and one of which (Jose Chung' ""From Outer Space"") is my all-time favorite episode EVER.
There are some great two-parters here too; ""Nisei"" / ""731"" have great action sequences and do a lot to advance the show's ongoing storyline. ""Piper Maru"" / ""Apocrypha"" are classic episodes which introduce the mysterious 'black oil', a storyline that continues to this day and was a major feature of the X-Files movie. ""Talitha Cumi"" is the final episode and is a cliffhanger. Probably not the best season-ender ever but a fine episode nonetheless, and it will definitely make you want to see the conclusion (note: if you can't wait for the season four DVDs to come out, the concluding episode ""Herrenvolk"" is available on VHS). For Skinner fans there is a great Skinner-centric episode called ""Avatar"" which was co-written by David Duchovny. And of course there are Mulder-centric (""Grotesque"") and Scully-centric (""Revelations"") episodes.
One interesting tidbit of trivia: Lucy Liu of ""Ally McBeal"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" fame is one of the guest stars in the episode ""Hell Money"". And ""D.P.O."" has a great guest performance by Giovanni Ribisi, who has since become quite famous (he has starred in ""Friends"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"").
David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson put in a great performance every single episode, and if you can't see the great chemistry they have together then you need to go to your optician immediately. What makes this chemistry even more remarkable is the fact that the two actors have a very frosty relationship off-screen.
Bottom line: you NEED this set. It's the most intriguing, consistent, diverse and interesting seasons (although some may disagree) and when you take 24 episodes of the best TV show ever and put them on DVD with great extras and a very reasonable price, you have something that any TV fan should have.
Picture quality is better than the first two seasons but some may still be annoyed by the graininess of the image, especially in the dimly-lit scenes, of which there are a lot in this series. Of course, it's vastly better than VHS though and is really not that bad. Please don't let it put you off buying the set. After all, it's the best quality you'll ever see these episodes in.
Non x-philes should start with the first season and watch the show in order - you'll get much more out of it if you do it that way rather than just randomly watching episodes or seasons in the wrong order. And for x-philes, what could be better than owning an entire season in one great package? Put this next to your season one and two sets and you'll be one step closer to heaven. I for one am counting the days until the season four DVD set.",993600000,10,4081,4.731741573033708

I really like the fact that I can control what see and when I see it.  I can jump to a favorite scene with ease or see a deleted scene at my whim. The color and clarity of each disc are terrific.  M & S have never looked so good.  The additional commentary from Chris Carter, Mat Beck, the writers (including Darin Morgan and Vince Gilligan) and directors (Kim Manners and Rob Bowman)and other instrumental members of the cast and crew provided entertaining bits of insight and humor.
The deleted scene in The Blessing Way between Scully, Momma Scully and Melissa provided a great deal of information on the relationship between the three characters.  I wish the powers hadn't cut that scene from the final product because it says so much in such a short amount of time.  For that scene alone, it's worth buying the DVD.
Remember folks, this is the season when Agent X has that fabulous scene where he saves Mulder from the train car that's about to explode.  This is also the season where Scully has that great ""Face Off"" scene with Skinner. All questions about her toughness are put to rest.
Oh, and Darin Morgan is soooo adorable in his interview!

Darin Morgan lends his hand infusing humor and deeply faceted characters in his episodes.  I miss Darin Morgan.
Anderson and Duchovney are exceptional as our lead characters that struggle to make sense of the conspiracy that drives the show.  Development of the characters themselves continues as the season progresses, which only adds to the quality of the show.
The DVD version is clean and sound is exceptional.  You will have a new appreciation of this if you've ever tried to watch older episodes on FX.

About the episodes, it's incredible how Chris Carter forces you to be aware of every detail you see, getting you to make conclusions on every episode, until you get to see the truth about it.
In this Season you will see the ""Sindicate"" (as they call themselves) for the first time. You'll see how the Smoking Man's authority is limited. You will also know the link between Mulder's father, the Sindicate and the Smoking Man.
Someone was asking ""why no spanish subtitles""... well, in fact it has spanish subtitles. Yet, a weird thing is that French subtitles are included, but they don't seem to work (at least for me), I suppose the reason is because french audio is included, don't know.

It's not that the later seasons aren't good, it's just that season three perfected the dialogue, and the cinematography (the dark lighting and colors are amazing in so many of the episodes). The writing also reached it's peak with scenes like the ""Russian Roulette"" scene at the end of Pusher or the ""Smoking Alien"" in Jose Chung's, or even the two voiceovers in Grotesque.

The majority of season three is taut, creepy, and provocative--as well as humorous and witty (the Darin Morgan written episodes). As well, Gillian Anderson's acting is beyond wonderful.
The DVD extras are worthy in general, but the stand-out ones are the commentary for episodes ""Aprocrypha"" (Chris Carter and director Kim Manners) and ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" (director Rob Bowman and writer Darin Morgan). Perhaps in future collections there will be more.

1411820,3,B000059TQ9,"The third season was a great one and all episodes are here and just as much fun as they were the first time around.  However, I am getting annoyed with the extra material.  I remember at the end of the second season and again during the third season, Fox aired two specials - Secrets of the X-Files and More Secrets of the X-Files.  Why weren't these added to the bonus material.  Personally I would have found it more interesting than those silly FX promo spots.  You have an expensive television program, 20 episodes in all - and the best they can give you is a half-dozen or so outtakes.  Also, the documentary footage - The Truth Behind Season Three - while very good, is way too short and omits a lot of material that I believe would be fun.  Finally, where's Duchovny and Anderson on this thing?  Season Two had some observations by Steve Railsback on playing Duane Barry. But Season Three brought in some truly interesting performances by Peter Boyle, Giovanni Ribisi, etc.  It would have been nice to have gotten some observations from them as well. The interviews with the writers, producers and various techs are interesting, but the documentary feature is very light on interviews with the various characters who filter in and out of the series.  Instead we get more Chris Carter. Overall, if you're going to spend this kind of money for a deluxe box set, Fox and Carter should really try to give you a little more bang for your buck.",989625600,3,1445,4.587548638132295
1411821,5,B000059TQ9,"This DVD set beautifully presents what is quite possibly my favorite season of the X-Files.  Excellent mythology episodes, highly entertaining behind-the-scenes footage and all of the additional extras make this set worth owning if you are a fan of the show.  I won't list all my favorites here, as it'd be an unnecessarily long list and other reviewers have covered this well enough, I will share my thoughts on an episode that most fans will agree was not the best.
Though the dubiously titled ""Teso Dos Bichos"" is often called one of the worst episodes ever (it's the first episode I remember watching, and I can't totally agree with most people's hatred of it because of the nostalgia factor), the story of the special effects behind the episode is my favorite story on the extras disc.  Without spoiling the episode too much, I'll just say that in the episode's defense, the cats were hilarious (how DOES one train a cat?) and poor Gillian Anderson was VERY allergic which I suppose contributed to the overall sub-par quality of the episode's effects.
Assuming you've purchased the last two seasons, this one is very much the same in quality of picture, sound, etc.  I will agree with another reviewer who said the discs are hard to pry out.  My only wish for this set is that they would put the discs in standard DVD boxes.  The package is beautiful, but not very practical at all.  I've had trouble holding the packaging open long enough to try to dig a DVD out of its holder (I'm afraid my arms aren't that long!) and would love to transfer these to a proper case!  This isn't enough to deter me from future purchases, but it's just a thought.  All in all though, I can honestly say I'm VERY pleased with this set.  I look forward to buying future seasons.",989539200,6,1764,4.60702875399361
1411822,4,B000059TQ9,"From the outset, Season 3 established THE X-FILES as one of the most interesting television shows ever.  With the two-part denoument of the season 2 cliffhanger, TXF completed its first 3-part epic, and gave notice that the mythic themes (of which investigation into the ""paranormal"" becomes emblematic) would henceforth be developed on a much larger canvass.
The 3-part opening salvo begun with the previous season's ANASAZI and continued in THE BLESSING WAY-PAPER CLIP (my favorite episodes in the whole series) features the nothing less than the Heroes death, descent into Hell, and resurrection, in the context of an ever more cosmic confrontation of Freedom vs. Tyranny, Truth vs. The Lie, and Life vs. Death.  The cinematic 2-parter, NISSEI-731, sets up the heroic quest as an extension of the Grail myth -- you can even hear strains of Lohengrin and Parsifal in the scoring -- with Mulder and Scully as the chaste knights whose heroic virtue stands in stark contrast to the sinister ""black ops"" forces that would keep hidden the Truth That Is ""Out There.""  The mytharc continues with a third double episode, PIPER MARU-APOCRYPHA, in which the Black Oil is introduced and the wily Krycek establishes himself as an independant antagonist whose agenda remains mysterious.  The season concludes with the great cliffhanger TALITHA CUMI, an episode that is so nerve-wracking, you may want to put off watching it till Season 4 is released.
Stand alone episodes in this season, especially CLYDE BRUCKMAN'S FINAL REPOSE, PUSHER, AND JOSE CHUNG'S ""FROM OUTER SPACE,"" raised the bar for network television and, as nutty as it sounds, seem to be unimaginable on any other network than Fox.
The set lost a star for one reason:  the quality of the image is just too grainy in places.  That doesn't mean that it's unwatchable -- far from it.  It's just that, by DVD standards, this could have been better.  The sound is fine and the extras are pretty good.  Especially entertaining are the international clips where you can watch Mulder and Scully scream at each other in Japanese, for instance.
Overall, the set is highly recommended with the one reservation.  Of course, X-Philes will want it anyway, and will forgive the drawback.",989452800,17,2225,5.038147138964578

If you are a serious fan of the X-Files you have here the entire third season;  unlike the video release of some years ago where one could complain certain episodes were missing, here they are all present.  But I would point out certain episodes I feel are worthy of special note.  ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" might well be the best episode of the entire series to date.  ""Oubliette"" is a vastly underrated masterpiece.  ""2Shy"" is just as good as any of the classic ""Monster of the Week"" episodes like ""Squeeze"" or, more recently, ""Hungry"".  ""Syzygy"" and ""Grotesque"", and especially ""Avatar"", are other gems.  All television show distributors should heed the fine example of Fox in releasing X-Files season-by-season.  As for extras  (as if we really need more than every single episode of the season) these are the best available:  all episode promos, several deleted scenes, all the video-release Chris Carter interviews, all the Fox Cable Channel extras, etc.  Beyond praise.",989193600,2,1031,5.071428571428571
1411825,5,B000059TQ9,"I feel so priviledged!  I saw this puppy on the shelf at Best Buy on the first (a week before it was supposed to be released) and snatched it up quick.  Sure enough, it's gone now.  Much like the UFOs that Mulder finds, it was gone without a trace a few days later.
What I can say, though, is that this is an AMAZING set. Not only are there 24 of the series' best episodes (well... 22 if you get real and admit that ""Teso Dos Bichos"" and ""Quagmire"" sucked), but there are some amazing extras.  The standard ""The Truth behind Season 3"", original TV trailers, and the 12 ""Conversation with Chris Carter"" segments (lifted from the VHS releases) are here, but the deleted scenes, special effects clips, and the episode commentaries take teh cake.  I wish there were more commentaries, but hearing Darin Morgan and Rob Bowman talk about ""Jose Chung"" was enough.
The only complaints I had were that (still) the episode trailers aren't on the discs with the episode, but on their own, and that some of the ""FX Behind the Truth"" segments have already appeared on the previous discs (the Toby Lindala and Scully's Apartment clips were on Season 1).
All in all, an amazing advancement in releasing these seasons that makes them well worth the hundred bucks spent.  I can't wait for season 4... to see Memento Mori, Musings of a Cigarette-Smoking Man, Small Potatoes, and all the others.

1411826,5,B000059TQ9,"Season 3 has got to be the best season in terms of the complexity displayed.  The knowledge that The X-Files wasn't another run of the mill tv show with a tiny cult following enabled Chris Carter to expand the mythology episodes to, well, mythic proportions.  The third season also gave Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny a chance to do yeoman work, and each came up strong performances.  The third season was nominated for a 8 emmy awards, and won five (though both the show and Anderson were overlooked, and Duchovny wasn't nominated!).
  The Best episodes (I see no point in limiting myself when there are many of equal quality).
---The Blessing Way/Paper Clip:  A Brilliant conclusion to the cliffhanger that Anasazi was in Season 2.  Not only a very good wrapping up, this became the episodes that truly (in my mind) kicked off the complex mythology episodes. ---Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose:  Take a very funny Peter Boyle, mix in two bemused FBI agents, an outlandishly hilarious plot, and a superb technical team and what does one get.  Merely one of the best episodes period.  And that is high praise indeed folks. ---Nisei/731:  The episode that introduces the chip in the neck.  Anderson and Duchovny are marvelous when apart, but their scenes together are sheer brilliance, something vital to the life of the series. ---Revelations:  Sheer beauty.  The technical team deserves credit for fashioning this episode, from the brilliant shots, to the Snow score, everything here is dazzling, especially Anderson. ---Piper Maru/Apocrypha:  David Duchovny is incredible.  The black oil introduced becomes very important later, but it's commencement was another complexity in the mythology. ---Pusher:  Another great stand alone.  This one is a cut above the rest.  My personal favourite of season 3, Pusher gives us what many movies can't: realistic characters, a thrilling set-up, a nail biting climax, all while re-imagining the limits of television.  As brilliant as any episode in later shows, I highly recommend one watches this in conjunction to Season 4's Paper Hearts.  Two brilliant guest actors give magnificent performances.  Gillian Anderson is simply luminous. ---Jose Chung's Aliens from Outer Space:  Thought Clyde Bruckman was outlandish.  Watch this episode.  It defines outlandish, while allowing everyone to be in on the fun.  ---Talitha Cumi:  Though it pales to the previous year's Anasazi, or the next year's Gethsemane, this is an episode to catch.
