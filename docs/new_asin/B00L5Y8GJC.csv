It also shows that the government instituted  (public) educational system has purposely done all that it can to keep the black contribution to civilization untold because it unravels the lies and misperceptions that HAVE BEEN elaborated on time and time again.

Rule # 1 is KEEP PEOPLE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT RACISM IS Dr. Degruy, Dick Gregory, and Shahrazad Ali speak about the aspect of power on the part of white supremacy. Rule # 2 KEEP THE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION OF BLACK PEOPLE HIDDEN Nas, Dr. Umar Johnson, Kaba Kamene, George Fraser, and Paul Mooney speak about this rule Paul Mooney made me smile when he said the toilet seat was invented by a black man. Rule # 3 DO NOT ALLOW BLACK WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO BE EXEMPT FROM THE EFFECTS OF WHITE SUPREMACY Kaba Kamene talks about a personal experience when he went shopping for a doll for his daughter. Also a major focus under rule # 3 is BLACK WOMEN AND STERILIZATION Dr. Carol Anderson talks about the lynching of a pregnant black woman in the state of Georgia, here is a trivia question for you do you know who is the youngest person ever to be electrocuted in the U.S.A. a black teenager aged 14 named George Stinney. Before you agree to any body organ removal please watch this film first ""ANOTHER HIDDEN PHENOMENON THAT NOT ONLY INVOLVES BLACK CHILDREN BUT BLACK PEOPLE IN GENERAL IS THE PRACTICE OF ORGAN TRAFFICKING."" Rule # 4 USE COMPROMISING BLACKS TO MAINTAIN WHITE SUPREMACY Tariq Nasheed makes an excellent point ""African-Americans are the only group of people that are rewarded for turning against other black people, book deals, T.V. shows, radio shows, all different kinds of incentives."" Rule # 5 THE BLACK POPULATION MUST ALWAYS BE CONTROLLED this is a vitally important rule that is masterfully talked about by the MASTER TEACHERS you may want to watch rule # 5 a second time. Rule # 6 MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND JIM CROW. Rule # 7 CREATE POLICIES TO KEEP BLACKS NON-COMPETITIVE. I have watched this DVD film seven times I wanted to equal the number of rules in this film, I hope that you will buy and watch this powerful DVD film at least one time.",1421020800,4,2270,4.621287128712871

I suggest buying the DVD and taking notes to increase your knowledge.  After taking notes I have studied the commentators and the people (subjects) discussed in the film.  I would have given it 5 starts, but after doing research on one of the commentators, I started to wonder if this person (Dr. Phil Valentine) is legit.  If the articles about him on the internet is true, he believes that President Obama is the son of Malcom X.  I find this claim outrageous.  To be fair, this claim is not stated by him in the film, but it makes me question everything else that he discusses in the film.",1408838400,5,744,4.37956204379562

This invaluable series is a MUST for Black Christians,Muslims and those who practice the Hebrew faith.

A film like this is needed like a gun needs bullets and like a question needs an answer. And this film is the very much needed discussion that should be brought to the forefront of society. Systematically, classified black people can no longer afford to play with systematic white supremacy and playing dumb about institutionalized racism. The information that floored me the most was about George Washington Carver. Again, this film is ammunition for dealing with suspected white supremacists and people of the dominant society who buddies up with systematic, white supremacy in order to get tangible ends. Systematically classified black people are being waged into a war against them and no one is going to come and save you. Be the instrument of your own change and if it comes to bloodshed then so be it. If you want freedom and liberty, just study how America became the land of the free and home of the brave.

6472707,3,B00L5Y8GJC,"I'm happy to have this dvd to add to my collection and I did learn a few new things from it. But, for the most part, it felt as if this installment didn't dig much deeper than Hidden Colors 2 did. While Hidden Colors 1 felt like an introductory documentary; Hidden Colors 2 felt like it was taking it's viewers much deeper into black history and black biology. 3 felt more like it backtracked a bit and, instead of going deep into the subject of being black, it just tackled white supremacy affecting blacks and black economics.. something that has been touched on in both 1 and 2 already and didn't need it's own dvd. That being said, I did learn some new things about black American history and was made aware of some things that are currently going on that are affecting black people that I either did not know much about or had no knowledge of, at all. I'm hoping they do a 4th installment that allows some of these well-learned speakers like Umar Johnson to delve deeper into the subject of black consciousness, black biology and sciences. I would like to see more about how we as black people are affecting ourselves through our choices of foods, music, TV and movie viewing, religious pratices, etc. Alot of people are waking up to the fact that there is more out there than what they have been bred to accept. It's time to go deeper for those people and start feeding us meat and potatoes, nolt more appetizers. Good dvd, but more inspirational than educational.",1406073600,39,1470,4.530075187969925

This documentary gives intricate details & pictorial proof (once again) of what systematic racism entails. Most historical documentaries address the after effects of social ills but barely touch upon the root cause; in this case, racism, which is the greatest social injustice in the world.

What I love about each documentary is that it gives the audience practical solutions to implement in their daily lives.

I am an avid fan of these documentaries and I will do my best to support every Hidden Colors installment and encourage others to do the same.

This documentary really breaks down the reality of the dimensions of racial warfare thrust upon us on a regular everyday basis with most of us not even aware of it because of the sleep state we're in because of slavery. The slumber i'm referring to is actually called the TRIPLE STATE OF DARKNESS  (DEAF DUMB AND BLIND) caused by breaking Afrikan people down systematically for slavery.,1405468800,,411,5.044117647058823

6472722,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"Just got finish watching the documentary and Tariq Nasheed delivers the best in HC3. This is a wake up call for all that are of color and descendants of the african continent. This movie brings the facts that you will not  get in the text books at schools in america, not even at HBCUs. If you really want to get a handle on your situation and want to work in unity with your fellow brother and sister for economic power but don't know how, get this movie.",1405382400,,456,4.241379310344827
6472723,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"Awesome! loved it just as much as Hidden Colors 1 & 2.. All 3 are a MUST have.. I cant wait for Hidden Colors 4!

This is more important than watching football, people. These are our children. They are being hunted, and the media is saying little about it. I have a feeling all of the killing of black children in Chicago and Detroit has something to do with this. Pay Attention. I would not be surprised if this is why the held Trayvons body for 3 days in the morgue.",1404950400,3,468,5.985074626865671
6472728,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"Excellent.
I enjoyed viewing Hidden Colors 3: The Rules of Racism. What I think is great about this film is that the
information is presented by heavyweights in the field of study. There is a diversified lineup of researchers and entertainers
dropping information that may change the way you view everyday life. The film can be described as the start of a
new renaissance period that include revolutionary thoughts, resurrection of the unity of a race of people and the restitution of a group of people that are still being defamed and treated in an unjust manner especially in the United Sates.",1404950400,3,595,4.8431372549019605
6472729,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"Saw it in MTL. Great film. I could have done with a little more Mooney, and a little less Gregory. Also, an intermission would have been nice. This will be perfect for dvd, because it is very dense with information and definitely a movie you could watch multiple times.",1404864000,3,269,4.510204081632653

6472731,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"Best Documentary Ever!!!! I saw this at the premiere in Los Angeles!  It was so profound, inspiring and uplifting. I own Hidden Colors 1and 2 and have already ordered my copy of Hidden Colors 3. This definitely tackles a lot of current issues we as Blacks in America continue to face and gives solutions that we all should practice. Peace and Blessings to the people of the struggle. Ase Brother Tariq Nasheed for another powerful film.",1404864000,3,436,4.7368421052631575
6472732,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"These people are not playing bringing the information you need to know about the issues we deal with being black in the USA. The pictorial images are strikingly in your face in the most brazen way to get your attention, yet truthful. I pre-ordered on Amazon, and still waiting on the delivery date. Out of my impatience to see the movie, I ended up buying my copy at the The Dock bookstore in Ft. Worth. Check the Hidden Colors website to see the selected stores (near your hometown) that's supporting Tariq Nasheed to see if they have copies. It is a must have and its like blessed water in the middle of a desert.",1404864000,4,615,4.4035087719298245

6472734,5,B00L5Y8GJC,This is arguably the best documentary hands down. If you are in anyway confused about racism/white supremacy this is a must watch. Not only does this movie give you knowledge but it gives you some instruction on what to do to battle racism white supremacy. Simply a life changing experience.,1404604800,5,291,4.84

6472736,5,B00L5Y8GJC,My entire family attended the premier of the Hidden Colors 3.  This movie is a thought and action provoking film for any person regardless of race or background.  The whole hidden color series 1 to 3 are all awesome movies.  I enjoyed watching this at home with friends and family members and that was great.  This was my first time watching this film with a live audience and I must say it was powerful. I cant describe how happy I am to see some real history.  Thank you for making this film. Please keep up the good work. MUST SEE FOR YOUr family.  Hidden colors films will continue to receive my support..,1404345600,6,609,4.392857142857143
6472737,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"I have watched Hidden Colors 1 & 2 and have pre-ordered HC3 can't wait to view it. The need for this information to be disseminated amongst our people is more important that many take for granted. First we must focus on building up businesses (The Solutions Section of HC2) for which we can free ourselves from the proverbial rat race of 9-5, which impedes upon the valuable time that should be spent in rebuilding our homes, relationships, and communities. The root cause as I see it, is the item or thing in which you are trading your most irreplaceable asset, which is time that can never be replaced for a piece of printed paper with intrinsic value. Honestly the USD is only backed by the faith of the US government that they will pay their debts back on time.

The $10 you accumulate today will be worth $5 next week and by the end of the month only have $0.10 - $0.25 cents of its original purchasing power left over. No matter how much money you save (which is why you should be investing - make your money work for you) you'll never be able to move forward because the Federal Reserve prints $75 BILLION new dollars each month, it's impossible for the money you saved to be worth the same amount it originally was with so much new money coming in.

I encourage all people of African descent to study the history of money, why we were taken off the gold standard, and the introduction of the credit system. Then many more things will become apparent to you that are mostly ""hidden"" because you don't understand the rules nor the language of the game. Once you have a better understanding of the monetary system we use on a daily basis and how that is the true mechanism for control then can we prosper in all things available. A digital protocol (the internet and email are freely available protocols) that is increasingly getting more attention around the world for being a better currency or method of payment is bitcoin and how it's global, borderless characteristics can change the world for generations to come.",1404345600,12,2024,4.573002754820936

6472742,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"Everyone should thank Tariq Nasheed for this documentary. It was excellent. If you are not inspired to go and do for yourself then I don't know what else to tell you. Learn all you can about building wealth for yourself and your people. Support one another, get out of debt and build. Don't use racism as an excuse to give up. Black men learn who you are as a man and stop chasing women and going to strip clubs so much. If you build your communities and enrich yourself then women will come to you with respect. I got my riches through the stock market and I don't work for anyone. I also don't buy Jordans Playstations and Xboxes  but I buy Sony, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nike, and other stocks. It's all about wealth Black People. I still drive a 14 year old car. Read The Millionaiire Next Door to see why I will never finance my own oppression.

I researched a lot of the info provided in all 3 films (cause thats what i do with all documentaries that I  watch) and I also reminisced about my own personal experiences while living Black in America, and from what Ive found everything in all 3 documentaries seem to be on point. Of course you'lll have some folks that cant relate try to challenge some of the info or look at it with an evil eye, and thats just fine. Some of the info is debatable...but for the most part the info wasn't pulled out of ""thin air"".  Good stuff!! Go check for yourself!!!",1403913600,8,660,4.446280991735537

6472752,5,B00L5Y8GJC,"Saw this documentary two nights ago and absolutely loved it. There was so much information, I wish I had a pen and paper with me. I'm buying this DVD to play it on my campus next semester. I just wished they went more in dept or used specific examples in the first few RULES. A lot of ""new"" people would be skeptical. I already knew what they were referring to when they mentioned certain broad topics -which some people would label as allegations- but that's only because I am already conscience and well read. But for those who are just being introduced to these concepts/not conscience, may take it as far fetched and paranoid. I was happy to see that as the documentary progressed they used more examples and statistics. There were so many topics they mentioned such as the prisons under wall street, etc. that I now want to read up on. I spoke to Dr. Kaba yesterday at a discussion, and he says that there is a study guide that goes along with the documentaries. If you want one you can email him for it.",1403913600,17,1009,4.401069518716578
