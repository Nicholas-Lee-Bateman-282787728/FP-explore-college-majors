7222743,1,B00YIZWJQQ,I purchased this DVD from another seller and I'm so disappointed!!  I'm 57 years old and found this totally boring!  The only good thing is the location.  I do not recommend this!,1443225600,,179,4.53125

7222745,5,B00YIZWJQQ,I wanted a walk at home workout and this dvd delivers.  It's exactly what it says it is - a doable walking workout for people with arthritis. Plus the gardens were total eye candy.  Beautifully done DVD.,1441324800,6,203,4.45945945945946
7222746,3,B00YIZWJQQ,"I have many exercise tapes, including Yoga for the Rest of Us series, which I love.  This is really boring and the music is kind of pathetically uninspired.  I would rather just turn on a music channel on my TV and make up my own moves.  If you really have a hard time because of your arthritis, then the chair portion would be good for you, but I like to move and dance and this was just too boring for me.  Sorry.",1440633600,,415,4.024390243902439
7222747,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"""Arthritis Relief Walking Workout for Seniors"" has two two-mile workouts (the first one utilizes the Functional Fitness Band which is included with the DVD and the second one can be done with light hand weights or even a bottle of water).  Each workout can be done separately or they can be done together for a four mile workout.  Each workout has two variations - one sitting and one standing.

Workout Number One:

This is a nice thirty minute walking workout that utilizes the Functional Fitness Band (which is included) for much of the workout.  The Functional Fitness Band is nice and sturdy and easy to use.  There are a nice variety of moves in this workout including walking in place, toe taps (to the side, back, in front), marching with knee lifts, leg extensions, and more.  My favorite moves on this workout are the leg presses (putting one foot on the Fitness Band and raising your leg up and down then switching to the other leg) and the abductions (putting the fitness band around your legs and then put putting one leg to the side and then switching to the other leg).  While I did do these exercises while standing, I did notice the chair exercises were just as effective as the standard ones with a nice variety of moves.

Workout Number Two:

This thirty minute two-mile walk involves using light hand weights (or water bottles) and if I had to pick a favorite of the two walks on this DVD it would be this one simply because I love using weights while exercising.  Again, there is a nice variety of moves in this section including marching in place, knee lifts, walking back and forth, toe taps (forward, back, and to the side) crossover steps, and more.  You incorporate the weights or water bottle for many of these moves.  Again, I did not do the chair exercise but I really liked watching the different variations done when sitting in the chair.  One thing I really liked about this segment is the fitness tips in the left hand side of the screen that let you know what movement is coming up next.

Bottom line:

While this DVD is titled ""Arthritis Relief Walking Workout for Seniors"" you don't have to be a senior or have arthritis to benefit from this workout.  I am not quite a senior nor do I have arthritis, but I do have the aches and pains associated with getting older and I find this exercise DVD really works.  I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan and I find this DVD to be perfect for days when I want a less intense that Leslie's but still effective workout - I can definitely feel the benefit by the end of this DVD.  Suzanne Andrews has a nice gentle presence - she really seems to enjoy what she is doing and her enthusiasm is catching.  The music is upbeat - perfect for the workouts.  I like that there are so many options on this DVD - two different two-mile workouts or a four mile workout, as well as doing these exercises by either walking or sitting in a chair.

I highly recommend this DVD.

I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.",1440460800,8,2999,4.462385321100918

7222750,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"Very good DVD for Seniors.  I have not exercised in a long time so it is difficult to keep up, but hope to be able to work my way thru a full routine  some day.  Extra bonus, they include a stretch band with the DVD.",1484697600,2,216,3.7555555555555555
7222751,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"Spectacular!

I absolutely love this DVD!  I rotate between the first program with the stretchy band and the second program with the weights every day.  There are lot of repetitions, but after a while you will realize why as it really works your body with incredible benefits.  Either using the band or the weights, Suzanne intersperses the exercises with high knee marches, which really make my back feel better, so I love those.  The second half of the program has various exercises that I have not seen before and feel are very beneficial.  Even if you do not have arthritis, I believe this DVD will benefit you because we all have or will have aches and pains which exercising can relieve.  It is like exercising with your physical therapist or best friend!",1473552000,,761,4.71969696969697
7222752,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"Love the dvd. It is easy for me to do, but gives me a wonderful workout.",1468540800,,72,3.5625
7222753,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"I love this session,because the setting is lovely and Suzanne is warm and enthusiastic.",1454198400,,87,5.285714285714286
7222754,5,B00YIZWJQQ,I'm not into dance videos and was looking for a walking workout that is slower paced with moves that are for people like myself who have 2 left feet. I'm 44 years old and have knee arthritis and like how this is very low impact with 0 jumping and helps my knees.  Appreciate the posture cues and her demonstration of how to do the exersizes correctly. She also emphasizes to walk at your own pace. The DVD comes with an exercise band. Just when you're getting tired she gives you a break from using the band.  It only weighs a couple ounces so no need to put it down - you just hold it in your hand until the next exercise with the band which really tones up the back of the arms. Oh and we aren't related lol,1450656000,2,709,4.093525179856115
7222755,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"The best video for an out of shape senior.  I start with the walking and,  when I get out of breath, I continue on the chair.  Also, my husband does his sitting.",1445731200,3,161,3.96875
7222756,2,B00YIZWJQQ,"I thought most of these Functional Fitness workouts would be for those of us getting on in years who wish to move less aggressively and/or those of us who maybe, like me have tried all the other workout DVDs out there and found them to be too strenuous or too fast to keep up with or, maybe I don't really want to keep up with them anyway, because I like doing things a little more slow and stretched out.... so I bought them all.  But NO these are just as fast and as bad as the rest of them.  Her form is bad (or the camera angle is) and I felt could it leave me prone to injury.  She is very awkward, for instance,  with this one her steps are not in an even rhythm which makes me misstep, she is also not in time with the music often enough to mess me up.  I thought this would be a nice walk in a park since it is sold as a virtual walk in a park, but it is in a static setting. It also has added weights or a band so it is not just a walking aerobic workout, it is what ""Sansoners"" would call a boosted walk.  The pace is as fast as Leslie Sansone and I was hoping to find one a bit slower and gentler.  The transitions are quick and awkward, from walking to using the band/weights to walking etc which left me fumbling around to get the band in position or put the band down.  As far as the music goes, I don't really find it any better or worse than any other workout music which all, with the exception of Richard Simmons, leave something to be desired.  The voice over I found disconcerting ""this on check""??? At other times the voice over wasn't with what I was doing, as when it said ""other side"" when Suzanne and I had been doing both sides all along.  After reading some of the other comments I think Suzanne should try working out to her own DVDs and then perhaps she would see what we naysayers mean. Also found the warm up to be very short/nonexistant.  Didn't make it to the cool down so don't know if there was one.",1444780800,7,1934,4.036649214659686
7222757,4,B00YIZWJQQ,Provides great workout and easy on joints at the same time!  Nice mix of exercises.,1443484800,3,83,4.533333333333333
8718440,4,B00YIZWJQQ,I've found this workout to be really helpful. I'm able to keep pace and have even added hand weights to use during the exercise when I'm not using the included band. I would have liked to have seen more onscreen hints as well as a clock to show how much time is left and a constant counter showing how far I have traveled.,1524268800,,322,4.126984126984127
8718441,5,B00YIZWJQQ,I liked being able to sit and do exercising with little pain.,1523923200,,61,4.166666666666667
8718442,2,B00YIZWJQQ,"I have arthritis in my hips.  I was expecting something that gave an indication of what exercises would be useful to help me with that pain.  Instead, this video is simply marching and toe tapping and leg lifting, with no appropriate warm up.

The most annoying thing about this video is that the movements of the instructors do not match the music, and the voiceover is worth zero.  It's not amusing to be marching one-two, one-two, only to have the voice over state, ""onnneeeee.........twoooooo........"" in a beat much slower than what the music is playing.

I'll not be using this again, which is a waste of my money.",1514419200,,620,4.703703703703703

8718444,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"Love this DVD!  The last thing you want to do is move when you have any form of arthritis, but I can personally say, this has helped strengthen my body beyond what I ever imagined.  I feel better and the inflammation has decreased a great deal.  The music isn't the best and the instructors don't always stay in time with the music, but it doesn't matter.  You work at your own pace and do what you need to do.  It really works if you stick with the plan.  I highly recommend it!  And what's even better, you can do it sitting or standing.  There's no excuse why you can't just pop it in and follow along.  You'll feel so much better when you do and even stronger by sticking with the plan.  I love this DVD.  Best thing I could have purchased for myself!",1508198400,2,755,4.173611111111111
8718445,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"There are 2 walking workouts on this DVD. Suzanne incorporates various intervals of compound movements working upper and lower body into intervals of marching, side steps and back lunges. This keeps the heart rate up and works the total body. There is a modifier who does the workouts seated.

I used D-shaped hand weights, 1 pound each. You probably wouldnt want to go any heavier than 3 lbs each.

The first workout is about 32 minutes long. Suzanne uses a stretchie band (included). I used light hand weights instead of the stretchie band, except for the leg presses. The warm up and cool down portions are very short. In the second workout, Suzanne uses light hand weights for most of the workout and it is about 28 minutes long. There is a very short warm up. The last 4-5 minutes is a wonderful cool-down stretch.

I found these walks to be a slower pace than Leslie Sansone's workouts. I actually had to slow myself down because the moves were challenging. I recommend this DVD as great low impact walks. The bonus is that you will work your whole body and this will help your coordination and balance.",1503360000,2,1109,4.619289340101523
8718446,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"When this DVD arrived I just got home from the Dr with the diagnosis frozen shoulder. If anyone has ever had it you basically can't move your shoulder at all. So I spent 2 weeks go to physical therapy with very little results. Then I decided I would just watch this video.
Suzanne in this video does the same exercises with the resistance band that I was paying the Physical therapist to have me do there. So I cancelled my appointments with my therapist. And I'm treating myself at home with this DVD.",1501632000,,502,4.408602150537634
8718447,5,B00YIZWJQQ,"This is a very good workout for your whole body. If you watch it to the end, it has weight lifting exercises too, making it a complete workout. I feel I can move much better after doing these.",1498867200,,192,4.078947368421052
8718448,1,B00YIZWJQQ,Don't waste your money  put on some music you really like and step to it a day throes in some arm movements.,1496793600,,108,3.909090909090909
8718449,5,B00YIZWJQQ,Excellent workout with 2 half hour segments. The first is with stretchy bands and the second is with light weights. This is an excellent DVD for folks with arthritis as well as for folks who want weight resistance exercises.,1490227200,2,224,4.769230769230769
