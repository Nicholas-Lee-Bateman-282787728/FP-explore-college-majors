Come on you remember Fraggle Rock right? Ahhhh I loved watching this show with my sisters.

What a great way to introduce my kids to the Fraggles.

The Meet the Fraggles has 6 episodes featuring our favorite little singing creatures the Fraggles! Remember Gobo, Wembly, Red, Boober and my favorite Sprocket well, they are all there dancing their cares away!

  Beginnings
  We Love You, Wembley
  Boober's Dream
  Red's Club
  Mokey and the Minstrels
  Gobo's Discovery

As soon as the music started, we were there singing along and so are my kids now. Enjoy Fraggle Rock for years to come.",1370044800,,609,4.757281553398058
