I have to say I'm very disappointed in the cartoon not conti.  Very big disappointment.  But the cartoon is great, none the less, but I still wish I had got to see the ending.",1083715200,2,350,4.323076923076923
1211391,4,B00000F84E,"For people who haven't seen the series in years (or ever), this video is a wonderful introduction/refresher. The basic premise: Ren, a 17-year-old lighthouse keeper on the island-kingdom of Octopon on the watery planet of Mer, rescues an old man from drowning as he tries to pilot his raft towards the shore. That man is King Primus of Octopon, and Ren's long-lost father. Primus charges him with gathering the mystical Thirteen Treasures of Rule to save Octopon, and Mer, from the Dark Water, a semi-sentient oily substance that devours anything it touches. However, standing in Primus's (and Ren's) way is the evil pirate lord Bloth, who wants the Treasures for himself. This video is a shortened version of episodes 1-5, which describe Ren gathering a crew, finding a ship, and beginning his Quest for the Treasures.
What makes PoDW so unique is that it was Hanna-Barbera's first attempt at telling a serious story with continuity and substantial, evolving characters, and a lot of effort was put into the development of this fantasy world, the art and design, the story, and, well, everything else, too. ;o) The end result is a brilliant and very underrated work of animation with stunning visuals and a riveting and exciting story that's hard to match. (...)The soundtrack for PoDW is a gorgeous, moving set of music that fits this show perfectly, and the special themes used for the more mysterious and magical moments really, really helped to make them all the more poignant--but (...) the soundtrack was completely revamped, using just a portion of the tracks (the ""suspenseful""/""adventurous"" ones) over and over again, and totally changing the feel of quite a few major scenes. (...).
But generally, this is a condensed version of the start of the show, and if you'd like a nice introduction or a good refresher, I highly recommend this video. It's a cool collectible for other hard-core fans, too--(...). This is my favorite cartoon of all time, and I just can't say enough about how incredible this show is--it's one of the most amazing productions I've ever seen, and if you're a fan of SF/fantasy or animation and haven't had the opportunity to watch any of it...you REALLY need to. You don't know what you're missing. :o)",1080345600,6,2235,4.946808510638298

1211393,5,B00000F84E,"I thought the movie was fantastic never have i seen such a great use of magic, adventure, drama, and comedy.

1211394,5,B00000F84E,"On the ocean-covered planet of Mer, the once glorious Kingdom of Octopon is under siege by a vile pirate-giant named Bloth and his crew of inhuman  marauders. Ren, who has spent his own 17 years in a lighthouse, discovers  that he is the son of King Prymus, ruler of Octopon, who journeyed for the  6 treasures of rule, since he had the first 7. Prymus was capture by Bloth  but not before telling his companions to hide the first 7 treasures and  their compass. When Prymus escapes he manages to reach Ren, but only to be  claimed by the sea, forever.
It is now Ren's destiny to find all Thirteen  treasures of rule, with the magic compass. He is not alone however. At his  side is the exotic and ingenious  Tula , the thief Ioz and Niddler, a  monkey-bird who is always hungry for a bit of food.
But the quest for the  treasures is not a smooth sea trip. Bloth is on his trail and the  unexplored seas and fraught with sea monsters, dangerous `dark waters' and  new lands and peoples.
Enjoyable adventure and action, with a lot of wit  and jokes. Even after 5 years of having it in my possession, I still find  it exciting to watch. It'll make a good gift for kids, especially boys.",968025600,15,1184,4.342465753424658
7908289,5,B00000F84E,"This show was great when I was a kid. It's about this group of riffraff that are fighting the planet consuming ""dark water"" by using a magical compass to find the ""13 treasures of rule"". The antagonist is a rival pirate named Bloth who is seeing the same treasures.",1420070400,,265,4.428571428571429
7908290,5,B00000F84E,"Okay, copyright owners et al -

I don't know what YOU may be thinking, but this series is actually good and needs to be released in all its glory on DVD. I mean, it's already bad enough the whole darn show was CANCELED STUPIDLY EARLY! GRrrr. Too many unfinished stories already. Don't get me started on Firefly...",1278028800,,313,4.491228070175438
7908291,4,B00000F84E,"This is the essential ""action-adventure"". There's plenty of action and mystery, with little explanation of why do things happen. This is partially so because this ""movie"" is basically the first episode of the wrongfully cancelled TV series. But they really could've taken more time to introduce the characters or explain the motives behind their actions. I know 2D animation costs money and the budget was tight, but still, in the first half of the movie things are thrown at you a little too fast. Nothing TOO bad, but, still, one star down. Otherwise, the movie is amazing.

P.S. If you call yourself an ""animation fan"" and do not know Pirates of Dark Water, shame on you.",1263686400,,674,4.810344827586207
7908292,5,B00000F84E,"I LOVED this show. I was SO disappointed when it just disappeared.

This adventure cartoon showed a lot of creative depth, especially when I got to the point where dark water was not just a substance, but an entity.

That was just an awesome turn and kept me wanting to see the NEXT installment.

You would think that with such hit shows as Futurama, Robot Chicken and The Family Guy (not to mention Teen Force), that the Cartoon Channel would have thought about bringing this back.

Just look at how many networks had The Family Guy? Their creators FOUGHT for it after it initially got cancelled due to what, low ratings?

Boy was that short sighted.

After it made the run on several different channels, it is now BACK on the Cartoon Networks Adult Swim...and selling robustly via DVDs.

Can the prince of octapon be resurrected too? The original development team is problably long gone. But there was a good portion of a series completed.

I want the whole series. They should just offer it all on DVD so we'd all be happy. I'd buy right now.",1163808000,5,1045,4.550802139037433
7908293,5,B00000F84E,"The studio never officially  put this series on DVD. Anyone that says they have an official copy is not being honest or is misinformed. There are however copies of DVD's that people have taken upon themselves to create with todays easy to work technology. Sadly even though this show had an amazing fan base it was cancled due to ""low ratings"" long before it's time and halfway before the story got close to finishing. I being a large fan taped every episode and have recently converted them into a DVD format. Please email me if you would like more information!!",1154736000,8,563,4.63

  For anyone that wants the series on DVD.  You can e-mail me and I'll tell you what site you can look on.  I found one that is selling the whole set of 5 DVDs for 40 dollars.

7908295,4,B00000F84E,i was pretty young when it was on cartoon network but from what i remember which is pretty clear was that he only found 12 and they never did show them finding the last treasure. they usually did that so you would by all the movies and stuff so you would buy their protucts. but thats with alot of other shows too back them. but i do clearly remember they only showed hime finding up to the 12 treasure. i think i was about 6 or 7 maybe 5 but thats was my favorite show at the time so i knew. plus i asked my dad. but i really hope and wish they would make the show into dvds whihch would be really great.,1129161600,4,605,3.8870967741935485
7908296,5,B00000F84E,I never got to see if he ever found all 13 of the treasures but maybe some day but anyway this definitely needs to come out on DVD along with alot of the 80s shows. 80s shows are the best.,1124755200,2,188,3.725
