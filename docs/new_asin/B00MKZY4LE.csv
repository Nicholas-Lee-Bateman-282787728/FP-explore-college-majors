The sound is Ok, but the resolution is very mediocre.",1414195200,,85,4.0
8672911,5,B00MKZY4LE,"Brilliant! Magnificent in cinematography and scope. The battles scenes are so realistic that you actually think,  you are there. Absolutely breathtaking in visual pomp and circumstance. Actor Rod Steiger who plays Napoleon, was born to play this role. He even looks like Napoleon without the make-up and costume. Christopher Plummer makes a very good Lord Wellington and the intensity of the film places you right there, in the middle of it. You will definitely choose sides between the Napoleon's France or Wellington's Britain. The abdication of Napoleon is very dramatic and his comeback from exile off of the Isle of Elba, is quite moving. It's historically accurate and a fantastic movie that you can't watch, just once. A Dino DeLaurentis film that is and well worth your viewing time and a viewing 'must', for visual history buff's. Nina Kish",1412294400,,849,5.107913669064748
8672912,4,B00MKZY4LE,"The Waterloo DVD from EarthStation1 proved to be professionally produced and played without problem in my DVD Blu-Ray player (which can be temperamental with disks of less than high commercial quality). My one issue with this purchase is the case provided with the disk. This supplier uses a jewel case they state is ""environmentally friendly."" The problem with this approach is that the jewel case has a spine that is too narrow to allow it having a readable label. It is not ""anything friendly"" to reduce materials used in the product to the point that is non functional. I replaced the supplied case with a real DVD case. I would not mind if the supplier used a slim line case but the one they use is useless.",1411948800,3,712,4.6141732283464565
