8506286,4,B006XDU7X8,"This edition mainly serves as a prequel to the other Polyphonica anime series, focusing more on the development of relationships; esp. between Phoron and Coatie.

Animation quality is more consistent than the other series, though it still has its share of bland filler episodes that left me wondering how dense Phoron was or ridiculous the plot of said episode was.  It also heavily reused a number of One-Man Orchestra setup scenes (most of Phoron's setup, obviously), which takes up time and detracts from the overall later episodes they're activated.  Yes, I know it's an anime and all, and based off a Visual Novel, but the points had to be made.

Regardless, for those that don't know enough Japanese to play the visual novels, this serves as good an introduction to the series as any.  If you do decide you like this series, try giving the other anime series a try, even if it's plot is mostly anime original rather than following some of the plots from the visual novels.",1380240000,2,978,4.763313609467455
8506287,5,B006XDU7X8,"The cover is very misleading.  You get it because you think it is a hentai.  I looked up hentai on this site, Amazon and this came up and it had this sexy cover.  I could not wait to see it.  If you like anime, you are good, but if you only wanted hentai, buy something else.  The cover is the sexiest part.",1371600000,4,307,3.8870967741935485
8506288,5,B006XDU7X8,"I had seen it before and wanted my own copy, i am happy with my new collection.  I recomend these series to everyone",1356566400,,116,4.043478260869565
8506289,5,B006XDU7X8,"To be honest i wasn't to ecstatic to purchase this anime, I felt skeptical about it, but after watching the 1st episode I was hooked. It was a great anime and I enjoyed it.",1346198400,,172,4.088235294117647
8506290,4,B006XDU7X8,"This takes place before the first Polyphonica that was released, when the main character was still in school. There are some minor changes to the story, but you will see a lot of familiar characters =).

Personally, I think that this should have been released first. I also think it was better than the first release.

The cover art does not do the show justice as the show is nothing like what the cover art shows, but whatever, it was still pretty good =).

If you haven't seen Polyphonica yet, watch Polyphonica S before the other one if you want to watch it chronologically =p.",1334275200,15,581,4.514285714285714
8506291,4,B006XDU7X8,"Disregard the cover art! The person on the cover does not exist for all practical purposes as she is shown as a soft and alluring sex-kitten when in reallity she is a cute,short,redheaded,quick-tempered,""B"" cupped at best,spit-fire that earns extra monies by demolishing multistory buildings bare-handed. She often finds a degree of embarrassment whenever she catches herself having,much less showing any emotional attachments. Nudity and fanservice is non-existant. If you want to know what this DVD is about,read the back as it gives a fair discription of the rather weird but somewhat interesting storyline and a production worth about 4 stars,maybe 4 and 1/2. If you want to spend the money on an somewhat interesting story,you could do worse. But if you think the cover art is anywhere indicative of what is on the disks,you will be very upset to discover it isn't so and that false cover art is somewhat like putting a picture of the Virgin Mary in a bikini on the cover of a Bible.",1329955200,50,988,4.922155688622754
