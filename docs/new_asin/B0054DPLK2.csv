8456589,5,B0054DPLK2,"I watched this game back in 1986.  I wasn't a fan of either team, but I remember watching and rooting somewhat for the Mets.  Over the years, I've always felt that Bill Buckner got a bad rap and that more of the blame for the Red Sox collapse should have fallen on pitcher Calvin Schiraldi.  I finally watched the DVD of the game all these years later, and I still feel that way.  In fact, the Red Sox had already blown their lead by the time of Buckner's error.  That error just broke what had become a tie game.

I am a big Texas Rangers fan, and this past October I took my 12-year-old son up to St. Louis to see Game 6 of the 2011 World Series.  Watching the Rangers blow their two-run lead in the bottom of the 9th when they needed only one out to win the championship was just agony.  They managed to regain the two-run lead in the 10th inning and then blow it again in the bottom of the 10th, again when they were just one out away.  Because of this, I now have a new appreciation for what Red Sox fans must have felt as a result of this 1986 Game 6.  And, like the Red Sox, the Rangers wound up losing Game 7 as well.

These games that wind up getting called ""Baseball's Greatest Games"" are always looked at as pure agony by fans of the losing teams...",1344902400,,1260,4.08130081300813
