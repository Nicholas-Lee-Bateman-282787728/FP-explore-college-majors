1861522,5,B00008T3DZ,"I saw this film once when I was 12 years old in the sixties. Nevertheless, I remember it like it was yesterday. The concept, the special effects (simple but very effective) and the conclusion are first rate. It is really the one Corman film that should be widely available on DVD format. Hopefully someone will realize this and get it released.",1189036800,12,344,4.655737704918033
7986736,5,B00008T3DZ,"THE UNDEAD is another movie from Director, Roger Corman, released on region 2 DVD, and NOT in its native land! Is there no god?! A woman named Diana Love (Pamela Duncan- ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS), undergoes hypnosis, and recounts her past life. She finds herself in olden days, on the run for being accused as a witch. Her life in mortal danger, Diana, now known as Helene, must hide under a corpse in its coffin, to elude capture! Meanwhile, a real witch, named Livia (Allison Hayes- ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN, THE ZOMBIES OF MAURA TAU), plots her doom. Is THE UNDEAD utterly absurd, overly-dramatic, and / or cheeeze-filled? Oh yes, it most blessedly is! Corman seems to have decided to channel the left foot of Shakespeare, while simultaneously finding nonsensical parts for Billy Barty and Dorothy Neuman! Even Corman favorite, Bruno Vesota (ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES, WAR OF THE SATELLITES) gets tossed in the mix as an innkeeper! If Roger had extracted his own brain, packed it in ice, and said, ""Action!"", this could have rivaled Ed Wood's miraculous, GLEN OR GLENDA! As it stands, THE UNDEAD is an idiot near-masterpiece. Extra-extra points for Satan (Richard Devon) and his lovely graveyard dancers! Watch for Dick Miller (LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, A BUCKET OF BLOOD) as The Leper! Let us bow our heads. The somnambulist ramblings of Smolkin (Mel Welles) shall echo through our souls forever...",1442016000,,1408,4.895397489539749
7986737,4,B00008T3DZ,"I saw this when it was released in the 50s, and I've never forgotten it. There's a shot in the film where a cat turned into Allison Hayes.  The camera started at her feet; by the time it reached her face, I had entered puberty....",1434758400,,230,4.111111111111111
7986738,4,B00008T3DZ,"This is a decent package for those who've been searching for a decent print of Roger Corman's 1957 cult classic ""The Undead"". It's paired with ""The Amazing Colossal Man""--another AIP 50's feature. But I purchased it for ""The Undead"" and was pleasantly surprised. Both films are on their own disc with a third disc in a sleeve ""Hammer House of Horror---50 Classic Trailers"". The prints of both films are clean and very watchable but somewhat soft. However, just to have this good a print of ""The Undead"" is so worth it The sound is OK, nothing to really gripe about considering. For me, this is a major find until ""The Undead"" is finally given the treatment it deserves and released on it's own merit. But take note, the packaging is good and may say Midnight Movies, it is not from MGM and does not bear the logo. It's from Sci-Fi Collectables and they've done a pretty good job.",1429142400,,879,4.569620253164557

7986740,5,B00008T3DZ,A Corman horror film that is a cut above his usual 50's fare.  A prostitute is hypnotized by a pair of psychiatrist and transported back to a former life as an accused witch.  Some good atmosphere and the B actors give it their best.  Highly recommended.  I hope a good quality US region DVD is released very soon.,1423872000,,314,4.362068965517241
7986741,5,B00008T3DZ,"When will we ever get this movie  released all I have is an old copy that I got off AMC years ago , they have released several of Roger Corman's movies over the last few years still have not done this classic. This is one of the coolest movies around I saw it when I was a kid and have loved it ever since so come on you folks in Hollywood do a proper release of it.

7986742,4,B00008T3DZ,"It's funny, I was looking through new releases on blu-ray for compilations of directors or series and Roger Corman movies popped up.  Most of you are too young to remember the television showing of Saturday afternoon or night ""monster"" movies but during the 60's it was common for most markets to show lot's of ""scary"" movies, often with a local host dressed in a macabre manner.  Elvira is the most modern example that comes to mind.  A lot of those movies shown were often classics like Frankenstein, The Wolfman, Dracula, and all the hammer films but they also included a bunch of the ""B"" movies like ""I was a Teenage Werewolf"", almost always in black and white.  Some of the ""B"" movies turned out to be classics like ""The Blob"" which starred Steve McQueen, although it could be argued to not quite be a ""real B"" movie since the budget was a little higher than most ""B"" movies.  However, ""The Blob"" is an excellent movie to watch acting skills as you can see, and easily tell, the differences between really refined actors and those not quite so finished.  ""B"" movies usually had the less refined actors mainly due to the low, very low, budget.

Of the true ""B"" movies that I watched on Saturday afternoons, there are three that I consider to be honest-to-goodness classics.  One, ""Invaders from Mars"", was remade in the 80's I believe.  I actually like both versions but the original was not only a good story but the kind of movie film students study due to it being shot from the child's point of view.  A very enjoyable movie, even until this day.  The second classic is ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" also remade in the 80's but as a musical and, third, ""The Undead"", the latter two both being Corman films.

Why is it a classic?  First, it is a very good story.  It's well directed, the acting is generally good, and you actually want to sit there and find out what happens.  I don't want to go into the story too much other than to say it's about a women's ""soul"" traveling back in time to her ancestors which end up in Medieval times.  There is some black comedy involved but not to the level of Corman's ""Little Shop of Horror's"".  One recognizable name, Billy Barty, is in the film.  I think this is a story that could easily be remade into a very good film today.  I actually am surprised no-one has remade this movie.

I can understand this not being on blu-ray even though but I believe it was done on film.  The blu-ray version of ""The Dick van Dyke Show"" has been defined as almost flawless so there is no reason to dismiss this possibility to transfer ""The Undead"" to blu-ray, however, a classic television show may sell while an obscure ""B"" movie probably will not thus making the transfer a poor investment.  The good news is ""The Undead"" is available on DVD but, currently, only in a package with other Roger Corman films.

If you like ""scary"" or ""B"" movies and haven't seen this yet, I suggest you check it out.  It is occasionally on television so keep an eye out.  If you're a Corman fan, getting the Corman set is a good value.  Normally I would say wait until blu-ray versions appear but, sadly, this is unlikely so go ahead and grab this compilation.  On a rainy or snowy Saturday afternoon, pop some popcorn, pour a tall soda, and sit back and enjoy a little gem.  In my opinion, it's a movie worth seeing.",1363564800,,3333,4.464462809917356
7986743,5,B00008T3DZ,"Roger Corman is known for producing a seemingly endless library of low-budget films, many of which have become true classics. Director Ron Howard once explained that Corman frequently provided the cameras and film to young unknowns who produced their own scripts and movies under Corman's name. Thus, many well-known filmmakers (like Ron Howard) got their start under Roger Corman's wing.

THE UNDEAD is one of the best of Corman's films. The story of two scientsts who are studying past-life regressions, they convince a young 20th-Century streetwalker to be their test subject. She goes back in time (accompanied by one of the scientists as an observer) to a medieval world in which witchcraft is actively practiced and the devil is busily buying souls.

Unwittingly, she is charged with practicing witchcraft, and is sentenced to be beheaded, though innocent. She is given a chance to escape, but is warned by the real witch that ""Life in this life is death and death in this life is life."" A Hobson's Choice is offered her: To be beheaded now and reincarnate many times later or to live now and die forever.

A truly inventive, mildly erotic, well done and even thoughtful film, THE UNDEAD is well worth a viewing if you can find it.",1285891200,5,1237,4.880952380952381
7986744,5,B00008T3DZ,I remember when my family had a Super 8mm movie projector and bought a 10 minute version of this and I liked it!  I wanted to see it on tv but they never aired.  Then I got a copy on VHS and saw the whole thing and I thought Roger Corman had done his better with this low budget production! I thought it was well written and the actors were at their best performing!  One had to feel sorry for the poor girl at the end when she found out what she really was and what could happen to her whether or not she was beheaded!  She had to take a lesser of the two evils but could not bring herself to figure out which was the lesser of the two.  I am careful as not too spoil this for anyone who wishes to see it.,1229990400,5,706,3.808219178082192
7986745,5,B00008T3DZ,"I, too, first saw this movie in the late 1960s and then once more as an adult. While done on a low budget, the story is original and ends with a rather unsettling plot twist. In brief, two scientists (psychic researchers) invent a machine able to send a person's ""soul"" back to a prior life. A woman is recruited by the two scientists for an ""experiment"" whose purpose she is not aware. Her ""soul"" is then sent back in time to a prior incarnation of herself. In this incarnation, she is young woman living in medieval Europe and condemned to die via a beheading. However, her medieval incarnation is helped to escape her fate by her 20-th century incarnation sent back in time by the scientists. Thus, she apparently will be able to elude the chopping block. However, a (well intentioned) witch explains to her that her fate is in fact to die by beheading in this life. Should she escape the chopping block, all her future incarnations will cease to be; in the alternative, if she willingly submits her neck to the axeman's blow, her soul will be reborn in her future lives. She has one tough decision to make: ""her death is her life and her life is her death."" As she deliberates, her future incarnations call to her in her head, imploring her to give them life by accepting her death in this life. Meanwhile, one of the scientists has sent himself back to the same time and place to watch and observe what choice the woman's medieval incarnation will make. The Devil is also observing the fate of the woman's soul, side-by-side with the scientist. She chooses...to die by execution thereby ""saving"" her future incarnations. Upon her death, the scientist pronounces his curiousity satisfied, bids adieu to Satan, and announces that he will be travelling back now to the 20-th century. Satan laughs and inquires of the scientist, ""Did you not use the unbroken change of the woman's incarnations to reach back in time to this medieval period? So, now that the woman has died, how will you find your way back?"" (Evidently, the scientist has lost his psychic starting point for his return journey). Satan then explains that the scientist's soul will be his (Satan's) once the scientist has lived out his now dead end existence here in medieval Europe.",1190332800,15,2248,4.6936708860759495
