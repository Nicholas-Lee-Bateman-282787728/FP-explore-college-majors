8741839,5,B018AXRKOM,"Great series!  The story is a little cliche the main character is a wizard in modern day Japan,  Their is a major amount of prejudice and racism in this story where the so called normal people try to control magic users.  It is illegal to use magic except in emergency situations such as self defense and saving someones life.  The main character Momiji's mother is on death row for using magic to protect her daughter. and Momiji became a lawyer at the age of 17 to defend her.  This show is filled with great action and mystery and I highly recommend it for Anime Fans.",1472860800,2,571,4.4
