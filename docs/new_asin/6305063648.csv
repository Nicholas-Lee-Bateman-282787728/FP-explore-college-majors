7881895,1,6305063648,"I had to wait 6 months or so before this DVD is available for rent. Actually I thought this was a documentary on Shelley Michelle and the body-double girls doing their job in Hollywood studios (what happens behind the scenes, how they switch with the actresses, etc...) Turned out it's just another strip-tease video. Not really bad, but not what I expected either. This DVD has four chapters (""Double desires"", ""Incredibly wet"", ""Wild fetishes"", ""Exposed""), each features up to five R-rated scenes of nude girls dancing -- following a brief and sleazy introduction by Shelley Michelle. In fact, I don't care a lot about Shelley, but I particularly like a girl (the shorter one) in the double shower scene of chapter 2. Unfortunately I can't find out what her name is. The Internet Movie Database doesn't provide any info on the cast and crew. Of course Shelley Michelle, who got credited (on the DVD) as writer and producer of this series, is pretty famous for having body-doubled Julia Roberts, Kim Basinger, Barbra Streisand etc..., and got interviewed on such TV shows as ""Hard Copy"", ""Inside Movies""..., but is that the reason for all the other girls to have to go incognito?",1043280000,4,1180,4.875621890547263
