8581899,5,B00CHXVJJY,"I knew what I was getting. Still, seeing how wonderful the remaster of this single episode looks on Blu-ray, makes one heartsick for more episodes. There are separate releases for Seasons One & Two, respectively, but both are CONFIRMED Region B ONLY. They will not play in North America, unless you have an All-Region Player. The only All-Region Set currently available, is the Japanese set, which can be played anywhere, but is out-of-print and currently going for around $400 on eBay. Which is ridiculous.

This episode is a good one, though. And well worth the $11 I paid for it. This 1974 episode from Season 4 of the original run of the show, concerns a militant head master type at a prestigious boys military academy, who murders a former cadet (now grown,) because said cadet now has control of the school and intends to take the financially strapped organization into the black by making the place co-ed. Which doesn't sit well with Patrick McGoohan's highly militant Commandant.

Missed will be the wonderful Columbo music, which here has been replaced by nothing more than a few military marches. And keep in mind, almost the entire episode takes place at the Academy, so you won't see much of 1974 Los Angeles. However, this is one of the better episodes, and profoundly interesting given how realistically it comes off.

But not to worry: Falk is in fine, legendary form here. And he carries the episode by playing his character as though he's nothing more than a supporting role, as usual. Classic stuff.

The disc picture and sound are very well remastered, given the era this show aired on Television. And there are two minor extras: the NBC opening montage for the NBC Mystery Movie, and a 6minute montage of behind the scenes stills. Which is really more fascinating than I expected.

Columbo fans can't go wrong here. If you cannot afford the aforementioned Japanese blu-ray set, this single episode is the only Region A disc out there. And I highly recommend it.",1525046400,,1982,4.834808259587021
8581900,4,B00CHXVJJY,"Good BD copy of a good Columbo episode.  German and English sound tracks as well as subtitles.  Picture quality is very good, the color is not artificially boosted as in some of the DVDs.  Too bad it is the only BD Columbo available besides the Japanese Box Set of the complete episodes.
I wish they would release a US set of BDs as I Iove Falk/Columbo.  Still one of the best detective shows ever made.",1386288000,4,403,4.333333333333333
