8436142,5,B004MNKP5G,Her technique was unique. She explained her thinking in every brush stroke which was easy to understand. I had fun trying this method -not a lot of preplanning. I love the loose style. It taught me more about my paints and good color combinations.,1365465600,7,247,4.636363636363637

From Barbara Nechis:

""Here is the DVD that captures how I paint in as much detail and intimacy as if I were standing before you and painting.  In it I demonstrate both a layered landscape and a wet-in-wet floral completed with glazing.

Three days of filming in CCP's state of the art studio and months of editing were well worth the wait.  The process itself fascinated me.  During filming one camera was focused on my brush and painting, another on my palette, and another on me so that all could be put together seamlessly.""",1297123200,11,764,4.622222222222222
