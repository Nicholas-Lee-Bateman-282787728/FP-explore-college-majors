4294970,5,B0049TC8EO,"This review is for the anime itself as i actually own the full box set.  I really enjoyed this one and i would put it in my top 10.  Lots of action, good plot, voice overs are good.  All around enjoyable and highly recommended.",1349568000,,227,4.113636363636363
4294971,4,B0049TC8EO,"The video was as good as I had hoped. Speed of delivery was excellent. Not pleased the English closed caption text does not match the spoken word, especially when strong profanity is spoken. Text should always match the spoken word. Packaging should better warn potential viewers/buyers of graphic language and some nudity. Didn't bother me, but some parent my flip out. Perhaps this is expected with adult swim type anime.",1327708800,2,423,5.057142857142857
4294972,4,B0049TC8EO,"This series was another one I enjoyed but I had trouble watching at first. It's a bit slow to start out but does tend to pick up a bit toward the end. The two main characters are fairly well developed but their relationship might cause some people some problems. Oh, and there are some scenes that might be a bit too graphic for some people. I thought the main villians and his henchman even had interesting situations and how they came out was interesting. And the lady cop! Oh, boy. The only reason I didn't give five stars was that it took forever to get going.",1326412800,,564,4.330188679245283
4294973,5,B0049TC8EO,"I just recieved this boxed set today.  I had seen this anime previously via Netflix Instant Streaming and fell in love with it.  Its certainlay not a show for children.  Viewer discretion is advised.  This anime contains sex, violence, BDSM, and more violence.  Its about a photagrapher named Tatsumi Saiga who was previously a war photographer.  Now works as a tabloid photographer.  He infiltrates a secret club for the ultra rich and beautiful.  If you have the yen, you can make any and every fetish of yours a reality.  He spots a young 15 year old girl that is being forced to use her ""talents"" in order to entertain the club members.  Saiga decides to rescue the girl from the club and set her free.  Its an emotional joy-ride.  There are comedic moments, heart-breaking moments, and everything in between.  I recommend this series to anyone, especially if your an anime fan. Even if you're not an anime fan, give this series a go.  Not all anime are meant for Children.  This isn't a cartoon.

The packaging is different from the original boxed set release of Speed Grapher from Funimation Entertainment.  Its a single plastic DVD case containging 4 discs, 6 episodes per disc.  Special features include textless opening and closing with music and trailers showcasing other Funimation titles.  Don't be decieved by the specifications on this site.  No audio commentary available.  The audio features 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, regular Dolby Digital Sound quality English track, and Original Japanese language track.",1310428800,25,1530,5.01593625498008

I do not own this set. I own the first box set that came with six disc and a lot of extras! If u can get that one!
This is an amazing show! I'm more into the adult anime, not hentai but the ones where u have to think and there's very little comedy. So if you are like me then you will enjoy speed grapher too! There's so much I want to say about this show but I feel like I would give things away if I did. I will say I did end up caring for the ""bad"" guys at the end. Some anime shows endings suck and just end with out finishing some plots. This show has a good ending.",1306195200,7,598,3.643410852713178
4294995,5,B0049TC8EO,"When I first started up the show, I was skeptical. It made me expect something like a gore and sex fest, but it definitely didn't turn out like that at all. I actually found myself enjoying the idea and story of Speed Grapher!

The artwork and animation is modest; then again it was made in '05. The story is a little bit repetitive but it is filled with  twists and turns and events that were completely not what I expected. Speed Grapher is definitely one of the better psychological, action animes. I recommend it!",1441843200,,517,4.48936170212766

4295000,5,B0049TC8EO,"i got this lovely DVD set as my friend recommended me this show , as he told me that the english dub is well worth it and it damn sure did

this show starts out with  a hard working war photographer named saiga  as he is on the battlefield  trying to capture the situations around him till he encountered a rebel and as he was about to shoot at saiga  he pulled his cam to take a shoot and in an amazing clip in this episode solders behind him started shooting at the rebel and saiga captured every moment  of when man got shot is its like the camera shoot bullets ( NOW THAT's INNOVATIVE!!!!!!! ) .

then we move forward in modern time Tokyo as saiga appears to work as a newspaper photographer who likes to handle controversial  and complicated scoops for the publication .

so one day he decided to dive into some secret cult and there club of elites ( delusional hipsters  & idiots  ) that the wealthy and prime political candidates join and do there .... ... UM??? .. .. practices i should kindly say .

on that night when saiga putting his life on the line to figure out the fuss about this club is the knight that changed his life as he is now going to protect the goddess that changed him in order to escape the boring and harsh life as being used under Suitengu as the club ( main feature  ) to reward special members to be gifted by the goddess to unlock there deepest desire  and have supernatural powers .

now the poor ( adorable and innocent ) goddess in kagura part of a super wealthy family as seen by her mothers property skyscraper and influence to the whole city , for a beautiful girly girl she's not enjoying her life mostly of her brutal mother , and she will plea for saiga to take her away from this boring life full of madness ( the poor thing ...).

well this show defiantly has a splendid cast of characters one of them is the enigmatic ( as well as crazy)  Ginza as an undercover cop that likes to do things her way and she is all over saiga and she has a thing for him .

this show has quite ALOT!!!!! of mature adult content and themes all around so please be careful , and on that note this show is really good and deserves the time  to watch . as it has quite alot of surprises .

for a 2005 show i think its still very good to watch and the english dub is really good also",1425340800,2,2305,4.114093959731544

The main attraction for this show is it villain, u suppose to hate the villain, cause that what their job description is, but u never know what make them what they are, this show explain that.
my recommendation is check this show out, it self worthy",1387411200,4,823,4.483221476510067

4295012,5,B0049TC8EO,"I'd only before seen scattered episodes of this series on TV and it made little sense. Now seeing the entire group I found it an intriguing, surreal drama.  There was a surprising depth to the characters with backgrounds shown in flashback to explain who and why and how some of the characters related to each other in ways even they weren't aware.  I'd love to see this as a prime time live action miniseries...if any network would dare. Perhaps cable?",1382572800,,453,4.65
4295013,5,B0049TC8EO,"My gf loves anime way more than me and wanted to watch this with me one day. I knew nothing about it, but to make her happy, I watched it with her. I am very picky about the anime I watch and like, I only like a handful of anime. I was hooked within the first 2 episodes! This is such a great show, I had to get it! More for the adult and mature crowd. Speed Grapher is intended to only be 1 season long, which can be good sometimes, even though you want more, it's good to know when to end it.

Speed Grapher is about a former war photographer named Saiga who stumbles on a hidden, underground club during an investigation that is exclusively only for the most rich and powerful. This club, which is run by Suitengu, the main anti hero in this anime, pratices bizarre rituals that worship a 15 year old Goddess named Kagura. Kagura does not realise what goes on in this fetish club as it is a blur of a dream to her. During these rituals, in a hypnotize state, the Goddess kisses the chosen subject thus releasing their inner most desire. Saiga just so happens, crashes this ritual at the right time and during a scuffle, he finds himself in front of the Goddess and she gives him a kiss granting his inner most desire. Turns out his desire is to destroy anything he photographs. Saiga attempts to free Kagura as she awakens during the ritual confused and frightened. The two escape and it turns into a cat and mouse game between Saiga and Kagura and Suitengu and his club. The rituals have been going on for a while, thus many members have had their most secret desires come true, making quite a few interesting villians! Some such as a man who can stretch beyond human anatomy, a man whos tattoos come to life, a woman whos love for diamonds turns her into a moving mannequinn that is pure diamond and has claws that are just as sharp, and so on. Another thing why I like this anime so much is the way it ends, I won't say anything in order to not spoil anything, but trust me, this is an anime worth watching!",1373068800,2,2013,4.2558746736292425
4295014,5,B0049TC8EO,"This is a pretty unique anime. I can't think of anything to compare it to. That being said, I really liked it. The only complaint is that it isn't longer. I wasn't sure what to expect from the S.A.V.E. edition, but it's all here, just no extras, and being that it's only a fraction of the price of the other editions, it's an acceptable trade-off.

4295035,4,B0049TC8EO,I was curious when reading the description of this series and so I thought I'd give it a go. It's definitely an interesting show and it's worth watching.

4295036,5,B0049TC8EO,"Full, review courtesy through Book & Movie Dimension a Blog

Speed Grapher is another anime series that has a grittier and dark tone. It's not in anyway awful but definitely delves into the doors of the human soul that are by far the worst. In it all, there is sometimes things to still look forward to.

The main characters Saiga and Kagura are just awesome. Saiga is a grown man that is instantly drawn to Kagura a young teen girl. Saiga realizes their obvious age differences, so always responds if someone mentions there relationship by saying ""it not like that"" or by totally ignoring the question. Seeming extremely hilarious. Kagura is the heir to a rich empire thanks to her mother. It is slowly shown Kagura is no regular adolescent girl but possesses powers of turning regular humans into Euphorias (people with supernatural powers connected to their innermost desires) through an exchange of her bodily fluids with anyone. She's a type of catalyst for a chemical reaction. Saiga notices that Kagura in a semi-hypnoticed state is led to kiss privileged members of this secret society so as to turn them into Euphorics. Saiga being a photographer has become enamored by his latest subject Kagura. He helps her escape from the constraining secret twisted society but not without consequences. The man behind the organization named Suitengu that tries to get Kagura to gift people with powers wants her back and pulls all the stops to get her back. Kagura's mother is a huge crime queen that despises her daughter because of her great looks believing hers are fading. This is an interesting aspect of the anime later explained. Kagura on the other hand finds her cruelty mean and can't understand it because of being naive. She is on many occasions abused by her mother. In a teacher, she finds help but you wouldn't believe what her mother does to convince her teacher that at home no abuse is going on. The moment while totally disturbing is also hilarious.

Moving at a real swift pace throughout the anime there are types of equally cool and disgusting characters introduced. You'll become obsessed with the characters. As Saiga tries to keep Kagura from the evil organization led by Suitengu who has his own devious agenda he wants to further along. Leading watchers on a hugely entertaining  road of action and danger. Ending with a surprisingly, yet satisfying conclusion.

For anime fans interested in the artwork aspect of it then it has an unusual style of a animation. It's most assuredly anime but looks like comics-American-style. It's nice to look at and again found very lovely. The use of characters shows very original ones too. There are various weird characters mentioned that are rather disgusting yet impressive to see. The artwork scope of it is definitely something to look at!

Speed Grapher is a highly recommended anime series. Just from its artwork its a worthwhile watch along with becoming immersed in some vastly fascinating characters. While this anime is wholly intense in the world it creates, its on the whole addicting.

4295037,5,B0049TC8EO,I love this series! It arrived in decent time and is perfect for watching. Can't wait to show it to others!,1363392000,,107,4.142857142857143
4295038,5,B0049TC8EO,"Firstly a small review on the anime itself (but I assume you've watched it if you are buying the entire set!)
Fantastic story line, with a lot of interesting concepts.  This is definitely for a MATURE audience as issues of sex, nudity, violence, crime and drugs is heavy in this anime.  Our protagonist (a photographer!) rescues a young girl from an elite underground ""fantasy club"" where members are allowed to live out their every fantasy (for a price!).  He gets in deeper than he ever expected and not only has to keep the girl away from their greedy hands and fight off people with some crazy powers, but also figure out the root of the whole mess and shut it down.  (Not going that much further into it since spoilers ruin things.)

Now then, for the SAVE edition of this anime.  If you are looking for a cheap way to pick up anime this is it.  It's pretty bare bones, DvD case & your disk with no real extras.  If you expect a lot of packaging, this is not for you.  The SAVE Speed Grapher contains the entire set, as a much lower price even compared to buying similar box sets of this same anime used.  There have been no issues with any of the disk, and plays awesomely.  I guess the lime green spine of the disk case might annoy some collectors, but really who cares about the packaging if you are just after the anime itself (through legal means!)

**EDIT TO THE ABOVE**
The Lime Green SAVE cover is 100% reversible, and now looks beautiful in my collection.  It never really annoyed me, personally, as I was more interested in the quality of the video, but I'm very pleased about the forethought SAVE had in making their DVD covers reversible.  Can I please up that rating to 6 stars? LOL

The disk feature both English & Japanese audio (and subtitles) which is also another great deal on this price, as well as opening/closing animations without text.",1356566400,,1864,4.4733727810650885

4295040,4,B0049TC8EO,"This anime has a very ""Eyes Wide Shut"" type of vibe to it. It's about a photographer that stumbles into a decadent club for super rich people. He, by accident is involved in a ritual and gains the power to blow up anything he takes a snapshot of. While escaping he saves a young girl who is being used to fulfill the perverted rich folks fantasies. They want her back. The 2 are on the run from the mafia that controls the club, and fight for their survival.

This anime is very interesting. It has a unique story and some pretty cool characters.  The production quality is pretty good as well. This anime definitely stands out. It's worth watching and is a great price in this S.A.V.E. collection.",1350604800,,698,4.4453125

Story can feel a bit slow sometimes, but it is worth it in the long run because it really fills in all the information you need. Be advised, there are some very R rated scenes, some are borderline PG13, but I wouldn't recommend to anyone with certain triggers from violence, rape, and sexual encounters. Otherwise 10/10 even though amazon is only 5/5, and a must watch list for you.
