8325807,5,B000VI6N8Y,"Schooled is a limited edition DVD featuring The All-American Rejects. The TV special originally aired Sunday, August 5, 2007 on the CW Network. Issued by Office Max, this DVD features a live concert performance for students at New Milford High School in New Milford, New Jersey after a destructive flood.

The students are led to believe by their school's faculty that their music department will be abolished if they do not pass a series of increasingly twisted, state-mandated tests. After an embarrassing school band/choir competition against professional bands and choirs (disguised as other schools), they discover they are in for the treat of their lives: a surprise concert by the All-American Rejects.

Emotional and amazing, a must for any long time All-American Rejects fan or even if you're just discovering the band.",1331251200,,828,5.265151515151516
