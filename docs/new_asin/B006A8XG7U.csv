One of those movies you saw as a young adult which made a deep impression on you, stands up very well when viewed now.  Exquisitely photographed on location in Manhattan with hauntingly designed interiors; beautifully acted by Carroll Baker and Ralph Meeker, under the sensitive direction of Jack Garfein, this is an opportunity to own a very unique classic of American cinema.",1348272000,2,535,5.137931034482759

We remembered the plot but didn't know the name or stars of the movie.  We both have been looking for this movie.  My sister finally found about the movie and gave it to me for my 60th birthday.

4981317,5,B006A8XG7U,"One of the most aggressively strange films I've ever seen, and at the same time also one of the most understated. It's a film where events, even the most horrific and strange, simply happen, and the audience is left to interpret quite a bit. Also one of the few films where its long periods of silence are ruled by the actors and are not purely director-driven. The acting is some of the most piercing and amazing; every line, every look loaded.

At face value, this film is somewhat ""culturally questionable"" and ""problematic"", but the more I thought about it, the more, really, it just WASN'T-- what it is is complex and weird and often inexplicable-- just like the actions of real people. Strange to see the cinematographer of Metropolis work so well with this obviously actors-studio inspired film. The film's subtext, and the film is entirely subtext, somehow increases the tension tenfold; there were several times it took me twenty minutes to go ""OH that is what this character meant in that scene before"", and not in a NOW A BIG REVELATION kind of way, but in a quiet epiphany, and that's one of this film's main strengths.

Evidently Aaron Copland, on his 80th birthday, when New York was doing some kind of big celebration in his honour, he was asked what piece of his he would like to have performed-- his request was for a screening of Something Wild, and HOT DAMN he did a great job with the score here. This film also has, by far, my favourite Saul Bass opening.",1339632000,32,1476,4.608365019011407
4981318,5,B006A8XG7U,"I saw this movie many years ago, and fell in love with Ralph Meeker. He is at his most romantic, and does a very convincing drunk scene.  He  takes Carroll Baker in(who moves from her parents house when she is assaulted by a stranger),but won't let her leave.  he wants her to fall in love with him. There are no car chases, or exciting happenings, but I love the story, and had tried to order this movie several times before. Jean Stapleton (All in the Family) and Doris Roberts(everybody loves Raymond) have small parts in this movie. And there are some very good street scenes of New York.",1327276800,24,592,4.462962962962963

What a ridiculous ending!  It was a cheap movie to make, obviously, but the story just gave out and there was no way that this movie should be given anymore than ONE star....if that!.

4981323,4,B006A8XG7U,"""Something Wild"" was a film which Director Jack Garfein and his then wife Carroll Baker elected to put together in order to present Baker as a serious actress.  She'd had some good roles since her debut as ""Baby Doll"" in 1956 but nothing which elevated her the way they thought she should be.  During production of the film, Baker enjoyed a Life Magazine cover story and spread about the making of the film.  So in spite of it ending up as a rather murky, rambling melodrama, it did start with the best of intentions and some decent promotion.

Some things about the film are striking.  The cinematography, the on location filming in New York, nearly all of the supporting actors' performances (Mildred Dunnock as Baker's mother and Jean Stapleton and Doris Roberts in two very key small parts), and most of all, the amazing atonal Aaron Copland score.  Copland's score was eventually transformed into a piece called ""Music for a Great City"" but it remained unavailable as originally written and scored for the film ""Wild"" until it was released several years ago, dubbed (most excellently) from an LP which was in Jack Garfein's collection, recorded at the time of the film but ultimately unreleased because of the film's box office failure.

The film itself is a kind of paradox.  The opening rape scene is - like rape must be - jarring, seemingly out of context with what has gone seconds before, and absolutely terrifying.  The long, slow aftermath where Baker's character finds her way home, washes herself, destroys her clothing and then begins her slow descent into isolation and depression, is haunting.  She eventually leaves home (runs away, really) surfacing as a clerk in a five and ten cent store, rents a small one room apartment in a squalid section of NYC, and tries to spend her days avoiding contact of any kind with anyone.  Eventually, her attempted suicide on a bridge is interrupted by Meeker, a mechanic who seems as lonely and disaffected as she is but who offers her what appears to be at the time a temporary solace and refuge in his apartment.

It is then that the film kind of dissolves into a meandering melodrama.  It's never really clear what Meeker wants to do for Baker, and she's truly so unpleasant to him that you kind of wonder what he sees in her.  Meeker, a fine actor, who should have had a much more important career, is well suited to his part and has enough menace in his delivery that he fills the bill nicely.  Baker, with her stilted voice and delivery (""actresssy"" is the word which most comes to mind) in my opinion doesn't really have the chops to make her character sympathetic, in spite of the fact that she's a rape victim and (ultimately) a hostage.

There are a few memorable scenes, including a nightmare sequence that is evocative and thrilling in a scary way.  The ultimate denouement (which too many reviewers have already given away) seems out of place and too much, too soon.

I had the pleasure of seeing the film a few years ago at an event in Los Angeles held at the time Garfein was promoting his book about acting on one of his rare trips to the US from his home in France.  He was engaging and talkative, and took many questions from the audience about the film prior to the screening.  One anecdote he repeated which I recall is that a friend or colleague asked him, about ""Something Wild"" as well as the only other (earlier, I think) film he directed ""The Strange One,"" ""When are you going to stop making films about the Holocaust?""  (Garfein was a Holocaust survivor who spent time in a concentration camp as a youth with members of his family.)  He also responded affirmatively to one person in the audience who commented that his was a ""Beauty and the Beast story,"" indicating that did seem to be one of the film's themes.

Also present at the screening was Salome Jens, an actress and performer still active today who told me that she had once been married to Ralph Meeker.  I was surprised as I'd never known that.  I took the opportunity to ask the gracious Ms. Jens if it was true that Meeker had turned down the opportunity to play the role of Hal in ""Picnic"" which he had originated on Broadway, because he didn't want to enter into a long term contract with the studio.  This story is often told, most notably on TCM, whenever they screen ""Picnic,"" indicating that his refusal led to William Holden's playing of the part, when Holden was really too old and lacked the requisite underlying menace which the character of Hal requires (and which Meeker displays so well in ""Wild"" as well as some of his other films such as ""Kiss Me Deadly"").  Generally, Robert Osborne will refer to this apocryphal story as ""one of the worst career decisions in Hollywood history.""  Ms. Jens assured me the story was not true, that he had never been offered the part of Hal in the film.  This seems to ring true, as Holden was a bankable star at the time and likely under contract to the studio at the time which made ""Picnic,"" Columbia, or at least easier to get as a loan-out.

So a problematic film, a difficult film, one which you really have to watch to know if it was worth seeing.  I think this is the reason there are great reviews and just as many negative reviews of the film.  Still, the film offers some fine acting, especially by the supporting cast and it is certainly worth seeking out if only for the fantastic cinematography and musical score.",1469577600,29,5418,4.5939771547248185

4981331,3,B006A8XG7U,"""Something Wild"" is memorable; it's a film that could have been great.  Directed by Jack Garfein, who at the time was married to the film's female lead, Carroll Baker, ""Something Wild"" is nearly as odd as Baker's other notable picture, ""Baby Doll"".

Garfein has to be given credit for some innovative and effective work (in partnership with the great cinematographer Eugen Shuftan).  The initial scene in which Baker is assaulted is chillingly done, and there are some great compositional shots of New York City.  Shuftan seems to have consciously copied the ""neo-realist"" style of European cinema, which led Otto Preminger to quip that he ""should have put it in the theaters with (accompanying) subtitles.""  Composer Aaron Copland contributed a very good film score.

The film starts coming unglued when Baker's character, completely unhinged by her initial assault, is then victimized a second time by a male loner played by Ralph Meeker, who essentially kidnaps her.  ( Yes, this is a theme that surfaced again in a couple years in Britain with Terrance Stamp and ""The Collector"".)  When Meeker confines Baker to his basement dive,  the movie becomes stilted, like an exercise in method acting.  This is not a fairy tale of confinement, like ""Beauty and the Beast"".  Meeker's character is a frighteningly brutish drunk, who ignores Baker's repeated pleas to be freed.  So, he has committed a criminal act and compounded her victimization.

It could be said that the ending (spoiler alert), where Baker's twice-victimized character takes pity on Meeker, is unconventional and defies political correctness.  But it really defies logic, too.  In light of modern horror stories such as what happened in Cleveland a few years ago, most female viewers are going to find this plot twist (with Baker's coy smile when her mother arrives signifying an odd sort of ""maturing process"") very disturbing and repugnant.  At the very least, it is unconvincing.  Real life victims do not magically lose their psychological scarring by embracing their victimizers.

The performance is probably the best of Baker's career, which never really soared in the years to come.  I was surprised to learn that she was still acting in films decades later.  Ralph Meeker doesn't fare as well, giving a mediocre portrayal.  This is really a movie that strains too hard to be different.

Oddly, it shares the same title with a later movie starring Melanie Griffith.  That 1986 film has been accepted as a classic.",1447632000,4,2485,5.096534653465347
4981332,1,B006A8XG7U,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Most of my memories of visiting NYC was the deafening 24/7 cacophony of traffic, sirens, enhanced acoustics from cramped quarters, voices, screams, you name it, drove me insane at times.

So when Baker is on the street with Mike the Mechanic who lures her to his basement dungeon, I was so shocked to hear complete peace and quiet. Did he install insulation on the walls, egg cartons, white noise machines....more surprised with this effect than the actual rape. What beautiful girl, even this day, even any age has not been subjected to incessant sexual abuse, pretty much ho-hum unless of course you are a child, maimed or murdered.

I found the pacing way to slow to maintain much interest. I was hoping Carroll would find a more redeeming vehicle to showcase her talents beyond ""BabyDoll"" and was very disappointed in this film.

High recommend to see Carroll get her due after ""Babydoll"", for you sickos out there.",1447632000,,961,4.841463414634147

It was almost as if the director wanted the film to really make an impact, but missed the mark.

Baker gives a wonderful performance, but the director belabored the film with unusual cinematography  and obvious symbolism.

4981356,5,B006A8XG7U,"I remember reading about the 1961 film ""Something Wild"" years ago, but only recently learned it was released on dvd
in 2011 by MGM's limited-edtion collection division. I've had the fine Aaron Copland cd soundtrack for years that was
released on Varese Sarabande in 2003, but always wanted to see the film.  A stark, grim, and poignant examination of
a young girl's (Carroll Baker) experience with violence and despair in New York City, ""Something Wild"" is based on the
Alex Karmel novella ""Mary Anne"" and was directed by Baker's then-husband Jack Garfein. It was filmed in black & white
entirely on location in New York City. The dominating themes in the film are human loneliness & hopelessness. Baker is
marvelous in the role of ""Mary Ann"", a young Brooklyn college student who is brutally raped in a park early in the story
and is unable to deal with the harrowing trauma from it. Mary is about to commit suicide on a bridge when a mechanic
(Ralph Meeker as ""Mike"") saves her at the last second. His own life is bleak and empty, as well. He invites her to come
with him back to his drab apartment to rest and sleep for the night, but decides to keep her captive as she ""is his last
chance"" at finding love. After he comes home drunk one night, he physically comes on to her, and she kicks him in the
face causing the loss of one eye. In their strange relationship, there is not alot of dialogue between them. It was this
particular aspect of the picture that really appealed to composer Copland, as it opened up many avenues for him in his
expressive & dramatic writing. Aaron said, ""The lengthy stretches of silent action invite musical comment in a way that
imbues the whole film with a certain musical 'tone'. It goes, without saying, that one must have an absolute free hand
in these matters and this was assured me by Jack Garfein and George Justin, respectively the director and producer of
the film."" A brilliant composer for contemporary urban settings, Copland's score for ""Something Wild"" would be adapted
later for his piece, ""Music For A Great City"". On first viewing, one is truly guessing trying to see where the film's story
is headed, as it seems there is absolutely no chance for ANY type of normal relationship between the two characters.
Heartbreaking and unforgettable, ""Something Wild"" is a stunning, emotionally charged film that was called a ""lost indie
classic"" when it was screened at the New York IFC Center in 2007. The on-location NYC shooting that Garfein used in
the picture, particularly the night downtown scenes, reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's NYC scenes in his 1955 film-noir
classic , ""Killer's Kiss"". The brilliant German director of photography on ""Something Wild"", Eugen Schufftan, would go on
one year later in 1962 to win an Academy Award for his work on ""The Hustler"". The opening titles in the film, matched
with the NYC skyline, were done by the legendary Saul Bass with remarkable effect. ""Something Wild"" was truly a labor
of love for Jack Garfein & Carroll Baker -- both paid their own $ to get it completed. When United Artists subsequently
demanded payment for IOU's on postproduction costs and refused to pay for Copland's scoring fee, Baker completed a
deal with UA, as she & Jack had exhausted their funds, to ""pay"" them by doing another picture which would be ""Mister
Moses"". $ debt on ""Something Wild"" would then be deducted from her ""Moses"" fee. ""Something Wild"" would be Garfein's
last film, though. A timeless statement about the human condition in the urban jungle, it was controversial when it was
released in 1961, as it dealt with a brutal rape and contained brief nudity. Powerful and direct, ""Something Wild"" would
also be Aaron Copland's final film score. Kudos to MGM for getting this work finally released on dvd (in full-frame, with
no special features or trailer).",1392422400,24,3837,4.778614457831325

4981359,5,B006A8XG7U,"Review from Stephanie Piro's cartoon Blog:[...]
I saw a lot of things as a kid. And 3 of them stayed with me all these years because they have become sort of ""lost"" films. ""Home Sweet Homicide"", "" The Green Eyed Blonde"",  and ""Something Wild"" starring Carroll Baker and Ralph Meeker! I couldn't believe that this movie is NOW available on DVD and got it for Christmas! It is even more dark and stylish and disturbing and avant-garde and fabulous than I remembered.
Carroll Baker is a teenage girl who one day, says goodbye to her friends and takes the subway home where she has to walk through a park. She is lovely and happy and skips across the street and then...someone grabs her and rapes her in the bushes. Horrifying! The rest of the film deals with how she survives this and her reactions which include possibly throwing herself off a bridge and into the river... something she is about to do, when someone grabs her and saves her. A garage mechanic happening by on a break. Ralph Meeker (I love him in this!!!) plays this role oddly sympathetically and you will have to see this amazing film for yourself to find out what happens between these two.
The score is by Aaron Copland and the titles are by the best title designer of that or any era, Saul Bass. The movie is filmed in New York and forever captures that lost world of seedy apartments, old Woolworths and the people that inhabited the city at that time. When I ordered this from Amazon I couldn't believe all the comments by people who'd remembered this movie the way I did! It shows you what an impact this powerful film had on us back then!",1390348800,2,1610,4.476190476190476

4981362,5,B006A8XG7U,"I saw this film years ago as a young woman, and it has stayed with me for decades.  This film adaptation of Alex Karmel's novel ""Maryann"" is faithful and thoughtful.  This is one of those films that you need to watch without any preconceptions, without any biases about Carroll Baker or Ralph Meeker, an actor whose career was hobbled by bad advice and unfortunate timing.  The film is brilliant, but it is not for the faint of heart or those whose sensibilities are easily offended.  I'm so pleased the tangle that kept it from becoming available on DVD has been resolved so that thoughtful audiences can watch and appreciate a largely forgotten but disturbing and compelling film.",1380240000,10,682,4.803418803418803

8495669,5,B006A8XG7U,"I really like this film and added it to my Facebook page. I am intrigued by black and white films. Sometimes, depending on the director, it feels like you are in the room with the people and that you are watching what they are doing by the way it was shot. Meaning, that with this film it is very intimate without feeling like it is a broadway show or play somewhere. It is intriguing, emotional and sad but interesting. They just don't film movies like this any more which is too bad as I like CGI except when it looks fake, which it does a lot. This film captures the emotions of the situation due to the acting which is spot on. Also what the male protagonist does is unexpected. But then, what would you do if you knew someone was going to kill themselves when they left your place? Yes, call for help, but there is more to the story and it is a twisty emotional one.",1520035200,,871,4.190476190476191

8495671,4,B006A8XG7U,"Carroll Baker plays a happy-go-lucky college student. We see her when the film starts dancing along the street without any cares, enjoying life. True, she has a mother who is very self-centered, who ignores others to an extent and always focuses on herself. This is somewhat annoying and stifling, yet it is clear that she loves Carroll.
Then, Carroll is pulled off the street and raped. She tells no one. She cuts up the dress she wore during the rape. She wants to forget. But she can't. She now is afraid to be touched. When she tries to return to college on a subway, she is pushed and shoved, as happens in New York. This is just what she cannot stand. She is also unable to stand the clinging of her mother to her.
Unreasonably, she runs away. She takes a cheap apartment. She wonders around town and without thinking, unable to bear her pain, unable to interact with others, she almost jumps to her death. She is saved by Ralph Meeker who has his own problems. He is a fall-down and break-furniture drunk. In contrast to Carroll, he needs sex, but doesn't seem to know how to get it. He imprisons Carroll hoping she will like him.
As long as she feels imprisoned, held like the rapist held her, she is unable to respond. But then, frustrated, he lets her go. This freedom, perhaps because it is so startling to her even as the rape was, is enough to remove her fears.",1509494400,,1374,4.434782608695652

8495673,3,B006A8XG7U,"Possible spoilers.  First of all let me state that this film has nothing to do with the 1986 film with the same title.  That film is a comedy starring Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith.  This film by director and writer Jack Garfein is about as far removed from comedy as you can get.  It is about rape and the aftereffects on the victim.  In 2016 there was a film called Elle which garnered an Oscar nod for Isabelle Huppert.  In that movie her character is brutally raped in an early scene.  Afterwards, she somewhat stoically takes a shower, and trashes the clothes she was wearing.  She then goes about her life without telling anyone.

In this film Carroll Baker (Harlow), who was married to Garfein at the time, plays Mary Ann Robinson, a college student in New York City.  On her way home, she is pulled into the bushes and raped by an unknown assailant.  After gathering herself, she walks the rest of the way, quietly enters her parents house and goes to her room.  She then takes a long bath, grabs a pair of scissors and cuts up her clothing in small enough pieces to flush them down the toilet.  Stunning similarities for 2 movies made in different countries, 55 years apart.

But this review is about Mary Ann.  She becomes unusually quiet and reserved, avoiding even being touched by her parents.  Her mother (Mildred Dunnock) is a bit of a hoverer and wants to be overly involved in what her daughter is up to.  It quickly becomes clear that Mary Ann doesnt want to be questioned about the changes in her demeanor.  Baker, in fact will take her character down a path of several personality changes.

Mary Ann decides she is going to stay in the city and rents a one room apartment in a seedy part of town.  It is one of those places that comes with a bare lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, a small sink and a bed.  The bathroom is down the hall and shared with the other tenants.  One of which is Shirley Johnson (Jean Stapleton from TVs All in the Family).  Mary Ann then decides to get a job as a clerk at Woolworths 5 & 10.  In her constant daze, she walks around the city and finds her way on to a deserted bridge where she comes close to jumping from.  She is suddenly pulled down by an auto mechanic named Mike (Ralph Meeker, Kiss Me Deadly).

At first, Mary Ann is leery, but finally agrees to let him walk her home.  Shes surprised to find out, it is his home.  Still shes tired, hungry and agrees to go with him inside, leaving her while he goes to work.  Mikes apartment is a slightly bigger and better version of Mary Anns.  The light bulb has a shadeand there are 2.  There is actually a kitchen with a sink, a stove and a refrigerator.  It also appears it has its own bathroom.  The windows are barred, similar to a jail adding to the prison atmosphere clearly implied.

After treating Mary Ann with kid gloves, Mike says hes going out for a while.  She agrees to stay.  In the middle of the night Mike returns, so drunk he can barely walk.  But not so drunk he doesnt try to get closer with Mary Ann.  She retaliates, kicking him in the face.  When she tries to leave, she finds herself locked in.  In fact, she becomes a captive.

The film is flush with contradictions, perhaps suggesting the social element clearly missing from each of their lives.  The potential for escape seems obvious enough for the viewers but for some reason isn't for Mary Ann.  After several days of confinement, Mary Ann finds the door has been left open.  She leaves but rather than going to the police  who seem to be on every corner  she walks about the parks taking in the natural surroundings and enjoying freedom.  The final act involves more interaction between Mary Ann and Mike.  Thanks to a letter Mary Ann sent to her mother, there is another telling confrontation between mother and daughter.

The film has minimal dialog which is certainly the intent.  The story is told by the two main characters with their actions, behavior and gestures more than with words.  These are damaged individuals who somewhat inexplicably come together.  While the film is important from a historical perspective as to how to tell a story and has some fine performances, it is also tedious and hard to fathom even in 1961.",1499731200,2,4224,4.4692005242463955
8495674,5,B006A8XG7U,"What a tragic way to find a measure of stability and relative emotional comfort. I sympathized with the female character from the very beginning and worried about her situation throughout her quest to keep her sanity and safety while pursuing some degree of happiness in her life.  What she attained was probably far short of what she saw for herself at the beginning of the story, but the realism of her quest gives this story its legs, legs made of concrete. Her problems resulting from the rape and the choices she made and her attempt to hold on to normalcy in her life despite what happened to her, makes this one of the cinematic unsung heroes, a great movie for all genders to watch and discuss, because, in a simple, understated way, Something Wild, lays out fantastic lessons regarding actions, consequences, and decisions we face.

Film critic Kim Morgan interviews director Jack Garfein about his work with the Actors Studio and making Something Wild. He started off as an actor but was told that hed be better suited as a director. Crushed, he nevertheless took the advice and studied with Lee Strasberg. He worked with then-unknown actors James Dean, Ben Gazzara and others. He was the first director admitted into the Actors Studio and talks about what drew him to Something Wild. He also talks about how the film got made, including the casting and hiring of key crew members.
