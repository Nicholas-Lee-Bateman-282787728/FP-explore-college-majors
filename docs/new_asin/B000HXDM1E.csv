2648970,5,B000HXDM1E,I have been waiting for a long time for this series to come out in DVD format!  I like this show very much.  The writers certainly came up with some great ideas for situations got poor old Victor to get himself into and OUT of!  You will LOVE this show!,1178928000,3,253,4.02

2648973,5,B000HXDM1E,"The character of pessimist Victor Mildrew is hysterical; a show like this could only have come from the UK.

Great acting for all involved too... Richard Wilson & Annette Crosbie (her character deserves a medal) and by many others, including comedian Angus Deayton (some may remember him as the hysterically funny and topical host of the news satire show ""Have I Got News For You?"" in the late '80s).

Previously only available on VHS and audio-tape, this series on DVD is long-awaited!",1174262400,9,486,4.914634146341464

2648989,4,B000HXDM1E,"This is a very funny and well written comedy. It does have some dark moments but the last episode that kills off Victor is absolutely STUPID! There are plenty of better ways to end this series but for some reason, the Brits feel killing off the main character is best... End the series in sadness?? I thought it was a comedy.

Better ending??? Just off the top of my head, I would have had Victor win a big lottery and buy out the controlling rights to the company that terminated him.... He lays off the personal lady from the first episode that informed him that he was replaced by an electronic box. As she is leaving, she mutters ""I can't believe it!""

Oh well, it is what it is and I enjoyed the series.",1488672000,,708,4.276119402985074

2649017,5,B000HXDM1E,"This bizarrely dark comedy follows the misadventures of Victor Meldrew, a working man who suddenly finds himself pushed into early retirement when his job is taken over by a box the size of an adding machine. To an outsider, Victor would appear to be your stereotypical grumpy old man ranting about everything in the world, but what makes him so unique is that his ranting is almost always justified by the fact that he lives in a world where God has clearly chosen to torment him by surrounding him with idiots and the genuinely insane. Also, unlike you usual old man stereotype, Victor actually likes children.

  Accompanying Victor on his journey through the golden years of his life is his wife, Margaret. Outsiders may refer to her as long-suffering, but in her own ways she is just as bad as her husband. She too is prone to long, loud rants (sometimes because of Victor, but not always), and whenever the chance to do the right thing comes along, she almost always defaults to taking the deceitful path.

  One Foot in the Grave is easily one of the darkest sitcoms I have ever seen, and may not be for everyone. The Christmas specials mostly have nothing to do with Christmas, and there are a lot of bottle episodes. It is also unique in that it so frequently jumps from comedy to genuine drama in mere seconds that it could leave you with emotional whiplash. Also, be warned that there is a lot of death in this series; humans and animals tend to drop like flies around the Meldrews, and not many of them are not from natural causes. This is a dark, dark comedy.

  I am quite happy with having purchased this series,  and find it quite worthy to share shelf space with the likes of Fawlty Towers and Black Adder. If you enjoy dark, dry, British humour, you will probably like this too.",1445904000,9,1796,4.53250773993808
2649018,5,B000HXDM1E,I love this series! Watched this as a child on PBS and had to buy for myself when it came up as the deal of the day. This show never fails to make me laugh.,1445817600,,156,3.4857142857142858

2649023,1,B000HXDM1E,"Wish I would have viewed more episodes on Youtube before buying the complete series.  I don't find it funny -- it's stupid and boring.  Same old tired jokes over and over. I forced myself to watch it through series five, hoping that, over time, it would have improved.  Unfortunately not.  Typical British comedy.  I'll donate my set to the nearest nursing home and hope the elderly find it amusing.",1440720000,3,399,4.72463768115942

2649025,5,B000HXDM1E,"One of the funniest BritComs I've ever seen.  PBS has been showing it here in SoFlorida for over a year now.  It's a ""must have"" in my library though.  The writing is excellent.  I find that there will be something said in the first 1-2 minutes of the program that seems very insignificant.  It's not mentioned again but will then appear as the last and biggest laugh at the end.",1438300800,,379,4.357142857142857
2649026,5,B000HXDM1E,"I loved this series. It's a different kind of comedy, one that I appreciate. It's hard for me to say which comedy series is the best, as many want to label their personal favorites. They're different, not the same, each with its own brand of humor. Wouldn't it get boring rather quickly if they were all like Fawlty, or One Foot, or Monk? My favorite writers are the ones that weave many sub-stories into one. I especially liked Monk and Seinfeld for their truly talented writers, and their ability to do this. Also, character casting has to be spot on for me, I have to like the characters and it's much better if you can identify with what they're portraying. Of course many of these stories reflect life because that's where they came from.",1437436800,,743,4.552238805970149

2649049,5,B000HXDM1E,"For those who've never seen any of this show I'll leave you with this:  It is :
Comedy, Drama, Horror, And Mystery - all rolled into one series!  Unlike anything you've ever seen., and those who don't get it, never will!  Victor Meldrew, the Geriatric Cape Crusader... as he's been called, does all of the things to try and right the wrongs of this world, things that too many of us us only dream about (or dare) to put into action!

The man is misunderstood, Victor is NOT the bad guy... he's just trying to live in a world that seems way out of whack .  Early retirement allows too much time on his hands, he begins to see all the world's problems, and decided that he will deal with them himself....no holds bared!!  The acting, script, and production all combines together for a mind blowing look ate the realities of old age and it's problems.  The wacky situations he get's himself and others into are very unique, to say the least. One great example is the episode  ""Hearts of Darkness"" where he  takes revenge on some incompetent cruel sub-humans working at a retirement home.  I've laughed until I fell in the floor with this series, I've also shed a tear or two,. maybe three...  Not your average comedy, expect many sad moments, only to have you laughing your head off soon afterwards.  This series pulls no punches however, at the realities of growing old.  Yet with all it has taught me, it also made me laugh more than any other series I've ever seen!  Check it out!",1417564800,2,1480,4.473880597014926

2649062,5,B000HXDM1E,"Where do I begin?  Okay, I've watched all 6 series over and over and over again.  About every six months I do a complete re-run.  Yes, embarrassing isn't it?  I don't usually watch things over and over, except for one other comedy that cracks me up too, but this one trumps that one even.  I got this set to send to my dad in Europe, but I already own my own set of course.

Freaking hysterical comedy about an older married couple, with Margaret the wife mainly coming off as the sane one, while her husband Victor, forced into early retirement meets with all kinds of misunderstandings and easily makes enemies with his view of life and mishaps that can only happen to him!  You'll laugh your socks off if you're wearing any.  I've seen it several times and can count on tears of laughter every time.  You may have to have a bit of a dry sense of British humor to appreciate it... hey it even comes with a subtitles option if you need it.  My hubby always has me turn that option on as it can be hard to understand I suppose, but not for me since I'm from England.

Anyway, it's family friendly, and super funny, and you actually can see a lot of this happening to someone, which is what makes it so darn funny!",1404604800,,1213,4.253275109170306

Victor Meldrew, brilliantly brought to life by Richard Wilson, is both exasperating and sympathetic, as a man forced to retire and not completely ready to pack it in, he represents the frustration and aggravation we all have to deal with while merely trying make it through an ordinary day! His wife, played wonderfully by Annette Crosbie, is a model of patience, sympathy, and ""I want to kill him sometimes"" restraint! Along with great writing and a great cast, One Foot in the Grave is a terrific show that, like so many British Comedies, can make you laugh and cry, both within a matter of moments, and all the while, you will have a wonderful time with some of the most endearing characters!

There are things that you would never think of but are plausible when you see it happen in these scenarios. Oftentimes, it's someone calling out to someone else in the house from another room, and a third person had just entered through the front door or kitchen just at that moment and misinterpreted the message for them.  The consequences become hilarious, if a little over the top sometimes.  Always entertaining.  Some quietly thoughtful little pieces too though.  ""Rearranging the Dust"", for example.

You think it's going to start out that way, and then wham, the writers come at from an unexpected direction like a run-away train. While Victor is admittedly an old grouch, you can't help but like him because he's always the underdog. While his life has been far from perfect, he has the love and support of his long suffering wife, and they share a comfortable home together. So his isn't a bad life. He just has the worst luck, and ends up in the craziest situations, often through no fault of his own. The funniest scenes though are when it's absolutely his own doing. Victor's moaning can get on your nerves at times, like nails on a chalkboard, but before it gets too bad something crazy always happens. I don't like how the show ended, but honestly, it really was probably the only way. You'll have to watch it if you want to find out. No spoiler's here!

In fact, we were just recalling it last night, and I decided to see if it was available for sale, and of course it is.

We were absolutely crushed to see that IF we had just recalled One Foot In The Grave a few weeks ago, back in July, we would definitely have jumped on it on the spot (when the price, briefly, was roughly half(!) what it is today).

The basic premise (he's retired, she's still working) might seem depressing but is sobering and realistic. And, although each episode can stand by itself, a thread runs through them all - the quaint, touching affection between the principals.

2649107,5,B000HXDM1E,"One Foot In The Grave is a piece of sheer comedy genius.

The series follows the ups and downs (mainly downs) of newly retired 60-something Victor Meldrew (Played superbly by Richard Wilson) and his long suffering wife of 30 odd years, Margaret (The sublime Annette Crosbie).

As he tries to cope with retirement he discovers the world around him is a very annoying place to live and the feeling is mutual.

Over the course of this hilarious series Victor faces all sorts of horrors and embarrassing situations that he just does not believe. Cats in Freezers, Trash in his garden, Graffiti in his bedroom, Roasted Tortoises, Unwanted family members coming to stay, Ronnie & Mildred, Mrs Warboys and much, much more!

Victor had an assortment of utterances, among them were ""In The Name Of Sanity!"", ""What In The Name Of Bloody Hell?!"" but the one that really got the British public in hysterics was ""I Do Not Believe It!""

Such an every day mundane expression became a comical household saying during the series' 10 year run. So much so that Richard Wilson couldn't go out in public without it being yelled at him. To this day, 10 years after 'One Foot..' ended he still gets asked to say it. The character of Victor is even used in Britain to describe an elderly gentleman who complains a lot.

Victor's nemesis from season 2 onwards was next door neighbour Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) and as the series went on it became clear that Patrick & Victor were more alike than not. However, I was disappointed that Patrick and his wife Pippa didn't appear in the finale. I would have liked to have seen how they reacted to what had happened.

All in all this series never wavered from the reality of life and the situations that Victor found himself in could happen to any one of us.

Save the last episode (not comic at all and poorly conceived) you can not help but laugh at the most unjust and cruel situations happening to a basically good man. So this comedy reveals an ugly side in all of us? Not really... because most of the time, you sympathize with this unlucky man and his wife. In other words, you are not laughing at the expense of other. After all, since we identify with this impatient quasi Biblical Job, we are the object of the humor.

The characters are believable and endearing, even the main character, Victor Meldrew, who, despite being oversensitive to every slight or misfortune in life, somehow seems to bring much of it on himself.  He is certain the world is out to get him, but who else comes home from an awful vacation to find his house burnt down?  Maybe he is right!
His misery is contagious so you better not move next door! As silly as he is, you could almost see yourself doing the same things.  I hope almost, as he does a favor for a neighbor by letting the movers into their house, not realizing it is actually the junk folks, so he accidentally gives away all his neighbor's household possessions.  He is a bit of everyman, moaning about the faults and unfairness of the world, but always willing to lend a hand.  No good deed goes unpunished as he keeps getting in further and further over his head!

There are many, many hours of viewing in this set, so you do get a lot for your money.  The characters are well played and believable.  The characters are played more realistic than in most American shows, so be prepared for not everything having a happy ending.

I'm amazed at how such a hysterically shallow comedy (think Mr. Bean or Monty Python) can also be poignant enough to bring you to tears nearly every episode.  Be warned, these tears do run the full range of emotions: humour, joy, despair, embarassment, revenge, heartbreak..., and may occasionally remind you of family or friends' stories you never quite believed.  Richard Wilson and Annette Crosbie are consumate actors who can elicit any emotion from their audience and make it seem naturally effortless.  They are as perfectly paired as Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer in 'As Time Goes By', only 'One Foot in the Grave' has twice the laughs per episode!",1267574400,27,735,4.951219512195122
2649124,5,B000HXDM1E,"SIDE-SPLITTING FUNNY. The GROUCHIEST Englishman in history but so much mayhem happens to him that he deserves to be grumpy. ""The Complete Collection One Foot in the Grave"" is a series based on confusion, retirement, and moaning. Situations are absurd and unbelievable--but pile up on newly retired Victor Meldrew like maggots on road kill. You will soon understand the why behind his famous line, ""I don't believe it!""

Victor is played by Richard Wilson, a role he'll never live down. He's the Grumpiest of Old Men. He is as fantastic as the script (writer: David Renwick). Victor is the World champion of smart aleck retorts. He's King Curmudgeon. The British Bard of Barbs. Just when you give up hope for something more than cynicism from Victor, he provides an oasis bit of tenderness, a note of loving affection toward his wife. Actually, Victor, attacks every annoying item in society and life, taking natural law into his own hands, only he uses his mouth, and sometimes cunning retaliation. It's funny. He dares do what we've all been tempted to do. He's the occasional ""Robin Hood"" of OAP (old age pensioners). But you don't have to be old and retired to enjoy this one-man crusade against injustice of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. We've all been there, and you too will cheer Victor's act first-think second attack on fate's little burrs of life. Victor is a moaner and complainer with a purpose. Getting even?

Margaret (Annette Crosbie) puts up with her grumpy, conclusion-jumping husband, because she loves him. Interestingly, in the series she begins as the sweet opposite of Victor. As the years pass, they become more and more alike, disagreeable and dislike-able. But so, so, so funny.

The writing is a masterpiece of convoluted plots, woven together so smoothly, that one is forgotten in the movement into another, then, when least expecting it, some silly consequence occurs from the earlier plot activity. In the end, it's all drawn together, but often leaving one tiny aspect left to the viewer's imagination. It just makes it that much more fun. My wife and I are 60+, retired, and could relate.

2649126,5,B000HXDM1E,"One Foot In the Grave is one of the most cleverly written and funniest sitcoms you are ever likely to see. The main character Victor Meldrew is an iconic figure in British comedy. While on the surface he seems to be just a grouchy old man he is in fact a very deep thinker who tries his best to do what is right in a world he doesn't generally agree with. Sometimes things go his way but usually the result is disaster. The supporting cast are all brilliant, his neighbors Patrick and Pippa are forever catching him in awkward situations and are convinced he is insane. His feud with Patrick is one of the most hilarious parts of this show.

I don't personally know anyone else who is familiar with this show, I don't think it has ever been shown on PBS in my area although I know it has been show in other parts of the country at some point. One Foot is a show which I believe deserves a huge cult following here in the US if it were just more well known. In a way you could compare it a bit to Seinfeld in that there are usually several storylines in an episode that converge in the end, again usually adding up to disaster for Victor.

There are so many zany, surreal moments in this show that I couldn't start to list them here. My advice is just buy it and see for yourself. If you appreciate British humor you will in no way be disappointed. I might add that the theme song is written and performed by the legendary Eric Idle of Monty Python fame, he also guest stars in one episode.

One word of advice, if you own a multi-region dvd player try amazon.co.uk for the region two version of the box set as it is much, much cheaper than the region one version, this is true of almost all BBC dvds as well.",1259884800,109,1708,4.185410334346504
2649127,5,B000HXDM1E,"One Foot in the Grave's quality lies in its mixture of real comment on i) old age and growing old, ii) the intimacy of marriage (especially relevant as it is not in this case overly sexualised but quite normal and mundane) and iii) eccentricity and misunderstanding contrasted with the supposed normalcy of others (including their neighbours) surronding the Meldrews and iv) decency and kindness lurking behind Meldrew's lunatic outbursts. This combination provides fertile ground for comedy. There is another factor here and that is social history. Meldrew is undoubtedly an anachronism but one is really struck by how Britain has changed since the making of this series less than 20 years ago.

Top notch and intelligent comedy. Thank you BBC.",1255651200,34,745,5.208333333333333

The First season collection is pleasant to watch, but is not hilarious. Some situations are a bit contrived, as is the snake incident, and for other, my expectations based on review by others may have been too high, as was the vacuum cleaner ""duel"". Many situations could be funnier, but were lost by Wilson's (Victor) delivery.
It is not the ""best ever"" British comedy.
Based on the reviews, I understand subsequent seasons are better.
As in the past, Amazon gets 5 stars for excellence in all aspects of the purchase.",1232323200,3,624,4.681818181818182
2649133,4,B000HXDM1E,"This series was recommended to me by Amazon since I like Britcoms like 'Are You Being Served?,'  'Yes, Minster,' 'Keeping Up Appearances,' and 'Fawlty Towers.'  I had never seen this show, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Like many British sitcoms (contrary to American ones), this series deals with the senior age group.  Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson), a grouch at the latter half of middle age with the sarcastic wit of Basil Fawlty, is forced into early retirement from his job in security reception (""redundancy,"" as they call it in England).  He doesn't adjust well to all his new-found free time as he spends most of his days complaining about neighbors, incompetent fix-it men, strangers who annoy him, and--a continuing theme--litter in his front lawn.  Suffering along with him is his wife Margaret (Annette Crosbie), who seems to work part time as a caregiver, who has to listen to his constant bellyaching.  The first two episodes I thought were mildly amusing.  The show seemed rather slow (albeit faster moving than 'Last of the Summer Wine,' and 'As Time Goes By').  I thought I'd give it 2 maybe 3 stars at the most, then it started picking up.  The last four episodes have many hilarious moments and I've found myself laughing out loud.  A bonus is a featurette defending the show's merits as ""Britain's Best Sitcom.""  I'm still not convinced.  I still think it is 'Fawlty Towers,' but 'One Foot in the Grave' definitely has its moments.

""Alive and Buried""--Victor Meldrew--who worked in security reception--is replaced by an automated system and is forced into early retirement.  To pass the time, he collects wrappers left in his front lawn, practices magic acts (the magician side of him seems a bit out-of-character), shouts at mechanics, and is accused of suspected curb crawling (like Hyacinth's brother-in-law Bruce in 'Keeping Up Appearances').  Speaking of 'Keeping Up Appearances,' I notice his telephone conversations are not done as well at Patricia Routledge.  He talks too fast to convince the viewer there is someone on the other line.
""The Big Sleep""--It's hard for Victor not to think about dying when death is all around him--his cousin, the health & fitness instructor, even a bird he feeds worms to in his front yard.

""The Valley of Fear""--Victor gets tired of Margaret leaving doors and cupboards open: ""What am I supposed to do, carry out a daily inspection of the premises now for batty old women and mummified tomcats.""  Concerned about hooligans, Victor organizes a neighborhood watch and ends up getting a hoodlum reputation himself.  Christopher Ryan ('The Young Ones') makes an appearance as a plumber in shorts.
""I'll Retire to Bedlam""--Victor is in an even fouler mood than usual as he's attacked by bees, his little grand-nephews, and Britain's peculiar medical service.  Best moments are in the doctor's office and his handling of his bratty nephews.

""The Eternal Quadrangle""--Margaret is not happy about Victor sketching a nude woman in art class...especially when he accepts a job cleaning at the nude model's house.  I liked the vacuum duel between Victor and the model's senile father.  In the meantime, Margaret finds she has an admirer.  It is funny how dense Victor is about his wife's friend's intentions.
""The Return of the Speckled Band""--Victor and Margaret get ready for a trip to Athens.  In the meantime, Victor unknowingly keeps making life miserable for Mrs. Warboy and the Meldrews unknowingly have a new companion--a 7-foot Indian Python (speaking of pythons, Eric Idle of 'Monty Python' fame wrote and sang the show's theme song).  The snake part of the story isn't settled here, you'll have to get the second season DVD.",1226016000,12,3693,5.0213464696223316

2649136,5,B000HXDM1E,"I just love this show! I found it by accident when purchasing other British comedies on Amazon. It's a comedy along the lines of Fawlty Towers, The Thin Blue Line and Blackadder. Yet, One Foot in the Grave is distinctly unique. It covers an overlooked segment of the population (the recently retired & aging segment).

If you have never saw One Foot in the Grave, start at season 1 and work your way up through all the seasons. The show and characters are more enjoyable watched in order, as many times they will work off something that occured in a previous show. Season 1 has its share of hilarious moments. My favorite episodes are ""The Valley of Fear"", ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Return of the Speckled Band"".

An overview of the show, is about a 60 year old man (Mr. Victor Meldrew) whom is forced into retirement and has his whole life turned upside down. He feels he's just been forced to wait for death. As he battles against a world that now longer makes sense, trouble seems to find him at every corner. Richard Wilson plays Victor Meldrew and Annette Crosbie plays as his wife Margaret Meldrew. Both Crosbie and Wilson are hysterical & believable. Victor being on the brink of a breakdown all the time, and his wife the voice of sanity, that brings humor to every situation. Or is Victor the sanest of them all?

The older I get the more I identify with grumpy ole' Victor Meldrew.
