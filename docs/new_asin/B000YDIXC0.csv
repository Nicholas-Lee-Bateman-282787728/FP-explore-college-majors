...the performance begins with elvin jones counting out the time and then transferring that to one driving cymbal... .. jump to 'doll of the bride', song three. inspired by a japanese folk song, this third and last song is truly the climax of the evening. it opens powerfully and maintains this dynamic energy. such a hip opening melody, it absolutely takes off and goes and goes splendidly into the world of jazz improvisation. beginning with pickens solo prompting us solidly into his ideas. well into the solo, pickens takes us into a driving melodic percussive journey... across the keyboard he does take us. brilliant performance. enters fortune on tenor. all solos on this piece are killers but this journey by sonny fortune is like a history of jazz tenor; it goes so many places... and passion abounds. at one point after part one of his memorable solo the band choruses into a wild flurry and fortune reenters on his sax, exploding into a bending hip screaching upper register journey, which sends the audience into a frenzy. he then explores the lower range, the very bottom with masculine assertion; jumps again from the middle into upper range and beyond... brilliantly executed and for the entire solo he has us captivated like a preacher in heat; he is relentless.
chip jackson follows with bass solo. if you love the bass, you will love this solo. elvin then enters pulls out all stops and performs a long complex and fascinating solo, using cymbals and full kit. the song closes exploratory in nature... with the two tenors together in unison... taking us out... after experiencing a really exciting jazz performance.  mz",1340496000,,1884,5.0256410256410255
