7797121,4,1569382948,"this a great series, I have the 4 VHS tapes and the book BUT I wish the series came out on DVD as well. the VHS tapes are in NSTC format which give me noise bars across the screen when I try to watch on my PAL VCR (In Australia).",1388534400,,229,3.6
7797122,4,1569382948,"Great premise for a music related project: travel down the Mississippi River and stop at various towns and feature their music. What the viewer gets is a wide variety of regional music, representing many different genres. Until I saw this series I had never stopped to consider the prevalence and popularity of specific genres to specific regions. The series does a great job of featuring the musical variety and history along the Mississippi (a highlight for me was being introduced to the group, the Bottle Rockets).  The series is now several years old and shows its age. That's what kept me from giving the series a 5.  I'd be curious to see what music would be found if the series were produced today.",1376092800,,706,4.7317073170731705
7797123,4,1569382948,"Acorn Media has been issuing some really nice videos and one of their latest is of special value  to anyone interested in American music. With the supertitle ""The Mississippi, River of Song: The Grassroots of American  Music,"" this program is divided into four tapes of about 60 minutes each.  The basic idea is that we start with ""Americans Old and New"" at the  northern source of the great river and follow the stream through the  ""Midwestern Crossroads,"" the ""Southern Fusion,"" and wind up in ""Louisiana,  Where Music is King."" Basically the idea is a good one.  The first  section starts with the Chippewa Nation and a Scandinavian fiddle group,  both of whose representatives have much to say about tradition. But when we  get to Minneapolis, we have to listen to the claims of alternative rock  groups (the first one brags about not caring about success and annoying  their neighbors when they rehearse) who have not quite as much relation to  the Mississippi as do most of the other groups. For example, the German  polka  group in Wisconsin seem to belong right where they are, while rock  and jazz groups could have been interviewed just about anywhere in these  states.  Yet in the four hours, there simply has to be music you will  like. The interviews are always interesting; but after a while they begin  to sound a bit the same-so I do not recommend watching all four hours at  one sitting! The narration is always interesting, spoken as it is by  folk-rock singer Ani DiFranco. Still you are struck with the incredible  diversity of music we have not only in this country as a whole  but even in  the limited confines the producers of this series have chosen as their  focal point.  However you might quibble with the choice of groups used  here, those selected are at least representative of the kind of music under  consideration. For example, the third set, which takes us from LA Center,  Kentucky to Jackson, Mississippi, includes Boundless Love Quartet, Sonny  Burgess, Memphis Horns and Ann Peebles, Little Milton, and the Mississippi  Mass Choir among others. I cannot begin to comment on whether other groups  would have been better or worse choices. I would have preferred more ethnic  groups, but that's me.  Co-produced by the mighty Smithsonian Institute,  these tapes have a companion set of two CDs (without the interviews, I  imagine) and a ""companion"" book, ""River of Song: a Musical Journey Down the  Mississippi."" I think you will find the videos music very worthwhile.",925776000,12,2503,4.871428571428571
