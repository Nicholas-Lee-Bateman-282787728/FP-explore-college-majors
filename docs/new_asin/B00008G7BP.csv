8287304,3,B00008G7BP,"Three programs of the unexplained on one dvd.
1. Hauntings - Experts, skeptics and people who have encountered this phenomena talk about there experiences. Photos of ghosts are shown and haunted houses are visited by camera crews.
2. Vampires - I couldn't get into this program, I think people who think they are vampires are not all there. Interviews with people who think they are vampires by drinking blood just made me sick.
3. Alien Abductions - Two interviews with Alien Abductees tell us there stories with beings from another world. Alien Abduction researchers Bud Hopkins and John Mack are also interviewed along with debunker Phillip Klass.
All three programs run for about 23 minutes each. There is no time information when disc is playing for each episode which is annoying when not knowing how long the episode has left. The menu is static, no extras. Transfer is good, sometimes the picture can be too red in colour mainly in the Alien Abduction episode. Audio is Dolby 3.0. Overall, besides the vampire episode, if your interested in the unexplained, at this price, its worth the purchase. Disc 3/5, transfer 3/5, audio 4/5, extras 0/5.",1051228800,2,1151,4.938144329896907
