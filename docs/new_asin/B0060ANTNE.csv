8490279,4,B0060ANTNE,Too bad we can't get a serious review of the audio / video quality.. Just whining about Sammy. Grow up. thank you.,1336953600,,114,4.2272727272727275
8490280,4,B0060ANTNE,"This is Van Halen at the pinnacle of their musical prowess. No explosions, no massive light show, no Vegas showroom clown, just Van Halen doing what they do best. A must for any Van Halen, a must for any rock fan, if you don't have it-get it!",1336003200,2,242,4.170212765957447
8490281,1,B0060ANTNE,I didn't even open it.  As soon as I turned it over I knew I had been scammed.  By Right here Right now if you want Hagar's performance with VH.,1328054400,7,144,3.7666666666666666
8490282,1,B0060ANTNE,"This is not the REAL Van Halen don't buy if your looking for DLR, there is no way this is from 1983, complete disappointment Amazon you shouldn't be selling lies as soon as I saw the back I knew I got shafted",1327708800,8,208,3.9761904761904763
8490283,1,B0060ANTNE,"The description states this was recorded in 1983, which would lead one to think it was the classic Van Halen with David Lee Roth.  Imagine how surprised I was when I flipped the case over, saw a picture of Sammy Hagar, and the song list from tours with Hagar!

I am going to destroy this item so I can spare someone else from the same pain...at least it will be one less in circulation.",1327622400,10,386,4.202702702702703
8490284,1,B0060ANTNE,"I can appreciate the review praising Hagar however, this is ADVERTISED as 83 era (that would be Diver Down with David Lee Roth) and it's not. I did not bother opening it after I saw the track listing but it appears it was likely taken from a Japan 89 show that is in circulation as a bootleg and maybe the Live: Right Here, Right Now or Live Without A Net shows - all feature Hagar and were NOT shot in 83 on Brazilian TV as the description states. Amazon needs to pull this product or modify the description.",1327449600,26,509,4.204081632653061
8490285,5,B0060ANTNE,"Van halen as a band rock and have always had great songs whether it be with Roth or Hagar and this collection brings together most of their best work. yes there will always be songs here and there that people will have wanted to see included but that's just one of those things and a matter of personal taste. i have always loved the hagar stuff in general more that the stuff with DLR, but that again is just personal choice. it's a great collection from one of the best rock bands ever seen- you really can't go wrong with any of the songs on here!!!",1327449600,,552,4.216981132075472
8490286,1,B0060ANTNE,"was very disapointed ,no david lee ,what up with that, it said it was the earley years,sammy is o.k but david lee rule,s in my book ,buyer beware, i will not watch this one again & sound quality sucks as well,  tommygun.",1327363200,21,220,4.238095238095238
8490287,1,B0060ANTNE,"It sucks!! Seller states that it was recorded in 1983, Sammy Hagar was not in the band at that time. I am an early VH fan (DLR era) and this dvd is not from that era. Early VH fans stay away. I am going to use the DVD as a coaster.",1327363200,31,231,3.549019607843137
