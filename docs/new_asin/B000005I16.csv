8454149,5,B000005I16,"Hi, My nine month old daughter has been watching this tape since she was 5 months old. She loves it. My wife and I are learning Hebrew and this tape is great. The music is wonderful as is the backrounds. This is the only  thing on the toob that my daughter watches, laughs and doesn't move. When  she once in a while wakes at night and won't go back down, I hold her and  sing the songs as we watch. I highly recommend it. Enjoy",962064000,2,428,4.011764705882353
8454150,5,B000005I16,"I bought Hebrew Songs 2 to introduce the Hebrew language to my 8 month old.  I assumed that she would only watch it with me.  I was so wrong!  My husband loves the upbeat songs in this video, and dances with my daughter.  My daughter can't get enough of it - now at 9 months, she goes to the tv  and starts to dance to let us know she wants to watch it.  She loves the  music, the action, and the colors in the video.  Even the babysitter  enjoyes playing Hebrew Songs 2 for our daughter.  We are all learning  Hebrew the fun way!",948153600,,530,4.0
