The movie was cute. for anyone who knows iranians, is married to one or who is an iranian, and growing up in the USA you will like it. some old school iranians might find it offensive if they are living in the past (old and traditional) iranian way of living. give it a chance. it is based on an Jewish Iranian family and not a muslim family.

the movie begins with an american boy, who moves from middle america to Los Angeles to become an actor. He meets an Iranian girl and is in love immediately. For you who are iranian you know that the family doesn't like this guy already and he is not Jewish to boot! He does everything he can to win over her love and the approval of her family, but not like most men would. He sends her a beef jerky stick, I don't know what thats all about, but thats what he thinks is cute. (I guess for the girl who has everything). Like i said its a cute movie, maybe more of a female flick for iranians. but i liked it.",1123200000,3,1004,4.070707070707071

8021344,5,B00023JD2Q,"I am Persian and living in Los Angeles. ""IRANgeles""- the name already made me laugh. It was good to see a movie that shows Persian life in the U.S.A. as it really is. And it was good to see that Persians and our non-Persian friends can get along.
I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh and feel good watching a movie. I gave this movie to my children and they watch it over and over. Five stars.",1084838400,4,408,4.1125

8021346,5,B00023JD2Q,"I really liked this movie, because it's so accurate. It captures Beverly Hills Persians in all their glory. The film is kind of like that Greek Wedding, or Beckham movie, in that it reveals a neat little culture that lives within our larger western culture. Some of the jokes are especialy funny to Persians, but it's interesting and funny for outsiders too, because it's told from the point of view of an outsider who really gets into the world if IRANgeles.",1083715200,5,459,4.679012345679013
