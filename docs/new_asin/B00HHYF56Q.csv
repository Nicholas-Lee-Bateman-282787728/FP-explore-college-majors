6165015,5,B00HHYF56Q,"I love anthologies and it's great to see Tom Holland bringing us original stories and acting as Alfred Hitchcock, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" style.",1395187200,2,148,5.478260869565218
6165016,1,B00HHYF56Q,"Poor acting,Poor film quality,Weak weak plot..nothing twisted or horror about this... What a disappointment. Im a huge fan of Creepshows and Tales from Crypt etc... this was just a pathetic attempt. Please save your money...or send it to me , you can buy my copy",1395187200,2,262,4.844444444444444
6165017,5,B00HHYF56Q,"I loved this series when it was on Animal Planet - well written and well-made - kind of spooky or creepy since it talks about the secret lives of bats, snakes, rats, etc. and all the myths that are associated with them - and you learn so many interesting facts about these animals you never knew! Also, it's done in a very captivating, witty (humorous) style.",1313625600,,359,4.454545454545454
6165028,1,B00HHYF56Q,"It's pretty bad, but I knew that going into it. I was hoping that the ideas would at least be interesting. Some of them were, but overall, I was pretty disappointed.",1409875200,,165,4.354838709677419
6165029,3,B00HHYF56Q,"some of the stories stood out, in particular the one about the new drug everyone is doing, the magic mirror was also pretty entertaining, and the demo squad friends or are they. some over used like another vampire story, but all in all, worth the time to check it out.",1404172800,,268,4.38
6165030,2,B00HHYF56Q,"I tried to watch this a few times but it was so boring that I kept falling asleep...I'm gonna try to watch it again tonight and see if I can make it through, since I paid for it, if it's any good I'll update the review.",1402358400,,219,3.782608695652174
6165031,1,B00HHYF56Q,"Clearly, a lot of people were disappointed by this product. I managed to see the first two episodes, but the last was completely unplayable. It crashed at around the 43 minute mark. I'm doubly disappointed because I'm a huge Angela Bettis fan, and it was her segment that was unwatchable. Because I am a Bettis fan, I'm going order a replacement, but I wanted buyers to know that there is more than just artistic issues here.

As for the first two episodes, they were not really awful, just not very good. Tom Holland's presence was not too annoying, he's basically playing the Rod Serling bit in The Twilight Zone.

Update: It's now May 14th. Amazon sent me my replacement disc and it plays perfectly. I found that there were more segments than I thought. I forgot to count them but there were maybe seven or so. Now that I have seen the whole disc I can say that it is uniformly awful. Bad stories, bad acting (some almost comically bad, as though the actors were trying to be bad for comic effect. They weren't). As usual, Angela Bettis was the only good thing here, and even she couldn't rise above this trash. A bad movie. Save your money.",1399766400,4,1144,4.4951923076923075
6165032,3,B00HHYF56Q,"If your a die hard fan, that places child's play and fright night on your personal horror cinema pedestal, then perhaps you will enjoy this film more than most, but if you don't fall into that category then before buying and or watching this film keep in mind it's a low budget flick that attempts to deliver more stories than it has funding so it tends to have cheap graphics and weak acting. That being said, its not a complete waste of time or failure so if your looking for a film to get more laughs than frights out of then this may be a movie for you.",1399248000,,557,4.166666666666667
6165033,3,B00HHYF56Q,Story lines were ok.  Not even scary.  Could have taken or left this movie.  If you have nothing to do and want to waste some more time....watch this movie.,1397174400,,156,4.310344827586207
6165034,3,B00HHYF56Q,"The film contains about 9 or so episodes from as short as 7 minutes, to a final episode that was about a half hour. It had to be divided into episodes at that length. The stories involved various aspect of the horror world, some with new modern twists involving gadgets, but pretty much the same stories we were used to watching aka ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Creep Show."" For seasoned viewers there won't be any twists or surprises. However a younger generation who never grew up watching the ""classics"" should find a wealth of enjoyment in these tales.

The beginning of each tale includes a completely unnecessary mini plot spoiler introduction by Tom Holland. It adds nothing to the episode. It lacks the entertainment value of Creep Show and the insight of a Zone introduction. Its sole purpose is to be a Tom Holland ego fest. I found him to be the biggest negative aspect of the features...like Joe Jackson being in his own videos.

Worth a view for even seasoned viewers, just don't expect any new twists to the twisted tales.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Minimal blood. $9.96 Walmart.",1396483200,4,1101,4.723958333333333
6165035,1,B00HHYF56Q,The movie was horrible. The acting stunk and so did the stories. After watching them I sat there and was like wtf. I can't believe I wasted money on this garbage. A complete joke and a waste for peoples money and time.,1395878400,3,218,4.214285714285714
6165036,1,B00HHYF56Q,"Thought this would be cool to watch on a lazy Sunday until The Walking Dead came on. I think trained monkeys could act better than 99% of the people in this train wreck. My expectations weren't too high so it's shameful that it didn't even come close to meeting it. Could only sit through about 6 of these ""tales"".",1395532800,2,314,4.338983050847458
6165037,5,B00HHYF56Q,"A fun horror anthology. Feels like a modern ""Tales from the Crypt"" meets Twilight Zone.  Some episodes are better than others, but a great cast for a small project.",1395187200,2,164,4.655172413793103
8632871,4,B00HHYF56Q,"I'm surprised! Very 80's but pretty good acting and special effects. Lots of stories, worth the watch.",1469318400,,102,5.0588235294117645

8632874,1,B00HHYF56Q,The first 30 minutes was good and then it got very boring....I was a waste of time and money.,1443398400,,93,3.9473684210526314
8632875,1,B00HHYF56Q,"I grew up watching horror anthologies, and there was always at least one story in the bunch that was good. In this DVD, sadly, I found none. Even the one with William Forsythe was terrible. It would be just as useful to take the money you are thinking about using to spend for this DVD, tear it up, and let it blow away. That's how putrid it is!",1442275200,,345,4.088235294117647
8632876,2,B00HHYF56Q,"Meh.  Only so-so.  Had the look and feel of a bad 80 horror movie.
Bad production values, and not in HD.",1431734400,,104,3.9047619047619047
8632877,1,B00HHYF56Q,"Angela Bettis is excellent as always. But the rest of it is just a shameful waste of some really good acting talent. Tom Holland is supposedly a master of talent, but you'd expect a master might be able to recognize the crappy bits and maybe, you know, stop and do it better.",1423526400,2,275,4.3076923076923075
8632878,5,B00HHYF56Q,Great price fast shipping,1411862400,,25,5.5
8632879,3,B00HHYF56Q,"With two out of six episodes worth watching, this anthology of Tom Holland's Twisted Tales Season 1 horror series does not justify the DVD's purchase or asking price.

If you're looking for a good series of horror anthologies to sink you teeth into, I'd recommend Tales from the Crypt or Masters of Horror and, cannot in all good consciensce, recommend that you spend your hard earned cash on this piece of crap.",1411430400,,412,4.722222222222222
