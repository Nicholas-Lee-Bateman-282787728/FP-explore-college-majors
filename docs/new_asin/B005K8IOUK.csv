4715720,3,B005K8IOUK,"Although Desire (aka Q) is a good film regardless, anyone looking to buy this DVD expecting the same sexually explicit content as the French original needs to know before they order that this is a censored version of the film. Despite being marketed as ""unrated"" (and it probably is because, even censored, it's pretty explicit), once again North American audiences are being treated like children by the studios and are being forced to deal with a bowdlerized version of a film. None of this is Amazon's fault (they can't police everything they sell), but hopefully they'll adjust the listing accordingly. I also knocked off a star because no option is given to turn off the English subtitles (though at least the original French audio remains, with no English dub). (Note: possibly because I purchased this via Amazon Canada not Amazon US yet entered this review through Amazon US I have not been given an ""Amazon verified purchase"" option, but for the record this review is based upon an item I ordered via Amazon.)",1339459200,40,1018,4.890173410404624

4715724,4,B005K8IOUK,"After reading a few of the emerging comments from 'unhappy' customers who have recently purchased the (just released) 'North American' version of the film ""Q"" (aka ""Desire"")  and found it to apparently be 'cut' of some of its' more graphic sex scenes - I can only offer my condolances and a hearty ""WTF?!""  I would note that the version of the film that I have reviewed is/was the ""French' - Region 2 version of ""Q""  (also available on Amazon)  BUT you need a region free DVD player to watch it.  They are very easy to order on-line & a good one can be purchased for under $100.00... they open up a vast new world of DVD options!  Such info aside - my review of the 'uncut' Euro-version follows:

Feel as one may about French films, it must be admitted that they bring something to the field of erotic cinema that is refreshingly 'real' , and the film 'Q' ('Desire') carries on this tradition. In an interview in the 'extras' section on the disk the director (Laurent Bouhnik  )  states that he was attempting to present a more 'honest' and 'feminine' view of human sexual relationships.  The mechanism that he uses to achieve this goal seems to centre on focusing on the female characters in the story as they relate to life circumstances and men.  The plot revolves around a group of young 20 somethingish individuals, who appear to all be acquainted, living in a small sea-side town.  Played out against the grim economic realities of present times we follow the action of the principal female character, Cecile, as she comes to grips with her father's recent death.  Apparently a bit 'un-hinged' by her personal loss she appears to be casting about for some satisfaction/resolution through a series of sexual dalliances and relationships.  She is having 'issues' with her 'steady' boyfriend so she 'teases' some other guys into having sex with her and also gets involved in some sapphic action with the sexually naive & frustrated Alice. To a lesser extent the plot also attempts to track the sexual flounderings of some of the secondary characters and it can get a little confusing, on first viewing, as to who is with who and why they're doing what they're doing.

Indeed, 'frustration' is a key concept in this flik as the director, again, makes his point that, in the real world, sexual relationships are not always 'smooth' and 'hot' as depicted in the porno cinema.  This film IS quite explicit in showing intimate sexual situations and full female (& male) nudity abounds.  There are scenes of oral and auto eroticism, as well as hetero and lesbian liaisons - but no penetration, and the sex is all woven into the context of the story-line so that it does not come off as 'gratuitous'.  In the final analysis, the film doesn't come to any grand conclusions - it is essentially a 'slice of life' examination of human relationships - but the 'thespians' are all very attractive and get naked a lot.  I would say that the director achieved his objective in providing a more 'realistic' vision of eroticism, which ironically may lower its' actual erotic potential, but it is an easy and enjoyable watch (with lotsa naked bodies) and even has a (relatively) happy ending!",1332028800,63,3177,4.733212341197822

4715772,5,B005K8IOUK,I read the one-star reviews and they are simply wrong and inappropriate.  This listing is for the explicit region 2 version of the movie. How anybody can think that the male member in all its glory with a beautiful woman administering oral stimulation is not explicit is beyond me.  This is a movie with a story of which explicit sex is a part.  The explicit scenes are not long or in your face as you would get in a traditional porn movie.

8476583,1,B005K8IOUK,Desire (English Subtitled) USA Movie Edited :(,1513296000,4,46,5.714285714285714
8476584,5,B005K8IOUK,"This review is for the uncut version of ""Desire"". Desire is a great film about what it means to be human. Desire flares like the spark when you strike a match, it doesn't always make sense, it can be painful and awkward at times but if anyone wants a real chance of being happy, you have to follow it. There are several brilliant scenes in Desire and then a few which don't work and even one or two which I think should have been included based on the material presented. I will discuss three scenes from the movie in a little detail.
1. The first brilliant scene is at the beginning when we find ourselves in a women's shower room. The women are nude and we only see them from the waist down. As the scene unfolds we hear the women talking about their lives and this creates tremendous depth as we hear how each women is different from each other. Just as their bodies are different from each other, we learn that each woman is an individual person and we see the humanity in them. This isn't the cheap joke of a locker room from Porky's, this shows the individuality of each woman and is stunning.
2. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but there is a very powerful scene early on which shows the differences between a man and a woman and how a woman should never been seen just as an object there to satisfy a man's desire. He needs to be aware of her desire as well. The beautiful and very talented Helene Zimmer climbs into a car. She unzips his pants and starts to perform fellatio on his 9"" penis. As she does so, she pauses and asks him if it's what he wants. She resumes the blowjob and stops again and asks if he likes it. When he has a full erection she says  that she can go and get a beer for him afterward. He tells her to stop and asks what's wrong with her? Nothing is wrong with her, she is bringing his attention to the fact that she is not a sex slave for him. This is a stunning scene and highlights how many men think women are just there for their own pleasure. It's a very graphic scene as Ms. Zimmer sucks on his penis and pumps with her hand until he has a full erection, then she gets out of the car and leaves him to deal with it on his own. This is an indictment against the rude and crude behavior of a lot of men and hopefully any man watching this scene might think twice about being aware of the desire of the women he is with.
3. One final scene I will mention involves the also beautiful and talented Deborah Revy performing fellatio on the same 9"" penis towards the end of the film. What might have started as his desire is overtaken by her desire as she increases her blowjob and hand pumping to satisfy her own desire and sense of power. Appearing close to ejaculating, he stops her and tells her that it hurts. This highlights he realizes he's no longer in control and might even feel overwhelmed by the power of her desire. It's a great scene, though the lighting is a little dark at times. When the Helene Zimmer blowjob is filmed very close up, this blowjob is only close-up towards the end, the rest is a medium shot. Still brilliant and shows the differences in desire.
This is a powerful film and the graphic scenes add tremendous power and depth to the complexity of human emotions, needs and desires. While some scenes are brilliant and the film overall is great, there are a few problems to me. There are no cunnlingus scenes in the entire film and if Miss Zimmer and Ms. Revy are willing to put a very large penis into their mouths for the sake of art, it's shameful the same man wasn't willing to return the favor to them. I also think the man should have ejaculated in the scene with Miss Revy, to do so would have given up all the control to Miss Revy. To not have him ejaculate means he had to regain control of the situation and perhaps shows the male filmmakers are afraid of women?
Two scenes I thought would have made tremendous sense in the context of the film and explored the concept of desire further:
1. I was expecting a party scene which would lead to two party girls giving a blowjob to the actor with the 9"" penis. Then Ms. Zimmer would have walked in and somehow saw the scene or he would have taken pictures and sent them to her. There should have been more of an exchange of passion and frustration between the two of them.
2. Or I was expecting Ms. Revy to wake him up in the morning with a blowjob and force him to finish in an explosion of her lust and desire.

Desire is a great movie and goes places where more films should. It's brave and bold and Miss Zimmer and Miss Revy deserve kudos for having the conviction and dedication to challenge everyone to think about their own desires and how they are made up. I can't imagine what they said to their boyfriends or husbands on the days when they went to work and performed fellatio on a stranger in front of an entire film crew. It's a brave movie.
