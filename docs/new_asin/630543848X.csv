1032798,5,630543848X,"If laughter is the best medecine, then this hilarious British comedy ought to be at the top of every doctor's prescription list!  Quite frankly, I cannot recall one episode in the entire series thus far that hasn't left me with a belly-ache from laughing so hard.
This, the third volume in the series, consists of three 40-minute episodes.  In ""The Easter Bunny,"" everyone on the parish council gives up something for lent, and the parish video fund gets quite an infusion of cash thanks to someone's inability to stick to his resolution.  ""The Christmas Lunch Incident"" has the vicar accepting a few too many invitations for Christmas lunch with some very funny results.  Though all three episodes are hilarious as always, the last one, ""Engagement,"" is particularly so.  Hugo, with a little help from the vicar, finally figures out what to do about his attraction to Alice.  Meanwhile, the vicar inadvertently finds herself being courted (if one can call it that!) by one of her parishoners.
Those who've enjoyed the first two volumes will not want to miss this one.  For those who've yet to experience this delightful series, it really is one of the best comedies around; I, for one, know of none better!  Extremely highly recommended!",1003449600,17,1238,4.918269230769231
1032799,4,630543848X,"Wonderful set of shows.  Christmas is a time one does not go on a diet and the Vicar shows why clergy never think of such an idea.  The Easter Bunny  episode bids us farewell to a character but not before she gets everyone in  the end.  At last finally, Hugo and Alice DO something about their  infatuation.  Which causes some father and son difficulties.  Sit back and  enjoy a sweet, sweet show I've grown to love!",967161600,13,416,4.368421052631579
1032800,5,630543848X,"I came upon this series by accident actually. After the first episode, I had to buy all the tapes! The English village of Dibley has the STRANGEST bunch of residents I have ever seen. And watching an unconventional female  Vicar, who is really the only normal one there, interact with them will  have you rolling on the floor with laughter. Dawn French is absolutly  wonderful as Geraldine Granger, the Vicar. Bringing humor to the pulpit!  You've got to see it!",955497600,5,462,4.7375
1032801,5,630543848X,"This series stars the Dawn French (of French & Saunders fame). In a world where the mass media is obsessed with a sickily thin ideal of beauty, Dawn French sparkles on screen as the good Viker. The great thing about  this BBC series is the wonderfully human way that comedy is allowed to be  touching and poinent. The humanity of the people of Dibley and their Viker  is so warm and humorous that you will find yourself watching this video  over and over again! This is the kind of thing you'll want to introduce  friends to.",948240000,2,525,4.427083333333333
1032802,5,630543848X,I have watched every available episode of every french and saunders production.  This past christmas I was able to see the Christmas Lunch...I never laughed so hard or long in a very long time!  I am purchasing this  and the Vicar Live so that I can share with my extended family. I think  everyone should see this to see what true comedy is really all about...keep  british imports coming to the USA for our viewing pleasure!,947894400,3,426,4.552631578947368
1032803,5,630543848X,"Having designed the video packaging for all of the ""Vicar of Dibley"" tapes in the US, I had to watch all the episodes located on each cassette. Though all are wonderful due to the charming and expressive  Dawn French, this particular tape ""The Specials"" contains the  funniest episodes. Of special note is ""The Christmas Lunch  Incident,"" which had me screaming with laughter. It is the most  hysterical half hour of British comedy I have seen in a long, long time.",935280000,29,465,4.775

1033092,4,630543848X,"If you enjoy British humor you should enjoy the Vicar of Dibley.  The village inhabitants are all characters of one sort or another, from the pompous landed gentry to the rather uncouth sheep farmer. Their reaction to the new female vicar, played by comedian Dawn French, begins unfavorably and progresses to acceptance and even admiration.  My favorite village character is Jim, an elderly, somewhat unkempt, raspy voiced resident with confusing speech patterns.  No, no, no . . . yes.",1424390400,,486,5.1265822784810124

During the courtship the residents are doing their usual crazy things such as the drawing class with a nude model. When the villagers get involved in planning the Vicar' s wedding, you know it will be the most unusual one ever. Richard Armitage usually plays darker roles such as Guy of Gisbourn in Robin Hood.

Dawn French is outstanding. The basic format -- an opening humorous scene; the council meeting; and the ending spoken joke -- is addictive. My husband particularly liked that one need not be adept at British humor to enjoy and savor the experience.

The Vicar sleeps with at least two men (& makes) references to past relationships. There were a lot of unnecessary comments about sleeping with animals.

The ensemble has perfect timing, and ll characters are great snap shots of what you might find in a small village.  The writing is also clever and brought to life well by the talent.  I find myself laughing uncontrollably at times, not only with the lines but also the physical comedy.

1034118,3,630543848X,"While Vicar of Dibley holds a good amount of silly and situational humor, it does present the town's Vicar in perhaps a less than respectable light and not a likely candidate to set example or to lead even such a small village as Dibley. Should the program have been about perhaps the town librarian or city clerk, it might have been more warmly received, as those positions are less likely to be held up for human courage and qualities of strength. Ironically, it's the more docile and innocent qualities of the local intellectually challenged Vicar's assistant and her future husband/husband and father-in-law that actually provide the greatest and most memorable entertainment. But the characterization of an Anglican Vicar as having severe gluttony, about which she appears to have no objection whatever, and an insatiable desire for gratuitous sex seems beneath the office.",1372982400,,878,5.190140845070423

1034171,5,630543848X,"Classic BBC humor, highly reminiscent of the Saturday Night Live stand up comedy of the 1970's....In typical BBC Comedy fashion, the series starts like a cat waking up....stretching slowly, moving a bit faster, then pouncing on tidbits (of comedy in this case)...You have to watch several episodes and then you will be hooked.  U.S. comedy is geared toward the ""immediate satisfaction"" crowd for the most part - the bulk of British comedy (and it's enduring following) lies in silliness built over episodes and seasons.

A note about the boxed sets...make sure all the seasons and the Specials are included.  For instance, the second series contains the two specials produced after the last season, for some odd reason.  The Specials both belong after the final season if you are looking to watch them in order. Cheers!",1369958400,,819,5.044444444444444

1034261,4,630543848X,"British comedy can be a bit off and this series is no different. Despite the fact that Amazon has included no FULL seasons, each has just enough to wet your appetite so that you can see how good a show this is. Naturally, for my temperament, there are times when I am turned off but crudity is not really something I treasure (even in comedy).

Nonetheless, The Vicar of Dibley is full of stomach splitting moments which has caused me to literally laugh out loud when surrounded by other people. (No doubt I appear foolish but some of the episodes are just hilarious!!)

While it is not a series I would ever recommend to the young (that would include young adults) due to (times of excessive) lewdness, there are times when it is touching and, (having begun at Season 1) I do appreciate how a mishmash of ""strange"" villagers work their way into becoming a caring community.

Finally, some of the funniest scenes are the last 30 seconds of each episode. As someone who doesn't always get the joke -- those little tidbits are just too much! For me, personally, it was nice to revisit them over 15 years from when I first saw them.",1365379200,,1129,4.4975609756097565

1034402,3,630543848X,"""Vicar of Dibley"" fans must have been in heaven during Christmas time 1999.  Four episodes named after the seasons aired within nine days from December 24, 1999 to January 1, 2000.  These episodes are not my favorite.  Some of the scenes seem a bit silly even for this show and ""Spring"" was very odd as David Horton was quite out-of-character.  I didn't ""buy it"" (his character, that is). This disc offers several special features though, the best being ""The Real Vicars of Dibley"" where actual female vicars are interviewed, one living her life pretty similar to Geraldine Granger's.  She even staged a publicity stunt to raise money for a roof for her church. In addition to the special feature films, there are cast bios, a photo gallery and trailers for other shows.

""Autumn""-Alice and Hugo share honeymoon photos with the Vicar.  The part where Hugo gets busted after he agrees to carry a stranger's case through customs makes no sense.  Hugo was detained for 14 months??!!  That is a bit much even for this show.  Anyway, the Vicar starts a romance with David's rebellious brother Simon and, when Simon breaks up with her, she becomes so depressed she turns in her letter of resignation.

""Winter""--The church is planning a special Christmas show for the Millennium (I thought the Brits would better understand the 2000/2001 thing).  They decide to create a live nativity on Owen's farm.  The auditions for the kings and the debate over the ""Greatest Story Ever Told"" were ridiculous.  The townspeople were cartoonishly dumb there (and not Alice this time).  When it is show time, the birth of baby Jesus becomes a little more realistic than was planned.

""Spring""--First off, the baby-changing part was gross.  Anyway, this episode seemed weird to me.  They were hinting about David developing feelings for Geraldine in previous episodes but jeeeez!  All of a sudden he's in love and is willing to join the Labour Party!  That is so out-of-character and so fast.  The obvious age difference is never touched on and they don't seem like a couple at all.  It just seemed out there.

""Summer""--Seems like they used that joke about Owen and the toilet he hadn't flushed in ten days before.  Anyway, there's a water shortage and the government plans to create a reservoir that will wipe out Dibley.  Despite the compensation the residents will receive, they want to stay in their town and the Vicar mounts a protest by chaining herself to the church.  I correctly predicted the ending.

Special Features:
""Ballykissdibley""--This 1997 Comic Relief special has a young Irish vicar coming to Dibley as part of an exchange program and he and Geraldine end up kissing...for charity, of course.  I've got to hand it to Geraldine Granger; she can get pretty much any man she sets her mind on, except Tristan.

""Behind the Scenes of 'Red Nose Day' 1999""--Just as the title says.

""Red Nose Day""--The BBC wants to make a film in Dibley starring Johnny Depp.  The Vicar invites Depp to the vicarage and he invites some famous friends, although it's a bit dark to see them.

""The Real Vicars of Dibley""--A talk with female vicars who do not fit the stereotype.  It includes a history of women being ordained by the Church of England, a meeting with the real female vicar who inspired the Geraldine character, and another who seems to live her life like Geraldine.  Male vicars who don't fit the mold are included in this 28-minute documentary.",1325548800,,3435,4.845360824742268

1034406,5,630543848X,"This is the set of the 4-episode season three of Vicar of Dibley.  Dawn French is delightful as the female vicar who does things her own way.  The supporting cast is terrific, and maybe one of the most likable ever put together.  The disc features four episodes: Autumn, Spring, Winter, and Summer.  (Probably because there are only four, these episodes are slightly longer in running time than previous episodes.)  Among other things, Hugo and Alice start having babies, The Vicar has a romance with Mr. Horton's slightly-slimy sibling Simon, and the town is almost put under water by a dam government dam project.  Also featured is a short episode featuring a cross-over with the popular Ballykissangel series, which was done for the Children in Need charity night.  An extra extra is a surprisingly memorable short documentary about real-life eccentric vicars (including a woman and two male vicars who ride motorcycles).  Overall, the season three DVD of Vicar of Dibley is not-to-be-missed.  It is a funny, heartwarming, sometimes-outrageous show that is unlike anything on American TV.",1299110400,,1091,5.188571428571429

Dawn French is perfect as a woman vicar. At the time the series was first being made, there were only a handful of women vicars in Britain, and her role was meant to get the idea out to everyone in a humorous way. The series was co-written by Richard Curtis specifically for Dawn, and he did a wonderful, wonderful job in bringing out equal rights, religious controversy, village living and jousting among friends and neighbors.

Although I own many TV series on DVD, I go back to this one time and again for fun and relaxation; I never get bored with it.

""Autumn"" - Alice and Hugo return from their honeymoon with some unexpected news, meanwhile Geraldine's romance with David's roguish brother Simon heats up.

""Winter"" - A very pregnant Alice wins the role of Mary in the annual Nativity play by default and causes a furore when she actually goes into labour during the performance!

""Spring"" - Gerry makes plans to establish a creche at St. Barnabus.

""Summer"" - When water shortages threaten the village, Gerry stages a protest against a proposed new reservoir.  Meanwhile, the council members discuss the subject for a possible millennium commemoration statue.
