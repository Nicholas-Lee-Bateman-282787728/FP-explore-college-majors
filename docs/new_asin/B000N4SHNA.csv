8174826,1,B000N4SHNA,"I loved the first four volumes of Legend of the Dragon and was hoping to see the fifth volume, but this volume contains a faulty disc.  In the episode The Hair of the Dog, the volume mutes after a certain point in the episode and never returns until you reach the next episode.  Maybe it's just my bad luck but this is the second time I purchased this DVD volume from two different sellers and the same thing occurred.  Not sure if it is my bad luck or if all these discs are faulty.

It's a shame too because Legend of the Dragon is a very good show that combines Martial Arts, Chinese Zodiac Astrology, Fantasy and Adventure into one wonderful story.  Watch Ang defend the sacred temple of the Dragon and come to the rescue of the other Zodiac guardians who have their sacred powerbands stolen.  He has to do all this with great inner turmoil as he squares off against his jealous twin sister who has turned to the dark side.  Will she ever return to the side of good?  Hopefully, we will find out in this volume.",1375660800,,1015,4.3052631578947365
