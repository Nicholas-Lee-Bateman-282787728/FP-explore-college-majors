4176526,5,B003R4ZMPE,"The writing is smart, engaging, & suspenseful.  But the best part is the multi-layered characters & their interactions. Rizz's mom is hilarious!!  And its really great to see 2 women in a fun, normal friendship without pettiness or competition.  Even the soundtrak is good.  I hope they get ratings!",1284768000,,299,5.040816326530612
4176527,5,B003R4ZMPE,"I actually enjoyed this season finale.  Some of it was a bit predictable, but I still really loved this episode.  I like this show a lot, but I feel that it could be refined just a bit.  In love with Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander, and I think they are great together.

You learn some new things about the Rizzoli family in this episode, you see a bit more of the bond between Rizzoli and Isles (which at times throughout the season you wondered if they were even friends), there is a bit of intrigue as to who is behind everything, there is action and sacrifice and Isles working on someone who isn't dead.

I can't wait for the next season.  Really looking forward to it.",1284422400,3,675,4.317460317460317
4176528,5,B003R4ZMPE,"This show is fantastic! I love the relationship between Rizzoli and Isles. Each episode is a real treat and I highly recommend this show.

If you like this show, you might be interested in reading the books that inspired it. The series of novels is authored by Tess Gerritsen and the first book in the series is The Surgeon.",1282694400,,324,4.491525423728813
4176529,5,B003R4ZMPE,"This show has it all! Comedy, drama, action, and above all Sasha Alexander and Angie Harmon two of the hottest women to ever fight crime on TV. I was so happy to Sasha Alexander return to TV since leaving NCIS where she first caught my eye as super hot special agent. I really missed her on the tube. It is also nice to see Angie Harmon back after seeing her on Law & Order, she is great at playing a tough woman who is also very good looking. This is a very witty show, well written. Good story lines, guest actors, etc...definitely worth watching!",1281484800,3,549,4.288461538461538
4176530,4,B003R4ZMPE,rizzoli & isles is a show that had me all the way until its ending. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this new police drama. It had the right balance of suspense and comedy. Love the strength of the two main characters as well! Everyone needs to see this show!,1281312000,3,263,4.28
4176531,3,B003R4ZMPE,Not a bad show. The acting was about on par with the rest of TNT original programming.,1281139200,,86,4.117647058823529

4176533,5,B003R4ZMPE,"This is a great series. My only issues are with the details of the main characters Rizzoli and Isles. They are not quite the same as the books. Their hair color is switched and although Maura is very stylish in the books, her style is not as flamboyant as the TV character. Her hair is probably never curled and she is definitely not shopping for shoes, online, at work. She is not that into her fashion. Also, the TV character is much more bubbly and carefree vs. the book character of Maura Isles. BUT I LOVE the actresses that they got to play each of these parts. Had I never read the books I would have no indifference towards these TV characters. They are awesome. I just wish they had matched the physical features of each character better and made Maura a little more complex, as she is in the book. They got Jane Rizzoli to a Tee, except her hair, I do recall she is a dirty blond.

BUT as I said before, I LOVE these actresses, very engaging and a lovely stroll down memory lane for me, as an avid reader!",1279756800,,1015,4.259067357512953

4176592,5,B003R4ZMPE,"This series is by far my favorite TV show! It has comedy, suspense, thrilling events, crime scene investigation, quirky moments, realistic and relatable characters and drama. I was introduced to this show by a friend and cannot bring myself to step away from watching episode after episode. (Yes, it is one of those) Rizzoli is an actress from Texas with and Isles is an actress from California, which is well well defining in itself. Two best friends and polar opposite personalities. One is skeptical, straight forward and blunt. The other is inquisitive, knowledgeable, pristine and has a fine taste for the material world. Between their personal life and work life, this series will keep you on your feet or on the floor laughing.",1484784000,,734,4.975609756097561

4176657,5,B003R4ZMPE,"This is one of my all-time favorite crime dramas, not for the storylines or the plot twists, but for the relationship between the two main characters - and for the personalities of the characters themselves. It's so refreshing to see a woman who can kick a** and be witty, sassy, street-smart, and fierce, but still be sweet, sensitive, loving, and funny. (Rizzoli.) And it's nice to have a geeky character (Isles) who doesn't behave like a robot! Their friendship is perfect. The writers completely eliminated the competition, occasional back-stabbing, and awkwardness that pretty much every single female t.v. friendship has and just let them be themselves. The result is a close-knit relationship full of humor, strength, and depth. The bonus - they're also pretty hilarious. And the mysteries are pretty entertaining, too.",1473638400,3,826,5.265151515151516

4176835,5,B003R4ZMPE,I really enjoyed this series as it was well acted and well written. It had enough action to keep me interested but the old standard  formula of family and friends interaction gave a lighter side making it a series that could be followed by a wide rang of viewers. I finished the whole series in four nights and will be buying the next series. It's good honest entertainment made to a high standard. For some one that generally follows British crime drama it was a very pleasant change.,1441411200,,485,4.511363636363637

There are differences between the two that I think make the television series better than the book series, however the books are still worth the read. My only complaint is that the first episode of the series felt a little off and stilted. Overall, the series got stronger with each episode as every actor found their pace and inspiration with their character.

This show manages to blend the dark side of life with positive counter balance.  It takes me back to kind of TV I enjoy.

This show manages to blend the dark side of life with positive counter balance.

It is great to see a show about supportive friendship/family, with its ups & downs, in a way that I can relate to from my experiences with my own friends/life.

At times the writers seem to fall back on the standard formula for police drama, but more often than not, the show keeps a realistic balance of positive and negative.  Most of the story lines are well written; but I always wonder why it is necessary to always throw in a psychotic killer who keeps making appearances.

If less was shown about crazy, psychotic behavior, maybe there might be less of it in real life.  Life has many, many stories that can be told without the vicious, vindictive, crazy, characters being the main focus.

With all that said, Rizzoli & Isles is positively different enough from many of today's TV shows for me to really enjoy watching. it.",1421107200,,1054,4.534391534391534

4177137,5,B003R4ZMPE,"I wavered about buying this show for a long time.  Probably because I had the hardest time getting into the Gerittsen (sp?) novels.  But I have always loved Angie Harmon's work.  Since I NEVER pay full price for the first season of anything (and rarely pay full price for any season after that!) I had a long wait until the price came down enough to satisfy me before I finally bought Season 1.

But this show got us right out of the gate!  I couldn't believe the fantastic chemistry between all the characters but especially between Angie and Sasha.  I think it made a lot of us wish we had a friend like that.  Bruce McGill has always been a favorite of mine as well as Lee Thompson Young ever since his Jet Jackson days on Disney.  No one failed to live up to expectations!  And there were a number of guest stars that were great to see.  Billy Burke from the Twilight series was one that I can name, but there were many others whose names escaped me, but whose faces were very familiar.

I love just about anything set in Boston for some reason, so that was also a plus.  The story lines were great, too.  The Boston Strangler, Hoyt, and one about the Boston Marathon which was bittersweet since the bombings last year.  But each episode was at the very least watchable and fantastic at the most,.

So I just ordered Season 2 and 3, even though the prices were higher than I like.  But based on how terrific Season 1 was, I am confident I'll not regret paying a little more.

Bottom line?  If you love good crime drama, laced with great humor and a cast that can't be beat, watch this show!

Just curious, Amazone: why won't you let me submit this as written?  I got a message that 20 more words were required.  Is this something new?",1398384000,,1738,4.318885448916409
4177138,5,B003R4ZMPE,"I just connected with this series and I was impressed with this first season. What drives me crazy is when writers and directors insert stupid situations in order to create drama. Like when the cops face a criminal with a hostage and the criminal demands the cops throw down their guns and the cops comply. How stupid is that. I haven't seen that with Rizzoli and Isles. Also, there is humor and good chemistry among the actors. The story lines are good and the violence is limited. I've already ordered the second season. So I'll see if the good continues.",1398038400,,557,4.58

The cases that Jane and Maura work in Boston's homicide unit are attention grabbing and suspenseful. What really draws you in to the series the the friendship between Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles. Sasha Alexander (Isles) and Angie Harmon (Rizzoli) have an awesome on screen chemistry that really ties the show together.

4177196,4,B003R4ZMPE,"I am enjoying watching this series.  I like to watch mysteries on the treadmill.  One quibble: in the first show someone wants to kill one of the character and even though her family wants to stay with her to protect her she insists on going out at night and being on her own.  As the romance fans call it, it's a TSTL, too stupid to live moment, and I don't know why writers keep using it as a plot device to build up suspense.  It's a trifle annoying.  Other than that, haven't found much not to like.  I watch these shows when on the treadmill as they are suspenseful",1383696000,2,570,4.18348623853211

4177220,4,B003R4ZMPE,"I think this show is worth watching mainly for the character Jane Rizzoli played by Angie Harmon.  First, Harmon is very easy to look at.  But she is much more than a very pretty cop here.  She plays tough police detective Jane Rizzoli almost perfectly as a tomboy cop who feels totally out of place in a dress.  Her performance is a bit reminiscent of that of Sandra Bullock in the movie Miss Congeniality, which makes her character far from original, but nonetheless Harmon pulls it off very well. Harmon's performance and screen presence carry this show.

The other title character, Maura Isles is played by Sasha Alexander.  I found the Isles character to be a bit inconsistent and hard to relate to, and I am something of a science buff.  But there is definitely room for growth with the character and hopefully that is what will happen in the next season.  The supporting cast was, honestly, pretty forgettable but again there is the potential for character growth there.  The writing was pretty good, although it did not vary much from the standard TV cop fare.

So all in all, I recommend this series just for the fun of watching a quite good performance by the gorgeous Angie Harmon.  I plan to order the 2nd season in the hope that Harmon will continue her outstanding performances and the rest of the show's characters will grow on me.",1379116800,,1346,4.637130801687764

Entire cast works wonderfully together.  You have the murders but there is light humor and street tough attitude.  I find this cast of characters addictive. Found the videos and had to order them.

The two stars and Rizzoli's mom will capture your interest immediately.  You will see hints of Cagney & Lacey, Bones and Crossing Jordan, which makes for a pretty darn good show!

4177284,5,B003R4ZMPE,"There are some things you just cannot teach or even create and one of those is chemistry.  Rizzoli and Isles hit a home run with its lead actresses who as the characters Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles have an exceptional rapport.  They feel real to the viewer and considering the number of cop/medical examiner shows it is hard to separate one from the other.  The difference with this show is that you care about the characters from the start.  Starting off with a very diabolical serial killer and having that run through this season really ratcheted up the tension and the show does a fine job of weaving Jane's fears with her more typical tough exterior.  This character is not just the hard boiled female cop who constantly has to prove herself.  She is seen as an equal among her peers and there is a real affection with her co-workers who prove also to be more than just the typical one dimensional sidekicks that pervade most shows of this type.  Maura Isles could have come off as a rather cold and robotic character given the quirks written within the character, but Sasha Alexander does a great job of humanizing the scientist. Each character on the show has a role and all are allowed to shine.  Jane's mother makes for great comic relief and the family issues in the background of this show are also something that makes the show more than just a solve the mystery scenario.  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1372809600,,1421,4.58498023715415

4177322,1,B003R4ZMPE,"So this is a series based on the Rizzoli & Isles detective novels by Tess Gerritsen. The novels are excellent, deep characters with a good mix of strengths and flaws.  Unfortunately all of the depth and subtelty of the book series is entirely and completely lost on the show.  Where you have two very real feeling characters in dark situations you have replaced by two goofy clowns.  Where the book is very heavily about women's issue such as violence against women, the show kind of glosses over this.  Where Rizzoli is a no-nonsense heroine we get a character suddenly taking murder crime scenes not at all seriously and Isles who is supposed to be a scientist we have her clowning around and hitting on men while she's supposed to be doing her job.  This show couldn't be a further departure from the book series if it was based on a different book series.  I'm not against changes when you move a story to a different media, some of the changes I even liked. Barry Frost in the book is never described as being black or white (that I recall) but in the show he's black and I felt this instantly fit him and was a great idea.  What they did to the main characters was very disapointing.  Actually that's maybe the understatement of the year.

If you've read the books and thought it would be neat to visualize these beloved stories you should avoid the show like it was an infectous carrier of the flu.  If you like amusing romantic comedesque adventures and are not attached to the source material then you might give this show a try.",1366329600,11,1538,4.5

I loved Angie Harmon on Law and Order and this show has a bit of a LAO feel with a funny side and she's the perfect fit.  Sasha Alexander I'm not familiar with but her work on this show is stellar. I love her charaters know-it-all attitude and over dedication to the job, but she's also a caring person and that shows when she interacts with her friend Jane.  I really like Mrs. R and Jane's patner Detective Frost and her brother crack me up especially the episode with the rapper The Heavy Drizz.

I live in England and bought the Region 1 DVD boxed set of the Complete Season 1 because the Region 2 version isn't yet available here and I just couldn't wait any longer - impatience isn't a worthy characteristic  but sometimes, just sometimes, instant gratification is the only solution, simple as that; particularly when it comes to the interaction between the tough, swaggering homicide cop with a heart of pure gold, Detective Jane Rizzoli (Angie Harmon) and her best friend, eccentric, socially maladroit, quirky genius - and Chief Medical Examiner to boot, Dr Maura Isles (Sasha Alexander). Theirs is a partnership made in heaven, not least because the chemistry between the two actresses is quite extraordinary to behold.
Why do I love this show so much? Well, because it's funny, quirky and slightly off-kilter as well as being dramatic and sometimes  scary (the character of Charles Hoyt the serial killer is very, very creepy and unnerving). It's exciting too. And I love to see a show with not one, but two strong, independent female characters, played by two immensely talented and insanely beautiful actresses - you go girls!
For me, the show stands up to multiple viewings because there's a lot going on here, by which I mean that I have rarely seen so much non-verbal communication on-screen between two people as that between Jane and Maura. As an added bonus there is the national treasure that is Lorraine Bracco as Jane's somewhat overbearing but totally loveable mother.
I'm awaiting the release of the R1 set of Season 2 in the US as I shall doubtless do exactly the same thing and snap it up. Season 2 started on satellite tv here just a fortnight ago and I simply cannot wait for 15 weeks to see the whole series! I believe that may be what would be termed in America 'cruel and unusual' punishment. I just call it sheer torture!

Some while back I bought a multi-region DVD player for just this very reason and have not regretted it as it has  come in very handy in the past. Also, the 'Extras' on American DVDs are oftentimes different from our British versions (and sometimes better too). So, no complaints at all about the content. My only grumble is about the rather weird fastener on the plastic container. Mine broke the first time I opened it and now cannot be snapped shut; fortunately the box also came with a cardboard slip cover so that holds it closed.
The service from the seller was very good and the DVD arrived across the pond in excellent time - the wonky box-fastener is the only reason I have not awarded 5 stars. Except, on reflection, that's unfair; Rizzoli and Isles deserves 5 stars, wonky box notwithstanding.
Miss this fabulous show at your peril - you'll be missing a treat, and this may be a rhetorical question, but can it be that Sasha Alexander is the most beautiful woman in the Solar System? I rather think she is......",1328313600,3,2940,4.7251461988304095
4177545,5,B003R4ZMPE,"I love love love this series.  This series brings in the human element that is missing from your long standing hits like Law & Order: SVU and all the CSIs.  Not only is all the crime drama there, the scientific aspect, but we also have the human element...the characters' personal lives.  I believe this is what makes this a hit show.  Jane's match making Ma, Jane's little bro trying to be like his big sis, Maura and Jane's friendship, etc.  You get to see all the past experiences in their lives and how they've been affected: Frost's absent Navy Admiral Dad, Korsack's multiple divorces, Jane's unwanted obsession by a serial killer, Maura's abandonment issues from her adoptive parents.

The chemistry between Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander is fluid and natural and comes through so easily onscreen.  It's rare to have that type of natural connection between the actors/actresses on a show and TNT has definitely found it in these two ladies.

This is one of the few scripted shows I watch!",1327881600,27,997,4.7894736842105265

I liked Sasha Alexander as Kate Todd and decided I'd give her new series a try as well. I think Alexander is as good here as she was on NCIS and Harmon is probably better than she was as the district attorney in Law and Order. It's nice to see a show with women as the leads.

4177601,5,B003R4ZMPE,"I am living outside the U.S. and a bit out of touch as to what is on television currently, so I had never heard of this show. Amazon recommended this to me based on other purchases and I think I also saw previews on another DVD and I am SO GLAD I gave it a try! I am a big fan of The Closer and Castle and this definitely fits in that range for me. It can be gritty, but it is also light and fun.  The lead characters IMMEDIATELY had me after the first episode and the rest of the characters grew on me as the episodes went along (though not nearly so much as the casts of Castle and The Closer--maybe in the second season that will come).

The mysteries are fairly obvious, but it's still fun to see the plots unfold, even if you have figured out what is going on fairly early. Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander have really great friendship chemistry and I think that might be what sells the show for me. I like watching them develop as characters and watching how they grow through their interactions with each other.  The depth of the lead characters makes up for storylines that seem familiar if you have ever watched procedurals on t.v. before and supporting characters who can seem a little flat. A show celebrating two strong women with mutual respect professionally and personally and touching moments of support for each other is fairly unique and definitely satisfying!",1316476800,2,1378,4.438735177865612

I hope the show doesn't price itself off the air in favor of that reality c**p watched by the morons in this country and that is destroying the major networks.  I know the ""reality"" shows are cheap so I fear we will continue to see them proliferate.

Together as friends they catch the bad guys with heaps of slightly off beat humour thrown in.
To add an extra bit of dynamics, you have Rizzoli's loving yet very overbearing Mother, Jane's younger brother Frankie who wants to do everything that she does, her ex-partner Korsak, and her current partner Barry Frost.
This is a very enjoyable show, that I can't help but share with all of my friends and family.

I have clear recollections of episodes of Justified, The Glades, In Plain Sight, and even episodes of Haven, because these shows have a distinct texture. Rizzoli and Isles, although well written, well acted, and visually pleasant, has a vaguely familiar, recycled feel, hence the title of this review.

I recommend this series, with its likeable lead characters, for its smart dialogue and clever mysteries, but it lacks the quirks and emotional hooks that would make it memorable. Unfortunately, the humble-roots copper and the super-nerd side-kick is a little too much like Bones for comfort. Murder in Suburbia or Blue Murder are better distaff who-dun-its, if you can understand British English dialogue, but Rizzoli & Isles is good fun and worth watching, nevertheless.",1312848000,2,894,5.165517241379311

4177666,4,B003R4ZMPE,"I decided almost immediately to buy this item as the cast included some of my favorite actors. The dynamics and chemistry between the characters really ignites. The show also speaks to current modern themes, such as single women seeking both personal and professional fulfillment. The friendship between the two female leads seems true and authentic. The action sequences are also well-done. To its credit, the show is not as scientifically complex as say, BONES, (a show which sometimes, in my view, goes over the heads of the average viewer.) Finally, Bruce McGill and Lorraine Bracco provide solid supporting roles.

However, I do have two criticisms. First, the roles of Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander sometimes seem too cliche. Angie, blue-collar, emotional, blunt, direct, - has a clear dislike for anything too abstract.
Whereas Sasha, - with her upper-class childhood, Ph. D, objective, methodical professional manner with a measured amount of nerdism - has a very reserved personality. Lastly, Angie prefers beer; Sasha, wine. How cliche is that?

It seems to me that oftentimes each of these two characters seem to boxed within the limits I described, to the point of being stereotypes. For this reason I rate the show as 4.5 stars, and not five.

Secondly, there are only ten episodes in this box set. I was expecting 20 plus.

In conclusion, I recommend this show, and would buy the next season. I just hope they give more episodes for the price they are asking.",1312070400,2,1476,5.012244897959183

Too many people commenting on the relationship between Maura and Jane are not paying attention to the friendship they have. Both are obviously interested in men but are very comfortable with who they are and where they are in their lives. Jane, I just love her tough yet vulnerable personality. Maura, is lost in her brain somewhere but loves who she is because she is one of a kind and they appreciate each other because, as a team one couldn't do their job as well without the other. It is GREAT! Just love it! Won't miss an episode.",1312070400,,679,4.44
4177668,5,B003R4ZMPE,"Another new cop show but one with 2 ballsy ladies in the lead.

The writers have done a good job with the two lead characters, establishing good depth and vulnerability to them both. Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander's chemistry develops over the course of the season, You could almost describe them as sisters: both have enormous respect for each other, whilst taking the mickey out of each other (esp Harmon) and having genuine love and concern. Yes, Isles has similarities to Bones but I think she has a softness that perhaps Bones doesn't which has made it easier to develop empathy for her.

The stories are good but perhaps gets resolved too quickly in certain episodes. The fact there is a continuing bad guy that haunts Rizzoli is good and hope he continues in Season 2.

If you like Angie Harmon, you'll really like this show - her character is far more rounded that in her Law & Order days.

Thoroughly enjoyable - can't wait for Season 2.",1311984000,,948,4.625

The actors are spot-on in their performances and the by-play between Angie Harmon (Jane Rizzoli) and Sasha Alexander (Maura Isles) is so perfectly balanced.

I'm a huge Angie Harmon fan anyway and so excited for season 2, but to watch Season 1, in back to back episodes up to the finale is just so intense.

4177682,4,B003R4ZMPE,"Rizzoli and Isles, detective series bringing Sasha Alexander (former NCIS) back into a lead role.

Sadly Rizzoli and Isles lacks the instant interpersonal appeal that NCIS has/had, but certainly a series woth watching, and throughout the series it does consistently build the caracters.

Isles is the ME, Rizzoli the down to earth cop. Isles in a very distant way could be described a little like a cross between Quincy & Bones, just a bit more upscale. Angie Harmon's Rizzoli plays her part well in spite of her rather eccentric Italian family and somehow manages to blend a combination of ""Starsky"" and ""Cagney"" [Cagney and Lacy, not James] into a single individual into a well above average portrayal of the role.

Like any TV drama, it has episodes that vary from throughly excellent to barely believable and a plot mix that changes from predictable to surprising.

All in all decent acting, better than average storylines, reasonable sequencing, quality sets and a relatively believable character set that slowly matures as this first series winds to a close. By the end of the season it was getting to the point of watching two a night instead of one overy other night.

Whatever was behind Sasha Alexander leaving NCIS, this series has the opportunity to put her career firml back on track. I'm curious to see what the next season will bring.

I will probably buy the second series - but it's not a ""can't wait"" affair, definate hint of anticipation though.",1311292800,3,1464,4.883064516129032

would have been an ok review until

the final episode with kindergarden writing: Police headquaters

4177687,2,B003R4ZMPE,"My wife and I purchased the first season from Itunes and was sorry we did. We are fans of both Angie Harmon and especially Sasha Alexander but they both feel terribly mis-cast in this series; the chemistry between Sasha and Angie feels forced. Rizzoli's parents seem equally if not more mis-cast, and I would cringed every time they had parts in an episode. The actual cases that Rizzoli and Isles have to solve seemed very generic (cue the mandatory serial killer that fixates on the main character). We had great hopes for the this show but characters where not interesting enough to keep us watching the generic plots.

4177691,5,B003R4ZMPE,"The good news about ""Rizzoli & Isles: The Complete First Season"" is that it gets Angie Harmon (Law and Order) and Sasha Alexander (NCIS) back on network TV.  The better news, depending on your tastes in police procedurals, is that it plunks the two of them down as mis-matched buddies in the middle of a rather dark, gritty crime drama.

Angie Harmon is Jane Rizzoli, a tough, driven Boston detective who survived an earlier and nearly fatal encounter with a serial killer named Charles Hoyt. She was saved by her old partner, the recurring character detective Vince Korsack (an excellent Bruce McGill).  The edgy Jane has some unresolved trauma issues and a mother (Lorraine Bracco) waiting for Jane to settle down with a nice guy and start making grandchildren.  Jane would rather be just one of the guys.  Sasha Alexander is Dr. Maura Isles, Chief Medial Examiner, organized, strait-laced and often hilariously socially awkward. The two are an unlikely buddy team, but their teamwork and relationship grow steadily over the course of a short season.

This first season is heavy on serial killers, featuring Charles Hoyt and some copy cat killers.  One episode has an intriguing throw back to the old Boston Strangler case.  The season conclusion offers a frightening cliff-hanger, made bearable only by the recent announcement that ""Rizzoli & Isles"" are returning for a second season in the summer of 20ll.",1305590400,88,1409,5.017167381974249

Well, they can't due to DRM. So, although the quality is good, and the playback is flawless, I'm really disappointed since I will also have to buy the DVD release.

To respond to C. Estevez's comment: Good point. I didn't rate the episodes. The casting was great, but the poor writing and re-hashed storylines from Bones really brought the series down. It has potential, and would benefit from stronger, more original writing, and more realistic plots. I did state the video quality was good, and the playback flawless; however, I don't appreciate the false advertising that stated I could back-up the episodes onto DVD.
