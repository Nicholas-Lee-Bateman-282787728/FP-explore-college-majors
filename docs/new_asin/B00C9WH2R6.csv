5708530,5,B00C9WH2R6,"Words can hardly describe how ecstatic I am to see this movie localized with the Funimation dub.
Beautiful art, beautiful animation and beautiful cinematography. A well-rounded and fleshed-out antagonist. Exciting cameos from familiar faces in the One Piece world.
Without a doubt, the best One Piece movie to date.",1404691200,15,315,5.448979591836735
5708531,5,B00C9WH2R6,"I CAN NOT wait to see this film. It's gonna be awesome. It's the 3rd One Piece movie to be dubbed by FUNimation & the 2nd to be personally overseen, or maybe just written by Eiichiro Oda himself, but nonetheless I've heard great things. It's noncanon according to Oda unlike Strong World, but it doesn't matter. I'll have a full review of this movie and the combo pack when they come out, but for now, keep sailing.",1404518400,3,415,4.402597402597403

5708535,1,B00C9WH2R6,I watch allot of anime subbed but I still can't understand and read it same thing with the new DBZ film if its in Japanese and has Japanese subtitle then I CAN'T buy it because i won't be able to watch it. The only reason i give it such a bad star rating is because someone like me who's not bilingual won't be able to watch it.,1379289600,3,328,3.91044776119403

5708538,5,B00C9WH2R6,"My favorite One Piece film of all time. This one has an interesting story, a deep villain, and an awesome song that will go down as one of the best One Piece Songs along with Binks' Brew (Binks' Sake). Also Aokiji (Kuzan) is in this film and he really adds to the story of this film.

5708547,5,B00C9WH2R6,"Just finished watching ""One Piece Z"" released by Funimation.
Still searching for the hidden pirate treasure known as ""One Piece,"" Luffy and the Strawhats are cruising the seas of the New World when they rescue a survivor who is actually an insane former admiral who is intent on destroying the New World in order to put an end to all pirates.
A beautifully animated adventure - note to Zack Newsome - Michael's getting all of my anime dvds and art work, the bad news is that he's going to have to wait at least 30-or-40 years, I  HOPE!
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

5708554,5,B00C9WH2R6,"One Piece: Film Z is one of, if not THE, best One Piece films. I would recommend this film and the Strong World movie to any fan of the manga or anime. If you haven't ventured into the world of Eiichiro Oda's One Piece, however, this film shouldn't be the place to start.

A brief, general summary of the movie is as follows: The Strawhat pirates happen upon a man floating unconscious in the ocean. They rescue and treat him only to discover that he is Z, an ex-marine on a mission to destroy all pirates. Luffy and the Strawhats fight against Z and his crew to reclaim Luffy's treasure and, in the process, halt a plan that could end the New World.

Film Z's plot is simple, but since it is encompassed by the overall world building of Oda's creation, it has a life bigger than its 120+ minutes. Z, himself, is a newly introduced character, but it feels as though he has been involved in the world the entire time. The movie follows a nice pace, balancing humor with action, and the conclusion is built up and executed really well. This is a movie I watched more than once and enjoyed it each time.

The blu-ray version looks amazing during the sections where the budget was a bit more relaxed; in early sections, however, you can tell that it was restricted. Cells of characters from far away are fuzzy and low quality, which the blu-ray's clarity accentuates even more. halfway through, you'll notice these instances lessening, and the final scenes have little, if any, poor quality animation.",1458777600,,1497,4.557620817843866

5708558,5,B00C9WH2R6,"If you are a fan of One Piece, you will lose your mind over this film. The quality of animation is second to none, and is in fact the best animation I have ever seen. The fights are epic, the story is good, and the humor is interwoven flawlessly. The whole cast plays their part in the show, and I could not have been happier. I usually hate the idea of watching a movie twice, but One Piece: Film Z changes that.",1456531200,,413,4.048780487804878

5708569,5,B00C9WH2R6,"When i opened up the package,  i died and wento anime heaven! This item is just beautiful! It contains Kaidou's smasher that can be used as a key holder or u can put it together with the Kaidou stand and make Kaidou's MEMORIAL GRAVE STONE!!! And sings too! It also comes with this booklet that talks about the film itself, some interviews from the cast, character info, etc! This also comes with small stickers of the strawhat crew! To be honest, i thought they were shiny cards and were pretty big but no BUT HEY THEYRE STILL AWESOME!! I would recommend to not use these and to just keep them for yourself. Next is the movie! Ok now to warn everyone, your dvd player or whatever your using must be able to play Japanese discs or else it will not play at all. This is also actually a blu ray film if no one noticed and that also comes with an epilogue and cast interviews on the DVD.the dvds r beautiful with amazing art on the discs. Ok now the big bad news of ALL!!! this is one that everyone needs to be aware about! The bad thing about this is that ITS NOT IN ENGLISH!!! Everything is in Japanese the movie, the figurine, the booklet, everything! But this is also good at the same time cause this means that its original! It wasn't edited or fixed for western countries so it contains everything! I really wish i never unboxed this whole thing cause it was already beautiful all wrapped up and shiny. TvT I highly recommend this to all fans of one piece and that u all enjoy it. Oh and if u choose the correct seller, they'll give u special Tony Tony Chopper tissues as a free gift! I love it so much! Best product ever!!",1451260800,2,1625,4.275974025974026

5708623,3,B00C9WH2R6,"Asked for this as a Xmas present, as I am a huge One Piece fan, and well, it's OK, but it doesn't seem to feel as 'finished/complete' as Strong World or the series itself.  Maybe it's because you end up feeling sympathy for the villian, even if he is a psycho out to destroy the world (feels that destroying all pirates justifies destroying all innocent civilians as well), and you wonder why so many followed him blindly.

Maybe it's because the Navy is shown more sympathetically rather than as the strong arm of the totalitarian World Government that the series portrays...yes, there are good Navy people but overall, they tend more toward being depicted as led by mafia types...so that was a bit jarring, too.

Maybe it was the drawings/animation, where the characters seemed a bit  more chibi than they are in the series, with overlarge hats and buffoonish hair, etc. (even after they changed out of their 'party' outfits, I might add).

Or maybe...maybe it was just because the characters seemed a bit underdeveloped, and by that, I mean the Straw Hats, which is a very odd statement to make and harder to explain, but it just felt like they weren't themselves as much, or more cardboard like...or just perhaps there wasn't a lot of cohesiveness in the storyline and the characters, more a collection of scenes just added in because they might be fun, but even that doesn't quite sound right either since many of those scenes were needed to move the plot forward....

It was just kind of jarring to watch, that's the best I can do in explaining it.  sorry.

Anyway, I love the series and will continue to be a fan, but for this particular one, I likely won't watch it multiple times, as I do with the series collections I have or even Strong World.

5708624,5,B00C9WH2R6,I can't say enough about this movie. Similar to the beautiful style and art work of One Piece Strong World it covers Luffy's new march into the second part of the grand line. Its fight scenes are short and don't show the same type of fighting in the anime series but still a really great buy!!,1420416000,,293,4.25
5708625,5,B00C9WH2R6,I loved it! The fight scenes looked amazing!,1420243200,,44,4.625

5708627,4,B00C9WH2R6,"Really great movie, fans who follow the dub only should be able to watch the movie without too much confusion, but there are spoilers and a character not yet introduced (unless I'm forgetting something). If you've followed the series through subs and have at least gotten up to the time skip you should be good.

Onto the movie itself, it's got a pretty good mix of Straw Hat antics and serious fights, the fight between Luffy and Z is personally one of my favorite fights now. If you are a fan of One Piece BUY THIS MOVIE!",1419724800,,523,4.391752577319588
5708628,5,B00C9WH2R6,"First off, I'm a huge One Piece fan. I'd seen this film online awhile back, but I finally bought this bluray. It looks gorgeous! If you're an OP fan this is an absolute must have. If you're hoping for some extras don't hold your breathe though, it doesn't really have much it that department.",1419552000,,292,4.425925925925926
5708629,5,B00C9WH2R6,"One Piece is my favorite anime so its obvious that I would buy this. I liked this film overall though. I like the new outfits they have in this film. Since this is the first movie after timeskip can't really say if this is the best film.
The best film pre-timeskip would be Strong World for sure.
Own this if you love watching one piece :)",1418947200,,339,4.151515151515151

5708641,5,B00C9WH2R6,"For whatever reason, in almost all the media I consume, I somehow never end up feeling any sympathy for the ""villain"" and if I do it's because it is being forced down my throat by the writers, but boy was my entire outlook shattered when the end credits of this movie rolled by, and I was practically in tears for the so called ""bad guy"" of the story. One Piece is a very niche kind of show simply because of its quirks and JUST how long its been running, but even without having seen previous episodes of the series or movies, this is still a very enjoyable, cute, action packed and emotional movie that any casual anime fan would love. The only other piece of One Piece media I've seen was ""Strong World"" which was great and got me into the franchise in the first place. But where Strong World made me a fan, I can say without a doubt that Film Z made me a Fanatic. Long live the Straw Hats!",1414972800,9,893,4.1976744186046515

5708648,5,B00C9WH2R6,"I'm a huge One Piece fan and this movie only cements my love for this enduring series. While Naruto and Bleach have fallen from grace in recent years with the former set to end this November, It's great knowing that One Piece will continue to kick ass way after those other series have ended.

If you are looking to get into One Piece for the first time, I'd suggest watching all the way until the time skip, but if you are impatient and don't mind spoilers, Film Z won't disappoint.",1414108800,5,483,4.366666666666666

This film has the influences of the original creator Eiichiro Oda with the story and the new character introduced in the film. Great design and all. I would recommend to get the Blu-ray for top quality of the color, animation, and great clean visuals.
