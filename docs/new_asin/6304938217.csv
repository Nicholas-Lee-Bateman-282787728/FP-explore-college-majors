940374,3,6304938217,"Javier Bardem plays ""Victor"" who has been trying very hard to find work to be an actor.  With his agent he has been trying for fifteen months.  While delivering pizza to a company, he realizes there is a room full of phone sex operators.  Since acting auditions are not getting him anywhere right now.  He decides to quit and leave town.  His agent talks him out of it with a big movie company coming to town in a few weeks.  In the meantime, he begins work as a phone sex operator.  His first client is a man.  The hot talk is a success.  Now he tries his business with women clients and in person as well.  This film is spoken in English and Spanish.  Use of yellow subtitles in English is used.  Rated R.",1053129600,3,707,4.1940298507462686
940375,5,6304938217,"This film touches on all the universally modern issues: love, sex, jealousy, money (the lack of it), homosexuality, friendship, and human need for one another.
The plot is to die for. A young, struggling actor,  is  out job and out of luck, but he needs to go on...So, he begins an adventure  that is likely to end with a big mess.
At times, this film feels like a  one man show or a stand-up act; nevertheless,  absolutely all characters  are well-developed and rich: the shady sex-line owner in need of his  over-bearing mother's approval, the dancing girl in need of money, the  plastic surgeon in need of love, the Hollywood lady producer in need of  success, etc.  As it is common in Spanish cinema, colors are very important  in this film: red and black are the main ones. They symbolize passion,  jealousy, crazyness, and sarcasm.
When you start watching this film, you  can sit back and enjoy yourselves. By the end, you are likely to  re-evaluate your opinions about issues raised. You're also likely to have a  blast, in the process.",960422400,20,1043,4.685082872928176
940376,5,6304938217,"I totally love this movie!  The cast, work together so beautifully.  It is about a struggling young actor named Victor who, because of his lack of acting jobs and the need to eat, takes a temporary position as a  ""Phone Sex"" operator!  As luck would have it, his first call,  being supervised by his new boss, is from a Man!  Victor has to summon up  all his acting talents, not to mention his nerve, to sweet talk a caller  without the caller hanging up.  It is just too funny!  Javier Bardem is  adorable as the young actor and Josep Maria Flotats is the vulnerable and  very funny ""Bill"", the homosexual caller.  This movie has many  well-executed characters including, the pervy phone sex manager, a  beautiful caller with a secret who, together with Bill, begin to complicate  Victor's life by involving him in a situation where someone is out to  murder Bill!  It's one of the best Spanish comedies I have seen so far -  Glad I bought it!",949622400,13,944,4.511904761904762

7879554,5,6304938217,"When I watched ""Boca a Boca"" (English captions) twenty years ago, it was the first I realized that Oscar-winner Javier Bardem (""No Country for Old Men"") could do comedy. He plays an unemployed actor who has his bike stolen while delivering a pizza. He has been auditioning (casting directors are a heartless breed!) in vain for months so he decides to go back home. His agent begs him to stay in Barcelona for just one more audition for a ""role of a lifetime!"" that will happen in two weeks.

Director Manual Gmez Pereira swings his actors between farce, romance and violence (yeah, a few gunshots) as a hired killer tries to ""off"" one of our hero's clients. Wait until you see where he ends up working!

Our cast:
  * Javier Bardem (""The Sea Inside"") is Victor, ambitious but broke. A casting director has demeaned him one too many times with a ridiculous audition ('Make 'em Laugh' from ""Singin' in the Rain"" ...in English!) and he just wants to go home. Now he needs to survive for two more weeks.
  * Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (""The Machinist"") Gorgeous Amanda knows all the right moves and Victor loves every one of them! But wait a minute...whose wife is she?
  * Josep Maria Flotats (This was the last movie he made) Bill is Victor's customer. Or is he Ricardo, Amanda's husband? Maybe it's safer back in the closet!

With an R rating, expect  implied sexual situations, some profanity and a gunshot or two. I have re-watched this comedy several times over the years and I am always happy to see Bardem in a comedy. He has done award-winning roles many times since he made this one, but they are all so GRIM! Each new plot twist is a surprise to Victor and to us, but it all gets sorted out...kinda....

I really like this one!",1467504000,,1729,4.54516129032258
7879555,5,6304938217,"I am glad I still have my VHS tapes because I don't think I could afford the DVD of this movie! Watching a young, talented Javier Bardem in a really light-hearted film about sex and deception - lots of entertainment packed in that VHS case. This was the second Bardem film I bought (the first was 'Jamon, Jamon') and he impressed me so much with his comedic talent then!",1381622400,,370,4.3768115942028984

7879558,3,6304938217,"Javier Bardem's excellent career can be divided into two parts: pre-Before Night Falls and post-Before Night Falls.  [Or, maybe more accurately, pre-Julian Schnabel and post-Schnabel.]  Pre-BNF, Bardem was a nice actor known only to Spaniards.  Post-BNF after his stunning breakout as Cuban author Reinaldo Arenas, he's one of the world's biggest stars.  Look at the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Biutiful/dp/B0041KKYF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Biutiful</a>: he carried that heavy thing on his back for well past two hours.

If you're a ardent Bardem fan like me, you dip occasionally into the pre-BNF days to see what the younger version looked like.  That's a hit or miss proposition.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Second-Skin/dp/B000088UZ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Second Skin</a>&nbsp;with the equally talented Jordi Moll was a good catch.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jamon-Jamon-VHS/dp/6304326297/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jamon Jamon [VHS</a>] - once you get over the shock of a very young Penlope Cruz and Bardem teamed together - is a film that hasn't aged well.

'Boca a Boca' is right in the middle.  Neither excruciating nor sublime, it features some of the crazy plot twists and long, increasingly uncomfortable scenes of a sexual nature that mark Almodvar films of that era (Bardem was in two:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Heels-VHS/dp/6302530148/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Heels [VHS</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Flesh/dp/B000059H9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Flesh</a>).  Manuel Gmez Pereira isn't Almodvar, but he does a nice job here with the story and his star: Bardem is likable and winning as always.  And it was a treat to see Aitana Snchez-Gijn as 'Amanda' (cough, cough).  This Italian-born Spaniard has stuck in my mind for a long time after 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-m-Not-Scared/dp/B0002RQ320/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'm Not Scared</a>, one of my all-time favorite movies.",1299974400,,2229,7.634241245136187
7879559,5,6304938217,"Phone sex, seduction, blackmail and murder of comedic proportions starring gorgeous Aitana Sanchez-Gijon and Javier Bardem. I loved this film. All the actors are top notch and the storyline is hilarious full of twists and turns. I especially liked the woman playing Bardem's agent. Highly recommended.",1291420800,,301,5.565217391304348
7879560,4,6304938217,"If you liked Javier Bardem as the stone killer in ""No Country For Old Men,"" then check out this 1995 Spanish sex farce in which he plays actor-cum-phone sex worker who gets into a complicated mess with a male customer, various women, Hollywood producers and assorted criminals. The plotting is complex and the script is fairly sophisticated. It's a lighthearted romp that is quite entertaining.",1254787200,,394,5.076923076923077
7879561,4,6304938217,"Javier Bardem plays Victor Ventura, a young man who moves to Madrid to make it as an actor.  While waiting for his big break, he struggles to make ends meet as a pizza delivery man.  Forced to find a way to make more money, he becomes a phone sex operator.  His first client, a man who calls himself ""Bill.""  Some time later, he is requested by a woman  named ""Amand"" and, during their phone conversation, he immediately falls for her and breaks the cardinal rule of the group: meeting one of the  callers.  After a fantastic night together, she confesses her true reason for calling him and enlists his help to get evidence so she can divorce her husband, ""Bill.""  And, he's just about to get his big break in an American film.  But things are not quite what they seem, and Victor soon finds himself involved in a murderous plot as well as a love triangle.
This is a charming and funny comedy gem from Spainsh director Manual Gmez Pereira.  Javier Bardem does a fine job as Victor and really carried the film.  I had problems with his character immediately falling for Amanda (played superbly by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon).  No build up to the relationship or any understanding why he falls for her.  Alastair Mackenzie does a fine job as the American movie director Oswaldo, though much of the English diaolgue (from other characters) is obviously dubbed and sounds very stiff and unnatural.
Overll, it's a fun movie to watch, and I really enjoyed Javier Bardem's performance.",1082937600,6,1473,4.684824902723736
