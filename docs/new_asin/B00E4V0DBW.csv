5890423,5,B00E4V0DBW,"For fans of Edie Adams, you will be thrilled with the DVD complete release of Edie's very rare one season show Here's Edie, which after the summer break in the summer of 1963, ABC changed it's name to The Edie Adams Show. Edie Adams was the most talented wife of Ernie Kovacs, who upon Ernie's death in a tragic car accident found herself owing huge debts that Ernie had owed to the IRS in 1962. Edie took it upon herself to pay off all of Ernie's debts, beginning with her own television show on ABC, called Here's Edie. Edie produced, hosts, sings, dances, acts, does comedy skits and even designs her own costumes under the name Enke in the show. Edie's design name Enke, was taken from Edie's real name- Edith Elizabeth Enke.

Back in 1962, I had no idea that Edie was such a powerful woman, as Edie was always such a femme fatale as you would see her absolutely beautiful and sexy in the movies and especially in her famous Muriel Cigar commercials. For those of you old enough to remember Muriel's commercials from the sixties, Edie would say, Why Don't You Pick One Up And Smoke It Sometime? in a very Mae West tone, only with a Marilyn Monroe figure. Those commercials must have worked, as I remember every father on my street in the 1960's smoking Muriel Cigars, including my own father. My father having 5 children also liked the 10 cent price, and I even remember Edie singing the song to the tune of Sweet Charity's Big Spender, only with the words- Hey Big Spender Spend A Little Dime With Me. How wonderful that these commercials are on these dvd's, so that we will be able to see them again after so many decades!

Edie Adams who passed away in 2008 at the age of 81, is the reason we have any DVD's of The Ernie Kovacs Show. When Edie found out that so little value was given to Ernie's film archive and that the films were actually being thrown out, she used all of Ernie's insurance policy money and her own money to save what tapes she could. Edie has preserved her husband Ernie's body of television work, and now her son from her second marriage Joshua Mills, is following in his mother's footsteps and is preserving Edie's rare one season show on dvd for all of us fans to enjoy. Joshua Mills and the MVD Entertainment Group have taken the original videotape of all 21 shows and done a new, pristine digital transfer, and I heard it looks beyond fantastic! They are including lots of bonus material as well, including those famous Muriel commercials.

With this fabulous Here's Edie/The Edie Adams Show complete one season, you will be enjoying going back in time to 1962-1964 viewing 12 hours of digitally remastered, pristine shows on 4 discs with so many extras and even a booklet full of family photos! In only one season, this show was nominated for 5 Emmys! The show was like nothing else on television at that time- as Edie had such a variety of guests from big movie stars like Bob Hope, Sir Michael Redgrave, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Buddy Hackett, Terry-Thomas and more. Then she had Jazz Greats guests- Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton, Al Hirt, Woody Herman, Charlie Barnet, Pete Fountain and more. Edie had comedians- Rowan and Martin, Soupy Sales, Alan Sues and more, and singers- Bobby Darin, Sammy Davis Jr., Johnny Mathis, Eddie Fisher, Nancy Wilson and more. She even had classical musicians like Andre' Previn and other guests such as Allan Sherman, Dick Shawn and Louis Nye. Edie had a huge mixing pot that was always exciting and entertaining and worthy of her 5 Emmy Nominations.

Edie also featured regulars on her show which included Mitzi McCall, Charlie Brill, George Furth, Don Chastain and Peter Hanley. After this one season show, Edie went on to other self made jobs besides her movie and television acting- from selling her own cosmetic line, owning beauty salons to almond farms- not only did Edie pay off all of Ernie Kovac's IRS debts, but she became a self made millionaire. One of the most important things Edie did in her career was saving all the Ernie Kovac Shows she could buy for posterity, just as her son Joshua Mills is doing for his Mother's show here. So, for that I have to give a HUGE THANK YOU to Edie's son Joshua Mills and The MVD Entertainment Group for all their hard work to bring us Edie Adams rare one season show digitally remastered with so much bonus material!!

A fabulous 16 page booklet is also included showing rare photos from her family's archive and an essay from Edie's son Joshua Mills.",1378252800,50,7091,4.872305140961857
5890434,5,B00E4V0DBW,"I bought this strictly for the episode with the Great Bobby Darin. Always a 5 star performer. I was not disappointed. But Ialso recommend it for the talented Ms. Adams, her manyother illustrious guest stars, and the kind of variety show that is much missed today.",1393027200,,263,4.739130434782608
5890435,5,B00E4V0DBW,I really enjoyed watching these shows which were on TV when I was a young child. I bought it specifically for the episode containing Bobby Darin as her guest. It was a tour de force. But all of the shows are equally delightful.,1390780800,3,227,4.3023255813953485
5890436,5,B00E4V0DBW,"Until this four-disc DVD set materialized, all I knew about Edie Adams was that she was Mrs. Ernie Kovacs, and that she was the alluring dish in those fondly remembered Muriel Cigar commercials.  Now I have to rethink everything about her.  Edie Adams was, like her husband, a creative powerhouse.  She was a first-class singer/musician, visual and conceptual artist, costume designer and more.  Not only that, she was one of the bravest people I've ever heard of.

Ernie Kovacs' sudden death in a car wreck, in January, 1962, left Edie Adams in inconsolable grief and hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.  You or I would have run for cover.  Not Edie.  By April, she created a live Las Vegas show, and also this musical variety series for ABC-TV, ""Here's Edie."" Not only was she the star performer, but also the costume designer and the co-mastermind in back of every camera angle and stage set.  She co-wrote the script.  She also created the Muriel Cigar commercials.

Thus from start to finish, each of these ""Here's Edie"" shows - at least the first season - are her unadulterated creations.  Thanks to her sympathetic sponsor, the Consolidated Cigar Corporation, she had full creative control, with no network interference.  Thanks to the outpouring of goodwill from the whole entertainment industry after Ernie's death, she had the full cooperation of the greatest stars in show business - Bob Hope, Sammy Davis Jr., Buddy Hackett, Michael Redgrave, Zsa Zsa Gabor et cetera; and even more so, the greatest stars in music - Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton, Hoagy Carmichael, Andr Previn, Nancy Wilson, Johnny Mathis, Spike Jones, Allan Sherman and many more.  And Edie, the artist, made the most of it all.

I have never seen any of these people presented as strikingly as they are here.  There is constant innovation in the camera work, in the use of the new medium of videotape, in the casual absence of the usual proscenium stage, announcer, or any other mediator between the performers and your eyes and ears.  It's first-class Video Art.  No two programs are alike; surprise is the byword. Edie learned well in her TV apprenticeship with the protean Ernie.

Edie herself is the backbone of these shows; she's on camera most of the time and there's so wide a range in her looks, styles of song and means of presentation that one never tires of her, but only wants more.  She had uncanny range as a singer, convincing in opera, musical comedy, burlesque, jazz and, in the first show, Ellingtonian wordless obbligato.  She was a dazzling beauty.

Amazingly, none of these ""Here's Edie"" shows have been seen since they first aired in the early `60s.  The original tapes resided safely in Edie's climate-controlled vault for fifty years, to be uncorked today for our astonishment, looking as fresh and original as TV ever got.

Did I mention the Extras?  Well, there's a ton of them, worth the price of admission alone.  But need I go on??",1389830400,6,2972,4.847222222222222
5890437,5,B00E4V0DBW,I have only watched the first show but loved it. Edie was so talented and lovely. She possessed a voice with amazing range. I loved the vocaless version of my man's gone now with Andre previn. I can't wait to watch the rest of the series.,1389312000,3,238,4.195652173913044
5890438,5,B00E4V0DBW,"I bought the Edie Adams TV Collection and love it. The quality is amazing. I bought it for the show mainly because my favorite singer
Eddie Fisher is on one of the shows. She is amazing. Great guest and performers. No more talent like that around anymore. Thanks for releasing the shows and I just wish more shows from the 50's and 60's would be released like the Coke Time Shows with Eddie Fisher and his later show around 1958 called The Eddie Fisher Show.",1388620800,,458,4.4
5890439,5,B00E4V0DBW,"From the start you will find that Edie Adams has a brilliant haunting voice. All 21 episodes from both seasons are here in it's entirety including many commercials for Muriel cigars. Unlike the other reviews I found that the picture quality was not all that good but got better as the series went on. Maybe it's only my copy but don't let that put you off as this is an outstanding show with many guest stars like Bob Hope,Sammy Davis Jr, Andre Previn ,Johnny Mathis,Duke Ellington Bobby Darin and the United Nations Children's Choir who were so popular with audiences that they appeared three times singing the same song ""Let there be Peace in the World""in different stage productions.
My favourite episodes are from season 1:
 Episode 2 where the show is set in London. How things have changed since then with scenes of Trafalgar Square and the pigeons that used to gather there to be fed by the public. All that is gone as it is now considered unhealthy to be surrounded by these birds and the traffic is barely noticeable unlike today.
Season 2:
Episode 4 where Alan Sherman does the classic ""Hello Mother,Hello Father"" about a boy writing home to his parents to take him back as he does not want to be at holiday camp.
Episode 9 where Edie and her guests perform an outstanding opening number then one of Edie's daughters on guitar accompanying her friend singing the awesome ""What have they done to the Rain"".The friend's voice is outstanding and their harmony blends perfectly. I played this portion back several times.
Episode 12 with Edie joining John Raitt to sing ""There Once was a Man"" from the Pyjama Game. My favourite  song from that movie which starred Doris Day and John Raitt.
Bonus material includes lots of excerpts of Edie singing on the Ernie Kovacs Show,who was also her husband and Sid Caesar doing commercials for cigars as well. These are really funny.
Well done to Edie's son for getting these shows released  to the general public.
A series that can only be described as a masterpiece.",1387238400,4,2013,4.696883852691218
5890440,5,B00E4V0DBW,"I never dreamed that a sixties television variety show could be termed ""a work of art"", but, so help me, here it was playing out before my very eyes. Edie Adams (in addition to being a great entertainer) had class and good taste. It's all revealed here in this remarkable collection of programs.

You'll love this.

5890441,5,B00E4V0DBW,"Okay here I was ready to post my five-star review of this new DVD set and then I read Tante Marens exhaustive review. While it appears that Tante posted his review based on not have actually seen the set yet (based on the date of his review), he certainly described all the details and so I won't waste you time in rehashing that but will add some additional info while giving it the five star rating it deserves based my actually watching the set.
As you probably know by now,  the set was produced by Adams son Josh Mills (from Adams second marriage  after her first husband  Ernie Kovacs  died). Mills is also responsible for the two multi-volume Ernie Kovacs DVD sets and keeps both Kovacs and Adams names alive.  Adams had her own production company and recorded all her shows. That gives Mills the access to reissuing these. If you got the Kovacs Collection DVDs you were probably as prostrated as I was to see that many of the shows were not complete  Adams songs were excised, except for some public domain material. Thats because of rights issues and licensing is prohibitive. This was not the case of the Adams shows and they are here complete. As bonuses you even get to see and hear songs from the Kovacs shows. And yes, all the Murial cigar commercials are here too.

The black and white images (in the 4:3 standard ratio  view it that way, not full screen if you have a flat screen TV) are really nice. It is funny to see the primitive way that, even network shows, ran the credits. (Didnt we get headaches watching them them?).

The booklet enclosed helps select which shows had which special guests  and some of the biggies are there too! You can tell there was love and care in putting this set together by Mills and his co-producer Ben Model and the project should certainly be supported. Edie Adams was  along with Lucille Ball  one of the first TV stars to take control of their shows. Maybe with this set shell get the recognition she surely deserves.

I hope this review was both informative and helpful.

5890442,5,B00E4V0DBW,"It's exciting to be able to see an entire TV series for the first time in decades, especially one with such a rich entertainment history behind it. This series was never, ever able to be seen after its original airing, as the episodes were stored in a vault until Edie Adams' son Josh lovingly put them together--along with lots of choice extras--on this astonishing 4-disc set. Astonishing because it exists for us on DVD and we can enjoy its wonders now.

The guest list alone is staggering: Sammy Davis, Jr., Bobby Darin, Peter Falk, Sir Michael Redgrave, Don Rickles, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Sid Caesar, Nancy Wilson, Al Hirt, Bob Hope, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Louie Nye, Soupy Sales, Spike Jones, Buddy Hackett, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton and several visits with up-and-coming comedians like Dick Martin, Dan Rowan, Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill. A roster of this level makes the show like The Ed Sullivan Show without the spinning plates.

But Here's Edie, or later, The Edie Adams Show, is as different from variety shows of its day as Kovacs' shows were from comedy shows. First of all, Adams had complete control of the show, rare for many performers, especially females, in those days. So every episode is a personal reflection of the artist herself: a classically trained soprano who had a grasp of popular entertainment as well as an acute intelligence, sensitivity and eclectic sense she was eager to present.

When Here's Edie was broadcast from April 1963 to March 1964, audiences and industry insiders knew the headlines about her situation well. Kovacs' passing left behind a labyrinth of debt. Live concerts and this series were literally Adams' most visible means of support and recovery. Her devotion to Kovacs is evident in the occasional use of blackouts, which were still unusual until the dawn of Laugh-In.

The feeling we're about to see something unusual is evident from the first moments. Adams, in silhouette, trills her Kurt Weill theme music a la the Star Trek theme (in the next season the show would open with the same trill but the visual becomes the more familiar caricature that some may remember from Adam's chain of salons).

I wish there would have been more information about some of the regulars who appear. Don Chastain, who played the husband on the short lived Debbie Reynolds Show, sometimes is mentioned as a guest. Speaking of Chastain, he flubs the lyrics to ""Put On a Happy Face"" and it stayed in the show--a lost charm of early television that humanizes the performers and draws them into the show. Adams often pauses before her cues and sometimes seems uncomfortable in the comedy sketches--but not in the ones that were part of her very popular nightclub act and any others in which she could disappear into character.

It's to her credit that she didn't overpolish the shows. Time and budget was a factor, surely, but the audience of the early `60s was rooting for her all the way. ""I decided that there wouldn't be much comedy in my television shows because I still wasn't feeling very funny,"" Adams wrote in her autobiography, Sing a Pretty Song. ""I was afraid to do comedy unless I had a comic editor nearby, and Ernie has always done that for me.""

Among the many standout segments in the series include a moody filmed New York segment set to the song ""Lonely Town;"" the marvelous London location sequences, particularly a haunting scene in which Adams sings in front of a bombed-out block of buildings; and a rendition of ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" told with a series of stills showing a day in the life of the singing star (even the unglamorous parts).

If you have a problem with smoking, close your eyes, cover your ears and hum Adams' theme song during the Muriel/Dutch Masters cigar commercials, one of them featuring a young Conrad Bain.

The Here's Edie DVD set captures a dazzling period of show business over which a curtain was drawn, almost to the day of the last show. The Beatles had appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show a month earlier and the youth movement would change entertainment markedly. Coincidentally, Here's Edie/The Edie Adams Show begins and ends with comedy bits poking fun at rock and roll: in the first episode, comic Dick Shawn lampoons a rock singer of the period and in the last show, Adams and her guests lampoon the mop-topped Beatles. So many thought that this new music was a passing fad, and these sketches are examples. Of course, history would prove otherwise.",1384819200,17,4453,4.8180628272251305

THE EPISODE PLAYS AS POORLY ON AN ONLINE STREAMING PROVIDER AS ON MY DVD PLAYER ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A DAMAGED DISC. I APPRECIATE OLDER SHOWS LIKE THIS MAY HAVE VISUAL FLAWS DUE TO AGE, AND I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS THE FAULT OR IT IS DUE TO POOR DVD ENCODING OR SLOPPY MACROVISION ANTI-COPYING TECHNOLOGY; BUT WHATEVER THE CAUSE AN OTHERWISE VERY INTERESTING EPISODE OF THE SHOW WAS RUINED. SO MY SUGGESTION IS IF YOU CAN VIEW IT ONLINE DO SO INSTEAD OF THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY AS I DID ON THE DVD SET.

These shows are simply nothing like I have ever seen on TV before.  The breadth of styles, the extreme quality of the performances,  the visual, beauty, subtlety, and elegance of these programs far exceeds even the high standards of the era.  ""Here's Edie"" was pure Edie Adams.  She had complete creative control, not only over the show but the commercials.  I know I will watch these again and again.",1446249600,,550,4.494949494949495

8601149,3,B00E4V0DBW,"Not quite what I was hoping for, Miss Adams is a fine performer but she really lacks in being able to ""host"" her own show. She has no small-talk banter with guests and could at least acknowledge that there is an audience (even though sometimes it was shot in a soundstage) when the applause dies down (fake or not). This lack of personable behavior makes her come off as too cold, which in real life she was not.  Guests that are musical are great, and Rowan and Martin really stand out.",1416787200,,487,4.351648351648351
8601150,5,B00E4V0DBW,"This series was completely unknown to me.  I never watched it when it was on.  I have no memory of it what so ever.
I love Ernie Kovaks and I bought this just because I read that there were a few clips of him in this set.
I always liked Edie Adams but except for her Kovaks connection, the Muriel commercials and her role in IT'S MAD MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD I was never aware of the huge talent that she was in her own right.
I was so pleasantly surprised at how well these episodes play now and how much this Rock N Roll fan did enjoy what I was assuming would be the ""square"" music of Miss Adams.  She is nothing like Eydie Gorme.  For some reason, I was thinking Edie would be similar.  Gorme was stuff my parents liked and I thought was very un-cool back in those days.  Folks, this is VERY cool stuff, indeed.
Edie does some great classical stuff and I really like her singing quite a bit.  I didn't think I would watch more than one of these to get an idea of the show.  It turned out that I enjoyed every episode.  Especially the first season of themed shows.
Kudos to Ben Model and the others involved who have brought this gem back from oblivion and into my hands.",1405209600,4,1171,4.100877192982456

If your into the celebrities of the day such as Count Basie, Sammy Davis Jr and Bobby Darin and more, this may be right up your ally.  If you can keep in mind that the tapes are over fifty years old and may show some wear as well as it being in black and white you will enjoy a nostalgic trip to the past because that is part of its charm.
