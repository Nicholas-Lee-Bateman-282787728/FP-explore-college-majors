8249564,5,B00139YZO4,"I am an aspiring 53 years young martial artist who heard of Ms. Marks' talent through a mutual karate friend.  After viewing some of her work on the YouTube it was a no-brainer to order her instructional video.  The setting of her lessons is beautiful and she is patient and thorough with her presentation.  I think she remembers what it was like to start out using a weapon and learning to co-ordinate everythnig to keep from hitting yourself in the head.  I would surely recommend this video to anyone wanting to learn some bo staff moves and will probably order order of her videos (if available) as my skills advance.  Thank you, Casey Marks:  I'm a fan!",1371945600,2,658,4.581196581196581
