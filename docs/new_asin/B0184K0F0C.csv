Just as Topical  Today as  when it was made in the late 70s",1468454400,5,126,4.434782608695652
8741408,5,B0184K0F0C,"I was VERY excited to find that another one of Elizabeth Montgomery's movies has been officially released on DVD, although I feel the $25.00 price tag is a bit pricey.  This is an official release.  Elizabeth plays Catherine McSweeney, a single mother of a son who works as a journalist and lives in an apartment building.  One night after taking a cab home she is assaulted in her building.  She then keeps reliving the event in her mind and becomes very frightened, especially when one of the attacker comes after her again.  The movie had me on the edge of my seat really feeling for the character and being frightened right along with her.  Great film and good ending.",1455148800,7,672,4.605042016806722
8741409,5,B0184K0F0C,"Although amazon does not mention the studio that released this dvd, this is an official, authorized dvd release by CBS Home Entertainment. The quality is excellent, and I'm so glad that another one of Elizabeth's TV movies has made it's official dvd debut!

The story stars Elizabeth as an unbiased TV news reporter, who is a single mother living in San Francisco. One night, while entering her apartment building, she is brutally beaten and nearly raped by a street gang.

After this incident, Elizabeth becomes agoraphobic, and she agrees to do a TV interview with the network she works for. On the televised interview, she admits that the attack has turned her into a racist (because her attackers were not white). Obviously, after that, Elizabeth must face the community backlash.

....Elizabeth is very beautiful, and still looks as she did as Samantha on ""Bewitched"" in this 1979 TV movie. Anyone who enjoys dramatic TV movies, or any fans of Elizabeth, will be happy to have this excellent-quality dvd.",1449964800,14,1009,4.994047619047619
