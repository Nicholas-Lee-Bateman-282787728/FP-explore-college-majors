8342900,4,B001U5WWK0,"Very good DVD if you're looking for an introduction to softbait or finesse fishing tactics. The underwater videos show how the baits perform under water and how fish react to them, and can be considered a reason to buy the DVD by itself. I can tell the Lindner's love fishing and are good teachers.
There are other resources when you're ready for the details. See particularly the Bass Pro's TV series compilation DVD's. Like the written word better? In-Fisherman's website contains a library of information.",1250467200,4,508,4.988235294117647
