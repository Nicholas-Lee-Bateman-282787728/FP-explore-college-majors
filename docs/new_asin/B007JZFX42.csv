5091953,4,B007JZFX42,"Glad to see this coming out after all these years. I had this concert in Beta Max back in 1982. It was originally titled ""The Strange Case of Alice Cooper."" Alice looks very pale and skinny as this was shortly after his release from the clinic for his alcohol abuse. The opening song ""From the Inside"" features dancing bottles of vodka,scotch and tequilla. Typical of Alice's sense of humor. It features several songs from that excellent album. It's the only time I've seen Alice electrocuted on stage. It was also cool to see Davey Johnston from Elton Johns band as lead guitar. The show features songs that Alice doesn't do live anymore along with his classics. For all of Alice fans, buy this dvd.",1334448000,23,700,4.653225806451613
5091954,3,B007JZFX42,"I had tickets to see this show in NYC when suddenly Alice cancelled the entire tour.  After finally seeing this in the mid 80's I can understand why.  Alice looked awful... too thin and sickly.  Ironically he was supposed to be 100% healthy after his stint drying out in an asylum for alcoholism!

His voice is the real disappointment.  He sound terrible.  Basically talk-singing the songs, not even trying to his high notes.  Decades later Alice sounds 1000 times better live than he does here!  but ti does contain the only live versions of ""The Quiet Room"" and ""How You Gonna See Me Now"" (which being his current single he does indeed put some effort into singing).

Not quite road ready.  Should have rested as bit more.  For major fans only.",1445904000,,746,4.6183206106870225

5091958,3,B007JZFX42,"Decent audio, decent video.  Not bad for a 1979 show.  Always thought From The Inside was sort of Cooper's last good album.  Really nice to be able to view a concert from that tour.  Although, by this point, Cooper was heavy into the theatrical side (with less emphasis on the music).  The band is good...but the performance comes off more like a Vegas-act than a rock concert.  Still worth it for any Cooper fan.

Note: the bonus commentary material is a sad joke.  It's just Alice talking over the concert footage and making comments here and there.  Weird.",1424304000,,559,4.622448979591836

5091961,4,B007JZFX42,"I was only too excited to find that this had been released on DVD. Years ago I had thought about buying an, old VHS copy offa Ebay but i'm glad I waited.
 I remember seeing this on Showtime when I was a kid.......had NO idea what was going on! So going back 35 years later and seeing the dancing bottles and the stretch limo was far more entertaining this time around.
 However, poor Alice, straight out of the loony bin couldn't sing to save his life! Poor guy is winded on the simplest of songs....when he could be bothered to recall the proper lyrics. Thankfully as he dried out, in further years he would get much better at that. ( see The Nightmare Returns). But this was Alice circa '79, warts and all.
 I had seen that this release included commentary by Vincent Furnier ( hope I spelled that correctly) that I was really looking forward to hearing but apparently Vince was just as enamored with watching the video as I was....he doesn't say a whole lot except maybe, ""Ah, that's Billie Jean Quean...."" So don't look for too much insight into the madness that was back in the day ( Vince probably doesn't remember too much anyway, so.....)
 Over all though, it's a cool disc to have. Maybe someday Alice will go back and redo this whole show ( hint hint).",1412121600,,1262,4.426724137931035

5091966,5,B007JZFX42,Alice has always been one of the best. In this one he fights the demons of alcohol. He seems still a little out of it.

5091970,5,B007JZFX42,"Well he stared it all.  From the Glam rock of Bowie to the huge commercial success of Kiss.

 Probably at the apogee of his career, as far as vocal ability and creative juices.  The live line-up is amazing and with the addition of the much underrated Davey Johnstone, this is truly a winner for any Alice fan or rock fan of the late 70's and early 80's.
  Although Alice wastes his 'one of the greatest rock voices'  by talking lyrics instead of singing them, it is still a top-notch performance.

  The musical interlude at the half way break is outstanding.  Johnstone shows his metal chops and pulls off some great shreading.

  While watching this though, I suggest selecting the Alice comments feature.  His overviews are very funny and it fills any lulls in the production.  Its also amazing listening to this 'normal joe' commenting on his alter-ego performing.

Hopefully, Alice has many more years to entertain us.",1387584000,,923,4.777070063694268

5091976,4,B007JZFX42,Ok the sound and picture quality isn't that great. This is probably just how it was filmed. On the other hand this is a classic Alice show that a older fan shouldn't miss. One of his best stage shows and bands in my opinion. Too bad not a cleaner copy but this is all we have from this tour. Worth checking out.,1360022400,,311,4.032258064516129

5091978,4,B007JZFX42,"This performance, comes from the tour that Alice Cooper celebrated in 1979, after the ""From the Inside"" album. It's a small jewell in Alice Cooper path that illustrates his recovery with alcohol adiction (first step), and the beginning of a new era for Alice. In next years he will record several albums almost autobigraphical: ""Flush the Fashion"", that celebrates the 80's ; ""Special Forces"" (Flush the Fushion mark 2); "" Zipper Catches Skin "" and ""Dada"". Therefore, and as his author afirms, this is one of his more theatrical performances, overcoming even to ""Welcome to my Nightmare Tour"". There are dancers on the stage, giant bottels, etc. But the center of the focus is for its main character, Alice Cooper. Well recorded and with very good sound, Alice assembled his most musically articulate band with the presence of Steve Hunter specially for last dates of the tour. Recommended for Alice Coper fans as well as for classic rock music.",1352419200,,945,4.949685534591195
5091979,5,B007JZFX42,"This was my first [real] concert, as I remember it well, as the Babys opened for Alice. I also recall this was the very first full-length concert video I ever got to see on VHS. The tour itself - was subtitled as the 'Madhouse Rock Tour' - as I don't believe I've ever seen seen Alice so thin. Although this show has it's flaws, I feel it truly deserves a five-star rating because the picture quality has been so well preserved. Through the years, I've had a couple of bootleg cassettes of this particular Alice Cooper tour - but rest assure that 'Strange Case' certainly deems all those bootlegs now completely obsolete. Just wish it hadn't taken so long to have this gig to get a legitimate release. 'Strange Case' was notably the only Alice Cooper trek that featured Elton John guitarist - Davey Johnstone. Loved seeing Uncle Alice bring songs from his (then) current lp 'From The Inside' to life - like the opener ""From The Inside"" (with six-foot tall dancing whiskey bottles), ""Serious"", ""Nurse Rozetta"" (with a sexy nurse), ""The Quiet Room"", the upbeat ""Wish I Were Born In Beverly Hills"", his sappy ballad ""How You Gonna See Me Now"" and the humorous ""Inmates (We're All Crazy)"". Nice to see ""Ballad Of Dwight Frye"" performed as it fit right into this show. Plus, I noticed that the shorter-than usual version of ""School's Out"" did possess a certain 'rawness' to it. Highly recommended.",1349827200,,1392,4.709016393442623
5091980,1,B007JZFX42,"I am so sorry I waisted our money on this, it came in good time but was not what I remeberd for so long ago, my fault. I will not buy Alice Cooper ever again.",1342569600,,158,3.5428571428571427
5091981,4,B007JZFX42,"From The Inside is one of my favorite Alice Cooper albums and it could only have come out in the late 1970s where his alcoholic excesses reached the breaking point.  His excess was shared with a lot of his other contemporaries at the time, but Alice took a bold step and put himself out there with a level of honesty (and real life horror with the people he met in rehab) that could only be equated with say someone like Joe Walsh on Life's Been Good.  From The Inside wasn't a big seller and apart from having a big hit with How You Gonna See Me Now, it was for his die hard fans only and not for the casual fans.

But this document of his 1979 Madhouse Rock Tour is great even though there are some video glitches along the way.  The only real DVD bonus is Alice's commentary.  I know that a few of the performances (Welcome To My Nightmare, From The Inside, No More Mr Nice Guy and How You Gonna See Me Now) have appeared in better resolution on the Prime Cuts DVD.  The DVD as a whole is a good period piece of Alice Cooper in 1979 and where musical and fashion trends were going at that time.  It is full of theatrics, good twisted humor and good musicianship featuring Elton John's guitarist Davey Johnstone who guested on the tour.  I hope that somewhere in the archives (whether it is Warner/Rhino or Shout Factory) that there is an impeccable film master of this show that one day could see the light of day.  It is unfortunate that many rare performances of other classic artists have not been properly archived so many fans often get good, but flawed technical visuals.  But all in all it is still a very enjoyable DVD performance even though the video is basically the best ""as is"" available footage.",1342310400,4,1712,4.355345911949685
5091982,3,B007JZFX42,the sound and video are poor. I saw this concert in the 70s and remember it being better than the video. Other than that I am glad Alice got his act together and is still here to perform. Thanks Alice.....,1342051200,,205,4.15
5091983,5,B007JZFX42,My husband is a dedicated Alice Cooper fan.  He loved this and stated that this is Alice Cooper being the real Alice Cooper.  Not the watered down version.,1341705600,,155,4.5
5091984,3,B007JZFX42,"From the Inside is one of my favorite albums by Alice after the original band broke up, and he went solo, so I am glad to see this show finally on DVD.  It is a different stage show, more dancing than others, and some of the songs were not performed again after this tour.  The instrumental/dancing segment during the first song (On the Inside), has always been alot of fun.  Alice's voice on certain songs (I Never Cry, The Quiet Room, How You Gonna See Me Now), doesn't sound right to me.  His phrasing and tone is very different from the studio recordings.  It is a fun concert though, and Alice's onstage banter during School's Out and the band intros is terrific.
As others have said, the video and audio quality is not as good as it could be.  It's watchable, but I was expecting better.
The only extra on the DVD is Alice's commentary and it is sparse as other reviewers have written.  He talks about bit about the band and makes other comments, but says very little about how the show was developed. His wife, Sheryl, is the lead dancer in the show and helped choreograph it.  She should have been included in on the commentary.
I'm a hard core fan so I'm glad I picked this up, and it is low-priced.  If you are new to Alice Cooper, you might want to track down one of his newer DVDs, like Theatre of Death.",1340236800,5,1316,4.317073170731708
5091985,3,B007JZFX42,"This dvd is good to own if you are an Alice fan so you can finally get this show on dvd, and see what his show was like on this tour. But, the show is not great, and the band played the songs less heavy in the late 70's. Alice also doesn't sing great. Alice's newer dvds better for casual fans. The commentary is also not great. Alice doesn't say as much on here as he does on other dvds, and he repeats some of the things he says on the ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" concert. The film quality was good.",1339632000,3,499,3.9504950495049505
5091986,3,B007JZFX42,"Count me among the many waiting patiently for this to finally be released on DVD.  Was it worth it?  Well, yes & no.  First off, the picture is clearer than the bootleg copy of this that I found a few years ago, so that's a definite plus.  But the soundtrack is where this release fails.  The audio for this show was multi-tracked and broadcast on various radio concert shows, the King Biscuit Flower Hour being one of them.  I've downloaded copies of these radio shows, and they are in excellent, clear stereo, with the 2 guitars mixed on opposite channels (so you can really hear who's playing what), the drums separated, etc.  This soundtrack seems to be in mono, and is probably straight off the copy that was made for TV broadcast, which is what I believe this show was originally filmed for (at least it was shown on TV back then, as I remember watching it).  Wolfgang's Vault now owns the King Biscuit library, so the producers of this release should have worked a deal with them to get the audio. (To add insult to injury, the back of the DVD case says, ""NOTE: Vidoe and audio were mastered from the best available sources."")

And of course, there are the missing songs and a few other edits, but I didn't really expect the original footage to be assembled & re-cut after all these years.

I would say that all this release did was take the TV copy and transfer it to DVD, edits and all.  There is even one spot where the picture tracking flutters, as old VHS tapes would do (I think it's during 'Wish I Were Born in Beverly Hills'?).

Alice's commentary is sparse, as other reviews have mentioned, which is a shame, as this is a very interesting point in his career, and a very unique show.  I'm sure he must have more to say about it!

All in all, worth having, since it hasn't been available in any form for many years, but it's too bad they didn't get it right.  Maybe some day...",1338163200,19,1892,4.3810888252149
5091987,5,B007JZFX42,"I've seen this before - I have it on VHS, but this looks (and sounds) much better than the old tape.  It's a well-played show, video and sound quality are both quite good for the time it was filmed. Alice's commentary is fun, too...  A must have for Alice fans!",1337904000,,261,4.2
5091988,4,B007JZFX42,"This concert is pretty much like the original VHS that came out at that time. Only edit I notice was ""School's Out"" encore was edited down a bit. I believe the VHS it was close to 15 or 18 minutes long. I didn't mind that being shorten at all. Alice was pretty amazing during this show he seemed to be changing lyrics during some of the songs. Reminds me of the old Popeye cartoon when Popeye starts mumbling to himself. Check out ""I'm Eighteen"". As some others noted they wished ""All Strapped Up"" and ""Dead Babies"" which I have on a bootleg audio were not included but I believe Shout Factory just copied the original VHS. It seemed no one really took time to add extras or even try to pursue some added bonuses for the fans. I think if Alice's assistant (the late) Brian Nelson was around he would of gave us some vintage material. Since he was one of Alice's biggest fans and knows what the fans are looking for.
As for the commentary I have to agree with some others who say Alice plays off better if someone else was viewing it with him. Alice needs a co-host to banter with like Hunter, Cheryl, or Shep. This concert is good it's just pretty much like the VHS of old and no added attraction. As for sound I don't have a special stereo or soundaround I just have my faithful Magnavox TV.",1337904000,3,1292,4.299180327868853
5091989,4,B007JZFX42,"Over the years I've seen many various consumer treatments of this show.  Finally someone has taken the care and time to get it right.  The show is blistering, but edited.  But all versions I have seen have been edited.  It doesn't help I guess when School's Out runs 15 minutes, but many great parts of this show have always been on the cutting room floor.

The main reason I got this was for the fact that I knew I would finally have a clean copy and also for the Alice commentary.  If you watch the Nightmare show with commentary on, it was almost a laugh a minute.  Ren (RIP) certainly added significant contributions to the commentary.  So, it is with surprise that I say that the commentary on this DVD was a big snooze.  The biggest insight Alice offered in the commentary was information on who dated whom.  He really should have had someone else in the room with him, maybe Shep or Cheryl.  She was as huge part of this show.

Even with this flaw, it is a great show and a must see for Alice fan.",1337558400,10,1004,4.281914893617022
5091990,5,B007JZFX42,Finally one of the last lost treasures from Alice comes out. Get to see a lot of songs from one of his most underrated albums From The Inside live. I was dying for this to come out and just pre-ordered it. Now if he would just release Welcome To My Nightmare TV Special (not the concert thats already out) he did that would be great. At least Alice realizes that hardcore fans of his want old stuff to come out. I can't stand bands that only release thier new concerts.,1337472000,6,469,4.222222222222222
5091991,4,B007JZFX42,"One of things that I am looking forward to is Alice Cooper's commentary, which is usually insightful & funny.  After seeing ""Good To See You Again Alice Cooper,"" your new favorite song will be ""Dust in the Horsey's Eye,"" for the reasons mentioned.

I hope to find a new ""Dust in the Horsey's Eye"" in this DVD!",1334966400,2,309,4.4035087719298245
5091992,5,B007JZFX42,"I am so excited that ""Strange Case of Alice Cooper"" is coming out on DVD. I have seen many poor recordings on TV, internet and VHS, and have long stumped to the Alice people that this needed to be added to DVDs. The show was the tour for ""From the Inside"" which Alice recorded following his stay in rehab. Only there was no such thing as rehab, it was a mental institution and the album, and subsiquent show is based on the people he actually met while getting control of his alcohol problem. In it you can see in his face and lack of weight some of the illness that was part of his struggles with demon rum...or in his case Bud and 7 Crown. Some great additions to this is his attention to making this a production of the album which dominates the set list, but still some of the great classic Coop to go with it. The new songs were co written by Elton John sidekick, Bernie Taupin and the band includes John side man Davey Johnstone on guitar along with Steve Hunter, who rejoined Alice on last summer's tour, bassist Parkish John, Whitey Glan on Drums and keyboard wizard Fred Mandel whose credits also include Cheap Trick, Queen and Pink Floyd (The Wall). Alice's wife, Sheryl Cooper is the lead dancer in the company, a job thet she got for ""WTMN"" and lead to the romance that lives on today. You also have an important guest appearance by horror master Vincent Price. The fact that Shout Factory is in charge of the release, raises my expectations at a quality item as they have a reputation to treating the work and resterations with the greatest respect. If you want a grand night of rock and roll entertainment, this will be one to have in your collection. I have collected all of Alice's DVD concert releases, and I look forward to adding this to my collection immediately.",1334793600,16,1783,4.439024390243903
5091993,4,B007JZFX42,"I remember seeing this on Australian tv back in the early 80s. Fortunately a mate of mine had a VHS video recorder at the time and taped it from the television. He was one of the first to have a video recorder back then, so this concert that he taped was worth more than gold in my eyes. A few years later, i eventually got a video recorder and copied it off my mate. I played the video over and over again. The 1978 album From The Inside is possibly my favorite Alice cooper album (and i have them all) and so it`s great seeing many of the songs from that album performed here live. I agree with the other review on here about how skinny alice looks in this video. However, i don`t think his stay in rehab back then was the main reason why he lost alot of weight and why he looks so skinny in this 1979 concert. I think Alice`s time in rehabilitation in 1978 didn`t help him that much. He may have cut down or even briefly stopped drinking, but he could have been using other things in 1979 such as speed and/or cocaine. By looking at the way Alice is performing here on stage, he definately looks like he`s been affected by speed or cocaine use. His liver was still in a bad way back in 1979 due to the past alcohol abuse, so maybe he was using cocaine here as an upper substitute for alcohol. It is also well documented that Alice had to again go back into rehab in the early 80s because he started drinking, and maybe took substances, again. I personally think that this rehab thing is a bit of a con. Many people i know who drank heavily and took drugs never went to rehab. They just basically stopped their bad habits, on their own, when they reached a particular age, which was around 39 years old. I also knew others who went into rehab when they were in their 20s and that didn`t help them either. Yet, again, when they reached their late 30s, they just automatically stopped their bad drink and drug habits. Anyway, as with alice also, after he got out of rehab the second time, he was in his late 30s by then and this time he finally stopped all his bad habits. Did rehab help him the second time round? Or did his body just finally decided on its own that it was now time to stop all substance abuse? All my friends will tell you, no way does rehab help, but growing up and maturing is the main reason for helping to stop bad habits. I`m so glad that Alice did finally stop all substance abuse because after he came out of rehab the second time round in 1985, he again started making great albums and still does to this day.

8518548,3,B007JZFX42,"I was so happy when I saw the set list. Finally, a DVD of the ""From The Inside"" (My favorite record of his) tour. Sad thing is, is that when Alice went to the mental hospital for alcohol, he got out and did From the Inside. He was sober, but not clean. You can tell he's coked up on this show and it's hard to watch. He's so fast and running around, he barely has breath to sing. I love Alice and I'm glad I have this snippet of history, but I would like to see that album performed without any drug/alcohol interaction.",1455840000,,520,4.058252427184466
8518549,4,B007JZFX42,"I like it purely on the back of Alice's track record and it follows his ""On The Inside"" studio album which was one of his best albums which included some seriously talented musicians. I was disappointed the musicians from the studio album did not play on the live shows and the recording is not great. Alice was quite intense on stage which I felt detracted from his vocals. But it's Alice so its gonna be enjoyable.",1450137600,,416,4.4868421052631575
8518550,3,B007JZFX42,I was kind of disappointed in this one. Welcome To My Nightmare could of been longer. Audio could have been better too.,1449964800,,119,4.454545454545454
