7912946,5,B00000JNTO,"The subtle passion of this film is remarkable. It is a Martinez tour de force - every movement on screen is full and rich. There are few films that are as romantic as this one. For any one who is a fan of Olivier Martinez this is a MUST SEE movie; For anyone new to Martinez, THIS is the one that shows you he is a true icon of sensuality and the ultimate in French film today.

7912949,5,B00000JNTO,"French films often depict life in far more realistic ways than Hollywood. This gem, which only incidentally deals with the Titanic tragedy, is an artistic and sensual protrayal of how the mind is even stronger than the  bodily appetites when it comes to romance, passion, and perception. The  film cleverly depicts how human emotions and behaviors are more influenced  by imagination than by immediate physical action.  Martinez has a gritty,  sexuality that is rare in films today.  He suggests that men might woo  their women more successfully with words rather than more traditional  machismo.  The photography, screen play, direction, and acting are all  first rate.  This is one of the finest films to come out of France since  Truffaut and Renoir.",945388800,24,753,5.132231404958677
