8357551,3,B00295SKZG,"This product is really weird because, this is not season 1, it is just the first 8 episodes of season 1 on one disc.  At first I thought that season 1 only had 8 episodes, but not true.  Season 1 has 22 episodes.  The show is great, that gets 5 stars.  I just don't understand why this product is sold this way.  Why not include the whole season 1.  It get 3 stars because I felt short changed.

There is another version of this product which is the complete series, and includes 4 disc.",1290556800,7,487,4.117021276595745
