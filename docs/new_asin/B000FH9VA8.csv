8478573,5,B000FH9VA8,My daughter loves this video. They show a monster truck and tell about it and show footage from a monster truck show in an arena. It is interesting and they show various trucks during the songs. It's great for kids!,1183939200,,215,4.4
8478574,5,B000FH9VA8,My son really likes this video.  He even likes the ads for other dvds in the end of the video.,1179532800,,94,3.7
8478575,1,B000FH9VA8,"I can forget the cheesiness of this video, because my son is too young to be cynical and fastidious. What I cannot excuse is the fact that NONE of these songs mention trucks. Some are about trains, some are about cars. There's ""Gotta Keep Rolling"" which may or may not be about trucking. The half hour advertisement at the end is insulting, irritating and annoying. I'll never buy another Kidsong video. And did I mention it was cheesy?",1163462400,3,436,4.602564102564102
