7359614,5,B0130CD3W6,My husband and I love this show.  We are old also and can relate to a lot of the age problems the guys get.  Really funny,1458086400,,121,3.6153846153846154
7359615,5,B0130CD3W6,"If youve come to this listing (and hence this review) here on Amazon, you are obviously not a newcomer to this long running BBC TV detective series. (If, you are, do not pass go and return to Season One and move forward). So I won't reiterate the setup. If you are also up though the recent seasons you know that some characters departed and new ones appeared. (No thats not a spoiler!) If there is a spoiler here its because I want to let you know that this (Season 12) is the final season. BUT, the writers have found a way to wrap things up nicely and I think those who, like me, love the series  - not for the plots or crimes but because of central characters, each with their own endearing character  will be at least satisfied.
There will be changes you won't expect and some changes that the main characters don't expect either. Some are funny; others are sad.
This season has 10 episodes each running 61 minutes (the BBC is non-commercial so shows run longer. The versions shown on US TV are edited for language (there is some violence here but its not really graphic). Expect a number of expletives.

The bonus this time is substantial  and worth your time (but don't watch before you see the episodes). Its a 40 minute featurette titled Top Ten Moments which is hosted by three of the production team, including the series creator. Itll bring back some great moments from the full run of the series and some are really laugh OUT LOUD FUNNY. Again, I won't reveal any.

One of my minor gripes  which Ive menmtioned in my reviews of the previous 11 seasons  is that when you play an episode you first get a plot summary. This  like some detailed episode reviews on Amazon  really spoils the fun. My suggestion: don't read the summary on the screen; just press play.

I agree that the later seasons were not as good as the earlier ones and it was hard to lose some characters. But it was still a good series and I like the way they tied things up. So, heck, if youve made it through Season 11, then go for this one. You won't regret it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The return process was a bit cumbersome, but I did get credit, minus a handling charge.  I will be much more careful in the future.  This was meant as a Valentine's Day gift.

7359617,5,B0130CD3W6,"New Tricks, Season 12. A well-loved British television serial that was broadcast on BBC One from August-October 2015, this comedic crime drama production contains its 100th episode and its last.  It also sees the departure of the only member of the entertainments original cast, Dennis Waterman, as the Metropolitans (Mets) London-based police forces Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad (UCOS) returns to tackle more troublesome cold cases.  Beautiful, tenacious young DCI Sasha Miller (Tamzin Outhwaite, EAST ENDERS) leads her  retired cops through tough times in this long- running hit British mystery series.  The teams loyalty faces its finest test when Gerry (Dennis Waterman, THE SWEENEY) is linked to a crime from his days on the serving force, incidentally putting Sasha in danger. Steve (Denis Lawson, BLEAK HOUSE) tries to free himself of his debts; Danny (Nicholas Lyndhurst, ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES) tries to strengthen his relationship with the teams forensics expert Fiona (Tracy Ann Oberman, FILTH). The tight-knit group at the heart of this police procedural also must absorb a new member, quirky superstitious ex-DCI Ted Case (the fine character actor Larry Lamb, GAVIN & STACEY).  These dogged detectives keep their trademark good-natured humor and playful banter, finally get to inhale coffee and donuts/pastries on the job, as they solve puzzling cases. Even as they face an uncertain future when UCOS itself is threatened. Guest stars include Amy Nuttall (DOWNTON ABBEY); the greatly respected veteran Bernard Cribbins (DOCTOR WHO); Lucy Benjamin (DETECTORISTS); veteran Geraldine Somerville (CRACKER, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN, Harry Potter films).

The episodes are: 'Last Man Standing: Part One', 'Last Man Standing: Part Two', 'The Curate's Egg', 'The Wolf of Wallbrook', 'Prodigal Sons', 'The Fame Game', 'The Russian Cousin', 'Lottery Curse', 'Life Expectancy' and 'The Crazy Gang'. The first two episodes unfortunately showcase what the show loses in Watermans departure: he brings qualities of intense gritty reality as a working class London copper that no other cast member can match. The series feels much lighter for his loss. Never mind, the fresh, funny and original mysteries solved continue to be twisty, ingenious; the process of solving them fast-moving.

The box series, which I received as a review copy in contemplation of an honest, unbiased review, consists of three discs containing all ten episodes of the final series, for approximately 615 minutes. Extras are New Tricks Top Ten Moments (41 mins., photo gallery).  And subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us who might not be easy with the quick cockney cross-dialog, or Steves Scottish brogue (he initially served in Glasgow.) Be warned: the production does contain some coarse language and sexual situations.  But its still a must for British mystery fans. Somehow, I wasn't aware of the existence of this show, not finding it until Series 11, which I loved, reviewed on its web page.  As a newcomer to the series, I might have profitably begun with the first series; if you, too, are just contemplating this production, you  might profitably begin with the first series. Anyway,  lucky me, I still have series 1-10 to dig out, enjoy.",1457136000,3,3231,5.313725490196078
7359618,5,B0130CD3W6,"Through this 12th season, never did the quality lag. New Tricks keeps a high level of storytelling right to the end of this final set. A class act. It was unique from day one, a crime investigator meets humor and female blonde bombshell boss meets old gray-haired guys. As DCI Sasha calls it, UCOS, the awkward squad.
Writing and superb acting remained constant over the dozen years. Gerry (Dennis Waterman), Strickland (Anthony Calf), Sasha (Tamzin Outhwaite) Steve (Denis Lawson), Danny (Nicholas Lynhurst), NEW: Ted (Larry Lamb), and the dearly departed who reappear in the bonus: Sandra (Amanda Redman), Brian (Alun Armstrong), Jack (James Bolam), Esther (Susan Jameson).

New Tricks has been a Five-Plus Star rated series from day one.",1455753600,8,3740,5.020933977455717
7359619,4,B0130CD3W6,"New Tricks is one of my favorite British comedic crime dramas.  This is its final season.  Over the years the cast has changed.  In series 12 it changes completely, with Dennis Watermans departure.  While I have enjoyed the entire series I have seen a falling off in the more recent episodes.  Dennis Waterman has commented on the fact that the new characters are fine as actors but their roles are somewhat ill-defined.  The Nicholas Lyndhurst character, e.g., is something of a (sometimes irritable) polymath, whereas the Alun Armstrong character had psychological issues that had a bright sidea photographic memory.  These issues were also comic and sometimes dramatic or even comic/melodramatic, particularly in his stunning relationship with his wife.  Bottom line: the new charactersas written, not as actedare not as engaging as the former ones.  I think hes right.

Series 12 consists of ten episodes.  Dennis Waterman appears in the first two and those are, far and away, the best in the set.  He is replaced by Larry Lamb, a fine character actor.  Unfortunately, the writers (Spoiler) make him gay, for no particular reason that might have to do with his investigative skills.  It is sprung on the audience in a slightly comedic way.  In the subsidiary material on the third disc the creative team makes it clear that they are very pleased with their cleverness in concocting this surprise.  Unfortunately, the surprise has nothing to do with crime and detection and more to do with making some point that, at this late hour, doesnt really need to be made.  It does not deepen his character in any way, in comparison, e.g., with James Bolams memories of his dead wife and the search for her killer, which created significant plot points and was central to Bolams character.  Watermans ex-wives and offspring played important roles in the shaping of his character and, as noted above, Armstrongs relationship with his wife (James Bolams wife, in real life) was one of the central attractions of his character.

The remaining eight episodes are OK, a little talky, a little less engaging than the original cast stories.  The individual, personal stories are resolved in the final episode, i.e., we learn what will happen to the characters in their lives beyond UCOS.

While not as strong as the earlier seasons, fans will definitely want to complete their sets and see how this all turns out.  The subsidiary material includes a list of the top ten New Tricks scenes.  It will be interesting to see if the audience agrees with the creative team.

I purchased this through Amazon.co.uk.  I would advise American audiences to consider purchasing an all-regions dvd player.  Amazon.com sells them.  They are available in the neighborhood of $100; I recommend those made by Pioneer.  An all-regions player enables you to comparison shop; sometimes the English versions are much less expensive than the American and they are generally available earlier.  The player pays for itself very quickly.",1453939200,19,2998,5.04887983706721
7359620,5,B0130CD3W6,"I came late to this series.
Though ""New Tricks"" was broadcast on the BBC for twelve Seasons beginning in 2003, it was never on my local PBS station.
I only discovered it on DVD at the public library.
I was shocked to discover how good it was.
I honestly wasn't expecting much.

Season Twelve (2015) was the final season.
The only remaining member of the original cast, Dennis Waterman, left after the first two episodes.
Episodes 3-10 were the only time in which all four major roles were played by replacement cast members.
Season Twelve is a worthwhile purchase, but if you are new to the series, by all means start with Season One
- see end of this review for a Buyers Guide.

Series Premise:
In 2003, The Metropolitan Police decide to create an ""Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases Squad"" (UCOS), tasked with re-opening unsolved cases from the past.
Problem: There is not enough money in the budget to fully staff the new unit
Solution: Three old-age pensioners are brought out of retirement.
Though retired policemen, they are technically civilian contractors, which saves the Department a lot of money.
Also, as civilians they feel free to flexibly interpret the rules (search warrant?)

Glamorous Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman is put in charge of UCOS.
A three person team does not need it's own Superintendent, but Superintendent Pullman is on the outs with her superiors.
This experiment could be a plan to ease her out of the department

Technically the acronym for ""Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases Squad"" is not UCOS (pronounced ""You-Cose"").
It's UCOCS (pronounced ""You-Cocks""), but its pretty clear why that could be a problem.

107 hour-long episodes spread over twelve years.
""New Tricks"" is a wonderful show, but it's hard to maintain consistent quality for such a long stretch.
There was a total cast change between the first and the final (12th) seasons, but it was a gradual process.
The original cast held together for eight seasons.
Followed by four additional permutations.
None of the replacements really lived up to their predecessors' achievement.
This is a tribute to the remarkable quality of the original cast, not a knock against the replacements.
The loss of retired Inspector Brian Lane midway through Season Ten was especially devastating.
I won't say it began with a bang, and ended with a whimper.
More like a smaller bang.

The show was always stronger on character development than plotting.
Too many cases are solved by a witness suddenly remembering an important piece of information he forgot to mention twenty years earlier.
A lot of suspension of disbelief is required, but it's worth the effort.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a total cast change between the first and the final seasons, but it was a gradual process.
The original team was unchanged for the first eight seasons of the show.

TEAM ONE: Season 1 through Season 9 (episode 1)
--- Superintendent Sandra Pullman
--- retired Chief Superintendent Jack Halford = Sandra Pullman's old boss, valued for his quiet wisdom.
Unknown to her, he actually went a bit loony following the death of his wife. Her ashes are buried under a tombstone in his back yard, where he goes to talk to her.
--- retired Inspector Brian Lane = An Obsessive Compulsive Recovering Alcoholic with a Photographic Memory, who had to retire from the force under questionable circumstances.
--- retired Sergeant Gerry Standing = An irrepressible womanizer with three ex-wives, plus three (make that four) grown daughters, all of whom he gets along with surprisingly well.

(after Jack Halford left, the team was a man short for Season 9, episodes 2 & 3)

TEAM TWO: Season 9 (episode 4) through Season 10 (episode 4)
--- Superintendent Sandra Pullman
--- retired Inspector Steve McAndrew (replacing Jack Halford)
--- retired Inspector Brian Lane
--- retired Sergeant Gerry Standing

TEAM THREE: Season 10 (episodes 5-8)
--- Superintendent Sandra Pullman
--- retired Inspector Steve McAndrew
--- retired Sergeant Dan Griffin (replacing Brian Lane)
--- retired Sergeant Gerry Standing
--- Jack Halford actually came back in a dream sequence for Episode 8, but that shouldn't count as rejoining the team (it was a social visit)

TEAM FOUR: Season 10 (episode 9) through Season 12 (episode 2)
--- Chief Inspector Sasha Miller (replacing Sandra Pullman)
--- retired Inspector Steve McAndrew
--- retired Sergeant Dan Griffin
--- retired Sergeant Gerry Standing

TEAM FIVE: Season 12 (episodes 3-10)
--- Chief Inspector Sasha Miller
--- retired Chief Inspector Ted Case (replacing Gerry Standing)
--- retired Inspector Steve McAndrew
--- retired Sergeant Dan Griffin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL CAST:
Superintendent Sandra Pullman = Amanda Redman, 85 episodes
retired Chief Superintendent Jack Halford = James Bolam, 68 episodes (+ 1 dream sequence)
retired Inspector Brian Lane = Alun Armstrong, 81 episodes
retired Sergeant Gerry Standing = Dennis Waterman, 99 episodes

REPLACEMENT CAST:
Chief Inspector Sasha Miller = Tamzin Outhwaite, 22 episodes
retired Chief inspector Ted Case = Larry Lamb, 8 episodes
retired Inspector Steve McAndrew = Denis Lawson, 37 episodes
retired Sergeant Dan Griffin = Nicholas Lyndhurst, 26 episodes

+ Deputy Assistant Commissioner Robert Strickland = Anthony Calf (Seasons 2 through 12)
The overall boss of UCOS: He is usually a background character, but was the featured player in the Season 9 finale.

One drawback: ""New Tricks"" has always been a rather expensive proposition.
At present, the least expensive way is to purchase:

There is some hope for the future.
""Foyle's War"" and ""New Tricks"" both ended long runs in 2015.
In Great Britain, this was a signal to Acorn Media to bring out two absolutely complete new mega-boxes at substantial savings.
The ""Foyle's War"" mega-box appeared in the UK in August, and in the US in October, 2015.
The ""New Tricks"" mega-box appeared in the UK in October 2015.
If the pattern holds, we should expect the ""New Tricks"" mega-box sometime in 2016.
Savings should be substantial (at least after the first few months).

7359625,5,B0130CD3W6,"Turns out this was the last season for New Tricks. Gerry (Dennis Waterman) along with D.A.C. Robert Strickland were the carryovers from the original cast & team. Gerry hangs it up in the 2-episode opening of the new season and comes out on top even though it looked very bleak for him at times. In the opener we meet DCI Ted Case (Gerry's old DCI) and he takes over for Sasha for an episode and then joins the cast as Gerry's replacement. Season 12 brought back the gags and tricks the team used to play on each other and Ted was a good replacement. The entire season was good and in the last episode it looked like it was all over for UCOS but in the end they are saved. Sasha takes on a new job, Strickland ends up with direct charge of UCOS and will supposedly put together a new team as the guys all have plans.

The actor who was supposed to replace Gerry (as if he could be replaced) was an awful choice.  I didn't care for the actor at all and his character seemed like a lame attempt to mimic Gerry's edgy personality.

The original cast was excellent and I believe the show never lived up to that once the cast member began leaving, particularly Alun Owen and Amanda Redman.  But the replacements were perfectly all right and the scripts remained solid.  By the final series, however, no one from the original cast was left and the show lost all of its zip.

7359676,1,B0130CD3W6,"The original cast and previous seasons made this series.  The humor was fantastic and you only got a glimpse of the crime scene photos so it didn't have to have the shock or gore value to propel the story line.  For some reason that changed when the characters Sandra, Jack and Brian moved on.  The show started heading a new direction, the humor barely cracked a smile and the writer appears to have wanted to turn this into a dramatic detective show like everything else out there.  Episode 3 on disc one apparently was a venture in being artsy- some of the scenes were shot thru windows at different angles that didn't make any sense (I.e, walking down a hospital corridor the characters are cut in half and their reflections are looking up at them )and were so distracting that I was ready to end the show there, pack it up & donate this one to Goodwill.  The ""bonus"" is a rip-off, out of all 12 seasons there are a treasure trove of best moments but the 10 they chose were lackluster to say the least and most were from this season.  This series deserved a better swan song than the one it got.  I was very surprised to see it had the same writer all 12 seasons because it sure didn't seem like it. The original 3 guys played off each other and made a perfect nucleus these last 3 were in 3 different corners and only came out to play with the others because they had to.  Sandra had complete control- her team respected and genuinely loved her and even feared her, but Sasha never had control over these guys, she might as well as been their tall blonde secretary whom they let hang out with them.  Not only were Gerry's former OCUS team members absent from his memorial so were his three wives and the other 3 daughters (I'm counting the ""adopted"" one too), as beloved as these characters were it was just another misstep this series took on this season.  It was a huge, huge disappointment.",1471478400,4,1898,4.397142857142857

Don't know if it was because we hated to see the end of the series, or because we missed the original cast members.

These back-from-retirement sleuths use seasoned smarts and current methods to get results that elude others, wisecracking all the way. Longtime fans will be sorry to see the last of the original New Tricks cast departing, as Gerry Standing (excellently portrayed by Dennis Waterman) departs and Ted Case (Larry Lamb from Gavin & Stacey) joins the group. Tamzin Outhwaite as DCI Sasha Miller continues to shine as commander of the squad, which faces a grim challenge linked to Standing's early career that also places Sasha in jeopardy and leaves a large question mark over the UCOS's future. Ten episodes are filled with the trademark dry wit and fast pace that series fans have come to expect. If you're new to the series, the bonus featurette of the show's top 10 moments will spark your interest and prompt you to check out earlier seasons. If you're an old fan of New Tricks, you'll delight in seeing which ones you remember best.

The resolutions of cases did start to become a bit obviously contrived; and it did lack of dramatic tension and intrigue has been a problem, the writers were obviously going for some humor, pathos and quirkiness.

7359719,4,B0130CD3W6,"Having read reviews here that Gerry Standing might leave under a cloud, I put off buying this set for as long as I could stand it.  Then I decided I would buy it and only watch to see what happened to him. I've begun watching Season 1 again and wondered what Gerry had done to have started his participation in UCOS under such a cloud.  My question was fully answered in the first 2 episodes of Season 12, which I've already watched twice.

The first episode without Gerry introduced the newest UCOS team member, who has been proclaimed a terrific character actor by most of these reviews.  I wasn't totally enchanted by him and never felt that he was integral to the team in the way that the other characters have been throughout the series.  He reminded me of someone with whom I worked long ago, whose primary job responsibility was to have lunch with our boss.  Ted is quirky buy not ""mad"" -- which was always funny when Brian lapsed that way.

Perhaps I'm not aging well, but the plot lines went way beyond ""puzzling"" for me in Season 12.  After watching one, I would try to work out not only ""Who dunnit"" but also ""Why?"" Clever writing but viewers should at least be able to go back and see the overall plot turns at then end, even if the important clues are hard to find.  And I, too, had to use closed captions to understand some of the crucial lines.  For that reason I would rate the technical quality as a bit sloppier than in previous seasons.  There was also a fluff with a camera in which Ted looked like a ghost -- which I wished he were!

In spite of my reservations about this season, it's worth buying just to see the last few minutes of the Curates Egg episode.  Genuinely funny and the laugh is well earned.",1462406400,5,1727,4.342679127725857
7359720,5,B0130CD3W6,"I loved this series from beginning to end.  Even with personnel changes, it was fun. It was great to see a series where older folks were shown in a quasi-heroic light.

7359732,1,B0130CD3W6,"Declining each year for the past half dozen years in creative storytelling, authentic acting, directing and cinematography. Stories as tired as stale bread (or even attempted resurrected stale bread). A lot of stage acting (a couple of people standing around regurgitating easily memorized short lines with camera mostly standing a boring couple of meters away).

Series over the past years didn't age well. So cheap a final season the show's producers didn't bother to have any of Standing's former colleagues attend his funeral - noticeably very strange omission.

7359740,5,B0130CD3W6,"All good things, so they say, must come to an end and so it was that Season 12 brought to a close one of the finest television programs ever produced anywhere.
Throughout its run, ""New Tricks"" has brought its viewers consistently excellent stories, wonderful performances, and intriguing characters. I'm happy to say that - although I hated to see it pass on - UCOS went out on a very high note. ""Last Man Standing"" - the opening two episodes of this season -  were, for example, far superior to anything I've watched in the past few years. For that matter, all of this season's episodes carried on the tradition of great storytelling and acting by a cast that understood its characters and played them to perfection.
I have to admit that I delayed watching the last episode for a couple of days because I just didn't want this series to end - silly, of course, but in the  desert full of knock-offs and ""reality"" shows that is the 21st Century's idea of programming  ""New Tricks"" has been a canteen of cool water to a very thirsty viewer.

7359747,5,B0130CD3W6,"Last year, Gerry (Dennis Waterman) was the last man standing of the original group. I really loved them, they played off each other well and just ""fit"" together. The writing and the new stars seemed o.k., but when you have gotten use to the same group for 11 seasons....well
This year Gerry hangs it up and is replaced by ex-DCI Ted Case ( Larry Lamb). Larry Lamb is AWESOME!!!!! He was the final piece this new group needed to gel. They all play off each other so well, that I actually caught myself laughing out loud quite a few times listening to their banter. This new crew, now, could hold their own any day against the original four!
The stories seem a lot better in Season 12 than in Season 11. This years season has more energy to it than last years imo.
Unfortunately the series has now been cancelled!!! ( go figure, right?)
I truly think whoever made this decision has made a major, MAJOR mistake!!
This is one series I am really, really going to miss!",1458518400,12,963,4.415730337078652
7359748,2,B0130CD3W6,"This review has 2 stars because of the discs.  The series would get 3 stars.  It took a long time to get the discs to play.  Over and over again I got an ""incorrect disc"" message.  Eventually all the discs played but these are marketed as Region 1 and should play with no issues. As far as the series goes, this is the last New Tricks season as UCOS disbands in the final episode.  Jerry leaves early on after he is threatened by organized crime and moves to New York City. It's just as well the series is ending because the current crew is a shadow of the original cast although Danny and Steve are good.  Just not Jack or Brian.",1458518400,,630,4.1652892561983474

8726832,1,B0130CD3W6,Would loved to have seen this BUT can't afford it. I will wait for Amazon to break down and give it to us free. It's cheaper to go out to movies and get refreshments in this day and age ! Could put down money for a new car with the cost of this series!!!!!  ,1535068800,,258,3.759259259259259
8726833,4,B0130CD3W6,"Season 11 brought more cast changes and it go too whacked out.  The loss of lead inspector Pullman was sad, but read she just had enough with the scripts.  Season 11 was not syncing, but season 12 actually started to work; the new cast fit and the humor was back, but unfortunately, the show has been cancelled.",1529625600,,311,4.43859649122807

8726835,1,B0130CD3W6,"The cast knew the series was ending and acted like it.  Tamzin Outhwaite is playing Amanda Redmen playing a police inspector, Nickolas Lyndhurst plays a pompous twit, Dennis Lawson is all introspective and channeling Hamlet, Larry Lamb tries and fails to be the reincarnation of Brian Lane, Dennis Waterman phones in his performance.
The ""new"" cast doesn't have the ""family"" feel it took the original cast several season to develop.  Some of the story lines are re-hashes of the original stories.

If you haven't seen the first 10 season this is an OK show, but in comparison to the original it lacks a lot.

I own all the seasons and loved it when it started.  Cast changes ruined it.  They should have ended it a few years eariler.",1519171200,,733,4.6875
8726836,5,B0130CD3W6,Finishes off my collection. OK end to a great series. Could see the series changing and the replacement of the characters just did not quite work. Everything comes to an end and I am glad I have it.,1518048000,,198,4.2368421052631575
