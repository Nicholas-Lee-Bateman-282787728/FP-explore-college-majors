4493003,5,B004X904JG,My son has worn this DVD out. He loves the way they describe the bugs and their weakness and strengths and show how they survive in the wild. Love that there are no commercials and can play the whole season straight through.,1381363200,,224,4.357142857142857
4493004,1,B004X904JG,They only give you 5 episodes with this set. They held back the best episode. I guess they will release it again with all the episodes and make you purchase it a 2nd time. That is not very ethical nor very honest. The European version includes all the episodes.,1374451200,2,261,4.346938775510204
4493005,2,B004X904JG,"I am a Biology teacher, a lover of insects, and I was so excited when I saw this movie. I expected it to depict real life occurrences, and instead got a movie that addressed the audience rather than the subject matter. There is TOO much use of animation to explain and not enough true to life filming. This seemed low budget and I would not recommend this movie to those who enjoy more of the ""real thing""",1373932800,,405,4.2727272727272725
4493006,4,B004X904JG,"Really love watching these amazing creatures, but as with most nature shows, it heavily preaches evolution as a fact, and not a theory as it is only and ever will be. However I find it really funny that they put larger animal noises on top of the spiders making them seem huge. It's totally fake, just like their science they preach! Oh it also talked about the trapdoor spider being a primitive spider that hasn't change in a million years-FUNNY! So when did evolutionist pick and chose what has or has not evolved? If their theory were true, all things would. Just gives you more proof of God as Creator!",1371945600,,606,4.5181818181818185
4493007,1,B004X904JG,"From narrative (words and tone of voice), to animation, to sound effects (esp. the sound effects!), this ""documentary"" aims at inflating the sense of cruelty in the bug fights for the sake of entertainment. It is desensitizing and sickening. It outweights whatever educational value there is to offer.",1370563200,,301,5.291666666666667
4493008,4,B004X904JG,"This film is similar to a TV show I use to watch forgot the name were the experts describe the pros and cons of weapons and armor worn by ancient warriors. Then there is a face-off in one on one combat to see which warrior will prevail. If you want to invite some friends over and sit around the TV placing bets on which bug will prevail this DVD is for you. Size doesn't matter the bigger they are the harder they fall. Ants always win. But, the ant vs. bees was a nice match up.",1351123200,,480,4.010416666666667
4493009,3,B004X904JG,"In the description it says this is SIX episodes disc. Wrong!!!
Instead there are only FIVE of them. They are all fun to watch, BUT our favorite one(the reason we bought it on DVD) is missing.
I don't understand why they would record five and miss one, but it should be at least described right!!!",1318464000,10,296,4.4
4493010,5,B004X904JG,"My kids and I love this show! You get to watch full on battles between fierce insects, arachnids and more. The camera work is fantastic. You see up close, beautiful shots of these creatures in action. While the supplemental computer graphics are not really that spectacular, the imagery they show certainly is fun to watch and provides helpful understanding of how their physiology works. And even though there is no doubt some forced meetings between these animals, the battles nevertheless are real. They do occur in nature and you get to see them from a front row seat in this show. Finally, I'm an entomologist and I've noticed that while at times the facts are stretched (to the limits), they still remain fairly accurate, with just alot of colorful language to make them sound scary. So the show is both educational and exciting. If you're a fan of bugs at all, watch this show or get this DVD.",1311552000,9,900,4.7025316455696204

4493012,3,B004X904JG,"My son loves insects and everything that has to do with them. He loves Bug Wars, but I'm not sure how authentic these scenarios are. Think about it: a branch full of wasps accidentally falls on a colony of vicious ants just as a film crew happens to be crawling around the jungle looking for bug on bug carnage?",1310947200,,311,4.288135593220339

8446487,5,B004X904JG,I got this for my two grandsons ages 6 and 7. I saw two episodes on tv so I  DVRed them. They would watch them over and over so I had to order the set when I found it.  Just like before they love it. Even I know more about bugs now than I've ever wanted but even for me it's very entertaining and I would recommend this set to anybody with kids boys and girls.,1433548800,,360,3.723684210526316

8446491,5,B004X904JG,"I watched this show while it was on TV and now it is hard to find. My sister got it for my birthday and I love it! While the sound effects are goofy, they are what add to this show. Ants that roar like lions makes you wonder how it would really be to be an insect.",1411776000,,264,3.6491228070175437
