7951386,1,B00005QY8P,"Skip this flaming piece of #@!$&.  The wrestling is moronic, to say the least.  All it consists of is grainy footage of jackasses from the UK, Canada, and the US trying (and failing) to act ""hardcore"".  Add to this mix an innane XPW-wannabe ""host"", and a couple of strippers (one hot, the other not) play-rolling around in dirty water, trying not to get their hair wet, and you have a colossal waste of time.  Do not buy, do not rent, do not even borrow.  ZERO STARS",1122940800,4,466,4.372093023255814
7951387,1,B00005QY8P,"Backyard Wrestling dvds are always bad...but sometimes they have that ""Jackass"" appeal of seeing people do stupid things to each other and sometimes it can be entertaining even if bad.  Not here.  This is 'VHS Quality' videos, mixed with shots of unattractive bimbos topless, mixed with bad sound effects.  I got to see this DVD as part of the FULL CONTACT FIGHTS 5DVD Box set which is primarily professional (and real) Mixed Martial-Arts shows.  But it also included this.  And I just had to do my part to spare any of you the Ripoff feeling you'll get if you buy this DVD here.  Not even worth seeing for free.  F. --Rob
P.S. is it me, or do I see about a 5 second clip of C.Z.W Pro Wrestler Ruckus ,doing a backflip off a makeshift ring in somebodies Backyard.  It sure looks like him and it looks just like the backflips he does in CZW, But I could be wrong.  Stay away from this DVD and the VHS.",1088726400,,900,4.309523809523809
7951388,1,B00005QY8P,"What a boring video, ""EXTREME UNDERGROUND WRESTLING"" what a catchy name! if you look at the back cover and see all of the grammer mistakes, you'd obviously know what is in side.  Wrestling from around the world, california, idaho, scotland, england, and CANADA!  Most of these ""hardcore"" incidents (ie toy guitar over the head not once, not twice, but 3 times!) are shown a minimum of four times.  The two women in this video make no sense, while somewhat appealing to the eye, I wonder why they are in this, they have no reason to be.  Basically you see some kids do some dumb thing, see a 1 second clip of the ladies dancing topless, see some kids do some dumb things, see the same 1 second clip.
THE MUSIC
What kind of royalty free music is this? A 30-second guitar/techno thing, looped over and over.
...Did i mention that there is two parts to this dvd! 2 hrs. of the same thing over and over... WOOOOOOOOO!",1015804800,6,912,4.4431137724550895
7951389,4,B00005QY8P,"Until now, although some Backyard Wrestling VHS had been seen, this was a little unsatisfactory.
I'm moderate chapter composition and thought it good that a favorite scene could be seen flexibly.
However, it was regrettable that a debt of an awkward effect sound and a meaningless lady comes out (it was interesting enough only at honesty and the chairman).
If it adjusts, is it a place called the result of price suitability?",1012089600,,426,4.930555555555555

THAT`S WHAT YOU SAY WHEN YOU SEE THIS VIDEO,IT`S ALLRIGTH IF YOU WANT TO SEE TWO LADIES IN BIKINIES DOING STUPID THINGS,BUT NOT RECOMENDED FOR KIDS,AND THEY DID NOT SHOW THE MATCHES IN THEIR INTIRE VERSIONS PLUS THEY DIN`T PUT THE ACTUAL AUDIO OF EACH MATCH,BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME CRAZY KIDS DOING HARDCORE MOVES THAN YOU HAVE TO SEE IT,PLUS IT`S GOOD FOR THE PRICE OF THE VIDEO,MY HAT GOES OUT TO DOES CRAZY KIDS WHO DID ALL THOSE MATCHES IF YOU CAN CALL THEM THAT,I HOPE YOU GUYS MAKE IT TO THE TOP KEEP WORKING HARD....",1009929600,,533,4.287128712871287
7951391,1,B00005QY8P,"...that it's [awful] .  Backyard wrestling videos are stupid.  The kids in them know nothing about wrestling.  They just hit each other with weapons and severely injure each other.  They've had no training.  Sure, they say they spend hours practicing.  But, if a kid spent hours practicing football, and yet had no training whatsoever, he'd be killed.  They might as well be practicing with assault rifles.  Sure, I'm in a backyard wrestling fed.  But me and my frineds do it for fun.  We use fake weapons (meter sticks, shoes), we use a trampoline, we do simple moves, and, if we mess up, we stop.  We've had very minor injuries (cuts, bumps on heads), so we learn from those mistakes.  We've never doubled an injury.  The kids on these videos wrestle on concrete and dirt, they use the trampoline to do backflips onto people, and, when someone bleeds, the other guy tries to open the wound further!  Not worth anyone's money.",1008547200,5,927,4.7125
