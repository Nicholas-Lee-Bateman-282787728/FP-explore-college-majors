8491375,4,B0062PSJLO,"I was expecting more of a comedy from ""Jucy' as the cover and promo material suggested such. In fact it's more of a true life story of the main characters with occasional funny bits. A good movie but not as good as Louise Alstons earlier movie, ""All my friends are leaving Brisbane""",1339545600,,282,4.4423076923076925
