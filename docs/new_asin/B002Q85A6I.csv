3966344,5,B002Q85A6I,"I agree with the two previous reviewers on their comments. I felt the need to give this DVD 5 stars because I had been looking so long for a live version of ""Survival"" and it is here! Video and sound quality great, too. It was nice to see the complete performances that had been cut drastically in Yesyears.",1269561600,5,307,4.310344827586207
3966345,4,B002Q85A6I,"This is  the best Live Yes dvd
out there,even if not all of the tracks are live,This is really a newer (longer )Beat Club collection
With songs which aired on two original beat club shows,
The new stuff on this dvd is more Beat club stuff from the first Line up of the Group,and its great
to have,
The only downer is they didn't added that other Yes Show they have as a extra,that came out as
another dvd",1268611200,4,404,4.113924050632911
3966346,4,B002Q85A6I,"First I want to say that the quality of the image and sound is great.  Some of this is 40 years old now and it is wonderfull to see the boys looking so young and seeing them in a quality film/video recording.
If you are a fan like me you have seen parts of these videos in bios of the band like in YesYears for example, so I don't know just how lost these were that they were not put out on VHS or DVD years ago.  I think these are taken from first generation tapes it looks that good.  I am not giving it 5 stars because of the DVD box is configured so that you really have to work hard at reading the notes located behind the plastic box holder.  I would have prefered a little booklet and on the DVD program it would have been nice to have a few extras as a bonus or maybe a short into by Chris Welch or someone of equal stature but I am glad they finally came out with it.
As a note to Amazon this should also be located on the list of music for Yes as I went through 38 pages and it was not found until I searched under movies and tv.
Get with it Amazon!!",1260835200,18,1060,3.82648401826484

8377543,5,B002Q85A6I,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. He wanted it last year, but Amazon said they couldn't get it. I'm so glad they were able to stock it again.",1391040000,,148,3.966666666666667
8377544,5,B002Q85A6I,"This is a must have for serious Yes fans. For me the best tracks are 'Looking Around' and 'Survival'. Great black and white footage from Germany. The quality is very good and is truly live. These tracks are from the first Yes album(1969). The first two Yes albums are overlooked classics. This is without Steve Howe and Peter Banks, the first guitarist, was also very good. Yes always had great musicians. It's awesome to see Bill Bruford in the early days of Yes. Would like to see more footage like this from the major rock groups of the 60's and 70's.",1321228800,8,554,4.4950495049504955
8377545,4,B002Q85A6I,"It's hard to say that these sessions were lost since ""No Experience Needed, No Opportunity Necessary"", ""Yours is No Disgrace"" and ""I've Seen All Good People"" are available from various sources, including the recent reissue of all the Beat Club episodes that seem to be floating around. The nice thing about this set is the new stuff that is included. I think I have seen the performance of ""Yours Is No Disgrace"" a couple dozen times over the years and never realized how much that had been cut down for broadcast. Here it has been restored to it's full glory and without the closing credits at the end (although I do miss the rather hot female Beat Club vj Uschi Nerke's introduction from the original program). ""Looking Around"" and ""Survival"" come from the same 1969 sessions as ""No Experience Needed"" and are fine performances that leaves one to wonder why they were cut. ""A Time and a Word"" is an early 1970 session that never made it to broadcast at all.

All in all this is a fantastic collection with great video and sound, although three versions of ""I've Seen All Good People"" might be a bit much. The middle version was the one that was originally broadcast and is only slightly different from the first. The third version is a rough performance with some technical difficulties going on in the background as it looks like Yes is being superimposed in front of someone rewinding a video tape for the first three or four minutes.

I wonder what other goodies from other bands are on the shelves of Radio Bremen.",1296777600,4,1520,4.625925925925926
8377546,4,B002Q85A6I,"I'm a long time Yes fan. I've seen a lot of concerts, bought a lot of LPs, CDs and DVDs (including the Musikladen DVD). I've also read Peter Banks' book ""Beyond and Before: The formative Years of Yes. If there has ever been a guy who has been screwed over in his attempt to make a career in the music business, it was Peter Banks. Almost everyone and every record company he's worked with has screwed him over in some fashion. Last I understood, he has never received a dime in royalties for his role as the writer/co-writer of early Yes songs that appear on the many reissues and compilations that have come out over the past fifteen years. After reading his book, I was surprised he has not taken his own life.

Anyhow, all you members of Yes who I admire as musicians, if you have not settled up with Peter Banks, it's time you did.",1292112000,8,835,4.318471337579618
8377547,5,B002Q85A6I,"First things first this DVD is a must have for all hard core fans of Yes and for all that have enjoyed their musical evolution up to these days.  If you pick up Yes at the time of ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" and have fun with it I recommend you wait a minute to get this.

Radio Bremen's Beat Club was a fantastic TV Show that gathered during the late and sixties and seventies a great quantity of progressive rock bands / musicians from USA and Europe at their first step in music and later as big names in the industry.  Beat Club performances have been released from a while back but still there is a number of bands /performances that remain unreleased and some other were filmed but not broadcasted.  Such is the situation with some tracks of this DVD of Yes.

This is the band in difference stages from the Banks (guitar) - Kaye (organ) era to the transitional Howe (guitar) - Kaye (organ) line up.  By the way you don't have much chances to see Yes with Peter on guitar. Also you get the three takes made for All Good People which is fantastic (these german unlike the BBC people didn't erase their tapes made in the 60's).

Most of the performances are live except for Time and a Word which is lip - sync.  The performances are really cool and professional as the band, no matter the personnel changes, remain in top shape and perfect.  This is the band with the musicians in their 20's (look at the young Bill Bruford trying to mime his part on Time and a Word) and you can appreciate such a quality in their work.

Maybe the sound is the weakest point here but image is quite great.  I love those Beat Club screen projections as they are so psychedelic and similar to the light show of the sixties.  They even used to film the band while resting or doing parts to overdub the performances (see All Good People segment for instance).

No matter that some of these performances were officially available in others DVD's I do recommend you get this one because is a trip back to the time where musicians were musicians (at the top of creativity but not getting much money) and not a corporate entity (where they actually started to get money and fight with creativity).",1280534400,4,2174,4.3915211970074814
8377548,5,B002Q85A6I,"The first time I saw these long lost tapes I was really amazed not only because this DVD is really a rarity but for the sound and colour of all tracks that were very well recorded and preserved from the running time inside a vault (?); but over all, I could not avoid to compare this DVD ""Lost Broadcasts"" against its rival the YES ""Musik Laden"" collection. If you remember, this release had only three video songs:  All Good People, Yours Is No Disgrace, No Opportunity Necessary No Experience Needed.

While LOST BROADCASTS DVD contains:

1. No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed (b/w) (Live with Peter Banks on guitar),
2. Looking Around (b/w) (live with Peter Banks on guitar),
3. Survivor (b/w) (live with Peter Banks on guitar),
4. Time And A Word (Colour) (a play back video, with Peter Banks on guitar),
5. Yours Is No Disgrace (Colour) (Live with Steve Howe on guitar),
6. The Three (3) complete live versions of ""All Good People"" (Colour) (Only the second version. The worst. were released with the Musik Laden YES series). (I think that the first version is the best, and it's  my favorite).

How long this tapes were lost? I really don't know but This impressive DVD deserves all respect and attention of the fans. A video that shows the roots and the true Yes beginnings at the famous germany ""Beat Club"", and a must have for real Yes Fans!.... Good Luck!",1271203200,24,1377,4.650205761316872
