8717633,5,B00Y7R9HAG,"Hilarious, campy, almost painfully funny!
At least to me who saw this soon after original release and I must say to a great friend who presently works at McMurdo base during the Antarctic summers.",1493856000,,196,4.794117647058823
8717634,4,B00Y7R9HAG,"This could be regarded as a service comedy of Operation Deep Freeze to some extent, if you are aware of some of the rigors of living there.  The reporter and photographer are in a fish out of water story.

Some actual footage of the polar base may have been combined with Hollywood sets.  The transport to and from Antarctica is by MATS C-54.  The only other aerial shots are stock footage of the changing airliners from New York to the West Coast, then to Australia, then to Christchurch, New Zealand, and finally back again.  They get around by Snow Cat, though there are Weasels in the overview.",1468368000,,598,4.5514018691588785

8717636,5,B00Y7R9HAG,George Maharis is an awesome actor! I highly recommend this movie!,1466812800,,66,5.090909090909091
8717637,4,B00Y7R9HAG,"Despite the unique setting this film doesn't break any new comic ground but gets a pass for good vibes.  The plot concerns a milquetoast reporter (Robert Morse) and a womanizing photographer (George Maharis) jettisoned to an underground naval base in Antarctica cooking up a scheme to coerce a Russian scientist (Michael Constantine) to defect by flying attractive women into what was previously an all male conclave.  The cast is engaging notably Anjanette Comer as a Kiwi stewardess and Yvonne Craig as Morse's fianc&eacute;.  Tackles Cold War politics with a feather duster as opposed to a sledgehammer.  A piece with ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming"" which came a few years later.",1439596800,7,701,5.176991150442478

8717639,3,B00Y7R9HAG,"This 1964 comedy was a failure for director Delbert Mann who also co-produced with Douglas Lawrence.  Delbert Mann had just directed ""Dear Heart"" with Geraldine Page and Glenn Ford.  ""Quick! Before t Melts"" featured in some of their first starring roles in movies Robert Morse, George Maharis and Anjanette Comer.  Most of it is very unfunny.  Not long after Morse and Comer made ""The Loved One"" and were very funny and the inspired chemistry worked.  Anujanette Comer had a very interesting career in films, several times playing an unlikely Mexican as in ""The Apaloosa"" and ""Guns for San Sebastien.""  Based on a novel by Philip Benjamin, the screenplay was written by Dale Wasserman.  Music is by David Rose.  In an inspired scene where Morse and Comer begin to take off their heavy clothes, Rose's ""The Stripper"" is used, but the scene only goes as far as their long underwear.  The Warner Archive collection edition is in Panavision and Metrocolor.  Labored and somewhat forced Cold War comedy, the penguin, the only novelty.",1435104000,3,1029,4.964912280701754
