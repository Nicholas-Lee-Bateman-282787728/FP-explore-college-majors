8425903,4,B004DR7R6G,"It's different. I got this copy as a gift, but saw it a few years ago. Comedy version of West Side Story/Romeo and Juliet taking place in Israel/Occupied territories. Very funny and cute, as the kids of rival felafel and hummus stands-a Jew and a Palestinian-fall in love. Not an ""art"" movie, but worth watching.",1356048000,2,312,4.6909090909090905
