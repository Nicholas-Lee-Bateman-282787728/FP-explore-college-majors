2583240,3,B000FS9FIA,"Once again, Korea has given their viewers a beautiful film in terms of cinematography. In fact, I find most Korean films these days visually stunning. However, this has never been a problem. What many of these horror films lack are real scares. Sure, ambiguity is nice once in awhile, and the revenge factor works now and then. But how about something totally different? Now, in all fairness, I do believe that Korean horror and suspense films are still a notch above what we in America churn out on a daily basis. But, these films are becoming so formulaic, that I find it hard to really like many of the films coming out of the Korean horror industry these days. That is not to say that some viewers will not like this film.

For me the film itself lacks the suspense and horror that I really look forward too in this genre. Having written this, I will write that ""Cello"" is better than many films that have been released in recent years from Korea--yet that is not saying much, as so many are so similar. Yes, they are much better than most of the horror films here in the States, but one keeps hoping that they will make a breakout with some really captivating and scary films that will capture the world with the same unique quality that their dramas, and suspense films have been able to do. Moreover, the talent in both the acting, and the directing is definitely there. Yet, by continuing to churn out the same formulaic horror films at a rapid rate, they are going to suffer the same fate that American horror films now find themselves in: Stale and turgid.

""Cello"" is not that bad of a film. If anything it is watchable. I would just like something a little bit more than ""well it was worth a watch."" Anyway, the films narrative is more like a drama, with very little to non-existent horror. The film centers around a woman named Hong Mi-ju (Hyeon-a Seong) who is a former Cello player. Due to a tragic car accident, she injures her hand---and as a result, she gives up playing the Cello, and instead becomes a music instructor. [One more thing I would like to add, the Korean horror/suspense genre has pretty much played out the classical music in their films, however, the sound of the cello is beautiful]. Further, there is something that still haunts Mi-ju in regards to her past: For it was in this car accident that her good friend and cello rival Tae-yeon Kim (Da-an Park) was also killed.

Trying to forget this terrible incident and get on with her life, she finds herself saddled with a difficult student who is upset with the grade she has been given. Given a cassette tape from an unknown source, her past begins to haunt her again. Is Mi-ju being haunted by the spirit of her dead rival? And what about the student? How does she fit in? But there is more to the narrative. With a new servant in the house who is mute, and a daughter who begins learning how to play the cello, the film veers into more of a dramatic suspense film with the various characters that are introduced into the film. The film does drag a bit, and plays out more like a drama. And if you have seen Korean horror or thriller films you will notice there is nothing really new here. Once again, this is not a bad film, but it is not a good film either. Somewhere in between. I recommend that viewers rent the film first. It may not appeal to many viewers.

2583241,3,B000FS9FIA,"Cello (Woo-cheoi Lee, 2005)

Cello isn't a bad little film. It's not one of the best Asian horror flicks I've ever seen, but it's far from the worst; there is, however, not terribly much to make it stand out from the pack. That said, it reminded me in many, many ways of Twisted, an execrable Jay Lowi film (if you haven't seen it, don't waste your time), except that Cello was everything Twisted couldn't figure out how to be--atmospheric, suspenseful, mysterious. Which leads to a dilemma: rate the film in comparison to other Asian films (in which case it's mediocre), or in comparison to the closest thing we have to it in America (in which case it's brilliant)? Eh, well, I'll decide that eventually.

After a car accident that kills her best friend and causes her a hand injury, Mi-jou (Woman Is the Future of Man's Hyeon-a Seong), a promising young cellist, becomes a professor at a nearby school. Some years later, married and with a family, seemingly unrelated events set Mi-jou down the path of remembering the circumstances (which she's blocked from her mind) surrounding the accident: her autistic daughter wants to learn to play the cello, a student at school to whom she gave a bad grade vows revenge, she receives a rare album for her birthday, a handful more. As she gets closer to the truth of the accident, she begins to question her own sanity.

It's not a terribly original plot, and it's not handled in any terribly original way. Still, that doesn't mean it's not worth a couple of hours of your time. The soundtrack (which is, of course, mostly cello) is wonderful, the acting is above average, and if the ending doesn't come as a terrible shock, it's probably because you've seen Twisted. You have my condolences. ***",1182729600,3,1740,4.717105263157895
2583242,2,B000FS9FIA,"I have a growing collection of asian horror movies and so far I've been disappointed in them. Yes the acting is pretty good, the directing and cinematography are great, but the continuity of things in the story being provided for us, fails to make its mark.

 Ok, so our girl Mi-Ju, a cello instructor, is being haunted by the spirit of her dead friend, who comes back as the typical angry asian spirit, black hair-pasty-faced and pissed off.  Now every one in her house is in danger of being done in by the ghost.  Some of this movie is straight forward, some of it feels like an out of place dream sequence.

the film even throws the red herring at you in the form of one of her students threatening her. Either by her hands of the spirit, Mi-Ju's whole family ends up buying the farm, or did they? By the end of the movie I'm thinking was the whole thing a premonition in the form of a dream?  I don't know.

This film was ok, it dragged a bit here and there.

On the back of the DVD case it reads in quotation marks..""Chilling...and Bloody!"" next to the brief story synopsis.  Cello had a couple of chilling parts, but bloody? Not even close.  The picture on the front of the case, if one were to just glance at it, is misleading. Bottom Line....Yawn! Is that the best 'horror' asian extreme can do?  They need step it up a notch.",1175040000,7,1334,4.296
2583243,4,B000FS9FIA,"Cello is a unique story for this genre. To me, it felt more like a thriller (something like What Lies Beneath (2000)instead of a horror movie like Ringu.  The acting in Cello is great.  The story is interesting and a little more personal than most horror movies. It does seem like the build up is a little long and drawn out before you get to the ending, but the ending was satisfying. There are some holes and some disjointed moments in the film, and I wondered if that was because the translation was off?  I have always loved the Cello as an instrument and the music in this film is quite beautiful.

Overall I enjoyed watching it and was pleased that I rented it.",1170028800,5,667,4.354838709677419
2583244,4,B000FS9FIA,"Before I watched Cello, I thought I was scraping the bottom of the K-horror barrel...a movie about a haunted musical instrument sounded kind of lame.  I was wrong; it was surprisingly good.  Hong Mi-Ju is an emotionally fragile music teacher whose past comes back to haunt her--or is it all in her head?  The story unfolds like a Twilight Zone episode.

If you get impatient with some of the Asian horror conventions (an insistence on cheesy effects when CGI would be better, unresolved major plot elements) then this might be more your speed.  The body count is as high, and as bloodily graphic, as a Hollywood horror flick, and while there are weaknesses in the story--I'm still not sure what the housekeeper was doing there--the ending isn't a baffling existential statement.  It's not as nuanced as a movie like A Tale of Two Sisters, but it doesn't require cliff notes to understand, either.",1164844800,21,896,4.823529411764706
2583245,3,B000FS9FIA,"I am on a bit of an ""Asian Thriller / Horror"" kick at the moment.  One of the movies I recently purchased was ""Cello"".  The movie certainly has promise yet it has an overall feeling of being disjointed.  The premise is good, the acting is ok, the cinematography is good... and yet... the story itself feels very jerky.

It actually feels like the director was using the discontinuity to try and hide the twists in the plot (ie you cant tell if the odd event was important by its inexplicablity or whether it was just bad editing).

Don't get me wrong, ""Cello"" is worth watching, its just not a ""must have"" in a collection.  There are other movies with similar themes which work much better - ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" being a good example.",1162339200,4,737,4.4222222222222225
2583246,4,B000FS9FIA,"This movie is good!

Okay..Okay.. so its the same old revenge story by freaky black haired chick. I know.

But lets take a look at what this movie offers.

First off, no holds barred, original and graphic kills.

I mean come on..when was the last time a whole family got killed off.

Beautiful set pieces and air of unrelenting menace surround this flick.

This ghost is out for revenge..not just the come through the TV and poop scare ya to death kind. I'm talking about the whole enchalada. The last time I've seen a ghost this pissed off it was..hell I can't remember the last time I saw a ghost that pissed off.

A nice twist of events..and no I'm not talking about the ending.

I mean the part where we really see who was to blame for all of the mayhem.

So genre fans..not just Japanese Horror Genre Fans either..rejoice. Here is a ghost story to wrap your bed sheet around.

Okay, none of my reviews would be complete without a little negativity.

At times, the movie did feel as if it were a little been there..done that. Especially with the ghost being so Ringuish like. The final scene was not as explorative or explained as it should have been. I mean, give us a break..we just sat through 2 or more hours of watching this womens family get killed off in hellish ways and now it ends on a made for TV movie instant replay.

Do not let these qualms stop you from watching this movie. It is

a non stop spooky ride and one you will be glad that you got off sane and sound when its over.

Just a hint..If your daughter all of a sudden grows real attached to a Cello..Ship that sucker to Bangkok. The Cello, I mean not your daughter.",1156809600,28,1640,4.299674267100977
2583247,5,B000FS9FIA,"This is a really scary movie.  I've always put Ju-On on the top mantle as being the scariest horror movie ever, but this movie surpasses that movie.  I didn't expect much, seeing the title of the movie which doesn't sound scary at all, but was I wrong, dead wrong.  If you are a horror fan, you got to see this movie.  The terror one feels stays with you even after the movie ends.  Cold chills ran through my bones and the hair never stopped standing at the back of my neck.  Asian horror movies don't rely on gore, but suspense and an ever so thickening creepiness that never stops.  Contemporary American horror movies don't scare me much anymore and it often relies on the same old tricks.  Asian horror movies like this one, which is Korean, is not an original idea, but the craft of scaring the living daylights out of you is getting stronger and better.  Other Asian titles I recommend are Ju-On, Dark Water, and The Red Shoes.",1156204800,4,934,4.447058823529412

2583250,3,B000FS9FIA,"Cello is your basic korean ghost story. However it offers a very specific type of scare for its audience. I personally found the film to be far more depressing than frightening. I've become rather accustome, like most audience members for horror these days, to jump scares and frightening images to classify something as horror. This movie has very few of either. The main scare of this film comes at the very end as a twist, and while scary in its own way, its not a generally frightening idea unless pondered for a while. It seems like the main fear that can be induced from this film is really more depressing than scary. A beautiful film with strong acting, this horror movie just doesnt feel like horror.",1342224000,,709,4.634920634920635
2583251,3,B000FS9FIA,"This movie tries so hard to be clever that in the end(s) it's anything but.
I will say that it had a certain perverse fascination so I stayed with it; I think that says more about my stubbornness than any talent on the part of the writer.
The plot was fraught with overused gimmicks and convoluted logic.  With alarming regularity, and not a little desperation, contradictory scenes were lobbed at the screen with the hope that something might prove effective.  Unfortunately, when you manufacture a plot that's based entirely on false perception soon everything becomes suspicious and unreliable.  By the time you start wondering what's the point, or worse, is there a point; the whole mess comes unraveled and sadly doesn't stop unraveling until the final shot.
This movie suffers from familiarity.  I've seen bits and pieces of it spread out in a hundred other movies.

I didn't mind watching it once, but once is my limit.",1338940800,,926,4.872611464968153

One thing I love about Asian horror is that they show things that American film won't touch. I won't give any spoilers but you'll know what I'm talking about when you see the film. Overall, good acting, good cinematography and a good story. It's a shame I figured out the ending about halfway through. Nothing groundbreaking but not a bad film.",1271635200,,506,4.451612903225806

2583257,2,B000FS9FIA,"The suspenseful setting was set in place, only thing missing was that this movie really just didn't have it.

The scary ghost lady in the movie isn't even scary! I make plain reviews just to go right out and say it. I'm not going to fabricate everything with complicated words.

This movie was boring and unoriginal. At least make the ghost/demon look scary, it just looks like a normal lady with wide eyes. Honestly, all these Asian chicks look like the ghost, they're all Asian folks with a scary faces. It's like sometimes I can't tell the difference if I'm either seeing a demon or just another Asian chick in the movie. You know the movie is bad because they can't even make a good enough ghost to help you tell the difference.

Don't waste your time, but if you want to watch it out of curiousity, go ahead. I thought it was going to be great, boy was I bored out of my mind.",1226620800,2,881,4.327272727272727
2583258,4,B000FS9FIA,"If you judge the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cello/dp/B000FS9FIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cello</a>&nbsp;based upon the glammed up DVD cover or the recent string of sub-par Asian horror remakes, you are bound to miss the subtle nuances that make this a very good movie.  True, the movie is based upon some common horror suspense themes.  Yes, there is a revenge aspect and an element of the beyond.  But there is also a very well crafted story of guilt and regret, as well as an intriguing plot structure that is full of small details expertly sprinkled throughout.  And contrary to a common belief that seems to be held about this movie, as far as I can tell the cello is not haunted.

The film is shot beautifully and makes equal use of darkness and light for various scenes.  There is a somewhat mixed use of CG darkness (you will have to see for yourself to understand what I mean) that sometimes seems to be an add-on.  But overall, this is a slick looking film.

The cast is made up of some big stars of Korean film, as well as some relative unknowns.  The results are very impressive and the entire cast does a good job.

The film makes greater use of plot and character development to build suspense.  There is some use of special effects but not really too much gore.  This is a slow moving movie that is meant to be analyzed.  If that's not your kind of horror, then you have been warned.

Conclusion

The final scene of the movie does bring to mind Asian horror remakes like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grudge/dp/B0006SGYL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grudge</a>&nbsp;and it might be the reason why so many have judged this movie harshly.  Despite the similarities with other movies, this one still is very well executed.  It was definitely entertaining and it was fun to figure out the riddles behind what was going on.  I recommend it.
