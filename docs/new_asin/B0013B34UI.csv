8249699,5,B0013B34UI,This was a surprisingly good movie. I have watched it 4+ times in the last week. The story line is simple but has a great message for all to appreciate.,1391299200,,152,4.1
8249700,2,B0013B34UI,"In this 2006 Polish romantic comedy things are going quite well for Michal (Maciej Zakoscielny), a dashing, Warsaw-based architect who has just secured a contract with a resort hotel and regularly mixes business with pleasure with the help of his associate and casual sex partner, Agata (Agnieszka Dygant).

Michal's hedonistic world is turned upside down when a cute, little girl, Michalina, knocks on his door introducing herself as his daughter. Michal immediately takes the girl to the police who inexplicably wash their hands of the matter (brazenly defying the viewer to suspend belief).

Michalina strikes a deal with Michal that she'll stay with him for a week and then return home to her mysterious mother. Lonely and good-hearted Michal quickly warms to the little girl and also warms to the lovely new associate who has joined his firm, Julia (Agnieszka Grochowska). At this point the viewer can already guess the film's ending. Julia confesses to Michal that years earlier she had had a schoolgirl crush on a certain boy, although he showed no interest. When a one-time casual encounter resulted in pregnancy, she moved out of the country but never gave up her feelings for the cad. Gee, I wonder who the guy was?

Michal falls for Julia but mistakenly believes she is seeing another man and ends the relationship. When he discovers the other man is Julia's brother, he chases her down and fireworks erupt as the loving couple embraces on the Sopot beach at film's end. The viewer learns that Julia's elaborate scheme was supported by Michal's associates, her family, and even the Warsaw police department!

Just Love Me was directed by Polish television director, Ryszard Zatorski. This is a slick but flyweight piece of barely-watchable fluff. Agnieszka Dygant rises above the simply atrocious script and gives the best performance in the film as the high-maintenance diva. Sorrowful beauty and talented actress, Agnieszka Grouchowska, Poland's Juliette Binoche, is wasted in this throw-away. It's sad to see one of Poland's former premier actresses, Grazyna Szapolowska, in a small cameo. On a positive note, the filming is well done; there are many striking scenes of Warsaw that Polish-American viewers will enjoy. The score is snappy but begins to grate after the first thirty minutes. I borrowed this film from the library so the only loss was my time.",1360281600,,2371,5.103092783505154
