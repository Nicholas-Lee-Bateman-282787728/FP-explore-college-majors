4189200,5,B003SPDSEO,"Based on a video game series that itself turned Japanese history into a comic book, this is the coolest anime show I've seen in quite some time. You see, the ""Sengoku"" of the title refers to the ""Sengoku"" or ""Warring States"" period of Japanese history, which lasted over 100 years and saw constant battle as numerous factions fought for territory and control. Several of the characters are even based on actual people...but here they are given flashy, colorful outfits that make them look like medieval superheroes/villains, weild badass kung-fu weapons, have nicknames like ""One-Eyed Dragon"", ""Tiger of Kai"" and ""The Devil King"", spout dialogue that sounds like Shakespeare on testosterone(it's cooler than it sounds), and use DBZ-style super powered martial-arts moves that defy the laws of physics. One character even has a motorcycle handle bars and exhaust pipes on his horse! If you think that sounds over the top...well, that's the whole idea.

I'll admit that some of the characters are fairly shallow (a couple don't even have any personality at all), but given the source material (the SB games have more action than plot) and that the series is so short & so crowded, it does good with what it's got. And its good points more than make up for its flaws. It has beautiful animation, high octane action scenes, good character moments between the mayhem, and even provides equal opportunity fan service (not only are there men with handsome/pretty faces and great bodies, it throws in a few hot babes, chiefly a well endowed ninja chick with a costume that also defies the laws of physics)! And really, you cant ask for much more than that in a good anime show.",1326240000,19,1669,4.897526501766785
4189201,4,B003SPDSEO,"I don't know if it is just my tv or what but when i watched this show online the dialogue was just a little too low (compared with the music and sound effects). I really liked the show though so I gladly bought the Blu-ray. To my dismay the sound was the same! Overall though great show! Fun characters, good music, diverse action, short and to the point (not much filler). I will say though that I'd watch episode 13 (bonus episode) before episode 12 (the finale). If you've purchased this having already seen it (duh I know) check it out that way is all I'm sayin. I though it was better.",1300492800,,590,4.276785714285714

4189205,5,B003SPDSEO,"""Basara"" is one of those hard-to-translate Japanese words.  It is thought to have its roots in the Sanscrit word for diamond, but the word has changed meaning over the years to something entirely different.  Historically, it refers to a period of time in Medieval Japan, called the Namboku-cho period, when the Imperial court was split between the North and South courts each struggling for legitimacy.  With Imperial control weakened, the common populace of Japan went topsy-turvy, rapidly developing an outrageous fashion sense full of bright fabrics and make-up and extravagant costumes normally forbidden by law.  Think of the Roaring 20s with flappers or the Zoot Suits of the 1930s and 40s.

The Basara fashion was officially outlawed during the Sengoku period when the lords began to re-exercise military control over the populace.  But the word has survived to the modern day for any over-the-top extravagant display of excess, like in the Basara Matsuri of Nara city.

Which brings us to ""Sengoku Basara.""  The anime perfectly captures the feel of basara, that over-the-top extravagant display of excess, but this time imprinted over the main warlords of the Sengoku warring states period. (The irony here is that it was those same warlords who put an end to basara...).

Based on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sengoku-Basara/dp/B002X9KYD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sengoku Basara</a>&nbsp;video game series, the anime brings to the battle the opposing armies of Takeda Shingen, Uesugi Kenshin, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Oda Nobunaga, each of them vying for control of Japan.  The names are about the only thing these characters have in common with the historical figures. Takeda Shingen is the ""Tiger of Kai,"" with a fierce red headdress and the ability to leap high into the air and come crashing down with his massive spear.  He rides his horse standing on the back of the saddle.  His right-hand man, Sanada Yukimura, is also a red-clad leaper with two spears capable of tossing soldiers aside like a leaf-blower plowing through dry autumn foliage.

Even with all the superpowers flying around, you might think that ""Sengoku Basara"" is going to stay somewhat historical.  You are wrong.  When Tokugawa Ieyasu brings forth his greatest general, Honda Tadakatsu, he doesn't come riding in on a horse, but flying through a plasma-fueled jetpack and with a massive drill for an arm.  At that point you know; all bets are off.

I loved ""Segoku Basara.""  It is that great kind of shut-off-your-brain anime that delivers action and intrigue and comedy and pathos and some really great characters.  Basing the series on historical events got me huffing at first, but I realized historical accuracy is far away from the point of the series and I just told my thinking brain to shut up and had a great time.

The first few episodes are rapid-fire action, but things eventually calm down to get to some deeper personal conflict and characterization.  The series has a nice balance between the quite episodes and the loud ones.  And with ""Samurai Basara,"" the loud episodes are really, really loud.

This release from Funimation has the complete First Season, with thirteen episodes on two DVDs.  Season Two brings in the one person obviously missing from ""Sengoku Basara,"" Toyotomi Hideyoshi.  I will definitely be there for the fireworks to start.",1289433600,8,3395,5.265799256505576
4189206,5,B003SPDSEO,"Based on the world of the Sengoku Basara videogames which are [loosely] based on the infamous Sengoku Period in Japanese history, Sengoku Basara is a mish-mash of explosive action, slapstick comedy, and romance caught in a whirlwind war for supremacy. In the words of a reviewer on ANN, it's ""JAPANESE HISTORY MAXIMUM"". And I loved every second of it.

Story:
While the Japanese audience are very familiar with the Sengoku period and its many players, us foreigners might have a bit of a rough time recognizing the famous samurai and battles that pepper the Sengoku Basara universe. With a large cast, SB works quickly to familiarize viewers with the varied generals and their respective heavily-named territories, focusing especially on Masamune Date, the Big Boss of Oshu [an utter badass] and Lord Shingen and his (servant? protege?) Yukimura Sanada of the Takeda Clan. Main villain Oda Nobunaga (he has one HELL of a theme song) explodes onto the scene in episode 2 leaving a wake of blood, fire and lightning in his path and forcing the generals of Japan into a somewhat uneasy alliance to try and take him down. I don't want to give away too much, but essentially the series revolves around the east, west, and Nobunaga fighting eachother. While this seems like moody and heavy stuff, SB manages to balance its relatively dark material with hilarious character interaction (I never get tired of Shingen punching the hell out of Yukimura), stirring drama and a refreshingly modern sensibility. Fans of the series (or of the sengoku period) will be able to follow the series kinetic pace easily as it reflects the games' pace, however new-comers to the series may be lost in a swirling vortex: utterly confused but dazzled at the same time. While prior knowledge is not necessary to enjoy the show, it certainly helps to know who the characters are ahead of time, else you'll be confused just who that old guy bein shot on the beach is [Yoshihiro Shimazu, if anyone is wondering].

Characters:
While there are a lot of them, luckily each is easily recognizable due to interesting character design and memorable personalities. You'll definitely find a handful of characters that you just adore, and even the ones you don't like very much have some worthy quality to them that makes them intriguing. Each character has a signature style and the voice actors portray their roles exceptionally well. The generals are utterly over the top in terms of fighting strength (they blow up MOUNTAINS) but it is just so much fun to watch and seems believable within the context of the universe. There are some inside jokes about the characters that pop-up that might not be recognizable to an audience not familiar with the Sengoku Period, but a quick trip to wikipedia fixes that up in a jiffy.

Animation:
I ordered the Blu-Ray and WOW does this series look good! Almost movie-quality animation that is awe-inspiring to behold, particularly the lightning fast fight scenes that roar off the screen. Simply gorgeous!!

Music:
Epic pulse-pounding rock music and war drums is this series bread and butter, and it serves well to the overall intense atmosphere and adds a dramatic flourish to the fight scenes. The OP and the ED fit the mood of the show and, I daresay, make your spirit soar with passion!! hell yeah! PUT YA GUNS ON!!!

Final Verdict:

Great for hardcore anime vets, great for fighting game fans, fans of samurai or Japanese history, fans of giant robots (yes, there is a giant robot character), great for even non-anime fans who need a gateway drug- man, this show is awesome. A fantastic choice for a viewing in an anime club or just about anywhere. While newbies to the show may be confused story-wise, but the story is not the main focus of the show: awesomeness is. No matter who watches it, you'll find something to like about SB. And for 35$? You can't go wrong people!! BUY IT.",1288137600,21,3890,4.833333333333333

4189208,4,B003SPDSEO,I have yet to watch it so this review isn't based on the quality of the product. Amazon has this listed as the complete series but it is actually only the first season which consists of 13 episodes. I would of waited for a price drop had I known it was only the 1st season. I think $49.99 is kind of high for 13 30-minute long episodes.,1286841600,10,336,4.029850746268656
4189229,5,B003SPDSEO,My first time watching this anime. I saw a lot of good reviews on this so i decided to buy it and when I was watching i liked the anime.

4189236,4,B003SPDSEO,"This is the first season of Sengoku Basara, Episodes 1-13. Blu-Ray/DVD Combo. It's 4 Disc (2 for DVD and 2 for Blu-Ray). The only special features are these chibi mini shorts. I have yet to watch them but I may in the future. Now on to my somewhat, disoriented review:

Ok to start with, I did like it, but at the same time I didn't. The main plot is to bring opposing forces together to take out the Devil King (Nobunaga Oda). The reason I am having conflicted feelings is because there were times when the anime is random and didn't really make much sense. I also didn't care for how they portrayed Yukimura Sanada. He was overall childish and annoying. My favorite character was probably Masamune Date. He seemed pretty straight on and serious about everything. I can tell you it doesn't follow Japanese History but that's obviously okay because its an anime. Overall the voice acting was really good and the blu-ray was very nice. I could definitely notice a difference between it and the dvd. The only other complaint I have is the last 2 episodes of the dvd. Episode 12 should have been the last episode and episode 13 should have been episode 12. You will know what I mean when you watch it.",1341964800,,1198,4.495412844036697
4189237,4,B003SPDSEO,"Yes, that is ghuys, not guys. The words of Date Masamune in this series always sound better when you add his little accent.

If there is any series done which reeks of more testosterone fueled action than Basara, I haven't seen it yet. This series takes the warring states period and injects it with a dose of about 1000 energy drinks. Is it meant to be accurate? No. Is it meant to obey the laws of physics? No. Is it meant to be an action packed show where bitter enemies band together to face a common foe? Yes.

That is mostly what both seasons sum up to be. It is not an over the top emotional drama story or a feel good story where enemies come to love each other. It is an action series showing the strength found when rivals put aside differences and join forces. The two most prominent heroes are the ones gracing the box cover: Sanada Yukimura and Date Masamune. The epic rivalry between these two knows no end. Their battles always engulf entire battlefields and regular soldiers are but ants before them.

Sounds wild, off the wall, and a bit over the top right? Well, that is mostly what this series is about. However, there is some story mixed into this parade of sword slinging action. Most centers around Yukimura and Masamune. But as you get to meet more Sengoku generals, you will find some rather fun characters in the mix. This is after all, a very big series in Japan. We only get the ripples from this in the form of the anime and video games.

But that doesn't mean this show isn't without it's issues. Yes that is a 4 star rating up there, but I would rank it more a 4-4.5. Why not a solid 5? Because the two seasons are really not all that different. Events are different but the same general structure is there. Don't expect the general flow of the plot to change much between season 1 and 2. Everyone happy killing each other...nemesis arises to threaten their fun, beats them up a bit...rivals ally to defeat nemesis...everyone goes back to killing each other in peace. It is almost the kind of plot you'd find from an old superhero show.

So why on earth is it any good? Simple. The characters, the action, and even some of the bits of backstory...it all molds together well and it keeps you watching. Despite the predictable flow, I can't fault it for serving it's purpose of being great entertainment. This show isn't going to win Academy Awards, but if you want an action packed, sword slinging, good time...can't go wrong with Sengoku Basara.",1330560000,14,2475,4.478935698447893
4189238,1,B003SPDSEO,"Not plot what so ever, just random battles that really have no point and always have the same predicted outcome, the episodes just clump together into a huge hiliariously confusing clump of random ""semi-violent"" battles between the generals. if you have ever played dynasty warriors its like watching a friend play and he/she never wins and plays the same general over and over. very glad i only purchased the first season do not buy if you like comprehensive storytelling and decent plot. I would not reccomend this product for anyone who has watched DBZ, DBZ in comparison is on a whole other level compaired to this anime series they atleast have a direction and the fights are way more believable ""i know lol how is that possible flying green aliens are more realistic than a motorcycle horse that has no real function and superhuman generals that never seem to kill each other"".One star for not even holding my attention for more than 5 episodes waste of time and money",1330473600,4,974,4.769230769230769
