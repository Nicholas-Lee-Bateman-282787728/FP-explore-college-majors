684692,2,6303566537,"As with other magnetic media, I was so looking forward to getting rid of my old VHS cassette of Mr. North, and so I bought this movie in DVD format.  Fortunately, I kept the original release, having had negative experiences in the past with re-releases (masquerading as remastery.  HINT!  Remastery is nothing more than a ""BS"" code word for modern technological vandalizm.  Some idiot decides to tinker, tweak, carve up, butcher, mangle, and thoroughly destroy an original work of art by superimposing their spin on a story. They chop up someone elses work and make a kindergarten collage of the pieces and then pawn it off as a ""Remastery.""  What a crock!  Fortunately, Mr. North suffers this indignity in only a few minor ways.  The opening credits have been reworked, replacing the opening scenes of Mr. North's bicycle trek around Rhode Island with some hoaky billboard style credits.  The opening music still plays, but there are no visuals.  And, somewhere along the way, 3 minutes have been added to the overall length of the original film, but I haven't quite figured out where that was done yet.  This is just one example of the many negative reviews I have submitted regarding remastery at its very worst. Many artists, (musicians, film producers, directors, etc.) in all forms of media have had their works destroyed in this fashion.  Buddy Holly's original master recordings have mostly been overdubbed, and the film ""The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea""  was chopped all to hell shortly before its release on VHS back in the 80's.  It's akin to drawing a mustache on the original Mona Lisa in the Louvre museum, or busting the head off of Michaelangelo's David. I recommend you buy an older VHS copy of this film and transfer it to DVD yourself.",1279152000,2,1766,4.80794701986755
684693,4,6303566537,"This is a wonderful, feel good movie.  It, of course, has some ""OMG, how can this be happening moments"", too. It's set in a beautiful area and is very well done with lots of easy to recognize stars.",1256256000,,198,4.2105263157894735
684694,5,6303566537,"What a movie !!!! What a cast !!!! Anthony Edwards, Robert Mithchum, Mary Kay Place, Anjelica Huston, Harry Dean Stanton, Lauren Bacall and so many more.....  What a great idea to have a novie that says to kids.....you can try something out once,but it may not work.  If it does great but always be on the lookout for things not to work.  It was great.",1244332800,,352,4.384615384615385
684695,5,6303566537,"Based on Thornton Wilder's novel THEOPHILUS NORTH, this is, in its own quiet way, a magical picture. It's about a young college man who gives off electrical charges from his body (an old parlor trick); he comes to Newport one season early in the 20th century and begins to transform people. There is an exuberance and optimism that rub off on these stuffy summer people, and they begin to come to life in a way they've never experienced before. And, of course, there are those electrical charges, which some residents swear to as having magical healing powers. As reality, this movie would never work, but it has a fairy tale quality about it that transcends believability and allows us to just enjoy the proceedings. Definitely worth a watch.",1112486400,8,743,4.8125
684696,5,6303566537,"Just got the DVD, and forgot how wonderfully entertaining this film really is. Danny Huston's directorial debut was met with mixed reaction, but this film never fails to entertain. It's simple, sweet and a bit profound (based on Thornton Wilder) and the attention to 1920's period detail is intact. The most fun thing is the exemplary ensemble cast that Mr. Huston assembled (no doubt with help from father, John, who was co-writer). Anjelica Huston, Mary Stuart Masterson, Tammy Grimes, Virginia Madsen, Harry Dean Stanton, the wonderful Lauren Bacall, and, most notably, the GREAT Robert Mitchum. Holding it all together,in a wonderfully confident fashion, is a young Anthony Edwards in the title role. He is an Everyman, knowing he is better than his lot, talented and confident enough to fulfill his dream. A fine cameo from the great playwright, Christopher Durang, is also a pleasure. After a day of beating your brains out and wondering why life isn't better, watch this film and you'll feel good. Apparently, Mr. North was in all the right places at the right time... Hey! It COULD happen...(?)",1062115200,6,1102,5.06043956043956
684697,3,6303566537,"A delightful film!  Anthony Edwards is supported by a tremendous cast of characters including Robert Mitchum, Mary Stuart Masterson, Anjelica Huston, Lauren Bacall, Harry Dean Stanton, and Virgina Madsen.  Based on a novel by Thornton Wilder and directed by Danny Huston, the film, filmed on location in Newport, Rhode Island, captures the charm and innocence of the 1920s.  Anthony Edwards carries this film and makes the film, which would otherwise be simply mediocre, come to life.  A charming film well worth watching.",1025568000,14,522,5.329268292682927

684793,5,6303566537,"This is an excellent film rendition of the Thornton Wilder book Theophilus North.  It has an exceptional cast with Lauren Bacall, Robert Mitchum, Angelica Huston, Harry Dean Stanton, David Wayne and Anthony Edwards in a film depicting a young man looking to make a living tutoring the wealthy in 1926 era Newport Rhode Island.  Many good pictures of the cottages as a side benefit.
The very touching and poignant representation of a simple proclivity of Mr. North to have exceptional static electricity and the locals think that he is a faith healer.
His rights of passage into the local cottage service industry is very well portrayed by Danny Huston's direction and no doubt his father's guidance as this was John Huston's, I believe, final film.
It is a very good paen to both the direction of the Huston family and a good vehicle for Angelica and Anthony Edwards as he is being mentored by both Lauren Bacall and Harry Dean Stanton in their respective roles.
Also makes good use of the term in Latin of Ne Plus Ultra for comparative purposes.
Highly recommended for serious, literate fans of Thornton Wilder and the Huston Film Dynasty.",1427673600,,1140,4.841025641025641

684863,5,6303566537,"So happy to see Mr. North at Amazon with a good price - I have loved this film since first viewed many years ago - it's kind of zany, but really fun to watch, as Theopholis North sails effortlessly through the intricacies of the high altitude of early Newport, Rhode Island's society, with some very moving scenes, humorous encounters, and all because he gives off electric sparks when he touches someone.  Performances by many film favorites, are superb - Lauren Bacall, Anthony Edwards, Robert Mitchum as the troubled and wealthy patriarch, Angelic Huston (the movie is directed by her brother, Danny Huston, son and daughter of John Huston), Harry Dean Stanton, Tammy Grimes, Virginia Madsen, David Warner as the corrupted doctor who gets his ""comeuppance"" in a whacy courtroom scene.  If you want to experience a really good time, see this film!  And I trust, like me, you experience shivers and tears when North is introduced to the old German lady who has given up on life, and inspires her never to give up in one of most touching scenes ever. . .",1412035200,,1054,4.748633879781421

684866,5,6303566537,"This is one of those little films that never got traction with the public, but which gain cult followings for decades. Others have summarized the plot. I will just say that the wonderful actors, stars and characters were perfectly cast in their roles. The plot has a childlike quality to it, which adds to its charm. This is a movie about goodness. and, as we all would like to believe, goodness wins out in the end. It isn't The Princess Bride, but it's the same kind of film. This is a movie to go back to after spending too much time watching the news or reading about the economy.",1402617600,,584,4.36697247706422
684867,5,6303566537,"The novel is so much richer in its character development and story line.  But one has only an hour and a half or so to try and tell a story.  On its own merits, the story told is worth the time spent watching the craft of film making.  Good story line, decent character development, good outcome, in short, a pleasure to watch.  I think the screen writers selected the most relevant material for thier story.",1402444800,,408,4.4

and to have 'Mr North to end up with Anjelica Houston who even with hair pulled back and tons of make up still looked like she was his mother! def not someone North would 'fall in love' with. i mean he went from Virginia Madsen to Anjelica? yea right! so wanted to like this movie but after a few days of just being able to only watch 30 mins at a time as i had to fight to stay awake this dvd will b going up in the used 'for sale' for a penny! i hope i get that!",1397520000,,822,3.987878787878788

684922,5,6303566537,"This little known movie, a comedic romp, through pre-depression Newport's wealthy residences, from their servant's perspective. It probably did not make many waves, in Hollywood's pond, but for someone like me...
I like feel-good movies, I am addicted to these easy going, cinematic, adaptations of good, solid, author's works. (I have been meaning to read Thornton Wilder's book, ""Theopholis North"", from which this movie came. I just have to find the time).
The cast, is a wonderful blend of revered Hollywood Icons, and good, solid, character actors. Anthony Edwards plays T Theopholis North, supported by, Robert Mitchum, Lauren Bacall, Harry Dean Stanton, Angelica Houston, Virginia Madsen, Tammy Grimes and Mary Stewart Masterson, in Danny Houston's directorial debut.
I found this in DVD format at Amazon.com. I had worn out my old VHS copy. I actually watch it when I need a little cheering up, or when I am discouraged a bit.
I would recommend ""MR. North"" to anyone, or any family, who are tired of the same old, profane grind, out of Hollywood. It should be G rated, but it has just enough action, and innuendo, to bump up it's rating to PG.
I hope that you buy a copy and enjoy it like I do.",1381536000,,1202,4.839805825242719
684923,4,6303566537,"I liked this movie, but after reading the book it seemed a bit of a disappointment.  I guess that is the price you pay for trying to squeeze a lot of book into just 2 hours of movie.  Still, I liked the movie in it's own right.  I liked the actors and I liked the light way it was treated.  The book (Theophilus North by Thornton Wilder) was written late in the life of the author and was more like a series of stories about the same place and time (Newport, Rhode Island in the 20's).  It was probably written from the journals and notes of the author and so had characters who were more fleshed out and stories of the same nature.  This movie adapted from the book was in need of a mini-series to properly do it justice.  It was the last project for John Houston who was replaced in the movie by Robert Mitchum because of his death.  I recommend the movie and more importantly the book, both of which I bought through Amazon.",1379808000,2,927,4.19774011299435

684925,5,6303566537,This movie depicted Newport in the early 20th century. Mr North was new to the town and learned what it was like to associate with the rich by teaching/tutoring the young and reading to the old. He became a hero... Watch this movie!,1348099200,,232,4.4186046511627906
684926,3,6303566537,"For the most part, this is a cute movie.  However, if you kids old enough to catch certain actions and language [mine are 10 & 12] - this isn't for them. There are a couple of scenes and lines that caught us off guard!",1324512000,,218,3.9545454545454546
684927,3,6303566537,"I feel like the Debbie-Downer at this party.  I enjoyed the movie for what it was: a feel-good, high comedy - and I do think Anthony Edwards did a very admirable job.  However, having read Thorton Wilder's book first, it cannot compare.  I think the most thought-provoking situations - and some very important characters - were left out.  I also felt the emphasis on the ""magic"" took away from the more profound meaning conveyed in the book.  I wonder if the other reviewers read the book and, again, I probably would have a more favorable view of it had I not.  It's cliche to say the book is better than the movie but in this case that is most certainly the case.  For those who enthusiatically enjoyed the movie, I encourage you to read Mr. Wilder's wonderful and delighful book.",1322265600,,782,4.542857142857143
684928,5,6303566537,What a great story depicting an interesting time period. Anthony Edwards is fantastic and I so enjoyed the roles of Robert Mitchum and Angelica Huston.  I watch this movie over and over. It's funny and sweet.,1302048000,,208,4.777777777777778
684929,5,6303566537,"I have to admit that I am biased. I have always liked Anthony Edwards, Robert Mitchum, Lauren Bacall, and Virginia Madsden. Yet it was this film that exposed me to the the fact that Ms. Huston could act in subtle unseen ways. Needless to say this is one of my most favorite films. I won't tell you the plot, but suffice to say that Mr. North finds us like we all, scraping to get by. Only Mr. North has decided to have an adventure while doing it. Now isn't that the way to live life until someone covers you up with sod, Live life as an adventure.
Thorton Wilder's Mr. North has it right, & Anthony Edwards shines in this role!",1284076800,,628,4.198347107438017
