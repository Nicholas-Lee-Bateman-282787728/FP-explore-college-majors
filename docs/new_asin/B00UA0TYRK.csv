7031427,5,B00UA0TYRK,"This is an awesome documentary/collection of moments and matches from one of professional wrestling's biggest, and often underrated, legends!  The documentary is great!  Vince McMahon, Jim Ross, Bret Hart, Lance Russell, Michael Cole, and many others offer insight on The King's career.  Jerry Lawler has had such a lengthy and notable career, the documentary could have lasted an additional hour and it still would have not covered all of the major aspects of his career.  One nice piece is on the announcing duo of Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler, which is a team that is often left off of best announcer duos.  I would have loved for a chapter to have been devoted to the ECW feud that Lawler had.  Likewise, more time could have spent on the legendary feud he had with Bret Hart in the 90's.  It's a shame that they could not get the rights to actually show the Kaufman-Lawler segment from Letterman.

As for the extras, there are tons of matches and segments from the King's career that will entertain fans from all eras.  The inclusion of his WWE debut was a nice touch.  The original Lawler-Flair match from Memphis is a Blu-Ray extra and the 2004 WWE match is an extra on both versions.  The empty arena match with Funk is on here, as is the Kaufman match.  The Kiss My Foot match with Bret is on here, as is the KOTR match with Roddy Piper from 1994.  However, there are many more matches that could be put on another release if this one sells and it ever comes to be.  His ECW debut would have been an awesome addition.  Bret Hart and Lawler had some matches in 1993 that were recorded in Memphis, with Lawler as the babyface that would have been awesome additions.  There was also a tag team match that happened in 2004 at a house show in Memphis where Lawler teamed with Randy Orton to face Ric Flair and Triple H in the main event.  This is also recorded somewhere because some of it was shown on Memphis TV during that time frame.

Overall, it is a strong documentary and a fun match collection for any wrestling fan!  Long live The King and learn more about one of the most talented and successful superstars in professional wrestling history!",1432684800,,2157,4.5271317829457365

7031429,2,B00UA0TYRK,"For those pro wrestling (excuse me, ""sports entertainment"") fans who only know Jerry Lawler as a commentator, this documentary/sampler is required viewing. They briefly touch on many of the high points of the King's storied career, from his early childhood to his first exposure to local (Memphis) wrestling. From starting out on ""outlaw"" cards to befriending local legend ""Fabulous"" Jackie Fargo. From becoming the biggest wrestling star ever in Memphis (one of the hottest territories in the country), to crossing over to the WWF. This is an adequate introduction to easily one of the top 10 wrestlers of all time... an introduction desperately needed in these days of post-McMahon history revision.

However, for anyone who grew up with the King, or has went back and intensely studied his long career, this collection is the pits!!! Barely any Memphis material is included, certainly not enough to paint a true picture of how great Lawler was/is... of the dozens and dozens of classic promos he cut on so many other wrestlers, absolutely none are included in their entirety. Of the 25 years of prime matches Lawler had in Memphis, less than 10 are included in their entirety. With the exception of the classic feud with Andy Kaufman, every single one of the great programs Lawler was involved with gets short shrift. Joe LeDuc? Dream Machine? Hulk Hogan? Randy Savage? Ken Patera? Jesse Ventura? Dutch Mantel? Either totally ignored or barely given a nod... particularly conspicuous in it's absence is the classic Lawler/Jimmy Hart feud... a feud that practically guaranteed sell outs for close to 4 years straight!!! A rich, varied history which could have been given serious consideration is barely given a nod in this weak documentary/biography.

On the flip side, an inordinate amount of time/space/footage is given over to Lawler's embarrassing WWF/WWE career as a perverted announcer and all around clown. Of so many performers who have had their legacy crapped on by McMahon's media flunkies, Lawler's is most tragic... the Memphis territory, with Lawler firmly positioned as main event, was the only promotion to withstand McMahon's underhanded, borderline illegal, business practices to take over wrestling. WWE couldn't gain a firm foothold on Memphis until the Attitude Era. Memphis was the last territory standing. Thanks to the drawing power of Lawler. And, of course, from the time he stepped foot in the WWF/E, he was portrayed as a goof. So, instead of awesome, hard-hitting matches in cages or barbed wire, we are treated to the entire ""Kiss My Foot"" match that immediately devalued Lawler in the WWF. Instead of even mentioning Lawler's local sports show, we get whole episodes of ""King's Court"" (Piper's Pit ripoff), where the King is insulted by pseudo-celebrity Tiny Tim and actually hip tossed by Captain Kirk, William Shatner... sigh...

How the corporate flack that puts these things together could mess something up so badly boggles the mind. Lawler has more talent in his big toe than 99% of the ""superstars"" that have come in his wake (including the current crop of steroid hags who have to do everything from risking life and limb to marrying the boss's daughter to insure a place in the biz), and, had they been wise, they could have really created a great program here. As it is, this is very mediocre to those in the know... if you'd like to see a better look at Lawler in general and Memphis in particular, check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memphis-Heat-The-True-Story-of-Memphis-Wrasslin/dp/B009FIN4V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memphis Heat: The True Story of Memphis Wrasslin'</a>",1432512000,22,3670,5.291595197255575
7031430,3,B00UA0TYRK,I was really looking forward to the set when I heard there would be a documentary. It skipped so much that it just took away from the overall product. A guy who has been around for as long as Jerry Lawler has needs more than 1 hour and 20 minutes to tell his history. No real mention of his historic rivalries with Bill Dundee and Eddie Gilbert. No mention of his USWA feud with the WWF invaders. Just had so much potential and fell flat.,1432425600,8,438,4.1647058823529415

Would of liked to seen more on the USWA time but that's just me.  However, I found the match selection very lacking.  I was looking forward to seeing the Lawler/Hennig match where he won the AWA title but they opted to instead throw on there a match where Lawler wins by countout.  WTH?  And instead of showing him unifying the AWA & WCCW championships they show a match where he & Kerry go to a double DQ.  I realize everything is slanted WWE's way but come on, these were 2 of biggest matches I ever saw of Lawler and instead they give us this crap.  So, I'd say if you're looking for classic Lawler matches you may have to look elsewhere because, in my opinion, this one comes up lacking as far as matches go.",1442620800,2,847,4.276729559748428

7031496,4,B00UA0TYRK,"He's one of the rare men in this business who was worked in aspects of the business from an owner to announcer to talent and be successful at each one along with being probably being known more for his talking than wrestling ability but despite other's being known & claiming his title to this day that he's the top name in wrestling when people refer to ""The King"" in Jerry Lawler with his career presentation being showcased here.  You hear from Lawler himself (while showcasing his artwork on the various subjects) throughout the presentation along with other superstars & personalities such as Jimmy Hart, wrestling editor Bill Apter, former Memphis Wrestling personalities Jerry Jarrett & Lance Russell & Jerry Calhoun, Vince McMahon, Harvey Whippleman, Superstar Bill Dundee, Brian Christopher, Gerald Brisco, Jim Ross, Andy Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margules & his business partner Bob Zmuda, Michael Cole, Natayla, Bret Hart, Road Dogg, The Miz, his girlfriend Lauryn McBride, and his ex-wife Stacy ""The Kat"" Carter.

The documentary begins with Lawler talking about his ""Leave It To Beaver"" childhood such as the story of how he became such a fan of the city of Cleveland & his high school years such as what wresting personality that he actually went to high school with before going into what subject he took such an interest in & how that payed off for him in many different ways.  Jerry's start in the wrestling business was discussed next from how he lied & used his job to get booked to the story behind him actually becoming ""The King"" along with his crossover appeal throughout the territory & how that effected him as a father before talking about how he ended up become an owner of the territory.  One of the biggest discussions on this set is about his famous feud with actor Andy Kaufman such as who was the middle man that got these two together & how this feud made headlines not only the wrestling world but also in entertainment to the point where both men were on the David Letterman show before going into the struggles of the territory throughout the 1980's including a lawsuit he filed against WWE & issues with the AWA despite being the World Champion before discussing how Vince McMahon's steroid trial lead to Lawler coming to the WWE along with what he brought to the table as far as a character & eventually an announcer.  Why he decided to run for Mayor of Memphis, the issues that lead to his departure in 2001, what his original response to the WWE Hall Of Fame, and how his first challenge for the WWE Championship lead to his first WrestleMania match were discussed next before going into the specific details of his infamous heart attack on RAW with footage & audio never before seen with the documentary closing on everyone reflecting on Lawler's legacy.

Empty Arena Match vs. Terry Funk - I'm not sure if this was a first of it's kind but definitely a rare match in wrestling today this day as there wasn't no audience or a referee but only Lance Russell & a cameraman to document the fight between these two with Funk having plenty to say for minutes before the match started as this was nothing but a brawl with them fighting on the outside into the empty seats using whatever they could get their hands on as a weapon to the point where one man was bleeding while taking advantage of the environment such as delivering the piledriver on the concrete floor as this was very physical for it's time to the point where this ended with one man was hurt so bad that he was yelling for help.
""Memphis Wrestling"" Apr. '81

vs. Andy Kaufman - This was the infamous ""match"" where Lawler ended up ""losing the battle but winning the war"" & teaching Kaufman a wrestling lesson that send Andy to the hospital & both men eventually to 'Late Night With David Letterman' as this was more of a segment than a match but definitely one of the most famous ones in wrestling history.
""Memphis Wrestling"" Apr. '82

Southern Heavyweight Championship/No Disqualification/Loser Leaves Town Match vs. Bill Dundee - Both men knew each other so well that they had stalemates early on before one man was able to get the advantage only to lose it when he his opponent caught on to his strategy as both men would go back & forth trading fist along with using the other's momentum against them along with taking some high risk of their own while brawling on the outside taking advantage of the ringside environment to the point where one man was cut above the eye & the referee had to pull back one man when started getting too aggressive as this ultimately came down to who was able to catch the other.
""Memphis Wrestling"" June '83

vs. Eddie Gilbert - Gilbert was able to catch Lawler off guard early only for Lawler to deliver a move of his own that had the same effect with the match briefly making it's way to the outside in with both men delivering some impact in what was a quick match but competitive for what it was.
""Pro-Wrestling USA"" Oct. '84

vs. AWA Champion Curt Hennig - Hennig was attempting to stall & break any momentum Lawler could build for several minutes by constantly going to the ropes & the outside while attempting to trade punches only for Lawler to connecting more of them although one of the Hennig's punches delivered such impact that it sent Lawler out of the ring as the match continued in what was a pretty much a teaser for their later encounters that would be more competitive than this one.
""AWA Championship Wrestling"" Mar. '88

AWA Championship/Unification Match vs. WCCW Champion Kerry Von Erich - Both men were on the same page early as they executed one big move only to follow it up by showing off to the crowd followed by both men delivering a move that sent their opponent to the outside with one man gaining the upper-hand by eventually following up with various punches only for his opponent to return the punches right back as tempers getting so hot that nobody was going to get in their way of their fighting as a match that never really left first gear & more of a preview for their upcoming match months later at 'Super Clash'.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Sept. '88

vs. Jim Powers - Power came out aggressive attacking Lawler on the floor & even ramming him into the post before taking the action in the ring using power moves & coming off the top rope causing Lawler to keep retreating to the outside where he was constantly taunted by the fans & Randy Savage on commentary before he was able to take advantage of a mistiming using every dirty tactic he could to keep the advantage.
""RAW"""" Apr. '93

vs. Owen Hart - ""The Rocket"" was out for revenge against Lawler for all of Lawler's comments towards his family & his attack on Bret back at the King Of The Ring that year. This was back when Lawler was his ""comedic heel"" character as Owen Hart dominated this match & had Lawler beat various times until one mistake cost Owen the match.
""Wrestling Challenge"" July '93
[Legends Of Wrestling: Jerry Lawler & Junkyard Dog]

vs. Roddy Piper - This was the definition of a ""train wreck"" to the point where I'm not even going to try to summarize this match because it was just horrible...so horrible to the point where neither guy wanted to talk about it on Roddy Piper's DVD as they had no chemistry with each other & seemed like both had ""two left feet"" in the ring with the constant involvement of the other ""Roddy Piper"" only making matter worse.
King Of The Ring '94
[Legends Of Wrestling: Jerry Lawler & Junkyard Dog]

Casket Match vs. Undertaker - Lawler kept trying to avoid Taker & had to constantly cheat in order to get an advantage which we saw here as he resorted to low blows & punches with objects in his hands but that was only temporary as this for the most part was a dominate victory by Undertaker.
Sept. '94
[Undertaker: He Buries Them Alive]

Kiss My Foot Match vs. Bret Hart - This was the rematch from the previous month's ""In Your House"" with the special stipulation that the loser must kiss the foot of the winner resulting in Lawler making sure his foot had an absolutely horrible smell so Bret would have the worst experience possible if he lost. Bret was real aggressive from the start that came back to bite him giving Lawler control for a few moments before Bret got back control. Hakushi an appearance leading to Bret getting his revenge and for Lawler, that wasn't the only thing that didn't taste good.
King Of The Ring '95
[Legends Of Wrestling: Jerry Lawler & Junkyard Dog; Best Of King Of The Ring]

vs. Al Jackson - Lawler did his own commentary during this match while taking some shots at this opponent & the crowd until Jackson was able to take advantage of an opening Lawler gave causing Jerry to get more serious in a short match that did it's job.
""Superstars"" Mar. '96

vs. Jake Roberts - Lawler wore a specific football team's jersey & own snake bag full of items for Jake that made everyone want to kill him on top of other comments he had for Mark Henry sitting ringside to the point where Jake pulled out what was in his bag before the match followed by taking out all of his aggression for Lawler's comments about his past on the outside including some questionable tactics to the point where Lawler had to use his trademark dirty & illegal tactics just to survive.
SummerSlam '96
[Jake The Snake Roberts: Pick Your Poison]

w/Rob Van Dam vs. Headbangers - The Headbangers showed in the early moments that they had issues bending the rules in their favor as far as double teaming & antics behind the referee while singling out one member of the team keeping him grounded while Lawler used some dirty tactics of their own along with RVD's athleticism with his educated feet & top rope offense in an average match that's only noteworthy for RVD time in WWE as ""Mr. Monday Night"" associated with Lawler in his feud against ECW.
""Shotgun Saturday Night"" June '97

vs. Tommy Dreamer - Dreamer had out very aggressive from the start to the point where Lawler was bleeding in the opening seconds as they brawled around ringside & into the crowd using whatever he could get his hands on before Lawler was able to catch a break & returned the punishment using weapons of his along with his continuing to disrespect ECW in the process while continuing to use his dirty tactics to stop Dreamer whenever he was starting to build momentum as various allies & enemies to both men made appearances throughout the match including one that saw Beulah get involved in the match in what was a brawl from start to finish.
ECW Hardcore Heaven '97

w/Brian Christopher vs. Flash Funk & Scott Taylor - This wasn't much past a quick back & forth match to showcase Lawler & his son together with Brian being the workhorse of the team with Lawler picking his spots as both the legal & illegal man in the ring but only really noteworthy for one of the first interactions on WWE between two future tag team partners in Scotty 2 Hotty & Grandmaster Sexay.
""Shotgun Saturday Night"" Oct. '97

vs. Tazz - Tazz came out mocking Jim Ross about the incident between them on SmackDown allowing Lawler to blind side him with a punch & work him over before Taz was able to recover with his own series of strikes & punches while constantly having words with J.R. at ringside to the point where one man payed for opening his mouth one too many times.
SummerSlam '00

vs. Ric Flair - This was Lawler's birthday & given a special ""Legends Match"" against Flair with Lawler playing his own mind games against Flair early through his taunts or physical actions that knocked Flair down as they traded momentum early with Flair's chops & Lawler's punches along with executing their trademark offensive moves before one man delivered a move that ended up hurting himself allowing his opponent to take advantage in a solid match that was more about it's historical factor as this was only the fourth time they faced each other despite their long careers spanning decades.
""RAW"" Nov. '04

T.L.C. Match vs. WWE Champion The Miz - As a birthday gift for Lawler, he got his first ever WWE Championship match...which also happened to be in his first T.L.C. match as well & it should be noted that C.M. Punk was on commentary during this match. This started off as a wrestling match before Miz started using the chair only for Lawler to return the favor after miscommunication from Alex Riley gave Lawler an advantage. Miz was the first one to taste the ladder before Riley paid for getting involved one too many times but Miz was able to recover & worked over Lawler's back with a suplex onto a chair & several chairshots. Lawler kept fighting back but it was the unexpected involvement of someone nobody expected that helped The Miz retain.
""RAW"" Nov. '10
[Blu-Ray edition of The Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

w/Special Guest Referee Steve Austin vs. Michael Cole - Booker T & Jim Ross joined Matthews to do commentary during this match. This match was almost a carbon copy of the Bret Hart vs. Vince McMahon match from last year's Mania where it build for so long that people wanted to see Lawler beat the hell out of Cole & we got good moments with Cole hiding in the ""Cole Mine"", the interaction between Austin & Swagger, and Austin forgetting this is a ""PG"" show with his censored language.  Unfortunately, the match was booked TOO LONG with Michael Cole on the offensive to the point where I didn't care if Lawler beat him up, I just wanted it over. The aftermath of the match actually entertained me more than the match itself.  The tag match from Extreme Rules or the ""Kiss My Foot"" rematch would have been better choices than this which unfortunately was Lawler's Mania debut.
WrestleMania XXVII

(Blu-Ray) vs. NWA Champion Ric Flair - This was Flair's first time at the Memphis Wrestling television studio which started as a verbal confrontation leading to a 10 min. match between both men with each having the same idea as far as working over a specific area of the body as each man traded momentum working each other over & countering the other's offense or using their opponent's own momentum against them before the way things ended didn't settle for one opponent only for him to make a request that he would later regret in what was a solid encounter.
""Memphis Wrestling"" Aug. '82

(Blu-Ray) ""Wrestler vs. Boxer & Manager"" Match vs. Andy Kaufman & Jimmy Hart - Lawler was able to take out each man one at a time including using the partners against each other before they resorted to some tactics to finally get the advantage for themselves which only made Lawler ""pull the strap down"" using Kaufman & Hart to use even more tactics in a match that was entertaining for what it was designed to be.
""Memphis Wrestling"" Nov. '83

Along with matches are bonus segments such as a promo on becoming the AWA Champion, his WWE debut, interrupting Bret Hart's coronation, him confronting Bret Hart's parents during a match, a moment when his arrival to the ring didn't go as planned, the training vignettes for the Kiss My Foot match, his debate with ECW owner Paul Heyman, and his Hall Of Fame induction.  Also included are various editions of the ""King's Court"" featuring Giant Gonzales, musician Tiny Tim, ""Roddy Piper"", and William Shatner.  Blu-Ray extras include a tag match from Ohio Valley Wrestling teaming with Nova vs. The Prototype (John Cena) & Sean O'Haire along with bonus stories along with another ""King's Court"" where he interviews himself & his birthday celebration after ""RAW"" from 2010.

I would have to say this presentation was a ""mixed bag"" as I did enjoy Lawler's documentary while some of the segments were entertaining & I enjoyed most of the matches throughout his career but felt that based off the amount of extras dedicated to it that something should have been said about his feud with Bret Hart in the main documentary since I feel that's the feud that made his career in WWE while I would have loved to see more of the vignettes & ""face to face"" confrontations with Bret than some of the easily forgettable matches of his WWE career (Jim Powers) while I understand the purpose of putting some of the matches on her to showcase a period or relationship in his career (his involvement with RVD becoming ""Mr. Monday Night"", teaming with his son Brian, first Mania match) that they were just easily forgettable as well as I would have liked more of his early career (there is more Lawler/AWA footage) or other matches that were quality (such as him winning the #1 contender battle royal in 2001).  In the end, I had more positives than negatives but ultimately I would only recommend for those who are fans of Lawler or the Memphis Wrestling territory but those who aren't I wouldn't get as most of the story & extras probably wouldn't interest or entertain you.

As a side note, for those who enjoy this presentation & want to know more about Memphis Wrestling to check out the independent documentary called ""Memphis Heat"" which features comments from Lawler himself along with other famous wrestling personalities featured & talked about on here such as Jimmy Hart & Jerry Jarrett & Jackie Fargo.",1433635200,8,17101,4.627101879327399
7031497,5,B00UA0TYRK,"When I think of wrestler Jerry The King Lawler, I think of the saying a big fish in a small pond; but oh what a big fish, and what a great pond! Jerry Lawler wrestled in Memphis, Tennessees Championship Wrestling Association (CWA), one of the many territories that dotted the North American landscape once upon a time. During the 1970s, 80s, and early 90s, he was Memphis wrestling, beginning in Nick Gulas National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) Mid America promotion then jumping ship with wrestler Jerry Jarrett when Jarrett formed the CWA. While other territories fell under the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) juggernaut, CWA held on, eventually teaming up with World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and becoming the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). The USWA would be the last of the territories and finally gave up the ghost during the Monday Night War.
Its Good to be the King: The Jerry Lawler Story is a new video release from the WWE covering the career of one of the greatest stars from the territory days. It includes a feature documentary on Lawlers career as well as a selection of some of his most memorable matches. Hopefully this production will give contemporary fans a greater appreciation of Lawlers tremendous impact on wrestling.
When this home video was announced, longtime fans of the King wondered how much could be shown of Lawlers prime years. Jerry Lawler wrestled in the Memphis region during the 1970s, 80s, and early 90s before coming to the WWF in 1992 where he worked as both a color commentator and wrestler. While the WWE owns many tape libraries from other promotions, Memphis is one of the handful of promotions whose tape library it does not own. Thus fans were uncertain how good the product would be without any footage from Memphis. Let me assure you that somehow, the WWE acquired footage from Memphis, including matches. They also have interviewed some of the key figures from Memphis including promoter Jerry Jarrett, manager Jimmy Mouth of the South Hart, legendary announcer Lance Russell (who deserves a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame), wrestler Superstar Bill Dundee (arguably Lawlers greatest rival), one of Lawlers ex-wives Stacy Carter (aka former diva the Cat), and Lawlers son Brian.
This documentary uses a nice framing device to tell Lawlers story, beginning with him in his art studio drawing a cartoon, and ending with him drawing a cartoon. The documentary feature provides a good overview of Lawlers life, dating back from his childhood to his love of drawing which helped break him into professional wrestling. If youve read Lawlers autobiography Its Good to be the KingSometimes, you're not going to learn much more (other than the events that took place after the book was published). Still, its a well-done bio albeit a little short coming in at a little over one hour and twenty two minutes.
Jerry Lawler worked in the Memphis area for most of his career. He was a great talker, an excellent brawler, a guy who knew how to take bumps, as well as someone who had a ton of charisma. He was by no means a mat technician but there have been many main eventers who didn't need technical skills to entertain the fans (Bruno Sammartino and Hulk Hogan are but two examples). More importantly, Lawlers style matched what Memphis fans had come to enjoy in the promotion-a lot of brawling. Like the WWWF and WWF of Sammartino and Hogan, the Memphis promotion relied more on fisticuffs than technical skills.
Since Lawler wrestled most of his career in the Memphis area, its puzzling to assess how he would have fared had he worked for other promotions. While he favored playing heel over face, he was excellent in either role. Lawler was capable of working sixty minute Broadways with world champions and did so against champions from the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and NWA. He also kept the fans coming back for more every week at the Mid-South Coliseum (which held 12,500 people). Thats every week! While Lawler could have worked elsewhere, he co-owned the Memphis territory with Jerry Jarrett and wasn't going anywhere.
While Memphis was known for its violent style, its wrestlers knew how to create the illusion of violence without joining the Spinal Fusion Club for Men favored by todays wrestlers. The promotion was renowned for its cornucopia of crazy stipulations. According to Online World of Wrestling, the first scaffold match was held in Memphis in 1971, pitting Jerry Jarrett against Don Greene.  While Memphis was not the first to have a hair match, it was one of the first and this stipulation was used frequently. In fact it was used so frequently between Jerry Lawler and arch-rival Superstar Bill Dundee, that after Dundee lost his hair to Lawler, he put up his wifes hair against Lawlers hair only to lose and see his wife lose her hair as well. If you could think of a stipulation, Memphis probably had it. After AWA World champion Nick Bockwinkel complained about challenger Jerry Lawlers uses of punches during a match, a stipulation was made that Lawler would pay a fine for every punch he threw (I think it was around $250/punch). Then there was the legendary Empty Arena Match between Terry Funk and Jerry Lawler which saw the two men compete in an empty Mid-South Coliseum after Funk claimed Lawler had an unfair advantage with a crowd cheering him on (this match is included on the DVD).
The wrestlers in the CWA kept very busy, traveling from town to town. Lawler recalls often working six nights a week, which was not unusual during the territory era but which still put a strain on a wrestlers family (and did with Lawler). The Mid-South Coliseum (originally built for the University of Memphis basketball team) housed wrestling every Monday. The arena held 12,500 people and while it had its ups and downs, Lawler claims it sold out sometimes ten or more weeks in a row. As one might imagine, promoters had to keep coming up with fresh ideas, wrestlers, and long-term booking, hence its use of crazy matches to bring in fans.
Like many territories, Memphis Wrestling had a constant influx and exit of wrestlers. As the king notes on the video, some of the biggest names in wrestling came through Memphis either on their way up the ladder in the industry or on their way down. World champions appeared as well including NWA World champions Jack Brisco and Ric Flair as well as AWA World champion Nick Bockwinkel. The promotion featured excellent tag team wrestling as well and helped launch the Second Golden Age of Tag Team Wrestling when it created the tag teams the Fabulous Ones and the Rock-n-Roll Express.
Of course no discussion of Memphis would be complete without spending time on the famous Andy Kaufman angle, an angle which Vince McMahon says on the video  that he still is jealous of to this day. Kaufman, a comedian and rising star in Hollywood, combined his love of professional wrestling with his love of self-promotion to proclaim himself Intergender Champion and defend the belt against female competitors. Kaufman approached WWF kingpin Vince McMahon Sr. about wrestling against women but Vince McMahon Sr. didn't like the idea and passed. Wrestling journalist Bill Apter then passed the idea on to Jerry Lawler. After one appearance by Kaufman proved successful, Lawler ran with the idea and eventually the two men met in the ring. The DVD discusses their historic match as well as their infamous appearance on David Lettermans show. Unfortunately like many things in Lawlers career, the DVD glosses over the program which led to a fairly lengthy feud. The program generated a ton of publicity for professional wrestling and led to the documentary Im from Hollywood.
While longtime fans and serious fans of wrestling history know about the Kaufman/Lawler feud, many may be surprised to learn that Lawler was set to work a program against the other king of Memphis (and the king of rock and roll); Elvis Presley.  According to Jerry Lawler, he heard of Elvis fascination with karate and discussed how cool it would be to face Elvis. Elvis father learned of Lawlers interest and told Lawler that Elvis, a lifelong wrestling fan, was very interested in working with the king of wrestling. First though, he had to get in shape for an upcoming tour. Sadly, Elvis Presley died just a few weeks later, not only depriving the fans of a rock legend but also, an interesting match.
While the majority of the documentary focuses on Lawlers days in Memphis, it does mention his work in the WWF, both as a wrestler and a color commentator. The documentary mentions how Lawler came to work for the WWF, explaining how Vince McMahon (who was a defendant in a federal criminal case over steroids) brought Jarrett in on standby to run the WWF should McMahon lose the trial and be imprisoned. Jarrett recommended Lawler to McMahon when he said he was looking for a good talker. A one night substitute gig on Monday Night RAW led to a continuous on-air presence only broken by Lawler quitting the company after his then-wife Stacy Carter was released from the company. The documentary feature showcases the chemistry between Lawler and McMahon and then discusses the legendary announcing team of Lawler and Jim Ross.
This is a good video but unfortunately it isn't long enough to go into detail on Lawlers career. Its a decent biography (especially for people who are unfamiliar with the kings career) but even an extra half hour could have been spent discussing the kings career. I would have liked to have seen a little more detail about the long running feud between Lawler and manager Jimmy Hart, Lawlers famous feuds with Superstar Bill Dundee, Austin Idol, and Tommy Rich. And of course they should have discussed the famous McMemphis angle where Vince McMahon sent WWF wrestlers to invade Memphis during the early 1990s and even appeared in Memphis himself as a heel, years before he played the Mr. McMahon character (fortunately most of these angles can be found in my book Wrestlings Greatest Moments).
Matchwise, you get a nice selection of the kings matches. Again, I have no idea how the WWE gained the rights to them but the video features some important matches in Lawlers career including the famous Empty Arena match against Terry Funk, the first Lawler/Kaufman match, the kings AWA World Title win, and his confrontation with NWA World champion Nature Boy Ric Flair. There are a lot of the kings matches from the WWE but like many fans of the king of wrestling, Im more interested in his Memphis work. By all means get the Blu-Ray as the extra cost is worth it just for the Flair/Lawler confrontation. I really enjoyed the video and recommend it for any fan of Jerry Lawler or for anyone who wants to learn about the career of a true legend in wrestling.",1433462400,,10773,4.856987493202827
7031498,4,B00UA0TYRK,"This set is good for what it is, but it could have been better.  I too wish there had been more Memphis footage on this set, but the reality is that was never actually going to happen.  Jerry Lawler owns the Memphis footage, so WWE actually has to pay him in order to use the footage.  Another obstacle is that most of the master footage no longer exists.  Back in the territorial days, promoters had no idea that the television shows would ever be worth anything, so they cut costs by recording over the master tapes several times until it became apparent they needed to use a new tape.  Therefore, a lot of the classic footage we would love to see only exists as crappy multi-generational VHS copies that can be found on You Tube.

As for the Memphis footage that is there, it was handpicked by Lawler himself, so likely it's all something that he considers special or important in some way.  I must say that although I had already seen most of it (and actually purchased most of it on DVD from people who actually had no right to sell it, but that's another story), each match had something that was worth it to me to purchase it again.  For instance, the video quality on the empty arena match is the best quality I had ever seen, and probably the best anyone has ever seen since it was originally broadcast.  The famous match against Andy Kaufman is shown in its entirety, from the entrance to the match itself down to waiting for the ambulance to arrive and take Andy Kaufman to the hospital.  I had never seen the entire thing before, so that was really cool.  One thing that's kind of interesting is that when watching that particular match, it was evident that they had pieced it together from at least three different sources.

Of course there was a lot of WWE content in the set; after all, it's a WWE production and they always try to portray someone's WWE stint as being the highlight of their career.  In fact, I'd be willing to bet that if they ever did a Terry Taylor DVD (why they would is beyond me, he was a good performer but never the top guy anywhere, but just suppose they did), they would try to portray his time as the Red Rooster as somehow being good for his career.  But I digress.

For Lawler's WWE footage that appears in this set, at least most of it was memorable in some way.  I'm just glad that they finally released a set on Jerry Lawler.  I don't need another Hulk Hogan, Shawn Michaels, or even Bret Hart set; I would like to see some more sets of masters like Lawler.  I don't know if this is helpful or not, it's just my attempt at putting a few somewhat incoherent thoughts down and trying to make sense of them.  Anyway, if you've never had the chance to see any Memphis wrestling, this is a decent place to start to see if you'd like to track down some more.",1433116800,,2800,4.329501915708812

I own a lot of these DVDs on the 80's guys and I can't honestly remember a collection where the featured wrestler has lost so many matches.
