8475915,3,B005JQQLQC,It would've been great if the audio didn't skip. I need to relax sometimes and when the waves crash I don't want the audio disturb the moment. The scenes are beautiful but some of them remind me of previous scenes.,1522627200,,214,4.375
8475916,5,B005JQQLQC,Just as advertised and better when you see it.  A great value for the price and options on the sound track,1516147200,,106,4.0476190476190474

8475919,3,B005JQQLQC,"I watched this for about just under an hour. Well, let's just say that ""I had it on."" There is certainly nothing too fabulous about this Blu-ray disc. There is no talk, no narration, but, there is an option for music. Just various 30 second to one minute scenes of various beaches all over Hawaii. I recognized many of the beaches I've been to on Oahu. So, that was about 2 minutes of ""just a step above being more interesting than the rest of this blu-ray as a whole.""

Now that I've seen the whole disc, I really don't have any idea why I would put it on again. Besides, I only live a couple miles from our beach in the Bay area. So, If I want to sit on the sand and listen to the rustling sea, our beaches are just fine.",1424822400,,723,4.055944055944056
8475920,4,B005JQQLQC,The only thing missing is the fragrance of mangos and sand fleas. Very nice.,1407715200,,76,4.5
