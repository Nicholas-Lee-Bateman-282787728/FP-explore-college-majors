7988863,4,B000093NOV,"Andromeda, back in its final season with a bang! Sure the show lost a chunk of the budget that they have had with previous seasons but that doesn't stop the writers from coming up with a nice season long story arc which delivers! Any sci-fi fan with a love of action should add this volume to their collection. Andromeda just plain ROCKS! (4 stars because we should be on collection 5 by NOW!)",1128729600,7,393,4.397260273972603
