Though Im a fan of replacement protagonist Sue Price and really wanted to like the sequels she starred in, I didn't before now and this movie certainly doesnt change things. Nemesis 4 is in some ways the most interesting of the sequels and definitely more fun than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/masterpiece-of-recycled-footage/dp/B000009QEP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">masterpiece of recycled footage</a>&nbsp;that preceded it, but its also a really bad action movie. As a matter of fact, I wouldnt even call this an action film: this is an exercise in bizarre sci-fi sexuality, playing to a crowd of select aficionados whose interests are represented here.

The story: In a dystopian future, Alex the part-human assassin (Price) kills the wrong target and is targeted by a procession of cyborg headhunters seeking revenge.

Because Price is a world-class bodybuilder in the hands of a director who takes advantage of every asset he has, the Nemesis sequels have always catered towards muscle appreciation by amply showing off Sues mighty form. However, while the two before this have sought to titillate, this one tries outright to get you off. Price spends at least a quarter of her screentime naked, her breasts and butt unabashedly displayed. The movie goes even further to appease musculophiles by featuring two scenes wherein a naked Alex kills cyborgs by strangling them with her legs  even causing Nicholas Guests (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer-4/dp/B0000ALPFJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer 4</a>) eyeballs to pop and ooze blue slime over everything. However, the highlights of the film are what the MPAA described as bizarre sexuality, for which a cyborg version of vaginal intercourse is graphically displayed and Alex has spikes protrude from her nipples to impale Norbert Weisser (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Express/dp/B0024FAG4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Express</a>).

I cant really say that this stuff is bad for what it is, and it does essentially supply the bulk of the films entertainment value, but I can argue that it takes the place of what should have been action scenes. Whats there in the way of action is extremely meager, limited to a tiny bit of gun-fighting for which Price never even broke a sweat. I would even be fine with that if the movie at least knew what to do with itself, but it turns out that this picture could be used as study material for Cinematic Idling 101. It starts good, with an entertainingly cryptic exchange between Alex and her handler (Andrew Divoff,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wishmaster/dp/0784011141/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wishmaster</a>) thats followed by a couple of the crazier scenes, but after that, the movie becomes about Alex staying in one place and waiting for things to happen to her. Even when things do happen, so much time is given over to fruitlessly long dialogue exchanges that its obvious director Pyun is stretching his material to reach the required runtime. Despite all the weirdness it has going for it, the movie ends up being boring, and thats the worst thing any movie can be.

I don't expect another one of these sequels to pop up, and in that regard, its disappointing that a series which had such a killer start petered out into this. The people who enjoy whats unique about this movie will probably *really* enjoy those parts, but beyond that, I don't see this one having too many fans. Sue Price seems to be done with acting, which is a shame given the underrepresentation of female bodybuilding outside of its own specific sector, but if films like these are a representation of what a longer career may have held in store for us, then I won't feel too bad about it.",1453420800,,4145,5.755301794453508
8026156,2,B0002CTRT6,Female bodybuilder Sue Price returns for the fourth installment in the Nemesis franchise.  She is a bounty hunter for hire who goes after one last kill.  Things go poorly and she soon learns she has been set up and is the target of every bounty hunter in the world.  She spends a lot of time naked and shows off her super-muscular physique but not much else happens.  Most of the characters spend their time talking and talking and talking.  This is by far the least action packed film in the Nemesis franchise.  Its just plain boring.  The special effects are just plain embarrassing.  This film obviously had a very low budget and it shows.  Avoid this snoozefest unless you like watching naked female bodybuilders.,1344384000,,717,4.717741935483871
8026157,3,B0002CTRT6,"This is the last act of the nemesis story and it should be the last. The story is just boring referring to part 2 and 3. Of course the ultimate star Sue Price does her work, some nude scenes for her fans are concluded, but the hole story, effects and handling have not the same quality like the other three parts.",1108771200,5,313,4.147540983606557
8026158,3,B0002CTRT6,"Nemesis 4 is the best in the series. At last we get Sue Price in near contest condition. In the previous installments she was soft and had a terrible cornrow hairstyle. In nemesis 4 she displays the physique, and hairstyle bodybuilding fans are accustomed to. This film also features faceless cameos by Sharon Bruneau & Debbie Muggli. Female muscle fans won't be disappointed.",994723200,3,376,4.984126984126984
8026159,1,B0002CTRT6,"I have professionally worked as a film critic, so I know film, and let me tell you freinds: NEMESIS 4: CRY OF ANGELS is no film.  Easily the worst entry in the series (which says a lot if you have seen the previous three)this movie manages to both confuse and sedate the viewer.  People have fallen into comas over less than the effect of watching this wretched display of total incompetence.  I would provide an overview of the plot and characters, but for the mental health and well-being of the reader I will refrain.  Besides, exposure to such poison could cause more heads to explode than all of the SCANNERS films combined.  Coincidentally, SCANNERS comes across as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY when compared to this movie.  Angels do indeed cry- every time a copy of NEMISIS 4 is put into a vcr.",994550400,4,795,4.563380281690141
