8224842,4,B000WPGXWW,"This was not at all what I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be a DVD of Debbie's paintings but instead it was a DVD of Debbie explaining Revelations through her one painting. I found it fascinating. The painting technique would probably be described as basic early folk art. The painting is one large picture comprised of smaller tableau's depicting different scenes from Revelations. Revelations is definitely a picture rather than a word view of the future. Debbie stands in front of the painting narrating the story of Revelations while the camera picks out the area of the painting that she is describing. It is a very effective way to teach a very difficult book of the Bible. She chooses common terms so that anyone watching the movie can understand the prophecy. Although it is obvious that she knows what she is talking about, she doesn't overwhelm the viewer with theory and technical divergence, she merely tells the story of Revelations. At the beginning of each section Debbie walks through the woods at her home explaining how she came to paint the story. The DVD also contains a bible study guide and leadership guide. It is an interesting and effective way to tell the story of Revelations. I think it is well worth while and would definitely recommend it.",1242000000,,1292,4.746666666666667
8224843,5,B000WPGXWW,"Filled with abstract and often retributive iconography, the book of Revelation is one of the most difficult in scripture for the average Christian to understand. Reading it through without grounding in its content or possible meanings for the figures appearing in the apostle John's vision leaves many reeling in chaotic sensory overload. Just imagine how John must have felt.

Like many others, my name can be counted amongst those for whom biblical prophecy is a terrible, wild, and confusing no-man's land. The main thrust of materials developed to delve into the prophecies concerning the commonly termed ""end-times"" tends towards forecasts, timelines, drawing parallels (imagined or real) between current events and scripture; What In the World Is Going On? is a best-selling example of this approach. Fictional interpretations speculating on how Revelation might be played out in the future such as the Left Behind series have also been met with a torrent of consumer response. In the midst of all such projections I find myself wondering... if Jesus Himself stipulated that He neither knew the day or hour when He would return, how can we hope to do better?

It was with some caution that my family sat down to view Painting Revelation: A Visual Exploration of the Last Book of the Bible from artist and teacher Debby Topliff. Upon seeing the disc's brightly painted cover my husband declared that our six-year-old could do as well, my young children protested in anticipation of a boring documentary-style film, and I braced myself for the potential onslaught of anti-Christ/Middle East/oil crisis/terrorism imagery. Forty-five minutes later we emerged from a beautifully captivating, gentle, face-value presentation of the book of Revelation, our initial impressions having been proven utterly groundless and inaccurate.

The film's creatrix, Debby Toppliff, experienced the same confusion when confronted with the book of Revelation as a young Christian receiving her Masters degree from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Illinois. Many years later she engaged in an intensive Precepts-based course of study and through charting, notes, and most importantly a pictorial timeline she drew that ordered the visual descriptions John shares from his vision, she began to make Revelation her own. It was this timeline that planted the first inkling of a large painting encompassing the visual imagery of Revelation on a single canvas. Encouraged by a friend and undaunted by her lack of professional training as an artist, she completed the task in a spirit of lighthearted love regardless of whether the final result resembled that of a seven-year-old. It is this painting - bright, bold, and yes, beautiful - that she uses to guide us through the confusing, tumultuous landscape so many of us find in the Bible's last book.

Topliff presents the book of Revelation in five interrelated segments of 7 - 12 minutes each: ""An Open Door"", ""Opening the Scroll"", ""Behind the Scenes"", ""The Open Book of Life"", and ""Open Gates."" Topliff begins each section with a personal reflection and sharing from her life; the meaning of certain passages to her personally and insight into her own Christian walk. Aided by her large 5' x 7' painting she gently guides viewers through the events of Revelation as they occur within the Bible itself, providing little commentary and without seeking to tie the narrative to current events. The letters to the seven churches are not pictorially represented nor addressed on the DVD; the focus remains upon the powerful images and symbolic events described by John.

It is difficult to express the beauty of what Topliff has created. When viewed on the whole her painting is stunning, though simple in execution. It is as though the spirit of God has anointed her work, and the glory shines through the painting, rather than drawing its aesthetic appeal through technical merit. Her verbal tour through her work is certain but never strident, both authentically honest and loving. While the reality of eternal punishment is never hidden, Topliff draws viewers into the recognition of the safety, joy, and eternal love that is found within the promise of Revelation for those who follow Jesus.

The message of Painting Revelation is one that reaches viewers no matter their age. In one chair our three-year-old was as equally captivated as her 43-year-old father. Topliff's delivery is always calm and reassuring so that even the most graphic events described in Revelation, when illustrated by simple figures with little detail, never created a sense of fear or alarm in our young ones. As easily as small viewers receive this orientation to Revelation, older individuals can dig in deep with the extensive study resources provided on the DVD-ROM for use on personal computers. These same resources are also available for download at the Painting Revelation website. With instructions for planning a study, discussion guides, worksheets, leaders guide, a visual key to the painting, and a JPEG of the entire work, adults can dig deep individually or in a small group setting. Repeated viewings will add further depth and understanding as well.

Oh, what a blessing Topliff's work will prove to be for so many. I was deeply moved by her simple, heartfelt, spirit-filled approach to the end of the story that God has written for our world. Painting Revelation will hold a treasured position in our family's home library for years to come.

Do visit the the Painting Revelation website to view a brief video trailer, see the entire painting, find additional ideas for using the DVD and more.",1240272000,3,5624,5.17931793179318

""It was helpful to hear Revelation taught from an artist's perspective - with room for metaphor, mystery, and looking at the whole instead of the parts. I have always had many questions about Revelation and tend to avoid it, but seeing it through a different lens made me much more at peace with it.""
-- Kristen Bell, MA OT, founding partner of Mars Hill

""Debby's simple style of painting is perfect to capture the various emotions of Revelation in a way that allows us to complete our own images of John's vision.

""As I viewed Painting Revelation for the first time, I immediately saw how well it would fit in with the worship music we had planned for the very next Sunday morning. So I took the DVD with me to church and shared my idea with our music director. When the computer person was able to show the exact clip I wanted, I was thrilled. The visual added so much to the meaning of Revelation 5:11-13, where all of heaven sings out, ""Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!"" Thank you for worshiping the Lord through your painting and sharing it with us through your DVD. May the Lord bless His Word as He promised.""

Painting Revelation can be used by individuals like me who truly want to better understand God's revelation into the end times or it can be used by study groups.""
-- Shelia King, Vision Video

""I have always been intrigued with Revelation, yet at the same time frightened. This straightforward approach takes away the fear and provides a view from the mountaintop as to the overall purpose and message of the book. We watched the DVD with our four children who were engaged immediately.  Introducing art into the learning process for Revelation is revolutionary!  From our oldest (11) to our youngest (6), the painting drew them into the mysteries of the book, but Debby's teaching made it simple to understand.""

Last night we showed the DVD to our Small Group and they loved it! We had planned to stop for a ""treat"" break between sessions, but they wanted to keep going. They were impressed with many things: Debby's passion for God's Word, her quiet spirit, and her sensitive ability to deliver an engaging explanation about a very difficult passage of Scripture, the complex simplicity and detail captured in the painting, and the message of the devastation, trials, beauty, and hope all wrapped up in one terrific presentation. My husband and I enjoyed it just as much last night as the first time we watched it. He had just finished reading Revelation and this DVD put images in his mind making the book come alive to him. What a gift you have given to those of us who need that visual learning tool.
-- Laura Round, executive assistant

""Revelation is perhaps the most mysterious and misunderstood book of the Bible. Artist and teacher Debby Topliff introduces and discusses this last book of the New Testament while standing in front of a large painting depicting 29 scenes from Revelation in beautifully vibrant colors. Topliff walks viewers through the painting, explaining how the various images relate to the book of Revelation as the camera pans specific images on the canvas. The artist is at ease and clearly well versed in Bible studies. Particularly pleasing are short introductions to each segment, filmed in the woods surrounding Topliff's home. This presentation helps viewers understand the Bible as seen through an artist's palette. Extras include a study guide, charts, and worksheets. For Bible study groups and personal viewing.""
-- Joan Kindig, Booklist, April 15, 2008

""Debby Topliff does a remarkable job of explaining and illustrating the Book of Revelation, putting it in the context of the whole biblical story. She does not avoid the difficult passages, but handles them with sensitivity and compassion. She keeps the viewer moving toward the grand conclusion - Jesus' victory and the renewal of all things.""
-- Dave Van Der Wiele, CRC pastor

""Revelation is such a visual and aural book that the DVD--with its focus on parts of the picture and additional sound effects as the story is retold--is very helpful. Debby Topliff's calm, steady, soothing voice helps quiet the notes of wrathful vengeance until we see hope triumphing in the end. The 6-session course fits the attention span of 21st-century adults. I hope more and more church groups will use it to help teach Revelation, a very important culmination of Holy Scripture.""
-- Judy Parr, Adult Education Chairperson, Hope Church, Holland, MI

""Debby Topliff's Painting Revelation is an astounding presentation, both the art and the message.  As stated in The New Oxford Annotated Bible, `The Revelation to John', or Apocalypse, `...is a fitting close of the Holy Scriptures, for its final chapters depict the consummation toward which the whole biblical message of redemption is focused.  It may be described as an inspired picture book...that makes a powerful appeal to the reader's imagination...' Topliff's Painting Revelation presents the consummation of the biblical message of redemption by telling the story and expressing it with her unique art, art that appeals to both adults and children.""
