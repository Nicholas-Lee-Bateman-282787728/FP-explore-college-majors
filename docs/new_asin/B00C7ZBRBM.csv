8578516,5,B00C7ZBRBM,"I saw this film on PBS.  It is one of the greatest films I have ever watched.  It will bring the ""old days"" back when we were at grandma's house and experienced a lot of the things seen in this movie.  Great film to leave for your children and grandchildren who will never experience or know about the struggles of past generations.  Please order this DVD.....you will have no regrets!  Enjoy!!!",1423353600,,395,4.507042253521127
