It seems that some of their earlier videotaped performances were much better.  I do think the audio is very good.  For Led Zeppelin completists, I recommend adding this to your collection.",1357516800,,319,4.781818181818182
5145939,2,B008AL614A,"Picture and sound quality is poor at best. Also the selection of songs is really poor.
I agee with the previous. You are better off getting a pizza and some beer......................... There is a two disc edition with a more complete set list that's hard to find. If yoy really want to see the Knebworth show, buy the DVD that came out the same time as the CDs ""How The West Was Won"". This edition was personally restored by Jimmy Page and the quality is excellent!!",1356998400,6,468,4.453488372093023
5145940,1,B008AL614A,"Don't waste your money, or time on this video. Very poor quality even as a bootleg.  The video content is washed out, and the sound quality is is beyond poor.  As a Zeppelin fan, it was drudgery siting through the entire video.  Buy a pizza and beer, it will go down better than sitting through this DVD.",1356480000,17,304,4.298245614035087

8526504,4,B008AL614A,Though this copy did not come with a case or a sleeve photo video quality is the best that I have seen.  The other copies that I have watched in the past were just one orange blob and TGIF band barely visible.  Considering the safe of the video it has the best quality and I recommend this one except for the fact that cover is not included,1408665600,,340,4.059701492537314

8526506,1,B008AL614A,I am a huge fan of Led Zeppelin but this DVD is garbage.  The video quality is terrible and the sound quality isn't much better.  DO NOT BUY!,1363478400,,141,4.0
8526507,2,B008AL614A,"I am an avid zeppelin fan, owning several DVD's.
This one is of poor video quality and even though I love zeppelin, I don't love this DVD.",1361145600,,138,4.148148148148148
8526508,1,B008AL614A,"I was hopeing for a concert video of the Zep that was something like The Song Remains the Same but what I got looks like a pirated copy of a copy of a copy of a...... You get the idea. The video itself is very grainy and washed out. There are spots where it is difficult to even tell whats on the screen.

The audio is even worse. Had the sound been better it may be a decent DVD just to listen to but sadly that is not the case. Vocals are warbly and distorted, instruments are very subdued and tinny sounding. Drum sounds remind me of hitting a trash can lid and a wooden block! I am quite sure that Mr. Bonham is spinning in his grave at the atrocious sounds coming from this DVD. I am really suprised that Mr. Page would have even let this thing go out to the public. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!

I had originally placed this review on a title not yet availible. Please accept my apologies for this error. I will be reviewing the other title when it comes out.",1359331200,3,956,4.106951871657754
8526509,3,B008AL614A,"The sound and content are okay for what is an old bootleg of a show. There are 3 camera angles here, one is good one is fair and the last one is unwatchable. Put this on a 50"" plasma and when they go to the red stage lights all you see is a blob. Maybe okay in 1979 , but not on todays TV's.",1358294400,,291,3.5625
8526510,5,B008AL614A,"Very Good, Led Zepplin concert, fun to watch and observe one of the greater performers of our time and genre",1358208000,,108,4.45
8526511,5,B008AL614A,"Best copy of this show that I've seen yet! I f you have this on boot, the quality and sound is better than anything I've seen yet! The dvd only has the first half of the show, so maybe there's the other half floating around out there. Snap this up!",1357948800,,248,3.98
