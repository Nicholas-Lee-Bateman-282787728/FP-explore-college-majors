8727830,5,B013I9RLYW,Who would have ever thought of making a program out of pie? Who else but Rick Sebak thank goodness! The people who run these little businesses and their stories are just as interesting as the delicious product they create. We're going to make a point of visiting a place or two on this program. Get out and start exploring!,1520812800,,323,4.491525423728813
8727831,5,B013I9RLYW,"My favorite type of dessert is pie, and this documentary has a load of pies from East Coast to West Coast.  I get hungry when I watch it and it makes me appreciate the varieties of pies.  I would like to have a slice of one of those mountainous apple pies as I write.  Yum!",1496275200,,273,3.9272727272727272

8727835,4,B013I9RLYW,"This is a show to make your mouth water. Many of the pie makers interviewed say some variation of its easy as pie.  As someone whos made my share of mediocre pies, I think this is pretty funny.

I actually took notes while watching A Few Good Pie Places, because theres a bunch of pie-making tips. But even if you're an expert pie maker, I bet youll enjoy watching this show.  It isn't really about recipes, its about why people love making pies and why people love buying pies. The places visited range from a woman with a roadside seasonal stand to bakers whove been in business for decades. These are pie specialists, not more general bakeries. The show runs 56 minutes without commercials.

Portage Pies (Westfield, NY) They MOUND their 2-crust apple pie and bake them for more than an hour. The insides, they say, have to boil.

Ikedas (Northern CA, Placer County) Ive been in this place. They sell 80-100,000 pies a year, all using fruit from their own 45 acre farm.

Two Fat Cats (Portland, Maine) They also specialize in Whoopie Pies  not technically a pie.

Grant Bar & Restaurant (Milliville, PA) Famed for his coconut cream, made with arrowroot thickener.

Woodruffs Store and Pie Shop (Elon, Virginia)  People really feel loved when they're eating pie. I hear it all the time.

Poorhouse Pies (Underhill, VT) Uses a brush to brush off excess flour after rolling out a pie crust. Why didn't I think of that?

A La Mode Pies (Seattle, WA) Uses Frequent Pie Buyer Cards, buy 10 slices get one free. Loyal customer, Marilyn, is on card #75. This [she points to her slice of pie] is 752!

The Pie Lady (Bartlett, NH) This roadside seller has regular customers who cant get enough.

Nicks Kitchen (Huntington, Indiana) Get one recipe for Indianas Official State Pie, the Sugar Cream Pie.

Rolling Pin Bakehouse (Roanoake, Indiana) This was very interesting. No shop, but out of her house. Order on-line and arrange pick-up outside. Home-based vendor laws vary by state.

LouLas Caf (Whitefish, MT) The huckleberry local speciality looked wonderful.

Rose (Golden Valley, MN)  Another home-based pie shop, her favorite is sweet potato pie from scratch.

Last, but not least, you visit Braham, MN, for its annual Braham Pie Day. Queens, carnival and, above all, a pie contest and then, an auction of the winners!

You can also catch the sister show about bakeries, also created by Rick Sebak. I enjoyed it:
