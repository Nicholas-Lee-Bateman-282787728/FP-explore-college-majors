945811,3,6304945795,"For beginners it is a very good tape.

When they showed the ""pressure points"" on the body and how to manipulate them, they should have done it close up so you can find the spot better.

The 'superimposed"" beach and streams scenes were nice but it would have been better to film the video ""on location"".

All in all....pretty good.",1137024000,5,330,4.466666666666667
945812,5,6304945795,"As a practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine and a 15 year student of meditation and yoga, I highly recommend this wonderful video.  The video's breathtaking nature footage and beautiful music, combined with a  well-rounded beginner's Chi Kung program will help bring peace, calm and a  sense of centeredness to the lives of many.  Dr. Arnold Tayam's  choreography cannot be surpassed and his graceful execution of this ancient  art is indeed awe-inspiring. I recommend this video to patients regularly!",922320000,7,508,5.448717948717949
7880267,5,6304945795,"This movie is terrific innocent slapstick fun for kids up to 12, or adults who remember the old Airplane-David Carradine Kong Fu TV shows and can appreciate the satire.  Don't take life so seriously, and don't take this movie so seriously. This was not a blockbuster huge Hollywood budget production - it was a labor of love for all the people involved who wanted to make this fun movie. Enjoy!",1479081600,,394,4.628571428571429

7880272,4,6304945795,"From ""FILM THREAT""

Continuing in the tradition of Airplane! and the Naked Gun series (but thankfully not starring Leslie Nielsen), Kung Phooey takes the conventions of the spoof genre a step further by also lampooning Hollywoods tradition of typecasting. The result is a surprisingly humorous mix of chop socky parody and riffs on the role of the Asian actor in cinema.

Writer/director/producer Darryl Fong has plenty of experience in that arena. His decision to make Kung Phooey can be viewed as a direct result of being cast as an Asian heavy in films like Midnight Man. After several years of encountering casting stereotypes, Fong decided that the time was ripe for a send-up of, among other things, the elderly Chinese man who always seems to be bowing and scraping, the scheming dragon lady, and the stoic martial arts master. Along the way, he also manages to skewer Citizen Kane, the Kung Fu TV series, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and a slew of Bruce Lee and Hong Kong action movies.

7880273,5,6304945795,"These Chi Kung exercises are exactly what is needed in a time of stress - no matter where the stress originates.

Carradine presents well.  He is informative, and his delivery is clear and well modulated; instructions in voice-overs are given slowly and audibly. He not only explains how exercises are done, which all good presentations strive to do, but he also explains what one should feel while doing them and of what use each is to the body.

It would be advantageous, of course, if Carradine were still with us. I, for one, would be one of the first to purchase more of his DVDs.",1379462400,,585,4.552380952380952

Especially helpful with the pain and stiffness associated with fibromyalgia.
I can do these exercises even when my regular activities become too difficult during painful flareups.
Also helpful for relaxation and promotes better sleep.",1283644800,,284,5.333333333333333
7880275,5,6304945795,"Excellent Chi Kung workout for beginners.  My girlfriend lent me her VHS tape and I thought it was great, so I bought it.  Could only find it in VHS format. I found it to be a good workout, clear and well demonstrated.  I did work up a sweat on the workout even though I didn't seem to exert much effort, so that tells me the workout did work the organs of the body.  Carradine also presents the material in a very soothing and peaceful voice and manner. Carradine uses 3 - 4 helpers, to help demonstrate the moves.  The camera person also shoots from several angles, so you can better see the moves too.  Carradine also shows you some accupressure points and how to apply pressure to them.  He even explains some basic energy flow methodology.

I incorporate a bit of Chi Kung immediately before and after each of my aerobic walks. It helps me stretch and tone.  It also refreshes the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. I also incorporate a bit of it while doing the walk, to refresh the lungs, especially in this &^%$#@ humid Baltimore weather!  Lost 59 lbs to date with just an average of 30 minutes a day of walking.

Anyway, I really think this is a great Chi Kung product.",1182988800,,1177,4.402777777777778
