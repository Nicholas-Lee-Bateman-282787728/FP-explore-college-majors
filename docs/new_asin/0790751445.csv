119413,4,0790751445,"The Plot:Two simpleminded wresling addicts(David Arquette and Scott Caan) believe they can and help thier favorite wresling(Oliver Platt) to relive his career to fight back. Fans of the World Championship Wresling might like this silly comedy, because a number of real life wrestlers appear in cameos.
DVD`s has an strong anamorphic Widescreen(1.78:1) transer and also an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. Included:An running commentary track by the cast. An good fun. Grade:B+.",971222400,,482,5.708333333333333
119414,3,0790751445,"The movie itself is a great comedy about two wrestling fans (Gordie and Sean) from Wyoming, who travel to Atlanta and New York to help out their fallen hero Jimmy ""The King"" King. The movie takes place within the WCW organization and has cameos by many of the wrestlers who were in WCW in early/mid 1999. The main plot of the movie is how these two fans help Jimmy ""The King"" get back into the ring after witnessing him getting cheated out of his title at a WCW Monday Nitro show.
This movie is a good comedy. But the plot may be a little weak if you are not a wrestling fan. I do recommend this movie to anyone who is a wrestling fan, ESPECIALLY if you are a WCW fan. The language may be a little harsh for some kids. It is not anything you haven't heard on WCW before, just a lot more of it.
My one complaint and reason for writing this is to say this DVD has almost no extras to it.  The wrestler interview (DDP and Bam-Bam) and Nitro Girl interview segments are only 20 - 50 seconds long each. You do get the Bif Naked Video and the movie trailer. And the audio commentary is good in some places. But that is it of the extras on the DVD I have.
So if you buy it for the movie, you will not be disappointed. If you buy the DVD looking for extras, you'll feel like you just got suplexed.",969753600,,1289,4.0549019607843135

119465,3,0790751445,"As World Championship Wrestling (WCW) was going bankrupt, they needed to come up with other ways of earning money, and decided to jump into the film business. Little did they know that within two years, they'd be out of business and their rival, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), would pick up their idea and turn it into a billion dollar industry. Ready To Rumble features two life long wrestling fans, intent on restoring their favorite wrestler, The King (Oliver Platt), back to his former glory. Against all odds, they inspire The King to get back in shape, and compete for one last chance at glory. It's hard to remember through all the intense action and dangerous moves, that professional wrestlers are actually actors, who need to learn a script and play a character, on a weekly basis, so why not put them in movies. It has worked out very well for WWE Films, which has produced some great films, including; The Marine, 12 Rounds, and The Call, but what about WCW's only foray into the movie business? David Arquette was the perfect choice to play this wacky wrestling freak, and he actually had great chemistry with everyone involved. The story told in Ready To Rumble may lack the vulgarity and insanity that has become associated with most modern comedies, but it was certainly something different and did have it's movements of hilarity.",1432512000,,1353,4.861471861471862

119468,5,0790751445,"A collossal and monumental picture that defines a decade, Ready To Rumble is nothing short of perfect. It dissects the very nature of the human being with surgical precision while simultaneously painting cinematography so brilliant, that our eyes begin to weep from the unbearable beauty. Not one stroke of this masterpiece is flawed, and other filmmakers are left standing in the gallery of life able to do nothing but admire. Citizen Kane, Dr. Strangelove, and The Godfather were all necessary steps to progress the medium, but we do not fully arrive at our destination until Ready To Rumble. It is rare that the climax of art can be so clearly defined, but this may very well be the closest we'll ever come to expessing our purpose on this planet. 5 stars is not enough, I wish I could give it the entire night's sky.",1431216000,,820,4.701388888888889

119479,5,0790751445,"This was a great comedy. It's perfect for wrestling fans and for fans who grew up in the 90s watching The Monday Night Wars and WCW it will bring great feelings and memories back. It stars David Arquette, Scott Caan, Oliver Platt, Rose McGowan, Bill Goldberg, Diamond Dallas Page, Sting, Joe Pantaliano,
  One of the things that makes the movie so good is the strength of it's supporting actors. McGowen is a great asset to film and I don't think anyone could have done better in the role. Joe Pantaliano is an extremely talented actor and without him the film wouldn't be as good as he was great at the bad guy role.
  The wrestlers do fine acting. Oliver Platt may not be the ideal choice to play a wrestling but he is a real good actor and played the role perfectly. Caan and Arquette are great. They have a good chemistry and it's easy to tell Arquette is a big wrestling fan because he looks like he is having a lot of fun on screen.
  I recommend this to wrestling fans and those in search of a good comedy that is light and not dramatic. Cheers and enjoy!",1420329600,,1062,4.311557788944723

If you're looking for a wrestling movie that gives a humorous and wholesome look into the sport, ""Ready to Rumble"" is ALSO NOT worth your time.  If you're a fool with no sense of humor who likes loud noises and warped perception of reality, or under 15 years old and thinks crotch-kicking jokes are the good stuff, then MAYBE WITH PROBABLE CAUSE ""Ready to Rumble"" is worth your time.  Although, I doubt any child would realize about the actualization of WCW in this day and age.

The film is dated in its material, when the whole plot revolved around the WCW and its cohorts which has been defunct a year AFTER the film's release.  When the film's about has two fanboys trying to recapture a wrestler's spotlight by him winning a championship belt, I find it to be a bittersweet victory in the long run.  The WWF (as it was called at the time) didn't even embrace the movie with its existence, but since Warner Bros. distributed the movie and its parent company owns Ted Turner which owned the WCW, it came as no surprise.  I'm not bothered so much about the forgotten material as I was for just about everything this film has to offer.

Director Brian Robbins makes it an art in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/making/dp/B000FKP3XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">making</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/films/dp/B000PATZK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">films</a>&nbsp;very irritating to watch, and has David Arquette to help.  The film's obnoxious, repulsive and inane, the bottom of dumb comedies.  A big portion of the jokes consist of toilet humor and crotch-kicking humor, something that ""Robot Chicken"" excels at but not so much here.  Main characters Gordie (Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan) don't even act like idiots; I expect genuine idiots like Beavis and Butthead or Derek Zoolander, but Gordie and Sean seem like they're pretending to idiots, which makes their jokes ultimately forced and pretentious.  Oliver Platt plays a popular wrestler turned flushed-out named Jimmy King, and I just don't see the actor as a wrestler; he sounds like a wrestler, I'll give him that.  Almost all the characters are unlikable and repulsive, some are just cruel like Gordie's cop father who shoots him and runs him over 'for laughs', and the only character I find tolerable is Martin Landau's character as a 105-year-old trainer with some spunk in him (or maybe I just can't find the heart to hate Martin Landau).

To give the film some kind of credit (which it shouldn't), it might work as a historic relic to give die-hard veteran wrestling fans something to embrace.  It has the authentic wrestlers back in the day and most of the matches were spot-on, except for the idiotic motorcycle sequence in the climatic cage match.  ""Ready to Rumble"" might work under that notion, because it sure doesn't work for anything else; to call it a ""Caddyshack"" of the wrestling sport is an insult.  It's rather sad that the film's audience is depicted in this movie, and the audience doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.",1275868800,,3348,5.149446494464945
119518,5,0790751445,"I've owned this film for several years, but recently lost the DVD during a trip and NEEDED to replace it. This movie probably didn't get nominated for any Oscars and, at first glance, wouldn't attract anyone who isn't interested in the WWF. However, I have no interest in the WWF either. I picked up this movie because of Sean Caan and David Arquette. Little did I know Oliver Platt, Joe Pantoliano and Martin Landau also had major roles.

After the first viewing, I was in love with this movie. The stars had a lot of fun with the wrestling part and a lot of silly jokes worked in, which is typical of any film with David Arquette. (I will never be able to thank David Arquette enough for his sense of humor). The movie features several real-life WWF wrestlers such as Diamond Dallas Page, Macho Man Randy Savage and Sting (the wrestler who looks like a member of Kiss, not the former singer for The Police). All have fun with the fake aspect of this so-called sport, and it makes the film worth watching.

I would recommend this film to ANY guy and those ladies who like other films from David Arquette. You will be entertained and, by the end of the film, will be rooting for the two losers (Arquette and Caan) from Lusk, Montana.

119521,4,0790751445,"READY TO RUMBLE

This one is obviously for wrestling fans only really and even then you have to have no expectations to like this one. Fortunately for me I enjoy pointless stupid fun and this my friends is one of those. This movie came out at a time when wrestling was at an all time high but the company that the film featured was starting to go into an all time low. In fact not to long after this WCW shut its doors when they sold to the WWF/E. Of course this is every wrestling fan boy's dream right here, meet your hero and help him or her on their path to redemption. In fact that is the exact plot line for this movie.

The film follows two best buds Gordie and Sean as they fantasize about their favorite sport, professional wrestling. Gordie and Sean set out one day to WCW Monday Night Nitro and could not be any happier; after all they are getting to see their favorite wrestler Jimmy King. Things turn ugly though when a plot devised by wrestling promoter Titus Sinclair and wrestler Diamond Dallas Page comes into play to dethrone the king and end his career. The boys watch as their idol 8is basically destroyed right I the middle of the ring as multiple wrestlers help to put him out of commission. From here they decide it is up to them to bring him back and get him back in the game. They learn that their idol is not all that he seemed and after disappointment finally sets in the must still come together to right the wrong, and put the king back on top while also reaching their full potential.

Now this movie was never going to win any academy awards but it is a very fun movie if you go into it with absolutely no expectations. From the zany moments involving the wrestlers to the downright corny moments with the boys this is just stupid fun. Writer Steven Brill must have went into this just wanting to have fun because this movie is truly over the top and truly entertaining. Director Brian Robbins must have had the same mind set or maybe I am just hoping that they purposely made this film this way. Either way I had a great time watching this from the moment it came out all the way to now.

Now as far as the cast goes they all basically just have fun with this one and play it over the top. David Arquette is so over the top and excellent in this as Gordie, honestly he gives one of my favorite performances on the film. His dream sequence in the beginning with ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage and the clerk is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Although I was not a big fan of him actually winning the WCW title in real life just to promote the movie, but from what wrestlers have said that worked there at the time it seems that he didn't want to do it and showed the proper respect to the actual wrestlers. Scott Caan is a little less over the top as Sean but is still just as fun as is Chris Owen, but that dude is mad funny in this. Oliver Platt as always is great in this movie as down in the dumps wrestler Jimmy King, in fact he is one of the few people who actually seem real in this movie. Rose McGowan is good in this as well as the backstabbing bimbo that tries to trick the guys, and Richard Lineback is hilarious as Gordie's dad. Joe Pantoliano is excellent as the evil promoter that screws over the King, possibly the best performance on the movie.

Of course all the wrestlers do their thing on this movie particularly DDP who plays this role real, he is playing himself of course. Also here is Randy Savage, Bam Bam Bigelow, Goldberg, Curt Henning, Sting, Gorgeous George, Juventud Guerrera, Van Hammer, Prince Iaukea, Disco Inferno, Billy Kidman, Konnan, Rey Mysterio Jr, Saturn, Booker T, Sid Vicious, as well as the Nitro girls and all the ring side commentators.

This is a fun movie even though it is way over the top and kinda stupid, but hey don't we need that some time. Go into this with no expectations and you will have fun and have a good time. If you are a wrestling fan you will like this and if you are a WCW fan you will definitely like this.

The plot here is that the current King of Wrestling (Oliver Platt) is brutally dethroned by the an Evil promoter and his henchmen Diamond Dallas Page.  From there two bumbling fans go on a quest to get Jimmy King back to the top.  Along the way they encounter variouse WCW talent as well as other interesting characters.
Easily the best moments come when either they show wrestling matches and when Marlon Brandow is on the screen.  Yes Marlon Brandow is in this and is so over the top that in my opinion steals the show.
However despite the cool wrestling moments and Marlon Brandow there really isn't much to look at here.  The only thing worse than what this movie was a majority of the time was the fact that it spun off into a real WCW storyline that really sucked and made to some fans a hated man out of David Arquette.

119547,3,0790751445,"If you're not into slapstick humor, I will definitely NOT recommend this movie to you.  A lot of the comedy in this movie came from sight gags and physical comedy.  David Arquette and Scott Caan play two wrestling fans from Wyoming who take it upon themselves to rescue their favorite wrestler, Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), from wrestling oblivion.  The situations that these two guys get themselves into in the process, including entering the STEEL CAGE OF DEATH with about ten other wrestlers and meeting Jimmy King's supposedly dead parents, provide most of the humor for the film.
This is not a ""sophisticated funny"" movie nor is it a pure ""stupid funny"" movie.  This is just a straightforward flick about two guys of less than average intelligence putting their mark on the world (of WCW wrestling).  I didn't laugh all the way through, but it was a decent comedy.  If you've been thinking you might enjoy this, but weren't sure, pick it up.  You won't be disappointed.",971222400,3,972,4.819277108433735
