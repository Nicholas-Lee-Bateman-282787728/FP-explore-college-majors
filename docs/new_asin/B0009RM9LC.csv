2313572,5,B0009RM9LC,I've been a real fan of the guitarist (and singer) Albert Lee for a long time now. The world's best! This instuctional DVD gives me all. Just buy it if you intend to learn and compare to the very best!,1167955200,,201,4.05
2313573,4,B0009RM9LC,"I just got the DVD, but it is barely different than my VHS copy. In fact, it looks like it was made from a production copy (like the one we've all purchased) and not the master. Very high contrast, tons of video noise, 'clay face' artifacts and piss poor soft image. Audio sounds as good as it did before. Sheesh. Oh well, at least I didn't have to digitize it. This video has been around since 1983. Albert is fascinating. The tab is confusing for some of the licks, which are in a non-standard tab format. Get your right hand ready, and prepare to get frustrated! 2 stars DVD, 5 stars Albert, 3 1/2 stars instructional.",1156464000,9,621,4.362068965517241
8065555,3,B0009RM9LC,The instructional book is not in tab. It's in note form. The book would be best for a good music reader.,1461542400,,104,4.0
8065556,4,B0009RM9LC,"Had it on VHS, nice to be able to upgrade.",1416182400,,42,3.3
8065557,3,B0009RM9LC,"This is mostly Albert showing off his instruments and a few of his speedy licks. There is nothing beyond that to learn from: no over-all theory or approach, not tips for practising or discovering phrasing ideas of your own, in short, kind of crummy as a lesson. If you want to learn in depth, this is not the label to choose: go to Homespun and get properly set-out lessons that will really help you understand what you are being shown and how to make it you own. That said, Albert sure has some cool tools and some hot licks.",1411430400,,526,4.3232323232323235
8065558,4,B0009RM9LC,"It's good to see some of AL's style up close, but they could do with slowing some of the licks down some more as his 'slow' is often little different to his 'normal' speed. Easily solved by ripping the soundtrack and time stretching it in software, but it would be better if the DVD came with a slow motion option, like some of the reissued Hot Licks VHS recordings. The transcriptions need updating too several of them are incorrect and it's a pain having to slow the recordings down, catch what's going on and correct the dots for future reference. I'm quite happy with the standard musical notation, but I suspect that some people would welcome tabs in the booklet too. Nonetheless, provided you are prepared to put in a bit of work, as above, it's a useful resource to have.",1403740800,,778,4.524822695035461
8065559,5,B0009RM9LC,"When I was about 15, I bought this lesson on a ""Star Licks"" cassette & booklet. I marveled at how well Albert Lee could play, and it was too advanced for me at the time. Decades later, I sought out this DVD to see if my playing had improved to the point where I could play these licks, and it has! I'm having a great time learning them! These licks are classic and still sound great today!",1362268800,,389,4.064935064935065
8065560,4,B0009RM9LC,"Alan, I always felt that TAB was a number intensive second rate substitute for music! Learn to read for Gods sake. And that's really the point. I think a lot of the poor reviews are from people who've picked a DVD above their level and are frustrated by the fact. If you've got the technique to pull off Alberts licks then you'll get a lot out of this. If not, then go and take some lessons for a few years and come back when you're ready.",1335484800,,439,4.116279069767442
8065561,1,B0009RM9LC,"Only half the examples have REAL tab.  The rest have a number-intensive second-rate substitute for tab.  This so-called educational video has other shortcomings as well.  Albert Lee is not a very good music teacher.  His ""slow"" playing is way too fast.  Combine that with the lack of REAL tab and you've got a DVD worth passing up.  You can find Albert's licks on the web for free, in accurate REAL tab.",1299369600,3,403,4.605633802816901
8065562,5,B0009RM9LC,"This is a great video but you're going to have to work at it. Let's face it, this guys work is complex so take it slow. Take it slow, TAKE IT SLOW! The tab is unusual but I've found that the 3rd or 4th time through it gets easier. Don't expect to be able to finger pick if you've never done it before. I've been finger picking for 45 years and had to switch to different fingers due to the use of a flat pick. When I was in High School I decided to put on the picks every time I picked up the guitar. It took a long time but I got very good and now, at 62, I'm doing the same thing only w/o the thumb pick. And I still have to practice with the thumb pick as I don't want to lose that skill! Good pickin on ya!",1245715200,,710,3.7086092715231787
8065563,3,B0009RM9LC,"I found this dvd fun to watch and informative if you are a fan of Trevors. But i thought this was an actual lesson based instructional dvd which it is not. Its an interview and thats about it, even the equipment talked about is out of date by todays standards.
This dvd is a one time watcher not a revisited teaching dvd.",1230508800,,321,4.193548387096774
8065564,1,B0009RM9LC,"I am an intermediate level guitarist interested primarily in blues. I wanted to learn a little more about country guitar and was especially interested in Albert Lee.  I am very disappointed with this product. The DVD is very limited and practically worthless. Lee is an amazing guitarist with lightning speed, but this does not translate to a good instructional program.  I say this with a doctorate and over 30 years of experience in education.  Lee presents his ""licks"" so quickly that they are impossible to follow. Even when he slows down to show the lick a second time, it is still very difficult to follow. He does provide an instructional booklet with all of ""the licks"", but unless you read music fairly well, this is also useless. Over half of the DVD focuses on Lee showing off his guitars and only a small part is actual instruction. However, this doesn't really matter because the instruction that he does present is almost impossible to learn from. It would have been far better if he would have slowed down and shown each part of each lick in a way that non-expert players could comprehend.",1221696000,3,1104,4.739583333333333
