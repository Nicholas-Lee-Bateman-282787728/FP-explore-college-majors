Borowczyk never gets his proper due as a filmmaker, but overall this is a gorgeous film and some of the individual shots are mesmerizing.",1494892800,,303,4.611111111111111
8023398,3,B0002849ZC,"Bracketed between a career full of beautiful, but often erotically offensive films, Walerian Borowczyk returned to his native Poland in 1975 to film Story of Sin, a faithful and relatively demure adaptation of the novel by Stefan Zeromski, which details the romantic, moral and spiritual struggles of Ewa Pobratynska, a virginal innocent whose obsession with a married lodger that moves into the family home leads her astray from the church, her family and her own dignity.

Yes, this is the same director responsible for The Beast (1975), one of the most ridiculously sexually explicit fairy tales ever filmed, and who continued pursued his obsession with genitalia into the horror genre with The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Miss Osbourne (1981).  Borowczyk apologists seem to be able to look beyond his rather grotesque fascinations, admiring the craft that lies underneath.  And The Story of Sin is one of the few feature films that support their argument.

Ewa believes she's found true love with Lukasz, who has come to Warsaw in hopes that the church will grant him a divorce.  But circumstances conspire to tear them apart, first in the form of a duel that leaves Lukasz shot through the lung.  After a long recuperation he leaves once again...but also leaves Ewa pregnant.  Ostracized and struggling to make ends meet, Ewa gives birth but kills the child in a fit of desperation and shame.

A series of men, including a wealthy Duke who fired the shot that nearly killed her beloved, gravitate around her with mixed intentions.  Still pining after her lost love, who's now in prison, Ewa agrees to almost anything to earn his freedom.  But when it comes - and their reunion is tragically thwarted once again - she succumbs to a life of sex, crime and bitter grapes.

Borowczyk is playing in the same sandbox as other ""erotic historical epics"" like Justine and Emmanuelle (a franchise to which the director would later contribute), but his approach is much more respectfully restrained.  The only exploitation occurring in Story of Sin is poor Ewa's push-pull relationship with the opposite sex.  Manipulated, manhandled, blackmailed and raped, her life is a series of bad choices and poor timing, all in pursuit of a noble cause.  There's no pleasure to be had in her fall from grace, unlike the clumsy erotic fumblings of a Jess Franco film.  Here, the body is merely a vessel for suffering until the soul can be released.

Borowczyk shoots with his usual eye for composition, layered behind an intentionally foggy gauze of Old World authenticity.  Even with a limited budget that often shows at the seams (the climactic gun battle sports plenty of awkward cuts and ""You got me!"" stage falls to avoid effects work and/or the censors), his film looks intricately detailed, down to the grimy rooms and dirty fingernails.  What Story of Sin lacks is a real connection with its main character, Ewa.  Borowczyk curiously shoots actress Grazyna Dlugolecka at angles that obscure her behind furniture, faces or floppy hats, never allowing her eyes to do any acting outside of a few key scenes.  It leaves the film with a calculating sense of cruelty with no mirror to put things into perspective.

Arrow Films have been a champion of Borowczyk's work from the very beginning, releasing several stand-alone titles and a box set that document his career from posters and shorts to internationally renowned filmmaker.  And the latest Blu-ray / DVD combo continues the trend, packaged with an impressive amount of extras to go along with the new 2K restoration from the original film negative.  An audio commentary is paired up with several interviews from the cast, filmmakers, poster artists and film critics - plus another essential video essay - that shed light on the director's particular obsessions.  But even more noteworthy are the 2K restorations of a trio of Borowczyk's early film shorts:  Once Upon a Time, Dom and The School, paired with optional audio commentaries.  Add in a collectible booklet and reversible covert art and even those on the fence about the director's work have to be impressed with the effort Arrow has made to convince them otherwise.",1492992000,6,4171,4.974063400576369
8023399,3,B0002849ZC,"Story of Sin is about a beautiful young and pious woman, Ewa (Grazyna Dlugolecka) who is thrown into chaos when her parents take in a handsome lodger. Already married, the lodger, Lukasz (Jerzy Zellik), is in the process of seeking a divorce, which is difficult because he is a Catholic. A relationship begins between Lukasz and Ewa, but Ewa is devastated when he leaves. She leaves her job and family to search for him. Eventually, they are reunited but separated by a series of dramatic events. On her travels, Ewa turns to prostitution and crime as she encounters several predatory men  admirers, criminals, and do-gooders  who take advantage of her.

Set at the turn of the 20th century, Story of Sin has a period setting complete with appropriate costumes and manners. The initial meeting of Lukas and Ewa, for instance, is depicted with formality. Yet, in later scenes, Lukas is groping Ewa in a public park and she is reading his love letters while lying in bed stark naked. Director Walerian Borowczyk incorporates a sexual threat in most of his scenes, ranging from a lascivious artist (another lodger) to a man who propositions Ewa in a village tavern. The men who lust after her do so because they regard her, like all women, as prey they can use for their pleasure. Even Ewas father is shown to be lascivious.

Director Borowczyk uses the music of Mendelssohn and Pachelbel to set the mood. At 130 minutes, the movie could use some judicious editing. The erotic sensibility is maintained throughout and theres a sense that we are voyeurs of Ewas forbidden, very personal sexual awakening.

Bonus materials on the  2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a new interview featurette on Borowczyks innovative use of classical music in his films; new interview featurette on the directors career in Poland; new interview with actor Grazyna Dlugolecka; reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork; and an illustrated collectors booklet containing new and archival writing and an interview with the producer of Story of Sin. The film is in Polish, with English subtitles.",1490745600,6,2099,5.034582132564841

8023401,4,B0002849ZC,"Normally I really hate it when a piece of great 'classical' music is used on a film soundtrack, and for a whole lot of reasons. Herzog and John Boorman have ruined most of their films for this reason. Think of 'Nosferatu' and 'Excalibur'. If you don't know the music you are lucky and it might not be so bad but even then, if you are good with music, you should notice there is something wrong.
This film, however, manages to pull it off triumphantly. No other piece of specially written music could have worked so well as Mendelsohn's Violin Concerto does. The result is one of the most unforgettable, beautiful, lyrical sex scenes I have ever seen. It explodes onto the screen in sound and images that are as near to ecstatic as seems possible. It even provides a valuable insight into the concerto. The violin is well enough recorded for the time , so full and strong, that it is possible to internalise it in a surprising way. And it is perhaps surprising in itself that the violin can so well represent sexual ecstasy - but high frequency sound is something this scene shares in common with the justly famous airoplane sex scene in 'Emmanuelle 1'.
When I say 'beautiful' and 'lyrical' don't imagine that it is not essentially and strongly erotic because that of course is the whole point. There are plenty of Hollywood sex scenes trying to be lyrical and beautiful but they miss the mark and end up with something that is just kitsch and sexually dishonest. And that sort of thing is so common because it is so easy to do. A scene like this needs to be disturbing and surprising in some way for it to be of real value. See my reviews of comparable scenes in other films such as 'The Postman Always Rings Twice'.
And again, lyrical it may be but smooth and polished this scene is not. It is filmed with unstable hand held camera (this is an early 70's film before steadycam) and the effect of lyricism is produced by the beauty of the girl's body itself and its movement, and of course the intense lyricism of the violin. The camerawork itself has all the fumbling, jerky quality that passionate first-time sex has so often in real life.

The story is based on a classic Polish realist novel about a girl from a respectable family fallen on hard times who falls in love with a lodger and has a baby by him and without him being aware of what has happened as a result of having moved to another city. She has the baby suddenly and alone and disposes of it straight away. This is the 'sin' which sends her on a downward spiral into the criminal underworld in a typical late 19thc manner. The film has a convincing realist look throughout despite or perhaps because of various references to contemporary schools of painting. As always Boro likes to observe the texture and surfaces of things like such painters.
But what is in the end important about the film is the element of transcendance that is occasionally present through the music I have mentioned or through the beauty of some of the visual images and the girl herself.",1351036800,17,3029,4.5273722627737225
