2179204,5,B00069A5DW,"I bought this for my grandchildren for Xmas and have not seen it, but I have no doubt about Winnie movies, and my grandchildren were VERY happy to get it.  That's all I can say for now and would go ahead and give a positive review.  I won't get any REAL opinions from them until later after they've watched it, but I'm not worried, and I got this and other DVD's I ordered EXTREMELY promptly! My grandchildren (and their parents and ME love Winnie), and I am ABSOLUTELY HAPPY with Amazon!",1167868800,,488,4.351648351648351
2179205,5,B00069A5DW,This is such a  great video of winnie the pooh it keeps my child watching this over and over again. There always are great things my child learns when she watches winnie the pooh. She loves every minute of this.,1149638400,14,211,4.275
2179206,5,B00069A5DW,I love being able to watch the cartoons I grew up with with my kids. I love Winnie the Pooh and I wish they would put more episodes out on DVD. I do enjoy the ones on this DVD and can't wait to purchase more.,1369353600,3,208,3.6444444444444444

2179208,5,B00069A5DW,"I was looking for Winnie the Pooh that my kids enjoyed, but they haven't been made into DVD.  This was an ok substitute for my 3 year old granddaughter, but not quite what I hoped for.  Good entertainment.",1356307200,,205,4.368421052631579
2179209,5,B00069A5DW,Another great Pooh movie.  I so enjoyed the books with my older children when they were small and now the movies bring them to life.  They are so well done and have such a great story and lesson in each one.  My 2 year old grandson loves them.  I can sit down and watch with him and never get tired of these movies.  I truly believe it makes kids want to get off the couch and go outside to discover the big world waiting for them and the friends of various sizes and colors waiting for them.,1325980800,,492,4.030927835051546
2179210,5,B00069A5DW,"My son loves this video!  I'm so happy that I bought it.  The only part we don't like is the dream sequence but I usually skip over it.  Other than that, great movie with lots of fun songs.",1297987200,,189,3.9210526315789473
2179211,3,B00069A5DW,I think I was surprised by how old and really non-educational this is.  I'm not gettig any other from this series.,1282608000,,114,4.428571428571429
2179212,5,B00069A5DW,"My son loves everything winnie the pooh.  This series is no exception.
 This particular series used to be called the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh when I was a child.  They repackages and renamed it with the DVD releases.  In my opinion one of the best episodes of the series ""All's well that ends well"" is on this dvd.
I just wish Disney would release more of the growing up with winnie the pooh episodes.  Where's ""the wishing bear""?  or ""The piglet who would be king""  I hope they release some more episodes soon!",1275523200,4,520,4.410526315789474
2179213,5,B00069A5DW,"This collection of Winnie the pooh episodes are from the 80's tv show, ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" I love this dvd because I remember the shows and my two year old boys love it two. They love pooh and tigger, plus it is not boring, so that it keeps their attention. It is a great dvd and I recommend the whole collection.",1217894400,8,333,4.138461538461539

2179215,2,B00069A5DW,"After reading the reviews,  we thought this would be a great way to introduce our son to Winnie the Pooh. Big mistake. This DVD scared my child to tears.  It is scary, confusing and hard for him to comprehend all the chaos going on.  I was actually surprised that I also found this DVD too much for a toddler to handle.  This, and the other Pooh DVD we purchased, will be going away for a couple of years.",1205020800,7,405,4.153846153846154
