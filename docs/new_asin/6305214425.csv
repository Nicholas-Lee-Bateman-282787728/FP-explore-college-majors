7886702,4,6305214425,Forgot I used these DVDs back in the day,1459296000,,40,3.5555555555555554
7886703,3,6305214425,"The video was more like a science lesson rather than telling You what foods to eat, but still it was informative.",1457913600,,113,4.428571428571429
7886704,4,6305214425,Great video for a basic nutrition class or refresher course. I used this for a nursing in-service to refresh staff on portion sizes and calorie counting. We actually got so much more out of this video that we anticipated.,1433894400,,221,4.6923076923076925
7886705,3,6305214425,Needed the format. I lost my other one and so I am glad I could find another one.  The information is very good.,1357689600,,112,3.869565217391304
7886706,5,6305214425,"I bought this video for a distance undergraduate nutrition class. It's a great educational tool, but it was filmed many years ago and it's a little dated - the people, not the information, although there's always new info in nutrition, so some of the info is a little dated too I suppose.

It does name complex info and make it really simple to understand and I'd recommend this for any nutrition student or anyone who wants to learn more about nutrition.

It's easy to watch and great to watch as an overview before you get into the complexities of the textbook. It also provides some great mnemonics to help remember certain concepts.",1327795200,,636,4.669642857142857
7886707,1,6305214425,They try to cover too much and don't go into each important topic as they should. They talk way TOO fast and I was VERY disappointed with it. NOT WORTH BUYING!!!,1314403200,,161,4.225806451612903
7886708,5,6305214425,"I purchased this to supplement my homeschool high school and middle school curriculum. This is an excellent product, both for studying nutrition and for studying biology. Their explanation of the molecules of life, followed by tons of great and detailed information, presented in an easy to assimilate format, makes this an extremely valuable asset. If you, or your student, desire to understand proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, this is the tool to buy! I've taught science in nearly every type of school setting for over 20 years and wish I'd found this sooner. I find the Standard Deviants videos very useful and appreciate them all, but this one stands out as a best buy.",1302307200,,693,5.034782608695652
7886709,3,6305214425,"This video presents a comprehensive overview of nutrition topics that would be presented in a high school course on nutrition. The style of video is designed to appeal to the high school student, but the information presented is solid enough for adult audiences.

I enjoyed the video and learned a lot, especially about the basic science behind digestion.",1251763200,5,355,5.120689655172414
7886710,5,6305214425,"After watching this tape a few times, I decided not to enroll in a college nutrition class.  I can't imagine any class being as informative and entertaining as this tape is.  If I needed to take a course in nutrition, this tape would certainly be a valuable asset to review for tests.",987206400,25,284,4.4423076923076925
