8390554,3,B0037EDIHI,"This was a gift for my daughter. Her rating was as follows: The episodes were only OK, however nothing to rave about. They were not very exciting and seemed to drag on, at times they were boring.",1359763200,,195,4.297297297297297

Not to say that this sampler is not great, but it's just that the whole set is a better bargain. However, maybe I should note that the picture quality on the full set is not the best, and appear to be quite compressed, so perhaps the picture is better on this sampler? Probably not, since both sets are from the same company. At any rate, ""The Ray Bradbury Theater"" was a great TV series that ran from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, and the scripts were by Ray himself, so the writing quality of the show was great! Most or all of the scripts were based on Ray's short stories spanning his entire career, and of various genres.

I just saw in the newspaper today that Ray Bradbury has died. He was one of my favorite people. Maybe it's time to name a mountain or some other feature on Mars after him?",1339027200,3,1137,5.145945945945946
8390556,5,B0037EDIHI,I got this in a bargain bin for $5 and am very very pleased. 16 episodes chalked full of stars....great collection and good transfer quality. If you only want a sampling of the show....this is your set....if you are looking for every episode....there are others out there.,1300579200,8,272,4.808510638297872
