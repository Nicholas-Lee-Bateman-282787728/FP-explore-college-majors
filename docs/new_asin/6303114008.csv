575663,5,6303114008,"The Little Rascals Volume II has been a big hit with my grandchildren, ages 8,6, and 4! It is so much fun to hear them laugh and smile at the antics of the Little Rascals. They particularly like the first story ""Aladdin and the Magic Lamp"" that involves a monkey. I remember watching these when I was little, my boys did when they were small, and the delight still continues. It was great to find this Volume for sale! In addition, I see a benefit for little ones today to see a slice of life back in the 40-50's. And in the midst of the comedy and silliness there are lessons within the Little Rascals adventures.",1357603200,2,614,4.301724137931035
575664,4,6303114008,"Good to see the *Kids* again, though embarrassed for the including of The Wild-man Of Borneo......a bit too much.  It was funny as a kid, but I did not know any better!  All else was great, and cleaned imagery was good too!",1356220800,,223,4.285714285714286

So, I decided to buy the inexpensive individual sets from vivendi entertainment. They are EXELLENT. The quality is what all Rascals movies deserve to be, and worth a lot more than the $4.00 I paid for it. What a steal!
I would highly reccomend these inexpensive, great quality sets to any Little Rascals fan. They are a better deal than the boxed set.",1312156800,21,674,6.9411764705882355
575666,5,6303114008,"The saga of ""Miss Crabtree"" is related on this tape.  It was one of the series' high points, with talented Jackie Cooper marvelous in his performance as the mischevioua schoolboy.  A few of these shorts are classics...and the Cooper ones are easily some of the best.",1284249600,,266,4.760869565217392
575667,5,6303114008,"This video starts out with a brief synopsis and commentary on each of the shorts by film historian Leonard Maltin. Kids might want to fast forward this section, but it is useful for anyone who wants to know the history of the shorts.

The tape starts out with ""Readin' and Writin',"" a film revolving around gang member Breezy Brisbane. It is the first day of school, but Breezy doesn't want to go. His mother wants him to grow up and become president, but that sounds boring to him. He's rather become a streetcar conductor. He goes to a blacksmith to dawdle before school, and the blacksmith tells him that he SHOULD want to be president. Then he tells him about a kid who got expelled from school who pulled all sort of pranks. Breezy decides to do the same so he can go fishing instead of going to school. He brings a donkey into the classroom, glues the teacher's books together, puts tacks on all of the seats, tells new students Wheezer, Stymie, and Dorothy to say silly things to the teacher, and puts a motor horn into the trash can and blows it whenever the teacher tries to talk. Teacher Miss Crabtree finds out that it was Breezy and expels him, unless he will recite a brown-nosing poem that another student's mother wrote for her son to say to the teacher. Breezy gets bored of being alone with no one to play with, so he returns to the school in tears, ready to humiliate himself. This short is just as funny as if one was in the classroom witnessing all of these pranks him or herself. It's a great short.

Next up is ""The Kid From Borneo,"" one of the most popular shorts from the series. It features Dickie Moore, Spanky, and Dorothy de Borba as the children from a feuding family. Their mother's brother is in town, but their father doesn't want her to see him since he is the black sheep of the family. The kids take this news literally and assume that the wild man that their uncle George is road showing is really their uncle George. The wild man happens to love candy; he calls it ""yum yum, eat em up!"" When Dickie and the gang go to visit George, the wild man sees some candy that Stymie has, making him chase them for some with the kids thinking he wants to eat them! The fun goes to Spanky's house, where most of the gang hides upstairs while tiny Spanky entertains the wild man in the kitchen, feeding him the entire icebox. The short is nothing short of hilarious, and if often regarded as the funniest of the series.

""Sprucin' Up"" is one of the later shorts featuring Spanky and Alfalfa. The scene opens with a montage of the gang, each of them finding ways to get out of grooming themselves in various ways. When a pretty new girl moves into town, the kids rush home to look their best for her. Spanky and Alfalfa turn out to be the only two who can infiltrate the house to see the girl, who amuses herself by pitting the two against each other for her affection. Immense charming ensues, and the two boys are left alone competing while the girl goes off to the circus with her rich friend Percy. The short is decent and typical of the later Hal Roach MGM shorts.

""Pay As You Exit"" finishes this collection well with the later gang putting on the tragic show Romeo and Juliet. Alfalfa plays Romeo and as you might expect, Darla plays Juliet. That is, until Alfalfa eats onions and Darla deems him unfit to play against. The kids are at a loss for what to do; the audience hasn't yet paid to see the show since Alfalfa promised that they only pay if they like the show. Buckwheat saves the day and steps in as Juliet with a blonde wig. He is adorable in the role, calling Romeo ""Homeo"" and playing to his audience with an excited fervor. However, the show still manages to go awry with chickens interfering, the balcony coming apart from the set, and Alfalfa falling through the curtain on a ladder. This a short filled with things going wrong with tons of humor and will not disappoint.",1128124800,5,3916,4.389807162534435

575805,5,6303114008,A quality collection. Original title cards and credits and 'as-clean-a-copy-as-I-imagine-exists'. Can't speak to edits as I've seen these in so many guises that I don't know what the 'original' uncut version was like. Long out of circulation shorts now included as part of the canon. These were brilliant works with natural talents everywhere. Robert McGowan's direction was Altman-like in its natural simplicity mixed with irony. Can't wait to purchase the remaining volumes in the set.,1363996800,,487,5.506666666666667
575806,5,6303114008,"A bit of nostalgia, was great seeing the Rascals after many years. DVD was excellent quality both in sound and picture-came really fast",1360195200,,135,4.913043478260869
575807,3,6303114008,"Of course, the content is amazing.  No one since has gotten performances out of kids like you'll find on these shorts. Word of warning, they're racist as hell... well as racist as people were in the 20s and 30s, which is... very. Also, until later years, these didn't have much of a plot or story.  Mostly some cute kids getting forced into weird situations and filmed with a few slapstick moments.

The quality on the other hand... not so good.  Audio is sometimes very hard to understand, and I'm not just talking about Buckwheat.  Someone said these were taken from the Cabin Fever restorations... that is a lie.  I have a few of those on VHS and they're another world of quality.  Sadly, they're gone and hard to find.  So if you're looking to get the Our Gang comedies for a decent price, I guess this series is pretty good, but it's no ""Cabin Fever"" for cheap.",1357862400,,866,4.471337579617835

7839381,5,6303114008,"NEWS FLASH for frustrated collectors of this series: While the discs of the 2008 set, which follows the same contents list as these separate discs, did not live up to the 'complete', 'uncut', 'from original masters' claims on the box at that time, it seems that once remastered c. 2011 to better fulfill the promise, each disc was issued separately (as here). Collectors assumed that the boxed set continued to supply the inferior 2008 discs, and that one had to purchase the 2011 discs separately to get the upgrade.

What is less well known, and which I discovered the 'expensive' way, is that these 2011-remastered discs are identical to those being used in current printings of the box set as well. I bought the set (with inferior transfers, many not from masters) in 2008, years later buying these much improved separates, then in the last few months, I bought the box set again. The discs of the set (whose box markings still carry the c. 2008 date - but whose box has dropped the 'from the original masters', 'remastered', 'restored' and 'uncut' claims form the front), all say c. 2011, have the MGM intros where the 2008 set had Blackhawk films intros, etc., and are identical to the 2011 separate disc issues. Though the newer boxes have dropped some of the claim blurbs which were on the original boxes, it remains unclear if they were dropped prior to 2011 during the controversy generated by disappointed fans, or if they were dropped at the same time the upgraded discs were being used. As this remains a mystery, it is still going to be uncertain whether a particular sealed box set will have the 2008 discs or the upgraded 2011 discs, so I would go with purchasing an open set after inquiring with the dealer first.

Good luck!",1464220800,,1742,4.689542483660131
