3513036,4,B001CIOCNK,"Awhile ago, I watched an independent movie called ""Shortbus"", a sexually graphic movie concerning everything to do with sex from orgasms to homosexuality to threesomes and practically everything in between, sometimes all 3 at the same time. While I appreciated the intent of showing sex in a more straightforward (albeit rather ludicrous) manner, it fell flat thanks to really boring characters and not really finding any meaning in anything it did. This film is not as graphic as ""Shortbus"" but it does take on a few more realistic endeavors, not all of them successful but it certainly tries to do more than just parade naked bodies around.

The film follows 5 vignettes: the couple (Josh Dean, Kristin Booth) who are getting to be in a bit of a predictable sex life, the exes (Sonja Bennett and Josh Cooke) who might have feelings for the other still after the breakup, the first date (Callum Blue, Diora Baird) who wonder if sex on the first date is really something they should consider considering his frequent ""women from work"" bedding habits, the long-time friends (Aaron Abrams, Carly Pope) who have long dated the wrong people and try to look beyond the weirdness of doing anything sexual with a childhood friend and the roommates (Ennis Esmer, Natalie Lisinka, Peter Oldring) where the former 2 who are dating want their roommate to have sex with her while the boyfriend watches).

Each vignette looks at sex in a more specific manner from the kinky to the emotional to the staleness of a sex life without spark and they tend to work though sometimes it's more for the intent than the actual scenes. The roommate ones for example are frequently annoying and the ones where I actually groaned at seeing simply because the boyfriend is well, the kind of guy who thinks he's funny when everyone's like ""shut the **** up, seriously"". The first date one feels a little off with both sides obviously wanting a good time though it briefly shows signs of sincerity that one is getting tired of just one night stand one after the other but that gets jettisoned in the next scene.

The best for me personally is the exes one since it really seems to hit an emotional core, actors have good chemistry and above all, is the one vignette where I actually want to see more of. The couple one is probably the more outrageous when we see the girlfriend's plan though it's actually one of the more hilarious ones and the friend's one has the right idea, the part about the weirdness between friends didn't come completely around but it's a funny one anyway. The actors are fine for their parts but of course they don't feel as fully developed and aside from the exes story, none ever have much resonating power other than the amount of sexy time they have.

It's worth a watch and whether or not you'll relate to a certain one, it's certainly an entertaining watch anyway and it isn't as graphically sexual as Shortbus nor as vapid and aimless and has something to say for once. Might not be that clear but it certainly puts in an effort.",1237075200,3,3032,4.6722846441947565
3513037,5,B001CIOCNK,"This DVD tells it how it is. Watching the DVD made me realize that all the predicaments they were in, I have been in those situations before. This movie is awesome.",1234483200,2,164,4.32258064516129
3513038,4,B001CIOCNK,"I thought this movie was very funny but I do believe that, to find it funny, you have to relate to one of the stories being told.  The movie itself is not life-changing or anything, it's just plain fun.

The acting could be better, like one reviewer before me stated, but I think it's enough to pull it off.  To me, the least believable situation came from the married couple, and the most enjoyable one was the best friends couple.

Like I said before, it's a fun movie that will at least make you smile and think about ""that one time..."", give it a shot.",1233619200,2,556,4.266666666666667
3513039,4,B001CIOCNK,"I recently watched a film from Chile called ""En La Cama"" (""In the Bed"" or ""In the Bedroom""), which was essentially a record of a sexual encounter between a young man and woman.  The film chronicled ""the act"", along with all the lead-up and post-act banter.  Sexy and sometimes poignant, it was an interesting experiment.  The Canadian-produced ""Y.P.F."" (the film's true title, ""Young People F**king"" appears on the DVD) is just like that, only we cut between five different couples in different parts of town (the couples don't know each other) before, during, and after a romp in the hay, exploring their various desires, motivations, and baggage regarding sex.  Oh, one couple isn't exactly a couple, but three people.

Anyway, like ""En La Cama"", the result here is sexy, occasionally serious, and worth a look.  ""Y.P.F."" probably does a better job than the earlier film, however, in touching on common issues that couples might want to talk about further once the film is over.

Recommended for those with an occasional taste for edgy fringe cinema with an erotic bent.",1233273600,21,1072,4.955307262569832
3513040,5,B001CIOCNK,"This was such a great movie.  So funny, and so honest.  It has the funniest line I've ever heard in any movie.  Ever.  Everyone I've shown this movie to has loved it.  Buy it now!",1231804800,,179,4.0
3513041,5,B001CIOCNK,"I imported this movie from canada on blu-ray about 2 months ago...first off it looks great on blu-ray. The movie is about 5 couples and there experiences of one night of sex. the 5 couples...long time best friends, the ex-married, first date, married 6 years and roommates one w/ girl friend. So if you have ever been in these situations you will have plenty to laugh about.",1229126400,2,374,4.597014925373134
3513042,1,B001CIOCNK,"There are very few funny scenes. The acting does not look ""real"". Overall, it's boring. The funniest thing is the cover of the DVD!",1228608000,,131,4.5
3513043,5,B001CIOCNK,"i came across this film on imdb through sarah polley oddly enough (she got a thanks for it) so decided to watch it and i'd have to say it was pretty good. the title suggests that there will be a lot of sex, and while that's true in theory, it's not so much about the sex as it is the relationship between the couples. it actually skipped over the sex at points to move from one couple to the next. it was more about the relationships.

the movie followed 5 couples through one sexual experience. the couples were named according to status 'the couple', 'the friends', etc. and the movie was cut up into the stages a couple goes through when they have sex. in each part we'd get to see how the stereotypical type of couple would react to each other in that stage of the process. all of the couples go about it differently and they have problems... it's very 'real'. i was kind of surprised watching it because in a lot of movies the sex scene is always smooth and.. well, sexy, but in this movie the couples talked to each other a lot throughout the whole movie. there was a lot of doubt on both sides and for every situation there was at least one point where you thought it wasn't going to happen. they made mistakes, or it was weird and they had to fix it. basically it was a movie about the social aspect of sex. it wasn't as contrived as the big hollywood, action movie, sex scene. it was a story about how different people who love each other in different ways wanted to get together, and how they did. but as i say, there wasn't any more nudity in it than you'd find in a contemporary teen comedy, and it has a substantial story line that's actually trying to say something about the romantic life of sex.

it was funny and it was romantic. i'd definitely recommend it to anyone age appropriate. most of the movies coming out today with sex scenes idealize and stereotype sex, but don't actually go beyond the physical. because of this it could be said that sex in the media is poorly represented and is cheapened by either the desire to draw people to a movie as a selling point, or to keep the story line going because the plot is sorely lacking in anything worth telling a story about. this movie takes apart the sex we see on tv and goes beyond the physical, makes it relatable to real life, actually has something decent to say.",1224201600,59,2339,4.3136363636363635
3513044,3,B001CIOCNK,"A quirky little comedy about one sexual encounter for five couples.

3513101,5,B001CIOCNK,Y.P.F. is a very funny movie. What they reveal of these odd couples sex lives can be very real to some and if these aren't things that you have already thought of then you're mind will be running wild with ideas afterwards.,1366156800,,223,4.333333333333333

3513115,4,B001CIOCNK,"This is a very funny movie about young people and relationships.  There are four different couples (one of them actually a treesome) who have some pretty complicated sexual relationships with each other.  Each relationship is looked at from a different stage between its protagonists.  This movie is not for the prudes.  For the open minded, it is a really funny, ""no strings attached"" sort of movie.",1330819200,,400,5.015151515151516

3513117,5,B001CIOCNK,"When i first saw the title, I thought it would be one of those stupid teen, drugs and sex movies, but its not. Yes, there is sex, but its not pointless, it actually helps continue the story with each ""pair/couple"" Some laugh out loud moments and it has Carly Pope. Very nice little movie",1298419200,2,287,4.333333333333333
3513118,4,B001CIOCNK,"Of course the first time I saw this, I did not know what Y.P.F. meant, but I do now. The cover is deceiving as it looks like a follow-up of American Pie or something, but there is surprisingly a lot more complicated than that. It was very close to life and probably more cute than funny. There is about four storylines and nine major players in this movie. One dealing with a spicing up a boring relationship, another dealing with fulfilling a fantasy, one dealing with the ins and outs of being broken up, while the final one is about best friends. As I wrote before, this is more close to life than a funny no-brainer comedy, but I would recommend seeing it once; You could probably even watch this movie on a second date and not get in trouble.",1278720000,2,747,4.3428571428571425

3513120,5,B001CIOCNK,"This movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than a glimpse of ""the game"" that so many young people take part in, all for the sake of sex and/or not being alone.

It's an excellent watch, and shows some of the intricacies of ""the game"" as well as potential situations that can happen when you mix fire and ice, so to speak.

Not for kids!",1268956800,3,341,4.230769230769231
3513121,3,B001CIOCNK,"It's a good movie, but it's not as exciting as advertised. It doesn't push any buttons, and it's not really sexy. It does have cool stories, but none of it feels edgy, or memorable. Too bad because I was really hyped about that movie until I watched it on Netflix. Save yourself the time, and watch Strictly Sex instead, unless you really have time to spare. In that case, make sure you watch Strictly Sex after you watch this.
There's nothing unrated about it.",1255392000,,461,4.5
3513122,4,B001CIOCNK,"Having one of the most jarring titles ever, YPF is a clever, often hilarious examination of young adult relationships.  If only we older slugs could have as much fun.  The film is a series of intertwined vignettes featuring various couples in various stages of--""development"":  an established couple in somewhat of a rut; two exes coming together for a one night fling; an awkward first date; two platonic friends looking to cross the line into intimacy; and a boyfriend willing to share his girlfriend with his roommate.  All the situations are well done and skillfully acted, although the roommate segment grew a bit lame (yet a pudgy Ennis Esmer was fun to watch as the overbearing, somewhat neurotic, boyfriend).

Writers Aaron Abrams and Martin Gero (who also directs) deliver a witty, fast-paced story that flows smoothly and believably.  Much of it is very, very funny, yet each of the various segments wrap up in a touching, poignant manner.  I especially liked Abrams himself and a stunning Carly Pope playing the two buds who decide--because their own love lives are going nowhere--to throw caution to the wind and have casual sex; the chemistry and comedic timing between the two--as they realize their feelings for each other are anything but casual--are excellent.  There is no graphic sex, all scenes are tastefully and discreetly done so that the viewer fully understands what's going on, so don't be afraid YPF is too high voltage to watch.  It's about young people, young people. . .you know. . .interacting.  And now I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel:  OPF.
