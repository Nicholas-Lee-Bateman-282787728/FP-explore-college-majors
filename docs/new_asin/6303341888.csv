628182,2,6303341888,"You wouldn't think, given how offensively awful the first film was, that anyone would bother with a sequel. You, however, are not Roger Corman. He along with Director Louis Morneau have surprisingly managed to pull off a fairly decent follow-up.
  It benefits from tighter pacing, an entertaining story that borrows heavily from ""Aliens"", and slightly improved special effects. Even without the generously gory carnage the movie offers, I would still recommend it for the fun back and forth between actors John Savage and Cliff DeYoung. Their dialogue, alone, is nothing short of priceless and adds to the reason why I've given this movie an additional star.
  All in all, a pleasant surprise.",988329600,,693,5.160714285714286
628183,5,6303341888,"First of all, the carnosaur movies are not bad. I am a major dinosaur lover and love dinosaur movies,games,etc. The first movie was very gory and it was mostly at nighttimemaking it scary and perfect for a dino ambush. but they could have worked a little more on the dinosaurs. Well thr t-rex was scary but the velociraptor looked kind of rubbery. Carnosaur 2 was better and more scarier than the first and much easier to comprehend there was more than one raptor and they looked better. Carnosaur was like Jurassic Park and Aliens mixed together. The battle with the t-rex was the same as the first Carnosaur, you know the tractor battle except in the second one the t-rex was pushed down a hole w/ deep wounds. The third one was the best one according to me. The vision of the raptors was cool. The first Carnosaur the raptor saw victims in green kind of like night vision goggles. In the 2nd ont the dinos saw in normal vision just like us. When the tranquilized raptor's tail grew rapidly, that freaked me out and the ending was cool. These are great movies and if you love dinosaur movies, I would recommend these.",985478400,,1119,4.517241379310345

628185,4,6303341888,"This movie was MUCH MUCH better than the original Carnosaur.  Although the plot is a rip on James Cameron's ALIENS.  (Problems at a government facility, one kid survives, an elite team sent in to investigate, characters picked off here and there by scary creatures, and a must-escape-from-a-building-about-to-be-turned-into-nuclear-dust scene.)  The effects kinda suck, but the dinosaurs looked very scary.  The tyrannosaurus head model at the end is pretty real, but when the camera switches to a shot of a small scale modle of the rex battleing a fork lift...just doesn't work.  But, it's a very good B-grade movie.",975110400,,617,5.319587628865979
628186,5,6303341888,"The best movie ever made is a magical little film known as Carnosaur.  This sequel is a credit to that name.  It is very unoriginal (the plot is a huge rip-off of Aliens) but it is enormously entertaining.  It has  interesting characters, good acting, good (and fun) special effects, and a  script that works.  The best thing about this film though is the setting.  The uranium mine where this film takes place feels genuinely prehistoric.  You can actually picture dinosaurs roaming about the mine quite naturaly.  It seems like the perfect home for the modern dinosaur.  The mine is also  delightfuly creepy.  Anyway, the bottom line is that Carnosaur 2 is the  second best movie of all time and it must be seen by EVERYONE!",961459200,3,726,4.712

628415,3,6303341888,"For those of you who loved ""Jurassic Park"" but wished that Spielberg had been a little more ballsy and aimed for a more adult audience, ""Carnosaur"" is your movie.  Made in the wake of the aforementioned blockbuster, the ""Carnosaur"" series takes the same basic premise -- genetically engineered dinosaurs on a rampage -- but goes for guts, gore, and horror.

On the one hand, it's a basic monster on the loose b-movie -- heck, it's a Roger Corman movie.  Low budget, with decent effects, simple plot, and so-so acting.  Cheesy humor -- mainly for adults.  But the whole point is not to make an Oscar worthy movie -- it's all about the dinos and the gore.  Regarding the dinos, if you compare the dino effects to ""Jurassic Park,""  you'll be very disappointed... you might even find them laughable.  Mostly stop motion, puppets (I think) or full mock-ups -- no CGI dinos here.  Do they look realistic?  Not really.

But if you love gore and love horror, and you think that low budget, 80s-type effects are cool, you'll love this movie.  The dinos are blood-thirsty and unlike the aforementioned Speilberg movies, you see everything... dinos dismembering people, dinos chomping on limbs, dinos ripping people apart, blood everywhere.

""Carnosaur 2"" is even better in that it ups the excitement factor.

With this double-sided disc set, you get the best of the series.  ""Carnosaur 3"" was a BOMB -- if you miss it, you'll be missing nothing.  This set collects 1 & 2 and you get the best.  If you don't have a strong stomach or dislike gore, avoid these and stick to Spielberg.  Kudos to Roger Corman -- these are some of his better movies.  Are they great?  Depends on what you like.",1296864000,5,1678,4.701030927835052

628417,1,6303341888,"As i stated in the title this film is terrible not that its a cheap nockoff of the great scifi film aliens which is definatly a minus in anyones book, but also the fact that it features the singal most disturbling scene i have ever witnessed in a film and it has cause serious problems for me in my life. Im refering to the horrible scene where the female lead is torn form the elevator and has her arm brutally torn of with blood shooting everywhere and then is disembowled spewing guts everywhere and the camera shows every second of this would be snuff-film scene to top this off i was only 7 when i saw it and it was on thanksgiving so naturally my appetite was lost that day as a result, and everytime i closed my eyes the scene keep playing itself back giving me a vomiting sensation its taken many years to finally remove this scene from my subconsience and have a decent nights sleep but my heart really goes out to Arabella Holzbog who had to endure this horrible scene and has probably had mental damage form it to so please do not ever watch this film its absoulte trash and distgusting watch jurassic park instead",1152835200,2,1125,4.3619047619047615

628419,1,6303341888,"I am downright proud to announce that the DVD I watched contained only ""Carnosaur 2,"" not both films as advertised here. While I am positive such a double feature disc exists, I am in no way thrilled at the prospect of watching it. Believe me when I say that spending roughly eighty-three minutes with this Roger Corman schlockfest doesn't inspire me to run out and watch any of the other pictures in what surely must rank as one of the master of the B-movie's most inane franchises. I'll invoke my theory of cinematic unintended consequences once again (a theory recently formulated and not fully mapped out as of yet) in order to place the blame for the Carnosaur series on Steven Spielberg. It's a fact that low budget film hacks watch the box office take of any given A-list blockbuster so as to churn out a cheap knockoff in an effort to cash in on public interest. Why blame them? It's the American way to turn a quick buck. We ought to blame the people responsible for the success of the original idea--in this case, Spielberg and his ""Jurassic Park."" If Stevie hadn't made a film about dinosaurs run amok, we wouldn't have to suffer through the unintended consequence that is the Carnosaur series.

Having not seen the original Carnosaur film, I can't say whether the sequel picks up where the first left off. It doesn't seem like it does, though. What we get here is a government operation called Yucca Mountain located in, predictably enough, Yucca Flats. On the surface, the installation employs a bunch of civilians to house uranium waste from the nation's nuclear weapons programs. Where do the dinosaurs, specifically carnosaurs, come into the picture? If you've spent any time watching science fiction films made in the last thirty years, the answer should be more than apparent: Yucca Mountain is a GOVERNMENT facility. That means everything we see is a sham concocted by Pentagon brass to hide a secret weapons program, in this case one using fossilized DNA to clone long extinct dinosaurs. Those crazy kooks at the Pentagon! Won't they ever learn that their top-secret programs always veer out of control and end up killing dozens of innocent people? Within minutes that's what happens in ""Carnosaur 2."" One of the toothy beasties emerges from the lab in the basement to make quick work of the hapless civilian employees up top. The only important survivor is the son of one of the workers, Jess (Ryan Thomas Johnson), who manages to escape the slaughter by hiding. Why the carnosaurs couldn't sniff this kid out with their acute sense of smell is never adequately explained.

Cue Major Tom McQuade (Cliff De Young), one of those secretive government intelligence operatives who always knows more than he's willing to let on. In this case, he hires an elite team of government electricians (!) to fly into Yucca Mountain in order to repair faulty wiring. Faulty wiring! Shouldn't they be sending in Navy SEALS, Green Berets, Delta Force, Sylvester Stallone, or any number of better suited, highly armed soldiers to deal with the problem? Not if they want to keep it a secret. Needless to say McQuade fails to inform his team about the dangers they face. Jack Reed (John Savage), helicopter pilot Joanne Galloway (Neith Hunter), Monk Brady (Rick Dean), computer programmer Ed Moses (Miguel A. Nunez), Sarah Rawlins (Arabella Holzbog) and Ben Kahane (Don Stroud) appear to have no idea that they are walking into a Roger Corman film let alone a lair of voracious dinosaurs. People start dying quickly, starting with pilot Galloway because her demise assures that the rest of the cannon fodder won't easily escape. Once inside the facility the movie degenerates into a lot of panicky running around punctuated with do or die action movie dialogue and capped off with a hilariously cheesy showdown between a bulldozer and the king of the carnosaurs. Whatever.

There is far more bad than good in ""Carnosaur 2."" The most pressing question dealing with the former centers on the presence of John Savage, star of such cinematic masterpieces as ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""The Onion Field."" What in the heck is he doing in this sludge? A look at his filmography provides a few clues: he's made far more bad movies than good ones, thus classifying him as a performer willing to throw artistic integrity out the door for a paycheck. Another issue that places this movie firmly under the ""bad"" rubric is the swiss cheese script. Why worry about dinosaurs out in the middle of the desert? They aren't going to go anywhere without food. Just seal the base off for a few weeks and starve the creatures out, right? Nope. Everyone knows it's far better to send in a lot of people to die in particularly gruesome ways. This last point provides the barest excuse to watch this tripe--the gore is good in places, especially a nasty ""arm torn from socket"" gag shown in gooey close-up, but the pedestrian pacing, action film cliches, and lousy dinosaur effects overwhelm any benefits rendered by good gore scenes.

Extras on the disc are standard for a Corman/New Concorde DVD release. Trailers for this film, ""Death Race 2000,"" ""Carnosaur 3,"" ""Piranha,"" ""Humanoids From the Deep,"" and cast filmographies round out the viewing ""experience."" I hate to say it, but I almost feel duty bound to seek out parts one and three after watching this film. As a self-professed lover of schlock it's almost a requirement. I'm not sure I can summon up the strength to follow through with this awesome responsibility, however. One can only watch so much dreck before thinking of better things to do with one's time, such as rearranging the sock drawer or shopping for shoelaces. But who knows? Maybe one of the other installments is worth a laugh...",1111017600,2,5727,4.840816326530613
628420,2,6303341888,"I usually like these low budget movies, but this one was just way too dumb.  There's some problem at what we're originally told is a uranium mine, so a group of...I don't even know what they are - are called in to investigate.  It's with these characters that the movie really lost all hope of being good.  These folks all act like obnoxious teenagers, choosing to complain and whine loudly instead of trying to solve the problem.  The dialogue doesn't make any sense;  someone tells them something they don't want to hear and they say things like ""You're sick!!!""  I mean, that's not even a plauable reaction to have.  I found myself wishing that when the characters were walking down a hallway, perhaps the writer and director would have actually engaged in the activity of walking down a hallway themselves, so as to come up with some idea of what people might actually say and do when walking down a hallway, instead of all this ridiculous stuff they've got these characters saying and doing.

Overall, this movie just took way too many liberties with my intelligence.  Like, toss a hand grenade at a carnosaur that's five feet away, and it blows the dino to bits but doesn't injure the person who threw it.  Who is still standing five feet away.  Or the guy who falls three stories onto a bed of steel pipes, and then complains he broke a rib (wouldn't he have probably broken his spine, considering he landed on his back?), and then within a couple of minutes he's not injured at all.  Or the dinosaur that breaks through a steel door that looks to be three inches thick.  What, they have a three inch thick steel door and then put a latch on it like you'd use for the screen door on your porch?  Or the entire ending of the film, which follows the ending of Aliens except on 1/1,000th the budget.  After seeing it, if you think about it for even two seconds, you'll realize it made no sense whatsoever.",1100822400,6,1909,4.508720930232558
628421,1,6303341888,"So much for relying on the stars rateing system. I paid $.79 and it was worth every penny but I got ripped off for the dimes, nickels and quarters.

628422,3,6303341888,"CARNOSAUR II tries to outdo its predecessor by waiting a while to show us the monsters and by using more refined filming.  However, somewhere in this translation, the movie failed to deliver the expected thrills.
First off, we have a very noticeable flaw in the script.  This movie indicates that dinosaur DNA had been harvested; in the original, Diane Ladd took sole credit for creating this virus.
Secondly, the movie used the same device to battle the creature:  the construction machine attacking and ultimately killing the dinosaur.
Third, how many more movies are we going to have the person who saves the day be a kid?  Hard to believe this catatonic youngster can be so bright and brave and outmuscle the adults.  I Have nothing against kids, but am tired of giving them such weight in a film, more than likely to attract a younger audience.
The acting is sub-par:  John Savage and his Brooklyn accent; Cliff DeYoung chewing up the scenery in the expected governmental conspiracy role; seventies character actor Don Stroud with a patch on his eye is wasted; and Rick Dean who tries to be comic relief in the role of Monk acts like he's reading teleprompter cards.
There's not as much suspense as the original, and I will probably watch the third movie, just to see if they try anything a little more original.  Highly overrated, but a good time passer.",1072915200,,1360,4.761702127659574

7844065,5,6303341888,"Best film in the Carnosaur series hands down!
First, yes this film has a similar plot to Aliens (1986).
Second, I like how in this film, you don't see the creature(s) for the first half of the film. Similar film style to Alien and Jaws, you wonder what is killing everyone for the first half of the film, and in this one, characters are seen being dragged by something offscreen, and you're eager to know what it is.
Third, the raptors in this film do look scarier than the ones in the first film, but still look and behave as if they're nothing more than people in rubber costumes.
Fourth, this film has several death scenes but when it comes to gore, it's mostly off screen. There are only 2 gory death scenes in this film. Both can be difficult to watch.
Fifth, what's up with the T-rex? It looks like something out of a museum, and isn't frightening at all though it behaves menacingly.

I give this film 5 stars for creativity",1453248000,,931,4.381502890173411
7844066,3,6303341888,"I remember watching this movie as a kid and recently I been rewatching movies that I found scary as a child. This was one of those movies. What I remember is a scene where a woman got her arm ripped off and I wasn't sure which Carnosaur it was so I bought the 1&2 dvd pack. I found the movie I watched as a child was indeed Carnosaur 2.

First, I'd like to say the major issue with this movie is that it doesn't have Closed Caption. I am hard of hearing, and while I got most of the movie, I felt I would get the most benefit with closed caption or subtitles enabled.

Now for the review of Carnosaur 2. When I first watched the movie, I couldn't quite put my finger on it as it felt similar to another movie out there. It wasn't until the helicopter pilot said, ""Turning on final"" that I finally got it. This movie borrowed the entire Aliens plotline, and simply converted it to their own movie about dinosaurs. I couldn't tell you the exact reason why they did it. If I had to speculate, I figured the movie makers probably thought that since Aliens gave the franchise a major boost, it would do the same for this movie. You can identify each of the major characters from Aliens movie in this film. It doesn't have Ripley, but it does have Newt as a male teenager, Cpl Hicks as a sort of dual role with Ripley, and you have Lt Gorman, Apone, Ferro the ace pilot, Burke the evil corporate person, and a lot of other characters. Of course their names changed, but you can definitely see each character I mentioned in this movie in one form or another in terms of personality type and their purpose in the script.

Whatever reason it was for the stolen plot, the movie failed for more than just borrowing a plotline. While the plot works, what failed is the fact that the movie made zero sense. Absolutely no sense at all. Well I should say at first it made some sense: a team of mercenaries/contractors are sent to a facility that lost contact. The team was supposed to make the facility operational but when they came, they found it was empty and broken down. Now this is where the movie starts to make no sense. While the movie initially started as a expert team who can get the facility up and running, nobody, minus one person, seemed to know how to get the place running. Matter of fact, you have no idea what each character was suppose to do. At first they seemed to be simply contractors able to get the facility running, then they seemed to be ex-military types acting as mercenaries but they have no weapons of any kind. They just all came into this facility, went crazy, and died. Basically it's like Aliens but making zero sense. Oh yeah, at the end, everything blew up for no reason. At first it sounded like the facility was going to be blown up on its own, then they got dynamites, then there was a count down, but when the clock reached zero, it didn't actually blow up until they blew up the dynamites.

The dinosaurs were the worst. I mean the movie could have really done fine with the bad dinosaur design if it actually made sense. Again, the facility was just overtaken by dinosaur, but they were just running around killing everything for no reason. The funny thing is in one part a character managed to kill a dinosaur by a simple flare gun. It seems like if they had actual firearms, they could simply go in, clean out the place, and go on home. But that isn't the case, for whatever reason.

The only part I was excited to see was the arm rip off scene. It was the most brutal scene of the entire movie. Matter of fact, the mercenaries or whatever the heck they are, were standing not more than 10 ft from where this poor woman was getting her arm torn off by a dino and brutally killed. I'm sort of glad this is all I remembered of this movie because everything else is forgettable.

A final thing: they not only stole the plot but props too. The part where the pilot was coming in and stealing the line, ""Turning on Final"" I notice the helmet she is wearing belongs to the movie Robocop. The helmet is the exact same as the movie itself. I thought that was funny.

It seems like this was a ultra low budget film where they stole a plot, and stole props to make something that made zero sense. My overall thought is you could probably skip this movie.",1433548800,2,4276,4.310945273631841

7844068,4,6303341888,"Here's my review of CARNOSAUR 2:
Roger Corman does it again. He had Michael Palmer recycle the script of THE TERROR WITHIN (1988 - which was a rip-off of ALIEN [1979], which was a rip-off of IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE [1958]) and substituted dinosaurs for mutant creatures. A cleanup crew go into an underground nuclear dump site and become trapped, being picked-off one by one by genetically engineered dinosaurs who were exposed to the leaking radiation. That's basically the entire plot. There are some juicy dismemberments and gut-munching scenes but not nearly enough to forget that this is basically deja vu all over again. It's of interest if only to see how low the careers of John Savage (TV's DARK ANGEL [2000 - 2002]), Cliff DeYoung and Don Stroud have sunk. Also starring Rick Dean (ISLAND OF BLOOD - 1982), Ryan Thomas Johnson and Arabella Holzbog. Directed by the numbers and without imagination by Louis Morneau (QUAKE - 1992; BATS - 1999). This sequel definitely does not have the weirdness factor of the first CARNOSAUR (1993), which was really only a quick cash-in of Spielberg's JURASSIC PARK (1993), but turned out to be one of Roger Corman's best films of the 90's. A New Horizons Home Video Release. Rated R.",1429920000,,1236,4.834905660377358
7844069,4,6303341888,"Believe it or not, I  actually bought a used copy of the double feature  on one dvd at a local retailer that still sells new & used dvds, cds, and vinyl a few years back.  Before that, I'd rented both movies on vhs and dvd many times back when videostores were still around.  I'm in complete agreement with other reviewers who picked ""Carnosaur 2""as the best of the bunch.  Even though it cribs most of the plot and story from ""Aliens"" and ""Jurassic Park"" (both all-time classics), Carnosaur 2 is really the movie the first ""Jurassic Park"" should've been.  Even though JP had prettier, more realistic dinosaurs and a far bigger budget (not to mention more prestige), I much preferred the darker, more visceral tone of Corman's ""C2"".  Yes, the limitations of the low budget, practical effects were obvious, but this is a case of a low budget movie outshining a major ""tentpole"" picture.  Plus, I thought it was a very nice touch to give the C2 T-Rex the same classic roar featured in ""The Land Unknown"" and the 1976 version of ""King Kong.""

This movie takes me back to a time before the advent of cgi, a time when SFX artists really had to use their skill and ingenuity to bring the various characters and creatures to life onscreen.  The results varied, but there were  low-budget filmmakers who were able to transcend the limitations of their meager budgets.  I personally think that Carnosaur 2 is one of them.

Both movies are still head and shoulders above anything made by The Asylum or any of the other schlockmeisters producing ""Monster of the Week"" dreck for the SyFy channel.  If you are one of those who thinks cgi reigns supreme over all, please skip purchasing this dvd.  If you enjoy low-budget sci-fi horror with bite and 80s-styled practical FX, please give this double feature a try.  This is definitely one of Roger Corman's finer efforts.",1427068800,,1856,4.682098765432099
