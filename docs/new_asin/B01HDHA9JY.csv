8765045,1,B01HDHA9JY,This is not a movie.  It deserves negative stars.  They dress up a few dogs in costumes then film them sitting there. Then they film cats sleeping and drinking water.

8765046,1,B01HDHA9JY,"This is just dumb animal videos.  It's not an animated movie with a story or anything.  Save your money and type ""funny animal videos"" into YouTube",1490486400,,147,4.615384615384615
8765047,1,B01HDHA9JY,"Absolutely aweful. I rented this from Redbox and I was so glad it was a rental. It is not an animated movie. It is a majorly under-budgeted and poorly done compilation of movie clips you can find on YouTube or America's Funny Home Videos and even that is giving it more credit than it likely deserves. I am all for cute movies, I just watched Storks even, but this I had to turn off and am truly disappointed. I have no idea why this even ended up in Redbox.",1487894400,,458,4.157303370786517
