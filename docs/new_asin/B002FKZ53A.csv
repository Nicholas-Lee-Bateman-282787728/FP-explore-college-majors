8369094,5,B002FKZ53A,"Of all the many films I have seen that were influenced by Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" this is the best. Other movies that the film-makers might have seen and profited by are Goran Paskaljevic's ""Cabaret Balkan"" and Mike Figgis's ""Timecode."" In any case, I mainly list the comparisons in order to give potential viewers a sense of where the film is cinematically situated. This is a brilliant piece of work in its own right.

""Cambio de suerte"" follows the intersecting adventures of about a dozen lowlife characters in the streets of a Mexico City neighborhood in one evening. If you are easily put off by nasty characters, don't watch this! - I had to remind myself that I was safe, that the scuzziness I was seeing couldn't leak through to my side of the screen.

We return to many events from different points of view that reveal unexpected dimensions to what we thought we had already digested - particularly in the case of an episode of sexual violence that bookends the film. Jorge Ramirez Rivera plays with politically incorrect material in a way that some might find offensive, but can actually be defended as philosophical. So I'm glad he took that risk.

I would love to see the film-makers' minute-by-minute chart of the characters' locations and movements! It all works out with an impressive hair's-breadth precision.

""Cambio de suerte"" is available on DVD with English subtitles, but I might have missed seeing it if a friend hadn't loaned it to me, because the DVD case says that the film is in 1.33:1 full-screen, which would have put me off buying it. The case is in error. The film is correctly offered in all its 2.35:1 glory.

I hope that I have encouraged some of you to find this film and give it a chance. I watch a lot of movies, and I was really grabbed by ""Cambio de suerte.""",1373760000,,1802,4.654088050314465
