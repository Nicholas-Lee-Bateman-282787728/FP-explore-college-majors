8232787,5,B000YGP6RW,"To those who are looking to purchase this DVD to complete their collection of Eureka Seven volumes, you might seem a little freaked out by the price. Allow me to explain why this 4 episode single volume DVD is worth nearly 300 smackers.
When it was initially released, the 11th volume of Eureka 7 contained a defect on the disc. This then caused a giant recall on Bandai's part to refund every defected copy. Afterwards, plans to reprint the DVD never happened, until it was included in the Anime Legends set for Eureka Seven a few years later. With Bandai no longer being a distributor of anime and manga products (as of March 2013), the odds of ever seeing any sort of rerelease for Eureka Seven DVD's seems quite slim.

With that said, this disc contains 4 episodes leading up to the final volume, and extras that include and interview with some of the Japanese cast and a commentary on episode 43.",1383350400,2,901,4.561728395061729
8232788,5,B000YGP6RW,"This is the missing Volume of Netflix, and so worth completing the series!  In this Volume, Eureka's metamophosis in body and maturity, is reinforced by Renton's unswerving love.  Which, is also reflected in the relationships of: Dominic/Anemone; Holland/Talho: and, even Mischa/Bear, and all of whose relationships grow stronger. The ""chihldren"" also develop into stronger personalities and serve to reinforce the broader story. Dewey's plan becomes clear, and Captain Jurgens discovers the truth behind it. While many parts of the story become clear, the ending brings in another twist.  The writers and director work their magic effectively, and this Volume opens the door to the climactic ending!",1279670400,,700,5.584905660377358
8232789,5,B000YGP6RW,"Things move pretty slowly in these 4 episodes. We get a lot of important developments though so it's apparent this is the calm before the storm. Stoners importance is demonstrated through his articles and photographs, though this isn't given as much attention as I had hoped. Where everyone stands going in to the final confrontations is now apparent. We do get a tad more angst on the Renton and Eureka side of things, but it's nothing extreme or awkward.

On the technical side it actually seems that it was a bit above the the norm for the series in regards to animation and art. The rest remains strong as well, although lesser characters are getting fewer and fewer lines, which is a bit unfortunate.

It's a bit of a slower set of episodes, but the development of the story we receive is worth it. The next volume really can not come fast enough.

8232790,5,B000YGP6RW,"In Eureka Seven volume 11 you will recieve four terrific episodes of the series on one DVD. Specifically these are episodes 43 upto and including 46. So, if you haven't yet seen the earlier episodes of this series, do not read on to the following summary.

The time to act is now! In this volume, the secrets of this show begin to be unveiled as we get a glimpse into Dewey's less than average childhood as the ""Sacrificial King."" After hearing what Dewey had to endure even Anemone feels deeply afraid. Just how far is Dewey willing to go in his scheme?

We also learn a bit of Anemone's horrifying past when Dominic goes to Warsaw to find her replacement. After seeing what Anemone had to endure, Dominic is sickened and must choose a path- to believe and support Dewey, or save Anemone. We also get a bit of character development from Jurgens, someone who has appeared in the show on and off from the beginning. As you'll see, he must also make a choice in this volume.

Elsewhere, tensions are running high both on and off the Gekko. Holland has begun to pilot a new LFO that is slowly eating away at his life, while the rest of the crew struggle to mount an effective resistance against Dewey and buy time for Renton, Eureka, and the children. In the promised land, something strange is happening to Eureka's body and she and Renton are beginning to face a snag in their relatioship. What does this transformation signify and just what exactly is the promised land? As this volume ends, Renton sees an all too familiar face - but what does this mean!?

Extras on this disc include Audio Commentary on episode 43 by the Japanese voices of Renton, Eureka, and Dewey. There is also more of the interview with the Japanese voice actors of Holland and Talho. Audio and subtitles are the same as all previous volumes. Overall these are four terrific and very interesting episodes of a show I deeply enjoy for an alright price. As Dewey begins his final assault all remaining secrets must be revealed and questions must be answered. The final battle is about to begin!",1199836800,4,2066,4.575675675675676
