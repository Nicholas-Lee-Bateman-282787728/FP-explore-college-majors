3064491,5,B0011E9NTS,"This 13 week series on ABC evolved from Jerry's surprisingly popular Tonight Show guest gig earlier that year.  He was a given a huge contract, a theatre in his name, and 2 hours of primetime on Saturday evenings - and then, due to low ratings, was abruptly cancelled. Too bad! This particular show, in late 1963, just after the murder of President Kennedy, features the great Sam Cooke in two superb performances, a great segment with the then Cassius Clay, prior to his defeat of Sonny Liston, and a knock-out rendition of ""Birth of the Blues"" by Jerry that stops the show. The good and bad Jerry are all here - he was justifiably upset at ABC for cancelling his show and his venom towards them is undisguised. However, in his good to great moments, with Clay, his song, some of the interviews, you could see where this could have been a terrific show if handled the right way.  Two hours was too much.  The show should also have been in color, if that was possible back in that day, and probably should have been given a better time slot.  Jerry is a genius, but often could be his own worst enemy.  His partnership with Dean Marin remains one of the best of all-time and, when he's entertaining at his best, he's better than ANYONE currently hosting late night TV. This segment of this brief series shows all the promise - and problems - of what could have been a really terrific, classic show if it had been given more time and care. Jerry's band is first-class.  His clowning is great. The guest stars are mostly all terrific - although the monkey act goes on too long -and it's better than anything I've seen from the likes of Jimmy Fallon or even Conan O'Brien or others.  Jerry's is a deep talent - and when he's at his best, he's top of the heap.  ABC really blew it.  This is a MUST for all Lewis fans - much more entertaining, and, at times, moving (Jerry talking about sharing baseball with his young sons), than you could imagine.  A five star treat!  Grab it!",1238716800,32,1974,4.425414364640884

There were three versions of the Jerry Lewis Show. His second outing was a live 2-hour variety series that aired on ABC-TV. Its ""television graveyard"" timeslot (Saturday, 9:30-11:30 PM) undoubtedly contributed to the program's demise. Despite the comic's 5-year, $35 million contract and having purchased and renamed L.A.'s El Capitan Theater as The Jerry Lewis Theater, the network ditched Jerry's show after only 13 weeks.

Presented here is episode #11, from December 7th, '63. It features Top 40 singer Sam Cooke, novelty act Se&ntilde;or Wencas and his hand puppets, comedian Phil Foster, the Marquis Chimps (sitcom stars of  ""The Hathaways""), colatura soprano Patrice Munsel and heavyweight boxer Cassius Clay (who would triumph over Sonny Liston on 2/25/64).

Lewis sings three numbers and is typically Jerry. Wences is allowed to stretch, unlike on the Sullivan show, where his appearances were confined to a few minutes. Clay displays all the arrogance and flash of the later Muhammad Ali. The chimps were naturally somewhat unpredictable on live TV. Munsel tones it down for a pop song while Foster livens things up.

Minus commercials, this program runs 1 hour, 43 minutes.

8241490,5,B0011E9NTS,"Love everything about Jerry Lewis. It's sad that as much success as he's had in his career, he's met with some real bullies between network tv and the telethon management. He is one of the few entertainers who I would love to know personally. This is a ""must have"" for those who admire his work as much as I do.",1429574400,,311,4.2

8241492,5,B0011E9NTS,"I would like it if Jerry's entire season of this show was available. It ought to be a boxed set. I want more! This is Jerry's 1963 show, and Jerry fans will enjoy this. It has Cassis Clay before he became Mohammed Ali, and Jerry tells him that he is a great showman--which is what a lot of talk show hosts told him. Senor Wences the puppeteer is on and an opera singer doing songs from Porgy and Bess. I didn't think much of her song choices for her voice, which would be better in Italian, but Jerry was a fan of opera. The best bit has Jerry singing a song while on a camera boom. Jerry's singing ought to be put on CD. His best singing was on his shows and the Telethon",1374883200,,672,4.022388059701493
8241493,4,B0011E9NTS,"It should be saaid at the outset that this show was videoed roughly 1-2 weeks after the Kennedy assassination and the viewer should undersatnd that the performers and the audience was still in shock. One reviewer said Jerry's timing was off - I think the show as a whole was ""off""...and it's understandable.

Here we have a Show Business Titan with some of the most important artists and p0ersonalities of the day: MUHAMMAD ALI (as CASSIUS CLAY), discussing upcoming Liston match and reading original poetry); SAM COOKE (two live songs - rarer than rare and a feast for Pop music fans, as there is very, very little footage of Cooke available); PATRICE MUENSEL (a great Opera star doing two numbers, one a Gershwin medley - she's a good egg, doing probably the best *comedy* bit in the whole show; PHIL FOSTER (straight-faced, dour comedian, another good foil for the KIng Of Comedy); plus some Ed Sullivan stand-bys (if you can take them, see description above).

A two hour, live variety show..on its' last legs. It appears it ahd maybe two weeks to go before its' December 21st, 1963 Finale Show.

In the end, with all the natural drama of the time, and the depressing realoization that it would soon be over for Jerry at ABC, it's this awesome artist, multi-talented and multi-dimensional, Jerry Lewis, who sustains the proceedings...and delivers a wonderful closing number, a lullably from one of his best films, ""Rock A-Bye Baby""...amazingly, the best part of the show is Jerry...and his Music!",1312329600,8,1500,4.897637795275591

8241495,5,B0011E9NTS,"I have always admired Jerry Lewis as a top movie comedian and his devotion to MDA. This 103 minute DVD shows a rare piece of Jerry Lewis. His short lived 1963 tv series on ABC. I remember reading about this series. To me I thought this show had its entertainin moments with the late Sam Cooke, Senor Wences and the Greatest, Muhammad Ali (of course,known as Cassius Clay in this 1963 airing). Phil Foster was okay before his big break on Laverne and Shriley some 13 years later. Jerry does a great job with The Birth of the Blues. I am looking forward to another collection of Jerry Lewis tv shows on DVD in October. This DVD is not bad! Enjoy it if you like Jerry Lewis!",1250899200,8,671,4.291338582677166
