7012914,4,B00TLU4H4A,"Great documentary on a Boston TV station that was only on for a year and a half. One didn't need cable to pick up Ch 66 with its music videos, including local bands. Getting advertisers was the problem. Interviews with ""VJs"" and founders John Garabedian and Arnie Ginsburg. Videos helped bands to promote their music and there was a whole Boston vibe to V66, including a Patriots rally video.",1430524800,,392,4.695652173913044
7012915,5,B00TLU4H4A,"My younger days flashed before me during this wonderful nostalgic doc about the all-too-short-lived broadcast music video channel V66 in Boston. The stations 20-month life seemed longer at the time, but that's more about being a teenager. The extras about Boston's 1980s music scene and additional footage that was edited out of the final product are as wonderful as the (award-winning) feature itself. When I first heard that this was being made several years ago, I couldn't wait for its release, especially since I've lived in the Midwest for so long, away from my native Massachusetts. The wait was more than worth it.

Even if didn't live around Boston in the mid-eighties, get this is you're a fan of the many bands that came out of that place and time: The Cars, Aerosmith, Extreme, 'Til Tuesday, etc. or just 1980s music (and music videos) in general. For instance, A-Ha's groundbreaking video for ""Take on Me"" was shown on V66 before MTV.

The doc is also great on other levels: a David and Goliath story, pioneers venturing into uncharted waters, and a how-to for would-be broadcast startups. The station's 20-month life isn't a true of measure of it's success. As a purveyor of 1980s era culture and art, it was a reflection and a reflector of its time. The doc does a terrific job of conveying this importance well beyond the station's lifetime.",1430265600,2,1357,4.844827586206897
8702226,5,B00TLU4H4A,"I was about 12 during the V era and didn't have cable so this channel was wonderful as it was the early years of my life-long love for music. Just like every other guy had a big crush on Mary Jo, who still looks great today. This documentary does a great job of explaining how the channel came to be and how it disappeared; information most of us never knew about. There is a good amount of artist appearances/interviews dispersed among the VJ interviews. Too bad it didn't last into the 90s as bands like Letters to Cleo would have been darlings of the station. I can still remember when it changed to HSC ;(",1511740800,,609,4.304347826086956
8702227,5,B00TLU4H4A,"As another kid growing up watching the music videos of Til Tuesday's ""Voices Carry"" and a-ha's ""Take On Me"" surface on the upper UHF channels in the 80's, I'd wondered whatever happened to WVJV-66, ""The Beat of Boston"", too, but never realized how deep the story went--The story of local radio producer John Garabedian's startup dream to buck the MTV Monster, and bring an all-music-video TV channel to free airwaves in the early-mid 80's, is more than just a story of Boston music or the rise and fall of 80's music-videos:  It's a story of what happened to Local Programming, and how a local independent UHF station could become the spirit and identity of its local viewers--Local NE/Boston viewers could see local bands, local sports and local issues, and connect with concerts and events in their own hometown, in a way that just wasn't possible on the cable channels or national networks.  But reality set in, channels needed programs for ratings and sponsors, and within two years, the station was showing Home Shopping Network and Univision.  The story of V-66 reminds us of the days when local TV was local TV, big or small, before every little maverick channel with a dream, a struggling crew and a viewership were eaten up by faceless new national networks and the need to generate profit and a brand name.",1509062400,,1316,4.814159292035399
8702228,5,B00TLU4H4A,"Admittedly for a very niche audience, but right up my alley!  Was a (small) part of that music scene in and around Boston in the mid-80's, and this captured it for me, and brought back a lot of memories.  I didn't really know the whole story about V-66, honestly, nor how briefly it lasted, but what a story it was!",1509062400,,315,4.233333333333333
8702229,4,B00TLU4H4A,Loved it until the appearance of Ernie Boch Jr at the end. Soured it all for me. I'll let you figure it out why.,1506297600,,112,3.7083333333333335

8702232,5,B00TLU4H4A,"Growing up in Plymouth during the 80s, V66 was the bomb, especially for a young kid at the time.  We had cable, but only one box.  It wasn't like today where every kid has their own TV and cable and other multi-media.  I had the old family black and white TV with the rabbit ears.  Okay, the ears were broken.  I had the coat hanger and tin foil.  I digress.  V66 was right there next to the best damn cartoon station, channel 56 WLVI.  V66 played all the cool videos and you could call in and request them.  Some things I did realize as a kid, if you request the most popular video (Take On Me), of course they're going to play it.  It's not just you asking for it.  Also, V66 was only on the air for 18 months.  Really?  It seemed like ""forever"" to me.  This documentary was great.  The little music station that could have been, but sold out to the mighty dollar.  Okay, sold out is a strong word, but money was a huge factor in its eventual demise.  Those outside of New England may have never heard of it, but V66 will live on in the memories of the locals.  The Story of V66 chronicles the entire venture from those that were a part of it.  Well worth your time.",1442793600,3,1168,4.111111111111111
8702233,5,B00TLU4H4A,"WVJV will never be forgotten! It was an amazing movie, and I'm so indsanely happy I had the chance to watch something so historic like that! Anybody who liked MTV, VH1 or fuse back in its hayday, this music channel V66 was way better than all of them and nothing will ever replace it. It was kind of emotional at the end, but had a great story line.",1441152000,,349,4.147058823529412
