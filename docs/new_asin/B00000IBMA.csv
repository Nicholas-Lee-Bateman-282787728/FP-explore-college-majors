1219233,3,B00000IBMA,"If you're not a Betty Grable or Dan Dailey fan, forget it.  The numbers are forgettable, the story is saccharine and uninvolving.  It does have going for it fine Technicolor cinematography - Oscar  nominated - and  Alfred Newman's lively orchestrations (OSCAR WON FOR SCORING).  Costumes  are lavish, especially Grable's.",934934400,7,321,5.448979591836735

1219235,5,B00000IBMA,"Shock: This film opens with a shot of Betty Grable in a rocking-chair busily knitting! But not for long! We are quickly whipped back in time to the end-of-term musical at Oakland High, and there is Grable, a lovely,  leggy teenager dancing her heart out.
This was the first teaming of  Grable and Dan Dailey and he proved a lively partner. The couple hit it off  right away and their screen charm came over well in this touching family  story of the problems this vaudeville pair had bringing up a family while  still 'on the road.'  Betty and Dan fairly romp through some fine singing  and dancing. Easily one of Betty's finest movies.",933033600,15,636,4.575221238938053

1219261,5,B00000IBMA,"A charming nostalgic musical with Betty Grable and Dan Dailey  as vaudeville parents  raising two daughters  in comical and sentimental scenarios.  I had been trying to find this dvd for a while and was happy to finally purchase it.
I highly recommend it for family fun.",1405641600,,270,4.804347826086956
1219262,2,B00000IBMA,"Another charming turn of the 'last' century musical gets short shrift in Fox's MOD DVD program. Weak contrast and colors, residual softness throughout. Not the way I want to remember such a heartwarming movie. Not the way you should either. Pass.",1405641600,6,246,5.024390243902439
1219263,5,B00000IBMA,"An outstanding print for this Fox Cinema Archives MOD of an outstanding musical, the first of four starring Betty Grable with her new leading man Dan Dailey.  Based on a true story about a vaudeville family, it was the fourth most popular movie of 1947, and said to be Grable's favorite of her movies.  The children are played by Mona Freeman (who also starred that year in Dear Ruth) and Connie Marshall (a hit in 1948's Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House) with Veda Ann Borg, Sara Allgood and William Frawley.  Anne Baxter narrates as the youngest daughter recalling her memories.  Oscar winning score by Alfred Newman.  If you're into a nostalgic story with songs, this one's for you.",1404000000,,689,4.756302521008403
1219264,4,B00000IBMA,"I agree one of Grable's best films and purportedly Grable's favorite.  First teaming with Dan Dailey and they make a perfect team.  Chemistry is right on the mark. Also, some lovely songs.  I have to disagree about the FOX print.  As usual this DVD-R has its problems.  The colors are inconsistent and sometimes soft looking. This musical must have looked gorgeous when first released to the theatres.  The film should have been re-mastered and rates a Blu Ray release.  If I am not mistaken of the Grable musicals only BILLY'S ROSE'S DIAMOND HORSESHOE has yet to be released.",1401148800,4,576,4.816326530612245

1219276,5,B00000IBMA,"I am somewhat reluctant to buy Fox Archive movies. They have received a lot of bad press with their issues of CinemaScope releases in pan and scan, a format I would avoid like the plague, a release must be in the correct ratio before I would buy.
Therefore so glad I decided to purchase the 4:3 made to order release of Mother Wore Tights, the quality is excellent and a joy to watch.
Thank you for your prompt service and kindly response.

1219277,5,B00000IBMA,"This has been a favorite for decades! This is one my children have loved since their first viewing and have asked to watch again and again. I can't tell you how pleased I am to finally have this on DVD! Purchased two and it should have been three, one for home and one for each of the girls. Oops!",1396051200,,297,4.0508474576271185

1219279,5,B00000IBMA,"A whimsical tender recollection rendered in a lovely flashback narrative vehicle that recounts not only the career but also the romance of the narrator's parents.  From Vaudville and beyond, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey deliver seamless dance and song numbers that underlie the natural chemistry the two possess.  Similar to Meet Me In St. Louis in tone, this film yields a unique plot that celebrates the ""naughty nineties"" in grand style.  Without a doubt, Betty Grable's best cinematic achievement...  five stars is not enough.  Anyone who enjoys the title mentioned above or Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, will love this piece.  Pure perfection, perfect pacing, perfectly delightful!",1395100800,,685,5.355140186915888
1219280,4,B00000IBMA,"Pretty good print for Fox Screen Archives. Ah, the good old days with Betty Grable dancing and singing with her constant co-star Dan Daily. It's fun, tuneful and entertaining. You can't go wrong with Grable.",1394668800,,207,4.942857142857143
1219281,5,B00000IBMA,"Betty Grable stars, for the first time with Dan Dailey,
in this story of a vaudeville family. Betty is hand-picked by Dan
from the chorus to co-star in his new act. Soon after they are married
and two daughters are added to the family (Mona Freeman and
Connie Marshall). There are many wonderful musical moments and
some great songs as the story moves from the vaudeville stage
to the eldest daughter's high school graduation. Songs include,
Berlington Bertie From Bow, You Do, This Is My Favorite City,
Kokomo Indiana, Stumbling, Rolling Down Bowling Green, Silent Night...

The most exciting news is that Fox Cinema Archives got this one
right. This may be the best looking of all their dvds.
The picture quality, the color and the sound are as good as it gets.
You may want to pump up the color setting on your TV a bit,
but it looks great either way.

There are no extras, but if you love this film, don't hesitate
to add it to your collection.",1394323200,9,948,4.538011695906433
1219282,3,B00000IBMA,"I have adored Betty Grable for years. Many of her movies I have never been given the chance to see yet as they aren't available however, when they do become available, I purchase them right away. Mother Wore tights is a film that i just purchased and was dying to see it. Though Betty is gorgeous and does a good job in her role and her performances, I found the movie to be rather boring. The tunes weren't catchy like they are in many of her other films and it didn't seem that the cast was giving it their all. Im not going to say its a bad movie, as I have seen many people enjoyed it. All I am going to say that it is no where near as good as Moon Over Miami, Down Argentine Way, Pin Up Girl or even Springtime in the Rockies. Those are musicals worth looking into. This one is just worth adding to your collection just to say you have seen it.",1394150400,,849,4.029585798816568
1219283,5,B00000IBMA,"Betty Grable is an ideal choice for the title role.  She looks great in those tights and performs her musical numbers with her usual sparkle.  But the role calls for more.  Grable probably has never acted better.  When her character discovers her elder daughter is ashamed of her parents' profession, she is completely convincing with her responses.  It was her personal favourite of all her movies and deservedly her most successful at the box office.  I'd award her an Oscar.",1393286400,,477,4.9
1219284,5,B00000IBMA,This film was every bit an enjoyable as I remember it being when I first saw it in the movie theatre.,1390780800,,101,3.857142857142857
1219285,1,B00000IBMA,This DVD shows the stars in English. So you would think it would be a English movie. Not so! Also its title reads Mother wore tights! The DVD is in Spanish.,1389052800,,156,4.064516129032258
1219296,5,B00000IBMA,This was her best movie..because of original songs and dances with Dan Dailey..true to life story line. The book was written by daughter of the  vaudeville  couple.  I see this film and the other three..see above ..over and over.,1381276800,,229,4.82051282051282
1219297,4,B00000IBMA,"Ok, by now reading all the reviews you get the idea ""this is a very good movie"" I also saw it in the Theater, so I ordered it, I was afraid that as with the DVD'S from Brazil this would be a copy of a VHS tape and not remastered for DVD viewing, and I was (unfortunately) correct in that assumption, what a shame this is one of Betty Grables best movies (as I understand it, it was her favorite) now considering that Grable movies kept FOX from bankruptcy during and even after the second world war, you might think that Grable fans would be rewarded (as would her memory) by digital remastering and doing things right, but no, Fox has no respect for her at all, what a shame, Fox executives should hang their heads in shame, if watching VHS is fine with you good on ya, it's not fine with me, so I will trade it for something else, since Warner is taking old classics and doing it right, maybe they will step in (one can only hope)",1356652800,3,932,4.183333333333334

1219299,5,B00000IBMA,"Growing up, I used to watch this movie every time it came on Disney.  Until 2003 it had never been released for retail purchase.  I looked for it for years, and was thrilled when they finally started releasing some of the Grable classics.  It's a great musical and the songs will stick with you forever.  I've recently heard rumors that it is going to be released on DVD sometime in 2008.",1199577600,2,388,4.422535211267606
1219300,3,B00000IBMA,"Although this was Betty Grable's most successful film in the forties and broke from the normal backstage conventions of her films, it suffers from a severe attack of the ""cutes"" in 2006. Dan Dailey partners Betty and their rapport is obvious. They are charming but corny. The film traces the lives of a vaudeville couple who meet, marry and raise 2 daughters. The song and dance routines are generally undemanding and therefore unimpressive. At least Grable looks great and the opening routine is the liveliest and best of the whole film. It has more energy than the rest of the film put together. The film is very well made with the trademark Fox photography and the production values are high.

The film offers friendly family entertainment but there is no edge so it dates badly. Much of the film is simply boring.",1141603200,3,817,4.753521126760563
1219301,4,B00000IBMA,"Mother Wore Tights is a story about a vaudeville dancer and her life through the narration of her second daughter. It is a sweet story filled with music, romance, and family.

Betty Grable is excellent in this film. Her character ages from being a teenager to an adult to a mother to and elderly grandmother. Unlike actresses who age so much in other films, Grable is highly believable at each point in her character's life and she is also quite beautiful too.

Dan Dailey plays Grable's husband, a somewhat awkward man with great confidence and nimble dancing ability. He makes a great match with Grable.

The two children, Iris and Mikie, are played by Mona Freeman and Connie Marshall. Each are great in their parts and help to make the story interesting as it goes along. Without them, the film would not have been as good.

This film is filled with songs, none of them randomly sung out of the blue to express emotion, but because the characters are performing in vaudeville or because they feel like singing a song for fun. ""Who Knows How Much I Love You?"" is sung several times in the film, each time becoming more and more beautiful and meaningful. ""Kokomo, Indiana"" is sung twice in the film and is a catchy, happy song. The costumes used in the stage numbers are traditional and gorgeous, not too flashy.

This film combines the joviality of music and the sentiment of family. For those who enjoy these two genres of film, see this one!",1134604800,12,1446,4.610894941634241
1219302,4,B00000IBMA,"I read the negative reviews and understand that to some it's a little dull, and the musical/dance numbers aren't the greatest of all time, but I just adore this movie!  It's one of those lay down and relax with a bowl of popcorn on a rainy day type of flicks.  Also very uplifting for those ""blue"" days.  Takes you back to a simpler time, there's not a lot of action or drama and no violence.  Great family entertainment - good clean fun.  I try to catch it every time it comes on -- I just love this one!",1118188800,11,505,4.112244897959184
1219303,5,B00000IBMA,"This movie is an all time favorite for my children and me.  Great ""values"" with close family trying to stay together despite parents' jobs in show business and adolescent girls not wanting ""to be seen"" with parents.  Much warmth with fabulous, uplifting old vaudeville tunes--great singing and dancing--kids of all ages love it. It is so obvious that there was strong, mutual admiration between Dan Dailey and Betty Grable.",1067558400,18,423,5.115942028985507
1219304,2,B00000IBMA,"A perfectly dreadful song-and-dance musical starring Betty Grable as a wholesome hoofer who marries her Vaudeville partner, has kids, but still can't shake the call of the road.  The plot is pedestrian and minimal, the dance routines are incredibly repetitive, and Grable's Technicolor winsomeness is a faint echo of her wartime glory days.  Kind of okay, but really not.  You really have to be into Grable to love this one.",1032652800,,424,5.0285714285714285
1219305,5,B00000IBMA,This movie has given my daughter and I hours of fun! The dance scenes make your feet tap and the songs are sweet. I love to watch the chemistry between Betty Grable and her co-stars. The children are fun and good  actresses themselves. The values taught are still great for today!
