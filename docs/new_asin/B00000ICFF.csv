7910639,4,B00000ICFF,"This is one of those movies I saw once, briefly, on HBO way back in the day.  But its strange ambience and incredible location (I'm guessing it's a European estate of some historical royal family) made it memorable.  The acting and plot are competent, and set against the grandeur of an old world estate, it all works.  We can all hope that a copy will make it on to video on demand at some point!",1345075200,,397,4.266666666666667
