8368457,5,B002EXIX28,"In 1966 American International released this Euro-spy outing for Richard Harrison ""Secret Agent Fireball"" on a double feature with ""Spy in Your Eye"" starring Brett Halsey, Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews.  ""Secret Agent Fireball"" (original title:  ""Le Spie Uccidono a Beirut"") and AKA ""The Spy Killers"" and others is listed in an AIP historical listing as directed by Mario Donen.  The film credit lists him as Martin Donan, but the DVD credits him as Luciano Martino.  It was written by the great Ernesto Gastaldi and Sergio Martino.  Music by Carlo Savina and also starring Dominique Boschero.  That is not the first time I've come across Italian directors and actors donning glib American names and it is an injustice for their really intelligent spy thrillers or spaghetti westerns to get buried and I am glad their work is surfacing now.  It is only too bad AIP can not release their original product to better advantage as most of it got sold to other studios but there are a lot of films still waiting around to find their audience today.  One that comes to mind is ""A Bullet for Pretty Boy"" (1973) starring Fabian as Pretty Boy Floyd and Jocelyn Lane.  The end result would probably be much better for the public.  Here Sweden brings this film to Region 2 in both Italian and English with Swedish subtitles in widescreen.  I zoomed the image and lost most of the nagging subtitles and really enjoyed the film and will many times.  In Eastmancolor and Widescope.  With a gallery of movie posters featuring the different title incarnations, lobby cards and articles.",1336348800,,1569,4.831460674157303
