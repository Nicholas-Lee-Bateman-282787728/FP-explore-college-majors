8266309,4,B0017KZWPK,"A glorious b/w movie from the 1940's! Nothing ground-breaking, just another joyous trip down memory lane...a trip to a time when movies were fun, entertaining...not full of cursing, not loaded with gore and dismemberment...rather, full of smiles and good will. A wonderful film from the golden age of Hollywood!",1210723200,2,311,5.36734693877551
