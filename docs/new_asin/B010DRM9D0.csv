7309096,5,B010DRM9D0,"This is my favorite film of all time. I have seen it several times through the years, and it brings honor and hope to the human race. It is inspiring beyond words. It is said that good company makes for good habits. This film personifies that ideal. This movie is a keeper that you'll want to see many times over.",1472342400,,313,4.233333333333333
7309097,5,B010DRM9D0,"Fantastic film, even after a few views.  Can you change people by the sheer strength of your character?  Sidney Poitier teaches us the meaning of integrity.  It's true, you have to teach your kinds by example, but this movie helps.  I love the part where the kids go to the museum.  Art can motivate kids.",1462320000,,305,4.472727272727273
7309098,5,B010DRM9D0,"Remember Blackboard Jungle (1955) with Glen Ford and Sidney Poitier? From a novel by Evan Hunter, it was about an inner-city school teacher that had to deal with resistance from unruly students and an uncaring faculty.

Now in To Sir, with Love (1967), Sidney Poitier becomes the teacher in a film based on a similar novel by E.R. Braithwaite. This time he is an engineer-trainee teacher that had to deal with resistance from unruly students from the slums and ineffective faculty.

There are several reasons this movie stands out even today. Sidney did an outstanding job in playing Mark Thackeray; you can really believe and empathies with his character. Most of the supporting actors are or became stars in their own right. The theme song To Sir With Love -Lyrics by Don Black, was sung by Lulu.

7309099,2,B010DRM9D0,The movie itself is one of the best of all time.  This format (Australia version) however does NOT play sound on two different Blu-Ray players I have except for the trailer and menu.  Perhaps there are firmware upgrades that would correct this issue... I will investigate.  The notes in the product description DO say it will play in Region A/1 (I am in the US).  Is this not accurate?,1499212800,,385,4.536231884057971

8722136,3,B010DRM9D0,"To Sir, With Love, 1966 film

It begins with scenes of London. A double-decker bus carries passengers, who talk about personal topics. [Realistic?] A man reads the sign for the North Quay Secondary School, London Docks. It is a three-story red brick building. The man looks for the principal, hes a new teacher, this is his first appointment. Hes from British Guyana and spent years in the States. He was an engineering major. There is no corporal punishment in this school. Students dance in school. Most of these students are rejects from other schools. One boy has a toy doll; he defines weights. Another teacher offers advice to Mark about the students. One male teacher says the students need a good hiding. Who sawed off the leg on a table? One student hates his father.

Some students act up in class. Thackeray berates the girls on proper behavior for a decent woman. Next he tells them to act as adults and be courteous. Will they obey? Are these students rebellious? Can they change society? Can they visit a museum? Will this class trip be approved? Thackeray advises the students on working hard for a goal. They leave on the class trip to the museum. Will there be another? One day a student has to baby-sit an infant. Mark is like them, but hes not. He tells them about preparing a salad. Mark meets some of the parents at a market. The boys exercise in gym class. There is a problem and a conflict! Mark lectures the boys on self-discipline when they are angry. Should Potts apologize? One boy is late, his Mum is dead.

The students get forms to fill out for National Health Insurance. They collect money for flowers for a funeral. One student doesnt obey her mother, who is divorced. Mark gets a letter that makes him happy (a job offer). Mark talks to Miss Dale about staying out late. All families have problems, people make mistakes. Mark takes over the PT class. One student challenges Mark to a boxing match. Marks stomach punch ends it, and impresses the other boys. Marks delivers the flowers and finds his students there. Later Mark attends a dance for the students; there is live music from three musicians. Pamela dances with Mark. Mark will move on to an engineering job.

This is taken from the novel by E. R. Braithwaite. You can compare it to The Blackboard Jungle by Evan Hunter. The London Docks area was heavily bombed during the Blitz, it contained defense industries. People lived within walking distance of their jobs. This was filmed on location in the East End of London and at Pinewood Studios in London. I wonder if things there are different today?",1522627200,,2590,4.660831509846827
8722137,5,B010DRM9D0,"Probably one of the first movies i saw as a teen,wow , a black man teaching in London. It really opened my mind up to a lot of possibilities. Later in life I got to visit London. I credit this film with my interest. Anyway when i saw it available on blu-ray i had to add it to my collection for the freedom to see it again anytime i want anywhere. Amazon has been a real game changer.",1519257600,,384,3.9358974358974357

8722139,3,B010DRM9D0,this is really a good movie The story is great but the sound track is terrible. I like what they are doing making the older movies available on blu ray but they do nothing for the sound track. You will like this movie but as I said the sound track leaves a lot to be desired.,1516492800,,275,3.9285714285714284
