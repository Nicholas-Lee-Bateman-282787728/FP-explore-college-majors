8149222,3,B000J4QWL8,"The animation today, seems to be more popular with younger viewers from networks like Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. That is true to the bone from cartoons like Spongebob Squarepants, and Fairly Odd Parents. Sometimes, those classic days from Hanna-Barbera and Warner Brothers seems to be a thing of the past. That is definitely the case with the Looney Tunes. Although there have been definitive and well-driven reflection of classics and compilations from Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and company from the well-conjured Golden Collections volume 1-4, there also have been those lesser-made collections that really miss out from the Spotlight Collections. Now, all of the budget ones have been put together again.

The Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volumes 1-4 is a compilation of the budget collections that were released for those who couldn't afford the more expensive and comprehensive Golden Collections going back to 2003. These editions still shine in highlighting a lot of great cartoons and classics from the classic Kill The Wabbit masterpiece of Chuck Jones' What's Opera Doc?, the Oscar-winning Speedy Gonzales, Swallow The Leader, Pizzacto Pussycat, One Froggy Evening, Cat Feud, and many other great cartoon classics. The one collection though that does stand out well among the others is the Movie Collection Volume 3. That edition really is the one that separates itself well from the others by showing classic Looney Tunes movies The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie, and Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie 1001 Rabbit Tales.

Although the Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection 1-4 is a welcoming reintroduction of the classics from Warner Borthers termite terrace days, the 4-pack really isn't worth much for die hard Looney Tunes fans, apart from the Movie Collection edition alone. Instead, I really recommend you buy the Golden Collections 1, 2, 3, and the upcoming volume 4. There is much more fun, with a whole lot more looniness. That's All Folks!
