A young boy and a girl call for help, they are treed by a longhorn cow. [A long shot for a stunt double? Longhorn cattle can be as dangerous as a buffalo.] Has Rob grown up yet? Rob takes the girl home and is told about a barn dance. Rob takes Marge there. Three men arrive, one picks a fight with Rob, other men join in! Those three men arrive at Marges home to see her father. They make themselves at home there. Marge is introduced to Uncle Bill and her cousins. There is a conflict over manners. Rob plans to get engaged with Marge. Her father Joe asks Marge to tell Rob to stay away while his relatives are present.

Joe orders Rob away with his rifle! Can Rob help find his Dads missing cattle? Should he take his revolver? Not this time. Out on the range a man shoots Robs father when he finds his stolen cattle. Rob and the Sheriff visit Joes ranch. The Sheriff asks to borrow a rifle. Who used it today? Can the bullet from the victim be matched to the rifle? Marge gathers eggs from the baled hay in the barn. Then she and her brother ride away in their wagon. When the horses run away Rob catches the horses but the team separates from the wagon! The wagon crashes. Robs hired hands are fired by Bill, who borrows Robs wagon and supplies.

Marge and brother Bud tell Rob what really happened. Bill threatens Joe about informing the state of Kansas. Marge overhears her cousins talk. Can they stop her from talking? Bud relays a message from Rob, and is sent back with a request from Marge. Her relatives want to take Marge to town, but Rob arrives to get Marge first. One of them catches Rob but is knocked out. The Sheriffs posse gets him. Rob continues his pursuit of the other brother. There is a fight, the Sheriff arrives. There will be a happy ending for Marge and Rob now.

Overall this is a good story but the plot has problems. If they haven't been in contact for ten years how did Bill find Joe? The story of Robs maturing is a plus. The lack of shooting makes this unusual for this Western. Were they on a low budget? Bob Steele showed his athletic abilities. It is rare for George Hayes (from Buffalo NY) to play an outlaw.",1507852800,,2176,4.261501210653753
8319087,4,B001LNOLVE,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""BRAND OF HATE"" (2 November 1934) (61 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Bob Steele was an American actor --- He was born Robert Adrian Bradbury in 1907 in Portland, Oregon, into a vaudeville family --- Bob's career began to take off for good in 1927, when he was hired by production company Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Westerns. Bob--who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO--soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their ""Billy the Kid"" series)

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, that ""new medium"" television had many hours to fill and few dollars to fill them --- They re-discovered the B-Western, still a popular mainstay of Saturday afternoon matinees and many cowboy stars thrilled a new audience --- Taking advantage of this rebirth in popularity, publishers brought to the marketplace comic books featuring these western heroes of ""Bob Steele"" Westerns --- These bimonthly issues were copyrighted in February and April of 1950 by Fawcet Publications --- His career which included nearly 200 feature films, serials and TV appearances --- Steele in his twilight years at the age 59 when he got the part of the cantankerous ""Trooper Duffy"", in the western comedy series ""F Troop"" (1965), who at the drop of a hat would give his rendition of fighting ""shoulder to shoulder with Davy Crockett at the Alamo"" --- Steele retired from the screen in 1973 --- Bob's long career, spanning more than 50 years came to an end in 1988 when he passed away.

Lewis D. Collins  - Director
Jack Natteford  - Screenwriter
William C. Thompson  - Cinematographer
