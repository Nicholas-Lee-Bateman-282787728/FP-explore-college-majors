4081577,1,B0037ODT7W,Its a good series but my copie doesnt have the episodes go in order which is initating. I couldn't watch ther whole series.,1358035200,,123,4.391304347826087
4081578,4,B0037ODT7W,All in all I love the show! Season 1 was an eye opener for me as I had previously come across this show on YouTube and after watching a few short episodes became very interested. I have to say the characters and storylines are all very realistic with just the right amount of drama and humor to keep you entertained..this was the case for me anyway. I'm a fan of independent film work so yes..in agreement with other viewers..the camera work was somewhat off and the acting a little in the beginner's stage for most of the crew BUT that didn't derail me from jumping on the Lovers and Friends Show train! I loved the show..loved season 1..as soon as I finished it I purchased season 2 and....it keeps getting better! Now I'm anxiously waiting for my order of season 3 and with rumors of a season 4 in the works?? Can't wait!!,1297555200,,825,4.398692810457517
4081579,3,B0037ODT7W,"THe filming of the first show was not good but the story line was good. By the third show, the camera work was better. Several individuals viewed the film and all of us agreed that we want to see the second season.",1291075200,6,214,4.119047619047619
4081580,1,B0037ODT7W,"To be honest this is the first Black Lesbian Series I've ever seen. I thought the video footage was terrible it gave me a migraine, The majority of the actors were beginners which they could not act at all. The story lines were ok but I would not waste my money with this one.  There is a Season 2 maybe that one will be better than this one.",1289088000,7,342,4.029411764705882

8390651,3,B0037ODT7W,"Not as riveting as I thought it would be.  Had a tough time staying focused on it after the first episode or two. Thought it would be very similar to ""The L Word""  My bad. Bought 3 seasons at the same time before I knew what I was getting myself into.",1423699200,,251,3.9019607843137254
