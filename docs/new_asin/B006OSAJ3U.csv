8502182,5,B006OSAJ3U,"A wonderfully inspiring and moving documentary for anyone who loves music -- or for that matter -- anyone who has a passion for anything in life.

It introduces us to a superbly gifted piano teacher -- a larger than life personality and unforgettable character -- beloved by all her students -- but none who love her more than her amazing husband.  Trying to avoid a spoiler, I'll just say that a cruel twist of fate sends her on a powerfully challenging journey -- and it's impossible not to cheer her on.

The film is well-made, has beautiful music throughout and it's hard to imagine any viewer who would not be left feeling uplifted and inspired.",1489190400,,650,4.6347826086956525
8502183,5,B006OSAJ3U,"I absolutely love this movie. This is a story of a piano teacher, who, despite going through the grief of losing her left hand's function, continues to be a fun and inspiring teacher. Her love and spirit for the piano not only touched her students's heart, but also everyone else who knew her story. She is truly an amazing teacher!",1378080000,,332,4.55
8502184,5,B006OSAJ3U,"I saw the trailer on Youtube and was intrigued. Having started playing piano at a far later age than most, I was looking for inspiration from someone who had a setback and still was able to play the piano. This little docu-drama about Irgrid Clarfield surprised me in a pleasant way. It's about a nationally known piano teach who had a stroke, which took away the dexterity of her left hand. You keep rooting for her, through sheer force of will, to make that left hand work again. You will want to watch this movie to see the amazing way in which she overcame this adverse circumstance",1373932800,,586,4.485981308411215
