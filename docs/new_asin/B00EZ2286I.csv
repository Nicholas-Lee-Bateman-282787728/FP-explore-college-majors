5957778,5,B00EZ2286I,GREAT ANIME!!!!! story is just gripping the characters progress well love that it gives a little back story how they got in the predicament  they are in but the ending leaves much to be desired i just felt like i was left hanging...so the short people get taken but on a island and are given bombs to throw at one another  lol but there is much more to it than that i just don't want to spoil anything read the description the bluray gives trust me if you are a fan of anime you will like this one don't miss out  now i just hope for a SEASON 2,1386720000,3,544,3.9724770642201834
5957779,5,B00EZ2286I,"I already seen a bunch of stories about this, a game that becomes a real deal, then the people involved have to survided at all cost, and i have to say that this one got me interested in a big way, not because of the story, no, it is both protagnist that get my attention, for certain moments you can sense the fear in their expressions, the designs of the characters fit so well in the story, by the end of the 4 chapter aprox. you will be so attached to both of them, that will want to watch the complete series to know what's gonna happen to them.

You will not regret it.",1379116800,8,575,4.043859649122807
5957780,5,B00EZ2286I,"I watched this show this summer, as I was watching, i noticed the absolutely amazing soundtrack and characters, which i think were the main points, but there were flaws, the most of which that made me disappointed, is that there is no second season. By all means, there should be a second season, the end of the final episode was not conclusive enough for me, I presume that this is going to be released in dub to increase sales for a next season, so please, buy this along with me :)",1379116800,8,484,4.329670329670329
5957781,4,B00EZ2286I,"I watched this on crunchy roll.

Basically imagine your favourite game being turned into reality by some insane corporation.

The lead character plays this online game that uses different kinds of bombs to kill other players to win then game.  There are timed bombs and homing bombs and others too.  There is also a love story as well involving the main character and a women he met online.
There is a lot of action as you would expect and twists and turns.  This dvd/blu-ray will be part 1 or season one as it is only 12 episodes and the story doesnt finish in 12 episodes.

It is a well drawn and thought out anime.  Only time will tell how good the voice acting is as I watched it in Japanese with subs!",1378425600,12,706,4.303030303030303

5957784,5,B00EZ2286I,Clear picture and great resolution. This is the best way to view the anime. One a personal note I found the anime great filled with action and a good character background stories that had interesting depth to them. Over all I'd say this is worth a watch however do be warned that this is an incomplete anime series meaning it got discontinued. However the manga did finish so that's cool if you like that.,1441411200,,405,4.486486486486487
5957785,4,B00EZ2286I,The voiceover acting isn't the best in this series but the story is great. the only good voices in this series is the 2 main characters. other than that the other characters voices are terrible the worst ever.,1440201600,,209,4.526315789473684

5957793,5,B00EZ2286I,"I was quite surprised with Btoom, this was a hidden gem definitely worth ordering! So here we have a series about a group of people dropped on an island and they are expected to collect 8 ""chips"" in order to get off. Our protagonist wakes to find himself alone with a ""chip"" on his hand and a pouch full of bombs. He realizes that this situation reminds him of a game that he plays online, except the only difference is he is playing for real! This is a great action packed series, although probably not for kids. There are plenty of dark themes and plenty of blood and gore, so I suppose take that for what it is worth. Overall, the art is great and english dub was enjoyable as well, the score could have used some work though. I would say if you are into online gaming this series should pique your interest, also if you are into survival stories this should be right up your alley. Overall this story is not extremely complex, but if you can just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride this will be a title worth every penny. Oh by the way, don't expect a wrap up to this series, they leave us hanging open for another season (which I really hope they make).

5957796,5,B00EZ2286I,"Btoom is a great anime.  Great art, great music, and a very nice story line.  In this anime people are forced to play a game similar to Battle Royal called Btoom.  Btoom is a game, part Bomberman, part COD, with some World of Warcraft thrown in as well.
This is worth your time and money, don't let this anime pass you by.",1396224000,3,322,4.161290322580645

Has a Cliff Hanger Ending
There is a lot of sadistic behavior including torture, mutilation, rape imagery (these concept not cons for me just so you know).

Pros:
Great Animation
Interesting story (similar to Lost + Hunger Games)
Good Action

Overall this is a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  I think Psycho-Pass and Death Note are 5 out of 5.",1395532800,7,342,4.483870967741935

5957800,5,B00EZ2286I,"Honestly that says it all, what more could you ask for in an anime?

I'm reviewing this based off of the Japanese sub that was released on Crunchyroll. I have not watched the english dub yet, so I cannot speak as to how well it fits with the original content. However, that not-withstanding, the action sequences are solid, the animation is great and each character is unique and compelling in their own way (whether you love them or hate them). I'm not going to review much of the plot (mostly because I hate spoilers and partially because I think somebody else has already done that in one of the other comments), but the only thing I felt was forced was the reasoning as to why these people were all sent to this island to battle it out in the first place. I was never completely satisfied by the explanation that they gave, it just seemed rather weak to me. Anyway, other than that I think it's phenomenal and definitely a must see, if not a must buy.

Some others have complained about the ending. It is fairly obvious to me that they were trying to set up for a second season, whether or not this will actually occur is still up for debate. I find it rather unlikely that this anime will receive a second season unfortunately. While I personally think it's awesome, the fact is the manga/anime hasn't sold very well in Japan. Whether this is because it flew under the radar and not many people knew about it, or that it just wasn't well received I don't know. However, from what I hear the anime had already caught up to the manga when it was released, so it could also be that they are just waiting for more time to pass before they continue with it. Only time will tell unfortunately. That being said, picking up a copy of your own and bolstering its sales here in America/Canada wouldn't hurt.

Since I haven't revealed much of the plot I'll tell you that if you like animes that focus around MMORPGs like Sword Art Online and .Hack, or ones that verge on the more sadistic side like Death Note and Miria Nikki, you won't be disappointed with Btooom! The show marries both genres rather well by taking the MMORPG into reality and showing the carnage of people fighting one another with various forms of explosives. Take the time to check it out, you won't regret it!",1388534400,,2275,4.45083932853717
5957801,4,B00EZ2286I,"Btooom! is one of many recent animes that follows the concept that a video game is real.  The main character is a N.E.E.T. (Not seeking Employment Education or Training) and is somewhat vicious to his mothers requests to get a job or join the outside world.  On the internet game Btooom he is a god, and is not incentivized to live any other existence.

He soon awakens on an island with a bag of bombs, and quickly learns that people have been gathered to play the game for real.  The deaths are gruesome, characters diverse, strategies compelling, game rules intelligent (much like Death Note/Gantz), and the plot unfolds like a proximity mine, igniting new bursts of information upon the characters approach.

The fan service and T&A with the main female character is a little gratuitous and repetitive, but is necessary to develop her anti male complex.  Players are so two faced that any relationship is hard won, and the show carries a tone like a mix between, ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Survivor"" with bombs.

This series does need a sequel or second season.  I almost gave it three stars, because the ending is incomplete.  While some anime can get away with dues ex machina endings where they claim poetic tragedy or erect an artistic obelisk of theory, Btooom cannot get away with it and doesn't try.  They clearly leave everything open for season 2.  If it doesn't come, this show should sink to three stars for a great premise and execution that amounted to a meager ending with little satisfaction.

All in all, it's not the greatest, but definitely one of the worthwhile hard hitters that deserves the attention and the buck, because it BADLY needs a second season.  Help 'em out.",1387670400,,1692,4.733788395904437
8610541,4,B00EZ2286I,"Kind of sick but in a good way--

What would you do if you were trapped in a video game?  What would you do if your reality became your video game, and that your ability to live was less an ability to live and more an ability to choose not to die-- but that the choice might depend on your staying sane in a world that was insane?

There are levels of choice in this story, and they let you think about your choices and behaviors on a daily basis, and to let you look at your life ""from the outside"" to see if you were trapped, or if you could beat the game-- the game of real life.  It was well done, but it also lacked the resolution to the story, and implied that we were trapped in our lives.  As such it is dirty, nasty, and a tiny glimmer of light from the hope within your heart.

Not for kids or even most adults, this one has a really gritty subtext and fails to finish the story in any direction.",1527552000,,906,3.9505494505494507
8610542,4,B00EZ2286I,This is a review of the show itself as I have only seen it online. I liked the show but it ends on a cliffhanger. It looks like there were plans for a second season but it never happened. Because of that and that there are only 12 episodes I recommend you watch the show online first.,1509840000,,284,4.0

8610545,5,B00EZ2286I,"I went into Btooom! just on a whim. I had seen it floating around the internet for a while and decided to give it a chance. I dig cheesy violent animes anyway. The first few episodes you're like ""well this is alright"", but then you get really invested in it and the characters. Some of the voice acting is a little cheesy, but I love that kind of thing.

Basically this anime is like Battle Royale, meets Sword Art Online, or Overlord. You start to care about the main characters as time goes on, and want them to succeed and get out of the game they're forced to play.

It's sad the season ends only about 1/4th of the way through the manga. They want to make a second season, and have released a mobile game for smartphones in Asia. The creators stated that if they get the game into the top 5 sold in Asia on mobile devices, they would be able to finance a second season.

I personally would LOVE a second season, a third, etc. If you finish the anime, I definitely recommend reading/continuing with the manga! Lots of new characters are introduced, and so much more background is added.

Support the manga and games to get a second season!!",1490313600,,1144,4.356807511737089

8610547,3,B00EZ2286I,"This is a good anime.  The villains are villainous, the good guys are conflicted, its well done and entertaining and almost completely pointless.  This anime gets you into the characters, makes you like them or hate them depending, develops them into the fun and compelling narrative then totally betrays the viewer by having literally zero ending.  The main protagonist, who, prior to going to the island, is amongst the worst human beings imaginable develops over the course of the series into a man worthy of praise and then full stop ""to be continued"".  Fast forward 5 years later and still no season 2.  Buyer be very weary of this anime.",1489363200,,643,4.8090909090909095

Unfortunately, this anime leaves the viewer hanging.  The primary characters are left stranded as it appears a rescue attempt will be made but a season two never materialized.",1477785600,,382,4.588235294117647
8610550,3,B00EZ2286I,"*Contains Spoilers* This is a decent anime and a good watch for people who are looking for something similar to Hungers Games meets Sword Art Online. However this is certainly more of an adult anime than SAO. Btoom is set on an island where a group of people (20-30) are placed into a game were they must kill other opponents in order to escape the island. The main male character, Ryota is a 22 yr old unemployed guy who lives with his mother and plays an online video game, aptly named Btoom, similar to what happens on the island. Players are given various types of bombs and told to kill at least 7 other players to collect their chips and leave the island. Each player has a chip embedded in their hand and you need 8 total to leave.

The story is pretty straightforward and doesnt leave many, if any, questions at the end of the show. While it does end with a bit of a cliffhanger, it was one of those optimistic endings that left you feeling assured for the future of the characters and didn't really detract from the show overall. The dub was decent, nothing great but not terrible. The art style is excellent and reminded me a lot of Death Note where the characters are drawn with shadows around them or their features to highlight mood. The show does a great job of pulling you in and keeping your attention. The last 4 episodes were by far my favorite, very action packed and engaging.

Now, I feel the need to tell you this anime has at least one rape scene, one sexual assault/attempted rape, and several traumatic episodes involving the main female characters anxiety with rape. Episodes 2-5 are difficult to watch and while you don't see penetration, its clear rape went on. I didn't see this mentioned in any other reviews so I wanted to let people know so you can be prepared. Apart from that, understand this is a violent adult anime. It deals with murderers, rape, suicide, anger issues, and even the main male character can be hard to relate to at times due to his violent streak. In other words, this isn't for kids.

I'm giving it 3 stars simply because I found the rape scenes disturbing and honestly unnecessary for the show. The female characters entire personality is based on rape-trauma and you never really learn anything else about her. Making her into a bada** gamer girl would've been just fine.",1472428800,3,2327,4.535714285714286
