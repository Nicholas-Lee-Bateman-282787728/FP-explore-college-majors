3081105,4,B00127SO4E,A very good production of the Bears' Super Bowl Year. It provides some insight into the relationships of various team members including Jim McMahon and Mike Ditka. The commentary by Mike Singletary is also very good. You will enjoy many of the scenes from that great Super Bowl year.,1283644800,4,283,4.795918367346939

3081107,5,B00127SO4E,"I have been shopping on Amazon for years and this is the 1st review I have written. Reason why? I love this DVD on the 85 Bears and would recommend it to anyone who would listen. The extras were almost as good as the body of the video. If you are a football geek like I am, you'll love this DVD.",1274486400,9,295,3.8524590163934427
3081108,5,B00127SO4E,"Not much of a football fan myself (although I'll watch a good rivalry), but darn if I didn't catch myself watching the top 20 Countdown of the America's Game series a couple years back (the back stories and personality profiles are great).

NFL Network counted down the top 20 Super Bowl teams, and the 1985 Chicago Bears was rated #2. Out of the 20 I watched, I'd rank this DVD as #1 in the series (I'd also rank the 85 Bears first). NFL Films does great work, and this DVD shows `em at their best-great music, great video, and the shot (and music) of Walter Payton sitting on the bench by himself with his head in his hands at his last game will tug on your heartstrings!

I'd recommend watching this DVD first, then getting your hands on the Pure Payton DVD (DVD is available only in the book Payton).

Both are highly recommended, even if you aren't a football fan-my 75-year-old mom couldn't care less about football, and she loved it!

If you know someone who's a football and/or Bears fan, this would make a great Christmas gift.",1227225600,23,1036,4.465608465608466

It covers the complete season, but two things were missing: video of the ""Super Bowl Shuffle"" and a copy of the complete super bowl game where they beat the Patriots.  Other than that it shows a classic team, the best ever, I think on defense, but when McMahon was healthy, they also had an outstanding offense with Walter Payton, Willie Galt, and the rest of the characters.

3081195,5,B00127SO4E,This was purchased as a gift for an even bigger bears fan than myself. Just barely though. Chicagoans are justifiably proud of that team three hall of famers on the field and a hall of famer as Da-coach. If it weren't for a fluke touchdown and FG in the first quarter of the SB they would have had three shut-outs in a row on their way to the championship.,1393459200,,356,4.173913043478261

3081197,4,B00127SO4E,"This video tries to capture the magic of the 1985 Chicago Bears--who won the Super Bowl after just a one loss season (to the Miami Dolphins). Three voices tell the story--Coach Mike Ditka, middle linebacker Mike Singletary, and quarterback Jim McMahon.

The video begins with a quick look at the Bears before 1985, noting the arrival of Ditka a handful of years earlier and the accumulation of a talented core of players (and sometimes eccentric). A substory is the tension between two fiery coaches--Ditka and defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan. The video notes the contributions of a number of players, from Singletary and McMahon to Walter Payton. Then, the story of the ""Frig""--William Perry.

The narrative gives a sense of how the season progressed and the development of Ryan's aggressive defense. There was fire in the team. Ditka was quoted as saying: ""I was insane; we were all insane."" One anecdote. The previous year, the 49ers piut the Bears away, adding insult to injury by using offensive lineman Guy McIntyre as a blocking back. When the Bears met the 49ers in 1985, the legend of the 'Frig began, as he played running back briefly. And, as the season continued, he played running back here and there--culminating in a rushing touchdown in the Super Bowl.

Then, the story of the playoffs. Back-to-back shutouts of the Giants and the Rams. Finally, the blowout of the New England Patriots.

A nicely done video, but some things did bother me. There was really no discussion of the structure of the 46 defense (in fact, I don't recall a mention of the defense using the term 46). Limiting the view of the Bears to three voices seemed a bit constraining on the narrative in my view. No mention of the ""Super Bowl Shuffle"" (I know, it wasn't a big deal--but, somehow, that captured the ""karma"" of the team).

Nonetheless, a lot of fun for a Chicago Bears fan!!",1388102400,5,1871,4.798136645962733

Don't bother.  Would rather have the 1985 Houston Oilers highlights than this.",1327363200,,252,4.25531914893617
3315734,5,B00127SO4E,"What a magical season.  The ""fridge"", the ""punky QB"", ""Sweetnes,"" the ""barking defense"", Da Coach are all part of this wonderful team.  The video captures the feeling of that special season.  Probably the greatest team and greatest season is all highlighted here.  I highly recommend this video, especially to bears fans young and old.",1301702400,3,335,5.148148148148148
