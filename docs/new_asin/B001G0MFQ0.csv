3593994,5,B001G0MFQ0,Don Johnson does a superb Job in this set in San Francisco series. Rather than killing a couple of dozen people like so many Hollywood cop shows. They seem to know that Circumstantial evidence is usually better than direct (eye witness testimony) evidence. Johnson plays a person with real flaws.,1380672000,,296,4.94

Other than that, this series got better than the first two. The storylines were great, the plots also and Don & Cheech jelled well. This is one of my favorite shows!",1372377600,,310,4.081967213114754

3594001,5,B001G0MFQ0,"Just would love to know what happened to this series.  I know Don Johnson settled his suit with the studio and they should release the dvd for the remaining series.  Why so long?  Man, we as the public sure do get dumped on when it comes to releasing these shows. They just tease us with only a few seasons and then cut it off.  They release all other shows but not the ones that people write about all the time.  Wish I knew someone in the business.  Can't wait for the additional seasons, maybe they will be released before I grow old and gray!!!!!!!",1344470400,,552,4.259615384615385

3594003,5,B001G0MFQ0,I've watched all three seasons so far - waiting for the rest to become available.  I didn't watch it when it was on TV - thought I would give it a try - it's a GREAT show with great storylines and love the 'Cuda!! - you need to watch them in order.,1316995200,,248,3.769230769230769

3594005,5,B001G0MFQ0,"Nash Bridges was one of my favorite shows of the 70's.  Thanx for bringing back the good ole days, and hope you will continue to bring back more of the same.  Can't wait till number 4 arrives.  Television today; for the most part; stinks.",1300924800,,238,4.363636363636363
3594006,5,B001G0MFQ0,"We were glad to get this 3rd season of Nash Bridges from Amazon.  this show was funny.  I personally enjoyed watching Jodi Lynn O'Keefe grow up on this show before starting her career.  The price was reasonable, and the delivery was fast.",1295222400,,238,4.619047619047619
3594007,5,B001G0MFQ0,"Dear Amazon, My wife and I extremely satisfied with your first class operation and business. I feel safe with buying on line with you people. Every disc I have received from you has worked perfectly. I have all of the Hawaii Five O except season 11 and 12. I'm still waiting for Police Woman seasons to be released.

3594008,5,B001G0MFQ0,"Wish they would release the rest of the seasons. It seems to be a problem with a lot of other TV series. Still waiting for ""Walker Season 8"" (what's up this one, seeing even the Final Season was released over 2 yrs. ago?), ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air Season 6"", ""Starsky & Hutch Season 5"", ""George Lopez Season 3"", plus, etc. Wonder what's happening why the rest of these shows are not being released on DVD? Nash Bridges is one of my favorites, just like the others I mentioned above, but it's really frustrating if you start to buy the seasons that are available without realizing the the rest may never come out. I call it a major """"rip-off"" by the DVD industry. Being very, very careful about what buying from now - after all, it's my money they're taking. The last season of ""The Shield"" was out in no time at all - why can't they do the same with other shows? I know there are contracts. permits, etc. involved, but please - give the buyer a warning if they have to wait around for years to complete their collections. Who knows - they might not be around then!",1286064000,7,1064,4.325
3594009,5,B001G0MFQ0,I love every season of this show!  Don Johnson and Cheech Marin have wonderful chemistry that continues through this season.,1283817600,3,124,5.2

3594011,5,B001G0MFQ0,I always loved Nash Bridges and I keep watching the dvds of the first 3 seasons and now I can't wait to buy the rest! Hope CBS will issue 4th 5th and 6th very soon!!!,1273104000,3,166,3.7714285714285714
3594012,5,B001G0MFQ0,"I real love ""Nash Bridges"". It make me laugh. I remember that movie in tv show when I very young by long ago. I still love that movie. I so happy that set on DVD. I so happy brought that. I notice that movie not finish make dvd (Nash Bridges 4 to ?). I had movie ""Nash Bridges"" 1,2,3 Season. But I can't wait more buy it 4 to ? Season. Hehe! Thanks! God bless you!",1269561600,,364,3.8026315789473686
3594013,4,B001G0MFQ0,3 YEARS and counting. Where are the rest of the seasons? This gets old with so many shows putting out either partial series or partial seasons. The music issue is annoying enough...the reason I don't own WKRP. Time to finish the series...you have influence.,1266105600,,257,4.863636363636363
3594014,4,B001G0MFQ0,"I got these dvds for my son for Christmas he was very happy.  He remembers watch Nash as
a kid and was impressed by the show and the Cuda car. I think the show is very cheesy but
he was happy to get it. The price is high.",1265846400,,221,3.6041666666666665

3594016,5,B001G0MFQ0,"I don't remember the songs that are not in the show, But Don Johnson is the coolest. I wish season 4 would come out faster, it is like Miami Vice a season a year, it took that long, but i guess the best is worth the wait.",1262044800,,221,3.723404255319149
3594017,3,B001G0MFQ0,"Ok let me be clear about this....I love this series. It dominated my Friday nights from 1996-2001. BUT, this is not what I remembered and we should get a price break on it; however; this is to RATE the item. And, I HATE rating it like I do, cause I loved this series.

So, here goes...

If I were to rate it based on the action & storylines I remember--I'd be 5 stars.

If I were to rate it based on the lack of the music or music changes from the original CBS airings--It'd be NO STARS.

Now, I am usually an easy-going person. But, when I want the COMPLETE SERIES or the COMPLETE SEASON, I want it complete & unaltered. That is not what I got. One episode for example--REVELATIONS; is a mess. One of my most favorite episodes of this season and truthfully, the ""new"" ending really sucks.

At the end as Nash was driving away in the 'Cuda, you heard Van Morrison's ""Into The Mystic"". I know because I had to call the production office to find the name of the song.

Alas, it was replaced by something else and less meaningful. Same as the episode ""Sacraments""--the song at the end (in the original airing) was Eric Clapton's ""My Father's Eyes""; again replaced with something less meaningful and to me, degrades the series and what it accomplished. I haven't seen the entire season, but I would bet most of the really great music has been altered. That is what made this series what it was at times--the music.

If I were not so dedicated to the series, and didn't want to waste my time recording it on DVR and transferring it to my own DVDS, I would stop ordering future seasons. I am half tempted to do so.....BUT...I asked for it on DVD and as my mother said ""be careful what you wish for"" as well as ""having a thing isn't so pleasing as wanting""....so I will have to deal with it. I would encourage people who remember the series for what it was to contact Paramount and voice your displeasure, as I intend to do. I thought seasons 1 & 2 were ""over-sights"", clearly it is not.

The good things? The packaging is still good--plastic case designed to hold multiple discs, a real space-saving design. The item arrived in great shape and when promised. But don't expect any special features.

Overall, I will give it 3 stars; though I hope CBS can quit *crewing up a good thing. If it's the money deal, I would pay more for what I want & remember as opposed to cheap for cheap :)",1261958400,19,2379,4.34009009009009
