8096997,5,B000CC45VQ,I love this so much. I is very inspiring!,1501632000,,41,3.6666666666666665
8096998,5,B000CC45VQ,"This is one of my all-time favorites. A delightful and moving look into the lives of car artists. We get a sense of their work, and, more importantly, an intimate glimpse of the sincere passion that drives them to do what they do. Mr. Blank's film is a classic of the outsider artist genre. Don't miss it!",1499990400,,305,4.368421052631579
8096999,5,B000CC45VQ,"I am a philosophy professor at Randolph College in Virginia.  Every spring I teach a course entitled Philosophy of Art, in which students study the views of philosophers throughout history about the nature of art.  After studying a bunch of theories from Plato onward, we get into less traditional art of the 20th and 21st centuries.  In this section of the course I show Harrod Blank's film ""Wild Wheels.""  I am amazed that after 18 straight years of showing this film to undergraduate students, it never fails to engage them.  No other film I have shown has had this kind of staying power  even really good films will typically hold students interest for a few years but eventually get dated or go stale, but not Wild Wheels.  Further, with all the vignettes Mr. Blank weaves together in the film, students can see examples of just about every philosophical theory studied in the course (and they have a hell of good time doing it!).  Of course, part of the appeal comes from the special nature of art cars, but the range of personal voices, ideas, and approaches found in ""Wild Wheels"" makes it (and keeps it) engaging and fun.",1412035200,,1130,4.671717171717172
8097000,4,B000CC45VQ,"I only recently saw this movie despite being near Art Cars for a number of years. (My daughters have worked on a couple of Minneapolis Art Cars.) It's a little bit dated now, with many of these cars no longer out there and several new generations of Art Cars and Mutant Vehicles having been made since the movie came out. Still, it's a great introduction to the Art Car and to the naive art impulses that lead to them.",1217376000,,418,4.30379746835443
8097001,4,B000CC45VQ,"This is a must-see for all who appreciate north American folk/naive/outsider art in general or art cars in particular.  Director Harrod Blank captures in depth the experience of traveling the Unites States and meeting the artists who, like himself, are strangely driven to decorate their automobiles.  This beautifully filmed documentary brings together professional artists and complete outsiders, the shy and reserved and the extroverted and (perhaps even) crazy alike, united by their passion for bizarre, quirky, driveable art and the interest, curiosity and excitement their masterworks inspire while rolling down the interstate or just going grocery shopping.",1138665600,,665,5.845360824742268
8097002,3,B000CC45VQ,"I had seen the Wild Wheels video at an artcar event in Arkansas last year but wanted the DVD too. There is a lot more here & the addition of The Directors Cut and Extras added a lot. The new music was fun to listen to & the quality was excellent. My favorite was the Button Man from North Carolina. A super DVD set & I recommend it to all. (My review should show 5 stars)

8097003,5,B000CC45VQ,"I happened to catch this wonderful film on PBS in the 1990s, and by the time it was over, I knew I would have my own art car someday!  I think it just doesn't occur to most people (me included, until I saw the film) that it's possible and permissible to alter the appearance of your car beyond a mere bumper sticker or pair of fuzzy dice.  Wild Wheels is not only about the cars themselves, but about the colorful characters who've chosen to elevate their particular cars from commodity to artwork.  I still chuckle every time I see the scene in which a car salesman talks about how people choose their cars to reflect their individual personalities -- and meanwhile, the camera pans over a long line of shiny new autos that all look exactly alike.  Har!  Even if you don't end up making an art car of your own, as I finally did, this film will inspire you to step outside the mundane, and to look at cars and life a little differently.  I'm very glad to see that it has finally been published on DVD!  The extra footage, director's commentary, etc. is excellent.  And there's even a second disk containing the shortened, profanity-free version that I saw on PBS, so it's suitable for showing in school classrooms, etc.  The film itself is a real work of art!  But if you're a friend or relative of mine, don't bother buying it, because you'll be receiving a copy as a gift on your next birthday...",1138060800,6,1398,4.42578125
8097004,5,B000CC45VQ,"I am the filmmaker so of course I am biased, I think this DVD is great!  This DVD has a year of additional work in it, including extra footage, Spanish Subtitles and my director's commentary both in English and Spanish which was really tough to do!  There's also two slide shows, one on art cars including ones that do not appear in the film, and a selection of images of the crew when making and exhibiting the film.  In addition there are two disks, one being the educational PBS broadcast version of the film and the other the director's cut plus all the extras.  Hope you enjoy it.  Thanks and ride on!
