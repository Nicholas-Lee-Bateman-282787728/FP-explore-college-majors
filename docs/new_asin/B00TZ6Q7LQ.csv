8703477,3,B00TZ6Q7LQ,"I bought this movie for my daughter, who loves Jeremy Sumpter..Jeremy Sumpter is NOT in this movie, but it says he is. How did this happen? Plus, it's dubbed (very badly) in English because it's a Norwegian film. Falsely advertised and disappointed. My daughter still liked the story, but I am upset because what I bought was not what I was told I was getting.",1483056000,,360,4.553846153846154
8703478,4,B00TZ6Q7LQ,"Good kids pirate movie.  Some of the plot is a little hard to follow.  I was hoping for more ""extras"" on the video, like an alternate language track (!), or background or production clips.",1473897600,,188,4.5
8703479,4,B00TZ6Q7LQ,A fun little movie that owes practically everything to The Pirates of the Caribbean.  Silly at times and it makes you wonder just where the action is supposed to be taking place since what I took to be Turks looked more like Englishmen in powdered wigs.,1459641600,,253,4.5
