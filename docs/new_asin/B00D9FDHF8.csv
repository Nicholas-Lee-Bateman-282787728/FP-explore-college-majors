If you want to learn how to sing harmony in bluegrass, this is a great way to deepen your understanding and ability to do it.  I bought copies for all the women in my band and we are going to work our way through the songs developing three-part harmony on each one.  Maybe even four!  I found out about this dvd this summer at NashCamp, a bluegrass jam camp in Nashville, where Bill Evans was one of the outstanding teachers.  He's the BEST!
