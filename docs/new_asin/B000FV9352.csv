8127067,4,B000FV9352,"The ultimate skateboarding video for those who love San Francisco.  Great location shots.  I'm a fan of Peralta's ""Animal Chin"" Bones Brigade video that shows the crew skateboarding on the streets of San Francisco.  This video does not have a silly narrative thread through it, but it does capture skateboarding on the hills of San Francisco in a more extreme way: the hills are steeper.  The steeper hills though are only skated on for a short time since their momentum picks up very quickly.  It has some great tricks and photography.  I thought some of the photography was cinematic in that it followed some of the skaters long distances.  I bought mine here in Albuquerque, NM, in the 4D skate shop on Coors, by Paseo del Norte.",1225324800,,732,4.716535433070866
