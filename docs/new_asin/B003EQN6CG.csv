8395581,2,B003EQN6CG,"This product is the History Channel's ""Engineering an Empire: Egypt"" television show repackaged with a different name. It's a good historical look at building technology in Ancient Egypt and has great CGI to accompany the explanations, but it's not new content. I'd buy the Engineering an Empire episode off of iTunes instead and save $10 or more.",1286755200,4,347,5.105263157894737
