Perhaps my style is either too low brow or extremely literal (I like non fiction, medical & science stuff), but for me, this was akin to the Monday night improv jazz jam sessions at the club. Some people really get into their own stuff (hit or miss), someone assesses the crowd and throws a standard out (ok, ok, robots, guy saves girl). This wasn't bad, but I'm not yearning for more either. I'd prefer more MTV's liquid television.",1530921600,,549,4.612244897959184

7331991,5,B011BSQ3RS,"Anime Classic finally available and its on Blu-Ray! 9 shorts some are real hits and gems. 2 or 3 misses.

The ""Cloud"" segment is the weakest one because it barely qualifies as animation. Its a nice student film but it just doesn't compare to the other segments in the film.

""Franken's Gears"" is a good segment but runs too long. It drags

""Presence""  has THE best animation in the film. But the story is depressing and has a messed up message. The lead character is a unsympathetic whiny selfish cuck. The fashion on the Robot doll is really dated. Otherwise its okay.

""Deprive"" is a fun video game esque action adventure. No dialog.

""Starlight Angel"" is a real fun segment. Real Good

""Strange Tales of Meiji Machine Culture: Westerner's Invasion"" is one of the funniest and best segments. MUST WATCH in Original Japanese with subtitles.

""Chicken Man and Red Neck"" is a fun decent ""Night on Bald mountain"" with robots story.

The Opening and Ending segments are also the best and most fun of the batch. Probably because they were done by Katsuhiro Otomo of Akira fame.",1526601600,,1073,4.695187165775401

I'm not sure why someone would write a review for a product they haven't even seen, but these are the times we live in. The Streamline dub is here in all its glory, including its (ahem) ""problematic"" Japanese accented dialogue in one choice segment. God bless Discotek for preserving anime history.

In case this is news, Robot Carnival is a stunning collection of anime from the golden era, back when it was VHS rental night and you were at the Blockbuster picking out which STATE OF THE ART JAPANESE ANIMATION you were going to enjoy next. A must-own.",1524441600,5,668,4.700854700854701
7331995,5,B011BSQ3RS,"Loved it as a kid and it reminded me that I still do!

My only problem was the way it was delivered.  FOUND IT IN THE BUSHES IN THE FRONT YARD.  Had to search for it for a few minutes after being notified it was delivered.  NOT COOL.",1524355200,,233,3.7916666666666665
7331996,5,B011BSQ3RS,"Wow.  This is better than the official Bandai DVD release many years ago.  Hard to believe, but true.  And that version was color corrected, used all the original footage, and had options for both Japanese and English dialogue audio tracks.  It also came along with a booklet by the various animators and directors who commented on their work.

I first saw a home video VHS release about a year after the film had hit the theatres, and thought at that time that was the best anyone would get in home video short of going to the theatre, but this 2K bluray presentation is outstanding.  It is in fact a reconstructed print complete with titles that were redone, and with English credits for us non-Japanese heathens.

I saw this when I was in college, and I'm sorry it took so long to get a really excellent copy to the mass media home video market, because the film really is one of the great works of anime.  As per the producer's comment in the documentary this is an anthology, and anthologies are hard for some people (probably most, I'm guessing) to take, but if you're wanting to experience Japanese animation (anime), then you could do worse than to rent or buy a copy of this very wonderful film.

The image is super sharp, and I'm seeing details in this film I've never noticed before, and I've seen this film time and again since it was first released on home video way back in the 80s.  Seeing this bluray is like seeing this film for the first time ever all over again.  It's really that spectacular.

Please do yourself a favor and give this film a look.  You won't regret it.",1522281600,17,1589,4.475694444444445
7331997,5,B011BSQ3RS,"Not really sure why there are three versions of this movie, as any fan who saw it when it first came out would naturally prefer the restored original, not the pointlessly rearranged version from Streamline (which contains an amusing, but pointless homage to Laser Disc).

7332000,5,B011BSQ3RS,"I haven't opened it yet. I'm curious to see how different it is from the first 1993 Sci-Fy Channel broadcast. A lot of people, including myself, taped the debut tv broadcast on vhs and really only had that to watch it over. The official vhs, laserdisk and cd soundtrackback prints from back then were very hard to get and copies were very minimal. The first Sci-Fi Channel anime marathon help this film get discovered and gain popularity. Update: I opened it and watched it. It's definitely the original source passed from analog to digital dvd, not a recut edited version with enhancement. It seems like an uncensored version from the TV broadcast. There's a disturbing bit in the ""Presence"" short that was not shown on tv, which was a wise move. The scene is a bit disturbing.

It's a region-free DVD, which should tip you off, and then when you get it into your drive the encoding playback looks just awful.  Lots of pixelation of once smooth round edges, and the sound is canned.

The official Robot Carnival website hosted in Japan got taken down only a couple of years after the film hit the DVD market, so there's no way to confirm as to the validty of this version.  And to my knowledge there is no better version than the original release, which is no longer in print.

7332027,5,B011BSQ3RS,"You can find my full review here: http://www.fandompost.com/2015/12/15/robot-carnival-anime-dvd-review/ but here's a few points from it:

Audio:
The audio came in loudly and quite clear in Dolby Stereo 2.0 in both Japanese and English. No distortions occurred during playback of either track.

Video:
The picture is bright and hues are nicely saturated for most of the movie except the closing segment, which started to pixelate a bit for some reason.

Menu:
Theres dark mechanical imagery used as a backdrop. The carnival is small and is positioned in the upper right corner. The title masthead takes up the upper half / left corner of the screen. Text based playback options take up the lower half of the initial menu screen.

Extras:
The only extras present are a text section by Mike Toole entitled Automata Saturnalia with a lot of background info on the movie, as well as the English trailer for the film.

In Summary:
I wasn't into the last couple segments as much as I was into the others, but the great thing about anthology titles is that theres likely a style for everyone who takes the collection in at some point. For many years, Ive held on to my Streamline Pictures VHS tape and would hope Sci-Fi Channel would run this movie again someday just to experience it at any time. Im very glad Robot Carnival has made it to R1 DVD and Discotek Media has done a good job with its presentation. I definitely recommend it for purchase at your first availability.",1450742400,,1468,4.786561264822135

This is a must see for and Anime fan. Great music and animation from some of the best Japan has to offer.

First time Ive ever seen it in its original play order and with the credits restored.

This is all so the first copy that Ive seen correctly formatted. Previous releases (VHS, imports, bootleg, ect) would be Pan-scan 4x3 or widescreen with black bars in a 4x3 format.

The bad news.
Not Blu Ray (hey we waited long enough that it would have been nice if they found the original film and made a remastered Blu Ray transfer)
Not remastered, so there is a lot of visual noise many scenes.

That said, this is one of the great anime classics and I think those of us who have waited decades for this release will be mostly willing to overlook those issues.

The color is faded and muted. The script for the English-dubbed version of ""A Tale of Two Robots"" is slightly different from the original Japanese version and even adds a few lines that are not present in the original version. In addition, a passing reference to Japan's 1854 opening to foreign trade is removed and the foreign antagonist's English dialogue is re-recorded. Some have criticized Streamline's dubbing of the Japanese characters as being stereotypical and racist, but this is absolutely absurd.

7332035,5,B011BSQ3RS,"Robot Carnival is an 1980's anthology anime built around Robots. Nine of Japan's top animators of the day were given the task of creating an animated short using the idea of robots. The opening and closing segments are directed by Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira, Steamboy) and bookend seven stories that vary in tone and subject matter. The film sometimes gets compared to Fantasia because the segments are set to music (only 2 actually feature dialogue) while other viewers draw comparison's to Heavy Metal because both are animated anthologies showcasing various directors.

Robot Carnival was for many anime fans their entry into the world of Japanese animation. It was originally released by Streamline pictures on VHS in the late 80s, given an English dub produced by the polarizing Carl Macek and showed regularly on the Sci-Fi network (now SyFy) when they did a block of anime programming. The streamline version restructured the segments in a different order than the original theatrical release. After tv airing the film went quietly out of print for some time.

Discotek Media has smartly reissued this fantastic film. First, the packaging is gorgeous. The DVD come in a glossy slipcase. A clear DVD case houses double sided artwork and the disc. The film itself is presented in the original Japanese theatrical order and offers both Japanese with English subtitles as well as the original English dub. The ending segment has thankfully been restored to its full length (it was horribly edited by Streamline). The video quality looks fine although the titles looks a little grainy which may be a product of when the film was made. I also suspect the aspect ratio of the film may have been altered however I cannot confirm this suspicion.

There are 9 segments in total each dealing with themes.

1. Opening- a third world desert village hears a robot carnival is coming.. And takes cover!
2. Franken Gear's - semi retelling of Frankenstein.
3. Deprive - A guy comes to rescue his girl but must battle an army of robots.
4. Presence - a young inventor creates a beautiful girl but overreacts when she developed feelings for him.
5. Star Light Angel - a trip to a theme park turns interesting when a young girl is whisked off to battle with a giant mecha.
6. Cloud - an artful piece as an android walks through experiences.
7. A tale of Two Robots - the 2nd segment with dialogue. A funny bad dub in Meiji Era Japan between two wooden mecha.
8. Nightmare - a salaryman rides his moped through a terrifying night in Tokyo.
9. Ending - the robot Carnival comes to a close as the last ballerina dances.

Robot Carnival is an easy recommendation. The extras are few - a trailer for the film and a nice essay in the film's history leaving to accompany the film. The star here is the film itself which is great to have back in my collection after many years.",1442102400,27,2852,4.741935483870968
8724048,5,B011BSQ3RS,"I first saw this on cartoon network and it was because of the success of this and vampire hunter D that we now have Toonami and Adult Swim. This was cartoon network first time getting into adult animation and if it wasn't for this we would never have gotten cowboy bebop, Trigun, Gundam Wing, DBZ and so many more classics that I fell in love with.

I digress on the nitpicking of the story arcs, it's hard to make a coherent short animation, and BTW the animation looks way good; there's enough stuff to keep you entertained while watching, as it really is a grab bag of different ideas. Definitely 7/10 eyecandy, but there are some shorts that feel like they were shoehorned in. At 90 minutes it's easy enough to sit through, and the multiple unconnected stories makes fast forwarding very rewarding.
Highlights:
*A robot(?) who LARPs as Bat from FOTNS
