4989263,5,B006H9WKJW,"It's hard to classify a film like Bronx Paradise, and that's mainly because you have not seen anything like it. Throughout the film, we follow its protagonist, Wayne as he tears through the streets of the Bronx in a frantic attempt to leave his old criminal life behind. In his quest, he'll fight with cabbies, insult convenience store clerks, verbally abuse traffic agents, choke wanna-be thugs and hood-rats, spend some quality time with hookers all the while dodging the local mobsters, both big and small. The film's wonderful cast of colorful characters add a level of realism and help round out the overall movie. Beneath its tough exterior, Bronx Paradise also tells a tale of a loving father wanting the best for his family. The film will hit you with an unrelenting left, followed by a right and then goes for the knock-out, never letting you recover until the end credits start rolling. You'll laugh, but if you dare shed a tear, Wayne will personally come to your house and kick your ass for being a wuss. As if that wasn't enough, Bronx Paradise also threatens to wildly entertain...a lethal combo. Save yourself the humiliation, see this movie today. Prime entertainment!!!",1326067200,2,1186,4.9054726368159205

4989267,5,B006H9WKJW,"Bronx Paradise is an excellent movie on so many levels.  There's a reason why it won so many awards.  The acting is excellent, direction, screenplay, etc.  Wayne is brilliant - period.  What's really amazing about this movie is you could easily think it's about growing up in the Bronx and all, but there is so much more depth to this movie that you might not even realize it the first time you watch it - a lot of sub themes, symbolism, etc.  Besides being intense, there's a lot of humor which is hard thing to blend - also the sign of a great movie.

This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a LONG time - you won't be disappointed - get it.",1325980800,3,656,4.166666666666667

8498243,5,B006H9WKJW,"What's so often refreshing about independent features is that there is no filter. We get the vision of the filmmaker with complete candor, setting aside any political correctness to allow us to view the film to be seen as intended. Granted, that might leave in parts that could have easily been left out, but in the end, it is more representative of life. There are no ACE's in life to only leave in what makes you look better.

Bronx Paradise introduces us to Wayne Gurman, a gutsy triple threat serving as writer, co-director and leading man. The film is an autobiographical character study of a man who set aside a potential career in boxing when he was drawn into the seamier side of the Bronx's crime scene. As an independent cocaine dealer, he develops a local following but finds himself in the cross-hairs of Frankie Sunshine, an already established mob figure, whose territory he's encroached.

The language is raw in Bronx Paradise, raw as the Bronx streets themselves, with many scenes so realistically acted that the film often resembles documentary or reality TV footage. But Gurman and co-director William Lappe aren't just interested in raw realism. Their artistic tendencies (both are obviously students of film) take Bronx Paradise into a second level by injecting tense mob drama reminiscent of early Martin Scorcese and  humorous fantasy sequences that recall early Woody Allen. But in the end, the real standout Gurman himself. As a leading man the thuggishly handsome Gurman is a burly package of pent up rage that you can't take your eyes off. His brazen charisma demands that he be followed.

Bronx Paradise is not for the easily offended. The characters express open bigotry and are relentlessly profane with subjects like the stupidity and the contradictions of racism coming to the forefront. One telling debate is when Wayne (whose wife is Black) and his friend Johhny (John Palumbo) argue about why it's okay for a White Man to sleep with a Black woman with the reverse being unacceptable. Johnny expresses total disgust in Blacks but then goes on to pursue and sexually harrass an attractive Black woman that passes them. Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Muslims, Italians, Gay, etc. all get an equal lashing in this film. The movie is an equal opportunity offender.

Bronx Paradise will be a challenge for some to watch. But if you are open to seeing the true grit on the streets of the legendary borough, you will laugh at its candor, be shocked at its violence and twists, and find that you have been thoroughly entertained.",1476316800,,2548,4.916279069767442
