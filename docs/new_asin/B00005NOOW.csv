7947564,4,B00005NOOW,"We've seen the premise for this movie hundreds of times before, in fact it wasn't that long ago I watched another budget DVD called Echo that also starred a Melrose Place actor with Jack Wagner playing an evil twin who wants the life of his brother who doesn't even know he exists.  Alone With A Stranger of course has William R. Moses playing the twins.  One has a family and has built a successful company that has been turning down offers to sell it for 18 million dollars. The other having been raised in a violent and poor household by substance abusing parent has spent most of his life in and out of jail.  Going through his deceased mother's possessions, he learns he had a brother.  Life was unfair to him, now he's going to take over his brother's life.  Moses does a good job playing the two vastly different personalities.

There's a little bit of poor writing in parts, such as a character leaves something behind so returns to somewhere they weren't expected to be at anymore so one of the twins has to deal with them, is used twice with different characters.  Surely something different could have happened the second time.  The ending is also fairly weak.  We also have a character of Viktor who was introduced but we never see him again after that.  They could have done something interesting with him.",1476576000,,1319,4.574468085106383

7947567,4,B00005NOOW,This is a great movie. William Moses is great as the 'good' twin - 'evil twin'. I always enjoy his movies and this is no exception.,1366675200,,131,4.076923076923077
7947568,3,B00005NOOW,"William R. Moses' career started on the soap opera FALCON CREST and he's usually playing the nice guy roles.  This time around he gets to play both the nice guy and the villain in this derivative, but fairly engaging, little independent thriller.  Moses plays James Kensington, an upscale business owner, with the perfect wife and son.  Little does he know he has a twin brother who is quite the opposite and has hatched a scam with brother's secretary (a lovely if somewhat overwrought Nia Peeples) to abscond with his fortune and his wife.  Moses the bad has little hesitancy in bumping off anyone who stands in his way.  The inevitable climax involving the wife's decision on which twin is her husband is handled nicely, and a happy ending is predictably guaranteed.

The performances are decent, with brief appearances from Priscilla Barnes and Mindy Cohn.  Scotty Cox is a cute little David, who finds out daddy (not his real one, though) likes to use garbage disposals as a blackmail device.

You could do a lot worse...and better.  It's your choice.",1104796800,6,1056,4.854748603351955
7947569,5,B00005NOOW,Alone with a Stranger is one of the best independant films I've seen in a long time.  The story line was great and the actors did an amazing job with the film.  I was hooked from the very beginning.  If you are a William R. Moses fan this is the film to watch.  He is so amazing playing Max/James.  Nia also does an amazing job.  I recommend this for those who don't mind watching a movie with a lot of not so nice words.,1006905600,4,421,3.9523809523809526
