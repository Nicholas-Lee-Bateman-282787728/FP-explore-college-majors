Very nice to just have playing in the background. I do agree that it would be nice to know the names of the things shown, but that would also distract from the picture.",1345680000,,304,4.258620689655173

The visual impact of Visions of the Sea is awesome. Watch it and keep it in your DVD library.",1302912000,,290,4.918367346938775
