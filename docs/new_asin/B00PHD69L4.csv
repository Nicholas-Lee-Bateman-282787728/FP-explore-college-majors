8687894,5,B00PHD69L4,Brought back fond memories of riding in the back of Grandma's giant Ford Country Squire Wagon.  Facing all the places we just pasted never seeing where we were headed.  Waving at all the drivers following us.  Pretty sure there is gonna be a wagon in my near future.,1518739200,,266,4.5

8687897,4,B00PHD69L4,When station wagons are phased out of production film school filmmakers go out and make an 'Ode to Station Wagons' film about the history of station wagons and their current proud owners. Insightful. Explains that they really came into their own with the creation of the Interstate system and the ability for family travel.  When the gas crunch occurred the wagons had to be retired. Includes advertisements and car shows..,1480982400,,423,5.042857142857143
8687898,5,B00PHD69L4,"This is a 60 minute video that has English subtitles. There is scene select and a series of bonus deleted scenes that are extensions of ones included in the main body. A word from the directors is also included.

It is interesting for several factors. It tells the story of one of the icons of the American car industry- one of which, those of us of a certain age, most likely rode in, if not had one owned by our family.  The station wagon was, and still is a car ignored by most car aficionados and it has been lost to time  no longer made, replaced by vans and SUVS.

The video really conveys the passion that the people who are involved with and who collect these cars have for station wagons. It is fun for those who owned and rode in them to see again and for anyone who enjoys automobiles to watch.",1443398400,2,805,4.207792207792208
8687899,5,B00PHD69L4,"I bought this documentary because I like offbeat films like this one and it did not disappoint.  Not a station wagon fan, but I recall the one we had when I was a kid and that was enough reason to watch this short show (about 45 minutes) about the car(s) and the fans of them.  I enjoyed it, as did my teenager, so that's a keeper!",1422316800,2,331,4.0
