3659094,4,B001JQHT26,"The Brothers Grimm wrote many of the tales which later became favourites all over the world.  Collected here are four classic entries from Faerie Tale Theatre based on the original Grimm stories.

HANSEL AND GRETEL:
Young Hansel and Gretel (Rick Schroder and Bridgette Andersen) are abandoned in the forest by their cruel stepmother (Joan Collins). The children happen across a magical cottage entirely made of gingerbread and sweets, which is owned by an evil witch...  Joan Collins plays the dual-roles of the stepmother and the witch.

LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD:
Mary (Mary Steenburgen) lives with her parents (John Vernon and Diane Ladd) in the middle of the forest where her father works as a woodcutter. Her only friend is her absent-minded Grandmother (Frances Bay) and she yearns for the adventure and exitement she has only ever read in fairytales.  When she strays from the path to Granny's house, she happens across a Cockney Wolf (Malcolm McDowell). Should she trust this magical new 'friend' or run while she still can?...

RAPUNZEL:
Shelley Duvall, creator and producer of the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series, takes centre stage in the lead role of RAPUNZEL, one of the best entries in the series.  Gena Rowlands is deliciously evil as the jealous old witch who takes the young girl from her parents and imprisons her in an impossibly tall tower in the middle of an enchanted forest.  Jeff Bridges is great as the dashing Prince who charms Rapunzel and plans to elope with her, until the Witch uncovers their deceptions...

RUMPELSTILTSKIN:
The Miller (Paul Dooley) is constantly telling tall tales, but his latest lie just might result in the death of his daughter (Shelley Duvall). When the Miller tells the King (Ned Beatty) that his daughter can spin straw into gold, the King orders she be brought to the palace to work her miracle.  Imprisoned in the palace, the Miller's Daughter is visited upon by a strange little man (Herve Villechaize) who helps her out of her dilemma. But will the price be more than the Miller's Daughter is willing to pay?...

Wonderful costume and set designs cap off the many delights in this must-own family collection.",1244937600,,2159,4.9529085872576175
3659095,5,B001JQHT26,"I have already stated my grand opinion about this series in the review I posted for Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection. However, as the collection is an expensive item, this single disc installment represents a superb entry to any and all unfamiliar with the series who want to taste it or give as a gift. The thematic approach is brilliant and I high recommend it to everyone.",1230681600,6,387,4.705882352941177

8313441,5,B001JQHT26,Faerie Tales are not only for the young.  Shelley Duvall's FT Theatre's are fun and relaxing to watch.  Some might be a little scary for a very young child.  I'm hooked!,1484438400,,169,4.387096774193548

8313447,5,B001JQHT26,"Though Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre is available as a complete collection, the thematic DVD sets are also well-done. This particular DVD contains 4 adapted Brothers' Grimm tales:
- Hansel and Gretel which features Ricky Schroeder as Hansel, Bridgette Andersen as Gretel, and Joan Collins as both the wicked stepmother and witch.
- Rapunzel which features Gena Rowlands as the witch, Shelley Duvall as both Rapunzel and Rapunzel's mom, and Jeff Bridges as the prince and er, Rapunzel's dad.
- Rumpelstiltskin features Shelley Duvall as the girl/Queen, and Herve Villachaize ""the plane, the plane"" as Rumpelstiltskin, and
- Little Red Riding Hood which features Mary Steenburgen as LRRH, and Malcolm McDowell as the wolf.

The stories have a touch of humor in them and are well-acted by a talented ensemble cast. Highly recommended for the young and young at heart!",1247788800,11,871,5.2214285714285715
