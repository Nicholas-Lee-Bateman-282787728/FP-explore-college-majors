8180831,4,B000NQJP98,"If you family love adventure, with a bit philosophical irony raped through out both movies, than sit back and enjoy four hours of exciting adventure and some basic human instinct rear it's ugly face. ""The Emerald Forest"" is about a father who loses his son to an amazonian tribe while building a damn, a magnificent damn, taking ten years, in the rain forest. Of course having to destroy part of the rain forest, and encroach on tribal land while doing so. What happens to the son?, and what about the damn, is it completed or what?, does he ever see his son again?...Watch and enjoy!  ""Lord of the Flies"" is about a group of young boy's, from a military boarding school, finding themselves ship wrecked on an unknown island, with no surviving adult. What do you think happens?... basic human instinct kicks in... and with no wisdom their...it's survival of the fittest rules the day!  Irony...Irony....Irony!",1398902400,,909,4.82051282051282

The boy is raised by an Indian society and becomes part of it.  Many years later, the lost boy and father are reunited, but the boy's life is with the tribe and not with his father's alien world.  When in difficulty the boy asks for his father's help to save his tribe.  Afterwards,they both return to their respective worlds.

Lord of the Flies is about a bunch of military schoolboys whose plane crashes in the ocean and the wind up on a deserted island.  Over time, they revert back to savage ways in order to survive with dire consequences.

Reality sets in when they are eventually rescued.  Instead of the fantasy warriors they think they are, they realize that they are just a bunch of young boys.",1356998400,,831,4.456953642384106
8180834,5,B000NQJP98,"These are two great movies in one package, you can't go wrong.  I saw The Emerald Forest many years ago, I'm anxious to see it again.  Lord Of The Flies is underrated, a sad tale but very interesting nonetheless.  -kd5-",1342828800,,219,4.425
