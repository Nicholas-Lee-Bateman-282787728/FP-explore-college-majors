8138730,3,B000HD1PEA,"Meh. I was expecting them to talk to more people. They only profiled a few, and one of them was transgender. Film quality was pretty poor. Was disappointed because the subject matter is so interesting.",1474848000,,201,4.771428571428571
8138731,1,B000HD1PEA,Very simple video with little or no real information. I would have liked to see more medical information and there wasn't a really good operation shown.,1405296000,,152,4.884615384615385
8138732,4,B000HD1PEA,"There isn't much out in the big wide world about this particular subculture.  I wish the film was a little more in-depth, but as an introduction to a very interesting topic, it's good.  It follows a few guys, all interested in castration for differing reasons.  They're probably not who you expect.  I could have listened to a 2 hour film about any single one of them, though.  They're all interesting people, for sure.",1257206400,5,419,4.684931506849315
8138733,3,B000HD1PEA,"This is a film of interviews of various people involved in elective castration in the the USA: some eunuchs, licensed testicle removers, and unlicensed. I would have liked to have seen more of the operations and close-up shots of the scrotal area.

Good, but didn't delve deeply enough in the topic.",1177804800,5,299,4.862745098039215
