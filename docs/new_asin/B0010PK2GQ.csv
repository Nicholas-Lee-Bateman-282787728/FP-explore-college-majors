8238179,5,B0010PK2GQ,"As an entrepreneur, it was great to see Donald's insights on persistence and attitude for success in business, taped in this live-action studio interview.  As always, I have a lot of respect for Mr. Trump and he's a modern-day success story who sets high standards for his businesses and how he works with people.

Great job on this - highly recommended for all fellow entrepreneurs; biggest takeaway is getting his attitude, the strength for success in business, by staying smart, working hard and doing it all with quality.

Thanks, Donald - you continue to inspire me!
