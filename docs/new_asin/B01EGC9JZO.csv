8758579,5,B01EGC9JZO,"There are so many facets to this rich film that I don't dare highlight just one--the history, the cultural inquiry, the profiles of courageous people, the clothing, the food, the landscape, and of course most of all the music. You hear a wide range of Malian music, from folk to rock, all sharing certain chords and basic syncopated rhythms. The cuts are very fast-moving and leave you with a dreamlike impression of the events. Urban scenes seem to go especially fast. Getting the DVD is valuable because the director (whom I know) fills in some of the background that could not become part of the movie: where people came from, how and why certain shots were taken, the meaning of some mysterious goings-on, and how the movie fits together. (As the director says at one point, she could have shown a whole two-hour interview with one band and it would have been interesting.) The DVD also has an extra studio scene.",1474848000,6,917,4.701863354037267
