7983761,4,B00008G90K,"""Center of the Storm"" is a very interesting look at the work of Kofi Annan at the United Nations.  He is followed as he jets around the world to various meetings, his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, his visit to war-ravaged Afghanistan, and his participation in the independence ceremony of East Timor.  While the chief of the UN may get a lot of perks like free meals and riding around in limousines, it doesn't begin to compensate for the difficulty of the job.  The UN is not only struggling to bring battling factions together, it also is limited by the actions or inactions of various member nations, who then sometimes blame the United Nations for failures.  On top of that, some member nations, like the U.S., are withholding their dues and using its money as a club against harsh criticisms of its aggression in the world&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-We-Say-Goes-Conversations-on-U-S-Power-in-a-Changing-World/dp/0805086714/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What We Say Goes: Conversations on U.S. Power in a Changing World</a>.  The US also leads the world in vetoing resolutions on issues like the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the weaponization of space.  It seems the UN needs to find alternative sources of funding other than the richest nations, which often get their wealth by exploiting the civilized nations of the Global South that haven't invested in big military industrial complexes.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looting-Africa-The-Economics-of-Exploitation/dp/1842778110/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looting Africa: The Economics of Exploitation</a>
One thing the movie could've included more of is criticisms of the UN, both from right-wing warmongers like Hugh Hewitt, and from progressive people like Phylis Bennis&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Calling-the-Shots-How-Washington-Dominates-Today-s-UN/dp/1566563534/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Calling the Shots: How Washington Dominates Today's UN</a>.  Those criticisms not withstanding, the UN has accomplished a lot of good.

As important additions to a couple of the topics of ""Center of the Storm,"" I'd recommend the DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manufacturing-Consent-Noam-Chomsky-and-the-Media/dp/B00005Y726/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the Media</a>&nbsp;which features a segment on the suffering of the East Timorese, which the corporate media largely ignored.  Also, the DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sergio-Vieira-De-Mello-En-Route-to-Baghdad/dp/B000F6IHRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sergio Vieira De Mello - En Route to Baghdad</a>&nbsp;which is about the UN work of a close friend of Annan's, who died in an attack on the UN in Iraq shortly after the US invasion.  The attack was blamed on Iraqi insurgents, but given the US right-wings' hatred for the UN, and its record of dirty warfare, I wouldn't put the attack past some military element of the empire.

Hopefully, this film will inspire others to carry forward the goals of the United Nations, and its vision of Universal Human Rights.
