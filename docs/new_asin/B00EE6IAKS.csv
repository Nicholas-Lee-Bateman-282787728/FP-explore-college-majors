8604513,2,B00EE6IAKS,"This is a British produced, short documentary that was released in 1993 around the time of the film ""Jurassic Park"".
This would be considered more as a ""Bonus Feature"" on most video releases. It is in no way a comprehensive history of dinosaurs in Hollywood.
You will be very disappointed if that's what you were expecting from this.",1495756800,,333,4.758620689655173
8604514,3,B00EE6IAKS,"The program was made in 1993 as an episode of a series called ""Opening Shot.""  An educational program giving an overview of the development of special effects in motion pictures up until 1993.  I am a little disappointed that it just scratches the surface of the topic.  I could have it a higher rating if it were both longer in duration and more detailed.",1383264000,4,356,4.53125
