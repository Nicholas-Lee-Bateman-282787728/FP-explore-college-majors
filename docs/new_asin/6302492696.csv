8216574,5,6302492696,"Thomas Gets Bumped is another classic. The stories were superior and George Carlin did good on his second narration.

My all-time favorite story, Gordon & The Famous Visitor, is on here to. Percy is in this one alot, so Percy fans will love this. Here are the stories:

Thomas Gets Bumped 5/5:

After being late one too many times, Thomas tries his best to hurry with his morning train, but there is something Thomas doesn't know about. There is a bend in the tracks from the sun and Thomas can't use his branchline until it is repared, so Bertie will take his passengers temporarally. But Thomas is afraid that his passengers will like Bertie better.

Edward, Trevor & The Really Useful Party 5/5:

The Vicar is having a garden party to raise money for some seaside trips for the children, but the Vicar forgets to put up the posters and nobody will come to the party. Thanks to Edwards bright idea, the party will be saved. So find out how Edward and Trevor make this a really useful party indeed and see how Bertie learns a lesson he'll never forget.

Diesel Does It Again 4.5/5:

Sir Topham Hatt sends Diesel to the docks to help Duck and Percy and right from the start, Percy and Duck sense trouble. Sir Topham Hatt, who suspects nothing, gets mad and them and think they are preventing Diesel from doing his work. But Percy and Duck were right and Diesel does it again.

Gordon & The Famous Visitor 6/5:

A famous celebrity has come to the Island of Sodor and all the engines are happy and excited to talk to him. But the proud and arrogant Gordon wants nothing to do with the party. He thinks that he is the most famous engine in the world, and thats all there is to it! And Gordon shows all the engines that he is right, well, so he thinks.

Donald's Duck 4.5/5:

After teasing Duck by saying that he quacks, Donald's joke backfires on him and he ends up having a pet duck of his own.

Percy & The Signal 5/5:

Percy teases James one day and gets them both in trouble. The next day, James and Gordon get back at him by telling him about ""backing signals"" and when Percy comes to a signal that's arm moves up instead of down, he thinks it could be one of those backing signals.

Thomas, Percy & The Mail Train 4.5/5:

Every night, Percy and Thomas pull the mail train. But one night, there is a delay with the mail and Percy and Thomas are blamed for it. Now there's a bunch of talk about the mail train being scrapped but soon enough, something happens where the mail train is saved.

Again, a classic Thomas video. I think that in DONALD'S DUCK, Duck deserved the teases that Donald told him because he just wouldn't stop bragging about getting his very own branchline. Luckly, Donald gets him back at the end by putting an egg under his smoke box during the night. Anyway, buy this Thomas video to add to your collection today.",1100304000,4,2837,4.385496183206107
8216575,5,6302492696,"I always forget to watch this tape a lot even though it is really good. In Thomas Gets Bumped Thomas track is brocken and Bertie has to take the passengers home. In Edward,Trevor and the Really Useful Party Trevor is invited to a party where he gives children rides. In Diesel does it Again Diesel has to help Duck and Percy when there is too much work at the harbor. In Gordon and the Special Visitor an engine named City of Truro comes and Gordon tries to go as fast as him but he loses his dome. In Donald's Duck after Duck gets his own branch line he pays Donald back for making fun of him by putting a duck in his water tank.
In Percy and the Signal Gordon and James get back at Percy for making fun of them by tellin him there are backing signals. In Thomas, Percy and the Mail Train Thomas and Percy have to work extra hard to deliver mail because Henry was late.
This is a good tape and I recommend it.",1066435200,,910,4.089385474860335
8216576,5,6302492696,"This is one of the first George Carlin narrations and it's pretty good. Mavis is a feisty diesel at first but in the later tapes she is nice. In Trust Thomas James plays sick and Thomas gets in trouble doing his work. In Mavis Toby has problems with the new diesel. In Toby's Tightrope Mavis has to save Toby from falling of a bridge. In No Joke for James James gets in trouble when he lies to Gordon so he can pull coaches. In Percy's Promise Percy agrees to take Thomas's train but has to plunge though water to get them home. In Henry's Forest Henry helps to repair his forest after a storm. In The Trouble With Mud Gordon can't pull his train because he is too dirty.
Overall this is a good tape but it is not the best one.",1066003200,3,727,4.126760563380282
8216577,5,6302492696,"A Thomas fan once, a Thomas Fan for life--or that is how I feel about my son's favorite character. This collection of Thomas stories is great. A direct interpretation from the original stories, it brings the characters from the book alive. My son loves it. On a separate note, the live animation and lack of a lot of special effects is a refreshing change from a lot of the other kids movies out there. It lets kids' imagination to develop and that is why I think that my son watches this tape over and over and over....",983232000,3,520,4.371134020618556
