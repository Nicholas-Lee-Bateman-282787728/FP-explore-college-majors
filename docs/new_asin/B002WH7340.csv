4006862,5,B002WH7340,The chip is a great value.  I received my product very quickly.  Would do business with this person again.,1302048000,3,106,4.526315789473684
4006863,4,B002WH7340,"Great value compared to other song chips. Bought this for my sister-in-law. Most song chips have only 100-200 songs for the same price (Bought it for $54.98 with shipping). There are some repeat songs between the magic sing I also bought them and this chip, but not too many. Only issue I had was when installing it the arrow on the chip or in the instruction booklet was reverse. Your magic sing won't boot if the chip is reversed. I consider this a design flaw since you can insert the chip into the device backwards (hence the 4 stars). Otherwise this is worth it! I suggest reading the song list for details.",1294272000,13,612,4.473214285714286
4006864,1,B002WH7340,I wish to see of what are the songs in the chips before I buy them...it doesn't make sense if we buy the chip and we don't know of what are the songs inside the chip...,1405987200,,168,3.6944444444444446
4006865,5,B002WH7340,Terrific addition to our MagicMic. It's got terrific music. It was easy to load into the mic stand. It does take a few seconds to load each time you turn on the system to use it.,1397260800,,178,3.9722222222222223
4006866,5,B002WH7340,Didn't notice that my Magic sing came with this chip but it made a great gift for a close friend.  Fast delivery.,1396828800,,113,4.136363636363637
4006867,4,B002WH7340,This was a great addition and included many songs that were not in the original chip. This is a must-have!,1390780800,,106,4.35
4006868,3,B002WH7340,"Lots of duplicates with songs already in the system, and the numbers overlap. I like that there are a lot of songs on the chip.",1389052800,,127,4.12
4006869,3,B002WH7340,it's a lot of money for the amount of songs and a lot of the songs and groups I have never heard before,1388620800,,103,3.5217391304347827
4006870,5,B002WH7340,Terrific selection of songs to supplement the original songs that came with the MagicSing console. Some duplicates but the addition of this is well worth it.,1385942400,2,157,5.076923076923077
4006871,5,B002WH7340,Lot's of fun with good song selection. Disclaimer: My teens were in the late 90's so keep that in mind.,1383523200,2,103,4.2
4006872,3,B002WH7340,"got one ET Pop 705 Chip  very happy with my purchase, now I need to know if you have Spanish pop songs, perhaps a 700+ chip? o",1376352000,,126,3.6666666666666665
4006873,5,B002WH7340,"The chip has 700+ songs and it is awesome.  There is a website available to see the songs included in the chip, but I forgot the website.  But it is easily found in Google search.  Chip is worth the money.",1375747200,2,205,4.075
4006874,5,B002WH7340,If you like oldies this is perfect for you. Cannot get enough of all the songs I grew up with. I still remembered the words.,1370131200,2,124,4.0
4006875,4,B002WH7340,"This is a great mix of songs. Although, some of the songs repeat from the factory set. It was still worth it.",1368316800,,109,4.0
4006876,5,B002WH7340,"Excelente vendedor y producto, el envi fue rpido bien empacado y el producto corresponda a la descripcin del mismo, recomendable",1363478400,,128,5.45
4006877,5,B002WH7340,"I bought it as a present for a relative.  I only saw her use it once, and it worked fine.  but for some reason, she stopped singing altogether when i bought this.  wtf.  It has a good choice of songs tho",1362009600,,203,3.8780487804878048
4006878,5,B002WH7340,"My wife is from the Philippines, so karoke is the national pastime there. I got this for a x-mas present for her. She LOVED it.",1360972800,2,127,4.12
4006879,3,B002WH7340,This chip for our Magic Sing was as described. I wish there were not so many chips with the same songs on them.,1358380800,,111,3.869565217391304
4006880,5,B002WH7340,"Just can't stress enough the value of this chip. It's about 5 cents a song and more importantly, the songs are of the better quality. If you own the mic, you know, not all the songs are created equally. Some can sound downright corny and laughably bad while the same song on another chip can be very close to the original. These for the most part, are the later. So many favorites on this chip. Many times more than the 2000 songs that came with the mic (only a relatively few worthy or recognizable songs). Like I said, it's a MUST have for sure!",1358208000,5,547,4.269230769230769
4006881,1,B002WH7340,"THE BACKGROUND MUSIC DID NOT SOUND ANYTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL SONGS...IT WAS DONE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL  ONLY A FEW SONGS CAME WITH ACCOMPANIED LYRICS, WHICH ALSO SOUNDED VERY UNPROFESSIONAL",1356220800,,188,5.714285714285714
4006882,5,B002WH7340,"For the first time, since I bought the Karaoke, I sat all alone in my tv room and sang till my throat ached!!!!! This is much more than I expected!",1352764800,9,147,3.933333333333333
4006883,4,B002WH7340,"Great price fast shipping works well with my Entertech Et19k Magic Sing Mic Karaoke Machine!

8383055,3,B002WH7340,It's just okay.  The 705 songs has too many duplicated very old songs.  Not worth the price for me.  I had to return this chip for newer ones.,1420329600,,142,4.0
