4962591,5,B0066E6QXE,"Bought this set as I am a western fan. Not too many Jimmy Wakely films made it to the UK so this set helped me to appreciate him (or not!)
Film quality and sound were better than ancipated and, for me, it was a worthwhile buy.",1363737600,,226,3.9347826086956523

4962593,5,B0066E6QXE,"For an old cowboy buff, This is great entertainment.  So many of us baby boomers can appreciate these movies.  I will be purchasing many more.",1359936000,,142,4.64
4962594,5,B0066E6QXE,"This will be short. It helps if you were a Saturday matinee kid (theater or TV) when young, and these sagebrush heroes, their trusty sidekick(s) and guitars when needed, helped form moral values for at least a couple generations. Gawrsh...it's fun to be a 12 year kid again. If you're new to these oaters it helps to remind yourself that in the days before 500 TV channels, CGI and very little morality examples, kids AND adults enjoyed these simple morality tales and because most ""B"" western stars released about 8 films a year one was never too far off from their ""Hero"" fix. So...you either like these films or you don't...but if you're curious, the source material and transfer are SUPER! Those of us who know what we're getting will be delighted. Those new to the form will perhaps be pleasantly surprised. Golly...NO swearing, NO nudity, No sex...just good vs. evil and lots of noble (non-grey) heroes. One thing I can guarantee...THEY LOOK FANTASTIC! 'Nuff said.",1358380800,3,970,4.849397590361446
4962595,5,B0066E6QXE,"I just received my volume 1 Cowboy Collection. It is nice to get wonderful copies of these movies, movies I watched when I was a boy.

Please allow us to buy Red Ryder, The Three Mesquiteers, Bob Steele, The Durango Kid, Sunset Carson, Lash LaRue, Wild Bill Elliott, Range Busters, and Allan Lane. Please list the movies in each collection, so we know what we are getting. THANK YOU, AND KEEP THEM COMING!!! THANK YOU AMAZON!!!",1328659200,18,658,4.730434782608696
4962596,5,B0066E6QXE,"I am a bit surprised that no one has reviewed this three-disc DVD-R set of ""Monogram Westerns"" yet. During the late 1930s, the 1940s, into the early 1950s (before they switched over completely to Allied Artists), Monogram Pictures produced some of the better ""B"" or series Westerns, usually around one hour long each, and featuring such endearing big screen cowpokes as Tex Ritter, Jimmy Wakely, Whip Wilson, Johnny Mack Brown (after he left Universal), and the ""Rough Riders"" (Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, and Raymond Hatton, and later, Rex Bell).

This first edition--a second edition is also projected for early 2012 (with Whip Wilson and Rod Cameron)--includes four films featuring Jimmy Wakely (OKLAHOMA BLUES, PARTNERS OF THE SUNSET, COWBOY CAVALIER, and GUN LAW JUSTICE), four with the indomitable Johnny Mack Brown (OUTLAW GOLD, MAN FROM SONORA, OKLAHOMA JUSTICE, and TEXAS LAWMEN). The last entry is the longer, Cinecolor feature, CAVALRY SCOUT, starring the underrated Rod Cameron. The picture quality of all the films here listed is superb; Warner has given us excellent, sharp prints. CAVALRY SCOUT, shot in Technicolor's cheaper cousin, Cinecolor, is quite acceptable, not quite as vivid as it would have been in Technicolor, but certainly fine, given that so many Cinecolor films have faded beyond repair (or the Cinecolor prints have been lost).

These films are full of action, the genuine ""shoot'em up"" articles--the Wakelys include the requisite songs; Johnny Mack Brown, a very good actor and a former champion athlete, is never dull, but always exciting. Plots are straightforward, the ensemble casts are very good (and recognizable to those who recall them!), and good always triumphs in the end.

I've thoroughly enjoyed these little films--they bring back wonderful memories, but, more than that, they tell us something about ourselves, about how our nation viewed itself during the mid-20th century, and the influence of the frontier and the quest to become the United States. Recommended to old cowpokes (like me), but also to younger folks who want to experience the exhilaration, lyricism, and simplicity of a bygone age.",1328400000,24,2142,5.294117647058823
