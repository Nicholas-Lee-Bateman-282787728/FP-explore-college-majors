7763914,5,B01GKKXXG6,"This is the perfect yoga practice for me...gentle stretches, flowing moves, soothing instruction, beautiful scenery, tranquil music and flowing water.  For a relatively little amount of money and time commitment, you will feel energized, de-stressed, stronger and maybe even a little enlightened.  I am loving all of the newest set of Jessica Smith DVDs, and I hesitate to say that I have a favorite since the variety is so great they can't be compared.  But if you like yoga, or want to start yoga, or just want to calm down and focus, this DVD is perfection.",1468454400,18,560,4.8125
7763915,5,B01GKKXXG6,"This is the perfect gentle yoga DVD for me.  I love that the four segments are only 20 minutes long and that Jessica does not waste time with lengthy introductions, while at the same time presenting routines that are very calming and left me feeling wonderful.  The quality of this DVD is excellent, from Jessica's friendly demeanor, to the beautiful outdoor setting, to the music.  What sets this DVD apart from so many others is the professionalism.  Everything seems so well thought out, from the routines to the setting.  It can be overwhelming to choose a yoga routine to do at the end of stressful day, and I love that I have four wonderful options in this one DVD.",1468195200,8,671,4.605042016806722
7763916,5,B01GKKXXG6,"These are great short yoga practices! And I love that they are each only 20 minutes, as I don't always have time for a longer yoga session. Thank you, Jessica!",1468195200,,159,4.333333333333333
7763917,5,B01GKKXXG6,I love this practice and I am very grateful that I found it. I have been looking for gentle classes as these but haven't had much luck. I have a very bad back and love yoga. This DVD is a perfect fit. Thank you for such a miracle. I am looking forward for more gentle workouts,1468108800,,276,3.9464285714285716
7763918,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I admittedly am terrible at taking the time to incorporate yoga into my exercise routines but that mindset has changed after doing this DVD in its entirety!  As the title describes every flow is very gentle but oh so relaxing; you can opt for a focus on the neck and shoulders, back and chest, hips and knees or total body depending on what area needs attention.  Familiar yoga poses such as tree, modified cobra, triangle, warrior one, eagle, downward/upward dog and planks are all present and can be modified to suit any level.  The soothing music really helped me to become more mindful and I was surprised that I was able to ""let go"" and just enjoy the movements as I normally am dwelling on something or another.  In fact, the reason I decided to try this was because I suffer from depression and (too much information ahead) horrible PMS.  After dealing with extreme irritability and mood swings month after month I was a little desperate for anything that would provide relief.  And boy, this DVD did the trick!  I honestly am stunned at how much calmer I am and can't recommend Gentle Yoga highly enough!",1467849600,38,1112,4.642857142857143
7763919,5,B01GKKXXG6,"The DVD includes 4 different flows which focus on different body parts. As the title implies, this is a gentle workout. The set is great- bright and peaceful. The music sets the mood for relaxation. Jessica's instruction is clear, and she keeps us motivated. I love the modification suggestions, every move is doable.",1467849600,33,317,5.0
7763920,5,B01GKKXXG6,"First off, I cannot SING the praises of how I feel after completing this DVD from start to finish.

I am a small animal veterinarian, and spend the majority of my day, on my feet, lifting, squatting, bending and twisting, and hunching over a surgery table.  I also suffer from fibromyalgia, which affects mainly my neck, shoulders and lower back.  Many days, I come home feeling positively wasted, tense, sore, and grumpy.  While doing this workout, I could literally FEEL my stress and tension melting away, and the tightness in my joints and tendons releasing.  Upon completion, I feel enlightened, refreshed, and energized.  The ""No Pain, No Gain"" principle does not apply to this workout DVD.

As an avid Jessica Smith DVD and workout collector, and long time fan, I have purchased and done all of Jessica's previous workouts both on and off of DVD.  Last year, Jessica released the amazing ""Yoga Stretch For Beginners and Beyond"" which I loved, but I felt like something was missing.....this DVD has filled that void.

The single DVD comes in a hard shell case with artwork as pictured.  Running time is listed as approximately 82 minutes, and the DVD includes an introduction and four standalone routines (20 minutes each, give or take) that you can mix and match to your preferences at the menu screen.  There is also an option to play all the routines in order.  I have included a breakdown of each routine below.  Like the photo on the cover, this DVD is filmed outdoors in a GORGEOUS private setting, next to a pool with a waterfall.  The background is lush, and green, dotted with potted plants, candles, and two burning ""tiki"" torches.  The sound of the waterfall flowing into the pool is relaxing enough, but when combined with the gentle piano and instrumental music in the background, the stage is set for an amazing yoga workout.  As stated in the description, there is no chanting or Sanskrit methodology used.  This is also NO TIMER (for good reason, since during these practices it's important to focus and clear the mind).  Sadly, there is also NO PEANUT, although it's rumored she is in a few of the other newer Jessica Smith DVDs released along side this DVD.

Jessica is gorgeous as always, and is modestly dressed as pictured on the DVD cover, so there is no over exposed skin here!!  Her gentle cueing is ever present, as is her reminders to focus on breath, as well as attention to form.  Modifications are provided for beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, making this DVD great for anyone.  Equipment required for this routine are a yoga mat, and sturdy high back chair, which is used for some of the balance moves, as well as a few modifications.

Flow 1 ""Neck and Shoulders--For me, the BEST routine of the disc since I carry most of my tension in my neck and shoulders.  This routine incorporates a standing sequence starting with gentle inhales and exhales while raising the arms up and down into ""prayer"" pose, followed by a soothing facial massage.  Gentle neck work is followed by the most delicious stretches for the rotator cuffs.  The second half of this flow incorporates the use of a chair for modified planks, downward facing dog and cobra poses.  These poses can be performed WITHOUT the chair for a more advance option.

Flow 2 ""Back and Chest':  This mat only routine begins with a flowing sequence to open the chest and heart center.  This becomes the focus of this routine.  Jessica incorporates gentle forward and back extension moves to open up the chest and spine, followed by ""chair"" pose with optional side to side twisting.  The second half the routine is floor work and includes hip bridges to work the glues and lower back, topped off by a gentle modified cobra and relaxing cat and cow stretches.  Over all, this routine was great for releasing back tension.

Flow 3 ""Hips and Knees"":  My second favorite routine on the DVD, this segment incorporates a chair to help with balance, as you focus on opening up the hips and thighs, IT band, hip flexors, glutes, quadriceps muscles, knees, shins and Achilles tendons.  As a former runner, with a history of tight hamstrings and shin splints, this routine hit all the right places in the right ways.  Moves featured in this routine include modified lotus, tree pose, and royal dancer.  Also present are runners style stretches, topped off with an AMAZING massage and stretch for the feet.

Flow 4 ""Total Body"":  This final routine is the most ""yoga-like"" of all of the routines.  It begins with a flowing sequence of arm raises and forward bends to stretch the back and back of the knees, and transitioned to a standing warrior series and includes the moves you'd typically see in a yoga class (warrior, triangle, downward dog, pigeon etc.) but all done in a way that is gentle and soothing to the body without overtaxing your joints or limits of flexibility.  You have the option to use the chair to help with balance, as well as some of the more challenging poses like plank and downward facing dog.",1467244800,339,5007,4.747685185185185

7763922,5,B01GKKXXG6,"Most yoga videos are intimidating for the beginner, but not this one. The format and instructions were very easy to follow. Even the most novice can feel confident giving it a try.",1530576000,,180,4.65625
7763923,5,B01GKKXXG6,"This is my first time to try yoga. I have had back and neck stiffness and pain for several years.  After three weeks I have had significant improvement, less stiffness and more flexibility.  I will definitely keep this routine in my day.",1529712000,4,237,4.619047619047619

7763925,5,B01GKKXXG6,"Once again, another winner with Jessica Smith.  Didn't even realize it was her dvd.  I had just finished doing another one of her workouts, and decided to continue with stretching after with this Dvd.  I love this because it is not too long in any one position so it is good for a beginner like me, and it is easier moves, and she does my pigeon pose, which is my favorite!  She is very eloquent with her cueing and moves.  Great workout.  I recommend it to anybody that is inflexible and awkward like myself.",1528502400,2,509,4.361702127659575

7763928,5,B01GKKXXG6,"Nice DVD - you can adjust the level to your own body.  Trying to watch the DVD and what my body is doing is a challenge, but it will get easier with repetitive viewings.  Like having the chair nearby to work on balance.",1525910400,,219,4.069767441860465

7763930,5,B01GKKXXG6,"Exactly what it says it is. Easy to do yet if do entire tape a really good stretch. It's broken into four parts, can do one area - like neck and shoulders - or all four for full body or mix up. I like to do neck and shoulders every day, the full tape once or twice a week, and careful with legs and floor work due to weak knees. But the pacing and the voice are perfect.",1525737600,,370,3.7564102564102564

7763938,2,B01GKKXXG6,"I read reviews faithfully before buying on Amazon.  Its a great help.  However, there were a lot of positive reviews of this dvd.  Its just a big waste of money for me.  Im looking for a great, fairly easy, relaxed yoga stretch.  What I hate about this is that instead of a good overall workout, its 30 minutes spent on legs, 30 on arms, 30 on abs, etc.  So you have to pick what you want to work on that day, because I don't have 90 minutes  to spend doing yoga.  Wish I knew how this is set up.  I would have given it a miss.  Its easythats for sure.  But you pretty much only get to work out one area at a timeunless you have a huge amount of time with nothing else to do.  So back to the drawing board and Ill continue looking.",1522454400,29,731,3.9315068493150687

7763940,5,B01GKKXXG6,"This is the best exercise DVD I ever had! It isn't too intense like some I have done in the past. I found it quite relaxing and the sound of flowing water in the backround is nice. This is something I could do every day and not dread it. I never did yoga before ,but I found this easy to follow . The stretches aren't too hard like I expected they would be. I have a crazy schedule so the 20 minute workouts are great. I didn't feel totally exhausted after and still could go on with my regular routine without being burned out. I highly recommend this DVD.",1522195200,3,557,4.1192660550458715
7763941,4,B01GKKXXG6,"I use this when I have a bad day at work or if it is too cold to go out. Combination of separate systems or a full program allows me to do the area that I need, quickly.",1521417600,,169,3.473684210526316
7763942,5,B01GKKXXG6,This DVD has really helped my back pain!  I'm very inflexible so this was exactly what I needed. It is for beginners but the instructor gives more advanced options. You can do just 20 minutes. Jessica is very likable.,1521244800,3,217,4.564102564102564
7763943,5,B01GKKXXG6,"As a beginner yoga person and an almost 50-year-old, this DVD was perfect for me. It is quite simple and Jessica keeps the pace slow and easy to follow. The background, the music and her voice are very appropriate and soothing. I did the entire DVD once so far and felt good. After I master this one, I will order a DVD with more difficulty and more skills.",1520726400,4,357,4.264705882352941

7763945,5,B01GKKXXG6,"It you are overwhelmed deciding which Yoga DVD to buy, I highly recommend this one. I had to give up Zumba because it was too hard on my joints.

Love that it's broken up into sections, or I can set it for the entire 120 minute dvd when I want a workout and have more time.
The 20 minute back portion is PERFECT after a workday of leaning forward.

Great pointers, reminders to breath, encouragement to listen to and respect your body.",1519171200,2,406,4.704225352112676

7763951,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I had to comment on this video as I was so happy to have finally stumbled across a yoga workout I know I will do and that is safe and effective and I like the instructor and setting too... I am in my  50s and have shoulder, neck and chronic low back issues. When the instructor commented on balancing the forward bends with supported back bends, I knew we were on the same page. This is a really balanced workout and I enjoy the Jessica's  manner of teaching. I also liked the setting and underlying sound of running water. I really liked her shoulder opener stretch.  also ordered her 30 min am/ pm beginner yoga tape that had great reviews and am hoping I can squeeze these shorter yoga practices into my work week and do this one on weekends.",1517702400,7,745,4.307142857142857
7763952,5,B01GKKXXG6,"Easy to follow and I like the fact there are three workouts to choose from.

7763976,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I'm a big fan of Jessica's walking videos, but this one is my current favorite.  I am in my late 30s, average weight, but my entire body is unbelievably tense and stiff!  Unfortunately I sit at a desk all day and commute by car...so I attribute my difficulties to all of the sitting and hunching over a computer.  This video has wonderful stretches and poses that will benefit your whole body from head to toe.  It's appropriate for beginners and people with little to no flexibility, like me.  Certain poses are very challenging for me, but in the comfort of my own home, I do my best and hope to improve over time.  Jessica moves through the poses very slowly which makes it ""gentle"" but effective.  I really want to stick with this.  Jessica's instructions and the background music are relaxing and not annoying at all.  If you are looking to reverse the negative effects of sitting all day, I'd urge you to try this.  It's worth making the time for.  Do a 20 minute session, or do 2 in a row if you have more time.  I also have low back issues that were badly exacerbated when I tried a yoga studio class.  No negative effects from this DVD at all, I absolutely love it.",1504396800,3,1174,4.37962962962963

It's easy enough that I can do the poses (some modified, some not) but hard enough that with practice I will be able to improve. They are also short enough that I won't get bored either!

Original review: I have been doing yoga for 3 weeks .  I have struggled to find a practice that would walk me thoroughly and gently (I'm pretty inflexible!) through a complete practice. This is it!  I did all 4 20 minute sessions one after the other. They flow beautifully and the DVD gives the option to do all at once as well as any one individually. I like the all at once option so I don't have to stop, put on my glasses and fiddle with it. It is a really good practice that left me stretched and tired. I cannot thank you enough. I will wear this out in my quest to complete it with the hardest modifications (currently on the easy ones!) so I can move on to some more challenging yoga.  The breath is also queued very well!  I see this in my life for a year or more. Yay!!!!!",1493078400,8,995,4.108247422680412

I'm absolutely less than a beginner. Yes, I've never done yoga and I'm extremely over weight, I have mobility problems but I'm very active and flexible for my size according to my physical therapist.

So I thought this would be something I could do after reading the description and reviews. WRONG!!! I couldn't even do them modified positions. I  was so disappointed I really needed to be able to stretch out my back because of my DDD (Degenerative disk disease) and spine compression.

Waste of time and money!!!",1489795200,3,592,4.609523809523809

I like that you can choose a specific flow for whatever is ailing you.  The 20 minutes flew by and the stretches were really targeting the areas it said they would.

I have asthma and after doing flow 2 chest/ back I feel like I can breath deeper.  I think that this is great to do at the end of the day or end of a workout or just to stretch and feel better. Jessica explains everything very well and I love the running water sound of the pool, the pretty scene by the pool ( flowers) and peaceful background music.

All the workouts are filmed outdoors by a lovely pool surrounded by flowers.  It is a very Zen like setting.

FLOW 1:  NECK AND SHOULDERS
The theme:  Letting go.

Some of my favorite moves from this workout include:  jaw massage, shoulder roll, head nod and side-to-side, arm circles,plie pulse with eagle arms and flow from down dog to plank to up dog.

FLOW 2: BACK AND CHEST
The theme: Open your heart and release your back.

There is 10 minutes of standing poses and 10 minutes of seated poses.

Some of my favorite standing poses include:  sun salutations with chest opener, triceps stretch with a gentle side bend and a flowing twisting chair pose.

Some of my favorite seated poses include: spinal twist while crossed-legged, slow bridge, lying snow angel arms and sphinx.

FLOW 3:  HIPS AND KNEES
The theme: Relax your joints and free your hips.

You may need a chair for balance.
I especially enjoyed this flow since Jessica kept gently reminding us when to inhale and when to exhale.  I always get confused about that.

There is about 15 minutes of standing poses and 6 minutes of seated poses.

Some of my favorite standing poses include: ankle circles, lotus into tree pose, half-moon, eagle, royal dance and split stance hamstring stretch.

Some of my favorite seated poses include: butterfly, straddle stretch, lying quad stretch and lying pigeon stretch.  My very favorite, happy baby, was also in there.

FLOW 4: TOTAL BODY
The theme: Reconnect to your center.

You may need a chair for balance.

There are about 15 minutes of standing stretches and 10 minutes of seated ones.

Some of my favorite standing poses include:  sun salutations, flowing chair and crescent flow.  The operative word here is flow.  The poses just flowed so naturally; I felt so graceful.

Some of my favorite seated poses include: plank to down dog to up dog and spinal twist.

I had been having real trouble sleeping lately, and I think this relaxed me- but it wasn't at all too easy. Holding some of the poses was just the right amount of challenging.

I'll tell you what it feels like: It feels like I'm taking a YOGA STRETCH class from an Excellent (I mean very excellent!) Yoga teacher.  There is a great Yoga Stretch class in my town, but like Jessica Smith, the Yoga Instructor is excellent, so word has gotten out and now the class is so packed that there's barely room to put my mat down.

I like this DVD because on days I don't have much time the total body flow is great. It's the perfect stretch after a workout. The other segments are great to stretch specific areas if you have more time. I especially like the neck and shoulders segment where I tend to have tension in sometimes.

I feel confident that with consistent practice my strength, flexibility and balance will improve.

7764188,5,B01GKKXXG6,"This CD is a wonderful addition to at-home yoga practice, especially for beginners and for busy people.  Each of 4 sections is a 20 minute session which makes any of them doable and effective.  I love Jessica's guidance, too.  She gives clear directions, always offers options to make a pose more or less challenging, and is just really pleasant to follow.  I'm not a newcomer to yoga, but I always feel refreshed and relaxed after doing any one of these ""flows.""",1474070400,2,463,4.679012345679013
7764189,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I really like this DVD a lot.  I am 64 and returning to yoga after a couple of years of health problems.  I have to do quite a bit of modificaion with the poses, but I am able to keep up with pretty well with them and always feel better after the workout.  It was well worth the purchase",1473465600,41,287,3.830508474576271
7764190,4,B01GKKXXG6,"This was not what I thought it was going to be. However the segments (about 20 minutes each)  are targeted for certain areas and one for the whole body. I can really use the one for hips and the one for neck. For whatever reason, I don't use them a lot. They don't count as ""exercise"" and after I have exercised I don't feel like putting one of these on. I can tell that they work so I try to work them into my schedule.",1473379200,,420,3.9411764705882355
7764191,5,B01GKKXXG6,This is one of my favorite yoga routines! Jessica makes it easy to follow and it's not intense.,1473120000,,95,4.333333333333333
7764192,2,B01GKKXXG6,It wasn't exactly what I expected.  I was hoping that she would have given more explicit instructions rather than just showing you.  I think it would be better to take an actual class than to follow a DVD.,1473033600,3,205,4.368421052631579

7764196,5,B01GKKXXG6,I got this dvd along with the others in the Walk Strong set and have really enjoyed them.  I consider myself intermediate to advanced exercise enthusiast and these challenge me during my strongest times and when I need to take things a little easy for a bit.  I would definitely recommend them to all levels.,1472342400,,308,4.581818181818182
7764197,5,B01GKKXXG6,I have only been able to do one so far. It was very relaxing. When I was done I felt very calm and better stretched out. I had a broken ankle when I did this dvd and it actually help relieve the pain. I would recommend this dvd and well as all of Jessica Smith dvds. I have them all and each one is great. Jessica is my favorite personal trainer! She is very motivating and helps you get through each exercise.,1472256000,,410,4.012195121951219
7764218,5,B01GKKXXG6,This is the first Jessica Smith yoga video I have and I just love it. She is always so encouraging in all of videos and she is so easy to follow. I am a fan forever. Can't wait for new videos to come out.,1472256000,,204,3.659090909090909
7764219,5,B01GKKXXG6,"The video was shot in a super relaxing atmosphere, I love hearing the fountain in the background.  As always Jessica's cueing is excellent.  There are several separate sections you can customize on your own and there is one 30 minute full body session in which I work up a sweat every time.  Thank you Jessica for another great workout option!",1472169600,,343,4.683333333333334
7764220,5,B01GKKXXG6,Easy to follow and easy to perform.  I like the 20-minute length and the fact that the sessions are divided and listed by the area of the body each one concentrates on.,1472083200,,168,4.25
7764221,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I just tried two of the yoga practices - Neck & Shoulders and Hips and Knees.  Jessica Smith's instruction is excellent and the modifications are well described.  I currently have Yoga for Beginners with Jessica Smith which I thoroughly enjoy (and many other yoga dvds by other instructions) but Gentle Yoga is so great in that it allows me to just do practices related to specific body areas.  I am extremely tight in my hips and shoulders/neck due to desk work and Gentle Yoga allows those areas to stretch, relax and realign.  I feel as if I have just had a good physical therapy appointment or chiropractic appointment.  I would recommend for beginners and advanced alike.  Jessica does an incredibly good job providing movements for all ranges of motion.",1471737600,5,759,4.844961240310077
7764222,5,B01GKKXXG6,I love this dvd!  The stretches aren't hard to do and she shows modifications....I feel like I've gotten such a good stretch with this one and it feels great to do after a workout.  I had to modify a couple of times due to bad knees but overall these are great stretching routines!  Love the setting!,1471737600,,300,4.321428571428571

Also, hit a weight plateau and have actually made progress.  I plan on getting more of her DVD's when money allows for it.
If you're contemplating, just do it and stick with it.",1471737600,36,353,4.318181818181818

7764225,5,B01GKKXXG6,This DVD was exactly what I was looking for. I hurt myself at the gym so I was looking for something that I could do that would strengthen and stretch without to much pressure while my stomach heals. And at this time of year this will definitely help with stress relief.,1471219200,4,270,4.313725490196078
7764226,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I like this DVD very much. I am beginner/intermediate level with yoga and I had back surgery in my lumbar spine about 13 years ago. This DVD is great for any level yoga practitioner, but especially beginning/intermediate because the poses are not too demanding. Jessica gives the basic pose first, and if there is a way to advance it or progress it, she gives you that as well. The DVD is four 20 minute workouts. Three are divided into dedicated body parts like neck/shoulders, knees/hips, back/chest, and the final one is total body. I find it relaxing and well-paced, but not too slow.",1471219200,2,588,4.718446601941747
7764227,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I recently purchased all four of Jessica's new DVDs--all winners--and I wanted to add some additional points that I neglected to place in my other review.  There are several other features of all her new walking programs that set her apart as well: first, she explains technique perfectly!  As I mentioned in my other review, I have many other exercise DVDs from top names in the field, and often I don't think the instructions are adequate; hence, injuries are more likely.  You're in great hands with Jessica because she demonstrates an understanding of physiology by her clear, detailed instructions, and I feel safe with her.  Second, I love the clock feature she has on all her recent DVDs.  It helps you gauge your endurance as well as encourage you to make that final push when you see the time is almost over! Last, I think the price point of Jessica's DVDs are very reasonable.  For $14.95 you get three 30-minute workouts.  I normally pay $19.95 for two 30-minute workouts from other leading names.

I can't say enough positive things about this wonderful woman who truly is revolutionizing  exercise programs offered to the general public. I think if you give her a try, you will be a continuing customer.",1471132800,2,1216,4.8076923076923075
7764347,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I have been doing nothing but Jessica Smith workouts for the last month and a half and I've never felt better! I have always stayed away from Yoga because I feel like I can't do a lot of moves, but Jessica always gives you options for your level of movement. Her workouts are the best!",1471132800,2,285,4.2
7764348,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I really enjoy everything Jessica puts out. Her streaming site has schedules that are fun, and they are what finally got me to stick to a consistent workout. This DVD allows for someone who needs to stretch to pick an area to work on (neck and shoulders, chest and back, hips and knees) or total body, and each about 20 minutes. You can also play them all in any order you want for a fuller routine. Awesome! These work great as add-ons as well. A beginner can feel welcome as these are truly basic stretch routines using yoga poses, but they work for all levels, because they just feel good, and who doesn't need that?",1470960000,4,619,4.391304347826087
7764349,1,B01GKKXXG6,The dvd was very hard to use. It didn't play and maneuver from my remote like it should. Cheaply put together.,1470960000,5,110,4.285714285714286

7764351,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I own most of Jessica's DVDs--she is great! Clear instruction and nice mix of postures. I do one session after aerobic activity. If someone is new to yoga or recovering from an injury I would say this DVD is just okay. Not advanced it still wouldn't be the easiest to modify. I would recommend jane Adams (DVDs available through Amazon). Even though I am long recovered from frozen shoulders, I love her gentle yoga.",1470700800,,416,4.635135135135135

7764356,5,B01GKKXXG6,I liked this DVD . I  used it  with the walk strong 2.0 challenge it was a wonderful way to end a workout . However for me this was used for a relaxing yoga stretch . I did not use the chair but it was nice that Jessica thinks of all fitness levels .,1470009600,2,250,3.611111111111111

7764369,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I love yoga, but am not very flexible. I love how Jessica starts into the pose slowly so you can find your degree of mobility. You're always free to stop when you feel a stretch and don't have to continue adding all the other options. I also like how she explains each pose and what it does.

There are four different ""flows"" and each one is designed to target a specific area of the body. One focuses primarily on the hips/knees, one on the back/chest and one on the neck/shoulders (which is my all-time fave). I also like the total body flow because it hits all body areas efficiently. Plus, they're only 20 minutes long and who can't find a small amount of time within their day?",1469836800,25,682,4.3700787401574805

7764371,5,B01GKKXXG6,"Finally a yoga practice I can do. My doctor suggested yoga to relax to help with anxiety and hypertension but after doing some research I found that many of the poses on other videos I have and in a studio class are contraindicated for those with high blood pressure so I thought maybe I  couldn't do yoga at all. I appreciate the modifications on this dvd and it is gentle without feeling like I'm doing nothing at all. Some of the poses are a bit challenging in a good way. I think, as with most yoga videos, it helps to have some prior knowledge of yoga. I add a few minutes of savasana at the end.",1469750400,44,601,4.181034482758621
7764372,5,B01GKKXXG6,"I bought the six week transformation videos back in april and adding these videos to them gives me a great workout. I love the variety and the positive vibe I get from Jessica. I like that she is personable and has her mom do the easier adjustments so that I can get used to the workout. With summer being crazy with the kids out of school, I find this works well so the kids can watch their shows while mom works out in the basement. I definitely feel the workout and am sore from it which is great. She works all different areas of the body from circuit lower, upper and total, to walk aerobics, yoga, and more circuit training in these. There only about 30 to 35 min long and she tells you on the back what you need for extra equipment. Mostly hand weights, stretch band, ball, and step is what you need but her mom does the workout without sometimes so you can still do it until you get the added equipment. I loved that she added the step this time. Overall very happy with this purchase. I am not in the best shape and have lots of work cut out for me to lose weight and be healthier. This gives me motivation to do so.",1469491200,,1125,4.141552511415525

7764374,2,B01GKKXXG6,"I love Jessica Smith but I did not care for this DVD and found it to be a waste of time.  I just find her DVD workouts not nearly as effective as her YouTube workouts. I do like that it is just her in this DVD. The setting was really beautiful but otherwise but at 37 years old, this seemed more like yoga routines I would recommend to my mom. I know it says ""gentle yoga"" but it was a little too gentle with the chair being used all the time and then the stretches were not held long enough.  However, of all 4 routines, the chest & back routine was pretty nice.  It felt good.  I do think this one is better than her Yoga Stretch DVD...although that one is fine too.
