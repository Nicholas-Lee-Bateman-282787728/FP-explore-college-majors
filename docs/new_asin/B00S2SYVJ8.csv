8697053,5,B00S2SYVJ8,"This is a fascinating ""the rest of the story"" film. The cruise ship that was run aground by a careless captain was the length of three football fields and had to righted completely intact to avoid polluting the sea.",1443484800,,215,4.538461538461538
8697054,5,B00S2SYVJ8,Amazing story of the recovery of the turned over cruise ship. What a waste  due to bloated ego of a Captain and loss of life so not warranted.,1440374400,,142,4.071428571428571
8697055,5,B00S2SYVJ8,"To raise Costa Concordia a ship the length of three football fields, weighing forty five thousand tons, three times the size of Titanic, fifteen thousand tons heavier than the bombed 1941 US Oklahoma in Hawaii which had to be salvaged in the same manner, this documentary is in the same line as mega structures, a feast of human achievement in engineering with workers from twenty nine countries with Titan Salvage, an American business in charge of the operation, Costa Concordia was raised one hundred thirty two weeks following an extra ordinary engineering operation, at a cost of $1.2 billion, nine hundred twenty three days after it was capsized with loss of thirty two people and one diver during salvage. The agony of those lost lives and all the expense to the owner of Costa Concordia and the damage to the environment was due to the stupidity of one single individual, a careless amazingly irresponsible individual. Great documentary.",1421884800,,945,5.025477707006369
8697056,5,B00S2SYVJ8,"I just watched this on PBS and I came away just saying, ""WOW!""
The engineering work that went into devising and designing the method of raising this wreck WITHOUT damage to a pristine ecosystem is truly amazing. They had to basically invent a way to do this, then design and build a variety of massive structures and attach them to the ship in order to right and float her without breaking her.  The total cost of the operation was well over twice the cost to build the ship and that doesn't include the cost of dismantling her.  The cost of human lives can't be counted:  32 from the wreck and one diver from the ""rescue"" operation.",1421798400,,633,4.439655172413793
