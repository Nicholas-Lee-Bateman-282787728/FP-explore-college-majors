8335613,5,B001QFYJDC,Present for traveling friends. They loved it!,1410912000,,45,5.571428571428571
8335614,3,B001QFYJDC,Gives basic immigration information but hardly an exhaustive guide. Makes it sound easier than it is to immigrate to New Zealand. We lived there for four years so I know something on the subject.,1391299200,,195,4.764705882352941
8335615,5,B001QFYJDC,This DVD helped me transition and move to New Zealand. It was a big help! This is an informative and educational video. Thank you!,1390435200,,130,4.458333333333333
8335616,2,B001QFYJDC,I was disappointed to discover how dated the material in this video is. I was also disappointed that there is not more imagery of New Zealand in the video. Its really just a series of interviews conducted long ago in poorly decorated interior spaces. It was hard to stay awake to watch it. It badly needs to be updated.,1310083200,,319,4.423728813559322
8335617,5,B001QFYJDC,"My sister and I have been looking at relocating to NZ for several years and this had lots of info that was to the point and easy to understand.  Plus all of the actual experiences from people who have actually done it!  And not just all of the ""fluffy"" positives, but some of the negatives also.  And good advice! Highly recommend this to anyone thinking about moving to New Zealand!",1264291200,4,383,4.442857142857143
8335618,5,B001QFYJDC,"There are 2 discs - Disc 1 has info - Disc 2 has interviews

The interviewees don't have a lot of helpful information; but Disc 1 is extremely thorough and honest.  I bought this because I've been considering leaving the country, and New Zealand is a top choice.  However, after learning all this new information, it really made me a lot less gung ho about moving.  There's bureaucracy and red tape, and I don't like any of it.  That's why I want to leave America.",1262476800,7,464,4.411764705882353
8335619,5,B001QFYJDC,"My wife and I are in the process of immigrating to New Zealand from the United States and we have been impressed with this DVD. The DVD does a great job at explaining so many facets of the country including where to live, where to bank, where to work, and even how to manage day-to-day life. Even if you've done tremendous research on the topics, as we have, this DVD still provides insight into a country that no book or internet site can match!",1257206400,2,446,4.321428571428571
8335620,5,B001QFYJDC,This video was absolutely delightful.  Beautiful pictures and well informed.  It really helps get a feel for a country whether you decide this country is for you or not.  I actually would like to see other countries done because it was so enjoyable.,1234051200,4,249,4.744186046511628
