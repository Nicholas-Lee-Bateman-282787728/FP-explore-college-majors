188253,4,1571320377,"Using my Gramp`s account. My aunt purchased this DVD at Toys R Us for my younger brother as a holiday gift for my brother a few years ago. He used to watch this DVD all of the time and it is good for any child between the 2-6 age range.
Synopsis:
When Stella`s clock numbers go missing,
Barney and the kids go to the library to
retrieve the missing numbers,
so Stella can show everyone her surprise.
Giving this product 4 stars, because the quality is in SD (Standard Definition).",1416787200,,480,4.344444444444444

188271,3,1571320377,"I should have researched the reviews a bit more because Parents are always honest ! It is a bit misleading as counting isn't the main theme of this dvd. I was expecting a little more interactive number counting, like showing the numbers on the screen as you see on the front of the dvd with the large print #'s. The costumes of the characters are entertaining as are the songs and the library scene. I rated this dvd 3 stars because I felt like there could have been more emphasis on the actual learning of numbers and counting....I seemed as though this was just touched on a bit.",1267315200,,581,4.388888888888889

188274,3,1571320377,"This is a cute video. My son is a little young for it to hold his attention the whole way through, but he enjoys the singing and dancing a lot.

It should be said that the title and packaging are a bit misleading. It's not really about counting. Rather, there's an actual storyline involving a Mary Poppins type character named Stella losing her clock numbers in her travels. Barney and his pals help search for them, ending up at the library. There, they read books and act them out as characters in the stories. It's much more a plug for reading than for math, but it is fun.

I was pleasantly surprised at my son's enjoyment of the video. He likes the Spanish track, too. Fine for the little ones in the house.",1205712000,8,713,4.353383458646617
188275,3,1571320377,"I am giving this 3 stars because my son loves Barney, and they are the only dvds he pays attention to.  But this video was a big disappointment.  He will not learn anything from this.  There is not nearly enough attention placed on numbers to have labeled this a counting dvd.  If you are looking for something to help teach your child to count, try Meet the Numbers from Preschool Prep.  It lacks the appeal of Barney, but they'll learn to count in no time.",1193443200,4,458,4.341176470588235
188276,5,1571320377,My granddaughter is 7 months old and she just loves Barney. I love it because it keeps her attention and is teaching her at the same time.,1180656000,,138,4.148148148148148
188277,5,1571320377,I had this video for all three of my kids and they loved it. My youngest watched it so much that my VCR finally ate it so I purchased this DVD. Very educational and fun to watch.,1171411200,3,178,3.8378378378378377
188278,5,1571320377,"I have a special affection for ""It's Time for Counting"".  My Rachel, when she was 14 months old, became VERY interested in numbers due to watching this video.  Within a few weeks, she had full number recognition 0-9, and would point them out loudly everywhere we went (especially the grocery store!).
The plot is really clever and has a nice balance between retold nursery rhymes/fairy tales and the hunt for Stella's missing alarm clock numbers.  The costumes and choreography are first rate: colorful, seamless, well rehersed.  The songs are non-annoying and clever.
As a first grade teacher, I can tell you that my students love singing the ""Learn to Borrow Books from the Library"" song.  We sing it every week before my class goes to check out books (the librarian likes it, too).  I like to give this video as a gift to young children - I can not recommend it more highly.",1000252800,9,877,4.699346405228758
