A live concert DVD is needed MANA.",1096329600,5,201,4.025
7962729,3,B000067G13,"When they made the DVD, there are some things they should have changed on it.

If you're a Mana fan, you'll know all the songs. One live track, a cover of ""El Rey"" filmed in Montreux Switerland shows of Alex Gonzalez's drumming, something that doesn't come through on their studio tracks.

As far as the videos themselves go, you see it going from something that is borderline public access video, to some embarrassing videos that are kind of humorous, to a more polished look towards the ""Suenos Liquidos"" videos, where it ends. Nothing from ""Revolucion de Amor"" or their song with Carlos Santana ""Corazon Espinado"" (which is on Carlos' ""Supernatural"" DVD) is included.

Here's the complaints that I found more annoying than anything:

the cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Fool in the Rain"", straight off of the ""Econium"" tribute video is them in the studio talking about recording the song. It either should be the full song or in the ""extras"". It's something that you wind up forwarding and gets annoying real fast. ""Clavado En Un Bar"" has 5 minutes of the ""making of"", yet you can't skip the making of, you have to forward it. Another one that belongs in the ""extras"". It's something that we should be able to enjoy with the TV on or off. The ""in betweens"" can get a little noisy at times but isn't a big deal.

It's not in Surround Sound, but you can hear it playing in all the speakers.

I'd like to see them revamp this one a little bit to make it more ""DVD-friendly"" and put out a live DVD which shows off how great they are in concert. Even if you don't understand Spanish, the music alone is good enough to enjoy...",1092528000,11,1617,4.52054794520548
