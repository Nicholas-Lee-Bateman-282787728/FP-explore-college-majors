It's scary thinking that things like this are still going on.  BUY THIS MOVIE, and make everyone you know watch it!",1271203200,4,246,4.568181818181818
8316456,5,B001KY0IHA,"Excellent documentary.  Really shows how good we have it in the U.S.  I wish enough people would actually see the movie to make a difference, but I'm afraid the people that need to watch this most are exactly the ones who won't.  So get this movie and pass it to all your friends and family.",1251417600,6,291,4.254545454545455
