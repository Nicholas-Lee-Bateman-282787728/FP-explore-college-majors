5346287,5,B009LA1QSU,"""We've seen a huge up rise in superhero films in the past few years from the re-envisioning of classic superheroes, to grittier take of regular folk being superheroes to actual documentary on real life superheroes and just when I though we could run out of energy on the genre, here comes ASMD smashing up expectations left, right and centre kicking us back into place with an old skool take of with over the top villains and high stakes scenarios. With the set up of superheroes vs. evil villain in a race against time with hapless, rigged-to-explosive victims it's easy to try and cram the film into a Saw shaped box painted with Joker colours, but ASMD is so much more. The film really looks at both the power of choice and the role that we play in our lives, and also looks at even if we have a choice about that role. Do we work with it, or against it? What happens if more than 1 person wants the same role? And, is it even possible to be anyone but who you really are and even if you stay true, can that still create inner conflict? I really appreciated the fresh take on a classic superhero story full with moral dilemmas, rivals & friendships plus battles of brains & brawn. I also really enjoyed the performances of the cast especially lead actor/director/writer Jason Trost as the quietly-heroic & reluctant leader as well as from Lucas Till (X-Men: First Class) who continues to shine in everything he is in and I anticipate seeing many more great performances from him in the future. ASMD is the only film this year in the festival where I really had to sit and think on it as opposed to having an initial gut reaction of YAY! or BOO!, I wasn't confused about what happened in the film but I was continuing to sort out my reaction to the film because although the genre is familiar, it's doing something different. Huge kudos to the filmmaker for taking a bold and brave move in a genre that has exploded but often offered us the same dark and dismal look at the world. Who knew this indie gem out would re-light the fire of tried and true heroes. I didn't, but I'm happy it did. I highly recommend kicking back old school checking out ASMD."" - MovieMoxie.com",1356220800,13,2172,4.446115288220551
5346288,5,B009LA1QSU,"A true burn-everything-to-the-ground superhero movie, ASMD goes to dark places in which the Dark Knight would have no business. It's a small film freed by its limited scale to do nasty things to its characters, and to imply something nastier about the heroes that inspired them. If only other superhero films would take this ""little from a lot"" attitude of ASMD and apply it to their massive budgets. Failing that, they would at least do well with borrowing a little bit of ASMD`s balls.",1356220800,6,487,4.809523809523809

5346290,2,B009LA1QSU,"I went into this without many expectations. I was hoping that I would get an interesting, dark superhero story, but that was about it. It's not the bad effects or the budget that bothered me, I can deal with that. It's just thatthese characters weren't very interesting, there were several annoying plot-holes, and some predictable directions taken in the story. It feels like the movie is trying to tell me something, but it's got so many weird contradictions that I'm not sure what that ""something"" is. The sequel's coming out soon, and I'm hoping that I'll enjoy it more than the first one, because I like seeing smaller-scale superhero movies.",1467936000,,647,4.890909090909091
5346291,3,B009LA1QSU,"It's certainly a fun movie, but at the same time, it's lacking effort.
It's lacking the sense of devotion that Super or any other super hero movie gives to the genre. Yeah marvel and DC back their movies with millions of dollars and A lister actors...but this movie could've been something like Watchmen.  No one has real super powers. Hell, it could've succeeded without real costumes, but I just left this movie wanting more.
I did however, appreciate the young cast, whom many have actually seen real super hero movies like x-men",1459209600,,532,4.782608695652174

It has no plausible beginning, a mishmash of a middle, and no sensible ending.  Is the movie meant to be a metaphor? Is it a superheroe's nightmare?  What powers did these so-called superheroes once have? How were they overcome to lose them? Occasional flashbacks in black & white only add to the confusion and don't really clarify anything.  How did the villain become so deadly?  Where are the rest of the people in the city which, from a map, appears to be quite large? Where are the police or firemen? Why am I asking these silly questions - after all it's only a movie?!  As the film begins, our 4 ""superheroes"" awaken to find that they have been injected in their wrist with something; they shortly find that they are now powerless (but can certainly swear); are locked in a deadly game with James Remar who has strategically placed old TV sets all around the city through which he can communicate and leer; unless thwarted in time (our heroes always have only 90 seconds) people will be blown up and/or one of them will die. Get the picture? - No, don't!  The only ""superhero"" is apparently the villain who accomplishes all with no help from anyone else, possesses sophisticated technology by 1970s standards, and resides in what looks like a messy trailer.  Who will prevail? Who will fail? Will there be a sequel? Who cares?!",1429401600,4,1601,4.652482269503546

5346305,4,B009LA1QSU,"I just watched the indie film ""All Superheroes Must Die."" There's some excellent writing in this--you can tell the writer wasn't writing an indie film. He was writing something with emotional resonance, and bigger than life moments, and endings to long histories that we can only guess at. Honestly, some of the words were touching and powerful. There's a Frank-Milleresque crime noir element to this movie. The soundtrack is good, the production values relatively good. Three of the five leads were really good, and their acting was real and even memorable. Now, as for the criticisms... As a creator of indie entertainment material myself, and as a writer who sometimes tries to transcend my medium and the resources I have at hand, I don't feel like chopping this movie up for it's flaws. I believe this crew gave 110% effort to make something of substance. In many ways they succeeded, so I give ""All Superheroes Must Die"" a positive grade.",1390089600,,944,4.90625
5346306,3,B009LA1QSU,I hoped it would be better. It's an indie film after all. There's a q&a segment in the bonus features. Pity the audience didn't ask about the bad acting. Shadow/Jill was the worst. The actor playing Charge wrote and directed this film. Rickshaw was good. You get these old film trailers on the dvd. The soundtrack is alright. Check out Super.,1384041600,,342,4.622950819672131
5346307,3,B009LA1QSU,"This film has one of the most original plots I've seen in a long time, however this film was panned by critics. After seeing All Superheroes Must Die, I really can't understand why it has one of the lowest IMDB ratings I've ever seen. It's nowhere near as good as it could have been, but it's certainly not as bad as most critics are making it out to be. Four superheroes wake up in an abandon town with their powers gone. Near them are TV sets, which explain that they have been captured by their arch-enemy, Rickshaw, and will be forced to play a game, in order to save the towns residence. The story is extremely original, but what I liked most about it was that the characters weren't over the top. The ""superheroes"" are actually normal twenty-somethings, who got powers from an object that fell from the sky. They are drinking, swearing, seemingly normal people, who were put into this impossible situation by a madman. Rickshaw is played by veteran character actor, James Remar, who was terrific. Parts of the film are slow and when things do slow down, Rickshaw, as clever as he is funny, is there to move things along. Jason Trost is the lead superhero, Charge, and he did a lot more than star in this thing, he wrote, produced, and directed it, which is a hard thing to do, especially for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience. The one knock I have against this film is that due to their small budget and independent status, much of the action scenes were very short. The challenges were clever, but by the time you understood what was going to happen, it was over. The film itself is very short, which doesn't allow them to go deeply into anything and that's what I think most people disliked about the film. It's not that this was a bad movie, it's that it really could have been a whole lot more.",1383350400,5,1815,4.453453453453453
5346308,5,B009LA1QSU,"All Superheroes Must Die is better then a lot of stuff that comes out of Hollywood today. While they're more concerned with how much money and explosions they can shove into 3 hours, we have independent minds working with a few thousands of dollars making film greats such as this.
It's a smart, realistic take on the super hero genre the likes of which haven't been seen before. Jason Trost KNOWS what he's doing and I believe he'll be around for many years to come.
Less then 5 dollars for this is a steal! Just remember, this isn't your little brothers typical ""action figure from wal-mart"" movie.",1381363200,2,600,4.616822429906542

the movie. The writing, etcetera. the sFX were okay, mainly because there wasn't any. Luckily,

5346311,3,B009LA1QSU,"I originally saw this movie in a retail store, but was hesitant to pay full price ($10) without knowing anything about it.  I picked it up on Amazon for a reasonable price, and it was an enjoyable movie for that price.

The movie has a fun premis of the superheroes losing their powers and having to function without them, but does not expand on how they were captured, nor does it really build any backstory for the ""heroes"" or the villian.  I found it to be more of a watered down ""SAW"" type move, where regardless of what the good guys did, the civilians would die.  No one was saved, and the ending was lackluster.

This movie was an enjoyable way to kill and hour and fifteen minutes, worth a few bucks, but I would not pay full price.",1375660800,,740,4.294964028776978
5346312,5,B009LA1QSU,I truly enjoyed this little gem. It's amazing what can be done with so little money. I enjoyed the story and the tone. Does anybody really think the script for X-Men: First Class was anything but horrible. The X Men's crappy script and mediocre acting is covered up by millions of dollars of CGI. This is true for so many of the new action films out there. ASMD was excellent for what they had to work with and I thought Jason Trost as the hero and James Remar as the the villain were excellent. Despite all the single stars I would suggest that individuals take a peek at this excellent little film. Is it an Oscar nominee? Certainly not but it is a fun little movie. We need to applaud these indie directors to make sure they can keep making movies. Especially at a time when more and more big releases are absolute drivel with CGI and explosions added.,1375142400,4,855,4.383647798742138

5346315,1,B009LA1QSU,"My roommate brought this filth into our apartment and somehow we managed to watch it from start to finish. She only spent a dollar on it but I would demand my money back even if she got it for a dime, and if she couldn't I would find Jason Trost and make him give me his lunch money for it, because this movie is just that awful. I have seen plenty of low budget independent films that have gone off of scraps and are still better than this boringly insulting film. If you want to see a GOOD terrible movie, see Frankenhooker, Dead Alive, or just stare at a wall for an hour. This movie isn't even terrible in a way that you can laugh at. It just makes you angry. The girl actor is worse than Kristen Stewart and her character does virtually nothing but stand there and stare at things with a droopy puppy look that makes you want to crawl under a rock for the rest of your life. Jason Trost's character is trying to be stoic and tragic, but really he's just terrible at everything he does. Forget whoever played THE WALL, because he's practically non-existent to the point that they should have just written out his character completely. Same with Lucas Till's character. Although he was the only one with any acting skills at all, you won't see them in this movie and since it's clear the only characters that the writer of the script cared about were the the ones most void of talent (the only girl and Trost's character, who's names aren't even worth knowing). This film needed some serious editing to say the least. They take themselves too seriously even though there is clearly a lack of passion put into the plot, acting and setting since there is none. My roomy and I were barely introduced to the 'characters' when we were already wanting them all to be dead. You can't care about any of the characters, not even the villain who only wanted the same thing that we wanted- for the 'super heroes' to all die horribly. Not all is lost, however, at least the cover art for the case was good, even though it was all lies. I wouldn't be surprised if that was where all their budget went. I wish it was possible to give less than one star or even just no star. This will be 78 minutes of my life I will never get back.",1370304000,,2221,4.315789473684211
5346316,1,B009LA1QSU,"I like movies. I like superheros.  I didn't like this at all. I think this is possibly the worst thing I've ever seen.  I'm glad I only paid $1 for it. From the only female hero's inability to do ANYTHING besides breathe and look distressed, to the lack of any substantial background for anyone other than for the couple, this was just overall terrible. I think the writers should have spent months instead of days creating it, and then MAYBE it would have had some potential. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they wanted something to laugh at. If you like strong female characters don't buy it. If you like plot, don't buy it. If you like minions dressed up like stuffed animals, buy it. Props to the party responsible for creating the DVD cover artwork, however.",1370304000,,775,4.568345323741007
5346317,1,B009LA1QSU,"I watched their earlier movie ""The FP"" which was awesome for it's over-the-top camp and mix of styles.  This new movie, however, commits the biggest sin...it is a total snoozefest from start to finish.  I have no idea what the Trost folks and everyone else on crew were thinking when they made this.  The acting is bad. In scenes where they should cry, they just kind of look sad-ish.  Hey guys, get a plate of fresh diced onions and stick it out of FOV.  Instant tears.  Also, the reaction of some of the characters is not believable.  One of the heroes, who is not incapacitated, just stares while a villain attacks a fellow hero with a knife.  The music sucks.  And James Remar is boring, probably because the writing for his character is uninspired.  Lee Valmassey was da bomb in the FP, and winds up severely underused in this film.  I could go on, but I'm just wondering if the folks making this were not feeling inspired and just needed to do something to keep busy and add to their resume.  That's what it feels like.  Indie  and low budget movies can be good, and the Trost folks have talent, but this is certainly not their best effort. Avoid.",1367798400,2,1153,4.454545454545454
5346318,3,B009LA1QSU,"The concept of this film feels like an X-men versus Arcade in Murderworld story.  The heroes wake up trapped in a deadly game where they have to participate in several challenges set up by the villain.  If they win, they can go free.  If they lose or don't play at all, everyone dies.  Personally, I'm not a fan of these types of stories, but this movie doesn't have the kids gloves approach that X-men comics used to have.

I read the reviews before I watched this movie, which lowered my expectations.  That definitely impacted my viewing experience for the better.  The average score of 2.5 stars is about right for this film.  Some things are done really well, but other parts fall flat.  I liked the costumes, and the actions by the characters made sense for the most part.  On the other hand, there are some significant plot holes, yet they need to be overlooked or else there is no movie.  The film is about 15-20 minutes too short, which could have been filled by a flashback that showed the heroes using their powers or working as a team or explain what they had done to the villain that spurred his revenge plot.

Could this have been better?  Sure, but you have to consider that this is a low budget film when watching it.  Just remind yourself that you are watching an up-and-comer's early work, and then you can enjoy it for what it is.",1367625600,14,1349,4.453061224489796

The DVD lacks any extras and as cheap as this thing was made, I was surprised it had scene jumps and a case. We are thrust into a story with zero character introduction. 4 superheroes in ripped wet suits,whose past we know nothing about, are suddenly placed into a game designed for them to lose by a foe (James Remar) we know even less about.

The heroes have been injected by (?) and their powers which we know nothing about are gone except for John who still has his strength which he never uses as he gets kicked around. There are black and white flashbacks which are meaningless. This film was written in four days and shot in 15, 10 hour segments. It is a stinker that lacks camp value as well.

Unless you plan on playing the suggested drinking game that goes with this film (Google it) I must strongly urge you to avoid this one.

Frequently, I rent low budget movies from Redbox and find myself increasingly more impatient with low budget movies. It has been a long time since I picked up a non mainstream movie and actually finished it. However, I find myself enjoying this film. For a low budget movie, I thought the production quality was fairly good as well as the acting. Admittedly, there is a very limited back story and one does have to suspend some belief for certain elements of the film. People have pointed this out in other reviews like how is it possible for someone that appears to be invincible to lose super powers by an injected drug. This is further complicated by the lack of explanation of who has what kind of power. That being said, I liked the atmosphere of the film, the moral dilemmas and general idea of these super heroes being tested absent their powers. I found the movie to be generally enjoyable. Clearly, there are very strong reviews going both ways on this film but I think many of the middle of the road reviewers have this movie nailed.

Just because I believe it would have been a greatly improved experience if for ONE it took place in a city type setting. Not a town.

Most people will buy this movie because they are fans of the Trost brothers and as such, will be familiar with their works. If you are not a fan and are not familiar with their previous works, then it is very likely you will hate this movie. This movie takes an unconventional route of story telling that appeals to fans of the indie genre. It does not spoon feed you information and forces the viewer to wait to get the full story. The acting is one of its weak-points, it is not bad acting, but it does feel somewhat plastic in its presentation. As a fan, it is exciting to see the cast grow and learn but if viewing it from the outside, it would be understandable if people were not impressed. I think the truly remarkable part of this movie is the long-lasting effect it had on me. Like a fine wine or cheese or 40 oz, my enjoyment of the movie came after fully processing it. So, bottom line: if you're a fan of indie movies or a fan of the Trost brothers, give the movie a chance and you may find a new love in your life but if you're looking for conventional Hollywood story telling, steer clear.

Ok, strictly speaking, there are superheroes in the film, but don't expect anything super.  They just talk gallons of sentences about what it is like to be a superhero.  Even the flashback sequences are replete with gabbing.  As for the superheroes without superpowers, the producer/writer/director team of Till and Trost would have done well to have remembered what made the TV series ""Heroes"" suck so bad so quickly in the first place:  removing the very thing from the principal characters that hooked viewers in the first place, those superpowers.  Making a film about powerless superheroes could have been a fine idea.  An interesting theme of whether power makes the man, or merely compliments the character could have been explored.  Instead, we get endless monologue and some kind of semblance of a relationship between two of the characters.  Don't kid yourself, however there is no love lost in this film; indeed, heart is the one true superpower missing from All Superheroes Must Die.  Instead we have what look like a bunch of freshman/sophmore college kids filming themselves while they are LARPing.  Which means that if you have uninteresting heroes, the one thing left is to turn to the bad guy, James Remar.  To give Remar his due, he truly tries to knock the role out of the park but, like so much of this film, it all amounts to nothing in the end.  I would love to have seen him take it to Mark Hammil levels, ala the Joker voice work he did on the animated Batman series.

5346367,4,B009LA1QSU,"When I saw the box art for ""All Superheroes Must Die,"" the first thing that came to mind was ""Watchmen"" and ""Kick-Ass."" The two masked men on the cover reminded me of Ozymandias and Dave Lizewski because of their costumes. I was immediately intrigued when I read the synopsis and found out who directed, wrote, and starred in it.

The name Jason Trost will be known to many quirky film lovers who delighted in ""The FP."" Who wouldn't want to see another project made by the guy who brought us a movie about an apocalyptic world where people fought to the death playing a sadistic form of ""Dance, Dance Revolution?"" I could only imagine where he would take the superhero genre with ""All Superheroes Must Die.""

Four superheroes named Charge (Jason Trost), Cutthroat (Lucas Till), Shadow (Sophie Merkley), and The Wall (Lee Valmassy) wake up in what appears to be an abandoned town. They discover their super powers were taken away by their arch nemesis, Rickshaw (James Remar). The villain puts the heroes through a series of challenges that test both their mental and psychological strengths. They find themselves racing against the clock to save abducted civilians which Rickshaw is using in his insane game.

""All Superheroes Must Die"" is a unique, dark, and twisted take on the genre it addresses. It's a little slow at times but delivers some great violent spurts and causes the viewer to think about the questionable actions the characters make throughout the film. The concept of superheroes dealing with saving people without their powers leads to some disturbing outcomes.

I wasn't wrong in my initial comparisons to ""Watchmen"" and ""Kick-Ass"" as I perused the cover of the Blu-ray. The homemade costumes and colored language the heroes use heavily resembles the Minutemen and the empathetic characters in ""Kick-Ass."" Whether they were born with their powers or gained them later in life, these individuals are very ""human"" at heart.

Everyone in ""All Superheroes Must Die"" put forth their best effort in their roles. James Remar (""Dexter"") portrays the villain Rickshaw with devilish delight. Jason Trost plays Charge successfully as a downtrodden hero who is mentally exhausted by his work. Lucas Till is in familiar territory as Cutthroat, having already starred as Havok in ""X-Men: First Class.""

The audio and video for the high-definition transfer of this indie feature is better than one would expect for a movie made on less than a million dollars. The grimy and grainy feel of the film lends to its necessary bleak atmosphere. The clarity of Blu-ray takes nothing away from the movie. The 5.1 surround mix adequately blends the dialogue, sound effects, and electronic score together.

A lack of any bonus material for the Blu-ray edition of ""All Superheroes Must Die"" is disheartening. After the great packaging for ""The FP,"" I expected more from this release. It would have been great to see a ""Making of"" featurette for the movie.

Superhero fans of ""Watchmen"" and ""Kick-Ass"" will find something to appreciate in ""All Super Heroes Must Die."" They'll be especially pleased with its foundation in reality and violent sequences which bring to mind the newer ""Before Watchmen"" stories being told about the different members of the Minutemen. It does get bogged down in dialogue in some spots. One big complaint I have is that it ends abruptly leaving you unsatisfied.

5346372,1,B009LA1QSU,"Thank the Gods I didn't pay more than a buck twenty-eight for ALL SUPERHEROES MUST DIE!  It probably didn't take that much to make the movie.  The ""superheroes"" were neither super nor heroic.  The viewer can only guess at some of the powers they were supposed to have before the villian took them away at the very start of the film, and I wonder at what kind of damage these foul-mouthed, emotionally crippled chracters could have caused if they had super powers and attempted to use them.

The villian, an actor who has played better roles in the past and the only one I recognized, was a moron that Mighty Mouse could have easily defeated, or even his powerless country cousin.  The ""heroes"" were idiots who could not save the lives of at least 10 innocent people, even killing three themselves so that they wouldn't suffer as much as the ones who were blown up right in front of the ""heroes"" earlier due to their complete incompetence.  And when one of them had been severely wounded he whined like a baby about his pain, which baffled him--one of the other ""superheroes"" had to explain that what he was feeling was pain.  It made me wonder:  apparently he had been invulnerable before his power had been taken from him by way of some kind of an injection, but if he were invulnerable how was he injected with a simple needle?  This movie would have been infinitely better if it had been written and directed by Ed Wood. At least then it would have been amusing.

I have to admit that I was surprised by the movie in that I knew it would be bad but I had no idea that it would be or even could be as awful as it is.  Thank goodness I wasn't suckered in by my craving for more superhero movies to the point of actually spending more money on this movie than I did.

The title of this movie shouldn't be ALL SUPERHEROES MUST DIE.  It should probably be THESE SUPERHEROES MUST AND ABSOLUTELY SHOULD DIE.

The other guy's suit has been constructed out of cardboard and duct tape and using a wrapping paper tube for the saber, but they've obviously gone to considerable effort to craft their materials into an outfit that's obviously Vader. Of the two, which one would you want to walk over and talk with? If you're like me, I can't wait to meet the second guy. How long did it take them to put everything together, what pattern did they use to get the shoulders and helmet to curve like that, etc. I already know the story of the first guy: they spent a bunch of money and ordered it all. Both parties like Star Wars, sure, but one has needed to be more creative in their endeavor to work around financial limitations.

I open with this because the vast majority of reviews for this film pan it for the low budget employed in its production. It looks cheap, it looks like a student film, what is this badly-acted drivel masquerading as a superhero movie? Though I was thoroughly intrigued when the trailer for it came out, the negative reviews kept me from watching it for several years. Finally, on a whim I said screw it and opted to kill a hour and a half to decide for myself. And lo and behold, I found myself pleasantly surprised.

We open on four superheroes waking up in a small town in the middle of nowhere with no memory of how they got there and sporting injection wounds from something that has robbed them of their abilities. Then a nearby television flickers to life and an arch-nemesis of theirs announces that he has arranged a little competition for them to play through. Something that he believes will finally give the caped do-gooders a small taste of the humiliation of repeated failure he's endured at their hands all these years. And now, having been reduced to four average people LARPing as superheroes, they'll be asked to make the choice of whether to save themselves or make a sacrifice to save a number of innocent hostages at the villain's mercy. Would you die to save a random doctor or mother? To save your friends or family? What if you're not even sure they'll survive if you don't? Thus begins a brutal slog as our heroes move from one challenge to another trying to do their jobs and save the day despite a deck firmly stacked against them, and not all of them will be making it to the final round.

James Remar does a stellar job as Rickshaw, their Gamemaster supervillain who couldn't be more ecstatic that his day of vengeance has finally come and relishes every opportunity to grind his opponents' faces in the dirt. His gleeful monologues are probably the best part of this fun and grotesque gauntlet of a movie, though our four heroes do a good job with what they have as well. A couple of plot points along the way didn't quite work for me (including an eyebrow raising demonstration of how they think signal triangulation works), but when the credits rolled I still had a huge grin on my face and immediately went back to rewatch bits of it again. It's certainly more than I could say for a big budget production like Batman V Superman or Age of Ultron.

Long story short, forget the haters and give it a shot. Its budgetary constraints are clear in every shot, but it's equally clear that it was made with love and has a few nifty twists on the superhero genre to offer along the way. If low budget productions like El Mariachi and Clerks can win our hearts, we can certainly give All Superheroes Must Die a fighting chance.",1489276800,,3723,4.519287833827893
