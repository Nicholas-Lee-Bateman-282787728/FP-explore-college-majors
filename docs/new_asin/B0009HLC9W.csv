2290794,4,B0009HLC9W,This was a great movie. My grandchildren really enjoyed it even though they don't understand spanish. Thanks to the english translation that they read at the bottom. It was a descent movie without all the cursing and violence.,1268006400,2,226,4.973684210526316
2290795,4,B0009HLC9W,"A great movie for teenagers.  It has all the elements that appeal to teenagers:  cool songs, piercings & spiky hair, dance, problems, dreams come true.  Despite the cover, it uses real people, not caricatures.  There is nothing objectionable in the movie that would make it inappropriate for a general audience.  The only drawback is that the English subtitles cannot be turned off.  To resolve this issue, tape a long 4""strip of paper across the bottom of the TV screen.  (If you are lucky enough to have the equipment to show it on a larger screen, your paper will have to be bigger.)",1257292800,18,586,4.686274509803922
2290796,5,B0009HLC9W,"This is a film from Argentina that is very appealing to teens.  It's about 5 girls who meet up and form a band.  As I understand it, the 5 girls were actual contestants in an Idol type reality show that brought people together and put them into bands.  I don't believe their band is still together now, but the girls do have good voices and go together well.  Here is the website about the movie.  [...]  This is NOT about the reality show or their true story, but is merely a movie about how fate brought five girls together to form a band.

There are several gags running through from one girl who is constantly getting splashed by cars going by to a huge dog that terrorizes the local Chinese delivery man.

I'm a high school Spanish teacher and my high school girls LOVE this movie to the point where several begged me to buy it from Amazon so they could buy it from me.  It's not a real deep movie, but it's light-hearted and fun, with clean teen humor.  There are only a couple of bad words in the subtitles in one place.  I've watched it several times (many different classes watched it during the day) and I still think it's fun to watch.",1197417600,83,1146,4.283720930232558
2290797,4,B0009HLC9W,"Upbeat plot, liked all the intersecting character's stories. As a non-native Spanish speaker, the speed at which the characters talked made difficult to understand just by listening--I was thankful for the subtitles (although they zoom by pretty quickly in some scenes).",1355702400,,270,5.609756097560975
2290798,3,B0009HLC9W,"There's hardly any surprises except at the end when they got noticed in a clever way.

I think the movie would have been better without the silly chinese grocer because the movie could have cut it out and you wouldn't miss it.",1346284800,,226,4.380952380952381
2290799,4,B0009HLC9W,"I wanted a movie for my students to watch end of year while I did oral interviews with students one-on-one.  I wanted to give them a movie that they hadn't been exposed to, that one be of interest to them.  I was hoping that they'd be able to understand a bit of the Spanish while the English subtitles played, but I don't think that was the case.  They speak fast and don't enunciate...but the students really enjoyed it.  They said it was Spice Girls meet Cheetah Girls.  Good purchase for classroom...these are 11th graders.",1341532800,2,527,4.5638297872340425
2290800,5,B0009HLC9W,"My middle school Spanish students just love this film.  It has a story similar enough to Disney channel musicals that it appeals to young teens.  The language and storyline are clean enough in my opinion to carry a G or maybe PG movie.  One dance scene struck the students as a bit ""pole dancer""-ish LOL but I honestly didn't think it was so racy.  The belly shirt fashions and pierced belly buttons had my girls whispering and giggling a bit... but beyond that it's very tame.  Honestly it's really difficult to find Spanish speaking films to present to this age group without raising eyebrows.  Still I found this a much better alternative to the dubbed Disney that so frequently substitutes for cine hispanohablante in the classroom.",1328140800,4,736,4.801587301587301
2290801,5,B0009HLC9W,This is a very cute movie. I'm a Spanish teacher and I use it in class and the kids love it. For this price it's a great buy.,1325203200,2,125,3.5
2290802,5,B0009HLC9W,I enjoyed this movie and so did my daughter.  I haven't shown it to my students yet but I think they will enjoy it too.  I'm glad they have the subtitles on the movie because they talk so fast and I'm afraid my Spanish I students won't be able to keep up. The music was also enjoyable.,1318291200,,285,3.982456140350877
2290803,5,B0009HLC9W,My high school students reluctantly wanted to switch my Spanish class to finish watching the movie.  A lot of vocabulary is used there.  Only thing is that it has this Argentinan accent and they talked so fast that a lot of students relied only on the English subtitles.  But it was a good movie with a valuable lesson.,1309996800,,319,4.4655172413793105
2290804,3,B0009HLC9W,It's a little silly but it is good for Spanish classes. They'll be in to it despite the silliness and bad acting.,1296691200,,113,4.181818181818182
2290805,4,B0009HLC9W,"Bought this movie and showed it to high school Spanish classes.  The students made fun of elements and compared the movie to the Spice Girls, but...they also seemed to enjoy it.  The ""cheesy but highly entertaining"" comment came from a senior.  Useful for exposing students to a different type of Spanish and to challenge some of their stereotypes about Latin America.",1274400000,,368,5.0
2290806,4,B0009HLC9W,I am showing this film to high school students. They relate to the characters and are fascinated by the story.,1273881600,13,110,4.55

8060882,4,B0009HLC9W,This family friendly movie is good for everyone who likes music and adventure. I will use in my classroom to see how my students like it.,1389657600,,137,4.3076923076923075

8060884,4,B0009HLC9W,"Used it for my high school Spanish Class.  They enjoyed it, especially the music.  They like the fact that these are actual singers who play instruments but they are bummed that Grupo Bandanas broke up.",1367452800,,202,4.742857142857143
8060885,3,B0009HLC9W,"Cute movie, a little too fast on the spanish for a Spanish 1 class.  Girls enjoy it more than boys.",1364860800,2,99,3.95
