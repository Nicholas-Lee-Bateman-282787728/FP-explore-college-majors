3715700,4,B001L4L9C2,"No, they couldn't afford Jim Carrey, nor are they brilliant film editors. But here you have a truly heartfelt tribute to an enigmatic and challenging artist, and with some memorable footage and intrepid interviewing. The documentary starts at the purported grave site of the late performer, and carries the viewer along on a cross-country investigation with a college road-trip feel. The filmmakers visit the New Mexico hermitage where Andy Kaufman sightings have been reported, and interview Andy's brother Michael in his home where he displays some of Andy's memorabilia. Yes, some of the stock footage is old and tired, and there are too many still shots with deadpan voiceover delivery. But there is enough unique material here to make it worth the time.

As the title implies, the filmmakers spend the bulk of the film considering the theories and counter-theories about Andy's passing, and though they finally come down on one side, avoid heavy-handed dogmatism.

If still think Andy Kaufman was someone special, and you feel some kindred spirit with others who do too, give this little film a chance.",1386288000,3,1107,5.144444444444445
3715701,1,B001L4L9C2,"Im a Kaufman fan, this does nothing to further my interest in the man. Full of old footage and conspiracy theory on faked death. Don't waste your time",1382918400,,150,4.392857142857143
3715702,2,B001L4L9C2,"It was interesting reminiscing but I don't know the point of this movie.  There are things like the visit to the Lama Foundation, and talking about websites that lead to speculating Andy is alive but then all that is chucked after about an hour or so and it's concluded Andy Kaufman did really die-- which everyone already knows. It would have been interesting if he hadn't and it was really faked.  Sadly, it wasn't.",1378425600,,417,4.621621621621622
3715703,5,B001L4L9C2,"I really liked this! It contained some insight from a few of Andy's friends and family that you can't find somewhere else. It was clearly low-budget, but that only added to its sincerity for me. It's not a feel-good, grab the popcorn romcom (see: Man On The Moon), so don't expect that. It's very straight forward, honest and intriguing. It definitely kept me wondering... I recommend this for anyone who's actually interested in this topic - and not just looking for something fun to watch.",1370390400,,491,4.788235294117647
3715704,1,B001L4L9C2,"I'm not sure how you can make Andy's life/career boring, but this guy made it happen.  From the sound of his monotone narration to the horrible black and white stills and video, it was all a waste of time.  I've seen better Andy bios on tv, and I didn't learn anything new.  Sorry..can't recommend.",1369353600,,298,4.481481481481482
3715705,4,B001L4L9C2,I agree with the above reviewer but I had a problem hearing what the narrator was saying in many parts. He talks over the audio track in a low monotone. At times it sounds like he is whispering. The background audio overpowers what he is saying in places. It was annoying. Yet I enjoyed the overall content.,1244678400,3,307,4.4035087719298245
3715706,5,B001L4L9C2,"You'd hope that anyone who does a documentary does it because they really care about the subject matter and because they feel it's important to share whatever story it is that's contained within the subject of the documentary.  In this, The Death of Andy Kaufmann does not disappoint but rather excels wonderfully!  The director/writer of the the documentary might even be said to have an odd reverence for Andy Kaufmann which I find to be quite refreshing.

The film does not have the 'overly-perfect' feel of a Hollywood movie - this is its main strength.  This is apparent in two different ways: the visual aspect, and the story aspect.

Visually, it's clear that this movie was not shot on top-of-the-line equipment by any means.  A lot of the footage is simple hand-held video following Chris around as he explores different areas of the country and as he speaks with friends and family of Andy, including a wonderful interview with Andy's brother Michael.  What's fantastic about this (the 'lower-quality' of the record equipment) is that it does not detract away from the story at all - it adds to the realism of an honest search: not the 'we know everything' of Hollywoodism.

Adding to the honesty of the documentary is that it becomes clear that Maloney didn't have an overall agenda for the film as far as his conclusions go: the documentary really serves as an active search.

If you're at all interested in the story and history of Andy Kaufman, I strongly recommend that you pick up this wonderful documentary by a person who truly cares about the Andy that we might not all know...",1227484800,9,1596,4.774545454545454
8326541,4,B001L4L9C2,"While it would have benefited from the hiring of a professional narrator, and maybe editor - the content of this film is well researched and well argued. It presents both sides of the ""Did Andy fake his own death?"" argument as fairly and completely as possible, and the logic is sound. I liked it, and I learned a bit about Andy as well.",1512777600,,337,4.365079365079365
8326542,3,B001L4L9C2,"Great footage and concept... the narrator however is a human sleeping pill. What a boring soundtrack. The man makes you wish you were with Andy in person, and you went to where he is..

For free in Prime, it's not bad. Had I paid for it... I would have been sad.. and for this I am glad.",1454976000,,287,4.035087719298246
8326543,5,B001L4L9C2,"A thoughtful & loving look at Andy's death. Great interview with his brother. Please familiarize yourself with Andy Kaufman's life and work before viewing this documentary. If you love Andy's work, then I suggest watching it if you're not the type who is overly critical of lower budget documentaries. I found it very fascinating and well-written. Kudos to the filmmakers for exploring all angles thoroughly and for treating the subject with the respect that he deserves.",1448409600,,471,5.2105263157894735
8326544,3,B001L4L9C2,"Low key and somewhat repetitive.  The filmmaker had good intentions, and a fascinating subject, but failed to generate any real excitement or curiosity.",1448064000,,152,5.608695652173913
8326545,2,B001L4L9C2,Boring. Very boring.  This documentary pretty much is not worth the $2.00 on the rental.,1447027200,,88,4.866666666666666
8326546,2,B001L4L9C2,Poor sound quality..interesting story that still leaves you wondering..,1444176000,,71,7.0
8326547,1,B001L4L9C2,"Less informative than a Wikipedia article with production values comparable to security camera footage. The narrator sounds like he has a cold, or is very sad.",1443139200,,159,5.153846153846154
8326548,4,B001L4L9C2,"Reviewer Brian Anthony (below, in 2013 reviews, ""Pass an Hour (or so) with Andy Kaufman Both Living and Dead,"" said it best. I won't repeat what he wrote, but if you are a fan of Kaufman, that artist of the surreal, or are interested in the ways we imagine that certain people who are dead might not be (Anastasia, Elvis, Buckwheat, Jesus), this is worth a watch.  Nothing slick about the production, but a sensitive exploration.",1412726400,,429,4.644736842105263
8326549,2,B001L4L9C2,"I mean, it had some interesting insights into the mystery of Kaufman's death, but too often we go into territory that is too pat and simplistic.  Not enough examples of Kaufman's art and the ending is particularly maudlin.",1401148800,,222,4.842105263157895
8326550,3,B001L4L9C2,I loved the comedic genius of Andy Kaufman but found this very low budget film very disappointing.  The addition of more clips from hs peformances would have added to the entertainment value.  Bad photography and very poor treatment of a great performer.,1387670400,,254,5.023809523809524
