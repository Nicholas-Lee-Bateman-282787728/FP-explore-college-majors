796665,4,6304163754,"This ppv was one of wcw's more memorable basically because of one tremendous visual in the human torch match between Sting and Vampiro. I don't know what the kid earlier was thinking when he said sting fell 75 ft. It was more like 25! 30 at the very mostbut good none the less, even there was a stunt double it seems. The tables match between Shane Douglas and the Wall is not bad either and the ladder bump is pretty cool. Once again the kid earlier said they were on a ladder 25 ft. Try 12-15 ft! The title match between Jarrett and Nash was not bad but it got a little annoying with lots of New Blood members outside against Nash. The goldberg heel turn was surprising but i don't know if it went over as well as wcw would have wanted. The ambulance match is the other one of mention with some nice spots and Kanyon turning on DDP, who's opponent was ""Career Killer"" Mike Awesome. There was also some women in this ppv- Ms. Hancock, Kimberly, Major Gunns. Under card matches were average, unlike most, so I have to say this ppv was pretty good!",985737600,,1047,4.292929292929293

If you're a die-hard wcw fan you'd probably get disappointed since the Bischoff/Russo era was supposed to turn things around so if you want my advice...RENT IT FIRST then make the desicion.,1036368000,2,513,4.840909090909091

796820,2,6304163754,"This PPV wasn't the best WCW ever did, but it DID have some high spots:
The only 2 things that i found appealing about this PPV were The match between Sting and Vampiro and the match between The Wall, and Shane Douglas. Both had some good and sick bumps (OMG!), and great endings. 8/10 for both matches. I'll just say one thing: Sting IS set on fier, and it gets ugly after that!!!
Now...come on. 50 BUCKS? That's gonna go down in my journal as the biggest piece of (...) ever. If you really wanna get this tape...PLEASE WAIT!!!!

1.) WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match: Lt. Loco w/Misfits In Action (MIA) vs Disco Inferno w/The Filthy Animals

Basic Cruiserweight match with nothing to get hyped about. Sloppy and chaotic finish that sees an old guy named Paton come to ringside and starts hitting on Tygress. Paton gets shoved down by Konnan for flirting with Tygress and this causes the Filthy Animals to get into a commotion with MIA, causing the referee to get distracted. Amidst all this, Juventud Guerrera jumps in behind the referee's back and lays out Loco. He goes for the Juicy Elbow (cheap variation of The People's Elbow) but misses. Disco hits the Last Dance (cheap variation of the Stunner. Man did all these WCW guys just still finishers from the WWF guys back then). Cajun comes in--and in clear view of the referee lays out Disco with his finisher before draping Loco's arm over Disco. The referee makes nothing of it and makes the pin for Loco to retain. The Filthy Animals hit the ring after the match and attack MIA. Major Gunns, looking hot as usual back then, takes off her shirt to get a reaction from the crowd and gives Paton mouth-to-mouth CPR to revive him, who was knocked unconscious during the assault by F.A. Paton grabs Major Gunns, forces their bodies together and tries to have his way with her, but he's pulled off by MIA

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) #1 Contenders Match The Mamalukes vs Kronik

Another basic match-up with not much going on. Both teams consist of big, built men. I mean it was decent action but it doesn't get much better than that. For some weird and unknown reason, Vito decides to wrestle with the Hardcore Championship around his waist. Brian Adams ends up ripping the title off of Vito and tossing it to the outside. Johnny ends up getting the tag where he tries to leap the rope for a move and botches. He tries it again and tries to dive off on to Adams but misses. Johnny ends up getting beat up Kronik while Vito is busy polishing the Hardcore Title. Stamboli gets hit with the High Tide from Kronik and Brian makes the pin for the win. Boring match. Nothing worth mentioning other than teasing some dissension with the Mamalukes

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Pamela Paulshock interviews DDP backstage about his upcoming Ambulance Match with Mike Awesome who threatened to end his career like he did Kanyon's. DDP insults Pamela before cutting a generic promo taking jabs at Bischoff and Kimberly saying they don't have him beat. You'd think that with the match just moments away they would've given DDP a better scripted promo to really hype and sell the match. But this was the Russo Era of WCW, so it should be expected

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Ambulance Match: DDP vs Mike Awesome

DDP brought Kanyon, who was in a wheelchair and wearing a halo brace, to the entrance ramp to watch the match. For whatever reason, Awesome was already in the ring. The match starts off with some back and forth action with Page and Awesome but Awesome ends up getting the offense. There comes a spot with Awesome, Awesome Bombing Page through a table, leading to EMTs picking up Page and putting him on a stretcher. But wait; I thought this was an Ambulance Match, not a Stretcher Match. Anyways, Page ends up rolling off the stretcher and slowly goes back to the ring where Awesome demolishes him with a steel chair. Awesome follows up with 2 crushing top rope splashes on Page and attempts a third on the steel chair but Page moves out of the way before Awesome can connect. Kimberly runs down with some huge pipe and whacks Page in the back with it. Miss Hancock shows walking with sass down the ramp, grabs Kimberly by the hair and forcefully drags her to the back. Awesome attempts a move off the turnbuckle but DDP gets in a low blow and performs the Diamond Cutter off the top turnbuckle. DDP loads Awesome on the stretcher and EMTs begin rolling him away. Suddenly Eric Bischoff comes out with a steel chair and threatens to hit Kanyon with it but DDP knocks him down. Suddenly Kanyon rips the halo off his neck, ""miraculously"" rises from the wheelchair and gives DDP a Diamond Cutter right off the stage. Kanyon rips off the DDP shirt to reveal a New Blood t-shirt. Kanyon pushes Awesome off the stretcher, puts DDP on it, and DDP is loaded in to the Ambulance. It was a good match that could've gone on a few minutes longer but the typical 2000 ""Russo swerve"" crap ruined the match.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Boot Camp Match: GI Bro vs Shawn Stasiak

This is pretty much a Last Man Standing Match as the only way to win is to beat your opponent bad enough that they can't get up by the 10 count. Slow match that had decent grapples and strikes here and there. There was a slight ""boring"" chant from fans during the match and I can't say I blame them. Chuck Palumbo interferes near the end but gets taken out by Booker.  Booker wins the Flex Kick on Stasiak

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Mean Gene finds Kanyon backstage and asks him why he turned on DDP. Kanyon says that when he was in the hospital, no one visited him more than Eric Bischoff who told Kanyon that all he had to do to get DDP's spot in the company was take him out. Mean Gene shows Kanyon footage of DDP exiting the ambulance moments after the match that also contained background footage of Goldberg's monster truck pulling into the arena parking lot. Kanyon says he's ""positive"" he put DDP out

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Tables Match: Shane Douglas vs The Wall

Shane cuts a fairly good heel promo, ripping into the Baltimore crowd before changing the Tables Match to a Best of 5 Tables Match (only in WCW). We get some good action with Douglas and The Wall. The Wall puts Douglas through the first 2 tables. One with a Chokeslam and the other with a back suplex. Suddenly on commentary we're told that going through 3 tables equates to a Best of 5 Tables Match. Apparently the people in power at WCW didn't know basic match. I'm not sure how going through 3 tables means you win a best of 5 Tables match. The match spills over near the entrance ramp where a ladder randomly lays set up in front of an equally stack of tables. Hmm. Not like that won't play an outcome in the match. The two decide to climb the ladder where Douglas uses a pair of brass knuckles to knock The Wall off the ladder through the stack of tables for the win. Not a bad match but it made no sense to be called a Best of 5 when it turned out to be a Best of 3.

Hulk Hogan is shown pulling into the parking lot in his ring gear. Okay then.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WCW US Championship Asylum Match: Tank Abbot and Rick Steiner vs Scott Steiner w/The Freaks

Originally supposed to be a one-on-one match between Abbot and Scott quickly becomes a Handicap Match per orders of Eric Bischoff due to The Asylum Match being one of Scott's specialties. Scott controls Abbot from the moment the match begins. Rick comes to the ring and beats down Scott as The Asylum is lowered. Rick and Abbot spend the first couple minutes beating down Steiner until Rick suddenly gets a change of heart and decides he doesn't want to beat up Scott anymore and takes a punch from Abbot. Scott cracks Abbot in the head with a chain and locks on the Steiner Recliner. Abbot gives up immediately and Scott retains the title.

Hulk Hogan cuts a pre-match promo backstage with Mean Gene on his match with Billy Kidman and says that his Hollywood persona hasn't gone anywhere and we'll see it in full force during his match

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) Retirement Match: Billy Kidman vs Hollywood Hulk Hogan  (Special Referee: Horace Hogan)

Hogan pretty much dominates Kidman for the first 5 minutes of the match, slowly beating him around the ring and around ringside. Horace supposedly calls the match right down the middle but doesn't disqualify Hogan when he blatantly low blows Kidman and then whips him with his leather belt. There comes a moment on the outside when Hogan attempts to use a steel chair on Kidman but Kidman dropkicks the chair into Hogan's face and which bounced off the steel barricade, almost hitting a couple of fans in the face. Good thing it didn't. That would've been a hefty lawsuit with WCW losing more money than they already at at this time. Kidman gets in control and starts assaulting Hogan with the chair. So either this is a No DQ match that we weren't told about or Horace is just a really bad referee. Kidman beats down Hogan for the next couple minutes before Hogan does his ""Hulk up"" comeback and gets back on the offensive side. Nice spot with Hogan hiptossing Kidman through the announcer's table at ringside. Once the action gets back in the ring, Torrie Wilson comes to ringside and passes Hogan a pair of brass knuckles. Kidman pushes Hogan into Torrie who goes flying off the apron and bashes Hogan's head in with the knucks and gets a nearfall. Kidman knocks Horace out with the knuckles, Torrie lowblows Kidman, Hogan retrieves the knuckles and knocks Kidman's brains out with it. Hogan makes the pin and Horace makes the count, awarding Hulk the win

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Retirement Match: David Flair w/Vince Russo vs Ric Flair

Before the match began, the Flair Family came to ringside and sat front row to watch the match. The second retirement match of the night kicks off with some slow basic grapples from David and Ric. Ric gets in some offense about 10 minutes later and gives David some stiff shots in the corner with punches and extra loud and hard knife edge chops. Ric goes on a big chopping offense but David manages to knock Ric out of the ring, where Vince Russo assaults him with the baseball bat while David distracts referee Charles Robinson. Russo handcuffs Flair before tossing him back in the ring where David gets Ric in the Figure 4. Ric gets to the ropes and David beats down on Ric, causing Robinson to have to pull David off. While Robinson takes care of David, Russo starts choking Ric with the baseball bat, causing young Reid Flair to run over and try to stop Russo but he shoves him down. Reid retaliates with a low blow on Russo. Reid manages to swipe the handcuff keys from Russo and hands them to Robinson who uncuffs Flair. Ric makes the comeback against David, while Ashley (or Charlotte as most know her today) hops the barricade and handcuffs Russo, causing Russo to cuss her out. Ric ends up getting David to tap to the Figure 4 Leglock for the win. Ric attacks Russo after the match with a chop and leaves with the family. A pissed off Russo gets a mic and declares that tomorrow night on Nitro he'll retire Ric himself

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Human Torch Match: Vampiro vs Sting

Pretty much WCW's version of an Inferno Match, only rather than the ring being surrounded by fire, you legitimately had to light your opponent on fire with the use of a torch. Sting's music plays but instead of coming down to the ring, he's at the top of the stage's scaffold and pulls the torch up there with him. He tells Vampiro if he wants to torch him, he has to join him at the top of the scaffold. Vampiro refuses to go up there, forcing Sting to repel down to the arena floor and come to the ring where he Vampiro attacks him but Sting gets the upperhand. Sting misses a Stinger Splash and Vampiro begins dousing Sting with gasoline. Sting fights back and the two begin brawling up near the entrance ramp. Vampiro begins climbing the stage to the top of the scaffold and Sting goes after him. As soon as Sting meets Vampiro at the top of the scaffold, the lights go out and lights begin flashing, making it hard to see anything that's happening. Vampiro jumps Sting at the top of the scaffold and the two begin brawling atop the scaffold. All the while this is happening, some cheap $10 thunder sound effect is blared throughout the arena that sounds more like a garbage truck slamming down a WM trash compactor. Vampiro eventually gets the upperhand, grabs the torch and sets the Sting stunt double ablaze. ""Sting"" falls a good 40 feet off the stage scaffold, crashing at the bottom, making Vampiro the winner of the match. This marked the final match of the Sting/Vampiro feud and it was a fairly nice match to end it. The Sting/Vampiro feud was one of my favorite WCW feuds

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Pamela Paulshock goes in Eric Bischoff's office, asking him where the big surprise is that he hyped. Bischoff tells her there is no surprise and tells her to get out of his office. Man, looking back on it, half of the WCW roster treated that poor Paulshock woman poorly

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match: Kevin Nash vs Jeff Jarrett (c)

The Cat comes out before the match and announces that he's the referee for the match. Nothing special about this match. The main talk of this match was Goldberg. Not Nash, not Jarrett, not the WCW Championship, but Goldberg. The match spills into the crowd during the early minutes of the match and by the time they get back to the ring, Nash is jumped by The Filthy Animals who attacks his knee with a steel chair. Jarrett works over Nash's legs for the next 5 minutes or so although it seemed much longer than that. Eventually the typical interferences happen, making the match extremely chaotic and sloppy and confusing. The Filthy Animals return and get attacked by Nash. Rick Steiner comes out and attacks Nash, despite doing some sort of face turn earlier in the night. Tank Abbot comes out after Rick, but Scott Steiner attacks Abbot and brawls with him to the back. Nothing is making sense. The Animals attack Nash but are stopped in their tracks when they hear the engine of Goldberg's monster truck pull into the arena. Goldberg comes to the ring to a big pop from the crowd and just when you thought he was going to Spear Jarrett *RUSSO SWERVE* Goldberg turns heel and Spears Nash instead. Jarrett pins Nash to retain the title. Goldberg hugs Russo and Bischoff, signifying he's joined the New Blood faction. Trash fills the ring as the New Blood stands tall to end the final WCW Great American Bash PPV. So that's it. WCW turned their biggest and most popular star of the late 90s and early 00s heel. Bravo.

Overall: For the second year in a row, WCW produced a less than stellar Great American Bash PPV. Way too much nonsense going on with overhyped matches and screwed up finishes. But hey, when you get Vince Russo as the head booker of the company, this is what you get. The only good match from this PPV was Sting vs Vampiro. DDP vs Mike Awesome could've been on the list if it hadn't been tarnished with a Russo swerve. Then to top off the horrible PPV, you turn Goldberg heel. WCW would come to learn that Goldberg being heel wasn't the right route and would turn face 2 months later, but by then it was too little too late. Crap, crap, and mega crap is the only way to describe this PPV.",1435968000,,16665,5.090509344082081
7863414,4,6304163754,"Thanks again to the WWE Network, I was able to check out another WCW event. This was memorable for many reasons as this was the event that really set in the stone the direction that WCW was going to head into the coming future that would result in the change of their product such as establishing the cruiserweight division, the reformation of a staple, the use of celebrities in matches which would become a tradition for WCW but the bigger story was the appearances of Scott Hall & Kevin Nash (who were unnamed at the time) making sporadic appearances in order to start a war...which lead to the formation of the nWo.

The Steiner Brothers vs Fire & Ice. For those that don't remember, Fire & Ice was the team of Scott Norton & Ice Train and according to Tony Shavione & Dusty Rhodes, this was the result of a series of matches between these two teams that resulted in no finishes with the stipulation added that there must be a winner. By looking all four of these guys, you can tell that this was going to be hard hitting & it was as everyone wasn't going easy on each other with each team trading offense. Keep an eye on the finish as you see a botched frankensteiner that still looked painful on impact.

WCW United States Champion Konnan vs El Gato. It was during this time in WCW that Konnan had been receiving a push as the United States Champion before he had entered the Dungeon of Doom or the New World Order while for those hardcore fans, Gato was originally one of the members of the Orient Express in the early `90s of WWF. For the most part, this was a dominate showcase for Konnan as he out wrestled and controlled the flow of the match with Gato getting in a bit of offense here and there.

DDP vs Marcus Bagwell. DDP was coming his victory last month in BattleBowl so this was a match set up to keep that momentum going. This was an average match that really had Page rely more on heel tactics and do little things to keep his character evolving while Bagwell still brought the fight to Page. One interesting aspect to notice is that even though his big push didn't start till later on in the year, DDP was receiving positive reactions from the crowd despite being a heel here.

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Dean Malenko vs Rey Mysterio. This was a historic match for so many reasons in that this was the first cruiserweight title defense on a WCW PPV in a long time, this was Rey Mysterio's WCW debut and also the match that put the cruiserweight division on the map in WCW. Mike Tenay joined to do the commentary here as both men started off at a fast pace in the early moments with both men reaching stalemates with one another before Malenko was able to establish control. Malenko was able to work the arm of Mysterio before going to the leg in order to keep Mysterio on the ground before Rey was able to build enough momentum with his high flying offense before it was one high risk move too many that open the door for Malenko. This was a classic cruiserweight encounter that stole the show here to the point to where this match was being put over on the following Nitro.

Big Bubba vs John Tenta. For those that don't remember, John Tena is the former Earthquake/Shark persona while Big Bubba is the former Big Bossman. Past that fact, this was a really slow & dull match to follow the previous bout but at least it was kept short.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Chris Benoit vs Kevin Sullivan. This was another historic moment as this was the beginning of a feud that not only occurred in the business but also affected the personal lives of both men here. This was a fight from the opening bell as both men just traded fists and being aggressive to the point where the referee didn't even try to maintain order and just let them go. They brawl from the entrance way all the way to back stage area and even into the bathroom before they returned back to the ring. However, the most memorable moment of this match occurred after the match with the appearance of Arn Anderson to illustrate where the rest of the Horsemen were standing by.

Sting vs Lord Steven Regal. Both men started off evenly matched with Regal being able to take control by working over Sting's arm. Sting was able to return the favor by continuing to wrestle Regal's game but also attempting to pick the pace up with the story of him trying to oust maneuver Regal.  Regal was intent on keeping Sting grounded by breaking his momentum by rolling to the outside but always finding a counter hold to Sting's offense allowing him to control the wrestling the way that Regal knows how. This is one of those matches that I would call a ""sleeper"" match as Regal was able to bring out the technical wrestling side out of Sting that we don't normally see while also putting a wrestling clinic in his own right.

Ric Flair & Arn Anderson vs Steve McMichael & Kevin Greene. A few points to make about this match: Bobby Heenan had returned as a one night manager/coach  for the Flair/Anderson team along with also having Woman & Miss Elizabeth at ringside, Randy Savage was the official coach for the McMichael/Greene team while also having their wives in their corner at ringside including Miss Debra McMichael. McMichael & Greene were able to surprise the Horsemen in the early stages by showing more ability than what was thought along with stopping their offensive momentum with football tackles. The Horsemen were eventually able to regain control & show their teamwork by working over one member at a team as well as bringing in all the heel tag team tactics. However, the big story here was when the action got out of control that resulted in the women taking off only to return with an offer that lead to the FOURTH Horsemen being introduced to the group.

Right around here was the moment that this event is remembered for as Eric Bischoff was set to interview The Outsiders to inform them for their challenge being answered at the next PPV, Bash At The Beach only for the response to be Kevin Nash powerbombing Bischoff off the stage. This was truly a big moment & the kick off to one of the most shocking WCW moments a month later.

WCW Champion The Giant vs Lex Luger. Luger was the current Television Champion as well as one half of the WCW Tag Team Champions so he was looking for the triple crown here as well as revenge for the Giant chokeslamming through a table weeks prior on Nitro. Luger started off hot, going right after the Giant before Jimmy Hart was able to get involved which brought out a close associate of Luger to take care of that issue. From there, Giant was able to dominate Luger with Luger fighting back repeatedly & even have the impossible done in attempting the Torture Rack only for that to come back to bite him in the end. This was a better match than expected going in knowing both men's styles.

In the end, this was a historic show for WCW as there was quality wrestling, entertainment, cruiserweight action, long term storylines along with developments. There were a few matches on here that weren't much but there was enough action to make this an event to check out.",1418342400,,7094,4.481424148606811
7863415,1,6304163754,"Despite all the booking tricks used to try and revitalize WCW, the promotion was struggling as they rolled into what would turn out to be their last summer. Older stars were sliding back into the top spots and nonsensical angles, gimmicks and booking decisions came to a head at this terrible event. Recently, this event has become oddly popular as two of the top matches were put on DVD by the WWE (not for good reasons either).

The main event featured Kevin Nash challenging Jeff Jarrett for the World Title in a really bad match that was over-long, over-booked and featured the worst heel turn in the company's history. I still can't figure out what they were thinking when they were booking Goldberg during his last stint with the company.

I'd tell you about the good matches on the show... But there aren't any, really. DDP and Mike Awesome had a serviceable Ambulance Match and the Human Torch match is interesting for how ridiculous and over the top the whole thing was, bit that's about it. It's too bad since that Sting/Vampiro feud was great; check out the Graveyard segment if you don't believe me.

Other than that, you've got a lot of bad matches and wasted talent at an event that had one of the more impressive lineages in wrestling. I'd say skip it since there's nothing even remotely interesting or consequential here.",1407024000,,1337,4.705128205128205
7863416,3,6304163754,"The tag team match between Fire & Ice against The Steiner Brothers was pretty good for a opener. The US title match between Konnan & El Gato was a boring mismatch. The Lord of the Ring match between DDP & Marcus Bagwell was so-so at best. The cruiserweight title match between Dean Malenko & Rey Mysterio Jr was a 4 star classic. The Big Bubba Rogers-John Tenta match was so-so in the bad region. The Falls Count Anywhere match between Chris Beniot & Kevin Sullivan was a fun & entertaining brawl. The Lord Steve Regal-Sting match was not great but pretty good. The Rick Flair/Arn Anderson vs Steve McMicheal/Kevin Greene tag team match was fun & entertaining but only story-wise. When came to the tag match wrestling-wise,it stinks. The World title match between The Giant & Sting was lackluster with no real surprises. I give this ppv a 6 out of 10.",1349568000,,851,4.605263157894737
7863417,2,6304163754,"Thanks to a free internet download (sue me), I found this old event from WCW's final year in Great American Bash 2000 where the Russo/Bischoff regime was in full effect with their ""New Blood vs. Millionaires Club"" angle of the younger wrestlers aligned with Bischoff & Russo against the people they want eliminated from WCW in the veterans & their allies of disgruntled ex-New Blood members.  Now there was a surprise promised by Bischoff & Russo for this show while Goldberg recently returned & made it clear that he would be at this PPV despite being banned from the building.

Crusierweight Champion Chavo Guerrero vs. Disqo - Chavo had his fellow members of the Misfits In Action at ringside while Disqo had his fellow Filthy Animals in his corner making this an unofficial lumberjack match as each team jumped on the member of the opposite faction when they were on the outside.  ""Pops"" then came to ringside & hit on Tygress at ringside before passing out causing the distraction allowing others to get involved in the match including Corp. Cajon to put Chavo on top of Disqo right in front of the referee who saw it but didn't do anything with the aftermath being Major Gunns (do I need to explain how she got that name?) giving ""Pops"" CPR the only way she knows how.  The actual match itself was just there as it was really short (little under 5 minutes) & was more about just continuing the war with the two factions here with all the interference while adding some attempted humor here with ""Pops.""

Kronik vs. Mamalukes - This was to determine the #1 contenders to the WCW Tag Team Titles but Vito came out to ringside wearing the Hardcore Title that was awarded to them after they helped Eric Bischoff take the title away from Terry Funk earlier in the week.  This was another match that was more about pushing a storyline than anything else as Kronik was absolutely dominate here while Vito was more focused on his Hardcore Title than the match itself as Johnny The Bull was in a majority of the time while Vito even left his corner to polish the belt at one point.

Ambulance Match: Dallas Page vs. Mike Awesome - This was the first ever Ambulance Match in history where the way to win is put your opponent in the back of the ambulance & DDP brought out Kanyon to the stage who was wearing a hilo on his head & in a wheelchair because of his injuries due to his fall off the cage at Slamboree.  Page & Awesome brawled in & out of the ring & even used chairs on each other before Awesome was able to execute the Awesome Bomb on a table through ringside.  Awesome tried to use chairs again before DDP got of the way of a big splash causing Awesome to land on the chairs.  Kimberly got involved here before Ms. Hancock (who we now know as Stacy Keibler) also got involved here neutralizing her as Page executed the Diamond Cutter off the top rope.  Eric Bischoff then appeared to attack Kanyon with Page making the save...before Page was once again swerved & had someone close to him turn on him.  This was what you would expect in this type of match during this era with a lot of interference & swerves but the match was fine for what it was.

Boot Camp Match: G.I. Bro vs. Shawn Stasiak - For those who don't know, this match itself is competed under ""Last Man Standing"" rules while Booker T was a member of the Misfits Of Action at this time & went under one of his original wrestling personas as G.I. Bro complete with him repelling into the ring.  This was just a brawl from start to finish that went in & out of the ring from the front row & the steel ramp with Stasiak's tag partner Chuck Palumbo getting involved as well.

Tables Match: Shane Douglas vs. The Wall - Before the match, Douglas was able to get a stipulation added where it was 3 out of 5 falls...or tables in this case.  The Wall was dominate here as he was able to keep putting Shane though table after table before Shane was able to go catch a break & stack up 3 tables near the stage before both men would fight above the ladder with one eventually falling off.  Unless your a fan of someone going through tables, this match wasn't anything past a filler.

Asylum Match: Scott Steiner vs. Tank Abott & Rick Steiner - For those who don't already know, this was the first (and to my memory, the only) Asylum match where it was a miniature circle cage placed inside of the ring so there was a small amount of space between you & your opponent & your only option was to just fight.  Steiner recently left the ""New Blood"" group so Russo sent Tank to take him out but added Scott's brother Rick to the match last minute.  This was nothing more than both men double teaming Scott before Tank was going to take it too far causing Rick to have a change of heart & take the hit for Scott allowing Scott to recover & get the win.  Another gimmick match that wasn't anything special as it was less than 4 minutes.

Hollywood Hogan vs. Billy Kidman - In the time between Slamboree & this rematch, Hogan returned to his ""Hollywood"" persona before Horace Hogan turned on him to join the New Blood while Kidman was openly having his problems with his girlfriend Torrie Wilson.  The special stipulations here was that Hogan would retire if he lost but would get a WCW Title at Bash At The Beach if he won with the added twist of Horace being the special referee.  Horace would call the match down the middle to the point where he would pull back Kidman from illegally choking Hogan which would bother Kidman as he thought that Horace would call the match in favor of him & kept complaining about him being fair throughout the match.  A chair did get involved with Kidman using it for a dropkick, DDT & attacking the back before Hogan got his receipts with chairshots of his own & even hip tossing Kidman through the announce table before Torrie Wilson would get involved & play a heavy factor in the outcome.  I personally enjoyed their Slamboree match more but this was another one of those cases where the match was very ""overbooked.""

Ric Flair vs. David Flair - Ric Flair would retire if he lost this match against his son as it should be noted that Vince Russo came out with David while the Flair family was at ringside.  David was a ""clip off the block"" here as he was able to do his dad's own chops & vertical suplex but Flair was able to retaliate with chopping his son both in & out of the ring.  Russo got involved with his baseball on the floor & helping David with leverage using the figure four causing people like the referee to get physical along with the Flair family to get their shots in & restrain Russo themselves.  While this match was setup to be the ""feel good"" moment for the Flair family, Flair would end up losing the rematch (and his trademark hairstyle) the next night on Nitro causing him to retire.

Human Torch Match - This was WCW's answer to the ""Inferno Match"" where there was a lit torch at the top for the stage & the way to win the match is to light your opponent on fire.  Both men fought in the ring but a mistiming by Sting allowed Vampiro to cover him in gasoline leading to both men brawling from the ring to the set to the top of where the torch was (complete with thunder & lightning effects) before the torch was eventually used causing the loser to not only go up in flames but also take a freefall dive off the top of the stage straight to the floor.  Another match that wasn't anything special past the stipulation it was designed to be.

WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Kevin Nash - Nash took the title from Jarrett weeks earlier only to hand it over to Flair the next week who lost it back to Jarrett later that night (yep, 3 world title changes in the span of a week) setting this match up but the Commissioner Ernest ""The Cat"" Miller made himself the special referee while the Filthy Animals were special ringside enforcers.  Both men started in the ring & brawled through the crowd with the Animals getting involved like Mysterio taking a chair to Nash's knee.  Jarrett proceeded to work over Nash's leg with moves like the half crab & figure four but the Animals kept getting involved with Konnan using a ringbell causing Nash to ""fight fire with fire"" by using the title belt & taking out the Animals along with The Cat too when he refused to count out Jarrett leading to more people getting involved from the Steiners to Tank Abott before Bischoff & Russo's surprise was revealed that definitely changed the face of WCW at that time.

This PPV perfectly showcased the Vince Russo era of WCW as every single match on this PPV was either a gimmick stipulation (some of them being very outrageous) or filled with a heavy amount of interference or plugging other storylines as there wasn't one quality standout wrestling match on this card.  If your a fan of the ""crash TV"" booking style that WCW was going through during this time then pick this up but besides that, this was a Great American Crash.",1339545600,3,8919,4.4158536585365855
7863418,4,6304163754,"1996 might have been one of WCW's greatest years. Monday Nitro gained a lot of momentum, they began to pull ahead of WWF in the ratings, and the legendary New World Order storyline was born. The Great American Bash saw the company at a critical point, where Scott Hall and Kevin Nash had just signed with WCW and declared war on the company. Hulk Hogan wouldn't return to action for another month (and we all know what happened when he did). At this point it was still business as usual for WCW, although the commentators made frequent references to Hall's ""you want a war?"" speech.

All right, that's it for the history lesson. Here's what went down at this great PPV. Matches are rated out of 5 stars.

MATCH #1: Fire & Ice (Scott Norton & Ice Train) vs. The Steiners

A watchable tag match between these four big guys, mostly thanks to Rick and Scott. The last few minutes were pretty lame, as the teams clearly were not on the same page and Scott hit kind of a semi-Frankensteiner on Norton for the win. I'm glad Norton got a chance as a singles star later. He was a pretty decent brawler; Ice Train was just sloppy.
WINNERS: The Steiners. RATING: *1/2

Mean Gene Okerlund (God, I miss him) interviews ""The Taskmaster"" Kevin Sullivan and Jimmy Hart in the back. Sullivan has a Falls Count Anywhere match against Chris Benoit tonight, and says he's going to exact revenge on the Four--or rather, Three--Horsemen. I don't know much about Sullivan except that he led the Dungeon of Doom, but that and his annoying persona are enough to make me dislike him.

MATCH #2 (U.S. Title): El Gato vs. Konnan[c]

I don't know who in the world El Gato is, but he wasn't very impressive here. Konnan seemed to carry the whole match, and his offense looked much crisper. I can't believe he used to wear stuff like pink tuscaderos. After Konnan hits a sunset flip powerbomb to the floor (which Gato did an awful job of setting up) and an Alley Oop from the top, that's all she wrote. I can see why Konnan became such a popular midcarder in the next few years.
WINNER AND STILL U.S. CHAMPION: Konnan. RATING: **

Backstage again with Mean Gene and Sting, who had dark hair and surfer face paint at the time. Sting is fired up about his match with Lord Steven Regal, making implications about his manhood and saying ""if there's anybody that can straighten you out...it's the Stinger, I guarantee you!""

MATCH #3: Diamond Dallas Page vs. Marcus Bagwell

Page's ""rich heel"" gimmick was really starting to take off here. Bagwell is still a generic face. Page hits him from behind, trying to get the early advantage. Bagwell counters quickly and lays in some nice offense, including a flying crossbody to the outside. Page finally takes control and works over his back. There's a really nice spot where Bagwell counters a side slam with a headscissors, which Page then counters into a powerslam. Bagwell gets his second wind. Inverted atomic drop, followed by a regular atomic drop. Page kicks out after a slingshot clothesline.

Bagwell hits his headscissor takeover and tries a fisherman's suplex, but Page holds on to the rope and hits the Diamond Cutter! One, two, three. Page wins clean, and his elevation in WCW continues. Really nice match. This was where the show started to pick up.
WINNER: DDP. RATING: ***1/2

Interview with The Giant, then the WCW champion. Next to Mean Gene and Jimmy Hart, he really looks enormous. Giant cuts an intense promo about being ""the one true immortal."" He says challenger Lex Luger won't be able to put him in the Torture Rack, and it can only end with the Chokeslam. Wow, Giant was actually scary back then.

MATCH #4 (Cruiserweight Title): Rey Mysterio, Jr. vs. Dean Malenko[c]

Mike Tenay joins Schiavone and Rhodes for this match. Mysterio is 21, and just making his WCW debut. Malenko is the man to beat in the cruiserweight division. Rey is wearing entirely too much pink. He spars with Malenko, and soon the champ takes control by attacking his left arm. Really nice ground game as Malenko lays on more punishment with moves like a Northern Lights suplex on the bad arm and a unique grapevine armbreaker.

The Iceman turns up the heat with belly to back and double underhook suplexes; Rey kicks out of both. Malenko makes a mistake and Rey shoves him between the ropes. Malenko hits the floor, accidentally taking out a cameraman! Wow. Rey does an awesome springboard 450 dive, taking out Malenko on the ramp. Back to the ring for more high-flying offense, including the West Coast Pop (although it wasn't called that in the 90s). Malenko survives it and hits a stiff powerbomb, putting his feet on the ropes to score the pin. What a match! These two might have just stolen the show.
WINNER AND STILL CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPION: Dean Malenko. RATING: ****

Speaking of titles, here's Lex Luger, the current Television Champion and World Tag Champion with Sting. He talks with Mean Gene, saying Giant has forever changed the face of WCW, but the big man's overconfidence may be his undoing tonight. Luger promises to leave with the belt. ""I'm going to have a 'belt' when all this is over with,"" Okerlund says. Funny stuff.

MATCH #5: (""Special Grudge Match""): Big Bubba Rogers w/Jimmy Hart vs. John Tenta

Big Bubba was just one of Ray Traylor's generic big-man personas in WCW. Tenta wrestled as Earthquake in WWF. Bubba plans to cut off his hair tonight, or what's left of it. Tenta comes out sans music, for some reason. Bubba assaults him right away and goes up top. Tenta pushes him off and he somersaults to the floor. Yikes! Bubba gets heaved into the ring steps.

Back in the ring, Bubba scores some right hands and an enziguri (no, seriously), knocking Tenta down a few times. Bubba attacks his knee and hits an impressive belly-to-back suplex. Bubba comes off the top and Tenta counters him into a powerslam for three. Tenta steals a pair of scissors from Jimmy Hart and snips off part of Bubba's goatee. This was kind of slow, but still not bad. At least they kept it short.
WINNER: John Tenta. RATING: **

Time to interview Steve McMichael with his wife Debra, and Kevin Greene with his wife Terri. The jocks yell about taking it to the Horsemen, and their ""coach"" Randy Savage joins the shout-fest.

MATCH #6 (Falls Count Anywhere): Chris Benoit vs. The Taskmaster (Kevin Sullivan) w/Jimmy Hart

Boy, Hart's been busy tonight. Benoit and Sullivan brawl on the ramp, but that's just the beginning. Over the rail and up the aisle, to the concourse we go. Then into the men's room, where a bunch of guys crowd in to watch. Benoit gets his head slammed in a stall door. Double stomp to the back. Sullivan tries to plant Benoit's face in one of the urinals; fortunately he counters it. They exchange trash can shots and brawl their way back to the ring area.

The Taskmaster throws Benoit down some stairs. Somehow he still fights back, so Sullivan crotches him on the rail. Benoit returns the favor a minute later, then gets a table and mounts it across one of the corners. Sullivan counters, putting him on top of it. Benoit superplexes Sullivan off the table and covers him for the win! A really fun brawl there, and the right man won. Arn Anderson runs out to stop Benoit from beating on Sullivan, but changes his mind and joins in! The fans roar with approval. The Horsemen bail out as the rest of the Dungeon hits the ring, but they definitely won this round.
WINNER: Chris Benoit. RATING: ***1/2

Back to you, Gene. Now he's got a babe on either side of him: Miss Elizabeth and Woman. I have to say, Elizabeth is always nice, but Woman was one of the hottest...well, women, in WCW history. Anderson, Benoit and Bobby Heenan come up and cut a promo about Benoit earning his stripes, and beating the football players tonight. Heenan insists that he's not scared of them, but is obviously lying.

MATCH #7: Lord Steven Regal w/Jeeves vs. Sting

Man, Sting is mega over. He goes right after Regal inside and outside. Regal is very hesitant, taking as many breaks as he can and trying to slow Sting down.
""How come you are sitting so close to me in this booth?"" Dusty Rhodes asks Schiavone out of nowhere.

""I don't know. You just now noticed that? That's been happening all night."" Tony says innocently.

Regal breaks Sting down with right hands and submission holds. He makes the mistake of trash-talking, and Sting counters a headlock into a back suplex. Regal goes back to sting's arm. Sting has occasional flurries of offense, but Regal controls most of the match. Double underhook suplex from the top, and Sting won't tap to the Regal Stretch. Regal gets frustrated; Sting wakes up for real this time, beating him down like a dog. Regal avoids the Stinger Splash, but gets back dropped and placed in the Scorpion Deathlock. Regal is forced to tap, and Sting gets an underdog win. Pretty good match there, but they almost made Regal look TOO good.
WINNER: Sting. RATING: ***

MATCH #8: WCW (Ric Flair & Arn Anderson w/Woman, Miss Elizabeth & Bobby Heenan) vs. NFL (Steve McMichael & Kevin Greene w/Debra, Terri & Randy Savage)

Both McMichael and Greene are All-Pros, but they're in unfamiliar territory here. Anderson and McMichael start with an interesting exchange, where Arn controls the tempo but Mongo surprises him with some wrestling skill. Anderson gets double-teamed and goes outside, where Randy Savage decks him. Greene tags in against Flair, but also holds his own and mocks the strut. Flair tries to take a walk, but is corraled by Savage.

Flair gets thrown around a bit, culminating in the jocks doing the Figure Four on both Horsemen. Elizabeth and Woman break up this disgrace, and chase the wives out of the ring area. Anderson DDTs Mongo, and both heels works on him. Bobby Heenan even kicks him while he's down on the outside. Low blow and a knee drop by Flair, then a double suplex. Mongo saves himself with an atomic drop on Anderson, who stumbles into Flair. Hot tag to Greene, who pulls off some basic moves on the Horsemen--even a powerslam to Flair.

Anderson chop-blocks Greene and goes after his knee. Figure Four by Flair, as Anderson and Benoit fight with Savage outside. Woman and Elizabeth reenter the ring area with Debra, who has a briefcase. Mongo opens it to find a Four Horsemen shirt and about $100,000. Greene wants a tag, but Mongo turns and knocks him out with the briefcase! Flair covers him for the win. Mongo and the Horsemen destroy Savage and celebrate. I'll guarantee you, that was a lot better than anyone thought it would be.
WINNERS: Flair & Anderson. RATING: ***

We see the now-famous segment where newcomers Scott Hall and Kevin Nash assault WCW president Eric Bischoff and powerbomb him through the set. Crazy stuff. Tony Schiavone and even the entering Lex Luger check on Bischoff as he's carried out on a stretcher. (And for some reason, Bischoff would join the nWo at the end of the year. WCW had some great ideas, but they really overdid the swerves throughout the angle. It seemed like every face in the company was turning heel for no reason and joining the nWo.)

MATCH #9 (WCW World Heavyweight Championship): Lex Luger vs. The Giant[c] w/Jimmy Hart

Jimmy Hart should have just pitched a tent next to the ring. Luger fights hard from the beginning, clotheslining Giant outside. Sleeper hold on Giant, and even Luger looks small compared to him. Hart looks like he's about to hit Luger with his megaphone from the apron, but Sting comes out and runs him off. Giant runs Luger into the corner. Luger starts getting dominated, but counters a rear chin lock with a stunner. He tries to bodyslam Giant, but can't hold him up. Slingshot dropkick to Giant, four big running forearms, a few chop blocks and Giant is down to one knee. Luger pounds on him. Giant gets hung up on the corner, and Luger kicks the hell out of his gut. With Giant already off the ground, Luger lifts him into a Torture Rack position, but again he can't hold up Giant. He collapses, and Giant puts him away with a huge chokeslam. Nothing fancy, but a pretty good main event.
WINNER AND STILL WCW WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION: The Giant. RATING: **1/2

This all added up to a very good PPV; a little overrated, but certainly one of their best in '96. We saw some really solid action for most of the night, and enough memorable moments to keep the fans watching as the company approached its boom period.",1270857600,,12373,4.662689307021569
7863419,5,6304163754,"Great American Bash 1996 was probably one of the best Pay-per-view events in the history of WCW.  Great little piece of nostalgia right here.

- Fire & Ice vs. The Steiner Brothers (3.5/5)
A good hard hitting brawl to start off the event.  An entertaining match, although Scott's Frankensteiner was a little off at the end.

- El Gato vs. Konnan (3/5)
A Decent, interesting match with Konnan taking the lead throughout.  I really have no interest in El Gato, but Konnan has some skill.

- Marcus Bagwell vs. Diamond Dallas Page (3.5/5)
I enjoyed this match.  A good little back and forth bout between the two.  I have a lot of respect for Page, and I enjoy seeing Bagwell wrestle.

- Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Dean Malenko for Cruiserweight Title (5/5)
Magnificent match where Mysterio makes his debut in WCW.  You can always expect the best out of Malenko, and these two have a classic cruiserweight confrontation.

- Big Bubba Rogers w/Jimmy Hart vs. John Tenta (1/5)
Thank goodness it's short.  May both men rest in peace.

- Kevin Sullivan w/Jimmy Hart vs. Chris Benoit (5/5)
WOW!  What a brawl!  These two battle it out all over the arena in a Falls Count Anywhere Match.  The ending is priceless.

- Lord Steven Regal w/Jeeves vs. Sting (4/5)
I thought Regal really shined in this match.  He actually almost carries the whole thing.  He shows he can be a good, hilarious heel.

- Kevin Greene & Steve McMichael w/Randy Savage, Debra McMichael, and Tara Greene vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson w/Woman, Miss Elizabeth, and Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan (5/5)
One of the most exciting matches of the night.  The ex-football players surprisingly put on a great array of wrestling, Heenan and Flair are (as always) hilarious, and there is a surprise ending to this one too!

-Scott Hall and Kevin Nash interrupt the show and attack Eric Bischoff. (Nice little treat)

-Lex Luger vs. The Giant w/Jimmy Hart for World Title (2.5/5)
A very lackluster main event.  Honestly, what would you expect.

This is definitely a classic WCW tape to add to any collection!",1229817600,,2046,4.695774647887324
7863420,5,6304163754,"While WCW isn't remembered very fondly, it did have its moments. This edition of the Great American Bash was one of them! It sure as heck beats anything that the WWE versions of the event has done! Anyway, let's get to it:

The Steiners vs. Fire & Ice (Scott Norton/Ice Train) - The Steiners were one of the best tag teams of all time! The team of Fire & Ice, had they remained together, could've been similiar to The Road Warriors only bigger and with some better wrestling skills though certainly not the level of a Bret Hart, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit or Eddie Guerrero.

The match was surprisingly dominated by F & I until near the end. Ends with Scott Steiner (back when he had black hair in a mullett fashion) doing a poorly done Frankensteiner on Scott Norton for the win. The match, otherwise, was good.

Konnan vs. El Gato (WCW U.S. Title Match) - El Gato was actually former AWA wrestler Pat Tanaka who was also known as one half of the Orient Express during his WWE in the early '90's. This match with Konnan was okay but it does feature one stiff moment when Konnan did a sunset flip to the outside on Gato, basically powerbombing him on the floor from the apron! Konan retains the U.S. title here.

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Marcus Bagwell (Lord Of The Ring Match) - This bout was for DDP's Battlebowl ring. Not great but not bad. Bagwell was not yet ""Buff"" Bagwell that we came to know later but he did show some flashes of it here. Decent bout that ends with DDP planting Bagwell with his ""Diamond Cutter.""

Dean Malenko vs. Rey Misterio Jr. (WCW Cruiserweight Title Match) - One of the best Cruiserweight bouts ever, including some of the matches that WWE has done with that same belt! No words can describe this one....SEE IT!

John Tenta vs. Big Bubba - Worst match on the card without question. Still, may both men rest in peace!

Chris Benoit vs. Kevin Sullivan - The beginning of both the on and off camera feud between Chris Benoit and Kevin Sullivan! This one's another you have to see to believe! Ends when Benoit executes a superplex off of a table from the top rope!

Such a shame that such a great talent like Benoit had to end life like he did! To his wife and son that he killed, RIP. To him, I can't say it in good conscious but I won't do the whole wishing he'd burn in the other place because that's not right either. His fate I will leave to God. Still, such a shame when you see a match like this.

Sting vs. Lord Steven Regal - Surprisingly entertaining match. I thought their styles would clash but it actually turned out good! Sting wins with his Scorpion Deathlock!

Kevin Greene & Steve ""Mongo"" McMichael vs. Ric Flair and Arn Anderson - Surprisingly entertaining as well. Granted, it was carried mostly by Flair and Anderson but McMichael and (especially) Greene did surprisingly well. Ends when Mongo turns on Greene and becomes a Horsemen!

The Giant vs. Lex Luger (WCW World Title) - Another surpriser! I figured this one would be boring but it was actually good! Though he was the rookie, The Giant (future Big Show) actually carried this match against Luger and brought out the best in him rather than the other way around! Ends with Giant giving Luger the chokeslam!

Overall, a great card and it does feature the moment when Eric Bischoff was powerbombed off the stage and through some prop by Kevin Nash when he and Scott Hall first arrived in WCW! This sets up Bash At The Beach '96 the following month and we know what went down there! Great tape to pick of as it was actually good, considering that it was WCW.",1211846400,3,3558,4.448540706605223

7863422,5,6304163754,"WOW.  The show stealer in this bad boy is Benoit/Sullivan.  You get a taste of the history of WCW by seeing a member of the horsemen face the dungeon of doom, PLUS you see a great hardcore style ""falls count anywhere match"".  Classic match, one of the best of WCW's history.  Konnan match bleh.  He and El Gato have no chemistry, and Konnan isn't that exciting.  DDP vs. Marcus(aka Buff) Bagwell almost makes this video a four.  Horrible.  Malenko vs. Mysterio lights it up like most cruiserweight matches, great match.  Regal vs. Sting was solid, in my opinion.  Sting plays a little mind games and it's really funny.  Plus, the submission moves are really good.  Tag match for the titles is decent.  Lotsa power involved.  Flair & Arn Anderson vs. Mongo & Greene wasn't a great match itself, but what was really great about the match was it entails the rebirth of the horsemen!  Luger vs. Giant was uhh, pretty much what you'd expect.  But hey, the angles, swerves, and undercard are really enjoyable, and this is dripping with historical significance.
