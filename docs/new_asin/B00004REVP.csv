Usually I find the Discover Channel's Wings Series to be rather good.  This was not the case with Wings Over Europe.
The coverage was too superficial, the footage too often seen.
There's some nice cheesy computer generated graphics which provide a ""glimpse to the future"" as the narrator puts it as he stands in a computer generated flight briefing room.  It also uses ""CD-Rom technology"" to show plane profiles and statistics (such as a plane's speed) in a separate box while old stock footage of the air war is being played.  These CD-Rom (wonders!)are pointless and are nothing but fluff.
Maybe the ""CD-Rom technology"" statement would have been impressive in 1988 but it seems corny and way out of place today.
The video starts with Hitler announcing the creation of the Luftwaffe and covers the period from Spanish Civil War to the massive Allied bombings in 1944-1945.
The video provides more of a course of events in World War II than it does of the Air War in Europe.
Bottom line:  If you know next to nothing of World War II or of the Air War, get this video...if you can find it for [$] or less.",1054339200,,1210,4.56221198156682
