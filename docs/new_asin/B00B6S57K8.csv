8563443,4,B00B6S57K8,"I have not written an Amazon review in years, but this DVD compelled me to write again, first the first reviewer is correct when he writes that these are only made for Television performances (for Televisa specifically), that is where the agreement ends because the performances are excellent and Caifanes demonstrate that not only they are the best Mexican rock band of all time but one of all the Spanish speaking world. Here is the problem I have with this DVD, I am not interested in live CD's I prefer to hear the original albums, for live performances I prefer DVD's that is why I went with this version and not the Mexican one, the problem is that the US version I bought has only 12 songs (unbelievable!). Once again US music labels demonstrate they are CHEAP. The original Mexican version has over 25 performances and a live CD, and it is sold for about the same price as the US version. I only put four stars because the performances are amazing, if you want a taster go to Youtube as many of these are posted.",1399939200,,1020,4.489247311827957
8563444,1,B00B6S57K8,"Seeing the cover of the DVD, one would thought that it would be Caifanes performing live... and they do but (at least most of the tracks) in Televisa's shows...

IT IS NOT A CONCERT OF CAIFANES",1396742400,,193,4.361111111111111
8563445,5,B00B6S57K8,"It's Caifanes so you know it's gonna be great. A collection of 12 songs performed in various live settings. If you're a Caifanes fan, this should be in your collection asap.",1391126400,,173,4.612903225806452
