If you do not want to purchase creationist jibberish, you might want to look for a different video set.  I recommend the following (in my personal order of preference):
1.  The Origins of Man ( 3 tapes)
2.  Dawn of Man  (3 tapes)
3.  Ape Man (4 tapes) [hosted by Walter Cronkite)
All are factually reasonably sound and operate from slightly different perspectives.
