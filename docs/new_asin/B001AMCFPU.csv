I truly believe there'll never be a more wonderful production as this.  This undoubtedly has got to be the ""gold standard"" for all future productions.
I just ordered a second copy, for fear that anything ever happened to the copy I have, I'll now have a backup copy for my continued enjoyment.
If you love operetta, operetta at it's best, PLEASE, give this one a look.
ENJOY!!!!",1523145600,,472,4.552941176470588

8277994,3,B001AMCFPU,apart from the tunes i was on ly enamered with the production.i found the actors where lost on the huge stage and to fill up the scene bring on the dancing girl's this production  followed the 1920's when dance was all the craze regardless of the plot and this version of the show  was for me a let down. i have seen far better productions i do not recommend this as a must but as a well i suppose so  brian p grimstrup,1482710400,,419,4.024096385542169
