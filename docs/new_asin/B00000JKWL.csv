7912506,4,B00000JKWL,"""Big Dream, Small Screen"" corrects a historical oversight by chronicling the invention and exploitation of television, focusing on its true inventor Philo T. Farnsworth.  Although not a household name like  Edision or Bell, Farnsworth's contribution would impact the world forever.  This one-hour documentary not only illustrates how Farnsworth struggled to  develop television, but how he won a major legal battle with coporate giant  RCA to patent it.  Through interviews with Farnsworth's family, friends and  colleagues and archival footage, director David Dugan captures Farnsworth's  drive and genius.  You may curse television or praise it; either way, you  must admit it's changed the world.  This film explains how that change  started.",956361600,6,745,5.73394495412844
