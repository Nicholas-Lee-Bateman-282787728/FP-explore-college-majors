8764026,5,B01GWCD0BU,"Representatives of the Vatican police now approach Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks,) who you might remember from ""The da Vinci code"". He has been told a mysterious cabal has kidnapped four Cardinals and they are threatening to kill, one an hour, unless their demands are met. Langdon being a symbologist has been requested to locate and free the Cardinals before it's too late. But what is it that they forgot to tell Langdon?

I will not go through the whole story as the bulk of the movie is the surprises that you find as the story unfolds. You will also find you have fun kibitzing with don't go here don't look there.

The movie itself makes a good sequel to the da Vinci code and the characters stay true to form. However, it is too bad if you read the book first as you will find this Langdon is more subdued, and many books characters combined are eliminated for brevity sake.

Although this is an excellent movie and brings up many thoughts and subjects on religion and science, it is still watered down compared to the book. We also find that even though Robert Langdon is in the driver's seat what we miss is the ""constantly coming back from the dead"" Robert Langdon of the book. In his attempt to make this, a more plausible story Ron Howard has turned Robert Langdon into just another symbologist when he could have been more of an Indiana Jones.

One of my favorite characters in the movie is Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino), he has a great attitude and some good one-liners.

I have only seen the Blu-Ray edition so I cannot compare against the other additions. Nevertheless, be sure to watch the added DVD extras. Some of the extras overlap each other but are still worth watching.",1495756800,,1701,4.600660066006601
