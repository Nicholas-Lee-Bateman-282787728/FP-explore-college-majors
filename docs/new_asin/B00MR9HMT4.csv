Also some robot sounding girl gives you facts (that fans would already know) in between.  Altogether it is about 40 to 50 minutes at least.  I wish they put more effort into it.  I was really excited. :(",1418083200,8,351,4.2727272727272725
6600333,1,B00MR9HMT4,"Not a movie or a good programme, just a pile of clips thrown together to rip off fans. I bought this for my daughter and she was bored in ten minutes. Avoid",1418083200,13,156,3.90625

6600339,1,B00MR9HMT4,30 minutes of very poorly thrown together footage. The narrator couldn't even pronounce the band's names correctly. This was an obvious attempt to make quick money off a currently popular band. Even the DVD case is falling apart after less than a week. Don't waste your money.,1419897600,6,276,4.8936170212765955

6600344,3,B00MR9HMT4,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas.  She has seen most of the interviews on YouTube.  Sort if disappointed that it didn't have more footage of them on their tours and music .  Not a great gift, still love the band.",1419552000,4,218,4.2682926829268295
8674245,1,B00MR9HMT4,"The toe headed broad that talks in front of the camera ruined any chance of me enjoying this. She was (is that a she?) annoying, boring, and irritating all at the same time in equal measure. I hope to never ever meet heir in person. It's a Shrieking shame that Tommy Vance & Krusher are not fans of this group of Ausie Blokes, and therefore not in this video to liven things up a bit.",1530662400,,384,4.133333333333334

8674251,4,B00MR9HMT4,I tried to watch halfway through it. Couldn't do it. These are just interviews. Guess I'll have to make it worth it.,1428796800,3,116,4.318181818181818
