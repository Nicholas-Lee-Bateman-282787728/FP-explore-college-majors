8097624,5,B000CCRX24,"The DVD is full of winning moves. They are shown full speed and then repeated at a slower speed so you can study the set up and execution. Some of the moves, like Dave Camarillo's flying arm bar (Dave was a Judo BB before taking up BJJ), are not for the novices out there, but most of the moves consist of the basics executed with good setups... all in live environments. That is the key. All of these submissions are shown in competition. If done properly, they work.
Many grapplers, who are famous today, are shown when they were at their mid point in skill level. For example you get to see Eddie Bravo and BJ Penn when they were coming up through the ranks of BJJ.

In regards to the video quality that another reviewer criticized:
If you are looking for HD, this is not it. This DVD was born from grass roots videotaping of competitions. I did not have any problems with the quality of the video. People will always be picky about something.

As for the music, I loved it, but many may find it offensive due to the explicit lyrics. Don't hesitate in buying it because of the music. You can always mute your TV and play your own music, if you don't like the tracks or have kids watching.

You won't fall asleep watching this instructional and entertaining DVD. Buy this, 101 Submissions Chapter 2, and Chapter III.

8097625,2,B000CCRX24,"Save your money.  This dvd is boring, poor quality film.  Unless you competed at this event or know someone who did you'll probably want to skip this.",1302220800,,150,4.518518518518518
8097626,5,B000CCRX24,"Excellent, exciting DVD, really some great Players here doing their best work. Flying Armbars and Dozens of other submissions shown with enough Tape to see the Set-ups. And the Soundtrack is top-notch with selections from Eazy-e, NWA, Geto Boys and others.",1243555200,,256,5.2682926829268295
8097627,4,B000CCRX24,"I enjoyed seeing the technigues displayed but do not know why they have to use such profane and obnoxious music , i had to mute out the music ..

some great action and finishes ,,good to see No Gi & Gi",1162252800,3,201,3.902439024390244
8097628,3,B000CCRX24,"I thought this was an excellent tape as far as submissions go, I like the replays and the quality video editing--it makes the tapes watchable and exciting because I do not always want to watch guys in the guard for 5 minutes at a time(that is what Pride is for).  I also like seeeing gi and no gi, makes for a good mix.  The reason I gave it three stars was the sound track...it is very low rent, mostly ghetto raps with profanity being the used in every song, which means I cannot watch it with my kids or I have to mute it.  IMHO, a soundtrack more akin to what you may find on CrossFit would better suit a BJJ video like this one.",1160611200,6,633,4.048
8097629,5,B000CCRX24,"This DVD is a helpful illustration of what really works. The grapplers in it are top notch and the matches are real. You don't have to sit through long minutes of watching someone trapped in the guard while they sit there playing it safe, instead you see only the actions leading to a tap out. Some other nice things: you see it twice in a row, so 1st time you see what happens and go ""wow"", 2nd time you can really watch for the critical error. And the DVD is divided into gi and no gi sections. Because it's just the tap out part, I was able to watch it with non-grappling friends and they were not bored as happens sometimes when I watch pride fights with them. I recommend this DVD to any grappler who wants to sharpen their skills.",1140825600,9,736,4.226950354609929
