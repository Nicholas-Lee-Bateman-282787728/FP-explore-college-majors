There are some very inspired moments. But don't buy it here. Abstract Logix has it for $24.00.",1362182400,,268,5.404761904761905
8513823,3,B007BHFTP6,"I would loved to give this 5 stars , but the recording quality in sound and picture is not up to todays standard. I have seen audience recorded bootlegs from past concerts that are much better.(anyone who has seen the Roger Waters Chicago 2010 or Zeppelin's O2 show knows what i mean).But the music performed here is just amazing : they don't make this kind of prog anymore...",1356393600,,376,4.544117647058823
8513824,1,B007BHFTP6,"A hundred and six US dollars for a single DVD,this has to be a joke. The music is absolutely stunning,but not even a hardcore fan like me will pay an axotic price like that.",1338595200,2,173,4.117647058823529
8513825,1,B007BHFTP6,"I will not comment on the performance, or the material played as we all know about it, even while I disagree that this concert should be called Reunion, being that there is only two of the original members of the band, actually playing, even less while the other original members, are still alive and kicking, and kicking really hard (Bill/Terry and Allan) and I strongly disagree also that Alex on the guitar is doing the Allan parts better than him, Allan is simply unique, and for the ones that do not understand that, just read a little bit about his work, before and after UK, nor Marco is a Bill or a Terry substitute either...period!!!! But we all know that even while not all the original members were present and not even as guests!!! It is still a very good concert and I enjoyed it immensely from the musical point of view.
Now I will concentrate my review in trying to make people who are willing to spend serious cash, like me, on this DVD, to reconsider it, as simply in my opinion is really sad while bands of that relevance, release such mediocre produced material, and I'm being really very condescending!!! The production, mix, and sound, is not up to the 2012 standards, it is not even HD (hey! but we all know that still in SD we can find good videos, just that this is not the case at all) the lighting effects are very lame, to missing, just some very poor lights on top of them, the only moment I enjoyed and I think, that was the only creative moment from that point of view, was the light behind the Jobson violin during the solo, or maybe it was a coincidence, who knows? I mean we are not watching a Kiss concert either, but the lack of proper lighting made the whole video to look almost black and white, like a vanished color copy from an old VHS tape (that would be fine, if the resolution would be good, but adding both, was a really bad idea). Also you can find 4:3, 16:9, and any other format in between in the same video, WTF....black bars on left, right, and on both sides, and suddenly a glorious 16:9, that is a joke video wise, guys are you serious? Is that what you actually want to immortalize a ""Reunion Tour"" after 30 years in the middle of 2012, even while others are releasing concerts in 3D-HD? Sound is far from being acceptable, in any of the two setups, and I do have a decent audio setup home, not a Best Buy mass market all in one box sound system, highs are tamed and rounded and bass is heavy, but not defined. It is more I made a few copies for friends, and compressed it to a DVD5, the result after 56% compression, was still the same as if you were watching a DVD9, in other words I think that it was just a poor resolution video that was inflated to fit a DVD9, not sure what the logic behind such practice is till now. BTW the menus are unacceptable.
In other words, if you can grab a copy at a decent price, it is still a good concert...Compare this to the Styx latest BD, or any of the Crossroads festivals, filmed in huge arenas, or the Asia in Japan. John Wetton knows better what is a good sound, mix and video quality, this is just this, a concert to be sold at the concert door for the hardcore fans, but nothing else, unless for a mad collector...

Also they have the nerve to call it ""Reunion"" what reunion, Eddie and John? There is no Allan Holdsworth nor Bill Brufford present, and given that both are alive and kicking not sure why they decided to call it a ""Reunion"", they were not even invited to play!!!!
Songs are well performed considering the 30+ years and the caliber of the musicians, but if you can grab it cheap, good, otherwise this is an unacceptable production...",1338422400,3,3645,4.328947368421052
8513826,5,B007BHFTP6,"I've been waiting for the reunion of this band since I last saw them in NYC palladium theater on 14th st.
got the dvd and anyone who knows or seen this band you won't be dissapointed. Eddie Jobson is a genius. what he does
with keyboards and violin is something to behold. John Wettons' singing and bass playing is on the money. Marco Minnemann
on drums you can't get better then this. guitar player Alex Machacek does allan holdsworth better than allan.
plus all the songs that you would expect are here. the sound and visual are ""great"".....get it.... you won't be dissapointed.",1336867200,2,580,4.640776699029126
