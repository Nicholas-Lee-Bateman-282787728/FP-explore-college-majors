4370580,3,B004FN25G0,"In comparison to other documentaries on the PCT, this one is kind of boring.",1419638400,,76,4.5
4370581,5,B004FN25G0,"I got it for my husband. The movie is done like any National Geographic movie - awkwardly trying to build up suspense where it isn't needed, but my husband who loves the PCT really enjoyed it.",1398297600,5,192,4.361111111111111
4370582,5,B004FN25G0,"For anyone who has ever dreamed of taking several weeks or months to go hiking this is a great documentary.  I would have to say out of the three major north south trails this is not only the toughest but one of the most spectacular.  Starting at the mexican border and winding it's way through the hot desert many don't even make it into the sierras.  They contending with extremely high elevations and possible deep snow this is not for everyone.  Mentally you have to be an extremely tough person to spend several months hiking over 2,000 miles through extreme terrain.  This documentary doesn't focus really on any hikers but more of what the PCT is about.  It's an entertaining hour for anyone who loves the outdoors and hiking.",1397952000,9,733,4.6434108527131785
4370583,5,B004FN25G0,"After hiking the Appalachian Trail I bought the National Geographic ""Appalachian Trail"" DVD (which was OK, but it went off on too many tangents).  I was reluctant to buy the NG Pacific Crest Trail. Glad I did, it is much better than the AT DVD.  I can personally identify a few things I'd like to have seen done differently with the editing - add a few topics, eliminate a few things - but overall you need this DVD in your library if you are considering hiking the PCT or are an avid long-distant hiker.  It will be a nice go-to DVD on a lazy cold winter day when you're longing to be out on a trail.
Keep on hiking!",1396137600,11,617,4.168067226890757
4370584,5,B004FN25G0,"Great video to see the true beauty of the Pacific Crest Trail. The helicopter shots were amazing, really cool to see the little trail snake its way through the mountains and valleys from such a high perspective.",1389830400,5,211,4.72972972972973
4370585,5,B004FN25G0,"I used this for our Book Club because I had chosen the book ""Wild"" by Cheryl Strayed.  Everyone enjoyed the documentary because they could see for themselves the difficulties and the beauty of the trail.  There were no pictures in the book and it was hard to visualize the geography so this brought it to life.  Everyone thanked me for showing the doc and it was only 50 minutes.",1386288000,5,379,4.463768115942029

4370588,5,B004FN25G0,"Just one more thing that I think I would love to do, but will probably never have the chance to actually do.

That being said, I do believe at some point I will be able to do some section hikes of either the AT, PCT, or CDT.

I already have the equipment I need (fuel for my fantasies),  now all I need is the situation that would allow me to do it, and I am no where near that.",1301356800,,378,3.759493670886076
