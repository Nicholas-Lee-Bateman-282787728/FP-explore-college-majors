She explains how to safely progress from one exercise to a more complex one and how to properly position so you get the most out of your exercise.  I highly recommend this instructor and her videos!  I bought - and love - her ""Foam Roller"" and ""Better Posture"" - also.",1312329600,3,423,4.384615384615385
8587037,5,B003HC9JAU,"I have retired early, so I'm on the golf course a few days a week. Like most passionate golfers, my goal over the years has been to improve my swing and the enjoyment of the game.  I've been hearing that many competitive golfers, men and women, practice Pilates to learn how to use their core muscles more efficiently, but I never tried it myself until I started working with your DVDs.  What a great Christmas gift my wife bought up for me!  (your ""Principles and Basics of Pilates"", ""Beginner Pilates in Detail"" and ""About Balance"" DVDs).  I can't believe how much of a difference these exercises are making!  After only a month of practice my abdominal muscles feel stronger, I can twist better, I am aware of tensing my neck and shoulders, I breathe more often and have more energy - my whole body feels great!

What I most like about your DVDs is that you explain things so very simply.  More than that, you give the reason for each move.  Maybe not everybody needs to know why, or what, is being worked in a given exercise, but I do.  Your demeanour is pleasant and assuring; you smile and giggle from time to time, which makes the viewer feel you're human and likeable; you give us an ""out"" (i.e. do what we can, don't strain, build toward maximum achievement, etc.); your accent is exotic, which somehow gives the viewer confidence in your ability; and you ""speak"" to your audience through eye contact.

Repetition is so important when learning the basics of any endeavour.  I am glad to see that you employ this method, as the volume of information can be overwhelming to the beginner.  In fact, you stated that at the outset.

I really like how you demonstrate the manoeuvre at the start of each segment, then break it down and explain each element.  That is perfect.  The intelligent, serious student ""gets"" that.

By the way, my wife also picked up your Foam Roller video - she loves it!  She got me to roll my back and thighs on it a few times too, and although it was painful to start, I can see how my legs and back feel looser already.  Thanks a lot for your great videos!

8587038,5,B003HC9JAU,"""Thank you for a wonderful set of DVDs! As a man, I've always been somewhat intimidated about signing up for a Pilates or Yoga class at the gym, seeing that it's mostly women who participate.  I thought one must have a degree of flexibility and core strength to engage in these classes.  One day I stumbled upon some pieces of your videos on Youtube.  I followed your instructions and was impressed by how clear and concise your cues are, and how much the few exercises you selected helped me!  The Foam Roller thigh stretches feel like ""ouch"" but they sure work.  So do the stretches you teach in your Better Posture DVD.  These are slowly changing the way I sit and move, as I remember to practice them many times a day.  I've become addicted to working with About Balance, as it's helping me focus, channel my strengths and overcome my weaknesses - not only in physical activities I enjoy but in my business, too.""",1291593600,5,917,4.5212121212121215
