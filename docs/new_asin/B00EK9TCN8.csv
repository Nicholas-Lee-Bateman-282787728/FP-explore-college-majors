8606277,5,B00EK9TCN8,"I guess it's a matter of loving horror spoofs, and this one just makes fun of itself and everything else.  I had to resort to getting the Blu-ray for a different region just to have it in full HD and not some stupid DVD of it.",1440288000,,226,3.9130434782608696

8606279,4,B00EK9TCN8,"I'm not sure why reviews are so negative; we watched it last night and laughed an awful lot.  I can't help but think this is unfortunately underrated in a very saturated genre.  As the majority of these movies are the same beaten jokes with very little direct spoofing of the movies they reference, this one went over the top without being un-entertainingly predictable.  We enjoyed the absurdity and the attention to detail setting up each reference joke before exploiting it.  I thought their research for the project showed in their writing and execution, and couldn't give it less than 3 stars just for the ridiculous one-liners alone.

I'd recommend it if you enjoy cult and horror films, good or bad, and would appreciate the possibly lesser known references.  Plus, the actors kept me interested without becoming irritating as their caricatures; I felt in on the joke with good actors playing dumb rather than giving terrible actors a pass for the sake of 'it's a joke, get it?'.  I found it reminiscent of classic Zucker timing, like ""Airplane!"" and ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", where no one took themselves seriously except when it made an awkward moment funnier.  Highly enjoyed it!",1386720000,,1187,4.959595959595959
8606280,2,B00EK9TCN8,"As you can guess, this is a spoof movie. Its gotten a fair bit of flack from reviewers here, but to be honest, it was more entertaining to watch than quite a lot of those parody movies that flooded out after the success of ""Scary Movie"". This one is a very low budget, but does that mean it can't produce a laugh?

Unfortunately, they used the best gags in the trailer. Quite frankly, the Patrick Swayze jokes worked better in the trailer than it did in the movie. There is a couple of decent laughs here and there, but by the end of the movie, I wasn't even interested in ripping a copy.

The plot, if you wanna call it that, is about a guy who hosts his own spook investigating show. Along with him is his crew, who cares about introducing them. They take to a small town he does not want to go to, just because his girlfriend wants to find small-squatch or the gobbledock or something? I couldn't get the gist of if he was trying to prove it was fake or just wasn't interested, I didn't care to pay that much attention to care... but they end up experiencing things on a very low budget. It takes shots at Paranormal Activity, Rosmary's Baby & Blair Witch. Probably a few more movies, Like I said,  I just didn't care to pay that much attention to it all.

It had a couple of laughs, so it makes it funnier than Epic Movie and that stupid Island one with Michael Jackson... but still, it's far from being as great as the real classic parody movies. VERY FAR. Put it this way, Scary Movie 5 was much funnier. And possibly even Haunted House or whatever that one the Wayans guy did. So, beware, this one might make you laugh if you watch it all, but if you turn it off in the first 10 mins, you won't be missing a must see laugh.",1372118400,,1730,4.186186186186186
8606281,1,B00EK9TCN8,"Supernatural Activity (Derek Lee Nixon, 2012)

What was the last spoof movie that was any good? I can't actually answer that question, but it certainly came before Scary Movie, team Wayans' Scream spoof that spawned an entire genre of critically-savaged, ever-worse movies that continually redefine the term ""dumb"". Worse, they've spawned second-rate imitators, and second-rate imitators of fourth- or fifth-rate movies, well, you can see where I'm going with this. While I'm not going to deny that Supernatural Activity does generate some laughs (certainly more than team Wayans has managed collectively since the death of In Living Color), this is a movie for which the phrase ""beyond stupid"" could easily have been coined, had it not existed already.

Nixon, an actor (Hallettsville) directing his first feature, gives us a presumably-comedic take on the currently-hopping horror subgenre of reality-TV-takeoffs-where-supernatural-investigators-actually-encounter-the-supernatural. And while this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever--it is bland, unfunny, stupid, and not worth a single minute of your time--I have to admit that once I started watching it, some masochistic part of me couldn't stop. And I hate myself for continuing to watch, but I did, down to the bitter, all-too-predictable end. Please don't make the same mistake I did, but be warned: if you stumble upon this on TV late one night, you'll be trapped in a situation more horrific than you'll find in any movie of the type this monstrosity is supposedly spoofing. *",1363219200,,1545,5.514767932489452
8606282,4,B00EK9TCN8,"This was a strange movie, BUT I liked it. The cons for ME: It dragged on too long, a few scenes (like the barn exorcism and bedroom scene) should have been cut entirely, and parts of the plot were just confusing or stupid. The pros for ME: I have watched many big budget/popular comedies and barely chuckled. While I didn't laugh a lot at this movie, when I did, I laughed HARD. The few big laughs that I got were totally worth me watching this movie. Andrew Pozza is a riot!!!",1358726400,,477,4.252747252747253
8606283,2,B00EK9TCN8,"""Found footage"" films are not my cup of tea but are certainly prime targets for satire.  Unfortunately, SUPERNATURAL ACTIVITY misses the mark.  While there are a couple of inspired moments, they are not enough to save the movie.  The blue-tinged take on PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is admittedly funny and the film's best moment.  Too bad this level isn't evidenced more often.  The cast of relative unknowns tries gamely but the material doesn't give them much to work with.
Satire is a difficult art form and in the wrong hands it can be disastrous.  This film is a prime example.",1356220800,,574,4.8061224489795915
