7901215,4,8996955418,"So um...my budget is now a little broken and it is all thanks to Amazon's SUJU Store!  You guys are BAD.  I LOVE THIS.  The posters are black and white and look GREAT framed.  The photo book is not bad, but I'm sad that not all of my fave members are represented.  There's no Chullie.  There's also no Kangin.

The costumes and poses are kind of boring and subdued, but all the guys look great AND how awesome is it to FINALLY be able to get SUJU photobooks and DVDs on AMAZON?  It is like thousands of dollars great.  I'm too happy.

In true SM form, the ingrish title is priceless.  The eges posing up a storm is also priceless.  Well...not really priceless.  Just fairly expensive.  So it looks like I'm putting my plans to start a family on hold for now.  If the Japanese Boys in City is on Amazon...I may NEVER be able to afford kids.

There's a DVD and a calendar and the photobook is nicely bound.  The photography is nice as well.  Shindong had lost weight to go to Paris and he looks super cute here.  If there had been more craziness instead of the somewhat boring poses, and more Youngwoon, I'd have given this 5 stars.",1399852800,,1130,4.270142180094787

but i honestly hope next time, all the posters will be put in a poster tube rather than fold it into the same box ;A;

thank you! :) i really enjoy it :D",1372118400,,220,3.782608695652174
