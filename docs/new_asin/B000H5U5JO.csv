8136372,3,B000H5U5JO,"It's quite dated and the image is a little grainy.  There is no narration, just classical music to accompany quickly changing shots of different angles from around the parks.  Unfortunately, it did not fit my particular needs, as I was hoping for slower transitions and a better chance to observe wildlife.  However, any shots of wildlife, which only came up around once a minute were extremely brief.  That said, I'm sure some people will be quite happy to see Utah's western mountain forests, especially if they are considering visiting.  While the low definition does not do the scenery justice, it is a decent preview to the variety found in the state, including some of the canyon country in the southern part.",1458518400,,715,4.87603305785124
