2344382,5,B0009ZF8IA,Great show. Easy to watch. Even better the second and third times. May watch it again to enjoy the sexy scenes over and over.,1373760000,4,125,4.25
2344383,2,B0009ZF8IA,Not that great of a movie. Ok if your looking for nudity with a twist. Story line is very strange.,1366329600,3,98,3.95

 I first saw this movie about 8 years ago on Comcast free HD movies on demand and have been searching for a cheap VHS copy ever since. I've never been able to find it for under $50 used and my limit is $20 for a used copy of this movie. I see that it has been released on Laserdisc many years ago, so why no DVD or Blu-Ray?

 Katya Berger is one of the more beautiful women in the world in my opinion, but I just watched this movie again for the first time in 8 years through Netflix in HD and I must say that even as beautiful of a face and body she has, the character ""Nana"" she plays is really selfish, manipulitave and destructive to everyone she comes in contact with, I guess I was just stunned by her beauty and not thinking of some of the moral issues here. On the other hand I could see that all these guys lives she ruined had it coming to them for lusting after her and allowing her to take control of and destroy there lives. They should have known better or had more self control.

 My search for this movie at a decent price on VHS is over, I'll either catch it on Comcast when it comes back around or Netflix for however long they decide to keep it in the movie que. I would like to buy this movie if it ever comes out on dvd or Blu-Ray though. I give this movie 5 stars just for the stunning beauty of Katya Berger alone.

All in all I would say that there is a lot more that could have been done with this movie and it is a shame that this looks like the last movie Katya Berger made. A better but more controversial movie she made before Nana was a Spanish movie titled Piccole Labbra from 1978.",1347235200,16,1738,4.332307692307692

The hunt scene provides some amusing soft porn including real scratches on thighs from running through the brush. For me the best part was stumbling across Mandy Rice-Davies as Hector's mother, Sabine. Yes, she's the one who in real life played a starring role in the Profumo Affair that 20 years earlier had brought down the British government.",1459814400,2,520,4.788888888888889

manegerie of male/female/male/female intimacies go by,
is that never ever again will i be dissuaded by a low 2
star ranking.  This marvelous piece of outrageous cinema
serves as a needed reminder that my tastes (& those of
my sexy wife) happily run defiinitely out of mainstream.  So
while we gave it 4 stars, that does certainly not serve as a
suggestion that all of you watch it yourselves.  But for us, it
was a very very good time......BMA/RDA",1457395200,6,504,4.5777777777777775

2344432,1,B0009ZF8IA,It's basically soft core porn. There's no real conflict and the protagonist is terrible to just about everyone in her life. The ending doesn't make sense at all. Also there's a bizarre point in this film where self-centered Nana buys a man to fight to the death for her. All of the scenes with Bijoux (Bijou?) smacked of some kind of uncomfortable (historical?) racism. All in all I would not suggest this film.,1438300800,2,411,4.6438356164383565

2344434,1,B0009ZF8IA,"Even though this movie is very dated, the entire production is unwatchable.  The dialogue is laughable, the acting is almost non-existent and the constant nudity adds almost nothing to the story.  Yes, the actresses are pretty and their bodies are attractive, but the story never develops and there seems to be little point to the movie except to show that some actresses' will do almost anything to be in a movie.

This story has been told many times with much better writing, acting and direction.  Do not waste your time on this movie.  I was unable to finish the film.  If you want salacious voyeurism, then watch a porn film.  If you want art, there are far better films out there that tell meaningful stories that are thoughtful and filled with emotion.  This is just an excuse for people to dress in period costume from the early 1900's and to pretend to copulate at the drop of a hat.",1433721600,4,892,4.566037735849057
