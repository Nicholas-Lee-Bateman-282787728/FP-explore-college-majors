3726467,1,B001O3M36Q,"My wife and I sat down to watch The Money Pit and 12 minutes in it started to skip. I removed the disc and inspected it but could not see anything wrong. I  cleaned it and tried it again but it skipped at the same scenes. We both really like this movie which makes it that much more frustrating. This is the first item that I've received from Amazon that didn't meet my expectations.

Signed,

Disappointed",1386720000,4,406,4.315789473684211
3726468,5,B001O3M36Q,"In THE 'BURBS a little bit of life comes to a rather mundane suburban neighborhood thanks to director Joe Dante. Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern and others get obsessed with the strange goings on with their new neighbors (Henry Gibson and his strange looking family) that move in to their average American neighborhood. Gibson's relatives look like a barrel full of weirdoes to say the least. They were really a product of great casting. Corey Feldman is excellent as a teenage neighbor observer who sits on his porch and invites his friends over to watch the would-be commandos (Dern and Hanks) in action as they attempt to unravel and protect the neighborhood from Gibson's strange goings-on. Jerry Goldsmith composed a very good score that is in touch with his subject and keeps the pace of the film moving. His score also includes a very catchy end title for this bizarre little film. In fact Jerry Goldsmith's Dolby Digital 5.1 score is one of the best attractions on this DVD. I found this movie to be very amusing containing some real gut wrenching laughs along the way. Highly recommended viewing. THE MONEY PIT once again in the suburbs just somehow seems more annoying than entertaining. Yet, all the mayhem is somehow amusing to watch. Director Richard Benjamin's direction seems not be able to capture a real central point here. Joe Mantegna as Art Shirk is a standout.",1381795200,,1371,4.8382978723404255

3726511,5,B001O3M36Q,"What can I say? If you own a home then it's hard not to like these Tom Hanks movies. If you've had questionable neighbors (and who out there hasn't had at least one?) then you'll get a kick out of ""The 'Burbs"". You live next to them and it isn't easy to just leave so what can you do?? Also, anyone who owns a house knows that there is always something that needs attention and when you have an overwhelming number of these ""attention getters"", you have ""The Money Pit"". My wife and I have laughed our a__es off every time we've watched it and do so before undertaking any major project. If you're a Tom Hanks fan, don't miss these! (and the 2 for 1 is great too!)",1319414400,,664,4.155038759689923

3726519,5,B001O3M36Q,"I ""love: both of these videos and was so glad to see them as a combo pack. I had the vhs versions but am ""thrilled"" to have them together. These shows are ones of the ""past"" that are ""good clean fun"" to watch for anyone. My neighborhood relates to the ""Burbs"" from the old days when we had a drug dealer next door and some of the neighbors ""were named"" after the characters of the good neighbors. We can still get ""good clean laughs"" over and over by watching this show. The ""Money Pit"" is a ""true hoot of humor"" when or if you have ever done any remodeling and had tried it yourself and then gave in and got the ""characters"" of contractors into your humble abode. I would advise buying the combo pack and have some ""great laughs"" that are hard to come by these days, it is clean and funny. ""Now that is a rare combo!"" NOW BUY THEM!

3726520,5,B001O3M36Q,"If The Burbs doesn`t become a comedy classic there is no justice in the world.
The best comedy is real life exaggerated. And while this is VERY exaggerated anyone who has ever experienced suburban or small town
living will see just a little of theirselves and their neighbors in this film. From the wild rumors, to the neighbor`s nutty ideas,
to the urban legends, to neighbors spying on each other. It`s all here with comic results.

By the same token, The Money Pit is the nightmare of anyone who has ever undertaken a major home improvement, or hired a contractor
for a major job. While the Money Pit isn`t as good as The Burbs, it is a very funny comedy in its own right and very under rated.

Tom Hanks is an excellent actor. And his performances in both of these films are excellent.",1257811200,13,789,4.472222222222222
