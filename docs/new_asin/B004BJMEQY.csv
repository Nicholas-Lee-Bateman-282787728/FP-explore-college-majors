4319139,3,B004BJMEQY,Once I found out that Shaw Brothers Studios had remastered some films to Blu-ray I started purchasing right away. I had come across this little piece and mistook it for another film I had seen when I was much younger. It was an o.k. film but the sets looked like painted cardboard and the plot was a bit silly for my taste. Its worth watching as long as you have a doobie on hand.,1359849600,,380,4.148648648648648
4319140,5,B004BJMEQY,"If you love Shaw Brothers films for more than just martial arts choreography, (in particular if you love the crazier entries like Cave of Silken Web, Battle Wizard, and Holy Flame of the Martial World,) then this is a must-have! Crazy colorful campy fun with inventive old-fashioned FX in a gorgeous transfer. Quickly becoming one of my favorites.",1302480000,10,347,5.0
4319141,2,B004BJMEQY,"For the price, I didn't get what I paid for. Not a lot of good fights at all. Too much talking and a lame ending. Haven't heard much about this so I wanted to see it. Now I wish I could have read some reviews on it.",1301788800,5,215,3.595744680851064
8421989,3,B004BJMEQY,"Dubbed in English. There is a Spider Clan and their superior weapon is a spider in a container that can kill many people (""as many as 1,000 men at a distance of 1,000 feet"") at once.  One of their rules is to never use the Spider unless there is not an alternative choice, similar to a nuclear bomb.  They believe that the legendary power of it is more powerful in creating fear than to actually use the power.  Other clans don't mess with the Spider Clan, but one of their generals has been going around killing people under the name of the Spider Clan and he is also having an affair with the Spider Chief's wife.  The general is spreading rumors that the Spider clan will be using the Spider at an upcoming martial arts competition that will have some of the best fighters there.  Worried, these fighters decided to work together to locate the Spider to destroy it.  In the meantime, the general is working on stealing the Spider once it is located and take over the Spider Clan from the chief, who is actually a good guy with a loving daughter.  The daughter sometimes dress as a man, even a homeless man, in order to be out in public without anyone knowing her identity.  The story includes a piece on this daughter's romantic encounter with one of the fighters, who is in search of the magical Spider.  In this movie, the fighters are all the good people and the bad guy is the general.  The special effects are corny from the 1980s style with computer generated flash lighting, but the kung-fu is very well choreographed in this movie even though the story is a bit weak.  Nice cinematography.",1508457600,2,1600,4.482758620689655

8421991,3,B004BJMEQY,"For some reason, I heard people call this a prequel to 5 Deadly Venoms. Ummm, not so much! The only things they have in common is that it's a SB production. Rival clans try to gain control of this ""spider"" that has deadly powers. Yueh Hua is his usual noble self with nice swordplay & Ching Li plays her role well. Lo Lieh is as despicable as he usually is. Director Chor Yuen has better work in his catalog, but this was ok drama-wise. The swordplay was fine. Guess it's the spider thing that was a lil' off-putting. Not as strange as Heaven & Hell, Human Lanterns or Weird Man but enjoyable enough to sit thru for the acting alone. English dub available btw...",1491264000,,662,4.346774193548387

8421996,2,B004BJMEQY,"I love Shaw Brothers movies but the English dub is a total limper. I only realized it after I bought it, and didn't even bother to finish watching it. I know dubbing serves a purpose, but make that as an option. Please- keep it in the original language!!",1435536000,,254,4.3125
