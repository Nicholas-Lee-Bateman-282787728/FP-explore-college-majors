It deals with trust, betrayal, and being vulnerable-- something we have to do to live life fully but yet something that, having been burned many times, we may be reluctant to do.  The last dialog between Riker and Data is one to be cherished.",1157500800,,266,4.3
7856913,3,6303954391,"Next Generation fans got to resolve the death of Tasha Yar in the classic episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" but in the Star Trek universe the crew still has issues to resolve.  When an escape pod from a Federation freighter lands on Turkana Four, the brutal colony world from which Tasha escaped, the Enterprise shows up for the rescue armed to the teeth.  The leader of the Coalition claims that their opponents, the Alliance, hold the men from the pod hostage.  As proof of their good word, the Coalition provides the services of Ishara Yar, who they say is Tasha's sister.  Although there are initial doubts about her, the crew warms to Ishara.  She is willing to help them with their rescue mission but there is this one little problem: Ishara has a proximity detector implanted in her body, which will set off the alarms.  Of course Dr. Crusher removes the device, which is exactly what Ishara and the Coalition wanted her to do.
Certainly the viewers are more suspicious of Ishara Yar than the Enterprise crew, mainly because ""Legacy"" is a little heavy handed in how it develops the mystery, which is to say that it just begs you to be suspicious every step of the way.  It is something of a shame that the good memories of their fallen comrade are so abused.  This is one of the few Next Generation episodes that truly leaves you with a bad feeling.  Fortunately all future episodes dealing with the fate of Tasha Yar are a lot better than this one.",976320000,2,1456,4.612403100775194
