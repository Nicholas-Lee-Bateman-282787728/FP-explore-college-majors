3546701,5,B001E75QHU,"This is, hands down, the best Christmas special ever. It is so unlike
all those blasphemous things that have passed as Christmas specials,
on network TV in the past. Great songs; great guests; all around a great
time. Guests included Elvis Costello, Feist, Toby Keith, John Legend,
Willie Nelson and John Stewart. This Stephen Colbert's Christmas Special,
upholds the Judeo-Christian traditions, like no other show has done before
AND it uses goats in ways that less imaginative minds could not fathom.
A great family treat, if your family enjoys the conservative traditions of
Christmas like my family does. A must have. A must buy.",1227484800,,633,5.096153846153846
3546702,4,B001E75QHU,"Colbert may not rise to the level of Stan Freberg, Weird Al Yankovic, or Spike Jones here, but this is a worthy entry into the Christmas novelty pantheon. The opening mocks Christmas pop songs with the wit and style of a John Pizzarelli number (thanks to heavy use of Auto-Tune); Feist is adorable as the on-hold angel; Willie Nelson as a reefer-smoking wise man isn't terribly original, but it's worth a few laughs; and John Legend picks up Isaac Hayes' mantel with a song about nutmeg. There is also a lot of inane filler, but on balance it's all outweighed by Jon Stewart's appearance in ""Can I Interest You in Hanukkah?"".

I would have been happy with more Elvis Costello and less Toby Keith, but all in all I hope this becomes a holiday tradition.",1227484800,3,752,4.57037037037037

3546708,5,B001E75QHU,"Hard to believe it's been eight years since the release of the Colbert Christmas special. It must not have been very popular since they never did it again, but it's a gem. A clear satire of the Christmas specials from a generation ago, right down to the laugh track pasted in from low-fi reel-to-reel, you have to understand that Colbert is a real person pretending to be a conservative pundit, who's pretending to be in a 70s Christmas special.

3546722,1,B001E75QHU,"We are big Colbert fans, but this is terrible, offensive trash. It begins with Colbert singing a song about making money off Christmas. Fair enough. Next comes Toby Keith-- carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. He sings a song about shooting people who don't share his views on Christmas. Then he sings about bombing them. The song's finale comes as atomic bombs with mushroom clouds explode in the background. I am not making this up. This is Colbert's Christmas show. Stephen---it's not even funny!! Next comes Willy Nelson, who sings a song about (surprise) smoking dope, and we now we see the baby Jesus in the manager enveloped in smoke.  It goes on from there.

Colbert needs to take his vast wealth, buy all these DVDs, and bury them.",1451001600,,736,4.7421875

3546746,2,B001E75QHU,"Rank me among the fans of this show who were pretty greatly disappointed in this special. It just seems to me as if the writers were trying wayyyyy too hard to be funny, and in so doing, all but eliminated Colbert's usual character. The production values are impressive and this really shows Colbert's remarkable range as a performer, but it's simply not terribly entertaining and in fact comes across as sophomoric (a makeout session with a bear, really?) more than intellectually funny, which is the style that made the show a hit.

It's a step short of terrible--John Legend's song is really funny, but that's about the only clever thing that I saw here. There's a reason why you haven't heard more about this show. I didn't even realize that it existed until very recently, and it was produced in 2008.",1419120000,,806,4.716312056737588

3546753,5,B001E75QHU,"Has become a Christmas tradition to watch this every year.  Colbert is my hero, and his character is one of the funniest and most original of all time.  Hilarious, satirical Christmas songs sung by famous guests (and Stephen) in a parody throwback to the TV Christmas specials of yesteryear.

Why are you not ordering this immediately?  Are you HIGH??",1407196800,,351,4.898305084745763

3546755,5,B001E75QHU,"Loved this when it first aired and wanted to be able to watch it every year during the holidays. If you are a Colbert fan, this is a must have. It is a funny and clever spoof of every Celebrity ""Family"" Christmas Special you've ever seen, from Andy Williams to Bing Crosby, to Andy Williams (let's face it, it's mostly Andy Williams.) If you are old enough to remember watching those programs, you will love this parody. If not, the show is funny enough to stand on its own and the music is surprisingly good, especially Stephen's duet with Willi Nelson. This video should be on everyone's Christmas list.",1396742400,,605,4.559633027522936
3546756,5,B001E75QHU,"I loved this special when it aired on Comedy Central in 2008.  I have been thinking about purchasing it since it came out.  I finally purchased it in 2013.  I don't know why I waited so long, but I finally broke down and bought it.  I love Colbert's wry sense of humor, at times a bit warped.  I have been a moderate fan of the Colbert Report for years.  It took me a few yearsto get his satire at first.  I thoroughly enjoy it now.  He is so deadpan in his delivery that I thoght his views were ultra conservative, that is the joke.  He pokes fun of almost everything especially on this sendup of 60's and 70's Christmas specials.  I have read reviews on this special, kind of polorizing.  My wife likes it in spots especially the cameo with Willie Nelson, but finds the humor weird mostly.  I loved it.  At first viewingI found the special odd, but after two viewings I loved it.  Elvis Costello is hilarious throughout and straddles the line between funny and poigiant on one of his duets.  I became a bigger fan of his after seeing this special.  Feist is very funny and I really like her voice.  THe running gag about the bear is very funny as well  Toby Keith's patriotic video is angry nd funny at the same time.  I was never a big fan of his political views, however I agree with his views about Christmas and the middle east.  John Legend is funny i n a goofy sort of way and I love his voice so does my wife.  I especially liked the duet with Jon Stewart his duet with Jon Stewart, it is my favorite bit near the beginning of this special.  THey have great chemistry with their senses of humor and actually sing well together.  Buy this dvd if you like unconventional Christmas specials and humor.  If you prefer more tradional Christmas specials don't.",1394496000,4,1763,4.337423312883436

3546760,3,B001E75QHU,"I love Stephen Colbert, but this is not what I was expecting. Sure, we got some laughs, but if you aren't expecting a two hour sing-a-long, take heed. Another reviewer noted that it was a Christmas Classic, but I'd beg to differ. A Christmas Story is still king. This doesn't even hold a candle to it. In fact, I actually felt embarrassed for Colbert for the first five minutes, then I remembered that he probably wipes his arse with Franklins.",1392076800,,444,4.5625
3546761,5,B001E75QHU,"This is a great Christmas special for atheists and agnostics. It is funny and irreverent as only Stephen Colbert can be. My favorite song from the show is a song sung by the angelic folk singer, Feist, She sings, Please be patient, that likens the hierarchy of angels who listen to human prayers as a back logged and unhelpful customer service agency. Very funny. He even talked his friend, Jon Stewart who is Jewish into playing a part in a Christmas special. I'll bet that made Jon's rabbi very proud. There were some completely tasteless lines in the show such as in the first scene where Stephen tells us about his most recent ""yule log""...most unappetizing to say the least.  In short, Stephen has done it again. Watch this video if you have a sense of humor and don't take Christmas too seriously.

It is not funnny or witty/clever at all.  We had friends over at the time, and the whole experience was rather embarrassing.  They had heard us praise The Report in the past, and were kind of looking at us like: ""You guys think this type of sophomoric attempt at humor is funny, eh?""

If fact, on this video, Stephen doesn't even sound like himself (compared to what we're used to on The Report).  The whole thing struck us as rather forced and pathetic.  Two thumbs emphatically down from us.",1356825600,3,727,4.373134328358209

My daughter still thinks it was funny.  My wife and I were very disappointed.

It is obvious Colbert and his writers do too. Colbert nails what the genre of Christmas special with an improbable story line, celebrities appearing out of nowhere to sing, goofy humor, and very amateurish graphics. If you remember the 1970s, it brings you back, yet the content pokes fun of timely topics.

The songs are very clever and funny. We had fun speculating whether Toby Keith really understood the satire on the whole ""war on Christmas"" theme. The whole cast coming together singing, ""Peace, Love, and Understanding"" is surprisingly good. Of course, Willie Nelson, Feist, John Legend, and Jon Stewart are highly entertaining in their numbers.

This DVD is worth having for future Christmases. Stephan Colbert shows himself to be an able and versatile entertainer.",1231113600,4,916,5.140939597315437

I regret, though, that Toby Keith (creepy song, creepy dude) will get a fraction of a penny from the rental cost; but at least I didn't spend 20 bucks on it.  Does Keith even realize that Mr. Colbert's ultra-conservative persona is a complete put-on?  Perhaps not; after all, he surely thinks George Bush was a good choice.

Anyway, the show could have benefited from fewer songs and more skits, as well as widescreen and hi-def.  It already seems outdated in this respect, much less how it'll look years from now.  In any case, it's definitely worth a look, if not repeated viewing.  And the extras are pretty good.  Day 2 on the Advent calendar was spot-on.  (Yes, as a renter I had to zip right along thru the 25 days.)

3546832,5,B001E75QHU,"Stephen Colbert is simply the finest satirist in America today.  He treads the line between serious and ludicrous so close that you almost can't spot the moments he veers into one or the other.  His Christmas special is a perfect example, sneaking moments that are actually sentimental within searing parody.  His closing duet with Elvis Costello, ""There are Much Worse Things to Believe In,"" comes closer to encapsulating the spirit of Christmas in America than anything I've seen in decades.

""You doubt, and you're sad / I don't, and I'm glad / I guess that makes us even""

Is that smug bravado from a closed-minded religious bigot?  Or a wistful acknowledgement of how faith comforts where reason fails?  It's both... that's the genius wit that runs through this whole special.

I doff my red faux-fur trimmed hat to Colbert & Co. for this entry into the TV holiday Cannon.

Sonny & Cher, Rowan & Martin, Andy Williams, Burt Bacharach & Angie Dickenson, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Steve & Edie - there are elements of all of these performers in Colbert's fluffy and funny Christmas special.

If you are expecting cutting edge political humor or high brow satire, you will be disappointed. This is all treacle, slapstick and a big dose of absolute nuttiness (or nutmeginess, to borrow the title of John Legend's hilarious homage to the sexy spice).

I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when Stephen chimed in on Willie Nelson's homage to xmas weed.  It's a direct musical quote from the strangest xmas duet of all time --- David Bowie and Bing Crosby singing Little Drummer Boy.  YouTube it.  It was surreal then, it's surreal now.  Hats off to the songwriters.  Very, very clever all the way around.  And Jon Stewart!!  What a gem!  (""And now, for the Hannukah portion of the show . . ."" to quote Mrs. Rene from Pee Wee's show.)

Can't recommend it highly enough.  If you have a bent sense of humor and love pop culture this show will push your buttons.

Colbert's nightly dose of deadpan wit and blowhard satire makes us laugh out loud at our house; his musical Christmas special made my wife collapse in tears of laughter.

Yes, the special is uneven at times, but it's packed with laughs and juicy Colbert goodness.  My personal favorite was the carol that Elvis Costello sings with Colbert at the end, it was bittersweet and quite wonderful.  John Legend's song was excellent; Feist was funny as an angel in heaven's customer service division and Toby Keith should have a whole new career making musical fun of his ""gung-ho for war"" image.

The part that had my wife laughing was Willie Nelson's song about the stoned wiseman.  Her dad was an old pothead and very Willie-esque in his way, so I think that made it extra funny for her.

I'm surprised there are so many negative reviews, but I guess many people take their Christmas too seriously, and don't get a chuckle out of Santa killing a marauding bear with a knife. That sounds gruesome but the grade-school special effects make it hokey-funny, and my kids cheered Santa's victory over the soulless killing machine.  They also laughed out loud through most of the show.  Colbert's Christmas special was sweet at its core, and something we'll watch every year.",1227571200,4,1399,4.840336134453781

As always, Stephen Colbert presents himself as a jovial over-the-top traditionalist American blissfully unaware of the world around him.  Actually though, this Christmas special delves very little into the realm of politics besides a ""War on Christmas"" song by Toby Keith early on.  It mostly focuses on funny and original Christmas music as well as parodies of some of the classics.  Musical guests include Toby Keith, John Legend, and Willie Nelson just to name a few.

I'm a loyal viewer of THE COLBERT REPORT, so I set this special to record on my DVR as soon as I heard about it.  An interview that Colbert did on NPR last week that included some clips of songs that would appear in the Christmas special got me even more excited for it.  I wasn't aware that Jon Stewart would also be joining in to ask Stephen ""Can I interest you in Hanukkah?""

The plot is rather simple.  Stephen is getting ready to leave his stereotypical winter cabin in the woods to go to New York to film his Christmas special with Elvis Costello.  Much to Stephen's dismay, when he opens the door to leave he finds a bear (aka a giant, marauding, godless killing machine) waiting for him.  After calling Elvis to explain his dilemma, many celebrities show up at Stephen's cabin for traditional Yuletide merry-making, while Stephen tries to think of a plan to escape his cabin and elude the bear's grasp as he heads to New York to film his Christmas special

Overall, I would highly recommend this Christmas special for anyone who likes a little satirical holiday cheer.  It's certainly a must have for fans of THE COLBERT REPORT.

I don't own the DVD yet, I only saw the special on it's TV premiere last night. Thus,  I'm not sure what types of special features are on the DVD.  I'll update my review if and when I get the DVD.",1227484800,11,1930,4.5830903790087465
3546840,5,B001E75QHU,"There is so much going on here in this special. There was so much care put into the creation of this. Little moments like when Jon Stewart after his exit, turns back to peer back into Stephen's mountain cabin, and as Stephen is staring after him, their hands reach out to each other, separated by the frosty glass of a window in the door. Resignedly, they both turn away to their respective worlds, Cold Miser and Heat Miser. At the time, the variety shows of the Seventies that Colbert lampoons seemed so advanced from Vaudeville because of the little emotionally vulnerable moments, but in retrospect, it's all Vaudeville and the Vaudeville has never stopped. I don't think there is a better gift than all the small, careful moments of comedy in this string of Christmas lights. Colbert's Christmas-spirit-imbued duet with his nemesis the bear may just evaporate all your Humbug. And when Colbert french kisses his fears, you may lose your mind ... but there are much worse things.",1227484800,2,983,4.822485207100592
3546841,5,B001E75QHU,"You had to know that this Christmas special would be good comedy if Stephen Colbert was in charge.  I laughed out loud several times.  For those who haven't seen it yet, let me give you a little example of what kind of a show this is: At one point Colbert is playing dradle against a potato pancake, losing, and paying up stacks of gold coins.  How deranged is this guy's mind?  Everything about this special was brilliant.",1227484800,2,423,4.454545454545454
