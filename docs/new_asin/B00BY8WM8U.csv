8575534,5,B00BY8WM8U,"As a person who works out in a gym on a regular basis, this DVD offers a great workout that differs from the regular grind of lifting weights.  I really like the mix of the yoga and the pilates.  Not only is it a DVD that is challenging, it is fun too!  And the good part about it is that you can do it in the privacy of your own home and set your own setting and pace.
I definately recommend this DVD!!",1366156800,3,403,3.8313253012048194

8575538,5,B00BY8WM8U,"""As a busy guy who often works from home, I found this DVD to be a great workout. The demonstrations are easy to follow and the exercises are intense when I choose to keep pace with the instructor. I recommend this DVD to those who wish to have a bit more intense of a regular yoga session.""",1364342400,2,291,4.12280701754386
8575539,5,B00BY8WM8U,"This video provided a complete workout, one that was challenging but not overly intense. I'm new to Pilates & Yoga but found the instructions and demonstrations easy to follow and I could workout at my own pace. There are moments during the 60 min workout that I could really feel my heart rate increasing while feeling muscles that I hadn't used in a while. I have now incorporated this video into my workout regimen, well worth every penny!",1363824000,,442,4.67948717948718
