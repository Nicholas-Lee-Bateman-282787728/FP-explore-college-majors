8430104,4,B004I5BSJK,I give this a 4 instead of 5 star because the booklet is only in japanese and you have to use a region free player to play the disc(I don't know Japanese). The pictures in the booklet are great and the bonus CD is very nice. The CD has Rin's theme music and the version of super stream that features her. I bought this for the booklet and the CD because I love the series.,1454544000,2,372,3.973333333333333
