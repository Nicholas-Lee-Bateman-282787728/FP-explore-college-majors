1420126,5,B00005B1Y1,"This is a great price for five of the best Little House Videos (a VHS boxed set).  From the description on the website, it was unclear what the five videos were, but the set includes: the Premiere Movie, The Lord is My Shepard, Laura Ingalls Wilder, A Matter of Faith, and The Gift.  My kids (ages 7-9) love them and will watch them over and over.",1032134400,97,347,4.242424242424242
1420127,4,B00005B1Y1,"This double feature's first episode finds Albert employed by a guest character we've never heard from before (and never will again): Mr. Singerman, a Jewish coffin maker.  ""The Craftsman"" becomes typical Little House fare as Albert must stand against the prejudice of the Larrabee boys, who rough him up and call him a ""Jew lover,"" and as Laura must confront her unwillingness to get involved.  Wise Mr. Singerman teaches Albert some important lessons about work ethic and judging others, and any fan of the show expects the somewhat melodramatic ending.  This episode features Don ""Red"" Barry as the ultra-bigoted Larrabee, and is largely watchable for one of the only full laughs ever heard from Nels Oleson in the history of the show.

The second episode has more to recommend it than the first.  ""The Christmas They Never Forgot"" is a beautiful holiday show that finds our favorite characters snowbound in the Ingalls home on Christmas Eve, swapping stories of their favorite childhood Christmases.  Caroline shares her memories of a rainy holiday with a stepfather she didn't want; Almanzo remembers the year Santa Claus gave his brother Royal no presents; and those who have seen the premiere episode will recall, along with Laura, the Ingalls family's first Christmas in Kansas.  But perhaps the dearest Christmas memory is Hester Sue's, as she recounts a year that she was convinced Santa Claus had ""a white beard and a white face,"" and that black children never got gifts from him.  Her father kept her faith alive with a sweet deception that she would not discover for many years later.

This Little House double feature earns an average of four stars-three for ""The Craftsman,"" five for ""Christmas They Never Forgot.""  How the Powers That Be choose which episodes to restore to DVD remains a mystery to me, but at least one of these is a true classic.",1028073600,8,1862,4.939102564102564

OK, so I'm a BIG fan of LHP. I have every episode every made and have seen each one over and over for the past 4 years running and I'm STILL not tired of watching it. (I know that sounds cray, but it's true!)

These episodes reflect the ""reaching"" that often occurs in Hollywood when a series stuggles to maintain its status and appeal to the masses. The writing is there (yawn) the stories are predictable somewhat and are even unbelievable at some points, given this is supposed to be the 1800's....but what can ya do?

I ""love"" it because I was able to get all three episodes to complete my collection all at once and it met my expectations completely.

If you know ""LHP"" like I know ""LHP"" then you'll love it too. Michael Landon still produces, writes and directs so the consistency is there for you ML fans...it's a great ""finish"" to the entire series and ""caps the well"" for this type of genre to ensure there could be no other like it or no other ""Walnut Grove of the 21st Century"" coming soon to a small screen near you.

However we finally said we have to have it to complete our collection. The first DVD, Looking back to Yesterday , was a bit depressing but it is a typical Little House episode. The second DVD, Bless all the dear children, was okay but kinda cheesy at times and the final DVD , The Last Farewell, I thought could have been a little more dramatic considering they were about to destroy their town and leave their homes but over all it ended with symbolism as of burying an old friend as the pastor says at the end.

1420575,5,B00005B1Y1,"I watched LHOTP as a kid, and also in re-runs as an adult.  I've always been a fan of the old west, and while this series was not traditionally a western, I always enjoyed shows set in this time period.  The funny thing is, my kids, who are 13 and 15, really got into this series after I purchased the first 4 seasons a few months ago.  I'm a 40 year old die-hard horror movie fan, love pro wrestling and R-rated comedies like ""The Hangover"" and the lot, but I am not ashamed to admit that Little House on the Prairie is one of the best shows in the history of TV!  After buying all 9 seasons (and the 1-disc pilot), this set was the final piece of our collection.  Impossible for me to find in stores, I have learned to always buy from Amazon!  This 5-disc set contains the 3 made for tv movies that were produced by NBC after the show was cancelled, and features the ***SPOILER ALERT*** explosive finale where the citizens of Walnut Grove take matters into their own hands and completly blow the town off the map with dynamite after being bought out by a ruthless mining company.  The 4th disc features an insightful and lengthy interview with Melissa Gilbert, and the 5th disc features various BTS material along with a sit-down with Melissa Sue Anderson.  Some of my friends think it's funny that a bitter old dude like me is such a fan of this series, but it's truly entertaining television at its' very best.  Simply getting my kids' stamp of approval is proof enough for me.  Buy this one from Amazon!",1292630400,4,1508,4.392086330935252
1420576,5,B00005B1Y1,"Hello to the English speaking world! I'm German and I'm a fan of Little house on the prairie since it was first telecasted (in Germany). I'm the happy owner of the Series 1 - 9 (in German, of course :o) - with the option to see it in the Original language - ) and now I'm waiting and hoping for the publishing of the rest. You are lucky to have it already! I envy you all! We want to have it in Germany, too - in German language, of course. We are used to the German voices of the Ingalls and all the others. But we can't even get it in English here, we would have to import it! - I don't know how often I have seen these films. It was on German TV several times, but now it's been nearly 10 years since it was on TV the last time. So the DVDs seem to be the last possibility to see it. That's too bad, I think. There's not one modern TV production in series that's worth spending time. Of course, there are crime series and telenovelas a.s.o., a lot of entertainment. But nothing comparable to LHotP. There is this special sort of moral acting, and love as the central point, love which can cover every fault and conquers all. Sticking together when times are hard, keeping the faith, confidence, belief...our life is so very poor without it. The Ingalls give us a good example how everyday life works under difficult circumstances and how to cling to hope, even if it seems impossible to get on - on a minimum subsistence level for instance - and many of us in Germany go through hard times now.

I infected my husband with my love to Little House on the Prairie, and he said:
Please search the world wide web, if there is a chance to have Series 10 with the last 3 ( actually 6) films. - But I can't find any hint. Please, America, be nice to us German film fans! Don't be so selfish, share your riches. We will be very grateful and obliged. ;O)

I do recomend you watch the nine seasons first and the viewer will get a good understanding of this collectors edition. Its very warm ,sad indeed,and frustrating. Fate is a funny word to all these three movies that I saw. The first one is the story of Albert whos future is backed off when he wants to become a doctor is encounterd of a physical problem. The second one is when something happens to Amonso and Lauras little daughter Rose  when they by acidently leave it behind. The last one called the last Farewell is the ending of what happens to a town we all loved seeing becomes taken away. Its a real unplesant feeling when you put these three movies together. But it tells you something what could happen with out knowing. The packaging of the box set is really nice. Good photgraphs of the characters. It opens really nice.

1420590,5,B00005B1Y1,"This is one classic show that will live on just like ""I Love Lucy"" and other classic shows (Lucy is another favorite of mine).  To say that this show went out with a bang is an understatement.  I watched this show when it was originally run on NBC (I watched Monday nights at 8 p.m. on KNBC Channel 4 in Los Angeles).  I have the entire series on DVD and am enjoying the series again.

It is too bad that there will probably not be a reunion of the Michael Landon version of Little House.  Even though he is gone, I feel it could be done.  His son Michael Landon Jr. is doing some family movies nowadays.  He could direct.  Also, the real Charles Ingalls died in 1902.  Following the fact that the Little House series was based approximately 100 years in the past, it would stand to reason that the Michael Landon version of Charles Ingalls also passed away.  As far as the rest of the cast participating, I remember watching the Little House mini-reunion on the Today Show.  When asked if they would be interested in doing a reunion show, Alison Arngrim (who played Nellie Oleson) said ""When do we start?"".  I am sure that she was echoing the sentiments of the rest of the surviving cast.  Besides Michael Landon, the cast members who have passed on are Victor French (Mr. Edwards), Kevin Hagen (Doc Baker), and Dabbs Greer (Reverend Alden).  Richard Bull and Katherine MacGregor are still living (they played Mr. and Mrs. Oleson).  It would be an interesting movie if they did it, although I hear that somebody else owns the rights and that may be what is holding it up.",1208649600,,1572,4.466666666666667

When something went wrong in the television series, there was always a light at the end of the tunnel... something wonderful that came out of the darkness.  Here, in these movies, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  Only tragedy and sorrow.  I really wish I'd never watched them.  Maybe I identify too closely with the characters.  The movies are certainly well written and may appeal to those who aren't so wound up in the series.  If you'd rather remember Walnut Grove as it was however, I would encourage you to avoid these movies.  The one exception (and the one DVD I really enjoyed in this last series) was the one in which they interviewed Melissa Gilbert.  This DVD is definitely worth watching.

1420604,4,B00005B1Y1,"This boxed set includes two of my all-time favorite Little House films.  There's a big reason why the final season of Little House just didn't have the same feel as the all of the ones before it.  Even though the series was about Laura Ingalls Wilder, the true pivotal character has always been Charles.  Michael Landon created one of the most memorable characters in television history.  When he left the show during the final season, it was like a hole was left behind and unable to be filled.  Little House simply wasn't the same.

Thankfully, however, Michael Landon reprises his role in two of these final movies that ended the series so wonderfully.

The first film, ""Bless All the Dear Children,"" is okay at best.  It is not a great installment.  While the premise is good, (Rose is kidnapped by an emotionally disturbed woman while Laura and Almanzo are Christmas shopping), it simply isn't carried off well.  This is supposed to be December in Minnesota, and yet everyone is dressed like it's southern California (where the series was filmed).  All other Christmas episodes featured snow and cold weather to make the location more realistic.  There are also some parts of the story that just don't add up very well.  The final confrontation with the kidnapper is simply too easy and unrealistic.  The part with the ""star"" over where the little boy is sleeping is also too big of a leap.  It was a valiant try.

Second we have my all-time favorite episode/feature: ""Look Back to Yesterday.""  This episode features Albert and Charles returning to Walnut Grove, initially as Charles' job as a new shipping manager sends him to help the people of Walnut Grove find a way to compete with the larger farms of the area.  The trip turns into a nightmare when Charles discovers that Albert is dying of a deadly disease.  I remember this episode shocking everyone, as it was rare that a major character like Albert was being ""killed off.""  It's a true Little House tear-jerker, with Albert fulfilling some of his last dreams.  Michael Landon simply knew how to get the most out of a scene and the most out of his actors.  This is vintage Little House at its finest!  The final climb of the mountain by Albert, Laura, and the school kids is one of the most memorable scenes in the series' history.  Albert and Laura were always very close characters in the series, and Landon knew to focus a good portion of the story on the relationship between these two characters.

Finally, we get to the very last episode ""The Last Farewell,"" in which a land prospector decides to take over the town, forcing the citizens of Walnut Grove into a fight they can't possibly win.  Karen Grassle reprises her role as Caroline Ingalls as she and Charles head back to Walnut Grove for a visit and find themselves right in the middle of the takeover.  The story starts off light and ends in true sentimental fashion.  The final fifteen minutes will make even the hardest heart melt as we witness the final fate of Walnut Grove.

The series had definitely done its best for nearly 9+ seasons.  With Michael Landon at the helm and performing in the last two episodes, he made sure that Little House ended the best way possible.  Any true Little House fan can't be disappointed with this set.  I had been looking forward to the release of these television movies for years, and I was so happy when they finally came out.",1184716800,18,3395,4.6632996632996635

1420623,5,B00005B1Y1,"If you are a big Little House fan then you have to have the box set to complete your collection. After the show ended its nine season run in 1983, Michael Landon came out with three movie specials which are in this box set. It was a great way to finalize the series, because the last episode of season nine didn't give us closure and it's my guess that they probably didn't know they were getting cancelled when they completed filming for season nine.

""A Look Back to Yesterday"" has us saying good-bye to Albert Ingalls as sadly, he has an incurable blood disorder (I think similar to leukemia). One grave error that they make in season 9 is that when Albert comes back to Walnut Grove with Charles and goes through Morphine Withdrawal, at the end of the episode, Laura narrates and says that Albert comes back to Walnut Grove years later as doctor. This can't be true if he dies. Anyway, it's really touching movie.

""Bless All the Dear Children"" is about the kidnapping of Laura and Almanzo's daughter Rose at Christmas. Touching, you'll want to watch it as a holiday special each Christmas.

""The Last Farewell"" is indeed just that-the real ending of the Little House series. A greedy land developer buys the land that Walnut Grove sits on. Ma and Pa come back to Walnut Grove for a visit. And after a valiant stand by the towns' people, they realize they cannot save the town from this greedy man taking it over and decide to blow up the town because he may have taken over the land the town was on but the town's people built the building that were there. It was very sad to see them blow the town up at the end. Thank God they didn't blow up the church though. It's been said that Michael Landon didn't want any other production companies using the Little House set so they decided to end the show this way. In the end, the land developer is furious at the destruction he sees and the town people march out of the town feeling victorious. QUITE AN ENDING TO AN UNFORGETTABLE SERIES!!!

What also makes this box set special is the exclusive interviews with Melissa Gilbert(Laura) and Melissa Sue Anderson (Mary).

It's interesting to hear about the special bond that Melissa Gilbert had with Michael Landon and rapport with other cast members. She was very enthusiastic and happy to talk about her Little House experience.

Melissa Sue Anderson was very gracious but perhaps a little more subdued in her account of her time with Little House. I got the feeling that she felt a little resentful that she wasn't given more storylines towards the end of her time on the show. I also got the feeling from the way Melissa Gilbert and she both talked about one another that they weren't exactly as close as sisters on the set. Perhaps a little undercurrent. Melissa Gilbert was actually pretty good friends with Alison Arngrim (Nellie).

At any rate they are both great interviews to watch. This DVD box set is a MUST-HAVE!!",1171411200,41,2924,4.568702290076335

1420627,5,B00005B1Y1,"I'm glad that they decided to wrap all the Little House movies in one nice little package. Like many others, I grew up with this series and I still enjoy watching them today as I did when I was younger. Strangly, I didn't really know about the movies until later in my life, so it was kind of nice to enjoy the Little House eps (or movies) when I was old enough to enjoy them more.

Look Back to Yesterday...
To me, this is by FAR the most emotional and inspirational Little House movie (including all of the episodes of the series) I have seen. Towards the end you are crying like a baby, but it's still great. So if your in the mood for a good cry, this is it guys. It's worth it! ;)

Bless All the Dear Children...
This was a different one that centers around the Wilder family. Almonzo and Laura are struggling to find baby Rose who was kidnapped by a mentally emotional woman who lost a child. She finds Rose to fill her missing gap and claims her as her own. All is well in the end and it will definately leave a smile to your face.

The Last Farewell...
Oh WHY did it have to end this way! It's sad, but it definatly fits the personality of the Walnut Grove residents where they refuse to give in to the ""higher-ups"". But when they have no choice but to surrender, they do what they think is best and they literally blow up all of the buildings with dynamite. It's sad to see it because every building has such a history behind it. I love the part when Reverend Alden says, ""It was not in Vain"" and everyone walks out of town singing ""Onward, Christian Soldiers"". The very last scene they show is a (blow up free) view of the ""Little House"" standing alone.",1169164800,4,1663,4.206896551724138

1420630,5,B00005B1Y1,"Having watched the show from when it first aired in 1974 and growing up with all the cast it was wonderful to see that it was given the ending that it deserved.

I thought that it was approriate to have the Ingalls be in their little house as that it where they started their lives in Walnut Grove.

I too cried at the end of The Last Farewell as each building was denotated by each main character and felt as if it was my town that they were blowing up. It would have been even more special if Katherine McGregor and the children who played the Ingalls children were able to be there as well.

All in all I found all three shows to be entertaining and well written as ever. I also found that the bonus interviews with Melissa Gilbert and Melissa Sue Anderson to be highly informative as they told us what life was like on set and what it was like to work with each of the other cast.

Although now we have lost three of the most loved actors namely Michael Landon, Victor French and Kevin Hagen, it is great that through this wonderful, wonderful show, for all the fans of Little House they will forever live on.

Great for all age groups and for those who by now are tired of watching reality television and want to go back to watching good old family shows that we can all watch and enjoy.",1168992000,3,1292,4.2145748987854255

I felt absolutely cheated because I paid $26.99 for three episodes that they really could have saved me money on and put them in with Season 9.  Or they could have at least not made this set cost almost as much as a season's worth of DVDs.  I also wasn't particularly impressed with the episodes, especially ""Bless All the Dear Children."" It was like the producers ran out of ideas and put anything together just to have a show for viewers to watch.  And the ""Look Back to Yesterday"" about Albert dying, I thought in the episode where he was using morphine, at the end of that episode Laura says that Albert returns to Walnut Grove as a doctor.  But then with this episode he dies before ever becoming a doctor.  I could be wrong about that, but it doesn't change my mind about being disappointed with this set.  I would have rather had these episodes at a much cheaper price.",1167091200,10,910,4.413173652694611
1420642,5,B00005B1Y1,"I personally think that Look Back to Yesterday is the best of the three LHOP television movies that formed the ""unoffical"" tenth season of the show.  It is, of course, very emotional, but deep emotions are called for when a person we love dies.  Thus the tears that Pa and Laura shed over Albert's impending death are fitting; a lack of tears, a lack of deep emotion, would have been unfitting. Popular culture usually either ignores death entirely or does not take it seriously enough.  The fact that every person who ever lived or ever will live, no matter how good, how loving, how courageous, how talented, etc. will die, is an aweful fact, one that does call into question the fundamental goodness of the universe and the value of life.  But it is hard to dismiss the goodness of the universe or the ultimate value of life based on the fact of death since there is so much beauty in the world and since there are so many good, loving, talented, etc. people.  The intrinsic value of good people and the value of their having lived, does not seem to be cancelled by their death and their death can, odly enough, highlight the value of their lives and of life in general.  And of course, for the spiritually minded person, the great worth of human life, and particularly of the lives of some humans, points to the existence of an afterlife and of a world to come where all that is precious and good in this life will be preserved.

I can't really express what I mean very clearly, but for me this episode of Little House does clearly highlight both the horribleness of death, the nearly unbearable aspect of it, i.e., that a person whom we love and who is worthy of love, and who has a value beyond price, will cease to exist, at least in the form we know, as well as the way in which death can rouse in us a renewed appreciation of all that is good and valuable in the world.  Thus Albert's impending death causes Pa and Laura to become acutely aware of how much they love him, of how deeply their lives have been woven with his, just as Albert's awareness of his death causes him to become aware of how much he loves Pa and Laura and all his family and friends, as well as causing him to become acutely aware of the value of living and of the life he has lived.  His attitude toward death in the film is enobling.  He does not want to surrender to it by spending the rest of his life in bed feeling sorry for himself but by doing as much as he can and by helping the people he loves.

The last ten minutes of the film are the most moving of all. Albert's ascent up the mountain is symbolic of the triumph of his spirit over death and of the ascent of his soul to heaven, just as the badges he buries in the keep sake box are symbolic of the burial of his body.  The children who surrond him and Laura at the end symbolize, certainly, the circle of life and the interconnectedness of all that lives and, perhaps, the communion of saints.  Finally, the music in the last ten minutes is masterful.  Rose's score is nearly Wagnarian in its eloguqence and the ethereal way he weaves together and transforms the Little House theme and Albert's theme in the very last two minutes of the film sends chills up my spine every time I listen to it.  I do agree with other fans on the very high quality of the music Rose wrote for the series and would welcome a recording of the very best music he wrote for Little House.",1165449600,2,3412,4.301092043681748
1420643,4,B00005B1Y1,"These three television specials aired from late 1983 to early 1984 and were the last words Michael Landon had to say regarding the adventures of Laura Ingalls Wilder.

By this time, of course, many of the characters were no longer based on the actual people in the books, but the spirit of the television series continued to emulate the literature.

LOOK BACK TO YESTERDAY
Charles and Albert return to Walnut Grove when it becomes clear that Albert has a serious illness.  This is perhaps the most difficult of the films to watch, not for lack of talent or story, but because it carries a somber tone.

BLESS ALL THE DEAR CHILDREN
This is the strongest of the three installments.  The story reunites Isaiah Edewards, Laura, and Elmonzo as the search for the couple's kidnapped child.  The sub-plot with the Carter Family is the best of the three.  A great film to watch annually during the Christmas season.

THE LAST FAREWELL
Something of a controversial end to the beloved series that was enjoyed for being more sweet than sour.  I believe Michael Landon was making a statement about where television was heading and taking a stand as he brought his acclaimed series to an end.  This installment far outshines ""Look Back to Yesterday"", but will most certainly be difficult for some fans to swallow.

I have grown up with the ""Little House"" series and have great respect for most of the beliefs and values that Mr. Landon propogated on this show.  These tele-pictures represent the last three statements he made through this set of characters and circumstances.  He would never again return to the past for inspiration, but looked to contemporary times for ""Highway to Heaven"" and the short-lived ""Us"" series.",1164844800,4,1710,4.855172413793103
1420644,5,B00005B1Y1,"I am so happy that these TV movies of ""Little House On The Prairie"" have found a new home on DVD. These are such beautiful and heart-warming movies. I have seen them many times on TBS as a child growing up. But I do not believe they have been shown on TV Land or The Hallmark Channel, making these tales very rare in recent years. This DVD is coming out at the perfect time because it would make a great Christmas gift or stocking stuffer.

These are the TV movies included on the ""Little House On The Prairie - Special Edition Movie Boxed Set:""

Look Back To Yesterday (original air date: December 12, 1983)
Charles comes home from the big city to Walnut Grove to try to get the farmers to share their crops. He brings his oldest son, Albert. While in Walnut Grove Albert displays mysterious medical symptoms. Charles brings Albert to a specialist and finds out that he has a serious disease. This is actually a very sad episode, so be warned. Some say that Albert died in this episode, others say that he was able to beat the disease and go on to fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor. What happens to Albert is never stated, instead the movie lets the viewer form their own conclusions.

The Last Farewell (original air date: February 6, 1984)
Charles and Caroline return to Walnut Grove to learn that somebody else owns the town and wants everyone to leave Walnut Grove. The townspeople decide that the person can keep the land but they own the town. Allison Arngrim (Nellie Olson on the original series) has a cameo as a telephone operator.

Bless All The Dear Children (original air date: December 17, 1984)
This was actually a Christmas-themed movie. (Didn't ""Little House On The Prairie"" always have the best Christmas episodes?) Laura and Almanzo's baby daughter Rose is kidnapped while they are Christmas shopping.

Michael Landon was a genius and no one compares to the very high standards that he always set!",1164499200,55,1921,4.621700879765396
1420645,2,B00005B1Y1,"For the last year or so my husband and I have been sharing the Little House stories with our children.  We have slowly viewed all 9 seasons together and have thoroughly enjoyed them, especially the earlier seasons.  I would characterize the earlier seasons (up to about #4) with words like heartwarming, family-affirming, authentic, excellent, well-acted, etc.  I was eager to view this final ""Season"" as I don't recall seeing them when they originally aired and was very curious about what ever became of the Ingalls and the citizens of Walnut Grove.

I pains me to report that my entire family agrees that these three episodes are just awful!  I struggle to even find words to characterize these three stories but melodramatic, over-the-top, ill-contrived, and stupid (the word my kids used most often) are just a few.  I'll try not to provide a spoiler, but I will say that the first episode involves killing off one of the principal characters.

Which brings me to a point that has bothered us many times as we've viewed the entire series--there is a terrible problem with continuity.  It's as if no one can remember what was written in previous episodes.  I seem to recall in a previous season that the very same character who is now dying was said to have gone on to lead a very productive life, pursuing their dream.  Likewise, the final episode involves the takeover of the town by someone who supposedly has the deed to all the land, which seems to conflict with episodes in previous seasons that dealt with land ownership--ie, when the railroad wanted to force everyone to sell to them.  Of the three, the second episode involving the kidnapping of Rose, is perhaps the most ill-contrived story line in all of LHOTP.

In fairness, I'll admit, we did enjoy the interviews with Melissa Gilbert and Melissa Sue Anderson.  Ms. Anderson stunned me with her continuing beauty as she has not aged at all.  The camera person was also impressed, as evidenced by the many close ups of her.  (Sorry, no close up of Ms. Gilbert.)

The two stars we've given reflect our enjoyment of the interviews and the fact that there was some entertainment value in that we laughed our fool heads off while watching!  What a contrast to season one, which always left us with a tear in the eye and a warm spot in our hearts.",1163980800,13,2308,4.701492537313433

1420648,5,B00005B1Y1,"UPDATE 1-20-2014:  Did you know that this series will now start to be released on blu-ray?  Do an Amazon search for ""Little House on the Prairie Season 1 Deluxe Remastered Edition Blu-ray"".  This is great news for all ""Little House"" fans!

(Updated) Series on a whole: 5 stars++.  Stories on this particular set: 4-1/2 stars.  Video quality: 3-1/2 stars.  Extras: 4 stars.

Why would I call this the ""Best series in the history of television""?  ...because it's BIG in heart and soul, the characters and stories have TREMENDOUS depth, and it's not bogged down by the politics of your typical western, or typical show for that matter.  The storylines could go anywhere, and focus on anyone, or anything.  There didn't have to be a villain of the week, a murder, etc.  Come to think of it, this is one of the most ""murder-less"" westerns I have ever seen.  If people died, it was more from life's hardships in the 1800's than from anything else.  It may not have ended anywhere near as well as it came in, but when you look back at the series on a whole, I would still rank this as being the best of all TV series, and for a number of reasons.

The appeal of this series is much broader than most people give it credit for.  The show wasn't just for little girls, as anyone looking at the cover of one of the Little House books might conclude.  It was more a show about how to deal with the unexpected, with changes in life, and how to get along with your neighbors.  There are life lessons to be learned here for everyone, from little girls to old men.

I doubt that we will ever again see a show quite like this, which so graciously teaches the lost values that we need in times like these.  Network TV has become a desolate wasteland of high-tech crime scene dramas, court case TV, reality TV, infomercials, talk shows, extreme sports, and news programs.  You will be hard-pressed to find much of a heart or soul in any of them, mainly just a lot of computer ""gee-whiz"" wizardry, and for the most part a waste of time in general.  Meanwhile, Little House delivers both heart AND soul, so much so in the subtle ways that it influences you, that you can't help but walk away a better person afterwards.

Even if they did bring a show like this back (and they`ve tried), it would be EXTREMELY difficult to match the production values you will find here without a sky-high budget.  Not to mention, many of the best character actors once employed by Hollywood, (many of whom appeared on Little House), are now long since dead.

SPOILERS FOLLOW...  About this particular set...  After Season 9 ended, a deal was inked to conclude the ""Little House on the Prairie"" series with the final three tele-movies contained here, the UNOFFICIAL ""Season 10"", which wraps up the series in a very peculiar and jaw-dropping way, literally going out with a BANG!!

Whether or not anyone likes the idea of the town being blown to smithereens in the end, or with the direction the series took in it's later years, Michael Landon and crew continued to crank-out very touching, emotionally-charged episodes to the bitter end.  Casting, acting, directing, writing, set design, and the beautiful, harmonious music composed by the late David Rose all remained high-quality throughout the series.  I can't say enough about the fine acting and music though, as well as the town layout - all First Class!  Well... There were a few less than stellar casting decisions near the end of the run, but nothing worth spoiling the series over.

The final three films are somewhat of a mixed bag, and leave you with mixed emotions.  I probably would have wrote them a bit differently if it were up to me, but they are still VERY MUCH worth the price of admission.  The saddest, and my choice as the best of the three would be the first one, ""Look Back To Yesterday"", which will likely produce a few tears (video and sound quality is very good to excellent).  As for ""Bless All The Dear Children"", the story is somewhat uneven and seems to drag in the middle, however the ending is quite good, and redeems any flaws.  In all honesty though, I can't figure out why on earth they felt the need to tell this particular story as one of the last three of all time (video quality is good to very good).  ""The Last Farewell""... What can I say?... Does anybody really want to see the town get blown-up??  Michael Landon has always told stories about overcoming great adversity, and carrying on, but I feel that he took things a little too far here, maybe for no other reason than simply because he could.  Not the best note for the series to go out on, but a very dramatic exit nonetheless, and once again it may bring you to tears.  The video quality on this one, which I would have expected to be great, being the final installment, was actually the WORST of the three.  The print that Imavision used for the transfer was surprisingly not the greatest.  It was fairly dark, and the colors were faded.  A real disappointment, as I expected something better for what I paid.  Concerning the extras, the interviews of the two Melissa's were quite well done.  I was hoping for more extras though.

A few odds & ends and closing comments...  If I had any say with the powers that be, I would NOT have destroyed the exterior town setting at the Big Sky Movie Ranch (a big chunk of the ranch was recently sold to developers), and rather would have tried to preserve it as a museum/tour/theme park/resort, for all to enjoy in the years that followed.  Not a chance of that happening now of course, after the final episode, plus the land around the shooting location is being developed like mad.  Very poor decisions in the end by those responsible.

I would also like to add that while MANY of the episodes from Season box sets 1 through 3 were drop-dead GORGEOUSLY restored, I would like to see some kind of effort put into restoring the remainder of the series, which was very much a disappointing (to say the least!) ""hit and miss"" restoration effort, even if I have to pay for them all over again for the improved versions in another release of some kind.  The series was THAT GOOD!!

Question:  Why has there never been a music CD compilation of David Rose's best work from this series?  They can put out a 4-disc collection of the original one-season Battlestar Galactica, but nothing for David Rose's Little House work?? ...someone who is considered to be the best in the business??

R.I.P., Little House, and thanks to all involved for putting on such a fine show.  You have created a masterpiece that will be enjoyed for generations to come.  Now if only Imavision or somebody else would restore the episodes that so desperately need it from the original 35mm prints, like they did with several of the early episodes, then we would really have something special.",1156636800,199,6815,4.567545304777595

1420653,5,B00005B1Y1,"""Little House On The Prairie"" was a very successful tv series in the late 60's and early 70's. It starred Michael Landon as Charles ""Pa"" Ingalls and Melissa Gilbert as Laura. It was based on the many novels by Laura Ingalls, who grew up in the prairies of Kansas in the 1860's. The historic work of fiction was very personal to Larua,  recalling her childhood, moving from the forests of Wisconsin to the plains of Kansas, and the wholesome family life that survived despite hardships of living in a primitive frontier society.
The series ran long, and on this DVD, you don't get all the episodes but the highlights. The episode that most gripped audiences with its emotional, touching message on family love was the episode in which Laura's parents have a new baby. Laura becomes jealous of the new addition to the family, and she is upset she loses the affection of her parents. No longer the center of attention, she refuses to pray for the baby when the baby is struck with an illness. The baby eventually dies. Stricken with guilt and thinking she has caused the death of the baby, Laura journeys into the heart of the forest. There she meets a man she mistakes for God- a sainty, good natured hermit who teaches her a life lesson.
Michael Landon, a tv actor formerly Little Joe in Bonanza, was a 70's hunk and a man with whom I had a crush on as a young girl. He was the paragon of manhood- he was a great provider as a father, or so the character of Charles Ingalls made him out to be as well as sex symbol- he was muscular, strong, athletic and chiseled with rugged handsome looks. The music to the series was very beautiful, and the dialogue and the visuals very true to life, at least, that is, in the 19th century mid West America. I believe this DVD is a must have for the fans of the show.",1049414400,4,1802,4.395209580838324

The DVDs broke our Blu-Ray player and we had to buy a new one.  Many of the DVDs freeze and will not advance.  The set is really, really, really poor quality.  So far, we have purchased and returned 5 sets trying to get one where all the DVDs actually work.  Haven't been successful yet.  So sad.",1526169600,,426,4.3164556962025316

7936393,5,B00005B1Y1,"This was a birthday gift for my wife, as it is one of her all-time favorite shows and one I have enjoyed watching with her. However, this is not a review of the actual show.

This box-set is very complete, including the pilot and other movies and all the episodes. And they are nicely packaged by season inside the outer box. I am talking about nice tri-folds with imagery from the show.

But the real draw for me was that outer box, with its cabin imagery. My wife pointed out the dog sitting there and the family in the windows. She just loves it, as it sits prominently on her family blanket box in our great room.

I do not really display my special/limited edition games/movies, but for someone who really loves this show, premium packaging, and attention to detail, this set is a homerun.",1525219200,2,794,4.462068965517242

7936395,2,B00005B1Y1,"This is a very disappointing production. The screen format is forced into widescreen mode to fit modern televisions, so the proportions are all off. You're constantly zoomed in too much, and the closeups look distorted. Very sad: they could have just remastered the original screen formatting, and people who wanted to fill up their modern TV screens with the picture could just choose that format on their TV! I checked the menu on the DVD to see if there was an option for viewing it in original formatting, but unfortunately there is not. The audio quality is also sub-par. I wasn't expecting great things there, but frankly, the audio on the high-quality VHS tapes I recorded off the live broadcast years ago is better than this.",1524268800,,733,4.825396825396825
7936396,1,B00005B1Y1,Little House has always been one of my all-time favourite series.  Quality of DVD was very poor unfortunately!  I received the package three days ago and am halfway through Season 1.  Three out of five DVDs were faulty so far.  I do hope I'll have better luck with the rest of the package!!!,1523059200,,291,4.433962264150943
