2677940,2,B000JMK6O4,"My child didn't like this much as they thought it would be that's so Raven, The suite life of Zac and Cody and Hannah Montana altogether instead it was one episode of each. Only one episode had all 3 in it a big disappointment",1170460800,2,226,4.159090909090909
2677941,5,B000JMK6O4,"If you like the shows ""Thats So Raven,"" ""The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody"", and ""Hannah Montana"" then you will love this dvd. Raven goes to the Tipton on a business trip with her boss, where she meets Zack and Cody who are having a suprise party for their moms birthday. Raven has a vision about a kid in a sweater vest running away which scares Cody. Hannah montana comes to the tipton and meets maddie who tells her about how her dad used to be an amazing country singer. The DVD also includes a Hannah Montana music video, a Raven trivia game and a never before seen episode of The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody where Cody tries to get Zack and Chef Paolo to eat healthy. You should definetly buy this!!",1167782400,22,703,4.214814814814815

2677975,4,B000JMK6O4,"I watched it once, now I go to watch it again and it freezes at the menu. No scratches or anything.

Movie is great. i used to watch That's So Raven all the time and it's nice to have nostalgia once in a while!",1390262400,,210,3.772727272727273
2677976,4,B000JMK6O4,"I got my copy of this DVD through the Disney Movie Rewards Program.

The episodes are:

Checkin' Out (That's So Raven)
That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody)
On the Road Again (Hannah Montana)

Bonus episode: Health and Fitness (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody)

I have seen the second episodes dozens of times late at night on the Disney Channel and it was nice to finally see part 1 and part 3. Checkin' Out is actually the final episode that was filmed for That's So Raven, even though it aired in the middle of the final season. The first episodes are great, but I dislike the last episode. Besides from Maddie's cameo, it has nothing to do with the other episodes.",1345939200,,699,4.3538461538461535

2677980,1,B000JMK6O4,Don't buy this.. it isn't that good and you can get it on iTunes for 2.99  well thats about it...,1185753600,,97,3.85
2677991,5,B000JMK6O4,"My favrite things about this DVD was the beautiful Raven Symone, also Brenda Sing from ""Wendy Wu"" Hannah Montana rules!!!! She is such a good singer! The only thing that would make the show better is if she sang with Raven (yeahright, in my dreams!!! Some time Kim and me make up our dances to hannah montana's songs! I think the Suite Life of Zack and Cody's show is racest,though.",1185062400,,382,4.4714285714285715
2677992,4,B000JMK6O4,Although this DVD was not what i was expecting it was fun all the same. I thought the characters would interact a little bit more but the one you saw most was Raven(my least favorite)and Hannah Montana had the least interaction. Nevertheless it was enjoyable and the bonus episode was very funny.,1184544000,4,296,4.711538461538462
