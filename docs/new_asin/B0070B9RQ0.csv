5046154,5,B0070B9RQ0,"The Gothic soap opera continues to keep going strong as Barnabas Collins uses the power of I-Ching to travel back in time to 1897 to stop Quentin Collins from harming David in the future. This review will contain spoilers! The first time I watched the 1897 episodes, I didn't care much for them but I've been re-watching them and they've gotten better. Barnabas returns to being a vampire again and needs the help of Sandor and Magda the Gypsies to help protect him during the day and keep his secret. Grandmother Edith is slowly dying and needs to tell Edward Collins a family secret. All the Collins's want their share of the inheritance after she dies. When Barnabas shows up, claiming to be a cousin from England, Quentin becomes very suspicious and ends up raising Angelique from the dead to help him. There are lots of interesting characters throughout the 1897 storyline like Crazy Jenny, Count Petofi, Rev. Trask, Garth Blackwood, Aristede, and many more. I highly recommend DARK SHADOWS COLLECTION 13!!!",1401062400,,1012,4.8895348837209305

8507676,5,B0070B9RQ0,"I bought from collection 14 and watched the entire Quentin saga that I had watched as a teenager without seeing this collection.....boy am I glad that purchased Collection 13.  It filled in many of the gaps that I had in my memory especially that Quentin first died by Jenny's hands.  It was superbly written story that can be enjoyed on many levels especially horror, historical fiction, melodrama and morality tale.  It moves the story quickly thru a myriad of characters that are extremely entertaining.",1445472000,,506,5.0
