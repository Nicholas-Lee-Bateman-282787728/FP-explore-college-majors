1846558,4,B00008G8WJ,"Monogram was a B-picture studio, however, they did occaisonally venture into the classics; in 1934 they produced two quite respectable adaptations based on Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone.  Jane Eyre was adapted by Adele Comandini, a screenwriter of note, and stars Virginia Bruce as Jane.  Monogram surrounded Miss Bruce with a wonderful English cast: Colin Clive as Mr. Rochester, and plucked from the British colony, Ethel Griffies, Beryl Mercer, Jameson Thomas, John Rogers, Lionel Belmore and David Torrence.  Miss Bruce is a superb Jane and does her own singing and her beautiful long blonde hair is on full display as she prepares for night.  She understands her part and the conditions of 19th century English life.  Colin Clive is far better as Rochester than Orson Welles in the later version, albeit this version lacks the atmosphere of the Welles-Fontaine film.",1126310400,6,904,5.25
1846559,3,B00008G8WJ,"This is certainly one of the strangest adaptions of Charlotte Bronte's classic.  It was probably made as a second feature, since it is only an hour long, and  reflects what would appeal to a 1930's audience.  The part of Adele, Rochester's ward, is greatly enhanced, while other important characters, (Helen, Jane's classmate at Lowood School and the Rivers family, are left out entirely).  Colin Clive, (Henry Frankenstein of the movie, ""Frankenstein"") is miscast as a romantic and very, very  nice Mr. Rochester.  And one of the most melodramatic scenes in literature, ( the revelation during the wedding of Jane and Rochester that Rochester is already married to a mad woman confined to an attic) is omitted, probably because of a 1930's version of family values.  For Jane Eyre buffs, this movie is an interesting period piece, but the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke  version of this is better.",1125964800,11,895,5.082191780821918
1846560,1,B00008G8WJ,"I love old films and the story of Jane Eyre, so I bought this DVD thinking I couldn't miss.  Wrong!  This is a horrible adaptation, not at all true to the book.  The characters are completely changed: Jane is described as ""the pretty governess,"" and engages in perky verbal sparring with a dashingly handsome and charming Rochester.  In both the book and all other film adaptations I've seen, Jane is rather plain and humble, and Rochester is moody and NOT supposed to be handsome.  Aside from the terrible adaptation from book to script, and the bad acting, the movie print itself used to master the DVD was in poor shape, and NOT restored.  The resulting DVD is of annoyingly poor quality.  This particular movie version is just plain bad, both story and technical quality.  Try the versions with George C. Scott or William Hurt instead; they're very good.  The Ciaran Hinds version is passable, though in his version Rochester comes off as just plain mean.",1063584000,31,959,4.763636363636364

1846598,3,B00008G8WJ,"Jane Eyre, 1934 film

Two children call for Jane, she is mistreated and defends herself. Shes hurt. Jane is sent to the orphanage as punishment for her deceitful actions and temper. Years pass. Jane is now a teacher She disapproves of the management and is dismissed. She finds work as a governess at Thornfield Hall. She is quite talented. Jane meets Adele, her pupil. She sees the rooms in this big house, and her bedroom. [Note her dress.] She meets Rochester at tea. She plays the piano and sings. Lovely. At night she hears a scream! Has something unusual happened? The next day Adele skips class to climb a tree. Uncle Edward visits London. Adele has another accident. [To get attention?] Impertinent, pretty, and intelligent. There is a party with guests, and dancing. Jane wears her governess outfit. Adele offers her comments.

At night Jane hears a scream and sees smoke from a room! The servants talk about expected changes. Jane is asked to help in decorating and choosing jewelry. Can she go away for a holiday? Rochester offers Jane a new room. Then she hears a scram again! Bertha shows up to interrupt the meeting. Will her marriage be annulled? It was the only way. Later Jane goes away. She cant have gone very far. That night the mansion catches fire! Can Bertha be saved? A minister offers marriage then work in India. She hears bad news about Rochester from Sam Poole, and visits him. He has changed. But Jane makes another decision, she will stay with him.

I never read the novel, I suspect this is a simplified and condensed version that skips details. Was the madness of Bertha inherited? What about Adele, she seems accident-prone. Did Jane make a good decision as to the future of her life?",1393113600,,1717,4.6976744186046515

1846614,2,B00008G8WJ,"The first talkie Jane Eyre is...different, to say the least. I mean different not only from the other adaptations but also completely different from the book! First off, it's only an hour long, so a lot was cut and rushed. Jane's years at Lowood (an orphanage in this version) are condensed to her arrival and then the page from the book describing those years! (Yes, they just filmed the book page). There's no Helen Burns or illness outbreak. Aside from the main characters, those smaller parts that are kept are blink and you'll miss it. Other transitions are done with Jane writing in her diary.

Secondly, it's very watered down. It's not a screwball comedy like the 1940 Pride and Prejudice by any means, but it's definitely much lighter in tone than the book. The characters are happier and the darker stuff from the book is either cut or just watered down. I'm no movie buff, but I think I read somewhere that this was because it was the Great Depression and they didn't want to depress people more. Also, aside from Colin Clive, the majority of the cast is American and most of them don't do that great of a job hiding their accents.

Instead of being a Plain Jane in the titular role, we get Virginia Bruce's Blonde Bombshell. To be fair, hardly any of the adaptations have actually had a plain actress. And I will give them credit for at least being honest about it- They didn't even try to pretend she was plain. They openly acknowledged that she was pretty. It was kind of weird, but at least they were honest! Her Jane is very outspoken and not at all reserved. Colin Clive's Rochester is always quite cheery and polite with Jane. All the passion between them is gone. Nothing like the book character at all.

Overall, the adult actors were decent with what they were given, but let's be honest- this is a sugar-coated version of the story.  I can't say it's a good adaptation (God, no!) or even a good movie, but it has value for hardcore Jane Eyre fans and/or collectors...like me!",1344556800,2,1997,4.554317548746518

1846617,3,B00008G8WJ,Given that this movie was made in 1934 it was well done for that time period. Of course I like the more updated versions much more.,1231200000,2,131,4.076923076923077
1846618,3,B00008G8WJ,"This 1934 version is produced by Monogram Pictures, one of the studios in so-called `Poverty Row,' slang used in Hollywood to refer to the smaller film companies specializing in low-budget action adventure films. Some of these studies made a low-budget version of classic literature and such titles as `Oliver Twist' or `The Moonstone' were produced by Monogram (both available on Alpha Video DVD). These films run only about 60 minutes and you just cannot find the same artistic value as MGM's `David Copperfield' or `A Tale of Two Cities.'

So you cannot and should not expect much here. The film runs only 62 minutes and how can you tell the story of a Victorian classic novel within 62 minutes? But the film does try and like the same company's `The Moonstone' (in which characters use electricity), some drastic changes are done to the plot and settings of Charlotte Bronte novel. The film's story often goes so fast, skipping some of the key elements of the book's first half. Jane's horrible experience at the boarding school is reduced to less than ten minutes, and what she experiences there is not so terrible.

The film spends more time on Jane's romance with Edward Rochester and the mysteries surrounding the mansion, but results are far from satisfactory. Two main leads Virginia Bruce and Colin Clive certainly make an attractive couple, but not in the way Charlotte Bronte had envisioned. Colin Clive, who is best remembered as Doctor Frankenstein yelling `It's alive!' shows more restrained acting as intelligent gentleman, but his handsome and mild-mannered Rochester does not have the tragic shadow that every reader of the book would remember. Equally ineffective is the subplot about the mansion's attic, which lacks suspense or surprise.

After all this `Jane Eyre' would be interesting only as a curio or a historical proof showing the difficulty of film adaptation of classic literature.",1168905600,12,1911,5.079617834394904
1846619,4,B00008G8WJ,"This version of JANE EYRE is enjoyable for film history buffs.  So, thank goodness it has not been lost, and is available on DVD.

This is a very early talkie, from one of the smaller movie companies, and all the growing pains show.  (Garbo's ANNA CHRISTIE was made the year before this, and while still stagey, it shows what a larger, more successful film company could do, compared to this smaller one.  Garbo's film was a film, this feels more like a record of a stage performance.) The script is rather ""favorite scenes from JANE EYRE.""  It takes major plot points and turns them into a brighter story all together, mixing and matching elements at will

Virginia Bruce is tall, platinum, strikingly beautiful with a lovely contralto voice, voluptuous figure and mesmerizing sad eyes (that inspired Italian doll maker Lenci, in many of his boudoir dolls of this period).  All of this, of course makes her wrong to play Jane, in one of the most total miscasting moments of film history.  Worse yet, she slumps and slinks around like a 1930s starlet, more Jean Harlow than Jane Eyre.  To see her languidly lounging against a pillar or a piano, combined with some of the abrupt dialogue lines that contradict the original story, brings lots of laughs to a Bronte fan.  This version also added characters and played loose with details in ways that also made me laugh.

Colin Clive as Rochester is handsome, refined, and gentlemanly.  He treats her like an Etonian suitor.  Virginia Bruce rather brusquely runs the scenes with him, and often seems very bored with him, practically rolling her eyes.  So, of course, all of this is wrong for the story.  Now, I must say, they are both very good actors, and inhabit their roles, and for this period, they are both very fine (compare them with the supporting cast, especially the hysterically bad Adele - a child actor coached to the ends of every finger and curl in the most obvious stage mannerisms of the day), but the limitations of the medium of that day and their miscasting does them no favors.

The casting of his fiance is very odd indeed, and shows how the beauty of WOMEN was valued at that time, over girls.  She looks a good ten years older than Rochester, and quite the dark-haired demimonde vamp.  Watching many versions of JANE ERYE, I find that the casting of this role and Adele tell us a tremendous amount about the tastes of the times.

The sets are bright and light, but we must understand, that some of this dynamic was needed for the cameras that were being used at the day, the makeup is very dramatic, but again, the makeup then needed for a face to ""read"" on camera was not even natural skin tones.  So for these things, this version is a fascinating film study of a particular moment when films were transitioning.  Miss Bruce's costumes are lovely - more Cinderella than plain Jane - and are also a notable moment of history, when this high waised, fully flounced skirt was ""in style"" for period films.  This type of dress, too, was copied by doll maker Lenci.  You will notice that all the lines are spoken very slowly and distinctly, and many will dismiss it as bad acting, but this too, had to do with early sound recording, it was necessary for the way film was made.

Since I AM interested in film history, this has made me anxious to see more of Virginia Bruce.  I want to see if her particular presence was used in more contemporary pieces, where her looks and personal style would have made her shine.  This is a time capsule.",1153699200,29,3506,4.587479935794542
7983848,3,B00008G8WJ,"Despite its lack of fidelity to the book, I am glad to have added this version as part of my Jane Eyre library.  Jane is way too pretty, and for that matter, way too platinum blonde!  As expected from an hour-long treatment of JE, the story is severely truncated.  A sweetened up version, it lacks the Gothic feel of the book and diminishes the tortured aspects of Rochester's character.  For me, the primary value of this dvd is as a historical curiosity.

I guess everyone is better off that this being a short movie, because it was just awful would have been unbearable to sit through had it were any longer.
