Clear step by step instructions will make you feel like a pro!",1109894400,2,282,4.549019607843137
2247729,5,B0007WZO52,"If you are curious about building an AR from a forging, this is the DVD to have.  It is well made, and includes set-up and tooling info.  By following the directions given, you will be able to produce a good looking functional AR.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1109808000,,260,4.375
8053090,1,B0007WZO52,"Sucks! Content is not match the title!!

The title ""Building an AR-15 from a 0% Forging"" should be change to ""Building an AR-15's body case from a 0% Forging"". I wonder where the other reviews came from. All dvd just the mill machine operation . Originally, I though there might have some speciall machine shop operation and gunsmithing skill. But it not, if you want to see mill machine operation, this is it and it is rough amateur operation not professional skill.",1151625600,3,467,4.695121951219512
8053091,5,B0007WZO52,the was a incredibly informative video set you will refer to many thimes in the course of construction.,1111104000,,103,4.777777777777778
8053092,5,B0007WZO52,"I recently purchased this video, watched it from start to finish. The details and step-by-step sequences are easy to follow, nice closeups and commentary.  I highly recommend this video for the new or experienced home gunsmith.

An inspiration for anyone wishing to build from scratch an AR-15.",1111104000,,294,5.23404255319149
8053093,5,B0007WZO52,"Who ever thought that anyone other than a professional gunsmith or firearms manufacturer could produce a top-quality receiver from a 0% forging?

This video takes you though all the steps for building an AR15 receiver, just as you would find sold by Colt or Bushmaster. It takes away the ""mystique"" of something the average home hobbyist might feel is over their head, leaving you with the thought, ""Hey, I can build this, too!""

This video is worth every penny! Even the soundtrack is awesome :)  Thanks, Frank!!",1111017600,,513,4.873563218390805
8053094,5,B0007WZO52,"This DVD is perfect for those wanting to machine a lower from a 0% forging. All the information you will need to know is in this DVD and is written from a non machinist point of view, so those with not a lot of experience can follow along and successfully complete this part.

I highly recommend it.",1110758400,2,299,4.245614035087719
8053095,5,B0007WZO52,"As a novice machinist I had no idea where to start working on my forging.  This DVD does an exceptional job of walking beginners through the tool selection, setup, and operations.

The author also does a great job of explaining the reasoning behind his actions.  Even if you never build an AR forging, you can learn a lot about milling just by watching.

This is an invaluable addition to my gunsmithing library and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in building their own rifle from scratch.",1110758400,,500,4.712643678160919
8053096,5,B0007WZO52,"Wonder video, tons of great info.  Great look into how things are made and how much one person can do!",1110499200,,102,4.1
8053097,5,B0007WZO52,"I ENJOYED THE WAY IT IS PRESENTED FROM AN AMATEUR STANDPOINT, NOT SOMETHING ONLY A SEASONED MACHINIST WOULD UNDERSTAND. ONE OTHER IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THE EMPHASIS ON THE MACHINING ON A SMALLER MILLING MACHINE, I FOUND THE DVD TO BE THE MOST COMPLETE AR-15 VIDEO SERIES ON THE MARKET BECAUSE IT CAN INFORM AND INSTRUCT ANYONE FROM THE BEGINNER TO THE VETERAN. NO NONSENSE NO ""FILLER"" JUST PURE AR-15 CONSTRUCTION FROM 0% TO COMPLETE WORKING AR-15. WORTH EVERY CENT- THE ONLY AR-15 DVD YOU'LL EVER NEED TO BUY.",1110153600,,512,4.829545454545454
8053098,5,B0007WZO52,"I own this DVD and have watched it twice. Mr Roderus's DVD is a fantastic piece of work. The step-by-step presentation clearly shows all the machining operations required for building your own AR15 rifle at home. The audio/video are very clear and Frank doesn't skip or fudge on a single step. I recommend this DVD to anyone that's interested in building their own AR15. If you've had interest but have not stared a build then by all means get this DVD & watch it. Right from the get-go you'll get a strong sense of ""I can do this"" All Good...Bud",1110153600,,546,4.47
8053099,5,B0007WZO52,"Mr. Roderus shows you how to take an AR-15 raw forging and turn it into your own complete AR-15 Lower Receiver.  Mr. Roderus even provides and online support forum for those who enjoy doing this kind of work, [...] .  Buy with confidence this is a sound and reasonably price product.",1109894400,,283,4.529411764705882
