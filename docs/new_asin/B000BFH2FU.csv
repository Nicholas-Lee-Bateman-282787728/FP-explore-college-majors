8086120,5,B000BFH2FU,"I don't normally buy romantic comedies, but will make two exceptions: any film with Felicia Day or Leslea Fisher in it. Felicia is just so cuie and energetic in this movie that you can't prevent crushing on her, no matter what your age. I've seen her in EUREKA, THE GUILD, RED, and others and she seems every bit as nice as the characters she plays, once you have seen her do interviews etc. I think she is a natural talent as an actress, musician, writer, singer and artist. Amazing. I always wish I had met someone like her in college. Sure, this film is fluffy romantic comedy, but it makes you laugh and it gives hope that out there there still people with talent who don't feel the need for breast implants of to have to wear dresses made of meat. Felicia is a true artist...maybe not always perfect (LEGEND OF NEIL), but always classy and ONE OF US, the common people.",1381881600,,874,4.401234567901234

8086123,3,B000BFH2FU,I found this movie to be light and too cute. I've forgotten if there was any foul language but problably good for tweens I guess.,1325721600,,129,4.2

8086126,5,B000BFH2FU,"Big Felicia Day fan. This movie was nearly impossible to find elsewhere. I ordered late on a Friday and it was delivered by Monday. Was new as advertised, fully sealed. Played great. I could not be more pleased. Thanks!
Great quirky film. Was made for TV but grade it a PG-13.",1265068800,11,276,4.431372549019608
8086127,5,B000BFH2FU,"How my ratings work:
5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

I first became aware of Felecia Day from her hilarious internet show The Guild. I came across this when looking up her movie work. It sounded good so I bought it; I was not dissapointed. Day really shines as June, a quirky young violinist who dances to the beat of her own drum and doesn't care what others think of her. As for finding love, June doesn't seem to care either way on whether she finds it. That is until one day when she meets Jack, her next door neighbor in her apartment building that she never realized lived there. The two hit it off instantly, but then hit a snag. Jack has an evil fiancee. I won't give away the rest of the plot, but this really is a good movie. It's quirky, it's fun, you can tell everyone is having a good time working on it. There really isn't a weak performance anywhere. As stated before it's Felicia Day who steals the show (rightfully so since she is the star), though the actress who plays her grandmother does have some stealing moments of her own. Day is able to bring out this innocence in June so that you can't help but love her and see how someone could not fall for her.",1219795200,25,1283,4.152610441767068
8086128,4,B000BFH2FU,"I cannot give an unbiased review of this film, because I'm in it.  I just want to point out a couple facts.  First, ""June"" is a romantic comedy and is appropriate for anyone old enough to enjoy that genre.  It's unrated simply because it wasn't released in theaters.  It has no elements of violence, horror, or sexual content (unless you count seeing a woman in her underwear).

Felicia Day, who plays the title character, is probably best known as Vi, a Potential Slayer on the last season of ""Buffy.""  She also won fans for her work in ""Bring It On Again"" and HBO's Emmy-winning ""Warm Springs.""  I, on the other hand, play a small part and have no appreciable fan following.",1154044800,98,676,4.537190082644628
