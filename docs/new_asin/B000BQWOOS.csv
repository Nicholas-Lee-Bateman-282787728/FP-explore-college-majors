8091138,4,B000BQWOOS,"Feroz Khan is an interesting guy. He's the only guy I can think of who can't just wear an awesome ascot with his shirt unbuttoned down to his belly button but also needs a giant gold medallion too. Here, he goes for the gold medallion and a black one. He also takes a supporting role to Mr Dutt, which took me a bit by surprise cause he's usually the star, director, writer, producer, and film god.

Joking and teasing aside, Khan is a genuinely good film maker. His work seems to be influenced mostly by Iranian and Soviet bloc held countries along with the other Indian film makers of the time. It means the editing can get pretty Tarkovsky-esque at times. The set design feels like stuff you'd see from old Soviet Bloc fantasy films (rare but they existed) but with Indian trappings and more importantly color schemes. He likes to add in Iranian style Abbas Kiarostami camera techniques. Finally, he sticks in a ton of the male gangster bonding and religious unitarian stuff from Bollywood films. It's a wild combo.

Khan made a rare Indian horror movie with Nagin. It starts out as fantasy and quickly turns into his version of a Hammer film with heaving bosoms in plunging neck lines, lusty men being given their deadly punishments, and the ever important cat fight (with very obvious male stunt doubles). It also contains some super ahead of it's curve color and editing work. Khan is even wilder than Seijun Suzuki's Tokyo Drifter when it comes to the color games. If there's a shade of a color, you'll see it in this movie.

The biggest issue with the movie is that it never comes off like the horror film that it is. It also doesn't quite come off as a thriller either consistently. The tone is pretty fluid even by Indian film standards. It lives solely within the work of Feroz Khan films and as mentioned before they got their own beat. Honestly, it's not really a big issue but I know it can be for some.",1463961600,,1917,4.518731988472623
8091139,5,B000BQWOOS,Very good movie. Brand new. Sealed. No scratches. Fast ship. Brought back a lot of memories. Wish Bollywood would remake this classic with a new big stars cast. That would be awesome. Thank you.,1426723200,,194,4.735294117647059
8091140,4,B000BQWOOS,"This is an interesting and fun film from India, about a man that happens upon another man under attack from large birds (vultures, eagles, ?) and saves his life.  The good samaritan turns out to be searching for legendary cobras that can take human form, and little does he know he's found one, and it's proved to him in front of his eyes, as the man transforms and does a little number with his beloved.  Of course, none of this man's friends will beleive him so he brings them out to this remote place to see for themselves, and while the cobra/humans are doing their slinky little dance number, the man transforms into a cobra and one of the men, thinking the woman is threatened, shoots & kills the snake.  After which the female takes revenge on each and every one of them for killing her lover.  This is rather long but not boring, and has the obligatory singing and dancing that one expects from Bollywood films.  The dance sequence to ""Tere Mere"" (sorry if I've butchered the spelling) is wonderful.  But....$129 on Amazon?  Are you kidding me?  I bought this for 6.99 a month ago from an Indian movie house so I have to wonder about the legitimacy of that, although it could be out of print now, but still....  If you can find it for a reasonable price & enjoy strange Bollywood films then check this out.  4 out of 5.",1189641600,3,1327,4.423868312757202
