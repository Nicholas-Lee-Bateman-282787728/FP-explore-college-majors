8498118,5,B006H4I1EU,"This movie was one of Ti Lung's best. The story is somewhat a love story, but not enough to detract from the action. Ti Lung collector must have and a Fu fan favorite.",1431734400,,167,4.090909090909091
8498119,3,B006H4I1EU,"Ti Lung is one of my favorites and I thought I had all of his movies, so I was surprised to find this one. However, once I watched it, I understood why I had never heard of it. it is not one of his better movies. The storyline is childish and the action lacks the intensity and excellence that we have come to know him for.",1393545600,2,323,3.909090909090909
8498120,4,B006H4I1EU,The martial arts was good.  The movie flowed easily and the concept was clear.  The english subtitle needs to be improve and also the size of the letters need to be bigger.,1389571200,5,172,4.34375
