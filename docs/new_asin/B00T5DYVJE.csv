7000686,5,B00T5DYVJE,What a collection of some of Debbie Reynolds most iconic roles. I got this collection because I am a huge Debbie Reynolds fan and have most of her movies including singing in the rain which is on this collection. When I learned of her death I knew I had to get this collection because I had yet to see one of the movies in this collection . I highly recommend this movies for any Debbie Reynolds fan.,1484006400,,400,4.207792207792208

7000714,5,B00T5DYVJE,"I've always enjoyed Debbie Reynolds' acting & singing talent.  I enjoy watching her in any movie, but one of my most favorites is ""THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN"" & would also have to add ""SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS"" in, also.  Well, 'SINGING IN THE RAIN"" has to be up there with my faves of hers!  If she's in a movie, I'll go see it!  I own a number of them & not sorry I bought them!!!!",1467331200,2,390,4.092105263157895

7000716,5,B00T5DYVJE,"What can I say? I like the older movies and this fits the bill. There are 5 DVD disks (1 for each movie, (How the West was Won is 2 disks)  which I like, however, they are all on the same spindle, 1 on top of the other) also there no paper notes of any kind to go with this just the movies. If you can live with this (I can) then this is a great buy. (I did place the movies in separate jewel cases for my convenience.(",1464220800,3,419,3.707865168539326
