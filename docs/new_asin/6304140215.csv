8168956,2,6304140215,"When one thinks of football, one thinks of great plays, impossible touchdowns, incredible turnovers, and the sort.  One thinks of the great love of the game, and of cheering on the home team to the bitter end.  However, this gift set never reminds of the like, or of such emotions.  This set offers nothing new, with bad cinematography and even worse scripting.  Many of the NFL's greatest moments are simply ignored in this disaster of a gift set.  These films just simply seem tacked on.  Unless you are one who must have everything pro football, stay the whole nine yards away from this unrecovered fumble.",990748800,2,609,4.752380952380952
