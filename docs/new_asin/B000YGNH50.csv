3028955,4,B000YGNH50,"So I purchased this not too long ago because I've been a fan of the show for quite awhile. I was so happy to see that it was on DVD! Although the quantities are VERY limited, I was happy to see that it was reasonably priced. Most copies are in Canada so I had to go through the Amazon. CA site for the other 2 seasons that have been released.

The only thing I didn't like about this DVD is that it isn't the complete first season - no, this is not Amazon's fault. Teletoon decided to break up the DVD's so really this is the first half of the first season, not the ENTIRE first season. The other half is on a Bonus DVD called ''6TEEN: Yearbook Edition.''

You can find the second half here on Amazon as well.",1324252800,3,709,4.057142857142857

I tried to order complete first season of 6teen, but it is always sold out. where can I get complete first season of 6teen from? 6teen is my favorite cartoon show. I would like to see the very first episode to the last episode, in other words, I like to see every single episode of the whole season. cartoon network hardly show 6teen anymore.",1277856000,,503,4.3052631578947365
3028958,5,B000YGNH50,"Even though it's a cartoon, 6teen is hilarious and entertaining for everyone. I'm 18 and I still catch the show whenever I can. The problems and events that the characters go through are so true to the teenage life. Girlfriends and boyfriends, parents who date, getting jobs, worrying about college, etc. are all things that people, even those who aren't teenagers anymore, go through. Plus, this show is hilarious. The characters are witty and the plot line of each episode is unique and realistic. They aren't hyped up like other shows geared to teens. Each episode is it own funny slice-of-life. If you intend to buy this product, be prepared to buy the other seasons as well, because you won't want to stop watching!",1249344000,,720,4.814516129032258
3028959,5,B000YGNH50,"6Teen is a show about 6 teenaged friends and their lives at the mall.  From the jobs they hate to their social hijinks this series is filled with funny moments we can all identify with.  This set contains the first season, 13 episodes of the popular show originally aired by Teletoon, cartoon networks Canadian counterpart.
I love this set because I never seemed to be able to catch the episodes on Cartoon Network in any sort of logical order, they air season two episodes then season one episodes confusing the watcher as to what is going on.  There is only one minor problem with this set the episode ""The Slow and Even-Tempered"" is not in the correct place on the set (it is on the second disk in the eleventh episode spot) , it was originaly meant to be the third episode of the series and ties into the story line in the fifth episode ""Deck the Mall.""  To avoid some confusion you might want to watch ""The Slow and Even-Tempered"" before watching ""Deck the Mall.""  Other than that this is a great set for the 6teen fan or for anyone looking for a good laugh.",1246147200,3,1063,4.403061224489796
3028960,5,B000YGNH50,"This cartoon is funny. It covers a lot of issues teenagers go through in their daily lives and shows how they cope with certain problems. Awesome show, just wish season two was on DVD",1243296000,,183,4.411764705882353
3028961,5,B000YGNH50,"6Teen is everything Archie Comics could be, if somebody had the nerve to update it.

Fun characters, decent storylines & a really different animation style makes this a standout series. Tales of growing up were never this fun before.

Comes from the same people that created ""Total Drama Island"", with similar art styles.
Setting--- a gigantic shopping mall, in Canada.
Main Characters--
Jen: brunette, the sensible girl. Helpful, kind,  yet bossy. Works at the Sports Barn for maniac employer, The Coach. Step-sister of Jonesy
Nikki: purple-haired nonconformist, forced to work in the Khaki Barn, a store for fashion conformists. Plagued by her co-workers, the Clones, who engage in groupthink. Nikki possesses a whim of steel. Dating Jonesy.
Caitlin: Blonde uber-priviliged girl, fashion-minded, who must work off her credit card debt in a lemonade shop which is shaped like a giant lemon. Forced to wear foam rubber hat, which is shaped like a giant lemon.
Wyatt: Musician, poet & dreadlocked romantic. In love, dumped, writes songs/poem about lost love, which attracts a new love; dumped. Repeat cycle endlessly.
Jonesy: charmer & con artist. Prepetually fired from every job, usually within 24 hours. Dating Nikki. Step-brother of Jen. Torments Jen with pranks.
Jude: Laid back, fun & goofy skateboard dude. Attempts the impossible on his skateboard. No fear...no sense. Loves animals. Obsessed with Zambonis.
