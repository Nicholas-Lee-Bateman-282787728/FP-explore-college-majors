5127992,5,B0083UWX04,"This is an historical issue of some considerable importance coupling, as it does, two key pieces from the repertoire of one of the finest pianists of our time at an early stage in her career. The sleeve comments that this pair of recordings made by the BBC in 1977 have been `lovingly restored, using the finest state-of-the-art technology.' I personally had doubts about the success of this especially as I own fine CDs of the same pieces recorded at a later date by Argerich and which are almost considered benchmark statements.

Well I can immediately report that the quality of the restoration has not been exaggerated. The colour imaging is remarkable, especially for its age, and very little allowance need be made here. The sound is presented in good genuine stereo. The camera work is rather less invasive than in some more recent issues and the detailed work gives a clear account of the performance. These comments must be read bearing in mind that this is not of Blu-ray level of course. Nevertheless it is a considerably superior effort to many later non-HD recordings.

As regards the actual performances, what we get to share here is absolutely what was to turn Argerich into something of a musical icon in later years. All the characteristics of her later playing are clearly here already and that makes this a fascinating record. I found myself wondering if Charles Groves and Andre Previn, the two conductors, had any inkling at that stage that here was a young pianist who was going to turn into something even more special.

What is quite clear is how closely the two conductors follow her every phrase with rapt attention. Their co-ordination of the orchestral requirements with those of Argerich as the performances unfold are object lessons in fine conducting. Other examples of that calibre can be seen in the way Karajan accompanies the young Kissin or Kathleen Battle in the famous New Year's Day concert of 1987.

In summary therefore, and in my opinion, any purchaser interested in the outset of the career of Argerich or anyone interested in the art of fine conducting should find this issue to be of riveting interest. The technical aspects of the recording are remarkably good and should not mar the enjoyment of the music making portrayed. Clearly it would be unreasonable to compare this on exactly the same technical level of a Blu-ray recording so this rating is based on different historical and musical criteria as explained above.

It seems to me therefore that this is a totally successful restoration of an invaluable historical achievement and well-worth the full 5 stars on that basis.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

I'm old enough to remember the original broadcast of the the Prokofiev on 'Andre Previn's music night' and I do remember him saying in his introduction that 'the piece was incredibly difficult and, here to play it is one of THE great virtuosos...'
I agree that this is a superb disc and my only disappointment is that Previn's spoken introduction was omitted. (U.K. review)",1345075200,18,3113,4.984585741811175
5127993,5,B0083UWX04,"If you do not know what a great artist Martha Argerich is, it is not possible to explain this phenomenal artist in a brief review. But it is clear to those of us who have listened to her for decades, that she is one of the great pianists of our time. And if you do know her as an artist you will be familiar with her CD recordings of the Tchaikovsky with Abbado, Kondrashin and Dutoit. All stunning recordings: perhaps even definitive as Gramophone says of her recording of the Tchaikovsky under Abbado. She has also done a marvelous Prokofiev on DGG.
So, her talent is not in dispute. But I sometimes think we forget the astonishing technical difficulty of the works we listen to these days and the intensity of focus required of these great performers. Therefore, to see her play these concerti is almost a revelation even for one, like me, who has listened to these works for decades. These performances are brilliantly played by a brilliant artist. There are moments when you listen and watch in disbelief. Her amazing musicality and technique are almost otherworldly.
And I think most viewers will be surprised at  the orchestral accompaniment
and the fine performances of the conductors: Sir Charles Groves and Andre Previn, who has still conducted the best Rachmaninoff Symphony 2 I have ever heard. Of course, as is always the case, such reviews are subjective. But I found the performances to be thrilling. And I very highly recommend this DVD.
The video is excellent for its time and the sound is splendid.
Do yourself a favor and purchase this DVD. You will not regret a minute of it.",1344211200,13,1595,4.696428571428571

This compiled set at bargain price (and already available in the UK) was lent to me by a friend to assess as a compilation of discs that he knew I was already very familiar with and had previously reviewed either as Blu-ray or DVD. Links to those reviews are supplied in the second section of this review.

..............................................................................................
Section 1
Basic review  General introduction and overview (Links to individual reviews in section 2 below)

This box brings together the Argerich recordings available on Euroarts at a much reduced price compared to the individual issues. All have been reviewed by quite a number of listeners including myself and those reviews can be read under their individual disc titles. The reviews written by myself are based on the Blu-ray format wherever applicable. All discs are still available separately.

So much for the general introduction: Martha Argerich has been a popular and main attraction for the concert-going and record collecting public for a great number of years. Many of those supporters will have already bought a few or several of these discs and will therefore be unlikely to find this box set a financial attraction despite its competitive pricing.

Clearly therefore, this box is not primarily aimed at previous enthusiasts, many of whom will have already purchased at least some of these discs. That assumption has been confirmed in answering comment from Euroarts. The main audience must therefore be assumed to be those starting out on this endlessly fascinating journey of musical appreciation and for those this may well be a very attractive musical and financial proposition. This is despite the lack of the Blu-ray options where they are otherwise available. If such a purchaser were to buy the individual DVD and/or BD discs they would find it far more expensive.

Technically it needs to be noted that all these discs are in DVD format even though most are available separately as Blu-Rays. The DVD format explains the attractively low price but one must expect to find that the resolution, although good, is not the equal of the Blu-Ray alternatives. Playing time for the seven discs is a very generous 11 hours and 19 minutes.

In summary therefore it seems that this set offers a fair and comprehensive portrait of Martha Argerich both as a musician and as a musical personality. She is also somewhat of an enigma and the two documentaries go some way towards both illustrating this aspect of her character which may well be of considerable interest to her legions of supporters as well as providing copious examples of her art as a pianist. The discs focusing on her performances are of similar interest to collectors.

As all the discs are available separately it is very likely that many of these will already be in the collections of collectors. How much this compilation will prove irresistible will depend on how each collector balances what is available here with what is already owned.
Considered without regard to collectors previous purchases this economic set takes on a role of considerable importance.

8524821,5,B0083UWX04,"This is a great DVD.  Others have commented on the performance.  I agree with all of their very positive comments.  I will comment on the technical aspects of the DVD.  The images are clear with great color saturation.  The sound is fine with good frequency range.  I particularly liked the fact the the images selected were mostly of Ms Agerich.  I thought that there was a nice balance between showing her, the conductor and the orchestra however for virtually the entire time the piano was heard one saw the piano.  The camera angle selected showed her hands very clearly.",1397433600,2,575,4.737373737373737
8524822,5,B0083UWX04,"Ms. Argerich is a brilliant performer, and when watching her performances, (all superb) she occasionally smiles to the sound of the music.  A brilliant pianist.

8524823,5,B0083UWX04,"What is it about a Martha Argerich piano performance? I mean there are plenty of well known excellent pianists to be heard,but there is just something special about Argerich. While some flex their ""muscles of technique"",others still hide from their lack of it behind bringing out ""dynamics"" to an extreme measure until they literally reach the point of bringing out the insignificant. Martha has stated before that directness should always be the goal in a performance and one should be careful not to sound as if they are ""immitating themselves"".I know exactly what she means because she never sounds that way. Whenever I hear her play I am struck by the level of emotional ""risk"" being taken. I get the image of one walking the tightrope while juggling. Her level of musicianship(not simply technique or chops)is truly almost unbelievable. In this DVD which is a series of two performances is one of my all time favorite performances of her of the 3rd Prokofiev concerto. Not that there is anything less than excellent of the Tchaikovsky concerto(especially the beautiful Andantino middle part).I simply like the Prokofiev best. There is just nothing less than poetic fire burning throughout the entire piece. It pains me to try to think of words to describe the effect the music has on me. From start to finish Argerich and the London Symphony Orchestra led by Andre Previn truly achieved something special back in May of 1977. At certain times between diffirent parts you can catch Previn and Argerich glancing at eachother as if to acknowledge the fact that they know everyone's on the same page in the genuine effort by all to treat this masterpiece of a composition by Sergei Prokofiev with all the respect it deserves. I can't imagine a stronger effort being put into that task. Bravo! Martha Argerich is a true hero of mine and this DVD is well worth buying.",1369267200,3,1867,4.8742138364779874
8524824,5,B0083UWX04,"Somehow I got Martha's recording of Prokofiev 3 when I was pretty young and fell in love with it (and her).

What I didn't know until kind of recently is that she's a totally fascinating person who is very thoughtful and brilliant. I hate artists that have given no real thought to what their art is: both the aesthetics, and the process. This film shows that Argerich is the antithesis. Saw her perform the 3rd a few years ago in LA. Wow.

Great film I will watch again and again..",1361145600,4,482,4.344444444444444
8524825,5,B0083UWX04,"This is a wonderful video of Argerich playing two fantastic piano concertos. Of the two, her Prokofiev is the outstanding performance.... Just brilliant. The audio quality and video quality are both completely fine, so I am not sure why some people are complaining about that. There is a good balance of camera work on her hands and her face, although at some points one wishes the camera angles were better since in one performance her hair masks her face quite a bit. But that is a small quibble. I have watched it through three times, and it is really great. Highly recommended!",1352592000,8,581,4.705882352941177
8524826,3,B0083UWX04,"This is a DVD re-master of (I guess) an old video tape recording. While it is good for perhaps nostalgic reasons or for archiving the fine performance of the very talented Ms. Argerich, this product is basically un-watchable and un-listenable. The video is poor quality, for example, Ms. Argerich's hand movements are so much blurred that one can't recognize which notes she was playing. The audio reminds me of old cassette tapes of classical music with limited bandwidth, audio noise and poor dynamic range. I can't recommend this product.",1352505600,10,541,5.089887640449438
8524827,4,B0083UWX04,"I have all her four Tchaikovsky recordings. So this is a must-have obviusly. I would say that her touch in this concert is a bit lighter by comparing to any of her recordings. The playing is stunning of course, but the BBC recoded sound is only average. Still, A dvd release recorded in her prime is always welcome.",1350259200,4,315,4.448275862068965
