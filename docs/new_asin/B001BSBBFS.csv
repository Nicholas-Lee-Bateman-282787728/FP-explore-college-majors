8284445,5,B001BSBBFS,"My husband and I both loved Terror By Night. I have always been a major fan of anything Sherlock Holmes, and this film was very well acted. The colorized version was done to perfection and the black and white perfectly restored by Legend Films. All around a 5 star rating! Worth the purchase and invite friends to watch this one with you!",1396224000,,338,4.467741935483871
8284446,5,B001BSBBFS,this is an excellent movie that has been colorized. I really enjoyed the plot and the ending is very good. I wish they would colorize all black&white movies. no cuss words at all. that makes it good to watch.,1392681600,2,208,4.358974358974359
8284447,1,B001BSBBFS,Looking for a review of the Legend Sherlock Holmes here? Well you might be able to find one here but only after searching for the Legend needle among the haystack of reviews of other DVD releases of the many companies issuing transfers of the Rathbone-Sherlock Holmes series. A big thumbs down to Amazon.com for this idiotic postmodernist posting of reviews policy. Bah humbug.,1271808000,7,377,5.0
8284448,4,B001BSBBFS,"Another nice Legend films DVD release with a first class colorized version of the film, and for purists the original black and white version is also included.  Both were made from an excellent print and the DVD includes the original theatrical trailers from other Sherlock Holmes films which are part of Legend's current DVD collection.

""Terror By Night""  (1946) might be called ""Terror On A Train"" as the entire film takes place on a train going from London to Edinburgh.  It is my personal favorite of the Rathbone/Bruce ""Sherlock Holmes"" series and has a real Hitchcock flavor.  And it contains Nigel Bruce's most comical Dr. Watson portrayal, as he gets to bluster and fume for much of the trip; including an especially good interrogation of a prickly academic who occupies one of the neighboring compartments.

Most memorable of all is ultra-gorgeous Renee Godfrey as a glammed-up working class girl in black.  There simply aren't many hotter looking actresses out there than Godfrey, who was still at her physical peak in 1946 and was especially well utilized by director Roy William Neill.  Neill repeatedly poses her in ways that showcase her character's ethereal physical appearance and then bursts the bubble every time she speaks.  Reminding us again and again of the film's theme - that appearances are deceiving.

""Terror By Night"", like most of these movie who-done-its relies on misdirection to throw the viewer off the track.  If it fools you during your first viewing it is worth a second look just to analyze the simple device that originlly threw you off track and compare it with the numerous and more complex red-herrings that were there mostly to keep the viewer from dwelling on the original misdirection.  You have to suspend disbelief on some occasions as Holmes always seems to have a convenient key to each lock (be they doors or riddles) but the short 60 minute running length allowed no time for this kind of detail.

Holmes and Watson have been hired by the son of Lady Margaret Carstairs; she owns the famous Star of Rhodesia diamond and is returning with in from a trip to London where there was an unsuccessful attempt to steal it.  The viewer gradually learns that Holmes believes that the late Professor Moriarty's chief henchman, Colonel Sebastian Moran, was behind the theft and will make another try for the diamond on the train.  Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey) also suspects a second attempt to steal the diamond and has come aboard with a rather transparent cover story about going to Scotland to do some fishing.

Holmes must figure out which of the passengers is Moran before they reach Edinburgh. During the trip there is the obvious attempt to push Holmes from the train along with several less obvious twists.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1263945600,3,2805,4.894291754756871
8284449,5,B001BSBBFS,"Basil Rathbone is sherlock Holmes (to me anyway!), and I'm so pleased to own all of the re-mastered versions of his wonderful work, however I decided to try the newly ""colorized"" version anyway, out of curiosity, and it is really amazing, and so well done.... Most of my favourite films were filmed in b/w, and I treasure them so much. In fact my top three films of all time are all b/w, so I'm sure that to a great number of people I am committing an unforgivable sin by wishing to see a ""colorized"" version of a film, which was only made in b/w.... A great film does not depend on whether it was filmed in b/w, or colour, although I have always found myself drawn to b/w, because most of the films I like weren't made in colour anyway.... I now find that an amazing film company in California, with an obvious respect, and love for classic b/w films, has perfected a way to ""colorize"" them. Legend Films based in San Diego, with so much expertise in the restoration, and re-mastering of classic b/w films, has done an amazing job. The results are hard to believe, and so rewarding to witness. They have only been going for seven years, but their love for film is so evident, so I gave them a chance and bought one fantastic film ""The Mark of Zorro"", (Tyrone Power, Basil Rathbone, Linda Darnel), It's really so lovely to see it in colour, and wait 'till you see the beauty of Linda Darnel, she was pretty.... Terror by Night comes with two discs, one the re-mastered b/w version, and one the ""colorized"" version, which I think is a fair way to treat a great film, so it should appeal to everyone. I think that Legend always give you both versions, so you can please yourself.... They have worked on three Sherlock Holmes classics so far, so give them a chance and enjoy some of your favourite films in colour, I don't think you'll be disappointed.... I didn't set out to like ""colorized"", but I find that I do, and I'm sure that ""Mr Holmes"" would find it fascinating too.",1233446400,4,1973,4.423076923076923
8284450,5,B001BSBBFS,"Another entry in the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes series, Terror by Night features our favorite detectives in this excellent production (easily one of the better Sherlock Holmes films) of a great train caper.  If you're in the market for a solid family movie, this certainly fits the bill, with its solid acting, excellent script and solid direction.

The colorized aspects of the film are a real boon to modern viewing audiences, to whom the grayscale worlds of black and white movies seem entirely alien.  It's important to keep connected with the audience, particularly in a detective story, where the audience's engagement as they attempt to solve the crime is a critical part of the genre's allure.  Watch the black and white and color versions together; you'll be shocked at how different they feel, despite being the exact same film.  Just for that option alone, this is the must-own version of Terror by Night.",1227657600,2,920,5.026315789473684
