By staying closely to the legend of Merlin and King Arthur, and putting character first and effects and battles scenes 2nd (though there are plenty of both) I felt I understood the story of King Arthur for the first time.

I was very caught up and rarely bored, and even quite moved by a fairy-tale which has a happy ending tinged with bitterness and loss.

The cast is generally first rate with Sam Neil, Martin Short and Miranda Richardson all doing excellent work.

This felt true to the spirit of stories that are not just about good people winning, but also about loss, grief and moral compromise.

Please note - you must have a region free DVD player to be able to watch this version.",1447977600,,862,4.535483870967742
