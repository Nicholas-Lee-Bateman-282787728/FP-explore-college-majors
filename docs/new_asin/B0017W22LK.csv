3176005,4,B0017W22LK,"It's definitely a show that is growing on me. I like the interchanges between the people and the supporting characters work too. Love Matthew. And the continuing jokes crack me up.  My fav. eps are the mission one, the one where Matthew goes to Home Depot. the sleeping pills and the wedding. Reminds me of classic sitcoms like Ellen, Mary Tyler Moore and so forth. Very good.",1217116800,2,376,4.611940298507463
3176006,5,B0017W22LK,I love this show so I was very happy to see that Amazon was selling it.  I pre-ordered it and it was shipped the day it came out and I even got it 2-3 days earlier than the estimated arrival date.  Great show.  Great transaction.  Thanks Amazon!,1216598400,2,245,4.148936170212766
3176007,5,B0017W22LK,"I LOVE this show!  I had already purchased the first season, so I had no doubt I would purchase this season too.  It's one of the few tv shows I do watch on a regular basis.  I think the whole cast works well together, but I like Old Christine and Barb the best.  They particularly work well together.  Wanda Sykes always cracks me up, and Julia Louis Dreyfus picked a winner of a show to be on.  She is made for her character!  I love that she is not a perfect anything-- mom, ex-wife, friend, sister. I would highly recommend purchasing this season, in fact I know I will be buying all of them myself.",1216339200,5,603,4.191304347826087
3176008,5,B0017W22LK,"Thank goodness this set got released, there was a chance it was not going to be released becauase some suits said Season one sold poorly. I felt if in fact it did sale poorly it is due to the fact they could've sold more sets if they sold Seasons 1+2 as a full set since the First season was just a half season.

That being said we now have the second season released in co-operation with amazon.com as an exclusive! What you get is the seasons 22 Episodes with gag real and some deleted scenes! This is great! And the case is a standard size keep case with the overlapping hinged dvd holders (think Family Ties- Mannix, Dynasty season 2 etc) and the case contains a slipsleeve cover just like the initial pressings of Old Christine Season 1 was sold with.

Hopefully many will log online and purchase this great set from amazon.com and help boost the shows sales. It is still a fresh and funny show. Maybe this upcoming season more will discover this great comedic show. Last season many shows seemed to just dissapear and many network schedules and conflicts were occuring over the writers strike which confused many viewers and disrupting the normal viewing schedules of fans.

Can't Wait for Season 3!",1214870400,8,1205,4.595348837209302
3176009,5,B0017W22LK,"Early in January of 2008, a mere 15 days after the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Adventures-of-Old-Christine-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000TZ7FTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Adventures of Old Christine - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;Warner Brothers came out with a statement officially announcing Old Christine Season 2! I was beyond excited... until I saw, that very day, that the item had been pulled. Warner Brothers said that it was never supposed to be published and apologized to fans, saying in another press release in March, that sales of Season 1 just weren't good enough to be releasing Season 2.

I was beyond disappointed. But I understood that this, just like anything, is just about the money.

Boy was I wrong about Warner Brothers! They didn't just put Old Christine away on the shelf. They worked out a deal with Amazon to release it! And thank God they did!

This set is a really perfect addition to the collection of any Old Christine fan! The packaging is very simple and well organized and the DVDs themselves are just perfect.

For anyone who had purchased Season 1, you will not be disappointed with this set. This show is just hysterical and the perfect addition to any comedy-fan's collection. For those of you who haven't watched Old Christine yet, this is the perfect time to start. There are two season out there for you to fall in love with. What are you waiting for?

Can't wait to see Season 3 released, either to regular retailers or another Amazon exclusive, real fans of the show will buy from wherever to get this classic show on DVD!",1214352000,6,1650,5.258555133079848
3176010,5,B0017W22LK,"The best sitcom on the air -- and luckily it was renewed for a full season but will move to WED on CBS at 8P this fall-- spread the word.  Julia Louis Dreyfuss definitely deserved her best actress emmy for this role.  If you don't get a huge laugh out of many of these episodes, there is something wrong!",1211760000,6,304,4.135593220338983
3176011,5,B0017W22LK,"My love for the comedic, clumsy Christine Campbell has overcome my love for the sarcastic Elaine Benes.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus portrays Christine Campbell to a T, making me forget all about Elaine's witticisms.  For every rung on the ladder Christine climbs, she falls down two more.  Christine isn't the ""straight"" character with a lot of goofy sidekicks.  SHE is the main attraction herself and is not to be missed.  Her friends and family merely augment her wackiness.  The addition of Wanda Sykes only makes Christine's antics more hilarious, and when they're together, they become modern day Lucy and Ethel.

On the rare occasions that CBS actually puts new episodes of ""Christine"" on the air (hello, full season, anyone?), I am there.  And I will continue to buy her DVDs for as long as they make them (which, sadly, I doubt will be for long with greedy, CSI-loving, reality show-doting CBS execs in charge).

In the meantime, please purchase a copy of ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" and show your support!  You won't regret it!  It won't hurt your wallet -- only your sides from laughing too hard!",1208822400,15,1109,4.877005347593583
3176012,5,B0017W22LK,"This remains one of my absolute favourite comedies.  It's so funny that I even laugh at reruns I've seen here.  This season is, to me, even funnier than the first and in season 2, we see Blair Underwood who is not only so good looking, but also very funny too.  He plays Mr Harris (a teacher of Richies) who Christine develops a crush on.  That story in itself makes this season worth watching.  Here is they was that the episodes pan out in season 2;
THE PASSION OF THE CHRISTINE - Christine and Richard get back together, more out of convenience than out of passion.  But the guy she really has the hots for is Richie's new teacher.
THE ANSWER IS MAYBE - Christine tries to get New Christine to take Richard back, just to keep him from going after an even younger, hotter woman.  And in the process, she finds a new man of her own.
COME TO PAPA JEFF - Christine freaks out when she finds out that she's dating New Christines dad - which means if they got married, she could become Richards stepmother.
OH GOD, YES - Ritchie stars asking questions about religion, after Richard and New Christine take him to church, so Christine reluctantly decides it's time to take him to church herself.
SEPARATION ANXIETY -  Christine tries to help Barb when she learns she's splitting up with Pete, but Christine doesn't understand why Barb isn't more depressed.
THE CHAMP - Christine hooks up with Stan one more time.  She knows that he's pathetic and she could do so much better, but there's something about him she can't resist.
PLAYDATE WITH DESTINY - (one of my favourite episodes) Christine wins a playdate for Ritchie with Mr Harris, which only complicates things for her because she has a crush on him and he can't date parents.
WOMEN AND TUITION - Christine tries to find ways in which to cut back on costs when Ritchies tuition increases.
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - When Richard forgets to complete Richie's mission project, Christine and Matthew scramble to finish in time for the deadline the next morning. Matthew is kept on hold for numerous hours waiting for the Internet text support to help with his problem.
WHAT ABOUT BARB? - Christine and Barb have a hard time agreeing on some aspects of running the 30-minute work-out gym they now own together.
CRASH - Christine and Marly have it ""out"" when they get into a car smash in the school parking lot.
ENDLESS SHRIMP, ENDLESS NIGHT - Christine goes to one of Mathew's parties to help her get out of her rut, and Richard tries to get Ritchie to enjoy carpentry.
LET HIM EAT CAKE -  Christine takes credit for New Christine's birthday present for Richard, which causes many angry issues to arise between the two women.
SLEEPLESS IN MAR VISTA - While on sleeping pills, Christine makes a number of embarrasing phone calls she doesn't remember making.
UNDERCOVER BROTHER - Christine learns a secret about Richard's brother after an awkward kiss.
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS - After Richard tells Christine that she's setting a bad example by not taking interest in the upcoming election, Christine starts being more conscious about the environment. She tries to get signatures for a petition at a supermarket and tries to vote, although she knows nothing about the candidates.
THE REAL THING - When trying to send a dirty email about Mr. Harris (guest star Blair Underwood), Christine ends up sending it to all the parents in the school, almost getting Mr. Harris fired. Christine is also set up with an architect Tom (guest star Dave Foley) who works with Richard. Richard shows Barb (recurring star Wanda Sykes) and Matthew Richie's birth video.
FAITH OFF - Matthew helps Christine discover that Richard isn't the same irresponsible guy he was when they were married, after her irresponsible behavior causes him to lose a job.
MY BIG FAT SOBER WEDDING - Christine ruins a friend's wedding when the groom says her name while toasting the bride, and Richard tells New Christine during the reception that he doesn't want to get married again.
FRIENDS - While shadowing Ritchie, who is on a camping trip, Christine gives Richard some bad advice about getting New Christine back--which only winds up getting them back in bed together again. And Matthew discovers he may be sexually attracted to Barb.
FRASIER - Christine thinks she's pregnant after her encounter with Richard.
If you have ever seen the first season, or want a great comedy in general, this is one to buy.  Julia is amazing as the New Christine and it's a fantastic show that you can see again and again.  I love it.",1208649600,31,4515,4.730279898218829

3176021,5,B0017W22LK,"Christine is as closely as anything is close as anything can get without getting too close -- naked-vision is more harsh than raw is as this show is.

And that's what it is, right? It's a show. Right?

Its all show. Is that what it is,  a show?

Take nothing seriously then.

 Go with the flow. Nothing moving that's moving is something for the heart to consider a critical mass. For Mass is central to all and any decisions made at this moment. My worshipful regard is religious. My spiritual life is certainly anchored to Jesus, my rock who is the only good for no one is good unless he be clothed in the guise of Jesus Christ. If not him, then be him. For your being him confirms the internal desire for peace. For I represent a God of peace.

Something taken hardly seriously is but seen for its irony.

If this is reality than I'm a (you-know-what!) and nothing good comes from that, my being a (you-know-what!).

It possess more questions than answers.

Right now knowing known knowledge assures a doubtful heart.

Doubt is the absence of certainty.

Doubt is the presence of light that casts shadows and shades.

Light is the absence of doubt. There's only believe in the presence of the absence of certainty. No doubt is the present reality of mind-state. Love is the ultimate estimate of value. If not for love then what?
What more is there, Moore?

You and I love each other is the ultimate reality that is reliable. Give into it, Elsie.
You and I are together forever. Accept with a sense of humanity. Humiliatingly is perhaps a sense rethought. Restoration of love is the defence against the neglected.

In that reality is the hope of touch, the moment of embrace is hardly parenthetical as in brackets of parenthesis. Bracelets in brackets of parenthesis look like this (...).

This is the visual image of my mind: (...). ...My mind is (...).

Smile. (...) Its me, smile, it's me myself smile. (...)

Reality is for anyone who wears black when white would do sufficiently well.

What matters is my presence, which is (...).

In either case my wearing white is seen darkly as black for in the present light white is a preferred light.",1473379200,,2146,4.5680628272251305

Added to the mix are Christine's womanizing brother Matthew (Hamish Linklater), who lives with her, and acerbic best friend Barb (Wanda Sykes).

Season 2 includes such classic episodes as ""The Passion of the Christine,"" where Christine and Ritchard decide to give reconciliation a try; and ""Come to Papa Jeff,"" where Christine -- to her horror -- learns she's dating New Christine's father.

Unlike the other cast members, Julia hit a fantastic mark with this show.  Was aired off-and-on in Australia, but never regularly - ordered season one and now season two asap when I saw available from Amazon. This is truly one the funniest comedies of all time for me - a combination of great writing, timing and cast - but mostly the pure genius of Julia's talent - she is not afraid to play the fool and gives her all for her craft.  Her scenes with her friend - now business partner, Barb (Wanda Sykes) are priceless - but then the whole show is for me.  Some of the biggest uncontrolled laughs I've had watching a TV show - be warned, will take twice as long to watch, you'll be rewinding alot to catch the scenes you laugh over.

Wanda Sykes always cracks me up, and Julia Louis Dreyfus picked a winner of a show to be on.  She is made for her character!  I love that she is not a perfect anything-- mom, ex-wife, friend, sister.

I felt if in fact it did sale poorly it is due to the fact they could've sold more sets if they sold Seasons 1+2 as a full set since the First season was just a half season.

That being said we now have the second season released in co-operation with amazon.com as an exclusive! What you get is the seasons 22 Episodes with gag real and some deleted scenes! This is great! And the case is a standard size keep case with the overlapping hinged dvd holders (think Family Ties- Mannix, Dynasty season 2 etc) and the case contains a slipsleeve cover just like the initial pressings of Old Christine Season 1 was sold with.

Hopefully many will log online and purchase this great set from amazon.com and help boost the shows sales. It is still a fresh and funny show. Maybe this upcoming season more will discover this great comedic show. Last season many shows seemed to just dissapear and many network schedules and conflicts were occuring over the writers strike which confused many viewers and disrupting the normal viewing schedules of fans.

I was beyond excited... until I saw, that very day, that the item had been pulled. Warner Brothers said that it was never supposed to be published and apologized to fans, saying in another press release in March, that sales of Season 1 just weren't good enough to be releasing Season 2.

I was beyond disappointed. But I understood that this, just like anything, is just about the money.

Boy was I wrong about Warner Brothers! They didn't just put Old Christine away on the shelf. They worked out a deal with Amazon to release it! And thank God they did!

This set is a really perfect addition to the collection of any Old Christine fan! The packaging is very simple and well organized and the DVDs themselves are just perfect.

For anyone who had purchased Season 1, you will not be disappointed with this set. This show is just hysterical and the perfect addition to any comedy-fan's collection. For those of you who haven't watched Old Christine yet, this is the perfect time to start. There are two season out there for you to fall in love with. What are you waiting for?

3410508,5,B0017W22LK,"My love for the comedic, clumsy Christine Campbell has overcome my love for the sarcastic Elaine Benes.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus portrays Christine Campbell to a T, making me forget all about Elaine's witticisms.  For every rung on the ladder Christine climbs, she falls down two more.  Christine isn't the ""straight"" character with a lot of goofy sidekicks.  SHE is the main attraction herself and is not to be missed.  Her friends and family merely augment her wackiness.  The addition of Wanda Sykes only makes Christine's antics more hilarious, and when they're together, they become modern day Lucy and Ethel.

On the rare occasions that CBS actually puts new episodes of ""Christine"" on the air (hello, full season, anyone?), I am there.  And I will continue to buy her DVDs for as long as they make them (which, sadly, I doubt will be for long with greedy, CSI-loving, reality show-doting CBS execs in charge).

3410509,5,B0017W22LK,"This remains one of my absolute favourite comedies.  It's so funny that I even laugh at reruns I've seen here.  This season is, to me, even funnier than the first and in season 2, we see Blair Underwood who is not only so good looking, but also very funny too.  He plays Mr Harris (a teacher of Richies) who Christine develops a crush on.  That story in itself makes this season worth watching.  Here is they was that the episodes pan out in season 2;
THE PASSION OF THE CHRISTINE - Christine and Richard get back together, more out of convenience than out of passion.  But the guy she really has the hots for is Richie's new teacher.
THE ANSWER IS MAYBE - Christine tries to get New Christine to take Richard back, just to keep him from going after an even younger, hotter woman.  And in the process, she finds a new man of her own.
COME TO PAPA JEFF - Christine freaks out when she finds out that she's dating New Christines dad - which means if they got married, she could become Richards stepmother.
OH GOD, YES - Ritchie stars asking questions about religion, after Richard and New Christine take him to church, so Christine reluctantly decides it's time to take him to church herself.
SEPARATION ANXIETY -  Christine tries to help Barb when she learns she's splitting up with Pete, but Christine doesn't understand why Barb isn't more depressed.
THE CHAMP - Christine hooks up with Stan one more time.  She knows that he's pathetic and she could do so much better, but there's something about him she can't resist.
PLAYDATE WITH DESTINY - (one of my favourite episodes) Christine wins a playdate for Ritchie with Mr Harris, which only complicates things for her because she has a crush on him and he can't date parents.
WOMEN AND TUITION - Christine tries to find ways in which to cut back on costs when Ritchies tuition increases.
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - When Richard forgets to complete Richie's mission project, Christine and Matthew scramble to finish in time for the deadline the next morning. Matthew is kept on hold for numerous hours waiting for the Internet text support to help with his problem.
WHAT ABOUT BARB? - Christine and Barb have a hard time agreeing on some aspects of running the 30-minute work-out gym they now own together.
CRASH - Christine and Marly have it ""out"" when they get into a car smash in the school parking lot.
ENDLESS SHRIMP, ENDLESS NIGHT - Christine goes to one of Mathew's parties to help her get out of her rut, and Richard tries to get Ritchie to enjoy carpentry.
LET HIM EAT CAKE -  Christine takes credit for New Christine's birthday present for Richard, which causes many angry issues to arise between the two women.
SLEEPLESS IN MAR VISTA - While on sleeping pills, Christine makes a number of embarrasing phone calls she doesn't remember making.
UNDERCOVER BROTHER - Christine learns a secret about Richard's brother after an awkward kiss.
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS - After Richard tells Christine that she's setting a bad example by not taking interest in the upcoming election, Christine starts being more conscious about the environment. She tries to get signatures for a petition at a supermarket and tries to vote, although she knows nothing about the candidates.
THE REAL THING - When trying to send a dirty email about Mr. Harris (guest star Blair Underwood), Christine ends up sending it to all the parents in the school, almost getting Mr. Harris fired. Christine is also set up with an architect Tom (guest star Dave Foley) who works with Richard. Richard shows Barb (recurring star Wanda Sykes) and Matthew Richie's birth video.
FAITH OFF - Matthew helps Christine discover that Richard isn't the same irresponsible guy he was when they were married, after her irresponsible behavior causes him to lose a job.
MY BIG FAT SOBER WEDDING - Christine ruins a friend's wedding when the groom says her name while toasting the bride, and Richard tells New Christine during the reception that he doesn't want to get married again.
FRIENDS - While shadowing Ritchie, who is on a camping trip, Christine gives Richard some bad advice about getting New Christine back--which only winds up getting them back in bed together again. And Matthew discovers he may be sexually attracted to Barb.
FRASIER - Christine thinks she's pregnant after her encounter with Richard.
If you have ever seen the first season, or want a great comedy in general, this is one to buy.  Julia is amazing as the New Christine and it's a fantastic show that you can see again and again.  I love it.",1208649600,31,4515,4.730279898218829

3410518,5,B0017W22LK,"Christine is as closely as anything is close as anything can get without getting too close -- naked-vision is more harsh than raw is as this show is.

And that's what it is, right? It's a show. Right?

Its all show. Is that what it is,  a show?

Take nothing seriously then.

 Go with the flow. Nothing moving that's moving is something for the heart to consider a critical mass. For Mass is central to all and any decisions made at this moment. My worshipful regard is religious. My spiritual life is certainly anchored to Jesus, my rock who is the only good for no one is good unless he be clothed in the guise of Jesus Christ. If not him, then be him. For your being him confirms the internal desire for peace. For I represent a God of peace.

Something taken hardly seriously is but seen for its irony.

If this is reality than I'm a (you-know-what!) and nothing good comes from that, my being a (you-know-what!).

It possess more questions than answers.

Right now knowing known knowledge assures a doubtful heart.

Doubt is the absence of certainty.

Doubt is the presence of light that casts shadows and shades.

Light is the absence of doubt. There's only believe in the presence of the absence of certainty. No doubt is the present reality of mind-state. Love is the ultimate estimate of value. If not for love then what?
What more is there, Moore?

You and I love each other is the ultimate reality that is reliable. Give into it, Elsie.
You and I are together forever. Accept with a sense of humanity. Humiliatingly is perhaps a sense rethought. Restoration of love is the defence against the neglected.

In that reality is the hope of touch, the moment of embrace is hardly parenthetical as in brackets of parenthesis. Bracelets in brackets of parenthesis look like this (...).

This is the visual image of my mind: (...). ...My mind is (...).

Smile. (...) Its me, smile, it's me myself smile. (...)

Reality is for anyone who wears black when white would do sufficiently well.

What matters is my presence, which is (...).

In either case my wearing white is seen darkly as black for in the present light white is a preferred light.",1473379200,,2146,4.5680628272251305

We meet the gorgeous Blair Underwood, aka Mr. Harris, and the interaction between him and ""Old Christine"" is hysterical.

3410587,4,B0017W22LK,"The New Adventures of Old Christine is a very funny show. It's also got quite a bit of heart, although it's quite raunchy too. This type of family sitcom is sorely missing from TV these days, but Old Christine delivers it perfectly.

The DVD is very good, although the special features aren't particularly vast or exciting. The picture & audio are great, as you'd expect for a show this recent.",1249689600,,394,4.628571428571429

I watch this show on television and didn't realize just how good Season Two was until I watched it all together on DVD. I haven't liked any other season since and have been close to turning it off in the 2008/09 season.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the cast offer a fantastic symbiosis that carries through the screen. Everyone can relate to some part of this show. If you buy any of the seasons, get this one. Forget about the rest.",1230854400,,585,4.615384615384615

Added to the mix are Christine's womanizing brother Matthew (Hamish Linklater), who lives with her, and acerbic best friend Barb (Wanda Sykes).

Season 2 includes such classic episodes as ""The Passion of the Christine,"" where Christine and Ritchard decide to give reconciliation a try; and ""Come to Papa Jeff,"" where Christine -- to her horror -- learns she's dating New Christine's father.

3410594,5,B0017W22LK,"Firstly, I admit to being biased here - Elaine was always my favourite SEINFELD character - so I was watching with keen interest as to what Julia would get into.  Unlike the other cast members, Julia hit a fantastic mark with this show.  Was aired off-and-on in Australia, but never regularly - ordered season one and now season two asap when I saw available from Amazon. This is truly one the funniest comedies of all time for me - a combination of great writing, timing and cast - but mostly the pure genius of Julia's talent - she is not afraid to play the fool and gives her all for her craft.  Her scenes with her friend - now business partner, Barb (Wanda Sykes) are priceless - but then the whole show is for me.  Some of the biggest uncontrolled laughs I've had watching a TV show - be warned, will take twice as long to watch, you'll be rewinding alot to catch the scenes you laugh over. Bring on season three - I'm in!",1225843200,,928,4.285714285714286

Its not the laugh track, if that was your first guess, but its that damned theme song! I have never heard something so annoying in my life, it bugs the hell out of me!

I give the show probably 4 out of 5 stars, but whenever that stupid song comes on, or its little snippets, I want to throw my TV out the window. So, I knock this down a star, because I just can't take the stupid song.",1225065600,,538,3.890909090909091
