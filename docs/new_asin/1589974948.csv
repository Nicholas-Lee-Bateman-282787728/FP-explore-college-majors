8203107,4,1589974948,"This is a wonderful set from Focus on the Family]s video adaptions of it's popular radio series, Adventures in Odyssey.  Focus puts out the best audio drama around, and this video series is heads above most anything else you'll find on the children's video section of your local Christian Bookstore. All of these cartoons are winners.  Star Quest is probably my favorite.  All three of my kids love these cartoons!

Also check out Veggie Tales for young kids (although some teens love Veggies Tales too, I've found!)

And for some great entertainment when you're on the road, get a set of Odyssey Audio cds.  The 20th anniversary collection is a great place to start!",1229212800,2,667,4.807017543859649
