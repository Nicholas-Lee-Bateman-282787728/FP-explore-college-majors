8173122,5,B000MVVCBS,"This DVD from Nostalgia Home Video is just the second in an 8 movie series starring Lupe Velez as the Mexican Spitfire (filmed 1939-1942).
Since this was first issued, Warner Archive Collection has released a 4 DVD set containing all 8 movies:

The covers are virtually identical, so be careful.

The Mexican Spitfire series is a virtual prequel to I Love Lucy, with Lupe Velez a remarkable combination of both Lucy and Ricky.
Hilarious, especially the third film in the series, Mexican Spitfire Out West.",1366848000,,711,6.623655913978495
8173123,5,B000MVVCBS,"I only recently became well acquainted with the work and legacy of Lupe V&eacute;lez. ""Mexican Spitfire"" is a remarkable film--V&eacute;lez (who plays the role of ""Carmelita"") is funny, sassy, and engaging, and most remarkably, offers a profoundly anti-racist, anti-xenophobic front to very, very prejudiced Americans who try to put her down. This comedy of errors has lots of slapstick humor, bilingual puns, and malaprop language games. A true delight for Spanish/English bilingual audiences who can actually understand what she says when she breaks into Spanish. I am so happy that I was able to get a hold of this film. I would love to be able to see the other films in this series (there were seven!).",1227052800,6,706,5.042735042735043
8173124,5,B000MVVCBS,"The Mexican Spitfire films are simply terrific - I've seen them all and love them all.  I hope that they shall eventually be released as a box set as they would be a pleasure to watch them all; one after the other.

I highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys old BW films.",1193270400,9,274,4.150943396226415
