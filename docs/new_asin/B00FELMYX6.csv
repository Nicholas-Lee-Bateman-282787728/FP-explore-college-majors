8614885,4,B00FELMYX6,"I'd seen this movie 30 years ago and remembered the little rabbit wiggling with happiness when he found out the boy thought he was real.. even tho the special effects are dated, the little rabbit still delighted the children I watched it with!  It's just so much better to be ""real"" rather than animated!",1493856000,,304,4.62962962962963
8614886,1,B00FELMYX6,"Velveteen Rabbit - poor, not enjoyable, unprofessional and too short a production.
Alexander Baxter - Ugh! Could only for cat lovers - if the disc would work all the way through - it didn't.",1425772800,,190,4.617647058823529
8614887,5,B00FELMYX6,This is a wonderful version of the book.  My 3rd Graders loved it!,1422230400,,66,4.076923076923077
8614888,4,B00FELMYX6,"Content was great, but the menu system is not a typical DVD standard, but more like a computer DVD, at least on my Panasonic player.  Everything works fine, just a little surprise.  The content is great and appearance is acceptable, but clearly from the 70's.",1420761600,,259,4.733333333333333
8614889,5,B00FELMYX6,"This movie presents a classic story with a unique visual perspective that allows an odd collection of childrens' toys to come alive.  The movie has a unique feel and has actually aged pretty well.  There is a hazy, dreamlike quality that I find rather interesting to watch.

The second short film, Alexander Baxter, is less engaging than the main film but is still a great story for children.  It's nice to find something for children that isn't all about toilet humor and obnoxious sea creatures.  Adults will also enjoy it, if only to get a piece of nostalgia from their childhoods.",1388275200,,584,4.742574257425742
8614890,5,B00FELMYX6,"This is film is truly a classic. And what is so very special about this lovingly told children's tale is that it's the original live action short film. Many animated versions of this story have been made, but none of them compare to the way this film shows the unique relationship that young children have with their toys. In this film you get to see a real young boy and the special relationship he develops with his pet rabbit. This film is a Toy Story before Toy Story was made. All this young boy's toys and pets have a life of their own and talk to each other. The puppetry is tasteful and would truly capture the imagination of any child. I highly recommend this DVD which includes another charming story about the relationship of a young girl and that cat that finds it's way into her heart.",1383782400,,798,4.398648648648648
