447967,4,6302270405,"Liked this ok, the story is not a real happy one even-though it turns out ok.  Ginger is not the lead but I hadn't really seen much of Frances Dee before so it was good to see this beautiful actress perform.  Later realized she was married to Joel McCrea which Ginger had made some good movies with.",1366156800,,299,4.228070175438597
447968,5,6302270405,My husband and I enjoyed watching this classic movie with Ginger Rogers.  I wasn't even aware of a Ginger Rogers movie in which she did no tap dancing.  It was quite interesting to see how the children of the 30's behaved themselves and compare and contrast them to today's kids.,1363824000,,279,4.56
447969,1,6302270405,"This is a precode Hollywood film, and it shows why the code was so effective.  Ginger is at a wealthy girls finishing school wherein the faculty is more concerned about keeping up appearances than anything else.  The message is the girls can smoke and so forth, as long as they don't get caught.  Well, in comes an innocent new girl and Ginger leads her down the path of getting away with things.  Well, eventually the new girl gets involved with a medical student and nature takes its course.  This movie has value as a reflection of the times, but it is kind of a sad plot.  Definitely not her usual happy go lucky dance films.",1303516800,,629,4.426086956521739
447970,4,6302270405,"Here's another forgotten pre-Code gem that's been revived by the Warner Archive -- and what sharp edges it has, too! Frances Dee stars as young & nave socialite Virginia, newly enrolled in an incredibly snobbish finishing school for the wealthy & privileged. Her mother is flighty, her father distant, and she's essentially thrown to the wolves ... though these wolves wear pearls & minks.

Ginger Rogers, in an early role, portrays the cheerfully amoral but basically decent Pony, who befriends Virginia & tries to show her the velvet ropes of her hew life. But Virginia has a stubborn, individualistic streak & simply won't play along, going so far as to fall in love with Bruce Cabot's dclass medical student Ralph. This leads to a snowy night, an empty cottage, a crackling fireplace, and the camera moving discreetly away from the passionate couple ...

Of course, Virginia winds up pregnant, afraid to tell anyone, and goes into a suicidal depression -- but she's never ashamed of her love for Ralph or her intimate evening with him. It's not guilt that seems to afflict her so much as it is the cold & ruthless world in which she lives, with a class-conscious school more concerned with the possibility of scandal, loss of funds, and Virginia's nonconformity than with her well-being. It's a reminder of just how fiercely populist early films were, even a romantic melodrama like this. The snobbery & outright contempt shown by the upper class was always a deserving target!

Not a film for the ages by any means, but still quite entertaining, with a bit of a social sting for good measure -- recommended!",1300320000,10,1612,4.8545454545454545
447971,4,6302270405,"This movie features a young Ginger Rogers as sort of the wild girl with a redeemable side to her character.  However, the main story concentrates on a young naive well-to-do girl who is sent to a very exclusive finishing school for girls.  Her roommate introduces her to the wrong crowd.  And while the movie tries to convey the message of how artificial the ultra-rich society is.  What it does is show how the wild roommate got the naive girl into trouble.  She ends up knocked up out of wedlock and not finishing school.  Albeit the romantic interest is a young hard working doctor, I would have preferred a cleaner story line to get the message across.  In the end, I'm not sorry I watched it.  But I won't waste my time watching it again.",1271548800,2,743,4.492537313432836
447972,4,6302270405,This is a wonderful movie to watch curled up on a lazy rainy sunday! When will it be available on dvd?,1229817600,,102,3.9047619047619047

7823555,5,6302270405,Great old film. All the things that were unsaid back then are very apparent in this film. Ginger Rogers is young and very funny in this film.,1457740800,,141,4.2592592592592595
7823556,5,6302270405,I caught a little of this movie on TCM and wanted to see all of it.  It's a great movie and I sure am happy to find it on Amazon.,1444953600,,129,3.3
7823557,5,6302270405,"Finishing School has the sort of raw edge of the pre-Code films, the sort that shocks you a little because you pause and ask yourself, ""Did she really say that?""  There's the one sequence where the girls are in a taxi looking forward to a weekend of gin and sin, and the youngest girl decides she wants to experience the weekend without her braces.  It's like something from a John Waters film, the way that they actually reach into her mouth and grasp at the metal wire until it's wrenched out--just not all the way, so that the poor girl is stuck there with three or four inches of mousetrap steel sticking out of the left side of her face.  She doesn't even blink an eye, she's like an animal who just wants to maximize pleasure.  The shocking thing is that among the girls egging her on is Frances Dee, who until now has been the goody two shoes girl who is from the highest of American aristocracy, shocked by the casual drinking and sex play of her classmates.  Now she reveals herself as just as amoral as the rest of them.  That picture of the girl with her braces wedged into one side of her mouth is as disturbing as anything Man Ray or Luis Bunuel was making around the same time.  Can we credit the presence of Wanda Tuchock behind the camera, a Hollywood screenwriter credited here as co-director, for the picture's deeply unsettling picture of women together on a spree?

The film benefits from a raft of astonishing performances, from Frances Dee herself, to Ginger Rogers as her roommate ""Pony,"" to Billie Burke as the vain, selfish mother (like Gladys Cooper in the later ""Now Voyager"") to Beulah Bondi, who could often go sentimental but here is a hard case operator, cold as they come, and always watching and lurking like a cobra.  And then there's Bruce Cabot from King Kong who is a total love god in this picture, handsome as they come, and more understanding than Dee has any right to ask of him.  He's like a big elongated version of the present-day literary critic Kaplan Page Harris, with the same knowing grin.  Tuchock seems to know how to make the most of Cabot's limited acting abilities--just train the spotlights on his cheekbones and let shadows rest on the bones of his forehead and he will seem to be irresistible enough to make even the goodest girl go ""bad.""  He's a waiter in the hotel where Rogers and Dee go to have sex with frat boys--then he's an intern at a children's hospital fighting disease--then he's a crusader in the war against stuffy finishing schools--and he comes down the chimney at Christmas Eve like a lithe, dark, wet-eyed Santa Claus with a big gift for the poor little rich girl.  The thing with the pre-Code movies is, you have to be more adult than it's possible actually to be nowadays, to understand what is actually happening in them.  And this movie, as you can tell by the various reviewer's wildly differing synopses, is not easy to follow--to say the least.  But it is magnificent, for all its cruelty, like an early Pasolini film.",1444953600,,3001,4.552044609665428
7823558,3,6302270405,"In this film, Frances Dee and Ginger Rogers play two roommates at the Crockett Hall, an institution for the daughters of social elite. Frances Dee, playing the leading role, learns that the life at the college is not as fun as she thought it would be. After being frustrated she contemplates suicide when a poor boy, Bruce Cabot rattles up in his shabby Ford and takes her away from all the phonies.

Except for the fine performance of Ginger Rogers as Dees roommate and perhaps Billie Burke as the selfish mother of Frances Dee, the movie has many rough spots. Wanda Tuchok, a writer, and George Nicholls, a film editor, collaborated on directing this project and their inexperience showed throughout the film.

RKO Studios borrowed Billie Burke from MGM for this 1934 film. The film also casted 16 year old Dawn ODay, soon to be named as Anne Shirley, had the supporting role in Anne of Green Gables, also released in 1934, which received rave reviews from movie critics.",1443657600,,973,4.7514792899408285
7823559,5,6302270405,A very good movie,1426291200,,17,3.5
7823560,4,6302270405,"I've been on a nostalgia kick with respect to old films.  This film was made when I was one (1) year old.  It's pleasant for me to think of the stars of that era. In this film, the gorgeous Frances Dee and a very young Ginger Rogers.  With this movie you knew Rogers would be a star. See  Billie Burke before she was the good witch in The Wizard of Oz. Great movie for real film buffs.",1410652800,,385,3.961038961038961
7823561,4,6302270405,"Though mild by today's standards, this pre-Code romantic drama was actually condemned by the Legion of Decency. ""Finishing School"" (1934) benefits from Wanda Turlock's collaborative writing and direction  abetted by an excellent cast. Ginger Rogers shines in one of her best supporting roles. Finally available on DVD, the RKO production has been rescued from its undeserved obscurity.",1398729600,,385,5.754385964912281
7823562,5,6302270405,"This is a very short movie, but one of Ginger Rogers' best. My family and I really enjoyed this one. Each cast member does an excellent job. It is SO rich, snobby 1930s that it is simply a delight to watch over and over again. Beulah Bondi and Billie Burke are at their best too.",1376352000,,279,4.090909090909091
7823563,5,6302270405,"Not half as racy as the blurb would have you believe.  Ginger Rogers does not 'mother hen' her classmate through a wild weekend in New York.  They sneak away form their chaperone and Virginia does admit that 'she's always wanted to get a little tight (drunk).' Her date tries to get a little fresh and she is saved by a nice waiter (in med school, therefore not entirely socially unacceptable).  As the movie progresses Virginia and the intern (oops, forgot his name!) fall in love.  Their relationship is not allowed by the school, who want all the students to marry up, so Virginia is forbidden to see him.
At Christmas Virginia is alone at the school and considers having a drink to cheer herself up but realised how pathetic it would be.  She looks at the presents from her parents, a cheque and a fur coat with the receipt enclosed, not even a card from her mother.  She despairs... then there is a tap at the window- her boyfriend.  They sneak away to the boat house and he gives her a set of handkerchiefs he had embroidered with her initial.  Awww!  And the camera pans away...
After this all his calls are intercepted, his letters thrown away, her letters likewise.  She becomes mysteriously unwell, not herself and the dean recommends that she see the school doctor.  Virginia becomes hysterical, crying that she cannot see the doctor, simply cannot!  Ginger Rogers realises the problem and calls the intern to come and face his responsibilities immediately.  She escapes to the balcony and thinks about throwing herself off but she sees the intern's car arriving.  She rushes down to meet him and he mans up very nicely.  As they leave (presumably to get a special licence) her father offers him a cigar (like the kind given to new fathers at the birth of their child).
So, the blurb says that Virginia ends up pregnant and unpunished.  Sorry, but the 1930's  didn't swing that way.  If she'd been found out Virginia would never have been welcome in another polite family's house ever again.  Her child would not be welcome.  Her grandchild would still feel bitter about the way she was treated.  That's why it was so important for her to have her boyfriend come riding to the rescue at the end.
The storyline was frank compared to late movies and it was banned.  Virginia gets drunk, considers a little light secret drinking to console herself.  She sleeps with her boyfriend but that part is portrayed as a nice girl who succumbs to love when she feels lonely.  The viewer feels sorry for her, these days, but in the forties the movie would have been too shocking to be shown to general audiences.
These days, it's a great movie.",1375574400,3,2642,4.644396551724138
