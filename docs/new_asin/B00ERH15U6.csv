8608774,4,B00ERH15U6,"Funny, odd and definitely an example of truth being stranger than fiction, The Great Hip Hop Hoax documents the truly bizarre story of two Scotsmen claiming to be Californian rappers to get the credibility needed to launch their hip hop careers. Beyond the initial strangeness and the obvious questions about how they eluded detection, the story is really about how faking it til you make it can affect your personality and private life, and what happens when you get caught.

The two singers are undeniably talented at music though it appears they are also persistent character actors and have the personalities to carry an extraordinary but well-intended lie to exceptional lengths. The interviews are well chosen and the documentary reveals some insight into the biases and whims of the music industry, while also laying bare the talents and shortfalls of this remarkable pair. I'm personally amazed that their Scottish-American accent was never detected (it really doesn't pass as generic Californian) but as one music executive says, ""If I assumed everyone was lying about where they came from, I'd never get anything done."" Overall, it's much more entertaining that you might assume from the concept.",1414454400,,1206,5.216494845360825
