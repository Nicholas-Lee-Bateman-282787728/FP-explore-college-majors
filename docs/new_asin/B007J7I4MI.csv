8518247,3,B007J7I4MI,"Rather longish film that could have been pared down..interesting in that it is Russian,the uniforms,the presence of females in the thick of war and the sinister presence of the NKVD ""supervising"" the fighting soldiers...all novel and unfamiliar as we were raised on a diet of British and American war movies..the ending is contrived and  the rescue from the execution squad rings false...but the battle scenes are very good and the heroism of the Russian soldiers was astounding..as entertainment it is value for money",1338595200,3,518,5.240963855421687
