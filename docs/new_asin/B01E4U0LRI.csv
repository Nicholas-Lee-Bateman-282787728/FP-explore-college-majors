8757624,5,B01E4U0LRI,"Trailer Trauma 2 raises the bar with this 3 hour collection of horror classics. This set tries to pair up movies that were billed together and clumps everything by genre as well. For example, you will see back to back slasher trailers, then vampire, then haunted houses etc. These compilations are perfect for throwing on during a Halloween party or watching a few before you pop on a horror movie. Or if you just want to have a trailer marathon!

The absolute best thing about the collection is that the trailers are presented in their true quality and are not digitally tampered with. All the pops, tears, cigarette burns and audio tracks are perfectly imperfect. These Grindhouse trailers are meant to be seen in all their damaged glory, not like a Criterion release.",1512777600,2,770,4.7894736842105265
8757625,4,B01E4U0LRI,"This is a good collection of trailers. There's a lot here from the Hammer horror era, and a heavy dose of Satanic themed films. As a bonus there's a commentary track where a couple guys discuss many of the movies in more detail. I'm looking forward to checking out Trailer Trauma parts 1 and 3 next.",1509148800,3,299,4.357142857142857
8757626,5,B01E4U0LRI,the best collection I have seen so far. Very well arranged. Hilarious!,1489017600,,70,4.916666666666667
8757627,4,B01E4U0LRI,"After surviving garagehouse's trailer trauma 3 awesome 1980's onslaught I decided to go back and pick up their earlier works and while it delivered the same great picture images and sound quality I was kind of disappointed that the ""monsterama"" title was misleading and didn't really include that
Many monsters at all but mostly centered on Satan and witch worship films and as I mentioned they're all in fairly good quality and lots of double bill
Tags From 60's (black & white / color)  I hope that these new kids on the block will really put together a real monsterama fest with the likes on such
Beastly trailers like: day of the animals, prophecy, Orca, nighwing, Q (full version) etc.  still an ""A"" for effort  garagehouse keep cranking them out.",1487808000,2,752,4.769230769230769
8757628,4,B01E4U0LRI,great compilation of movie trailers... this is the 2nd out of three,1486771200,,67,4.666666666666667
8757629,5,B01E4U0LRI,"If you want an amazing trailer compilation covering a wide variety of the exploitation/horror films you love yet you can't decide on which DVD/Blu-ray to start with? The solution is simple--BUY THIS TRAILER COLLECTION, NOW!
  Cult, Exploitation, Euro, and Horror Film fans may know some or even all of these films whose previews are shown here in their orginal  35mm versions.
  The longer the running time that a professionally handled preview collection disc or discs release like TRAILER TRAUMA 2: DRIVE-IN-MONSTERAMA feeds my love of film and my love of film gets better. And TRAILER TRAUMA 2: DRIVE-IN-MONSTERAMAs clocks in at about 3 and 1/2 hours. You get 95 trailers in HD. They may be some standards on here but hang on because before you know it you see a preview and say to yourself I have to get that movie right now! Much like I was.
 This herculean release has been accomplished by the combined  talents of two gentlemen: Mr. Keith Crocker and Mr. George Reis. This outstanding endevor showcases the love not only for these films (that need to keep been rediscovered and remastered) with Keith and George allowing the use of these trailers for this compilitaion from their own personal respective collections.
 Seriously thank you, Keith and George for your dedication, creativity, vast cinema knowledge, and of course a great, fascinating commentary track.
  When is TRAILER TRAUMA 3: REVENGE OF THE DEMON SPEEDSTER (non-existent film I just thought up) coming out? (With a commentary, please).",1485561600,3,1509,5.048387096774194

8757631,3,B01E4U0LRI,"here is the 95 faded trailers list on this blu ray nothing to write about

sorry reis and crocker",1465603200,,317,4.064516129032258
8757632,5,B01E4U0LRI,"If you're not impressed by the notion of having ninety-five (!)  Horror, Shock & Exploitation trailers gathered up onto one BluRay DVD, and all of them looking and sounding better than you're likely ever to have seen before, then consider this: If you're old enough to remember anxiously scanning  the various NY area late night, morning and afternoon horror showcases on WWOR-9, WPIX-11, etc. during the 70's and early 80's, then you're in for a treat by switching over to the commentary track.  The entire massive block of trailers is presented by two of the most enthusiastic (and knowledgeable) fans of the genre imaginable and the experience is akin to kicking back with two like-minded pals who's youth was filled, like yours, with late-night TV, drive-ins and Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine.  While their commentary sometimes get carried off into areas that have little to do with the trailer being unspooled, anyone who can get worked up and lovingly gush poetic over battery acid being thrown into a character's face is precisely whom you want to spend nearly three hours with as these trailers flash by.  Neighborhood guys, these --- and the pals you wish you had when you couldn't find anyone to go with you to the local cinema for a triple Blood-O-Rama shock show!  Here's hoping there's a third volume (they didn't contribute commentary to the first in the series, sadly) and that we can welcome them back.",1465084800,9,1425,4.916666666666667
8757633,5,B01E4U0LRI,"This compilation is mind-blowingly badass. If you are a fan of the old Sinister Cinema trailer collections, here's a full on HD remaster of some real classics that's just like watching them on the big screen . . . plus dozen and dozens of rare trailers never before seen, some from films I've never even HEARD OF.  All in, this thing is THREE AND A HALF HOURS of pure horror trailer nirvana.  YOU NEED THIS NOW.",1462060800,10,411,4.394736842105263
