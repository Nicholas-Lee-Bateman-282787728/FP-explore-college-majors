8325140,5,B000GUK1XU,"A good carry on from the classic  ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES. Good new characters and plot with the same Boyce and Marline as you always loved before.
Theme tune could have been better, as a song writer I would have come up with something that had a bit more poke!
But all in all an enjoyable British classic.",1349222400,,304,4.241379310344827
