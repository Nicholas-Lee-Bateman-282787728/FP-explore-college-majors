3776278,4,B001RHV6NU,"Now I'll be honest from the start in that I know I'm really late to review this DVD set but that's strickly because I was never a huge fan of Jeff Jarrett & always felt like Jeff Jarrett was just one of those guys who I just never saw as a main event top guy who I would go pay my money to see either has a babyface or heel.  He's had some average to good matches but none I would concider ""great"", ""classic"", ""memorable"" or standout in my head stricktly for anything Jarrett himself did.  So this is a release that I wasn't in a hurry to get but I got it as a gift & I have to say that after hearing Jarrett's story told that I've gained more respect for him both in the ring & outside of it.

The setup is very similar to how TNA did Kurt Angle's in that each chapter of Jarrett's story was split inbetween each match with each disc centered around different periods of his life with the first disc talking about his early life & Memphis wrestling days, disc two talking about his career in both WWE & WCW, and the final two on his current stage in TNA.  You'll hear from various TNA talents yhroughout the documentry such as wrestlers (Sting, B.G. James, Scott Steiner, Mick Foley, Booker T), other on-air talent (Jeremy Borash, Jim Cornette, Mike Tenay), those working behind the scenes (Dutch Mantell, Terry Taylor, Harris Brothers, Bob Ryder) and personal friends like his best friend & Mark Miller from the country music group Sawyer Brown.  You also get various highlights of memorable moments from Jarrett's TNA like his interaction with Toby Keith from the debut show, his fight with the Tennessee Titans, the incident at Hogan's press conference in Japan, his post-match Bound For Glory '06 interview, the Slammiversary tribute to his wife Jill, and his return to TNA on ""Impact"" before Lockdown '07.

The program started out talking about growing up & getting into sports like basketball along with his wrestling ""family tree"" & the stars of the past who influenced him.  His beginnings in the Memphis CWA territory was covered with Cornette explaining how every positive he had was also a negative before going into his first ever angle in wrestling and who he felt were his ""teachers"" in the ring.  Jarrett's thoughts on the end of the territory system & his international travels are discussed before going into the story of how he almost ended up in WCW before going to WWE, creating the ""Double J"" character, meet a friend for life in B.G. James, and how that ended up going bad for himself.  The story of how he met his wife Jill & what happened when they found out she first had breast cancer.  Jumping to WCW & seeing all the mistakes being made on how the company was ran was talked about next before going into his return to WWE and the story behind his infamous shoot promo his first night on TV that the backstage talent didn't like.  One of the highlights of this DVD came next as Jarrett told his story of the infamous backstage story of what happened between himself, Jim Ross, and Vince McMahon at No Mercy '99 on Jarrett's last night with the WWE when he was the Intercontinental Champion...who's contract expired the night before & was already set to debut on Nitro the next night.  His return to WCW and the constant problems there were discussed by him & former WCW members before briefly talking about the Bash At The Beach '00 incident.  The story behind Vince McMahon ""not paying a dime"" for WCW when he brought it & Jarrett's thoughts about the first segment on RAW Vince telling people that Jarrett was ""G-double O-N-double E.""  The next big highlight of this DVD came next when he along with other like Foley & Cornette recalled everything that happened the night Owen Hart died at Over The Edge '99 (to the point where Jarrett to this date never looked back at his pre-match interview for his match) & the impact backstage of the message he did the next night on the tribute show.  The story of how TNA came together from the ""Summer Of No Worries"" to Jarrett working the independent scene & international tours to actually putting everything together along with memories of the problems that happened on the first show.  Jarrett's thoughts on people calling TNA an ""independent promotion"" & the influx of the Carter family into TNA are discussed before going into another big part of this DVD which was the story of Jill ""winning the race that matters"" when she lost her battle to cancer.  The program ended on Jarrett talking about milestones of his career, the future for TNA, and his favorite memories.

Other matches include his first NWA Championship win against Ron Killings, an eight man tag with Dusty Rhodes & Road Warriors vs. Triple X & Vince Russo, Jim Duggan & Rick Steiner.  You also get archived video footage from his days in the CWA promotion in Memphis such as his first TV appereance as a referee, one of his first TV matches against Tony Falk, current TNA spanish commentator Hector Guerrero, a title match against Jerry Lawler, and a tag match with Bill Dundee vs. Gary Young & Mick Foley as Cactus Jack Manson.

Matches Include:
vs. Scott Hall - This was an ""unofficial"" stretcher match as Hall brought a stretcher down to ringside (one of those ""army"" ones, not the metal ones you see an a regular ambulance).  This was a brawl right from the start that worked it's way all the way through backstage (with Jerry Lynn getting nailed in the process) & the crowd before settling down in the ring using the stretcher was a weapon various times by both men before tons of interference by Ron Killings, Monty Brown, Jerry Lynn getting a reciept from earlier, A.J. Styles, The New Church, and Ricky Steamboat.  This was a good brawl between both men.

NWA Championship Match vs. A.J. Styles - This was a match that went back & forth with both men trying to match each other's different wrestling styles.  You see appearences from Larry Zbyszko, J.J. Dillion, Dusty Rhodes, Vader, Harris Brothers, and Sonny Siaki doing something that turned A.J. Styles babyface in the middle of the match.  A nice match overall.

NWA Championship Match vs. Raven - This was the most anticipated match in the first year of TNA to the point where they had to turn away many people from the Asylum & it should also be noted that the women in Raven's corner during this match is the woman now known as Mickie James in WWE.  Both men got busted open in the opening minutes as this went from a normal wrestling into a brawl with tables being broken & both on the giving & recieving end of low-blows.  Appearences from the ECW reunion faction of ""Extreme Revolution"", Sabu, and the S.E.X. stable just added to the wildness of this brawl.  This was a wild match that had a mix of everything for everyone.
(Nevermore: Best Of Raven, History Of TNA: Year One)

w/Sting vs. Sean Waltman & A.J. Styles - This was from TNA's first anniversary show & it should be noted that Vince Russo (who was feuding with Jarrett) was on commentary so there is a bunch of censoring because Russo couldn't control his language.  This was just a wild brawl between all four men that saw interference from Shane Douglas & Raven & Russo himself along with Sting's baseball bat coming into play various times.  Again, a wild but fun brawl.
(Sting: Return Of An Icon)

vs. NWA Champion A.J. Styles - The feud between these two was so intense that Erik Watts & Don Callous had to seperate them before the bell rang.  This was another match that developed into a brawl that went through the crowd with the audience with the crowd getting behind A.J. more & more as the match progressed.  In the end however, Jarrett captured his second NWA Championship.

NWA Championship Match vs. Chris Harris - This match was all about one thing, ""was Chris Harris ready"" to compete at the main event level?  Jarrett was always one step ahead of Harris in the opening minutes of the match before Storm stepped his game up & brought the fight to Jarrett including doing a clothesline off the top rope into Jarrett who was in the front row.  Harris kept coming so close with Raven & Harris tag team partner, James Storm getting involved.  Good competitive match between those two.

King Of The Mountain Match vs. NWA Champion Ron Killings vs. Chris Harris vs. A.J. Styles vs. Raven - Now for those who never seen a the King Of The Mountain match before, it's a ladder match in reverse with alot of stipulations. To win the match, you have to use the ladder hang the belt instead of using the ladder to pull it down like a normal ladder match. However before you can hang the belt, you have to qualify to do it by scoring a pinfall/submission over one of the other competitors...and the person who loses that fall goes into a penality box for 2 mins. Yeah, sounds real gimmicky but when you watch it come together...it's a real easy match to follow.  This match had non-stop action with plenty of table spots & various stories being played like how Jarrett & Raven decided to form an alliance, Harris & Raven brawling when stuck in the penality cage together, while Russo was the belt holder but didn't want to give it to Jarrett.  This was the match where Jarrett earned the nickname that has stuck with him to his day, ""The King Of The Mountain,""

Gauntlet for Gold Match vs. 3 Live Kru vs. Elite Guart vs Ken Shamrock - It should be noted that the member of the Elite Guard faction known as Hernandez is the same Hernandez who would later be better known as the partner of Homicide in L.A.X.  This was your average gauntlet match between all men involved where you get eliminated by going over the top rope with the final two facing off in a normal wrestling match.  The highlight of his match was Ken Shamrock going absolutely crazy to the point where he went after Don West & almost scared him to death before taking out the security guards & becoming the difference maker in the match.

NWA Championship/Ladder Match vs. Jeff Hardy - There was some good spots as Hardy is great at hardcore type matches but it seemed like everyone was more concerned about putting over the reunion of Scott Hall & Kevin Nash than having a great match as Scott Hall just kept interfearing & the ending was weak as Nash came out with gutairs for him & Hall and all three guys hit Hardy with it to cost him the match.
Victory Road '04
(Enigma: Best Of Jeff Hardy)

NWA Championship Match vs. Monty Brown - This was the title shot that Monty Brown wanted for a long time however his ribs were taped up from an attack by Abyss earlier in the show.  Brown dominated with his power early while Jarrett got the advantage by working on Brown's ribs but Monty kept coming & coming until Scott Hall became the difference maker once again.
""Impact"" Dec. '04

NWA Championship Match vs. Kevin Nash - The ""Kings Of Wrestling"" was split apart by greed & ego resulting in this main event.  Nash used his power early as this went into a brawl through the crowd to the outside of the studio before settling back into the ring with Jarrett gaining the advantage by working on Nash's knees.  There was a rule set in place before the match that if Jeff Jarrett used a gutair, he would lose the NWA Championship so Jarrett found a creative (or comical) way to get around that rule.  With appearences from the former Billy Gunn (Kip James...who had a confrontation with his former New Age Outlaw partner & DX member B.G. James) & another former DX member in Sean Waltman...this was a better match than you would have expected going in.
Against All Odds '05

NWA Championship Match vs. Rhino - This match was the sterotypical formula of a Jarrett match. Wrestling, a big brawl throughout the arena, and an overload of outside interference. The match with the wrestling & brawling was actually very well but the match took a turn for the worst when ALL members of Team Canada kept interfearing in the end to cost Rhino the match.
Turning Point '05
(Best Of Bloodiest Brawls: Scars & Stitches)

w/Abyss & America's Most Wanted vs. Rhino, Ron Killings, Team 3D - This was a wild eight man tag that just went all over the place & settled into a good tag team match with even Jackie Gayda & Gail Kim getting involved at one point.
Destination X '06

Lethal Lockdown Match w/Scott Steiner & America's Most Wanted vs. Sting, AJ Styles, Ron Killings, Rhino - This was the first Lethal Lockdown match where they had the top of the cage lowered onto the Six Sides Of Steel after everyone entered. Team Jarrett always had the one man advantage (notice how in War Games history, the good guy team NEVER won the backstage coin toss?) The typical formula of the faces fighting from behind against the heels but once Sting enters, the top of the cage lowers & that's where the match gets interesting as AJ Styles & James Storm go to the top & AJ hits a splash from the celing of the room through Storm & a table.
Lockdown '06
(Best Of Bloodiest Brawls: Scars & Stitches)

w/Scott Steiner vs. Sting & Samoa Joe - The main story here was if Samoa Joe can hang with the wrestlers outside of the X division & be concidered a legit main eventer and he proved himself during this match. Sting knows exactly what to do to get the crowd to go wild, Jarrett & Steiner were great as heels plus did a good tag team match. It didn't come close to the tag team title match but it was still a good showing from all four guys.
Sacrifice '06
(Sting: Return Of An Icon)

King Of The Mountain Match vs. NWA Champion Christian Cage vs. Abyss vs. Ron Killings vs. Sting - Just like the other King Of The Mountain match on this set, this was something to watch as you see multiple stories being told at different times like if Sting really wants to be World Title or if he just doesn't want Jarrett to have it & the tension between Sting & Christian. However, the ending really overshadowed the whole match as they were tryin' to do a ""Montreal Screwjob"" ending with Jarrett (HBK), Larry Zbyszko (McMahon), and Earl Hebner. You could see how the TNA fans felt about this match & the idea of Jarrett having ANOTHER title reign at the end.
Slammiversary '06

Fans Revenge Lumberjack Match vs. Samoa Joe - This was nothing more than a comedic gimmick match that went a little over 10 mins. with Jarrett getting in just as much offense as Joe. The ending of Joe choking out Jarrett was something everyone expected but it didn't matter in the end as this was a non-title match, everyone (including TNA itself) looked past this match & was more focused on Sting's match the next month, and no body cared that he walked out with title belt after the announcement at the end of the show...which was Kurt Angle joining TNA.
No Surrender '06

NWA Championship Match vs. Sting with Kurt Angle as Special Enforcer - This wasn't their ""paint by numbers"" match like they had a Hard Justice but again, it wasn't the best match to end the show on. This was the conclusion of the 10 month storyline between Sting & Jarrett. Sting had a new look & looked in the best shape in years (include before WCW closed). This match was better than you would expected it to be but didn't live up to the hype of being ""the main event of the biggest show of the year."" The match delievered in the end & give the fans what they wanted to see: Sting winning the title & removing Jarrett from TNA.
Bound For Glory '06

Lethal Lockdown Match w/Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Rhino, Sting vs. Christian Cage, AJ Styles, Scott Steiner, Abyss, Tomko - These Lethal Lockdown matches get better each year with this one being the best one yet as it told multiple stories thoughout the match along with memorable moments that topped the previous years. One funny moment to watch for it Jarrett's entrance where the pyro completely destroys his gutiar before he even walks down the ramp. Other memorable moments include Scott Steiner breaking out the Frankensteiner for the first time in a long time, Kurt Angle throwing AJ Styles off the top of the cage onto other wrestlers on the floor, Rhino goring Tomko out of the cage to the floor, Cage's double chokeslam onto tacks, Abyss getting hit in the head with a gutiar full of thumbtacks, the unfolding of the ""can you trust Jarrett"" angle, and for the old school fans...Harley Race (the gatekeeper at ringside) knocking out Jim Mitchell. Awesome main event.
Lockdown '07

vs. Kurt Angle with Mick Foley as Special Enforcer - After not wrestling (with the exception of two matches) in 2 years, Jarrett surely didn't show any ring rust here as they delievered a great wrestling match that went back & forth between both men with Mick Foley & ""Mr. Socko"" only becoming a factor in the end. Great wrestling match that delievered.
Bound For Glory '08

In the end, the documentry itself gave me a few found respect for Jarrett just knowing his history along with his trials & tribulations in this business both as a talent and operating his own promotion.  However, the matches themselves I will say were entertaining for the most part but just furthered my thoughts in that if you see one Jarrett match, you've seen them all as a high majority of them saw brawling & fighting through the crowd & interference from others but at least TNA put a different variety of matches on here throughout their entire history so the matches don't look repetative so in the end, this is something I would recommend for a purchase.",1261872000,,17328,4.533974358974359
3776279,5,B001RHV6NU,This is in my opinion the best DVD produced by TNA wrestling to date. Has alot of interesting stories told by Jeff Jarrett. Also has some of Jeff's early matches from the CWA. This is a must have for Wrestling fans!,1242950400,,215,4.2682926829268295
3776280,5,B001RHV6NU,Excellent Story on Jeff Jarrett. I really understand where he comes from. And a definite  must buy. You won't see Jeff Jarrett the way again.,1242691200,,141,4.64
3776281,2,B001RHV6NU,"Until the recent arrival of Mick Foley...I've taken only a passing interest in TNA. Sting is of course a classic figure and Kurt Angle is the real deal but its founder Jeff Jarrett always struck me as a guy who's position was due to his well position as founder and not due to his charisma or wrestling  prowess.  This DVD set , which I purchased out of curiosity and to find  out what I wasn't getting only solidified my opinion  that Jarrett is a second  tiered performer. I can't really remember any 4 DVD set dedicated to a performer in any field that is so second  rate..I guess if Andrew Ridgley of WHAM fame released a box set of his solo work we'd have a comparison to this. Jarrett should be the wrestler  that goes on to put over new stars instead of borrowing shtick from The Honky Tonk Man and  putting himself over and over and over.

With so many amazing wrestling DVDs on the market I can't recommend this set to any serious fan.",1242518400,2,944,4.318181818181818
3776282,4,B001RHV6NU,"In the summer of 2002, the ""King Of The Mountain"" Jeff Jarrett organized the number one growing Professional Wrestling corporation today, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Not only is Jeff Jarrett the creator and founder of TNA Wrestling but he is also a former NWA Heavyweight Champion, WCW Heavyweight Champion, WWE Intercontinental Champion, & WWE Tag Team Champion.

This four disc set covers Jarrett's early career working for his father all the way up today to where he is in TNA. Throughout the four disc set, you will hear from Jeff Jarrett himself, TNA President Dixie Carter, Terry Taylor, TNA Executive Jim Cornette, TNA Creative Writer Vince Russo, TNA ring announcers Mike Tenay, Don West, & Jeremy Borash, The Harris Brothers, and members of the TNA roster including Sting, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Scott Steiner, AJ Styles, Mick Foley, BJ James along with a few other people as well. The set is presented just like Kurt Angle's ""Champion"" two disc set as where Jarrett will discuss one topic which would then lead to a match.

Also throughout the set, you will get 23 plus matches in their entirety along with a few great TNA moments involving Jeff Jarrett such as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's first live PPV event where Jeff Jarrett confronted country singer Toby Keith, Jeff Jarrett attacking Hulk Hogan in Tokyo, Japan from 2003, and also the announcement of Kurt Angle coming to TNA.

Disc 1
The program starts off with Jeff Jarrett discussing about his early childhood, playing basketball in high school, and soon moving into liking Professional Wrestling. Jarrett's very early professional wrestling career working for his father's wrestling promotion starting off refereeing and also discussing his grandmother's relationship with wrestling. Jarrett talks about how he learned a lot from Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and how Lawler influenced so much on Jarrett's career. Jarrett also discusses where he got his ""Strut"" from.

7.31.2002
Vs. Scott Hall
This match was a brawl with very little wrestling happening inside the ring. Hall pretty much dominates Jarrett with Jarrett using everything he can to stop the domination by Hall. Hall and Jarrett fights all over the arena here. Throughout the match, Hall and Jarrett uses a folded stretcher on each other. Ends with Ricky Steamboat getting involved allowing Jarrett to hit the ""Stroke"" to Hall on a steel chair. 4.5/5

11.20.2002
NWA Heavyweight Champion
Vs. Ron ""The Truth"" Killings
Truth was the defending champion here and he put a very solid wrestling match with Jarrett. This was a complete different match then the previous match Jarrett had with Scott Hall. The Truth and Jarrett displayed a great back and forth match up with Jarrett getting bloody. With help from Mr. Wrestling 3 who turned out to be Vince Russo, Jarrett became the new NWA Heavyweight Champion. 5/5

1.15.2003
W/ Dusty Rhodes & The Road Warriors vs. Christopher Daniels, Low Ki, Elix Skipper, & Vince Russo
Russo was playing the scardy cat role as he actually came out to the ring wearing a hockey helmet. Animal displayed a great demostration of stength in this match with Hawk (RIP) and Rhodes not having a bad showing either. Again this match ends with a interference by Mr. Wrestling 3 who turned out to be  Nikita Koloff. 4/5

2.19.2003
NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. AJ Styles
Jarrett put on another great match up with another growing star in the ""Phenomenal"" AJ Styles as he did with The Truth. This match too was very back in forth with the interferences by Larry Zybisko, the Harris Brothers, Dusty Rhodes, and Vader not hurting it one bit. Awesome match. 5/5

4.30.2003
NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Raven
Raven, mostly being known for his hardcore side, actually put on good wrestling match along with Jarrett for about the first 10 minutes of the match until it really got hardcore. After Raven begins to bleed, a table gets introduced where Jarrett drives an elbow to Raven through the table. In the end we get an appearence by the Extreme Revolution along with the return of Sabu. A great match displaying the toughness and heart of Jeff Jarrett. 4.75/5

6.18.2003
W/ Sting Vs. AJ Styles & Sean Waltman (X-Pac)
Styles was the current NWA Heavyweight Champion at this time and was still having his relationship with Vince Russo in tact. Sting however was in his first U.S. match in about 2 years or so. The early going between Styles and Sting really gets you into the match from start to finish. A strong showing from all four men but especially Sting in particular. A pretty good tag team match up. 4.5/5

Disc 2
The second disc opens with Jarrett talking about his world travels early in his career while working for Memphis wrestling which would then move to Jarrett debuting in WWE in 1993 with his country music singer gimmick along with BG James talking about their duo in WWE and also the troubles in WWE at the time and Jarrett's first run in WCW and also WCW's problems. Jarrett leaving WWE in 1999 and his deal with Jim Ross and Vince McMahon on his release from WWE after No Mercy in 1999. Jarrett also mentions that he bets that Vince McMahon didn't pay a dime for WCW and Vince just in reality took WCW away from Ted Turner. Also the last night of Nitro and where Vince McMahon ""firing"" Jeff Jarrett on Raw. Jarrett also touches on his wife and her situation with breast cancer and also Owen Hart's accident in 1999 that led to Owen's death.

10.23.2003
NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. AJ Styles
Much different match then their first meeting. Jarrett and Styles both looked intense to take each other both out once and for all. This is another great NWA Heavyweight Title match and it delivered as well. Possibably better then their first macth from disc 1. 5/5

10.29.2003
Vs. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan
This match was one of Duggan's best matches believe it or not. He didn't look to be that out of shape. Rick Steiner makes a return here in this match as well. The closing moments of the match is the anticipation of the returning Sting. 3.5/5

3.17.2004
NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. ""Wildcat"" Chris Harris
This was definitely Harris' biggest match of his career. Harris showed some great wrestlin ability here in this match with Jarrett. A great match, possibably Harris' best singles match in his career. 4.5/5

6.2.2004
King of the Mountain Ladder Match
Vs. Ron Killings vs. Chris Harris vs. AJ Styles vs. Raven
This was the first KOTM match in the history of TNA. Now the rules of this match are a little confusing if you read them but they do work out during the match. You must score a pin fall in order to qualify to climb the ladder to hang up the title belt and the loser of the fall must spend 2 minutes inside a penalty box.

Not a lot of spots involving the ladders until the end but this was still a great match nevertheless. Jarrett and Styles had a good brawl on the outside. The pinfalls and qualifications of the match were paced very well. Tables also gets introduced in the match which would come into play towards the end of the match. But in the end it was Jarrett winning the match to become the first ""King of the Mountain"" hencing the nickname. 5/5

7.7.2004
Gautlet for the Gold Match for the NWA Heavyweight Championship
This match was just here for Jarrett retaining the NWA Heavyweight Champion with Ken Shamrock helping Jarrett to retain the title against Ron ""The Truth"" Killings. Worth watching but nothing really sticks out. 3/5

Victory Road 2004
Ladder Match for the NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Jeff Hardy
Awesome ladder match. Many great spots involving the ladders. But in the end it became more like a handicap for Hardy as he had to fight off Jarrett and Scott Hall at the same time. In the closing moments, it was Kevin Nash and Scott Hall screwing Jeff Hardy from winning the title belt and helping Jarrett to retain the title. 4.5/5

Disc 3
In disc 3, Jarrett morely discusses in how he created TNA Wrestling along with his father and why he wanted to create TNA Wrestling along with Jarrett explaining his struggles in trying to put TNA on the map. Jarrett also discusses how he came across in meeting the future TNA President, Dixie Carter and how it was meant to be for TNA to happen. Jarrett also stresses the fact how WWE and TNA are the only 2 wrestling promotions that are still running today. Jarrett also explains why he took a break from TNA after Bound For Glory in 2006 with the passing of Jarrett's wife.

Impact 12.3.2004
NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. ""The Alfa Male"" Monty Brown
Brown was wrestling this match with taped up ribs. The Alfa Male was really taking it to Jarrett with Jarrett targeting the injured ribs of Brown every chance he could. Another great NWA Heavyweight Title bout with the interference from Scott Hall not really hurting it that much. 4.5/5

Against All Odds 2005
NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Kevin Nash
Nash didn't really look to be on top of his game here but he still performed well with Jarrett. Jarrett gets bloody here after being dominated by Nash. At one point in the match, Jarrett brings out a chello (similar to a guitar) but would only get Jacknifed through it. A kind of an unique match but it's still worth a watch. 4/5

Turning Point 2005
NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Rhino
This match starts off in the ring for about 5 minutes then moves to the outside where the majority of this match takes place. They fought all in the crowd and Jarrett takes a brutal shot to the metal wall by the entrance area. Rhino even sets up a table infront of the tunnel and gores Jarrett right through it but the table doesn't really breaks. Lots of interference in this match which took away from the match. Brutal match. 4/5

Destination X 2006
8 Man Tag Team Match
W/ America's Most Wanted & Abyss Vs. Team 3D, Rhino, & Ron Killings
This is only of the craziest and out of control eight man tag team match I hjave ever seen. The beginnings of the match happens all in the crowd where all eight men fight each other. The action in the ring aint bad either. All eight men has a good showing here and this was an outstanding eight man tag team match. 5/5

LockDown 2006
Lethal Lockdown
W/ America's Most Wanted & Scott Steiner Vs. Sting, AJ Styles, Ron Killings, & Rhino
This was good Lethal Lockdown match. There were some good spots but the true highlight of this match is when Styles splashes Storm through the table on top of the cage, and that was for sure a pheonomenal moment in the match & in TNA history. The match kind of dragged on in the beginning but it really picked up when Sting entered the match. Pretty good lethal lockdown. 4.5/5

Sacrifice 2006
W/ Scott Steiner Vs. Sting & Samoa Joe
This was a good rare tag team match among these four men. The story to this match was could Joe and Sting trust each other. Sting and Joe actually wrestling a good looking tag team bout. Joe and Sting both put on a good showing and along with Jarrett and Steiner they displayed a great tag bout. The ending was with Joe leaving Sting while getting beat up by Jarrett and Steiner. 4.5/5

Disc 4
Jarrett discusses on this disc how he was able to keep TNA running to where it is at today with certain individuals from TNA roster giving props to Jarrett for that. Jarrett discusses his future plans involving his relationship in TNA Wrestling. Also TNA's variations such as the six sided ring along with matches including King of the Mountain and Ultimate X. Jarrett then explains what he want TNA to obtain in the years ahead along with Jarrett detailing some of his favorite moments in TNA.

Slammiversary 2006
King of the Mountain Ladder Match for the NWA Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Christian Cage vs. Sting vs. Abyss vs. Ron Killings
This was another good KOTM match up. You see a couple of new spots that you didn't see from the first KOTM match including Sting pulling off a high risk move which you hardly see from Sting and Abyss falling through 4 tables stacked onto each other. The ending is with referee Earl Hebner living up to his reputation allowing Jeff Jarrett to win the match. A great match overall. 5/5

No Surrender 2006
Fans Revenge Strap Match
Vs. Samoa Joe
The stipulaion to this match was that there was 18 fans on the outside of the ring with leather straps ready to hit Jarrett whenever he was thrown to the outside. Of course the fans was pro-Samoa Joe all the way and on his side throughout the duration of the match. The match was good but it wasn't really one of my favorites from the set. After the match we see the announcement of Kurt Angle coming to TNA. 3.5/5

Bound For Glory 2006
NWA Heavyweight Championship with Kurt Angle as the Special Enforcer
Vs. Sting
This match had a 10 month build up to ever since Sting returned to wrestling back at Final Resolution. Sting looked in better shape than he ever was in. Sting and Jarrett had a good match inside the six sided ring with a good brawl on the outside. Angle did a decent job as the enforcer. This was a little bit of a disappointment being the main event but it was a good way to begin a new TNA era with Sting as the champion and Angle being a part of the TNA roster. 4.5/5

LockDown 2007
Lethal Lockdown
W/ Kurt Angle, Sting, Rhino, Samoa Joe Vs. Christian Cage, AJ Styles, Abyss, Tomko, & Scott Steiner
This was another great Lethal Lockdown match. Much more spots then you see from the 2006's Lethal Lockdown. Angle and Styles start the match and they progressed the match into a good pace. Once the weapons dropped down, things got better and more out of control. Sick spots to look out for are Rhino hitting the Gore to Tomko forcing Tomko to be pushed through the cage door, AJ being thrown off the top of the roof by Angle onto Steiner, Joe, Rhino, and Tomko on the ground, and Christian Cage being double chokeslammed onto thumb tacks. Hellacious match and a good one at that. 5/5

Bound For Glory 2008
Vs. Kurt Angle
With Jarrett being out for two years, he sure didn't look rusty. Jarrett performed very well with the true wrestling style of Angle. Angle was pulling off some moves he only uses for certain ppv's like his moonsault. The match went very good with some nice counters and the Enforcer rule was a good addition to the match. Also two nasty chair shots to Foley & Jarrett by Angle. A very good showing from both Angle & Jarrett. 4.75/5

Bonus matches include Jeff Jarrett's first TV appearence along with four other matches early in his career:
Vs. Tony Falk
Vs. Hector Guerrero
Vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler
W/ Bill Dundee Vs. Gary Young & Cactus Jack

Love him or hate him, you have to respect what the ""King Of The Mountain"" Jeff Jarrett has done with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. I recommend this set to any wrestling fanatic. A great life and career story on Jeff Jarrett and his ""Planet.""",1241740800,8,14792,4.633587786259542
3776283,4,B001RHV6NU,"Ive watched Jarrett wrestle since he had the stupid country singer gimmick back in the early 90's in WWF. I never regarded Jarrett as my favorite wrestler but do respect what he's done for the business. I'll admit I called him a Triple H wannabe but just look at the first disc and you'll understand why. He always had to be in the main event and holding the world title. This set is jam packed with plenty of matches and interviews over various topics. The first disc is bad because they looked like a second rate version of WCW and even though matches were going good, the ending always seemed to suck. The battle royal was edited but every superstar it showed was a basic jobber in WCW. I was excited to see the Scott Hall match but the ending to that match was bad beyond belief.  The Jim Duggan match on disc two was also something that could have been left on the cutting room floor but it did serve a purpose in the story line at the time. Despite these little gripes, it is an epic set. I'd recommend it to a TNA fan or any wrestling fan in general, since Jarrett has been in the business over twenty years.",1240963200,3,1115,4.259433962264151
3776284,5,B001RHV6NU,Jeff Jarrett King of the Mountain is an amazing for disc retrospective of the history of TNA. Whether you love him or hate him you have to respect what Double J has accomplished with TNA. Jarrett has given the fans an alternative to WWE.

Highly recommended.,1240963200,,455,4.493975903614458

8338031,5,B001RHV6NU,"This was an awesome TNA DVD release. This was done in a unique way. The documentary went in segments before each match which was good. This is very satisfying any wrestling given that we get almost all of Jarrett's greatest matches and best feuds. Jarrett really took TNA from being barely able to last on the weekly pay per views to having a twelve year run and counting. He helped carry the company with his awesome match. TNA was a great alternative for past mega stars of wrestling looking for a comeback or just making a brief run with the company. Scott Hall had a nice short run in the company. Curt Henning was there briefly. It was too bad there were no Henning Jarrett matches on the set but there was plenty other great matches.

  His matches with AJ Styles were always awesome and they are on this set. The greatest match in TNA History is on here. Raven vs Jarrett from April 30th 2003. Jarrett had a great match with Sting which one of my personal favorite feuds and angles in TNA. It was great because it was Sting's return to wrestling. I thought Jarrett helped Sting in the match and they put on a classic. Jarrett had an awesome match with Kevin Nash. Nash had lost weight and was taking this match very seriously. At Nash's age you didn't expect him to pull out such a great match but this was a brawl that went around the building and in the stands.

  Jarrett had some underrated matches with Ron Killings, Monty Brown and Rhino. I thought Ron had a good run with main event but was downgraded to midcard. I thought Rhino deserved more time as champion. Rhino had a good run in TNA. He put on some good matches but I felt he could have been used more. One of his best matches is definitely with Jarrett. I always loved Monty Brown. He should have got the strap. He put on a great match with Jarrett. Too bad Monty wasn't in TNA longer.

  Jarrett had one of the greatest matches of his career with Kurt Angle. Angle never has a bad match. Jarrett really hung in there with Angle step for step as Angle can wrestle circles around most wrestlers. Jarrett had a great ladder match with Jeff Hardy. Hardy and Jarrett always put on good matches. You get other matches on the set like Lethal lockdown, tag matches and even Jarrett having a special match with Samosa Joe.

  You also hear interviews from tons of TNA Wrestlers, Dixie Carter and other people. It's a fun dvd to watch to learn more about Jarrett and the History of TNA. The matches are awesome. Cheers!",1400371200,,2482,4.395196506550218

8338034,5,B001RHV6NU,"I really like when TNA attempts to do a biographical dvd because im always curious to see if they will try the WWE style. With the jeff j dvd they followed the format of talking to the wrestlers and then throw it to a match. Atleast the were going in order. All that being said, i believed they did a good job of telling his story and i loved the 4th disc with the good ol' USWA matches on there. Obviously they don't have any WWF footage of Jarrett but we wouldnt expect that now would we. Well done TNA.",1353801600,,505,4.06

8338036,4,B001RHV6NU,The documentary itself was pretty good. All of the matches were above-average for TNA matches with only the Gaunlet For The Gold cut short becuase Jarrett didn't make it to the end and his matches against Kurt Angle bring the best. No bad matches at all. The extras were solid and ok. I give this set a 8 out of 10.,1280793600,,315,4.180327868852459
