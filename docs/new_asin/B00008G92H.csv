7983775,3,B00008G92H,"This is a D movie at best, however, the best thing in it was an all girl black rock band called PMS that seriously jammed.  Wish I could see more of them in the flick.  The Harlem Shake is a recent dance but dancing in this film is strictly from the 70's.  Hard to watch, dance sequences were way too long and the people on the cover are NOT in the movie.",1153440000,,355,3.9027777777777777
