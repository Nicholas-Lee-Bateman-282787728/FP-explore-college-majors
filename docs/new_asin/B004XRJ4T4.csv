8447420,2,B004XRJ4T4,"This DVD is supposed to be sold as part of a kit...not for individual resale.  The website no longer exists. [...]
The DVDs arrived scratched and the case was cracked.  The labels look like a homemade job.
The audio quality is horrid.. especially Lesson 2.  The DVD constantly makes references to the member's kit.. and uses props from it... a belt, a balloon, a headband and a sponge.
It warns to you first read the student manual.  What manual??

As to the content, it looks like it was done on a shoestring budget.
The techniques used could result in injury to knees, ankles, and back. The instructor did not correct bad form, he simply says ""great job"" and continues with the video.
I can't comment on disk 2 as it is too badly scratched to play.

The first two reviews on this product are bogus.. They obviously are employees of the seller.. note the dates / other products these individuals have reviewed - from the same seller... coincidence?  I think not.",1327104000,,963,4.5964912280701755

he's loving it, the 6 year old was interested in it as well, not quite as long though
He did several lessons the first day
great Christmas gift, thanks

there may be a set offered that has a belt and workbook also, I'm curious as to what is in the workbook ...",1325462400,,413,4.012195121951219
