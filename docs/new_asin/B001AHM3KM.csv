3448063,5,B001AHM3KM,"I am so impressed with Lance Mackey. He is the real deal as far as big time mushers are concerned. His love for his human family, his dogs, Alaska and sled dog racing comes thru loud and clear in this video. If want to hear what a 4 time Yukon Quest and 2 time Iditarod champion has to say about life and sled dogs, this is the video for you. The only problem is the time goes too fast and I wanted to hear more. Highly recommended.",1212969600,7,432,3.9770114942528734

8277493,5,B001AHM3KM,"For many sled dog racing fans, a chance to sit down and converse with one of the top mushers ever would be a dream come true.  Not many of us have that opportunity. However, in the video, Appetite and Attitude, you can do just that. Heres Lance Mackey, one of the greatest dog drivers of all time and still the only musher ever to win the two big 1000 milers in the same year, not once but twice.  Hes talking just to you or at least it feels like that.
The producers of this masterful video capture him in a most human way as he expresses his strategy, his great love for the sport and even greater love for his dogs , many of which he raised himself. Lances philosophy and the special qualities that make him a champion and a genuine hero come through clearly as he talks in front of a Christmas tree. Its so real you can almost smell the evergreen spice and taste the coffee or cocoa you sip while you listen. This isn't the slick commercial TV clips, hitting just the sexy and superficial stuff. This is real, as honest and gets, right to the guts and glory of this wonderful sport. Appetite and Attitude is an essential addition to every race fans library.",1468195200,,1161,4.296803652968037

8277496,5,B001AHM3KM,"I really love the Iditarod Sled Dog race in Alaska. I like Lance Mackey and always have, ever since he started racing because he was the under dog and nobody believed he could win it. This story just gives an insite to his childhood, parents and how he got into training and breeding his dogs. Great story!",1368921600,,306,4.385964912280702
8277497,5,B001AHM3KM,"Lance is a keeper. You can see that his dogs know that. Mark and Helen Hegener (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Along-Alaskan-Trails-Adventures-in-Sled-Dog-History/dp/0984397736/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Along Alaskan Trails: Adventures in Sled Dog History</a>) of Northern light Studio did an excellent job of producing this intimate and engrossing interview. Emmy award winner Donna Quante (The Golden Girls, Outstanding technical direction/electronic camerawork/video control for a series, Cameraperson; Donna J. Quante 1986) provided some excellent footage and Lance provided 45 minutes of fireside chat from his Comeback Kennel. if you love Dog Racing, inspirational sports stories or ever expect to find yourself racing against Lance Mackey (or any Mackey!) you need to watch this video. It's Mark and Donna's voices you will hear other then Lance, and you can catch a glimpse of Helen and Donna with Lance at the Iditarod headquarters at the end.",1354838400,,992,6.301470588235294
8277498,5,B001AHM3KM,"I bought this for my Girlfriend for Christmas.  She loves sled dogs, and has a dogsled and two siberian huskies that she loves pulling the sled every winter with her on it.  And we both have become big fans of Lance Mackey.  The first DVD would freeze at the 18 min. mark, on her DVD player, and it did the same on my DVD player.  So i emailed Amazon the day after Christmas and explained the problem and that the DVD was purchased in November as a Christmas present, and they sent me a new DVD right out to me even without me sending the old one first. Didn't have to argue and send multiple emails with no response.  Amazon.com was quick and very nice and hassle free Amazon was GREAT!!! I received the new DVD in a couple of days and i sent the old DVD right back to them.  So i would recommend this DVD and Amazon.com to everyone, who wants a  great DVD and great service..",1353196800,2,877,4.153846153846154
8277499,5,B001AHM3KM,"""Appetite and Attitude:  A Conversation with Lance Mackey ""is perhaps as revealing about the past that brought him to this point as what drives him today.  Mackey's repeated refrain that his father Dick Mackey, who won the closest finish of the Iditarod ever, taking a win over Rick Swenson by one second, was viewed as something of a laughing stock amongst those involved in the sport when he started made me wonder given Mackey's claims of not getting the respect he deserves. One wonders if Mackey's drive to gain the respect of his peers today might be more closely associated with that perception than perhaps even Mackey realizes, but ""Appetite and Attitude"" is exactly what it claims to be, an informal chat with the Lance Mackey about his life and his dogs.  This is about as close as most fans can get to having a one-on-one with Lance Mackey.

There's an earnestness about Lance Mackey that makes you believe what he's saying whether he's talking about his own troubled youth, his battle with cancer or his love for his dogs. Those who know Mackey know that ""what you see is what you get"".  He's not just a talker who tells a great story, but he's honest and rarely holds back in conversation.  Mackey clearly loves what he's doing and it shows.

You'll certainly find plenty to ponder here as Mackey talks about how he rebuilt his life and built his team, but it's the dog talk that is most memorable.  Perhaps the stand-out moment of the entire conversation in my mind is his recounting of how Larry, who'd win the Iditarod's Golden Harness in 2007, seemed to know he'd done something special. Mackey is known to take a moment with his team before entering Nome and recounts stopping to tell them all how special they were and all they had done.  He's convinced Larry knew exactly what he was saying.  Mackey also talks about Larry sort of surveying the crowd at the Burled Arch and taking it all in as if he knew it was his due. As he talks, you can see the faint trace of a smile on Mackey's face as he remembers, too.

This is what ""Appetite and Attitude"" is about then, Lance Mackey's unrestrained comments on all aspects of his and how the love of dogs has taken him to where he is now.  ""I love what I'm doing"" is a comment you'll hear often from Mackey.  while much has happened in his life since this video was made, it still holds true.  ""Appetite and Attitude"" will take you inside his life, introduce you to his dogs and his drive to gain the respect of his peers, and, yes, leave you convinced that he does love what he's doing.  Pull up a chair and listen to what Lance Mackey has to say.",1231113600,8,2613,4.4600840336134455
8277500,5,B001AHM3KM,Since his back-to-back wins in the Yukon Quest & Iditarod (beginning in 2007) it's been hard to catch a few minutes with Lance to just hear what the man has on his mind.  This is that opportunity!  Don't wait!  Own this DVD cuz' I'm not loaning mine out!,1214611200,9,254,4.25
8277501,4,B001AHM3KM,"Let me be upfront and straight forward, I'm a huge Lance Mackey fan.  When I got my copy in the mail I couldn't get it opened and into the DVD player fast enough.  I watched it straight through, then microwaved some dinner and watched it again.

For die hard Lance fans, like myself, its mesmerizing.  Its like having a long, fireside conversation with him.  Its almost like being there in person.  Prehaps its even better, because there are no distractions.  He is amazingly candid and open.  He offers up insights about the sport that few of us would imagine.  He tells us a lot about his own thinking and how he processes observations of dog and musher behaviors.

He gives us the history of mushing in his family, his dad's early endeavors with dogs and how he built his teams.  Lance talks about how he and Tonya started their lives together on a beach in the Kenai Peninsula and how the dogs returned to his life.  He talks about his battle with cancer and the long term effects of the treatment.  This video allows us unprecedented access into Lance's life, intimate, hilarious, heartfelt, determined, and truely dogged.

This is not a critical review.  This is South-Paw Sarida telling all those Lance Mackey fans out there to get this video as quickly as you can!

Thank you Donna, Helen, Teresa and everyone involved in the production of this work.  I will be living in anticipation until part 2.  I hope in the next video we will get to see more of the dogs and watch that Mackey Magic with them.
