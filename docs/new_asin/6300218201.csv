7806461,5,6300218201,"Fantastic movie - riveting to the very end. Why it is not available on a DVD is beyond me. HELLO Netflix?
I find most all movies made in Australia to be a cut above and this one is my favorite.
Worth dusting off the old VCR to see it again.",1282521600,4,240,3.82
7806462,4,6300218201,"This was a made-for-Australia TV movie made back in the mid-'80s, a film that runs just over three hours. I liked it and found very few lulls in it, although, it could have been trimmed down a bit. I'm sorry I traded in my tape years ago because I'd like to watch it again.

What I remember most about this film, and I am writing this over 10 years after last seeing it, is the driving beat of the music. It's very repetitive but it works and adds suspense to the story. I remember the miles of desolate country in which much of the long adventure tale takes place. It painted an interesting picture of the big desert area, the Outback.

John Waters was excellent as the lead in the film, playing the villain of the story. You keep guessing how is this guy going to get it in the end. It's good suspense and a film I gather not many of us in North America know about. Maybe we'll get lucky and someone will produce a DVD of this.",1247011200,5,929,4.155555555555556
7806463,4,6300218201,"Alice to Nowhere was a 'ripping yarn' novel from Evan Green. Sold to Crawfords, who produced it as a two part miniseries, so most of the detail of the book has been kept in the movie. This is not a sparse production. The movie is true to the book, except the main character has had a name change from Fred Crawford to Dave Mitchell - Hmmm. Strong performances, particularly by John Waters as Johnny.

The Birdsville track today is a track in name only, but should you plan to visit the 'Never Never'  country, this movie would be a good introduction to the landscapes out there.

The original Birdsville mailmen picture, ""Back of Beyond"", was most likely the inspiration for Evan's story. This is available again on DVD and well worth a look.",1122854400,4,742,4.56390977443609
7806464,5,6300218201,"I've read several short synopsie (is that plural for synopsis?) on the movie so I know that when the reviewer says the movie is about a young nurse, lost in the outback, I know they didn't watch the movie.  The only people lost were the bad guys and only temporarily.  I've watched a lot of movies, old and new, and this is one of the very best I've ever seen.  You've got the strangeness of the Australian outback, the modest beauty of the nurse, Babara Dean, the big strong silent type in the trucker/mailman, Dave Mitchell, the thieves turned murderers, Johnny and Frog,  and the humorous side-kick of Dave, Trotsky, an ex-prisoner of the infamous Russian Gulag.  Put all these along with an opal necklace, meant for the young queen Elizabeth, into the heart of the Australian outback and see who survives the horror of murders, relentless heat, endless desert and fear of what lies at the end of the Birdwell Track.  As one of the victims says, just before Johnny executes her, ""Some men don't last out here"", it will be well worth your three and a half hours to see evil pitted against the Australian outback.",1058918400,8,1114,4.601010101010101
