5281,5,0767019245,"For persons who are interested in looking into the ways in which ancient Rome went to war, this is a must-buy video.  It is one of the more well-done documentaries that I have seen and does an excellent job of laying out the battle tactics, territory, major personages and instruments of Roman warfare up until about the time of the Antonine rulers.
What makes this documentary particularly special is its usage of authentic and re-created signs of Roman hegemony.  For example, we have the opportunity to view a  nearly full-scale mock up of a Roman fort in a forest located in Germany.  We also see the palisades where Vercingetorix made his last stand in what is modern day France.
On top of this, we are invited to archeological excavations in & around Hadrian's Wall which was built to demark the line between Great Britain and Scotland (Caledonia).  The scholars there disinter the coinage of Rome thru the ages, as well as ancient letters of soldiers, medical instruments and much more.  Fascinating stuff!
For a grand overview of the expanse of the Roman empire, this would be a terrific video-set to buy.  However, precious little is shown or alluded to Rome itself.  For those who are only interested in the history & politics inside Rome, other documentaries would be much more appropriate.  If, on the other hand, you want to know more about the Legions on the frontiers of Roman territories, the present videos would be a superb choice.",1043539200,5,1449,4.810483870967742

Well, I'm not sure if this is just some sort of weird Internet joke they're pulling on us or what, but the movie is horrific.

There aren't any good fight scenes in this, first of all.  You can tell that people are pulling their punches because of how poor the action is.  The editing makes the combat even worse, showing you that the choreography just didn't flow.  And, finally, it's just extremely boring.

The gunplay is also, just like the fighting, blatantly fake.  There are better video edits on gun flare and people 'pretending' to fire the guns on YouTube than here.  Heck there are pretty much better short films on YouTube made by college students on YouTube.

The movie also isn't stocked full of really good looking people.

The story is bad.  Horrible even.

The quality of the film itself is bad.  Grainy, almost non-HD film, definitely not with a quality camera made for filming outdoors or in action scenes.  Even poorer considering how much it makes your realize that there is a lot of post-editing done.

Don't waste your money, don't fall into the Internet joke of the (as of this writing) 3 5-star reviews.  This movie is bad, it's not worth $1.99 rental, don't even think about buying it, just close your browser window.  Now!",1336003200,,1430,4.58498023715415
7788715,3,0767019245,"Because it's totally got lots of the cast, and more importantly, it's better than that big budget version.

Toy/Cartoon accurate (unlike that film, too), and it's got some interesting scenes. Still, don't expect anything over a B-grade film, but for what it is, it's amazing.

It's a very, very corny movie (""Duke"" sounds like Ahnold), and everyone has pretty terrible accents, but if you are a fan of the 80s franchise, the fights are pretty cool (the music is however not). The DVD has a sorta prequel film with ""Snake Eyes"" fighting ""Storm Shadow"". The ""Joes"" pretty much have to bust up a sex ring and it has ""Cobra Commander"" (here, the organization is just.. Serpent or something, but his uniform is 100% toy accurate). I like that ""Snake Eyes"" can talk, but it hurts him lots, which was sorta established in the Hama run on the original comics. You also get ""Scarlet"", ""Firefly"", ""Beach Head"" and tons of martial arts scenes. I really do not like the music AT ALL, and it's a very B-film, but if you are a legit Joe fan, the adult ten year old in you will probably kinda dig this film. It's got some T&A in it as well, like when ""Baroness"" interrogates ""Duke"".

It's pretty corny fun, hah.",1310947200,,1196,4.553488372093023
7788716,5,0767019245,"Now this is a great martial art film with some really great fight scenes. I really enjoyed this film from beginning to end. You can even watch this film with the volume off and enjoy the eye candy with all the hot looking actors. It's great either way. It's definatley better than any lame Chuck Norris film ever made. This movie is as fun as ""The one armed boxer/""Flying gulliatine"" type films.",1294876800,,395,4.5
7788717,1,0767019245,High school kids make better films!!!!  $0.10 is too much for this title!  To say it is a ripoff is to be too kind!! To give this film even one star is to insult all other one star films!,1293235200,,187,3.769230769230769
7788718,1,0767019245,"I rented this movie based on its single review. What a mistake! The photography looks like it was done using 8 or 16mm film. The action is jerky is places, the color badly balanced and the focus is not very sharp. The dialogue is stilted and the main actor sounds like a young Arnold Schwarzenegger. I don't know if that is intentional or not.

This movie was a waste of an hour and a half of my time. Not recommended.",1288569600,,418,4.225
7788719,5,0767019245,"Holy crap!!  Great action, HOT women and kick a** music!!!!  What is there not to like?  Being a stunt fighter and choreographer, I really enjoyed the fight scenes.  Reminded me of the early 80's action films that I use to watch as a teenager.  As a director, I liked the different shot angles that worked well.  Get a mosh pit started and rock out to the soundtrack.  Did i mention the hot women?!",1276214400,2,398,4.36986301369863
7788720,5,0767019245,"A fine documentary. Nothing wrong with the re-enactment provided by the Ermine Street Guard. Although not looking Mediterranean enough let us not forget that the Roman army had people from all the corners of the Empire in it's ranks. This is not a movie so it can not be compared with one like Gladiator when it comes to re-enactment, even though Gladiator was a bit historically inacurate, at least the documentary was not.

Overall the documentary delivered what it was meant to deliver: How important the Roman army was to Rome as defenders, conquerors and nation builders also how brutal this well disciplined machine was.

Definitely 5 stars for this one.",1146614400,,660,4.936936936936937
7788721,3,0767019245,"Although the historical material on the History Channel Roman War Machine are very informative, I have to agree with an earlier review that the reinactors look phony. I think the producers of this program should watch the opening scenes of The Gladiator and the battle in Germania, now these guys really look like troops that have been in the field for many weeks. Dirty, tough, and the muddy battlefield in the middle of a German forest - as close to the real thing we could imagine.",1114387200,,484,4.6395348837209305
7788722,5,0767019245,"Recedite, plebes! Gero rem imperialem!
 Just a short but to the point opinion on the documentary.
1. The re-enactors are fine, it adds a little drama to an historic period.
2. All subjects done very well, being a Roman History buff myself I liked seeing the Saalburg and surrounding areas in Germany(that I have been to many times)in the movie.
3. Only one complaint I have is the History Channel only has this title on VHS tapes, in the era of DVD I think they should bring something like this on DVD especially for the price tag.
 Another excellent documentary to watch on this subject is ""Rome power and Glory"" (DVD and VHS)",1082505600,3,627,4.539823008849558
