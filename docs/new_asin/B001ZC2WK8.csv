3830294,5,B001ZC2WK8,"This is a great series.  I have watched season 1-4 and would have purchased all the rest by this date if they had been on American DVDs.  Now I will have to purchase a multi-region DVD player.  Since the British have so many shows I would love to see, but can't, because of this I will get a multi-region DVD just so I can keep up with what the British have to offer.  Waking the Dead is a first rate show.  If you like CSI and shows like it I believe you will find this much more enjoyable.  Great cast and plots.",1268438400,3,514,3.9901960784313726
3830295,5,B001ZC2WK8,This is one of the best shows from England or anywhere else. I also bought this from the United Kingdom as well as series 5 and 6. I think there are two more seasons that have not come out on DVD even in the UK. I can hardly stand it to know they were made and yet are not available for purchase.,1264636800,6,296,3.7903225806451615
3830296,5,B001ZC2WK8,"As my title indicates, I gave up on waiting for this to come out in the US and ordered the series from the UK a year or so ago. I have a multi-region player, so it was a no-brainer. Waking the Dead is probably one of my favorite crime dramas of all time and this final season with all of the original cast is really stellar. Series 4, originally broadcast in the summer of 2004,  consists of 6 two-part episodes (really 12) and there isn't a dud among them. ""In the Sight of the Lord"" involves the investigation of the unsolved murder of a WWII conscientious objector. The motive behind this murder is a rather gut-wrenching crime. ""False Flag"" involves the team investigating the unsolved murder of an Irish terrorist missing since 1981. A bit tedious at times but still quite good and better than almost anything out there. In ""Fugue States"" the team is handed the case of a set of twins missing for 13 years until one of them shows up in an ER after a car accident. The side story here really starts to develop the character of Mel Silver as she searches for her biological mother. The two parter ""Anger Management"" has the team investigating a suicide at a half-way house with the kicker involving the weapon used. The side story here is a lot of fun as the perennially angry Boyd is forced to take anger management counselling, the effects of which his team find disturbing. In ""The Hardest Word"" the team is called in when two males are found with the word ""sorry"" carved into their backs. There is an organized crime tie-in so another team is brought in to help solve the case, creating tension and providing a female of interest for Boyd. The final set ""Shadowplay"" is really wonderfully done but has a truly heart-wrenching ending. The series was never quite the same after, although still good. This final season with all members of the original cast is extra special, maybe because it is the last, but most probably because the stories told are just that good.

I wish it didn't take so long to get these released over here. If you have a multi-region player, you can get series 4 from Amazon UK for 10.98 which is roughly about $19.00. I have never been charged over $5 or $6 to ship things here and if you get a few other dvds, it might be worth it to order from Amazon UK--the conversion rate is quite good right now. Series 5 and 6 have been available since 2007/2008 in the UK. I also recommend the British series Silent Witness. Fans of WTD will probably enjoy it too.",1256774400,29,2485,4.4593406593406595

3830304,3,B001ZC2WK8,"Reviews are all subject to personal preference!!! I began watching British TV several years ago because most of America's TV lacks any substance. Throw in tons of sex and violence, mix it with loud music & occasional explosions and we can forget about a competent storyline. For me this particular season had some decent writing, while some of the shows were completely ridiculous. About a fifty-fifty split, hence the 3 star rating!!!",1433808000,,435,5.055555555555555

savor every minute!!!!!!",1410307200,,77,4.5
3830310,3,B001ZC2WK8,"The focus of this series is a fictional cold case squad of (presumably) the London Metropolitan Police. The operative word here is ""fictional,"" as almost nothing rings true. If you've watched documentaries focusing on cold case investigations, you will know how detectives approach cold cases: review the case files, which often are extensive, looking for things that may have been missed; re-interview witnesses, when possible; leverage advances in forensic science to reexamine physical evidence. Not surprisingly, the individuals assigned to conduct cold case investigations typically are experienced detectives with reputations for doggedness. That's not quite the way it is in this series.

The head of the squad is Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd, played by Trevor Eve, an actor who has never met the scenery he was afraid to chew. The writers play to his strength and provide him with ample opportunity to exercise his fearlessness. But Boyd does project the experience and doggedness required to head a cold case squad. Two other police officers are part of the squad: DS Amelia ""Mel"" Silver (Claire Goose) and DI Spencer Gordon (Wil Johnson). It was never clear to me what Mel brought to the table in this team. And of the two, only Johnson projected the assertiveness and authority to convince me his character was a police officer. Had the writers kept the squad to these three characters, the squad might have been plausible, but they don't - and how!

Given the importance of advances in forensic testing in solving cold cases, it makes sense that cold case detectives have access to support from forensic scientists. But it does not make sense that cold cases should have priority over ""hot"" cases for such support. And it makes no sense at all that an asset as valuable as a forensic pathologist should be dedicated to a cold case squad. But that's what the writers give us.

The forensic pathologist is Dr. Frankie Wharton, played by Holly Aird. Frankie, as she is called by one and all, is in her early thirties; about the age of most forensic pathologists when they are just completing their training. But not only is Frankie a pathologist wise beyond her years, it seems there is no expertise she does not possess, and in various episodes we see her strut her stuff as an electronics expert, a cryptographer, ballistics expert, a document analyst, fingerprint expert, computer whiz, and a botanist. Oh, and let's not forget the time she crawled under a car to defuse a bomb. In fact, much of the time Frankie functions as a forensic crime scene analyst, a role that, in the absence of a body (which few cold case teams encounter, except, of course, here), does not require a pathologist. Having a pathologist assigned to this squad is a ridiculous waste of a valuable asset. Frankie, by the way, disappears after four seasons and is replaced in season five by another forensic pathologist, Dr. Felix Gibson. Don't let the name Felix throw you: like Frankie, Felix is female (played by Esther Hall), and she, too, will be known to one and all by just her first name. What I found bizarre is how similar Frankie and Felix are in general appearance, mannerisms, and behavior. Apparently, the writers did everything they could to clone Frankie. Felix lasts one season; replaced in season six by Dr. Eve Lockhart (what is it with Boyd and female pathologists?) played by Tara Fitzgerald, whom no one would mistake for Frankie or Felix.

Dedicating a criminal profiler to a cold case squad is only slightly less ridiculous than dedicating the services of a forensic pathologist, but, hey, in for a penny, in for a pound. The profiler is Dr. Grace Foley (Sue Johnston). I liked the character of Grace, whom I viewed as the squad's token adult.

There are other aspects I found ridiculous. Take the fact writers seem not to understand the meaning of ""cold case."" In one episode, a body is uncovered at a building site, and the case is deemed a cold case and given to Boyd's team because body is mummified!

But, seriously, you say, what's a little dramatic license among friends? Point taken, hence three stars instead of two.",1406332800,,4141,4.883357041251778

Season 9 was the final season which arrived from you the day after it was released.  These will be watched many times as each time you see them you get more out of them and see little things you missed before.  I am very sorry that Trevor Eve did not want to come back, but I think he was wise to finish on such a high note with the last 2 episodes.  Other Trevor Eve series to watch are ""kidnap and ransom"" and ""the heat of the sun"". Both excellent.",1401062400,2,570,4.099099099099099

3830315,5,B001ZC2WK8,I received the DVD more quickly than expected and they met all my expectations. We enjoyed the stories and have really gotten to know more about the characters in the story.,1381795200,,173,4.612903225806452
3830316,5,B001ZC2WK8,"If you like gritty British police procedurals, this series is stellar.  The plots seem quite original - probably because each show is in two parts so there is ample time to develop complexity and back story.  Boyd, the team leader for the cold cases, is showing development as a character and mellowing nicely. He is fairly magnetic as a character, a bit imperious, but warm and occasionally vulnerable. The ensemble works well together and by now you really know each team member - their strengths and peculiarities.

Love to watch these while on the treadmill as the pacing is good and the plot has some intensity to make the time go by quickly.  Each show is quite distinct from the others and the endings are usually not predictable. I think the series just continues to get better and deepen.  Great job by the writers, actors and producers.",1371427200,,846,4.727891156462585

All are worth watching more than once.  The only thing I did not like was the loss of a well like team member.",1363824000,,252,3.8823529411764706
3830319,5,B001ZC2WK8,Season 4 was fantastic. This is CSI without the bells and whistles and was one of the most shocking seasons to date. All done by BBC America. You keep on wanting more.,1350691200,,167,4.25
3830320,5,B001ZC2WK8,"""Waking the Dead Season 4""is a superb entry in the acclaimed British mystery television series that ran from 2000-2007, when, sadly, it was axed by the BBC in favor of `newer, more innovative crime dramas.' It played for some time on BBCAmerica on my side of the pond, where I made its acquaintance. It is strongly -cast and -written ---by Barbara Machin, a woman, yay! It's a police procedural/crime drama that follows Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd and his cold-case unit, consisting of scientists and a psychologist, as well as detectives, at the London Metropolitan Police. The squad utilizes the latest advances in forensic science, psychological profiling of the unknown criminal perpetrators and other modern investigative techniques to crack unsolved murders.

Upon even initial viewing, its differences from similar-sounding American TV series are great. The cop shop is anything but new and shiny, and poorly lit compared to American series that all seem to have been filmed on a sunny Southern California set. The actors aren't new and shiny, either. Trevor Eve, (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat-of-the-Sun-Boxed-Set-Private-Lives-Hide-in-Plain-Sight-The-Sport-of-Kings/dp/B0001WTUK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat of the Sun Boxed Set (Private Lives / Hide in Plain Sight / The Sport of Kings)</a>) who plays Boyd, began his career as beefcake. But he's older now, and showing how thoughtfully he's aged. Still very watchable. He's backed, in the cop shop, by Sue Johnston as Dr. Grace Foley; Wil Johnson, as DI Spencer Jordan; Holly Aird as Dr. Frankie Wharton; and Claire Goose, as DS Amelia (Mel) Silver. All of them very good actors, and not one of them a beautiful young blond. The production also uses a number of excellent older British actors; in this series, notably older Celtic actors. It is violent, intense and suspenseful; plots are intricate and complex: there's always something going on. The episodes are:

Disc 1. ""In Sight of the Lord,"" Parts 1 and 2. World War II misdeeds of a squad of out of control soldiers are punished unto the present day. Features Michael Byrne.

""False Flag,"" Parts 1 and 2. A 20-year old case centering on a young Anglo-Irish terrorist. Or was he? Features Timothy West and Frances de la Tour.

Disc 2. ""Fugue States,"" Parts 1 and 2. Centers on adoption issues. Cindy and Jason Murphy were abducted as five-year olds and never found. What's become of them? Features Sean McGinley.

""Anger Management,"" Parts 1 and 2. Boyd is ordered into psychotherapy for his anger management problems. The squad investigates a purported suicide. Features T.P. McKenna.

Disc 3. ""The Hardest Word,"" Parts 1 and 2. A look back at child abuse, and a killer who carves ""Sorry,"" into the backs of his victims while they are still alive. Features Julian Glover and Phyllida Law.

""Shadow Play,"" Parts 1 and 2. A mysterious ""shepherd"" is pushing unstable, religiously-oriented young women into murder. Reaches a conclusion that shocks the cop shop, and will shock viewers as well.

Solid and workmanlike this series surely is, but it's much more than that; under Machin's executive producership, it is the product of topnotch writers and directors, and makes for intense, riveting viewing. Whatever was the BBC thinking?",1350259200,,3311,5.366088631984586
3830321,5,B001ZC2WK8,"Waking the dead is a British cold case type TV series that quite frankly can leave you breathless by the complex plots and excellent acting. On this set the episode of ""Fugue States"" leaves you wondering how on earth do they come up with such rich and powerful plots, together with the usual twists and turns.
I have all 9 series and being a Brit, ordered some of the ones not available in the US by buying via the UK website. I just have to play them on my region-free DVD player. No problems.
No regrets, fantastic series as always, wish there were more but I'll be looking at buying other British series of this type",1330387200,,619,4.344827586206897
3830322,5,B001ZC2WK8,"After viewing Season four (4) of this British Cold Case detective/mystery series, all that I have to say is WOW!  ""Waking the Dead"" Season four (4) is really Television Entertainment at its very, very best.  I just loved this season.

The episodes (6 in 2 parts on 3 discs with each part running over an hour) of Season four (4) of this series are so really great.  The acting, the writing and the direction of each episode are all simply superb.  I really don't know when I've been so well entertained.  Each episode was so good that it left me in awe.

Be advised that the episodes in Season Four are intense with no obvious solutions to the mysteries. Yes, there is a tragedy to the Cold Case Unit that will affect the future operations (a ""cliff hanger"" perhaps?).  As I have stated before, this series does not ""spoon feed"" the viewing public clues.  Believe me, one is always trying to determine the outcome until ""all is revealed"".",1288915200,7,938,4.535714285714286
3830323,5,B001ZC2WK8,"This season of the four available so far on dvd in the u.s. is by far the best.
And that's saying alot for this series which is the best cold case show ever.  The acting is on a superior level and Trevor Eve carries the show as a intense justice driven detective in charge of forgotten cases.  And he's backed up by a excellent cast that really put out first rate performances. The dead on this show really look like real dead people often too and the stories are extremely engaging. I would say it's one of my favorite british crime shows ever and that's saying alot.  The main problem is that the bbc is way behind on releasing these to our region.  This is series four from 2004 and they have already shot 8 seasons and will have another one in 2011 making it season 9 with perhaps even more in store.

It does come with a surprising twist at the end of the season, but it won't stop you from wanting to see season 5.

The actors have firmly settled into their roles in this season and there are lots of personality issues explored.  But, this never gets in the way of the police detective cold case unit focus of the stories.  It's a crime story not a soap, and I appreciate that.

The great thing about BBC shows, particularly mysteries, is they take their time telling the story with excellent and compelling narrative and it's not rushed. In the episode I saw, the end was a huge surprise that I never saw coming.
