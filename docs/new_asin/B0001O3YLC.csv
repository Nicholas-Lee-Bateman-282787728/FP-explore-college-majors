It`s not funny 4me.
Is too old the movie.
Is sufficient with all i said.
I don`t wanna say more.",1370044800,,119,4.0
8310521,3,B0001O3YLC,"Not among Spanish cult director Alex de la Iglesia's best movies, this tells the tale, through almost two decades, of two TV comedians who are a very famous and succesful duo (though their act is nothing else than one of the guys slapping the face of the other guy) but who grew to hate (and really hate) each other to death. The duo is played by Santiago Segura and El Gran Wyoming, two famous comedians in Spain. Segura, the fat guy in the duo and the one who gets slapped, is famous there for the Torrente films, in which he plays an hilariously corrupt cop. This movie is only mildly funny, and I'm not sure it would travel well outside spanish speaking countries.",1199145600,,668,4.439024390243903
