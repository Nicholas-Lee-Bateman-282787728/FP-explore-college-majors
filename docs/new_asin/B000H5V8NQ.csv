2627836,5,B000H5V8NQ,"It should be noted (though most people that have been keeping track of hellsing probably already know this) that the new OVA was created with the intention of being more faithful to the original manga.  Since the orignial TV series also did this for part of the series (and the veered off in a totally different direction) it is pretty much inevitable that the beginning plot will be very similiar to that of the TV series.

The difference here is that it looks a inifinitely better than the original TV series in nigh on every way imaginable; not to mention that it is noticeably more faithful to the mangaka's style.  Without going into much detail, in here you're going to find everything you want out of an action (well the word violent suits it so much better) anime.  Hellsing fans are sure to be satisfied, and anyone else looking for good (albeit violent) watch should definitely consider picking this up.  Keep in mind that there is more on the way; this OVA series seems to look like it will only get better.",1165449600,2,1018,4.571428571428571
2627837,4,B000H5V8NQ,"Finally, we in the United States get a taste of the Hellsing OVA, and believe me it was worth the wait.  But I've got good news and bad news for fans of the television series.  The good news is that this OVA freakin' rocks!  It takes everything great about the old series and amps it to up to levels of cool previously thought unreachable.  The art is unbelievable, the integrations of CG is fluid, and the number of amazing freeze-frame worthy shots is too high to count.  The bad news is that the story is little more than a severely shortened retelling of the events of the older series.  This means much less time spent on characters like Seres Victoria (a police-girl who becomes a vampire and joins the Hellsing organization) and uber-cool Hellsing director Integra; but it also means more hardcore action featuring that god of all vampire anti-heroes the ""No Life King"" himself, Alucard.  In the end it's a more than even trade and both series should absolutely be viewed by fans of vampires, anime, or anyone who wants to see some seriously cool action.  The story moves along at a dizzying pace, almost as though the director knew we'd already seen this all before and was in a rush to get to the awesome fight sequences, which are actually an improvement over the already classic confrontations that many of us have watched over and over.  If anything, deranged priest Father Anderson has only gotten more insane and awesome; his battle with Alucard that kickstarts the protestant Hellsing's war with the rival catholic Iscariot Organization is, as expected, the highlight of this installment.  One of my biggest complaints about the older series (which, in hindsight, I reviewed a bit too harshly) was that Miss Victoria, for the amount of screen time that was spent on her, never really developed any behavior that would identify her as a vampire rather than just another cute, innocent anime heroine.  Well, my wish has been granted this time out as Alucard's little police girl goes full-on berserk in a scene that is as memorable as it is cool.  This disc is an absolute must for anyone who loves Hellsing, wants to see Hellsing, or even has any interest in horror, action, or twisted-yet-heroic vampire awesomeness.  The only reason this doesn't get a perfect rating is the fact that the story is almost entirely recycled and that the DVD is so painfully short.  In conclusion: if you're new to Hellsing, check this out and if you like what you see and want more, I'd highly recommend checking out the original anime series as the wait for the rest of these OVA's will be excrutiating at best.  If you're a Hellsing veteran, you've probably already bought this and you shouldn't be disappointed with what you see; that is, unless you were hoping for another series focusing on a loveable, timid Seres Victoria.  Then you're just SOL.... and also lame.  Any true fan knows it's all about Alucard anyway, right?  Savor every gorgeous animated second; I know I did.",1164067200,25,2978,4.760700389105058

2627841,4,B000H5V8NQ,I enjoy the Hellsing Vol 1. I have seen Vol 1 -7 online. I wish to add these movies to my collection. But i have to say $18 for a chapter that is only a hour long is too much. should be priced around $11- $15 for New. The company i bought it from was great. Companies name started with a H and is loctacted in Texas I live in California it got here in 4 days in perfect condition. I will by agian.,1288224000,,397,3.738095238095238
2627842,5,B000H5V8NQ,I'm excited that they are re-doing the Hellsing Series. The last one ended abruptly without really having a conclusive ending. The animation is cleaner and the story is more fluid.,1284768000,,180,5.033333333333333
2627843,5,B000H5V8NQ,"I was disappointed with the Hellsing anime but the ova kicks many levels of a**! I loved it! The animation and coloring is way better than the animes cheep look. The blood and gore is stepped up! Its funnier and more action packed. Chrispin freeman makes Alucard sound as sexy as ever (seriously everytime he opens his mouth I melt), and Seras has a bigger role. Hellsing is one of those animes whos English dub is far more superior to its Japenese dub. I admit though Alucards Japenese and German voice also had me melting. For one in the english dub the voices make far more sense because this takes place in European countries, so the British and other European accents are very appropriate. MY favorite characters have to be Alexander, Jin, Rip Van Winkle, Seras, Alucard, and Scrodinger. I also can't forget za maja(the major). He has to be one of my favorite villians ever. Sadly I didn't yet get to see the last episodes in English because thier weren't released at the time and youtube still hasn't put them up. The ova also give the characters more depth and personallity. Seras is definately a huge improovement over her anime counterpart. If anyone knows if Funimation dubed the last couple of episodes, comment please. IF you want to watch an awesome, original, kick*** anime with actual/true vampires pretend the anime doesn't exist and watch Hellsing ultimate ova.

2627845,3,B000H5V8NQ,"To be honest for one episode, this is really overpriced. If your a huge Hellsing fan grab it, but just be aware they aren't making anymore after 5. So your kindve stuck going back to the manga afterwards for a semi half ending. Just my two cents.",1259107200,,246,4.25531914893617

2627847,5,B000H5V8NQ,"I have to say that when I watched the original hellsings I thought that as a series it left you hanging and some of the episodes seemed drawn out. I am not saying that in any way was it less than spectacular, but I just felt like there could have been more. And that is exactly what the Ultimates are. Every last one of them is the original series plus some. I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone. It is a dark trip through a world already explored.",1250640000,,464,4.166666666666667

2627849,5,B000H5V8NQ,"I came to know the series from AMVs on youtube.
I then saw the series and wasn't that impressed, ending episode was lame but the overall plot of a KICK@$$ vampire, whos strangely attractive ^_~ was interesting enough to keep my attention.
I then saw the first Ultimate and was pretty impressed with the overall animation and better story line. Infact the whole ultimates are pretty good. My favorite is the forth.
I'd buy it but if you fear sinking money into it, you can always check them out on youtube, before they're delete them, watch them and then decide weither to buy them or not.
Unfortuneately, I did see the 5th Ultimate and I was not totally let down. The fifth did have nice animation but the few minutes of the beginning of the movie was kinda pointless to me. Then again, If I was alucard, I would of done the same thing to that annoying spirit of his gun named jeckal-willis. I wasn't let down totally of the 5th but Im waiting for the 6th.

2627850,5,B000H5V8NQ,"The Good Things
*Excellent video/sound quality.
*This version of ""Hellsing"" has excellent imagery and graphics.  It includes a lot of computer-generated-imagery, but none of it looks too hoaky or out-of-place.  It is definately high quality animation.
*Excellent amount of bloody action.  It is so fast and furious that it puts the old ""Hellsing"" show to shame.  Also contains more comedy than before.
*Storyline is great.  It is very very close to the original manga.
*Characters are splendid.  Alucard is as psychotic as ever.  Integra Hellsing is just as cold and vengeful as before, but not as mean.  Saris Victoria is not as stiff, and is actually more clumsy and goofy; I think she is more fun to watch in this version.  All other characters are lively, interesting, and great to watch.
*Some good lines throughout.
*Funky music (although I think the music in the old ""Hellsing"" show was better).

The Bad Things
*Not for the squeamish; contains lots of bloody violence, swearing, and suggestive material (rated TV-MA).
*A lot of stuff is packed into a single hour.  As fast and condensed as everything is, it may be seen as overly compressed with not enough exposition.

The Other Things
*If you buy the single-disc version, you get little or no special features.  The two-disc steelbook edition (although more expensive) includes a small wealth of interviews and textless credit scenes.

I thought a vampire action saga couldn't get any better than ""Hellsing""...until ""Hellsing Ultimate"" came out and blew it right out of the water.  The ""Ultimate"" series has better animation quality, more action, livlier characters, more comedy, and above all, is much closer to the source material.  It zips by pretty fast, but is wildly entertaining and never dull.  Highly reccomended to anybody who enjoys anime or anything involving vampires.",1224547200,17,1841,5.124161073825503

2627852,5,B000H5V8NQ,"Hellsing fans, of either the manga or TV series, can expect only the highest of quality with the series in any incarnation it takes, and Ultimate doesn't let its viewers down. The first episode covers the first manga volume (Vampire Hunter, Master of Monster, Murder Club, and Sword Dancer) to a lesser or greater extent, and does it captivatingly with excellent animation and voice acting, and competent music, though notably inferior to the TV series. Extras include a commentary and interview with Crispin Freeman, Alucard's voice actor.",1217635200,,540,5.218390804597701
2627853,3,B000H5V8NQ,"I had already watched the TV series and was developing withdrawal symptoms so was pleased when the Ultimate volumes came out but I have to say I feel it's just a rip off, the first two ultimate episodes are very much a re-run of what happened in the boxed set. It's only in the third volume that you get a real grip on the new story. The characters are more cartoonish and it doesn't have the dark edge I had come to expect from Hellsing. I hope the future volumes improve, I feel these have just been an expensive mistake.",1217548800,2,523,4.24
2627854,5,B000H5V8NQ,"If you have seen the regular Hellsing this Hellsing Vol. 1 OVA is the same storey as the regular Hellsing but told slightly different.  But the rest of the Hellsing Ultimate edition episodes are not, they are completely differend stories.  So if your a first time Hellsing watcher go ahead and watch it.  If your not then I would suggest skipping this disc.  Hellsing is deffinetely one of my all time favorite anime series.  I even got some of my friends that are completely against anime to watch it and they loved it.",1206921600,,520,4.548387096774194

2627856,5,B000H5V8NQ,"When I found out this DVD even existed, I had to go out and buy it.  It was everything I liked about the first series, but this time stayed closer to its magna roots.  I tried to watch other anime series and OVAs, but most of it is garbage compared to Hellsing.  If you're a fan of the magna, you should definitely pick this up.  If you like vampires, huge guns, and lots of action, you should pick this up.",1206489600,,407,4.05
2627857,3,B000H5V8NQ,"This OVA tries to follow the manga, but just ends up looking extremely cheesy. Almost everything is overacted, and does not look believable at all. I wish they made it more serious like the first TV series. For the most part, the story feels really compressed, and compared to the original series, they just show all the action, but none of the psychological drama. As always, the manga is much better, so if you haven't read it yet, do so.",1202428800,,440,4.5125
2627858,5,B000H5V8NQ,"I ordered this brand new and received it today! I was so ecstatic to open the packaging. I was thrilled to see the quality of this Limited Edition set.

My Alucard figure came perfect and in mint condition. The case for the dvds is a steel case. It's gorgeous and metallic red. I'm absolutely thrilled to have this in my collection. It's just plain gorgeous. I would not recommend storing this next to the other steel cases, as it might scratch or get pressure marks from being next to the others.

An extra bonus for me was the audio commentary and extras dvd. So on top of the beautiful anime and manga-true storyline, you get a nice boost from the cast.

If you've read the manga, then you will be used to the little humorous side steps this series will take. It's very true to the manga. (If you've only seen the first Hellsing series, you might not take well to the comedy.) Any fan of Hellsing should be glad to have this piece. It's collectibility is very high now, as well, what, with Geneon USA falling out.

Aside from that, it's a great anime series. Even though we won't see the rest of the series for awhile, we will see it eventually. Don't let the nay-sayers make you rethink this one, because you might end up regretting it. Any Hellsing fan should want to grab these up while they have the chance. I am absolutely happy with this purchase and I am going to get the other two as well. It's a piece of anime History.",1198713600,,1431,4.348314606741573
2627863,5,B000H5V8NQ,"Lets be honest - this series was created to appease the hoards of Hellsing enthusiasts who loved the TV show but yearned to see more of Hirano's brilliant manga in animated form. As such I think it's important for any potential viewer to note that this OVA assumes that you've either seen the original TV show in it's entirety or read what's been released of the manga. The events are fast paced and the character introductions/developments are a bit rushed, but they have to be; even though the manga isn't complete there's a lot of catching up to do if this OVA is to replicate Hirano's storyline. For someone who is familiar with the Hellsing universe this comes as little consequence.

A friend let me borrow her Hellsing DVD's (TV show) a few years ago and I was captivated. Characters = brilliant. Conecept = exceptional. A year or so later I would start to read the manga series and, while it too stunned me, let there be no mistake that they are quite different. Aside from differing story lines the manga often focuses very intently on character development, such as Hirano's idea of Alucard's lack of humanity vs. his self identity as a monster. This OVA series takes these ideas very seriously and incorporates them into their animation as carefully as possible.

Aside from storyline and the subtle character aspects to the show the OVA's animation is superb; the animators payed particular attention to the endless power Alucard seems to posses, and do everything they can to bring that out visually. Battle scenes are amazing and closely resemble the comics. Character design is a bit different, again mimicking the manga series. Indeed, it sometimes seems as though the animators try to follow the comic frame for frame during certain sequences of shots.

In short, a fan of Hellsing will not be disappointed. Whether you are a hard core fan of the manga and want to see it in animated-action, or, like me, you're just happy to see Hellsing re-animated into an epic OVA this series will satisfy.",1197072000,3,2010,4.786743515850144
2627864,5,B000H5V8NQ,This will be short and sweet.  This anime is awesome! It closely follows the mange and is gory enough for the most bloodthirsty horror freak.  They used most of the voice actors from the original OVA.  The music isn't as good but the animation is better.  Buy this and enjoy!!,1188777600,,276,4.46
2627865,3,B000H5V8NQ,"I have never read the original manga. So I am coming at this review directly comparing it to the original anime. And when you do that folks this new series seems to fall quite short.

I have seen the entire original series, while only seeing this vol of the newer series so I will reserve judgement on the rest.

Like other posters have already said this vol mostly rehashes what many have already seen, however does it much faster and with out near the atmosphere and character development of the original anime.

The art while good at times, also drops into silly comedic spots that are not appropriate to the overall theme of the series, I found myself missing the consistant quality of the art of the original.

I have not heard the dubbed track on this vol, so I can't directly compare those, but in the original anime its one of the few times in my opinion the dubbing aids the series far more than leaving it in its original language. As far as the music is concerned, original anime wins out on this again with moody tracks suitable to the theme of the show, while the newer one seems to use a faster pace dance style music at times.

Seras Victoria while far too timid in the original, one of my few complaints for that series, was the character that helped lead you through this world of Hellsing, the newer series she is the victim of a weakening of character, from her change to the vampire, far better represented in the original anime, to those ridiculous changes in art style, adding unneeded comedy to her. She is a shell of a quality character and missed as a point of view character in this new series.

Other key characters while closely resembling there original anime counterparts, are done a disservice by a larger focus, losing some of the mystery and complexity of characters found in the original anime. No character with the possible exception of Anderson is improved in this vol.

To be honest if this series truely represents the manga source material it would honestly put me off the book.

If you are looking for a really good anime of Hellsing, it would do you better to look up the original.",1188259200,2,2123,4.5248041775456915

Okay, I realize this is just the same story repeated in a new rendition and I have to say some of the art in this is fantastic, BUT there are many flaws I can not see beyond.  First, what is going on with the audio track???  The voices are barley audible over the soundtrack that I might as well just turn on the sub-titles, it really drove me nuts!  Plus I say the animation is great, but how the hell does someone attract that much glare in the glasses they are wearing?  It was ridiculous!  I don't know how many reviewers have watched the complete original animation, but the story flow in this one was a complete bore.  There is no depth in the characters, the feeling for the Police Girl is completely gone and it seems far too comical.  I took this DVD back immediately not even caring that I lost money from it.  If you want to waste your time with nothing more than a vampire action disaster, go right ahead.",1187308800,,983,4.213903743315508

2627869,3,B000H5V8NQ,"Please do not confuse this as a special edition of the Helsing collection, it is not that at all.  The purpose of the Ultimate collection is to ""right the wrongs"" that the Helsing anime put forth.  The popular anime had drawn comment from critics for many reasons, it ventured far from the plot of the manga it was based on (which was not completed at the time of the series creation) and the character focus was more on Saras as the new comer into the group to acclimate the viewer with the plot.

This series follows the manga more closely, but as the manga and the original anime begin at the same point, this volume seems a bit rehashed and rushed.  This volume covers into the middle of the the original anime's story and then continues to the manga's ""true"" story when the anime diverged.  Having seen the original series and red the manga I could follow the story yet it seemed rushed and a little fractured, which may be the direction that was hoped to be achieved.

The art in this anime is darker and rougher than the original anime and more similar to the manga, but contributes to this version having its own style.

Over all I enjoyed this volume as a revisit to the Helsing story, but it felt a little rushed and lacking, however, this seems to have been intentional so as not to have to rehash the plot that many had seen in the original anime while still getting new people up to speed.  I did continue on the the second Ultimate volume and I found that with the new material the story slowed down and clarified quite a bit as well as delving more into the back background of Alucard and Integra.",1184716800,,1612,4.385906040268456
2627870,5,B000H5V8NQ,"This is how Hellsing was meant to be! The original series were good, but in my opinion, subpar compared to its manga. The art wasn't all that inspiring (considering how amazingly drawn the manga was), and I thought the action was a bit on the slow side. But now... be amazed, because these OVA breaths new life (no pun intended) into the series.

First and foremost, the art follows the original work by Mr. Kouta Hirano. Never seen the manga you said? Well, it's very good! It's like Joe Mad (don't tell me you don't know who that is) on acid. And far as the action and the pace is concerned, it's much more dramatic and whole lot quicker; since it's fitting in about 3 episodes worth of material in this 45 minutes program. Fear not however, it's done in a fashion that's quite smooth, nothing felt rushed.

So, if you like vampires, violence, gore, blood, evil laughs, a bit of comedy, and English accents (Although Alucard speaks American), then you should give these OVAs a try.",1179705600,4,983,4.548022598870056
2627871,4,B000H5V8NQ,"Packed with action, sharp wit and gore, Episode One in the 'Ulimate' series brings Kohta Hirano's first manga installment to life!

The series is far truer to the manga than the TV series (although that's excellent also)! In terms of the animation and story, it's more egde-of-your-seat and contains much more graphic, over-the-top action and gore than it does dialogue. Nonetheless, you are still very much placed in the heart of the original Hellsing story.

I have to say, I slightly prefer Episode Two, but that's only due to the fact that I LOVE the Valantine Brothers, especially the duel between Luke and Alucard. You're in for a REAL treat if you share my appreciation for the animators' hungry attention to detail!

2627888,5,B000H5V8NQ,"Okay, so you probably saw the Hellsing TV series (I own it myself, and it's good), so you'll possible expect that the OVA series is just as good.  I've got news for you... it's BETTER than the TV series.  The OVA is clearly faithful to Kohta Hirano's manga, to the depictions of the characters (they really amped-up Seras Victoria, making her more agressive, and there's a little more detail about Paladin Alexander Anderson), to the humor, which was missing from the TV series.

A word of warning:  The OVA series is more violent and bloodier than the TV series, which makes this not a family-type anime.  Make sure the kids are in bed before seeing this... if you have any kids, that is.",1169942400,4,689,4.569105691056911
2627889,5,B000H5V8NQ,"The first OVA of this popular manga is just as the creators said it would be - faithful to the manga. Covering the first volume of the manga, it might be a little fast paced for those who have seen the anime series, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and knowing what's coming up (as I have read the manga to its most up to date volume 9), I am truly looking forward to future episodes and the splendid animation. I also appreciate that Hirano and creators are taking time to bring the best possible episode to us, but gotta admit, the waiting is just painful ;).

As far as the soundtrack, I liked it enough, but I did find the one for the anime series to be slightly better. This OVA 1 soundtrack just seemed a bit ""Halloweenish"" to me. We also have all the talented voice actors from the anime back to resume their respective character roles. Alucard's English voice this time around, however, does seem a bit softer compared to the anime, but perhaps that will change especially with what's to come.

The disc of special features is about 1 hr composed of trailers, music videos, pictures, and a ~30 minute interview segment which provides info. on how the voice actors were cast. Good stuff.

Finally, some remarks about the DVD sold by Amazon.com - it seems there is a one disc edition and a 2-disc w/ figurine edition. I actually bought my dvd from Best Buy, which had an exclusive 2-disc edition (without the figurine). If you want the extra disc of special features but without the figurine (costs much less!), I would probably not buy it from Amazon.com since this listing is just for the one-disc as per the description.

Hope this review helps, fellow Hellsing Fans :-)!",1169856000,5,1675,4.5364238410596025
2627890,5,B000H5V8NQ,"I liked the original series, don't get me wrong; but the Hellsing Ultimate Vol. 1 has truly done a great job of trying to catch the spirit of the Manga series! It's as close to perfection as you can get, considering the fact you're trying to make an animated version of a book (books of any sort allow greater information to be made available, while animation gives better visuals); the first real battle Seras gets involved in shows her rising bloodlust is having an effect on her, unlike the original series, which hinted at the mental changes without SHOWING the effects. Father Anderson is more than a tad terrifying in that delightful way seen only in true madmen.

I'm waiting with held breath for volume 2 to be announced!",1169769600,3,729,4.651162790697675

2627892,5,B000H5V8NQ,"With smoother animation, more action and the original English voice cast, Hellsing Ultimate Vol. 1 is worth buying, particularly if you enjoyed the first anime series.  The OVA is far superior to the original series in every possible way (I like the new soundtrack though others don't) so if you're even remotely interested in the world of Hellsing then I can highly recommend this DVD.",1169078400,3,386,4.938461538461539
2627893,4,B000H5V8NQ,"is not the same as being grand.  The first Anime, made for TV, had great music, characters and artwork.  The only failure was the plot - as the manga was not near the completion the anime had to go out and make its own ending.

Now the manga is almost complete and this anime plans to follow the plot.  But the artwork sometimes seems wooden, the music is no where near as good and some lines are just not needed.  Why would Sir Hellsing call Arucard a ""count""?  Why hit us over the head with that fact?  If you are a fan you know who Arucard is and if you are not, well, thanks a lot for giving it away!

At 50 minutes a DVD there will have to be 9 or 10 DVDs just to cover the basic plot.  No extras but some trailers.  Sad.  Not worth the money.  Buy used.",1167955200,6,759,3.9210526315789473

If you loved the TV series you'll love this even more(Plus if it were not for the TV series being so popular the ova wouldn't look as good as it does).The music may not be as great as the last but it fits well. The dvd is a bit short but still good.

2627896,4,B000H5V8NQ,"I will not harbor any ill wil towards the Hellsing TV series. The tv series is what started me into Hellsing. However, as I started reading the manga I realized the tv series never came close to the original story.

I felt kinda cheated. The manga is original in art and story. It takes so many twists into so many areas. Love it. I mean where else can you have a nun taking out terrorists?

Now I welcome you to the Hellsing OVA vol. 1. This a treat for any fan of Hellsing and a good starting point for newcomers. In art style and story telling it is very close to the manga.

For fans, this will feel like a rehash of past episodes in the TV series. Its done differently with better animation and action.

English dub (ED). Hellsing I have to say is one of the few animes that have a tight cast to fit to stay true to the characters. Most of the original ED cast from the TV Series is back. Plus better than ever. You can tell the actors are more comfortable with their parts.

Now for the bad stuff.

Its short. I won`t lie, it left me wanting more. Things just seemed to rushed, but I understand that this is an ""introduction"" rather than a real plot giver. This leaves more room for the rest of the story to follow. From what I understand the OVA is staying close to the manga. A good thing. This means the next volumes will venture more into the oringinal story. I can`t wait for those scenes to be animated.

My biggest peeve about the OVA is the music. Its..like nails on a chalk board. It dosen`t even fit with the mood of the series. The music for the TV series was better by far. So much better.",1165536000,22,1607,4.164516129032258
8136693,5,B000H5V8NQ,"Alucard is the one who got me hooked on anime vampires making him my favorite anime vamp, it starts with and has some of the same elements as the Hellsing series but soon takes a far darker turn. We get to see into Alucards past getting what I've always wanted to see some of the vampires history his beginnings etc. This is awesome way bloodier gorier and darker than the Hellsing series. Example later in the series recalls his days as Vlad the impaler, Alucard had a girl he really loved but others did not want him with her and it took a very bloody turn. In no 9 he remembers how as a child he was raped by a male adult

Walter is very differen't amazing and shocking as well don't wanna ruin it for those who've not seen it yet a sample there is a very interesting plot twist put on his already phenominal butt kicking abilities he becomes young, and is a total hunk, and a shocking secret is revealed, promise Hellsing fans will love it.

I watched this anime and felt as though the pages of the manga were coming to life, and I was so happy to discover that the original voice actors (like Crispin Freeman and Victoria Hardwood) had returned. Compared to the last anime, the animation is better -though the improvement on the animation shines in later episodes of Ultimate. Overall, it elaborates on details included in the manga which the original anime did not include.
