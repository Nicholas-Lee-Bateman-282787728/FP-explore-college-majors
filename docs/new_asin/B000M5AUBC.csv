8166648,2,B000M5AUBC,"If you want to truly learn the art from the internal martial arts that actually teach internal energy development and manipulation of that energy such as in iron palm, iron shirt, or anything in the ""iron"" category, then this is where you need to go: [...]
One cannot learn an internal art in the true sense from a practitioner of a basically external art, even if chinese in origin, such as tiger claw, dragon, etc. Only the truly internal forms and practices can do this. Such as hsing i, pakua chang, and even the white crane and northern mantis. If you want to learn this right, from the inside out, then you must train with someone that has been trained to teach that way and in that type of style. Trust me, that this link will take you where you want to be, and for under $100 bucks.",1455148800,,790,4.344594594594595
8166649,5,B000M5AUBC,good reference disc on a difficult subject,1415232000,,42,5.142857142857143
8166650,4,B000M5AUBC,"The professor teaches in a way clearly and specifies!
It is a good video tres of training in the kung fu.",1374883200,,105,4.0476190476190474
8166651,1,B000M5AUBC,It has been over 4 months and I still have not recieved it in the mail!  I just waisted good money.,1325203200,,99,3.7142857142857144
8166652,2,B000M5AUBC,"I should have saved my money.  It took weeks to arrive, by the time it had, I already found plenty of free info on iron palm training.  This dvd does not include anything that blew me away.  I was expecting something more I guess.",1313366400,2,230,4.181818181818182
8166653,3,B000M5AUBC,Well I will be quite harsh with the rating here. This DVD does give you the basic types of training you need to do but barely anything that will get you an iron palm in 100 days. Mung beans is kind of a soft surface to be starting with. In previous training I have used river rocks instead. There are a lot more training methods you could follow along with this DVD but DO NOT have this as the most important training. Have it as a training that you would do after finishing the intense workout (other Iron Palm training).,1312070400,,522,4.23
8166654,3,B000M5AUBC,"The Video, while fairly well done, is probably not worth the extra cost. The book is a reprint of the classic text, the only problem being that many images are dark and hard to make out. The Video present fairly clear presentations of what is in the book but the internal exercises on the Video do not agree with the book.",1285372800,,322,4.295081967213115
8166655,3,B000M5AUBC,"The video was pretty good, it's very straightforward. If your familiar with basic martial arts strikes you should have no problems, and he explains pretty well so beginners should be fine too. I do think it lacks in explanation of internal energy cultivation and projection, so having some internal energy experience would be beneficial to the user. If your just looking to get tough hands, this video will do it!",1280534400,9,413,4.914285714285715
8166656,5,B000M5AUBC,This is an awesome dvd. There is alot of information provided here. You can really learn alot. I highly recommend this dvd. The set with the book is an icredible value also!!,1170892800,5,174,4.46875
