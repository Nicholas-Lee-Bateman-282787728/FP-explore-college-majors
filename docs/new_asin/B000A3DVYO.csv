2355983,5,B000A3DVYO,"This is the second DVD of four from Shawn Trautman that we've purchased.  It walks through a number of beginner patterns that all build on each other and the speed and repetition was real good for us.  We like this style much better than just standing there swaying and it was easy to learn.  If you or your partner just stand and sway, I strongly recommend this one.",1162684800,,367,4.367647058823529
2355984,2,B000A3DVYO,"My husand and I purchased this DVD to sharpen our dance skills.  It was extremely basic, so if that's what you are looking for then this is for you.  The DVD was NOT new.  The steps were extremely basic and they teach you without music.  It moved along very slow, so my husband lost interest and we quit practicing with it.  It was not all that we had hoped for.",1162598400,3,362,4.114285714285714
2355985,5,B000A3DVYO,"My wife and I have been doing Ballroom dancing for 10 yrs. and we had countless dance lessons both private and group but none of our dance instructors taught us how to slow dance the correct way. So, we could do the Rumba, Cha-Cha, Swing, Waltz etc. and look pretty good on the dance floor but when it comes to slow dancing we just sway back and forth not knowing what we were doing. Shawn's DVD on slow dancing is easy to learn and makes you look good on the dance floor because it is the correct and proper way to slow dance.",1161475200,14,527,4.12621359223301
2355986,5,B000A3DVYO,This is a wonderful dvd to learn some beautiful moves for slow dancing and is very well taught.  My wife and I are very pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others.,1148083200,14,174,4.2727272727272725
2355987,5,B000A3DVYO,"My husband and I are not dancers and shy away from dancing in public.  But this video has really helped.  The instructions are very clear, step-by-step, and give lots of demonstration and practice. Shawn also includes enough extra steps beyond just the basics to put a little pizzaz into it!!  I am thrilled!",1132099200,28,308,4.773584905660377
8073883,5,B000A3DVYO,"This is a good DVD for a couple who wants to be able to dance at their own wedding or other events such as wedding receptions, holiday parties, cruises, etc.  Dancing with a little style is so much more fun than just doing the junior high style of stepping back and forth- and with this one DVD and a little practice it is very do-able!

You should know that this video is very basic.  A great place to start.  However, if you have had some dance training in the past you may want to choose one of Shawn and Joanna's other specific dance DVDs or review DVDs.  If you are just starting this is a good DVD.  One great feature of this DVD is the specific instructions on several dips and several turns, which could be incorporated into any dance style.

I highly recommend Shawn Trautman instructional dance DVDs.  Shawn and his wife Joanna are excellent teachers.  Shawn does an excellent job of breaking down the footwork and also provides tips on style and leading.  Joanna does a good job on providing info on following and style- and she makes funny comments along the way keeping it fun.  They are very down to earth and personable and really care about feedback from dancers.",1209600000,,1179,4.488262910798122
8073884,4,B000A3DVYO,"I bought this video shortly after my engagement to help prepare my fiance and I to at least put on a worthy show for our first dance at our wedding.

It worked.  At least, good enough.

I won't discredit the value of this presentation.  You're getting what you pay for.  You aren't going to be the belle of the ball after watching this, but you shouldnt' step on too many toes.

Shawn presents a handfull of useful if not overly basic dance steps - enough to get you through your typical slow-dance love song.  When it comes to repeating the steps, you'll find yourself doing a lot of fast-forwarding to get through the boring parts - and there are plenty.  But he definitely helped us have an enjoyable and memorable first dance.",1198627200,,730,4.4772727272727275
8073885,5,B000A3DVYO,"My boyfriend and I love to dance together. He is from the islands and knows how to do most of the Latin style dances and had somewhat of knowledge about slow dancing, but after watch Shawn Trautman's Slow Dancing DVD, it took his skills to a whole new level. I on the other hand have always enjoyed dancing but never had the time to take private lessons, but after Shawn and Joanna's teaching, I won't need them.

Instead of going out we spent a Saturday night in watching the DVD. It was one of the best date nights we have had in our three years of dating. The dance instruction is done at a nice easy pace where we both were able to learn our part before dancing the steps together. The hour spent learning was followed by an additional hour of slow dancing on our own and showing off to our family the new moves.

Another good aspect of the DVD was Shawn gives good tips to dance couples while on the dance floor such as good positions to be in for photographs and proper hand placement when women are wearing different types of dresses. These tips were helpful to my boyfriend and I considering all of the weddings that we have coming up the next year.  We had such a wonderful time together and look forward to trying out some of Shawn's other DVDs like the Latin Dance sampler.",1187136000,,1284,4.319502074688796
8073886,5,B000A3DVYO,"I am not a dancer--not by any stretch, so I was a bit hesistant when I purchased the Slow Dance for All Occasions, as well as the dvds of salsa, the cha cha, and swing. The lessons that Shawn and Joanna provide are very easy to follow. They do a very good job of separating the steps for the lead from the follower's steps, and even with my two left feet, I could pick up the moves!

One suggestion that I would make: The lessons go pretty quickly from one to the other, which is nice because they build on each other, however I had to take time to really master each different turn and such. All in all though, the lessons are very simple and the Trautmans, while excellent dancers, do not make the steps look impossible. You'll definitely learn from them and see some improvement!",1184025600,,782,4.319727891156463
8073887,5,B000A3DVYO,"This is a great DVD if one is just learning how to slow dance. This should probably be the first dance one learns. Shawn and Joanna do a great job in explaining lead and follow basics. The DVD gives enough information to learn the basics with overwhelming the viewer. Clear, concise explainations. Excellent!",1176336000,9,308,4.830188679245283
8073888,5,B000A3DVYO,"My love and I just started working through this dvd together in preparation for our upcoming wedding. We're only a third of the way through the dvd, but I already can tell I won't be feeling like an idiot or stomping all over her feet during our first dance and that makes both of us pretty happy.

The teaching structure is that Shawn and Joanna demonstrate each of the basic moves together. Then Shawn takes you through the man's part nice and slow showing not just the footwork, but also the principles of how you lead your lady to execute the particular move.

He shows most of the moves several times before Joanna shows the ladies their parts in much the same fashion. If it's still not slow enough (hey I'm a klutz afterall) you can always replay the segment and the great thing is your instructors will never get frustrated that it's the 949th time you've made them demonstrate the move.

Once you've both seen and practiced your parts you get the opportunity to walk through the process together as Shawn and Joanna show you the whole thing -- usually 2-3 times.

The chapter divisions are very convenient and easily called from the menu so after you both think you have mastered a basic move you can turn on the stereo and start testing the moves out to a nice slow romantic song of your choice till you really feel like you're ready to go back to the dvd and learn the next piece of the dance.

If your inspiration starts to wane there's a very nice segment at the end where Shawn and Joanna put it altogether and really show you how a man can show off the woman he loves on the dance floor on that special occasion. Every time I watch it, I'm ready to go back to practicing again.",1173052800,7,1692,4.375796178343949
8073889,5,B000A3DVYO,"My fiance and I are using this DVD to practice for our upcoming wedding. We have viewed other dance tapes but Shawn's are the only one's that show how to lead and follow. The steps are broken down clearly and at a good pace for beginners. The only additional feature that might be helpful would be to view the dancers dancing to music. Customer service is excellent. I have both emailed and called Shawn directly to ask for imput on our ""First Dance"".

We are so hopeful that we can learn to dance with lessons from Shawn and Joanna that I have just ordered a second DVD on Country Dancing.",1171497600,6,590,4.363636363636363
8073890,5,B000A3DVYO,"I highly recommend this DVD for beginner dancers who want to learn the proper way to lead & slow dance your partner on the dance floor. Shawn and his his wife break down the steps in a way that is easy to follow, even if you've never danced before. I purchased this DVD to learn for my upcoming wedding. I thought I would have to pay for private lessons to learn; now that I got this DVD I know I won't have to do that. This DVD is great and you won't be disappointed; you also save money from paying for private lessons.",1169596800,8,521,4.067961165048544
8073891,5,B000A3DVYO,"This DVD really breaks down the dances clearly, and shows moves for each partner individually so both can see how the moves work. I definitely recommend it!",1164758400,9,156,4.814814814814815
8073892,4,B000A3DVYO,My husband and I are very pleased with the Slow Dance DVD.  Shawn breaks it down step by step.  It was basic with a touch of class!  It looks so much better than just standing there swaying back and forth.  I liked the DVD because you can do these slow dance steps and look really classy at the same time!  Need to get this one if you don't like swaying back and forth!,1164585600,8,369,4.0
