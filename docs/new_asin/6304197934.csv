Noriko is now on the completed Exelion and is heading into deep space, as a small fleet with the Exelion tries to locate the enemy. Noriko will run into problems with her partnership with Kazumi, and as a result, will befriend her first crush. However, tragedy does not wait for everyone. With hard lessons learned, and the battle now looking grim, Kouichiro ""Coach"" Ohta makes plans to complete the Gunbuster on the Exelion. Does Noriko have what it takes to pilot it and save the Exelion from destruction? New revelations to the enemy will also be discovered, as Noriko must face an enemy she has never seen.
The plot remains excellent and the Japanese voices remain solid, as well as the music. The animation has improved a little bit since the last volume as well. Seeing the Gunbuster in action as well is a treat to watch.
With this second volume done, we're down to the last explosive volume, leaving sitting in our seats waiting in anticipation.",1112140800,,1027,4.648351648351649
7864735,5,6304197934,"If you are an Anime fan, then you must see this series. Wade through the bouncing breasts and the sometimes kiddie voice acting and you come up with a very solid piece of science fiction not to mention a great work of Anime. The scope of this series is simply awesome and the last episode (In black and white, letterboxed) will leave you breathless. Some people, like me, think the last episode was the result of funds drying up. Others think that it was done on purpose. The end result is a not-to-miss triumph of animation.
Buy this tape.",986515200,6,540,4.4646464646464645
