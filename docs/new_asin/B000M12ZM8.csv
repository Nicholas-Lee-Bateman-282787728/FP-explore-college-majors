He was sincere in his error but Lucia said the 1984 Consecration ""took"". He didn't accept that. I would advise anyone to not buy this dvd.",1440979200,,289,4.178571428571429

8165568,5,B000M12ZM8,"I'm so very glad to have purchased this wonderfully informative DVD, and am very thankful to the good people who produced it. The whole film is laid out in a clear and very effective way to get the message out, this should be mandatory to watch, especially for non believers of the Fatima miracle. Only those whose pride comes first and couldn't employ the mind God gave them would find this a waste. I'll pray for them.",1355270400,,420,4.467532467532467

To quote a phrase from one of the movies regarding The Blessed Virgin Mary ""To those who believe, no explaination is necessary. To those who don't, no explaination is enough!""",1301875200,,250,4.837209302325581
