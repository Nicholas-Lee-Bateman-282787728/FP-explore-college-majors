1486301,5,B00005JM0O,"On September 11, 2001, 343, (three hundred forty-three), of New York City's Bravest were killed while doing their job, rescuing people at the World Trade Center. The tragedy of September 11, and the loss of these courageous men and women, as well as the deaths of thousands of innocent human beings, haunts the people of New York to this day. ""The Guys"" is a most powerful and fitting eulogy to those who sacrificed their lives so that others could live.
A fire captain, (Anthony LaPaglia), of a ladder company located in lower Manhattan, lost eight of his men when the Twin Towers collapsed. Six other men in his firehouse, part of the engine company, also died that day. He is experiencing tremendous grief, and is obviously still in shock, when he approaches a journalist, (Sigourney Weaver), to ask her for help in composing eulogies for ""his guys."" He says, ""The call came. The guys went out. They haven't found them yet. The families want a service. What am I going to tell them?"" The journalist, living with her own grief, sadness and depression, has felt helpless, useless when confronting the terrible events that have so impacted her city, the nation and the world. At last, by helping this grieving, inarticulate man to compose the eulogies for his men and their families, she can do something to help.
The writer coaxes information about each lost firefighter from the captain, piecing together anecdote and tidbit until portraits emerge that give life to each individual. The result is a thoughtful and powerful tribute that makes men who became heroes into human beings again - recognizable to friends, family and co-workers.
The screenplay is superb, as is the acting of Weaver and LaPaglia. He is steeped in sorrow and loss, but emerges from his shell occasionally to relate stories about the guys. Ms. Weaver, appears to be walking a fine line between giving in to her feelings and trying to be objective, to empathize with LaPaglia in order to glean as much information as she can.
This film has been produced in a very tasteful manner. There are no shots of fire and destruction. The catastrophe is portrayed in a very poignant manner, by sheets of paper from the WTC flying along the street, near the firehouse. The music is exquisite and appropriate. As a New Yorker, I feel better having seen the film, and for this powerful reminder of The Guys.

1486505,5,B00005JM0O,"What a powerful movie!
No planes crashing into the twin towers, no fire and smoke spewing out of the gaping holes left by the impact and no collapsing building.
But, it's still a powerful movie, maybe more so because it's just two people, a firechief and a writer pouring their hearts out about how that horrific event impacted them.
I wasn't there on 9/11,I live in the South, and I didn't get to watch it unfold on live TV, I was running a cash register that day. Sure, I heard about the first airplane from a coworker whose husband called her with the news. I was angry, why would someone want to fly a piper cub into the WTC? Then, I was horrfied to discover, from a customer who told me about the second hit, just what kind of aircraft they were. But, I thought the fires would eventually go out and, though it would take months to repair the damage, the building would be back in commission. Then, I heard about the pentagon! What's next, why aren't they stopping these guys, I wondered. Then, another customer told one of the other cashiers that an airplane has crashed in PA. I had no way of knowing,but I bet the passengers got wind of what was being done with these airplanes, overpowered the hijackers and crashed theirs.
Then,I heard that the South Tower was down. I was upset, yet there was one still standing, the North Tower would look strangely alone without its twin, but don't you fall, too, I was hoping. Then, it fell! All those people dead! Buried! It would take ages to find them, then clear the debris so they cab build two now twin towers.
Yes,I wanted them back, even though I'd never seen them. I've come to agree that the ""footprints"" are too sacred to be hidden under two new buildings and I think the pools are a lovely tribute to all that was lost that day. And, the new One World Trade (Freedom Tower) is already beautiful, even in its incomplete state. I plan to make my ""pilgrimage"" in 2014. Want to make sure everything's ready and open to the public, inclung the 9/11 museum.
Back to the movie. I bought it yesterday and watched it right away. In small doses. It made the human cost of 9/11 so emotionally real to me that I had to pause it several times to regain my composure.
If any of you are 9/11 survivors, or you lost someone that day and someone tells you to ""get over it"", punch them out and, after the regain consciousness, give them a copy of this movie. If it doesn't make them sing a different tune, they're a lost cause.",1354233600,,2468,4.379084967320262

1486508,5,B00005JM0O,"""The Guys"" is the finest movie I've seen so far in the 21st Century and contains the performance of the decade by Anthony LaPaglia.  A New York firefighter captain (LaPaglia), who must deliver eulogies for eight of his fallen men, approaches a writer (Sigourney Weaver) to help him shape and articulate his thoughts about his heroic breathren.  Anne Nelson's screenplay, amplified by Jim Thompson's direction, ferrets out the soul of strong blue-collar sentiment and couples it with the essence of what writers do - taking the words, thoughts and feelings of others and distilling them into an accessible, digestible, compelling form.  ""The Guys"" is one of the most moving experiences ever adapted to film. - Ed Blank, film critic (ret.)",1257206400,,737,5.125
1486509,4,B00005JM0O,"After a tragedy, how do survivors cope?  How do family members heal?  How do those not directly affected relate?

In The Guys, the tragedy of 9/11/01 has occurred.  A fire captain (Anthony LaPaglia) has lost 8 members of his crew, and must prepare for the upcoming eulogies.  However, the scope of the disaster was so large and so powerful, that he is at a loss to know what to say.  He turns to a New York City journalist (Sigourney Weaver) who is grieving in her own way, to assist him.  Together they work to capture the lives, and deaths, of these firemen.

This is not a movie depicting the last few minutes of those lost while attempting to rescue others in the Trade Towers.  It's not an action movie at all.  In fact, the most haunting scene is the black and white image from a firehouse surveillance camera showing an off-duty fireman just showing up at the station to see his friends, and then noticing the cloud of paper escaping from the damaged towers.  He gears up, and leaves to do his job.  And like the others, he never returns.

Haunting, yet uplifting.  The Guys is about real people, real suffering, and real remembrance.",1238803200,,1141,4.529411764705882
1486510,4,B00005JM0O,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guys/dp/B00005JM0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guys</a>&nbsp;is a simple movie that humanizes the pain and suffering that first responders endured on September 11th.  How many eulogies could you give in a week, a month, or a year?  Fire Captain Nick Costello, played by Anthony LaPaglia, didn't have the choice. He had to give a countless number of them for his men from the Fire and Ladder Company in the destructive wake of 9/11.  And with 350 men still missing at the time, he didn't know how many more he would have to give beyond the first 7 that had been planned.  They included men as close as his best friend and as distant as the rookie he knew only two weeks.  And each of their stories had an impact and a meaning.

Sigourney Weaver has a solid role as the writer who shows the civilian side of the 9/11 aftermath.  Though she was not in the towers, she is forever changed by the events of that day.  And she is not alone.  Every person from Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, New Jersey, Connecticut and Long Island was affected in a deep way by the events of that day.  In a sense, every American everywhere was affected too, as was anybody in the world who ever walked through the twin towers.  You don't have to have been a fire-fighter to understand the extreme sense of loss created by the events of 9/11.  And by showing us both sides of this equation, this film gives a more comprehensive personal portrayal than some other more high profile movies about the 9/11 attacks.

One of the things that is apparent watching this film is that the dialogue reads very much like a play.  I not surprised to read in the product details, after I had already written most of this review, that it was written as a play by Anne Nelson and adapted for the screen.

Most of the pivotal scenes are dialogues between LaPaglia and Weaver that take place in her home.  He recounts the lives of the men that he must now eulogize, and she takes notes and asks questions to help him put those eulogies together.  LaPaglia really shines here, with simple and direct acting that is honest and highly effective.  You have no doubt when you are watching this that he is that fire captain, that those stories he is telling about those men are real stories.  It's a rare thing in a film to have the story come to the front and the *film* blend into the background.

The one aspect of this film I would have changed is the use of voice-overs in the writer's voice.  In the beginning and at a few random times throughout, there are some voice-over moments with flashes of Weaver on the screen.  This attempt at artistic introduction to those scenes seems forced considering the rest of the film is essentially a play.  This technique doesn't take away too much but it doesn't seem to add much either.  The close-ups of Weaver reading as she types away her thoughts are well done from an acting point of view but still should have ended up on the cutting room floor.  While some of her inner monologue is very interesting I don't think this method was the best way to deliver them.

Still, the characters are the center of this film and they are very well written.  If I ever get the chance to meet the playwright, Anne Nelson, I will have to ask her if the Weaver character is based on her.  That's the best testament to good writing that anybody could ever make.

The crux of this movie is the emotional roller coaster ride that comes from learning about the victims and reflecting on them.  While New York City is also of central importance, the film somewhat makes this a more national story by focusing so many of the scenes in Weaver's home office.  In that sense, these conversations could have happened anywhere.

This is one of those movies that aspiring actors can learn much from and lovers of good acting can enjoy.  Straight to the point and yet powerfully moving, it's difficult to imagine a more affective way to humanize the events and aftermath of that fateful day in 2001.

Enjoy.",1227484800,,4082,4.631432545201669

1486512,5,B00005JM0O,"Virtually all of the other reviews of this are spot on. LaPaglia is riveting in this role and Weaver takes the ever-so-slightly back seat to him, as this is primarily supposed to be his story. But what I would like to add is that when his tales finally reduce her to tears and he's distraught at her pain, she says...""I can't just watch it on TV. I want to do something. But this is all I know how to do. Words. I can't think of anything else.""

(I have the wonderful stageplay in front of me...my memory's not that good!)

He replies
""(Wonderingly) That's OK. They're your tools.""

Later, when he's delivering his final eulogy, he says (in the film, he looks in her direction)
""We depend on our tools. They're all important. When you go out on a call, sometimes you break through metal, sometimes wood. You need different tools. When you're answering an alarm, every tool counts.""

This meant alot to me...that even if we aren't a firefighter or police officer, that perhaps we have a gift, or ""tool"" that's needed in horrible times. I take comfort in that.",1217289600,,1058,4.523560209424084
1486513,4,B00005JM0O,"This is what I'd call a quiet movie.  It sounds boring when you summarise the plot but the wonderful acting draws you in.  Basically there are two people for most of the movie, one a fire chief and the other a writer.  This fire chief has to speak at funeral/memorial services for the men he lost on 9/11 and enlists help to write the speaches.  At first he is withdrawn but gradually he opens up and together they write fitting eulogies for those men.",1213747200,,452,4.345238095238095

1486585,5,B00005JM0O,"This film offers a realistic view of the grief of a man who loses his comrades, men for whom he was responsible.

1486586,5,B00005JM0O,"Anne Nelson's play wonderfully captured on film runs the gamut of emotions.  Sigourney Weaver as a journalist helping out a fire captain (Anthony LaPaglia) write eulogies for eight different men from his ladder is poignant, funny and eventually heartbreakingly real.  The initially awkwardness of the two meeting is overcome by personal anecdotes and touching stories each share to bring about the final product which is to give each fallen hero his accurate due.  Weaver and LaPaglia are perfect in their portrayals as two people trying to help each other in a horrific and emotionally draining period which commands them to bring out the best of each man's life.  It is essentially a love story.  The pain each character feels when discussing each man individually is a rarity in films and this one gets it right.  This film acts as a healer for all affected by 9/11.",1118880000,12,869,4.917808219178082

Watch Anthony Lapaglia's eyes. You can feel the emotional depth of being lost and helpless; confused (not being able to really comprehend the why behind the act), and the immenseness of the loss resulting from the event. Sigourney Weaver is quietly compassionate, maneuvering through the confusion of feelings to find the personalities of the missing comrades. It's beautifully done and Sigourney Weaver and Anthony Lapaglia were perfect choices for the roles.",1104278400,4,524,5.469135802469136
1486589,5,B00005JM0O,"*****

This movie is, on the surface, a simple story about a fire captain who is assisted by a writer in composing eulogies for the men he lost in 9/11.  However, it is much more than this.  As the writer tells her story (how she worked with the captain), she explores the many complex ramifications of 9/11 on New York City, and indeed, upon all of us.  Moreover, as the captain and the writer work together, you come to see the firefighters individually, and to appreciate their daily service and sacrifice.

It is a moving and powerful movie.  It is somewhat painful, but in a good way, as we all need to be reminded of 9/11, to never forget.  There are no graphic scenes or heavily disturbing visual scenes.  I cried at several parts through it.  It deeply affected me, and I will not forget it, as I do many movies, once their story has been told.  I don't think I'll ever look at firefighters the same way, either.  Although it is a movie about one moment in America's history, it is a movie about all of life, too, and a good exploration of grief and existential things (without being preachy or intellectual at all).

The acting was great, music great, and it was put together in an unusual way--9/11 through the eyes of two people writing eulogies--who would think of this?  But it works, and it works well.

This is a movie to own.  If the idea of the movie interested you enough to even read this review, I would highly recommend getting it.

1486590,5,B00005JM0O,"I stumbled across this film this morning while waiting for a call from my son. I didn't know what it was at first because I came into it a few minutes late. I soon realized what I was watching. I found this film to be very touching. It brought back much of the sorrow I felt for all in New York during that time. At the same time, it provided me with comfort in knowing that there are still so many people like these men out there doing their jobs as firefighters, police, etc. Saving so many lives day after day. I think this film captured the essence of those men and gave many of us a chance to glimpse into their lives. I believe we owe them that much. In conclusion, I give this film 5 stars.

I'm not a big fan of soppy platitudes about 9-11, but this movie was very touching.  It dismissed a lot of the big-picture stuff in favour of the minutia of people's lives that make them worth knowing about.  This is a story about humans, not heroes, which I found refreshing.
Sigourney Weaver is also very good, as usual.
My only complaint is that there were a few instances of repetition in the writing.  I'm not sure if that was supposed to be deliberate, as in the character repeating himself out of angst and stress, or if it was bad script editing.  I noticed it though because it was jarring, which means if it was supposed to be there, it wasn't handled expertly by the writer.  That could have used some polishing.

7939913,5,B00005JM0O,"As hard as it is to watch, I seem to have a magnetic attraction to the movie, The Guys, starring Sigourney Weaver and Anthony LaPaglia. A haunting story, it is about Nick, a New York fire captain who has been asked to give the eulogies for eight of his men missing since September 11. Grief overwhelms him and he has no words to express his sorrow or to comfort the friends and families of the fallen. He turns to Joan, an editor, who helps him find words and give them structure.

""Tell me about Jimmy,"" Joan says, or Patrick, or one of the others. Nick shakes his head and gropes for some image, some fragment of a conversation lingering in his mind. Just words and phrases""mischief,"" ""lives with his parents,"" ""kitchen""provide hooks for Joan as she gently, persistently draws from Nick pictures of the missing men. Her gentle probing and ability to organize his scattered thoughts bring these lost lives into clear focus. The results of their grueling efforts are stunning.

It's as if Nick had never seen his guys fully until this experience. Even his knowledge of his best friend, Patrick, crystalizes through the agonizing process of preparing Patrick's eulogy.

The magnetic power this film has on me is two-fold. First, it is the value of the individual, the uniqueness of each person who has ever lived, that calls me back to this intense dialog. My feelings are like those that Joan expresses as she struggles to come to terms with the sudden and devastating loss of life in New York, her beloved city. ""I knew that every time I saw someone on the street I just saw his public shadow. The rest, the important part, lived in layer after layer beyond my view. We have no idea what wonders are hidden in the people around us.""

Secondly, Joan's insight, patience, and hunger to breathe life into the memories of Nick's comrades allow her to persistently grapple with this project. There is something so deep, so real that needs to be salvaged from the wreckage of September 11 and Joan is willing to do the hard work to uncover the treasure. As a writer who tells people's stories, I am moved and challenged by Joan's example.

I believe anyone who watches The Guys will be impacted by it. Whether or not you are a writer, I recommend it. People around us have stories to tell and hidden wonders to share. Perhaps they are just waiting for someone like you to help them find the words.",1447200000,,2392,4.605633802816901
