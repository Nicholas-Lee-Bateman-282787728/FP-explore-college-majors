5676862,5,B00BUWD7C0,"The main reason I purchased this four disc movie collection was, because of the movie ""Vibes"".  The other movies are likable also.",1394150400,,130,4.909090909090909
5676863,4,B00BUWD7C0,"I've always had a soft spot for Vibes.  Cindy Lauper is sweet and goofy, the story is interesting, Peter Falk is great, Jeff Goldbloom is Cindy's romantic interest, the Peruvian scenery is great, Cindy's end song is very nice, and the bad guys get their just desserts in the end.  I watched Leonard Part 6 once.  Can't remember much about it and am unlikely to watch it again.  I remember the leads in Cops and Robbersons from seeing it years ago, Chevy Chase and Jack Palance, and they were fun.  Eventually I'll watch it again, but not now.",1391731200,,542,4.489795918367347
5676864,5,B00BUWD7C0,"Why is it that ""Vibes"" seems to be the most expensive movie from the 80's to track down? It's a lot of fun, I'll admit, and when I saw it included in this collection, I had to jump to buy it. My sister's been looking for a copy for years, and it was great to see it again.",1388361600,2,272,3.706896551724138
5676865,4,B00BUWD7C0,I love this movie...but could have done without the other movies on the discs as they were not as good.,1388188800,,103,4.2
5676866,3,B00BUWD7C0,"Had there been SDH or CC, I would have enjoyed this collection immensely.
Being near deaf I had to jack the volume up to distortion levels to hear much of it.
Possibly an issue with the audio mastering as well.
Still a better value than trying to hunt down these cult classics individually.",1387324800,2,290,4.490566037735849
5676867,5,B00BUWD7C0,"This is a great way to acquire an inexpensive copy of ""Vibes"".  The movie was as entertaining as I remembered from the movie theatre.  I really enjoyed watching this gem again.",1384646400,,176,4.645161290322581
5676868,5,B00BUWD7C0,"I bought this specifically for Vibes and Cops & Robbersons. I was apprehensive about the quality, it's not usually a good idea to compress more than one film on a DVD disc. I need not have worried. I'm very pleased.",1384646400,,215,4.4
5676869,5,B00BUWD7C0,You get three movies for the price of one.  I love Cops and Robbersons - Love Jack Palance!  The other two movies are like a big bonus.  Not many bargains like this one!  Glad we got it!,1377561600,,186,3.945945945945946
5676870,5,B00BUWD7C0,Vibes is the reason I got this movie it is a very cute movie that is hard to find under $50.00 and it came with other movie too . I don't recamend this movie for kids it will scar them . The Three known actors in the movie act grate together . I will watch this movie many more times.,1375920000,,284,3.75
5676871,3,B00BUWD7C0,"...but if you are looking to find the cult classic ""Vibes"", this is the cheapest option.  I have a soft spot in my heart for Leonard Part 6 as well :)",1375056000,3,150,3.838709677419355

8574394,5,B00BUWD7C0,I love the movie Vibes and this is a great deal,1482883200,,47,3.3636363636363638
8574395,3,B00BUWD7C0,Great movies from the 80s. The reason for my  3 star rating  is because  one of the disc with vibes froze at the end. Definitely  a defective  disc. I would  have returned  it but didn't feel the hassle,1470960000,,202,4.157894736842105
8574396,5,B00BUWD7C0,I love Vibes!! I hadn't watch the others yet and may not lol. This was a great deal! If you love Vibes buy now.,1459728000,,111,3.6666666666666665
8574397,4,B00BUWD7C0,"The video quality is good for non-high-definition.  At least one of the movies is worth the price of admission, otherwise nobody would buy the package.  We, here at campy movie lovers central, enjoyed three movies - such a deal!",1457913600,,228,4.82051282051282
8574398,5,B00BUWD7C0,Very funny.  Must watch.,1438819200,,24,5.0
8574399,5,B00BUWD7C0,Love that Vibes Movie! Great 4 pack of movies!,1418428800,,46,4.222222222222222
8574400,4,B00BUWD7C0,"We got this for exactly ONE movie, which was cheaper than buying it separately. The quality is a little iffy, but at least I didn't have to spend a ton of money.",1410998400,,161,4.0625
8574401,4,B00BUWD7C0,Vibes is a great movie - the other ones not so much.  Not a problem seeing them on a  Blue Ray player,1398902400,,101,3.5454545454545454
