8117759,4,B000AU7G0W,"This is a beautiful and sad story about the encounter of an inocent nun with an expert seducer. It is based on a novel by Eduardo Mendoza that I have not read, but the actors' casting is esplendid and one can imagine why it happened what happened. Besides the love story there is a flood, maquis and what else. Very interesting.",1237766400,,328,4.39344262295082
