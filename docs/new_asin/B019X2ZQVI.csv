8746239,1,B019X2ZQVI,"CURSE OF THE SWAMP CREATURE (1966) is another cinematic water-boarding from legendary ultra-schlock director, Larry Buchanan! A mad scientist, named Dr. Simond Trent (Jeff Alexander) is conducting his nefarious experiments in his swamp lab. He's turning a man into the monster of the title. Meanwhile, oil man, Driscoll West (Bill Thurman). is set up by a group of crooks, only to be killed. Now, one of the group (Shirley McLine) pretends to be ""Mrs. West"", in order to fool West's associate, geologist Barry Rogers (John Agar- TARANTULA, THE MOLE PEOPLE, THE BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS, ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS). Rogers and ""Mrs. West"" set out by boat, along w/ the other crooks posing as guides, into the swamps. They're prospecting for petroleum don't cha know! This occurs while Dr. Trent is busy feeding his pet alligators, while jungle drums play on. His experiments continue, while his oblivious wife (Francine York) reads magazines. Mrs. Trent wanders into the lab, witnessing the horror within. Dr. Trent gives her a real talking to, along w/ the back of his hand. His dull, monotone voice is hypnotic, bringing drowsiness. The inexplicable drums bang on! After what seems like decades, Rogers and company arrive at Trent's swampland estate, where nothing very interesting or entertaining happens. There are more drums, though. Thankfully, there's also the nonsensical, non sequitur ""snake dance"" sequence! This all, somehow, leads up to the ""shock"" finale, when the far-less-than adequate creature is revealed. Once again, Buchanan manages to warp the space-time continuum, by turning an hour and twenty minutes into an eternity of abject suffering! Yes, this is damnation for our sins! Let us pray for redemption...",1504396800,,1728,5.2644927536231885
