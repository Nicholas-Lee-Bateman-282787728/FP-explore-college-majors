8485749,4,B005T3AMSS,"Another DVD with Metal Mind, so you know what to expect, nice camera work, always the same venue, the bands don't have much to pay for this if they pay something, and everybody is happy! It gives exposure to the band and to Metal Mind Productions. This is the tour to promote the new cd of the band with the beautiful title ""The Seventh Degree of Separation"". This one contains shorter songs with a lot of punch and is the occasion to present the new singer Paul Manzi. This singer as a strong voice and strong arms, he must work out every day...

The new album is well represented here with 7 songs, the rest is a couple of tracks from their others cds. The music of Arena as always remind me of a heavier version of Pendragon with a strong Marillion influence, first period era. It's symphonic prog with a hard edge, and plenty of beautiful atmosphere with the master on keyboards, Clive Nolan.

The light show is dominate with plenty of blue and the stage is often immerse into a complete dark, which is probably a illustration of the dark concept of the new cd. By the way Clive and Paul have both ti-shirts with skull head.

The picture and the sound are clear, and the 5.1 surround mix, like all the Metal Mind Productions releases is mostly present to create atmosphere and not really to hear instruments in different speakers.",1365811200,8,1334,4.481481481481482
