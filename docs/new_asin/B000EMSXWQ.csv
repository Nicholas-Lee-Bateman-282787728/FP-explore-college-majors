The constant cutting is nerve racking and does a great
disservice to the structure and visual appearance of
each of the pieces. It makes me wish I had a seat in the
audience.",1212364800,25,230,4.372093023255814

If you love the skill, beauty and graceful art of contemprary ballet, you will be enthralled by Bejart's outstanding choreography and some of the most beautiful, talented dancers of our time.
