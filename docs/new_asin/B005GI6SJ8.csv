4690647,4,B005GI6SJ8,"""Augustine - The Decline of the Roman Empire"" deserves to be better known.  People who like St. Augustine will like this movie.  Christians will like this movie.  Ancient history buffs will like this movie.

This four-hour flim begins and ends with Augustine as an elderly bishop in Hippo under siege by the Vandals.  An extended flashback tells the story of Augustine's early life and conversion to Catholicism.  For the sake of creating drama, the movie does not keep meticulously to the history of Augustine's life.  I thought that would bug me, but it didn't so much because the movie kept the spirit of the main characters intact so well.  Augustine, Monica and Ambrose really come to life here.

What you probably really want to know is something like:  Is this film hopelessly cheesy?  Is it poorly dubbed?  Does it actually play in English on an American DVD player?

Fortunately, the answers are:  No, no, and yes.

The script is very good.  Cheesiness and over-obvious lines are kept to a minimum.  The film is truly entertaining and enjoyable, and kept my interest the entire time.  The dubbing is the best I've ever seen.  Although this movie was originally filmed in Italian, it looks like the actors must have shot a version where they mouthed the English words, and had British actors do voice-overs.  The lips and voices match up incredibly well.  It doesn't detract from the movie at all.  And if you're American or Canadian, yes, this is the version to buy.  It has Spanish and English audio, and it plays on a Region 1 DVD player.

If you are multilingual or have a multiregion DVD player, you might be interested in the other two versions of this movie available on Amazon:

4690651,5,B005GI6SJ8,Very well made video on the life of St Augustin  a present day doctor of the church whose works are still studied by people wanting to learn more about God.,1379116800,,156,4.2

4690655,4,B005GI6SJ8,Good movie and this comes with a spanish side if you like.  I guess this originally was a tv mini series.  The quality of the picture is good but it doesn't seem to fill out to the 16 by 9 very good.  Good price on it though,1367107200,,224,3.723404255319149

4690657,1,B005GI6SJ8,It was written that the movie had sub titles in English well it didn't. I was very disappointed. I thought for sure since it clearly stated subtitles in English and Italian the it would have English. Again I was so disappointed,1366156800,2,227,4.560975609756097
4690658,5,B005GI6SJ8,"Very good movie.
Help me to give an idea about how the situation of the life of St. Agustin, and St. Monica, his mother.
The life of a very smart man in the secular world. His passion in searching the truth and live it passionately.
It shows how ""smart"" people could use his knowledge to create their own ""truth"" and manipulate, or they can use the skill to bring the truth of God. The movie is dubbed in English, but it looks so perfect and looks like it really speak in English. Wonderful movie!",1364169600,,497,4.297872340425532
4690659,5,B005GI6SJ8,I am impressed with the survice I got with the video San Agustin.  The video itself is excallent. The actors are first class and the story is supurb.  I learned alot from this movie and I have a great love for St. Monica and St. Agustine.,1360886400,,238,4.1521739130434785
4690660,3,B005GI6SJ8,"I've been looking for this film everywhere. Apparently there's no DVD/BDR in the US and this was my only choice besides poor quality youtube clips. The quality of the video is OK, it's not your typical dvd but I appreciate that I can watch the whole film. I love the movie and I can't wait until the Blu Ray is released.",1359676800,,320,4.262295081967213

4690663,5,B005GI6SJ8,"I bought because a reviewer said it was also dubbed in English.  The initial few (mandatory) items are in Spanish, but then when main menu arrives, change the audio to English and you have a quality English film.  Doesn't appear to be dubbed (although it is) - seems completely natural.  It seems to me this must be the movie Ignatius Press is modifying and putting out in English as ""Restless Heart.""  It is real quality all around and exceedingly well done!  (Although I wish some of his pre-conversion life were not quite so graphic - not for kids.)",1351987200,7,552,4.591836734693878
4690664,5,B005GI6SJ8,Have enjoyed this 2x and am getting ready to watch again.  I just wish the extras had an English dub as well.,1345420800,,109,3.9545454545454546
4690665,5,B005GI6SJ8,"This movie is gripping, moving and memorable. There are a few things here and there that were fictionalized but very well done and the fictionalized parts were true to the subject.  I learned allot.

There are two disks.  One has a young Augustine on the cover and one an older.  I recommend splitting them up and watching one on different days.

A minor appointment's..  no mention of the biographical book on Antony written by Athenasius  which the real Augustine found moving.",1344211200,,479,4.839506172839506
4690666,4,B005GI6SJ8,"This was an interesting series running exactly 199' covering the life of saint augustine (354 - 430) and his conversion to christianity. Although his life was interesting we wanted to see more politics involved as we know little about this dark period of the empire. We get to see little from the vandals and their king geiseric as we get to see little of the politic scemes in ravenna cause by 386 the emperor gratian was assasinated and we hear nothing of the usurper maximus who wanted to replace little vallentinian II on the throne of rome as we hear nothing about the great theodosius emperor of the east.
 Anyways this series resembles jesus of nazareth and it's a great addition in out roman dvd collection.
 Hopw we get more films with more politivs about the 5th-6th century roman empire.",1328486400,,798,4.692857142857143

It was very well made, from acting, picture and sound quality, and translation are all superb.  Good introduction for those interested in this awesome Saint. We definitely recommend this movie.

8471669,5,B005GI6SJ8,"This film is a definitive three-hour miniseries on the life of St. Augustine of Hippo, one of the most beloved Western church fathers of late antiquity, and it will be of great interest to Protestants and Catholics alike. This disc is primarily produced for Spanish-language audiences, but the English-language track is pristine, offering well-acted drama and great visuals. In addition to great performances by Franco Nero as the elderly Augustine and Alessandro Preziosi as his dead-ringer younger self, this movie offers a fascinating portrait of the rarely-visualized last years of the Roman Empire under its Arian Christian rulers in Milan and their conflicts with Bishop Ambrose. The film starts with elderly Bishop Augustine facing down the barbarians as they prepare to storm the gates of Hippo in AD 476, then flashes back to Augustine's youthful indiscretions and conversion, giving us the essential meat of the ""Confessions"" with everything from the theft of fruit from a tree to the ""take and read"" moment where he encountered Paul's words in the scriptures. It also depicts Augustine's spiritual journey in surprising detail, taking us from his youthful Manichaeism through his career as a public orator. The actor and actress who portray his mother St. Monica and St. Ambrose, the two principal influences on his conversion, bring a fierce integrity to their roles. The scenes of Augustine's graced moment of conversion and of his later showdown with the Donatist heretics are particularly moving before the film returns to latter-day Hippo for its equally-involving climax, as Augustine negotiates between the Vandal barbarians and Roman governor while refusing to leave on the ships sent by the pope to rescue him. Ignatius Press is now releasing a DVD of this film for U.S. distribution that includes a 2-hour theatrical cut in addition to the three-hour television cut, each on one disc. That's a better packaging than this set, which offers the film in two parts on two separate DVDs, but I highly recommend getting the film in either packaging. This movie is the definitive screen portrait of St. Augustine.",1384128000,,2127,5.222222222222222
