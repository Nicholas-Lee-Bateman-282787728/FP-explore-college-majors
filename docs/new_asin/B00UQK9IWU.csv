7067169,4,B00UQK9IWU,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to write one for this DVD.  I am an Intermediate/Advanced exerciser.  I do 99.9% of my workouts at home and have an extensive video collection - Cathe Friedrich being one of my favorites.  I bought this to try because I wanted straightforward cardio and it looked like fun in the preview.  This workout will certainly challenge you BUT, I highly recommend skimming through it a few times to familiarize yourself with the moves.  There is minimal cueing on the video (if any at all). The only way to get familiar is to do it a few times and memorize the steps.  I feel there is a moderate potential for injury as well so I would recommend not following Michelle but the modifiers on the right and left of her who move more like normal people.  Michelle reminds me of of a ball in a pin-ball machine - she is all over the place - her movements are very bouncy and her stretches and moves sometimes seem overextended.  So proceed with caution.  Otherwise, have fun!",1452211200,3,1014,4.437837837837838
7067170,5,B00UQK9IWU,Michelle Dozios is an amazing instructor!  I have several of her videos and all of them are very intense and deliver great results!,1447977600,,131,4.695652173913044
7067171,5,B00UQK9IWU,Another fun Peak Ten Video. I love her format...it's easy to follow and very challenging. Hope she keeps churning these out!,1444003200,,124,4.9523809523809526
7067172,5,B00UQK9IWU,"Love this DVD. I have used Michell Dozois DVDs before and found them effective and fun. This is the icing on the cake. She is a great trainer and the workout is really challenging, I love the build up and the music is motivating. Can't wait for get next DVD.",1433030400,2,258,4.18
7067173,5,B00UQK9IWU,Michelle Dozois has a great personality she encourages you all through  the work out and is full of energy and enthusiasm. The workout is awesome it constantly challenges you and by the time you reach the peak you are really pushed. Because the workout is split into 10 segments the hour flies by. Really enjoyable and effective!,1433030400,3,329,4.771929824561403

8707854,3,B00UQK9IWU,"I'm giving this 3 stars because it's a very effective cardio workout, the climb, peak, whatever format is fun and interesting, it's professionally produced and the music is good, and I am so happy that some instructors are still producing dvds rather than switching to downloads and streaming exclusively.  However, I did not like the workout because the moves change SO quickly, with very little advance cuing - it reminds me of those very intricate step videos from the 80s where you spend half the workout trying to keep up and the frustration level keeps mounting.  For interval workouts, which are challenging aerobically, I greatly prefer Cathe Friedrich's approach of keeping the moves simple and straightforward, it is hard to try to figure out the moves while working so hard physically. Also, Michelle seems to scream a lot which is odd because the audio is obviously dubbed so even if she had to scream over the music when it was being filmed, when the audio was added she should not have had to scream so loud. I am going to try a few more Peak 10 workouts and see if any of the others are a better fit.",1504051200,,1115,4.626262626262626
8707855,2,B00UQK9IWU,Very awkward moves. Don't like early as much as her others.,1484006400,,59,4.454545454545454
8707856,2,B00UQK9IWU,It's  to fast for my taste and  I don't  care for transition  to  the floor and standing exercise that really sucks,1469491200,,115,4.285714285714286
8707857,5,B00UQK9IWU,"This is a fun workout! It's challenging, but easy to get use to and you can always make it more challenging as you get use to it by increasing the weights you use. I feel like the pace is just right to burn calories & keep up with. I always feel like the time was well spent.",1467331200,,275,3.8421052631578947
8707858,5,B00UQK9IWU,love her peak 10 series,1466121600,,23,3.8
8707859,5,B00UQK9IWU,"Great cardio workout.  I was sweating from the get go.  Not boring at all but be prepared to work hard.  The intervals are challenging and some of the moves are complex.  However, it's a great workout for your body and mind.  I love how she throws in dance moves and kickboxing moves.  It's advanced with intermediate modifications provided.  It's similar to her other peak videos as it moves quickly from move to move but nothing to get frustrated about.  I wouldn't want a workout that I master the first time around because that's boring.  I like the fast pace and quick changes because it keeps me thinking and motivated.  It is a real challenge so if you're not interested in a high intensity, fast moving workout you might want to skip this.",1461542400,5,747,4.590909090909091
8707860,5,B00UQK9IWU,"I have three other Peak 10 DVDs and love them, so I knew what to expect.  Yes, Michelle's choreography takes a few times around because she moves fast, but there is a movement preview and I recommend watching it first, just to get an idea.  Personally, I love that it takes some thought and coordination; that's what keeps it from being monotonous.  This is the most intense of the Cardio Interval Peak 10s in my opinion.  I've been doing the other two cardios for about a month, and they are tough, but this one kicked my butt!  (I would consider myself an advanced level, as I work out 6 days a week and have done so for years).  This is not for beginners!  But if you like a good, intense workout, this one is for you!",1459814400,6,721,4.257352941176471
8707861,1,B00UQK9IWU,"I wanted to like this but could not wait until it was over.  Workout consists of bazillion -3 second steps - not fun or effective.  Also, shot from a wide distance so you can't see instructor very well.  If you like cardio then T-25 is the best out there.",1455926400,2,255,4.163265306122449
8707862,5,B00UQK9IWU,Great even when you are out of shape.,1454976000,,37,3.75
