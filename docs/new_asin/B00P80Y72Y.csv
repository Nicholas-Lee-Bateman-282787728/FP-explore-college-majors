6788862,3,B00P80Y72Y,O.K. Movie not great,1424217600,3,20,4.25
6788863,3,B00P80Y72Y,I don't think it is worth that kinda money. The acting is very choppy and robotic almost sometimes especially for the kids. It was an okay movie I wish all the actors were good actors. I wouldn't watch it again though.,1423353600,,218,4.341463414634147
6788864,3,B00P80Y72Y,It was okay. Could've done a little bit better on the special effects.,1423008000,4,70,4.461538461538462
6788865,5,B00P80Y72Y,"Every now and again there comes a movie that is well directed & scripted with a great cast.
A Horse for Summer is a movie for the whole Family as it tells of a young girl who is sent to
Her Uncle Kent, a struggling rancher battling to keep his ranch afloat.
It's also a heartwarming story of Trust & Forgiveness which makes it an ideal Family Movie
everyone can enjoy.",1421884800,10,368,4.197183098591549
6788866,1,B00P80Y72Y,Horrible movie from the low budget to the acting this movie is not worth the time. It is too bad because there are some great actors in it.,1421539200,2,139,4.0
6788867,5,B00P80Y72Y,"A clean, wholesome family movie teaching kids about caring and doing good and family. It gives opportunity to teach kids lessons about stealing, trust, forgiveness and family strength. Easy to watch.",1420761600,11,199,5.451612903225806
6788868,5,B00P80Y72Y,"It can be difficult to find a decent non-animated film suitable for the entire family and I'm happy to report that, ""A Horse for Summer"" fills that void! Almost a little heavy-handed on the religious aspect at times, but never too much to handle. Nice to see Dean Cain as the father and what a joy to see Lee Meriwether, too! A film that everyone may want to watch several times.",1418428800,16,379,4.352112676056338

8686706,2,B00P80Y72Y,"This movie was advertised as a 'horse' movie (and, the young actress was featured in a popular US horse magazine). First of all, the photo on the cover it totally misleading - the girl and the saddle look nothing like the movie (first clue the producer knew nothing about horses or riding). The young girl never shows her hair in a pony tail; nor, did she ride English (she also spent little time with horses throughout the movie anyway). This is minor compared to its other shortcomings, however. The relationship between this young woman and horses is barely visible compared to the overriding moral of the story. Yes, its good to have moral stories (and yes, it certainly has a completely Christian message), but whomever produced/directed this movie obviously knew nothing about the relationship between humans and horses; nor, knew ANYTHING about horses. I am disappointed in this movie and I saw no reason to have purchased it . But, its not a total loser as a family film as long as families aren't offended by predominantly Christian values. Its better to teach young people honesty; and to learn from their mistakes, than to teach them nothing or the opposite. Oh, and by the way, it wasn't clear that Summer ended up with a horse in the end. The movie should have been entitled How a Confused Teen Gets A Second Chance (while eventually riding horseback in the [absolute] End of the movie) And Reunites with Her Incarcerated Mother.
