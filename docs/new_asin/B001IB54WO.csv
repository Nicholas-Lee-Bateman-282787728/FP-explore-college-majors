8310663,4,B001IB54WO,"Three years before she found her greatest fame playing the title role in Roger Corman's ""The Wasp Woman"", Susan Cabot played the unhinged, sociopathic Sabra Tanner in SORORITY GIRL, Corman's unusal psychological drama from 1957.

Filmed on the USC Campus and utilising the real sorority houses, Roger Corman injects the movie with a hard-edged realism which is completely at odds with the other low-budget quickie films that he was helming for American International Pictures (AIP).

The odd girl out in her sorority, teen bitch Sabra Tanner (Susan Cabot) spends her days manipulating and torturing poor pledge Ellie (Barbara Crane)--going so far as to paddle her with the sorority bat! She blackmails would-be class president Rita (Barboura Morris) by threatening to reveal that her father has been in jail; and later uses--gasp--pregnant Tina (June Kenney) in an extortion plan to seduce Rita's boyfriend Mort (Dick Miller).

The entire movie only runs for sixty minutes, but within that brisk hour there's a ton of blackmail, bitchery and backstabbing, indeed so much that it's guaranteed to have your shaking your head in astonishment! Susan Cabot, in my opinion the greatest and most talented actress of the 1960s B-movies, gives the role of monstrous Sabra everything she can muster; you'll be amazed by her performance. A shining talent taken from us too soon. And it's fun seeing Cabot and Barboura Morris together here (Morris plays the dimwit secretary in ""The Wasp Woman"" with Cabot).

Definitely a noteworthy title for serious B-movie fans.",1242259200,2,1552,5.245967741935484
