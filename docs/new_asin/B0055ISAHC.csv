8458429,5,B0055ISAHC,"These performances were my key to understanding this period of music.
Achucarro is perfect.
Now I understand why his Brahms's recordings are so powerful.
This is a must own recording.
I know what I like and I love this.",1359849600,2,219,4.641025641025641
8458430,5,B0055ISAHC,"Joaquin Achucarro is a well know pianist with a very distinguished career. What makes this Blu-ray disc special and an exceptional one is the choice of repertoire. Falla's Night in the Gardens of Spain is just an incredible composition. Anyone who has visited Spain will immediately relate to it. It is recorded in Berlin without an audience, it is like they are playing for you only! The second part, Achucarro recital in Madrid is just extraordinary. Although it is entitled as Falla and his friends, it is heavy on Ravel (at least in performance time). The sound that Achucarro achieves with the piano, well reproduced by the technicians, is a pleasure. Even the fortissimos sound delicate. I strongly recommend this Blu-ray to those who want something slightly different than the ""conventional"" recitals and enjoy a perfect piano sound.",1312243200,11,840,5.094202898550725
