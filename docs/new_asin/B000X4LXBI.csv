8226975,3,B000X4LXBI,"Speaking about Km 31 (kilometer 31) requires to talk about 2 things: technical merit and a good story.

Technical merit. For a Mexican movie, ""Km 31"" has a great production, an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 sound that made me believe for a moment that someone was whispering to my right ear -I'm an horror movie die hard fan and not get scared easily-, until I realized it was the right sourround speaker. The movie uses a grayish green filter -a la ""Dark Water"" that uses a green one- that sets a cold and dark mood, it even has computer generated special effects. Those things are not new in Holliwood movies, but in Mexico this is a step toward a serious effort in delivering quality horror productions to audiences.

Story. Although the story is not completely original, it uses an element that adds originality and freshness: ""La Llorona"" (the crying woman), a classic Mexican folklore tale about a female specter that wanders the streets at night.

In the final balance, Km 31 it's a very good horror movie, it's a gripping and oscure spine chilling tale.",1207267200,2,1059,4.713513513513513
