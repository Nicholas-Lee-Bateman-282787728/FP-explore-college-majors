8069874,1,B0009XT8XI,This video was made a long time ago.  It is not current with today's busy kids!!!  Much better video's on the market for helping your child learn how to read!!!!!!!!!!!!,1220227200,,169,4.6
8069875,1,B0009XT8XI,"The 2005 release date is indicative of the product's new titling and packaging only.  The children pictured on the box are not featured in the video.  The video appears to have been made in the 70's or 80's at best.  Sound is muffled.  Phonics teaching methods have come a long way since this.  The instructor pronounces letters ""M-uh"", ""L-uh"", etc.  When she makes a mistake, she corrects herself and goes on.  There are no retakes.  At one point, her marker doesn't work and she said to herself, ""I hope your marker doesn't mess up like mine.""  Who was she talking to?  I wish I had known about the original production date when I made this purchase.  I feel deceived.
I highly recommend Rock-N-Learn Phonics.  It is complete (I can't find a phonics skill that is not covered), and it is captivating, at least to my child.",1212969600,4,824,4.568493150684931
8069876,1,B0009XT8XI,"Don't be fooled by other reviews. This video is a poor copy of a VHS into DVD. The picture quality and sounds is terrible. The original recording is from 1991, but the poor quality makes it look like it's from 1971. The teaching can not keep my son's attention for more than a few minutes - and he loves to watch these kind of videos. Don't buy this recycled junk.",1193788800,,364,4.214285714285714
8069877,4,B0009XT8XI,"The cute little girl on the front is no where on the video. The female instructor uses a dry erase board to write word families. She sounds out the words as she spells them then repeats the word after writing it. There is an excellent vignette at the end of the DVD in which the dialogue is written at the bottom of the screen. It includes phonetic words with the short vowels. There are no cartoon characters or cute songs or graphics, but it does teach what it claims in the title. It is a great ""substitute teacher"" for me when I am temporarily busy. Then I reinforce the lesson without the DVD. Great purchase.",1175299200,2,614,4.3478260869565215
8069878,5,B0009XT8XI,The material is very good. My 6 yr old loves the dvd and reads/learn/plays along. I am re-learning phonics and now realize that I may have mislead her in sounding words while trying to help her be a better reader.,1157587200,,213,4.35
8069879,2,B0009XT8XI,"This second volume is certainly superior in video quality to the first volume, and it is educational.  However, we are disturbed by the prolonged boxing scene between two children where spectators cheer for physical (not a linguistic allegory) hitting abilities, and by the prominent use of the exclamation ""shut up!""  We find that the Leap Frog series provides similarly good education, more captivating entertainment, and no troubling content.",1147737600,23,445,5.529411764705882
