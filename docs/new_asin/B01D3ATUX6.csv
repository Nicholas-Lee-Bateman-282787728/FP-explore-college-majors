I also like how she talks about what Chakras are affected and what organs are being cleansed.  The set is simple and calming.  I hope she makes more dvds!",1461110400,4,309,4.258620689655173

8754776,5,B01D3ATUX6,This is a wonderful yoga practice with entirely different poses than her Detox Yoga. Amy is a great teacher because she is easy to follow. All levels are challenging and worth doing. In fact I think this DVD is a little better than Detox Yoga and I like that one alot as well. Highly recommend.,1484870400,2,294,4.363636363636363
