8504256,4,B006TXDRG6,I've always been an avid western fan and hadn't seen this movie since I was a boy (a long time ago!) so I was anxious to see it again. Although it stretches historical fact considerably I was more interested in the entertainment value and I enjoyed the movie very much.,1401408000,,269,4.4
