I feel much more confident after viewing the video a couple of times.  I have already noticed a difference in my Shepherd-mix with severe anxiety problems.",1299369600,,298,4.584905660377358
7906235,5,B00000F0WY,"As a professional dog trainer, I use TTouch techniques frequently and am always amazed at what an impact it has. Almost any physical or behavioral issue can be addressed and improved with Tellington's methods. Yes, the presentation of the information in this video is rather dry, but the quality of information outweighs the lack of production quality. If you're working through issues like aggression, hyperactivity, or hip dysplasia with your dog, this video is more than worth the money.",1099440000,5,490,5.215189873417722
7906236,5,B00000F0WY,"My dog recently sustained a back injury and the veterinarian suggested that she will need many weeks of rest. I really wanted to help my dog by doing something to make her more comfortable. My sister, Susan has an instinctive feeling for animals and keeps up on different ways to keep them healthy.  She suggested that I watch  A Touch of Magic for DOGS & PUPPIES.
This video gives pet owners a holistic approach to helping their animals.  The narrator, Linda Tellington-Jones has worked with animals for years and has developed different touching and handling techniques that are useful in providing relief from arthritis, dysplasia, aggression, timidity, car sickness, digestive problems, skin ailments and other problems that dogs are prone to having. She calls it the TTouch.
Tellington-Jones demonstrates various techniques and hand movements that can be used on the pet to calm them down and help ease the pain of an injury.  She says that one particular massage can bring an animal out of shock. If you've ever had to drive your dog to the vet with a horrible injury, you know how useful it would be to learn how to handle that situation.
I've just begun this, so I don't know what the long range effect will be on my dog.  I do know she loves the attention and seems to feel much better after I've done some of the different hand-kneading movements on her back and head.  The bottom line is that she knows that I'm trying to help her!  I feel very enthusiastic about this video.",1014508800,,1486,4.6923076923076925
