8486619,5,B005TZFZI8,"This is by far, one of the best documentaries ever produced on our ""Founding Fathers"" of America. They were all ""brothers"" in the fact that each of them wanted a Free and Independent Nation from England/UK. This is a 2 DVD set, nicely packaged. The artwork is excellent as well. The video quality and sound are good for DVD and I commend the History Channel for yet again producing another well done piece of a program for all Americans to watch. Learn again our history on what these ""Founding Men"" all had to deal with and go through as our young nation took foothold.

The Men covered in this program are ~
George Washington
John Adams
Thomas Jefferson
Alexander Hamilton
James Madison
Aaron Burr
Benjamin Franklin

Highlights of the program ~
~ The 1790 ""Compromise"" Dinner Party with George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson.
~ The Creation of ""Washington City/ aka Washington, D.C.""
~ Issue of Slavery brought up for debate in 1790. Southern States at the time had fierce opposition, with Georgia and South Carolina the most.
~ April 17, 1790, Benjamin Franklin dies.
~ The 1790s, political parties emerge, The Federalists, The Republicans.
~ 1791 Bank Bill signed into Law.
~ 1794 Protest over Whiskey/Distilled taxes which saw 150 Arrested/ 3 for Treason. (Washington would later pardon the 3.)
~ 1795 John J. Treaty with England which pretty much was conveyed as ""giving in"" to England's demands and not well received by citizens.
~ 1796 George Washington, serving two terms as President, retires to Mount Vernon, his home.
~ With 16 states now under Union, John Adams becomes 2nd President to USA.
~ 1797 Alexander Hamilton affair acknowledged by him.
~ Adams ""Quasi War"" preparation possibility with France.
~ 1798 The ""Alien and Sedition Act"" passed with outrage by citizens and would become Adams ""haunted piece"" of legislation. It was viewed as monarchy in words, tone, and deed in such Act.
~ 1799 Early Dec., George Washington rides out to tour his home of Mt. Vernon, but quickly gets caught in snowstorm and the elements. Catches what I think would be called pneumonia today. He dies at home on Dec. 14. The nation mourns loss of 1st President and General of Revolutionary War.
~ 1800, Election of sees Thomas Jefferson winning Presidency with the help of Alexander Hamilton breaking tie breaker with Aaron Burr.
Jefferson becomes 3rd President of USA.
John Adams loses Presidency by 8 votes, his 65 to Jefferson 73/4. (With Hamilton influencing the tie breaker, it cast the winning vote to Jefferson.)
~ The peace treaty with France is successful! The one John Adams had sent a peace convoy to France for, but too late for election benefit.
~ 1803, Thomas Jefferson dispatched James Monroe to buy Louisiana Purchase from France (Napoleon needed the money to continue war with England) for 15 Million Dollars. Congress balked at the cost, but Jefferson did it anyway and it turns out to be one of the greatest moves for a President, ever.
~ 1804 Re-election of Thomas Jefferson to the dismay of the Federalists. He would later in his second term have the Embargo Act against selling any goods, exporting them to England or France. (Eventhough we just made a treaty with France!) It was met with anger and disgust by citizens. Many lost jobs and it did nothing. Thomas knew, his second term was not a good one, but that he did the most good for the Country in his first term.
~ Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton Duel in New Jersey over bickering about politics and each others views. Hamilton writes letters to wife and sets his things in order. Alexander Hamilton dies in Duel. He fires shot not at Burr, but away from him to Burr's shock. Burr fires back and hits Hamilton mortally wounding him. July 11th, 1804.
Aaron Burr leaves city a broken man by all media and citizens alike. He never holds public office again.
~ 1808 Jefferson leaves office of Presidency and returns to his beloved Monticello in Virginia.
~ 1812, Jefferson writes former President John Adams and the two have a lengthy correspondence covering years and 158 letters.
~ 1818 Jefferson and Adams are among the last few left alive of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence from 1776 and acknowledge such in letters to each other.
~ Oct. 1818, Abigail Adams, former first lady, dies of Typhoid Fever. Jefferson consoles Adams through correspondence telling him he knows of such pain and anguish after losing many of his family members also.
~ July 4, 1826, Thomas Jefferson, ailing at home, and John Adams, ailing and sick at home also, both die on the 50th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson in reality dies first earlier in day, with Adams at around 5pm. Both are respected men in the American citizenry of the day and make front page headlines around the Country.

I highly recommend this documentary for all !! Narration is well done and keeps you watching throughout.",1428451200,9,4899,4.829761904761905
