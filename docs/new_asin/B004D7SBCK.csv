These are low res that is one grade better than VHS. White Rat looking the worse (if its possible). Not truly disappointed, these movies are decent for what they are. Do not spend a whole lot of money on this title. Can't believe Code Red would release such inferior product. Amazon should have stated that these are bad prints, then let us decide if we want them or not. The 1.33 framed movies are decent enough, they are the reason for the three stars. The DVD gets two stars. BUY WITH CAUTION!! You have been warned!",1299456000,5,660,4.418032786885246
