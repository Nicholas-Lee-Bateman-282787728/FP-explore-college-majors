2645082,5,B000HWZ4HU,"WITH ALL THE TOM CRUISE BASHING ASIDE THIS IS A GREAT TV SERIES.  THEY BOTH (CRUISE & THE 66 SERIES) TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE SAME CONCEPT.  EACH FITS IN ITS' OWN ERA BUT ONLY ONE WOULD APPEAL TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF BOTH 1966 & TODAY.  GUESS!!!  BUT THE SERIES IS ON MY LIST TO ENJOY TODAY.  I ALREADY HAVE ALL THREE CRUISE MI'S.  THERE ARE ALOT OF ACTORS THAT MAY NOT APPEAL TO YOUR POLITICAL, MORAL OR RELIGIOUS SENSIBLILTIES BUT DON'T LET THAT GET IN THE WAY OF ENJOYING THEIR WORK.  IF THAT WAS THE CASE I WOULDN'T SEE MANY MOVIES.  YOU WILL ENJOY THE SERIES.",1158624000,11,577,4.229357798165138
2645083,5,B000HWZ4HU,"I whole heartedly agree with Michael K. Beusch's review.  There are only two TV shows I made efforts to record on VCR to watch later: Mission Impossible and America's Funniest Home Videos.

The movie Mission Impossible was a major let down, I really really disliked it and gave the disk away; no place for it in my collection. Where was the team work?  Where was the awesome plot?  Why did it seem the movie was just an excuse to make one person look cool?

Why did it take so long for this awesome TV show to be released on DVD?  It should have been one of the first!  I can't believe all the junk TV shows that have been compiled on DVD but no MI!

The TV series was about teamwork, and, one of the best methods for ""winning"": using the enemies weaknesses against them.  This strategy seems totally lost today; today it's just more ""might makes right""...use bigger bombs and guns than the bad guys, no effort to understand the bad guys' perspectives and what makes them tick.  But I guess I should add that I'm not much of a movie goer or TV watcher any more...go Internet!  Too many TV shows today are mainly about close-ups on people's faces, boring.

I found very few holes in the plots that seemed illogical, I admit that the disguises or vocal impersonations were sometimes ""too real"" but maybe I could overlook it due to when I grew up. I only saw the shows as re-runs decades later, and I think we all know (or at least pretend to know) how much technology, surgery, etc... has advanced since the 1960's, as well as the fact impersonations (via comedy) are much more prevalent these days.

I never felt sorry for the ""bad guys"", since the show's authors usually made it clear they were up to no good, doing things to others they wouldn't want done to themselves, and like I said, the Mission Impossible team usually used the bad guy's weaknesses against him, sometimes directly, sometimes via his cronies.  So they were just accelerating his downfall.

It's been too many years since I dusted off a VHS tape to watch a show, but I HUGELY look forward to collecting/watching every show they made.  I just hope they release all of them and not a chopped up ""best of"", like some music band trying to stretch the one good album they made across 5 or 6 ""greatest hits"" albums.  I'm not sure I've seen every episode, but I never saw one I didn't like.",1157846400,28,2354,4.437209302325582
2645084,5,B000HWZ4HU,"When Mission: Impossible, the movie came out, I was expecting a big studio update of the classic TV show. What I got was yet another Tom Cruise star vehicle where he preens and postures and seizes the spotlight at the expense of everyone else in the film. To say I was disappointed is an understatment -- I was incensed! The IMF team killed off? Jim Phelps a bad guy? You've got to be kidding me! The TV series' concept of an elite covert operations team working together to save the United States from enemies, both foreign and domestic, was bastardized so Tom Cruise could flash his 1000 watt smile and save the day all by himself. I was so angry, I vowed to never see the film again or any possible sequels. It's a vow I've kept to this day and will continue to keep.

I'm sure that Mr. Cruise and his represtatives had something to do with the delay in releasing the original series on DVD. Thankfully, now that Paramount has shown old Tom the door, we can now see the series that started it all. Peter Graves' Jim Phelps is missing from the first season (Steven Hill of Law and Order plays Dan Briggs, the leader of the IMF during the first season). But Martin Landau as Rollin Hand, Barbara Bain as Cinnamon Carter, Greg Morris as Barney Collier and Peter Lupus as Willy Armitage are all present. Unlike most of the spy stories from the 1960's (and unlike the Tom Cruise film series), Mission:Impossible, the TV series, took a more cerebral approach to its stories. There's no James Bond in these stories -- just a team of agents who covertly depose all types of dictators, terrorists and traitors without leaving any evidence of their involvement. Just as Columbo turned the TV detective genre on its ear so did Mission:Impossible turn the spy genre on its ear.

Here's hoping that those who only know Mission:Impossible from the films have a look for themselves. I daresay they'll realize that the TV series is vastly superior to the film series and that the complete absence of Tom Cruise is a very, very good thing.",1157760000,438,2025,4.56043956043956
2645085,5,B000HWZ4HU,"What can be said about this show except release of the series on dvd is overly long overdue.  It is true that this volume will take many by surprise since Peter Graves as Jim Phelps is not a character.  Look for Steven Hill, who many may remember from Law and Order a few seasons ago.  The show improved with age but this is still to good to pass.  Enjoy this show if you watched in the day or if you were not around when it was on.  Look for lots of great guest stars, but watch for soon tightly wound suspenseful plots.  This is the original and still best.",1157500800,133,559,4.08256880733945
2645086,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Those of you somewhat familiar with this classic television series may note that the title of this review is different than they remember. That is because, in this, the first season, the head of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) was played by Steven Hill in the role of Dan Briggs, whereas in all the subsequent seasons, Peter Graves as Jim Phelps was the leader.  Hill gives a different flavor to the role, less physical but more cerebral.

This first season is also different than the following ones because like most series, the show was finding its bearings.  Whereas most adventure shows in the 1960's were expected to have a generous helping of car chases, fist fights and gun shootouts, MI creator Bruce Geller wanted a different type of show, one that is plot oriented (as opposed to ""action oriented"" or ""character oriented"") and which requires the viewer to pay attention and think as several different threads of the story which are occurring simultaneously are drawn together at the end.  Thus, we see in the first season some episodes do have the car chases and shootouts, and we do see some banter between the characters, but these things were quickly phased out as the show settled into its familiar, unique  format that lasted seven seasons, as the entire program focuses on the IMF's elaborate

plans to stop some evildoer.

My favorite episodes from this season are ""Operation Rogosz"" and ""The Frame"".  The first is a story unfortunately quite relevant to today, in which an international terrorist tries to release lethal bacteriological agents into the Los Angeles water supply.  The other is about a plan by the IMF to eliminate a powerful Mafia boss (note how the word ""mafia"" is never used for

""political correctness"" reasons, but rather ""the Syndicate"" or ""organized crime"") by making it seem that he was cheating on his partners in crime. Neither of these episodes have any ""action"" of the type I described above, but they are both riveting with outstanding acting and directing (director Leonard J Horn was particularly effective in ""Operation Rogosz"") and intricate stories.

I do have some reservations about certain premises of the show, for example, although I have no expectation about the stories being ""realistic"", I do find situations where an IMF team member (usually Rollin Hand played by Martin Landau) impersonates somebody by wearing a mask looking like that person to be beyond the realm of credibility.  Also, whereas in some episodes, the IMF is able to overthow dictatorial goverments, stop or prevent wars and the such, and so when their entire weight is used to stop one man (as in ""The Frame"") it sort of makes you feel sorry for the poor guy since he doesn't stand a chance against them (in later seasons, as a result of the unpopularity of America's war in Vietnam, it became ""politically incorrect"" for the IMF to interfere in foreign countries so most of the stories became modified forms of the IMF removing some Mafia figure and this became stale after a while).

This show has become a classic and will be remembered far into the future, just as Sherlock Holmes has.  I hope more seasons will be brought out in the future on DVD.",1157414400,60,3185,4.863216266173752
2645087,4,B000HWZ4HU,"I have been waiting for years for this series to come out on DVD. This show was to secret agents what CSI is to crime drama and House is to medical mystery. Granted, the plots are a lot more fantastic than what you might see today; but stylistically, there are vague similarities, such as storylines that are plot-driven as opposed to character driven. You know very little about the personal lives of the members of the IMF team, save that they are not above vicious and sometimes even brutal tactics to bring down their foes -- so much so that the viewing audience often felt sorry for the villain of the week because the IMF messed them over so badly. Granted, the dialogue is a bit stagy, but the series is still years ahead of its time. A word of warning to those expecting Peter Graves in this collection: His character, Jim Phelps, did not appear until the second season, brought in to replace first season lead Steven Hill; but since this is a plot driven show, chances are, you won't miss Phelps. Martin Landau as Rollin Hand more than makes up for his absence. Besides, the first season episodes are some of the best of the entire run. And the subject matter has suddenly become topical and current with all the world unrest today. Sometimes it's hard to believe the show is a product of the sixties. In the pilot episode, for example, the IMF has to stop an ""unfriendly foreign power"" from attaining a nuclear weapon(sound familiar?)and a dictator who bears an eerie passing appearance to Saddam Hussein (actually Martin Landau in heavy makeup). One wishes there were a real IMF today . . . P.S. Ethan Hunt doesn't appear ANYWHERE! And for those of you who have only been exposed to the Tom Cruise fare, I urge you to give the original series a try. Please, see what the first and the best Mission: Impossible is all about.",1157155200,70,1834,4.54380664652568

2645192,5,B000HWZ4HU,"This was a great start to a great series. While this is great for those who like mysteries and puzzles, and can devote a whole 55 minutes of attention, this series may not be for everyone. This is not the Mission:Impossible of the movies-- that franchise was not a reboot, but a name-stealer.

There is at least one puzzle in every show. While viewers know the general ""mission,"" they are only shown hints as to how it will be carried out at the start of each episode. Then, as the solution to that puzzle unfolds, the plot and suspense revolves around the completion of the mission. This series engages the brain and requires the viewer to think, unlike almost all the shlock on TV today, and much of it in the 1960's. There is very little action-- no car chases or gunfights. While there are cool inventions, deceptions, illusions and tricks, the closest thing to explosions that one can expect in most episodes is the iconic the self-destruction of the tape recording of the mission instructions.

Also, this is not a character-driven show. The show is pretty much all plot. The emotions or the private lives of the main characters are not a part of the normal episodes, and only a handful even imply that the characters have any life outside of the job.

Bruce Geller, the creative genius behind the series, oversaw the first few seasons with care, and it shows in the scripts and performances.
In this season, the format, the actors, and the writers were getting a feel for the series. While there are a few mis-steps, and a few episodes that seem padded (the two-parter, for example), the greatness of the Impossible Mission Force at Desilu in the mid-1960's and the amazingly talented cast are well on display.

Steven Hill, as Mr. Briggs, leads the team in the first season. While he is a fine actor, in the last few episodes of the season he does seem less engaged and more like he is going through the motions until his contract expires. Because he is seen less in many of the later episodes, the other cast members have greater opportunity to display their characters' roles in the team.

While I have watched all of the episodes at least once on DVD, it is great to have Amazon stream them, and certainly makes me feel like my Prime membership is worth it. Because Amazon has this, and Netf*** has dropped it, I dropped Netf*** and use Amazon streaming a lot more than ever.",1489363200,,2386,4.591549295774648

These are nice, clean copies of the show. What I watched  in reruns always looked so subdued and scratched.

I have had Prime and have used it just for items to purchase for free shipping.

I have laughed at people for binge watching.

I never thought ADHD had any advantages, but I guess it does, I love that I can put this on pause.
Forgive me, but I gave up on TV in 2001, I'm not a Luddite, I just read books more

The nerd in me loves all the outdoor locations--going on the tour at Universal--shows you many locations that were used.

I'm a total nerd for cars,
They had some weird wheels, trying to disguise Ford Cortinas from England to look like cars in the mysterious world of the Eastern European country thing that were never really mentioned clearly.

Do you know this was produced with Desilu producing? This showed the networks that Lucy & Ricky could punch out a great series and it paid off.

Then they got a wild hair to make this sci-fi series that they took a bath on. Star Trek.

Back to our mysterious country:
I also have fun with those sometimes improbable plots. That and the watching the bad guy slowly realising that he has been snookered.

If you compare this with  the M:I reboot, you do not get that this is what it was, talking abut the C old War in disguise.
Have fun--put on your Silva wraparounds, pour you a 'tini, make some rumaki and get hip.

Of course, singing the theme song is required.

An expert in rocket control working from behind the Iron Curtain was supposed to follow his wife in defecting to the U.S. a year earlier, but he was reluctant in leaving.

17 ""The Frame""

It is a combination of science and theatrics with the ""agents"" of the IM Forcd acting out the roles of others to achieve their goals of keeping the works at peace. There is very little actual killing. Looking at our programs today, one wonders how a show almost sixty years old can outpace and outmaneuver outstanding forces and keep the world at peace. There has never been a show like it before and probably never will again. Today violence is the byword; not cleverness or original thinking. They have fallen by the wayside.

She later was on Petticoat Junction to replace Aunt Kate when Aunt Kate died. There were 2 Tabitha's on Bewitched! Erin Murphy smiled while her sister didn't. There were 2 Gladys's. The first didn't work out. Dick York was on a Twilight Zone episode called 'A Penny For Your Thoughts'. Elizabeth Montgomery was on an episode called 'Two'. The lagoon on Gilligan's Island was a set! Mrs. Howell wore HER clothes. Mr. Howell was Mr. MaGoo. Gilligan's first name was Wiley. Skipper went around dressed as Skipper in real life!,1461369600,,686,4.677685950413223

2646439,5,B000HWZ4HU,My personal favorite episode was episode 9 A Spool there was (1966) I think this episode was made back in the days when wire was used as an audio recording medium. One of the IMF agents was sent to try to discover the spool. It was hidden in some (not going to say). The young handsome lad found it and the agents managed to recover it.,1450569600,,336,4.106060606060606

2646481,5,B000HWZ4HU,"I was delighted to see that all seven seasons of Mission Impossible were available to watch for free on Amazon Prime.  Starting from the beginning and working my way through every episode has been such fun.  The first thing to praise is Lalo Schifrin's theme music.  There have been quite a few popular TV themes over the years but the theme for Mission Impossible is, in my opinion, the best ever.  Then, of course, a lot of people don't remember that Dan Briggs was the first head of the Impossible Missions Force.  Unfortunately the behind the scenes melodrama with Steven Hill's work schedule demands ultimately got him replaced in Season 2, but I thought he was quite effective in the role of Mr. Briggs.  Martin Landau was not officially a cast member in the first season but finally committed to the role of Rollin Hand in Seasons 2 and 3.  Barbara Bain, Greg Morris and Peter Lupus were also great in their respective roles.  The premise of the show was highly innovative and it is still marvelous to watch how the IMF team, with the brilliant strategies of Mr. Briggs, was able to utilize the ""primitive"" technology of the time to outwit the bad guys.  The original Mission Impossible series might be a total bore to someone raised in our digital age, but for someone like me who actually owned a mini reel to reel tape player back in the day this series is a delightful blast from the past.  I guess all that's left to say is ""Good luck, Dan!  This tape will self destruct in 5 seconds . . . """,1449187200,7,1503,4.468864468864469

2646858,4,B000HWZ4HU,"It's been half a century since this show was new, but it's still among the best of its genre ever produced, and that includes today's attempts at spy/thriller shows on TV and cable. There was extraordinary outside-the-box writing and inventive solutions to seemingly insurmountable challenges faced by the IM Force, and week after week, it kept the audience at home more than satisfied. Sure, some of the sets and props were decidedly low-tech by today's standards, but they never depended on CGI simply because it didn't exist. It was a plot and character driven series that explored how protagonists and antagonists think - and predicting what they would do in situations that seemed to the viewers to be anything but predictable. I've always preferred Jim Phelps to Dan Briggs, but Steven Hill's single year at the helm of the IMF showed him to be a good actor and almost a natural in the role, had he continued. The great TV and movie character actors/actresses of the day (Albert Salmi, Albert Paulsen, Fritz Weaver) were frequent guest villains and no one ever turned in a bad or unworthy performance. I'd give the series as a whole five stars, but the first year - well, they were finding their way. That in no way diminishes the greatness of one of TV's best shows ever!",1443484800,2,1278,4.761261261261262

2646865,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Mission Impossible was the first ""grown up"" television series I was allowed to watch, and it made a huge impression. There was never really any sense that the series was ""finding itself"" through the first episodes. It seemed full realized from the pilot. I loved every moment and every episode, just some more than others.

Many people believe that the show finally gelled when Peter Graves stepped in to lead the team in Season 2. That is true in many ways, but I've always had a soft spot for Stephen Hill's Dan Briggs. His role was (by necessity - he placed some strict limitations on his rehearsal and performance times) much more that of a leader and delegator, not a participant. He frequently turns over the execution of the plan to his team, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Peter Graves will  be much more ""hands-on"" when he takes over leadership of the team. Watch the last few seconds of the pilot and you will see a white/gray-haired man pulling the team members to safety on their getaway plane. His face is never seen, so it isn't much of a stretch to imagine that Phelps was in fact there, all along, behind the scenes, learning the ropes and waiting for a promotion to team leader.

Some of the series' best episodes appear in the first season. Operation Rogosh is only the third episode, but it's both an absorbing drama and a promise of what will come. It introduces many of the bag of tricks that will be the team's stock in trade over the run of the series: memory gaps, replicated locations, leaving the antagonist to suffer retribution at the hands of his ""friends"" rather than the team. It's a brilliant psychological drama, and every team member gets a star turn. Greg Morris (as Barney) adopting a Caribbean accent and howling, ""I protest this whole COUNTRY, mon!"" is a delight. Martin Landau's little karate chop to his palm, promising that if Rogosh confesses there will be no more ""little...eh...massages"" is not menacing, rather he gives us a professional who does his job thoroughly and with competence. (Something more frightening in ways). Stephen Hill is the worst public defender in history, hunched, stammering, incompetent, and when he finally gets an excuse to slug Rogosh, he does it with such relish that the viewer can't contain a satisfied ""attaboy."" Even Peter Lupus rises to the occasion, although he was never there for his acting ability. Barbara Bain relies on acting not glamour in this episode, and she portrays the hysteria and paranoia of an ""innocent"" woman tortured by hypothetical interrogators superbly.

Season 1 is full of big and little moments. One of my favorites is from ""The Frame."" The evil (and slightly psychopathic) Syndicate leader ""accidently"" stumbles across her, clad only in a lacy teddy and silk stockings. She's all tearing eyes, trembling lips, and terrified vulnerability as she proceeds to twist him around her pinky finger. As he turns and leaves, she gives tosses her head and gives a little shoulder waggle and tiny smirk, as if to say, ""I'm GOOD. The poor schmuck doesn't have a prayer against me."" It's a delightful moment, one of those serendipitous marriages of writing and acting, that lasts two seconds at the most. It tells us more about Cinnamon Carter than any number of speeches or ""very special episodes."" It also features the under-appreciated Arthur Batanides who appeared so many times in so many different roles that not even IMDb lists them all.

Just as ""Rogosh"" employed many of MI's future tactics early in the season, ""The Train"" empties the bag entirely. It's one of their ""Big Moments"" special effects schemes, and one that will be used over and over again, (see for example, season Six's ""The Submarine.""). The villains are persuaded they are on a train headed across the Alps, and tricked into revealing their contempt for their leader and plans to establish a harsh dictatorship after his death. The poor (dying of heart disease) Prime Minister watches them discuss their plans, and limps away, saddened but wiser, comforted by the team.

There are several things that make this season, and the series for the first few years, nearly perfect television. The writing is brilliant and the performances spectacular. Production standards are consistently high  Some of the best episodes are now, sadly, somewhat dated, since they deal with the surviving remnants of WWII. There are a number of plots revolving around attempts to restore a Nazi reich, which 22 years after the war was not unrealistic. One of those episodes is ""The Legacy."" Briggs is shot in the chest at the end of the episode. If they had held it back and shown it at the end of the season, it might have given the producers just the excuse they needed to explain Peter Graves' elevation to team leader in Season 2. Ah well, if that's the worst carp I can come up with, clearly there's no more to say.",1443225600,3,4879,4.815035799522673

They are his marching orders and the the mystery begins. The opening title and score are excellent and the stories are mostly plausible and credible although some do push the envelope.

2646889,5,B000HWZ4HU,"This series is just an immense amount of fun.

We are on to Season 2 but about Season 1...
Mission Impossible, Season 1 is not the slick CGI/tech/special effects stuff they do now although as one who watched these when I came out, they sure seemed like sophisticated special effects then. Maybe I was too caught up in all that to see that what was going on was just very clever. Yes, one might chuckle here or there about dated stuff. Wait until you see the cell phone equivalents. But sit down and watch.

In each episode, we start out knowing that Mr. Briggs and his intrepid IMF Force [and we know the Secretary will not have his back!] have some bad guy to take care of. But we don't quite know how. We get hints--often with a bit of misdirection--and in the end the bad guy gets it in some surprising way. Those episodes must have been difficult to write given that the bad guy and the audience are subjected to misdirection. Many, many times my wife and I end up laughing as it all winds down.

Good fun. A bit dated but clever.

Many of the stars from those years show up. First one has Wally Cox in a not very good role but...Wally Cox. Most all of his early TV work apparently is lost. A comedy genius.",1443052800,,1211,4.252173913043478

2646935,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Superior in every way imaginable to what Paramount's done with the movies based on the series.  CGI and better digital audio recording doesn't make up for the lack of musicianship in the movie ST's and the acting, which is where the movies repeatedly fall down.  Get back to basics and (like they should with Star Trek-please stop improving it to death) stop trying to improve on the original.  Update the stories, fine.  Refine the dramaturgy, okay, that too.  But Paramount's never understood any successful franchise that they bought at Desilu's yard sale.  Get a clue.  Please.",1441670400,2,581,4.989583333333333

That's something that rarely happens when I watch similar dramas on TV today because I have pretty much have figured out the plot. The twists and turns on MI don't afford that opportunity, even though I know they are going to get the job done. I also see how some other series I have watched down through the years, notably Charlie's Angels, The A-Team and Burn Notice, ""borrowed"" from MI.

2647043,4,B000HWZ4HU,"Mission Impossible is one of those odd television shows that is still watchable almost 50 years later. The show was popular enough in its day to run for seven seasons. It also has one of the top television music themes conducted by Lalo Schifrin who did a variety of television and film work including films like Bullitt, Dirty Harry, and The Cincinnati Kid. The plot of the series follows the cold war themes of its times with espionage battles between the CIA and various nefarious communist, dictator regimes, and criminal organizations. The series, unlike many television series of today, offers a pro western outlook on the world. The objective is to thwart the evil intentions of regimes hostile to U.S. and free world interests around the world. Over the time the series ran single episodes offered a treatment of several of the culture issues of the sixties like; racism, drugs; the hippie culture, etc.
 For those who are new to the original television series, unlike the movies with Tom Cruise, the scenes flow along slowly. The emphasis is on the skills and ingenuity of each member of the IMF as they accomplish their individual tasks that are critical to the success of the mission. Another difference is violence. While the Tom Cruise movies offer spectacular violent action scenes, rarely is there gun play in the original television series. Instead of the shoot-em-up scenes endemic of today's Hollywood the IMF team is often placed in situations where quick thinking and cleverness is needed to complete a successful mission.
While the series lasted seven seasons the counter espionage emphasis and locations changed over those seasons. The early years offered locations primarily in foreign countries, but the later years saw a location change to mostly the U.S. The espionage emphasis also saw a change from cold war interests to national interests like drugs or counterfeiting. Also during the series the IMF team itself had changes. The early years offered Stephen Hill, Martin Landau, Barbara Bain, Greg Morris, and Peter Lupus. Morris and Lupus remained throughout its running, but Landau and Bain were replaced due to a dispute. Their replacements were Leonard Nimoy, Leslie Ann Warren, and Lynda Day George. Hill was replaced by Peter Graves after the first season. If you like this genre the original mission impossible is worth a look. A solid four stars for this classic series.",1440633600,,2406,5.0604534005037785

I must say that I do have a sense of nostalgia watching this show, having watched it as a child.  There are parts that seem to be superfluous, like when Briggs looks through photos as he thinks who he should include on the assignment as if he needs to have a visual reminder of his teammates (no doubt this is for the audience to foresee who will star in the episode).  Barbara Bain's gender stereotyped character plays the role of seductress spy, which could be a turn off to some today as she never (that I can recall) is engaged in much beyond looking pretty.  Well, anyway, taking into account the time this was recorded, I still love this show.",1440201600,,845,4.503267973856209

2647326,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Listen, do you hear that? No? That's because this show doesn't use many words. It's terrific; they really use an economy of dialogue and because everything isn't explained you are wondering all through the episode why they are doing certain things, then the end comes and all is revealed. One of the best theme songs ever written, musically it is brilliant and conveys the urgency, tension and exotic plots of the show.
Is the acting a bit stiff? Yes. Are the fight scenes not to be believed? Yes, but who doesn't LOVE a 1960's karate chop? ""This tape will self destruct in 5 seconds"" is not even in the episodes so far (I'm up to Season 1, ep. 18). they say everything but that. Funny.

Peter Graves (aka, 'the German spy' in the movie Stalag 17) a better fit as IMF leader.  As the seasons progressed, I lost interest as some of - if not all - of my favorite characters were replaced.

The acting ensemble was well-chosen and although Steven Hill didn't remain, he did a good job. I may be wrong, but I believe the lack of any substantial dialogue in an hour format show was something of a ground-breaker for television then; more shows today could definitely benefit by less dialogue and more plot.

Hill gives a different flavor to the role, less physical but more cerebral.

2647519,4,B000HWZ4HU,"It's too bad that television today seems to be more concerned with making a political statement or being ""hip and edgy"", rather than putting more effort into good writing. This series is a throwback to a time when intelligent stories-- as evidenced by the original Star Trek-- were rare, just as they are today, but were worth it when you can find them. You won't find any politically correct brooding about moral Equivalency, or condescending lectures about gay rights and protecting the environment here; just smart characters using their wits to defeat their adversaries.

At the time, it was extremely innovative: That collage that flashed at the beginning was a completely new idea. Plus, at the beginning the characters would go through the gadgets they were planning to use which also got up our curiosity. Not to forget the ""Good Morning Mr. Phelps"" and the recording would outline a situation/problem that the audience would wonder how in the world the team would ever pull off resolving. The Show was getting its feet wet, and finding its place. Steven Hill was a fine ""Mr Briggs"" tall, dark and handsome-and a fine actor.  I consider Miss Bain a Class Act, she brought something elegant to the show.  Her husband was also a terrific actor, he could, at times, give you the feeling that he was having fun.",1418256000,,819,4.489932885906041

The one thing that stood out for me is that Mr. Briggs seemed to have more of a personal relationship with his team members then Mr. Phelps did. I enjoy the storylines and the intricateness of it and it has some realistic aspects even for today. This is the sort of T.V. that really can't be remade without these people. I enjoyed their reliance on each other to accomplish the mission and the confidence that they had in each others skills. They don't question the others ability; and race or sex has no issues in it accept to complete the mission.

Despite being in the mid-60's, the threats are up to date---bioterrorism, nuclear terrorism, etc.  Martin Landau usually carries the show & quite well, in my opinion, esp. when off-screen wife has a substantial role in the cast.  It is cleverly plot-driven, even with different writers for episodes.
  I am sure to be getting the full set soon, since I missed most subsequent seasons away at this or that school.  My girlfriend of that era even thought I resembled Peter Graves!  :)",1386892800,,593,4.699029126213592
2647588,5,B000HWZ4HU,"With the possible exception of the first offering, the Mission Impossible opus in cinema has diminished the name brand: Mission Impossible.  The television series of the 1960's, which established the brand, had one of the finest casts ever assembled, along with taut fascinating plots, scripts, etc.  The pace was fast, the nuances intelligent, the action constant.

Martin Landau proved his bona fide's later with an Oscar, but on the show, with his wife in real life, Barbara Bain, he created a character who could manipulate people and situations like a magician.  With the 'spymaster' Stephen Hill, later Peter Graves, an electronics wizard (Greg Morris), a muscleman (Peter Lupus), and others, they took the challenge of bringing down dictators, crime bosses, etc.  They did it always with style and panache, too.

My only objection is this; they did not differentiate between domestic and international assignments.  They should have...It's one thing to bring down a 'bad guy' in the Czech Republic, but in the US, you cannot legally do anything approaching what they did...it's against the law (entrapment, the 4th amendment, etc.) and should be.  Entrapment, inadmissibility, they'd face it all when they, and not their 'target', were arraigned.

After I watched a few episodes as a Prime member, Amazon started charging for the episodes.

The gadgets, the social commentary, the political satire, the complex and elaborate missions were well written and current (to the 60s+). The music was outstanding (still is), the visual style and fresh camera work were outstanding. Certain elements remained static from show to show, which helped the show establish a feel the persists to this day. Much of the material has been mimicked and homaged through the years. This show established 'Espionage Thriller' as a genre in its own. The agent selection process provided a convenient way to cycle special guests in an out of the show without demanding a completely static cast.

2647619,5,B000HWZ4HU,"This remarkable program begins its run with Impossible Mission Forces team leader Dan Briggs (Steven Hill) given his mission - which he may or may not choose to accept - choosing team members model Cinnamon Carter (Barbara Bain), master of disguise Rollin Hand (Academy Award winner Martin Landau), electronics genius Barney Collier (Greg Morris) and strongman Willy Armitage (Peter Lupus). In this Pilot they are joined by safe-cracker Terry Targo (guest star Wally Cox, a brilliant casting choice) on their mission to remove two nuclear warheads controlled by anti-American dictator General Rio Dominguez from a time-lock hotel vault in fictional Santa Costa. The plan is to smuggle Willy inside the the vault with a re-breather to give him enough oxygen so that he can crack the code to allow the team to smuggle the weapons out of the vault. But when the team captures Dominguez as part of the plan, Terry's fingers are smashed and broken, preventing him from cracking the lock. The team must come up with an alternative plan, and it's a humdinger that tests the skills of every member of the team. This classic program holds the viewers' interest as much today as it did when the Pilot was originally broadcast on Saturday, Sept. 17, 1966. (Yes, Saturday! Saturday was the biggest night of the week for TV in 1966.) An interesting, clever, tense, drama with lots of twists and one of the greatest television casts ever assembled.

I am not sure that anyone under 40-50 is going to give this a whirl, simply, there is no nostalgia factor to get them to gravitate to it.

The Tom Cruise disguise masks still are not better than the original show decades earlier. Plots of the old show generally center around a third world country with a name like Serbosnistan, which is trying to obtain something dangerous like a nuclear device or germ.

My son compares it to watching an intricate puzzle unfold in front of you. That said, he loves the missions and some of the tricks the group uses to achieve it's aim. Some of the sets are a bit clunky and the special effects are minor by today's standards, but it's interesting to see the many scenarios in the shows still evident in today's world.",1364601600,,514,4.4787234042553195
2647669,5,B000HWZ4HU,the show is just as I remember and there's that great theme at the beginning.  Funny to see Steven Hill (DA Adam Schiff from Law & Order) as the 1st Mr. Briggs before Peter Graves joined as Mr. Phelps. and crazy how little dialog there actually is on these shows.  Action in the 60s so different from today,1364515200,,306,4.258620689655173
2647670,5,B000HWZ4HU,"This is a great series, without special effects or any kind of animation the plots are well thought out.  There are some heroics but most of the excitement and suspense comes from brain power - good plans and clever tools.  I watched this series in the 60s and thought I would watch it for ""old time's sake"" but have found it to be as good as I thought it was back then.  In addition, the filming is good unlike some of the older series.  I intend to watch all of the episodes since I remember very few of them from the old days.  In fact, I didn't even know there was another head of the IM force before Mr. Phelps!  I know those older than 50 or so will enjoy watching the show but I think even younger people will enjoy it.

Lots of make up usage.  Physical strength as well as usage of machinery.  GoGood looking actors involved also.  Recommended if you like suspense.,1362441600,,314,4.15

2647683,4,B000HWZ4HU,"Although the episodes are not all of the same quality, this is thoroughly enjoyable. Steven Hill as Dan Briggs is a far better, more nuanced actor than Peter Graves as Jim Phelps - there's always a touch of humour, the atmosphere between the members of the team is much more casual and relaxed (which does not take away anything from the tension in the plot) than in later seasons. It's Mission Impossible less as a ""tv success machine"" than as a human adventure. And the 3 minute ""Good morning, Mr. Briggs..."" opening, when Dan retrieves the tape recording that details the task he must accomplish, is each time a little creative wonder.",1360972800,,638,4.705357142857143

2647697,5,B000HWZ4HU,"I bought this set awhile back and am only now watching the first season -- and I love it! Love how the actors, all new to their characters, are a bit more loose and fun then they would eventually become in the 2nd season on. In this first season there is even a hint of romance between Rollin Hand and Cinnamon Carter -- very nice since they are played by actors who were actually married! Favorite episodes inclued ""A Spool There Was"", ""The Carriers"" and ""Wheels"" --  and Barbara Bain truly deserved her 1st ever Emmy Award. And I also enjoyed Steven Hill as Daniel Briggs.

To my disappointment, the show didn't match the intensity of my affection, which led to my acceptance of a couple of obvious facts.  Vintage TV series were manufactured by studios like a factory produces widgets.  To meet rapid shooting schedules and tight budgets, production values were often stinted, especially in effects-driven shows like this.  If you take into account your entertainment options at the time -- only THREE networks -- a studio could get away with some pretty clunky results.  This show was no exception.

The first thing I noted was that the intricate and elegant planning that was the hallmark of the stories was missing from almost the entire first season.  Not until the last few episodes did it begin to hit its stride, to exploit what really made it clever.  During the best episodes, the audience witnesses a member of the crew performing solo some puzzling task in the course of IMF's meticulously interwoven subterfuge, the purpose for which would be revealed only later for a wonderfully satisfying ah-ha moment.  Those pleasures were absent for most of these early episodes, about two-thirds of them.  The writing was lazy and perfunctory, fobbing off a fight scene as an action sequence, which lacked real tension and misdirected focus from the foremost appeal of the show.  Many episodes included a karate chop to the neck as a quick remedy for many contingencies.  All of the shortcomings of pop-culture 60s television were featured in ample supply here, all backlot and soundstage, and it just didn't work for me at this point.  I admit to having some fun, but without a nostalgic component to transmute the experience, there's nothing a newer generation can appreciate; not as adults, anyway.  That it did by the end of the season come closer to the series I remembered wasn't enough to balance my heavier disappointment, and I wasn't so eager to jump for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-I-s-second-season/dp/B000NOIX66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M:I's second season</a>.  I will eventually go on ahead and buy it, because it was pretty good when it was at its best.  But I'm not in a hurry.

As for the DVD set itself, it's been remastered with 5.1 sound and a picture that's sparkling bright and clean.  I can honestly say you've never seen or heard it like this.  Amazing, really.  The packaging for the 7-disc set is equally as classy, a glossy slipcase containing four plastic inner sleeves with two discs in each, with a final disc to itself.  The episodes are arranged chronologically according to the original air dates, precisely documented.  Unfortunately, there's not a single special feature included on any of the discs.  Not one.

That omission is not a big deal really, not when you take into account THIS: Barbara Bain.  Man, I always thought she was one sultry, smoky beauty, in the classic mold.  But even in that superlative estimation, she was better than I remembered.  I just can't get over how stunningly beautiful she really was.  It's mesmerizing.

2647718,5,B000HWZ4HU,"With all respects to Peter Graves, the first season of Mission:Impossible (with Steven Hill in the lead,) was the best season ever for this classic series.  The Pilot episode was, and still is, one of the best pilots I have ever seen.  I really cannot think of one truly inferior episode the entire season.  ""The Train"" episode remains one of my favorites, a truly fascinating episode.
As the season wore on Hill appeared less and less due to his inability as an Orthodox Jew to work on Saturday and Jewish holidays.  He was replaced by Graves in season two.  Despite this however, season 1 of Mission: Impossible is truly its best.
Like so many other classic series released by CBS/Paramount, there are no extras on this set despite the entire cast, with the exception of Greg Morris, still being with us.

My favorite episode is where they made this guy believe there'd been a nuclear holocaust, that he was in a bomb shelter and it was the future. Doing that they made him tell them the details of where to find something to prevent disaster. He tells them and then at the end he makes his way out of the little submarine he'd been in as they drive away and he has this perplexed look on his face. THAT is classic Mission Impossible.

  This show was about thinking. I wish the movies would at least try to recreate this. And the outrageous idea that Jim Phelps was a traitor (in the 1996 movie) was such sacrilege that it makes you want to march to Paramount Pictures holding pitchforks and torches!",1220140800,,885,4.411042944785276
2647726,5,B000HWZ4HU,"I'm a really big fan of the first season of MI especially because of Steven Hill's portrayal of Dan Briggs. The series was just starting out and it tended to have greatly varied plots during the first season which made it exciting to watch. Dan Briggs seemed to be the perfect character to lead the IMF and I was not sure why he was replaced by Peter Graves until I read the write-up on his religious background. His no-nonsense approach was just what you would expect of someone in his position and he also had the added benefit of not being as well known as Peter Graves at the time, anonimity being a necessary part of undercover activities, which made him seem all the more real. I don't mean to demean Mr. Graves' contributions to the series...he was there for the remainder of its successful run; however, I often wonder what the show's personality would have been if Steven had continued on. As with all other reviewers I believe this was a great series and am happy that it is being released.

CBS has done an excellent job in restoring each episode and they look as pristine as when the show premiered in 1966. Clever and thoughtful, Mission Impossible was considered one of the elite shows of its day (along with I Spy and Ironside). The episodes were well plotted and a relief from the gun toting spy shows that populated the air waves during the James Bond mania of the era. The show made Martin Landau, Barbara Bain and Greg Morris household names and international stars.  Unfortunately, the fine actor Steven Hill (Dan Briggs) became a footnote in the history of the show--leaving after the first year. What is not well known was the reason why----as a devout Orthodox Jew, Steven could not and would not work after sundown on Fridays. And with the typical brutal filming schedules required of episode TV, it cause work delays.

2647733,4,B000HWZ4HU,"To the tune of composer Lalo Schifrin's pulse pounding theme, Bruce Geller's Mission Impossible came to TV in 1966 at the height of the `spy craze', with a deadly serious take on international espionage, Mission was all about deception, and the precise execution of the most elaborate of schemes, by a specialized team of operatives employed by the US government to accomplish policy aims.

Overall, the stories hold together pretty well.  While not always credible, they are still exciting, entertaining, and full of suspense.  There is wide variety in the types of missions, the locations, and the methods used to complete them.  Sometimes subtle manipulation was required, other times a bold dramatic approach, or a smooth sophisticated con job.  Missions often featured the use of technology, both real and fictional.  Cool mechanical devices or gadgets, were often integral to success.  They may not have invented it, but the series' writers certainly popularized the rather unrealistic technique of the rubber mask impersonation, which became a trademark of the series.  Mostly they played fair, but at times the writers did cheat a bit, especially at the endings when things are not tied up neatly, or by making the escapes too easy.  Getting everything done in just an hour was sometimes a challenge, so the occasional sloppiness is understandable.

With one exception, the cast was very strong, and worked together well.  Though a capable enough actor, Steven Hill seemed rather stiff and lacking charisma, as Dan Briggs, the leader of the IMF.  Hill had a reputation for being difficult, and his religion placed restrictions on his availability for work.  After a strong a prominent start, Briggs fades away to just being a setup man for the missions, after problems arose between Hill and the producers.  He practically disappears in some of the later episodes.

Real life husband and wife, Martin Landau as Rollin Hand, and Barbara Bain as Cinnamon Carter are the true stars of the program.  Both smoothly assume the many diverse roles required of them.  Hand was an expert at physical impersonation, and was often the point man for the mission.  Landau apparent had reservations about committing to the series, and so he was not listed as one of the regular cast, and instead was credited as making `special guest appearances' in each episode.  Ms. Bain brought so much class, elegance and acting talent to the screen as Cinnamon Carter, that she won the Emmy for best actress in a dramatic series, for each of the three years she was on MI.  You could count on Cinnamon to add `spice' to the proceedings.

Greg Morris brought class and dignity to the proceedings, as the low-key electronics expert Barney Collier.  Barney could handle any situation, was icy cool under pressure, and always had your back.  Likeable bodybuilder turned actor, Peter Lupus is rock steady as operative Willy Armitage.  Willy seems to have more to do in this season than he would in later years.  In some of the later episodes, he probably has as much screen time as Steven Hill!

Although there were some creative bumps, the style and the level of quality was firmly established in this first season.  The producers replaced Steven Hill with Peter Graves for the second season.  A move which most fans would probably agree was a positive one, as the show increased in popularity with Graves aboard.  After Mission, Hill apparently gave up acting for a time, but later returned to prime time on Law and Order in the 1980's.",1201910400,4,3515,4.970890410958904
2647734,4,B000HWZ4HU,"The year was 1966. The Cold War was heating up and the Spy Craze was becoming a global phenomenon. Thanks in large part to the James Bond feature films starring Sean Connery and hit tv shows like ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E"", ""I Spy"", ""The Wild Wild West"" & ""The Avengers"". Not surprisingly, another take on the spy genre was about to be unveiled.

Created by Bruce Geller, ""Mission: Impossible"" would follow the exploits of a top-secret team of highly trained spies who weekly assignments took them all over the world fighting the forces of evil, wherever it lay. Geller was keen to emphasise the nail-biting situations his characters would often find themselves in and how they would achieve ""the impossible"".

From this, he would structure a simple but effective format. The beginning of each episode would commence with the show's team leader arriving at various different locales to receive his assignment in the form of tape players, reels of film, vinyl recordings, projection screens etc. An anonymous voice would greet him and outline what his pending mission would involve. At the end, the voice would offer the man the option to accept the assignment (which of course, he always did!) and would then shortly thereafter self-destruct either by a puff of smoke or by other means.

The action would then shift back to the team leader's apartment where he would sift through a dossier that contained the profiles of a number of agents. From there, he would hand pick his team. Afterwards a briefing scene would unfold with snippets of the assignment being discussed amongst the team and what steps would be implemented during the mission. Then it was straight into the thick of the action.

Unlike some of it contemporaries such as ""U.N.C.L.E"" & ""Wild Wild West"" which relied on strong doses of humour and over-the-top scenarios, Bruce Geller was determine to kept things understated. Character development was kept to a minimum (you never really knew about the personal lives of the show's characters since you almost always saw them in a professional capacity - and more often than not, they were undercover playing other people). Electronic devices and gadgetry which was to become a staple within the series were used as realistically as possible.

Casting was underway and eventually, the show's line-up was selected. Steven Hill was chosen to play the role of Dan Briggs, head of the IMF team. Briggs was an enigma. Low-key in demeanour and tone, he was a thinker who allowed others to play a central role in the plans that he created. Smart and decisive, he generally never allowed himself to become too emotionally involved with his fellow team members and often kept his distance - even sometimes not participating in the assignment altogether.

Barbara Bain (in a role that would ultimately see her win her three consecutive Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series) was selected to play the part of Cinnamon Carter - the bright and attractive female member of the team who would often use her feminine charms and wiles to lure unsuspecting targets off-balance. Smart and capable, Cinnamon was more than just a pretty face. Greg Morris was chosen to play electronics expert Barney Collier. Second behind Bill Cosby on ""I Spy"", Morris was able to blend seamlessly into the show at a time when African-American actors were seldom seen on television. Intelligent and quick-thinking, Barney proved to be an invaluable member of the IMF team. Former competitive body-builder Peter Lupus rounded out the show's cast when he was signed on to play Willy Armitage, the team's strongman who also provided the muscle when the group got themselves into a spot of bother.

Bruce Geller also made the decision to cast Martin Landau (who was married to Barbara Bain at the time) in the capacity of a ""guest-star"" during the show's first season, to play the character of Rollin Hand - the team's master of disguise. Rollin was able to take on the look of anyone he was impersonating (due to the masks that he would create - another Mission staple) as well as replicating their voice as well. Landau was an inspired choice and would soon proved to be a major player in the show's success eventually becoming a regular cast member from season two onwards.

The first season is an interesting mix of stories that runs a wide gambit. From undermining dictatorships (""Pilot"", ""Odds on Evil"", ""& ""The Diamond""), to taking down American gangsters (""The Ransom"" & ""The Frame) to tackling schemes regarding the Nazi's return to power (""The Legacy"" & ""The Legend""). Still trying to establish its own identity, many of these episodes are infused with moments of personal interaction amongst the team - something that would be scaled back as the series progressed.

Right from the outset, ""Mission: Impossible"" established it's unique indenity on the television landscape. With strong story-telling, solid production values, tight editing and of course one of the greatest theme songs ever created - courtesy of Lalo Schifrin - the series would eventually finds it's place in pop culture. The first season is an interesting and enjoyable romp worth checking out. The series would undergo a major casting change by the time it returned for it's second season and aspects of the show's format would be refined and honed as well.

2647735,4,B000HWZ4HU,"This first season of the T.V. classic is a delightful mix of the cynical  and the quaint.  Each episode opens with Dan Briggs being told that should his mission fail, the government that sent him out on it will happiliy lie to cover up their actions.  These instructions are familiar to everyone now, but taken in the context of the times they're pretty jaded and cold.  In the next scene Dan feeds his fish tank and selects that week's agents -- by sorting through their headshots, carnival bills and what look like dinner theater programs!  It's really silly and terrific.

The shows vary in quality and a couple are a little dull, but by and large they're entertaining and have been crisply restored.  It's funny to watch a pre-craggy Stephen Hill as the team's mastermind. (Funnier still to watch him romance the gorgeous Mary Ann Mobley.)  You can watch his famed retreat from the show's center stage about 5 shows in when he can't take on missions because the parties involved would recognize him.  This sets the stage for what makes the show most watchable (besides television's best theme song) and that's Martin Landau as Rollin Hand.  Not the 60's most suave spy, but his edgy -- sometimes a little goofy -- perfomances enliven even the dullest capers.  He's absolutely great.

And don't forget to play the M:I drinking game!  Empty your glass everytime Peter Lupus has a line.  You'll be mildly buzzed after 3 shows.",1199577600,2,1427,4.747967479674797
2647736,2,B000HWZ4HU,"When I found out that Mission: Impossible, the TV series, was being released I was ecstatic. It was one of my all-time favorite shows. But, as a child, I didn't want to watch it. My Mom was hooked on it & didn't understand why I wouldn't give it a chance. Finally, she forced me to sit down to watch it one evening. I was hooked!

So, I purchased this with great anticipation of watching this goldie oldie. I was disappointed. The producers were still trying to find their angle so they weren't sure which direction to take. The gadgetry that MI was so famous for didn't star occuring until the second half of season 1. In fact, I found the first half of it to be SLOW, especially the two part episode of the team performing as a circus act in an Eastern Bloc country. That two-parter was so padded out with filler as to be an insult to my intelligence.

All the famous parts of Mission: Impossible were already in place, such as the opening introduction of the mission & the selection process of agents to be used. Steven Hill, the original team leader, is only in season 1 & it's easy to understand why he was replaced by Peter Graves in the following seasons. MR. Hill was too stiff & limited as an actor to be the dynamic leader of a crack team of infiltrators. In later episodes he would be gradually phased into a restricted role, not actually taking part in the mission; in fact, in one episode, Cinnamon (Barbara Bain), performed the opening sequences including the selection of agents.

Viewer beware, season 1 is a weak effort compared, especially, to the next two seasons. I would only buy the season 1 set just to be a completist.",1196899200,31,1642,4.4485049833887045

Most of all, it's about setting up a situation using visuals and crisp dialog, then pulling you into the suspense for the final payoff.

As you can guess, I really love this Sixties TV classic. And I couldn't wait to show it to my son, who is just 10 years old.  I worried a bit that he'd be turned off by the production values (great for TV but meager compared to mainstream movies shot these days) or to the gradual development of the story.  I had nothing to worry about.  He loved it from the get go, and this summer we practically watched one episode every night for two weeks.  It was a great opportunity to pause the DVD at times to give him some background into what the Cold War was all about, what the Third Reich meant, how card games are played (as in some of the fixed game scenarios), and other relevent topics. His two favorite characters are Rollin and Barney.  He's always trying to predict what Rollin is going to do, who he's going to impersonate, or how he's going to use slight-of-hand to trick someone.  And Barney fascinates him because--like a prototype for McGiver--he's always able to quickly fabricate something when the force's plans go wrong.

Other reviewers have given eloquent descriptions of this first year's episodes, so let me just say, buy it, enjoy it, and watch it instead of reality, crime scene investigation, or talent shows.  I guarantee you'll not be sorry.",1187654400,5,1905,4.722054380664653
2647742,5,B000HWZ4HU,"In the mid-1960's Paramount Studio produced the best ever classic series called MISSION IMPOSSIBLE which included Mr. Peter Graves, Greg Moris, Martin Landau and the sexy Barbara Bains. This is the  best classic TV miniseries which come out of Hollywood. I recall that my family used to watch the TV movie every Saturday evening around 10 p.m. The outside traffic on such a busy weekend would come to a standstill as everyone was glued to his or her set.
Reportedly, even business and political affairs were put on whole until the hour-long show was over. However, in those days, we didn't have color television and would content with watching the show in mere black-and-white.

Now that I and many enthusisastic  fans of Mission Impossible 1960s have bought the Season 1 & Season 2
series, on their behalf, may I urge Amazon to make Season 3 & Season 4 available. I understand that Mission Impossible which begins in 1966 to 1973 have 7 season series altogether. Let's hope these are gradually made available to all of us - fans. Thanks.",1186444800,5,1038,4.787709497206704

And since I was born in the 80's, that's not even a time I remember.  Nevertheless, I've enjoyed these DVDs and I think you will too if you like smart TV or just espionage-thrillers in general.

So when Amazon had this set available I bought it and was not disappointed.  I keep watching the episodes over and over, and I'm 63 now!  The quality is excellent, and the content has more twists and turns than a corkscrew.  This, along with the original Star Trek, shows what the TV medium is really capable of.  My mom told me that she had to stop watching MI because she was always at the edge of her seat and it made her ""nervous""! The movies with Tom Cruise are pale imitations.  This is more clever and intellectual and doesn't have to use explosive special effects to entertain. The acting is excellent;  Steven Hill (Dan Briggs) went on to play Adam Schiff in ""Law and Order"" many years later.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy the set.

2647778,4,B000HWZ4HU,"I mentioned in another review that while it is nice Paramount Video is releasing many treasured classic products from their libraries, it is somewhat disappointing they do not show a tendency to completely satisfy fans and neglect the detailed extras I believe could add so much enjoyment. They have continued this pattern with the ""Mission Impossible-Season 1.""  Technically, the job is handled well. However, there are no extras.

In the first season, we have the ""business-like"" Steven Hill leading the team with more of an authoritarian style as compared to the somewhat ""father-like"" style Peter Graves displayed beginning in season two.  The transfers look and play just fine.  Of course, the James Bond inspired plots are dated and the so called ""foreign country"" locales look way more domesticated than I remember as a kid but overall, the storytelling still stands out.

I believe you will enjoy this show better if you can remember the times as they were back then.  In my judgment, the memory of the Cold War tension makes the show seem a bit more unsettling and riveting. To a younger viewer, it will be little more than escapist entertainment.  Funny, there were a few ""new"" things I noticed after all these years. First, my memory was that the show took itself very seriously.  However, now I notice snippets of dialog that prove the writers were capable of having some fun. Also, though television shows of the 60's were beginning to portray women as more than the wholesome and dutiful wives the 50's sitcoms etched in our minds, it is almost too extreme how Barbara Bain's only contribution to a mission seemed to be getting the bad guys aroused (In the pilot episode, Martin Landau's character even hints that the best use of his free time alone with her would be a quick roll in the sack). Of course, I imagine most male viewers weren't protesting. Finally, all those years ago, I never paid much attention to the irony that Rollin Hand (Martin Laundau) always bore an amazing resemblance to each person he was going to disguise himself as(ha, ha).

My only complaint, as mentioned earlier, is the lack of extras. Several of the stars are still with us. What about some interviews?  This show ran for seven years. How about some sort of history?  And get this - we don't even get the original air dates of the episodes listed!  All we get is a note saying the episodes are in order.  Maybe it is just me expecting too much.  I just hate this ""let's not pay anyone we don't have to in order squeeze every penny of profit"" policy that Paramount seems to be displaying.  Come on Paramount, we live in an information age. Would it hurt to give us some?",1174867200,3,2667,4.705376344086021
2647779,5,B000HWZ4HU,"I received my dvd set before my international trip & truly enjoyed delving back into the IMF team cases back-to-back. Intricate plots, the teams chemistry, & the pacing is still a wonder. I truly miss when TV used intrigue & brains to entertain--before the days ""reality TV"" dumbed TV down--MI remains not for the dumbed down! A CLASSIC!!!",1174780800,2,339,4.862068965517241
2647780,4,B000HWZ4HU,"I religiously watched Mission Impossible as a kid in the 60's. Some of the special effects, disguises, etc. today now look somewhat hokey, but back in the 60's this show was cutting edge television. And besides, unlike so many TV shows and movies today, it was the plot that mattered, not the special effects. I was sorry then to see Martin Landau and Barbara Bain leave the show after the third season, and although without those two the show was never quite the same, it still continued to be great TV.

Even today many of the story lines would still be valid, such as the IM Force attempting to stop the bad guys from a biological warfare attack (The Carriers). And unlike then, now I can back up the parts that were complicated!

The picture and sound quality is excellent (needless to say the MI theme song is still a classic), bottom line is this is everything I expected it to be. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are no special features, such as interviews with surviving cast members, that would have been great. Hopefully with the upcoming release of Season 2 there will be extra features. I know one thing, I'm not a big collector of DVD's, but I definitely plan to buy each and every MI season as soon as they are released!",1174694400,3,1269,4.44206008583691

2647782,4,B000HWZ4HU,"Perhaps my review is just one of many singing the praise of this set of DVDs. I had not seen an episode of this series in many years, and had forgotten many of the episodes from Season One, so going back and watching these programs was a real treat.

Mission: Impossible first came to television in 1966. As anyone familiar with the time period knows, this was the vintage season of heroic spy entertainment in the movies and on TV. James Bond, of course, was wildly popular, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. had a huge number of fans. Mission: Impossible, although arriving soon after those famous spies, was quite different. It focused on plot, subterfuge, chicanery, and disguise. Season One introduced us to these elements, and does so superbly in the pilot episode.

I have not viewed each and every episode yet, but it appears to me that the writers and cast were trying to find their way. At times, it almost looks as if they want to ""go James Bond,"" in shootouts, fistfights, etc., but fortunately, most of the time, they resort to actions reflecting brain power. The real strength of the show is the plan of deception they serve so well to their  nasty adversaries.

Steven Hill, the original star of the series, is exceptionally good. He looks, and sound like what we would imagine to be a real U.S. Government covert agent. His style, unlike that of his successor, Peter Graves, is quite different. He reminds me of someone who will snap, and kill an adversary in a heartbeat. He communicates daring, and deadliness while preferring to outsmart the devils. My only complaint about him as leader is his number of absences from episodes. True, he introduces each story, but it is a shame that he did not appear completely throughout more of them.

Other performers in this first season are great. I believe that Martin Landau and Barbara Bain are practically flawless. One episode in particular features Landau as a Bacarat expert, and he could have give Sean Connery a run for his money! As for Barbara Bain, I was finding myself falling for her easily. Seldom has there been such a seductive woman on the screen. Greg Morris as Barney was incredible. He came across as one of the most brilliant people in the history of television. I really wish the C.I.A. did have someone to equal his talents!!!

My one criticism of the collection: why aren't there interviews with surviving cast members? I would have loved to heard what Steven Hill, Barbara Bain, and Martin Landau had to say about the show four decades later. I can only hope that there will be interviews with cast members in future box sets released.

I also look forward to successive seasons of this program coming out on DVD. Peter Graves took over as IMF leader beginning in Season Two. I have always been a fan of Peter Graves who always gave a terrific performance in any role (yes, he did a great deal more than the Geico ad, or the sicko-pilot in Airplane).

A suggestion to anyone wanting to see one of the most entertaining, and original programs in the history of televion? Buy Mission: Impossible. These TV shows are not only vastly superior to the garbage that Tom Cruise put in his movies, but much better than nearly every other adventure show on television. This was one of the best ever.",1173744000,3,3268,4.661458333333333

2647784,3,B000HWZ4HU,"Read the description very closely. In the ""Plot Summary"" it mentions Jim Phelps, so I was expecting the Peter Graves team, but now realize he was not on the series till the 2nd season. It's not till you get to the Editorial Reviews much further down the page that you see who's really in this series. Amazon needs to change that because it is misleading.  Other than that, the series is just okay.  I would not have bought it had I known it wasn't with Jim Phelps, but oh well.  I'll probably buy the 2nd season because that is what I really wanted. Steven Hill is not nearly as interesting in the lead role as Dan Briggs.  The chemistry just isn't there as it was with Peter Graves' portrayal of Jim Phelps.  Maybe that's why we never saw Steven Hill again after that 1st season?

2647798,5,B000HWZ4HU,"While Barbara Bain and Martin Landau dominated the first three seasons, the first year of M:I really belongs to Steven Hill.  Steven was the perfect actor to portray Dan Briggs - cool, unemotional, with enough cunning, mystery and passion in his eyes to let you believe he could pull off the impossible.  His distance (real or imagioned) from his agents, coupled with the few human touches we were allowed to see set the tone for all future spy series.  First year Mission was so far superior to the next two years (and thereafter ceased to exist for all practical purposes) that it remains the one truly great series, not only of its era, but for all time.  Mission set the standard, created the rules, developed the suspense of action- rather than character-based series.  While the writing was its crowning achievement, the acting will never be equalled, particularily first season.  Somehow, after Hill left, the series lost its cutting edge and when Bain and Landau were dismissed, CBS lost everything but the name.

Little did I know then that Peter Graves was preceded by Steven Hill (Briggs).  I thought that Steven Hill did a commendable job as the head of his team of infiltrators.

Though the DVDs themselves do not have built-in closed-captioning for the hearing-impaired (of which I am), although one of the TV's in my home adapted to it, just watching the players perform their duties is good enough for me.

I must add that if one is hearing-impaired and wishes to play the series on a portable DVD player, then it useless because of the lack of subtitles on the DVDs.

Like any other first season of a TV drama, MI is trying to find it's niche, by the end of the discs, you can see they have a winning formula down, and by the 2nd season it just gets better. Peter Graves is not in the first season, but is so associated with the series, that many people might be suprised. Steven Hill does an okay job as Briggs the IMF leader. Viewers who know the shows behind the scenes history, you know how difficult he was to work with at the times, and why he was written out, and eventually replaced with Graves. I wish there had been some extras...something, interviews..but there is not. Still it was an amazing show for it's time and still a joy to watch.

The show of course has a sixties look and feel to it but the plots are just as ellaborative and at times it's like watching a lo-tech james bond movie.  Martin Landau when he was young at that age was a great actor, so was greg morris, he was always the guy rigging the devices, barbara baine had an interesting role as well but I must say I like Rollin Hand the best.

Each Saturday night, following ""The Jackie Gleason Show"", I looked forward to wanting more ""Mission: Impossible"".  Not only was the acting superb, but the writing was spectacular.  My only disappointment on this series was when the second season arrived, CBS decided to move the show from 8:30, Saturdays to 10:00, Sundays (where it remained for the next 3 seasons).

Several of these episodes, first broadcast on Saturday nights on CBS in the 1966-67 season, are first-rate examples of the ""Mission"" formula: complex plots, gadgets, sexual double-cross, disguises, and long, intricate sequences with no dialogue as the mission is carried out with spit-second timing and the bad guy is left wondering what hit him.  The leader of the team in season 1 is Dan Briggs, played low-key by Steven Hill (the DA for the first nine years of ""Law & Order""), replaced in season 2 by Peter Graves' Jim Phelps.  Over the course of the first season, Barbara Bain, playing Cinnamon Carter (a ""space-age Mata Hari,"" according to Look Magazine at the time), becomes a star before your eyes.  Her charisma and that of then-husband Martin Landau made major contributions to the series' impact, even though they appeared only in the first three (of seven) seasons.  These first 28 shows include some clinkers as the series finds its footing, but a handful of these episodes are ""M:I"" classics, illustrating why this series became a major hit forty years ago.",1168819200,3,1207,5.045226130653266

2647864,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Mission Impossible:

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

Mission was a program unique to it's era and should be viewed in that context.  It was, of course, the James Bond era, but it was also the ear of the cold war, where enemies, foreign and domestic were somehow lucking everywhere and our mission, should we decide to accept it, was to intercede and prevent the downfall of civilizations.

In viewing the episodes on this collection, I discovered, again, that Mission was really in its way, the first ensemble TV shows. In the first episodes, jointing the cast members of Stephen Hill, Barbara Bain, Gregg Morris and Peter Lupus, would be several guest stars, each with unique skills to help the mission. The mission, famously, was given by a mysterious voice on a series of interesting devices, not all tape recorders then.  This allowed the plot to start quickly, bypassing the James Bond speaks to M stage of the drama.

In the first episodes were are clearly told what the mission was and what the goals were.  Almost always something went wrong and a ""new"" mission had to be developed to pull their rears out of the fire. This also made the show seem more like an anthology program because each week the stars and the new quest star played new roles in new circumstances. Eventually the shows become a mystery when Dr Briggs does not tell the viewer exactly what his goals are.  You sit there and wonder, ""what the heck are they doing?"" While the show was always written well, it shows signs of brilliance the first season.  For example, in one episode, Martin Landau must find a important tape recorder that an agent had hidden while being chased by the bad guys. They do it by putting him into the same, terrible situation.  Really smart. And while they may be looking for that formula for episodes yet to come, it is not here

Of course, in the first season Martin Landau becomes a regular, and the use of gust stars goes down.  But Greg Morris also expands his presence and becomes one of the signatures of the series. I had forgotten just how perfect he was in this role.

And the music of course is outstanding, this show set the example for series yet to come.

The Bad:

Not quite overwhelming yet are the electronic devices that will take over the show and the constant face masks that change a person height, weight, body structure and voice making the episode hard to believe. The agents rely on each other and well as themselves and their acting convinces you.  The plot sometimes also rely on unbelievable circumstances.  In one episode, Martin Landau using slight of hand to get lockmithing tools within a prison when he was being taken prisoner.  That sort of thing takes you out of the reality.

The Ugly:

 A lone voice on a recorder game them instructions to have people killed, both in and out of the U.S. No trial, no evidence. That's right, these people are often assassins. They also topple small governments in their spare time. Usually they just set up people to be killed but they shoot people on their way out!  In one episode, ""The Diamond"" they blow up the leader of a country, steal his diamond and kill a few guards on the way out.

Finally, while they may be looking for that formula for episodes yet to come, it is not here yet and the action, the writing, the music and the sets almost make in a mini movie. If you can get past the ugly, that's not bad for 1966.",1168214400,5,3401,4.521241830065359
2647865,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Forget what Tom Cruise did to the Mission: Impossible movies, while they were fun and interesting to watch as their own movies, they were not the Mission: Impossible of old. For years, I have been forced to watch the same cycle of episodes on VHS put out by Paramount Home Video in 2000, while they were the original cut episoded, they were limited to those handfull of episodes.

But now they are finally able to bring back the original episodes for those who were not able to watch the original episodes in their entirity after Paramount showing Cruise where the door was and aparantly locking it behind him (at least that's what the rumor is).

These are the original episodes from the original season. Dan Briggs (instead of the later & more popular Jim Phelps) leads the team.  Intricate plotting, sophisticated derring-do, elaborate masquerades and exotic locales, is an exempolary description of the series in general.",1168128000,10,925,4.916666666666667
2647866,4,B000HWZ4HU,"For the series itself, Season 1 is markedly different.  The team is led by Briggs, not Phelps, and Steven Hill isn't the best actor for the role.  The team fragments more often than in other seasons.  There's more banter and witty dialogue among the team members.  The mission isn't always delivered on a tape that will self-destruct, and it's presented in multifarious ways; one time it's even just written on a card, and another time it's Briggs being personally blackmailed.  If you're not an aficionado of the series, it may be difficult for a novice fan to enjoy these episodes as much as some of the ones in Seasons 2 and 3.

As for the set, it's presented in 4 slim DVD cases, each containing 1 or 2 DVDs.  They're presented in chronological order, 4 to a disc comprising 28 episodes on 7 discs.  But the episode NUMBERS are not the same as the episode AIR DATE.  For instance, Episode 12, ""The Trial,"" aired January 28, 1967; but Episode 13, ""The Carriers,"" aired November 19, 1966.  The DVDs, however, make no indication of which episodes are which, and therefore it's difficult to look them up in things like the ""Complete Mission Impossible Dossier"" when they're organized there in Episode Number order, not Air Date order.

The DVDs contain no special features.  Let me write it again: The DVDs contain no special features.  Given than DVDs have been around for nearly a decade, and that this popular TV series has crawled its way to DVD at a rate slower than most other classic shows, it's tough to justify why CBS didn't put any effort into provide a single additional feature.  It's bare bones: 4 episodes per disc, and nothing else.  That's a travesty.  The DVDs give a one-sentence summary of each episode, and that's it.

If you collected the 12 VHS ""Best of Mission: Impossible"" series, you'll find that six episodes (Pilot, Operation Rogosh, Old Man Out Parts I & II, The Carriers, and The Train) from that VHS series are from Season 1 and among the 28 episodes on the DVDs.  They're not particularly remastered in any special way.  And given the lack of special features, it's not particularly rewarding.

It's a nice DVD set--compact, simple, and user-friendly.  The CBS logo at the beginning of each disc is un-skippable, but it only lasts a few seconds.  And while it's great for a big fan like me, it's a bit disappointing that this is the best CBS could come up with.",1168128000,7,2393,4.647619047619048

This release is much superior to anything released in the past (i.e VHS Volume tapes)  You can tell the picture was digitally mastered as there is less grain and debris in the picture as you see on TV reruns.  From the moment the fuse is lit, the soundtrack sets the action.  This too has been cleaned up and sounds fantastic for a 40 year old show, now mixed to 5.1 sound.  The plots and gadgets, although sometimes dated, still keep you at the edge of your seat.

Some of the plots hold even in todays world. I hope enough sets sell to warrant Paramount to release more season sets.  Some suggestions to them however for future releases.

2647872,5,B000HWZ4HU,"My dad loved MI so I grew up watching the re-runs on tv.  I just thought all the gadgets were cool.  Gradually I appreciated the intricacies of their plans.  I too was disappointed when the movies came out.  Sure they were nifty action movies and I did enjoy them, but as others have pointed out it wasn't a team, it was a solo project for Tom Cruise.  It simply wasn't Mission: Impossible.

I was thrilled when I saw that the tv show was coming out on dvd and I went out and tracked down a copy asap after it came out.  I could hardly wait to pop one in when I got home and settled in for a long evening of retro television that probably wasn't going to be as good as I remembered it to be.

Boy was I wrong.  The show was at least as good as I remembered and probably better since I could appreciate the plots better than when I was a kid.  The biggest surprise was the effect it had on my own children.  I fired it up and slowly they all wandered in and sat down totally transfixed.  The most telling moment was when we got to the end of a disc and the final episode on that disc was a ""to be continued"".  My 14 year old son literally leaped off the couch to grab the next disc and put it in.

Sure, the gizmos are a little dated.  Sure, *everyone* smokes.  Sure, the fight choreography is pure William Shatner.  But the series holds up.  Even 40 years later it is still just as engaging as it was when it was new.  In some cases the stories are even more relevant now than even ten years ago.  The political climate has swung back to an ""us vs them"" state,  only with terrorists playing the bad guys instead of the soviets.  The performances (except the fist fights ;-) and the writing lift this series above its original time period and make it totally worth watching.

If this show can transfix kids 14, 12, 8, and 3 years old all at the same time, it *has* to be worth owning.",1167868800,13,1883,4.098630136986301

2647874,4,B000HWZ4HU,"I'm of the age where ""Mission: Impossible"" was on the air while I was in grade school, and was the first show I was allowed to stay up late to watch. I was mesmerized by the gadgets, clipped dialog, and missions that worked like puzzle boxes, and anxious whether the team would escape after accomplishing their plan.  Of course, I was also anxious whether Batman and Robin would escape the fiendish plots to kill them every Wednesday night; by Thursday, they were always safe and sound.

I had never seen any of the first season before, so I was unfamiliar with Steven Hill's role of Dan Briggs, which was replaced in the second season with the more familiar Peter Graves playing Jim Phelps.  This DVD set is an excellent way to observe the development of the show.  The set dressing and plots of the early shows are not as strong as the later episodes, and watching as a 40-something meant I had to suspend attention to details that escaped me when I was eight years old.  For example, a casino in one episode was redecorated to be a police station in the next; the elevator to a basement vault at the end of one story was in a hospital two weeks later (and since when do elevators have walls made of cinder blocks?).  But these were attributes of the time.  Perhaps one-third of the way into the season (and yes, I did watch all 28 episodes), there's a marked increase in quality.  Quality in stories -- Cinnamon becomes something more than eye candy; the group acts less as con artists and more as special ops; Barney has more gadgets to play with.  Quality in production values.  Quality in guest stars, including Arthur Hill, Carroll O'Connor, J.D. Cannon, Pat Hingle, and Ricardo Montalban.  And quality in the incidental music, which sounds like it was also written by Lalo Schifrin.  Of course, the unimitable theme still stirs my blood whenever I hear it.

The DVDs have no special features but otherwise are fine; good picture and sound quality.  The package of 7 discs is packaged economically in a thin box and won't wipe out one shelf of your storage racks.

All in all, a nice package of an interesting show.  I am so looking forward to the second season.",1167782400,10,2169,4.565891472868217

Not that the old team had no sex-appeal, on the contrary.  I just know that I was not watching for the sex-appeal, I was watching because the story gripped my attention and kept me guessing what would happen next.  It is a depth of writing that seems lost and I fear it will never be regained in this age where appearance seems more important than substance.

The IMF team was dispatched to help stop overthrows,rescue kidnapped politicians,recover secret government microfilm, you name it. It was all done with the express purpose of never getting caught and that whomever they were deceiving would never know who did it. Fans of ""Law & Order"" will be pleasantly surprised to see Stephen Hill heading the team in season 1 as Dan Briggs. What hasn't been mentioned here is that Hill was fired from the show after the first season ended due to his being difficult to deal with. He was subsequently replaced with Peter Graves as Jim Phelps. Greg Morris and the super handsome Peter Lupus were the only regulars who lasted the entire run of the show. Future cast members would include Leonard Nimoy, Sam Elliot and Lee Meriwether. The writing is superb and the DVD quality is outstanding.

Cheesy, piecemeal, and repetitious sets coupled with lackluster scripts, and utterly staid dialogue define this blackhole of flimsy intrigue and unimaginative suspense.

The only notable remains the opening score.

Comatose patients would undoubtedly find these plots further coma-inducing.

What were people NOT thinking???

Oh yes, and let's not forget Barbara Bain, who deservedly earns a decades-long-due razzie for her singular-dimensional and breathy, cliched-ridden sexpot agent, who equates smoking with acting, and who readily wore-out-her-welcome in just Season One, alone.

2647904,5,B000HWZ4HU,"To this day, no TV series has demanded as much attention from the viewer.  Instead of dumbing us down, this show insisted that we heighten our senses.  The basic structure of a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE episode as they are now remembered was still forming in the first season with various plot styles being tested.  This super-sophisticated series got better and better throughout the second and third seasons, but expect great things from this daring, ground-breaking, successful, and popular first year.  One reviewer has written that the episodes seem dated with 1960's-style TV production.  On the contrary, these ""mini motion pictures"" pushed television filming to new heights of artistic and technical sophistication.  The frequent rapid-fire cutting/editing resulted in most episodes containing double the number of shots found in any other TV series episodes.  The intricate plots cannot be followed by those numbed by today's ""think-it-for-you"" method of storytelling.  The meaning of certain events as they occur throughout the episodes will be lost to ""viewers"" who don't relish the requirement of complete concentration.  These factors are a large part of what makes MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE great.  The show is a rare opportunity to be more deeply involved in your entertainment than you probably ever have before.

What makes this DVD set all the more a discovered holy grail is that the picture and sound quality are absolutely superb.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE could never have looked this good, even when it was new in the sixties.  And you have the option of listening in original mono or remastered 5.1 stereo!  Wow, that opening music is awesome, being one of the greatest of all TV themes.  Another reviewer has complained about the lack of bonuses in the set.  The episodes ARE the features.  They were and still are a wonderful bonus gift in this world of entertainment sameness.  Sure, no series is more deserving of study and documentation as this one, but the episodes stand alone as supreme quality product.  Extras would be greatly appreciated, but are not necessary, as MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE on DVD is indeed an awesome, super-cool, long-awaited, much anticipated revealing of a long-lost holy grail.

Good luck viewer...",1166918400,27,2232,5.251412429378531
2647905,4,B000HWZ4HU,"Still smart and cool, even after all these years.

The reproduction for the DVDs is excellent, with bright crisp pictures, and clear sound. The more sophisticated filmmaking that is common on television today does make it look dated, though. You ""know"" you're looking at sound stage sets and backlots. But set that aside, the storytelling is still smart and the cast still the tops. Barbara Bain remains the classic classy female agent: she was exceptional back then, and remains so now.

I'm so pleased this is finally on DVD, and am looking forward to the rest of the seasons.",1166659200,5,578,4.828282828282828

2647957,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Wow!!!  I just received my copy of the 1st season of Mission: Impossible on DVD and am ecstatic.  I won't go as far as to say that I didn't enjoy the movie versions with Tom Cruise.  However; I wish that a Mission: Impossible movie would come out that was made in the true spirit of the television series.  I think that the first 30 minutes of M:I-1 came the closest, but that is just my opinion.

I haven't gone through the whole set yet, but I am currently on the 10th episode.  The entire series relies for the most part on intellect and skill rather than on explosions and special effects.  I can honestly say that I am having a good time watching and can't wait for the 2nd season to come out.  They just don't make television series' like they used to.

2647958,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Paramount Studios has done it once again, a full season set and not divided into volumes like other Studios. I have nothing but high praise for Paramount Studios and their release of ""Mission Impossible"" season one on DVD. They also recently released the ""Wild Wild West"" on DVD and I figured nothing could ever top the quality of that set. I'll admit I was wrong, the video and audio quality of Mission Impossible season one is absolutely stunning and I've never seen these episodes look better.

All 28 season one episodes presented in color with amazing remastered video and 5.1 digital surround sound are included for you're viewing pleasure. The 28 episodes including the pilot are spread out over 7 single sided discs with great slim case packaging & artwork. How is it that Paramount can deliver such high quality at an affordable price? Maybe they really do care about the fans of these classic TV shows and the way they present them. You won't find any bonus extra's included, but the quality of the episodes is what really matters and they are spectacular. This set rocks, bring on season two!

2647959,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Having been born well after the original series ended its run, Mission: Impossible was something I'd only caught in brief re-runs on TV, and through the revival series that aired in the 80s. But I'd seen enough of it for the show to leave a lasting impression, and knew that the Tom Cruise films were nothing like the series.

So I took a gamble on the first season, and it's a blast to watch. The show holds up really well, with intricate plots that take things seriously and avoid the usual sixties cheese. The formula for each show is standard, but there are enough curveballs and variations to keep things interesting. Production values seem pretty high for this kind of retro fare; considering they had to come up with a different, fictitious country every week, there's a good mixture of indoor and backlot sets to get the idea across. And while Jim Phelps isn't head of IMF at this point, Steven Hill as Dan Briggs is a capable team leader and active field agent. He gets the series off on the right foot.

If you enjoy more laid-back stuff that doesn't rely on explosions and music video edits, Mission: Impossible is highly recommended. Every episode is a mini-movie, and the set comes with 28 of them. Video is crisp, the audio does justice to the dialogue and classic theme. I can't wait for season 2.

PS: I tried five different stores before I found my copy, and most of the clerks honestly thought Mission: Impossible started with the Tom Cruise films. For shame!",1166054400,10,1477,4.608365019011407
2647960,4,B000HWZ4HU,"I received my copy of the DVDs last week and love every moment as I watch every show. The color and sound were good. Though no special features on these DVDs for those who like that kind of thing.  In this first season you see Mr Briggs (Steven Hill) as the Mission Leader.  He did a great job as Mission Leader.  Also, another interesting note is that the tape recorder wasn't the only method use to give the mission brief at the beginning.

This is a must see for any fan on the Mission Impossible TV Series.

I wonder if we shall see the other seasons anytime soon?  Nothing on the radar screen.",1165968000,4,598,4.247787610619469
2647961,5,B000HWZ4HU,"The original Mission Impossible (TV series) has a little something for everyone. Gorgeous gals for the guys, bulging muscles and a handsome face for the gals, and (usually) a plot which will keep us all entertained for the hour the show runs. And while the plots are not great inof themselves, the joy is in watching the IMF pull the operation off. It's like watch a Rube Goldberg fabrication in action. You know the outcome, but watching the machine work is fascinating.

I just received my set and look forward to acquiring the entire collection as it is made available. The transfer to DVD is crisp and clear with excellent audio. No extras to speak of, but that's okay ... I like the show.

One peculiarity I've noticed on my set is that when the DVD is first inserted, no matter which of the episodes I select, the third one plays. It does this until I select the third one and stop it. Then I can pick the one I want to see. While this is not a big detractor from the set, it is an oddity and can get in the way if you want to see a particular episode.

Oh well....

For anyone that hasn't seen the original series and judges MI by the movie remakes (I've never seen any of them, and don't appear to be missing much), read any of the reviews here and at least rent the set for an evening or two. Chances are, you'll be captivated.

2647962,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Unlike many of the reviewers, I DO rememember seeing MI in its original network airing.  I am glad it still has appeal to the younger generations.  Although primarily a sitcom fan, this was my favorite drama back then.  Both Hill and Graves were great as head of the IM Force.  My interest in the series declined after season 5, when Landau and Bain left.  (I think Barbara Bain was my first teenage crush!) I will be buying at least the first 5 seasons if they all come out.",1165622400,,475,4.3522727272727275

The New Mission Impossble versus The original: The new Mission Impossible: Alot of shootem up violence ,and plus tom cruise profiling. (I guess all he thinks is to just profile alot and not actually act is okay).Now The Original: Awesome!  The IMF group only use excessive force if necessary and the gadgets they use and optical illusions and special effects they use is great and there is drama. My favorite episode is ""The Train"".  The special effects in that episode are great :-) The story lines are great. I really like steven hill and beautiful barbara bain is awesome. If you want a great hang off your seat spy thriller/drama I recommend this.  Also I like greg morris with his electronics expertise and strongman peter lupus,also can't forget ""man with many faces"" martin landau!  I just got my set!  Love it!

I haven't seen any of these shows since then so this is a real trippy treat down memory lane for me.  I love the classic cars, the ""high tech"" gadgets and the whole 60's milieu of this tv show.

The digital transfers are outstanding.  The best I've seen for something of this vintage.  Amazing clarity, color saturation and contrast.  (I never noticed how much these actors sweated until I watched these crystal clear DVDs!)  Sound quality is top notch as well.  And one of the best theme songs ever.

This first year entry of Mission Impossible features the solo season of Steven Hill as Dan Briggs, the head of the IMF.  As most of us think of Hill as the curmudgeonly DA on Law & Order, he gets the series off to a great start.  I see on the 3rd episode on Disc One, the tape recording is first used as contact information.

Gadget Trivia: Has anyone spotted that the first tape used is actually a ""cutting edge"" 4 Track cartridge?:)

Paramount has done a splendid job with digitally clean single-sided picture discs packaged 2 discs per slimline case.  Like Perry Mason, there are no extras but at least the entire season is out in whole.

Also as Desilu Studios produced both MI & Classic Star Trek, I am seeing many guest star alumni from Classic Star Trek appearing in this first MI season.",1165363200,8,962,4.787878787878788
2648006,5,B000HWZ4HU,"I've been waiting since DVDs came out for this series to be released. It puts the ""pretty boy"" Tom Cruise wanna be MI films to shame. This series was one of the best of the '60s, hands down!! Martin Landeau, Barbara Bain, Greg Morris, Peter Lupus...a great team. The quirky stories, intricate gameplans and surprise endings made this a ""thinking person's"" espoinage series. I picked it up yesterday and quickly put on the episode ""The Train"", where an European would-be dictator thinks he is on a railway car (instead he in in an elaborate theater). We, the audience, are let in on the sharade from the beginning. All in a days work for the MI team!! I can't wait to get home from work to view another episode.

2648007,5,B000HWZ4HU,"When I was in college everthing stopped in my dorm when MI came on. I followed it religiously and was a bitter as Barbara Bain was when it was cancelled. I've waited and waited for it to appear under one cover, and now am happy to say that, it having arrived, MI is as good as I hoped (and remembered). Those who recal the Peter Graves years should note that he wasn't the first director of the IMF, and that this first season seems a little mor earnest than the latter ones. I remeber that when we first saw it, we thought that the black-and-white room where they got their assignments seemed edgy, since we all remembered B&W TV, and that the throwback was original against this, being very early in color TV series. The stories in this first season are typical MI, and all revolve around a bad guy, a task, and a near escape. The beautiful woman gets to be beautiful, the strong man strong and so on. They pretty much all end with the IMF riding into the sunset. What makes this DVD release so special is the incredible care that went into the transfers and remastering. The pictures are far, far more crisp than they were in the 60's, and if the colors are less than vivid, they are certainly retro, and suit the sets, plots and decor. The extras on the disk are terrific considering the age of the series. Kudos and two thumbs up for finally bringing this terrific (and prototypic) action series to DVD!

It appears this set is being under-marketed (none of my local retailers is advertising it, and some aren't even carrying it.)  If you're on the fence about buying this, trust me: it doesn't disappoint.

As more and more TV shows were released in DVD boxed sets, I waited, first patiently, then impatiently, for the EXCELLENT Mission: Impossible series to be among them.  I couldn't understand why it was consistently overlooked!  I had no idea it was because of the sub-standard movies that had recently been cranked out!  Why the producers of the movies would think that DVD's of the series would adversely effect ticket sales is beyond me...unless they knew their products were inferior in comparison.

I was too young to watch the first two seasons when they first aired.  I had a very early bedtime.  But after a babysitter let me see an episode from the third season, I was hooked!  I'd go to bed, then sneak downstairs and sit two feet away from the TV so the sound wouldn't draw attention and get me in trouble, to watch this incredible show!  Pretty soon my brother was sneaking down to join me!  Thankfully, by the last season we were both allowed to actually stay up and watch!

Until I bought the VHS tapes of M:I several years ago (while waiting in line for a Harry Potter book to be released...either the second or third, I think!), I had no idea Peter Graves hadn't been in every episode.

I grew up in the MI TV series era.  As a TV/DVD collector of primarily 60's-80's series and member of a couple of TV/DVD forums on the 'net, I can mention to all of the ""Amazon'ers"" out there that this is a gem that we've been wanting on DVD for years.  As for some of the ""Cruise"" posts, I saw the 1st MI film and, as others mentioned here, it's somewhat like comparing ""apples and oranges"".  From a TV/DVD collectors point of view, we want the (TV-series remake) films released, since in a lot of cases, the studios will release the original TV/DVD series as a market ""tie-in"" coinciding with the film release.  TV/DVD collectors may not purchase the film on DVD but in a lot of cases, the film ""gets the job done"" for the TV series release.  My favorite season of this series was S1.  I liked Steven Hill in the IMF Force Team Leader role just a little better than Peter Graves although I thought Graves did an outstanding job in the role after Hill left the series.  I also liked the original script line of  ""Please dispose of this recording in the usual manner"".  :)  What can we say about the ""Landau/Bain"" team on this show?  Classic!  And, what a casting jackpot for Greg Morris in the ""tech/electronics genius"" role :)

This series is a must-buy for most of the TV/DVD collectors out there.  It's simply-put, a ""sure thing"" gem for your collection.  I only hope that additional seasons will make it to their release[s].  As the saying goes, ""It's all about the #'s"" (sales #'s).  Hopefully, this set will sell well on the 'net stores and your local outlets.

2648061,5,B000HWZ4HU,"The Caption listed on Amazon states that the starring actress is Barabara Anderson. The first season of MI was the very cool and sophisticated Barbara Bain. Barbara Anderson did not come on the scene until the early 70's and after that a host of different actresses. Bain made a mistake of leaving MI along with her then husband Martin Landau because of a salary dispute. As I understand it, they just did not show up for the rehearsal and taping of a particular episode. She was black balled and she is still to this day. No work for her then and even now into old age. That is too bad. I suppose she ignored the power of the then studio system. She was a fantastic actress that could have made it to the ultimate top. Martin Landau went on to become a success but it is quite different for a man in this industry. Barabara bain is in her finest hour in Mission Impossible. She will forever be rememembered as Cinnomon Carter.",1163548800,11,927,4.395348837209302
2648062,2,B000HWZ4HU,"J.R. Nelson is correct!! Half of the movie, or DVD, viewing experience is the sound!!! This DVD is in mono!!!!!!!! All the positives about this series remains - the best of all time. But, the 3 Cruise versions all have way, way, better sound, and DVD extras. I fully recommend the 5 ""Alias"" seasons over this package because of the far superior sound, and obvious similarities to the original Mission: Impossible tv series.",1163462400,3,423,4.808219178082192
2648063,1,B000HWZ4HU,"We discovered that this DVD of Mission Impossible - The Complete First Season will not provide subtitles and no closed captions.  1960's TV Mission Impossible was my favorite TV show of all time.  We are hearing impaired (both deaf and hard of hearing) and we want to see what they said from this legendary TV classic show.  We survived and endured through hearing impaired discriminations, prejudice and bigotry such as Audism.  Please don't buy this DVD without subtitles and no closed captions because they deliberately copied from TV screen show to video without mastering of high-digital video techniques such as coloring, subtitles, etc.  Paramount Home Video company often made cheap and flawed DVD video in order to boost their profit while lower the video quality.

2648064,5,B000HWZ4HU,"Yes!!I was extremely excited when I saw that the MI tv series was finally going to be released on dvd. I've been waiting for a long time for them to come out. Although,I don't really remember the episodes that I used to watch back in the day,I can only say that it was a well thought out show,with great plots and stories. For those people who never saw the tv series,they will enjoy it today as much as us ""older people"" enjoyed watching it many years ago. I think that they will find it to be very entertaining. The tv series was way ahead of its time. Not like the early James Bond movies versus the more up to date movies with all of the stunts and special fx. I think the tv show is still relevant today. The show had excellent writing. The MI movies captured very little of the original plot structure of the tv series,except for the opening scene of the first movie.that scene was what the tv series was all about,a lot of deception going on. I will buy every one of the sets as soon as they are released. Thank you paramount.",1161820800,16,1033,4.248730964467005

not been a show like this on the air before and the plots were great.  Steven Hill was their leader on season one and

Bain and Landau got to do some great stuff.  This will be a

most welcome addition to my library. I can only hope that

they have extras and have Bain and Landau talking about their

The subtext running throughout the series is an interesting window upon the geopolitical environment of the times dominated by the Cold War.  Like comparing Star Trek (a phenomenal leap forward in its time) to Star Wars, the 1967 version does not compare favorably with today's acting and directing.  But for 50 YEARS AGO, ground breaking!  If Star Trek was to TV what the Beatles were to music, then MI was the Rolling Stones (or Bob Dylan).",1518825600,,578,4.74
