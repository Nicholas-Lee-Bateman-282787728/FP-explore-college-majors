2343976,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Awesome anime even if you aren't really into comedy and romance. The storyline is very good it hooks you from the beginning till the end. The characters are very cute albeit somewhat basic, but there was plenty of character development throughout the story. I actually liked sumomo's voice, it made me laugh everytime she woke up and began the morning excercises. The storyline was not too confusing, although I still don't understand why Chii was thrown away and left out in the open, instead of maybe being hidden somewhere...Also, the ending was a little odd, but other than that this is a great anime.",1134086400,2,605,4.826923076923077
2343977,5,B0009ZE9QM,"In the future, personal computers have developed into humanoid 'Persocons'. A prep school student named Hideki Motosuwa desperately wants to buy a Persocon but can't afford to. One fateful day he finds a Persocon in a garage pile and so he takes her home. When he turns on the Persocon, she can only say 'Chi' and that's what he names her. Over time it becomes apparent that Chi is more than an average Persocon. It seems that Chi might be a ""Chobit"", a type of advanced Persocon rumoured to have independent thought and feeling. How far will Hideki go to protect her and what will their relationship become.

The Chobits Collection contains all 7 DVD volumes and the Character Song Collection CD - a total of 8 discs in 4 double thinpak cases. The artbox has a plastic slipcase with the description and specs on it, so the artbox itself is pretty much free of any text.",1132358400,78,870,4.54140127388535
2343978,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Though there are a lot of scenes that differ from (or were not present in) the manga, Chobits is a great anime series to watch.  The way that the ending plays out is slightly different from the manga, but it still holds true in tone and execution (and is still a happy ending).

In regards to the dvd, the picture is beautiful with bright colors popping off the screen.  Thankfully (as many tv shows on dvd do not have this feature) there are chapter stops for the intro and ending themes, though while they are catchy, I don't particularly want to see them for every episode.  A cd is also included entitled the Chobits Character Song Collection.

If you liked the Chobits manga or are a fan of anime in general, don't hesitate to buy this dvd.",1131840000,17,745,4.408759124087592
2343979,5,B0009ZE9QM,"This is an excellent anime, and a very nice take on the more traditional ""boy meets girl plots"". Some have said in the past that this series is yet another one about a lonely guy often a nerdy type, who is lucky enough to meet a lovely, and (not always) submissive female. In most anime, this female robot or android just happens to be a robot or android of some sort either created by or stumbled upon by the main character. However, that is far too simple a way to explain it and I think unjustly labels ""Chi"", the Persocom (android) within this story, and the other female androids.

Looking only at ""Chi"" as the story moves on it is obvious she is not submissive but filled with childlike innocence. This is what helps make the story so different from others with female androids. Chi is truly a child learning about the world around her and the very important rule it will seem she will play seemingly as one of the legendary ""Chobits"", the Peroscoms that legend holds are have real emotions and need no traditional programming to function.

As she learns about this world around her, and at times has her innocence exploited, something that can easily be mistaken for her being submissive, Hideki, the main male character and one that finds Chi, finds himself both as her teacher and her caretaker. As they both grown and learn together and begin to see the world through each other's eyes they naturally grow closer together in a way that works as being very easy to accept and believe could happen.

The climax itself and what happens when all the pieces are in place, the pieces of the puzzles that build through mysterious photos, and searches to see if Chi really is a ""Chobits"" is something not to be missed and is one of the most stunning and emotionally filled endings I have ever seen to an anime.

With a story that is so well written that it is very easy to grow to love the characters and feel excitement about the characters this ending was perhaps even more emotional. Overall this is not an anime you should miss and is one that should be on  everyone's ""Must See"" lists no matter your typical favorite genre.",1130803200,5,2130,4.522077922077922

2344016,4,B0009ZE9QM,"The anime isn't as good as the manga but it's still one of my favorites. This review may contain spoilers from here. You've been warned.

The filler episodes were unnecessary as usual, and I don't like how they portrayed Chii as a ditz instead of simply ignorant. The extra stuff they threw in near the ending regarding the hard reset was completely unnecessary, the manga accomplished such a heartfelt and complete conclusion without it that I'm not sure who exactly thought it was a good idea to swap Freya and Chii like that. It completely changes the meaning of Freya's presence within Chii. Other than that, still a favorite /sigh",1495756800,,635,4.7727272727272725

Once he activates it, his life is forever changed.

2344020,5,B0009ZE9QM,"- Synopsis: A story about a country person moving to the big city of Tokyo. There, he sees that just like with today's cell phones, everybody has a Persocom: a hybrid of a humanoid computer. Seeing how he couldn't purchase one, he goes home empty-handed and discouraged. Fortunately, he stumbles upon one abandoned in the trash. From there, his life changes for better or worst, as he teaches his Persocom various things as he also develops feelings for her. As well as uncovering secrets about his Persocom's past.

===========================================================================================================

- Analysis: This anime also implies an interesting situation that is relevant to contemporary society. That is, the amount of time and money that is invested into technology. Perhaps it is alluding to the fact that no matter how much time-consuming or expensive technology is, humans cannot live fulfilling lives without them. Or even know how to live without them (imagine being separated from a music device, cell phone, internet, or any screen in general for a prolonged amount of time).

As such, they are willing to spend much of what they have on their beloved technology. This also helps advance things, which typically leads to more positive feedback. Furthermore, this also seems to reduce the amount of communication between other people, as technology increasingly replaces old-fashioned customs such as face-to-face interactions between another human. In summation, it seems as long as people are content, that is all that really matters, even though it may create a multitude of problems for them in the long-run.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 24 episodes on 3 Blu-rays with a run-time of about 10 hours. Rated TV-14 with moderate amounts of fan-service. No nudity.

- Conclusion: Overall, the main character is an older perverted guy (what guy isn't) in his twenties, but this still is a wonderfully romantic, and laughter-filled anime that for the most part makes you feel warm inside. The music is also very catchy. Fits various scenes and the anime very well. This is a refreshing romantic comedy with plenty of silly situations that will have you laughing.

2344027,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Since I've already watched the anime, loved it, and have it has one of my favorites, I'm going to write a review more on the product quality (DVD, Box, Video Quality)

Note:
First off, I have purchased this as new (sealed) and as the 2011 DVD format.

Video quality:
The video quality, since this anime was made back in 2002, is fairly good. It's kinda blurry (as in a filter, not actually poor quality), but that's understandable to hide the chunky lines due to not being able to make anime HD back then. So at least understand that it's an old anime and won't be HD like a 2012 anime, for example, Sword Art Online. Oh, and the title screens are of similar quality too. The subtitles though: they are okay. Tested this on a HDTV: It still looks beautiful! Better than my computer, oddly.

Box quality:
Pretty good, especially for old art. There is also art on the inside of the box cover which looks great too! Now onto the quality: Not much to say, box sleeve is great, box is great, cover is great. Oh, and the part that holds the discs isn't too shabby either. Holds well.

Discs (comes with 4 discs):
The discs also have lovely pictures on them, however, what I find odd is that the first disc has a lower resolution image of Chi on it and therefore is not as clear as the other 3 discs. My disc 3 has scuffs all around the border and a little grime on the center, which is odd, however, I played it for a few minutes on the computer and there don't seem to be any skips, thankfully.

So, the review of the physical item I am giving is: 3.75/5 (good, but can use some improving on not scratching the discs)
For clarification on my 5 out of 5 stars choice: because the show is fantastic! I'd recommend it",1465603200,,1709,4.2786377708978325

2344034,4,B0009ZE9QM,"For a genre known for it's cute anime girls, this series probably has an anime girl that ranks at least in the top 5 of the genre as cutest anime girl. It would be annoyingly cute were it not for her being a robot that makes it easy for the viewer to forgive her sickeningly sweet antics. Chobits is pretty much known by its main character, Chi the robot girl. The other characters are done well enough, and the overall story and premise are actually not that great, but good enough to be watchable. But the real reason you would want to see it is for Chi herself. She is voiced really well by both the Japanese and English voice actresses so either version is fun to watch. The series unfortunately misses all opportunities to play on the Pygmalion and Galatea theme, but Chi is too darn cute to hold her accountable for any of that.",1452384000,,834,4.352564102564102

The interesting story, the art, going from one episode to the next with more excitement than the last.
It's not just a story you witness, but more of a story you experience, at least that's how I felt about it.

As far as fan service I think this Anime sets what should be a standard when it comes to Fan Service in anime. It's there, but it's
not in any way overwhelming, disgusting, or a hindrance to the story; least not in my opinion.

As far as menu navigation goes, I give it a 5/5. It's not extraordinary or anything, but it's easy to see, simple to use...it's what it should be.

If you haven't seen this anime I would strongly recommend giving it a try, and If you have seen and enjoyed the anime then I would encourage you to purchase this DVD series because the artwork on, and inside the cover and on the disks is very nice.

Sure this is another generic story line with an average college boy who stumble across extraordinary girl, etc. etc., but it definitely has it's unique points too.

It's almost as if the authors wrote a parody of all other animes, making fun of generic scripts and plot lines. Very unorthodox and funny (my gut was splitting a few times). Things like the main char saying ""Oh my, I'm a poor guy and stumbled across this girl!? Then she must have superpowers and we're going to save to world/fall in love!""

The feeling that Chi has for her master were drug out to the last minute where it was kind of too late to even form a sense of opinion towards them as a ""couple"".

2344109,4,B0009ZE9QM,"The focus of the Chobits anime is a lot more ""slice of life"" than its manga counterpart--focusing a lot more heavily on how the country boy Hideki adjusts to city life, or getting addicted to a video game; and delighting in showing every little scene where Chii is cutely trying to do something or other, all the while blissfully unaware of human social taboos.  (Repeating ""Pantsu...Pantsu...Pantsu"" while you're walking on a busy street is a no no, dear.)  The thing is, most of these scenes weren't in the manga (which this show is based on, if you didn't know).  Now, most of them are cute, and some entertaining, but most of them don't really add anything to the plot itself.  It seems like a waste of a good chance--they could have spent that time developing the world a bit more.  Instead, they basically copy-pasted the original plot of the manga, and then inserted random filler episodes here and there.

All in all, its a fun series and the excellence of the original story shines through, except for the filler episodes that do little for the plot.  If you collect anime you can't go wrong with this BluRay edition of Chobits.",1358467200,,1137,4.655

It's great for collectors and the discs came in wonderful condition as well as the case. It's a story about a girl named Chi who is a Persocom -robot-like companions created for people to buy and program to their wishes- and her owner that finds her Hideki. He learns that she has only 1 program in her to learn things and he then goes through the story teaching her about humanity while simultaneously trying to understand her origins (because her found her abandoned). It's very tantalizing to watch Chi understand and see beauty in the world around while at the same time want to know more about what Chi really is and who created her.

Hideki is clueless. Women. Technology. Life in general. Does not have a lick of common sense. But he's a ""nice guy"" and that's his saving grace. One evening he discovers an android (In the series they're called ""persocoms"")in the trash.  He brings this ever-so-cute female robot home, only to discover his new droid is deactivated. This is when we're introduced to Hideki's lack of ANY experience with women, and discover how easily he's embarrassed. This is an ongoing part of the series and one of the major plot points the humor is based on.

I understand saving a damsel in distress, but should rape (referring to the power up operations for chi in the first episode) or molestation have to be the route this anime journeys on?  Unfortunately yes, I don't recommend this series to toddlers or the inexperienced for its nothing more than a sexist series that comes off rather offensive on most accounts.  As for the story? What story,  98% of the series reminds me of Dorra the explorer for thats the exact journey Chi takes you on throughout the series.

2344125,5,B0009ZE9QM,"I just finished watching this series, and I totally loved it! It is poignant, innocent, funny at times (in an awkward sort of way!), has a lot of depth to the characters, a few sad moments, and is really lovable.

The story is based on male lead Hideki Motosuwa, an 18-year-old student who has been sent to Tokyo by his parents to study at a 'cram' school (he lives on a farm with his family normally). He has an unfortunate tendency to 'think' out loud (a habit he got into when working alone on his parents' farm), which causes him some embarrassing moments! Shortly after arriving, he finds a 'persocom' (a human form computer/android) in the trash, and takes her home and tries to restart her. After eventually managing to do so, he finds she has no data installed, and is only able to say one word, 'Chi', so he names her Chi. She turns out subsequently to be a 'Chobit' series persocom (hence the title) which are much more sophisticated than the run-of-the-mill persocoms, and rumoured to be sentient (i.e. self-aware). His next-door neighbour, fellow-student Hiromu Shinbo and his persocom (a cute, doll-sized, mobile model called Sumomo) helped him to get Chi going again. Other characters are Chitose Hibiya, the manager/landlady of the apartment block where Hideki and Shinbo live, who is kind, gentle and helpful, even letting Hideki pay his rent late when he loses his wallet one time. She teaches Chi to make curry and rice for Hideki's evening meal. Then there is Minoru Kokubunji, a 12-year-old genius, expert on persocoms and son of a rich family; he owns a number of persocoms, all of whom are dressed in skimpy, maid-type outfits complete with stockings and suspenders! He also has one special, custom-built persocom called Yuzuki, who looks and sounds like his late sister, whom he misses very much; she is wiser and kinder than most of the 'standard' persocoms, and seems to really care about Minoru, whom she addresses as 'Lord Minoru'. Attractive Miss Takako Shimizu is Hideki and Shinbo's teacher, and often catches Hideki daydreaming in class. When Hideki is forced to take a part-time job at a pub/restaurant called 'My Pleasure', in order to make ends meet, he meets bosses daughter Yumi Omura, a cute 17-year-old who is petite and pretty, and has ample bosoms ('I'm a D cup, if you're wondering', she tells Hideki one time, when he absent-mindedly stares at her chest)! Hiroyasu Ueda is a kind, gentle guy, manager of a cake shop, where Chi gets a part-time job. He is impressed with Chi's ability to learn on the job, and to work hard, and becomes friends with both Chi and Hideki - he even teaches Chi to make cakes herself. He has a sad secret in his past. Yoshiyuki Kojima, aka 'Dragonfly', is a somewhat obsessive, slightly creepy, custom persocom builder who becomes obsessed with Chi, and even kidnaps her at one point. He has a cute mobile persocom called Kotoko, who is kind and wise, and programmed to always tell the truth, which lands her master in trouble at times! She and Sumomo are often seen together towards the end of the series, although Kotoko finds Sumomo to be loud, unsubtle and a bit hard to take, often sighing in exasperation at her crazy antics! Lastly there are Zima and Dita, two security persocoms, who have been tasked with keeping tabs on Chi, in case she runs her 'final program', with unknown disastrous consequences.

There is little in the way of fanservice (apart from one episode where Hideki has to buy underwear for Chi!), and Kokobunji's 'maid' persocoms. Oh, and one time teacher Miss Shimizu gets drunk, crashes at Hideki's apartment, and strips off down to her bra and panties (it is a hot summer's night!), and gives Hideki a nosebleed! Definitely one to watch, I found the whole story to be riveting, entertaining, funny, heartwarming and great fun. I do hope there will be more animes in the same series.",1335398400,,3880,4.772321428571429
2344126,1,B0009ZE9QM,"There's been plenty already said about Chobits and its anime adaptation, but the real problem here is that this Blu-ray release is completely riddled with very serious problems that border the line of unwatchable; they're so bad, in fact, that the DVD release actually does seem to inexplicably look and sound better.

Little to no effort was done here to translate this into Blu-ray, and it appears to have done only bad things to it. There is literally no improvement in any area. The picture quality is the worst I've seen for an anime, bar none. Jagged edges are absolutely everywhere, the animation stutters so often it can happen very noticeably several times an episode, some frames are so ugly it's as if you're streaming them from a standard cell phone in 320x240 resolution back in the 3gp era, the colors are all horribly washed out and there is an unbelievable lack of vibrancy, practically all of the animation is blurred to some extent, and, to put it short, this is actually worse than any typical DVD release, including its own.

The sound, despite being advertised as improved, does not seem noticeably improved at all. Errors in synchronization are rampant, the quality sounds as if it's been ultracompressed into nothingness, there was clearly no effort whatsoever in the remixing and it's immediately noticeable, and the voices all sound as muted as if you're playing a standard-quality YouTube video off of a laptop. It's simply awful, and impossible not to be distracted by.

There are no redeeming features here to speak of. The menus are ugly and confusingly laid out, the extras are extraneous even by anime standards, and while I prefer dub over sub, upon looking at the text, the complaints are completely justified. All voice subtitles are white with a thin black border, but the text, for some impossible reason, is so incredibly jagged that I've had easier times reading subtitles on a low-band stream of untouched anime from 20 years ago. It's comparable to a VHS tape in quality. For me, this really isn't an issue, since I watch dubs anyway, but anyone who enjoys subs more are going to have a really, really hard time accepting this level of unreadability here on televisions and monitors smaller than thirty inches.

Considering that FUNimation has done excellent work with some of their Blu-ray releases, the neglect of care done for this series is shameful, even if you factor in the age of the series. With simply horrid video, audio, and text quality that is somehow worse than the DVD releases, there is no reason for this to even exist. Nothing I've said is an exaggeration; it really does look and sound that bad. It's a miserable transition into Blu-ray, seemingly done in one quick run with no care taken whatsoever to make sure it simply worked right.

It's safe to assume that, someday, somewhere, CLAMP's penultimate work, Card Captor Sakura, will be translated to Blu-ray, too. All I can do is wait and hope that a little more work is put into that so it's actually worth it after such a long wait, with no beginning in sight for any project of the sort. We might end up with a totally different format by the time that happens, the way things are going now.

Worthless and insulting.",1335052800,7,3232,4.7831541218638

2344128,5,B0009ZE9QM,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray version which I purchased recently based on other reviews I had seen here.

This is a surprisingly deep anime series with a hard core sci-fi plot underlying it all. It starts off fun and a bit silly at times in the beginning and progressively gets deeper and more serious as you progress with each connected episode.

This is a real ""sleeper"" that will have you thinking about the issues raised hours after you have quit watching an episode. I know I did! It is also very timely as it deals with technology addiction issues, albeit in a future setting (30-40 years from now).

The central issue of this story is what happens when technology reaches a level where the lines between what is human and what is machine blur and the impacts on human relations that can occur because of that blurring.

My wife, who does not generally like anime, got hooked on this one and she told me it reminds her of a sci-fi soap opera in that it's a single story spread over 24 half hour episodes. For my part I got hooked on the story line almost from the beginning!

Sound quality and graphics were very good as you would expect with a blu-ray version.

My only complaint is that there weren't more episodes!

If you are interested in good story telling based anime than I highly recommend that you purchase this anime series. You won't be disappointed!",1331942400,3,1370,4.5
2344129,2,B0009ZE9QM,"Chobits was cool. It has good animation and sound. The characters were all pretty good too.

I disliked this series only because I can't get into a romance between a computer and a human being. I'm the type of guy who would have liked to have seen social prejudice against persecoms. Some of the main characters disliked them but only because they got jilted because of them. I would have liked Chi to have acquired a personality by the end but she continued to talk in third-person and had no desires other than to be with Hideki. During the show I kept thinking to myself that it would be great if he got with a human instead of a robot. I couldn't get into the idea of his trading real girls in for a computer. During the series they tried to make it more ambiguous on being in love with a computer so you can get used to the idea but I just didn't buy it.

I give this two stars because I wanted more out of it. I will give it credit though. I liked the characters but the main relationship was something I couldn't get past. This show is very cute throughout and it had great humour. Show's like this don't need to be very deep if you aren't picky in a love story then this is for you.

My suggestion would be to skip this and go to something like Ah! My Goddess. It is heart warming and love between two sentient biological people (although they are of different species).",1331769600,3,1378,4.231939163498099
2344130,4,B0009ZE9QM,This a pretty good series. It doesn't get old watching it. Not the greatest series but definitely one to have in your collection.,1331424000,,129,4.6521739130434785
2344131,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Chobits is a Manga series that was adapted to an anime by the famous CLAMP. The story follows a Persocom named Chi that Hideki finds lying in the trash abandoned. The story is basically about the robot Chi learning all about life and Hideki's life in Japan. Episodes are basically around Chi learning something new, and usually something amusing goes wrong along the way.

For an Anime that was made last decade it has pretty decent drawings and its widescreen, so you won't have to worry about those pesky bars at the side on a HDTV. Persocom's are easily identifiable but cat like ears on their head that are actually used as a USB like port to use them as a computer.

For an anime that has only around 20 episodes, they have too many full recap episodes (Three in total), which slightly interrupts the viewing. One good thing about it though is that the main episodes are titled ""Chi something"", while the recaps are ""so and so story"". So you know what episodes you can completely skip entirely.

If you like cutesy anime series then I recommend picking this up. Plot is pretty decent, and I love the futuristic android setting. It also has a good ending, and nothing like the typical open ended conclusions anime seems to have these days. This is also available on Netflix, I recommend watching this if you are at least a little bit interested it and you pay for Netflix streaming.

Positive:
* Persocom's are pretty awesome

2344132,5,B0009ZE9QM,Well all I can say about this anime is that it's one of the best shows I have watched and when I watched it I watched it with my cousins and I basically got them into it. It is a must have for any anime fan.,1325203200,,207,3.5217391304347827
2344133,5,B0009ZE9QM,"I adore Chobits. This series just gets better and better. I never wanted it to end. Love that its not only adorable, but its funny and in some episodes towards the end you never see whats coming.",1324857600,,195,4.297297297297297
2344134,5,B0009ZE9QM,"I first watched this series on Funimations website, then bought this dvd series as they did not have the last few episodes on their website up for viewing. I'm still pretty much an anime noob so I had just heard about this series. I rewatched it I must say, not giving out any spoilers, the last episode was one of the most emotional joyrides a TV show has ever gotten me. I personally recommend this series if you're into love stories, and creepy ones at that.",1319846400,,461,4.372093023255814
2344135,3,B0009ZE9QM,"I agree with the other reviews as far as the positive points of Chobits are concerned, so I won't go into detail therein.  Instead I'll concentrate on the negatives as follows:

5 stars - for the series overall (per other positive reviews)

Minus 1 star - for the usual Anime Male Idiot as a main character: a thoroughly aggravating, gynephobic, neurotic, socially crippled moron.  He starts coming to his senses in some of the later episodes, but not soon enough to salvage the 1 star penalty.

Minus 1 star - for a weak series finale.  This came as no surprise to me, really.  Anime writers seem incapable of providing any kind of believable closure, either happy or sad.  They even foul up the ambiguous endings - the ones they intend to be ambiguous, that is.

Don't worry about real spoilers here.  Without going into details about the exact nature of the happy vs. sad vs. ambiguous ending of Chobits, I can safely reveal that the finale has at least two manufactured crises (as in, ""So what?  What's the problem, all of a sudden?""), three totally arbitrary miracles, and a few meaningless setbacks to enable efficient switching back and forth between positive and negative outcomes - not necessarily in that order, so as not to spoil the ending for you.

In addition, there are contradictory references to a series of books that ""Chi"" has been reading throughout the series.  The message of the books, somewhat consistent up until the last few epsiodes, suddenly starts reversing back and forth between happy vs. sad outcomes in tone.  In short, it all makes the presence of that book in the series utterly meaningless.

Then there is the mysterious ""Syndicate"" (or something like that) behind the development of the ""Chobits"" robots.  It seems like a pretty ominous group, not to be taken lightly.  Yet its presence is completely lacking in the last episode.  There are some ""enemies"" of sorts present, but their connection to this ""Syndicate"", even if there is such a connection, is not adequately explained.  Not to me, anyway.

Finally, there is some inexplicable activity on the part of one of the inventors of the special class of ""Chobits"" robots of which ""Chi"" is a member.  Like the book ""Chi"" has been reading, the inventor's agenda seems consistent up until the last few episodes.  Then she too reverses and re-reverses her role so often that you wonder why she was included in the series in the first place.

OK, I went into the weak series ending at some length, probably unnecessarily so.  Anime fans are already familiar with botched series finales like this one.

And despite the length and content of both negative criticisms, these faults do not completely destroy the series.  They can't, because it really is that good overall.  If you're reading this review and it dissuades you from watching Chobits, don't be discouraged.  Those positive points explored by other reviewers make it well worth viewing, negative stars notwithstanding (heck of a modifier, that last one - almost like something that can and can't stand up at the same time.  I wonder....).

In addition, there is a final closure of sorts - it just doesn't follow from anything else that happens in the finale (I see from other reviews that the Manga version of the series clears up some of the conundrums in that last episode)

I will say one good thing about the finale: when the Male Idiot becomes perturbed over an actual crisis for a change, he doesn't get a nosebleed from the excitement, wave his arms around like a windmill, or suffer the stock anime ""face wipe"" used to designate panic attacks.  He actually behaves the way a real person would when confronted by such an emergency.  That's rare in an Anime.

Watch ""Chobits"".  It's fun, heartwarming, etc, and really funny when ""Chi"" is mimicking the Male Idiot's antics in her attempts to learn how to behave.  Who knows, you may even disagree with my assessment of the finale.  You'll agree with my criticisms of the Male Idiot though - I can guarantee that.

PS: the music is nice too.

2344145,5,B0009ZE9QM,"My wife and I are in the final episodes of this wonderful anime. It was recommended to us by a friend - a great recommendation.

We purchased the BluRay despite some suggestion that the subtitles were difficult to read. At first that appeared to be so, but in fact I feel that they are simply unobtrusive, but effective. We generally watch in Japanese with English subtitles because we both feel that the original voice work is generally superior with anime. Subtitles are interesting because as I have watched more Anime and picked up an ear for the language as well as being able to recognize many more phrases and words during the dialog, the subtitles seem to fade. I still read them, but I hear the dialog spoke by the character and somehow the full text from the subtitle I read is what I hear. This makes watching in Japanese a pleasure because the original voicing matches the characters so well, and of course the lip-synch is perfect.

That said, the English voice cast for Chobits is an excellent one. In fact when we started the second disc, it automatically selected the dubbed version and it took a minute or two for us to realize that it was the English dub. The voice work on the dub matches the original character voices pretty well, although there is something intangible about the vocal quality of Japanese voice actresses that is never repeated by western actresses. Male characters in Anime often have a certain manic quality that seems to be something that the Japanese voice actors can handle with ease, but Western voice actors somehow just can't quite get. With Chobits, the English voice work is excellent however, and well matched and really does a good job of replicating the feel of the original Japanese presentation.

The story of Chobits is very touching, and the series explores the themes of human interaction with technology. It looks at what happens when technology allows us to create personal computing devices that look and move like humans, but function as a combination of all the mobile smart devices and desktop computing devices we own. They are called Persocoms and of course because they look and move like humans, they are made in both genders and inevitably, they are aesthetically pleasing. In other words, they can be quite cute. The central question relates to how humans react to the Persocoms in their life, and how they form relationships. The series looks at how society might change, and how human relationships might change.

The central characters are Hideki - a 'good guy' who'd moved to Tokyo for College and is currently cramming his way through prep-school for a year, and Chi - a Personcom Hideki finds abandoned in a pile of trash. Chi starts off with no memory or knowledge of herself, or anything else. She is a blank canvas and has to learn everything from scratch - including learning who she is, and what she wants. Of course the central story is that of Hideki and Chi, how Hideki helps Chi to learn and grow, and their relationship - which is both complex and incredibly simple at the same time.

Overall, the story is quite well done, the animation is excellent, and Chi is a completely endearing character. There are lots of small touches in the animation and dialog that connect with previous scenes. These touches grant the story and characters lat much more depth.

Chobits is not a comedy, but there are lots of laugh out loud moments - mostly at Hideki's expense. It's not a harem drama, despite the number of female characters that revolve around Hideki. It is a very gentle romance with deeper thoughts on technology and it's effect on society and human-kind.

The package for Chobits is relatively plain. The cover is reversible, and there are special features on the final disk, though I have yet to watch those. The menu's are quite plain, and on the PS3 at least, the audio options menu uses an extremely small character type face. But these are minor complaints about the packaging. The important part of the package here is the Anime itself, and it is simply excellent.

I would recommend this to anyone that likes Anime, especially those that prefer their anime to be the kinder, gentler, more whimsical kind. There are laughs, and moments of deep emotion, you become attached to the central characters and the show can make you think. To me, those are all traits of something special these days.

So now, I approach the final disc, and I wait to see what the future holds for Chi and Hideki and their friends. The story is hotting up as we get through the last 13 episodes. I must admit, I pity those who viewed episodically on TV because waiting a whole week to find out what happens next would be pure torture.

If you are an Anime fan who likes Anime other than the action series, then Chobits is definitely worth your money. Chi wants you to buy it, she doesn't want to say that, but you can see it in her eyes, she'll be happy if you do...",1312243200,7,4932,4.665132336018412
2344146,5,B0009ZE9QM,"First off, this is a remaster of the SD version of the anime, so no matter what kind of magic they pull off, it will not look as good as anime series that were meant for HD such as Highschool of the Dead unless they re-do the whole series. For example, the movie Independence Day, the blu-ray version looks a lot sharper, but it won't have state of the art visual effects unless they are re-done.

With that out of the way, I bought this blu-ray collection and I'm happy with it. You see, when playing DVDs, sometimes they will ""hiccup"" and you will see a pixelated mess. That's because of the way DVDs are played on your DVD player. Plus, the video and audio is all compressed to fit the discs and to lessen the stress of your DVD player. Blu-ray eliminated the need for compressed audio and video, and the way the disc is played. You now have a clean image and sound.

 In the case of Chobits, it looks slightly better. The colors are vivid, the sound is clearer (when played through an HDMI cable), and the series is as good as ever. Also, the packaging is pretty nice, though the slip out case is a little loose. It also has a reversible cover art. If you have the DVDs, then you may not want to buy the blu-ray version unless you're upgrading your collection. If you don't have any of them, then get this.",1311897600,3,1310,4.274193548387097

2344148,4,B0009ZE9QM,"Chobits is a charming anime series, portraying a world like our own, with a single difference: their personal computers are called persocoms, and are shaped like people, not boring beige boxes.

I bought the DVDs one-by-one as they were released, suffering the agony of waiting for the next one to be released. It's good to be able to get all of the episodes in one set. The Bluray transfer is not a fresh transfer from the source material; I understand this is an upscale of the DVD transfer, but it is a very good one (I thought it was a native high def transfer at first).

Instead of 6 DVDs we get 3 Blurays, which means far fewer disc changes, but they have kept all the extras, so you don't miss out on anything despite only getting half the number of discs.

2344152,5,B0009ZE9QM,"My first experience with this series was three years ago. I originally watched it from a friend and really enjoyed it. However to my dismay the Geneon complete collection went out of print and I was forced to wait for an almost impossible rerelease. But 2011 proved to be a good year when Funimation finally acquired the license for this series.

Read the product description for the synopsis of the series because thats what its there for. Its a fun anime if you want to sit down and laugh for either an episode or two. Plotwise its an interesting look at the relationship between humanity and technology. Basically your enjoyment will come from how much you love wacky romance animes. Chobits blends that wacky romance along with somce serious thoughts about technology. Each episode is either filled with awkward situations, misunderstandings, or drama. For those who have read the manga and haven't watched the anime, the anime is an almost close adaptation of the manga. There are some episodes that have been added in for either enjoyment or filler purposes. You could either see it as random fun with the characters or a side story from the original plot. Another thing to note is that the anime emphasizes more on the comedy while the manga stresses more on romance and the serious aspects of the series.

A few words about the product itself, Amazon needs to change the box art for the dvd version since its the pre-release place holder. Take a look at the blu-ray version and you'll get an idea of what it kind of looks like. Its got a slip cover with a standard size dvd case holding the 4 dvds as well as reversable cover art. Each disc has seven episodes on it with the exception of the fourth disc which only has three. The last disc also contains all the extras like trailers, the three recap epsiodes, and the Chibits short. So you pretty much get everything that has to do with Chobits with this collection.

A few parting words. You can't go wrong with Chobits if you want a series where you can sit down and enjoy a good romanic comedy anime. It'll make you laugh, think about technology, and perhaps warm your heart.",1305504000,3,2136,4.61578947368421
2344153,4,B0009ZE9QM,"Its easy to make assumptions about Chobits from just the first few episode: the main character, Hideki, immediately seems incredibly shallow, loud and seems to have mainly dirty thoughts on his mind.  The primary love interest is found half-naked, has no common sense, and her only purpose is apparently to appear adorably cute, and mimic Hideki, and unknowingly strike suggestive poses.  On top of that, Hideki immediately fantasizes that every girl he meets may be crushing on him.  In short, Chobits at first appears to be a very typical, very generic fan-service laden harem love story.  Luckily this isn't the case, and if it were, I couldn't possibly rate this show 5 stars.

As the story goes on, the supporting characters develop their own complicated stories outside of Hideki, and Hideki's delusions of being the object of affection for every girl are revealed to be just that: delusions.  Chi grows into her own character, eventually learning how to speak, and the proper etiquette for living in society, and taking on a part time job.  And the fan-service... never really goes away, but it does lighten up considerably by the end.

And rather than the story being about how awesome it would be to find a totally sexy, perfect robot girlfriend, the persocoms in Chobits are made imperfect themselves, and a variety of relationships are examined between humans and persocoms, like the rich recluse who's trying to replace a loved one with a persocom made in their image to the woman who was dumped for a persocom.  Ultimately, Hideki himself is redeemable if only because throughout most of the story, as he finds himself playing the supporting character in other people's romances, he takes it all in good stride: he's a good guy all in all, even if his over-the-top reactions and general helplessness get on your nerves.

Aside from being much deeper than it first appears, Chobits looks and sounds great.  The opening theme is memorable and addictive, and the background music is a step or two above being generic or boring.  On top of that, the performances by the English voice-actors are surprisingly decent.  The Blu-ray looks great, and there are no significant imperfections revealed by whatever upscaling has been done.  Many people may remark that the blu-ray release doesn't really look any better than the DVD, and that may be true.  Televised anime series aren't made in a way that upscaling can really improve them a lot the way a blu-ray release can improve the quality of Lord of the Rings or something.  The advantages of having the blu-ray release is that you'll be able to watch Chobits on your blu-ray player into the next generation of media.

I should mention that the reason I give this show only 4 out of 5 stars, isn't for the cheap fan-service, or slow, shallow beginning: Chobits was originally a manga (recently released in 2 omnibus editions from Dark Horse), and a lot of plot details have either been lost or changed in the translation.  Most notable are the changes to the ending, which is pretty awful compared to the original manga; it's confusing and doesn't really make any sense, while the manga is much simpler and better in every way.  I actually recommend the manga over the anime if you're not opposed to manga.  But while the manga has the better story, the anime contains more filler with Hideki and his persocom, which surprisingly are a delight to watch.  Chobits as a whole is a delight to watch, and I urge people not to be put off by it's shallow, formulaic first couple of episodes: it really does get better... until you get to the magical, nonsensical end.  Then I urge people to pick up the manga.",1305331200,13,3660,4.803827751196172

The style perfectly manages to capture both the adorable and the innocent, while still being serious enough for the deeper storyline.

I have the Pioneer-released DVD box set to compare this blu-ray release against and, unfortunately, it seriously disappoints. There is almost no appreciable difference in video or audio quality - the DVD actually looks a bit more vibrant. For a blu-ray, the menus are atrocious - there aren't many options, but with almost no way to tell what you're doing (text change from dark magenta to black, with no highlighting), it's difficult to tell what option you're on, and whether or not you've selected the right one. Where it truly fails, however, are the subtitles. On the DVD release, the subtitles were ugly and chunky, but easily readable. On this release, Funimation (a company that deals only in anime), has opted for illegibility. The font is light (not bold), white in color, and has almost no black stroke around it. Chobits has its darker scenes, but overall the palette is pastel, and these subtitles are unreadable and headache-inducing. It's almost as if they didn't bother to watch their product after putting it together. Subtitles might appear slightly different depending on what device you're using to play your disc, but this was on a PS3 - undoubtedly one of the most common blu-ray players.

If you prefer your anime subbed rather than dubbed, I can't recommend this release unless you're viewing it while using software that allows you to alter size, font, stroke, and color of subtitles.",1305158400,68,1715,4.910344827586207
2344156,5,B0009ZE9QM,"When I saw this being re-released by funimation I was excited and worried for multiple reasons.
As some people know Chobits used to be licensed under the company Geneon but when it went out of business a lot of people were pirating and illegally selling this series and that's why I was happy that Funimation obtained rights and released it so that it would be more difficult for people to sell bootlegged versions of it.
Although it came with a worry, I personally was very attached to the Geneon dub and the voice acting work they did and I was worried that Funimation would redub it. Although I was very pleased to find out that there was no redubing; Chii and Hideki were the same voices I was attached to in the very beginning and I was very happy that I could get a hold of this series legally and support the creators. :3

Ultimately I love this anime, it's one of the few that I enjoyed the ending in. A lot of anime leave a lot to be desired in this department but this one did not fail me~

Second. It's in 1080i that doesn't even look any better than the DVD version. Just the opening and ending credits(TEXT)is the only difference. Even Claymore looks much clearer than this.

Third. It's in Dolby TrueHD 2.0 NOT 5.1...But the audio is clearer.

This to me is not Remastered and If you already have this on DVD and think it will look better because it's on BluRay you will be disappointed.

But on the plus side it's much cheaper than the DVDs I bought a few years back.",1304985600,9,669,4.450819672131147
2344158,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Chobits was one of the few series that really got me hooked on anime, even though it was probably an ""older"" title by the time I saw it. A great series and a very high quality release by Pioneer/Geneon.  However it's been out of print for years and has become very expensive to get your hands on.

Now Funimation has re-released Chobits on dvd and blu-ray at a very affordable price.  I just got my blu-ray set from rightstuf a few days ago and I'm loving it.  The entire series is on 3 discs, which are held in a standard size case.  It came with a nice outer slipcase and the dvd cover is reversible.  The artwork on the discs could be a little more diverse, with all three featuring Chi.

I've watched the first few episodes and so far I think the video and audio quality are great, but honestly I'm not very picky.  The back of the box lists the video as being 1080i high definition, 16x9 (SD Remaster).  Audio: Dolby TrueHD English 2.0, Dolby TrueHD Japanese 2.0.

And for anyone wondering, all the content from the original disc 7 is included on both dvd and blu-ray versions of this release.  Yes, that includes the Chibits special.  Not much else for extras, texless songs and trailers.

Overall this is a great story, which is much more than it seems at first.  And a quality, affordable release by Funimation, makes this a must buy.  Now if only they'd re-release Haibane Renmei someday...",1304121600,22,1399,4.474308300395257

I don't get into details on movies in my reviews, not wanting to ""spoil"" the watching for others. I will, though, say this much: Chobits, while seemingly aimed at younger viewers on a casual look, is really quite an in-depth view at taking advantage of innocence. And alot of light-heartedness in this makes it an almost laugh-out-loud movie, very enjoyable indeed! I recommend this to anyone who has never seen an anime. It's a great first plunge into the genre!

A lot of the great scenes in the manga were left out or lightly mentioned, and a lot of the things in the anime were added for what seems filler. {A comic relief ghost story mystery episode? Really? Wheres scooby doo?} A lot of things about chi, her personality, conflicts and inner monologues were left out which I thought were really valuable to the story and her character representation. The music occasionally toggles between ""elevator porn"" and ""piano music for children"". Sometimes I liked it but sometimes I just wanted to mute it. :P

Negatives aside, it was fun seeing everyone ""live action"" (even though everyone wasn't as cute/felt as developed), and the ending was tweaked just a little differently than the manga.

2344162,5,B0009ZE9QM,"i actually have all 6 original disk to this series and when i see that they plan to release it again, i may have to consider.  this was one of my first series i collected when i really got into anime (along with Fushigi Yugi, and Full Metal Panic!)

the story is about an alternate world where computers and robots are combined into a single entity, the PERSOCOM.  these devices come in all shapes and sized, but the most popular are the human sized models.  they can not only check your email, but cook and do other personal things as well.  our main character Heidiki, is a farm boy going to the big city to go to cram school so he can get into college and off the farm so he does has never seen a PERSOCOM before.  on his first night in the city, he comes across a cute blonde m,odel in the trash, so he decides to take it home (after all it would be recycling).  when he finally finds the on switch (the whole process is hilarious), not only does she turn on, but she does not seem to have any memory and can only say ""Chi"", which becomes her name. his neighbor and new friend, an avid techie, trys to help him but Chi seem to be to powerful for his mobile model Sumommo to access.  This starts the path of the story, and a dire warning from another PERSOCOM maker, ""just because she looks human, don't fall in love with her""

the story starts out light and funny, but along the way it does get darker, and more serious, as Heidiki and Chi work to not only discover why Chi was created, but also his own feelings towards her.  And Chi also has to work out why a series of books called ""The Town with no People"" affects her.  It shows a darker side, not only on human nature, but of technology as well, so be prepared to go down the rabbit hole with this one.

but the series is great for anyone who likes a good romance, with a moral to it.  Watch it and enjoy as Heidiki and Chi try to discover the ""One For Me"".",1295395200,14,1917,4.107238605898123
2344163,5,B0009ZE9QM,"This is a really good show that any anime fan or cartoon lover will enjoy. The show starts off light and fluffy, but underneath the exterior or by the end of the first episode, fans will realize that something dark and sinister is brewing behind the scenes. The story centers around Hideki who is your average Joe and desperately wants a Persocom (A life size version of a Palm Pilot, PDA, Smartphone - whatever one wants to call it). This show was made before the iPhone & Android era, so he basically wants a PDA that he can't afford. PDA's on this show are known as Persocom's and are life size robotic computers that function like human beings with the ability to talk, run errands, etc. (No Wi-Fi included hahaha) These PDAs still use plugs and wires. The Persocoms come in many different forms, tall, short, long hair, blonde, etc. Hideki stumbles upon one in his garbage can one night and decides to take it home with him. However, his Persocom has completely no memory whatsoever. He immediately notices that she is completely different from the rest, but decides to keep her anyways. While other Persocoms operate and act like normal human beings, his is devoid of any emotion. The only thing she recalls is this recurring dream she can't escape from that holds a key to her past. Things start to unravel and the shows light-hearted tone takes a complete turn for the worst that most people probably expected. The shows pace is a bit on the slow side at first. I guess this is due in part that the intention was to show the relationship between Hideki and Chi (His Persocom) as it gradually builds. If one hangs in there, they will surely be rewarded. This show perhaps would have been stellar if it was thirteen episodes, but it ends up being twenty-something episodes. This was originally released by Geneon entertainment. The company has now officially gone out of business, but Funimation has picked up a few of their titles and has been rereleasing them. Most likely there won't be many extras. I have picked up a few Geneon titles rereleased by Funimation and most of them are just the show with no extras.

Great buy, however I wish it would've been from Amazon. My discs had finger prints on each disc, but the boxset itself was in great shape. The discs work and even came with extra insert art. I am a big fan of CLAMP, so I had to add this to my collection. However, I think they could of done better on the animation itself. The characters are the same, and the storyline is the same, but the animation just kind of lacks compared to the manga artwork. I won't give away any of the story, others can spoil it for you.

I do have to say that the english voice acting is believable and acceptable though.

Will her little cybernetic heart eventually find love and happiness from a clueless young yokel ? From the opening credits, we are led to expect a heartwarming - if kinky - love story, with a happy ending.
Instead of that, we are treated to a dark and convoluted whodunit (""it"" being the innocent cutie), along with somewhat uncomfortable allusions ( husbands neglecting their wives for computer ""yummies"" ). Some sequences also border on the supernatural genre.
The conclusion is hard and sobering: humans and androids ( read: Japanese and Gaijin ) are indeed different -as men are from Mars and women from Venus. We can coexist only if we know what each can do and not do. Blind love only brings heartaches.  Some will accept the differences and love anyway...

2344175,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Get Chobits, in this nice 8 disk set that takes up much less shelf space than buying all the DVD volumes separately.

If I were to judge this anime after only seeing the first handful of episodes I would have been skeptical.  Many filler episodes early on made me wonder when they'd get to the point.  I was also reading the manga series at the time, which moved the plot along at a faster pace.

Then the second half came along, and the plot picked up.  A new ending theme song began playing called ""Ningyo Hime"" which remains one of my favorite anime songs.  From here on, the story stayed true to the manga except for a different conclusion.  Once the story was fully covered, I was able to better appreciate the filler episodes for their charming situations and humor.

The look of this series is gorgeous.  I liked the artwork in the manga, but it's definitely a step up to see it in full color and in motion.  The characters are voiced well, adequately bringing their personalities to life just as I imagined them when I read the manga.

The music of this series can be best described as fun.  It's a lively soundtrack with tracks that made me think of old Care Bears cartoons.  It fits the series very well.

2344177,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Chobits is an amazing manga and anime. In fact, it was the first manga series I bought and the first anime DVD series I started collecting. I guess it's what really got me into manga and anime. Trust me, if you like a cute anime, then this is for you. Hideki is a sweet guy who's pretty clueless when it comes to persocoms and Chi is so adorable, you just want her as not only your persocom but your friend.

The plot of the series revolves Hideki Motosuwa, who has recently moved to Tokyo to be a part of a cram school so that he can finally qualify for a university. During the time period of the series, the latest craze is persocoms. Like iPods today, everyone had to have one. Persocoms are human like creations that could function as what you wanted them to. They would be loyal and obey your every command. Hideki is broke so he can't afford a persocom of his own but his luck changes when he finds one in a dumpster. After awkwardly trying to figure out how to turn her on, he manages to get her awake and she hugs him in the cutest way ever. The rest of the series focuses on the relationship between Hideki and Chi. Chi has no data inside her so it's up to Hideki to teach her about life. Although he's not so sure on what he's doing, he teaches her about the basics and even how to speak. He teaches her ""underpants"" and ""take care of yourself"" among other things. Not only are these interactions cute, they are also funny.

This series may be one of the cutest things you've ever seen and there might be some ecchi moments in it, there is actually some deep meaning in them. One theme looming throughout the series is falling in love with someone without being able to have sex. If Chi is touched in her special place, then she will automatically shut off, shutting off the possibility of intercourse. The question is if Hideki can explore her heart without being able to explore her body. Another theme connected to the first is falling in love with someone without them being able to love you in return. This part of the series is heartbreaking and can even make you cry. The overarching theme of the series is the relationship between humans and persocoms and the ability to love. Persocoms come without the ability to feel emotion and this is deeply exlored within the series. Without the ability to feel emotion, it could cause alienation for a persocom, paralleled by the stories that Chi reads. Cleverness is no problem for the writers of Chobits and after watching it, it can really make you think.

Besides Chi and Hideki, Chobits offers many colorful characters to fall in love with: Shimbo, another sweetheart who attends cram school with Hideki and becomes his best friend; Sumomo, Shimbo's persocom who is so perky and so cute; Ms. Hibiya, the lwho is always andlady looking out for Hideki and especially Chi who always seems to be in a good mood; Minoru, the child expert on persocoms who Hideki goes to for advice and many other great characters.

Chobits is one of the best animes to ever surface from Japan and is the prime example of a great shoujo anime. Definitely worth the watch, this anime can make you laugh, feel cute and even make you cry. It's got everything from love, loneliness and life. Chi is the cutest thing ever and Hideki will make you laugh. I would also recommend the manga since the have very similar storylines [only a few differences].

2344180,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Chobits is easily one of the best anime to have ever to come out. Chobits is about your typical country pumpkin goes to the big city to study for college entrance exams. In the city nearly everyone has human looking computers known as persicoms. Persicoms are the wonder machines of their age, able to anything and everything. They act and look so human that some people prefer them over humans. And of course or country pumpkin wants one. Unfortunately as expected persicoms cost a fortune to buy. Thus our Hideki gives up on getting his desire to get his hands on one until he finds one in trash. Seizing the opportunity Hideki ""liberates"" the periscom from the garbage takes it home. Once there he notices that the persicom is very very beautiful girl. Once figuring out how to turn her on he thinks his prays have come true. It then he gets his first problem, the persicom is basically a blank slate and can only say ""Chi"". Thus he names her Chi, and Chi is the cutest anime character I have ever seen! She is just so dang cute as she does everything Hideki does as she learns how to interact and live. Mysteries however quickly insue as all attempts to figure out how Chi works fail with only the cryptic legend of chobits, persicoms said to be able to feel.
Is Chi a Chobits? If so what does that mean? And a whole list of things problems set in. From Getting Chi some clothes to keeping off perverts and figuring out just what she is. For the most part Chobits is a clean series with only a few out of place naughty jokes. The animation clearly that of its original creators CLAMP is clean crisp and possessing their singular smoothness. The music is somewhat forgettable. The plot is interesting as are the characters. The voice actors rather good. The philosophy somewhat interesting, asking such question as can a machine feel and such.
 The only real flaw being how much they left out from the manga. For instance the omission as to the purpose of the chobits. The relationship between the two syndicate persicoms and stuff like that. But I'm nit picking. The thing that gets on my nervs the most has to do with philosophy bit. Warning people may get ticked at this. Scientifically emotions are hormonal conditional responses triggered by the subconscious to external stimulus reacting as it learned is appropriate. In other words fundamentally there is every little if any difference between the reaction of a computer programed to react in a certain way from a human's reaction. So that knowledge kinda kills that question for me. Chi is sentient and acts in ways that portray emotion and claims to feel so good enough for me.

Well, I have been proven wrong on certain occasions but this time, I was right on spot.

After renting volume one of the series on blockbuster, I actually bought the ""Chobits complete collection"", and boy believe me, I was not a bit disappionted. The series is full of comedy, romance, drama and so-called fantasy. The main characters are just too cute (I especially adore Chi and Sumomo). There are tons more cute persocoms around, so what is there not to like?

Half the time I was in fits of laughter at the main characters antics and half the other time I was in tears at some of the heart wrenching tragedies that happen to some of the characters.  The scene where the guy who got married to the persocon, that starts losing its memory of him, and then saves him in a traffic accident at the last minute had me bawling my eyes out as she lay dieing in his arms.  Emotional moments in the series are fueled by stirring and evoking music.  I still get a little weepy every time I listen to Ningyo Hime.  You'll know why if you watch chobits. (Blows nose, wipes eyes)  On that note the music is excellent and I'm still listening to the soundtracks to this day.

You really do start to care about the main characters in this series as it progresses and YOU WILL watch it to the end to find out what happens.  Will they - won't they?

All in all, this is a love story from start to finish but true to real life it is filled with the bad things that realistically could happen in such a situation.

You can also see 'that' reality happening in real life at some point in our future, when computers become so advanced that pdas are developed into machines that resemble real people.

Thought provoking stuff.

The mini mobile persocon called sumomo is absolutely brilliant and hilarious!  She really brings chobits up a notch and is entertaining throughout the entire series.  I REALLY want one of those :-)

Oh and for any females reading this, you see the main character and the way he thinks about girls, that really is how most teenage guys think...seriously, you have been warned.  But its funny from a male perspective too.

As a long time cartoon viewer I'll give it 5 stars because its the first cartoon in a LONG time that made me laugh out loud and cry out loud too.  And I don't do that in general.

As stated in other reviews no one under 13 should really be watching this.",1138924800,5,1995,4.369565217391305
2344188,5,B0009ZE9QM,"Awsome anime. I may be a guy but I still like a quote ""chick flick"", even more so since its still anime. The love story here is top notch, grade A, premium choice. Sadly it left me wanting more, but thats just how I am, the ending was great. Yet I still want more, sorta an after story as it were. Well all in all its one of the best.",1137888000,7,334,3.7857142857142856
2344189,5,B0009ZE9QM,"This is an excellent series. Chobits is cute and fun, yet dark and sad in some places. It actually made me cry during a certain episode, which really surprised me. It has an excellent mix of emotion, and really plays on main character Hideki's strange love for Chii. Although this is a wonderful anime, I would suggest to keep it away from children under 13, or if your children are sheltered or immature. The reason: Chobits contains alot, and I mean ALOT of perverted and sexual content. Nothing ranchy really, just porn magazines, girls on guys, guys on girls, student teacher relationships going farther than studying, etc. It is humorous though, at least to me. I would recommend this to anyone with a love for anime.",1137196800,2,722,4.738095238095238
2344190,5,B0009ZE9QM,"hello there I agree with some reviews but you do infact get all the dvds pluse tht cool vocal ost from chobits in a thin pack and considering your savin money tht is fantastic not to mention shelf space, now considering most thin packs usually have 1 less dvd and less or no extras of em this is a pretty cool deal seein as you get all of the actual dvds tht would normally be in the normal dvd set",1135814400,2,398,3.9875
2344191,4,B0009ZE9QM,"I'm a hudge anime fan, and Chobits is the best anime in the world. The concept its self is creative. Athough it does have some risque stuff in it (if u know what I mean). The characters, music, and scenery is amazing. The good thing about it is each episode if a completly different. They each have a different concept about them. I think if there is a anime fan looking for a new anime this is a great one to choose. Or even if your looking for a good show to watch I would pick this one. Everbody who isn't a mom or dad this is good one to watch.",1134950400,3,548,3.945945945945946

8070828,4,B0009ZE9QM,"I believe that the manga was the first manga I ever bought/read. To this day, it is still one of my favorite manga series. The anime lives up to the manga series. Yes, there are some filler episodes and a bit of needed subplot, but it is enjoyable. The Blu-rays themselves aren't the best quality. But, it's nice to have.",1515628800,,321,4.366666666666666
