6994367,5,B00SXYM6P2,"Bruce Dern is the old codger you'll love to hate (well, at times!), with Genevieve Bujold the slightly wacky lover of everything Egyptian (seriously). As Bruce's character Austin Kittredge Sr. remarks, he and his wife may bicker more than most couples, but they've been together for a long, long time! When young Austin Kittredge III comes to live with these two grandparents of his, he's in for a VERY interesting change in scenery and life.

More than once, Austin Sr. (Bruce Dern) refers to himself as the ""meanest old b*stard in Kingdom County,"" but truly, he has a hidden heart of gold, too. A very rewarding film and story.",1428105600,9,629,4.770642201834862

6994369,3,B00SXYM6P2,Good acting. Was hoping for more of a feel good ending. Movie was ok but could have done more with the story line.,1512518400,2,114,4.0

6994374,1,B00SXYM6P2,"One of the worst movies I have ever sat through.  If I hadn't been in my friend's living room, I would have turned it off after the first half hour.  A school in 1956 using McGuffey's Readers and slates?  Production of slates dropped drastically in the US by 1900 due to the cheaper production of paper.  Seriously?  A farm without electricity in 1956?  Seriously?  My grandparents in Maine didn't have running water or modern toilets but they had electricity.  Rural Electrification Act ring a bell?  That tiny boy driving that big ass truck?  Give me a break.  A truck that size without power steering would have beyond the strength of that tiny boy.  Anybody who has ever driven a manual transmission, no power steering, old truck can testify to have much physical strength driving takes.  If the movie had taken place in 1936, maybe, but 1956?  Doubtful.  Never mind, the lack of real human characters.  Two dimensional cartoons all of them.  This movie is absolutely terrible beyond description.",1511740800,,1000,4.857142857142857
6994375,2,B00SXYM6P2,Feeble plot. Slower pace than I care to watch. Poor acting by several of the characters - like they were reading their scripts off a cereal box. Poor dialogue. Do not believe that the characters would wear the attire that they did; detected a hint of southern drawl in the Elizabeth character; everyone was too clean (and the house as well) for a place with no electricity. Adds up to a lousy movie.,1511654400,,399,4.47945205479452
6994376,2,B00SXYM6P2,Good acting but not my taste in films.,1511568000,,38,3.875
6994377,5,B00SXYM6P2,"What I liked the least was the main description of the film.  Whoever wrote it didn't see the film or has no patience with eccentric people.  I almost didn't watch it because of that description, but read a couple of customer reviews and gave it a shot.  It was lovely and not at all about a boy trying to escape a farm.  Bruce and Genvieve were great and so was Seamus - the boy who may or may not have escaped the farm.

Does Amazon pay someone to write those descriptions?",1511568000,3,475,4.175824175824176

6994380,1,B00SXYM6P2,Pretty dull and boring movie. Description states that Austen must plan his escape but I never really caught that part...didn't seem to be trying to escape to me. Dern is smiling in the cover photo but doesn't smile at all in the movie and there is a dog on the cover shot and I never seen a dog in the movie. Seemed like they filmed a bunch of scenes and edited them together in a random order.,1510358400,,394,4.12987012987013

6994389,5,B00SXYM6P2,"Northern Borders is my favorite Howard Frank Mosher novel. When I was young, I worked on a hill farm  in the town of West Barnet. It was my Labrador. The movie is beautifully done and represents a way of life that few will ever know.",1461369600,,233,4.177777777777778
6994390,5,B00SXYM6P2,"He was Damien in the Movie, the Omen.  Now, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick appears as Austen Kittredge III in Northern Borders that seems to be due to his exceptional acting talent for challenging scripts of environment.  I grew up in the Northern areas; I have relatives who live in New England.  It may seem novel, but in real life there are places similar to the setting as portrayed in Northern Borders.  Remote towns that are connected only by railroad stops and dirt roads with landscapes proliferated with the stone remains of past buildings.  Bruce Dern and Genevieve Bujold  were superb in the role of Grandparents who are remote in lifestyles and very antithetical about modern behaviors or amenities.  It is an excellent portrayal of New England wilderness where a Maple Syrup Festival is so typical in remote towns. It is the precocious acting of Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Austen that enables the viewer to make sense of a cacophony of incidents and disconnected people in the movie.  It was the perfect setting for Austen to experience once-in-a-lifetime adventures and expose several secrets of strange, unusual relatives.  The viewer should follow the role of Austen with close scrutiny to have a semblance of understanding about the panoply of other characters he encounters.to have thorough benefit of this movie which is indeed for a boy coming-of-age.  The only disappointment I had was no subtitles in English or other languages.  Otherwise, it still rates 5 stars!""",1458345600,5,1482,5.133333333333334

6994392,2,B00SXYM6P2,Movie was pretty good but it was interrupted about 15 or 20 times for loading. That took the enjoyment out of watching  the film  If I knew that was going to happen I wouldn't have rented it,1446249600,,190,4.108108108108108

6994395,5,B00SXYM6P2,"The folks who think this movie was terrible are either too much into the fantastical world of cinema or to fragile to accept true life.  I often wondered the direction  than decided to take it in from Austen (Tut- the spitting image!) stand point.  This isn't a linear movie moving from the beginning to the next.  This is every day life.  Great acting sure the kids weren't ""killing it"" but look at this film for what it is.  A movie about a boy living on a farm with really great characters in his life.",1441584000,4,505,4.319148936170213

No wonder nobody's ever heard of it.  No perceptible story-line, dull direction and script, and a tremendous waste of talent.  What a pity.",1440288000,2,285,4.62
6994398,5,B00SXYM6P2,"Austin didn't ask for or want others' opinions and neither, I believe, did Abiah. Their silences and fewer words held me close throughout the movie, and young Austin never played the easy, superficial part he could have. He was as complete a boy as his grandparents were a couple of 50 years could be expected to be. I loved this movie and will watch it again and, most likely, again and again. I'm 68 and have been married for 33 years so it was familiar and touching though very different from our lives. I hope you will make time for it, and take your time with it.",1435708800,2,568,4.317757009345795

6994402,2,B00SXYM6P2,"I thought for sure I'd enjoy this film since I like Dern and Bujold.  Nope.  This film was awful.  Terrible acting, especially from the kids.  Plot was disjointed and went nowhere.  Waste of time.",1433030400,,196,4.647058823529412
6994403,4,B00SXYM6P2,"This is an interesting film for several reasons
1. It shows the ever changing beauty of old Vermont
2. Much of this film was made and produced with Marlboro College students,who got credit for this film.
3. There is excellent acting in a film with little or no plot.

Bruce Dern, plays Grandpa, 'the meanest ba*%tard of the Nortern Kingdom'. He works his farm, and his wife played by Genevieve Bujold, who shows her true beauty in old age, has a fascination for all things Egyptian. Into their lives in this rural part of Vermont comes their grandson, Austen Kittredge III, played by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick. Seamus is the star if this film, an amazing young actor who brings life to this old farm and his grandparents. They do not talk to each other after some sort of quarrel, and Austen plays the go between. He enriches their lives, and he is enriched by theirs.

This is a coming of age film, directed by Jay Craven. It is not for everyone, and it may be that New Englanders will enjoy it. However, the acting chops shown in this film are excellent. It drags at times, and it is difficult to understand the point of the film ,but there are redeeming qualities.

Recommended. prisrob 05-31-15",1433030400,6,1197,4.610328638497653
6994404,5,B00SXYM6P2,"Jay Craven does a beautiful job of capturing a young boy's relationship with his grandparents. Funny, moving, beautifully paced film.
One of Bruce Dern's best performances and Bujold is brilliant as always",1432771200,,205,5.4375
6994405,3,B00SXYM6P2,"Northern Borders w/Bruce Dern  -- This is an okay movie, nothing to shout out about.  It fills a few hours if you have nothing to do.  We did watch it all the way through, so that scores an average rating.  If we had stopped it, it would have been1 star. Perhaps, it didn't catch me because it is a dark movie, not light at all.",1432684800,3,328,4.0
6994406,1,B00SXYM6P2,"This was seriously not the stupidest movie I have ever seen but it runs a close second.  No plot, no direction and no clue what the purpose of this movie was even about and the people were mean.  Nothing redeeming.",1430265600,,214,4.325

8699787,5,B00SXYM6P2,"I have seen a good number of films in my life, but I have never ever seen a film that closely resembles my childhood.  I cannot recall the number of times I saw myself in that film when I was a boy. This even included the scene where the boy spent the night in a chicken coop because of a snake and I, too, spent a night in our chicken coop because of a weasel. Even the scenery which was beautiful, matched my childhood home, and speaking of the title ""Northern Borders"" I too lived just a couple miles from a northern border. The grandparents (Bruce Dern, Genevieve Bujold) did an outstanding job getting on each other's nerve, which put the boy in somewhat of a dilemma on who should he side with. But throughout all of this the love and respect for each other greatly abound, making this a great movie.",1521072000,,806,4.302631578947368

8699791,4,B00SXYM6P2,"Genevieve Bujold shines in this movie as does Bruce Dern.  The little boy is ok, but his father's and aunts' characters do not ring true.  They seem like very unlikely offspring of these strange but stern people and the stern beauty of northern New England is lovingly portrayed.. The land itself is its own character  Although there is little in the way of a plot  I found this a gem of a movie. An elegy to a place and time which seems remote and yet is so near to us.",1517097600,,470,4.188888888888889

8699795,4,B00SXYM6P2,"I thought that it was very thought provoking. The best actor was the boy who had to become grown up in a short time. Loss of friendship, loss of being able to live with his father, loss of grandparent. Understanding adult struggles which is hard for young boys or girls for that matter. The boy showed heart and compassion in all his struggles to grow and understand his situation",1513814400,2,380,4.521739130434782
