3685467,5,B001LL9R74,"I recommed this honest, thought provoking, non-sentimental look at life and love through the eyes of a young man with severe physical and medical challenges.  It explores profound questions about freedom vs. security, about love between two people (mother/son, girlfriend/boyfriend)and how it gets expressed when one party is completely physically dependant on the other.  Does the ""freedom to take risks"" define human adulthood? How does one person's need for life-sustaining care and another person's need to be needed combine / collide?  How does a parent who has devoted decades of her life to that child's physical care come to terms with her adult child's need for independence, self-expression, privacy, a life apart?

I work for a disability service agency, and we will be using this video to spark awareness and discussion.",1250208000,4,832,5.32824427480916
3685468,3,B001LL9R74,"This American Life was the first radio shows with which I became absolutely enthralled, revolving my Saturday morning schedule around its airing until other means of listening came along. So I was happy about Showtime picking at up, and not at all skeptical that a TV version would disappoint.

And it didn't, at first. Season one of the television show did not disappoint, and neither, truthfully, did season two. If I were to judge season two by nixing any preconceived notions about This American Life (either in radio format or the format laid out by season one of the TV show).

Something in season two was lacking for me right off the bat. It remained pure speculation as to why season two did not strike the same chord with me. I finally figured out that it was lack of Ira Glass's narrative. You see, the DVD has a live presentation as a bonus feature. And in it I see Chris Wilcha (co-director of the TV  version) and Ira Glass discussing how they chose in season two to have Ira Glass be involved as little as possible(!).

This was the profound difference between season one and two. Chris Wilcha and Showtime mistakenly believed that it was wise to relegate Ira Glass to the background as much as possible, instead of letting him narrate the show as he had done in season one. From what I gathered, those whom had misgivings about a TV version agree that episode one of first season soothed those fears. The show was still lovable. No matter how many moving pictures were added, it was definitely still This American Life. Believing that Ira Glass wouldn't surrender so much creative control, I had none of these misgivings and the TV show did not disappoint-- in season one. That was season one though.

Showtime, in the second season, has chosen to deviate from the format that worked so well for them in the first season. Chris Wilcha basically stated that the photography should speak for itself in the TV version of the show and that little to no narrative by Ira was necessary or desired. I couldn't disagree more. Season one worked for the same reasons the radio show works. Ira Glass. While he isn't absolutely *needed*, you could say the same for the moving photography of the Showtime show-- it too, isn't absolutely necessary. The new way they have Ira Glass introducing the show, as though the story is an ""afterthought"", left me feeling cheated, as well as ""cheapening"" the overall quality of the introductory narrative segments.

Ira, in my opinion, is more necessary to the show than the filmography, and his inclusion is paramount to keeping the spirit of the show alive in any format. No Ira, or very little Ira, will equal a failed This American Life. I don't say this as a radio or television fan. I say this as a fan of ""This American Life"", with our host, Ira Glass.

I have bought season one three times- once for myself, and twice as gifts for others. I also bought season two. Once, for myself. I will not be buying it again. Though the content is up to par- amazing, poignant, entertaining- and the DVD comes with a variety of bonus features including audio commentary and the option for HDTV, watching it with the minimum of Ira's proud and comforting voice punctuating the story (sadly, in most segments he isn't included at all- a deliberate choice, they explain in the bonus ""live"" excerpt.) is just not the same show. This renders some episodes that would normally be extremely compelling into nearly unforgettable weakened versions of what I imagine its creators envisioned. It's now like ""every other television show"". These changes are an unwelcome shift away from not just what worked in season one, but from the spirit of the radio show as well.

Save your money. The radio version needs it more than Showtime. (The radio version is hosted by WBEZ and PRI, not NPR, as many believe.)

I for one will be watching the DVD for the bonus inclusions, which are pretty stellar. If there are more Showtime seasons planned, I cannot imagine them being as gripping as the first season was if they continue to deviate wildly from the format of season one. Season one was truly in keeping with the spirit of TAL. Season one WAS, ""This American Life, with your host, Ira Glass.""

Season two? Eh, not so much.",1248912000,22,4243,4.660427807486631

3685470,2,B001LL9R74,"Basically, season 2 is plagued by the same lack of care in making the DVD as season 1 was, but the content itself is also not nearly as good.

3685471,5,B001LL9R74,"I still remember when I first came across the radio show for This American Life.  My wife and I were first dating, and, coming back from a movie, we sat in the car from 11pm to midnight, listening to the story that so captivated.  In the 12 years since, I have never missed an radio show.

Ira Glass has taken his ear for story and married it to a beautiful eye.  Each episode this season is lovingly filmed, the themes running through each episode are familiar, yet meaningful, and the stories will stay with you for most of your life.

From the first episode in the series, ""Escape"", which chronicles the life of an young man striving to be on his own but constrained by a disease that leaves him physically helpless, to the last episode in the series, ""Meet John Smith"", which chronicles a year in the life of 7 men named John Smith at different ages, this is what you Edward R. Murrow must have hoped TV would become.

Not a wasteland of reality TV shows and laugh tracks, but a respectful and deep record of the dignity and challenges surrounding everyday life.

I got this season on iTunes, but I would highly recommend that you pre-order this season.  You will not be disappointed.",1241222400,14,1188,4.467592592592593
3685472,4,B001LL9R74,"""This American Life, Season Two""
(Showtime, 2009)
-------------------------------------------
Like many fans of the PBS radio show, ""This American Life,"" I have to struggle with myself regarding my feelings about the television version of the unique, irony-filled documentary program. Having watched the first two seasons of the TV show, I am still partial to the original radio program, which engages me more on an imaginative plane -- however, the Showtime program is still provocative and consistently surprising. This season seems less dependent on wacky imagery to compensate for thinner narrative structures, although the cinematography is still quite nice. The stories are frequently uncomfortable -- the first program is about a child who has a progressively degenerative skeletal disease; watching this bright, funny person trapped inside a crumbling, constrictive body is quite difficult, but also quite moving. Likewise, an episode that captures a marriage as it implodes is mesmerizing yet sad. The season finale is an ambitious project, in which several people of different ages -- from an infant to a senior citizen -- who all share the name ""John Smith"" have their life stories stitched together in a way that suggests a continuous narrative. The conceit is clever, but the concept seems somehow exploitative and misleading, particularly in sequences such as when ""John"" makes the unlikely transition from drug-rehabbing slacker to high-tech exec at Microsoft. There are some similar themes -- dealing with health issues, raising children -- but the John Smiths do not cohere into a working composite, and ultimately viewers may wonder what the point really was.  Regardless, the show is still puckish and unique, and certainly more of a legitmate ""reality show"" than the tawdry contests seen on the networks.  Definitely worth checking out. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)",1236729600,2,1896,5.489726027397261
3685473,4,B001LL9R74,"This American Life is easily the best show on the radio, and with season 2 it can safely be said that its television adaptation joins the ranks of the best on that medium as well. While Season 1 faltered slightly, constrained too much by the differences in format and perhaps a bit too indulgent in stories that weren't as interesting as the producers thought, Season 2 is nothing short of astonishing. It's funny, it's deeply moving, and introspective about what makes us all human. The final, longer episode, ""John Smith"", reduces me to a sobbing mess every time I watch it. It's simply one of my favorite pieces of film ever made, ever, and I've spent the better part of my life sifting through eclectic movies and television.

Unfortunately somebody at CBS DVD made the bone-headed decision to stuff all six episodes onto a single disc, which is a shame. With almost five hours worth of video including the extras, it's very over-compressed and some of the gorgeous cinematography really suffers. I would kill for a Blu-Ray of this series. Or even the exact same thing on a two-disc set.

With that limitation in mind, you simply need to see this show. Skip season one and head straight for this extremely low-priced disc. You will not regret it.",1233100800,26,1250,4.729357798165138

A story about making history with dental floss will have viewers shaking their heads.  Some stories are simply interesting while others are profound and thought provoking.

3685812,1,B001LL9R74,"I purchased this episode not noticing that the Amazon product details note the episode length as 16 minutes, when the actual episode when aired on Showtime was 30 minutes long.  The on demand episode stops at 15 minutes and 40 seconds, in the middle of a segment, in the middle of someone's sentence.  The comedian Mike Birbiglia who is said to appear in the episode never appears in the 15 minutes and 40 seconds of footage.

8318489,4,B001LL9R74,"The series continues. The production of this series, I find, is interesting. First, it opens up with the Ira Glass sitting outside, at a desk, near where the story takes place. Everything about it is low-keyed, from his outside desk, calm narration, to the visuals and shots (perspective of the director, camera angle) to precisely only what is necessary about each episode. Not all stories are created equal, so that some of these stories don't have much impact for some, some have less an ending and more of a halt, or an unfinished detour, just like real life sometimes does.

And again, each tells a story, a story about the varity, uniqueness, individuality, sadness, strength, good/bad beginnings,endings, incorporating all of life. There are surprises that hurt, and bad things that happen that sometimes offer a good change or silver lining. Most often these are stories are simply about life, without impact, that just shows who we are, what we do and what might hold us together.
I think it can make one think just a smidgeon differently about our lives, or someone else's.
But, one needs to watch in order to find the telling of the purpose of a small rock, or a precious gem, or loss (and/or) redemption, lost dreams and only imagined hopes, dreams, scenarios.

In each episode there is one of these and more. Often a fork in the road, undiscovered(unseen) or unchosen, is forgotten, or all too remembered.
Whatever these stories bring out, or not, there is always another one to ponder. If one appreciates life, its encounters, and anything, everything that can come from them, then you might find something in these simple narratives.
Life, as history, is a meta-narrative. As only a very small piece of it, it can be big as a brief mention.",1485820800,2,1755,4.827242524916944
