Combustible gases present during offloading are a major danger - often these ships perform this task off a coast.

Oil tankers played a major military role in WWII for the U.S.  After the war, most were bought by shipping tycoons and continued in a civilian role - often after having their capacity doubled through hull extensions.  In the late 1970s, demand dropped and a number of brand new tankers were immediately scrapped.

Innovations now include double hulls, double rudders, double engines, and inert gases to prevent explosions.  LNG tankers are now becoming a factor in energy transport.  However, experts see the energy transport business declining as oil production peaks and then declines.",1225065600,2,866,5.2773722627737225
