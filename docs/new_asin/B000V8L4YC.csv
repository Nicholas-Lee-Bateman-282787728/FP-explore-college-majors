8217223,1,B000V8L4YC,"Down to the cover art, this is a RIP OFF of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World....just look at the scene where everybody stands around the money...that's the cover art.

I think it's meant to confuse people. Just noting. If you were looking for the classic movie with ""The Big W""...then look elsewhere becuase THIS AIN'T IT!!!

UPDATE - apparently they changed the cover art since I originally put review in...but beware the title...it's still not what you think.",1296691200,27,457,4.7
