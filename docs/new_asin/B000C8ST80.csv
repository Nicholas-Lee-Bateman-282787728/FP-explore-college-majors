The Chinese film ""The World"" is set in an amusement park that offers its patrons the opportunity to ""experience the whole world without ever leaving Beijing.""  This it accomplishes through monorail tours of miniaturized replicas of the Eiffel Tower, The Taj Mahal, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Vatican, even the Manhattan skyline complete with a pair of still-intact Twin Towers.  The movie focuses primarily on a young woman named Tao, who works as one of the performers who roams from ""country"" to ""country"" throughout the park performing native dances (her specialty appears to be Indian), and her rocky relationship with a security guard named Taisheng.

The main problem with ""The World"" is that the setting is so intriguing and visually arresting that it winds up completely dominating the drama, which is as diffuse, meandering and plodding as the direction by Zhang Ke Jia, who shoots his scenes almost exclusively in impersonal medium shots.  There's a certain sad irony in the fact that the movie's characters are stuck working in a bizarre facsimile of the world when all they really yearn for is to travel to exciting and far-off places - and start new lives - beyond their own land (the park even features, as one of its attractions, an old defunct jetliner that people can sit in and pretend they're actually going somewhere).  Unfortunately, with the movie clocking in at a seemingly interminable 138-minute running time, it is WE THE VIEWERS who ultimately feel trapped by the experience.

There are a number of lyrical moments and haunting images in the film, and Ke Jia does capture with full force the astonishing strides China has made in joining the technological revolution (all the characters have the most up-to-date cell phones, for instance).  But all the peripheral virtues of setting and theme can't compensate for the overweening dullness and listlessness of the drama at the core.",1167696000,8,1919,5.050632911392405
2453872,4,B000C8ST80,"Chinese from the provinces live in the new capitalist world of Beijing.  It is not so much represented by economic growth as by symbolic and material change, specially the use of cellular phones.  Society is still in a transformation phase, when women start to act as legal prostitutes using sex to advance and men start to steal, die, kill, or pay accordingly.  Not showing how was life in the provinces makes difficult to compare with the actual situation of the protagonists, but the antagonism is nevertheless expertly crafted by opposing the fantasy world of a theme park with the real life of its workers.  The most important theme in this film is the relationship people have with money once the process of capitalist social differentiation is put in motion.  Some of them prefer to sacrifice comfort for old values (as love or family) and others go with the current, because they don't have options or because they want to live a better material life.  Beijing seems an oppressive place to live, a monster that transforms its citizens in an anonymous mass of workers, like a futurist dystopia (and is not communism the responsible here!) The mix of personal poverty with superficial opulence for tourists seems lethal for the construction of a positive life-story (a narrative): the options seem to consist in escaping abroad or being subservient to somebody more powerful (in general, women to rich men).  Governmental policy seems to be the only barrier between dozens of millions of migrants and the developed world.  The creation of this longing for the outside world comes together with the development of Chinese capitalism, and the theme park is only the symptom of the phenomenon, giving our heroes a little respite from the life of the metropolis in construction.  Beautifully filmed in DV, ""The World"" is a statement against the way in which some societal changes are made by unseen people that forgets how they affect to the big (in this case, the really big) part of the population.",1153699200,3,2002,4.934523809523809
2453873,5,B000C8ST80,"I'm shocked by some of the reviews here, but not necessarily surprised - The average filmgoer/dvdwatcher has the attention span of a small child on crack & the intellectual curiosity of those small dustbunnies that collect under old furniture. Still, I expect more from you people.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film - & yes, I wasn't actually expecting to. In fact I bought it more than a month ago & kept making up excuses not to watch it. Imagine my surprise when I found myself intrigued by some of the relationships in the film. Tao's boyfriend who mysteriously returns at the beginning of the film then disappears for the duration. Or her strange relationship with the Russian woman Anna. Even more interesting was the relationship between Niu & Xiaowei - why did they end up getting married considering Niu's jealous behavior (he set himself on fire for godssake)? Who knows, but these details make for a supremely fascinating character study IMHO. Like real life, this film demonstrates that our relationships can be extremely complex & often unpredictable. We make friends with the most unlikely people in the bizarrest of situations - maybe we're lonely or just sense something of ourselves in them. We get involved with people we know will hurt us (over & over again). We often feel like we can't fully understand the person we're with & their motives...

Of course, The World's relationship angle is also used in a much broader sense: the employees of Beijing's amusement park & their relationship with China & in turn, China's relationship to the rest of the world. It seems to me that as China becomes more capitalistic this movie will gain in popularity with people who wish to understand these people better. Like most of us, they don't quite know where they fit in the world & although they work in a park that offers a scaled-down glimpse of the world outside Beijing, most of them will never get to see that world first hand.",1153612800,19,1941,4.791044776119403
2453874,2,B000C8ST80,"This film is extremely confusing to watch largely because there is no clear narrative thread, the characters are virtually interchangeable and, worse, it is difficult to develop much empathy with any of them so that trying to keep them straight takes just too much effort. Further, I wasn't very interested in the events depicted. They all seemed so pointless and trivial. The only character I cared anything about -- the young man nicknamed 'Little Sister -- got killed. I was relieved when the film was over.",1152403200,3,510,4.941860465116279
2453875,5,B000C8ST80,"giving this 2 STARS on AVERAGE?????  Perhaps you should spend more time at 25 theater GOO-GOO PLEX watchin a Michael Bay Marathon or something.  GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER!!! GO SEE SOME REAL CINEMA!!!! THINK FOR A CHANGE!!!

For those who felt this deserved 2 stars or less I recommend the following: Cache, Raise The Red Lantern, Yi yi, anything by Kurosawa.  oh sorry.. these aren't playing along with all the Adam Sandler films you wanted to see next to the Cold Stone Creamery and the ruby Tuesday you wanted to visit afterward???

WELL TOUGH!!!!  you need a friggin education..

review below.. read it ... you might learn something.

How can you truly show disconnection. I think I have truly seen a master in action with Shijie, a film that takes place in a world theme park (this place does really exist) in China.

Zhang Ke Jia is a masterful director. His use of colour and character direction is unreal. One of the things he uses to great effect are arches and hallways. Characters appear in them, or look out of them in what is some of the most visual photography I have ever witnessed. There is also a great conversation scene between two characters who don't share the same language, and the use of reflected light that is truly remarkable, make sure to watch for this scene. But it doesn't end there.

Zhang also does something so miraculous that I thought would be impossible. He borrows heavily from Ozu, particularly a scene that is reminiscent of Tokyo Story and makes something that is uniquely his own.

The basic synopsis of ""The World"", is of the lives of the workers in the theme park. Some romances develop, a foreign Russian worker Anna is introduced to the group even though she and another Chinese girl Tao don't share the same language. Everyday trials and tribulations happen for these young adults who are trying to work in the 'New China'.

Somehow though with all the issues involved, rural people coming into the cities, technological communication, the erosion of China's agrarian past, the fakeness of place, the exploitation of workers and lead up to prostitution, the camaraderie of friends, the cheapness of life.. somehow all of these themes are jumbled into a glorious presentation that you can't take your eyes off of.

The film is beyond surreal, its real setting makes it all more spectacular and that more effective. I had a hard time separating the actors from the characters, at times I thought I was watching a documentary and I prayed or hoped for someone to do well and be happy and find themselves thinking that these were real people in harsh sometimes difficult situations. ""The World"" has this effect on you, you can't begin to believe the beauty and harshness it shows, and it tricks you in the most crafty way.

The World is a truly fantastic small place in more ways than one...",1148860800,27,2840,4.711111111111111
2453876,2,B000C8ST80,"First of all, I was rather surprised to see this film made it to the 10 best list of some of the local papers. I had hesitated to seeing it until renting on DVD simply because it didn't appeal to me for the following reasons: the story and it starred ""nobody"" that I know. What was appealing to me was The World Theme Park of this film. There are several things I didn't like about this film. It was way too long and slow-paced with multiple plots about the ""showgirls/entertainers"". It chronicles the on-stage and behind the scenes of main characters, and their relationship life outside the park. They didn't speak Mandarin in a regular accent that I had to read the subtitles!!! Most of the scenes played by two actors are shot in one large frame without any other angles and closeups!! There was no subtitles during the  dialogues delivered between the lead actress and the Russian supporting actress. They don't even understand each other's language, and they are supposed to be communicate to each other!! And what's with the animated inserts? OK, what I loved about this film is the outlandish and stunning costumes during the stage performances!!!!!Just think Chinese Zeigfeld Follies meets Priscilla! It was so under underexposed, because everytime they had a show scene, it was just like 15 seconds, while some of the overdragged and boring conversational scenes are like 10 minutes long. So there, I wished I can say I enjoyed this film, but I just wanted it to be over at halftime.",1141344000,6,1493,4.764478764478764
2453877,3,B000C8ST80,"Newset film from Chinese director Zhang Ke Jia ('Platform' 'Unknown Pleasures') is, some say, most accessible one in his works. True, but the touch of the long film is still bleak and detached, going on and on with almost non-existent story about the workers in the eponymous theme park. Critics would admire the feel and perhaps appreciate its anti-globalization attitudes in it, but many viewers like me would find the film awfully pretentious and tedious. My impression happens to be the latter one (hence my lower rating). But of course, you might find the film and its realistic content differently.

Anyway, I have never been to the place myself, but in the suburb of rapidly modernized city of Beijing, there really exists a theme park World Park, where you can see lots of miniature landmarks of the world such as The Eiffel Tower, The Leaning Tower of Pisa, or The Taj Mahal. The catch phase of the place is `Visit the World without leaving Beijing.'

In this small world lives Tao, young girl and dancer working in the theme park. She has a boy friend, the park's guard Taisheng, but `The World' introduces us to many other characters, all somehow trapped in this small-scale artificial `world.' With the film's ensemble fashion that strongly reminds us of Robert Altman, `The World' shows us the background of each character. One is from Russia, but most of them are from rural parts of the mainland China, and as Tao recollects, they all came to the big city with dreams.

But in the bleak world of Zhang Ke Jia, dream means something that these characters never get, and as many viewers would notice, their lives keep going around the same course like the small monorail car that runs languidly around the theme park. Many things (mostly unhappy ones) happen to the people surrounding Tao, but the director often insists on the emotionally detached tone, making some of us wishing for twist and surprises. But in `The World,' for better or for worse, you don't see them, and you don't even see what you call character development because the story is already told before the film begins.

Excuse me for my vague commentary about the story, but there is no way of summarizing it just like the case of `Short Cuts.' And `Short Cuts' is not my favorite film, which would explain my rather negative review. I just don't like long films (`The World' runs 140 minutes) and I don't like pessimistic films (as you expect from Zhang Ke Jia). I gave a try to this one, but couldn't bring myself to give it a second one.

The film's realistic touch is definitely helped by digital camera and the actors' good acting, and the camera always captures the slice of ordinary life of the ordinary people, letting us see the inside of their hearts. Still, these days I'm getting tired of the attitudes of any director who is always looking for the negative aspects in the things surrounding us. And the film's very ending, of which meaning is still unclear to me, but of which shockingly cold touch is clearly intentional, is only the film's mystification of its theme, which is obvious from the beginning. The problem is, do we really need 140 minutes to know that? Or it is worth?",1140998400,6,3177,4.706834532374101
2453878,1,B000C8ST80,"This is worse than a high school student's project. You call this a movie? Was this so-called director ever presented himself while shooting this whatever-you-call-but-definitely-not-a-movie, not a documentary movie is even close. There's no screenplay here either. Those actors and actresses are so bad to a degree beyond your imagination. I've never seen any Chinese movie so bad so far until now. I want my money back but I know it's impossible.

If all the movies turned out to be so bad and could still be called 'movie', then the movie business might not survived another 3 months.

But one good thing might happen though if all the movies turned out being so bad:

The movie piracy business would also come to an end, because nobody would buy anything anymore from the black market.",1139961600,3,789,4.873134328358209
2453879,3,B000C8ST80,"I found this film watchable, but it just seemed to be about a group of Chinese twenty-somethings in unremarkable daily situations working backstage (and onstage) at the 'Five Continents' theme park. One thing I did pick up on was the insidious slogan ""see 'the World' in Beijing"" which seemed to imply that there's no reason to ever leave and explore the life 'outside' China.

Why think about going to the trouble of travelling to London, Paris, New York when the best each country has to offer has all been created for you right there (to sub-scale). And people in other countries think Disneyland is propaganda, at least they have a Fantasyland there instead of recreating the island of Manhattan WITH the World Trade Center (not to mention the 1/3 scale Eiffel Tower dominating the city skyline)!

I can't entirely recommend the movie though the photography and some of the 'spectacle' dance moments are impressive. They definitely milked the mini-'Leaning Tower of Pisa' gag one time too many, but minimalists might enjoy this slice-of-life in a world where security guards can hook up with dancers, for better or worse.

It also seemed ironic to me that the couple that was sparring for the entire film decides to get married, sort of an accident waiting to happen of you ask me. But maybe that was part of incongruity the director set up with the false expectations of a man-made world done to scale with the Beijing tourists exclaiming ""Wow, that's so big"" when what they're seeing is really just a partial scale recreation of London Bridge, etc.

Of course, the main reason the Chinese government would want to re-create all the wonders of the world at home is to discourage applications for exit visa's (and the possible defections that could follow). The film does allude to the black market demand for fake visa's and ID but only minimally.

A bit slowly paced overall considering it's 2 hour plus length, but worth a look for those curious about life inside China.",1139788800,3,1977,4.837278106508876
8096246,2,B000C8ST80,"I wanted to like this one, I really did, the setting was brilliant, a theme park in the suburbs of Beijing, China that is sort of like Epcot or Vegas without the casinos, where Chinese citizens and tourists can visit the world in one place, including a mini Eiffel Tower, Egyptian Pyramid, Leaning Tower of Pisa, Manhattan skyline, they can even experience a replica of an actual plane (that would probably get dated pretty fast with the modernisation of China and more citizens being able to fly in real ones) but anyway the world can be seen without leaving Beijing.  The theme park itself was interesting, I'd definitely go check it out if I went to Beijing (there's a real one there, also one in Hong Kong). I've been to the actual versions of these monuments and I found it weird but fascinating that tourists are doing the same thing as when visiting those places in the actual countries such as putting your hand in the circle thing in Rome to see if its mouth shuts and traps your hand if you've been lying, trying to pose for a photo so it looks like you're holding up the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

But the movie wasn't very interesting, you're pretty much a fly on the wall to employees every day conversations.  You can sit the staff room of wherever you work and experience the same sort of thing.  Doesn't matter that they're Chinese compared to whatever country your living in, they are the same ones in this film.  We start off with a girl being surprise visited by her male friend who is about to travel to Mongolia, departing from Beijing, visiting from whatever rural town they are from, of course her new boyfriend who is a park security guard finds out and needs to force himself into the catch up, hang around like a bad smell and offers to drive the friend to the airport.  Who hasn't had that happen to them or seen that to someone you work with?  Then there's a guy whose friend again is paying a surprise visit to the theme park who has come to Beijing because he met a man who promised him construction work and wants to know why the theme park employee doesn't come home to visit his family.  There's a guy who needs money so pretends he's collecting money owed to his brother.  There's no plot or anything to the movie.  It's like we're watching a documentary (or at least a mockumentary) of the lives of Chinese theme park workers in their 20's who have mostly moved to Beijing from a small town for a more exciting or economically better life.  This could have based in any big city in any country, at any large employer.  To be honest you just get bored of this one after a while.",1470614400,,2609,4.423799582463466

The DVD lists 143 minutes, so this is the longer international version.  The WOrld Park is set outside Beijing, not Hong Kong, as one reviewer wrongly maintains.  This is from the film's press kit: World Park
--provided by the Beijing Foreign Affairs Office
Located in the Fengtai district of Beijing, 16 kilometres from the city, World Park features 106 of the most famous sites from 14 countries and regions the world over. The park, encompassing 46.7 hectares (115.4 acres), consists of two parts : the scenic area in miniature displayed according to the position of its country on the map, and a shopping, dining and entertainment area. The entertainment area is situated in an international folkloric village characterized by buildings in the American and European styles. Tourists can take an electric train and a motorboat through the park to simulate a trip around the world.
The park includes most of the recognized spots of interest on the globe. Among these is the Wooden Pagoda in China's Ying County, the world's oldest and best preserved wooden pagoda; the Leaning Tower of Pisa; the Great Pyramid of Egypt and the Eiffel Tower of Paris. China's Qingyingjing Park, Japan's Katsura Imperial Villa, and an Old Style US garden are grouped together to represent the splendor of the world's different gardening styles and in recognition of the many distinctive forms which landscape gardening has taken in China.
Great efforts were made to build the structures out of the same materials as the real ones. Marble and granite surfaces, together with copper and gilded sculptures, help produce a realistic effect. For instance, the Great Pyramid is made of 200,000 white marble bricks, each as large as a bar of soap. Moscow's Red Square is paved with over 5 million red bricks, each smaller than a mahjong tile. Lawns in the park are dotted with 100 well-known sculptures, among them the Statue of Liberty, Copenhagen's Little Mermaid, Michelangelo's David and the Venus de Milo.
The park also has a fountain operated by laser beams, a plant maze and a fairyland in which children and adults alike can enjoy themselves. Regular international folklore parades are planned to provide tourists with a chance to view folk customs from different countries.",1350691200,2,2338,5.05440414507772

Set in a Chinese theme park recreating the major cities of Europe dominated by a one-third scale replica of the Eiffel Tower and dealing with the employees and their friends, it's really just comes over as a whole lot of nothing. Scenes may be true to life but they're trivial and, like the characters, never really go anywhere. That may well be the point, but that doesn't make watching it easy going. There's possibly something about the globalization of Chinese culture lurking in their somewhere and the contrast between the glamorous face of modern China vs the poor quality of life for migrant workers, but nothing really comes through because the characters are so univolving. Instead it's like watching people out of a bus window on a rainy day while waiting for the traffic lights to change, images washing over you inoffensively but without leaving any lasting impression as you move on.

8096254,4,B000C8ST80,"The World is aptly named; it's set in Beijing's World Park--a real theme park in China's capital, complete with miniature versions of landmark buildings and monuments from all over the world including, in this film, the often-mentioned Eiffel Tower, as well as the pyramids of Egypt, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Moscow's Red Square, the Taj Mahal, and so on.

The director, Zhang Ke Jia, focuses on a number of younger people (in their 20s) who work at World Park, interleaving their lives with each other to ultimately present a vision of 21st century urban China. This has a markedly different feel and tone from his earlier Unknown Pleasures, set in a rural provincial area, and from my point of view, is all the better for that change of setting.

The underlying thematic feel of the film is the inevitability of ephemeral relationships given not so much the availability of current technologies like the cell phone, but more so the reliance on them and, maybe most importantly, the enormous degree to which people's psychologies have been changed by these technologies. In fact, this short-lived nature of relationships, indicates Zhang, is inextricably enmeshed in the existence of World Park itself. People want to see and hear the world, all of the world, as quickly as possible, and World Park gives them that opportunity, even if in a fake kind of way--just like cell phones give people the opportunity to connect to anyone anywhere at any time, just as the Internet itself does.

But it's this instant ""connectability"" that also fosters relationships that cannot last. Tao, the female lead and a dancer at the World Park, has a strong emotional connection with her boyfriend Taisheng, a security guard in the same place. But he cannot commit; he cheats on her; she finds out. Meanwhile, another relationship is characterized by a boyfriend who always wants to know where his girlfriend has been, always asking her the same question--as if desperately trying to reverse this instant ""everywhere at once"" psychology that current technologies--and World Park itself--perpetuates.

This is a truly intriguing film, because it probes more deeply than a lot of other films have managed to do the nature of how globalization has effected a paradigm shift in how we think about our relationships with others, how we see ourselves--or maybe don't see ourselves too well at all--in the context of the world, and how we cope with those around us who have, just like us, changed--likely in the same way we have.

The main point of this movie seems to be that capitalism and modernization might have brought prosperity to some in China, but not to the majority of the chinese people, and in any case it has left the country spiritually void, without a common goal for the people with the exception of making money. Director Jia Zhang-Ke might be right in his analysis, but did he need to tell this story in such a ponderous, gloomy manner?.",1169683200,3,742,4.628787878787879
