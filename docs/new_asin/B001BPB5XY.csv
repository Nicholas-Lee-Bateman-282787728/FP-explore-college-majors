3497000,5,B001BPB5XY,"Even at 80-90 years old, they are timeless classics that never lose their luster. I remember watching these when I was a kid, and I still love them and not just as a walk down memory lane. They are great family views because everyone of all ages can enjoy them. It's sort of like Loony Tunes that way. That while it may have been written with kids in mind as the main audience, adults can certainly enjoy them too. It is a bit slapsticky at times, but the kids ""one-liners"" will never fail to put a smile on your face. I just wonder what they would have had to say if you told them at the time that people would still be watching them nearly a century later.",1267920000,5,658,4.1484375
3497001,5,B001BPB5XY,My sons who are in their 40's just loved the DVD.  It brought them back to their childhood when they used to watch them on TV.  I watched it with a 4yr. boy and we just both loved it. It's a great buy.,1264809600,2,201,3.6511627906976742
3497002,5,B001BPB5XY,"Separating the wheat from the chaff in a media collection is one of the most grating and thankless aspects of enjoying these audio-visual treats.  Take music CDs for instance, typically there are only a few good songs buried amongst a whole lot of chaff on a single album, leaving you to fumble through the wanted background noise.  So to it can be with large television or shorts collections--even the best of shows was laden with duds if it ran for long enough.  Fortunately, this is not a problem with the Little Rascals, because Legend Films has selected the very best antics of everyone's favorite character, Spanky, and consolidated them on this single DVD for easy enjoyment.  Oh, and did I neglect to mention that they have all been imbued with bright, fabulous color?  Truly a must-own for any Little Rascals fan.",1227657600,3,822,4.801418439716312
3497013,5,B001BPB5XY,"I've loved Spanky, Alfalfa, Stymie and the Gang ever since I was a tyke myself.  Their hilarious antics, though obviously not always politically correct according to current attitudes, still make me howl with laughter.",1439596800,2,218,5.411764705882353

3497015,5,B001BPB5XY,"After much reading, this seems the best collection of clean prints for the money. Thoroughly enjoyable with your choice of original B&W, or a professionaly colorzed version. I'm not a film archivist, just an fan of the pre-PC days of Our Gang.",1430352000,2,243,4.809523809523809

3497019,5,B001BPB5XY,"Excellent classic comedy, reliving your childhood with these movies , absolutely love these old movies, little rascals are so funny",1398556800,,131,5.6
3497020,5,B001BPB5XY,"This DVD has a number of good things going for it. First, it has the best of Spanky which is hilarious. Secondly, it comes in colorization or black and white, and both were done to perfection by Legend Films. Lastly, here is a DVD you can share with your children so you can enjoy the fun together. For these reasons I must give this one 5 stars!!",1396224000,,347,4.1940298507462686
3497021,5,B001BPB5XY,"These are excellent Our Gang shorts - Super funny and cute.  But everyone should take note that there are two versions.  One is original black and white, and the other is IN COLOR.  If you want to find them both, just put ""Best of Spanky"" in the Instant Video search box and they will both come up.  The Color is great for kids, but I also recommend it for adults since it really seems to bring out so much more detail.",1394409600,,419,4.135802469135802
3497022,3,B001BPB5XY,"Price was okay and shipping was fast, but this DVD was kind of a disappointment. It is not nearly as fun to watch as an adult as it was when I was a kid. Of course, that is not the seller's fault. Just saying....",1389571200,,212,3.840909090909091
3497033,5,B001BPB5XY,My DVD came very quickly. I love all the Shorts on it. It brought back a lot of wonderful memories from my childhood of watching The Little Rascals after school.,1388016000,,161,4.4
3497034,5,B001BPB5XY,"What can be said, it is the Little Rascals! I grew up in the 70's and early 80's watching the Little Rascals and Our Gang and loved them. However with their not being on TV these days, at least not anywhere we have lived, I wanted our kids to be able to experience some of the shows we watched. The transfers are done well, they play just as I remembered them, no noise lines or other issues to make viewing unpleasant.",1385078400,3,419,4.185185185185185
3497035,5,B001BPB5XY,Classic stories that will never go out of style. My kids love it and we love to watch it with them.,1384387200,,99,3.761904761904762
3497036,5,B001BPB5XY,"The selection of short films from the classic Little Rascals/Our Gang comedies from the 30s and 40s is an excellent one, and being able to see them in color is terrific.  The good thing about this DVD is that you can also view each film in its original black and white format.  I grew up watching the Rascals and Our Gang films when they regularly ran them on our local TV station during the 1960s, and I have to say these entertaining films still make me laugh. Get this, you won't be disappointed.",1363305600,2,499,4.354838709677419
3497037,5,B001BPB5XY,I really loved watching them again and even in color it was wonderful. They did a great job with the colorization.,1356307200,,114,4.476190476190476

3497039,5,B001BPB5XY,"The episodes of children innocently getting into mischief were funny and very entertaining. Even though the setting for these episodes was some three-quarters of a centry ago my grandchildren love them and when they come to visit they want to see another couple of episodes. Unfortunately, America of yesterday was not as race sensitive as it is today and as a result there are some things that may be offensive to some and are certainly not politically correct. For example,the names of the ""colored"" children ""Cotton"" and ""Buckwheat"" would be offensive today. As would Spanky wishing Cotton would turn into a Monkey or Cotton wishing for a watermelon. The children at times were ""fresh"" (disrespectful?) to some adults could be problematic although I have seen worse displays of disrespect from today's children. That being said, I believe these episodes can be valuable for teaching children on how to properly think of and treat others who are of a different race and how not to be disrespectful of adults.",1352851200,3,1010,5.017857142857143

3497041,5,B001BPB5XY,"I was a little worried having had read a review that wasn't positive. I was afraid the clips would be grainy etc.  However, they are great!  Color was added to each clip and they are beautiful. My 3 yr old grandson just watched it this morning and laughed & laughed, then I found where there are at least a couple ""extra"" clips and movie on the DVD.  They are in black & white but they are ones I had never seen. So, don't be afraid to order this DVD, it is inexpensive, good quality & everyone will love it.",1330128000,2,508,4.111111111111111
