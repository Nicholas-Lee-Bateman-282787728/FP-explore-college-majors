8664555,4,B00L9214XA,"This movie is not quite as funny as the first Petit Nicholas, and my French students and I were disappointed that it was not the same lead actor. The adult characters (parents, Mr. Mouchboum) are the same as in the original film, and there is a new crew of friends for Nicholas to play with while on vacation. The friends' personalities all pretty much mimic those of the classic friends, so the jokes are pretty much the same. One boy, for example, eats all the time, just like Alceste. Overall, however, the film is entertaining and has classic Petit Nicholas humor. Other than one brief scene on a nude beach (I just skipped through that), this is appropriate for young audiences. There are English subtitles.",1506124800,6,712,4.704

8664558,4,B00L9214XA,"A quirky little film with lots of laughs for adults as well as kids. A direct steal from Monsieur's Hulot's holiday but it doesn't matter in the least. Some very inoffensive nudity and a plot line that goes over the head over most kids. Good early readers should cope with the sub-titles with a bit of help.
Definitely a ""watch with"" film rather than a plonk the kids in front of the tele.",1484265600,2,389,4.342465753424658
8664559,5,B00L9214XA,"I get that this is the sequel to the first which I found humorous. But  what's confusing is the fact that in the first movie little Nicolas has a baby sister in the end of the film . Yet in the sequel where his family is on vacation, it shows Nicolas , his parents and his grandma, But what happened to his baby sister?.",1483833600,3,320,4.0

8664561,4,B00L9214XA,"Funny movie in the series yet again, particularly due to the talents of Kad Merad and Valerie Lemercier.  I must add that one reviewer here comments about there not being English subtitles, but I am not sure what version of the DVD they have because the version shown here DOES have subtitles.  The official Canadian release, which is the one that appears to be listed here (and is Region 1), does have English subtitles (and they are optional, so they can also be removed, which is useful for teaching or French speakers), and that is exactly how it is with my copy.",1470355200,16,567,4.549019607843137
8664562,4,B00L9214XA,"Cute movie...Unfortunately, I won't be able to use this in my classroom because there are only subtitles in French, English subtitles are not an option.  The first Nicolas movie did have English subtitles available, so I thought that this one would as well.",1465344000,18,257,4.976744186046512
