The video contains three episodes. Episode one involves the kids working together for a school project. Although they have some good ideas they can't seem to get together on exactly how to put the project together in a seamless way. After a bit of arguing they find that working as a team is much better than trying to work against each other. They also learn that history projects require a little research and a little, well, history! All is well when they present their project to Mr. Ratburn who commends them on their teamwork.
In episode two Arthur worries that Francine likes him while Francine worries the same thing! Misunderstandings and some bad advice from friends makes the pair think that just because the other wants to spend time with them or do something nice they ""like"" them. They both decide that they have to tell the other that they don't like them the same way. How surprised they are to find out that they both feel the same way--they don't like each other as more than friends! It's a cute way to show that boys and girls can be just friends and that's OK.
Episode three finds Buster a bit worried. He's never read a book before and he has to write a book report! Much to his dismay he finds that not all movies come from books-something he thought was true when he's written his past book reports. The gang gets together to try and help him find a book that he can get through to write a report on. He struggles through a few not getting very far until he finds a book he loves and realizes that books are a great thing. He sees that once you find a subject that interests you you can even read a long book!
The Arthur series is one to buy. My kids are a bit young for the lessons and subject matter but that doesn't seem to bother my three year-old. He's loved Arthur for over a year now. If you don't like it, call me. I'll buy the used one from you. I know ours will wear out sometime soon!",1021939200,14,2161,4.260340632603406
