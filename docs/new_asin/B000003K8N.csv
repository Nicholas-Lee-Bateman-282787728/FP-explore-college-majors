7902981,4,B000003K8N,"The wonderful thing about DS9 was that it didn't always take itself too seriously.  Some of the best episodes were centered around Quark (played by Armin Shimmerman).  Armin isn't just an excellent actor but he has an excellent sense of comedic acting.  His comedy delivery is exceptional.  Even though this episode likely won't make any DS9 fan's Top-10 list it is, nevertheless, funny.",997833600,3,387,5.095238095238095
7902982,2,B000003K8N,"Quark is diagnosed with a fatal illness, in Ferengi tradition he begins  selling off his body parts in advance, to his surprise his entire body is  bought... by Brunt.
When Quark realises he doesn't have the disease he is  forced into an interesting situation, break the contract with Brunt or die.  But if he breaks the contract he will forfeit Ferengi rule and one of the  Rules of Acquisition that the Ferengi Empire was founded upon!
A mediocre  episode that serves to fill some air-time while the budget is saved on some  big budget season finale... or so I thought.",966729600,2,571,4.65
