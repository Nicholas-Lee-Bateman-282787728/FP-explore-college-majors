8649920,5,B00JDCP8AI,"I am a person that really does not like to watch stage plays on DVD. I usually get bored with them and rarely finish watching them. But this plays was different. Each and every scene made me curious and kept me engaged. I actually felt like I was in the audience. This play is full of valuable life lessons, and I promise that you will find bits and piece of people that you personally know in many of the characters. This play is worth checking out, I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed. I will be looking for the next play from S. Dodson.",1402444800,,553,4.226415094339623

It brings light to friendships, relationships and commitment.  You will laugh all the way through.  Ms . Dodson did an awesome job with the writing of the play which if you read the book does not deviate at all.  I look forward to seeing more of her productions.",1401408000,,391,4.301369863013699

8649924,5,B00JDCP8AI,This was definitely a great play. My friend's enjoyed the play from beginning to end. The characters and their issues were surreal.
