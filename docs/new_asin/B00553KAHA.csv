4571272,5,B00553KAHA,"Henry's crime is a nicely paced, interesting look at how several people are finally motivated to take some chances in life instead of doing what is easy and comfortable.  I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it again.  The ending is great.  It leaves the viewer to consider how things worked out for Henry.  Did he make the right choice?",1315008000,6,338,4.491803278688525
4571273,4,B00553KAHA,"HENRY'S CRIME is a dark comedy that actually carries a fairly good afterburn.  The story is solid, the characters are unusual, and the setting in Buffalo, NY is appropriately dark and dank.  This is a tale of how people react to their own personalities, moving through the world seemingly oblivious to those around them, afraid to create dreams much less go after them.

Flatline Henry Torne (Keanu Reeves) works the night shift in a freeway tollbooth, quite alone, and seemingly undisturbed by his isolation. At dawn he goes home to his tiny house where he greets his wife, nurse Debbie (Judy Geer) who wants to talk about beginning a family but as usual things distract the couple's ability to have a conversation.  Friends pick up Henry to have him replace a member of the neighborhood baseball team and Henry goes along (as he does with everything that comes his way) only to wind up as the driver of a getaway car for his 'teammates' as they pause to rob a bank.  Henry is so loopy that he is not sure what happened and is arrested by the bank cop Frank (Bill Duke) and without much effort in protecting his innocence, Henry is convicted and imprisoned.  There he meets Max Saltzman (James Caan) who loves being in the protection of prison (low goals in life). When Henry comes up for parole, Max wishes him luck in finding a dream (or waking up to life) and Henry wanders back to his home: Debbie has married worthless Joe (Danny Hoch) and is pregnant - and none of this seems to bother Henry either.  Henry decides to return to the bank he was convicted of 'robbing' and is struck by a cellphone carrying driving actress Julie (Vera Farmiga).  Henry has feelings (surprise!) for Julie, follows her into the theater next to the bank where Julie is rehearsing Chekhov's 'The Cherry Orchard'.  Things finally begin to move: the theater is connected to the bank by a tunnel, Henry visits Max and convinces him to get out on parole, and the two men plan to actually rob the bank Henry was sent to prison for not robbing!  From here the puzzle takes twists and turns but the result is Henry's finally waking up to his emotions (with Julie), with a 'dream' of robbing the bank to repay the fact that he was unjustly incarcerated, and nothing  - and everything - goes as planned with big surprises in the end.

Malcolm Venville directs this plodding venture written by Sacha Gervasi, David  White, and Stephen Hamel. Much of the plot is rather silly but that seems somehow proper for a character as bland as Henry (played with appropriate flatness by Reeves). Farmiga and Caan add the sparkle that keeps the boat afloat. Just when viewers are about to groan over this story, it reminds everyone of some of the people who are sleepwalking through life, whether blandly or anxiously, and by film's end the importance of dreams and an appreciation of the events that make our lives interesting and quirky provides some valuable food for thought.

4571277,4,B00553KAHA,"It's a good movie, keeps your attention for it's entire length. Would have been 5 stars; the ending felt a little shortchanged/abrupt. Unanswered questions - did the police catch up with the protagonist? Did he and the female lead run away?",1314057600,,240,4.878048780487805
4571278,3,B00553KAHA,"One assumes that Henry (Keanu Reeves) has some kind of inner life. He seems to be a likable, easy-going fellow; it's just that he's a bit...inscrutable. Maybe it's his job. Working the graveyard shift night after night at a N.Y. Thruway tollbooth would put anybody in semi-comatose state. Nothing fazes the agreeable yet impassive Henry, one way or the other-although he does display a slight twitch when, one morning at breakfast, his wife (Judy Greer) broaches the subject of the couple having a child. Suddenly, we get the impression that Henry would prefer to be anywhere else but there, at that moment, having that particular conversation. What's going on? Is this a troubled marriage? Does he love his wife? Is this cipher of a man internally harboring primal doubts about life itself? Or...is he suffering in silence from a sudden attack of gas? There's really no way of discerning.

We never get a chance to find out exactly what Henry is contemplating, because that is precisely the moment that Fate intervenes. An old high school chum named Eddie Vibes (Fisher Stevens) unexpectedly shows up on his doorstep, with a drunken cohort in tow. Both men are dubiously outfitted for a game of baseball. Eddie wants to know if Henry can give them a ride to their ""game"". Nothing about this questionable early-morning scenario seems to raise any red flags for the ever-malleable Henry. Even Eddie's request to stop at the bank ""on the way""-and to park the car out front and wait while his passengers go inside-fails to elicit the tiniest raised eyebrow from Henry. Needless to say, the heist goes awry, Henry's car stalls, his ""friends"" flee...and guess who ends up in stir?

Although he owes them squat, Henry doesn't rat out the real culprits and takes the fall, while his demeanor remains unchanged. At this point, one might surmise that Henry is either some kind of transcendent Zen master...or a clueless moron (not unlike the protagonist of ""Forrest Gump"" or Chance the gardener in ""Being There""). Ah, but our little wooden boy is about to meet his Geppetto. Max (James Caan) is a veteran con man. He's one of those oddball convicts who actually ""likes"" prison-which is why he has been sabotaging his own parole hearings and enabling himself to continue living on the state's dime. He becomes a mentor/father figure to Henry, who takes it to heart when Max advises him that he needs to find a Dream, and then pursue it. So what is Henry's resultant epiphany? Since he's already done the time, he might as well now do the crime. Classic heist caper tropes ensue, with a love interest tossed in for good measure(Vera Farmiga).

There's a little dj vu running through this film (the second effort from ""44 Inch Chest"" director Malcolm Venville). Sacha Gervasi and David White's script may have been ""inspired"" by some vintage heist flicks; specifically, Alexander Mackendrick's 1955 comedy ""The Ladykillers"", and Lloyd Bacon's ""Larceny, Inc."" from 1942 (essentially remade by Woody Allen as ""Small Time Crooks""). I thought that James Caan was recycling his ""Mr. Henry"" persona from Wes Anderson's ""Bottle Rocket"" a wee bit. While the film has classic screwball tropes, it lacks the kinetic pace of Lubitsch or Sturges. That being said, I still found Venville's film to be quite engaging and entertaining-within its own unique universe (yes, even the somnambulant-as-usual Keanu). I was reminded of Vincent Gallo's criminally underappreciated ""Buffalo '66""; in addition the fact that it also was filmed in and around the Buffalo area, it's another one of those low-key comedies with oddly endearing characters that ""sneaks up"" on you, especially once you realize how genuinely touching and sweet it really is at its core. And there's no crime in that, is there?",1314057600,31,3764,4.980922098569158
4571279,4,B00553KAHA,"""If you did the time, you might as well have done the crime."" After a trip to a baseball game ends badly, Henry (Reeves) winds up in jail for a bank robbery he didn't commit. While waiting to get out his wife falls in love with another man. Upon release he comes up with an idea, to rob the bank. This movie was much much better then I was expecting it to be. The big problem is the casting. Not so much the choices, but whoever thought it was a good idea to pair up Keaneu Reeves and James Caan overlooked one big thing. Reeves can't act. Other than that, the idea is a very neat one and the writing is very good. Caan does a great job in trying to carry the movie in the scenes he is in (most with Reeves) and is both funny and serious at the same time. Overall, I really did like this movie and the idea of it. The bad acting is not enough to prevent you from watching it, and I recommend you do. I give it a B.

4571280,4,B00553KAHA,"James Caan in a superb role as a jail lifer and philosopher. Vera Farmiga in a superb role as a bitter and skeptical actress playing the female lead in Chekhov's Cherry Garden. Keanu Reeves in a strange role as a romantic sleepwalker. Buffalo in a decent supporting role as one of the most awful cities that the US can offer to world civilization.
A film somewhere between thriller (suspense entirely absent) and comedy (of the mild philosophical kind). Plausibility not relevant.
My verdict: rather enjoyable because of Caan and Formiga. Reeves doesn't disturb much.",1310256000,8,567,5.042553191489362
4571281,4,B00553KAHA,"**WARNING: HEAVY PLOT SYNOPSIS**

Keanu Reeves plays the meek Henry Torne, who works a toll booth in Buffalo. He is having some problems with his wife Debbie (Judy Greer, a young version of Susan Sarandon). He is conned into driving some guys to a baseball game, only as it turns out they rob a bank and Henry is the only one who gets caught. Henry meekly says nothing in his defense and gets sentenced to 3 years. During this time his wife leaves him for another man, which doesn't seem to bother Henry. In prison Henry meets Max Saltzman (James Caan), prison philosopher, barber, and story teller. Caan convinces Henry that if he did the time, he should do the crime.

Henry gets out of jail and appears to have walked home. His wife is pregnant by Joe (Danny Hoch), one of the bank robbers. Joe tries to recruit Henry to sell in his pyramid scheme, er ah multi-level... Henry's belongings are packed into one small box. Henry doesn't seem to mind at all.

Like a moth to a flame Henry is attracted to the bank...as he is walking in the middle of the street he gets hit by a female driver, who was paying no attention while chatting on her cell phone.  She immediately gets out of the car and blames the victim.

Henry finally realizes his life's goal: To rob the bank he didn't rob. He goes to Max for help. Max is a lifer. He wants to stay in prison and not get out. At his review board he twitches and says to the panel if he got out he is going to kill their dog. Henry wants Max to get out and help him.

The theater, across from the bank, 80 years ago had a tunnel that went to the bank vault. Julie (Vera Farmiga), the woman who clocked Henry with her car is an actress, performing in ""The Cherry Orchard"" a play like the movie is both a comedy and tragedy. The metaphors pile up. His job as a toll booth operator symbolizes someone who goes nowhere while watching everyone go somewhere. Before this thing is through Reeves plays Lopakhin, who has come up from nothing and is looking for a change of life. The group of crooks blossoms from 2 to 5 and the play...let's just say it has an alternative ending.

Chick flick, heavy metaphors, F-bomb, sex, no nudity.",1309046400,23,2170,4.330049261083744
4571282,1,B00553KAHA,"Disaster. Even the soundtrack to the movie sucked and didn't fit it at all.
The best part was watching James Caan, which almost made up for 2 stars.
I watched this due to the amount of 3+ stars ratings. Seriously people, WTF.
Do you even know what a good film is anymore? Or are you so jaded from watching
junk that anything makes a good flick now.
This movie was painful because it was a great idea that was poorly executed.
I've watched better bad late night TV. With a cast like this, with this kind of talent, you
almost cannot fail, unless the execution just sucks, and this one did.

4571284,5,B00553KAHA,"This is one of those ""little"" films that start off with such lack of pretense that you just have a feeling it's all going to come together and reward you for staying the course. Henry's Crime does just that. Great to see James Caan again--he's aged fantastically--and Keanu and Vera Farmiga are just right in their respective roles. No one does ""water off a duck's back"" better than Keanu (no criticism, it's a talent) and Vera's Julie Ivanova is the girl anyone would forgive for running over them and then, perfectly, calling them an idiot for walking in the road. That's when I knew it was going to be a very enjoyable film. I am glad that when filmmakers are reading a script, they're willing to forgo box office for their vision. The adlib ending to Chekhov's play is something the old playwright, on his deathbed, would have had cause to go to his grave smiling over. It's just a nice, loving, oddball little film that any guy should treat his date to and probably earn a few points thereby.",1493683200,5,997,4.544444444444444

4571382,5,B00553KAHA,"I found this gem by accident and am so happy I did!  I am Keanu Reeves fan, but this movie also starred James Caan and Vera Farmiga. James Caan is one of the greatest actors of our times, and his performance in this film is on point. He plays his character is such a way that even though he is a career criminal, he is still like able and you find yourself rooting for him throughout the film. Vera Farming I recognized from the series Bates Motel. Her character is actually quite similar. She plays a somewhat self obsessed, shut off want to actress who won't let anyone or anything stand in her way. Henry, played by Keanu Reeves, plays a man who is so board and feels so ambivalent and trapped by his life that he would rather go to prison for a crime he didn't commit in hopes it will give him a fresh start, than defend himself when he could easily have gotten off. Once released from prison he discovered his ""dream"" and decides rob the bank he has already wrongly served time for robbing. Henry and Julie (the would be actress) meet in an unusual way and a very strange and unorthodox romance ensues. This film is worth a watch. The ending, while somewhat predictable, is satisfying and leaves you feeling good about the characters you have come to care about. You know they have all found what they needed, justice is served, and happiness is found.",1451865600,20,1357,4.4063745019920315

After he gets hit by a car a actress (Vera Farmiga) who was busy talking on her cell phone, he is attracted to her and decides on a goal in life.

Instead he is going to use a old filled in bootlegger tunnel.  He convinces his prison roommate Max (James Caan) to final convince the parole board to let him out so that he can help him.  The film is slow and maybe boring to some, does not tie out well at the end, but it is interesting with the little side stories to entertain as it moves along.  Farmiga and Caan do good jobs.

4571403,5,B00553KAHA,"Keanu Reeves, Vera Farmiga and James Caan are the very best. I have followed all three of them for a long time. This movie is a wonderful romantic comedy that I would recommend to others. I bought this DVD and I am glad I did. I have watched it more than once and always get a ""feel good"" chuckle out of it. There are a lot of good ""gotcha moments"" in it.

The story begins as Henry (Keanu Reeves) has been in prison for a bank robbery he never committed. His history is one of being a toll booth operator and was married, but by the time he gets released from prison his wife is remarried and pregnant. Upon visiting the Buffalo Bank he gets hit by a car driven by Julie (Vera Farmiga)) She is acting in a play where the theater connects to the bank vault. Having done the time Henry feels that he may as well do the crime. James Caan (Max) is released from prison and he helps Henry rob the bank. He always does a great job of acting. Thus enters Julie and Henry having a date and ending up in a relationship. Eventually Henry becomes a main character in Julie's play. Thus we have a play within a play in the storyline.

Julie explains to Henry that Chekhov was dying and it was his last work and it consisted of the ""Cherry Orchard"" being about a woman and her family estate in Russia, which was her family home in her youth and where she felt safe, and is forced to sell it in order to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive. Both Henry and Julie find their self in the same position. They both need a new start to survive.

There are so many good parts to this movie which includes the romance and the robbery to name a couple of them. Henry gets shot in the leg during the bank robbery, but makes it back to the stage and refuses to leave without Julie meeting him. Julie questions Henry's love for her thinking all he cares about is money. All of this is done on stage in front of the audience.

In the final scene Henry asks Julie onstage what she is running from and what she is afraid of. In their argument, he tells her that she is afraid of him being in love with her. Julie finally, after much coaxing by Henry, the stage cast members, such as,( Darek and Simon ), and the audience watching the play, encourage her to meet Henry in Moscow. Because of the bank robbery and the storyline Moscow really means going to California and Henry and Julie meeting there.

The last scene has great acting with the addition of the director named ""Darek"", played by actor Peter Stormare, and the stage manager named ""Simon"" played by Currie Graham. A great job by both of them.  Henry and Julie clearly have great chemistry here. The reactions to them by the cast members also helped make the last scene a really good one. Character actors always ""add to"" in scenes like this one and they certainly did here. In the end, Julie decides she wants to be with Henry. I like romantic comedies and this was a good one.",1416700800,12,2935,4.232142857142857

Judging by the sluggish pacing, and other woefully underdeveloped parts of the film, It's like the director was telling a story much less than he was saying ""yipeeeeeeeee!  I'm making a movie starring Keanu Reeves!!  YEAH!!""

James Caan is always great, and Mr. Reeves is decent, but it's never clear why his character is the way he is.  During the first third of the movie, it doesn't seem like the character wants anything, and that's just frustrating for any mainstream audience.  So much so that in the last half of the movie, when he develops feelings for Vera Farmiga's character, there's no clear reason why, and the audience could care less by that point.",1403913600,2,737,4.674418604651163

I had never seen the actress/love interest before but people she was magical, and the magic she was carrying somehow lit up all the boys in the film.

I love Keanu, but if you are interested in ACTING as a hobby, profession or art..watch James Caan. No one understood the timing he had and that drives the film too.

If you like film, if you are a filmwatcher,  actor, wannabe screenwriter...man, watch this thing. Look at the beats. I have no way to know what what was going on exactly in this film but I swear to you every frame is an act of love.

These are mythical, mythic creatures presenting their art.

Each and every one of these actors is a true artist and they put it here on film.

Watch it. Watch it again.

It really is beautiful.

And I am also glad that Keanu finally found a place in film to put his love for Chekhov, and the Cherry Orchard, somewhere in cultural memory. I am fairly sure he chose the woman, who is some other universe of freakin amazing.

I hope through this movie someone sees what James Caan can do. Finally. If you can't see it, watch it again. Keanu's got the light shining on him always, but watch a working actor, with intense intuition -- watch it and learn what it is.

This movie is different; he plays a character so deadpan and lifeless you'd think Keanu himself had forgotten how to act.  Yet, even through the quiet dreamless meandering, his character inspires irritation at his lack of desire and even instills a false sense of security that you know the plot and the story-line endgame.  This movie resonates with my life and I would imagine with many others, and is both an inspiring tale of life and encouragement to those who live life in the ""grey"" safety zone of complacency.

Keanu plays Henry, a man that seems almost bored with his extremely uninteresting life.  He goes to work, he comes home and that's about it.  He doesn't have any goals and seems to be numb or indecisive about his feelings toward his current life including his wife.  He's the guy that wants to make others happy and goes along with whatever comes his way.

During the movie you see Henry finally decide on a goal.. finally know what he wants in life.  He has a purpose and eventually feelings and opinions about what's going on around him and the people around him.

This is a good movie to watch and Keanu along with the rest of cast are very good.",1345075200,8,848,4.25625
4571449,4,B00553KAHA,"I'd read a great many lukewarm reviews on this film up until actually watching it and, while not a blockbuster, this film is well worth snuggling up on the couch to enjoy a evening's entertainment.

Keanu Reeves plays a work-a-day guy who is imprisoned for a bank robbery he didn't commit. After release, he reasons that since he did pay the time, he may as well get his money's worth and commit the crime - he plots to burglar the very bank he was falsely accused of robbing.

There are no red-hot chase or intricate crime planning scenes; this is more a romance/comedy with a sophisticated flare. Probably the lukewarm reviews are from people expecting more of a shoot-em-up, action-adventure bank heist movie. This is not that kind of film.

You'll just have to check it out and find out what kind of film it is all by yourself.",1333756800,,831,4.563758389261745
4571460,3,B00553KAHA,"Keanu Reeves is an actor that people either seem to love or hate. Those that love him think of him as Neo in THE MATRIX films. Those that hate him think he's little more than bumbler Ted from the BILL AND TED movies. The fact is he's both and so much more. He's an actor who has good and bad moments like everyone else in the world. And in HENRY'S CRIME he displays what would appear on the surface to be a wooden character but who is actually a man who never quite came alive.

Henry Torne is in a rut. He works as a toll booth collector and goes through his day to day existence with no life to his life. When his wife (Judy Greer) talks about having children he doesn't even get excited about that. But his life changes.

Asked by a friend to drive them to participate in a baseball game, Henry unwittingly finds himself the driver of a getaway car for a bank robbery. Left behind, he's arrested and sentenced to prison, never giving up the names of those who were with him.

Henry's cell mate is a long time prisoner named Max Saltzman (James Caan). A confidence man who's been in prison for years, Max is content with the system, it works for him. He talks to Henry about finding your goal in life, living up to your potential, and then trying to make it happen. For him, that's prison.

During a discussion between prisoners Henry finds his mission in life. He's in prison for a crime he didn't commit. That being the case he twists things backwards. He's done the time, now he needs to do the crime.

After his release Henry stands outside of the bank he was arrested in front of. Stepping into the street he's hit by a car driven by Julie Ivanova (Vera Farmiga). Julie makes sure he's okay, takes him to a small coffee shop across the street and leaves him to get to work. It's in the bathroom Henry finds his mission when he sees an old front page of the local newspaper from decades ago describing a tunnel between the bank and the theater across the street.

Visiting the theater, Henry finds Julie involved in the play THE ORCHARD TREE being performed there. They talk and he looks around the building, realizing that perhaps the tunnel still exists. Visiting Max in prison, he asks for his help which means Max getting out. Max follows through, looks over the job and things move forward.

Various other criminals get involved in the whole story and Henry begins dating Julie. For once he seems to have something in his life that makes him want to move forward, to wake up in the morning. But once the crime is finished, he leaves Julie behind and moves on. Is it the crime that is the focus of Henry's life now? Or is it Julie?

Reeves performance is one that is unusual at best. Henry is a stoic individual who rarely if ever displays emotion. It is only on stage while performing with Julie that he shows anything at all. But that's the character Reeves is playing here. A man dead to the world who had no clue how to let lose, how to expose himself to anyone. And when he does, he does so on his terms, displaying nothing on his face but plenty in his actions and words.

The entire cast does an excellent job as well, supporting Reeves character while establishing their own at the same time. Particularly interesting was watching Caan as Max and thinking back to his 1981 film THIEF where he plays a bank robbing thief as well. It might make an interesting double feature at home one night.

The nice thing about this film is that it has a feel good sense about it without getting mushy. You want Henry to find life, you want him to find something, anything, that will wake him up and make him get out into the world. And by the end of the film you realize that perhaps he just might make it after all.",1332201600,,3721,4.333333333333333
4571461,5,B00553KAHA,I don't know why this film didn't get a wider distribution because the story was unusual and the actors were great together.  This was a fun not-so-involved caper.  I was disappointed that the Blu-ray had no commentary because I enjoy that.  But I'm glad I have the disc!,1330128000,,271,4.604166666666667
4571462,5,B00553KAHA,"I loved this movie.  You can't place it into a genre because it covers comedie, romance, crime caper at once.  The script was well written and Keanu's performance was perfect as the guy finally taking control of his life after others have always controlled it.",1328572800,,260,4.7555555555555555
4571463,4,B00553KAHA,"I would recommend this movie to people who is having a life like Henry who just moves along and don't know or care where he is heading to.

In the story, Henry is like most of ordinary people who work day after day getting bored with his own life but has no heart to change it. He just moves along. He is a boring person, just like his job 'a toll collector'. He doesn't even picky when it comes to friendship, or perhaps even marriage. He does whatever his friends ask for and not care where it would lead him to. Although he sensed that there was something wrong while his friends were going to rob the bank without his knowledge, he didn't even try to run away and he just sat there to get caught. Perhaps being put into the jail for three years was a fortunate turning point for his life.

He started to realize he needed a dream for his life but he couldn't figure out what dream he wanted to have. He got inspired by being once told by his inmate, ""if you've done the time, do the crime."" He somehow still didn't know why or what he wanted to rob the bank. All he knew at this point was he wanted a change. He started to pick his own path. Along his path he chose, he started to pick up friends whom he can trust and woman whom he would fall in love.

The other characters in the story are carried in a way to emphazize the theme of the movie. Julie, as a stage actress who was not satisflied with her own career, wanted to make a change when she met Henry. After Henry told her about his criminal plan, she wasn't scared but treated it like a scene in her play. After she met Henry's friend and partner, she still did neither avoid involving with these men nor join them. It seems she didn't care how others live their own life and didn't bother if they would affect her own in one way or the other. It seems everyone would just pass by in her life as the way in her play. At the very beginning, she told Henry she had dreams and she knew where she wanted to be in her life. As the story unfold, she was found that she didn't dare to take risk for she wanted. She didn't even want to take risk to fall in love with Henry.

Henry met Max in jail, a place he would have never thought he would see in his life. Max was a confidence man as he called himself but was too coward to carry his crime to the end all the time. He got tired of his criminal dream which he didn't believe he had the gut to reach. He would rather stay in prison for his rest life to avoid to prove himself once more that he was just a man with a dream but not capable to reach it. By meeting Henry by fate, he decided to give himself another chance after he was asked to help to rob the bank by Henry.

The story would show us ""fate"" still plays a great part in our lives but how ""fate"" play it out depends on how we react. Julie met Henry by running him over right in front the bank. Henry met his roommate and friend, Max, in prison where he wouldn't believe he would found himself there in his life.  Although the turning point of story, at which a man is no theif in heart but wants to rob a bank in a sudden, is somehow illogical and hard for me to accept, it plays out what the writer wants to say. Making a change itself is a good start while we don't know where we want our life to be heading.

As an ordinary person who has been at the same job for years and forgot why I wanted the job at the very first place, I felt like having a large stone hit into my heart after watching the movie. It is a movie for people who lost their dreams or don't know where they want to be. It may inspire you if you are having a life like Henry's or mine.",1325894400,,3624,3.9834710743801653
4571464,1,B00553KAHA,"The best way to compensate for a lousy plotline (as boring and actionless as this one) is with an impressive lead actress. Typically, Reeves is paired with a leading lady with whom he at least seems to share an on-stage chemistry that's remotely believable (e.g., Sandra Bullock in ""Speed,"" Aitana Snchez-Gijn in ""A Walk In The Clouds,"" Charlize Theron in ""Sweet November"" and ""The Devil's Advocate,"" Rachel Weisz in ""Constantine"" and ""Chain Reaction,"" Brooke Langton in ""The Replacements"").

This movie, however, seems to have totally missed the mark with Vera Farmiga. Aside from not being very convincing, she just seems like an odd choice for Reeves (and only reminded me why I've never been a fan of hers). Of course, that's probably why such a heavyweight actor like James Caan was thrown in the mix -- to lend credibility, as only he can. For me, Caan made ""Henry's Crime"" palpable.",1325721600,4,889,4.926666666666667
4571465,3,B00553KAHA,"Keanu Reeves is Henry, a Buffalo tollbooth collector who is caught and sentenced for the crime he didn't commit. After spending a year in prison, Henry decides to change his life ... by stealing money from the bank he didn't rob. Henry manages to enlist the help of an inmate Max (James Caan), but the off-beat story takes a romantic turn when Henry meets and falls in love with a stage actress Julie (Vera Farmiga), who happens to be rehearsing for the Chekhov play in the theater next to the bank.

Written by Sacha Gervasi and David White, the story has potential but never fulfills it. Henry's transformation from nave to daring doesn't convince. Neither do some of his motives, including his reluctance to tell the truths when he got arrested for the crime he didn't commit. Caan's character Max is more interesting and believable. Not just a comic relief, he adds much-needed warmth and humor to the film. Wait till his characters shows up.

Some may argue that ""Henry's Crime"" is not really a heist film. In fact its story has too many plot holes to be called one (didn't anyone notice the big sound they were making?) The romance between Julie and Henry fares slightly better with always reliable Vera Farmiga though the film is definitely not her best. Supporting players include Bill Duke, Judy Greer, Danny Hoch, Fisher Stevens and Peter Stormare.

""Henry's Crime"" is a pretty enjoyable off-beat heist comedy romance, maybe a bit too off-beat for me to enjoy.",1325635200,,1470,4.7795275590551185
4571466,1,B00553KAHA,"Keanu's only exciting movie was Speed. With all the action going on, the beautiful Sandra Bullock and the equally beautiful Keanu Reeves to stare at, Speed was a hit.

Now, we have Keanu alone to gaze at in a movie with a boring/stupid plot, nothing to look at in the background and a confused Vera Farmiga. Trust me, folks, it ain't even worth the 99 cents.",1324166400,6,358,4.424242424242424
4571467,5,B00553KAHA,"I enjoyed ""Henry's Crime"" immensely.  Malcolm Venville's second feature has kind of a clunky pacing, but it suits this offbeat world.  Keeanu Reeves gives a tremendously understated performance as Henry Torne, a man without dreams, yet somehow vaguely dissatisfied with the routine of life.  When his wife Debbie played by Judy Greer tells him that she's fallen in love with another guy, he seems genuinely happy for her; ""I want you to be happy.""  Reeves gives ""laid back"" a new low water mark with his almost complete absence of anxiety.  This is the quality that makes the film almost surreal and which makes it work.  Fisher Stevens who I loved to hate in his appearance on the TV show ""Medium"" does a good job as the false friend Eddie Vibes who sets Henry up for a crime.  Danny Hoch who I saw in ""We Own the Night"" does a great job as the dimwitted Joe who marries Henry's wife.  James Caan plays the charming Max Saltzman, a confidence man, who can smooth talk himself into or out of most situations.  I also enjoyed Currie Graham's Simon who was very creepy recently on an episode of TV's ""Grimm.""  Currie plays the stage manager who flits about unobtrusively trying to get the actors in their places.  Most notable in the cast is Vera Farmiga as Julie Ivanova.  She was nominated for a supporting actress Oscar for ""Up in the Air"" with George Clooney.  She does a good job of playing the hard-edged actress whose dreams are just a bit bigger than her accomplishments.  Framing the film are the rehearsals and performances of Chekov's classic play ""The Cherry Orchard.""  Its theme of dreams lost is the perfect companion piece for ""Henry's Crime.""  Ultimately, ""Henry's Crime"" is an offbeat romance.  Everything else serves that story.  So at the very last frame when the screen goes black apparently leaving so many loose ends; the point is that none of them matter.  What matters is finding another heart, who when all else seems to go wrong or not fit, is the one on whom you can rely.  So for a guy who has&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-and-Maude/dp/B001DCZ4IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold and Maude</a>&nbsp;as one of my classic films, ""Henry's Crime"" is utterly wonderful and weird.  Enjoy!",1322524800,,2262,4.978666666666666
4571468,2,B00553KAHA,"Henry's Crime has a good idea for a movie, but that idea is handled in a lazy, ham-fisted way, more like a treatment than a fully developed script. The actors do the best they can, and in the case of James Caan and Vera Farmiga, that's quite a lot, but the writing and direction work against them at every turn. Where the plot developments don't feel random, they feel mechanical rather than organic. Opportunities for really interesting plot developments---like having Henry's wife take up with one of the gang that robbed the bank initially and left him to take the rap---are left on the vine to rot, while other elements that are completely unnecessary---the bank guard becoming part of the heist---are pursued and then dropped.  None of this is helped by having Keanu Reeves in the lead role. I like him in action movies or films where his expressive limitations are an asset, like The Day the Earth Stood Still, but here, where he's required to actually act, his shortcomings are painfully obvious. Most telling is the scene in which he's trying out for the role in the Cherry Orchard. He's supposed to start by being unable to act and then under the director's guidance make a dramatic shift to real acting that wins everyone over. There is supposed to be a day-and-night change here, but in Reeve's case, he goes from completely inert to barely perceptible expression. Every scene he's in grinds to a halt almost immediately. Thank God James Caan is there to inject some energy and passion into the thing.

So what's the verdict? The movie is pleasant enough; it's not offensive or insulting, but it isn't satisfying, interesting, amusing, or enlightening.",1321920000,2,1663,4.831578947368421
4571469,2,B00553KAHA,"Starts out very slow. Lots of music and driving, or music and walking, or more music and more walking. Gets a little depressing from there.

His wife leaves him for lesser man and then he falls in love with a woman who anyone in their right mind would not want to spend 5 minutes with.  Then to add to the insult of the fact that you actually sat though the worst movie you have seen in recent memory, the ending is so abrupt it is like they ran out of film or money or maybe just forgot to add the ending scene.

Little did he think that love (Vera Farmiga,) greed (Fisher Stevens,) and fait may change his objective?

The acting is good. The pacing is good. The only thing that was annoying was the loud irritating irrelevant back ground music if you can call it that.

Unfortunately there is no ending, so if you want one, do not start this movie.
