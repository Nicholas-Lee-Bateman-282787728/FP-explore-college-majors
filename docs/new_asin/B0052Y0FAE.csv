8454751,4,B0052Y0FAE,"Not having seen other bios, I was interested and glad I bought it.  However, I would have liked more information and question some of the validity and factuality of the information.  For one thing, they mention Plant not being first choice but do not say that Page hadn't heard of Plant at that point and Plant was recommended to him by his first choice.  By quotes from Page, he was blown away and wondered why if Plant had been singing a few years wasn't already big!  He thought something might be wrong with him personality wise, but they spent a few days together and got along well and the rest is history... That wasn't mentioned at all. It is like they leave out important information that misrepresents the facts.  Also, Blunt from other reviews seemed to enjoy the time working with Plant and touring.  He also said in this dvd that they were overwhelmed when they toured America and how much the fans loved Robert.  It brought a tear to Robert's eye.  I found that endearing... Blunt thought they are going to start screaming for Zeppelin music, but they didn't.  They knew what Robert was doing and they were happy to hear his solo music so they were very impressed.

I found it interesting to learn what inspired Plant and his amazing voice.  But, would have loved to see more performances.  I guess I need to get the performance dvd's also.

Overall I found it good as I am a die-hard Plant and Zeppelin fan.",1315353600,3,1422,4.529411764705882
8454752,4,B0052Y0FAE,"(Review originally written for the Led Zeppelin email list, For Badgeholders Only)

In the first few minutes, I was rolling my eyes as a rip-off (cover?) of Since I've Been Loving You played in the background while being treated to what seemed like way more clips of bluesmen like Howlin' Wolf and the Rolling Stones than anything from Robert Plant.  However, this DVD is not like one of those Biography channel type things which are about 42 minutes of mostly garbage content spread out over an hour timeslot... Robert Plant's Blue Note has a running time of 2 hours, 37 minutes, plus a little 5.5 minute bonus clip discussing Lead Belly and Plant (in terms of Zeppelin and Plant/Krauss). Despite the questionable decision to use the SIBLY cover (it led me to believe that I wouldn't be hearing any actual Zeppelin/Plant music) many times
throughout the video, more appropriate audio and video footage is employed much of the time.

This is not a Led Zeppelin documentary and should not be construed as one - so if you go into it expecting a complete breakdown of Plant's time in Zeppelin, you're going to be disappointed.  There is quite a bit of time spent on Plant's influences as a teenager and how they impacted him in Zep, but most of the focus is on the early years, including claims that Plant's position in Zep was not secure even after the first album.  There are clips from Howlin' Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds (with and without Page), and Zep clips (all available on the official 2003 DVD, like Danish TV), as well as audio from Band of Joy (from Sixty-Six to Timbuktu). The focus on Zeppelin is brief - limited mostly to the band's formation, moving very quickly to spotlighting Kashmir and then skipping over any detail about why the band ended.  The lack of emphasis on Plant's time in Zeppelin could certainly be criticized, although the program might have been five hours long if they covered Zep in depth.  Skimming over the Zeppelin period did not bother me, since we have all seen quite a few Zeppelin documentaries that skip over the aftermath of the band and the solo years only to tack on a bit about Page/Plant at the end (sometimes with a mention of Jonesy's exclusion).

With those caveats out of the way, I will say that this DVD covers Plant's post-Zep period better than his official Nine Lives documentary or anything else I've seen.  Particularly fascinating to me was the in-depth interview with Robbie Blunt, since I can't recall seeing another interview with him anywhere.  Blunt was obviously very proud of his work with Robert in those crucial years in the wake of Zeppelin's demise, but he was also enormously frustrated by the way the partnership ended - mystified by Plant's efforts on Shaken 'n' Stirred to distance himself from everything familiar (or commercially successful).  Blunt shares a great anecdote about being coerced into working with a Roland guitar synthesizer.  Plant had chided Blunt by telling him something to the effect of ""well, Jimmy's getting on fine with his"", but apparently Benji Lefevre talked to Page's guitar tech, who confided that Jimmy had chucked his out the window by that time...  He also talks about Slow Dancer as the most Zeppelin-esque of all the Plant/Blunt compositions - something with which I think most of us would agree.  Blunt gives an enlightening and enjoyable interview.

Next up was Phil Johnstone, whose interview takes a similar path from initial euphoria at being on the same page with Robert to eventual frustration at not being able to find common ground and produce a final product that pleased Plant; though he thought he knew what Robert wanted, by the end he also knew that he was not the guy for the job.  Johnstone essentially describes Plant's eagerness to combine the American West Coast elements of Moby Grape & others with North African music, all combined together with rock and folk instrumentation/song structure...and Johnstone admits that he is basically a pop guy and wasn't cut out to provide Robert with what he really desired - which leads nicely into the Unledded collaboration with Jimmy Page.

This period is covered well, with a Hossam Ramzy interview providing most of the content.  Ramzy raves about being able to watch Page and Plant burn through Since I've Been Loving You on a nightly basis and talks about the difficulty his players had with things like Friends and Four Sticks.  Also of note is a fairly extensive piece on the influence of Egyptian vocalist extraordinaire Oumme Kalsoum (many spelling variations exist)on Plant over the years in various incarnations, most of which was new information for me.  I would have been impressed if the documentary had also included audio from the 1972 Page/Plant trip to India when they attempted to play Four Sticks and Friends (available on numerous bootlegs), but while those sessions were mentioned briefly, they were not heard.

Unfortunately, Walking Into Clarksdale is glossed over as a disappointing follow-up to the Unledded TV special and subsequent tour, and the documentary moves pretty rapidly through the Priory of Brion years and into Strange Sensation, the music of which in the narrative retrospect of the DVD seems like a logical culmination of Plant's quest for the perfect amalgamation of styles... but just when it seems all is right in his world, we lurch off in another direction toward the mountain music influence on Raising Sand and the collaboration with Alison Krauss and the next step of Band of Joy. It's been a few days now, but I don't remember the Zeppelin reunion at the Ertegun tribute show being mentioned on the DVD, so add that to the short list of grievances.

Robert Plant's Blue Note includes interviews (that were apparentlydone specifically for this DVD) with:
Nigel Williamson (author of The Rough Guide to Led Zeppelin)
Barney Hoskyns (the caption claims he wrote a book called ""Trampled Under Foot"" [sic] about the excesses of Zep, but all I can find is a book on the fourth album for a Rock of Ages series)
Chris Dreja (Yardbirds)
Robbie Blunt (RP guitarist and songwriting partner circa 1981-1985)
Phil Johnstone (RP guitarist/keyboardist and songwriting partner circa 1987-1993)
Hossam Ramzy (leader of the Egyptian orchestra on the Unledded/No Quarter project)
John Lomax III (grandson of John Lomax, son of Alan Lomax - interviewed about Leadbelly and Raising Sand)

All of the other interview footage and onstage clips of Plant, Zeppelin, Page/Plant, Strange Sensation, Alison Krauss, T-Bone Burnett, et cetera that augment the documentary... all of that is brought in from readily available sources like the Canadian radio interview Plant did last year, the 2003 Zeppelin DVD, the Page/Plant Unledded DVD, Strange Sensation Soundstage, Festival in the Desert, CMT Crossroads, By Myself BBC broadcast, Nine Lives DVD and not done specifically for this Blue Note DVD.  I didn't see anything ""new"" in that regard.

Some will find fault with the amount of time spent on discussing Plant's influences (and the inclusion of audio and video of those influences), but with a documentary of this length, I didn't have a real problem with it.  Even with the inclusion of material that most fans already have is not a significant issue, since it provides context for the subjects being discussed.  The most informative and interesting parts are the interviews with Blunt, Johnstone, and Ramzy.  The documentary could have benefited from new interviews with other key contributors (like Justin Adams, Doug Boyle, Francis Dunnery, Porl Thompson, Skin Tyson, and Buddy Miller, for instance), especially at the expense of some of the time allotted to Williamson and Hoskyns, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of them were contacted and declined.  All in all, this is a solid effort well worth watching for any fan of Robert Plant's work, especially for those fans who appreciate at least some of his post-Zeppelin output.",1314748800,35,7964,4.980406932931424
8454753,2,B0052Y0FAE,"We have a Robert Plant interview from Canadian television, 2010. What shall we do with it?
Perhaps build a career spanning documentary around it!
But don't fuss over content, fans will buy it because they love Robert.
Me, for one.

Despite some rave reviews i find this to be a disappointment. Simply another ""Under Review"" with special guests.
Same quotes, same pointless speculation, same adjectives, same unlicensed Zep footage, same agenda.
There is educational value in what artists inspired Plant and his generation albeit the same stock footage is found in a billion other rock docs.
And of course the crack team of video producers would have to dig up a few music journalists and record nerds to put everyone to sleep (including themselves).
Sorry kids but we need MORE than those same tired stories and an ignorant dismissal of the brilliant Shaken 'n' Stirred album.

It was good hearing from a few of Plant's colleagues (Chris Dreja, Robbie Blunt, an irate pop producer) but too few candid moments. Why are so many of Plant's friends and associates absent? No friends, no club owners, pub crawlers, turquoise dealers, nothin' ??
No. The circle of old men remains the same with the exception of ONE female who turns out to be  just another talking head. Cute though.
I don't want gossip but I prefer insight over conjecture.
If a run time of 2 and 1/2 hrs. grabs your attention it's all from lack of proper editing.
Lengthy clips from Plant's solo vids you've seen before however blurred and out of sequence while the Zeppelin years are painfully vague with less than astonishing detail as in ""then Bonham died and the group split.""
Only within the last 30 minutes did anything seem cohesive as we are presented with the recent past (Alison Krauss, Band Of Joy) before a few more decaf comments from the drowsing journo's bring it on home.",1313280000,6,1849,4.8081761006289305
8454754,5,B0052Y0FAE,"Just got hold of a pre release copy of this through a compwtition, so I thought I'd let you know what to expect...

When Robert Plant hit the grooves and airwaves with Led Zeppelin as I was coming of age, I have to say that I took him for granted. A supercharged instrument at a time when so much was going on in rock, he stood out as coming out of the blues, but went beyond to forge a style tremendously influential in what eventually was known as metal. If I paid more attention at the time to what was happening instrumentally, it was to my temporary loss. Of course he was more than just a rock screamer. As a soon-to-be-released DVD Robert Plant's Blue Note (Sexy Intellectual SIDVD567) shows clearly, he was and is a complex character with diverse interests, influences and a long career of stylistic change and development.

The video documents the shifting scene around him from the early-mid sixties onwards and his engagement with it. There is a fairly detailed look at the British blues boom of the '60s, spawned by a tepid pop scene and the infusion through imported records and personal appearances in England of the great black artists with their iconic excitement and sheer power. The general scene and Plant's eventual involvement with it are covered with depth and insight. The DVD goes on to look at the formation of Plant's own band, the subsequent formation of Led Zeppelin and the dynamic Page-Plant dialog, the expansion of the band from a quasi-hard-blues to a metal and progressive outfit, and then Plant's long solo career and his flirtation with popular synth-based styles, his return to metal, his renewed involvement with the psychedelic sounds of the late '60s California world, and finally his growth through involvement in North African/Mideastern music styles and ultimately roots-folk and country.

This is a long and detailed DVD (155 minutes) allowing for lots of interview footage of Plant and his contemporaries along with select musical journalists. There's a very fair amount of concert footage of Plant and others in the course of the presentation. And there is an overarching narrative with a main theme, Plant's fascination and immersion in the ""blue note,"" the intervals and bending tones of the blues.

There are many little assertions and details I might take exception to here. They are essentially about musical issues that would take us far beyond the scope of this review blurb, having to do with the roots of blues in Africa, the status of non-blues music in relation to the blues, and such like things. It's enough to say that I don't always completely agree with some of the points raised by the journalists on the DVD.

In the end though what matters is that you finish watching this longish DVD with a renewed appreciation of Plant as a musical force, his respect for the black music and world music roots he has engaged in various ways, and an appreciation for the open-ended nature of his musical quest. Mr. Plant is more than just an extraordinary vocalist. He has had an important musical stylistic influence on everything from metal to world-infused rock.

I don't think anyone with a serious interest in the history of rock and or Plant the artist will be disappointed in this DVD. It is well done.
