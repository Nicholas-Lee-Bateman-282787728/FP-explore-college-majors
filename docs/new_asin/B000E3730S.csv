8105017,3,B000E3730S,"This is an entertaining video to watch.  He cooks some yummy things.  True to Bobby Flay, there are always a MILLION ingredients and there's always multiple toppings and sauces for a dish.  I'd like to taste some of his dishes cooked by him because I've yet to create one of his entire recipes that made sense as far as all the extra sauces and that I was completely happy with the way I cooked it.  I'm no pro, but I do cook a lot, and I live in a green-conscious, gastronomic area.  We aren't eating miracle whip and white bread around here.  Anyway...this review is not so much about his choices in sauces and chutneys and extras that he adds but the fact that this video has 0 and I mean zero directions as to how much of the ingredient to add or any recipes anywhere on the DVD.  I searched the entire thing looking for them and was shocked they weren't anywhere to be found.  I made the fra divolo bbq T-bones and had to go to [...] to get the recipe.  So, unless you are someone who can watch another person make something in a video and know exactly how much of what to add by watching them...you are going to have to go hunting for the recipes if you want to make any of them.  Perhaps it is my own ignorance showing in this review, but I thought the point of having a cooking video is to help the cook make the dishes themselves.  I wouldn't think it was for the entertainment factor itself.",1276041600,,1401,4.209737827715355

8105019,4,B000E3730S,"All philisophical differences aside, I think I have a lot in common with the director of Boy 4: Boy Oh Boy.  While his existentialist take on the nature of being is not up my alley, it sure made for some succulent sequences with ""The Prof.""  His ""teachings"" may have not even existed, but they were real enough to me!!
This film could serve, perhaps, as an admonishment of existentialism and its narcissistic take on life, but I don't find it so.  While there are holes (in more ways than one), the lens is extremely sympathetic to our core cast of young philosophers.  Their sometimes naive judgement and beliefs make them extremely innocent, however, and nothing gets my motor running like teaching little boys lessons.  Rowr!",985651200,,728,4.792
8105020,3,B000E3730S,"The arousing movie is surely based on the imagination of the screenplay writer and the director. The lack of the philosophical depth , the slow-to-death development of the plots...contribute to the underrating. Hence , I only generously give it a 3-star rating.",971568000,3,261,5.238095238095238
