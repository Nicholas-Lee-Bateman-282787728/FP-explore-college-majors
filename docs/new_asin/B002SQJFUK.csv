8379509,2,B002SQJFUK,"this is a book you read, no sound and very poor fonts.  There is no more to say about this item.",1382313600,4,96,3.5714285714285716
8379510,1,B002SQJFUK,"Ugh, I purchased this DVD without reading the complete listing thinking, since it was a DVD, that it was a film/TV version of the Austen classic.  It's the book, page for page, on DVD & is a nightmare to use, even to just look up notable passages.  I would have returned it immediately if I had had time.  Useless for research & not an entertainment DVD.",1370908800,2,354,4.333333333333333
8379511,1,B002SQJFUK,"i also thought i was buying the movie dvd and actually got a book on disc. i had seen the movie and liked it in many aspects, and don't need another copy of the book. more than ten bucks down the drain. be careful what you order because amazon won't be.",1368316800,2,253,3.980392156862745
8379512,1,B002SQJFUK,"I ordered this thinking it was a movie.  It is a book on DVD.  Amazon.com has it misclassified under TV and Movies.  I popped it in the DVD player, all excited to see a version of this movie I had never seen, and, to my surprise, words came up.  I laughed, at first, and thought since I'd never read the book that I would.  However, on the last page of every few chapters, the DVD auto-advances to the chapter menu and you cannot read that last page.  I would recommend you do not buy this (especially if you are expecting a movie).  Instead, order the book (on paper).",1267056000,36,569,4.212962962962963
