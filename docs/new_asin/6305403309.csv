7889412,5,6305403309,"Awesome!  I give this movie 5 stars...Nicolette Sheridan (Alex) was just wonderful in this off-beat pick as the beautiful small-town wife of goofy plain looking author John Ritter (Carter).  The main reason she married him is to have an opportunity for a better life. After all Alex has no family or resources to help her.  She only has a husband who wants to have everything his way. Although I don't agree with murder, the husbands are not innocent either. Even John Ritter (Carter) is not innocent in the way he treats his wife the beautiful Nicolette Sheridan (Alex).",1344643200,,571,4.8061224489795915
7889413,5,6305403309,"Whenever I describe the plot of this movie - which it seems most have never seen - it makes people smile. John Ritter is funny. In fact, it is well acted and has a good pace. I have to dig out my old VHS copy to enjoy it once more.",1338768000,,231,3.64
7889414,3,6305403309,"Best things about this movie?  Hands down, John Ritter, who has always been underrated as a comedian and actor, and his wife Amy Yasbeck, who plays his agent.  You can see the chemistry between them here, and they play off each other very well for that reason.  The plot is quite funny, about a relationship psychologist who sells tons of books about marital communications, yet his own spouse, who he hasn't a clue about, is in a sort of wives' mafia where other wives they don't know take turns  murdering each others' husbands.  Imagine Carter's surprise when he discovers he's on their list, and the cops think he's the major suspect!

Unfortunately, due to the fact that Carter's wife Alex is played by Nicolette Sheridan, the movie loses some charm, and it ends up being another typical movie that's rerun on Lifetime.  Still, it is funny and a good farce of all those info shrink gurus who are clueless about their own personal lives.  One thing I truly dislike is that woman shrieking ""Doo-doo-boe-boe"" everytime some mafia wife is sneaking around.  Other than that, this movie is quite enjoyable.  Rest in peace John; you will surely be missed!",1126915200,7,1153,4.777777777777778

7889417,4,6305403309,"This movie is great, plain and simple.  I've watched John Ritter since his days on ""Three's Company"" and loved the physical aspects of his comedy.  This movie finds a small measure of that toward the end, but it's  still got some great moments throughout.  Well worth watching!",957312000,7,277,4.829787234042553

Thanx.",946771200,2,114,4.428571428571429
