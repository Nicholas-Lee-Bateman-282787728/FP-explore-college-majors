7975650,2,B00007F8OA,"This video does the seemingly impossible--makes the life and work of Picasso seem incredibly boring. There is virtually no biography and what is given is quite general. The life of Picasso is glossed over and few concrete details are given. Instead, most of the video consists of still shots of Picasso's paintings over time, yet most of the shots crop the images and eliminate important details in his works. Few images are discussed, instead they are simply shown for a few seconds along with the date and title. I am an art teacher and know if I show this video in class my students will revolt--it is so dull and seems to have little point. The maker, Edward Quinn, was friends with Picasso and seems like he didn't want to do anything that might reveal anything about Picasso's life. This video is dull dull dull.",1378598400,2,818,4.6482758620689655
7975651,2,B00007F8OA,"The quality of video and sound of this DVD set is low like of its VHS original of 1986, but its unique scenes showing Picasso are not available else. Remastering would be beneficial. ""Picasso: Magic Sex Death"" is by far a better choice.",1194739200,7,236,4.511627906976744
7975652,1,B00007F8OA,"Bold new insights are bad enough - read Norman Mailer! But at least Mailer, like John Berger (The Success and Failure of Picasso), has a point of view. This sad little video reflects that period in the artist's old  age, and after his death, when the only available attitude (even among  serious critics) was slobbering sycophancy (misspelled I know). Useless for  those trying to come to terms with his work, less than useless for anyone  who wants to explore his developement, to trace period and styles.
We  have odd glimpses of his life in the ""midi"" and in his various  Paris haunts, including the famous Bateu Lavoir, but the latter (indeed all  the earlier images) come via slowly-panned still photographs, almost all of  them inferior to those in John Richardson's definitive biography (which  see).
One thing that film could and should of done, which no emanuensis  ever did, or tried: capture the man at work. Such footage is rare, though  no doubt it exists. Problems with the estate meant that Anthony Hopkins  (Life with Picasso) could not even use reasonable facsimiles of PP's work  for his dramatic re-enactment of his turbulent relationship with Francoise  Gilot - so no such records, fictional or factual, exist. That is the gap I  was hoping the video might fill, and it fails miserably. Any hope that it  might compensate with rich insight, or interesting biographical detail, is  dashed in the first five minutes: it is clear that this is a tourist's  accompaniment to the Picasso career: rushed, rudimentary and finally  insulting.  Pricey, too.",926035200,3,1567,4.976833976833976
