7924763,3,B00004W5TN,"Nerve jangling telemovie based on the true story of Utah polygamist John Singer and his alleged murder at the hands of law enforcement officers. After Singer's death, Adam Swapp moved into the house with Singer's wife, Vickie, and her children, and they continued to wage war with the local community including blowing up the Marion LDS Chapel. Retreating into their ranch, the Swapp family held off law enforcement officials for many days who resisted storming the property due to the number of young children inside the fortified house. At the time, much was made by the media of the use of ""psychological pressure"" to try and dislodge the Singer family. Powerful searchlights, blaring horns and swooping helicopters were all used by law enforcement officials to disrupt the sleep of the occupants of the house and to try to force them to surrender.

The three male leads ( Dennis Franz as FBI agent, Bob Bryant ), ( Paul Le Mat as Utah Police Officer Doug Bodrero) and ( Kyle Secor as the deranged Adam Swapp ) all contribute solid consistent performances. Plus, a younthful William H. Macy as a frustrated SWAT officer, and Ed Begley Jr. as a police dog handler are equally effective in their roles. However, special mention should be made amongst this mostly male cast of Tess Harper as Vickie Singer.....Harper steadfastly conveys the unbalanced religious fanaticism of her character. Those eerie blue eyes of Harpers add even more effect to her chilling performance. One of the better telemovies recreating true crimes involving the FBI.",1096502400,8,1544,5.007782101167315
