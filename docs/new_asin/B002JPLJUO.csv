8371569,5,B002JPLJUO,"Zane Grey Theatre was a mainstay of German TV in the late 1950's. Many Germans loved American Westerns and there were plenty around at the time, Gunsmoke (TV Series 19551975), Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV Series 19581961), Have Gun - Will Travel (TV Series 19571963), Branded (TV Series 19651966), The Rifleman (TV Series 19581963), Rawhide (TV Series 19591965), Laramie (TV Series 19591963), Wagon Train (195762 and 196265), and Lawman (TV Series 19581962).

Just watching Zane Grey Theatre, you are reminded how good shows were written, how well they were acted and the sets, even though at times cheap, how they ultimately provided a more than reliable Western feel.

Frequent stars and character actors provided good action and fluid movement in the time allotted. Seeing them now, I am reminded how much I miss 1950's television.

Claude Akins, Eddie Albert, Martin Balsam, James Garner, Ernest Borgnine, David Janssen, Jack Elam, Burt Reynolds, Sterling Hayden, Cameron Mitchell, Jack Palance are just a few of the great actors that were on the show.

Of course, no one today will remember all these fine actors, which is a complete shame.",1452470400,2,1142,5.123655913978495
8371570,2,B002JPLJUO,The DVD covered too much on taking good pictures as opposed to operating the camera itself.  I learn best by being shown how something works; not so well by reading about it.  I still don't know how to take movies or how to change the speed and aperture settings.,1357862400,,263,4.346938775510204
8371571,4,B002JPLJUO,"If you're someone like me who has never studied photography or even know someone who has, you're probably going to need this video. i bought the camera for my wife who only wanted it to compete with her sisters. she rarely ever uses it. so when i lost my little point in shoot i decided to use her camera and try to at least get my moneys worth. i could not have done it without this video, very helpful, explains all the basics in a relatively short amount of time, one hour i think. it gave me a solid foundation to start exploring photography with. since then i have bought more lenses, filters a hood and tripod, cards to adjust the white balance etc. i find myself playing with the settings now instead of using the flash for a more natural look and actually half way understanding what im reading in the owners manual. So if you're going to spend six or seven hundred dollars on the camera it really does make since to try and get the most out of it for an extra $25.",1309564800,4,973,4.236559139784946
