8259775,5,B0015T0D1Q,"Bought for my youngest son and he loves the DVD.  Funny part is that his older brothers sit and watch with him.  Now every time we pass a tractor or a farm truck goes by he about jumps out of his seat points ""tractor, tractor!"" - cute to see.  Cool video.",1235174400,,255,3.9607843137254903
8259776,5,B0015T0D1Q,My sons are crazy for big trucks doing their thing.  I've finally found a DVD that shows real people (not actors) doing real work.  Every day one of them will find the package bring it to me and point to the TV.  The Big And Loud on a Construction Site is fantastic as well.,1217980800,,274,4.037037037037037
8259777,5,B0015T0D1Q,"My son just received this as a gift and absolutely loves it. The video has tractors, combines, trains and airplanes all being used on the farm - my son especially loves the airplanes. It's a nice change of pace for me to play something different than all his Disney/Little Einstein videos.",1217894400,,289,4.686274509803922
