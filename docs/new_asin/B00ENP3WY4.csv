5929222,5,B00ENP3WY4,Monday morning with West Point Class of 1967 reviewing their leadership roles and opinions on Vietnam.  The depth of their views is as extraordinary as is their diversity.  One would think that these Monday morning thoughts would provide some consensus that would be helpful in any future limited wars.  No such luck and so this may explain that the lessons of Vietnam proved to be worthless in our later adventures abroad.  Just well done and provocative without being judgmental.  The hope of unity among our war leaders is a myth not realized with these Vietnam vets,1380758400,2,569,4.885416666666667
5929223,5,B00ENP3WY4,"I was not just impressed but, really, stunned by how powerful it was. I almost never use the word ""riveting,"" but in this case it applies. I was basically transfixed from the first scene.

I watch a lot of World War II documentaries on the Military History Channel, and some of them are done very well. Of course, the original footage they include is quite powerful in and of itself, and that's a big advantage. But ""Into Harm's Way"" may well be the overall best documentary production I have ever seen, on any subject.

The content itself was extremely powerful, of course. Nothing is more compelling and moving than telling the actual stories of real people and the way experiences of the significance of West Point and Vietnam rocked and changed their lives. Every segment -- every profile -- was very well done. They all ""worked,"" and the variety of subjects and their different experiences gave the production a sense of being what I'll call solid at the base. Achieving that was Job One for you, I guess. The profiled officers seemed to be a broadly representative group, and that attribute communicated -- at least to me -- the solid foundation that gave the documentary such high credibility and impact.

In addition to the superlative storytelling aspect of ""Into Harm's Way,"" the camera work, the music, the editing were just superb, I thought, and arrested at least this viewer from the very first scene. The choice of music and the subtle way it was handled were especially effective, it seemed to me.",1379376000,5,1513,4.767175572519084

Disclosure-I am a member of that class so I acknowledge my bias.",1492992000,,162,4.225806451612903
8607112,5,B00ENP3WY4,"Anyone who was a young person during the Vietnam War era should see this. It describes what happened to several members of the West Point class of 1967 who went to Vietnam, and to one conscientious objector who didn't.  All of them are still haunted by what happened.",1418083200,,267,4.5625
8607113,5,B00ENP3WY4,"This is an extraordinary documentary, from the soldiers views and their storys about the beginnings and horrors of the Vietnam War and the politics that drove it. It is true and heart-wrenching. This is how the Vietnam War should be taught in schools and colleges. I highly recommend it to students and persons of that era and today.",1417737600,,333,4.758620689655173

8607115,5,B00ENP3WY4,Revealing insight about the cadets and what they were going to face after graduation.  This is a great documentary and history lesson.,1404172800,,134,5.090909090909091
8607116,5,B00ENP3WY4,"My husband is a member of the Class of '67 and volunteered for Vietnam upon graduation. While he didn't make the final cut for the movie, we are so very proud of those that did. Perhaps it was being forged in fire, but I can't imagine a closer knit class than this, a true Band of Brothers. What affects one, affects all.
We received our copy of Into Harm's Way at our last reunion, the 45th. For Christmas, each of our six children will receive a copy of this documentary.
Truly, the West Point Class of 1967 lives their motto: None Shall Surpass.",1386374400,,548,4.330097087378641
8607117,5,B00ENP3WY4,"I DISCOVERED THIS AS A DOCUMENTARY ON PBS...WAS SO THRILLED TO FIND I COULD PURCHASE THIS .

BEING MARRIED TO A VIETNAUM VET I SOMETIMES STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND HIS FEELINGS.  WATCHING THIS HAS GIVEN ME WONDERFUL INSIGHT INTO WHAT IT WAS REALLY LIKE ..I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS",1385078400,2,275,4.829787234042553
8607118,5,B00ENP3WY4,"I am a West Point grad and an Army psychiatrist.  Just watched this documentary at the Alexandria Film Festival.  It was one of the most powerful, moving accounts of the Vietnam war that I have ever seen or read.  I have not been able to stop thinking about it.  Few other historical accounts take the perspective of officers, and seeing the viewpoints of West Point officers, many of whom were affected by war as intensely as the Soldiers they led, was eye-opening.  The interviews, animation, and editing were also outstanding and just added to the remarkable quality of the film.  I strongly, strongly encourage every American to see this movie.",1384128000,3,648,4.845454545454546
8607119,5,B00ENP3WY4,"So I'm a little biased because I work with one of these incredible men.  Incredible documentary about these men, their experiences in and surrounding the war, and how some of them are doing now.",1383955200,2,194,4.705882352941177
8607120,5,B00ENP3WY4,"So my brother and I have diametrically opposing views of the Vietnam war, and this film was made for both of us. Whether you were a hippie or a supporter, you will find yourself in Into Harm's Way. It evokes the dichotomy of the sixties, when those coming of age had to make their best guess on an event that was beyond their comprehension. We are still living with the consequences of those decisions. If you are still wondering about the decisions you made, this is a film you should watch.",1383004800,,492,4.417582417582418
