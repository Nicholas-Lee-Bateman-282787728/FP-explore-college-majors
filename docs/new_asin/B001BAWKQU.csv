3487965,5,B001BAWKQU,"I'm not generally into sugar-coated, family-fun, romantic comedy type movies, but I really love it!  Even if the premise is a bit far-fetched, it's just so much fun to watch!  And Melissa Joan Hart and Mario Lopez make the cutest couple ever...",1226793600,2,244,4.785714285714286
3487966,5,B001BAWKQU,"I have liked Melissa Joan Hart since her days on Clarissa Explains It All so I was pleased to see she was back on TV again. This movie takes place at Christmas time and is basically a story about a woman who sees herself as a failure through her family's eyes and is hoping that bringing home her successful boyfriend for Christmas will prove she finally got something right, until he dumps her Christmas Eve and leaves her hanging.

She sees a very handsome man at the diner where she is working and tells her mom everything is hunky dory and kidnaps the handsome guy and takes him hostage (hence the handcuffs). From here the plot unravels in the typical romantic comedy faire where he is trying to convince everyone he's been kidnapped and she says it's a kind of joke he likes to play and we all get our happy ending. As I have said, it is the typically romantic comedy plot but there are some very funny moments and I can definitely see myself watching this movie again. If you like MJH, you will enjoy this movie.",1224720000,50,1019,4.391534391534392

3487970,5,B001BAWKQU,"About six years ago, I was a little bored and the ABC Family Channel made their content available online.
I didn't have cable so I was always searching for online content that Netflix couldn't offer back then. (Amazing what just a few years do with technology. Now almost everything can be found online.)
Back then, I stumbled across this movie:
To be honest, I'm not a fan of either actor but I wanted to entertain myself while I was writing. Oddly in order for me to write, I need a TV and radio going, yet they have to be entertaining.
The plot was silly and predictable, but it was well played out and the twist - or how everything is figured out at the end was sappy but awesome.
I highly recommend this movie!
PS... Don't go searching for it Youtube because those just lead you to other sites. I don't trust them.",1511740800,,819,4.359477124183006

3487979,5,B001BAWKQU,"My wife is the mushy one, but this actually made ME laugh. Melissa Joan Hart and Mario Lopez (from Saved By The Bell) actually do a wonderful job, create believable chemistry, and enable some truly enjoyable moments. No spoilers here but my favorite scene was the big Christmas Dinner where her family ""talks it out"". It sounded like a couple of scenes I've heard in real life. It's a Christmas staple for us now, along with the Grinch Cartoon, Charlie Brown, Babes in Toyland (the colorized Laurel and Hardy version), and others.

3488025,1,B001BAWKQU,"At first I was thinking this must be sounded good inside someone's head. But then I thought . . . who's? Were they using illegal drugs? This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a while. I heard that this had the biggest ratings ever of a Christmas movie for ABC Family. Uh . . . says a lot about American families.

Joan Hart looked hideous. I don't mean just in the scenes she was supposed to look like a mess. She just looked awful all over throughout.

I'll never understand the attraction to Lopez. He has one of the biggest mouths, lips, noses and faces around. And with those beady little eyes sunk back in that big mess . . . ewww. Of course he has to take his shirt off in a scene. Gag. He sounded so ghetto too. Just not a good fit for this character. He couldn't pull it off. He should do what he does best . . . steal other men's wives I guess.",1452470400,,854,4.017647058823529

3488028,5,B001BAWKQU,"After a brief false start, this movie pushes forward with the introduction of an aggressive mother (Markie Post as Mrs. Chandler), a dim and demanding father (Timothy Bottoms as Richard Chandler), and their put-upon daughter (Melissa Joan Hart as Gertrude).  Trudie is dumped just before shes due to present her boyfriend to her family for Christmas.  In desperation, waitress Trudie kidnaps a customer at gunpoint and brings him home for the holidays.  Trapped in the middle of nowhere, the sap (Mario Lopez as David) soon falls prey to Stockholm syndrome and begins to feel sorry for poor put-upon Trudie, an artist trapped in the job of a waitress, now caught up in a life of crime.
The conclusion comes as no surprise.  Because all romances blossom during a felony.

Oddly enough, crazy premise aside, this bizarre comedy/romance succeeds primarily due to the cast.  They grab the insanity and run with it; even while your brain is protesting the wrongness of it.",1450310400,4,967,4.975155279503106

3488044,5,B001BAWKQU,"I came across this movie on Netflix late one night when I couldn't fall asleep. I was looking for something not too taxing on my brain but would make me fall asleep; in short for something boring!! I like Melissa Joan Hart and always watch her given the chance. I expected the usual Christmas romance that was half silly and half make-believe but was pleasantly surprised to find a nice emotional story of a girl trying to win the approval of her family. Yes, the idea of kidnapping a boyfriend for the holidays was far-fetched but I quickly overlooked that in the beautiful narrative. The story was mostly realistic and the situations natural. I was touched by Joan Hart's portrayal of a neglected child seeking the affection and approval of her family. Mario Lopez did a very good job with his part. Overall very impressive.
I watched this movie more than a year ago but I still remember many scenes vividly which is a big feat for a Christmas movie. I have tried to watch it again since but unfortunately Netflix no longer has it available for instant streaming.",1442966400,,1065,4.64021164021164

Which is strange since it was broadcast in widescreen -- Or at least not stretched out like a non-letterboxed movie.  We've watched the broadcast version the last few years on the exact same TV as we watched this DVD..and THIS DVD version was all stretched out and too annoying to watch!

3488106,1,B001BAWKQU,"This was such a horribly written film. Not that I'm a raging feminist, more of a run of the mill femmy, but the mysogynistic ""jokes"" were rampant. Imagine my surprise when I realized it wasn't written by some archaic Republican man (there are many derogatory democrat references) but by a woman! The tree topper for me was a joke about her family thinking she preferred ""innies"" but thankfully the man she kidnapped was an ""outtie"". Ew.

Unbelievable, unrealistic, terribly written and poorly acted. Saving grace? Granny Delores. Skip it unless you can have an MST3K type discussion with whoever is unlucky enough to be forced to watch this with you.",1419552000,,650,4.909090909090909

3488132,5,B001BAWKQU,I have liked Melissa Joan Hart since her days on Clarissa Explains It All so I was pleased to see she was back on TV again. This movie takes place at Christmas time and is basically a story about a woman who sees herself as a failure through her family's eyes and is hoping that bringing home her successful boyfriend for Christmas will prove she finally got something...,1391731200,,371,4.470588235294118

3488134,1,B001BAWKQU,"ABC calls this a FAMILY movie???  You've GOT to be kidding!!  Cursing.  Swearing.  Sexual innuendo, lewdness, and perversion.  What kind of a family watches that kind of garbage?  What kind of parent subjects their child to that kind of trash?  Not I, and the trash is exactly where my copy of this movie is going.  Another ABC ""Family"" movie, Christmas In Boston, is even worse with its horrid language and sexual scenes.  Why would I teach my child to curse and take God's name in vain?  Why would I teach my child that these things are good and wholesome?  ABC's definition of ""Family"" entertainment is a joke at best and perverted and grossly wrong at worst.  ABC needs to take a lesson from some of the Hallmark movies I've seen to find out what is appropriate family viewing.  (I've only seen a few Hallmark movies on DVD so I can't vouch for them all.)  Not only do I not want my children to see this movie, I don't' want to see this kind of garbage myself.  I should have read the one-star reviews before buying, and I have learned my lesson.  If you care about your family, do NOT buy this movie.",1391385600,2,1105,4.396039603960396

It is the typical ""love coming out of nowhere"" movie that Hallmark is known for but the surrounding story is melded well with this theme.  It was wonderful to see June Lockhart again.  The character she played was hilarious.  Love that Grandma!  This would be a great addition to your holiday DVD stack.  Enjoy!",1391040000,,393,4.608695652173913

3488149,5,B001BAWKQU,"I love Melissa Joan Hart and Mario Lopez. This is a bit of an unconventional premise, kidnapping, but it turns into a typical family situation, with a stranger forced to endure them for Christmas, dysfunction and all, through the end to the possibility of change and love and family acceptance. It's a beautiful movie, because I love log homes and the home they rent in the mountains is gorgeous, and the whole cast is beautiful, or extremely handsome. It is an unlikely premise, nonetheless turns out to be a warm, funny, well acted and romantic Christmas movie. Well acted, great cast . . . June Lockhart, Markie Post, Timothy Bottoms etc . . . and I believe you will get the warms and fuzzies.",1388016000,,696,4.620967741935484
3488150,3,B001BAWKQU,"this movie follows an oft-done formula of a girl who is afraid to disappoint her family and cooks up a fake boyfriend. In this case, the girl seems a bit out of control. She gets dumped right before heading out for Christmas. Instead of hiring a fake boyfriend, like some movies of this type, she kidnaps one from the restaurant where she works. There are a number of implausible plot twists that keep him from being able to extricate himself. It turns out he was supposed to have met his fiancee when he was kidnapped so when he wasn't at the restaurant it caused friction which allowed him to end up with his kidnapper. While there are a few cute scenes in the movie and while it gets better towards the end, this one is just a bit too unbelievable to be great. I found the movie to be watchable but not terribly memorable. I suppose that for a TV movie, the quality of production and acting isn't bad, but this isn't the best Christmas romance movie you will find.",1387670400,,967,4.377777777777778

3488156,2,B001BAWKQU,It was ok but I'm a little tired of seeing Brown & Black men getting snagged by the white blonde beauty stereotype.  I would have enjoyed a Latino cast more and think it would leave a better impression on Brown kids.  And since I don't celebrate Xmas the sentiment was lost on me.,1385596800,,280,4.264150943396227

3488162,4,B001BAWKQU,"This is nice little Rom-com. You do have to suspend reality but then again you have to do that in most movies so it wasn't a problem for me.

The story is kind of wacky but sweet. Acting was above average but not great. All-in-all a nice movie that we will watch most Christmas seasons from now on.

It is not a great Christmas movie like the original 'Miracle on 34th Street' or 'It's a Wonderful Life'. If you've seen 'A Boyfriend for Christmas' then you will know what I mean - watching it is a nice way to spend 90 minutes or so.

I would rate this a very solid 7.75 to 8.25 on a 10 point scale. It's a nice movie at a very low price (I paid $6.99 from Amazon).",1383177600,,665,3.9849624060150375
3488163,4,B001BAWKQU,"Cute and clever holiday film with surprisingly good acting!!  With such a premise, I had my doubts that this would be worthwhile, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It gets a bit kooky at times, but all in all, well worth a look see.  My favorite scene was Trudie being released from jail and the tearful goodbye, Trudie looking at David seemingly walking out of her life...and what the hell was that tune playing in the background to that sequence???  I agree with others who wish there was a sountrack to this!  Very underrated score!  Melissa Joan Hart and Mario Lopez make an awfully cute couple here, and I'm surprised they haven't been teamed up again.  Fun to see June Lockhart playing a flirty grandma!!!  Love her reaction to the knowledge her grandson is gay.  Check it out...I think you'll like this!!!",1382745600,,811,4.695035460992908

My sister and husband watched it with me, and we completely rolled our eyes and made fun of the entire thing.  Plot is ridiculous, and makes you want to beat your head against the wall.  I've always been a fan of both Melissa and Mario, but the acting in this story was just horrendous.  The only reason we finished is because my sister insisted.  We all thought it would get better.  It didn't.  I'd rate it a zero if possible!  Complete waste of your holiday movie watching time!",1350604800,4,599,4.5327102803738315

3488211,5,B001BAWKQU,"This is definitely a made-for-TV movie and it is a bit predictable.

But given that, I think it is an enjoyable romantic comedy with a great cast and well acted.  Maybe it's not as good as a high dollar Hollywood flick but if you are after a relaxing and enjoyable movie that doesn't require a lot of brain power to keep track of the plot, consider this movie.",1338595200,,360,4.279411764705882

3488214,5,B001BAWKQU,Very intertaining movie. Loved it from beginning to end. I have a seven year old granddaughter who is still watching it everyday after school. She loves it too. It's just a great little holiday movie.,1327449600,,200,4.742857142857143
3488215,5,B001BAWKQU,I don't think this movie is as bad as some people seem to think. Any sexual innuindos or refererences to such were countable at best including the fact that her brother is gay. Now lets get to whats good and what I like about this movie. It has Melissa Joan Hart from Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Mario Lopez from Saved by the Bell not that that makes a difference. I just like those two actors. And I like this movie. All it showed was a girl who was desperate to tell her family one positive thing about her life for Christmas to the point that when her fiancee dumps her her desperation kicks into overdrive and she resorts to kidnaping. And by the  way if look at the way her family acts you can see where she got her desperation and her craziness. I just watched this movie so I should know. Anyway as I said it was out of desperation that she resorted to kidnaping. Fortunally for all concerned they fall in love. It may not be the best of Christmas movies but its far from the worst. Id recommend it. Merry Christmas.,1326931200,,1025,4.256410256410256

3488219,5,B001BAWKQU,"I saw this on TV a few years ago. I've been trying to find it since then. You get tired of the same old Christmas movies redone over and over again. Melissa Joan Hart & Mario Lopez are great in this movie. The premise is a little over the top but IT'S A MOVIE NOT REAL LIFE!!! When I watch a movie I want to forget about everything else for a while. This is a movie that you can do that!! This will become a yearly Christmas movie for me!!

Getting the movie from a seller that I deal with repeatedly was a bonus. I knew that I would get the movie in great condition and in a timely manner!",1325548800,,590,3.9166666666666665

3488221,2,B001BAWKQU,Thought this was going to be a good wholesome movie. If you have values than you might not want to get this. Was very disappointed in it.,1324944000,,137,4.111111111111111
3488222,3,B001BAWKQU,"I'm wasn't a too big a fan of the Sabrina - Teenage Witch"" Tv-series. Maybe I was too old to fully appreciate it. Now that Melissa Joan Hart is grown-up and plays grown-up roles I can appreciate her more. ""Holiday In Handcuffs"" was shown on Swedish TV just a few days before christmas and it was just as good as I remember it to be. Ok,so kidnapping might not be the best way to start a relationship but what is a desperate girl to do when she's dumped by her boyfriend just before she's to embark on a trip to meet her folks. You don't need to be a brain surgeon to figure out the plot line but it's not the story that matters but the journey to get to the punch line that is the interesting. So if you like your movies sappy and teardrenched, look elsewhere because this is light-hearted and quite fun entertainment for most of the family.

3488225,5,B001BAWKQU,"Two of my most favorite stars, Mario Lopez and Melissa Joan Hart are great together. This is not a family movie for young children, but it is a silly comedy about a young woman who snaps. Her boyfriend dumps her the day he is suppose to meet her family, and she ends up kidnapping a total stranger and falling for him. It has become a holiday favorite for me, and a popular movie for many during the season.",1322956800,,407,4.230769230769231
3488226,1,B001BAWKQU,"Let's just say I wish I had read all the one star ratings accurately given to this movie before watching it!!! It didn't seem ""too"" bad, wasn't entirely terrible and was actually rather funny at times until it was ruined about 2/3rds into the movie when the homosexual part comes in and was accepted and embraced as OK, laughed over, and even the Dad who wasn't OK with it at first, becomes OK with it in the end when he meets the son's 'boyfriend'. If you are OK with this lifestyle then you might not have a problem with the movie, but just be advised that this along with other sexual referances are made through out the movie... and it's only rated PG. And holding somebody at gun-point, even if you aren't intending to fire, is not acceptable. She was just lucky that when she accidently fired, the bullet missed....not too realistic to show to our children!",1322870400,8,863,4.503184713375796

3488228,5,B001BAWKQU,I love this show.  It is for sure a chick flick.  I watch this every year around christmas time.  My husband is great and watches it every year with me.  It is one of the many christmas movies we watch at our house.,1321574400,,215,3.9302325581395348

Simple answer, handcuff someone and convince them to go along with your implausible scheme.  Okay, I get it, it isn't rocket science, but it is a charming movie starring Melissa Joan Hart and Mario Lopez.  Some may call it mindless entertainment, but in my opinion, it is a Christmas movie for the entire family.  It is wholesome fun and a real feel good story.  One small caveat, there is some sexual content and it may not be for everyone, but most people, I believe, will enjoy this fun movie.",1319500800,3,618,4.433628318584071

Overall I enjoyed this movie, while it was a little slow to start up and the story seemed a little disjointed at times, I still got into it. It did sort of end a bit briefly which was disappointing but it is a chickflick so you know from early on how it will end. Overall a good movie, likeable characters, a story that many people could relate to as far as judging parents are concerned and a bit of romance thrown in for good luck...I would watch it again!",1310860800,,617,4.237288135593221
3488231,3,B001BAWKQU,"Definitely a chick flick, this thing isn't geared for the single male.  I knew that when I made the purchase, but was hoping for more than a movie of the week production.  The story lacks some credibility, even for a rom-com, and other than the camera work (standard and uninspired) that's its only real fault.

A few more dollars could've really livened up this production and not only made it credible in terms of the major plot point around which the story revolves, but it might have also ratcheted up the comedy by a few degrees.  As it is now it's just a simple film that has a girlish/feminine appeal of the out of luck single in search of her knight in shining armor, even if she has to violate the Mann Act.

Not a very bright production, but it is an ABC TV film.  Take it for what it is.",1298678400,3,798,4.251655629139073

Thank you to the Amazon vendor who sent it via airmail reindeer for me.  This is another tv movie that shows up each year during December on cable.  I was anxious to have a copy for myself since I plan to watch it periodically all year long - not just during the holidays.  Well cast, humorous, predictable but truly enjoyable plot! Worth a look if you have a chance to catch it.",1294963200,,544,4.4
3488235,5,B001BAWKQU,"I've been a fan of Melissa Joan Hart since she was a kid, and I knew this DVD would be excellent. The fireworks with Mario Lopez lit up the screen, and I could really see the sparks of tension between their characters.  Holiday In Handcuffs is sophisticated, clever and witty! The story is convoluted, but the twists and turns make it all convincing. Teens and adults will love it!

Without a doubt, the best part of this film was Melissa Joan Hart's acting skills. This might have been a silly, screwball comedy, but she brought to it a degree of subtelty that I truly admired. I'll watch this movie over and over again just to be amazed by her facial expressions!

3488236,2,B001BAWKQU,"My family and I were flipping through channels and settled on this movie last night.  Seemed like it might be funny and mildly diverting.  Our expectations weren't high.

I was pretty surprised by the sexual content though (ABC *FAMILY* --we were watching it with our 10-year-old) and the overall message is appalling.  Think about if the genders were reversed!  That was briefly brought home when Melissa Joan Hart's character was ""kidnapped"" at the end -- you know who it must be so there's an automatic ""awww,"" but just by itself, it's a woman, by herself, at night, being blindfolded and kidnapped by an unknown assailant -- yikes!

The overall message seems to be basically ""take what you want by force -- it will all work out in the end.""  Ewwww[...]

I give this two stars rather than one because Mario Lopez and Melissa Joan Hart gave appealing performances, and there were enough funny parts that we watched through to the end before saying ""well that absolutely sucked.""  But yeah, overall it pretty much sucked.",1292198400,4,1022,4.827586206896552

3488244,5,B001BAWKQU,"This is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies.  I watch it at least half a dozen times every year.  Yes, it is far fetched.  Most women don't go around kidnapping people to pass of as their boyfriend, and if they did, the two probably wouldn't fall in love.  But if  you can step out of reality for a little while and you have even an iota of a sense of humor, then you'll like this movie.  I didn't even like Melissa Joan Hart before I viewed this movie, and now I think she's adorable!  If you are prudish, judgmental, negative and just a plain old boring person who couldn't appreciate make-believe if you had to, then don't bother watching this.  Honestly, the movie is not alarming and offensive like some of these reviews are making it out to be, and I'm a conservative for crying out loud.  This movie is a snowy cabin in the woods, lots of laughs. feel-good kind of movie!",1260748800,12,887,4.327272727272727
3488245,4,B001BAWKQU,"First and foremost, yes, the plot is silly and unbelievable.  What did you expect?  One of the negative reviewers complained that the characters made choices ""for which there is no believable consequence"".  So?  Movies are not supposed to be an accurate portrayal of reality; they're meant to be an escape from reality, a fantasy.  If you want reality, then go watch a documentary.

Second, this is not a family-friendly movie.  I have to agree with the other reviewers that there is definitely too much sexual banter to be appropriate for viewing by children.  Yes, it's only talk, but it's still not stuff I would be saying around children.

Third, the marketing department should have come up with better cover art.  The fact that the scene depicted is not in the movie is forgivable.  The fact that the image of Melissa Joan Hart looks nothing like she does in reality is not forgivable.

Lastly, if you're so bigoted, small-minded, and insecure that the mere mention of someone being a homosexual (mentioned in only two scenes) ruins the movie experience for you, then yes, look elsewhere.  Those people who actually watch and understand the movie will know why it was included.

Having said all that, this really is a good movie.  Yes, it's unbelievable.  Yes, it does start off slow.  And yes, the family arguing is reminiscent of reality, but it's necessary for the storyline.  The characters themselves are believable and the acting is superb.  Melissa Joan Hart gives a top-notch performance ensuring that you can't help but fall in love with her character.

With regard to Christmas, this movie misses the mark because it really has very little to do with Christmas.  With that said, it is a good movie, and I'll definitely be watching it again.",1259884800,2,1756,4.864864864864865

3488250,2,B001BAWKQU,"Let's be honest, Gertrude Chandler(Melissa Joan Hart) is a little crazy.

I mean really, of you saw this chick ranting and storming around the way she does, reminiscent of a tornado of sorts, you'd want to walk on the other side of the street instead of taking the chance of crossing paths with HER.

Truthfully, I would be the one leading the pack, because this girls got more then just a few screws loose.

You see, Gertrude just can't handle the stress that preparing for the holidays has seemed to throw at her, especially attempting to fool her parents into believing she's the perfect daughter.

Of course when her boyfriend conveniently dumps her just before Gertrude has to leave to see her family, and in her panic Gertrude does what every woman does.... turns to kidnapping?(yikes!)

Unfortunate bystander, David(Mario Lopez) becomes the victim of Trudie's poorly executed last minute plan to kidnap David and play him off to her family as her absent boyfriend Nick.

Due to the fact that very muscular David cannot seem to run away from this rather small blond woman, he attempts to go along with her plan while they slowly fall in love.(awww, predictable!)

I suppose their have been worse movies, but this plot is so unbelievable some of it is utterly cringe worthy. What grown man in his right mind would allow himself to stay captive all holiday because some immature woman won't tell her parents her boyfriend dumped her? It's all rather pathetic.

Not to mention for an ABC Family movie I am really not sure I can put my finger on the morale of this kidnapping story. Hey Kids, If you ever get dumped too close to the holidays, just steal somebody for a while and build a relationship on lies, maybe they'll fall in love with you!

Yeah, that's about how much sense this whole film makes.

Watch it if you want to stare at Mario Lopez for a while, he really can't act but he is rather pretty... and that's really all it's good for.",1249344000,5,1948,4.620289855072464

This is a very entertaining movie. I guess what really ""made"" the movie was the talented cast! It takes a while to get going, but stay with it. The climax and the end are very funny and definitely worth the wait. This movie is a light, and I'm sure some would say, ""fluffy"" movie; but it's a lot of fun to watch. Mario Lopez is a very unappreciated actor and I feel that Melissa Joan Hart can carry off cute and funny without trying - or seeming unbelievable. Not everyone can carry it off. Ms. Lockhart is hilarious as the grandmother. The ""rich girlfriend"" and her mother are so atypical, whereas their maid is an absolute hoot!

I thought the idea had potential for romantic comedy, but they blew it on both levels.

3488262,5,B001BAWKQU,"This is a funny holiday flick if you aren't too stuck on a ""Family"" movie. As other reviews noted, Melissa Joan Hart plays a girl desperate to bring her great boyfriend home to show her family how successful she is. Right at the moment her career is not great so the boyfriend is all she feels she has. Unfortunately, successful boy dumps her right before traveling to the family home and she, well, loses it, and kidnaps random stranger - Mario Lopez.

Part of the fun is that Melissa Joan Hart's character manages to keep Lopez kidnapped for about a day or so because the entire idea of a woman doing this is so insane, all she need do is tell people it is a game the two love birds like to play. Also after about a day it is clear that Lopez character is no longer concerned about being kidnapped and decides to go with it. Thus, making it a little more believable that this sort of thing could happen. After all, she kidnapped him to a loving family gathered in a plush Christmas cabin.  But if you are going to watch a movie called Christmas in handcuffs, maybe reality isn't what you are looking for.

I thought the side plots were somewhat pointless but meant to show that the rest of the family were having just as many problems as the main character. What sells this is Hart and Lopez. Good chemistry, and Hart's character does regret what she did after the initial insanity has worn off but has little choice but to keep the charade up.",1229817600,9,1446,4.368029739776952
3488263,5,B001BAWKQU,Oh i just love this movie. It is truely a wonderful holiday movie. Mario Lopez&Melissa Joan Hart are wonderful in this movie. I love when she steals him away from the diner.

3488264,3,B001BAWKQU,"This is a potentially cute family movie that loses its focus.  Is it intended to be an amusing, enjoyable piece of family entertainment or is it intended to be a socialogical statement about disfunctional families?  Whoever did the movie apparently could not decide.  Most of the movie is an enjoyable, fun story of a girl under pressure from her family, who, on the spur of the moment, does something crazy--kidnaps a young man so she can show up at the family party with a date.  The problem is that, probably in an attempt to justify her feelings of frustration and pressure that drove her to this action, we suddenly get into issues of parents who need counseling for sexual problems and for determination to control their children's behavior, and the acceptance of homosexuality.  In my opinion, these are issues that are appropriate to a movie with a more serious purpose aimed at a mature audience, but is completely inappropriate to a comedy intended for the entire family.  Of course, it is possible that the ABC Family Channel may feel that that is there purpose--delivering the serious-issue pill inside a comedy candy wrapping.  But I didn't feel that it made for a good mix.",1228694400,3,1187,4.817733990147783

8282587,5,B001BAWKQU,such a cute story,1525651200,,17,3.5
8282588,5,B001BAWKQU,"I first saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-in-Handcuffs/dp/B001BAWKQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday in Handcuffs</a>&nbsp;when it aired on TV, and I liked it so much, that when I saw it not only in the encore showing but in pretty much every one of its airings during the Christmas holiday season, I decided that I might as well get it on DVD to have a tangible copy to see whenever & whenever desired.

Like I said in the review title,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-in-Handcuffs/dp/B001BAWKQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday in Handcuffs</a>&nbsp;is a light-hearted and funny holiday romantic comedy starring Melissa Joan Hart (star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clarissa-Explains-It-All/dp/B0007Y08LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clarissa Explains It All</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabrina-The-Teenage-Witch/dp/B01619206U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabrina, The Teenage Witch</a>) and Mario Lopez (co-star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saved-by-the-Bell/dp/B00ELKDDWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saved by the Bell</a>. The rest of the cast includes Markie Post, June Lockhart, Timothy Bottoms & others.

Without giving away the entire movie (like so many reviewers annoyingly do!)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-in-Handcuffs/dp/B001BAWKQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday in Handcuffs</a>&nbsp;is basically about a young woman, the typical ""starving artist"" Gertrude ""Trudie"" Chandler (Melissa Joan Hart) who is struggling to earn a living with her art, while working as a waitress to make ends meet (but barely!) and longing for the ""break"" her career needs.

Unfortunately, NOTHING seems to go right for Trudie, from problems with her hair,  to being nagged/picked on by her mother (played by Markie Post) about her clothes and appearance, to problems with an interview for a ""real job"" that her critical & uptight, conventional, conservative-type father (played by Timothy Bottoms) sets up for her, to car troubles, the list goes on and on. The proverbial ""icing on the cake"" is when Trudie's boyfriend, Nick (played by Ben Ayres) who was supposed to accompany her to meet her family for a Christmas vacation at a rented cabin in the middle of nowhere, dumps her out of the blue -- just moments before they are supposed to leave and obviously refuses to join her to meet her parents. That's when Trudie ""goes off the deep end"" and the wackiness begins!

Desperate to come up with another ""Nick"" to get her disapproving parents off her back, she comes across David Martin (Mario Lopez) who is waiting to meet his girlfriend, Jessica (played by Gabrielle Miller) at the diner where Trudie is working. With just minutes before she is supposed to leave, and not knowing what else to do, Trudie ""snaps"" and using her boss's antique pistol, she kidnaps David Martin and holds him hostage, to come & spend the Christmas holidays with her dysfunctional family, pretending to be her boyfriend ""Nick"". Of course, David isn't interested in doing any such thing, and when he tries to get away, Trudie blindfolds & restrains him with her pantyhose, in the car during the journey. Upon arriving at the cabin, they meet Trudie's family, including her brother, Jake (played by Kyle Howard) and sister, Katie (played by Vanessa Evigan) both of whom, like Trudie are hiding big secrets of their own. They are also soon joined by Trudie's feisty & sassy but somewhat senile (think Sophia Petrillo from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Girls/dp/B002N8WLYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Girls</a>) maternal grandmother (played by June Lockhart). Although David is essentially trapped in a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, with Trudie's family during the Christmas holidays, naturally, he nevertheless tries various means to escape as well as to inform Trudie's family that he is NOT really her boyfriend ""Nick"", but rather that she kidnapped him and is holding him hostage!

However, despite Trudie's generally poorly executed, last minute plan, she is rather ""quick on her feet"", and manages to humorously explain it all away -- and though admittedly, its not very realistic (but hey its a MOVIE and NOT real-life -- and its NOT meant to be 100% plausible, or taken completely seriously!) her family buys her excuses, and genuinely believes that David is really Nick, her handsome and successful boyfriend. Although David tries a few more times to try to run away, or get help, eventually he agrees to stay with the Chandlers and temporarily keep up the charade of being Trudie's ""perfect boyfriend, Nick"" -- and to pull it off, he spends lots of time with Trudie & her family, and starts really getting to know them. Not that he has much choice in the matter, though, being stuck in a remote cabin in the mountains, 20 miles from civilization, with no TV, little to no phone access (you'll see why I said ""little to no"" phone access, when you watch this movie) no Internet access, nothing. Anyway, in particular, David spends a lot of time with Trudie, and as he learns more about her, NOT just as the crazy woman who kidnapped him & held him hostage -- but rather, the REAL Trudie Chandler, he also learns more about himself and what he truly wants & doesn't want out of his life. In the process of this self-discovery, David finds himself actually (gasp!) having FUN with Trudie & the rest of the Chandlers!

Meanwhile, as the bombshell secrets of various family members are dropped, its clear that David is (or has become) ""one of the family"" -- and he realizes he LIKES IT, and enjoys being there with them........................but the problem is, of course, that he's NOT really Trudie's boyfriend, or her guest, but her HOSTAGE!

What to do now?? What happens to Trudie, and David, his girlfriend Jessica, and the Chandlers?

Well, you'll either have to watch the movie or read one of the other reviews that include spoilers (but personally, I suggest seeing the movie, rather than reading spoilers) to find out, and see all of the hilarity & adventure that ensue -- and the lives that are forever changed because of Trudie's impulsive & crazy stunt!

Basically,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-in-Handcuffs/dp/B001BAWKQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday in Handcuffs</a>&nbsp;is a very endearing and light-hearted romantic comedy, that's family-friendly & suitable for almost all ages. As far as I can recall (I last saw this film during the Christmas holidays and its almost May now, so my recollections *might* be kind of fuzzy) there is little to no foul language, no graphic violence or sexual scenes, or anything that would be unsuitable for anyone, except maybe the youngest kids, if even that. Yes, this movie is a storyline about a kidnapping and there is a gun & gunshot involved, but there is no blood or gore -- and the violence in this movie, if there IS any, is very minimal, and in my view, not scary at all. This film is essentially 90 minutes of of fluffy Christmas entertainment, that doesn't require a lot of concentration and focus (though there needs to be *some* -- especially towards the end!) and is just a funny holiday movie that one can watch while wrapping Christmas presents or trimming the tree, or baking or decorating holiday cookies or folding laundry or whatever other mindless tasks.

Although this movie is NOT a blockbuster theatrical-release film with a massive budget & big-name stars -- but rather a low-budget, made-for-TV movie, its still a GREAT film. Melissa Joan Hart is WONDERFUL as Trudie Chandler, the struggling artist & waitress who's so desperate for her parents approval, love & acceptance that she ""snaps"" and turns into a hapless, bumbling kidnapper. Mario Lopez is just as AWESOME (as Melissa is) playing Trudie's unwitting hostage, David Martin. Because in addition to his acting skills, he's DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS in this movie (he's so handsome, that even I almost wish that I could kidnap him myself) which makes him the BEST CASTING CHOICE for the role of Trudie's ""perfect boyfriend, Nick"". Meanwhile, June Lockhart is HILARIOUS as Trudie's sharp-tongued, and somewhat senile grandma (for the same reason[s] why I  the now-late Estelle Getty's portrayal of Sophia Petrillo on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Girls/dp/B002N8WLYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Girls</a>). The other characters while not as great as Hart, Lopez or Lockhart, are still quite memorable. Its been several months since I've seen this movie, and I still get a chuckle/laugh at the remembrance of the scene when Trudie's mother (Markie Post) and father (Timothy Bottoms) are ranting at each other at Christmas Dinner.

All in all, especially for being a made-for-TV movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-in-Handcuffs/dp/B001BAWKQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday in Handcuffs</a>&nbsp;is TERRIFIC!

In fact, in my honest opinion, its probably my FAVORITE Christmas movie -- or at least one of my top faves, especially among those which are NOT specifically or primarily kid-targeted (such as CLASSICS like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer/dp/B00LEW3JN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Charlie-Brown-Christmas/dp/B073VC9D8X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a>, the animated version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Seuss-How-the-Grinch-Stole-Christmas/dp/1419882996/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</a>&nbsp;& others) and/or family-friendly fare (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Santa-Clause/dp/B008NB0SBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Santa Clause</a>&nbsp;with Tim Allen or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-ll-Be-Home-For-Christmas/dp/B00004Z1GR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'll Be Home For Christmas</a>&nbsp;with Jonathan Taylor Thomas & Jessica Biel).
