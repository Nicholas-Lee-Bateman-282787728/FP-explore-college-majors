8450164,4,B004ZKNBXE,"Root of Evil, or Acacia, follows Mi-sook and Do-il as they adopt Jin-seong. The transition is as rough as one would except; however, things gets stranger when Jin-seong is attracted to the acacia tree in the backyard he believes is his mother. Root of Evil is a creepy, haunting, and beautifully-shot film.

The story in Root of Evil isn't a pure thriller or horror film; it uses elements from both genres to create a psychological thriller/horror film. It has a slow pace that I believe worked for the film instead of against it; I felt it added to the creepiness and added to the haunting effect. There are a few very effective jump-scares in the film, but it mostly relies on the tension, the atmosphere, and the creepiness. The film can be unsettling thanks to the great performances and disturbing yet realistic scenes; for example, there's a scene where Jin-Seong's jealousy and rage becomes evident as he makes the new baby cry and attempts to quite him by smothering him. The ending is twisted, and has some very haunting imagery I won't spoil. The acting is great, and the music was excellent. The film is also shot beatifully, and often uses some very vibrant colors to create vivid imagery. It can be a bit too ambiguous and the pace can be a problem for some viewers.

Overall, Root of Evil is a slow-burning psychological horror/thriller worth watching for those that can handle slow-paced films. It's another great film from South Korea.

Root of Evil has some strong violence and blood. And it has a brief rape scene (no nudity).",1366156800,,1544,4.732342007434944
8450165,4,B004ZKNBXE,"[ROOT OF EVIL aka ACACIA -(2005)- Widescreen presentation - in Korean with English subtitles] Palisades took control of Tartan Asia about two years ago, and didn't release anything new for ages, but did repackage a few Tartan movies before recently recycling a handful of older titles under new names with current release dates, a dubious and deceptive marketing strategy where I come from. This is one of them - this film is not a 2011 release, but a 2005 release titled 'ACACIA' that was also on the Tartan Asia Extreme label, just so you're aware. I almost purchased it unsuspectingly, owning almost all Tartan releases for their high quality arthouse Asian horror and superlative crime drama flicks, until I found out it's just been retitled and regurgitated (a practice they must have learned from MYA Communications - look MYA up and read my reviews as proof).

Here's the synopsis: Korean director Ki-Hyung Park ('WHISPERING CORRIDORS', one of a girl's school ghost film trilogy that's highly effective) continues his exploration of the supernatural with the thriller ACACIA. After a couple's efforts to conceive continually end in disappointment, they adopt young Jin-seong, whose mother has died. Jin-seong seems obsessively drawn to a tree in the couple's backyard which never bore fruit or blossoms until the child's arrival, as he constantly climbs and draws pictures of it. But when his new mother finally manages to become pregnant, Jin-seong disappears, and a number of strange occurrences - and dead bodies - pile up, all seemingly centered on the mysterious tree. ACACIA has the slow pace and atmospheric build-up common to many Asian horror films, but adequately delivers the goods to those with patience. Recommended to fans of Asian horror, suspense and the supernatural.

Despite the deceptive marketing, I'm hoping Palisades Tartan continues to release NEW films in the tradition of the old Tartan, as their truly current release, 'Matrimony', is a fine arthouse occult tale (though this too is from 2006, but had no official US release), and they have pre-release dates for a few more films planned for the near future. I guess Palisades is capitalizing on their acquisition, and we must remember that money is the 'ROOT OF EVIL'...",1321142400,19,2255,5.141689373297003
