8425965,5,B004DTS0VU,"I was delighted to find out about this video & I immediately bought it, and watched it on Amazon. Dr. Earle, now 76 years old is here spreading ocean awareness and enjoying the reef with none other than Mr. Rogers. It's fascinating to see how Dr. Earle points out challenges to the ocean that have since become critical issues. Highly recommend for all divers and ocean lovers! We need more current videos like this today to share with our children about the ocean environment.",1326931200,,477,4.690476190476191
