4666327,3,B005ELVCVQ,"Surprise! surprise!  I am a senior and never new 3d was instramental in the war.  If, nothing more i truly believe the film is worth the $20 bucks.  The existing reviews sum up the value of the film very well.",1330128000,,209,4.175
4666328,5,B005ELVCVQ,Fast service and product. The video was good. I learned a lot. I had no idea that 3 d technology was used in WWII.,1330041600,,114,3.7916666666666665
4666329,3,B005ELVCVQ,"I saw this for preorder and I just had to get it. I waited for about a month and then received it. The whole movie is about how 3D was used in the time of World War II, how Hitler would want to use 3D to glorify his army and how the pilots used 3D to get better perception and accuracy with their bombing, not really about the war filmed in 3D. I thought they could remaster the footage in 3D or maybe they can, but this DVD doesn't show that. It does show a lot of pictures taken back then in 3D, but only one short 3D live footage scene where a group of German Soldiers are firing Flack on the Ally airplanes. I guess there is only that one 3D live footage scene left that survived the war, the rest was destroyed. I was hoping to see the story of World War II shown in 3D. Even though this DVD was really interesting to know and had some cool pictures, it wasn't what I was expecting. You might think it is really cool and maybe this is what you are expecting to see. I think it is cool stuff to know, but I probably will not watch it again.",1329523200,13,1044,3.9526066350710902
4666330,3,B005ELVCVQ,"This documentary focuses on Hitler's use of 3D during WWII. He began using 3D photos for propaganda purposes. After all, 3D is impressive...well, I think it is.  There is also a 3D movie clip which might have been used to train  soldiers in the proper use of certain weapons. Later, the Allies began using 3D imagery for aerial reconnaissance.  One of the historians in this documentary is impressed with these WWII, 3D photos & the 3D movie stating that the 3D images help him pick out details that he normally would overlook.  3D wasn't entirely new at that time. Stereoscopic technology has been around  since 1838. I was impressed with the 97 year old Frenchman who has been taking 3D photos for 80 years. Although, Hitler decreed that photography was unlawful, this Frenchman would take photos whenever he was able. (There is an interesting color photo he took of a US soldier).

The majority of the photos are black and white. For the most part, the 3D quality of the movie is fine. I saw some crosstalk/ghosting in a few of the old photos.

My husband & I found this documentary to be interesting, but not worth $20.  It focuses on 3D and how it was used by Hitler & later, the Allied forces, during WWII. As far as WWII history is concerned, I don't think anything new will be learned from this documentary.",1329523200,48,1315,4.589743589743589
4666331,5,B005ELVCVQ,"A must for any World War II and 3D buff! Hitler, Germany, Nazis, and American's liberating Paris! Amazing images! You have never seen these photos and films before! Who knew the Nazi's and The Allies used 3D for propaganda, training, and spying? This is the first time some of these images have been shown since the 1940s.  I don't know what that other reviewer was taking about, but there are NOT repeated images other than the ones in the show tease at the top of the show.  This should be shown in schools.",1329350400,,509,4.462365591397849
4666332,2,B005ELVCVQ,"A lot of what you watch in this offering is someone else wearing 3D glasses looking at a monitor telling the off-camera host how amazing the photos are. And that's what this is, a collection of black and white 3D photos on video in 3D with one very short motion segment of some soldiers loading a cannon/gun.

I think a book in 3D would have made more sense.

And it's all under 45 minutes.",1328659200,7,390,4.256756756756757
4666333,3,B005ELVCVQ,"Though this short documentary does show some impressive 3D images, it repeats them over and over with some guy who sounds like he's more on a ghost hunt than narrating a documentary. If you've ever seen Half Baked, the scene where Jon Stewart keeps saying things like, ""Ya ever listen to music...on weeeeeeeed?"" Then you'll know what I mean when the narrator repeats over and over, ""never before has this been seen in threeeee deeeeeeeee"". The film really doesn't reveal or teach anything new about WWII. They even used up about 3 minutes of the film showing old ""Viewmaster"" clips in the attempt to drag this thing out to 45 minutes.",1328572800,13,634,4.7207207207207205
4666334,4,B005ELVCVQ,"I recently bought a 3D rig and have been buying Blu-Ray discs to showcase the technology.  I'm also the son of a WWII veteran of the 101st Airborne, 506th Parachute Infantry Division.  Growing up with a true GI hero, I have a built-in interest in the history of the era.  I pre-ordered ""WWII in 3D"" for its curiosity value not really knowing what to expect.  The description was rather incomplete at the time but it was under $20 so there were no high expectations. When the show started, I was totally surprised that Nazi Germany was again at the forefront of technology and it even extended to photography and motion pictures.  At the end of the show, I felt that the producers included only a subset of what they may have had access to which is only conjecture on my part. Some of the 3D images are reused during the storytelling.  There is only a short clip of full motion 3D film but it shows the advanced capabilities were used to influence their intended audience in 1939.  The still shots are truly historic.  We've all seen the images of the Nuremberg Parade Grounds with over a hundred thousand uniformed soldiers but never before have they been shown in 3D.  There are several excellent before-and-after fades combining current day with the wartime images.  I'd recommend this to anyone interested in WWII history or 3D photography.",1328054400,89,1343,4.700854700854701
4666335,5,B005ELVCVQ,"All I expected from this DVD was just a collection of historic 3D pictures and film footage. What I experienced was much, much more surprising and unexpected, as I was impacted both intellectually and emotionally. The ""3D"" elevated the material from mere historical footage to a virtual time travel experience, one could almost sense what it was like to be there. Seeing Hitler in 3D made me shudder, extreme evil comes disguised as the benign. Seeing the people in crowds cheering and responding to him in 3D was bone chilling. Could it happen again?  My only complaint is that it was too short. I understand the limited amount of 3D material available, however they might have included more pictures, recently released, of the Allied efforts in stereoscopic photo reconnaissance. I truly recommend viewing this DVD, especially with your children, a real horror film with relevancy today.",1328054400,3,889,5.089041095890411
4666336,1,B005ELVCVQ,"I bought this video and I am very unhappy with the content of it.
This is definitely not a film about WWII but only a simple documentary about the usage of photography and video in 3D during the war.
While it has good pictures, the historical content is poor and has just repetitive information seen  in many other documentaries.
I seriously do not recommend this to people interested in historical facts.",1327881600,67,405,4.704225352112676

After I upgraded my Blu-Ray Player (Corel WinDVD Pro) to version 11, I found that it automatically converted the active-shutter 3D to red-blue anaglyph format, so I could watch the film in 3D.

I played it on my 3D TV and was astonished by the impact of seeing in 3D those photos and movies I had already seen in 2D.  Contemporary historians had the same reaction.  I had no idea that 3D technology was so fully developed. There even were 3D ""books"" sold with stereo photos and a folding viewer in a case which looked like a book.  If you have a 3D TV and are a history buff, I recommend this for you.",1356652800,,520,4.17
4666488,2,B005ELVCVQ,Very bad 3d quality. It is not very educative eaither. There are some pictures of Hitler - mostly still pictures. It was difficult to sit through the entire DVD.,1356652800,4,161,4.586206896551724
4666489,1,B005ELVCVQ,I was expecting war scenes and not a documentary on Hitler :( Useless video if on goes as per title may be good for those who want to know more about Hitler and some aspects of Military personal behaviour  !!,1356480000,,208,4.2
4666490,4,B005ELVCVQ,"The content was interesting.  Although it's said to be 3D, the images that were said to be 3D did not appear to be 3D but just clear photographs.  Perhaps I'm just used to modern 3D depth and quality.  Still, the content itself was well done. I found the juxtaposition of photographs of a particular town center or city street first taken in WWII as compared with how that same street as it appears today to be the most interesting part of the film.",1356220800,,449,4.385542168674699

4666492,5,B005ELVCVQ,A MEMORABLE RARE PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE. WE SEE VERY RARE FOOTAGE THROUGH THIS FILM. STUDENTS AND CHILDREN SHOULD SEE THESE DOCUMENTARIES.AUDIO WAS BAD,1355184000,,152,5.12
4666493,3,B005ELVCVQ,"Very very few combat scenes. This is a documentary about 3D before, during and after WWII. The development of 3D and its uses.

This is NOT what I expected. I wish I would have read reviews before buying. However, I did find it extremely interesting. Had I known all this, I would NOT have paid $14-15 dollars for it.

I hope this helps someone.",1354579200,,345,4.375

4666495,3,B005ELVCVQ,"The blu ray was sweet. 3D origin and anything in 3D is cool especially WWII. $10 for a 3D blu ray is not bad, but only 40 mins long.

I'd give it 3/5 stars",1347235200,5,155,3.5588235294117645
4666496,1,B005ELVCVQ,"This is merely a documentary film about the German's technology in using 3D photography in the second World War for the military purpose. The DVD is not in 3D at all; Moreover, it is black and white with very coarse and grainy pictures. Only some commentary scenes are color and in blue ray. This DVD is poor and far below my expectation.",1337385600,2,338,4.467741935483871
4666497,5,B005ELVCVQ,"Although I wasn't born till 11/25/44.  Maybe because my Dad wasn't drafted, he had a civilian job with the Navy.  So I have an infinite abatete for WW II Movies and when I got my 3D TV I got 5 3D movies and WWII 3D is absolutely incredible.  The best movie I have ever seen, and I am a 67 yr., old Viet Nam Vet who had head crushed in, jaw broken and unhinghed, and smothered in Agent Orange, in everything I ate or drank, or breathed in or showed in and was covered in it from when I woke up and for 24 hours every day.  I know of one movie made since the end of the (Joke)War, called, ""Bombs Poisonous Cloud!"" Showing how it hasn't disapated from Viet Nam and a 3rd generation of children are being born deformed and with catastrophic diseases.  Will there be found a 3D movie of the horrendous and equally stupidity of the Viet Nam War as was World War II.  In the Viet Nam War we were to stop the spread of Communisum which is not inherently an evil form of government, The Communisum in Russia who's goal was to destroy the American Government and take over our Country, which Yes it was evil because of who was running it an what thie goal was.  Which is no different than in America, where we have a wonderful form of Government in Democracy.  The Constitution is one of the most well written documents ever written, but our forefather counldn't consider the possibillity of all the members of our government would become corrupt or serve only one term and get out.  How can on so many occations give many Millions of dollar's of tax payers money to other countries, when our government is so in debt there is no way to even pay the interest on the money our government has given away, and when asked by what authority do they have to give away our tax payers money, they will point out how many citizens voted for them, which is why at voting time they will send a car, bus, anything to get the most people to vote.  And when they get the votes of our people do they represent us?  As a representative form of government should do.  They do whatever they want, and arguable Americans are the best educated people on this planet, and also the Stupidest!!  Which was shown in the movie, and most of the experts tell us that if were considering a 3D HDTV we should wait till the end of the year when the development of 3D TV's has improved and the prices have come down.  Yet I can say that I can't even imagine 3D TV any better than the one I got I would call it perfect!!  Lloyd Vaughan  lv4@comcast.net............I buy most things from Amazon, I get tech sight that points out some of the most desireable products that are at a reasonable price.  Two weeks ago they did show a product that I have already purchaced, but I when to Amazon and got it for 1/2 the special price they said was really a bargain.  And I have been buying from Amazon for about 19 years, when I got a chance to teach a computer class at ""Centralia Community College.""  And then went on to get a BA from ""The Evergreen State College,"" Olympia, WA, something I never even dreamed of yet the last 2 years I taught there I was also the ""Half-Time Computer Lab Manager, responsible for entire Business Department Building and all it's contents and there working.  And I locked up at closing time every night and was responsible till they opened in the AM, and in those 2 years nothing ever came up missing, a very personally rewarding position which I loved every minuet of.  And one last time the WW II in 3D couldn't have been more perfect!!",1336435200,,3521,4.312594840667678
4666498,5,B005ELVCVQ,"Amazing 3d movie.  Cool looking photos in 3d.  To think those Germans thought of this stuff 70 years ago, and it took Hollywood and the TV makers to finally get decent 3D until 2010!",1335398400,,182,4.323529411764706
4666499,1,B005ELVCVQ,"3D very poor.  The main menu page with inverted 3D effect in the background (check in your TV switching left/rigth images), and the BW photos with a lot of ghosts.  Only correct 3D in the color new footage.  I'm surprised that a 3D producer can release such kind of bad work",1333152000,5,274,4.333333333333333

This is the first 3D movie I watched on my new 3D TV, and everything that followed was way better. I am a WWII buff and enjoyed the movie itself, but very little of the historical 3D movie and pictures came though with good results.",1330905600,,313,4.233333333333333

4666503,5,B005ELVCVQ,"If you are a WWII history buff, you need to get this video. I have watched it several times already and it is like being there.  I did not know Hitler used 3-D in his propaganda.  Highly recommended.",1330473600,,199,4.2105263157894735
4666504,2,B005ELVCVQ,"I was hoping for some rare footage of tanks and planes shot in 3D , i got a good look at how allied planes were going to get a surprise from Nazi observers , also looked at a really old french guy taking pictures in 3d during ww2 , BRAVO ! on a serious note i am a sucker for WWII stuff as my grandparents and Family members always talked about the WAR. i just wasn't expecting this. IF you're into how 3d was used by in WW2 it still doesnt have alot of information, overall i won't reccomend this to anyone. My grandad would have taken me out back and put me down if he saw this-god bless his soul",1330473600,,598,3.950413223140496
4666505,4,B005ELVCVQ,"This is a cool 3D documentary on the 3d use of WW2 but there should have been more ... I have seen other history channel stories on 3d photography that was not in this film.. Also it would have been nice to have a separate menu selection for just the 3D slides and they should have included as many as possible instead you have to use your pause button during the presentation ... perhaps someone will make a definitive WW2 3d slide collection from the British and German libraries , even viewsonic has slides of post war stuff... pretty slick. for the price its still a buy for any 3d fan since this is actual footage from the late 30's to then end of the war.... Just wished there was more slides.....",1330300800,,703,4.333333333333333
