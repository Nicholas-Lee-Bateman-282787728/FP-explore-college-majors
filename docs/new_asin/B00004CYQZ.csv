7920416,5,B00004CYQZ,"This will take you back to the harsh reality of Thatcherite Britain; if you want to go there. I well remember watching this series when I too was on the scrap heap, at a very young age. It is all too vivid & no, there is ne real dramatic licence here. Times were shocking. Well, the Play for Today which started it is light relief, the rest, well, some things you maybe do not want to remember. I still enjoyed it though. A small word here, we have a multi region Sony: without that, these disks will not play, as the vendor does warn.",1466208000,,535,4.153846153846154
7920417,5,B00004CYQZ,"The opening 2 hour 'Play for Today' TV film that lead to the 5 part mini-series isn't all that strong.
But the 5 remaining parts (ranging from 43 to 68 minutes) are often powerful stuff indeed. A
rueful, depressing and cutting look at unemployment and personal and economic depression
in the Thatcher years. The opening film isn't really needed, as one could pick up much of what
happened from the 5 part mini-series, but it does serve as a good basic set up for the characters
and their relationships, as a group of workers on the dole take an off-the- books job laying down
tarmac (the black stuff) at a new apartment complex. But in the original film the characters stay
frustratingly close to caricatures, and the story twists are largely unsurprising.

But in the 5 part mini-series, made 2 years later, that all changes. Each hour investigates one of
the character's lives in great depth and detail, The performances are very strong, and the stories
are almost all heartbreaking as we see what being unemployed and unwanted by society does to
these men; their families, their self-esteem, even their sanity. There are occasional darkly funny
moments, but this is grim, uncompromising stuff, with one episode in particular ""Yosser's story""
as harrowing and disturbing and honest a piece of film- making as I've seen in a long while. It's
interesting (if depressing) to see how much of what was going on in England in 1982, could just
as well be America in 2013.",1382745600,3,1466,4.794466403162056
7920418,5,B00004CYQZ,"Alan Bleasdale is one heck of writer and when he writes something as powerful as this, the stars are lining up for a slice of the action.  Yosser Hughes is Bleasdale's greatest creation and he chose one of England's finest actors (Bernard Hill) to play him.  I watched this after spending six months working on a concrete gang on the M25 in Kent and I was impressed by the authenticity of the characters and the stories.  I've worked with Yosser, Chrissie, George and all the others.  Great performances all round, but it's Yosser that steals the show.  It is perfectly natural to dislike Yosser intensely, but you cannot help yourself willing him to climb off the canvas before life counts him out.  He so desperately wants to be a grown-up of substance, but as George says, 'You never left the playground, son...it's all cowboys and indians to you.'  If you like tough, gritty, and superbly written and acted British drama then this is an absolute MUST for your collection.  This would certainly be in my Top Three TV dramas of all time - probably at no. 1.  If you just got the TV movie you would have had your money's worth, getting the whole series is unbelievably good value - if only Yosser himself had had such luck.",1325894400,3,1224,4.577981651376147
7920419,5,B00004CYQZ,"A British man familiar with my interest in British film and television recommended this series to me.  I don't know how I went so long not knowing of this series.  It is right up my alley, gritty, bleak.  It is particularly poignant to watch in the year 2011 during these tough economic times.  Great acting.  Thanks to my new English friend for the recommendation and thanks to the wonderful service and product from the vendor I got it through at Amazon.com.",1296432000,2,460,4.62962962962963
