8053986,1,B0007Y4SU2,"This dvd (all three in the series, actually) is advertised as being in NTSC format, but it's actually a PAL disc.  Just great if you own a region-free player, but Amazon is incorrectly advertising the product, so be careful when ordering.  As a practitioner of Uechi Ryu, I was really looking forward to watching this.  It took Amazon about a month to ship out, and after having waited so long, imagine my frustration at learning the discs won't play on my machine.",1137628800,6,465,4.646341463414634
