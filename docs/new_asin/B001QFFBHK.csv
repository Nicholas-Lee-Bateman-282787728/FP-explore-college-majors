3764659,3,B001QFFBHK,"If you want to see a gay film about a older guy and a younger guy, this isn't the film for you. It does contain nudity from the younger generation, but that is all. No sex is seen in the film, but it is talked about with the characters. WAIT UNTIL THIS FILM IS CHEAPER IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT.",1259625600,3,291,3.7868852459016393

3764661,4,B001QFFBHK,"Nice movie, it was somewhat what I imagine. About a jailbreaker guy with 2 friends and how he try to be part of the society but in the wrong way. The movie have nudity and gay scenes but artistic not weird",1259020800,,205,4.024390243902439
3764662,3,B001QFFBHK,"Interestingly, there are three story lines in this movie.  Each character representing a potential fleeting phase of growing up.
one is a free spirit, one is a don juan, one is confused soul looking to impress his first love. Two of the characters are straight one is gay; all test boundries, the law, and what they feel is passion.
Honestly many of the scenarios are a stretch of the imagination....the transition/link from one plot to the other is poorly demonstrated.",1242345600,11,470,4.875

All the actors should be very proud of their work. a lot of beautiful young men (** israel rodriguez **eye candy galore) making a very human story.  this is one of the best i have seen, on par with Gargon Stupide from france, and much better than most of the films from the US.  this is one you must have for your collection.",1242000000,8,360,4.264705882352941

3764678,5,B001QFFBHK,"Growing up on the streets (and, along the way, at a reform school for teenage males) of large urban centres in Spain, without parents' attentions, can lead young guys into a lot of trouble. That is just what happens to Xabi and his two friends in ""Clandestinos"" (the 2007 Spanish film of this title, not the 1987 Cuban film so titled) after they escape from their reform school and end up yet further on the wrong side of the law. Xabi (acted by Israel Rodrguez) is full of delusional ardour about just what being a militant activist, even amateur terrorist, means for himself and for other Basques. He is the only Basque of the three male teens and the lad of the youthful trio whose adventures the movie follows most closely. In his sweetly doglike devotion to Xabi, an Arab lad somewhat younger than Xabi, Driss (played by Mehroz Arif), falls in with Xabi's romanticised ideas and self-assumed role as a freelance terrorist for the Basque cause. The third guy, Joel (acted by Hugo Cataln), is from Mxico, and is basically apolitical, more interested in girls (a taste for which his good looks assure easy success) than in any political struggle. Xabi and Driss undergo a roller-coaster ride in roughly ""coming of age"" through the activist and amourous adventures that befall them.

Driss, cavorting along with Joel, also finds a girlfriend, one who is chubby, rather bossy, and suspicious, but Driss remains true to his devotion to Xabi, who is gay, but Xabi is unassertive of that with Driss, treating the Arab lad as a kid brother and apprentice-associate in the Basque nationalist cause; needless to say, Xabi is only one slight, awkward step at a time ahead of Driss in developing their ""radical-chic"" skills!

When a much older Spaniard, Germn (the role taken by Juan Luis Galiardo) picks up Xabi at a shopping mall, where the boy is earning his way to some extent as a young hustler, making himself available, for a price, to interested men, Xabi goes home with the older man and, after having sex and slept awhile in the man's bed, Xabi furtively rises, takes the man's money and a gun, then escapes with Germn, now awake, in pursuit. Back at the apartment where the friends live without paying rent, Xabi passes along to Driss some basic knowledge of weaponry and explosives and the two lads start off on an intended spree of lawlessness for the Basque cause.

It is possible that one reason that Xabi does not seek to have a sexual relationship with Driss, is that Xabi yearns romantically to reunite soon with Iaki (acted by Luis Hostalot) seeking to link back up with that older Basque terrorist for love and comradeship in the cause of Basque independence. Xabi does not realise that Iaki does not share the same level of gay male love for Xabi that Xabi himself has for Iaki (the older Basque, in any event, being bisexual) and that Iaki certainly does not approve of Xabi's uncontrolled ""do-it-yourself"" loner terrorism, which is causing embarrassment and difficulties for the Basque cause. His own uncritical zeal ends up putting Xabi into grave danger from Iaki.

To find out how Xabi is rescued from the dangers into which his bumbling nationalist militancy has led him, from Iaki and from the police, and how Germn, just barely in time, comes to Xabi's rescue, the Amazon customer should obtain this entertaining and delightful DVD (T.L.A. Releasing TLAD-211 being the edition viewed, in Spanish with English subtitles) to watch it for himself. There is an extra incitement for gay men who fancy beautiful young males, for Xabi is an exceedingly attractive young dude, slender and lithely (but not heavily) muscled; the other two renegades from the reform school also are ""easy on the eyes"" to only somewhat lesser degree (but that depends, for sure, on other viewers' taste, which might rank differently these lads' respective degrees of allure). Xabi has several opportunities to appear full-frontally naked (genitals in plain sight) and Israel Rodrguez acting the part looks fine in any state of dress or of undress!

The acting of one and all is superbly professional (and, in the case of the younger members of the cast, remarkably assured for teenagers), engaging attention with never any flagging of interest. It is easy to understand how this movie became such a favourite with audiences in Spain.",1402617600,6,4326,4.856368563685637
3764679,3,B001QFFBHK,This movie was interesting but was not what I was expecting.  I love indie films but I'm not so sure about this one.,1391990400,,116,4.043478260869565

3764683,4,B001QFFBHK,"I enjoyed this film of three young man on the lam from jail. Unique characters, settings, and motivations. It was hard to watch them make learn terrorist tactics (making a kettle bomb) in light of what we know after the Boston bombings, and that took me out of the story for a bit. But for the time, setting, and theme I would recommend it.",1369785600,,340,4.328125
3764684,3,B001QFFBHK,"the movie was not what I expected. It was rather boring and not interesting.
I will not consider it as a good movie",1365724800,,115,4.043478260869565
3764685,2,B001QFFBHK,Don't expect all that great acting or even suggested sex.  It's not bad but the equipment to produce much higher quality has drastically changed the bench mark for what it takes to make even a mediocre low budget film.  I would look for something of higher quality.  High school film department students are producing stacks of productions that exceed this endeavor.,1362787200,,366,4.967213114754099
3764686,5,B001QFFBHK,"I went into this move with few expectations.  I picked up the DVD, on a whim, at the library so as to practice my Spanish language skills.  When the movie trailers began to play, I had a moment of thinking, ""What is this movie about again?""  To my surprise, this movie falls into the genre of gay cinema.  I know next to nothing about gay cinema but quickly found myself intrigued by the trailers, particularly those for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bangkok-Love-Story/dp/B001A94CSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bangkok Love Story</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schoolboy-Crush/dp/B001M4YZ7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schoolboy Crush</a>.  I thanked the Universe for the unexpected awareness, laughed at my ignorance, and hit play.

Set in Spain, the movie opens on a scene with young men playing football (soccer) at a detention center for juveniles.  One of the ball players, Joel, looks up at a window to find another young man, Xabi, returning his gaze.  Conspiratorially, they nod at each other as another young man, Driss, observes.  Together, they escape their prison and set off to Madrid.  In Madrid, Joel pursues his interest in women and sex while Driss, drawn to Xabi's leadership, decides to loyally accompany Xabi in whatever he may need.  This ends up including terrorism in the name of Basque freedom.

The story revolves around and splinters off of Xabi's journey.  His political interests are intrinsically linked with his infatuation for Iaki, an estranged ex-lover and ETA terrorist.  But ulitimately, this story is not about homosexuality or Spanish politics.  It's a coming of age story, revealing the simplicity of young emotions: when at a loss, we gravitate towards kindness. (That's true for some adults, I guess, too!)

I think this movie is elegant and as deep as you would like it to be.  There is social commentary but in a factual - this is just life - sort of way.  This movie isn't hitting the audience over the head with themes but they are there, if you are open to them.

Having said this, though, I can understand the other reviewers' comments regarding pace and realism.  But how real are most movies?!  I didn't find this movie to be fantastical or confusing.  Really, I think I lucked out with my ignorance.  My lack of expectations allowed me to really enjoy this movie.  I highly recommend!  Enjoy!

Oh! And yes, Israel Rodriguez's body is very impressive.  Wow!",1360800000,13,2506,5.424870466321243

3764688,5,B001QFFBHK,"Thriller? Drama? No way! This is a quirky, totally unbelievable but totally charming little romantic comedy about an extremely dumb, naive but earnest gay kid who wants to impress his middle-aged terrorist ex-lover by blowing up a flagpole in Madrid, but he gets just about everything wrong.

If you watch this expecting a thriller, you'll be badly disappointed. If you take it seriously AT ALL, you'll be badly disappointed, especially at the end. But if you let Israel Rodriguez's devastatingly sexy and sweet and clueless Xavi get under your skin and work his magic on your imagination you'll have as good a time watching this delightful little movie as I did.

I had seen Rodriguez before only in a short called Doors Cut Down, when he was about 17; it was okay, but not great. Man, has he aged well! The long hair is incendiary, and he's turned from a cute kid into one of the sexiest men on earth. On top of that, he's smart and he's a great actor. Where are the American actors like him?

8335510,4,B001QFFBHK,"It wasn't the movie I expected at all. It's a nice story of a gay teenager who escapes a juvenile facility to get back with his lover, a notorious Basque terrorist. His two acolytes, a Mexican and a Moroccan, hook up with two charming locals they meet while on the run.

Not your typical story of a gay teen who discovers the clubs and scene, the story is more focused on everything else and the main character just happens to be gay; his sexual orientation is more in the background unlike other gay-themed movies whose narrative often revolves around the characters' sex identity.

I'd recommend this film although it feels a tad cheap at times, and parts of the ending are bit too much, not a perfect story, not perfectly done, but well worth a watch.",1433203200,3,754,4.536764705882353
