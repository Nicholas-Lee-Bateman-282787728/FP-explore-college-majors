8505929,5,B006WY0V1Q,Survival is harsh. Food is a necessity and hunting animals is part of living in the wild. If animal activists think living off berries and wild vegetation is all you are supposed to do when in extreme places then they are wrong to even watch these kind of programs. I would like to see an animal activist give survival an ultimate challenge without protein.,1426464000,3,357,4.59375
8505930,2,B006WY0V1Q,My husband loves this multimillionaire and I wouldn't blame him as this guy volunteers to endanger his life! He also gives some tips for living in the wild if we all got ourselves stranded...life may change dramatically over the next few years so I won't sniff at the idea. What I can't stand is the animal killing and bug eating for the program. Animal rights activists are bound to complain. Even I (a meat eater) have gotten quite queasy at some of the stunts...not for me.,1368835200,3,476,4.546511627906977
