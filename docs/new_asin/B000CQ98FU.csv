2468894,3,B000CQ98FU,"This entire movie is animated, unlike the first two Stuart Little movies. I was willing to accept that since it is a third movie that went straight to video. All the big name voices are in it ....all the people from the last movies. The animation is that low budget computer generated stuff you see in the Barbie movies. The story is okay but no comparison to the first two. I will say this about it though....my 4yr old loves it. I did get it for her so all in all it is a fine movie...just not the quality you would expect having seen the first two.",1141516800,24,551,4.158878504672897

2468932,5,B000CQ98FU,"Very cute animated movie! 2 thumbs up on story line, and not making the ""beast"" too scary.

2468934,2,B000CQ98FU,"I bought this thinking it would be like the other Stuart Little movies... it's all animated, and not that well.  I would pass on this one unless you have a die-hard Stuart Little fan in your family.",1374796800,,198,4.351351351351352
2468935,1,B000CQ98FU,Not as expected. It is an animated cartoon. Not a movie ad it said in the advertisement for it. The description needs to be changed.,1364688000,,132,4.32

2468942,5,B000CQ98FU,This third edition to the stuart little movies is great but it's not as good as the first 2. I thought it was cool that they kept Michael J. Fox as the voice of stuart little. And Wyane Brady appears in this movie too. this is a great film.,1283990400,,240,3.9183673469387754

2468945,4,B000CQ98FU,"In these days of gloom and doom, even senior citizens would get a kick out of watching Stuart Little 3. It's a heartwarming story that is good if you need a ""feel good"" moment. It's hard to believe that the acerbic doctor on the TV show House stars and the sweet father on this DVD. Great for the whole family to watch together, especially if you have grandchildren.",1274486400,,366,4.397058823529412
2468946,1,B000CQ98FU,"I don't really mind the cheap animation. It's more the cliched, near offensive parts. If you want your kids to watch movies with the phrase ""junk in the trunk"" in it then watch this. For my kids, I'll skip it. It's not as crude as more modern ""kids"" movies but there is still plenty for me not to like.

Yes, I am happily prudish with what I want my kids watching.",1267228800,4,364,4.126760563380282

Nope, didn't like it one bit.",1255651200,2,121,4.260869565217392
2468949,2,B000CQ98FU,"nothing near the quality of the first two stuart little movies and not enough to keep the little one's attention long enough to enjoy it...

the storyline is good, but it failed to hit the pre-schoolers level of excitement like the first two movies did.  they were bored within minutes of the movie starting..",1246665600,,309,4.703703703703703
2468950,4,B000CQ98FU,"My Grandson, Nathan, age 31/2 loved this movie.  He has the first two movies and asked for the 3rd one. On the first day he had the movie he watched 4 times until bedtime.  He also packed it with his portable DVD player when he went on a plane from Phoenix to Boston, and watched each night before bedtime.  The characters same voices as the first movies, but in total cartoon form, and he liked the cartoon version even better.  Thanks for making a mom traveling with a 3 1/2 year old  a little easier on the long flight. Made Grandma (me)look like a hero.  Thanks!!!  :)",1220832000,,572,4.289719626168225

2468952,2,B000CQ98FU,"My DVD automatically displays English subtitles as the default setting. This happens every time we play it. I got it for my niece who's 4, and she always has to ask someone to reset it to display no subtitles. ( She otherwise can just hit the play button to start a DVD.) I was NOT happy with that. This info should have been stated on this website. I would never have bought it if I knew this. Poorly made cartoon, although my niece still watches it because she likes Stuart.",1145664000,5,476,4.3
2468953,2,B000CQ98FU,"The only good news about the second sequel to `Stuart Little' is that you can hear the voices of three principal actors of the original -- Michael J. Fox, Geena Davies, and Hugh Laurie. Except that, I can find nothing that would justify the decision of making another entry into the series. There is no state-of-the-art images merging seamlessly the live-action and CGI-created creatures. So what's the point of making this one?

The film is all shot in animation, and the animation is just cheesy. I know I should not expect Pixar in direct-to-video films, but it is not a totally happy thing to see the characters with clunky designs, whose monotonous movement looks so awkward that you might remember the unnaturally moving heads or arms of the characters on video games made five or six years ago, or the filmed version of `Final Fantasy.' Frankly this animation needs better software.

At least, the filmmakers are wise not to change the basic points of the `SL' world. Again we are to meet the Little Family, this time going on vacation for summer. Stuart joins in the `Lake Scout' with his brother George, which results in another misadventure on the lake as you know he would.

The story gets more interesting when a new character Reeko wisecracking skunk appears in the forest where, it is rumored, mighty and fearful `Beast' rules mercilessly. Somehow this skunk likes Stewart Little, and Stewart the skunk, and their friendship is tested when Snowbell gets into a big trouble.

Virginia Madsen and Peter MacNicol also provide voices, but that doesn't add much to the entire film.

Regular characters like Mr. and Mrs. Little, or Monty come back, but the film spends pretty much time to introduce and follow the story of the skunk, who is not particularly a funny character. There is an unnecessary `funky' musical sequence about Rikko `skunk with a funk' which completely misunderstands the target audiences of the film.

Though kids might enjoy it, `SL3' is a huge disappointment after watching two previous works, especially the rousing finale of `SL2.' The reason why they shot this film fully in unremarkable animation still mystifies me.",1143331200,12,2153,4.950138504155125
2468954,3,B000CQ98FU,"While I'm sure the kids will enjoy this third entry in the STUART LITTLE franchise, from an adult's point of view, it's not as good as the first two.  Blame it on the computer generated uninspired animation; blame it on the really bad songs (how many parents will have to explain what a derriere is?); or maybe it's got too much skunk in it.  While the voice talents of Michael J. Fox, Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie return, Wayne Brady is a little too annoying and ""gangsta"" to be much fun.  Why do they always have to put in an actor who has to speak hip and jive when it really has nothing to do with the character?  Oh, well...I'm sure our youth of today will identify with his funk/rap song, but I'm just a little tired of it.  Anyway, we do get Virginia Madsen as the voice of the Beast and Stuart manages to be a hero...so if I'm being too picky, sorry!  But it's okay for the family.",1141689600,14,888,4.194117647058824
