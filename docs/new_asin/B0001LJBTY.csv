Kouji has his worst day yet as the Ryvius experiences total chaos when a broken, guilt-stricken Juli steps down from the captain's chair.  In addition to hiding Blue and tossing him non-perishable food items when he can, Kouji also has to deal with a breakup with a now obviously fanatical Faina and - most difficult of all - the complete meltdown of his best friend Ikumi, who takes over the Vital Guarder and threatens to go medieval on the whole Ryvius if everyone doesn't behave themselves after he finds out what happened to his girlfriend Kozue.  One bit of good news, though.  Yuki finally stops beating Kouji up on sight.  Ah, brotherly love...

As the volume comes to a close, we finally find out why the interplanetary government wants the Ryvius destroyed - and that the policy of wiping out the kids if necessary is not universally accepted.  A large part of the finale is shaping up to be the question of whether attempted killers or rescuers will reach the kids first.

It's also shaping up to be Kouji's moment of truth.  Blue, ironically now one of the sanest people on board, makes Kouji take his gun when Kouji tells him what's going on as the situation escalates as Ikumi's reign as captain begins.  ""What would you do if you were in my position?"" Kouji later asks the former dictator who for all his considerable faults may actually have been the Ryvius' best captain.  ""I'd use what you have stashed away in your pocket"" Blue answers bluntly.  ""Right away.""",1121990400,,1543,4.695167286245353
