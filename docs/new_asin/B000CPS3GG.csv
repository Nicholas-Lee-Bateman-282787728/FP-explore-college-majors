8100171,1,B000CPS3GG,"The production is very poor, the music (in the first section) too loud. The second section is a repeat of the first. It also contains a break where Sam's young daughter takes over the narrative, babbling in her two-year way. Sam has abandoned the camera, which is allowed to run unattended, to answer someone's off-screen questions. If you wish to learn Shogi, seek out Hidetchi's videos on YouTube---they are wonderfully instructive.",1271462400,,434,5.126760563380282
8100172,5,B000CPS3GG,"Let's face it. This DVD isn't going to win any Oscars. At times it feels a little too homemade, and the background music tends to be louder than the speaker's voice.

On the other hand, this is a very good introduction to Shogi (Japanese Chess). Basic moves are taught. Basic strategies are revealed. I found this video full of good advice for beginners.

Overall, the video is similar to having one-on-one instruction on this ancient game. I have to recommend this video. I expect I will watch portions of it many times.",1268352000,,521,4.6521739130434785
