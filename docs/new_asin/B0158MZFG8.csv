7430357,5,B0158MZFG8,"The original paintings were created in heart-wrenching and stomach-turning times. This forger must be seen within the framework of the near pathetic frenzy about art from this period, especially paintings, which also brought the era of modern or contemporary art, greedy art dealers, salivating art aficionados and many people who saw in these paintings personal tragedies. This is probably the best account ever of the works and the mindset of an accomplished fraudster. One can look upon this only with awe.",1451088000,6,509,5.296296296296297
7430358,3,B0158MZFG8,"Not a bit of embarrassment, shame, or apology from him and his wife for being liars and thieves.  (she as an accomplice) There is so much I could say here, but I won't waste my time on such a soul-less wretch.  I felt sorry for the children, the rest turned my stomach.  His only original painting was highly symbolic for me - the fallen angel.  And all the faces of those he duped.",1451001600,,382,4.191780821917808
7430359,3,B0158MZFG8,"Visually interesting,but light on details. This documentary is really just a compilation of clips of interviews and conversations. A coherent timeline and story does not really happen here. I don't feel like I walked away really understanding Beltracchi comprehensively, only vaguely. And if you don't want to spend one and a half hours plus reading subtitles, you need to move on.",1466294400,,381,5.262295081967213
7430360,5,B0158MZFG8,I thought this documentary was well done.  I also appreciated the interviews in the special features.  Hearing from the people who caught Beltracchi and also learning the goals of the filmmaker helped me appreciate the work of all the people involved.,1465344000,,251,5.097560975609756
7430361,5,B0158MZFG8,"Absolutely riveting.
If you are an art lover, you will truly enjoy this.
I also enjoy crime and mystery and there is that element in this documentary too.
Beltracchi: I wonder what his work would be if he had concentrated on developing his own voice rather than going for the $. . . He is a very gifted individual who mastered a difficult craft, and made lots of money creatively- imagining what work might be missing from art masters, then producing it.
I also recommend it to anyone interested in ethics, lots of food for thought here.",1464566400,,537,4.546391752577319
7430362,1,B0158MZFG8,"Certainly enough moral guilt (if that's possible when it comes to money) to go around from buyers, evaluators, auction houses, dealers and last, but not least, the forgers. Why one star. Well, the producers of this doc, for the most part, allow a portrayal of innocent, yet planned, mere misdeed from the forager. In an affront to the loss of artistry & name of the original artists we are given a portrayal of an amiable neighbor-next-door thief. Thief because perhaps a hundred and more forgeries netted tens of millions; the vast majority hidden (most likely) in off shore banks. Penalty? A couple of years of house arrest and one partial repayment.",1464220800,,652,4.882882882882883
7430363,1,B0158MZFG8,"This documentary is totally lacking in suspense, and it isn't all that interesting either. In far too many scenes, the viewer is left to wonder about what's on screen. Is it an authentic painting or a forgery? Where is it going to, or where is it coming from? (It's obviously in motion.)

The tremendous skills Beltracchi employed in his chosen profession as a forger could have been revealed in detail. But one is simply left to wonder about them. Drawings are briefly shown, apparently done by the artist, that reveal his great expertise as a draftsman. And not a word is spoken about them. The methods he used to prepare his stretchers, canvases, and paints apparently held almost no interest for the filmmaker. The deceptive means by which the paintings were passed off to gullible dealers are hardly mentioned at all.

This could have been a brilliant film, and it is merely mediocre.",1463184000,,889,4.803921568627451
7430364,5,B0158MZFG8,Fascinating and unbelievable true story. Every art appreciator and dealer should know how even the best of experts can be fooled.,1461196800,,129,5.190476190476191
7430365,5,B0158MZFG8,"Really outstanding true documentary about this art forger I had never heard about until I watched this video.  Some parts are slow, but the art stuff makes up for it. It is in German with English subtitles.",1459296000,2,206,4.5675675675675675
7430366,5,B0158MZFG8,"Fascinating, fun documentary portrait of an art forger so good he fooled the experts for many years.  So careful, painstaking, and exacting in his work the question can fairly be asked  was what Beltracchi created art of its own, or just an empty rip-off?  What makes art art?  (One interviewee actually provides a pretty good and thought provoking answer).

Probably the best parts of the film are the detailed looks at exactly how the pieces were created  from research on which artists to pick, and then what pieces by that artist had disappeared with little trace, to the brilliant ways Beltracchi found to mimic specific artistic styles, to carefully aging the pieces so theyd even smell just right, to setting up false histories and back-stories of the pieces and their various owners.

But just as interesting is the man himself, charismatic, insufferably arrogant, tremendously talented, a little contrite, and at a loss for an identity.  Also absorbing is his apparently deep and loving marriage of many years, and his wife Helene who happily went along with and aided in the deceptions for years.  Theres also fun to be had from the various reactions of the others interviewed; art dealers, police, members of auction houses, art critics, whose reactions range from bemusement, and almost a sense of grudging admiration, to apoplectic anger that comes off as almost comic.

I enjoyed every minute of this.  If its not going to change the world. it will certainly take you on a most agreeable ride to the dark side of the art world.",1457049600,4,1541,4.911196911196911
7430367,5,B0158MZFG8,"Outstanding ""docu-drama "". Very interesting and enjoyable (true) tale of a very affable and likeable fellow (and an incredibly gifted artistic talent), his similarly endearing wife, and their long-running and successful careers as multi-million-dollar art forgers. The tale itself is worth the price of admission (and more), but the views provided of some of Beltracchi's artistic techniques, his various ""painting"" styles and methods, and his overall creative approach and perspective are both unique and enlightening .... and leaves you hungry for more.",1455667200,3,555,5.780487804878049

8732994,5,B0158MZFG8,"The kids, who majored in German in college loved this. They are fascinated by art forgery, and those who do it. They loved this guy from a talent perspective. Would love to one day buy something from him for them but we shall see. I was beyond thrilled to find this on dvd to add to their Christmas gifts and it was a hit. If you love art, and you love interesting people; you really should see this dvd. At one time was on Prime for free, it is not now, so buy the dvd.",1516665600,,470,3.957894736842105
8732995,5,B0158MZFG8,Extremely interesting and amazing that he could create forgeries very easily.,1505088000,,77,6.090909090909091

8732998,5,B0158MZFG8,"This doc goes through how the guy forges his art-- from adding dirt to grinding his own paints to smelling the painting. Such a crazy story. I'm glad it's real and it's documented.

Also the English subtitles were mandatory for me since I can't understand German or whatever.",1492560000,,275,4.729166666666667

8733000,5,B0158MZFG8,"Not sure what some people expected about this movie but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is no acting here, it's like a documentary. I think it's great what Beltracchi did to the art world. It just shows how greedy some people are and how overrated art is in general. If you enjoy good art work, watch this. It's very interesting.",1467331200,,328,4.483333333333333
