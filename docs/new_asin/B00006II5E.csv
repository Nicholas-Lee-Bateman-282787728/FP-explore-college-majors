1776786,1,B00006II5E,There is nothing good I can tell you about this DVD so I'II skip the review and tell you whats wrong with it. The DVD has no menus or sound on most of the episodes and the video quality is horrible. The Phantom Creeps released by Reel Classis Films is not a pressed DVD as you would expect from a distributer but a copy and when I played the DVD I could hear the player having a hard time trying to play it. So if your thinking of purchasing this DVD or any other movie from REEL CLASSIC FILMS dont. I threw mine in the recycle bin.,1214784000,,532,3.9813084112149535
1776787,5,B00006II5E,"VCI Entertainment and Universal Pictures presents ""THE PHANTOM CREEPS"" (1939) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Serials, more specifically known as Movie serials or Film serials, were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film --- Known as ""chapter plays,"" they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called ""chapters"" or ""episodes."" --- Each chapter (a typical serial usually had as many as 15 of them) would be screened at the same theater for one week --- The serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape --- The audience would have to return the next week (and pay admission) to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again --- Serials were especially popular with children, and for many youths in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.

The Movie studios of Universal, Columbia and Republic, with Republic quickly becoming the acknowledged leader in quality serial product --- Each company turned out four to five serials per year, of 12 to 15 episodes each, a pace which they all kept up until the end of World War II when, in 1946, Universal dropped its serial unit along with its B-picture unit and renamed its production department Universal-International Pictures -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Smith) keep the fine Zorka from releasing his eight foot giant robot friend upon the entire cast and crew of Universal Pictures --- is there such a thing as inivisiblity, suspended animation and weapons of mass-destruction, well only Lugosi can answer all these questions --- will our hero Captain Bob West (Robert Kent) and girl report Jean Drew (Dorothy Arnold) be able to cope will all the ins and outs of Lugosi's villianous plans --- why is Zorka planning to carry onboard deadley explosives then chart his travel log over the ocean --- doesn't sound good to me, an you're correct there's trouble afoot --- don't leave the theater until the final chapter is over and done with ""To Destroy the World"" --- don't miss a single spine thrilling episode..return next week to this local theater for another episode of action and adventure that will keep you thrilled until the next chapter.

Special footnote, to many collectors this serial reunites Bela Lugosi and Edwin Stanley from their first meeting in the film ""Dracula"" (1931), all serial-buffs should find ""The Phantom Creeps"" very rewarding and entertaining --- Lugosi gained fame when he played ""Count Dracula"" in the legendary 1927 Broadway stage adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, continued for three years, and was subsequently, and memorably, filmed by Tod Browning in 1931, establishing Lugosi as one of the screen's greatest personifications of pure evil --- meanwhile back to our Universal Serial which is always good till the last drop and this serial is no exception...there is a great deal of entertainment here for the cliffhanger fans out there --- all courtesy of VCI Entertainment, who in my humble opinion is the best there is in restoring early serials and features.

1776788,4,B00006II5E,"If you try to take this serial seriously, you won't like it much.  But if you'll relax and let it take you back to the Great Depression days, it's a gem.  There's Bela Lugosi in the starring role as Dr. Zorka, ""mad scientist,"" with a load of crazy inventions in his bubbling and vaporous laboratory:  there are exploding spiders, a weird robot with pointed teeth, a belt gizmo that doesn't quite make Dr. Zorka invisible but turns him into a puffy cloud.  And there's sexy Dorothy Arnold as the ""girl reporter,"" a drop-dead gorgeous blond who married and divorced Joltin' Joe DiMaggio near the time this serial was filmed.

The plot is more than a bit silly, but that was the case in those old serials.  They had to put a cliffhanger in every episode, in an attempt to keep moviegoers coming back.  There's also a fistfight in every chapter, plus wrecked cars, a railroad collision, and other thrilling sillies.  The acting is no better.  It's all downright camp--like the Batman TV series.  But one has to like those old square-back cars, the roadsters, even antique fire engines, biplanes, and the Hindenburg wreck.

So relax and view this for what it is--an entertainment from a seemingly simpler time, when people were trying to forget about the Depression and Hitler and Mussolini and the Dust Bowl and Father Coughlin.  This is just great fun.  Reality wasn't.",1187568000,,1366,4.761702127659574
1776789,1,B00006II5E,i bought this becouse it was sopposed to be a serial. they spliced it together as a movie. i like the cliff hangers. none to be seen. also the color was green not black and white and the sound was terrible.,1171929600,,206,4.048780487804878
1776790,3,B00006II5E,"""The Phantom Creeps"" is a serial made in 1939 starring Bela Lugosi. Lugosi really stretches himself as an actor, this time playing Dr. Zorka, a mad scientist. (For a genuinely new twist, he does actually grow a beard for the role.) This is one of the better serials from the era, but is tediously long, though Bela really does his best to keep the suspensefulness in play.

The series is more interesting than some other serials due not only to Lugosi, but also to the bizarre mechanical contraptions he invents. My personal are the mechanical exploding spiders that he can control with a piece of the ""secret element"" he has discovered. This same element makes possible an invisibility belt which Bela aggressively uses along with his ""Z-ray"" gun to pursue his nefarious plans. He also invents a giant robot to do his bidding, though it doesn't seem all that menacing to me in that it moves as deftly as a sloth. (Why do people in these kind of films never try running away from the slow, menacing thing?)

Zorka's schemes put him in a variety of exciting scenarios, each designed to get the original theater viewers to come back for the next episode. There are shootouts, car chases, and in the end an airborne conflict between biplanes. Zorka gets progressively more insane throughout the film, and Lugosi really shines in that aspect of the role. In the finale, Zorka steals a biplane (remember that the military still used biplanes as first line fighters when this was made) and starts tossing bombs out of it destroying varied targets (a barn, a battleship, etc.) with great abandon, before finally being engaged by the biplanes of the Army. Without doubt, my favorite moment in the serial is when a shot of the Hindenburg is shown placidly cruising along, followed by Bela maniacally tossing a bomb overboard. Although predictable, what follows is the single gutsiest use of stock footage in history, when we see the now famous footage of the Hindenburg exploding at Lakehurst, New Jersey in May, 1937 (only two years before this was made.) I absolutely could not believe the director was brave enough to even think about trying that.

The serial features all the elements meant to keep the viewer coming back: romance (for the ladies,) action (for the men,) and suspense (for everybody.) As such this is successful, and I recommend it enthusiastically to all fans of serials, fans of Lugosi, or anyone interested in filmmaking conventions from the era.",1171756800,,2460,4.852380952380952

Smith) keep the fine Zorka from releasing his eight foot giant robot friend upon the entire cast and crew of Universal Pictures...is there such a thing as inivisiblity, suspended animation and weapons of mass-destruction, well only Lugosi can answer all these questions...will our hero Captain Bob West (Robert Kent) and girl report Jean Drew (Dorothy Arnold) be able to cope will all the ins and outs of Lugosi's villianous plans...why is Zorka planning to carry onboard deadley explosives then chart his travel log over the ocean....doesn't sound good to me, an you're correct there's trouble afoot.....don't leave the theater until the final chapter is over and done with ""To Destroy the World""....just remember double thrills, chills, mystery and suspense...hitting the bull's eye with excitement...don't miss a single spine thrilling episode..return next week to this local theater for another episode of action and adventure that will keep you thrilled until the next chapter.

Under director's Ford Beebe and Saul A. Goodkind, associate producer Henry MacRae, supervised by J. Laurence Wickland, screenplay by George Pympton, Basil Dickey and Mildred Barish, original story by Willis Cooper, dialogue director Lyonel Margolies, musical score by Charles Previn, Franz Waxman, Frank Skinner, stunts by David Sharpe, Tom Steele and Bud Wolfe...the cast includes Bela Lugosi (Dr. Alex Zorka), Robert Kent (Capt. Bob West), Dorothy Arnold (Jean Drew), Edwin Stanley (Dr. Fred Mallory), Regis Toomey (Lt. Jim Daley), Jack C. Smith (Monk), Edward Van Sloan (Jarvis-spy chief), Dora Clement (Ann Zorka), Anthony Averill (Rankin/henchman), Hugh Huntley (Perkins/Mallory's lab assistant), Eddie Acuff (Mac/AMI agent), Roy Barcroft (Parker/AMI agent), Al Bridge (White Rose sailor), Lane Chandler (Henchman with Rankin), Edmund Cobb (Army sergeant), Lee J. Cobb (Road crew foreman), Karl Hackett (Brown/henchman-secretary), Charles King (Policeman), Monte Montague (Signal tower operator), David Sharpe (Schooner sailor), Tom Steele (Train conductor), Forrest Taylor (Black/henchman), George Magrill (Thug-Pilot)..........special footnote, to many collectors this serial reunites Bela Lugosi and Edwin Stanley from their first meeting in the film ""Dracula"" (1931), all serial-buffs should find ""The Phantom Creeps"" very rewarding and entertaining, Lugosi gained fame when he played ""Count Dracula"" in the legendary 1927 Broadway stage adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, continued for three years, and was subsequently, and memorably, filmed by Tod Browning in 1931, establishing Lugosi as one of the screen's greatest personifications of pure evil.........meanwhile back to our Universal Serial which is always good till the last drop and this serial is no exception...there is a great deal of entertainment here for the cliffhanger fans out there...all courtesy of VCI Entertainment, who in my humble opinion is the best there is in restoring early serials and features.

1776795,1,B00006II5E,"What a load of old cobblers. No, I'm not complaining about the storyline and quality of The Phantom Creeps (after all, what do you expect for under $7?) What I'm irate about, and what every DVD purchaser around the world should also be concerned, is the way the distributor - Vintage Home Entertainment - has superimposed its logo watermark in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. Not just once to establish the copyright ownership, but ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SERIAL. I don't want my attention distracted with a logo emblazoned across the picture... and if I had known I wouldn't have spent my money on it. I hope this is not a sign of things to come with DVD releases - 'cause if it is, I ain't gonna buy anymore. The quality of the print, by the way, is woeful. Shocking quality and constant jumps where the film has been joined after breaking. I'll never buy another DVD from this mob again... this is possibly the worse DVD I've ever purchased... and I'm a big Bela Lugosi fan!!!

When I first starting watching this disk, I cringed during Chapter 1 as the quality was quite poor with lots of scrathes and some splicing.  I thought, ""Here we go again with a substandard Alpha release!""  Then, to my surprise, chapters 2-5 were quite good.  Still nothing like you would get from the Roan Group, but on par with Sinister Cinema or Retro Media.  Chapter 6 falls in closer to the poor quality of chapter 1, however.
If you are a Lugosi fan and want a low cost version of this series, then take a chance on the Alpha release.  If you are a Lugosi fan who wants to collect the best possible prints of his films, then skip this Alpha release.

But It turns out that this tape is a compilation of the best moments throughout the serial. This procedure of turning 200 and something minutes into 80 minutes a fun and wacky ride. There are so many jambled up plot lines, people running into scenes then back out in a  cut, and then peopleliving through speeding plane wrecks and car explosions (With no explination).

1776803,2,B00006II5E,"The Phantom Creeps, Bela Lugosi's final movie serial, holds a special place in my memories for being the first complete chapterplay I had seen. I had seen portions of others but never a complete one before this. Lugosi steals the serial as Doctor Alex Zorka, a brilliant scientist who has made a series of inventions from a meteorite he found in Africa--via footage from ""The Invisible Ray"" for the Africa sequence. He wants to sell his secrets to the highest bidder, but the US Government wants to stop him. What is unusual for this serial is that I feel that Zorka was initially the good guy of the story before the US and a spyring start looking for his secrets and thus hounding him into insanity. The DVD for this is painful. The print used retains the Commonwealth (TV?) logo instead of the normal Filmcraft or Universal logo. Sound is muddy at quite a few places. Picture will be dark in a few places--sometimes in a daytime scene. They use only one set of opening credits for the 12 chapters. Normally, Universal would use a opening which showed the main cast for its first 3 episodes while the remaining episodes would use an opening that merely lists who the actors were. It is this second opening that is on the DVD and is only used once for all 12 chapters. There are no extras on this disc, such as a trailer, although you can choose to play it all at once or select an individual chapter. There is an insert with information on Lugosi. There are better VHS copies out there and in my own collection at one time I had an actual film print which had the Universal logo. I can't really recommend this DVD unless you don't have a copy of this serial at all. I wouldn't buy another disc from Whirlwind Media, the releasers of the disc, unless it was an extremely rare serial that probably would not be released any other way. Now if only Universal would get off its duff and start releasing their own serials instead of letting people with Public Domain prints do it, I might be a little bit more happy.",980467200,,2012,4.455284552845528

7969273,4,B00006II5E,"""The Phantom Creeps"" is a 12-chapter Universal serial from 1939, directed by Ford Beebe and Saul A. Goodkind, with Bela Lugosi in his last serial role.

Dr. Alex Zorka (Lugosi) has found a rare element in a higher-budget feature film, capable of many strange and unrelated effects.  It can induce suspended animation, allow painless surgery and can be used as a powerful weapon.  But Zorka refuses to work with the Government, so former associate Dr. Mallory (Edwin Stanley) is forced to report his activities to the authorities, who send a Military Intelligence Officer, Captain Bob West (Robert Kent) and his partner Jim Daly (Regis Toomey) to investigate.  They have a difficult task; Zorka can make himself invisible, and has a secret laboratory of which not even his wife (Dora Clement) is aware.  He also has built a giant robot (Ed Wolff), remotely controlled, believing that with an army of these he could become Master of the Universe.

If the plot lacks originality, it is an enjoyable combination of familiar parts, including recycled cliffhangers.  Zorka's adversaries include a foreign spy ring headed by Jarvis (Edward Van Sloan) that steals Zorka's meteorite fragment, and ""Who's got the meteorite"" becomes the main plot.  Newspaper reporter Jean Drew (Dorothy Arnold) helps enliven the forces of law and order, and Robert Kent needs help in that respect.  The good guys have given the local Nash dealer a lot of recent business, though they drive older cars of different makes when needed to match stock footage.  But Lugosi is the main show here, aided more by his gadgets than by his bumbling assistant, Monk (Jack C. Smith).

There have been quite a few video editions of this serial, but the ones I've seen all involve prints from Commonwealth Pictures Corporation issued about 1950.  The white lettering of the titles is a little fuzzy, likely due to flare from overexposure during one of the film transfers.  As the ""Foreword"" text scrolls back from the camera during the chapter introductions, instead of becoming slightly defocused it mushrooms into white blobs starting about mid-screen.  There are also a number of jumps due to splices that appear to be in the print Commonwealth used as a master.  But the video editions were not all made from the same release print.

VCI's edition, #8508 is on a double-layer DVD-R disc which won't work with some players.  While the titles have all the fuzziness of Commonwealth's prints, the image during the chapters has good sharpness and tolerable gray scale, better than other editions and possibly from a 35mm print.  The sound has been slightly muffled to reduce the noise, but the dialogue can still be understood, and distortion is lower than usual for this serial.  Unfortunately in addition to the jumps in all Commonwealth prints there are a number of other small pieces missing in VCI's source copy, sometimes interrupting the dialogue; total running time is about two minutes shorter than Alpha's edition.  The chapters start abruptly, clipping the first note or two of the music; all titles show the same MPPDA certificate number, 5333 from Chapter Ten, and there are a couple rough breaks in them.  The credits are otherwise properly simulated, with only the first three chapters having pictures of the main cast.  There is but one ""bonus"" feature, a 1939 Porky Pig cartoon, ""Midnight Matinee"" which, while something that might have been shown in theatres with the serial, doesn't relate to it otherwise.

VCI's old VHS edition, #1723, has fewer small pieces missing than the DVD, but the image is worse in both gray scale and sharpness, and there are are other defects, including a couple tape wrinkles that scroll through the picture near the start of Chapter Six that were in VCI's master.  The sound has more ""hiss"" than the DVD but the high frequencies are welcome.  The opening titles are also spliced-up from different chapters, though most include the opening of the music, and at least a few frames of the correct MPPDA numbers just before the start of the cast list.  Total running time is about 30 seconds shorter than Alpha's edition.  The same video source shows up in the ""Bela Lugosi 10 Movies"" collection once available from bci/eclipse, and the transfer to DVD might have been done from a VHS copy.  The same tape wrinkles appear in Chapter Six, and the first couple seconds of sound and picture are missing on the Universal Pictures logo at the start of Chapter One, where VCI was still displaying their logo after the FBI warning on the VHS tape.

Alpha's DVD edition is in two volumes, ALP 4039D and 4040D, or both shrinkwrapped as 9542D.  It is from a different Commonwealth print than the ones used by VCI, with more scratches and dirt, but the image isn't too blurry, about like VCI's VHS release.  The gray scale is a little lacking, with dark scenes being murky and brighter ones tending to have the highlights wash out, including some facial features.  While no head-switch glitch is visible, there are a couple tape wrinkles in Chapter One.  The picture jitters horizontally in most of Chapter Six, with occasional jitter in the next couple chapters.  The sound is often muffled and distorted, and it periodically fades in the first reel of Chapter Four.  Not Alpha's worst release but not as good as VCI's VHS tape, though at the time it was issued they didn't put their logo on-screen during the credits.

I include the version on two DVD-R discs from Reel Classic Films only because Amazon has linked it to the other reviews; it is remarkably incompetent.  It uses the same video source as Alpha's DVD, with the tape wrinkles in the first chapter, but the image is fairly fuzzy, and there is no sound on half the chapters.  No menu is provided, and there are but four index marks per disc, unrelated to chapter breaks.  The motion is jerky, as if the frame rate is wrong, though the amount depends on the player.  I got it cheap, knowing it had problems and was fascinated with how bad it was rather than annoyed, but for purposes of viewing the serial it is useless.

Sinister Cinema has the serial on two DVD-R discs, available through their website, the first chapter from a print headed by ""Universal Presents"" with nice sharp titles, and without the jumps in the other editions.  The remaining chapters, unfortunately, are from Commonwealth prints.  All chapter titles have the correct MPPDA numbers, but while there are fewer scratches and no horizontal jitter in Chapter Six, image quality is otherwise not much better than Alpha's with gray scale and sharpness issues.

While afflicted with jumps due to splices, the best picture and sound of these is VCI's on a double-layer DVD-R; check the player's instruction manual for ""DVD-R DL"" and ""DVD+R DL"" in the list of compatible disc types.  For other editions, watch out for those that have the 78-minute ""feature,"" released under the same title.  While it may do for those wanting to see ""the whole story"" in one sitting, the plot is a little hard to follow.  The serial is best experienced one chapter at a time, with a day or so between them.",1361059200,,7111,4.858208955223881

I remember watching this one at the old Highland Park YMCA in Brooklyn, N.Y. when I was about ten or eleven. If you liked to get your hair stood up straight by the scary acting of Bela Lugosi, then this was pure delight.  Lugosi, as the eee-vil Dr. Zorka, is the classic black and white villain and prototypical mad scientist.  Over the years and many old movies later, I realize that there were out-takes from at least one of Lugosi's old films.  Specifically, the meteorite retrieval scene from ""The Invisible Ray.""  Too, the plane crashes, car wrecks, and the almost obligatory train wreck now appear as real as a three dollar bill, at the time they had you on the edge of your seat.
As I said, if you are an aficionado of the old serials, then this one is an absolute ""must have!""  All the chapters are here!  This is not the continuous remake that cut over half of the original.  This IS the original, and it's absolutely great!",1314835200,,1037,4.421052631578948
7969276,5,B00006II5E,"I'm reviewing the DVD of the 75-minute film here and NOT the original serial-length DVD version, the latter being marketed by multiple DVD distributors. Be sure when you order that you get what you really want as there is a lot of misinformation and confusion about this issue.

Of course this is a five-star film for bug-eyed B-movie devotees only -- everyone else should forget this one.

THE STORY: As usual, the mainstream scientific community has more or less shunned Lugosi's mad scientist character, Dr. Zorka, and he's out to prove, by any means necessary, that his work has advanced beyond all others... and it has. Explosive homing spiders housing a suspended animation gas and a gigantic remote-controlled robot with the face of an evil Mayan sacrificial god are two of his more stellar achievements. All his inventions are powered by a rare element, which Zorka has secured inside a metal box, and which seems nearly equivalent to the Ark of the Covenant in destructive power. The plot is not a particularly strong one but it fits nicely into the world domination category.

This seventy-five minute film was adapted from the 12-Chapter Serial (1939) by the same name which runs for a total of 265 minutes:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantom-Creeps-Volumes-1-2-Complete-Serial-2-DVD/dp/B000YDKAJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantom Creeps - Volumes 1 & 2 (Complete Serial) (2-DVD)</a>. I like the serial version much better but the editors of the film still did a great job with both the content and the continuity issues. The late-'30s Nash police cars are a real hoot and I think they contribute much to the (now) tongue-in-cheek ambiance of the film.

This isn't the very best horror/sci-fi film I've ever seen but it's in the top twenty percent of such movies for me. Highly recommended for rabid fans of cheesy old horror and/or science-fiction films.",1268524800,,1916,5.355481727574751

7969278,3,B00006II5E,"Serials are an acquired taste; even so, the great serials, such as SPY SMASHER and CAPTAIN MARVEL, transcend changes in style and continue to provide as much amusement today as they did when first show.  THE PHANTOM CREEPS is, alas, not in that class--there is fun to be had, but it is more a matter of camp humor than general enjoyment.

The general story concerns Dr. Alex Zorka (Bela Lugosi), who has created a number of devices of awesome power: robot spiders that self-destruct, causing the person nearest them to fall into suspended animation; a belt that provides its wearer with invisibility; and a monsterous robot that seems indestructible.  These devices are essentially powered by a meteor that Zorba has recovered on an expedition to Africa, and with them he plans to rule the world!

Well, okay, it's not exactly inspired, and the basic problem Zorba has is his own incompetence at bumping off the various American agents and the various international spies who are attempting to obtain the meteor.  Still, it has its moments of grace, most particularly in the form of Lugosi himself, who is always fun to watch.  The spiders are also fun and the robot, which is vaguely racist in appearance, is a hoot and a half.  Film buffs will have fun noticing that the footage of the meteor's discovery is culled from THE INVISIBLE RAY; the serial also uses bits of THE VANISHING SHADOW and news reel footage of the Hindenberg disaster.

The Alpha Volumes 1 & 2 release is actually the Commonwealth re-release of the Universal serial, so it is without the Universal logos one would expect; it does, however, preserve the chapter headings.  The print is hardly pristine: muddy looking at worst, mediocre at best.  Overall, recommended to hardcore serial and Lugosi fans, but best given a miss by everyone else.
