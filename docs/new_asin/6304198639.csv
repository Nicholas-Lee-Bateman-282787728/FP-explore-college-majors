7864812,5,6304198639,"KINO's CARTOONGATE is a one-hour program of politically-minded animation rarities (with a single exception). Condition of source material is superb (again, with one exception).

PROGRAM--
Opening ""Cartoongate"" and closing ""Political Basketball"" segments animated by Doug Compton and Mike Wisniewski.

1944--  HELL BENT FOR ELECTION is a highly colorful and intelligent UAW-CIO sponsored short animated by Chuck Jones. FDR is  a sleek super-train, The ""Win the War Special"" racing to D.C. against the delapidated ""Defeatist Limited."" Includes a fine dream sequence, two songs and straighforward depiction of the days' issues. [13:00]

1952-'56--  B&W TV campaign ads for Dwight Eisenhower concentrate on his cult of popularity and avoid all politics. [2:30]

1960--  NO SUBSTITUTE is a scathing cartoon satire of Richard Nixon, complete with 5 o'clock shadow. The animated Republican candidate plays a scratchy record of his campaign song with singalong words at screen's bottom. He stands stiffly as b&w slides flash to his right. When pics of the TV debates with JFK appear, Nixon sweats profusely. His head falls off a few times as do some limbs, as he taps to the music. [2:30]

1973--  A  POLITICAL CARTOON. Highlight of the collection is this mix of humans and animation, with an electronic soundtrack. PLOT: Laundromat chat between a cartoonist and political campaign manager, who enlists the artist's aid in creating and running for President a vague-talking, innocuous animation. The newly-elected cartoon president unexpectedly takes a firm stand against an evil business conglomerate and they respond by sending all the India Ink back to India, which renders the cartoon prez catatonic. Later, the animator is murdered by the conglomerate, so the politico replaces him with a puppet master. [22:00]

1956--  POPEYE FOR PRESIDENT by Famous Studios is, in context of the other shorts here, common and mere filler. Campaigning Popeye and Brutus vie for Olive's vote. [7:00]

1975--  JIMMY WHO? (excerpts) features highlights from a Carter campaign toon. Rapid-editing of all candidates and their political buttons precedes a gentle ribbing of Jimmy (and his famous teeth). No politics discussed here. [2:30]

1984--  REAGANOCCHIO has an animated Ron sitting at his Oval Office desk. Actual speech excerpts on several topics are used.  As the president speaks his nose gets steadily longer until it changes into a nuclear missile that blasts right off his face. The last scene is an audience of applauding skeletons. [2:35]

1960--  NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN...  Poor copy of a brief B&W appeal for donations to ""the party of your choice."" [:30]

7864813,4,6304198639,"Animation is a powerfully persuasive medium, and it is surprising to see that it has rarely been used for political purposes in the United States.
Greg Ford has collected animated rarities including campy ""I Like Ike"" spots (done by a well known studio), the very odd  A POLITICAL CARTOON (the only feature film appearance of Bugs Bunny in the Seventies) and the best available print of HELL BENT FOR ELECTION, the first UPA cartoon (directed by Chuck Jones and done for the AFL-CIO to support Roosevelt's fourth term.) Watch this one to see what we take for granted: the film promises Social Security, worker's compensation, and the G. I. Bill!
This is a very good sampler of a very strange genre. CARTOONGATE is social history as well as animation; the cartoons present the spirit of the times better than contemporary live action films.",980035200,3,839,4.8671328671328675
