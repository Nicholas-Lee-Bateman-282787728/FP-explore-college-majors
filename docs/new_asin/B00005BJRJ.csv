7937934,2,B00005BJRJ,"I saw this in High School, when i was first getting into anime. It was one of the ones I came across in the video store and picked it up cause it had some cool robots on the cover. The story is lacking and very rushed but the action is pretty cool. Unfortunately it is very much the enemy of the day format but each robot is pretty unique as are the pilots and their indivicual psychoses. If you want some mindless robot action pick up Hades Project Zeorymer.",1327968000,,459,4.168539325842697
