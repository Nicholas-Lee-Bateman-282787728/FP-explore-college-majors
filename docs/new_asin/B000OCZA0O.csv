2793950,5,B000OCZA0O,I have seen the english dub online already it was pretty good.  Not as good as the second or third season but still worth a watch.  But does anyone know if this new one here is uncensored?,1243123200,,188,4.054054054054054
2793951,5,B000OCZA0O,very nice packaging and the box art is simply stunning a great buy highly recomended,1243036800,,84,4.666666666666667
2793952,3,B000OCZA0O,"OK,people. The primary target audiances appears to be those with a fasination with teenagers panties,something this series has way too much of. The storyline does not work well with those not well-versed in Chinese/Japanese history nor with those that cannot grasp a concept that allows high school students to issuse ""imperial orders"" that must be obeyed by students under pain of death. The whole concept of high school students fighting to reinact events that happened more than a thousand years ago in another country and have no control over the outcomes isn't a Western concept. But, on the other hand, if all you want to watch is a dingbat bounce around and show her panties, well, this is your series. Admittedly,however, it is lively,funny and light-weighted enough to be enjoyable for those times you don't want to have to think. The storyline, however, should you wish to get really involved, is quite difficult to follow as it relates to the retelling of the 1000 year old Chinese history of the Three Kingdoms and how that history is now controling the actions of modern Japanese high school students. Nudity is minimal but there is some. Breasts are too frequently over sized,sometimes to a point of off-putting. Several of the females are quite attractivley done but the males are generaly average at best. Recommended for an evening of light viewing but don't expect any great enlightment. OK for most teens, 16+, but there are a few  sexual scenes that are implied in such a manner that they cannot be otherwise rationalzed.",1242777600,14,1541,4.94980694980695
2793953,3,B000OCZA0O,"Lets just say this anime's main objective is perversion and its secondary objective is fighting.

The story and plot is definately nothing new and the whole anime is mainly about showing girls ripping their clothes off during fights. It's bloody, but nothing other than just that. Don't watch this for the fight scenes, I think they're very lacking. Again, the biggest objective of this anime is mainly for the pervertic parts, other than that, there's nothing great about this anime. It is neat to watch, but nothing original. Once you see a bunch of similar animes, you've seen them all. Highly predictable storyline.

I mainly watch it because I'm a guy and it gives me a few grins and smirks here and there. I would NOT watch this if it didn't have any of the girl on girl action (there's some sexual scenes btw, m2f and f2f). It's not that I only watch anime because they're pervertic, it's just that this anime's only positive point is that and pretty much only that.

So quality anime? Na.....storyline and plot sucks....that's why I gave it a 3. I would have given it lower had it not entertain me for a bit.",1240531200,,1116,4.597989949748744
2793954,5,B000OCZA0O,"Yep, its a great story...but....it could have been so much more.

If you like the fighting highschool girls in skimpy clothing that gets shredded for no apparent reason, in all the right places, then this is for you.  I like the story....legends of 1000 year old fighting masters who are eternally at war with each other....but where and when and why did it start?  Why does it continue?  And why are all the ancients reincarnated in beautiful highschool age girls?  And why the little stone earrings?  What about everyone walking around with these crazy weapons?  Doesn't anyone out there think it might be a bit odd for a 6 foot tall, half dressed hottie to be walking around with a great big spear?  LOL....guess not.

A great story for what it was, but it left me wanting more explanations.  Sometimes there needs to be a bit more to the story than exposed flesh and flying fists.  You start with a great premise, then it deflates and spins into the typical knock around story....

But I actually liked the story.  The artwork was very good as well.  Found the set at a very good price, and decided it was worth it to go that route than just buy a single disk in the series.  Turns out to be more economical, and actually well worth it.  Another of those stories that keeps you occupied when there's nothing else to do and you want a change of pace.  Worth the time to get this one.  A great addition to any anime collection.",1217894400,10,1429,4.4517374517374515

2793968,5,B000OCZA0O,"- Synopsis: This anime involves jewels that are infused with the spirits of ancient warriors that acts as a symbol for fighters. The new girl in school isn't your typical gal: nothing gets her off more than a good old-fashion beat-down. Here, a fighter's abilities and skills will determine their standing in the world. Past all the violence, however, emerges a dark and evil force that will soon turn their everyday lives into nightmares.

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Plot is pretty straight-forward which makes it easier to just sit back and relax. Lots of fan-service and lots of action. The fight scenes are often no-holds-barred and as such, are painful and brutal. But, fighters these days have to be tough and/or smart in order to survive in a school of fighters.

- Analysis: A relatively common but overlooked concept of how common conflict is. No matter where one looks, there's always going to be people that just will never settle for compromise. Instead, they resort to violence. But I guess that's the quickest way to convey one's feelings. Rather than dealing with politics and statutes, using force to attain one's desires does have its appeal, and complications. So, long as differences exist, there will most likely always be conflicts.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, with English subtitles. Includes 13 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA due to the amount violence and fan-service. Uncensored and shows plenty of boobs and panty-shots.

- Conclusion: An anime better suited for males due to action and cute girls. It has a simplistic plot making it great for casual audiences. Contains plenty of interesting characters, interactions, drama, brutal fight scenes, and plenty of fan-service. Overall, a nice anime for those looking for action and fan-service.

Its about nothing and nothing happens there's a really dumb girl and that's about the most ""developed"" part of the whole show. If your older than 12 and have a girlfriend don't buy this it contains nothing of value to your life. Its basically matter in its plainest form. I'm going to use my copy to help fill up my garbage can as its the most beneficial thing I could do for humanity at the time and because I couldn't in all good conscious sell this to a store that will put this in the hands of another person and force them to waste the precious time they have.

2794039,3,B000OCZA0O,"This is a fairly well reviewed anime, but I just couldn't get into it.  The quality of the animation was good, but not great.  Acting I thought was ok, but sometimes spotty.  The biggest issue for me was that I just didn't empathize with the two main characters.  I just didn't like them honestly.  I like some of the lesser characters better.  Most of the generally similar anime, say High School DxD, made me laugh and smile and I could get into the characters.  With this one, I thought it was boring and it just never grabbed me and made me want to watch more.  I almost stopped after the first few episodes, but I did wade through it.

2794057,4,B000OCZA0O,"At first glance Ikki Tousen is mindless crap; something like if your Dragonball comics had a baby with a Victoria's Secret catalog. Every female sports skirts so short their panties are constantly visible and the breast bouncing is ridiculous. Get past that and you have attacks that blow shirts and bras apart and a sex crazed mom. Get past that, though, and you are left with young people burdened with the spirits of the warriors who unified ancient China. They are driven to fight and wonder if they are also doomed to live out the same fates as they did in The Romance Of The Three Kingdoms. This ends up being surprisingly good if you can get past the pervy veneer... It is not a masterpiece, but it is a solid effort and it may inspire you to read The Romance Of The Three Kingdoms, the Chinese classic that inspired it (if so, go for the Moss Roberts version from Foreign Language Press).",1396656000,,896,4.5030674846625764

The animation, characters, story and English dub are great, but the excessive fan service could be a major issue for some!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1387152000,3,682,5.1909090909090905

2794097,3,B000OCZA0O,"That is the essence of the series. Students of various schools fight each other and within each school to determine the ""best"". Purchased the SAVE edition and it appears to be an edited version as other editions exist. That is why other reviews do not seem to accurately portray this series. No extras, no fan service, and the storyline is not all that interesting. Romance of the 3 kingdoms? BS. All that Chinese mythology/history gets is a few lines at the end of each episode. The beads and the history behind them get a total of 5 minutes explanation and that is cumulative over the 13 episodes. It also appears to take place not in Japan but on a peninsula (Korea?)and the episodes are 24 minutes long. Nothing in the series that deserves those 4 and 5 star ratings. But also nothing that was found offensive by those 1 and 2 star ratings either. Then again the SAVE edition that is currently available through Amazon is one version and there are others. The cover is also strange- no swords in series. All hand to hand fighting. The first arc (Ep. 1-7) on the first disc is the competition between the fighters. We are introduced to various characters and see many fights. Followed by a couple of downtime episodes, the episodes 10-13 (second disc 8-13) is another story arc where two villainous characters try to out maneuver each other by manipulating the fighters. The storyline focuses on three female fighters and the main one is the one on the cover, Hakafu. Not as good as the series Sekerei (5 stars) and was reluctant to try after reading other reviews but was on sale for ten dollars. Final verdict- OK but not recommended. Also, watched a few episodes comparing Japanese and English and found that the Japanese version slightly better. English version may cause minor boredom and cause fast forward finger syndrome.",1374105600,,1832,4.728125

Well that isn't quite fair.  It has a fairly interesting high concept and if I was bigger on Chinese history it might have resonated with me but I'm not so it fell a bit flat.

2794101,5,B000OCZA0O,"Normally I do not enjoy this sort of thing because it's X-Rated and isn't for the very young, but this had a surprisingly good story line. A group of people known as 'fighters' have these special jewels that allow them to call upon the spirits of the greatest warriors to have ever lived, and somehow become possessed by them, and somehow in the process they tear one anothers cloths off in an attempt to show not only who's the greatest warrior from which school,but to unite each school under one! Lots of panty shots, ripped off bras, nose bleeds, humor and a dull mix of stupidity made it thoroughly enjoyable. And to boot, the fight scenes were actually quite good! LOTS of blood and gore in a few of them! So if your looking for an anime that's intense and somehow allows your IQ to go on holiday, look no further!",1363219200,,820,4.437086092715232

Also, the groping of the girls by the guys and the girls not doing anything about it irritates me. At first I had no idea what's going on, then I startes getting it, but still, it seems it's more for guys even though a lot of women commented on it. Some loved it, other hated it. But some parts of the story are quite funny while other make you want to strangle some characters in the series. The girls come off as weak and submissive unless they are fighting which bothers me seeing as they are supposed to be awesome fighters and badass. It's ok.",1363219200,2,707,4.205882352941177

I give it a 3 because I think the Street Fighter franchise has better character development. Here, the characters are more like...eye candy. I just hope your eyes aren't ""diabetic""... ""Wink, wink, nudge nudge""",1362787200,,355,4.634920634920635
2794104,4,B000OCZA0O,"I just finished this one and I have to say it was bloody and intense until the end.  I found the show enjoyable and yet some how over the top at the same time.

Likes:

Characters are great and many times your not really sure who is bad or good but you enjoy them all the same.
Story line was great and I must admit the idea was one of the most original I have seen.
Animation was colorful and vivid using light and dark to set the scene.
The show while not reaching a final ending at least settled the main plot presented.

Dislikes:

I normally love fan service but this one was way over the top.  In several scenes rape or sex was greatly implied.

Summary:

For the price a great show and I have already purchased the dragon destiny.  I would recommend this one to people wanting hard core blood and fan service.  There is no way I am letting the kids any where near this one.  If you want loads of fan service with less bloody violence check out Girls Bravo or To Love ru.",1362009600,,977,4.116402116402116
2794125,5,B000OCZA0O,This is the first season of Ikki tousen in a beautiful box set. As a fan of the series I am not disappointed and the price when I bought this was lower than the S.A.V.E. edition of the first season which was an even better plus. I feel that this product is for those that are into collector's editions of anime or fans of the anime like myself.,1361750400,,344,4.073529411764706
2794126,5,B000OCZA0O,I bought this for my collection. I read Funimation has the rights to the other seasons but to this day who knows what is going on. My hope was by purchasing the DVD maybe it will help get the ball rolling to future English dubbed seasons on DVD.,1361577600,,245,4.125
2794127,5,B000OCZA0O,"This anime was pretty interesting. it has a decent plot and a great fan service agenda. Literally every single fight has a punch taking out some clothes and believe me there are a lot of fights.
All in all it's good enough to buy and at a decent price.",1360713600,,252,4.163265306122449
2794128,5,B000OCZA0O,"Even though the cover art isn't what the storyline is about, it does represent fighting.  School versus school martial arts on the premises of historical China and how great fighters are reincarnated in high schoolers. . .interesting.  The main character is really tough, but she balances her physical strength and skill with being an airhead. . .she does keep pushing no matter what though.",1360368000,,391,5.09375

Now I can take fan service, and sometimes shows with fan service in them turn out to be pretty good. I'm defiantly not a prude and have a open mind about anything. But this anime sucked so much, it was basically an excuse to show boobs, boobs and OH panties. .-. Ugh, and the story isn't that wonderful, to be honest I'd rather watch a concert recital of horrible playing then this. :O don't get this box set if your looking for a story driven anime with heart, and fan service. Get this, is your INTO FAN SERVICE and panty shots. xD",1357603200,,646,4.176

Her cousin and herself are fighting to protect their friends and keep their school on top. More importantly they fight to make their own destiny.

This anime is a lot of fun. It has great action, comedy, and some really great characters. It's more focused on chicks fighting and getting it on than the actual story. The plot is a bit thin and kinda out there, but interesting. You can easily get into the characters, and want them to be okay in the end. I guess that is what makes an anime good.

oh god why

I only know the show becuase the Kanu (blu hair girl in it) is so populer and I see her character everywhere.

other then that the story is school's fighting, it's boring
it's good if you arel ike 13-14 I guess,

the animation is good
the female characters are some of the hottest around.
very sexy, the show itselfh as no nudity but the extra's have them.

but it's 2 silly and cute to be erotic or anything really.

it's for 12 year olds kids probebly for girls

it's boring and lame really.",1348185600,,529,4.188118811881188
2794147,4,B000OCZA0O,"I'm a big fan of Battle Vixens, (the manga version of Ikki Tousen), and I've seen the show online before purchasing this anime. I had to have a copy of the first season, (since this is not the complete series whatsoever), for myself. This is the S.A.V.E. Edition which is fine for me since I don't really care for box arts and extra special features.

- Animation: The animation is pretty good but I have to admit this though, the animation is a hell of a lot better in manga format. It's very bright but also very sharp, and edgy. There are a lot of panty shots in this anime, do not take other reviewers comments on the fan service lightly. Female characters that are fighters have clothes that rip in battle to expose their breasts and also means much more panty shots.

- Story: Basically, schools are in this war because they hold different souls of fighters from a different era and apparently Hakufu's often dumb ass is the most powerful fighter. There's a bit more to this story than just fan-service but a lot critics disagree with me. Parents be warned of this anime not only because of the absurd amount of fan-service, there is a rape scene between two of the female characters, strong language, sexual situations that are almost pornographic, heavy amounts of sexual innuendos, and large amounts of violence against women.

- Dub and script: The dub is pretty decent but the script kinda sucks to me.

All in all, it's a good anime to watch and buy it since it's low-priced if you're over 18 and you like shows like this. It gets a 4 out of 5 on my end since I wish it looked like the manga and the script and opening and closing songs sucks a poopy wet dog's butt.",1342396800,12,1678,4.4207119741100325

2794151,5,B000OCZA0O,"I will not review the show, since it is likely you have an idea what it is like if you are looking at it. Rather this is a review of this particular set, which is one of several possible choices you can make to get the first season.

The entire season is distributed across four DVDs, which at least in theory means the content does not have to be compressed like it would with a 2 DVD set. The quality of the shows seems to be the equivalent of other commercial DVDs, and each DVD has good quality artwork on its face--not just a printed title or something like a lot of current DVDs.

Additionally, each DVD is in its own case, with artwork on the inside and outside of both front and back covers. The slipcase the DVD cases slide into also has artwork on both sides--as does the outermost sleeve the boxed set slips into. In other words, there is a LOT of character art included that greatly enhances the aesthetic value of the set.

Overall, this is a preferred set if you want something that includes more than the basic content. For that, I give it five stars.",1335571200,6,1066,4.293532338308458
2794152,2,B000OCZA0O,"The story is bad. The voices are horrible.
This series is directed at teen males by featuring a huge amount of violence combined with sexual content toned down enough to avoid a Mature rating.",1335139200,,192,4.676470588235294
2794153,3,B000OCZA0O,"To be honest, I didn't really care for this story.  All the different schools and the different ""fighters"" from each school... its gets confusing and hard to keep track of all the different names, who is who and from what school.  It just gets annoying.  The premise of all these high school kids fighting to be the top-ranked school, and at the same time fulfilling the destiny within their sacred bead, just wasn't so exciting to me.  There are some plot twists with the characters, but overall the story-line was a little boring.  There is comedy in there also, usually in the form of the main character being so studid and naive.  But the comedy is not that much.  There is plenty of ""fan service"" if you wanna see a TON of panties and bare breasts with no nipples.  Not a horrible series but nothing I would ever care to re-watch.  Even at only 13 episodes I was kind of anxious for it to end.  I don't regret checking it out or having it in my collection though.",1333497600,,968,4.387640449438202

I thought the story was decent although it didn't really pick up until maybe the fifth episode. The animation was good and the action was better than many other anime. There is a good reason for the mature rating so if you're buying this for a younger kid I would reconsider. It has several scenes with sexual content and it is quite violent. I liked it for the most part and i will be buying the second season. If you don't mind fan service and a lot of violence then you will enjoy this show. The only fault I had with the dvd was the box was damaged when i got it, thus the 4 stars.",1329955200,,705,4.079136690647482
2794176,4,B000OCZA0O,"It's fun to watch!

A group of teens are given some kind of jewel with the spirit of an ancient fighter.
These people all became great fighters, but there is one special individual with a jewel that consist of most powerful spirit of them all.
That individual's name is: Sonsaku Hakufu. Normally, she is the most non vilent person you could meet, until she is challenged.

In her normal life she's pretty, dumb average girl with one exception, she has a very good figure, and is very well endowed, she has absolutely no problem with public nudity whatsoever.

As like the spirit within the jewel she possesses, she destined to take over Nanyo Acedemy, and later on more!

In the first episode, she meets her cousin koukin, who's family she and her mother is staying with for the time being, in a long while.

Koukin is a very well respectful guy who is rather too respectful...He is easy to shock just doing embarrassin actions. Hakufu for example, usually disregards her clothing, so whether it's in the house, during a fight, she'll be one to lose her top clothing and be left half/full naked, to which he panics every time she makes an advance or takes off her clothes  on her own. Worst of all to her, its normal even around him (Lol)
This anime has A LOT of fan services, but if you're into Ecchi Animes with fighting and other mature rated content, buy this wonderful series! Add it to your collection!

The story's extremely simplistic and never goes anywhere interesting.  The writing and characters never rly surpass their generic, mostly perverted/sadistic, superficial personalities.  The animation isn't terribad but nothing memorable.

 I bought this expecting lots of action-packed, varied fights and some fan service.  I wasn't left with much but the latter (excluding disappointment) once the season was over.  I honestly almost felt pity imagining the target audience for this.  ""S.A.V.E."" your money and pass on this unless Ecchi is what you're searching for.",1327795200,9,728,5.719626168224299

Deunan Knute from Appleseed is an awesome fighter with great moves. If you're into that kinda thing check it out on YouTube. You'll see what I mean.

It was at a time when I was truelly discovering anime and after watching the awesome School Rumble and the kickass first episode of Claymore I found this show on there. It looked like an action anime at first. A promising one at that. I didn't know what fanservice was or that there were anime based off it at the time, so I walked into this show blind. Let me just say I don't mind fanservice in anime. Heck sometimes they lead to amusing moments, but this show just took it to a distasteful level. I watched Godannar for peek sake a fanservicey anime I actually kind of liked, but it was more tolerable than this showXD I wanted to stop watching, but because I'm tenacious and refuse to give up on show/movies even when thier bad until the end I decided to watch all episodes of Ikkis first season so I could come up with a full and fair opinion. With that said hears what I think. I also suggest you check out [...]. She basically sums up every problem I have with this anime and explains it much better.

Plot??? Theres is no plot to this show. That whole BS about the Romance of the 3 kingdoms is just to cover up that this is a Hentai in disquise. Heck it should have been a Hentai so I wouldn't have found it on OnDemand and watched all 13 episodes. I don't even know why they gave this a action anime label. It barely has any action. The action it does have is 99.9% overshadowed by pantyshots or clothes disintergrating as if someone threw a bottle of acid on them.
The fansevice is the worse I've seen in any show not because it completely overshadows the barely there plot, but because it fails completely due to how badly timed these moments are. I mean they unleash during moments where the scenes are ment to be completely seriousXD Not only that but none of the characters expecially the female characters are likable.

 The female protagnist is such an annoying b***. Her voice made me want to drive nails through my ears and its not just the english dub. I've seen stupid protagonist in anime, but thiers usually something charming and likable about them. With this chick I found nothing likable. The japenese sub is just as bad with her voice acting. I cared about none of the characters in this show at all. I've been on wikipedia and other sites trying to figure out what this shows about and still have no clue! How it got so popular I'll never know. You know what I know how. Its because a bunch of horny guys who love this kind of thing started a fanbase and watch mostly for the spankbase factors.

2794200,5,B000OCZA0O,"Ikki Tousen: 8 out of 10: The term fan service is thrown around a lot when people discuss Anime. Ikki Tousen is the greatest (or worst) example of blatant fan service I have seen outside of a pornographic Hentai.

One could easily watch the first few episodes and could think that blatant and somewhat creepy fan service is all Ikki Tousen offers, but something funny happened I got drawn into the story.

In an alternate universe High Schools exist for fighting tournaments. The students wear teardrops shaped earrings that contain the essence of warriors from the Three Kingdoms period in China (also known as called the Six Dynasties) that followed the loss of de facto power by the Han Dynasty emperors. Each character in Ikki Tousen is predestined to the fate of their respective warrior.

So a history lesson is mixed in between the shots of leave nothing to the imagination white panties. Does that really excuse a grown man watching topless high school girls beat each other up?... Probably not no.

The animation is rudimentary and the episodes can be a touch repetitive. There is also that guy blushing sex humor I despise. Nevertheless, as soon as I start to fail to warm to the episodes something dramatic happens too break the pattern (The lesbian rape in Episode 6 Roku is a particular game changer.)

So if you enjoy a good Anime and do not currently appear on any sex offender lists I can highly recommend Ikki Tousen. Give it a few episodes you may be drawn into the history and characterization. Alternatively, you might just be a sick in the head... different strokes and all that.",1258848000,86,1600,4.741007194244604

2794203,4,B000OCZA0O,"Recently bought this box set, 4 disc with art box, new here through Amazon from a volume seller.  I probably knew of the series existence years ago when Pioneer was the distributor/studio yet my purchase was recent because of reviews here on Amazon and because of the attractive pricing of about $17 OTD (out-the-door).  The latest version of this box set,largely red color, appears to have 2 discs and a non-art box.  Most likely this series has been long standing in the market to justify remastering from 4 discs to 2.

The level of violence with comedy I believe is a mismatch.  Some of the fighters are said to be inspired by past warriors and battles take place between the various schools, more like gang rivalry between the schools.  A nose bleed here and there would be acceptable but getting hurt to the point of being hospitalized is a bit too much for a series that is rather heavy on fanservice (abundant panty views and some breast views during bathing).  Another element that contributes to the comedy is shots of deserts like a ice cream  sunday or cake at times.

This heavy cardboard box set is better than many with each volume having a clear, see thru, DVD cases with double sided inserts.  Opening and ending sound track are good with a rock/rap type tune while the ending sound track is soft rock titled, I think, `Let me be with you'.  Usual non credit opening and closing animations and art gallery are included.  Japanese promo and directors interview videos are interesting but the hidden out takes and features can be a pain to figure out.  Keep pressing the `enter' key when executing the directors interview and for the other three volumes without the directors interview the hidden features are under one of the trailers, Tenjho Tenge, Hanaukyo or non credit opening animation.

This box set appears to made around the time of the transition from Geneon/Pioneer to Geneon, box and volumes are dated 2003.  While all DVD cases are clear the make/model of the cases differ, center hub, three different types.  Volume 4 has the worse designed hub requiring considerable flexing of the DVD disc to release.",1249084800,3,2132,4.768392370572207
2794204,5,B000OCZA0O,"All I have to say is Season 2!

 I caught the english dub of Ikki Tousen after learning that Carrie Savage (voice actor that plays Hakafu) says that this was one of her most favorite anime's that she did in her career. If you know Carrie Savage's work than you know she has a very cute child like voice (check out Solty Rei). I like Carrie so I thought that I'd check it out.

 I will say that Ikki Tousen off the top isn't the type of anime I go for. This one is pretty much nonstop fan service. Yeah I enjoy some fan service in the likes of (Burst Angel) but this is no holes barred for 12 episodes. It's entertaining to see, but somehow it cheapens the serious plot.

 The plot of Ikki Tousen in itself is interesting. There is a group of teenagers that live out their lives as the reincarnations of fallen heroes from a story called ""The romance of 3 kingdoms"" they all posses the powers of the warriors from these stories, and live out thier lives according to the tales. However, they wish to defeat the fate that their incarnations fell victim to 1800 years ago. They go around fighting eachother only to solve the 1800 year old quarrels of their predecessors.

 Each group of fighters has a leader that they follow, and each group is classified by the highschool they represent. Some schools are friend,some schools are foe, but in the end they all share the same destinies as Kingdoms of long ago.

 Ikki tousen focuses on the story of a clumsy girl named Hakafu who likes going around fighting random people while wearing a very short skirt. In the series we follow Hakafu as she discovers herself and her new found friends. Through her journey she finds out that she's more special than she thinks she is. She is actually the reincarnation of a powerful warlord names Sonsaku Hakafu. What makes Ikki-Tousen entertaining is that Hakafu is just an airheaded 16 year old girl, but inside her is a powerful warlord that lies dormant.

 On Hakafu's journey you get to meet other characters with the same delimma Hakafu has. They are bound to the fates of their predessors wether they like it or not. Some of these characters accept the fate given to them, while others whos fates mean tradgedy try to fight against it. The story has a wierd pace as it jumps from Serious to Sexy to Hilarious then back again. Overall the first series (the English Box set) is pretty light, the series gets extremely serious and dark in Season 2(only available in Japanese).

 I thought the first season of Ikki Tousen was so so entertaining, but mainly because of the way the story was being told. The seriousness of the story doesn't shine through untill you get to watch the other seasons 2&3 then it all makes sense.

 Season 1 sort of paves the way for the plot, but with its strange style of giveing you Comedy,T&A(you know what I mean), and Tradgedy all at once it can be very confusing. The story ties up in 12 episodes so it goes slow at first, then wraps up pretty quickly. You don't get to see so closely into the personalites of but a few fighters in the Season 1 box set, but you understand them more in the 2nd and 3rd seasons. Character development in the Season 1 set isn't really there, or better yet isn't shown as well as in the other seasons.

 Bottom line, as a stand alone season, The complete box set isn't worth your time. You won't get much of a story but you will get plenty of fan service if that's what your looking for.

 I reccomend this DVD be brought along with the season 2 and season 3 disc if you can get your hands on them. Ikki Tousen season 1 is pretty much only half a story without watching the other seasons.",1243382400,42,3637,4.4

8184538,5,B000OCZA0O,first season is great and way to short.you can honestly watch just this season and be content with the story but there are 4 season total to this series and the other 3 in my opinion don't live up to season 1 but they're still decent and the art style remains consistent thru the whole series but the voice actors change from season 1 to the other 3 seasons. still highly a recommended series,1513036800,,392,4.3108108108108105
8184539,2,B000OCZA0O,"A fun little fan service anime filled to the brim with fighting and panty shots.

However the plot is a bit convoluted and rushed as the show is cursed with only a single season to resolve the arc presented. I feel this particular set-up would have worked better with 2 seasons devoted to character introductions, backstory and plot development.

The motivations of many characters are left by the wayside as the plot simply cannot slow down long enough to develop them to any meaningful extent.
There are of course other seasons of this show but i simply am so turned off by this particular arc and characters that i do not feel like spending my money just to see where it goes.
Still the show is watchable for the price but only barely.  I am also bothered by how much damage these so called ""Fighters"" take without any serious injury (For the most part).",1509494400,,857,4.5519480519480515
