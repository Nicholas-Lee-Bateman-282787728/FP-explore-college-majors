8363382,5,B002C749YM,It was nothing too intriguing but since I had read about Lehder (sp?) taking over the island it was kind of cool to get a civilian's perspective,1426550400,,144,4.37037037037037
8363383,5,B002C749YM,"Awesome documentary!  Such amazing footage and coverage of a topic many people are oblivious to.  Drug lords pirating these beautiful islands smuggling drugs and for any unsuspecting people that happen to come upon Normans Cay it was catastrophic.  MayCay brings back two survivors that narrowly escaped the unthinkable to re-live what happened on the island that day.  You wouldn't believe how many planes are in the water around this island WOW!
The beautiful MayCay does a wonderful job of investigating and narrating what happened that day on Normans Cay; and she flew the plane there wow what a woman!  MUST SEE!!!!!!",1370822400,,622,5.118811881188119
8363384,5,B002C749YM,"This is a great airplane story with a close encounter with a drug cartel!  It is action packed and MayCay does an excellent job!

8363385,2,B002C749YM,The fact that I didn't check and see that it was a DVD was completely my fault.  After I got over that disappointment I decided that it should still be an interesting watch.  However it was extremely short and very repetitive so I wasn't very impressed.,1369267200,,253,4.478260869565218
8363386,5,B002C749YM,Wow- a jaw dropping stranger than fiction account. Puts a refreshing new spin on drug cartel documentaries.  A very personal Mom and Pop story that touches your heart.  The incredible island scenery and movie-like storyline captivated us.,1254614400,6,238,5.405405405405405
