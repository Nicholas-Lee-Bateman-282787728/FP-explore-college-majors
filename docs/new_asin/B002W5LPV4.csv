8382831,3,B002W5LPV4,"My father is getting into chainsaw carving and I was looking for a nice intro instructional DVD as he isn't really the ""book sort."" The DVD itself has a running time of 87 minutes and shows you how to carve three bears. I don't know enough about the art to say whether it is good or bad, but it certainly seemed to be easy to follow with good results. Other DVDs only show you have to carve one item, this showed three different bears, which was nice.

What wasn't nice was the shipping. I had planned on buying more DVDs from this seller if everything went well with this one. After being spoiled by Amazon Prime, eight days seemed an excessive amount of time to ship a DVD. When I finally got it, I heard rattling around with the package. I didn't want to take off the shrinkwrap, but this is a gift so I had to make sure the DVD arrived intact. As I assumed, it was loose inside the case. There were some superficial scratches on the DVD but it still plays fine in my DVD player. If this seller would step up their shipping and make sure the DVDs are secure, I would definitely be a repeat buyer. But, for now, I believe I'll look elsewhere.",1321574400,,1144,4.223744292237443
