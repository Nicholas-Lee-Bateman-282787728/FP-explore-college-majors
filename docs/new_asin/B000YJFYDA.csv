8233152,5,B000YJFYDA,Great product. However after purchasing found out that all the videos are on YouTube...full length :-/ still nice to have all together tho and in order.,1316649600,,152,4.884615384615385
8233153,4,B000YJFYDA,"I learned a lot from this video. I am a massage student and the video gave me lots of ideas for a great back massage.
The positives: There was no annoying music, lots of different techniques that are shown a couple of times before moving onto the next.
The annoying bits: bad camera techniques, at times blury. You can hear at times flicking of paper where the reader refers to his references
It was worth the money and I will be using the video for sure.",1271376000,,455,4.3023255813953485
8233154,5,B000YJFYDA,Don't let the creepy cover or the model's tramp stamp scare you away.  This is a great video that shows lots of back techniques & taught very clearly & no annoying music in the background.  I am a student & this was very helpful & worth the purchase.,1268179200,,250,4.1875
