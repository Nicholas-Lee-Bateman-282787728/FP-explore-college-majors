2554486,4,B000F7BODA,"I agree with almost everything the other SF reviewer said but I am giving the singers far more credit in the rating.  The production seem interesting from what you could tell, in particular Act 3 (I wonder if all that water was room temperature <G>).  BUT, I can't think of enough 4 letter words to describe how the video director absolutely ruined the experience.  Act 1 was the worst and Act 2 was only slightly better.  Act 3 was calm for a while at least.  What was someone thinking when they allowed this man to make the video.  PLEASE, never again!",1156809600,15,554,4.435643564356436
2554487,2,B000F7BODA,"Take six competent singers, a not overly-conceptual concept production, an established conductor and world-class orchestra, a young stage director cutting his chops, and you have a challenging evening of musical theater.  But record a large part of each act in startling, unflattering close-ups with hand-held, jolting cameras jumping between natural color and the nuclear green glow of night vision and you have a VERY annoying and disappointing viewing experience. Wagner's most intimate and intense love story was evidently not dumped on heavily enough by stage director Olivier Py for the label's taste; the cretinous video director Andy Sommer was engaged to pull the performance down to the sad level of eurotrash productions currently sweeping the continent.

What frustrates in the videography most of all is that one never has a clear concept of the stage space.  It wasn't until watching the documentary on the production that I found out there was actually a model ship sailing from one side of the stage to the other in Act I.  The bizarre angles are particularly puerile in the first act;  Act II is almost steady by comparison, and much is lost from upstage in Act III.  After viewing this DVD one could actually go to a live revival of the production and see it for the first time.

Musically, the revelation of the performance is the handsome American tenor Clifton Forbis, whose Baritone-like timbre and even production in all registers make him an admirable and heroic Tristan.  Showing no signs of vocal fatigue in the grueling marathon that is Act III, his voice only squeaks once in the frenzied last scene of Act II.  His total fearlessness in singing the role allows him to devote more energy to character refinement, which is rare among today's Tristans.  His German diction is flawless as well. I won't consider him the great white Heldentenor, though, until I see his Siegfried.

Also impressive is the American soprano Jeanne-Michele Charbonnet as Isolde.  She's a bit over the top with the teeth-gnashing in the first act, but delivers a performance varied in expression, dynamics and intensity.  Her post-potion personality seems to be the one closest to her true self, for the high C she sings in Act II is effortless compared with the forced one she sings in the Narrative/Curse of Act I.  She blends well vocally with Tristan, and actually KISSES him passionately and repeatedly, which is something you don't see often.  Unfortunately, by the time the Liebestod comes around, she has already spent her vocal capital.  Her final phrases are weak, flat, and flaccid, but she does manage to sing a beautiful last note on ""Lust,"" even though it is mezzo forte (instead of pianissimo).

Mihoko Fujimara has a lovely voice, although it is only about half the size needed to sing Brangaene properly. As Koenig Marke, Alfred Reiter is lanky and melancholic, and has a smoothness to his not-so-deep bass voice that is fitting for the concept of his role as an ineffectual weakling.  Albert Dohmen wins the testosterone award for his swaggering Kurwenal with a voice that cuts like steel.  Do you really care about Melot?

I had truly expected more nuance from conductor Armin Jordan, who is by no means a stranger to Wagner.  All tempos are on the fast side, which is fine if you can still draw the necessary tension, beauty, and wonder from the score.  But all too often he seemed to be watching the clock.  I've always tended to speculate on what kind of lovers conductors are/were from the way they direct/directed the Liebestod, Wagner's musical depiction of orgasm.  M. Jordan, in contradistinction to his advanced age, would tend to border on the slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am.  (Or, perhaps he's just trying to help out his failing Isolde.)

The final image we get on the DVD is a Drer-like one of the conductor's uplifted hands with baton pointing toward the stage during the orchestral postlude, leading us to ask, ""What the hell is up with Isolde?""  Again, the documentary is useful for actually being able to see what she's doing during the last bars of the piece.

The stage director, M. Py, states in the extras that Tristan and Isolde is a morbid opera about teenage suicide.  If only it could have been captured that way on DVD, instead of like some ineffably wretched teen video game.",1156723200,33,4318,4.917241379310345
8118719,5,B000F7BODA,"I am going to Dessau to see Wagner's Ring this next spring, and Brunhilde will be played by LORDANKA DERILOVA. What a name! Well I had to hear her and there  was this Tristan available so I got it and she is good. But I must admit I was taken with her name. Now I can't wait to see her in person. You too can hear LORDANKA DERILOVA. NOW!",1409184000,,337,3.8840579710144927
8118720,2,B000F7BODA,"Well-played and sung, with attractive singers, and an excellent traditional set, this COULD have been the definitive Tristan und Isolde on video. That is, if they had gone and raided the local college drama department for a few simple period costumes (drab would be fine, even burlap bags).

Instead we get 21st century business casual, party attire, and hair tint, all strutting around on a wooden sailing ship, delivering a bride to the King as per the libretto, discussing political problems between Ireland and Cornwall, etc.

Other than the costuming, it's a very decent production and could well have been the definitive Tristan video.  Too bad, it is certainly no such thing now.",1390780800,3,686,5.053097345132743
8118721,3,B000F7BODA,"The voices are so beautiful, but the acting, esepcially in the love duet is so cold, and does not show any emotions, contrary to said words that express deep love.",1356998400,2,163,4.466666666666667
8118722,1,B000F7BODA,"A lot of things have to come together to for a compelling opera DVD: The orchestra's playing, the conductor's interpretation, the singer's performance in terms of both vocals and acting, the set design, stage direction, costume design, as well as capturing and producing the audio and visuals.

Orchestra and conducting: world class. Singers: about as good as you can expect for Wagner in this day and age. Set design/costumes and direction: interesting and inspired at times and slightly stupid at others (fairly standard 21st century Regietheater fare here). Audio: Rich and well balanced.

So we're doing pretty well. And then you get some idiot who can't work a camera.

Really, for all the countless hours the orchestra players spent learning their instruments, the singers to learn the most demanding roles in the repertoire, and the director to create a vision and work for years to bring it to life, all we ask of the video director is that he point a camera at the stage and allow us to witness it. This proves too much a task for our video director who films the thing like a drunk highschool film student on a cellphone, and subsequently lays waste to the talent around him God unfortunately did not also bestow on him.

Watching this to get swept up in the overwhelming beauty of Wagner's music? You won't be able to. The camera jumps cuts approximately every 5 seconds or so at random, alternating between extreme closeups, to bizarre angles at a distance, to backstage, to THE ORCHESTRA (???), at complete disjunct with Wagner's gorgeously drawn out melodic lines, dicing them up so and obliterating their emotional impact. It appears to all be filmed by hand, the shakiness varying by cameraman. It's amateurish. It's garbage.

It's such a shame because really this could have been something to see and hear in person.

8118723,5,B000F7BODA,"If you like modern and post-modern works of art you will love the serious visual beauty in this production. Reading the other reviews I cannot understand the  differences of opinion about conducting and singing. The musical experience is beautiful. The over-all viewing experience is wonderful.
I have written this because I think the reviewer rating of the production is too low. Anyone who loves opera will know that perfect productions are rare, and exaggerated personal opinions are common.
There are gratuitous moments in this film, but it is serious about understanding Wagner's theatre and contributing to contemporary ideas in art. You should probably see it.",1301875200,,667,5.352380952380952
8118724,3,B000F7BODA,"While not a Tristan for the ages, this set from a German provincial house represents what I love most about opera: a company with a permanent roster, orchestra and theatre tackling challenging one of the giants of the operatic repertoire. That a town of 70,000 has a company capable of mounting a Tristan at all warrants our attention.

Anhiltisches designers are hampered by having no rear wall and a fully visible orchestra parked directly behind the playing area.  Felsenstein gives us a rear projection of a moving sea, beautifully lit to vary the times of day in which the story occurs. Lighting here is amazing - the most important element of the set defining terrain, locations, and more.

The chief stage area is a smallish rectangular platform taking up half of the width of the theatre/stage area - almost all action occurs here on this rectangle, which is also a turntable, allowing for scene changes and offering different perspectives of a particular scene. In an opera often considered ""static"" this flow of motion allows Tristan and Isolde to remain immobile, while passing through lighting effects that offers deeper insights into their characters.

Company soprano and Bulgarian beauty Iordanka Derilove is absolutely gorgeous and offers the most physical and one of the most emotionally complex Isoldes I've yet seen. Her Irish Princess is intelligent, regal - every inch a future queen, yet also wild, febrile with a sexuality that frequently crosses over into the obsessive. Few Isoldes put across the irony of the first act, if at all, certainly not anywhere approaching the level Derilove does, with the flair of a Redgrave or a Streep. The mocking admonishment she delivers at

"". . . ein sanftres Weib
gewnnst du nie.
Ihren Angelobten
erschlug ich ihr einst,
sein Haupt sandt' ich ihr heim;""

is dripping with irony and malice, registering in Derilove's face and body language as much as in the voice itself . . . or more so Here it saddens me I can not be more enthusiastic about the soprano's voice itself. It's not unpleasant, and after Tristans' many hours, I grew to become a bit more familiar with it, but it is not particularly distinctive and sometimes sounds like two different singers; a beautiful ""lyric"" Isolde in many moments, but also strident and occasionally raw sounding when she applies pressure to the bigger moments. (Derilove has a fascinating and expressive face, reminding me variously of Callas, Zoe Caldwell, Waltrud Meier and Anna Netrebko).

Lovely, throughout, Derilove's second act, barefoot, a pink/red flowery dress appropriate for high tea, which simultaneous hugs and flows from her, she is as breathtakingly lovely. an Isolde as one could possibly imagine. Slipping out of a fur in Act III to reveal a simple white slip/gown, her very moving Liebestod combines an outsized eroticism with a spiritual awakening - a wonderful way, in my opinion, to approach Wagner.

Several German companies, including Dessau, seem to share a heldentenor in the American, Richard Decker who presents a physically solid attempt at the role, not always thrilling in voice or action, but knows his way through the role, where to harbor his resources and how to pace himself in tenordom's perhaps most brutal act. While he remains considerably more passive than his Isolde, when he does let loose, the passion between the pair is palpable and incendiary. Oddly their voices do not always match up and the beginning of the first duet when singing in concert - something sounds ""wrong"" - the music sort of lurches forward trying to find proper pitch, but not always with success. Fortunately, their erotically charged second act duet - much of it sung lying down, heads facing away from the house, on the mossy green embankment surrounded by Stonehenge-type of rock formations, catches genuine fire, with Brangane's watch and segue into Mark and Melot's arrival, absolutely thrilling operatic theatre.

Alexandra Petersamer offers a fine Brangne garnering the evening's biggest ovation. She is something special, though with just a hint of stridency at the beginning of her Watch scene. When she reappears for its conclusion, it is breathtaking. This, for me, is one of Wagner's most brilliant musical and theatrical effects - combining the realms of the physical, spiritual, romantic and fantastic. Its abrupt segue to the King's arrival - as emotionally violent as being hit by an unseen and speeding bus.

Ulf Paulsen offers a solid, incredibly likeable Kurwenal. A great actor with an interesting and sometimes rather beautiful sound, he looks terrific and his allegiance and love for Tristan is never less than believable.

Marek Wojciechowski looks a mite young for King Mark, but has a stoic tragedy in his countenance that fits the sad monarch like a glove. He has an interesting voice, deep- almost black of color at times -with a vibrato that, occasionally accelerates into a slight tremolo. Overall, his basic timbre is warm and rich and he offers a satisfying Mark in all respects.

The entirety of the ""sets"" are as follows: Act I: the wooden ""ribs"" of the ship below deck; Act II: Giant stone obelisks in a faintly ""Stonehenge"" arrangement and for Act III, a large flat rock for Tristan's body.

With such sparseness of settings, minimal props an orchestra ""behind"" you, no prompter and no visible connection and guidance from the conductor, I can't imagine a more difficult work to mount than Tristan und Isolde. If this was (as I believe) caught near the opening (or perhaps was the actual opening) I can only imagine that the performers grew more comfortable as the run progressed.

Musically, the Dessau orchestra is impressive under resident maestro, the youngish looking Golo Berg, generally belying the smallish venue and often sounding lush, and experienced in Wagnerian playing, sweeping along the big moments, and tenderly lingering on some genuine . Sometimes a lack of ""bite"" can be noticed (particularly in the opening phrase of the Act III vorspiel) and in the bit of music following Marke's impressive second act solo, an oboe sounds to have a minor mishap.

While major international houses continue having problems mounting Tristan, it is encouraging to see a tiny company like Dessau, with nowhere near the resources of, say, The Met or Covent Garden, tackle one of opera's most challenging cornerstones.

I KNOW listers who would dismiss this as ""crap,"" but for those Wagnerians not perpetually mourning the loss of Flagstad or Melchior or not incapable of forgiving a misplaced note, this small scale approach to Wagner may have a unique appeal.",1234224000,40,6613,5.058769513314968
8118725,2,B000F7BODA,"This was easily one of the most frustrating DVDs I have come across.  And of course it was not cheap either.  The conducting was excellent, and the singers ranged from good (Charbonnet) to the so-so (Forbis).  From an audio perspective it was a fairly representative of what we hear broadcast from major opera houses.  Unfortunately we are not talking about CDs, and all I can say is that the artists' painstaking efforts were sabotaged by the bizarre video direction (and that's putting it kindly).  Others have described the director's shenanigans better than I (Oh all the colors and camera jumping was enough to make one seasick). How bad was it?  So bad that I could only watch it once...after shelling out big bucks!  I don't mind something innovative and a fresh approach to a classic, but this was rediculous.  I couldn't even tell much how the production fared.  I gave it away to the book store without even asking for an exchange...",1220745600,,943,4.771604938271605
8118726,5,B000F7BODA,"Okay. I think that what needs to be looked at here are the intentions of this opera, particularly how is was filmed. I might be wrong but if you're a 19 year old goth who spends most of his time watching metal video's, what better way is there to inspire such a heart-bludgeoning, death-loving person than with this very production, including its filming?

From the point of someone who has seen/heard a thousand Tristan's, yes, the filming here is bad. But that does not mean it does not have it's place within the opera repitoir. I myself am 20 (although not a goth by any means) and in being used to MTV style filming, i found this production very accessable (which says a lot considering this is Tristan afterall).

You would think that those who appreciate art of this stature would have an open mind for such things.

Enough said.",1191456000,3,836,4.56
8118727,4,B000F7BODA,"Tristan und Isolde is really one of the great operas .I love this music , and sometimes I think that this is the best thing Wagner wrote. This DVD musically is very good. I never heard before the majority of the singers. That was really a big surprise. Jeanne - Michele  Charbonnet  is one of the best Isoldes I have heard. Comparable with Altmayer and Johanna Meier .She hasn't the iron in the voice as Nilsson had and because of this her Isolde is very human and sensitive. Clifton Forbis is one outstanding Tristan . Since Windgassen and Kollo I never heard one Tristan so well sung. The couple is really fantastic and the erotic sensation at the beginning of the duet in the second act was impossible with the bodies of the couple in the DVD made at the Metropolitan .Alfred Reiter, Albert Dohmen  and Mihoko Fujimura are outstanding too. The orchestra is fantastic and the conductor was really one of the great conductor of his time. He died some months after this Tristan . The only thing that I regret are the two cuts, one in the love duet ( this one very traditional) and the other in the monologue of Tristan in the third act. Musically,with thes two cuts, I think that this DVD is really of first rate .
  The stage director, Olivier Py had very good ideas. I can't agree with the skull of Morold in the middle of the second act. And I could not understand the corpse at the narration of Isolde  in the first act. But there were moments really inspired. The two actors in the third act  as the father and the mother of Tristan was really moving. The costumes  were the worse part of the spectacle, one kind of ""Star Trek "" style.
  I can `t give 5 stars because of the direction of the video. It was irritating that camera always moving. The camera ""green""  was awful . And the conductor and the viola player appearing at the middle of the action are  very bad ideas .
  I would like to congratulate Mr. Lombard as the English Horn solo in the third act. The idea ,putting the musician in scene ,was very good , and he is one fantastic player.",1183161600,4,2054,4.3569553805774275
8118728,5,B000F7BODA,"I can't say how much I disagree with the two previous American 'critics' who enjoy pooh-poohing this very fine DVD production. Probably they like the others better.  Do they prefer the Bayerishe Staatsoper's effort with the cocktails in the first act and the  couch-flipping Tristan in the 2nd act or perhaps the literally unwatchable Met production ? The famous Barenboim from Bayreuth videotape dating from 80'-s is, of course, discontinued but that was was my favorite up to now. This new one with its totally up to date sound and picture quality must take precedence.

It might help if these 'critics' would concentrate on the positive aspects that do not seem to matter to them. This is a truly creative and original concept of stage design and lighting making this production unique. French director Olivier Py's total commitment is manifest everywhere down to the last detail. The colour change from realistic to infrared photography at the love potion scene, with emphasis on hands touching each other, is magical. In the Love Duet, the concept of interconnecting rooms (achieved by a revolving stage) with abrupt lighting changes gives new meaning to the text. The 3rd act set is incredible with its flooded stage, a `watery world' representing a continuum of life and death. Isolde's rise to `heaven' is a finale unlikely to be forgotten.

But I do agree about some aspects of the videography with too many changes and unnecessary tilting angles. It's unfortunate that everyone wants to be noticed and be a 'star'.

To knock Armin Jordan, an accomplished Wagnerian, who controls the score masterfully and never lets the tension sag is simply unforgiveable. Conducting with minimal movements his is a passionate performance of great insight with almost Furtwanglerian intuition. Those who think otherwise, might look at his magnificent Parsifal production, probably the best Parsifal ever.

  American dramatic soprano, Jeanne- Michele Charbonnet has risen to fame just recently and  her magnificent voice, passionate acting and thorough understanding of the role of Isolde makes her superior to the rest of the cast. Clifton Forbis, a strong heldentenor,  is a deeply suffering, sensitive Tristan who copes very well with this most difficult and strenuous of roles, though his voice seems to weaken in the last act. Mihoko Fujimura's intense and insightful Brangaene is memorable, though with less vocal power than might be expected, while Alfred Reiter with his resonant basso injects excitement into Konig Marke's monologue that can be tedious in lesser productions.

All in all, in my opinion, a very fine release. Probably best of currently available versions. I recommend it highly.",1159747200,30,2697,5.234338747099768
