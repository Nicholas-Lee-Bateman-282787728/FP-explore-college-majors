6994791,3,B00SYT09Q4,"What started out as a beautiful, thoughtful historical piece quickly turned tedious.  Initially intriguing characters are quickly and harshly stereotyped rendering the movie barely watchable.  How sad, this could have been a great movie.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  Each scene is beautifully layered in elegant loveliness but sadly I couldn't wait for it to end.",1430524800,5,368,5.636363636363637
6994792,5,B00SYT09Q4,Excellent,1481155200,,9,9.0
6994793,4,B00SYT09Q4,I found a lot more information on Dr. Schweitzer and the difficulties that he and his assistants went through than I had known before. He certainly was as great as history records of him.,1478649600,,187,4.529411764705882
6994794,3,B00SYT09Q4,Movie is interesting but nothing special.  Much of the film is superficial.  I could learn more about Albert Schweitzer by reading his Wikipedia entry than I did watching this.,1478563200,,176,5.0344827586206895
6994795,4,B00SYT09Q4,"Edifying, offers a view of Schweitzer's life that I was not aware of. Type of movie that I would view if there were more of them.",1477958400,,129,4.0
6994796,5,B00SYT09Q4,"An excellent bio-pic, which brings together several different facets of a remarkable life. While Schweitzer spent most of his life as the primary doctor in an African hospital for lepers, the movie shows some of the fascinating ways that he became involved with Albert Einstein and others during the post World War 2 period.",1472256000,,324,5.018518518518518
6994797,5,B00SYT09Q4,Great portray of his work,1471737600,,25,4.2
6994798,3,B00SYT09Q4,Acting is good and story interesting- I didn't know who Albert Schweitzer was before;  but you should skip if you prefer action.  This was a slow moving movie.  My kids & husband couldn't stick with it.,1470787200,,202,4.555555555555555

6994806,3,B00SYT09Q4,"This movie was a good watch but didn't quite satisfy my curiosity about Albert Schweitzer.  I've heard about him all my life, when I was a child I was watching the Dick Van Dyke show. There was a joke about "" not being an Albert Schweitzer.""  I've been curious about him since.  I do know a little more now. He was an amazing man.
 Barbara Hershey's performance as his wife was very good. She is so versatile.  There were scenes that kind of took up film in my opinion, when it seemed something more important could have gone there, like with the pelican. But,  I did enjoy this movie. I wish it had told even more about him and his wife and how they both died, etc.  I do recommend this movie to anyone who wonders about those times and the great giving men and women who made such a difference in the world.",1463788800,3,809,4.214285714285714
6994807,5,B00SYT09Q4,great movie about a great man and the times and political turmoil of the time,1463788800,,77,4.2
6994808,3,B00SYT09Q4,"Interesting, but too much political focus",1462924800,,41,6.0
6994809,2,B00SYT09Q4,"Good story about Schweitzer, but loaded with anti McCarthy propaganda. . It was almost unbearable because of the blatant propaganda.",1461715200,,132,5.65
6994810,4,B00SYT09Q4,"I thought this was very good and educational.  I learned a lot, I'm glad it watched it.",1456531200,,87,4.117647058823529
6994811,5,B00SYT09Q4,"This movie told me about his connection with Albert Einstein and how he was under investigaion for being ""communist"" because he was against the hydrogen bomb.  Never heard that before.  Well acted.",1456531200,,197,5.125
6994812,5,B00SYT09Q4,"At first, from the title, I thought this would be a movie about African Americans and the fine, outstanding work they do. But it was not!  Historically it was most fascinating, and not just another piece about the White Man's Burden among the Savages of Afrika.  Most enjoyable, and I highly recommend it.",1454544000,,305,4.735849056603773
6994813,4,B00SYT09Q4,Actually I would give it 3 1/2 stars.  It was a pretty informative movie but rather had to follow.  The acting was a little above average.,1453852800,,138,4.269230769230769

6994819,4,B00SYT09Q4,good movie.  I really didn't know much about him.  I was in high school and college when some of this happened.  So I didn't know anything current then.,1440979200,,152,4.357142857142857
6994820,5,B00SYT09Q4,What a great man. He did so .much to help the Africans. GOD Bless Him,1440720000,,69,3.6666666666666665

6994827,1,B00SYT09Q4,"It may have been a great program but due to persistent night time streaming, loading and  viewing glitches with Amazon I wasn't able to watch.  I don't have reception glitches during the day time; I never have any with your N. competition day or night.",1439510400,,252,4.5777777777777775

6994832,5,B00SYT09Q4,Must see,1438214400,,8,3.5
6994833,3,B00SYT09Q4,"Aspects of this film are very powerful and yet it failed to portray the true complexity of the conflict between immense genius, social responsibility, and spiritual imperative that was Dr. Schweitzer. Some of this is tantalizingly introduced, but only the issue of ""the bomb vs life"" is developed at all (and that as cliche). About halfway through, the plot devolves into stereotypes of McCarthyism vs. progressive socialism. The man, his mission, and his life message are sadly underwhelmed by this film. Still, it does manage to introduce a generation to a remarkable human being whose life deserves to be observed and considered-if only because the issues with which Schweitzer wrestled for his whole life are even more vital to us today than they were in his lifetime.",1438214400,10,772,5.086614173228346
6994834,5,B00SYT09Q4,His story being retold was a nice reminder of what once was.  We thoroughly enjoyed it!,1438214400,,87,4.4375

6994839,1,B00SYT09Q4,This was a very boring film.  I'd gotten about thirty minutes into it and stopped realizing I'd wasted my time.,1436572800,,111,4.55
6994840,4,B00SYT09Q4,Well done. Reveals much about Schweitzer's efforts in Africa.,1436400000,,61,5.888888888888889
6994841,5,B00SYT09Q4,"I had no idea Schweitzer was so key in creating some of our current social perspectives
on environmentalism, test ban treaties, etc.  I asked my colleagues, none of them were
aware either.  The movie really does a service to educate us about an important man
whose legacy we seem to be still admiring greatly.",1435622400,2,309,4.703703703703703

6994843,4,B00SYT09Q4,"Very likeable movie.

  I learned quite a bit about Albert Schweitzer and very surprised that he would spend several years helping Lepers in Africa, and his wife along side him, assisting, as well.",1435276800,,197,4.909090909090909

6994847,5,B00SYT09Q4,A very enlightening movie about this man and the times he lived in. I learned a lot from watching it as well as felt entertained by the well played roles. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline.,1433721600,2,190,4.457142857142857
6994848,2,B00SYT09Q4,"Hope Faith and Love
What started out as a colorful movie about a caring doctor turns bad. The script part which has the doctor asking who did Jesus Love and questioning wither Jesus loved anyone is blasphemy against Jesus. Also stating Poor Joseph.  Makes me question the people who put this thing together to show the movie crowds.  Mrs. Ruth Manning",1433635200,5,351,4.737704918032787
6994849,5,B00SYT09Q4,"Excellent film about a truly great man that you most probably won't ever learn about in school and that's a shame. However, this film is well worth your time to get a bit of a sense of who he was and how he had a great impact on the world.",1433289600,5,239,3.8

6994851,3,B00SYT09Q4,Entertaining but forgettable. Best part--finding out that Albert Schweitzer and Albert Einstein were BBF.,1432339200,,105,6.571428571428571
8699859,3,B00SYT09Q4,Disappointing.  Expected far better,1524787200,,35,7.75
8699860,2,B00SYT09Q4,"Honestly, I don't understand why they have to throw in disrespectful and demeaning comments about Christ and Christianity. The movie is not even about that. P.S. Amazon better not delete this comment like they did my other one. I have the right to not like disrespect to Christianity.",1506643200,,284,4.9375
8699861,1,B00SYT09Q4,"The name of the movie is Albert Schweitzer. I expected a balanced biography about the man. Yes, he was a doctor, but his other hats, like theologian, scientist, musician, were barely mentioned. Then, the only concrete idea of his that came out in the movie is that he was against ""the bomb"". Instead of bringing viewers to follow the man's train of thought, development of his ideas, etc, the producers of this movie seem to have borrowed this good man's name and used it as propaganda for liberalism. At a certain point in the story, the villain says to one of Dr. Schweitzer's aids, ""You liberals..."". Sorry, this observant viewer immediately saw right through what you were doing.",1491955200,2,683,4.796610169491525

8699865,5,B00SYT09Q4,"Excellent movie about a segment of Schweitzer's life that I was not familiar. The acting was very good. Also, I liked that he was not portrayed as a ""perfect"" person, but someone who had faults just as we all do. All around good movie.",1485129600,,235,4.363636363636363
8699866,4,B00SYT09Q4,Albert Schweitzer reminds of what true sacrifice is.  It's because of people like him that much good in the world is accomplished.  But it doesn't come without a huge price.  I feel I know the man now.  Well done!,1485043200,,213,4.384615384615385
