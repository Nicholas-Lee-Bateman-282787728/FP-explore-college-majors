7878556,5,6304872925,"Many years ago, I used to watch (for some unknown reason) the old broadcast ""Holland by Satellite"" on my cable TV set. One week it featured the #1 song in the Netherlands, and scenes from this move. When I heard the powerful voice this kid had, and the song Ik voel me zo verdomd alleen. I determined that eventually I would 1) get a copy of the movie--- and 2) learn to speak enough Dutch to make out some or most of this flick.  The story is about a kid really caught in a bad situation. His mother is a horrible and abusive woman, the time is pre-World War II Amsterdam.  The kid has a father who, while he loves the kid, is away from home a LOT as a merchant seaman. The parents are apparently separated, and the mom works in a pub. Long and short, the kid gets into a lot of trouble, and is sent from one foster home to another--even to a prison-like detention center for boys. Through this and many many trials, there is a teacher who takes to the child, tries to work with him, but Ciske (short for Franciskus) still has many trials.  In the school he befriends a sickly child who becomes his dearest friend. Sadly, the boy dies--and yet, when they begin to get over it, they give Ciske the boy's copy of a favorite child's book (I forgot what it was but it's something like Grimm's Fairy Tales or something like that)... in a fit or anger the mother yanks it from him and begins tearing out the pages... which pushes poor Ciske over the edge.  I won't give away any more here; but will say that it is a Dutch movie, and there are some scenes in it that would not be considered appropriate by many American homes for children to see, including brief nudity. Aside from this, however I found the story utterly captivating and was able to discern the plot without understanding a word I was hearing.  I still have that Dutch DVD; but notice there are some versions with English subtitles.  I wish Amazon would get a few copies because the acting is superb--the plot is riveting and heartwarming (by the end). I think it was great and would love to get the captioned version... and yup... I'm already 1/3 through a Dutch course and can make out a fair part of the dialogue; but in no way can I keep up with how fast they talk.  Definitely a thumbs up for people want a story that DOES have a happy ending, although your heart really goes out to this kid through all the trials he endures.  The term Rat... speaks for itself.  At the very least, if you've never heard the song Ik voel me zo verdoomd aleen. (I feel so damned alone!) -- you might want to listen to it-- this kid has/had some powerful lungs.. and the words (get a translation of the song if you can) are also heart-wrenching.  I definitely rate it 5 stars.",1467158400,,2724,4.292397660818714
7878557,5,6304872925,"A genuine and very heartfelt film. Generally I have second thoughts on those involved with the law, but seeing what this child had to put up with, I really and truly felt sorry for him. With an extremely abusive mother, an absentee father and an aunt who says she loves him but not willing to go any further than that, how can a child survive in those situations. Then he had problems with the school who tends to believe the very people that was making the child's life miserable. Looking for anybody he can really call his friend, he found him through a wheelchair-bound sickly child. But unfortunately the child dies and the child's father placed all the blame on Ciske. But alas with help from a chaplain and a teacher who agreed to be his guardian, the events in the boy's life started to turn for the better even though he still had several more hurdles to overcome.",1393113600,,872,4.490566037735849

7878559,4,6304872925,"""Ciske de Rat"" is a Dutch film made in 1984 and it shows in a
disturbing way how dysfunctional and fragmented family life
can adversely effect the lives of young children.

The story which is set in 1934, concentrates on an 11 year old
Amsterdam school-boy named Ciske (Danny de Munk) who
is full of mischief and is constantly getting himself into trouble.
It supports the fact that life is not kind to all and that some
youngsters endure a life of misery and neglect through no
fault of their own.  Ciske is not well liked and even at school
he is subject to abuse and bullying but through all of this he
has a heart of gold and consideration for others less
fortunate.

This is a story about Ciske's growing pains but unfortunately
he has to endure more pain than others and the terrible
environment in which he has to live is no comfort.

His father is a sailor who spends little time at home whilst his
mother is a promiscuous bar maid whose disdain for the boy
is obvious and she cares little about Ciske and her younger
child and often abuses them.  She cares only for her lovers,
so it is easy to understand why Ciske is full of rage at life's
injustices and seeks revenge.

Constantly in trouble both at school and in the streets, Ciske
is most certainly on a collision course with disaster.  His
mother even has the boy committed to an institution to stop his
rebellious ways and then ironically does her best to stop help
being given to him.

Danny de Munk is a talented young actor who is capable of
displaying a wide range of emotions.  He will steal your heart
and you will agonize with him at life's bitter treatment that he
has to endure.

The song during the opening credits of the movie is performed
by Danny de Munk who plays the role of Ciske and is a
famous singer from the Netherlands.

This is a movie that you will watch over and over again and if
you are a lover of foreign films, then this is a good one to add
to your collection.",1373328000,,1955,4.314207650273224

7878562,5,6304872925,"CISKE THE RAT

(Holland, 1984) Director: Guido Peters. Cast: Danny De Munk, Willeke Van Amelrooy, Herman Van Veen, and Linda Van Dyck. Color. Running time: 107 Minutes. In Dutch with English subtitles. Unrated.

CISKE THE RAT, starring Dutch singing sensation Danny De Munk, is without a doubt one of the most touching childhood sagas ever brought to film. Living in Amsterdam in 1934, eleven-year-old Ciske (nickname for Franciskus) is a troubled kid caught in the winds of the war between his separated parents. His father, a mostly absent merchant seaman, is just not up to the task of raising this good-hearted, but rambunctious kid. Constantly in trouble both at school and in the streets, Ciske is most certainly on a collision course with disaster, unless the few adults who do care about him can prevail against overwhelming obstacles. Based on the bestselling book trilogy by Piet Bakker, CISKE THE RAT will make you laugh, cry, and marvel at how one young boy can so skillfully capture your heart, and have you wishing him miracles.",1157155200,2,1042,4.982758620689655
7878563,4,6304872925,"Ciske de Rat, is a Dutch movie starring Danny de Munk (Now a popular singer in the netherlands). Ciske is an 11 year old boy, that is mischevious, rude and violent. Yet he has a heart of gold. All he needs is to be listened to and understood. He gets little attention from his flirty mother and after one more argument, which results in Ciske killing her unintentionally in a fit of rage, Ciske is sent to a juvenile prison. When he is released, he goes back to live with his father and helps him to rekindle his romance with his former Fiancee. Ciske then makes amends in an unlikely way, for his crime, which left him hated by all. He saves someones life. Its a great film, well acted by everyone. Worth seeing. Danny has a great singing voice and personality. This film was and is very popular in the Netherlands, so Danny de Munk went on to star in a Documentary which saw him playing opposite his Ciske character.
Hope the review helped :)",973641600,,944,4.369318181818182
