8023760,1,B00028HBMU,"To be upfront - I used to ride motocross bikes - and now I'm 49, so I have both a past with these bikes and I'm older than most people into this now. I have about 4 other 'Crusty' DVD videos - and this one is the worst. I thought the 1st DVD was ok,  Crusty 2 & 3 were really good, but this one was a stinker. I kept the others and sold this one ""Global Assault Tour"" cheap to a store.
To be on here - I had to give a 'star' so I gave a one. I wish I could give it a 'zero'. I have another DVD ""Global Addiction"" that one is great! And ""199 Lives"" Pastrana - those are great! Problem I have with many 'Crusty Demons' - is what they call music - the films are worse than A.D.D. - I can keep up - I don't enjoy it.
sometimes they show people at foolish parties - tattoos and other foolish things.
I wish they'd just film the great stunts & crashes and not try to focus on the weird lives some have. I'd like to know HOW these stunts are done.
I also wish they'd have a separate audio track to hear the bikes and skip the 'music'.
Anyway - I'd say - just skip this DVD. Scott M.",1296172800,,1075,3.756637168141593
8023761,1,B00028HBMU,Do not buy this video! It is horrible. It is just a commercial for their tour. There is very little action sequences and most of them are from Crusty 1 and Crusty 2. I was very disappointed in this video. Don't waste your money like I did.,1168646400,,239,4.1063829787234045
8023762,1,B00028HBMU,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Crusty fan and have been buying the vids since Crusty 1. So I picked this up the other day and I can't deny that I was quite disappointed after watching it. It's basically nothing but an hour of interviews with a little spattering of jump clips interspersed throughout. Don't get me wrong - I like to see an interview here and there, but I like the interviews to be in between the jumps and not the other way around. Anyway, basically it is a big commercial for a ""Global Assault Tour"" that is supposed to be coming to the US soon (Summer 2004 would be my guess). They toured Australia first and that's where the little bit of footage comes from, which is all shot inside an arena with some pryotechnics and freaks thrown in for good measure. Maybe this would have worked better if they had shown the whole arena show, lightly edited, and then put the interviews in as an extra feature. But then I guess maybe they felt no one would go see it live if they saw it on the DVD... As it is, there's nothing on this vid that would really warrant releasing a movie. The extras are nothing special either - mostly just the raw interviews without cutting to the quick jump clips, a corny ""Moto-Sutra"" commercial, a clip of a yet-to-be-released Crusty videogame, and a short freeride around an Australian beach. All in all it just feels like maybe they are trying to come up with funding for the Global Assault Tour, which the DVD says costs 3 million dollars... I don't know, maybe if I had paid $6 instead of $15 I wouldn't feel ripped off....",1090281600,14,1579,4.374149659863946
