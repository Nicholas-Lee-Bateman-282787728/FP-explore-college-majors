8049068,3,B0007MTWFA,"This is the first volume of a five volume instructional video series titled Nihon Jujutsu by Norm Belsterling, a retired police officer who has applied his knowledge of Jujutsu in the line of duty.  Norm Belsterling has over 30 years of experience in the martial arts and has trained with well known martial artists as Fumio Demura, Dan Ivan, and Shizuya Sato.

The video starts out demonstrating basic warm up and stretching exercises to be done before practicing any martial art as well as basic jujutsu footwork and falling techniques for about the first eleven minutes.

This first volume of Nihon Jujutsu is subtitled, ""Joint Locks and Submissions.""  It should be called ""Transitions from one joint lock or submission to another.""  Norm Belsterling calls the viewer's attention to a particular joint lock or submission by mentioning its name before demonstrating it.  However, he actually performs a series of  2 or 3 joint locks or submissions out which the one he named is just one in the series that he performs as he makes transitions from one to another with smooth continuity of moves.  These smooth transitions from one hold to another are impressive means for a master to show off.  It does demonstrate a high level of skill to perform even with a rehearsed choreographed sequence and a cooperating partner.  But, it will be probably next to impossible and definitely and foolishly impractical to attempt such transitions once engaged in a real fight.  In a real fight you would want to take down your opponent and force him into submission quickly as possible with as little superfluous movement as possible.

Transitioning from one joint lock or submission to another is requires at least an intermediate level to advanced level skill.  If you don't already know the joint locks and submission holds demonstrated in this video volume, this volume is not going to help you learn them because there is not a lot explanation.  While there are a few slow motion demonstrations of the moves Norm is performing, a beginner is going to get lost by the time Norm makes his 2nd transitional move.  The rest of Norm's performance will flash past the beginning level jujutsu student's eyes without leaving a sign of comprehension about what just happened.

If you are an intermediate level student and already know a good number of joint locks and submission holds, you might want to buy this video to watch how Norm performs transitions from one hold to another.  Otherwise, if you are a beginner, then I would suggest that you start with Wally Jay's ""Small Circle Jujitsu"" video series instead because Wally Jay takes the time to explain everything before or as he demonstrates each move so you will learn something if you listen and pay attention.  Also, if you are a beginner, you can also buy the books ""Small Circle Jujitsu"" or Willy Lin's ""Chinese Grappling T'ien Shan P'ai Chin-Na: The Grappling Art of Self Defense, Volumes 1 and/or 2"" here on Amazon for a fraction what they cost elsewhere.  Those sources will give a good number of Joint locks and holds to learn for beginners.  After you have done that come back and look at this one again.

This video is just over 45 minutes long.
