8406538,5,B003VADRYC,"I have two kids (2011,2013) and they saw this movie on PBS and fell in love with it. I recorded it but caved in and bought the movie for my youngest birthday. He loves it so much that he wanted a Colossal Squid Theme birthday party. I will say for the young ones it is a little long, however my two young ones watch parts of it off to play then come back to it and we have watched it over 100 times. We also home-school and it has popped up many questions that we explore through out our lessons.",1469145600,2,496,3.97
8406539,3,B003VADRYC,"I was expecting a great deal about Giant Squid and got very disappointed by this film. You get some good facts about giant squids; but, I expected a great deal more and was somewhat dismayed by the film. Personally, I don't recommend it; but, some might enjoy it.",1353369600,3,263,4.5
8406540,1,B003VADRYC,"If you want to watch ""scientists"" capture, kill, and dissect an amazing Colossal squid, you'll love this film!

Personally I enjoy my nature alive and being carefully studied, but hey, science isn't ethics, right?  I mean, we can't all care!  That would be soo hard.  HAHAHAHA.",1319846400,5,277,4.956521739130435
