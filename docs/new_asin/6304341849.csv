847375,2,6304341849,"This restored version is not nearly as good as its hyped up to be. Sorry. It isnt. This movie is very dear and special to me. The VHS tape from the early 1990s was full of warm colors which created a very lovely Edwardian atmosphere. The 2004 DVD was superb and remains the top choice. In this latest restoration, the colors are washed out, and what another reviewer said is absolutely true: there is too much black. For example, we know from the original VHS tape that Denholm Elliots house lounging robe is a deep maroon, but its almost black in this restored version.  Many complexions are faded from flesh tones to gray.  The 2004 2-DVD set is the definitive version, and also includes many deleted scenes.

If the new version is a TINY bit crisper, its still not worth the sacrifice of the movies original warmth. This is a classic movie and did not need a restoration that did not improve upon the 2004 DVD transfer (which was excellent from the start). I can only recommend this as a second choice for those who don't have any copy of the movie at all, and cant find the out-of-print 2004 version.",1519516800,9,1104,4.482587064676617

Forester wrote (but never published) his novel as a ""hope for the future,"" after his lifetime, that gay people could simply find and live normal and happy lives.  The fact that this film was so faithfully crafted from his book, and has gorgeous (typical Merchant-Ivory) production values adds even more.  The bonus (second) Blu-Ray is also totally valuable and interesting.  My only beef?

847513,5,6304341849,"Just finished watching ""Maurice"" by the Cohen Media Group.
I can't help but wonder how E.M. Foster would have reacted to seeing his semi-autobiographical and unpublished during his lifetime novel of illicit homosexual love cutting across the rigid class structure of pre-World-War One British Society.
Not only was it bold for E.M. Foster to write such a novel, but - spoiler alert - he allowed Maurice [pronounced Morris] and Scudder to have a happy ending - no pun intended - which the movie faithfully adheres to.
""Maurice"" was a Merchant-Ivy production that was originally released in theaters back in 1987.  Though critically acclaimed, moviegoers weren't ready for a gay romantic movie featuring full frontal male nudity and naked men in bed - let alone a gay British romantic movie.
Adapted from the novel by James Ivory and Kit Hesketh-Harvey; ""Maurice"" tells the story of a quest for love and the longing to have someone to call your own despite the fact that society compels you to hide and make harsh choices you to protect yourself, your livelihood, and your family.
Exposure is always on the forefront of Maurice's thoughts.  Yet he is willing to risk all by moving forward towards his future.
""Maurice"" is a quietly compelling movie about giving up pretenses in order to find happiness.
Strongly Recommended.
Five Stars.",1509235200,3,1334,5.031674208144796

Hugh Grant stars in one of his early films, but the main credit should go to James Wilby for his excellent portrayal of a tormented man coming out of the closet in Victorian England and leaving class distinction behind in the process. This is an excellent high definition transfer of the 1987 classic. A must see! It was at the top of my wish list for DVD-films to make it to blu-ray!",1507248000,6,508,4.473118279569892
847621,5,6304341849,"What a beautifully rich film, with culture, deep soul and soaring love. Too many LGBT+ themed films are over-sexualized and poorly created, honestly. But this was such a well told story, with fantastic acting, top to bottom! The visuals are stunning to see as well. We watched this cinematic masterpiece, and totally forgot that it was created in the 1980s. There was nothing 'dated' about this movie, it is a classic period piece in all its glory. It was a total delight to see, and such a wonderfully full experience. So honest, so real and raw, yet tender and inspiring. A truly beautiful film. One of the best I have ever seen in gay cinema.

847623,5,6304341849,"I must have been living in a cave and didn't know it.  How did I not discover this movie before now?  I read and loved the book years ago. Was shocked and surprised to learn it was also a movie and even more excited when I saw the caliber of actors and the director.  It did not disappoint either.  Often when one reads and loves a book the movie is disappointing, but not so with this production.  The richness of the story of course is a great foundation and the delivery of the story in this film was excellent.  The acting, the music score, the scenes and setting, it all added up to a powerful and emotional cinematic experience.  If this sound a bit over the top you must recall that I LOVED the book.  So any decent conversion of it to a movie would win my approval.

As far as the story for those that don't already know, it's a classic love story as the Amazon description says.  Whats equally classic but rarely portrayed is a gay version of the classic story.  There are so many, perhaps too many cheap 90 minute gay films floating around.  Typically covering yet another teenage love story.  This one is not that same old storyline.  This is a love story for grown ups.  Life gets more complex as we move away from high school and college.  Being yet unmarried after a certain age you get no end of grief from family and friends.  This movie is for that crowd.  The social pressure.  The struggle with the loss of social status.  The fear of legal consequences just for opening loving the person that you love.  Adult stuff.  Its a painful story to watch, yet it brings life to the viewer as you see the story unfold.

So glad I found this movie even if it is 25 years after it was made.  The story is timeless. Definitely a keeper that Ill be adding to my library.",1506124800,22,1777,4.283132530120482

847740,5,6304341849,"Maurice is set amid the conformity of pre-World War I English society. Students Maurice Hall (James Wilby, Howards End) and Clive Durham (Hugh Grant, Four Weddings and a Funeral) find themselves falling in love at Cambridge. In a time when homosexuality is punishable by imprisonment, the two must keep their feelings for one another a complete secret.

After a friend is arrested and disgraced for the unspeakable vice of the Greeks, Clive abandons his forbidden love and marries a young woman. Maurice, however, struggles with his identity and self-confidence, seeking the help of a hypnotist to rid himself of his urges. But while staying with Clive and his wife, Anne, Maurice is seduced by the servant Alec Scudder (Rupert Graves, The Madness of King George), an event that brings about profound changes in Maurices life and outlook.

The film is based on the 1914 book by E.M. Forster (A Room With a View) that was suppressed for 50 years because of its controversial subject matter and was finally published in 1971, a year after Forsters death.

Director James Ivory believably portrays the inward struggle of two young men coming to terms with their homosexuality that puts them in conflict with their social class, the teachings of their Anglican background, the views of the medical profession at the time, and British law, which made them susceptible to blackmail as well as prison sentences.

Both Wilby and Grant are excellent and convey the omnipresent guilt their characters carry because of their homosexuality. The time period and its stringent codes of behavior and propriety are realized through a script that emphasizes how the two young men are torn between their passion and societal expectations.

Bonus materials on the 2-disc Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette; new on-stage Q & A with director James Ivory and cinematographer Pierre Lhomme; The Story of Maurice featurette; conversation with the filmmakers; deleted scenes and alternate takes with audio commentary by James Ivory; and original and 2017 re-release theatrical trailers.",1504656000,2,2073,5.231927710843373
847741,4,6304341849,"I was super excited to finally have ""Maurice"" on Blu Ray, but I'm not as thrilled, now that I have it. Cohen seems to have gone to every length to produce a pristine transfer, but I actually don't like the corrected version as much. The blacks are very milky and the highlights seem very slightly blown out in areas. I compared the new transfer side by side with the old DVD, and I prefer the DVD, even if it is, comparatively, over-saturated and crushed. It's my understanding that both the director and cinematographer approved this transfer, so I must assume this is the proper version of the film.
If you currently own the DVD, I would still recommend the upgrade, but be aware that they are subtly different.
The four star review is mostly for my aversion to milky blacks in the transfer...this is solidly a five star film.",1504569600,10,828,4.563758389261745

Ton of thanks to Cohen Media for finally give us the chance of owning ""Maurice"" gloriously restored. Already pre-ordered a copy but I must add that I totally dislike the artwork since it features Clive's character (Hugh Grant) over Maurice himself (James Wilby) which is totally ludicrous. The movie and novel are called ""Maurice"" not ""Clive""

In my opinion the Criterion Collection dvd artwork was a lot better and more accurate. For such joyous ocassion you should've done a much better job in the artwork area, at least including a picture of the complete love triangle, including the wonderful Rupert Graves (Alec Scudder)

847743,2,6304341849,"I'm going to try this review again since so many people have gotten bent out of shape by my next.  I've been accused to being anti-gay (Seth, Thomas Martin), of not knowing my field (MA in English Literature from the University of Pittsburgh, minor emphasis on the Bloomsbury group, to which Morgan Forster belonged).  The book is wonderful.  The book is inspiring.  The book was not published until after Forster's death in 1970.  When Maurice was written, around 1912, it was a mere 18 years after Oscar Wilde had been sentenced to two years of oakum picking in Reading Gaol (Jail) for having committed sodomy with numerous lower class individuals.  The ""love that dare not speak its name"" was a dangerous proposition then, and it still is in 2017.  The novel has a pure, poignant clarity that aches with the author's longing and desire.  The movie, however, is turgid.  It is slow.  It is pretentious.  It has none of crie de couer that the book contained.  Just because it is British, has lots of British stars, and appeals to the wanna-be's who never quite cut it in grad school, but think they should they should have just because they are gay, does not make it a good movie.

When this film was released, I went to the theater and saw it twice.  It came out on VHS I viewed it twice.  I own it on DVD and have viewed it more.  I have the two disc version.  There are interviews with Hugh Grant and James Wilby which are informative.  I recommend viewing the extras if you are able.

This film stands the test of time.  James Wilby, Hugh Grant and Rupert Graves performances were outstanding.  All of their careers were helped by their being in this fim, IMO.  How could these men have looked bad wearing the Edwardian wardrobe?

It was the first time I saw, in a film, two men having an understanding relationship with its ups and downs.  Heck yeah I cried along with Maurice when Clive leaves him to lead an inauthentic life.  What a real and heartfelt performance by James Wilby. I cheered at the happy ending when Maurice and Alec meet up and want to live together.  Fight the power Alec and Maurice.

Don't let my negative historical commentary dissuade you from seeing this. Its a beautiful story and the whole cast is great. James Wliby is amazing!

 James Ivory's Maurice (1987) is an example of subtle British stories which always tend to focus on idiotic, buffoonish aristocrats who lead spoiled, idle lives and are a complete bore. In the case of this film, it deals with the forbidden relation between men, one of whom is an upper class snob. That's not at all offensive, but the way the film crams it's monotonous and unnecessary message into our sympathetic eyes, it becomes tedious and rather quickly. There's no enduring his plight because he is so arrogant, and set in his ways of rigid family conformity and he's about as human as a pile of Welsh corn husks.

Maurice Hall (James Wilby) is the said character, who is not that bright but along with other British spoiled thugs, is attending Oxford, or some other chum school. He hangs out with a few other mugs, who guzzle beer, sing school songs and slap each other on the arse when in the shower. Eventually, he meets a new bore, Clive Durham (Hugh Grant) and his interest is ignited. They hang out, clasping each other and visiting quiet secluded lakes.

All seems fine until there is a change in Clive Durham's behavior. Maurice Hall is crushed over some time by his friend's denial of their true ""love"". It's obvious Clive Durham wants power and will marry a woman for fear of losing his land, titles, nobility, etc. so the story takes another turn, much in the way a soap opera would appear.

We pass through Maurice Hall's life, which is far from any ordinary working man's dilemma, as he travels, eats well and is afforded the luxury of the upper classes but he longs for more. It's exasperating as one would wish he would visit India and die of the plague or tuberculosis.

The film then strays further into the rubbish pit by placating Maurice Hall with an unbelievable love interest portrayed by an effeminate, no good, deceitful gardener, who I might add, looks quite clean and unburnt by the sun. Any intelligent viewer will probably either shudder or cringe at the simplistic derailment of the plot but it was obvious that James Ivory was tugging our emotional strings all along, following the clichd portrayal of social classes and making the love interest look like an underwear model.

There's no clear protest message, except to follow your ""organ down below"" and you'll be happy. If you expect any critique of the hostile social climate, look elsewhere, this is muddy melodrama at its most dense form.

See this film only if you want to believe in chimerical inspired fictional stories that are concocted and utterly delusional and preposterous.",1391385600,4,2616,4.772123893805309
848314,5,6304341849,"There are already so many reviews of this film here, so I just want to make the point that it is my favorite of the many wonderful films by producer Ishmael Merchant and director James Ivory. The acting is consistently excellent, the photography beautiful, and it has my favorite soundtrack by Merchant Ivory's in-house composer, the late Richard Robbins, who confided that this was his OWN favorite soundtrack of the many he composed. Because of the homosexuality, the book wasn't published until after the novelist's death and there was a time when many of us just assumed that it could never be filmed. So it was a shock when this team noted for ""A Room With A View"" and ""Howard's End"" and ""The Remains of the Day"" tackled it, and what a fine film they created! And I was delighted that it was handled in such a straightforward way, and am still startled by the big wet kiss that Rupert Graves plants on the face of James Wilby. It's always kind of odd seeing heterosexual actors trying to play gays, but Wilby and Graves are fine, as is Hugh Grant as the conflicted one who may or may not have sacrificed happiness to fit the expected heterosexual mold. What a wonderful movie! Incidentally, my second favorite Merchant Ivory is ""The Remains of the Day,"" and there's a fantastic Blu-ray of it!",1388188800,2,1297,4.619047619047619

The character of Scutter (the huntsman's son)is brought in late in the movie and actually only interacts with Maurice during a hunting scene and that is just words.  there is no show of the sexual tension that these tow men have for each other.  Scutter should have been introduced early in the movie and brought into more play with Maurice, still keeping the class distance.  Then at the great moment when they finally embrace each other the release of anxiety would have been better for the audience.
As it is Maurice and Scutter talk twice then wide up in bed. My impression to that was Huh? what happened.

848428,5,6304341849,"There are few movies of any genre that can hold my attention for 2 hours and 20 minutes, but this masterpiece of cinema is the epitome of everything I look for in a gay-themed film.  Here you find love, romance, self-denial, fear of social repercussions, beautiful young men in love, a few splashes of non-gratuitous frontal nudity, and a happy ending attesting to the power of love triumphing over all odds.  A brilliant British cast combined with a flawless story and resplendent cinematography and sound quality all contribute to the amazing impact this movie has had on me. I would describe this film as sort of a gay Downton Abbey with all the brilliance of the BBC Masterpiece Classic itself.

This film came out in 1987, when I was 23.  There were precious few gay-themed films available, and fewer that actually seemed to portray a real gay life - the ups and downs of growing up in a world that made life as difficult as possible for gay people, but showed the bright spots as well.  You can't choose who you love, even when society tries to force you into certain roles and classes.

This is a beautiful film, set in Edwardian England.  I love it!!!  Can't even tell you how many times I've watched it already.",1353024000,,753,4.246478873239437
848434,5,6304341849,"When this came out in theaters, I must have seen it half a dozen times... and that was when it was only playing in hidden away places, for special foreign films.  It was indelible to me at the time.  A recent re-viewing has really knocked me over, that I had forgotten so much, and re-enjoyed it all over again.

I don't know what these reveiwers are talking about with two discs and the like.
Unfortunately I had this version (the dark blue purple case, with Grant on the front), on the shelf for quite a few years still in shrink wrap.  When opened, it was only one disc, and I was very unhappy with the fuzzy film quality of the disc as a whole; but the story is still unforgettable, and remains perhaps the best of all films ever made on homosexual love. (None of the bodies are great; but the emotions are true and real.)

Maybe for some of you this seems a little dated.  But I am older, and still grieve for that youthful ""love lost"" because it was never found. Sorry, I don't value gay life and the gay world; and always wanted someone straight-acting and straight-appearing... not the circus I've seen that ""gay"" is.  Have experienced it all, and want no part of it.  Nothing honorable in it.  But strangely so many films do it that way, with straight-type characters; don't know why life seems that difficult to find and be made real as depicted therein.  But it seems it is. So you either accept less, and that's what you get... or go it alone.  No choice, really.

Brokeback Mountain was also exceptional, except for that first sex scene, which I never could agree with in the film; because that is not the prime focus of the way two guys make love.  In prison, maybe, and in porno films, but not in ordinary love relationships.  (Or with those I knew.)  But this is not a forum on techniques or preferences.  Just praise for a film well-made and sensitively rendered.

And Maurice is definitely a classic for the genre.",1347580800,3,1932,4.443181818181818
848435,5,6304341849,"As expected from personal knowledge of Forster's work, this is a sensitive, timely, even for today's standards, portrayal of homosexual Love, philosophical, psychological, and physical and is buoyed, by the sense of romance it should have.  The 2nd disc makes it even more interesting in determining how this was achieved.

As the truth and importance of this type of love works itself through the psyche of new generations in all the ways heterosexual love has, in the open and with considerations of genuine faith, and the truth of what is spoken of in religious communities within the considerations, especially of Biblical pronouncements, more and more, the world, I believe will see the distillation of love as simply love --  love which should be respected for what it is and not within shadows of what it ""should be.""  After all, the Biblical proscriptions and pronouncements describing ""abomination"" as the end all and be all in considering the validity of homosexual love refuses to recognize the fact that the ""Ten Commandments"" does not mention this love, and it is the constant position of the ""traditions"" of men which is put forth to decry and judge, without the nuance of discernment and personal choice, a choice which even God gives to humans, and this film elucidates just that.",1346889600,2,1296,5.013953488372093

By the first third of the movie, I had already fallen in love with the main character (Maurice) and by the end of the movie, I was left with a smile and a heartache at the same time. When compared to films like Brokeback Mountain, I found this film a much more accurate portrayal of two men struggling with their love for one another and that magical first time when their feelings are revealed. A scene where one the characters softly strokes the hair of the other was so much more intense and realistic than the explicit sex scene that served as the ice-breaker in the aforementioned film. I do think the alternate ending speech by Maurice in the deleted scenes would have made a better conclusion. But this film is a masterpiece none the less. I am curious how many other films on Amazon have 120 reviews and are completely void of any 1-star reviews (or 2-star reviews for that matter).

The company did justice by releasing this on two discs so the movie won't be plagued with compression problems once you squeeze the special features in. Seems great care was taken to release this particular version. My only question: where is the blu ray?

848577,5,6304341849,"Seriously!  Evocative, sad, hopeful and very thought provoking, it's one of those films that stays with you for a while.  Thank you, TCM and Merchant Ivory for introducing me to what is now one of my all-time favorite movies.

James Wilby is astounding as middle-class Maurice Hall in 1910's England, who falls in love with upper-class Clive (a baby faced Hugh Grant, who is brilliant in the role) during their years at Cambridge.  Clive's position and future expectations cause him to put the brakes on any physical relationship with Maurice, so they share a 'platonic' love for a couple of years.  Then, the imprisonment of a mutual Cambridge friend for 'public lewdness', e.g. homosexuality, causes Clive to break things off completely, leaving Maurice devastated.  Clive eventually marries, but keeps Maurice in his life on his terms, as a friend.  Maurice, however, still carries a torch for Clive.

On a visit to Clive's estate, Pendersley, Maurice becomes aware of the earthy, beautiful, lower class gamekeeper Alec Scudder, played by a radiant Rupert Graves (seriously, search for Alec Scudder on YouTube, and you'll be able to see him for yourself.  And then you'll thank me!).  Scudder's character starts out in Maurice's peripheral vision, sort of lurking on the edges, but then becomes a dominant force in the last third of the movie.  He approaches Maurice first, and totally turns his world upside down.  Not only was homosexuality a crime in those days, but a relationship with someone outside of your class was totally frowned upon.  These serious issues, plus Alec's plan to emigrate to Argentina, are overcome in the very moving end scenes.  So sweet!

I have to admit that I watched this movie after ""Room with a View"" jump started my Rupert Graves obsession, and I've been searching out as many of his films as possible since then.  Honestly, the man is truly gorgeous here, and he brings a tentative self confidence and abandon to the role of Alec Scudder that just makes you root for him.  Graves has only gotten better as he's gotten older; he has the ability to totally morph into a role and make it his own.

While there is a lot of male nudity (thanks again, Merchant Ivory!), the scenes are very tastefully done; nothing hardcore at all, but soft, thoughtful and romantic.  The DVD extras are great; over 30 minutes of extended scenes, a few of which flesh out Maurice's character a bit more, and a few more extended scenes of Maurice and Alec which I really wish had been left in.  There is also a great 'interview with the filmmakers', and a wonderful interview with the cast from, I believe, 2004, where they talk about their experiences making the film, a few witty anecdotes about collapsing beds and discussions they had about how to handle the love scenes (quite funny), and also, both James Wilby and Hugh Grant do a great James Ivory impression.

I can't remember the last time I saw this movie, but when I recently saw it again on TCM, I fell absolutely in love with it again. That last scene between Maurice and Alec Scudder in the 'Boat 'ouse' (the way Scudder pronounced it) would melt any romantic's heart and soul. It would be great to explore what happened to the couple after they expressed their devotion to each other: Where did they end up living? How did Scudder adjust to his new life, as well as Maurice?

848580,5,6304341849,"This is a very interesting follow-up to anyone who enjoyed ""A Passage to India"",  ""A Room with a View"" and ""Howard's End"". The news is that there is another film out there based on one of E. M. Forster's major books. ""Maurice"" has some very good actors (nice to see Hugh Grant taking on a role like this) and presents a view of the situation in the first half of the 20th century in terms of single-sex relationships. Of course, as with all real literature, the book/film is about much more, providing a picture of society at that time, and nicely showing how class borders were being crossed. In fact this film makes me want to read the book and read Forster's commentary in more depth. It's pretty obvious that parts of the story have had to be left out, including Forster's epilogue, in which he describes how the two men (the ones who have decided to live together) continue their lives.

There are some interesting contrasts between the two men who originally meet in Cambridge. The one who originally confessed his love goes for conformity and a prosperous, 'straight' life in the end, while the other chooses to go wherever his feelings take him. These were the options facing people like Oscar Wilde and A. E. Houseman, who present a similar contrast. Because of the sensitivity of this topic, the book wasn't published until Forster died - a fact that's very easy to forget these days, when there is little need to come out of the closet.

All in all, a great film, well worth watching.",1308873600,5,1495,4.591760299625468

848665,5,6304341849,"""Maurice"" is probably the finest gay-theme dramatic film made to date, with ""Mysterious Skin,"" a close second.  The DVD release by Merchant-Ivory does full justice to a very beautiful looking and sounding film.  Similar to other of Forster's works, it deals with the intersection of the social classes of England of the late 19th Century (Fin de Siecle).  I would not, at all, classify this as a ""gay"" film but as a superbly crafted drama dealing with a young man's attempting to deal with the anxiety and pressures caused by his emerging sexual feelings which he does not as yet understand.  The film successfully conveys the idea that sexual orientation is not something that a person chooses.  As has often been said: you don't choose it -- it chooses you.  In a scene in which Maurice Hall expresses his concerns to an American (curiously enough) psychoanalyst, he is advised that he might want to consider taking up residence in another European country in which homosexual behavior is not regarded as illegal.  As he says to Maurice: ""England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.""  In spite its central subject matter, this is a film that can be appreciated by all audiences.

It intelligently, movingly and, sometimes, quite provocatively follows the relationships that develop between the Aristocratic Clive Durham (whose family fortune may be running a bit thin), the Middle-Class and less sophisticated and worldly Maurice Hall and the working or serving class Alec Scudder.  All three characters are superbly portrayed by the male leads  and the remainder of the cast are excellent and totally believable.  As is usually the case with Merchant-Ivory films, ""Maurice"" looks as if it cost five times as much to produce as it actually did.  The beautiful music  score of Richard Robbins is at times lushly romantic and at other times conveys a disturbing undercurrent perfectly in keeping with the mood of the scene and the recording quality of it is all anyone could ask.

I won't spoil things by discussing the conclusion except to say that, for me, the very final brief shot says a great deal and can draw a tear.  It is sobering to consider that, within a short time after the conclusion of the story,  these three young men would probably be caught up and perhaps killed in the First World War.

This  magnificently photographed and recorded film deserves to be issued in Blu-ray.",1281830400,6,2408,4.930521091811414
848666,5,6304341849,"There's not much more to say about the excellence and sensitivity with which James Ivory brought Forster's posthumous-published autobiographical novel to fruition on screen. Merchant/Ivory films aren't known for action, rather sincere and severe character study. A gay male in Edwardian England was subject to excruciating horrors and humiliation; class was more important than anything. At the advent of DVD, I sold my VHS and waited for this 2-disc DVD, rife with extras and insight. When the film was first released, it won awards for James Wilby and Hugh Grant at both Venice and Cannes. This was the advent of Grant's career, and it seems he wasn't stigmatized by his choice of roles. Rupert Graves also gives fine insight into the development of his character, though he insists (maybe too much) that he's straight. ALL of the acting is pitch-perfect, perhaps one of the best ensemble casts I've seen; Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow, Billie Whitelaw, Judy Parfitt, Helena Mitchell, Ben Kingsley. All excellent. I was particularly taken by the brief appearance of Mark Tandy as Risley. He is actually the catalyst that drives Maurice to meet Clive. His subsequent situation creates great amounts of angst for all involved. If you're reading this, you probably know all this. I simply can't say how much I like this film. I was not a fan of ""Room With a View"" so this Merchant/Ivory film was a total delight, and the 3rd in the trilogy, ""Howard's End"" was excellent, too. Also, a happy ending to a frustrating and fearsome gay story in Edwardian England. I think it's Forster's wish for humankind. Food for thought, and hope...",1275177600,9,1630,4.9963235294117645
848667,5,6304341849,"The amazing thing about the Merchant-Ivory/Criterion Collection 2-disc Maurice DVD set is the Extras. (The same film was just re-released on DVD in the U.K. by Film 4 with NO extras.) The 12 deleted scenes are a revelation, ten of which have commentary by James Ivory. The interviews with Ivory, Wilby, Grant, Graves and others, reflecting back on the film, add perspective. Wilby left a stage performance and started filming Maurice within days, with few read-throughs. We learn that Julian Sands from Room with a View was supposed to play Maurice, but became unavailable. I, for one, am grateful.

Having seen the film before reading the book I was surprised to notice that the film episode with Risley being arrested is not in the book, but was deemed necessary to explain why Grant's character decides to ""go straight,"" and this is explained both in the DVD notes and in the Extras. In fact, the deleted scenes show that this subplot was taken even further, but then cut back. Also cut was a subplot involving Maurice's attempted seduction of a young houseguest. (The first cut of the film was three hours.)

The film has received typical Criterion Collection quality treatment from a high definition scan of the interpositive that was then digitally cleaned. However, there are no obvious digital artifacts introduced, unlike the Blu ray release of Gladiator. Maybe there will be a Blu ray release of Maurice from Criterion eventually. They have released a Blu ray of Howard's End.

This film directly followed Room with a View and is a suitable companion piece, though Maurice is darker. Rupert Graves, in the interviews, claims he apologized to Ivory for being so saucy in Room, but  was then put at ease when he was re-hired for Maurice.

I'm not sure how many times I've watched this movie since, but it's at least fifteen if not twenty. If, for the rest of my life, I were only allowed to watch five movies, this would be one of them. I never get bored with this movie because there are so many little details to notice and I find a new one almost every time. Every single element is well-done, from the acting to the sets to the costumes to the absolutely beautiful score.

I'm also impressed with the casting. James Wilby has the perfect blandly attractive look for Maurice, Forster's ""ordinary"" protagonist, but the pensieve emotion he puts into the character makes him anything but bland. Hugh Grant, in one of his early roles, displays the same ease in playing a sensitive snob that he has in some of his later films, but with none of the self-consciousness and manufactured charm that have marred much of his work over the last fifteen years or so. After a while I forgot it even was Hugh Grant. As for Rupert Graves, he inhabits his character with all the charm, roughness, and lack of inhibition required for Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper who proves to be Maurice's salvation. In the smaller roles, credit is due to Phoebe Nicholls, who plays Anne, Clive's wife, and Mark Tandy as Risley, Maurice and Clive's entertainingly pretentious friend from Cambridge.

""Maurice"" is a sweepingly romantic film about a man altered by love, propelled by his overwhelming passion from a state of unthinking and uninspired existence to depths of emotion that cause him to question everything he thought he knew about his place in the world. When we first see Maurice as an adolescent boy, his life appears to be already planned for him; he will finish his current school, begin a new one, grow up to become an Edwardian gentleman, and marry an appropriate young lady. ""I think I shan't marry,"" the young Maurice tells his teacher, Mr Ducie, who laughs it off as one of those ridiculous things children say. And indeed, when we see the barely-adult Maurice at Cambridge, his early thoughts of societal rebellion appear to have gone nowhere; he's an unremarkable undergraduate whose attempts at insight sound more recited than believed. Contrast the dull and inarticulate Maurice having dinner with the Dean to the bold, clear-thinking, defiant man of the film's last few scenes and the contrast is extraordinary.

The DVD extras are entertaining; I particularly enjoyed Rupert Graves's comment that, after the release of the film, he received an abundance of fan mail from Japanese schoolgirls.

Forster's novel was transferred into the screen with such adroitness that with the passage of time it rather increases its appeal.
We are transferred to the Edwardian England some years before the outbreak of the Great War. The main hero Maurice is an average student (it is funny to note that everybody including Maurice considers his studies a commendable pastime but generally a waste of time as he should go into business) who falls for a fellow student, an impoverished aristocrat Clive. Their romance is purely platonic which seems to suit Clive (who finally decides to change his minds and gets married which puts an end to their little fling) survives their Cambridge period but is clearly insufficient for Maurice. After failed attempts to cure himself of his illness (both medicine and hypnosis are used) he visits Clive in his estate and falls in love again - this time for a game-keeper. This love is consummated and provides an opening for a happy ending which neither Forster nor the movie does not really offer.

848776,5,6304341849,"Maurice, which is based on E.M. Forster's heartbreaking and beautiful semi-autobiographical novel of the same name is a wonderful Merchant Ivory productions.

James Wilby stars as Maurice, a young man at Cambridge who begins to develop feelings for his friend and fellow student Clive (Hugh Grant). The feeling turns out to be mutual and the friends soon fall in love with one another, but must keep their relationship secret because of the strict Edwardian society which they inhabit.

Clive maintains that the pair should keep their relationship purely ""platonic"" which Maurice accepts, despite feeling a need to seal their love physically. When Clive goes on a trip to Greece, he seems to snub Maurice and it soon becomes clear that he has different feelings about their affair.

Maurice is understandably heartbroken, but his ordeal is not over there. He soon discovers that Clive is engaged to be married to a woman named Anne. He is devestated. The question is, will he recover from the break-up and find love elsewhere or is he doomed to forever be without love in a society that does not accept people of his kind?

The film, which was directed by James Ivory, is a heartbreaking account of one man's struggle to accept his sexuality in a world that tells him that everything about his true inclination is wrong. It also highlights the plight of homosexuals everywhere who were forced to hide their identities because of laws against homosexuality in Britain and around the world.

The film is a joy to look at - the cinematography, the art direction and the costume design being a particular highlight - and is very beautiful, capturing the Edwardian period perfectly. James Wilby is excellent as Maurice and Hugh Grant performs well acting against type. Rupert Graves is wonderful in his supporting role as Alec Scudder, who may or may not prove to be Maurice's eventual saviour.

The actors inhabit their characters effortlessly and it is easy to feel sympathy for all of them in different ways - Maurice, Clive, Alec and even Anne, for that matter - which creates an emotional journey filled with both highs and lows.

MAURICE has long been one of my favorite movies . I have seen it so many times, but on this last viewing I was struck with something that had never occurred  to me before: I have for years worked among the VERY wealthy high society ""blue bloods"" in which many of the men I know marry because it is the socially acceptable thing to do, denying their own sexual orientation. Often these men live secret lives and are completely miserable for fear of social ostracizing and disinheritance! MAURICE may be an  Edwardian English Period Piece to some, but trust me, the same old stuff keeps going on and on in America as I write. Ben Kingsley as The Doctor states, "" The English have never been inclined to accept human nature.""  The story of MAURICE is timeless,especially for cultures that are inclined to be of English heritage.

MAURICE (pronounced MORRIS) ,IMO, is the finest Merchant Ivory film ever done. The story line and acting is rock solid.;the tension and struggle is palpable;the costumes and cinematography are impeccable;and the revelations about the ""upper-crust"" are insightful and true. James Wilby, Rupert Graves and Hugh Grant are heartbreakingly convincing as the three principles in this human drama of sexual and class struggle.

848779,5,6304341849,"Sometimes the best adaptations are those which do the least amount of adapting. That is, they more or less just put the dialogue as it is in the book onto the screen. In that respect, the novel by E.M. Forster must be a director's dream, because the dialogue is sharp and already reads like a script (a bit like ""Brideshead Revisited"" by Waugh). And I am glad to say, this minimal approach is what Merchant/Ivory used here, so almost all the best scenes in the novel are also in the movie (and the rest are in the  deleted scenes, which are also included on the DVDs).

""Maurice"" has often been called a lesser work by Forster, likes Gide's ""Corydon"" a mere effort to justify the author's homosexuality. However, while the topic was obviously important to Forster, the novel does not sacrifice style for message. The overall construction of plot and characters is very clear and straightforward and less flowery than his other novels. When his other books are heavy in ""female dialogue"", this one ultimately maintains that deeds are more important than words (and in fact Maurice says so in the beginning), and that physical love is more worthwhile than the upper-class discussing how the have a piano removed from under a crack in the ceiling. So in a way ""Maurice"" satirizes Forster's earlier works, and maybe that is why many Forster fans don't seem to like it.

I was initially a bit apprehensive about the choice of cast, since Wilby does not exactly look like I imagined the character from the novel and Graves is a bit too much the 1980s pretty boy to be believable as the rugged groundskeeper. Also, Grant has been mostly playing annoying roles ever since the ""Four Funerals..."", so I was not expecting much of him here. But fortunately, the performances are all very good and -- in the case of Grant -- almost make you forget all the low-quality movies he has been in since.

When I picked this title up I did not even realize it was from the Criterion Collection (it is only mentioned in tiny type on the back cover -- why?), so you actually get two DVDs, one with the movie, the other with extras. The transfer looks exquisite and really brings out the cozy interiors as well as the rainy and foggy outdoors (again, comparisons to the ""Brideshead Revisited"" adaptation with Jeremy Irons seem apt, and besides Phoebe Nicholls also stars in that).

The predictable extra features are present, like interviews and deleted scenes. You can tell the interviews were filmed with an American audience in mind when the three principal actors endlessly go on about how _they_ themselves are completely heterosexual (only Graves allows for a streak of bisexuality) and how difficult it was to do the love scenes.

This reminds me of the coverage of ""Brokeback Mountain"" -- apparently you can only make a film with gay themes for Americans if you assure the audience that (a) the actors are straight and (b) they absolutely had no fun at all when filming the intimate scenes. It makes you wonder who is more emotionally stunted, Edwardian England or modern America.

But that aside, the deleted scenes are all very interesting and I wish they would have remained in the movie. So did Ivory himself in his commentary. I  would like to know why directors always like to cut 20-30 minutes from their movies only to later complain that they should have left the material in in the first place.

One of the things that is gone is the part when Maurice, in a sort of sexual frenzy, mounts a probably ill-advised seduction attempt on Dr Barry's 16-year-old nephew Dickie. Perhaps it is understandable this was left out, although this might have made Maurice's character a bit less angelic and more well-rounded. But it would also have been an easy target for detractors of the movie.

While it was a better idea to tell the first have half of a movie _not_ in a flashback as in the rough cut, we are missing some little moments here and there, such as when Maurice sees Alec flirting with some of the housemaids. A minor touch, but a reminder that Alec, like perhaps many members of the working-class, should really be considered bisexual. That is, his sexual orientation is not a conscious matter of inquiry of him, he just does what seems to feel right at the moment. That is of course also why a homosexual fling with Maurice is not a big problem to him.

Perhaps the main problem with the movie is that we see too much of Alec too soon, and from his point-of-view (e.g., the camera is behind his back when he is first seen stealing some pastries from a coffee table). In the novel,  more distant glimpses of Scudder are gotten from Maurice's POV, who vacillates between attraction and disdain for him as a member for the lower classes.

The moment where Alec climbs into Maurice's bedroom is also not as well handled as in the novel -- in the novel Maurice calls out into the night (at no one in particular), only to have Alec appear on the ladder, which is more surprising and romantic. In the movie, we see Alec watching Maurice from the park as he climbs out the window himself and rocks the ladder. The surprise is spoilt, because we identify at that moment more with Alec than with Maurice.

Another change from the book concerns Clive's sudden motivation to ""become"" heterosexual. In the movie, an Oscar Wilde-like trial takes place that scares Clive into mending his ways. Then again, I always felt that Clive's 180 turn is actually quite easy to understand, because there really is no change at all: In the beginning, he effuses about Platonic love, which to him is an idea, not a physical reality. In the second half, he is equally exuberant about marriage, but again more as an idea than something sexual (his wife does not look like she gets much sex, or even expects it from her husband). Clive and Maurice are vastly different in that regard -- to Clive love is an idea, separate from reality, while to the less intellectually inclined Maurice it cannot be divorced from sex. And that is why their relationship goes nowhere.

But those are really only minor quibbles. All in all this a sumptuous adaptation of a well-conceived novel. Some adaptations change the plot or dialogue for no reason and make you wish that they had simply stuck to the source, but this one is smart in that it lets Forster's writing, its beautiful photography, and its evocative, wistful score speak for themselves.",1186099200,15,6400,4.671403197158082

This movie is really about risking everything we know for what we believe in with no guarantees for a happy ending.

848871,5,6304341849,"One of the other reviewers of this film mentioned that this was important to them when they were struugling with issues relating to their own sexuality. I too have a belief that most lesbian and gay people have either a film or a book that is important to them in their formative 'coming out' stages - Maurice was mine. I sneaked into a late night showing in central London with the woman who was, and still is my best friend: and at that time there was no way it was going to be screened in working class South London where we were from.

Essentially the film covers the gradual 'awakening' of Maurice (played by James Wilby) to his true - gay - self starting in his late teenage years and ending sometime one supposes in his mid-twenties. Maurice is from an upper-middle class family and is exposed to all the privileges that go with being from that background. At university he meets Clive (Hugh Grant), an intense, intelligent and handsome young man from the landed gentry. After a few clumsy blunders and misunderstandings the two embark upon a secret relationship (well it has to be). Clive though is unwilling to partake in a sexual aspect to the relationship - thinking that it would 'bring them down'.

After several years of a close, but sexually unfulfilling relationship a mutual aquaintance of Maurice and Clive is caught soliciting a soldier outside a pub. At the subsequent trial he is essentially stripped of the reputation, career and status he enjoyed as a member of the upper class. This is a turning point in the relationship between Maurice and Clive, and Clive calls an end to the relationship in a particularly emotional sequence. Maurice gets on with life, existing from a day to day level, but emotionally his life is barren.

Sometime later - one assumes a year or two has passed with no contact, Maurice receives a phone call from Clive who has an announcement to make. Clive and Maurice are reunited - platonically - but not reconciled. While staying at Clive's country estate he meets Alec Scudder, the under-gamekeeper, a bit of rural, working-class, rough trade who fulfills Maurice in the way Clive never did. The remainder of the film deals with Maurice and Clive dealing with new states of affairs and has as much to do with issues of classism as it does with homosexuality.

The ending scene of the film for me is the most powerful - combined with the evocative music and the symbolic closing of the shutter windows it is very movingly done and always brings a lump to my throat whenever I watch it. Clive and Maurice bring a finality to their relationship at all levels, neither seems happy or satisfied, it seems that happiness for both hangs by a thread. Clive has sacrificed complete fulfillment in order to safeguard his position and wealth, Maurice has sacrificed position and wealth in order for a fulfilling relationship.

Rent it, buy it, watch it once every 5 years or so when it appears on Channel 4. You may find it refreshing to see gay men who are not drag queens or dying of and HIV related illness or drugged-up, club bunnies.",1162425600,11,3077,4.669741697416974
848872,5,6304341849,"This is a beautifully crafted film, right up there with most other Merchant/Ivory productions. The sense of time and place, the performances, the lyrical mood, the music--all are far above the usual standards of ""commercial"" filmmaking. E.M. Forster conveyed a powerful message in his novel, and it's right there on the screen. Still....

NOTE TO SCREENWRITERS (with spoilers): As a writer, I was most fascinated by the deleted scenes included with the DVD. There are 2 in particular that I really think Ivory should have kept in the final cut. Watch the film, then watch the deleted material. I'm referring to the scene where Hugh Grant comes to James Wilby's bedroom, and especially the extended version of the final scene between the two on the terrace outside the house. The first scene tells us a lot we really should know about Grant's character. The extended final scene is most important: It is here (in the outtakes) where Maurice (Wilby) has his only moment of strength and resolve. He finally tells his tormentor exactly where to get off the train, and he grows immeasurably in the estimation of the audience. Grant reacts with (momentary) guilt, and when he tries to cover by heartily suggesting the usual lunch in town, Wilby is gone. Grant is left alone on the terrace, calling, ""Maurice? Maurice?"" into the empty dark. Now, *that's* an exit for the title character! And it really drives home the power of the (included) final image of Grant in his bedroom later, staring out the window while his clueless wife continues to be clueless in the background. If we'd seen the earlier incident in Maurice's bedroom and the full-length final confrontation, how much more powerful that last image would be! Why, oh why did Ivory cut them?!! See if you agree with me.

That aside, this is a remarkable film, one of the few major releases to face a difficult subject head-on (see also: SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN). But those outtakes are extraordinary--a lesson for screenwriters.",1151193600,29,2002,4.937685459940653

I will say this; in this year of the GREAT ""Brokeback Mountain"" and everyone talking about straight actors now being unafraid to play a Gay character we must not forget the  superb preformances of the three leads, especially the brilliant and devastating performance by Rupert Graves in this film which was made almost 20 years ago and please let's not forget the electrifying and Oscar winning performance of William Hurt in ""Kiss of The Spider Woman"" back in 1985. By the way, why isn't ""Spiderwoman"" out on DVD?",1139875200,13,654,4.637931034482759
848875,5,6304341849,"It is difficult to speak of a classic and this film is one. E.M. Forster is also an English writer who has tact and some natural nobility. He makes radiant any subject he touches. And this subject is delicate if not difficult. It was when the book came out and it still was when the film came out. Nowadays it has lost its smell of sulphur and hell and in spite of all the tricksters and mud-throwers around it smells of love and it carries a strong appeal for those who just have a mind.

We cannot avoid thinking of Lady Chatterley's Lover but we are no longer dealing with a woman but with a man, with straight love but with gay love and it is necessary to give a general idea of the story for any commentary to make sense. It starts at Cambridge when two young men fall in love, Clive declaring his love to the other and this other, Maurice, being repulsed at first and then apologizing and accepting his attraction. The point is that the one who declared his love first is the aristocrat whereas the other is from a stock exchange family. And that's the latter's first loss. He is cleanly and immediately kicked out of Cambridge because he missed a few classes to spend the afternoon with Clive and refuses to apologize to the Dean.

But another of their university mates, Viscount Risley, managed to get in some kind of fix in an East End pub one night when he buys some quick pleasure from a cadet in a back alley. He is ""captured"" by the police and dragged to court. This Viscount is a Parliamentary Private Secretary and is at the start of a political career. He is abandoned by every one, including Clive, and the judge condemns him lightly as for the prison term but ruins his political career forever with the clear mention that ""instead of setting an example to the people"", he looked for favours from people who were his ""inferiors"" and he used his advantageous superiority in education to do so.

This reveals the deeply social segregational attitude of England then. The social difference made such a relationship unacceptable to justice with a strong emphasis on this social  barrier that the culprit dared cross.

That makes Clive change his position entirely. He decides to drop Maurice, apart from a platonic friendship and to marry a girl who is full of love but not too subtle on the real emotions of her husband. This rebuff from Clive sends Maurice to hell and he tries to find a way out with doctors and even a hypnotist who comes up with the fair advice to move to a country like France where homosexuality is accepted. And his conclusion is final: ""England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.""

But in the meantime Maurice falls in love with Clive's gamekeeper, Alec. In fact it seems the gamekeeper smelled the possible emotional opening in Maurice and Maurice did not rebuff him and then Alec moved forward and Maurice let him do so. The love is strong but Maurice is afraid of some blackmail, and yet he goes on as far as possible before Alec leaves England for Argentina. But Maurice will find out the ship leaves without Alec and he will run back to Clive's place and will subodorate that Alec is waiting for him in the boathouse and sure enough here he is.

The first element is that E.M. Forster's novel was one essential milestone on the slow and long road that led England to two fundamental mental reforms. The first one has to do with gay love and England was not the first country to move on such a subject after WW2 but in fact they moved rather fast though they still have some way to go. But the second mental reform is far from being complete. It is social segregation. In 1910-1913 when the action takes place that social segregation is absolute: the relation, between the aristocracy and the lower classes were absolutely not acceptable in any way, particularly of course emotionally, sentimentally or sexually. D.H. Lawrence had proved it with his above-quoted novel for women and E.M. Forster proved it with this here novel and film.

The arguments emphasized by the judge are absolutely univocal: a member of the nobility could not in any way have any kind of an affair with someone from a lower social station. The fact that at the same time the Anglican church and the society as a whole condemned gay love and gay sex as immoral and un-natural if not anti-natural, does not in anyway alleviate the horror of that social discrimination in people's sentimental, emotional and sexual private lives. And at the same time it is this very fact that this social discrimination is a lot more powerful than the moral condemnation that gives Maurice and Alec a possible choice, a possible chance.

Alec could miss his ship because he wanted to stay with Maurice, that was his free choice, and Maurice could run after him blindly because he wanted Alec to stay and be part of his life, and that was also his free choice, and that is in a way possible for them both because Maurice is working at the Stock Exchange, in a brokerage house and he is not in anyway part of the nobility and aristocracy. That's their chance and Alec could become in a way or another some employee of Maurice's and then the rest was discretion and love. And eventually they could move to another country.

But this film, like Lady Chatterley's Lover, should be shown to all teenagers and discussed with them for them to come to the feeling, the empathy that social segregation is absurd. You love someone for so many reasons that any segregation has no sense, and you can love someone in so many ways, sex being one of the ways and in no way obligatory or necessary, that any segregation is idiotic. No one should question who other people love nor how they love the people they love, not to mention the people they want to marry.

848877,3,6304341849,"A very detailed and beautiful/refined looking show with good themes on gay love, conformity and class differences and well acted characters but a large deal is assumed that the viewer will know or will get without proper dramatization of those points or, in some cases, even mentioning them or showing background. Some statements/acts seem to come out of nowhere or aren't shown what's their significance. As the film progresses however and characters become more honest and open things become alot better for the viewer and the characters and story improves. The powerful values of love and honesty shine forth.

I think most of this assumption is that you have read the book. For someone that has there is probably no issue, but for anyone who has not, the average viewer, the assumptions very much detract from the enjoyment of this beautiful flim.

Hugh Grant actually gives a riveting performance as a closeted upper-class homosexual, and he does so without the slightest ounce of cuteness (a quality that always annoyed me in his American film appearances).  James Wilby more than holds his own as the title character, and his unpolished good looks makes him a sympathetic and identifiable figure.  Rupert Graves, on the other hand, almost steals the entire movie.  It would have been easy to cast him as the typical lower-class bloke with one-sided motives, but this film gives his character so much depth that you cheer for him almost as much as the title character.  The settings are excellent, and they really reflect the inner conflicts within each character's psyche.  I like this film more than other gay-themed films because it showed a longing for intimacy, rather than a need for sexual immediacy.  While the film can be criticized for including some male nudity, it was actually captured tastefully, and treated as a natural (rather than strictly erotic) occurrence.  I recommend this film to those who are new to the gay-themed film genre, as it shows not only a different chapter in gay world history, but also how the genre itself has evolved.",1122422400,8,1264,4.985714285714286

Everybody goes on and on about how wonderful this film is, but I guess lots of people have exceptionally high tolerances for irritating period pieces where each character is dressed perfectly in perfect period clothes in perfect period settings, rooms, and buildings.  Add to that a generous helping of nauseau-inducing pompous, spoiled upper-class pettiness that leaves you with a profound sense of the emptiness of most of these characters and the distaste of the working-class folks who serve their needs.

Alas, they just don't make movies like this anymore.  Simply put, if you've read the original book, you know that the acting, casting, cinematography, music, writing, and directing all come together to form a perfect piece of art that has the power to change lives.

This is the best movie depiction of the psychological journey of a gay person's accepting his or her true nature.  I want to defend the ending of the movie and book to those who say it's unrealistic (don't read the rest of this review if you haven't seen it!)

Forster himself said in the afterward to the novel that he partially based the final relationship of Alec and Maurice on a gay couple he knew who had been together for many years in Edwardian England - so two men staying together was not unheard of at the time.  Those who say that Maurice and Alec could not stay together because of their social class differences are guilty of the same classism that Forster was speaking out against.  Alec was obviously very intelligent despite his lack of education.  Maurice could provide some education to Alec to expand his knowledge (as was hinted at in the British Museum sequence).  There were certainly things that Maurice could learn from Alec - for example ""not letting your head go under when swimming"" - a metaphor for Alec's more comfortable expression of his sexual feelings.

Where two young men, separated by social and economic class, risk peer status and individual reputations when the flesh's unforgiving and burning truth strips them indistinguishable from the raw primal animal of human desire, where human drama and vulnerability either entombs one to an eternal Hell on Earth or releases one so that one may finally stand fully erect and human.

I think every gay man must see himself in one of these three gay characters. The struggle to extract one's self from the raging, roaring river of life's absolute indifference to the happiness and well-being of the individual, no matter what species, is the fate of every living, breathing human being. Being gay is just one more snag. Just another twist and turn of circumstances and conditions to challenge.

Filmed in the tradition of English good taste and esthetics, one is easily mesmorized by the beauty of every scene, the young men and their families. You can't help but want to be a part of their lives. You can't help but want to bring our modern attitudes and perspective to their seemingly unnecessary maze of darkness and desperation.

Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves and James Wilby each do a convincing and outstanding job. Three straight actors who perform with the strength and sensitivity necessary for a gay man to be convinced that they 'must' be really gay. For they reveal us so well.

It doesn't matter if you are [...] or straight - against your will, scenes and images from the film will replay in you mind, stay in your heart and affect your mood and feelings (for days, in my case - which is not a good thing because I have a major examination coming up and half my mind is still on ""Maurice""!). At times, I wished I was born male like the characters, and have the privilege of a Cambridge education... pure wishful thinking (though I've a girl friend who got into Cambridge on a scholarship, to my eternal envy really).

This film is a faithful adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel and brilliantly brought to life by the winning team of Merchant Ivory. The stellar cast comprises James Wilby, Hugh Grant and Rupert Graves; all 3 share great screen chemistry and there is no doubt that the actors gave it their ""all"" for this film.

This is the story about one man's journey of self discovery on his sexuality and having to live with the prejudices of the times including class distinction (which balks at intimacy with a social inferior, in this case Maurice's desire for Alec). Many reviews have already been written about the story so I would just like to share some of my thoughts and observations of the film:

1) the DVD (R1, released Feb 2004) is beautifully packaged and is chockful of special features including more than 10 deleted scenes, one of which is a most sensual scene involving Maurice and Alec (an ""extended"" scene of their first night together). The production notes/booklet also provides a treasure of information on the film.

2) James Wilby plays ""Maurice"" most beautifully and sensitively. He is imperfectly handsome but is still very attractive-looking. The thing that strikes me most about Wilby's ""Maurice"" is that he has the MOST beautiful hair color - it's practically ""golden"" - not the usual blonde. The color contracts nicely with the black suit he usually wears. In the novel, Maurice has dark hair, but I think a golden-haired Maurice is just perfect - a great contrast too to Clive's and Alec's dark locks!!

3) Clive (Hugh Grant) is a year older than Maurice. When they get together, Maurice is about 21. By the time they break off, Maurice is nearing 24. Nothing is mentioned in the book/movie about Alec (Rupert Graves)'s age - but I gather he is the youngest of the three (although most certainly the lustiest!!).

4) Maurice's character is passionate, loving, vulnerable and super-loyal. If Clive had not rejected him, Maurice would have been ""his for life"". What's with Clive anyway? He's got this idea that a relationship between 2 men should be strictly platonic - no kisses or caresses, even. (If I'm Clive, I don't think I'll be able to keep my hands off Maurice!). Thank goodness for the appearance of Alec later on, who is Clive's very opposite!

5) In the story, Maurice is horrified by his lust for and intimacy with Alec, who is only a servant. But one reason they are perfect for each other is because (in E.M. Forster's words): ""chance had mated it (i.e. Maurice's body) too perfectly"". The 2 characters' growing feelings for each other are a joy to watch.

6) For those who question the ending i.e. whether it is even possible for Maurice and Alec to stay together what with all the difficulties surrounding them, well, let me write that Forster intended the ending to be a happy one (and who would know better than the author himself?). In the ""Terminal Note"" at the end of his novel, Forster wrote: ""A happy ending is imperative. I shouldn't have bothered to write otherwise. I was determined that in fiction anyway two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows, and in this sense Maurice and Alec still roam the greenwood..."" Super, isn't it?

I don't want to forget this beautiful movie, and I can't forget it anyway. It is quite simply the most touching film I've ever seen. It deserved an armful of Oscar awards especially a Best Actor nod for Wilby (although in reality the film didn't do that well, receiving only Best Art Direction and Best Costume nominations). I've seen most of Merchant Ivory productions and ""Maurice"" is hands-down, the BEST. Don't miss it!",1088812800,33,4584,4.712858926342072

For those who will surely find it entertaining, there's a very nice EASTER EGG on this DVD:
Go to Disc Two--select Deleted Scenes, page 2--select ""May I ask you name?"" and then right-arrow. A small icon will appear in the lower right hand corner of your screen. Click on that and enjoy  a hidden deleted scene.",1088467200,42,461,4.423529411764706
849069,4,6304341849,"Sandwiched in between the two better-known Merchant-Ivory adaptations of E.M. Forster classics ('A Room With A View' and 'Howard's End') this wonderful film may have been lost in the popular shuffle. However, it has remained a cult classic since its release in 1987, and has merited this fine DVD adaptation, long awaited by fans of the film, and a great place to start for those who are just discovering the film.
It still remains an amazing feat that this beautiful, lyrical film was made on such a relatively small budget. Although critically lauded and, of course, with a large following of loyal fans, its subject matter (and the subject matter of the original book) are still cause for alarm, and lack of box office. Although things may have changed since the turn of the last century, it is clear that they haven't changed as much as it would seem.
While the film on the first disc remains the same as the original release, the disc of extras is worth the cost of the DVD. There are some very intriguing deleted scenes, which contain a completely different take on the basic story in the film. There are interesting interviews with director James Ivory and sceenwriter Kit Hesketh-Harvey. But, the best part of the extras are the present-day interviews with the principal actors, James Wilby, Hugh Grant, and Rupert Graves. They give a very good insight into the making of the film, and their interpretation of their characters. Of course, the inevitable explanation of ""I am not gay but I play one in the movie"" comes up with the three actors, it seems that Hugh Grant is the most respectful and unbothered in his answer. This may be a result of his ensuing fame, or his infamous status as a heterosexual, but it's nice to hear an actor not being defensive about playing a gay character for a change.
I highly recommend this DVD, even for people who already have the video, because the extras are well worth owning the DVD.",1087603200,8,1931,4.699115044247788
849183,5,6304341849,"Fans of Merchant Ivory's A Room with a View will find similarities here, in style and sensibility as well as the casting of secondary characters.  This can be distracting if your first thought upon seeing Denholm Elliott is ""Mr. Emerson!"" but also lends a depth of place to the film.  After all, both Maurice and A Room with a View were written by E.M. Forster; it's appropriate that some of the same faces should populate the world of both films.  And certainly, after watching Rupert Graves as Alec Scudder climb in through Maurice's shadowed window, I'll never see Freddy Honeychurch the same way again.
The most surprising and poignant performance of the film, however, belongs to Hugh Grant as the aristocrat who chooses society over love.  After seeing Grant play nothing but cads and floppy bumblers (and play them well), I was astonished that he could convey sincere affection for another man as well as all the subtleties of Clive's struggle to deny his love for Maurice.  It's a shame he's been cast in so few dramatic roles since this film.
But aside from the context of the film and the skills of the actors, this is a touching, gently rendered story of a young man's growing acceptance of himself, and the joy that can come from choosing love over material wealth and status.  In that sense it's as universal as any other romance and can - should - be enjoyed by anyone who views it with an open mind.",1086220800,7,1414,4.636

I was shocked when I bought this(at the ridiculous price of $Aus9.99)to see a faded print in full frame and not particularly good sound and no extras. This new American release is like another world. Glorious to look at and with a whole second disc of special features (including a whole section of the movie in deleted scenes that was removed from the final cut). The interviews with the three actors are informative and intelligent. Rupert Graves is certainly one of Britain's finest and he hardly looks any older!!(why???how???) The deleted scenes do reconstruct a rather confusing opening sequence with a plotline that would be exorcised from the final film and it is easy to see why. These scenes that have been cut are quite erotic at times. There is also a bedroom scene between James Wilby and Hugh Grant, which is not sexual, but underscores the drama of the piece beautifully. Surely the best film Merchant Ivory ever made, now in all its glory at last. Beware of the earlier DVD release and grab this one as fast as you can.",1084838400,11,1233,4.712962962962963

James Wilby plays the title character honestly and with dignity as he searches for love, falling for a good friend ,Clive, (played by a young Hugh Grant) and eventually following his heart and falling for a young man of a lower class.  ""Maurice"" and ""A Room With a View"" are great companion films and well worth an addition to your personal library.

849186,5,6304341849,"This is the story of the love that dared not speak its name during the time it couldn't speak.  Maurice is the title character of an E.M. Forster novel that Forster himself opted not to have published until after his death, due to the content.
James Wilby and a then-unknown Hugh Grant star in this fabulous Merchant-Ivory production, that carries with it all the hallmark opulence that Merchant-Ivory are known for in other films such as 'A Room with a View' and 'A Passage to India' -- the music is impressive if understated, the characters superbly played by the actors (look for Simon Callow, himself a gay actor, as one of the innocent Victorian onlookers, and Ben Kingsley as a rather interesting character, one of the early psychologists to attempt to engage in what is today called reparative therapy).
Maurice (Wilby) is trying to come to terms with being gay in his college days in late Victorian England.  Clive Durham, a young man of property (Grant) has done the ""gay"" thing in college, but decides at some point that his station in society is more important, so he does his best to repress his true feelings, which leads to regret.  Is this the same regret Forster had during his lifetime?  My favorite line from the whole film has to be the psychologist Kingsley, who says the English have always been ""disinclined"" to accept human nature.
The film does have a moral, but not one that hits you over the head.  In the end, this is a love story, although not the kind you might expect, and we are left with an ambiguous ending, just like Forster's novel.
The DVD has many extras, including deleted scenes, a reconstructed beginning, interviews with actors and production figures, and is re-done for the DVD with a stunning transfer.

849188,5,6304341849,"Other reviewers have commented on the details, and very well, so I feel like commenting on the social framework where this movie was made.  It will probably seem incredible to humans of the future, but there was indeed a time when love was confined to members of the opposite sex.

That is to say, whenever we discovered that two people were in love, our FIRST QUESTION was to inspect their gender.  If the genders were different, then clear sailing lay ahead.  If the genders were the same, then obviously the lovers needed to be taken out and shot.

This film, ""Maurice,"" comes from the novel by E. M. Forster, who avoided the penalty of being taken out and shot by his extreme discretion -- including, among other things, NOT publishing this novel until he was dead.

Think about this.  Meditate on this.  One of the best writers of the last century decided that the world could simply not accept his tale of love.",1080086400,3,917,4.58282208588957

This movie haunted me long after I saw it when it was released, and it's just as haunting now. The performances are simply grand. I wish Hugh Grant would do a dramatic role again to get rid of his mannerisms. Wilby is particularly fine, when you consider this was his first film. I've never seen Graves give a bad performance. I'm so glad to see this on DVD. Would this film be a bigger hit in the theaters if it were released now? I think so.",1079136000,12,683,4.60655737704918
849191,5,6304341849,"I first became aquainted with this movie one night while doing the old channel surfing thing. I happened to land on a scene from a movie in which a man is lying in bed, tormented over something. He then moves to a window, to view the outside darkness. Not seeing anything, he returns to his bed, only to look back at the window, to view the house gamekeeper climbing up a ladder for an illicit rendez-vous. I was mesmerized, closeted, and seeing for the first time a depiction of love between two men. Thus I sat enchanted watching ""Maurice"", created from the magnificent Merchant Ivory studios.
Maurice is based from an E. M. Forster book posthumously published due to its scandolous nature. Maurice, brilliantly portrayed by  is a man torn between his role in society and his inner feelings. At Cambridge, he meets Clive Durham, played by a young dashing Hugh Grant, who becomes his first great love. Turmoil and tumult ensues, as the men wrestle with their love for each other versus society expectations. As Clive gives into the pressure, Maurice is sent wandering with his feelings, until he meets the saucy, somewhat illiterate gamekeeper Scudder, played by Rupert Graves, which only fuels the dichotomy.
Never pandering to audiences, this film respects the story and its characters. They are equally rich and complex, as the giant behemoth of society constantly dictates what they must do or accept of each other. Yet despite each characters weaknesses and flaws, they manage to find ways to overcome those expectations. The story is as rich as any Merchant Ivory production, and the quality shows.
The performances by all the leads is extremely commendable.  They convey the love, confusion, and sincerety of their characters without ever going over the top. Especially Graves, who's character in English society at the time had the least status, manages to give him the most dignity as he pursues a man he loves. An equally fine supporting cast, from the brilliant Denholm Elliott to the amazing Judy Parfitt, give this move the credence and weight it deserves.
Also commendable, this movie does not shy away at all from the sexuality included as part of the story. What's amazing is that this movie was made back in 1987, yet it treats the homosexual romance with the same reverence and respect as a heterosexual romance. It's refreshing how a series of films in the eights, from this to Parting Glances, truly were revolutionary.
Finally, this movie's transfer to DVD is incredible. The movie is beautfiul, rich, and colorful. I have yet to see a finer transfer as the quality is superb. It is a scrumptious feast to watch. DVD collectors wishing to have high quality movies in this medium certainly won't want to pass up these disks.
This movie will always hold a special place in my heart, and now I own the DVD version to treasure and watch without having to channel surf. I cannot recommend Maurice enough, or thank Merchat Ivory enough for producing such a high quality movie.",1079049600,18,2992,4.864705882352941
849192,5,6304341849,"Maurice, based on E. M. Forster's posthumously published novel, was hardly the first homosexually oriented film to be released.  The Boys in the Band, Parting Glances and numerous telefilms had already been released.  But Maurice was the first film of any note--depicting homosexuality in a sympathetic light and with a happy ending to boot--to become a crossover success.
Set in the years 1909-1913, Maurice has been referred to as Forster's weakest novel, and there is justification in that label.  In the novel, Clive seems to have no clear motivation for his transformation from gay to straight, and he seems to become genuinely heterosexual following a trip to Greece.  The screenplay has improved on that by involving a secondary character in a homosexual scandal, which ruins his own life and frightens Clive.  Further, it's made clearer in the film that Clive's marriage is a loveless sham.  In this and several other respects, the film is a distinct improvement over the novel.  One cannot imagine Forster being unhappy with the changes the screenwriter made.
James Wilby realistically plays the title character, whose journey towards self-acceptance is the plot's main focus.  Wilby plays Maurice without a trace of affectation, as a homosexual who could easily pass for straight, but who has no patience for sham and rejects living a lie.  Hugh Grant as Clive--prissy, judgemental, and fearful--mirrors the sad tale of many a gay man who's stepped back into the closet.  But it's Rupert Graves' Scudder who remains in the mind long after viewing.  Graves manages to make the rough, uncouth gamekeeper sympathetic and even likeable (it doesn't hurt that Graves is very easy on the eyes).  The love scenes are handled with frankness, but without sensationalism.
Director James Ivory has a keen eye for camera placement (the memorable shots are too numerous to mention here), and draws natural, unforced performances from the cast-no easy task considering the formal dialogue.  The production, shot on a shoestring budget, looks impressively lavish-thanks to the excellent cinematography, costumes, and Richard Robbins' lush score (with its appropriate nod to Tchaikovsky).
Supervised by the Criterion Collection, the new transfer is a wonder to behold: very clean, with crisp, bold colors throughout.  The sound is also improved over the VHS and Laserdisc issues.  However, I noticed some audible camera noise during quiet scenes.  The bonus material is insightful without being overly flashy.

The acting is also superb with a pre-stardom Hugh Grant as the staunchly repressed Clive Durham, James Wilby as the title character, Rupert Graves as the hunky garden boy Scudder and Ben Kingsley in a humourous turn as Maurice's psychiatrist.

Forster's touching novel to life -- and I suspect that was no easy task because so much of the novel involves the main character's innermost thoughts and feelings.  However, Merchant and Ivory did a beautiful job conveying the loneliness, fear and desperation of the main character, Maurice Hall.
The movie follows Maurice (James Wilby) down his road of self-discovery;  from his embarrassing teen years to Cambridge (where he gets his first exhilarating taste of love) to his post-collegiate years as a young man struggling to come to terms with his sexuality in a time when homosexuals were mercilessly persecuted.
The movie is also very much about class struggle.  Maurice is a gentleman born and bred, with a penchant for snobbery.  As he comes to terms with his sexuality, he is forced to deal with differences in class when he realizes he is in love with someone from the serving class.
Readers of the novel will be delighted as much of the wonderful dialogue from the book appears in the film.
The characters were perfectly cast, with Hugh Grant (before he was a mega star) as Clive Durham, the perfect young gentleman from Cambridge (and Maurice's first love), Rupert Graves as the smoldering, lower class hunk who wins Maurice's heart, and Ben Kingsley in a hilarious turn as Maurice's junk-psychologist.  James Wilby was spot-on in the title role and he perfectly captures the isolation, sadness and ultimate joy of the conflicted Maurice.
""Maurice"" is a touching love story that anyone -- straight or gay -- can enjoy.  Romance knows neither of these terms.  And, the movie *is* unabashedly romantic and optimistic  -- your heart will soar when Maurice finally gives in, casts societal conventions aside and visits his beloved at the boathouse.

849349,5,6304341849,"have long been a fan of Merchant/Ivory productions, perhaps the best known being 'A Room with a View' and 'Howards End'. However, there is a Merchant/Ivory production made in the same time and with the same qualities that often gets overlooked, and in so being, it is in keeping with its source.
Merchant/Ivory have worked through the writings of E.M.Forster's novels with flair, style, and grand film-making, very much in keeping with the grand style of Forster's writing. However, the novel Maurice was not published in Forster's lifetime. He believed, even to his death in 1970, that is was a novel ahead of its time. Yet Forster completed it in 1914.
Alas, it was due to the English (and more general) tendency to discount gay characters as being appropriate subjects for literature, particularly when they are sympathetic, almost romantic characters. In Forster's own handwriting, a note on the manuscript found after his death read 'Publishable, but worth it?'
This is a basic tale of sexual awakening in post-Victorian England, showing the relationship and the contrast between Maurice Hall and Clive Durham. Both are undergraduates together, and through the course of very English educational encounters, discover in each other 'the love that dared not speak its name', a situation reinforced by all worldly standards.
I heard it once remarked that one thing that makes so many people rankle at discussions of homosexuality is that many people rankle at frank discussions of ANY sexuality. This dictum would certainly be true of the turn-of-the-century British. In one scene, even the professor teaching Greek glosses over references in the translation that are unappetising to him.
In the end, we see the relationship between Maurice and Clive run full course, and see the classic options: Clive runs in a panic into marriage and a respectable life with a wife who seems to think she is a keen judge of human nature, but really hasn't a clue on this one; Maurice opts for love true to his nature, but at what cost? Alas, we don't know. The manuscript was unfinished, and the film likewise comes to no firm conclusion.
The film and novel are great representations of Edwardian London and country life, as well as university life at the time. The minor sociological issues that arise; the class system is illustrated in wonderful characters (from the Durham household, a country-gentry, but essentially untitled family, to the Halls, a suburban middle class, to Scutter and the servants at the Durham estate, some of whom are as scathing toward a middle-class pretender like Hall as any upper-class person would be).
The film, like most Merchant/Ivory productions, is an almost perfect period piece -- settings, costumes, mannerism, it is almost as if camera and crew were magically transported back in time to get the proper setting.
Maurice Hall is played by James Wilby, who turns up in other Merchant/Ivory productions such as Howards End, but who has thus far failed to make much of an American presence. Clive Durham is played, on the other hand, by Hugh Grant, who looks very much different and younger from the Hugh Grant who went up a hill and came down a mountain to attend four weddings and a funeral only to get stopped by the police for solicitation in Hollywood...
Superb minor supporting performances by Simon Callow and Denhom Elliot, also Merchant/Ivory regulars, help round out the cast, as well as a cameo by Ben Kingsley as the Edwardian verison of a reparative therapist, trying to hypnotise homosexuality out of Maurice, suggesting that he swagger more and walk around with a gun to increase his feelings of masculinity; this doctor utters my favourite line in the film:  'The English have always been disinclined to accept human nature.'
He then suggests that Maurice move to France or Italy, where such as he are in less jeopardy.
A very interesting film all around, a bit slow moving at times, but in all a great piece of film-making from great film-makers.
Oh, yes, it is pronounced 'Morris' (like the cat).",1057708800,11,4040,4.985185185185185
849350,5,6304341849,"E.M. Forster's novel  ""Maurice"" and  James Ivory's film version have both taken heavy criticism for their sentimentality and lack of realism. It's true the suggestion that Maurice (James Wilby) and Alec (Rupert Graves) will live happily ever after strains credulity, particularly considering that they live in Edwardian England in the shadow of Oscar Wilde's disgrace. But really, are Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie any more believable, or any less purply drawn, than Maurice and Alec? Alec climbing into Maurice's bedroom window is every bit as thrilling for some audiences as Rhett sweeping Scarlett up the staircase is for others, and neither couple should be despised. Also, the performances of the very talented (and very straight) Wilby and Graves deserve all the praise they can get, as does that of Hugh Grant as a far more conflicted young gay man.",1039219200,12,862,5.194244604316546
849399,5,6304341849,"Maurice is my all time favorite film. I own a copy on VHS and one on Laser Disc, and I'm eagerly awaiting its release on DVD. As (what some may consider) a senior gay person, this film speaks directly to me; it reflects wonderfully the frustrations that I felt growing up in the '50's. Although the movie is set in the Victorian era, the 1950's were really not that different in its attitude towards gay people. The film captures so very well the longings of Maurice (as a gay man) for love, affection and some meaning to his life--the things that he felt everyone else was having but were denied to him because of his inner hidden longings.
The film is beautiful to view and the sound tract is gorgeous--typical Merchant and Ivory--but, most of all, each actor is completely believable in his role. A very young Hugh Grant (long before becoming famous)is very good as Maurice's first love interest wanting a pure platonic love with Maurice even though Maurice wanted the ""real"" thing. My true feeling about Grant's character is that he really did not have the guts to deal with the ramifications of his true feelings (watch how he plays with Maurice's emotions and affections--I would have punched him!). Jame Wilby, as Maurice, is outstanding; he expresses the hurt, torture and longings of ""the love that dare not speak its name"" very well. However, the true standout for me is Rupert Graves (one of my favorite actors) who plays Scudder--he certainly shows what ladders are made for!(you'll have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about) He plays a man that knows what he wants and goes after it no matter what the cost--he redirects his life and alters his life's dream for the possibility (not, at the time of his decision, guaranteed) of love. Maurce and Scudder's final scene together when they have decided that love, no matter what, can conquer all, is truly the thing that we all dream about. Their ""togetherness"" points out another strong theme in the movie--the British Class System--not only did they have the ""gay thing"" to deal with but also the ""class thing"" to overcome. (Due to the fact that Scudder is from what is deemed a lower class being the Gamekeeper, he is , at first, completely ignored by Maurice until Scudder climbs into Maurice's bed, by the means of a ladder, and shows him what it's all about!!)
I read E.M. Forster's book when it was finally released in the 1970's and I feel the film is faithful to the book and that Forster would have been pleased with the film. I don't know how many times I have viewed this movie (many, many, times), it, nevertheless, is a movie that reaffirms, over and over again,, my very existence.
I have found, through out the years that a lot of heterosexuals find the movie to be boring; however, I feel that if you are an average gay male, (especially of a certain age) you will find it reflective of your life (or, at least, a portion thereof)--I do!
Believe me, my life would have been a great deal poorer if the film Maurice had not been a part of it.
I know my review is from an older person's perspective; however, I do believe that a younger person would have an appreciation for the movie if nothing more than gaining some knowledge of what it was like, not so very long ago, to be gay. In fact, I think anyone, no matter what his age happens to be, could certainly enjoy this film.",1032825600,145,3362,4.5495049504950495
849400,4,6304341849,"British author E.M. Forster wrote ""Maurice"" in 1914. It deals with his feelings about his own homosexuality and about the oppressive and repressive society he was a part of. Not surprisingly, the novel was not published until 1971. It may not be his greatest work, but it is his most personal.
Merchant Ivory Productions' 1987 film version is a handsome, faithful adaptation. As is usually the case with their period movies, as well as with Forster's novels, the real focus is on the English class system. True, being gay was especially difficult in England a hundred years ago, but the class system made everything rougher for most people. Clive Durham [Ugh Grant] is the one who initiates the love affair between himself and Maurice Hall [James Wilbey], but it is Clive's aristocratic background that eventually leads him the break it off, lest his estate, his fortune and his peerage be threatened. This leaves the much more honest Maurice to deal with his loss alone, for there is absolutely no one to turn to in his sorrow. Clive, meanwhile, has dutifully married a woman he has no passion for. Not that he had much passion for Maurice either. Clive doesn't seem to like getting his hair messed up by either sex. Ironically, it is at Clive's country estate where Maurice meets the sexy, passionate gamekeeper, Alec Scudder [Rupert Graves]. But here again the class system presents a problem. Maurice may not be royalty, but he is solidly middle-class. Alec is definitely lower-class.

The cast is uniformly excellent. Wilby is utterly convincing as Maurice. This may the movie in which Grant played his first true cad. Graves isn't required to do much more than be pretty and seductive, and he does both of these very well. The supporting cast is quite strong and includes Ben Kingsley, Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow and Billie Whitelaw.
The movie's ending befits a romantic drama. It's lovely and hopeful, but it also contradicts the class struggle theme. On the other hand, most of Forster's novels have a main character whose view of the world is shattered by someone beneath his or her station in life.
Many viewers, including a lot of gays, will find the movie tame and a bit dull. Our view of homosexuality has changed so dramatically in a few short decades that ""Maurice"" will seem unfathomable to some. Others will see it for what it is - an elegant and quietly passionate love story from a time when such love was verboten.",1023926400,14,2437,4.830143540669856
849401,5,6304341849,"A wonderful movie. You don't have to be gay to enjoy this film, but it helps. This post-Victorian era gay coming -of- age love story (whew!), is beautifully told and filmed, in the Merchant-Ivory tradition. James Wilby, and Hugh Grant, before he was Hugh Grant, are very touching as Maurice and Clive, as they discover ""the love that dare not speak it's name"". No matter your persuasion, you can't fail to be moved by their predicament in that repressed time where one could still be (and often was) jailed for homosexuality. As sometimes in real life, it is a heartbreakingly told story about the decisions sometimes forced upon us, and the ramifications and resignations of not being true to ones self, because of familial or social restrictions as to what is ""normal"" behavior. These charactars, especially Wilby's impeccably portrayed Maurice(pronounced ""Morris""), are good, decent people, who are suffering because they cannot be who they simply are. Without giving away the ending, it is an ultimately up-lifting story about the extreme courage it sometimes takes , then as now, to be true to ones self, and, finding your dignity, in the face of a segment of society that often insists you deserve none. All of the actors, most of whom are unknown to general audiences, are wonderful, in that underplayed, classy English way, making the smallest part integral to the story.

  The acting was great, the places, the locations where it's filmed. It was perfect, everthing well done. And the story was great, very moving. The story will touch you some way. It makes you see the way that homesexuals were treated back then. What both Clive and Maurice had to go trough to hide there feelings, after realizing how strongly they feel about each other. How they fell in love, and how love is possible in all ways. Takes you to all the hard work that had to be done, then only to be beaten by society's views, when Clive, Hugh Grant, does the right thing, and marry a woman. Of course, after seeing the things they had to do to get there, the ""right"" way seems more like the loser way, the cowards way out. Now at first it seems a little ackward to see Maurice, James Wilby, find another relationship with Rupert Graves's character. It really throws you off, it seems unreal in this case, but then it starts to fit in. You really have to think about it.

849404,4,6304341849,"This is certainly one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, from an aesthetic point of view. I felt swept up by the scenery, the music, the costumes. But, aside from the surface beauty, there beats underneath the heart of a true classic. This is one of Merchant/Ivory's most under-rated films. It is the adaptation of the E.M. Forster novel, 'Maurice', which itself remained un-published until after his death. The film is completely faithful to the book, so faithful, in fact, that it stretches to two and a half hours what could have been told in under two hours. But, no matter. It never ceases to amaze me how the British can produce films of such breath-taking detail and clarity, and spend only a fraction of the budget that their American counterparts do.
James Wilby stars as Maurice Hall, who falls in love with his classmate, Clive Durham, portrayed by Hugh Grant. They are both undergraduates at Cambridge. The time is the Edwardian era, and they must keep their feelings under wraps. Clive is much more reserved than Maurice, in the long run. Eventually Clive gives in to the pressures from his mother (an icily perfect Judy Parfitt) and marries the pretty but uninteresting Anne (Phoebe Nichols). Maurice and Clive never consummated their relationship, and from the looks of things, there isn't much of a sexual relationship between Clive and his wife.
Maurice finds his solace and his savior in Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper on Clive's estate, played with ferociously understated sensuality by Rupert Graves. Indeed, the second half of this film belongs to Rupert Graves. He is young, baby-faced, but with a deep voice and a confident swagger, and the simmering sexuality about ready to explode. You can see his feelings in his eyes. It would be impossible for Maurice to turn him down. This is where the film received some criticism; since Maurice and Alec are from different classes, backgrounds and education, surely their relationship would wither and fade once the passion had ended? E.M. Forster received the same criticism when he shared his manuscript with a few select friends. But, part of the reason the book succeeds is because of the belief and fervent hope that the relationship between Maurice and Alec will work. It must work, against all the odds of society.
The portrayal of the period's homophobia is exquisite. There is a heartbreaking scene where Maurice tries to confide in the family doctor, portrayed by Denholm Elliott. Dr. Barrie merely reacts to Maurice in disgust. Maurice turns to a quack hypnotist, played by Ben Kingsley, but finds he cannot deny his true nature.
Since Hugh Grant has become mega famous in the 10 plus years since the film was made, it is often referred to as a ""Hugh Grant film."" Grant is extremely reserved in the role, showing no signs of his future as a comic actor. I would have preferred him to portray Maurice Hall, however. James Wilby is sweet and believeable, but he lacks something in the role. Although he does balance well with the erotic Rupert Graves, as Maurice seems as confused and searching as he is intended to be.
A breath-taking, entertaining and extremely intelligent film; I highly recommend it.",1014076800,26,3188,4.894639556377079
849405,5,6304341849,"Regarding the movie itself:  I really can't add anything new which hasn't already been said about ""Maurice"" -- and I LOVE the movie!
One thing to note:  the soundtrack for this movie is absolutely gorgeous.  The score transcends being ""movie music"" and can stand alone on its own right as a concert piece.  Very seldom have I ever encountered a musical score which so very nearly matched the mood of the movie -- the ones which come to mind are ""Gone With the Wind"", Bernard Herrmann's scores for Alfred Hitchcock, and the movie ""Cinema Paradiso.""
I'm music director for a church, and have used parts of the score as prelude and postlude music on Sunday mornings -- and the congregation loved it!
This is a first-class movie with a top-notch musical score!  (John Williams, take notice:  one CAN write an effective musical score without trying to out-orchestrate Richard Strauss!)",1008374400,7,880,4.87248322147651
849406,5,6304341849,"This is the one of the most faithful novel-to-film adaptations that I have seen. American director James Ivory has a wonderfully British sensibility, and the movie vividly recreates late Edwardian England in muted autumnal colours. In particular, it gives the 21st century viewer a very real appreciation of what it must have been like to be gay in such a society.
The cast is uniformly excellent. James Wilby was not Ivory's first choice for the central role of upper-class Maurice (Daniel Day Lewis and Julian Sands were earlier contenders), but he gives an outstanding and totally plausible portrayal. Equally good is Hugh Grant, years before he found fame as the archetypal British twit. Grant's role is a difficult one; he must at first engage our sympathy and fondness, then gradually lose our respect as he seeks to enter ""respectable"" society. Ultimately, we come to despise his cowardice. Grant achieves all of this without descending into caricature - a considerable feat.
Rupert Graves makes a fine Alex Scudder, the lusty undergamekeeper who seduces and transforms Maurice. Apart from a slightly inconsistent accent, he, too. seems entirely plausible and fans of DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover should note that this full-blooded lad pre-dates Lawrence's own gamekeeper by many years!
An outstanding supporting cast of seasoned pros includes the late, great Denholm Elliot and Ben Kingsley in small, but pivotal roles as, respectively, a bullying doctor and a hypnotist, both of whom Maurice unsuccessfully seeks help from.
This movie has a superb period atmosphere, a leisurely but rewarding pace, plenty of understated passion, memorable music and great script-writing. Kudos to the scenarists for being so faithful to the spirit of Forster, while at the same time adding scenes to remind viewers of the real dangers for gay men in Edwardian England.

849407,5,6304341849,"Merchant Ivory has been ridiculed in recent years for its ""costume dramas,"" not because they are bad, but because they are so complete.  The ridicule has mostly been targeted at them through critics of Helena Bonham Carter, who is arguably the first lady of Merchant Ivory type films.
With that arbitrary preamble out of the way, let's get to Maurice.  In the early 1980's most films of a controversial nature were little independent films long on good intentions but short on creative ability or writing.  Maurice was very different:  it was based on a classic (and once banned) novel by a famous author, and it was created lovingly and painstakingly by the Acadamy Award winning production company of Merchant Ivory.
A story about two college men in love with each other in Edwardian England is the basic premise for the movie.  However, the turmoil that usually accompanies such homosexual relationships today is compounded because of the time in which this story is set.  Class differences, ambition, secrecy, false marriages, and deceit are the undercurrents which drive this film to its moving and emotionally satisfying (if rather unbelievable) conclusion....
Unrealistic ending aside, this is a beautiful film.  The scenery and the period detail is typical Merchant Ivory - in other words  - impeccable!  The script is right on.  The acting - superb.  This is the film that really began Hugh Grant's screen career.  In fact, this is a big budget Hollywood film masquerading as a small arthouse film (or is it the other way round).
Regardless, rent this film and see if you don't agree.

The movie is really spectacular, staying impecably true to the book in pretty much every way. 99.9 percent of the movie's dialogue comes straight out of the book, unchanged. Besides the great script (thank you E. M. Fortster!) the acting is really amazing. There is not a single character in this movie who isn't perfectly portrayed. James Wilby as the title character gives a brilliantly multi-faceted performance and Rupert Graves as Alec Scudder makes you believe he has three times as many lines as he really does just through his expression and presence. I'll also give kudos to Hugh Grant because this was before his big break and therefore he actually gives a very admirable, non-egotisic performance. The only thing I resent is that the movie box has HIM on the cover... WHAT?! Ah, marketing. Sigh. But this movie is really a rare and beautiful piece of art. Like Forster, it is life and love-affirming. All of E. M. Forster's books have a beautiful quality of hope about them--they acknowledge that pain and suffering are parts of life, but they do not glorify them.

849541,5,6304341849,"I found this movie to be very interesting in that it revealed the silent society, or the silent presence of a culture that was held to dishonour and persecution.  It reminded me of todays society, and even though there are many openly gay people and organizations, there is still that silent presence in many ""religious institutions"".  To be openly gay is to bring disaster upon yourself.  What I really took notice of, was at the end.  Maurice stopped by his first love Clyve to speak to him of his present situation with Scutter.  Clyve attempts to show that he is happy with being married to a lovely girl, but in the end, it appears that Clyve is not really happy with being married to this woman.  There is a deep rooted thought going through Clyve's mind.  I got the feeling that Clyve would have been happier in being with Maurice, if he hadn't bent to the will of his mother, society, and the fear of loosing everything if he was ever caught.
It is a very good movie to watch and match today's social attitude with the 1914/16 period of English history.  Not much seems to change.",998352000,,1088,4.4873096446700504
849542,5,6304341849,"I love this movie so much that I have seen it like ten times since I got it a couple of days ago.  Maurice is a brilliantly crafted movie/book.  The movie follows the book almost to a fault, and in fact I feel like the movie is in some ways better than the book, except for the fact that the book obviously affords more explanation of the plot and character feelings--and of course parts of the book are left out of the movie or changed around, but this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Anyway, I highly recommend both watching this movie and reading the book because this story is just so beautiful and so well crafted that only the most ardent hater of the homosexual lifestyle could totally hate it.
Since I absolutely adore happy endings, this story makes me very very happy because many gay books/movies do not have them, so it is nice to see a gay story end with the couple seeming to be truly in love and have a chance at having a lasting relationship, although their life together would obviously be filled with trials and tribulations, given the extremely high level of homophobia in England in the 1910's.
I really really recommend also getting the book along with the movie because there is a ""Terminal Note"" at the end of the book that is really nice to have because it is the author's explanation on how he came about to write the book and how he crafted the three main characters of Maurice, Clive, and Alec.
This book/movie is an extremely moving social commentary on society's refusal to accept people who do not fit into its idea of what is normal.  Maurice definitely does not choose to be a homosexual; he even tries to be ""cured"" of his ""unmentionable"" yearnings and feelings, but to no avail. Yet given society's completely unreasonable viewpoint towards homosexuality, he can either be like Clive, and enter into a loveless marriage that is unsatisfying for both he and his wife, or he is doomed to a life of utter loneliness, if he wants to live a life that is acceptable to the general population--one that will not land him in jail like Risley.
The only thing that I do not like about this movie is that some of the dialogue is difficult if not impossible to understand, but this does not detract all that much from the movie.",985132800,9,2251,4.496332518337408

It's the story of a young man's coming to terms with his sexuality in pre-WW I Edwardian England.  Homosexuality is still illegal and as upperclassmen very taboo to even be associated with someone who might ""morally"" corrupt those who are socially beneath them.
The story really begins when Maurice begins his second term at college where he meets fellow classmate Clive Durham (Hugh Grant).  Clive, exploring his own sexuality (albeit Platonic), falls in love with Maurice.  At first Maurice is horrified, but later the two find a kind of happiness together, which must be kept secret from everyone else.  Maurice is content, although it's an asexual relationship.  Eventually their relationship dissolves and Clive chooses to marry, thus carrying on his lineage and coming into his inheritance.
Maurice is crushed, and eventually seeks help to ""cure"" him by means of a hypnotist (very well played by Ben Kingsley).
Maurice eventually falls in love with Clive's gamekeeper (note the D.H. Lawrence influence here!).  He finds happiness at last despite the British Class system.
The cast is superb, from James Wilby (Maurice) and Rupert Graves (Scudder) and Hugh Grant (Clive).  If you've read the book (and I recommend that you do!) then you'll notice a few differences here and there.  The story is basically the same, one of the best Merchant/Ivory productions!

  Maurice explores the above question as we gaze upon two young men who are trying to come to terms with their homosexuality.

Underlying the emotional turmoil of the two men we find a class issue full of snobbery on both Maurice's part ( his initial encounter with Scudder, a servant), Clive's obsession to achieve and a contempt for women.

But wisely, Maurice does not  yield to the call of the Oxbridge dons, the Christian moralizers, or the  psychologist, that urges him to enjoin the conservative stereotype favored  by the British industrial empire and his social class.

""Maurice"" threw me into a  whirl of feelings, but in a way, I felt reliefed. No more pretending.  Today, ten years after, I am proud to be gay, living with my friend and all  those uncertainties, surmises and questions remained on the pages of my  diary...
I have ""Maurice"" on tape and watch it every now and  then. It still has a strong effect on me, even I know every dialogue in it  by heart. I watched another ecranisations like ""A room with a  view"" and ""Howard's end"", but the both acts of James Wilby  and Hugh Grant are so persuadive here that this is almost an paradox,  having in mind that Grant is a straight male-sex symbol. The word that  comes to my mind first when mentioning ""Maurice"", is  beautifulness. Maybe this was the reason it affected me in that way -  homosexual love is presented as something beautiful, romantic,  non-stereotypic, longing and truthfull. Another subject, strongly presented  here, is sacrifice of Maurice, who subordinated all his career and needs  just to be with a love he met in Alec Scudder. The end of the film is not a  real end but just a beginning of viewer's interpretation and his explaining  of question whether their love has made it through. It is left for him to  decide what happened after. I'd point out that ""Maurice"", even  acting like some kind of a fairy tale, represents all types of man  approaching his own homosexuality and this hasn't changed a bit over the  history. Clive's tightness into straight-acting world and common-sense  lifestyle is just another sight of those gays who rather choose to get  married and therefore ruin the life of another woman who, in this kind of  relationship, can't be nothing but victim, trying to hide from the rest of  the world, but as for Clive, this turns out to be just a short-termed  solution. I have a strong sense that at the final scenes when Clive replays  all his tender moments with Maurice when they were together at Cambridge,  he is thinking: you can fool with the rest of the world, but you just can't  fool yourself. Then, Maurice, who decided to live the way that will make  him happy, no matter what the British Class system might think - it is a  step someone can take now a days, prepared to struggle and fight with a  confinement and intolerance of the straight-majority. It is true that being  gay is no more being considered as an illness or blasphemy, but things  haven't changed that much as they seemed to.
If you like  ""Maurice"", then you're going to like the book, too. I suggest you  read it. It is one of the best descriptions on gay love I've ever read,  especially when you have in mind this novel was written in 1910 when noone  even dared to think about writing and mention this theme in a literature. I  only feel sorry that this review is limited to 1,000 of words, as here is  so much more to tell about... A great movie!",949017600,24,3692,4.511346444780635

7868395,5,6304341849,"Saw this many years ago when it came out, and never forgot how moving a story it was. Came across it here on Amazon by accident while looking for another film, and immediately added it to my cart! A very underrated and fairly unknown film that stars Hugh Grant long before he became a famous person. It is the story of two young men who meet at university, and discover that they have feelings for one another, and ultimately fall in love. The story is set in England of the early 1900s, a time and place when being gay was absolutely not accepted, and thus forces them to become extremely closeted, which in turn leads you down the road of frustration and drama that goes with it. Although this is a gay themed movie which may not be everyone's cup of tea, what makes this move a great film, is that the director focuses on telling the dramatic story of the individuals as persons, who are trying to navigate something new and foreign to them, and the trials and tribulations of not being able to openly be who you are, for fear of being imprisoned and bringing shame upon your family. The focus is not on the ""gayness"" so to speak, but serves at the back-drop to the tragedy and triumph of the characters. There is some light nudity in the film, but nothing remotely comparable to the nudity and gratuitous sex seen in the films of today, or even on television for that matter. With that said, I don't think it is an appropriate movie for children, but rather for mature audiences. A great film, that I hope you will enjoy...",1525478400,,1527,4.418439716312057
