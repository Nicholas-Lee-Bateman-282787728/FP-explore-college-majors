7994305,1,B00009YEOW,"I bought the DVD/Book, fully expecting to get very basic content.  What I actually got is the most uninspiring dribble I think I can imagine.  Mr. Bay seems to be a lousy uke player and his emotionless reading of the off-screen cue cards is laughable.  This product is all about bad strumming form, bad quality example songs and if you got the book...bad formatting of the arrangements.

There are many, many other self-teaching books and resources out there.  Virtually ANYTHING is a better value than this loser.",1118016000,15,514,4.862068965517241
