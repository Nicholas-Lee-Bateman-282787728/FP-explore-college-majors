5688942,5,B00C2R11Z2,Great to see some filmmakers still know how to tell a interesting tale and let the story build. The million mile a hour action sequences that seem to be in almost all films recently get so redundant. We absolutely loved the slow tension build and the sticking with traditional effects instead of CGI did nothing but add to the overall feel of the movie. A fantastic soundtrack and a edge-of-your seat finale made for a extremely enjoyable watch!,1372723200,,445,4.717948717948718
5688943,4,B00C2R11Z2,"I made the mistake of NOT renting this film when it first appeared on Amazon ONLY based on the 1 customer review (which gave it 1 star).  Clearly it is the reviewer who is less than an adequate film watcher or reviewer.  I was relieved to see 2 other (more appropriate) reviews & I agree...WELL WORTH THE COST OF ADMISSION TO THIS E TICKET RIDE, And what a ride it is!  You'll not rest from the minute you get it going to the last 5 seconds.  Absolutely great story, decent job of the actors - especially the 2 leads.  More than a good job by all......GREAT.

If you are a kid who grew up in the 80s, then this film is pure nostalgia with a modern clean look. Was surprised by the creature effects and design. Everything was really well done. It wasn't particularly scary but I suspect it wasn't suppost to be. It felt more like a brother adventure that dipped into some gruesome horror moments.

5688963,3,B00C2R11Z2,"What kid hasn't gone to bed at night thinking there was a monster lurking under his bed or in his closet?  Under the Bed expands on that idea but fails to actually run with it.  Teenager Neal Hausman has returned home after living out of state with family for two years.  Neal was sent away by his father, Terry, after the death of his mother in a fire, which local gossip blames on Neal.

Neals reunion is not a happy one.  His always angry father is on him constantly to group and be a man, and his new stepmom is trying too hard to get to know him.  All Neal cares about is his little brother Paulie.  He discovers that Paulie is being tormented by the same evil entity that lived under Neals bed, turning his nights into living nightmares.  Dad dismisses the boys claims of monsters as foolish nonsense, locking them in their room at night.  But there is something underneath their bed, something which creeps out and forces the boys to sleep on their dressers at night.  They have to destroy the creature before it destroys their family.

Under the Bed is an interesting concept but Director Steven C. Miller and Writer Eric Stolze fail to do much with the idea.  Unlike similar films like Darkness Falls or The Boogeyman, Under the Bed fails to develop much of a mythology to capture the viewers interest.  What is the monster?  Where does it come from?  Why is it haunting these two particular boys?  Those questions are never answered and as such, the film plays like an extended episode of Goosebumps.  Furthermore Miller contradicts himself when in one part, Neal says the monster is bound to their beds, but in another, the creature harasses stepmom Angela in the garage laundry room and later shows up at the neighbors house when the boys are spending the night.

The two leads Jonny Weston and Gattlin Griffith do a strong job throughout, particularly in conveying the sense of stress that comes with sleep deprivation but they simply are not giving much to work with.  Add to that cheap creature effects and Under the Bed should have remained there permanently.",1438387200,3,2075,4.620218579234972

Concept is overused in so many ways, and too many cliches.  Ugh!  I prefer novel ideas, something that keeps me thinking and not just cringing.  Clearly this is an independent film, and though I don't have a problem with independents, they don't need to look low budget as well.  I won't recommend this film as there are far too many good horrors to watch instead. Oh, and it drags on and on and on for suspense that turns out to be a huge let-down.  Hitchcock would NOT approve.",1434153600,,606,4.546296296296297

5688981,4,B00C2R11Z2,"The story plays on basic fears of growing up with uncertainty, tragedy and change that drive childhood imaginations and insecurities. The film ads the element of a supernatural evil that plagues the brothers thoughts, stalks them, and lives according to the adults in the kids lives-totally within their own imagination. This theme flows in an almost mournful melancholic way throw the first half of the film, pushing forward mostly on the melodrama and strained emotional dynamics between the characters. Almost as if trying to play with the notion that maybe it is in the kids imagination and the true monster lies closer in more realistic fashion. The film plays out in a mostly surrealistic style which does seem to carry on a bit too long. I was begging for some real horror or action and instead received standard trickery and fake-out scares for no reason. Then the second half of this film kicks in and oh boy does it kick in hard.

This film for me personally, is one of the better creature features to come out recently and the films aesthetic quality is top notch.  It maintains a eerie  not quite right  air about it through the entire film. The special effects and the monster itself were pretty awesome, and the whole little mythic element to its existence was memorable. Much like the world of Wes Cravens They. I would have loved to hear more about that otherworld and the creature under the bed. But hey  live is abound with mystery and not all things reward with explanation. Anyway back to Under The Bed. This film is a refreshing new modernized spin on an old childhood fear and worth watching at least once, for me personally a few more times. The gore and graphic violence, though pretty much nil until the last act, was gory  and I loved it. Steven C. Miller is a true talent, offering an almost romantic love of surreal horror that ends in an epic high intensity bloodshed. That quality to today's horror is greatly lacking-I think. Very few directors express the more Gothic love affair with horror that played through 80's horror.  I really enjoyed this film.",1432598400,,2085,4.7272727272727275

I read reviews before selecting a movie to watch. I read the reviews for Under The bed, and didn't see any dislikes, so I bought it. That was a mistake. The first signs of the thing under the bed is a bit creepy, but as the movie went on, I found myself bored and asking myself ""why am I still watching this?""

Come on, we've seen that plot in ""Darkness falls,"" ""Boogie man"" and countless other movies, most recently, ""Oculus.""
The movie doesn't have much action until the end, and the special effects are horrid. The acting is overdone and unbelievable, especially from the father, who happens to have lots of dialogue, which would be awful, even is delivered by the best actor in the world.",1399507200,,723,4.526717557251908
5689010,3,B00C2R11Z2,"Novice director Steven C. Miller (Silent Night) takes a stab at an R-rated contemporized approach to the classic ""monster under my bed"" story.  I was generally pleased with Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2011) and The Boogeyman (2005), so why not give this a shot?

After years apart following the death of his mother, disheveled and angsty teen Neal (Jonny Weston; John Dies at the End, Taken 3) returns home to live with his father (Peter Holden; Alien Abduction) and younger brother Paulie.  He had been sent away two years ago to ""get well"" after he burned the house down with his mother in it, defending himself from the monster residing under his bed.  Now that he has returned, he learns his little brother has been tormented by the same demon every night.

The notion that an otherworldly monster can magically cross into our dimension through the floor under one specific kid's bed is pretty silly.  Terrifying, in fact.  That it only does so in the dark while you're asleepeven scarier.  There was so much potential for dark figures and painfully drawn-out tension.  But for some reason I never saw or felt either.  And what about the storyactually, what exactly is the story?  What drives this monster and how did it get in their house?  Why did it want these boys?  Are there more of these monsters?  Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2011) and The Boogeyman (2005) made at least some effort to explain their monsters, their motivations, their origins and their behavior.  But here, it just seems that this monster came with the house and its abilities and weaknesses seem to change without explanation as the movie persists.  That's really all we get.

Not willing to tell their parents this ridiculous story (as they haven't in years past), the two brothers unite to fight this monster.  They arm themselves with flashlights, tape, wire, a power drill and duct tape.  But is this monster really a threat?  Neal was once psychologically tortured and sleep-deprived by this creature.  But that creature had 365 opportunities a year to get the upper hand on a sleeping child and somehow never won!  After Neal left, his younger brother made it 730 consecutive nights unscathed.  If this monster was really in the business of eating children to survive, it clearly would have starved to death by now.  It doesn't seem that menacing.  A clawed hand reaching out from under the bed is scary, YES!  But if it never does anything elsewhat's the big deal?

I think the filmmakers really thought this movie was scary..it wasn't.  Despite their addition of loud music prefacing ""SOMETHING SCARY"" every time the camera zooms in on something (like, for example, the edge of a menacing bed skirt), I never felt convinced that anyone old enough to buy their own ticket for this movie could possibly be frightened by it.  Sophomoric scare attempts include a shaking washing machine and load noises, loud noises by themselves for no apparent reason, and close-ups of Neal looking at the bed with loud noises.  Noticing a trend here?

THEN ALL THE SUDDEN EVERYTHING CHANGED!

For over an hour we sit back and wonder why this movie isn't rated PG-13 or even just PG.  Then, after years of going hungry under the bed, the monster suddenly decides to show Neal's family and the audience that it is, in fact, not at all bound to the bed!  Neal and Paulie are next door when the creature arrives and twists off the neighbor kid's head in a gloriously gory display.  There's that R-rating we came for!  When they run back home it follows them and tears their dad's head apart like a food processor.  You hear that?  It just followed them!  Why the Hell did it just stay under the bed all these years?  We went from a lame movie starring a rubber claw under a bed with loud music and no scares to a gore-slathered, slimy creature romp.  The monster itself is actually pretty damned cool looking and the special effects are up to snuff as well.  It looks like an inbred, disfigured Moorlock covered in snot.

Why on Earth the director waited so long to reveal this creature, the action and the gore is beyond me because all of the exposition leading up to this was completely empty and the other characters--the parents, the neighbors, some random love interest that never goes anywhere--really never offered anything to the story, which never made any sense to begin with beyond the simple fact that inexplicably there is a child-hungry monster under Paulie's bed.

If things weren't random enough yet, the monster actually fashions a hunter's rope snare, traps Paulie like an animal and drags him into the under-the-bed slimy Netherworld!  So, just like in Poltergeist II (1986), Neal ties a rope around his waist and goes after him armed with a flashlight trident.  I can't even believe what I'm writing right now!  WTF is going on in this movie?  Were the writers all high?  When they come back to--ummmmreality I guess--the monster now literally has the ability to teleport before our eyes like Nightcrawler in X-Men.  Hooray consistency!  Then Neal is about to lose a fight against our under-the-bed teleporting Netherworld snot monster when he discovers that his dead mother's ashes are its one weakness.  Yeah!  He throws his mother's ashes on the monster and that's what kills it!

After a slow, confusing start this film eventually catapults its audience into a tumultuous spin cycle of bonkers gore, creature effects and action which--despite making no sense whatsoever--make the whole experience worth the price of admission.  In fact, the last 20 minutes were so off-the-wall entertaining that I don't regret buying this at all.  Yes it's very dumb.  But it's the kind of dumb I want to share with friends with an improvised drinking game.

5689011,1,B00C2R11Z2,"About half-way through the film I was looking for some reason to recommend it to others and I could not come up with any reason to do so. So, I will not here either!

I am always intrigued by the corners into which film writers and screenplay writers paint themselves in some films and the often goofy ways they attempt to extricate themselves (and the actors) from the situation they were placed. In this film, the story is not just disjointed but approached as if it were multiple mini-stories that are tied together in the end by merely writing in a particular character into a scene who has been ignored throughout the film. That type of story-telling is nothing if not annoying but in this case it makes the story ludicrous.

but nothing really stood out.
the monster isn't shown through a major portion of the film.
that was a good thing; it's what you don't see that scares you the most.
there was one bit however that i loved where you see the creature standing behind the mother and it is wrapped in a sheet with a hole where it's face should be; I GOT CHILLS!
the rest of the movie though left me wanting to fall asleep.
felt kinda bad for the lead character though when the creature offed his dad.
but the reveal of the monster was a disappointment.
you wait all this time to get a look at what is really scaring the guy this whole time and when you finally see it in the flesh all you can think to yourself is ""THAT'S IT!?, SERIOUSLY??""

The rules of the game are never laid out so you can't journey with your characters while they try to figure out how to beat this thing.

5689034,1,B00C2R11Z2,"This film begins with a surly teen (Neil) being driven by his father back home. The conversation they have is vague, but it is clear that a) the boy has been staying with an aunt for a couple years ever since he caused some kind of horrible accident at home, b) his relationship with his father is strained at best, and c) he has a younger brother named ""Paulie"" that he misses and worries about. He gets home, and as soon as he sees his old house, his eyes widen and his face locks in a sort of sexy-ish version of freaked out (get used to this facial expression), the camera zooms in on him and zooms in on the house and zooms in on him and tilts at a threatening angle and you hear a bunch of brass instruments (tubas and the like) bellow a bombastic ""BWAAAAAAAARRRRRMMMMM!"" in the soundtrack, letting viewers know that this is scary. This house. Or something.

He has some of the world's most awkward conversations with some of the world's flattest characters, giving them all a hearty dose of barely-strained surliness before he decides to go into the house to see Paulie. He steps up to the entrance to the door. His eyes grow dark and wide and freaked out, the camera frames him in a bad boy pose as he hesitates before the entrance, and the soundtrack clobbers you with another ""BWAAAAAAAARRRRRRRMMMMMM!""

This kind of thing happens, by my count, another twenty to fifty times. I can see why the filmmakers did it. It is very addictive. Whenever I do anything in my apartment now, I scream, ""BWAAAAAARRRRRRMMMMM!"" to preface it. I open the cabinet for some soup? ""BWAAAAAARRRRRRMMMMM!"" I get out the can opener? ""BWAAAAAARRRRRMMMMM!"" It drives my girlfriend up the wall.

This movie thinks it's scary, and it lets you know from frame one. It is not. It barely even makes sense. Neil and Paulie are afraid of some kind of bloodthirsty, otherworldly creature that lives under Neil's bed. Where did it come from? What does it want? To what rules does its universe adhere? Who knows! Certainly not the movie. There are hints here and there, but mostly it's just bizarre pointlessness that crumbles under the slightest analysis, like some kind of ultra-buttery Jenga stack.

It's not just the creature that makes no sense. Our father character goes nuts like a prison hoe-down at the drop of a hat. Neil seems to have some kind of split personality disorder, and the script can't decide what age Paulie is supposed to be. Other characters -- the bullies, the love interest, the step mother -- may as well just be cardboard cutouts with articulated jaws.

When the monster finally stops playing peek-a-boo and starts getting all up in everyone's faces, the film gets the burst of energy and ""holy crap!""-itude that it has wanted to have from the first BWAAAAAAARRRRRRRRMMMMMMMM! Of course, the monster's sudden attack of moxie also doesn't make any sense given the meager exposition we've been fed, but by that point you're likely not to care, grateful just to be spared another excruciatingly vague conversation or completely out-of-the-blue familial yelling match. The heck-raising doesn't last long, though, and it is aborted -- true to form -- in ludicrous, head-scratching style, with not even a smidgen of closure. You'd think out of respect to the audience that they'd reveal something to tie up one of the dozens of loose ends, or fill in just a few of the massive logical gaps, but nope.

Although, to be fair, the final shot of the movie DOES have an extra long BWWWAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRMMMMMMM! over it, so I guess you take what you can get.",1375920000,23,3553,4.72258064516129

""Under the Bed"" is one of the WORST horror movies I've seen in years.  Watching it, I had the suspicion that many scenes, scenes of exposition or explanation, ended up on the cutting room floor, because so many of the scenes that remain seem ludicrously short of reason or motive.  A perfect example is the scene in which the stepmother heads to the washer/dryer in the garage to do laundry and has an encounter with the thing from under the bed - then NEVER even mentions it afterward.  Another is the whole character of the father and his methodology to get the kids to behave.  Lock them in their rooms and unscrew the lightbulb in the ceiling!  THEN we'll have a scary encounter with the thing from under the bed...  The neighbors?  The thing from under the bed heading on over there only to provide the movie with a scene of horror?

He is coming home with his less than understanding father (Peter Holden) to reunite with his younger brother Paulie (Gattlin Griffith) and meet his new step mother Angela (Musetta Vander). As the film progresses we find out more about the fire incident and the thing that lives under the bed.

I liked how they did the horror and creep factor in the film. It didn't come at you constantly so you didn't get numb to it. There were a number of things that made me scratch my head.

1) Neal was gone for 2 years. Paulie was 3 when he left. He is clearly well older than 5, more like 10 or 11.
2) Angela experiences an early encounter, then acts like nothing happened.
3) Paulie has been sleeping in the same room as this thing for years which seems absurd.
4) Dad forces them to sleep in the haunted room to prove a point.

Would the monster view the guy as a 'father' of sorts? Is he acting out his hidden desires?

Nope, none of this is explored in the movie - or even really hinted at. The last 10 minutes had some good effects & action, but it was boring until that point. If it becomes available for free, skip the first half of the movie and just start in the middle. You won't have missed a single thing, and you can see some relatively interesting creature design.
