8495928,5,B006B8SRFA,"This was a great value & I loved ""A Dog Named Christmas"" which I had never seen. ""November Christmas & ""A Season for Miracles"" were already 2 of our family's favorites!  Christmas is a blessed time of  the year & we like movies like these as opposed to ridiculous comedies.  After all, Real life is filled with true humor, laughter, heartache, good times & hard times.  Thank you Hallmark for making great movies!",1363219200,8,413,4.616438356164384
8495929,5,B006B8SRFA,I saw all 3 of the movies over the christmas holiday. My Sister loved the movies and so since I knew that she loved it so much I decided to purchase the set and give it to her as a Christmas present and she was so surprised to receive it Here comes the flow of tears from her. I know that she will watch it next year. I hope she enjoys it I know that I did..We were both very pleased and we thank you very kindly. Be Blessed.,1359849600,3,425,3.7865168539325844
