1693167,2,B000063UYL,"I bought the Brainy Baby - Right Brain/Left Brain DVD's to try something else than Baby Einstein for my 16 months old. I am very disappointed.  They are taking all the Baby Einstein features - the classical music, the kinetic arts, the puppets, the toys - and not adding anything more innovative than an annoying voice that explains what's going on on the pictures. This is annoying since I thinks it's the parent's job to view the action and explain and share the joy with the kid - but even more annoying that it sounds like a laundry add. Compared to the Baby Einstein series where everything is pulled together to make sense - the music goes with action (and is re-edited for baby ears), the sound effects are right, and there is a logic order to the event, everything in the Brainy Baby series appear random and incredible cheap. The bottom line - my son will watch it but it compares to Baby Einstein like fast food to gourmet. Pick what you want for your kid - I will take Baby Van Gogh any day over this.",1056412800,36,1012,4.382978723404255
1693168,1,B000063UYL,"We bought the Brainy Baby CD's (left and right brain) after reading all the 5 star reviews. And true, our 16 month old will watch them - or part of them. They are way too long. And they are cheaply made compared to the Baby Einstein series - they basically takes everything that are in the Baby Einstein, the puppets, the music, the kinetic toys, the sound effect... The music is not re-orchestrated for kids and doesn't ""make sense""  the same way as in Baby Einstein, the sound effects are wrong, the puppet shows amateurish, and then there is an annoying voice naming the objects or shapes or colors. In one place the voice give the wrong name to a color. Nothing holds the (too) many scenes together . This is fast food for the brain - go buy Baby Van Gogh if you want some right brain nutrition.",1055808000,12,799,4.3624161073825505
1693169,5,B000063UYL,"This video held my daughter's attention when she was younger, and now that she is three she can run the video machine herself and will choose this one when she wants to relax.  I have used it in the morning to wake up to, I find it a peaceful and serene way to start the day.  When I have several children over, I find that playing this video in the background sets a tone for the atmosphere of my home - peaceful.  It is also interesting and educational, and I believe it helped my daughter's development when she was a baby.  It certainly has a positive affect on everyone who watches it in my house!  Even adults!",1048032000,,616,4.230769230769231
1693170,5,B000063UYL,"I have been educating my child with the Brainy Baby videos since she was 8 months old.  My child is now 23 months old and she is on the educational level of a 3 year old.  My child has mastered the sounds of all of the letters of the alphabet, she can count to 20 in English and to 10 in Spanish.  My child also knows all of her Shapes and Colors.  ...  The Brainy Baby videos will EDUCATE and ENTERTAIN at the same time for 45 minutes ... I believe that by allowing my child to view Brainy Baby right brain Left brain has allowed her to be a whole brain thinker, making it easier for her to retain information.  I am truly the proud parent of a Brainy Baby.....",1043539200,6,662,4.015267175572519
1693171,5,B000063UYL,"Our family has both the Brainy Baby series and the baby einstein videos. Brainy Baby simply beats Baby Einstein hands down! Most reviews (and everyone that we talk to) give Brainy Baby a 5 star rating. There may be a few moms that disagree, but I seriously question their judgement! The Brainy Baby series is most certainly worth the investment. As a mom, here is what I would tell you: If you put a Baby Einstein video in the VCR, what does your child learn?... that's right... NOTHING!  Just pretty pictures. If your child watches Brainy Baby, they actually LEARN their ABC's, 123's, Colors, etc. as well as being entertained with BEAUTIFUL images! (Not to mention that Brainy Baby is 50% longer than Einstein for the same price). Brainy Baby has not only taught our 17 month old daughter the ENTIRE alphabet, but it has been a lifesaver for my sanity too! I can't imagine any home without Brainy Baby.",1041033600,31,904,4.65
1693172,3,B000063UYL,"We bought this dvd based on the glowing reviews, but our 17 month old grew bored with it after a few minutes, where she's always interested in the Einstein dvds beginning to end. Not to mention that the visuals are identical to that of the Einstein series. If you are looking for an alternative to Baby Einstein then save your money.",1040601600,4,333,4.475409836065574
1693258,2,B000063UYL,My 15 month old grand-daughter has been subjected to this video since she was 3 months old and shows little interest.,1377216000,11,117,4.619047619047619
1693259,5,B000063UYL,"The background to this entire dvd is classical music.  They start out with one word colors, words, patterns, animals, sounds, objects, and counting. The dvd progresses with ideas that are more complex, but not complicated. It reminds me of Dick and Jane books when I was a child.  The primary colors constantly appear in many different forms.  They advance from animated objects to real objects, animals with sounds and children playing with educational toys.  There is an extra feature, a book with the words, but the words are read aloud.  They show you how Brainy Baby is produced, the children who participate and the producer of the show.  They also interview moms who support Brainy Baby.  Great video.",1374710400,,708,4.9491525423728815
1693260,5,B000063UYL,"The Brainy Baby series is fabulous and perfect for babies/toddlers because it is slower paced, engaging, and something you can learn from.  My kids didn't like Baby Einstein, which is louder with a faster pace than Brainy Baby, but they loved this.  Brainy Baby is really fascinating as it shows interesting mechanics including balls rolling, toys spinning, babies smiling, bright colors, etc.  There is a lot of ""learning"" as well with letters/numbers/etc.  In retrospect, I think I would have bought the left & right brain dvd's only, the others were good but those were the best.

I am very wary of the negative impacts of TV on babies/toddlers and even older kids (my kids are now 5, 7, & 9), there are a lot of studies showing correlations between TV watching and problems like ADD.  However, sometimes a parent needs a way to get things done (or, when I had my second baby, a lot of the time), and Brainy Baby along with a few other select videos tided me over during those younger years.

I don't know if it will make a kid smarter, but I feel sure a kid won't get ADD watching it thanks to the simplicity and the lovely leisurely pace.  While not everyone's going to love it, kids are all different,I would imagine in some cases a baby/toddler who is used to watching faster paced things might not take to this right away.  It might be a process getting them to engage with this, as opposed to other shows that are flashier to grab a child's attention.",1370563200,3,1460,4.541984732824427

1693262,5,B000063UYL,"I bought this, and Left Brain, together for my baby girl when she was 3 months old. She LOVES these Brainy Baby discs! She pays attention to the program and even talks and dances to it. The segments are timed just right so that she never gets bored or her attention fades away. I am happy to play DVDs for her that engage her and teach her something. This is one of the better ones out there.",1357516800,,392,4.103896103896104
1693263,5,B000063UYL,"My 2 year old will reeat what she sees, colors, shapes etc. Any all three of my kids get a kick out of the babies in the movie, some of them have them rolloing on the floor laughing.",1355356800,,182,3.8157894736842106

1693266,5,B000063UYL,My daugher has been enthralled by this video since she was around 9 months old.  She is 18 months old now and still loves it!  It's not annoying and it teaches lots of great basics.,1323648000,2,181,4.142857142857143

1693288,5,B000063UYL,"I bought this DVD for my 7 week old thinking that you can never be too young to jumpstart learning and I love the video. It's entertaining to me and my son is fascinated by the colors and sounds. I will be able to use it for a couple of years because of the many different sequences they have. Intricate toys being played with, colors being painted, and several sequences involving cups being stacked inside each other according to size. The video is simply full of many fun things with a soothing classical score. If I were a toddler, I'd wish I were on the video playing with the toys or painting.",1299110400,,599,4.357142857142857
1693289,2,B000063UYL,"I have 11 episodes of Brainy Baby and this one is not the best when it comes to holding a todlers interest.  If I would have bought this DVD alone without seeing some of the other ones first, I would think the other DVD's were useless.  My 16 month old twin boys for the first time would not sit still for the first 5 minutes to watch this one and they usually watch all educational DVD's for at least 15 minutes straight.  I guess theyd are not Right Brain thinkers but they like other creative DVD's.  I just suggest not to buy this DVD alone or watch it first because so many of the other Brainy Baby DVD's are great.",1268092800,17,620,4.141666666666667
1693290,5,B000063UYL,"My daughter was 2months old when she started watching this video and it had her captivated, I was amazed. She sat through the entire video without so much a wince. But after two or three times she didn't focus on it so much, but I continue to put it in and let her watch it because I know it's for her benefit in the long run, all in all i think it is a great product.",1250035200,,368,3.8552631578947367
1693291,2,B000063UYL,My son (18 months) wasn't interested at all in this video. I think it looks well made and interesting but my son still prefers the My Baby Can Talk video and Baby Einstein.,1171497600,9,172,4.242424242424242
1693292,5,B000063UYL,"We have Right Brain and Left Brain. My triplets, who have very different personalities, liked Baby Einstein better when they were still in bouncers and crawling around. Now that they are toddlers at 22 mos, they've been enjoying Brainy Baby better. They still like Baby Einstein but since that only has music they just get the enjoyment of the pictures and music and such and the visual fun. With Brainy Baby, they are now learning because the narrator will say what's on the screen instead of just seeing it, so they are learning more now and understanding. For us, Baby Einstein is better for the infants, where Brainy Baby is better for the toddlers ages 1+ to start. But we love it! I didn't know they made more but now that I know I'm going to start buying the others! They love them!",1155168000,2,789,4.524475524475524
1693293,2,B000063UYL,"Let me start off by saying that I have higher degrees in art, art history, music, and Romance languages -- so I am an admitted ""art snob."" Having said that, I would recommend that you try the Baby Einstein ""Baby Van Gogh, World of Colors"" and ""Baby Mozart"" videos instead of this Brainy Baby video.

I find this Brainy Baby video to be slow, boring, insipid, condescending, and visually uninteresting; I cannot wait to put in something else. Wait, you say, isn't this about the baby who is watching it? Well, I first realized that it is truly boring (and not ""just me"") by watching my 6-month-old's reaction to it. (She is now 10 months old, and still does not like it.) She consistently snubbed her nose at this video; she did not watch it for more than a few seconds at a time and always turned away to find something more interesting to do. She has never had this reaction to the Einstein videos I mentioned.

I tried reintroducing this video every few weeks since she was 6 months old, thinking maybe she would grow to understand it better, but after 4 months of this approach, she still is not interested. However, the Einstein videos have captivated her from the beginning, and still do.

Here are the specifics that I think are the problem. The visuals are weak and not bold/colorful enough. My daughter is bored by watching the other babies play with toys. The female voice-over is distracting and annoying, rather than engaging and instructional as intended. The flow is not as coherent as the Einstein videos, which are broken into little themes that make sense in each video. There is no charm or sense of humor, like the Einstein videos.

No, I do not have any connection whatsoever to the Baby Einstein folks. I'm just saying that the Brainy Baby videos seem less professional and are not as engaging. If you're going to spend the money and spend your time watching a video with your baby, buy one that you and the baby will enjoy together.",1153440000,33,1953,4.587392550143266
1693294,5,B000063UYL,"I bought this based on the customer reviews and had it for about one month now. My 8 month old absolutely loves it and remains engaged in the show most of the time. I notice how she enjoys the children and the puppets when they come on.

I also have other Baby Einstein DVDs and the Brainy Baby series is so much better! I like how a woman narrates through the entire show  so that my child is being taught visually and verbally. Baby Einstein is more about just listening to the music. I'm so glad I came upon these DVDs.",1153008000,4,522,4.158415841584159
1693295,5,B000063UYL,"I just can't say enough good things about the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys.  I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old.  He loves them.  And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen.  :)  As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile.  He is captivated.  I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos.

And the toys.......he LOVES them.  ""Hello, Brainy Baby!""  They are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box.  I have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time.

We love Brainy Baby at our house.",1133654400,9,663,4.015384615384615
1693296,5,B000063UYL,"This DVD is mysterious..the opening melody will captivate your baby ...ours freezes as soon as the dvd is launched and his manages to sit for 20-25mins without budging to watch it.. the combination of soft music , colourful sequences , smiling faces and fast pace are enticing...Difficult to comprehend for an adult but has to be witness...You will like us - buy the rest of the series as quickly as possible. No other DVD comes close to it",1123891200,3,440,4.653846153846154
1693297,4,B000063UYL,"Our 17-month boy still enjoys this video, but we don't play it very often because it seems like it could old quickly.  It covers a lot of supposedly ""right brain"" activities, such as color mixing, image recognition, rhyming words, etc., however it lacks quality.  The puppet work is poorly done, and there is no phrasing of the music with changing of scenes (done so well on Baby Einstein videos).  We like the ""First Impressions"" series much better -- perhaps because they don't put on that they're the greatest thing since sliced bread.

It's a little longer than 1/2 hour, so if you need an extra few minutes for your household chores, this is the one to pick.  One plus which I don't know if they intended:  The ""ending"" music is the same about 5 minutes before the actual end of the tape...lets you finish what you're doing!",1122249600,4,829,4.605442176870748
1693341,5,B000063UYL,"Wow, what an excellent DVD! Since the first time we put it on for our 20 months old daughter, she has been hooked to it. This is an excellent DVD for kids starting from 6 months. Lots and lots of color and classical music keep the kid busy constantly. The combination of colors, objects and music greatly enhances their ability to think and relate to everyday things. I highly recommend this to all parents. My wife found out about this while searching for Baby Einstein DVD.",1095724800,10,475,4.534883720930233
1693342,5,B000063UYL,My son has grown up on Baby Einstein and was captivated by them but now that he is 22 months old and talking he prefers the the Brainy Baby Right Brain over any of his Baby Einstein. He will sit and watch most of this video which is a feat for him because he is very active.  I have just ordered 2 more of the Brainy Baby videos from Amazon and hope they are as enjoyable as Right Brain.,1089676800,7,387,3.8987341772151898
1693343,5,B000063UYL,"While many people are bashing this video, I seem to have no problem with it. Teaching your baby is the best thing that a parent can do. I only look to the TV as entertainment for my children, not as a babysitter or a teacher. I believe that is the problem with most people complaining that the video doesn't keep their children entertained while they do housework etc. Others complain that the voice is annoying it all depends on who is listening to it, it is not for adults it is for children. I own a large daycare, and I have had parents lend me their videos for my ""movie time Fridays"", and I have found that different children respond to different things. Children who are less hyper tend to keep their attention focused than their hyperactive counterparts. I believe that this video is a great buy for certain types of children, if you think that your child is a child who would like what is shown on this video then purchase it. A good way to find out about the video before you buy it is to rent it from you local library if there is a program like that in your city. Otherwise read the ratings, because unlike bad carseats, video responses vary from child to child. As far as it not being Baby Einstein, uh, duh, I think anyone who looks at the cover could see that. READ THE COVER.",1084752000,13,1291,4.316872427983539
1693344,5,B000063UYL,You know you have a hit on your hands when even your boys want to sit and watch this wonderful video over and over again! I pass them walking around the house humming the music and even asking for art materials to try some of the things they have seen in the video. Best educational video I have seen for motivating the creative side of children and it has motivated me to buy other Brainy Baby videos. Try it-you won't be dissapointed!!,1080777600,3,437,4.341463414634147
1693345,5,B000063UYL,"I bought the Right Brain and Left Brain series before we had ever seen any other kind of of baby video/DVD.  I had to write a review because my daughter absolutely loves them.  Once the show starts she literally stops everything and watches intently, stopping only to clap her hands and squeal!  She loved them so much that we ran out and got some Baby Einstein videos, which she likes but they don't seem to have the same appeal.  The Brainy Baby's are definitely more compelling for her and seem to be more educational than entertaining.
She began watching these occasionally at 9 months or so - she is now 13 months and still loves both Left and Right versions.  We are very pleased that we bought these - yes the effects are a bit low tech (as other reviewers have mentioned), but my daughter doesn't seem to care!",1075593600,5,818,4.4630872483221475
1693346,5,B000063UYL,I bought this video just last week for my 1 year old son and he did enjoy watching it. I also bought the Baby Einstein DVD(Mozart) because of the good review and I realized he doesn't seems interested in it. He prefers videos with baby's featured on it as well as narration. The Brainy Baby (Right Brain) is far more superior than the Baby Einstein and it's more longer. I strongly recommend this video to parents who are planning to buy one for their baby. And try to buy Sesame Streets's Kids Favourite Song. My son loved to watch it so much!!!,1074211200,,546,4.362745098039215

1693348,1,B000063UYL,"This video is SO bad.  It reminds me of the tunnel scene in the Willy Wonka movie.  The flashing and strobe-like visual effects are awful.  Each scene, picture, animal, etc. is flashed across the screen so quickly that no baby could possibly have time to focus on it. I'm amazed as to how this video has become popular let alone made it to market.",1068940800,19,347,4.390625
1693349,5,B000063UYL,"I come from a Montessori background and have very high standards regarding my child's education.  I am discriminating about what I expose her to.  The formative years are a crucial time in every child's development.  As parents, we have choices about what we present to our children.  Introduce your baby to shapes and geometric forms, and motion!  Show them examples of colors and the mixture of blue and yellow turning green!  Gaze into the clouds, and find forms with your infant!  In this video you can do all this.  See computer animations of a ball that changes color as it bounces.  Watch your child squeal as a brightly colored windmill toy spins two wheels in two opposite directions at once.  The video has a peek-a-boo bear, and has simple toys like a jack in the box, but also extraordinary spinning objects and shapes. As a toddler my daughter was enthralled with the brightly colored balls spinning around, apparently while on springs. Now that she is three years old, she enjoys the more cognitive lessons in the video (even though it is all review for her!).  It is a good primer for colors.  Also there is an introduction to shapes, rhyming, introduction to written words, and animals like fish, cat, and dog.  We learn shapes like star, square, circle, and triangle.  This tutoring comes in short segments and is presented within lots of captivating images. We learn animal shapes and common items like house, car, boat, teddy bear etc. A gentle voice introduces us to basic vocabulary, shapes, colors and asks fun questions about what we are seeing as well.  We see paint colors mix to make secondary colors.  The point is that there is so much education in this video, as well as interesting images.  Some of the images are so interesting they seem to hypnotize.  We see stacking cups that fit inside one another.  We see a puzzle taken a part and put back together.  We see the workings of gears, the way a ball spins, falls, rolls down ramps.  There are lots of smiley faces!  Be dazzled by droplets of water falling through a maze of pegs, and toys that perform a wide variety of all types of spinning and motion.  These are all visual demonstrations of motion and physics.  You will hear the names of colors as they are painted on paper and then see more paintings until one of them is transformed in to a real flower.  See finger painting and many art projects in this video that you can do at home, when your little one is old enough.  No longer do parents have to tolerate the use of mindless videos to ""occupy"" they young ones. This is not anything like what the competition has to offer!  We now have the opportunity to actually EDUCATE our babies with a video.  The child will LEARN something while watching this.  I have seen no other product on the market that goes to such lengths to inform and educate babies as the Brainy Baby products do.  If you care about CONTENT, then get this video!  This is a revolutionary product that gives you the tools to begin educating your child at a young age.",1058313600,39,3027,4.5914179104477615

We have most of the Baby Einstein series as well as some others and her favorite by far is Baby Neptune - she seems to have outgrown Baby Beethoven.
She is only nine months though so I will keep trying this video as maybe it will appeal to her more as she gets older. I would love for her to have more variety.",1056499200,,454,4.206896551724138

She is very interactive with it and shouts answers at the TV screen. It is very mesmerizing, especially for a baby. It can seem a little cheaply made, but it in no way takes away from the overall effect of the movie.

Some examples of the movie that my babies love: finding pictures in the clouds such as a teddy bear or a boat. She loves to shout the answers!

Mixing paint colors together to get other colors... really helped my 2 year old learn her colors!

Close ups of fun toys really tickled my 9 month old!

There are voices narrating the whole video, such as ""Look at the pretty purple flower"" and my daughter seems to really love that and it has gotten her talking a lot more and being more vocal.

A great purchase and VERY entertaining for the little kids and babies! I am very pleased. Also shipped very quickly and was packaged great.",1386979200,,1020,4.2642487046632125
