7476620,5,B016NVSB64,A lot of my unanswered questions were finally answered,1453680000,,54,5.111111111111111
7476621,5,B016NVSB64,"The Image Revolution is the documentary about the seven Marvel Comics artists who left Marvel to form their own comic book company, Image Comics. I remember when this happened to the comic book industry in 1992!  There is a-lot information on why and how Image comics was founded and all seven Image comics founders give interviews and share the thinking behind the Image comics brand.  Todd McFarlane, Jim Lee, Rob Liefeld, Erik Larson, Marc Silvestri, Whilce Portacio, and Jim Valentino founded Image comics in 1992!",1452988800,,518,5.08235294117647
7476622,5,B016NVSB64,"As someone who grew up with Image comics but was to young to be aware of all the backstory, this doc was great.  It was like having my childhood explained to me.",1452729600,,161,4.03125
7476623,5,B016NVSB64,I backed this on Kickstarter and highly recommend it. I'm not much for documentaries but a pretty big comic book fan. I grew up during the Image revolution. The interviews and old clips bring back great memories. There is even a pretty awesome bit about The Walking Dead for all the new age of Image fans. Overall it is a very enjoyable watch. I went in thinking I'd trudge through it once and toss it on the shelf but I liked it enough to watch it multiple times.,1445472000,4,464,4.284090909090909

7476626,4,B016NVSB64,"This is a must-watch for comic book fans and entrepreneurs. It explains a lot that I didn't get because I was a kid at the time, but funny to see how I was on the buying end of the bubble.

#1 best part is just how many people from the early days are in this and talk about it without any reservation, it seems.

I think some of the music was kinda lame although probably fit with the times somewhat.

The only other thing I would have liked to see is a short segment at the end on the modern Image beyond Walking Dead, because in my opinion they have been putting out the best books in recent memory. Saga, East of West, Sex Criminals.. the list goes on and on. Maybe they can do a second documentary at some point.",1482969600,,716,4.0638297872340425
7476627,5,B016NVSB64,"Really want to dock half a star for omitting Dale Keown & his comic ""Pitt"".  Otherwise, this film is amazing in telling the story of how these guys got to where they were in the early 1990s.  I was there as a young adult comic book collector at the time.  This film does a good job of pulling in old video & more recent interviews  My son & I were riveted to our seats watching this one.  Unfortunately this film does have some F-bombs & S-bombs...not an overwhelming amount but just enough to irksome to parents of school age kids like myself trying to steer them away from speaking in that manner (granted I spoke like that back then but things change)...just be aware of that going in.",1482019200,2,688,4.34375

7476632,5,B016NVSB64,"It's great to see these stars walk away from the mainstream to create their OWN stream. A lot of blood and sweat went into the making of Image, and you can see the payoff in things like THE WALKING DEAD. They're not done, though. Image is a hotbed of ideas, and I look forward to the next chapters.",1480636800,,298,4.155172413793103

7476637,5,B016NVSB64,"First I was surprised this even existed. I found it at the local library along with the ""Turtle Power"" which was about the history of the TMNT. Both are excellent. A few interviews has some technical issues and I imagine they may have lost some scenes here and there. Go see Todd McFarlane in the extras talk and the light just goes off. Lucky Toddy Mac ket going. I would love to get more info on Sam Kieth and J. Scott Campbell and those that died Nick Manabat and Michael Turner. There are more details that were missed like the Spawn Movie, WildCATS Toys and cartoon, Greg Capullo becoming the lead guy for Spawn and I'm sure various other interesting periods of the other partners' different studios. Perhaps each Image Partner could have his own dvd looking back at all the specific things that made them grow. Overall though it was exceptional. Nice to see the longer interviews as Bonus.",1475625600,,895,4.6
7476638,4,B016NVSB64,Great story. Very interesting.,1474416000,,30,6.75
7476639,3,B016NVSB64,Rob Liefeld's impressions of Todd McFarlane alone are worth the price of admission.,1472774400,,83,5.461538461538462

Awesome documentary",1466208000,,66,5.7
7476642,5,B016NVSB64,Showing how the hottest writers/inkers/pencilers/artists comics in the early 90s and why they split from marvel. This movie showed their struggles as young adults trailblazing something at that never been done before in comics. Its funny to see a bunch of kids basically explode onto the scene then throw deuces at Marvel and walk across the street to tell DC they won't work for them and are starting their own company. Informative and entertaining. I loved every minute of it.,1461542400,,478,4.9875
7476643,5,B016NVSB64,This movie was awesome.  Great documentary!,1461283200,,43,6.166666666666667
7476644,5,B016NVSB64,"If you were around in the 90's and into comics than you remember Image comics and the splash it made. How the image boys change the comic world and influenced the importance of the artist relationship/ownership of their own creations. It presents some real interesting facts about what really happen way back when. In goes in depth about what each one of the image boys created, what they did with it and what they are doing with it today. You also get to hear what each of them thought about what happened back than and what they think of each other today, quite funny to listen to. Really was worth the watch.",1459296000,,611,4.464285714285714
7476645,5,B016NVSB64,Enjoyed this documentary.  Tells the story of the formation of IMAGE.  Very well done and very interesting.  An important document of an important time.  Hope they can do more documentaries!,1457913600,,190,5.233333333333333
7476646,5,B016NVSB64,"A well made documentary that chronicles the founding of Image Comics and touches on what they've become today.

I really enjoyed hearing the details of the story from the founders themselves.

If you love comic books and enjoy learning the history of the medium, you should definitely check this out.",1457481600,,300,4.98
7476647,4,B016NVSB64,"If you are a fan of comics in the 90s, this is a must watch. Great content. Good overview. Worth a rental, but I would not buy.

I knocked off 1 star because the quality of the documentary could be better. The documentary genre of filmmaking has increased in competition, and so this one looks like it's a step or two down in quality. Some of the music is annoying and cheesy. Also, the general flow doesn't feel as natural as it should.

I did find it fascinating the different perspectives each founder of Image had and the competitive nature. A couple owners wanted only to their own comic (one book). While others branched out with a myriad of books and started swiping each others employees.

I wish this film dived into the potential reasons for the 90s boom (like the speculator's influx, the superior images in comic books vs. video games of the time, the role of the direct market and portable media). These things were touched on, but could use greater depth.",1456531200,5,969,4.557471264367816
7476648,5,B016NVSB64,"Amazing documentary! I brought this on a whim not expecting much, but i turned out to really enjoy it. I think the documentary was well done and goes into the history of comics books a little and how artists were really robbed of their creation in terms of profits (i.e. Superman). These 7 artists founded Image comics and basically fought for their right as creative visionaries to own what they create.

I remember being obsessed with comic books in the early 90's and even to this day, but not so much as when the comic book industry was experiencing a renaissance due to these amazing artists at Marvel that jumped ship to create and form their own publishing company. The majority of interviews are with Rob, Eric Larsen, Valentino, and Todd McFarlene. Jim Lee does have a few segments, but not much. Towards the end of the documentary i was a bit disappointed that the main focus was centered around the Walking Dead which i didn't even know was based off a comic book. I only know of the TV show which everyone loves and i haven't watched a single episode. Anyways, i do wish there were more interviews with other amazing artists that were part of the Image revolution such as J. Scott Campbell, Michael Turner, and Greg Capullo among others. However, i enjoyed this a lot and these were the guys who made me fall in love with comic books. Their art was all the rage and sets them apart from everyone else. There were never be pandemonium around comics like this again. Pick up and enjoy.",1455840000,3,1495,4.557620817843866

7476652,5,B016NVSB64,"Definitely a good documentary on the rise of Image during the comic boom in the early 1990s. Like many others I was an impressionable youth during the inception of Image. Guys like McFarlane, Lee, Liefeld and Silvestri were rock stars to many of us, and this film does an excellent job of capturing the hysteria that surrounded their departure from Marvel. Additionally we get to see some of the uglier aspects of Image including the horrible infighting that led to the departure of one of the founders.

I also really enjoyed the old photographs and video footage that was dug up for this documentary. Again, it provides fantastic context to just how big these guys where when they struck out on their own.

My only criticism would be that I would have liked to see some interviews with people on the other side of the aisle. A number of times we hear about the people who wanted Image to fail, bet against them or just straight up hated them. Getting to hear their perspective would have made this - already excellent - film perfect.",1454284800,,1035,4.619565217391305
7476653,5,B016NVSB64,I was there for the whole ride that was Image and I still managed to learn something I did not know about the guys who brought me back to comics and I have been reading comics ever since with a renewed love.,1453939200,,207,3.9523809523809526
8736863,4,B016NVSB64,"Shout is bringing the good stuff again. Watched this with my Prime Membership. It was great to see these guys and also her the stories behind what was going on then. Following this documentary, it sounds like I could have walked into their offices to intern at the beginning. it is appropriate to end this with Kirkman, because he is the greatest success and he couldn't have been, without Image. I like that they showed Erik Larsen's weird pencil holding style. I wish it were more in depth, showing more artists. I wish it would have mentioned Michael Turners death ( unless it hadn't happened by then).

Todd McFarland is the reason I started collecting comics and my beginnings were the same as his. the only difference was I didn't hit the artwork like he did. His early stuff was rough, but even then, his backgrounds were insane ( see the Spiderman cityscape he drew in his teens)",1521072000,,887,4.613924050632911
8736864,5,B016NVSB64,Got this and it played well in my home . Came in good condition with no damage to my home.,1515715200,,90,3.55
8736865,5,B016NVSB64,Recommend for all comic book fans.,1510531200,,34,4.833333333333333
8736866,4,B016NVSB64,"The very first comic books I ever read were McFarlane's Amazing Spider-Man issues. I followed his career closely, because I thought his artwork was the absolute BEST on the market. Naturally, when he abandoned Marvel to form Image, I abandoned Marvel as well. Image comics became my single source of comic book entertainment in the 90's. I have a lot of respect for McFarlane. He's a super talented man and a business genius. Having said that, I've always found it a bit hard to listen to him speak, because he has zero modesty. His ego is out of control. I guess he's earned the right to act that way... but it seems kind of jerky to me. Anyway, this documentary is a good look at the founding of Image (though it's clearly one-sided. You don't really get Marvel or DC's input on the matter... and that would've been fascinating). Also, there's a bit of revisionist history going on here... like when Rob Liefeld tells the story of how Todd yelled at everyone for publishing their comics late. Rob says something like, ""Todd was the only one meeting deadlines."" That's BS! I was an avid reader of Spawn, and that comic was notoriously late all the time. That's partially why Todd hired Greg Capullo to help carry the work load. Anyway, I'd recommend comic fans of all ages watch this documentary.",1502496000,,1297,4.643478260869565
8736867,5,B016NVSB64,"I knew a little bit about the Image story, but this really brought it all together. All in one place. Good production values on the entire thing. If you're into comics at any level, check it out. I think you will like it.",1499472000,,221,4.162790697674419
8736868,5,B016NVSB64,These are the artists that defined comics for the overwhelming majority of my life. I still bask in awe when I see Silvestri's work. These guys were within a collective all their own. Definite doc to watch if you ever picked up one of their books.,1498348800,,247,4.391304347826087
8736869,5,B016NVSB64,I loved this story and I love the fact that it gave more power to the comic book creators.  It improved ownership rights and the industry has to give more respect and rights to the talent instead of allowing the Corporations to take ownership of all individual creativity that an individual will lose while under contract.,1492214400,,322,4.75
8736870,5,B016NVSB64,"As an 80's and 90's kid, I loved Image Comics when they first came out and still reread some today. The Image Revolution is a perfect study and time capsule of a ground breaking movement in the industry. The behind the scenes morsels are terrific and you get a solid sense of the personalities presented of each of the founders. Rob Liefeld comes off a little more sympathetic as you realize he was just a 21 year old kid who made his dreams come true, sue him if he didn't know how to handle the success. People give Image crap for being all flash but the stories are pretty intricate, expansive and make you want to get up and do something. This documentary was incredibly insightful and inspiring, I just wish it were longer.",1487376000,,728,4.440298507462686
8736871,5,B016NVSB64,Great documentary can remember those days like they were yesterday!,1486166400,,67,5.8
8736872,5,B016NVSB64,"I was not expecting this documentary to give the full honest story of what happened back in the nineties that rocked the comicbook world at that time. I was a fan of many of the creators who left Marvel to found IMAGE COMICS. They were rock stars in that tumultuous time. I didn't know the full story of what went down and I remember feeling excited about the beginning and then not feeling great about what they were producing on their own. I even disliked some of them. But that was because I didn't know what they were going through. I think some of what they were producing actually hurt comics at that time, with the exception of Todd McFarlane who continued to keep the quality going. But thankfully what IMAGE was at that time is no longer the case. They stand for quality and for creators rights and that's what matters to me the most. But what they did took guts and I admire their courage.
Most of the stuff produced from that time, again with the exception of SPAWN from Todd McFarlane, was regurgitated junk. I have comicbook boxes full of the early years and I just look at them and shake my head. Even the weakest stuff from Marvel and DC is still a pleasure to see from those days compared to IMAGE's books. But this documentary was excellent and everyone involved was honest and I respect that. But because of those original seven we have the great producer of comics that IMAGE COMICS is today.",1485820800,,1411,4.4517374517374515
