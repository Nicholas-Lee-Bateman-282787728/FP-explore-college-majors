5974283,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"He's funny, self-deprecating and just plain awesome. Some language not suitable for younger kids, but nothing that they haven't heard before in action movies. Craig is very open and honest about everything in his life and his opinion is ""this is how I am, take it or leave it"".",1387152000,3,277,4.673469387755102

5974293,4,B00FBQ38VQ,The item description should be better. I like Craig Ferguson so I enjoyed the lengthy interviews but it is unclear what he is being interviewed for and what he is promoting. It was a confusing construct but Craig is hilarious anyway!,1459209600,,233,4.7073170731707314
5974294,4,B00FBQ38VQ,"A bit outdated but still informative.  Mostly an interview, occurs shortly after his trip to Scotland with Ariel Tweeto that was made into a week of episodes.",1457308800,,158,4.851851851851852

5974302,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"A fascinating view into one of the most creative minds in show business today. The second interview in NY is better than the one in LA, but they are both excellent.",1433721600,,164,4.32258064516129
5974303,2,B00FBQ38VQ,The interview was out of context.  They were talking about a TV show that was not explained in by the interviewer.,1433721600,,114,4.428571428571429

5974310,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"A fantastic set of interviews of a great interviewer. Craig Ferguson is my favorite comedian and jack of all trades (writer, actor, critic, host, director). I truly enjoyed this content and decided that a personal copy is a must have.",1423526400,,234,4.875
5974311,4,B00FBQ38VQ,"I bought this because we liked to watch ""The Late, Late Show with Craig Ferguson"" which is no longer on the air because Craig has now left and a new host will be on in March (substitutes are on now - not so good).  So I wanted to see the interviews.

Craig Ferguson Paley Live - a Special two-event set - New York & Los Angeles Onstage May 10, 2012 & October 4, 2012.  L.A. 5/10/12 Lynette Rice Moderator Entertainment Weekly. N.Y. 10/04/12 Dave Itzkoff Moderator, The New York Times ""Coming to you full and uncut."" c 2012 The Paley Center for Media. 122 mins. per Amazon website. The interview from Los Angeles was under 60 minutes and the hostess was from Entertainment Weekly - didn't like so much - hard to understand her. (she kept giggling) The one from New York that lasted 1 hr. 5 mins. was hosted by a NY Times interviewer, Dave Itzkoff who sounded just like Steve Bucemi and was a better interviewer - they had good questions and answers from the audience as well.",1422835200,,974,4.4
5974312,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"Worth the price of admission to hear Craig be interviewed, as opposed to the other way around. Here's hoping that a more recent Paley Center interview, done shortly before he left late night television, will be made available at a future date.",1421884800,,243,4.809523809523809

5974316,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"I found this hidden gem and I was totally drawn in for the entire two hours. Craig Ferguson is truly an entertainment gem that is driven by what he believes in and his audience senses that. It's why his ""army"" is so passionate about his form of entertainment. Thank you to the Paley Center for this wonderful insight.

Amazon - keep looking for great programming like this. Will keep me a prime member forever.",1415664000,2,410,4.54054054054054
5974317,4,B00FBQ38VQ,"Craig Ferguson is one of my favorite entertainers of all time. I am not as much a fan of the comic or the TV host, as I am of him as a person. I feel that he is one of the most intellectual and knowledgeable people in show business who is not afraid to show his human side. I hoped there was more of that in this video but it's not much. In fact, the interviews are somewhat similar, so they seem repetitive at times. I think the first interview allows one to understand more about the dynamic of his show and offers insight on the people behind the Late Late Night Show host. The second is more removed from the show and allows us to have a small sample of who is the person behind the TV personality. It is an overall entertaining video, but the interviews don't allow much room for people who do not know Craig Ferguson.",1414800000,3,823,4.15

5974321,5,B00FBQ38VQ,Two wonderful interviews with the hilarious and whip smart Craig Ferguson from 2012. I've watched the Late Late Show for seven years and found out a lot more about him that I didn't know even though I've read his Autobiography as well. I really enjoyed this and any fan of his would as well.,1412467200,2,291,4.407407407407407

5974323,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"I really like Craig Ferguson. He's a genuinely nice guy. I was just heartbroken to hear his show is going away. I've recorded it and watched it for years. It's always a highlight of my day. This interview just kind of depressed me, s***......",1411084800,,242,4.5227272727272725

5974326,5,B00FBQ38VQ,I am a big Craig Ferguson fan and watched this based on the reviews I had read.....I am SO glad I did. It was great to see him in a setting where he wasn't performing and just chatting. I liked the first interviewers style more but both interviews were great and gave more insiggt into Craig Ferguson.,1408924800,,301,4.298245614035087
5974327,2,B00FBQ38VQ,"I am a fan of Ferguson but this documentary is a little too much about the inside stuff.  Too specific about certain shows and the stories don't really go anywhere.

The interview is immediately after a scottish shoot and it just mostly centers on those shows.  But if you have not seen them or don't remember them, most of the conversation falls flat.

""there was a fart joke that made me laugh.""  what was the joke?

""when he said in the robot voice ""I have a little place""  what was the context?",1408406400,,498,4.3478260869565215
5974328,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"A person who does not hold in his real self, we need more people like him. One thing that impressed me very much is when people in the audience would sneeze and he would stop what his was saying to say ""God Bless You"""" and then go back to what he was talking about like the interruption never happened. That is true respect for another and everything he does, even things done in jest, show that respect for another.",1407888000,,416,4.2784810126582276
5974329,1,B00FBQ38VQ,Boring as hell.  Where's Craig Ferguson - that funny guy? Blah blah blah,1406937600,,72,4.538461538461538
5974330,5,B00FBQ38VQ,Very real. Makes me admire him as both a person and a performer.,1405728000,,64,4.0

5974332,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"I absolutely love this man.  He is hysterical 99% of the time. Love to watch his nightly show as well and am very sad it will be off the air after Dec. 2014. His double intendre' comedy is like no one else. Letterman, Fallon & Kimbel only wish they could be Craig. What's even more astounding is the man does his nightly show unrehearsed, it is totally ad lib and ends up being some of the best TV I watch all week. I have purchased several of his DVDs and admittedly the language is raunchy, but really, it's not like any of us have never heard those words before somewhere else.  I bet this man could recite the ABC's and make it funny.",1404000000,,638,4.178861788617886
5974333,4,B00FBQ38VQ,"Craig Ferguson is always interesting.  Whether funny or serious, he's articulate and intelligent.  I love listening to him talk.  However, the Paley Center's presenters could have been better.  The guy in particular had a really annoying laugh that was very distracting.  At least they gave a microphone to people who were asking questions in the audience so we could hear what was asked, and all the questions were mercifully brief.  I'd recommend it but not without a warning that the presenters might not be the greatest.  (This is a combo package of two separate interviews, about two years apart, I believe.)",1403568000,5,613,5.00990099009901
5974334,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"I like anything that has to do with Craig Ferguson, but this was an especially insightful and inspiring pair of interviews.",1402272000,,123,4.904761904761905
5974335,4,B00FBQ38VQ,Two Craig Ferguson interviews that are interesting if you are a Craig fan.  If you're not a big fan you might find them a tad slow. Some interesting insights but probably won't have you ROFL.,1401753600,,191,4.457142857142857
5974336,4,B00FBQ38VQ,"Although most questions are the same, this is an entertains couple of hours. Filmed shortly after the show went to Scotland.",1400889600,,124,4.9523809523809526
5974337,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"Craig Ferguson is that special type of entertainer that you either love or hate him and his style of humor.

I Love the guy & his humor.

Whether you love him or hate him, these two interviews will give you a great insight into a genuine and real human being, who lacks all the trappings of the typical Hollywood Phony.

Watch and enjoy, I hope that you will.",1399248000,,359,4.25
5974338,3,B00FBQ38VQ,"If your a Ferguson fan, you will enjoy the 2 interviews he gives here. The first is on the occasion of his week in Scotland. Lots of technical stuff about the show, but also lots of personal moments are talked about. In the audience is Josh Robert Thompson (?, aka Geoff Petersen) and Craig talks about the creation of the Robot that Destroyed Late Night. Mike and Peter LaSalle are also present, and Craig talks about how they have guided him and the show.

The second interview isn't as good, and I don't know why. Maybe Craig is tired (he seems to have had a long day), maybe the interviewer isn't as friendly. But, it takes place just before the New Orleans Super Bowl trip. Most of the same info is covered, more questions from the audience.",1397260800,3,746,4.445255474452555
5974339,3,B00FBQ38VQ,A inside look at the late late show.  It's not bad if your interested in the topic otherwise i would stay away.,1396828800,,111,4.045454545454546
5974340,3,B00FBQ38VQ,"I was under the impression that this ""Special Two-Event Set"" was going to be 2 shows or stand-ups or something where humor is the main topic, because I have always been a big Craig Ferguson fan...and wanted some laughs.  Well, these ""Special Events"" are of some guy interviewing Craig about his life, etc.  I smiled a few times, just because I think Craig Ferguson is just funny...but this was a huge disappointment, I must say.  Boring, boring interviews.  I gave it 3 stars, an ""okay"", because I did learn a few interesting things about him I didn't know.  Other than that, a waste of time and money.",1394582400,,602,4.588785046728972
5974341,4,B00FBQ38VQ,"I just love Craig Ferguson and this video gave me info on him I didn't know.  He is not doing his act in this video, but it was very interesting.",1393113600,8,145,3.8333333333333335
5974342,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"I enjoyed this DVD.  It is just a conversation (one in New York and one in L.A.) with Craig Ferguson, but he is always interesting and funny and thoughtful and very intelligent.",1392163200,,177,4.53125
5974343,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"Whether he's in a sitcom, film, talk show, or late night show, I've always found Craig Feguson to be hilarious.  I'm pleased to say that both these interviews at the Paley Center were entertaining and funny.  Humour is subjective and personal, and Craig gets my five stars - and I'd give him even more if they were available.",1392163200,4,325,4.586206896551724

5974347,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"Seriously, what more are you looking for in a television show? This is great tv, with a brilliant man. Craig Ferguson is a breath of fresh air. The people that he refers to with distain as in the ""entertainment crowd"" are the reason that I stopped watching TV three years ago. Finding these types of shows on Amazon Prime is tempting me to pay more attention again. TV, and radio, use to be useful, informative tools for our lives. With Craig on board, they might be again. Mahalo!",1390867200,3,481,4.4772727272727275
5974348,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"This is a venue you don't often see Craig Ferguson--on the receiving end of the questions. He is a talented, intelligent, vulgar, funny man. You should watch his show, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and you should see him perform live. You won't regret it at all. By the way, he is also a talented author. Check out his two books, Between the Bridge and the Water and American On Purpose.",1390176000,3,397,4.4520547945205475
5974349,1,B00FBQ38VQ,I can't give a real review. I never got past the first three minutes due to playback issues. It looked like it could be good.,1389830400,,125,4.04
5974350,3,B00FBQ38VQ,I was very happy to find this video since Craig Ferguson is the funniest most creative mind on television. How sad that the interviewer managed to preside over a tedious rambling session. It was deadly dull. Felt sorry for Craig.,1389139200,3,229,4.75
5974351,5,B00FBQ38VQ,Both interviews were fantastic and informational.  Craig is the absolute best at what he does and these interviews prove why.,1389139200,,125,5.25
5974352,5,B00FBQ38VQ,Craig Ferguson has always reiterated that his late night talk show is nothing but honest and these interviews are a testament to that.,1388793600,3,134,4.869565217391305
5974353,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"I really like Craig as a tv host. He has a special way of interviewing. If you've ever seen his Late Late Show, you know he doesn't go by the ""interview rules"". He tears up the cards with the pre-arranged questions, topics and engages the guest in a more interesting way. To get to see Craig interviewed is something I think most of his fans appreciate. He is a very bright, very insightful man. He is very honest but not rude. I've seen him many times perform his stand up and really enjoy them. I also enjoy seeing him in these two interviews. We get to hear more about how he thinks and how comes to some decisions he's made. There is much going on in that brain.",1388707200,9,666,4.2109375
5974354,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"If you want to know what makes Craig Ferguson tick and where his unique combination of intelligence and absurdity comes from, you have to get this DVD. It's 2+ hours of laughs and awkwardness, sincerity and humility as Craig talks about his life and his sobriety and what will happen next (he doesn't know). I was fortunate enough to be in the audience at both of these events and I am forever grateful to the Paley Center for Media for making them available on DVD.",1388188800,8,466,4.4941176470588236
5974355,4,B00FBQ38VQ,If you love Craig this is a must watch! It is actually two separate episodes and not one two hour special.,1387670400,2,106,4.095238095238095
8614119,4,B00FBQ38VQ,"Craig is very funny , The interviewer in the first interview did a good job. She asked some questions and then just lket Craig do his thing . After that though turn it off as funny as Craig is the guy interviewer in the second one had an obnoxious laugh and couldn't seem to control him self he snickered at almost everything. he would start laughing and snickering like a child before Craig even opened his mouth .  The interviewer was clearly overmatched and sort of star struck by the whole thing. TERRIBLE",1512950400,,509,4.473118279569892
8614120,5,B00FBQ38VQ,"These are two fabulous interviews.  The title is misleading, however, this is Craig Ferguson as we, his die hard fans, want to see and get to know him better.  If you are a fan of Craig Ferguson you most likely know about his life story from watching his Late Late Night Show, from one of his books, or watching his stand up shows.  I found both of these interviews helped me understand that I adore Craig because he does things for a lot of the same reasons that I do.  Being honest about who we are and what we do, living life that way and not giving a damn what others think.  I am proof that it can be done in the Corporate world.  I was a fun, honest Admin. Asst. who didn't care what others thought, with no college degree, and I ended up in a short time being Asst. to many Exec's and to a President of a national corporation.  A great take away from watching this is that we should all understand is that we don't have to fit a mold.  We don't have to be perfect; none of us are and never will be.  We are perfect in our imperfections.  Be happy in being who you are, what you love to do, and what makes you stand out in your own way.  We should do what we are good at and what makes us happy.  I think that many of us can identify with Craig because he truly helps us see that it truly is ok and indeed fabulous to know that those things are true.  We all make mistakes but life goes on and it gets better when we can accept that fact.  In my opinion, for many fans; and anyone who has heard of Craig and wants to know more about him; this is great and fun to watch.  If anything, watching this makes me adore him more, if possible, than I already do.",1504483200,,1660,3.987878787878788

8614123,4,B00FBQ38VQ,"Any dose of Craig is welcome since he left the Late Late Show.  But I prefer catching old episodes of that show online and laughing all over again.

The second interviewer bugged me, and that's my only real criticism of these two interviews.  His laughed sounded forced to me, and I often noticed him checking his notes instead of listening to Craig.  I wonder if Craig quietly reacted the same way (I can just hear him saying to himself ""What the hell, man?!"") but was too much a professional to show annoyance.",1473033600,,512,4.532608695652174

8614128,3,B00FBQ38VQ,I thought this was stand up comedy but it was an interview.  A bit long winded and I only watched about 20 minutes.  Go find some Craig Ferguson stand up if you are looking for a good laugh,1469491200,,189,3.9473684210526314
