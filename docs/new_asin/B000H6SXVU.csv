2630188,4,B000H6SXVU,"This makes it one full year on my scale of SmackDown having great PPV's that are worth watching again & again...can't say the same for RAW but that's another story for another time.

Matt Hardy vs. Gregory Helms - This was a non-title match which was good because it actually takes away the doubt that Hardy was going to lose the match & it was nice to kick the show off with two hometown boys since they were in North Carolina.  Like I said in their GAB match, these two are great wrestlers who can put on a great match when given enough time & are allowed to & this is no exception.  The only negative is that this is around the 3rd or 4th time we've seen them wrestle each other in a few weeks so the match might look repetative at times if you've seen their other matches on TV.

Throughout the night, they had William Regal doing comedy skits with Vito and one that even resulted in the live audience accidently seeing his ""Big Ben"" but that's blurred out on the DVD.

WWE Tag Team Champions Brian Kendrick & Paul London vs. Idol Stevens and KC James - Eventhough these are the tag team titles, you get your fill of crusierweight action here as well.  Kendrick & London really work well as a team with the rookies of Idol & Stevens not looking green at all.  Again, another great match on the card...and staring at Ashley & Michelle McCool isn't bad either.

Now right around here...start pressing the skip button.

I think it was around here that The Miz came out for his birthday & got a quick lap dance by Leyla before having that fat male stripper come out & scare him away.  I only watched it more than once because I think Leyla is hot.

Montell Vontavious Porter vs. Marty Garner - A bad squash match...and that's not a good thing.

You can stop skipping & press play here...

The Undertaker vs. Ken Kennedy - This was a great back & forth match as Kennedy & Taker played off each other real well.  The ending might be somewhat of a jip (nobody pays money for DQ's & countouts) but it kept both men strong & keeps the fued going which I don't mind a bit after this match.  Taker needed a strong match after his horrible series with Khali & Kennedy gave that to him.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Chavo Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio - This was more of an entertaining match than a wrestling match because they mostly brawled all over the arena which is something you rarely (if ever) see them do.  But the only downfall was that it was the same type of brawl you see from everyone else when they go into the crowd but it wasn't bad.  Rey Mysterio won the match in the end...and that's something we haven't been able to say much in 2006.

William Regal vs. Chris Benoit - Benoit returned as a suprize & couldn't have had a better wrestler to face off with than William Regal.  Whenever Regal & Benoit are in the ring, you get a professional wrestling (not sports entertainment) clinic and that was no exception here.  Just a match you have to watch to apprechiate.

World Champion King Booker vs. Finlay vs. Batista vs. Bobby Lashley - This match was well paced with Booker & Finlay looking sharp, Lashley not looking too green, and Batista still looking strong.  The ending was done real well so neither man looked really weak & so Batista could once again have the championship slip from his fingers.

No Mercy was another great SmackDown PPV from the WWE...just skip the part of The Miz & MVP and enjoy.  I recommend.",1163980800,9,3425,4.372827804107425
2630189,3,B000H6SXVU,"1. Gergory Helms vs. Matt Hardy- This was a nice way to kick off the show. I wish the title would have been on the line that would have made it more interesting. It started out with some nice quick offense and slowed down a little bit to the pace of helms. Lots of near falls in this match with hardy eveen kicking out of the sching wizard. Lots of counters and near falls leads to a nice first match for me. Winner Matt Hardy. Match Rating 8/10.

2. Brian Kendrick and Paul London vs. Idol Stevens and for the wwe tag team titles- This was another good match. Kind of like the first one with lots of more cruiserweight moves in this match. Nice and quick to start off. I really liked this match and it looks like the tag team is developing on smackdown. A nice spots were londod does a sucide dive over the top rope to the outside. A cat fight to to end this one and lots of near falls. Winners Brian Kendrick and Paul London. Match Rating 7.5/10.

3. MVP vs.  - This was basically a squash match.  I tough they were going to through someone in there like boobyman who is not that good either or beniot but we get some no name on a ppv. Not a fun match at all andd not even good wrestling. Skip it. Winner MVP. Match Rating 2/10.

4. Mr. Kennedy vs. The Undertaker- This was a preatty good match but I was a little disappointed by it. I was not expecting to see a angle vs. taker match but I was hoping for a little better stuff. Still a good match and it looks like this could lead to a street fight or some brutal battle up ahead for these to. Just soild action at about 15 minutes but the ened was bougus with a dq. Some nice after match with tombstones to Kennedy and the ref. Winner by dq Mr. Kennedy. Match Rating 7/10.

5. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerreo in a street fight- This was a good match but was not was what I expected. I thought this was going to be a brutal battle with lots of blood but it was the exact opposite. It started out nice including a hurricanrana on the steel stage. It than broke down into the crowd and basicly satyed out there with lots of shots to the steel. A nice flying cross body by rey to end it but more disappointing than anything. Winner Rey Mysterio. Match Rating 7/10.

6. William Regal vs. Chris Beniot- This was a surprise. I thought we were going to get a squash match with regal vs Vito but we actually got a good match here. Great surprise and the bar I was at went crazy when he came out. Lots of solid wrestling here and while beniot carried this match regal actually looked like his old self. Lots of suplexs leads to a solid match in my opinion. Winner Chris Beniot. Match Rating 7.5/10.

7. King Booker vs. Batistia vs. Finlay vs. Bobby Lasley for the WHT in a fatel four way match- This was a good main event. I really liked the flow in this match. I was not sure if this was a no dq match but it was still good without it. Not a lot to say but a lot of soild wrestling and near falls in this match as it looked like the title could change hands on a number of occasions. Good match but could have been a little longer but I think it was good enough to get match of the night. Winner and still WHC King Booker. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I qould give no mercy 2006 a grade of 47.5/70 which is a 68 % which means this is  good ppv. If you can tell mw if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1161302400,17,3406,4.055059523809524
2630190,4,B000H6SXVU,"No Mercy 2006 saw the return of a great wrestler, Chris Benoit, The Undertaker got the last word in his match with Ken Kennedy, Chavo Guerrero and Rey Mysterio put on another high flying epic, and Booker T survived his title match that was changed from one opponent to three....

Matt Hardy vs. Gregory Helms:
Nope, this wasn't for the cruiserweight championship, which is a load of crap in my opinion. I have nothing against Helms as a wrestler, but the only reason he is the longest reigning cruiserweight champ is because he never defends it! Anyway this was another stellar performance by both these guys. Lengthy match that had a lot of back and forth moves. Helms gave Hardy a side Russian leg sweep off the second rope, then Hardy hit three Side Effects in a row and went for a moonsault, but Helms got his knees up. The ending comes when Hardy got the Twist of Fate and won the match. 8.5/10 [Really good match, here is to hoping the title will be on the line next time!]

WWE Tag Team Championships
Brian Kendrick and Paul London [Champions] vs. Idol Stevens and KC James:
It's a shame the Pitbulls weren't in this match, but these four men prove why the tag team idea is not dead as it is to Vince McMahon. Lots of good back and forth action; Kendrick and London both did dives out of the ring at one point onto their opponents, then Ashley and Michelle McCool had a catfight on the outside later in the match. Near the end London did a Shooting Star Press off of his partner's back onto Stevens and Kendrick got the win to help retain the titles. 8/10 [Nice match]

Montell Vontavious Porter vs. Marty Garner:
Can we say squash match? The fans in the arena didn't like it either and started chanting, ""Boring."" Less than five minutes of the typical jobbing match and MVP wins, big surprise. 2/10

The Undertaker vs. Ken Kennedy:
What is this, another non-title match? Kennedy is the most likely future player for the WWE, and he and the Undertaker did a good job in the ring. They fought back and forth with Undertaker focusing a lot on Kennedy's arm. At one point Taker was thrown to the outside and Kennedy jumped off the ring apron but UT caught him and threw him back first into the ring post. Undertaker hit his famous moves; like the leg drop on the ring apron and Old School. Near the end Kennedy bulldogged Taker's head into an exposed turnbuckle, but Taker kicked out. Kennedy grabbed his US belt but Taker hit Kennedy with it and got disqualified. 8/10 [That makes 5 straight years Undertaker has never won at No Mercy.]

Falls Count Anywhere Match
Chavo Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio:
Very entertaining match, a lot of high flying moves near the beginning by both men in the ring. They fight on the entrance ramp and Rey grabs a section of the set to keep from getting powerbombed onto the floor by Chavo. They start to fight into the crowd and both men were sent into a section of guardrail and Rey even gave a leg drop to Chavo's head on the guardrail. They fight all over the arena and Rey even used a section of the building to hit a modified 619 to Chavo. At the end of the match Chavo was leaning against a wall and Rey climbed a section of the seats and hit a big cross body to Chavo and got the pin to win the match. 9/10 [Very entertaining match.]

William Regal vs. Chris Benoit:
Yes! Benoit is back on Smackdown! This is what you should see if you want to see great chain wrestling with a lot of intensity as both these men work well together. Benoit delivers a lot of chops to the chest and a lot of headbuts, even busting Regal's head open! They fight back in the ring with a lot of submission hold attempts and blocks, but in the end Benoit managed to lock in the crossface. Regal tried to stop it from being applied, but had to tap out and give Benoit his first victory on ppv since Judgment Day. 8.5/10 [Glad Benoit is back, if Vince is smart he'll put the title belt on Benoit again...]

World Heavyweight Championship
Fatal Fourway Match
Booker T [Champion] vs. Finlay vs. Batista vs. Bobby Lashley:
This was a good main event. In the beginning it looked like Finlay and Booker would work together, but Finlay ended that alliance with a clothesline on Booker. A lot of brawling all over the ringside area, and even Finlay's little leprechaun made an appearance as he gave a low blow to Lashley. In the end Batista spinebustered everyone in sight, and then Lashley speared Batista, which allowed Booker T to come out of nowhere and get the win. 9/10 [Good match]

No Mercy isn't the best ppv of the year, but it is good for the return of Benoit, the Falls Count Anywhere match, and the world title match. Definitely worthy of checking out at least once, recommended.",1160438400,8,4701,4.43287037037037
2630191,4,B000H6SXVU,"No Mercy 2006

Gregory Helms vs. Matt Hardy

 I personally love both of these athletes and what they have to bring to the WWE. Helms is the longest reigning Cruiserweight today and Matt Hardy is one hell of an athlete. This was a great choice as an opener and sure did get the crowd into it. This match was a back and forth one with both Helms and Hardy doing their respective moves three times. The ending was an intense one with Helms going for the Shining Wizard and Hardy trying to get the Twist of Fate. In the end, Hardy hit the Twist of Fate to the pin.

Winner: Matt Hardy 8/10

WWE Tag Team Championship Match

Brian Kendrick & Paul London vs. K.C. James & Idol Stevens

 I personally thought that this was going to be an okay match. I was wrong however. The only thing that was wrong with this match was the inexperience of James and Stevens. Kendrick and London are amazing performers and know how to wrestle. There was a lot of back and forth action and I personally did not know who was going to win. The ending came when Kendrick did his finisher which led into London doing a Shooting Star Press of Kendrick's back for the pin.

Winner: Brian Kendrick & Paul London 9/10

MVP vs. Marty Garner

 No Mercy was the Pay Per View debut of Montel Vontavious Porter. Personally, I was not looking forward to this match and now I see why. Both J.B.L and Michael Cole was bashing him as well as  the North Carolinians. They started shouting out ""Power Ranger"" in response to his costume and BORING. This match was basically a squash match and if this is the basis of what MVP's matches are to be, then he should not even be in the WWE. Throughout the entire match, he was just showing off and did really nothing impressive except for his finisher which was a version of a neck breaker which was not nothing either.

Winner: MVP 1/10

Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy

 I have always been a fan of Undertaker since I was a kid. I personally think Kennedy is going to be worth a lot in the future. This match was a lengthy one and was well done. There was a lot of wrestling and a lot of holds that wore down the Undertaker due to Kennedy. I believe that he held is own and that definitely he should get a well deserved push. Not a lot of people and go toe to toe with the Undertaker like Kennedy did, but he proved that he has what it takes to go to the top. The ending came about when Kennedy brought in the U.S. Championship and was going to hit the Undertaker, however, Undertaker ended up with the belt and hit Kennedy over the head with it causing a disqualification. After the match, Undertaker tombstoned both Kennedy and Charles Robinson.

Winner: Mr. Kennedy by Disqualification 7/10

Falls Count Anywhere

Chavo Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio

 Both of these competitors are amazing in every match that they are placed in. However, I felt that this match could have been a little bit better. If you are expected high flying, you are not going to get much of that. Even though there was little of that, it was more a hit and quit match. I for one was personally cheering for Chavo. Chavo does deserve a lot and he does go unrecognized for it. However, the match was generally good. It did spill out into the crowd within the first 5 minutes of the match. They were all over the place with Chavo dominating most of the match. The end came when Rey did the 619 around some stairs and then did a flying cross body onto Chavo, which to me the ending seemed premature which is why I gave this match a lower rating.

Winner: Rey Mysterio 7/10

William Regal vs. Chris Benoit

 I personally loved this watch on the basis that this was pure old school wrestling, which is something we do not get to see everyday. Also, it was great to see Chris Benoit back in the ring. This was basically a filler match due to Regal being humiliate and Teddy Long putting him into a match, however, I really did not mind that both of the competitors were placed in a match at the last minute. Benoit is back and better than ever and it shows. Even though the match itself was slow, it showed that Benoit has no ring rust and is on his way to making on impact again. Benoit wins when he traps Regal in the Crippler Cross face.

Winner: Chris Benoit 8/10

Fatal-Four Way Match for World Heavyweight Championship

Batista vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Finlay vs. King Booker

 Personally, I think all four are amazing athletes with the exception of Lashley, who needs work. I knew going into this match that King Booker would win. Throughout the entire match, it was almost just a slugfest. It was back and forth action with Finlay and Booker teaming up to take out Batista and Lashley and then Finlay turning on Booker. Finlay can really wrestle and deserves more opportunities to show it. Batista still needs a little bit more time to get back into shape, 9 months off can do a number to you. Lashley just needs experience. The ending comes when Batista does the Batista Bomb to Finlay, then Lashley spears Batista and Booker crawls over to Finlay for the pin.

Winner: King Booker 7/10

I would give No Mercy high ratings. I honestly did not have high expectations for it, however, I was proven wrong. Out of all the Smackdown! pay per views this year, I would rank No Mercy number 2 behind No Way Out. Basically the entire card is definately worth watching except for that MVP match. If you do not have high expectations for it and just watch it for the entertainment factor, you will really enjoy this.",1160265600,3,5475,4.3837784371909

8137209,3,B000H6SXVU,"Matt Hardy v. Gregory Helms-- I never really 'got' this rivalry and what was so great about it, or even why I should care, but their matches were consistently average and entirely watchable. This is no different. The home town crowd really ate these two up and while it's not my cup of tea, it served it's purpose. **1/4

WWE Tag Team Championship

London & Kendrick v. Idol & Stevens-- I LOVE Londrick, but this was one of their lesser matches. It wasn't for a lack of effort that's for sure, but this was one of those tag matches that just when it seemed like it was going to 'release' itself from low gears, it never really did. This is far from terrible, just very average. **1/4

MVP v. Marty Gartner-- I love the whole concept of MVP's character. The absolutely terrible squash match was done purposely. *******3/4's. No really, this was a squash, * but still fun.

Undertaker v. Mr. Kennedy-- Yowzers, this was pretty great. Kennedy, while playing the semi-chicken sh_t heel for most of the program snaps a little bit and feeds it right back to Taker after taking a pretty nasty beating early in the match. Very similar to the Cena-Taker match at Vengeance 03. If you liked that match, you'll love this. Solid stuff ***.

Falls Count Anywhere

Rey Mysterio v. Chavo Guererro-- A year after Eddie Guererro's death we're still watching this crap. This was pretty entertaining and followed the stip well, which WWE matches tend to not do, but there's nothing really that really sets it apart from the average falls count anywhere match. Again, decent and consistent with the stip, but not anything to really write home about. **1/2

Chris Benoit v. William Regal-- Oh joy. William Regal stole the show in this pay per view. He got punched in the zoinks and then chopped someone in the head. Honestly, this was excellent and from a quality standpoint, the match of the night. I could watch these two kill each other forever. Great way to bring Benoit back and Regal is his usually awesome self. ***1/2

World Heavyweight Championship-- Fatal Four Way

King Booker v. Batista v. Finlay v. Lashley-- Easily the biggest surprise of the night. Everyone got a chance to do their thing and look good. Finlay's sections were particularly awesome. Lashley played the plucky and game green horn well while Batista looked to be entirely desperate to win his belt back. King Booker is... just aweseome in this. Just looking for any opportunity to cheat and retain his belt. Great heelish stuff. And this was the first time he broke out the pinky on the entrance... Oh, the pinky. Super fun fatal four way match. ***

Overall-- Loved this show. All I ask when I plop my money down is that I am entertained. Smackdown's shows, even when their matches stink, you can at least take SOMETHING fun away from them. Super fun main event, great Kennedy-Taker match and we also got treated to Benoit-Regal without knowing about it prior to.

3 1/2 star match. Fast paced and really competitive, with some good false endings. Starts off a little slow, but by the end of this match I was hooked. Hats off to Hardy and Helms for also pulling off some innovative moves. It's good to see these two get a proper amount of time to show how they can operate together.

London & Kendrick (C) vs. James & Stevens for the Tag Team Titles

2 1/4 star match. This is actually a very basic tag match, but London & Kendrick are always fun to see go to action in the ring. KC James and Idol Stevens have potential as a team, though it now being a few months since this PPV originally aired, I can say that James and Stevens haven't done much since, unfortunately.

MVP's debut match vs. Some jobber

DUD. This wasn't much of a match. Pretty much just a squash, but still not a very entertaining one. However, this is MVP's first in ring appearance, which may be worth something seeing as MVP has gone on to show some actual in ring talent (which isn't displayed much here), and looks to have quite a future ahead of him.

Mr. Kennedy vs. The Undertaker

2 1/2 star match. These two have had better matches (including the Last Ride match they would have a couple months after this PPV originally aired) but this still isn't a bad match by any means. Taker's offense is actually pretty basic 'Taker stuff, which isn't really that bad, and Kennedy gets a chance to shine against an accomplished main eventer. The ending is a bit of a cop out, but it was obvious that this match was just the beginning of the feud between these two.

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero Falls Count Anywhere

A solid 3 1/2 stars. I really enjoyed this match. These two are pretty much guaranteed to have a great match against each other and this match didn't disappoint. It's fairly brutal, as FCA matches should be. Rey Mysterio shows some pretty innovative offense, modifying his signature moves like the hurricarana and the 619 to work outside the ring.

Benoit vs. Regal

3 1/2 stars. These two could have an infinite number of matches and every single one of them would be good. This match was a great surprise addition to the card. Regal and Benoit put on a physical, intense match with some nicely done moves. And it gets a pretty good amount of time, so you can see these two go pretty much full on.

Fatal Four Way for the World Heavyweight Championship:

Finlay vs. King Booker (C) vs. Batista vs. Lashley

3 stars. A really fun match. As with WWE's usual multi-man matches, you don't see all four men in the ring at once very often in this match, but each of the four men involved get their chance to shine, and none of them have disappointing performances.",1168300800,,2702,4.432323232323232
