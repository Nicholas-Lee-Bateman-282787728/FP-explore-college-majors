8488540,2,B005X9TLQC,"This wants to be the Blazing Saddles or Airplane! of 1980's slasher films but Psycho Sleepover bites off way more than it can chew.  The film is very low budget and has that cheap shot on video look that you get when a movie has a budget in the thousands rather than millions of dollars.  There's no way to create the look and feel of a 1980's slasher film with cheap digital cameras.  The movie also doesn't have the budget to do much to recreate the 1980's in terms of clothing, hairstyles, props, cars, music. etc--but does what it can on a thrift store budget.

Psycho Sleepover opens with a guy trying to get into his underage girlfriend's pants (the lead actress is supposed to be 15 but appears to be well into her twenties) but he doesn't understand what no means no means (this is the 80's after all--one of the few clever gags in the film) and turns out to be a psycho that she dispatches in a suitably gory manner.

Flash forward a year and this same girl is invited to a sleepover by several of the school's popular girls.  She's initially reluctant to go but finally decides its time to make some new friends--plus the other girls (one of whom appears to be played by an overweight man in drag, possibly a reference to Divine) promise to help her find a date for the big dance that weekend.  Meanwhile, an asylum full of murderous maniacs escapes and make a B-line for the house since they were given the address by their pervy doctor, who plans to crash the slumber party to get laid.  That should have been enough setup but the film throws in another twist that makes almost no logical sense, at least as its presented in the film.

Psycho Sleepover might have been able to overcome the limits of its budget and not great cast if it had been an inspired comedy, but it's more silly than funny--the movie made me laugh maybe three times total.  It's certainly agreeable and good-natured enough to be easy to sit through--I just wish it had been funnier.  The effort is certainly there to make a zany and densely gag-packed film and the actress playing the blonde queen bee among the girls tackles her part with unbridled glee, but the writing and comic ideas rarely match the onscreen energy.  This one is ultimately a could-have-been-worse time waster that might appeal to people who like their humor very silly (or to viewers who are very stoned) but it's one of those movies where the poster is a lot more clever and polished than the actual film.",1492905600,,2464,4.487695749440716

8488542,5,B005X9TLQC,"This movie is a comedy that uses the horror teen-slasher genre as its platform. This movie is not for everyone, but if you like intentionally cheesy, campy horror films you will love this one! It has a John Waters feel if you like his work. The lead actress does a great job and there are some hilarious moments. It's all rude and crude humor and totally over the top fake violence, but if you are a fan of that type of film, you will not be disappointed. Future cult classic material.",1451779200,,485,4.34065934065934
8488543,4,B005X9TLQC,"OK... This is a seriously crazy flick. If you're not into countless inappropriate jokes, ridiculously high body count, and literally no budget type of movies, then avoid this hysterical bloodbath all costs. If you are, though, you might actually like it. The ending is pretty messed up, but overall, this is a pretty crazy thrill ride for anyone who likes no-budget films, the Scary Movie series, and countless countless COUNTLESS inappropriate talk.
 Pretty fine flick, if you just want some popcorn entertainment and laugh with your friends.",1409443200,2,543,5.241379310344827
8488544,1,B005X9TLQC,the cover was better then the movie. I would buy it for a dollar.,1406332800,,65,3.7142857142857144
8488545,1,B005X9TLQC,They don't come worse than this ultra-cheap horror flick that tries to copy the slasher films of the 80's (like SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE) and fails miserably.,1359504000,,157,5.076923076923077
8488546,1,B005X9TLQC,I'd rather use this dvd as a frisbee with my dog.  Typical 'college-made' movie.....Waste of time and money unless you laugh hysterically at sub-B rated movies.,1334534400,3,160,5.153846153846154
8488547,3,B005X9TLQC,"So many indie films try to differentiate themselves by going extreme. Often that means lots of gore, or lots of nudity. Few films travel the road of Psycho Sleepover. Yes, it has its share of gore and nudity, but it differentiates itself with mega-doses of surreal humor. Sure, the sleepover plus psycho killer combo has been done before. More than once. This takes it to the next level. Not one, not two, not even three psychos menace our heroine Debbie. No, we get forty. That kind of genre excess epitomizes the film. Where we expect one or two things to happen, twice as many happen instead. It leads to a level of surreality that's surprising in an indie horror film, and one that's appreciated.",1325116800,18,700,4.653225806451613
8488548,5,B005X9TLQC,"The best part of this movie is Jim Martin.

Period.

The scantily clad women don't hurt it either :)

I recommend!",1323734400,10,114,4.333333333333333
8488549,5,B005X9TLQC,"Listen, I'm not claiming to be a connoisseurus of fancy motion pictures, but this is a masterwork which may, in fact, be too good for human eyes. Psycho Sleepover starts, as many films do, with a title sequence, and ends, like many, with credits. It's the creamy middle that makes this blood splattering art house picture one the whole family can leave the room during. But don't take my word for it!",1323734400,11,400,4.569444444444445
