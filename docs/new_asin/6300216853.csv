260497,4,6300216853,"Well, while everyone else was repeating the lyrics to all those obnoxious songs by the Gibb Sisters, my funky bunch was doing it decadent thing and  frequenting altered states, whereupon we walked into this film one night on  Christmas Eve, and stumbled out in catatonic shock.  In retrospect, it's  got 70s written all over it, but it was one of those films that happens to  presage things to come... bad things to come.  Yeah, disco was fun, babes,  but we was flying without compasses lots of time, and the drives of the  unconscious combined with the wild variables of the world put the death  knell to more than a few.
Richard Brooks made some decent films in his  time, and GOODBAR is  a solid outing.  Keaton excels, Fraker's  cinematography is dead-on, and the R&B/disco soundtrack is superior to  that other film of this moment with Travolta.  I don't think the tone is as  conservative and moralistic and some may contend: you play fast and loose  in a big city and bad things can and do happen (its dangerous enough in  surburbia).
Then there's the ending.  My God. The ending.  You will  never perceive the disco experience the way you used to after watching this  strobe light die out.
In the words of the title theme, Don't Ask to Stay  Until Tommorrow.",966556800,3,1267,4.633484162895928
260498,1,6300216853,"This movie made me so angry, all that i can say is a script this moralistic, conservative and downright offencive deserves to be made into a  movie as disgracefull and amature as this.  Keaton is as always amazing but  she aint enough to save this pile of lecturous cheap schlock.
Do yourself  a favour and avoid this movie like the plague.",966211200,8,340,4.524590163934426
260499,4,6300216853,"This movie is an absorbing if skewed melodrama that takes a vicious, if expected turn in its final brutal moments.  The whole movie has a supremely sad, repressed feeling and look, though Diane Keaton is the perfect choice  to bring a zing and zest to the lead role.  The double life she leads seems  more than believable today, and has the sting of authenticity as it  unravels horrifically.  This film is nearly impossible to view more than  once -- the finale is that difficult to stomach.  Watch for edgy newcomers  Richard Gere and Tom Berenger; Tuesday Weld and Richard Kiley are excellent  in their more melodramatic, single-shaded roles.  The disco classic DON'T  LEAVE ME THIS WAY will never again sound playfully seductive to you again.",946252800,14,746,4.88
260500,5,6300216853,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, have watched it over and over. So many women relate to this movie. In the 60's & 70's, so many women were been raised very strictly, married young, had children,and found  they're selves wondering is that all there is? They divorced,looking for  what they had out on missed in life, while keeping up appearances at work  during the day, barhopping at night, often alone, looking for love in all  the wrong places.  I love true to life stories, and Dianne Keaton &  Richard Gere and Tuesday Weld were all brilliant.  This movie keeps you  riveted and the ending was how a real ""wake up call"" , so often  what happens in real life. One of my favorites, along with ""One Flew  Over the Cuckoo"".  I love movies with substance.",945734400,6,765,4.471014492753623
260501,4,6300216853,"""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" could have been a better movie.  It's still really good, but there are a few things that could've improved it.  The three rotating elements (Teaching the deaf kids, relating with her over  bearing father, and her new swinging life-style) didn't really seem to  ""fit"" with one another.  I have not read the novel, but movie  adaptations usually leave out details that may not seem important but  really are.  Now for the praise:  The cast was extremely well chosen,  especially Keaton in a stand-out performance.  The director also had a feel  for atmosphere and emotion (especially that of the lead, seeing as it was  told from her perspective) that was uncanny.  The sex scenes felt right and  expressed Theresa's yearning that would not be fulfilled, not just added  for thrills.  The final scene was simply amazing.  It was just so  fantastically done, I can't praise it enough.  It was chilling and a  morality lesson at the same time.  On another note, the soundtrack was  AWESOME (Diana Ross, Thelma Houston...)  See this movie if you like film  that makes you think twice.",930355200,10,1105,4.875
260502,2,6300216853,"Depressing look into the life of a girl who doesn't know what she wants in her life, other than to be free, and not understanding what free is.

260543,5,6300216853,i am so eager for Amazon. to sell this movie I saw it a long long time ago when I turned. 18 I was always cautious afyer viewing love love love this flick,1474761600,2,154,3.696969696969697
260544,5,6300216853,"I first saw this film when it was released in theatres in 1977. I was 13 years old. In those days, an underage kid could easily get into an R-rated movie alone or with one's friends, at least at our neighborhood theatre. Our divorced mom routinely took us to see R-rated movies while growing up in Los Angeles during what was American cinema's golden age as it pertained not so much to technical experimentation, but the exploration of social issues, a period dubbed New Hollywood. At that time, film noir and movies from the British New Wave were routinely shown on television. As a result, I was accustomed to adult-themed movies and early on developed a taste for quality filmmaking. Dark, suspenseful, and at times shocking, this film, directed by Richard Brooks and starring Diane Keaton, deals with both the sexual revolution and women's liberation as experienced by one young, educated woman living in New York City. It features Richard Gere in an early cinematic turn and a very young Levar Burton, still riding the wave of Roots fame. One of my favorites, this film is a now-obscure must see.",1467158400,,1101,4.8
260545,5,6300216853,"Maybe its because I first saw this when I was a teenager that it had such a strong impact on me. But from the first viewing there were scenes and images burned into my consciousness in a way that few movies have. Looking on the internet, I was surprised to see that the majority of critics were lukewarm on this, and some downright hated it, So Im an outlier, because all these years later I still find it a powerful, tremendously well-made cinematic experience, with a great central performance by Diane Keaton, and terrific support from Richard Gere (this debut is still one of his 2 or 3 best roles), Tuesday Weld, William Atherton, Tom Berenger and Richard Kiley.

The fantasy sequences - often the target of scorn - work beautifully for me. Yes they can be momentarily confusing  is this real?, but to me they establish that the whole film is a subjective experience. The lead character gets carried away mixing fantasy and reality, so we do too. This story isn't objective truth, its one womans attempt to meld her dark and light sides, her need to be selfish and her need to give, her need to be loved and her need to distance, her need for sex, but her fear of intimacy, all springing from a screwed up childhood -- as most of our problems do.

Many criticized the family scenes as being over the top, but again, this is her subjective experience. Who among us don't make members of our family even bigger monsters than they really are?

(mild general spoilers ahead)

There are flaws. Brooks breaks this subjective approach at a key moment in the film, and it hurts the internal structure badly, giving credence to those who say (wrongly I think) that this is a morality picture about a woman who was asking for it. That would be awful, akin to a film blaming a rape victim for dressing provocatively. But I never feel Brooks moralizing against his heroine. She may be messed up, but shes trying to find her way through the rabbit hole, trying to find some pleasure in a life that has been filled with nothing but physical and psychological pain, and in the pursuit ends up flying too close to the flame.

There are also accusations of homophobia, and those are harder for me to deny. In 1977 when the film was made, portraying gay characters in the dark, sad way the film does was common. But now it looks not only politically incorrect for 2016, but one could see how it could have fueled the worst of cliches about gay men at the time of it's release.

Yet somehow, as with the issues around it's heroine, I feel inclined to give Brooks the benefit of the doubt. Just as I don't see the film as saying 'women who are promiscuous, or enjoy sex are begging for violence' I don't feel the film saying 'gay people are twisted, or dangerous'. I feel like these are very specific characters at a very specific moment in their lives and in social history, and to generalize them into statements about 'women' or 'gays' - while possible - doesn't feel at all like the intent of the work. That said, I understand how others could feel differently.

This is a film that isn't pleasant or easy to watch, but much like Brooks even greater masterpiece ""In Cold Blood"", it goes inside the darkest of personal hells with a both a clear eye and yet empathy for all.

It's extremely frustrating that this brave and challenging work has never been made available on DVD or blu-ray. Apparently there have been tremendous issues around the rights to the soundtrack full of wall to wall hits from the disco/singles bar era. But I hope that a film that had real importance and value can one day find a way to be released in a format that will do it justice.",1461456000,2,3647,4.496978851963746

260548,5,6300216853,"I was a young adult in the late 90's when I first saw this film-the ending left me stunned!! And it stayed uncomfortably in my head for quite some time, I was around the same age as the character,newly divorced after miserable years from a teen marriage,.So I enjoyed my new found freedom as an adult,and some of my activity would definitely mimic some scenarios in the film. So all the reviews that pick this story apart and inevitably end with the basic assumption that this was a sad,misguided, desperate woman-with all kinds of psychological issues kind of pisses me off.
The fact is the first 98% of the movie could have been a romantic comedy-a young professional woman,establishing herself in a career and move to the ""big city""not ready to marry whatsoever,but still have fun-which for her included random one night stands,nothing uncommon there as I see it,Youth,mixed with alcohol,drugs and on occasion very poor judgement is a likely cocktail for disastrous results.
Without spoiling ot for the few that haven't seen it,all I will say is the last 2 1/2 minutes make the film SO NOT a rom-com.
This movie disturbed me on many levels-but hey! its just a movie...right??
Well maybe I am the last to know,but it is not ""just"" a movie. I only JUST found out,thanks to the Discovery ID channel that this is actually very much a real true story-(look up ""crimes to remember-the Rachael Quinn story"") So after seeing that I became curious once again -so I am debating on which book to read,the book which the film was based on,that changed some facts,and names,but left the significant parts from the book intact-or the later,after the movie,book written called ""closing time"" which perports to be the actual,factual story of Rachael Quinn,,
  Beyond the subject matter-there are other cool reasons to see the film,The look back at the 70""s style,music,attitude is interesting,
Also there's Richard Gere's first appearance on film,which clearly shows why he became a super star. And of course Dianne Keaton,who's only other movie I had seen at the time was Annie Hall,which I liked -but her character was so flaky,so to see her do  ""goodbar"" was surprising,All in all an entertaining film,which zig zags around a bit-with flash backs-and thankfully there are quite a few comical moments,(see Richard Gere again)all the better to keep you off kilter,till the director takes you almost to the end credits before the twisted ending-a complete jaw dropper,",1449273600,,2455,4.953883495145631

It just doesn't have the depth or brilliance of a great screenplay to carry the weight of the praise for it - which disturbingly, mainly comes from men. It's deeply unpleasant, and as shallow as it seemed back then. And reading between the lines of some of the comments here, some people are really getting off on this.

film's point of view with a complex plot with defiance and false confidence on the part of
Diane Keaton acting her best role ever. I admire her in many other comedy roles and love
her in her dramatic role in a film called Interiors. Richard Brooks casting of Tuesday Weld
and Richard Gere was genius and compliments the complex times of rebellion and individuality
of the decade. The realism of the pleasure seeking consequences of bars and social scene

260616,5,6300216853,"Reading other reviews it strikes me no one notices that Theresa Dunn takes the path she takes because her childhood illness made her unable to have children.  Since she feels like she can't have the ideal American dream family life, she focuses on children through her job.  It's not that she's ""looking for love in all the wrong places"", it's that she feels fate has made love and family an impossibility for her.  ie For a traditional catholic, what man would love a woman who can't give him children?  That's why her life so resembles the life of gay people in the 70's, denied the possibility of being accepted as ""normal"", they create a world of secret pleasures.  For me this was a great way to show gay life with a sympathetic straight character.  And also if course it is a really well made, original, riveting film with fantastic actors.

Another thing is the ending.  The director takes some liberties with the book, so I choose to believe the ending was meant to be ambiguous.  Earlier we see Theresa use paranoid fantasy (like the drug bust) to make changes in her life.  The drug bust fantasy was her decision to stop using drugs.  The final scene could have been her fantasy marking the end of her promiscuous sexual adventures.  In fact people have crazy anonymous sex all the time without any ""Goodbar"" or ""Cruising"" serial killers.  I think both films are about far more than demonizing promiscuity.",1410566400,3,1416,4.684210526315789

It is an ultimately downbeat but somewhat realistic portrayal of a woman finding herself and moving further away from her dreams. The cast is fantastic as there are many familiar faces including Levar Burton (Star Trek: TNG, Reading Rainbow) as a young tough. It is surprising to see it out of print with little hope for a Blu-ray. Paying royalties for the music in this movie has been the primary roadblock to wide distribution.

$199 is a bit much for this great film. If you can rent or buy a used copy this film is worth viewing. A Blu-ray with 3 hours of bonus supplements would be superb but seems very unlikely at the present time.",1379548800,4,703,4.4921875

260650,5,6300216853,"Even today, this movie that made a statement on the debauchery of the seventies, is still relevant. The story of a young lady out on her own for the first time, free from her morality preaching catholic dad and hungry to indulge in the night life. A frequenter of the area bar scene, Dianne Keaton in perhaps her sexiest, if not most provocative role hops from dive to dive, man to man in an attempt to whet her insatiable sexual appetite. An interesting, if dark look at the bar scene and all its unpredictability. Directed with a style of its own, and a good eye for character development, ""Goodbar"" is an excellent film - one of the best of the seventies. It's also one of the most chilling endings of any movie I've ever seen - one that leaves you almost gasping. Much of the subject matter of this film won't have the same shocking effect it had upon it's original release in the mid-seventies. Today's premium cable original programming (eg. ""Queer as Folk) make this minor league stuff by comparison. But that doesn't make this movie any less disturbing. This is still a movie that is just as applicable to today's careless adventures into the night life. Tuesday Weld, Tom Berenger, Richard Kiley, Levar Burton and William Atherton (""Die Hard's"" pain in the butt news reporter) are perfectly cast and make notable contributions. And Richard Gere in one of his earliest roles gives a performance that surely got him future roles.",1373328000,4,1436,4.7023809523809526

It was a great movie when it was released and it still is some 30 years later.  Diane Keaton plays a very misunderstood daughter coming from a somewhat dysfunctional, very strict Catholic family.  This misunderstanding manifests through drugs and promiscuity resulting in some very bad situations for our heroine.  In the end her judgment being very clouded evidently from all the drug use and abuse, she makes a very bad decision and finds herself at the mercy of yet another ""misunderstood"" maniacal killer just waiting to vent his frustrations.

Diane Keaton turns in a solid, admirable performance as the lead character - an insecure woman who turns to one-night stands with seedy men encountered in seedy bars in seedy lower Manhatten neighborhoods for validation and affection.

This an important depiction of the darker side of the Women's Movement: the negative effect of multiple, casual sexual encounters outside of marriage leading not to empowerment and pleasure but rather to emptiness and, in this case, horrific tragedy. While birth control allowed women sexual freedom it did not lead to only positive results - here, we see a woman choosing to be sexually free only to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous men. And, in the end she is the victim of unspeakable tragedy.

The scenes of 1970's New York are gritty and realistic; the casting is spot-on; the writing is solid as well - all though sometimes too literal especially in the case of the main character's father.

The soundtrack is a true ""blast from the past"" with - among other classic songs of the era - sultry, memorable tunes from Donna Summer in the days before she hit the pop charts.

This movie explores the dark side of human nature and how evil can dwell within anyone regardless to race, religion, status, or looks of the stereo typical homicidal killer...

Richard Gere is excellent as the A-typical barfly playboy who is not grown up enough to hold a job or any other self sustaining adult responsibilities.. without using women as a way to support his partying lifestyle.

Diane Keatons role as the main character is a very diverse and complex lady with many sides to her nature...caring and patient ...competitive yet supportive of her sisters jet set life...a woman who is desperately seeking respect and approval from a father who openly resents her for having congenital scoliosis and liberal views.

What works so well for this film  is the truth within the  genuine psyche of the main character and holds strongly well in the sense that she can be any adult woman who is into the singles scene. The story line carries its weight in the stark reality of criminal horror that always plays out by having a trusting, innocent victim that seeks to send a very direct yet terrifying message in its shockingly, disturbing ending that puts  the viewer into the victims role...not your typical Happily Ever After ending..",1298678400,3,1983,4.7492711370262395

260715,3,6300216853,"""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" draws the viewer in with a spectacular title sequence filled with black and white stills taken from the movie.  The photos of Diane Keaton roaming seedy bars are set against a medley of disco hits - all of which sound joyous but have a melancholy undertone.  The entire movie is encapsulated in this rather extraordinary sequence.  Unfortunately, I think that's the only part I'm going to remember about ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar,"" an intriguing but seriously disjointed 1977 flick that seems to have a serious problem with sexual liberation.

Diane Keaton plays Theresa Dunn, who as the movie opens is in college studying to be a teacher for children with hearing impairments.  She is carrying on an affair with one of her professors, and when he leaves her, she goes on a binge of meaningless one-night flings.  Things begin to spiral out of control when she takes up with the charming but seemingly psychopathic Tony, played by Richard Gere.  By day, she's a caring, inspirational teacher, and by night she's a drug-addicted sex addict.  When the movie was first released, it was criticized for delving too far into and wallowing in the seedy aspects of the story, which is based on a real-life incident.  After three decades of even seedier movies, there's not much shocking about ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar.""  Unfortunately, without the ability to shock, the movie has to stand on the story, and the story is far too erratic in tone and message to make much impact today.

Even though the movie was widely disparaged, it did receive several award nominations.  Tuesday Weld was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress, and Diane Keaton received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress (Drama).  Weld's performance today seems a bit over-the-top and dated; Keaton comes across far better.  She was not nominated for an Oscar for the role, though, because this film was released the same year as the far superior and career-defining, ""Annie Hall,"" for which she won the Oscar.  The two films couldn't be more different.  Whereas ""Annie Hall"" celebrated a woman for being different, ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" punished her.  It's not a bad film, and I think it probably plays better today than it did then.  In particular, I'm a big fan of 1970s movies set in New York that show the ugly underbelly of the city, and this one does not disappoint in that respect.  However, the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be and mixes in too many tones for it to feel cohesive.",1271548800,6,2522,4.823255813953488
260716,4,6300216853,"There are plenty of reviews that don't have spoilers; I'll write one that does. This film is based on the novel which is based on the real-life murder of a New York teacher of deaf children.

Theresa Dunn is a dedicated, talented, compassionate, and much-loved teacher by day. She's a ""good"" Catholic girl who gets caught up in the freedom and excitement of the sixties and seventies. Theresa's first sexual awakening comes in the form of an affair with a married professor. This is where the film is perhaps most ambivalent and unsure. While Theresa is wise enough not to fall in love with the professor, knowing that he will never leave his wife, she still becomes attached and desires a ""nice and normal"" relationship. She is faithful to him and asks why he doesn't like to talk and touch after making love. She often asks him if there is anything she can do to make him happier. After the school term is over he leaves her, and Theresa suddenly changes. She becomes a barhopper who picks up ""bad"" men (uneducated, drug-using, promiscuous, criminal, violent), only wanting casual sex with these men without any emotional attachments. What caused this sudden change? This movie is all over the place about what caused it, and maybe it's meant to be a combination of causes? I was left guessing as to why Theresa became not just promiscuous but also self-destructive.

We are shown scenes of Theresa's repressive Catholic father. Does the repressed Catholic saint by day become an irrepressible sinner and self-flagellator at night? There are hints that Theresa's life as a teacher of young children is rewarding but not exciting. We are given glimpses of Theresa's active imaginary fantasy life. We are shown the physical and mental scars left by her childhood struggle with polio. And, of course, Theresa is in the midst of a sex, drug, and feminist revolution. I suppose that any or all of these things can lead someone to promiscuity and self-destructive behavior. But the problem I have is that I don't understand what changes Theresa from a person who cares to a person who doesn't care: from a person who washes her dishes to someone who lives in filth. We only see what Theresa does, but other than her fantasies, we don't get to see her thoughts and feelings. There is no other character to which Theresa opens up and expresses herself.

All the men in this story - even the ""good"" ones - are bad (with one exception, the older brother of one of Theresa's students, who is a very minor character). One man in particular, a social worker who helps Theresa with a student, is as mysterious as Theresa herself. He obviously has demons of his own, but I expected to understand him more, given how much of a role he plays. By the time Theresa gets involved with the social worker, she isn't interested in talking or touching anymore. She's only interested in raw sex with the various men leaving her roach-infested home before daylight.

The final spoiler concerns who kills Theresa. The movie sets itself up as a mystery in a way, leading you to guess which one of the ""likely suspects"" will end up killing her, and I changed my mind several times. I was wrong. The guy who killed her came out of the blue (or, more accurately, out of the bar). Theresa unknowingly picks up a handsome homosexual who had just broken up with his boyfriend. He can't have intercourse, either because he's drunk or he feels no sexual desire for Theresa. She tells him to leave, he gets upset, she makes some unkind remarks, he goes berserk, then kills and rapes her (apparently the violence excited him). I don't know if the real-life killer was a homosexual; I couldn't find any reference to that. If the killer wasn't a homosexual, then it would be interesting to speculate why Rossner would insert that plot element. The movie had a sense of inevitability about it, that Theresa was going to die somehow. There was a glimmer of hope near the end, when it seemed like Theresa was giving up her cocaine  and quaalude habit, but she continued to pick up men in bars (perhaps a more dangerous habit).

This film has a very seventies look, feel, and sound to it, but I would not say that it is a dated story. Pain and repression, as well as self-destructive behaviors, are alive and well today, and so this film serves as a kind of timeless cautionary tale. It is dangerous for a woman to go to bars and take the worst men home to engage in unprotected sex. That's almost as risky as being a street prostitute. I took away one star from this film because it doesn't really help us understand Theresa's character, even if it gives us a lot of ""circumstantial evidence."" If the movie seems a little too long or a little too slow, that's only because of the necessarily interminable bar and apartment scenes. Self-destructive behavior is seldom fun to watch. The most enjoyable scenes are those with Theresa interacting with the children, but that was not the focus of the story.",1246320000,7,4960,4.669336384439359

Some movies, you suffer through the whole thing, and then you get a really good ending .... but this one, you just get a crappy story with an even crappier ending.

260719,4,6300216853,"I don't see why Paramount is taking so long to put this movie on DVD, since most classic movies were already released on DVD a long time ago, since most people use DVD's nowadays instead of VCR's since DVD's have been in style since at least 2003 and VCR's have been out of style for the longest time as well as practically obsolete.

Additionally, LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR is a bitter sweet touching kinda movie that launched Diane Keaton's acting career and was probably Diane Keatons sexiest movie of all time too, since LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR shows Diane Keaton like I've never seen her before along with the fact that Diane Keaton plays a lonely sexually frustrated drug addict, down-on-her-luck school teacher(Theresa Dunn)trying to find Mr. Right like a bitch-in-heat by hanging out in bars, humping around, hanging around the wrong kinds of people and sleeping around with the wrong kind of guys, which lead to nothing, but trouble, grief, anguish, and heartache, resulting in a very tragic ending that even made me cry when I saw this movie for the first time when I was little, since LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR obviously didn't have a happy ending to it at all.

On the other hand, LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR had some interesting action and dialogues in it by playing popular hit songs from the 1970's like ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" by Thelma Houston and showing us life in the 70's, which was sex, drugs, & Rock & Roll, disco, etc.

Unfortunately as this movie progressed, I noticed that things continued to go more and more downhill for the plot, climax, and conclusion to this flick since things & problems had continuosly getting worse and worse for Diane Keaton's character, which is part of what resulted in such a tragic wasteful ending of LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR, but anyone who has been lonely while trying to find Mr. or Miss Right may have had very similar experiences before finally finding the right soul mate.

Therefore it just suddenly occured to me that the song ""Looking For Love In All The Wrong Places"" by country western singer(Johnny Lee)would've been perfect to use in this movie, but that hit song by Johnny Lee didn't even come out till around 1979 or 1980, but ""Looking For Love In All The Wrong Place"" by Johnny Lee was used in the 1980 flick URBAN COWBOY with John Travolta & Debra Winger.

This movie also had co-stars like Richard Gere and Tom Berenger, which was during their earlier days of their acting career before they were even famous.

LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 5 years old in Kindergarten when it was theatrically released in the Fall of 1977.",1228953600,7,2644,4.650963597430406

After some thought on the film, I have decided that I do in fact like it, although there are some scenes that will always be difficult to watch.

Looking for Mr. Goodbar is a film based on a book, which was based on true events of a teacher in NY.  Thrust into a strange world of drugs and sex by her sister, Diane Keaton's character, Theresa, becomes the ultimate party girl.  Richard Geer enters and exits throughout the film as junky/male bimbo.  The movie is definitely interesting and incredibly complex.  Do not judge too quickly, as you might not give it enough of a chance.  I am glad I thought over the movie before I ultimately concluded how I felt.

Last time i did- i lived alone, was fairly ""active"" in the bar scene and it was during the time that the Dahmer stuff was going on. Needless to say- this movie gave me more of a hesitant pause before bringing just ANYone home, that's for sure.

I mentioned it to my partner of 12 years and he said he had never seen it (much to my surprise). So i kept hunting and checking back at Amazon to see if it may be coming to dvd any time soon. No such luck. I've since written to Paramount asking them to please consider a nice, digital transfer dvd release of the film. Who knows for what good that was worth.

So- i go to my video store which has a huge, vault of a selection of just about anything. Grab the very ancient looking vhs copy to bring home to watch.
Besides the fact that it didn't look great- this movie is STILL as powerful, provacative and shocking as it was all those years ago when i first saw it. Even when you know how it's going to end- it is still jaw-dropping and brutally harsh and yes- even quite sad, frankly.
This movie will stick with you after you've seen it for a while. Sort of haunts you.

Keaton is SO fantastic in her performance. Just AH-mazing. The dialog and writing and direction are top notch and still not dated even with the advances that cinema has made since.

This movie needs and deserves a good dvd release. I will be first in line to grab a copy if and when it does. I am thinking perhaps since there is a HUGE amount of music in it- that maybe that could be part of why no dvd release so far. Sometimes too much ASCAP red tape to get a movie released the way it was originally shown. Not sure how that works, honestly.

Anyway- too long now.. apologies. Do rent the vhs if you come across it. You will never forget it. Or please write to Paramount and ask them (nicely) to please consider giving it a good dvd release. I'm still stunned that it isn't on dvd to begin with. Classic and powerful still to this day.

Too bad Diane Keaton's character didn't know of Holden's advice.  She would have gotten a lot more out her short life than a bunch of loser men and cockroaches.

I have to admit that Mr. Goodbar is more than just another high school Freudian anti male 1970s rant.  It's just not much more than that.  The self loathing Diane Keaton shows could have been further explored but any psychological study quickly gets drowned in a tsunami of 70s talismans -- drugs, orgies, female liberation, anti Catholicism.  Keaton herself is the only thing that even partially redeems this otherwise clumsy, repetitive, self indulgent, dragging film.

One other thing: the abortion scene with Theresa's sister is a lot of hooey and Hollywood propaganda.  Abortion was elevated to a constitutional right in 1973.  By 1977 there was no such thing as a back alley abortionist.  Politically motivated anachronisms detract from any movie.",1196985600,3,1064,5.068965517241379

260747,4,6300216853,"Looking for Mr. Goodbar (Richard Brooks, 1977)

The experience of watching Looking for Mr. Goodbar is a strange one, if you've read the novel upon which it is based; Richard Brooks has taken Judith Rossner's shockingly direct prose and turned it into a screenplay that combines the worst aspects of psychedelia and disco culture, coming up with a movie that's nightmarish, yet oddly compelling.

Looking for Mr. Goodbar is the story of Theresa Dunn (Diane Keaton), starting with an affair with a college professor, Martin (Manhunt's Alan Feinstein), and then continuing on into her career as a teacher for the deaf, when she gets caught in the middle of two relationships, one with tempestuous cokehead Tony (Richard Gere), the other with solid, dependable James (William Atherton, soon to appear in an adaptation of Jack Ketchum's classic The Girl next Door). Meanwhile, Theresa's also trying to balance being the goody-two-shoes teacher by day and a bad-girl cruiser by night, as well as being the Rock of Gibraltar, as her sister Katherine (Tuesday Weld) calls her, for her smothering family.

It hasn't been long at all since I last read the novel, and I'm trying not to let that affect my judgment where the movie's concerned, but it seemed to me that, despite the necessity of hacking a four-hundred-page book to pieces when turning it into a two-hour screenplay, Brooks (who also adapted the novel) did a fine job of simplifying things while still keeping everything well in order. While a number of memorable scenes have disappeared, the points those scenes conveyed remained, and the characters are as well-developed as they are in the novel.

There's really no other place to mention it, but it needs mentioned: Tom Berenger has a small role here, and it's easy to understand why Hollywood sat up and took notice of the young star. (A teenaged LeVar Burton, ten years before Star Trek: The Next Generation, also has a minor role as the brother of one of Theresa's students.) Add a who's-who of some of the best obscure tunes of the era (including The O'Jays' ""Backstabbers,"" one of the truly great songs of the disco era), and you've got yourself a pretty fine film. It's faded, unjustly, into obscurity these days. Rent a copy and see what you missed the first time around, or rediscover what should be considered a classic by now. ****",1172534400,18,2347,4.889447236180905

The characters are so much more complex than the movie is able to convey.  If I hadn't read the book, maybe I'd think more highly of the movie.  But knowing all the details that were left out just made it a little hard to watch.

The story of a young lady out on her own for the first time, free from her morality preaching catholic dad and hungry to indulge in the night life. A frequenter of the area bar scene, Dianne Keaton in perhaps her sexiest, if not most provocative role hops from dive to dive, man to man in an attempt to whet her insatiable sexual appetite. An interesting, if dark look at the bar scene and all its unpredictability. Directed with a style of its own, and a good eye for character development, ""Goodbar"" is an excellent film - one of the best of the seventies. It's also one of the most chilling endings of any movie I've ever seen - one that leaves you almost gasping. Much of the subject matter of this film won't have the same shocking effect it had upon it's original release in the mid-seventies. Today's premium cable original programming (eg. ""Queer as Folk) make this minor league stuff by comparison. But that doesn't make this movie any less disturbing. This is still a movie that is just as applicable to today's careless adventures into the night life. Tuesday Weld, Tom Berenger, Richard Kiley, Levar Burton and William Atherton (""Die Hard's"" pain in the butt news reporter) are perfectly cast and make notable contributions.

However, for this Richard Brooks, film adaptation of the Judith Rossner book , based on the true, series of events, in the life of Rosanne Quinn, I'm making an exception. Diane Keaton plays the lead , as Therea Dunn , an attractive, intelligent, independent, sexually curious, young woman who happens to be a school teacher. From it's riveting beginning sequences to it's unforgettable ending,"" Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" exemplifies great directing , acting , and writng. Filmed during a period when American cinema focused on character driven stories and themes..this film stands out as one of the most unforgettable. Originally penned, as a star making vehicle for Diane Keaton, the film highlights unforgettable performances by a series of future stars like Richard Gere, Levar Burton , Tom Berringer, and Tuesday Weld ( in her OSCAR winning performance). Although, ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" was originally released in 1977, it's overall lessons and character journeys are still relatable, today. On that aspect, it ensures this film a long shelf life. Some scenes are dated and the soundtrack is obviously past it's expiration date. However, after the first twenty minutes , you quickly forget that this was produced almost three decades ago. The characters are portrayed so richly and so authentic , that you become sucked into it. I don't see this film as a warning for young barhoppers or sexually liberarated women. Once again...it's based on a true story. So , how can anyone tamper with reality? The film sticks to the book and the book sticks to the actual case, that sparked the interest in the first place. The cinematography and script are excellent and Richard Brooks did a phenominal job, layering circumstances and allowing his actors to go to depths that most actors would shy away from. Personally , I used to think of Diane Keaton as just another pretty actress ( especially in her youth). However , after seeing her performance in this film , I will always consider her just as brave and creative and dedicated to her roles , as her contemperaries(Robert Deniro , Al Pacino, John Voight , Marlon Brando, ect.). If you're a fan of dramatic films, such as ""Midnight Cowboy"","" The Deer Hunter"",or ""Boogie Nights"", "" Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" is one that should definately not be missed. I'm not sure why it hasn't been released on dvd, yet. Hopefully, it will, as it deserves to be preserved and recognized as one of the best films of the 1970's.",1135641600,35,2529,4.938967136150235
260782,4,6300216853,"Diane Keaton stars in this true story of a New York teacher's sex life and it's consequences.  The film creates a great 1970s feel, with a soundtrack of the disco hits of the time.  We hear  a commercial for Jimmy Carter running for Pres., and in a post-modern moment Tony (Richard Gere) meets Theresa (Keaton) while she reads  ""The Godfather"".  They take this further when Tony says,""I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse"", and even refers to the film starring Al Pacino;  as most of you know Keaton plays Michael's wife.

  Tuesday Weld portrays Katherine, who ironically leads a more sordid life than Theresa, in spite of her father's (Richard Kiley) pleading to ""be more like Katherine"".  The true version of the story happened in the 1960s, but by the 1970s birth control/abortion wasn't as big a deal (at least to non-fanatics), so the doctor's surprise that Theresa doesn't want kids as well as her secretiveness seems incongruous, especially when viewed today.

  Most of the final scene is usually cut out of TV versions, so the shock value is lost...the Tom Berenger character may owe something to ""Psycho""...perhaps the shower scene taken to the extreme.  Anyway the film is well worth seeing for a look at '70s NYC scenes and attitudes.",1131235200,4,1255,4.830985915492958
260783,4,6300216853,"I have seen many films, but none have stayed with me quite like ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" has.  Perhaps it's due to the film's violent and intense ending?  Or the fact that the film is about a young woman seeking out anonymous sexual encounters in bars, and not being too picky about her choices?

Whatever it is, Looking for Mr. Goodbar is one of those rare movies that is still compelling viewing today.  It's not a perfect film, and it's one that polarizes audiences.  Some find it a fascinating study of post-sexual revolution single life in the 70s; while others find it a heavy-handed cautionary tale about women picking up strangers in bars.  And **MAJOR SPOILER WARNING*** the one major criticism of this film is that because of the lead character's fate, the film is suggesting that sexually-liberated women are ""punished"" for experimenting with sex.

The film is heavy-handed and by the last 30 minutes it moves from a psychological profile of a young woman to a frightening (and admittedly) gripping thriller.  But Looking for Mr. Goodbar is engrossing, and that's due in large part to Diane Keaton's superb performance.  Although Keaton won the Oscar the same year for another film, ""Annie Hall"", her performance in ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" is equally impressive.  She has the difficult task of making a character who makes (several) wrong choices into a likable and sympathetic one.  She also imbues her character with strength, sexiness, vulnerability and a sarcastic sense of humor.  Her chemistry with the other characters in the film (including Richard Gere and Tom Berenger) is strong.

The film also has a great visual look, and it's never more clear than in the last sequence of the film.  It's a hard scene to watch, but director Richard Brooks and the cinematographer create one of the most unforgettable sequences in film ever.

This film is very explicit and dark, but worth seeing, particularly if you enjoy Keaton's acting.  The film also has an excellent 70s disco soundtrack.",1130630400,10,2004,4.955089820359281

260785,5,6300216853,"This is raw, risk-taking cinema--from the no-holds-barred performance of a lifetime by Dianne Keaton to the bold and imaginative direction of Hollywood maverick Richard Brooks.  As depressing as the story might be to some fans of traditional films, its representation of one ""good"" woman's desperate search for the satisfaction of a desire essential to self-realization was previously ""taboo"" in an industry accustomed to portraying a ""bad girl"" as either a whore or, more commonly, a femme fatale.  Moreover, Brooks' film is revolutionary in its capturing the woman's point-of-view.  Previous Hollywood classics by Hitchcock, Ford, Capra, Hawks, Sirk, and even Cukor, invariably betrayed their patriarchal bias because of the persistence of the ""male gaze."" But in ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" we remain inside Keaton's head even as we judge her obsessive, doomed quest for personal fulfillment.  The sordid climax (normally considered death at the box office) is all the more remarkable because we see it through the eyes of the victim.  When desire and the death wish converge in the mind of the protagonist, causing her to lose her capacity to see, the movie necessarily fades to black.  (Small wonder the film generated much discussion among serious filmgoers.)

I was one of those so impacted by the film that I immediately read its literary source.  This is one of the few times the book has proved a disappointment compared to the movie. Judy Rossner's stiff prose and journalist style don't begin to match the artistry of Keaton and Brooks not to mention the psychological depth that is normally off-limits to a medium as surface-bound as film.  Anyone who cares about the history of film--especially movies portraying the woman's point-of-view--can only hope that Brooks' frequently misunderstood game-changer sees its way to Blu-ray soon.",1123372800,88,1846,5.316151202749141
260786,5,6300216853,"This is the second older movie I went to order in dvd format this afternoon.  IT DOES NOT EXIST and neither does the truly significant _Love With a Proper Stranger_.  The latter is the only movie made by Steve McQueen that has not been put onto dvd format.  Why?  It can't be because it was a dog of a movie because it wasn't:  Steve McQueen received an Academy Award as Best Actor for this performance and Natalie Wood was nominated as Best Actress.

The movie's ending fits right into with today's ultra right view of the world so that can't be the problem.  What I believe is holding this out of circulation is the fear by some that young people of the several post Roe v. Wade generations might see for themselves the absolute terror women of all races and clases went through when they sought out illegal abortions.  The Bronx shown in the movie is where the richest to the poorest in the greater NYC area traveled.

This movie is a wonderful example of a black and white movie  treasure and it would seem of critical importance to keep it alive so that people can see for themselves just what went on back in those truly horrendous days.  Certainly if one's personal views are ultra conservative I imagine you don't want to know about what was reality way back then.  Folks, however, who are trying to impose this on our society once again -- and for those who haven't made up their minds -- this is must seeing.

And no, I am absolutely not a left wing femi-nazi but I saw too many young friends edge very close to death because our male WASP controlled society wouldn't come to terms with abortion.

Mr. Goodbar brings women of the ensuing generation forward and it would seem vital for all young people to see today.  Right now our nation is searching for a probably dead Natalee Holloway.  Had she seen this and would that others now would do so, safer decisions might have and could be made.

_Looking for Mr. Goodbar_ was a huge box office hit so a lack of popularity can't explain why we can't see it in DVD format.  The gist of the movie is as contemporary as hell.

And those of us who are older and who have lived through so much change ought to do what we can to ensure that the polarized views of the politically correct and the ultra right are not permitted to stifle all the inbetweens.

260787,5,6300216853,"Some of these reviewers (the negative ones) are rather simple-minded as to the entire concept of the film. The one reviewer who mentioned the ""cheapness"" of the film simply did not get it. The ""cheapness"" was the entire point of the atmosphere as the allure of Terry's life and how she felt about herself. I watched the film three times and I am not grasping why a few of the reviewers mention how ""slow"" the film was. There was nothing ""slow"" about it at all. The point of the beginning was included for the audience to get to know and to care about the character. I am sure that the very same ""reviewers"" who complained about the ""slowness"" of the film would have just as well complained if the beginning scenes had not explained the character's story. Some of the reviewers are very mature (and that helps others to decide logically as to whether or not to purchase this film) and some are very childish (which really doesn't help at all in the selection process!).

If you want slasher garbage, rent slasher garbage. This film is for the ""thinker"" not the ""loafer"". It is amazing that the negative commentaries are from those who have never really become a screenplay writer or a director of any kind. Most viewers have no idea of what it takes to organize and shoot a film of quality.

Grow up America!!! Not ALL films will be to your liking and they cannot be. It's impossible to please everyone with regards to writing or filmmaking. And to the one reviewer who felt that this film was a ""downer"": Hello! It was meant to be! It wasn't written for the comedic driven audience. That's why it's called a ""Drama"". It does not suppose to make you ""feel good"". Rent 'Sabrina' if you want to ""feel good"". If you are moody and intense, then, this movie is for audience-types who truly appreciate realistic themes with drama based momentum. It's not called ""Looking for Disney's Magic Kingdom"" for Pete's sake!! It's not the garbage which is portrayed in the typical mainstream stupidity like ""13 going on 30"" or anything with J.Lo or the typical Lindsey Lohan/Jennifer Aniston variety~ or anything with those damned twins~ (whom which many of us cannot at all relate to anyway thus the reason that not all films are made for everyone~ I personally wish that there were more films directed and written with a deliberate and thought-provoking style as ""Goodbar"". I personally am tired of un- original, dull, and silly remakes and rip-offs of other films. It's time to bring back older quality actors and quality story telling as this film demonstrates in very fine realistic style.

What happened to the quality in filmmaking? It's time to bring this back and it's time to stop catering to the simpleton plot crowd. We need better story development writers (like 'Veronica Guerin') and talented actors who are willing to risk the criticism. Cautionary tales are great for the mind. This country needs to be challenged to learn to think more than to be cheaply entertained ALL OF THE TIME.

You will not find another Keaton or another Richard Brooks (director). The gritty reality of loneliness and bedraggled low-self-esteem of the character is part of an art form in this film and in its own way life is imitating art and even vice- versa. This movie is for grown-ups and not for grown adolescents who must have the visual action force at every single moment. The build-up from beginning to end is what brings superiority to this film. If you want a ""pick me up"" try ""comedy""(plenty of it) and if you want an action movie try ""action-adventure""(too much of it); if you want to grow up, check this film out!!",1116374400,41,3605,4.681388012618297

The movie depicts many of the problems of being a liberated single female in the 70s.  The main character, Theresa Dunn, moves out of her oppressive Catholic family home to find her place in the world.  She becomes a compassionate teacher of deaf children during the day, and ventures out at night into the bar scene.  Through Keaton's ability to capture the emotionally vulnerable Theresa, the viewer connects strongly to Theresa's journey to find the life she wants.
Richard Gere's performance is also worthy of note, as are the cinematic effects.

The Keaton character realizes the entity of her own sexual frustration and takes to casual sex as a form of emotional therapy. When she decides it's time to get her act straight, she fails, fatally, to put her experience to fruition: not because it's morally too late for redemption and she must be punished, but simply out of bad luck.

A Catholic teacher of deaf children, Keaton's portrayal of a sexually repressed woman looking for scores in all the wrong places is unsettling in an generally inaudacious - and brutal - film. But, the talent that she is, Keaton keeps our attention and is nearly upstaged by Tuesday Weld in an Oscar-nominated supporting role. ""Goodbar"" takes us to the darker side of casual sexal encounters and issues a warning that we ought not delve too deeply into the darkness without a light on in our brains. The film also marked the first substantial work of Richard Gere and Tom Berenger. But it remains Keaton who carries the film, and she does it splendidly and achieves the intended goal of making us squeamish about the dangerous underpinnings of sexual experimentation. The film's closing scene is harrowing and also achieves its own goal to send the viewer off with an unsoothed boding of doom, and it gives us no hope. Panned critically at the time, the film nonetheless is a showcase of Keaton's dramatic talents, something she'd had little chance to do until then.

It's about a woman that is a teacher of deaf children by day, and a swinging disco mama by night.  She is trying to come to terms with her sexuality & relationships, but always seems to have to confront conflict with her family or the men she meets.  What always amazed me about this movie was the loser men she meets throughout.  This is why I have always affectionately titled this movie as ""Looking For Mr. Nutbar""  The atmosphere is dark & seedy, and can be a depressing movie to watch-especially the heart wrenching end.

If you are a fan of Diane Keaton, or like movies from the '70s, this is a great choice for your video library.",1032998400,7,978,4.271739130434782

Two hours later, my heart was pounding and my hands were sweating. I was in inertia for perhaps, oh, twenty minutes. That's how much the movie impacted me.
Diane Keaton and her unique, rare talent stands out as Theresa Dunn, a lonely, sexually insatiable woman searching for so many things:unconditional love, understanding, and a happy life. Oppressed by her rigid father, the morals of Catholicism, the dread that nobody truly loves her, and insecurity, she tries to break out of her shell, experimenting by getting involved in the wild partying life.  Compassionate teacher of deaf kids by day, heavy partyer/hooker by night. Two characteriscs entirely different, yet in one woman. She searches for true love by getting involved with eclectic men, and was just beginning to find it when inhumanity and brutality invaded her, snuffing out her weak voice once and for all...
On another point, I have to say I'm very impressed with the way this movie approached deafness. I'm deaf myself, and I know back in the seventies, most deaf schools didn't offer signing/speaking at the same time. They only offered speech classes, with absolutely no signing at all. So far, most deaf schools have broken away from this rule, but with this movie, made in the seventies... I could understand what they were saying without having to read the closed-captioning. I'm very impressed with how smoothly they signed.
But that's not the main reason why I was so taken with this movie. The subtle dialogue blends very well. The bar scene adds to the mystical aura, along with the mood and lighting. But most of all, you find yourself almost wanting to save Theresa from the hell of this grim reality. You find yourself sympathizing and identifying with her confusion, her loneliness, and her brutal desire to be someone else. She was just beginning to find herself when that chance was suddenly taken away.
The ending. My God... the ending... there are no words that can describe it. It chills you to the very core. I have never seen an ending filled with such doom and finality. When the strobe light finally dies out, you find yourself in thick silence, unable to think of a coherent sentence till you finally pull yourself together and begin to make sense of it all. But even so, you can't find a rational solution to this movie. You have to accept it for its graphic reality.
Heart-breaking. I'll never forget this film.",980467200,68,2547,4.841743119266055
7806401,5,6300216853,Me and a friend saw the original movie the week it came out at a theatre in Hollywood within walking distance from where we lived.  We came out in complete aw and shock...silence all the way home.  We were two single ladies in 1977 who loved dating the guys we would meet.  But we loved the movie.  Is it possible to get it professionally put on DVD?,1519603200,,350,4.17910447761194
7806402,5,6300216853,"Having been eleven-years-old when this movie first came out, I finally had an opportunity to watch it.  Keaton earned her kudos for the performance of a naive, desperate, and conflicted woman of 70s.  In fact, all of the principal characters played their roles just the way I imagine people of that time who were like caged animals set free for the first time.  All of the main characters were out of control in some form with the main antagonist winning the award for the most unstable.

The story confirms my thoughts about the woman's liberation movement.  It reminds me that it is just another form of extremism.  Was it so wrong for Theresa to stay home with her family until she was ready to live on her own?  What did women gain as a collective from swinging?  How did the one night stand better society?  What did random abortions do to improve life for all?  How did the risky lifestyle help women in a positive way?  Theresa seemed miserable living two extreme lifestyles. She could have enjoyed her life and respected herself at the same time.  She was depressed because of her family's religious and societal extremism but hopped into another intense lifestyle.  Somewhere in between the two acute lifestyles was a happy balance.  That happy balance is what women should try to acquire, not radicalism that leaves them empty or dead.

Watching this movie, I also couldn't help thinking about the big elephant of that time, AIDS.  Although AIDS was formally named in the 80s, every one-night stand depicted in the film made me wonder about the origin of AIDS.  The characters' total disregard for intimacy, friendship, respect, and love were reminders of the tragedy that devastated thousands of lives.  The brutal attack at the end, for me, was symbolic of the thousands of lives taken by the disease as a result of risky living.  The 70s, disco, drugs, and swinging all seem to be synonymous with death.",1518220800,2,1916,4.768996960486322

7806406,3,6300216853,"This is the true story of Roseann Quinn.

It is a very upsetting story, from beginning to end.
I couldn't enjoy the movie because I knew that all of it was true.
The end is really shocking, and the images of the last scene stayed with me.

I am giving this movie 3 stars because Diane Keaton and Richard Gere did an amazing job.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a sad thriller with a shocking ending,
especially if you appreciate that all of it is true.",1504396800,,471,4.211111111111111

This copy looks like a bootlegged disc transferred from a VCR tape.  The quality of the picture is pretty bad but the sound is perfect.  I know this is hard item to find but for what Amazon charges for it, it should be perfect.  I wish they would release a blue ray version. This movie is intense and violent but very realistic. You can't keep your eyes away from it from beginning to end.",1488931200,7,547,4.180952380952381

Great acting, story telling, and unbelievable music. Cheap for $100.",1482969600,,334,4.982142857142857
