All the while he wished to live in peace and marry the woman he loves. As the war against the Japanese rages on, things become more dangerous for him and those around him.

This movie was fantastic. I watched it with English subtitles and was very entertained by it's fast pace, excellent action and good story. It almost feels like the type of action movies John Woo would make and this is why I highly recommend it!",1492646400,,672,4.455284552845528
