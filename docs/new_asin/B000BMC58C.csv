2423807,4,B000BMC58C,"An excellent bio on a great star of early Hollywood...
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that it could have been longer!",1365552000,,131,4.076923076923077
2423808,4,B000BMC58C,"What  guy he was. Am I supposed to rate the DVD? Well, I kind of don't remember it. Errol Flynn was in it.",1358121600,,106,3.608695652173913
2423809,5,B000BMC58C,"I was thrilled when I stumbled upon this dvd.  I grew up watching Errol Flynn films on the late show.  Was there ever an actor more gorgeous?!  This documentary gives lots of footage, lots of backstory and lots of Errol.  I had read ""My Wicked Wicked Ways"" when I was in college and this filled in many missing pieces.  I love this dvd so much I bought another as a gift.

All said though, my favorite part was near the beginning, when an extraordinarily young Errol is auditioning for a film.  He is absolutely breath-taking.

He died way too young and looked way too old when he did. However, he lived his life exactly the way he wished and left so many wonderful, indelible images in the bargain.",1346889600,10,699,4.40625
2423810,5,B000BMC58C,"Errol Flynn had a life almost more colorful than the many adventurers he played in his costume dramas Captain Blood, Robin Hood, Don Juan, and American hero General Custer in one of the top westerns They Died With Their Boots On. Full of dashing charm on top of the stunning good looks, he won the admiration of many fans and unfortunately earned a reputation for womanizing that is pretty well debunked by the frank revelations of his family members wives Nora Eddington, Patrice Wymore, daughter Deirdre plus several other commentators that reveal the press was too good to dispute as it made for box office receipts that Jack Warner did not want to spoil.

Similarly, the idea that Flynn was a draft dodger is debunked as he tried to enlist in both the British and American services at the beginning of conflict with rejections from all services as he had malaria and a congenital heart problem that Warner's did not want to reveal as it might spoil his reputation as an athletic star and party animal offscreen. When the statutory rape trial of 1943 is discussed it becomes apparent that Jack Warner, head of Warner Bros, was just trying to get as much publicity as he could without regard for Errol Flynn's well being. If there is any villain in the Errol Flynn story it would have to be Mr Jack Warner.

The feature is directed by David Heely and it covers all areas of Flynn's life but leaves the exploitation and sordid details back in the tabloids where they belong.

The narrator is Ian Holm and details of Flynn's entire life are covered from his childhood in Tasmania, young manhood in New Guinea, migration to England where the acting bug bit him and ultimate destination Hollywood where he was offered a contract and made his first vehicle a breakthrough performance entitled ""Captain Blood,"" teaming him with what would be his most frequent leading lady Olivia de Havilland.  She gives some very moving testimony of her work with Flynn and confirms that their mutual affection was never acted upon, contrary to rumors, that were again fueled by Warner's publicity department.

Not by any means a fawning tribute but a set of frank and moving reminiscences by self-proclaimed Flynn fans and a few family members and close friends. When you hear Richard Dreyfuss or Burt Reynolds comment on Flynn it is like hearing a close friend telling you their take on a favorite star's mystique. You can hear the genuine admiration in their voices.

The 87 minute feature is contained on a single sided DVD that is part of the Errol Flynn Signature Collection 2 and also as a separate disk, so there is no reason to avoid this one.

I bought my copy at Amazon.",1344470400,3,2662,4.711827956989247
2423811,5,B000BMC58C,"The Adventures of Errol Flynn is one of the most polished Flynn documentaries I have viewed to date.

The contributions from Deirdre Flynn, Patrice Wymore, and Olivia de Havilland in particular; make this work highly informative. This is because all these women are well qualified to provide reliable accounts of Flynn, and all experienced him at different stages and circumstances in his life. None of these women have any plausible reasons to provide a sugarcoated version of Flynn, as they were all hurt by him in some way, so it is reasonable that what they provide is completely authentic.

Flynn is presented as far from faultless but he is well confirmed as having been fun, generous, often well-intended, and highly capable of serious thought and discussion.

2423812,5,B000BMC58C,"The Adventures of Errol Flynn accurately captures the essence of who he was; from his magnificent Hollywood debut in Captain Blood; through his rousing performances in The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Sea Hawk and Gentleman Jim; to his ultlimate demise due to excessive indulgences in women, drink and drugs.  By most historical accounts, Flynn was a superbly charasmatic talent who succumbed to the temptations that so easily accompany phenomenal success in Hollywood, particularly at an early age in life.  The Adventures of Errol Flynn was particularly insightful, with commentary by his costar in eight or nine films, Olivia de Havilland and by noted film historians.  Even if you're not a huge Errol Flynn fan, you can't go wrong given the dirt cheap price of this entertaining DVD.",1242345600,18,788,5.140625
2423813,5,B000BMC58C,"This is an interesting and very informative, entertaining way to spend time learning about ERROL FLYNN. Aside from some penetrating comments from two of his ex-wives (Nora Eddington and Patrice Wymore), there are some frank and very supportive comments on the real Errol Flynn (if anybody really knew him) from his most frequent co-star, Olivia de Havilland. It is the first time she has openly revealed anything about the deep love and affection Flynn and de Havilland had for each other.

In addition, some very interesting comments by Richard Dreyfuss, who became a Flynn fan at the age of eight and gives what seem like spontaneous, off the cuff comments that seem unrehearsed and genuine. Daughter Diedre expresses the wish that others knew more about the quieter, family man side of Flynn that is obscured by all the tales of his womanizing. It seems that his real interest lay in writing, but although he wrote two novels (neither a great literary success), he lacked the discipline to achieve his literary ambitions.

Not easy to understand why anyone asked Joanne Woodward and Burt Reynolds to make contributions. Neither of them was a close confidante of the actor nor ever worked with him. Seems strange to hear them talking about him and contributing little to our knowledge of him without any first hand experience.

The film clips, revealing Flynn in all his charismatic glory (especially during the height of his career) are generous and always stimulating, reminding us how great his screen presence was--a combination of athletic grace and classic good looks along with acting ability that was often underrated.

Any fan of the actor will appreciate this documentary. It has style and content and the kind of assurance about its subject that will endear it to Flynn's fans. If nothing else, it serves to remind us that he was one of the most dashing actors of the silver screen and, when teamed with Olivia de Havilland in those great adventure-romance classics, he had no peer.

While it does deal with some of his unsavory exploits (such as the rape trial), it does not exploit them and instead shows us another, more sensitive side of Flynn that has been missing in most biographies of the actor.",1185840000,45,2216,4.9144385026737964
2423814,5,B000BMC58C,"This is a highly interesting and absorbing documentary on the life of Errol Flynn: excerpts from his box-office successes, reminiscences from his ex-wives, his daughter, his co-stars, and others. Actors like Richard Dreyfus, Joanne Woodward, Burt Reynolds help to explain the man's magnetism and charisma --- or, rather, they don't explain it, since those qualities are inexplicable: they just happen --- but they do homage to the electrifying presence and command of the film medium that Flynn exuded. A fairly short, brilliant and tragic life: romantic, in every sense --- and romance is defined by a sense of loss, and unfulfillment. Flynn's career is worthy of  a truly in-depth study by a first-rate biographer. So far, there have only been one or two inadequate or downright shabby accounts. One of them is by a person I once met; a short, fat, ugly, bitter, little, journalistic academic, who is clearly unable to live with the fact that there are people in this world with infinitely more charm, dash and talent than himself. A real jerk. This documentary will do, until someone does the life full justice. Its main virtue is that it manages to demonstrate that Flynn was not only a star, but a great actor.",1129161600,47,1215,4.926829268292683

2423827,5,B000BMC58C,"Ahoy!

I enjoyed it very much as i'm of the older generation and grew up with Mr. Flynn's adventure.  He had a profound influence on my life.  I myself have lived a swashbuckler's life and have lived 47 years aboard my my very own pirate ship MEKA II.  And on one of my sailing adventures In 2002 I had the pleasure of meeting Patrice Flynn on the island of Jamaica.

2423828,4,B000BMC58C,"I have always loved Errol Flynn in Captain Blood and Robin Hood, this goes into his life quite a bit and very interesting.  So sad he died fairly young.",1388188800,,152,4.241379310344827
2423829,4,B000BMC58C,Errol Flynn was an extremely talented actor. Even today few stars are able to compare to him. Actors of his era were able to carry a movie strictly on talent without the dazzling display of special effects we have today. I will say however it is always sad to see great talents succumb to addictions like drugs and alcohol.,1387670400,,323,4.491525423728813
2423830,5,B000BMC58C,"This is a very well balanced documentary, examining what motivated Errol Flynn as a person, giving a delightful panoply of his awesome movie roles, and discussing his life's many adventurous experiences and controversies about him.  I'm a big fan of his movies, and was pleasantly surprised at how well the documentary explains him as a person.  His reckless real-life lifestyle of womanizing, addictions, and looking for danger was due to a search for fulfillment and originally to not being supported well by his parents as a youngster.  From there it never got better, even as he tried to be a good husband and father.  At one point in the 50s, about 5 years before he died from his addictions' toll on his body, he was cheated in major ways by the Italian financiers of a movie he was doing, his actor friend Bruce Cabot, and his business manager in the US, all in a row.  His life story is like a tragedy from ancient Greece or Shakespeare.  I like the movie clips that are in the documentary, and how the documentary puts them into the context of his life story.  I think it is a really well made documentary.  It's narrated by Ian Holm.",1376956800,2,1143,4.568627450980392
