8326499,2,B001HXJMVW,"The action in the main fight is great; but the announcing is delayed several seconds and not very insightful.  If you can find a different recording of ""Sanchez-Gomez"" I would recommend it.  Also, the Mantequilla Napoles fight shown on the image is not included.",1301097600,,262,4.931818181818182
