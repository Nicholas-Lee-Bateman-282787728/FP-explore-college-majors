8473152,4,B001MUBHRW,"This video really isn't a ""how-to"" on gunstocking.  You're essentially watching Mark as he demonstrates his tools and techniques without presenting a step-by-step instruction.  However, if you already know a thing or two about longrifle building, it's very easy to follow along and understand what he is doing.

Mark Silver does a great job demonstrating the tools and techniques.  In fact, I found it very relaxing to watch as he gracefully used wood block planes, spokeshaves, and chisels to work the curly maple like a block of clay.

Bottom line:  This isn't the very first video to watch if you are just getting into gun building.  But if you have at least some understanding of the steps and process of gun building, this is an excellent video and there is nothing else out there like it.",1269561600,9,794,4.794117647058823
