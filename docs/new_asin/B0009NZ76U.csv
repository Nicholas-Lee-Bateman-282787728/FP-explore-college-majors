2306739,2,B0009NZ76U,"The series content is very good, however the company that produced the DVD did a terrible job of formating the episodes/scenes.  They split a one-hour show across two DVD's to save using a fourth disk in the series.  In doing this, the scene access for the second half of an episode will not play; it jumps to the beginnig of the next episode.  The only way to view the 2nd part is to fast-backwards all the way to just after the start of the scene and play from there.  If you go all the way back, it takes off at the begining of the next episode.  Very Frustrating to deal with the formating faults on this DVD.  I will think twice about ordering another DVD from this studio.",1128297600,58,678,4.2578125

2306741,1,B0009NZ76U,"We loved the Bramwell series,  so we ordered two seasons of it as a Christmas GIFT for a family member.
It is late March now and we only just learned from the recipient that the DVDs did not not play well.
Many sections were dysfunctional and in all unable to be be viewed. They felt awkward telling us about their experience until now when I offered to send the next two seasons as a follow up for a birthday.  Had I known at Christmas, I would have returned the product and demanded a refund.  I chose the seller based on the 5 star rating... Choosing to support a personal seller rather than big corporate Amazon - clearly a mistake. Possibly they were a bootlegged reproduced product.  Definitly inferior quality DVDs.  Very disappointed !  - And out $60.00 !",1395532800,,763,4.492753623188406

2306743,5,B0009NZ76U,"Bramwell is excellent period piece of Victorian  into Edwardian England..of a female Dr who decides to open The Thrift
In a hard part of London to help those who need it the most. She relies on donations and benefactors. Eleanor is strong willed and does not suffer fools or the male medical bastion kindly. The cases are a great view of medicine in those days and how a woman had to work harder and be smarter than men to get anywhere...some things haven't changed. highly recommend!",1378080000,3,484,4.627906976744186
2306744,2,B0009NZ76U,"I bought the first season along with the rest of the four seasons more than three years ago and loved it. Somewhere along the line the first season was lost, so I re-ordered it. Unfortunately, it came in shreds. All the credits for each episode were cut out and it was impossible to watch in order. I'm extremely unhappy about the editing job on this fine series. No fault of the seller, of course, but a warning would have been nice.",1373328000,2,434,4.37037037037037
2306745,5,B0009NZ76U,"I loved this DVD series.  Did not want to see it end.  If you love stories of London in the late 1800's this is very good.  The heroine, Dr. Eleanor Bramwell, is the daughter of a doctor who has to deal with discrimination, the poor & sick of London, in ""The Thrift"" that she founds and a love affair.

I enjoyed each episode, the costumes, and the way of life during this time period.",1369958400,,385,4.162162162162162
2306746,5,B0009NZ76U,"1895 medicine was very deficient, but the physicians had to work with what they had. Engrossing story line of a woman doctor, practically unheard of at the time, and her efforts to continue practicing despite prejudice.",1367193600,,219,5.111111111111111

2306749,4,B0009NZ76U,"Great series, with both well-acted drama and keen insight into medical practices and life in this period of British history.  Our only disappointment was that the episodes are randomly split among the dvd's, requiring that you change the dvd in the middle of some episodes.  And the final episode of the series was corrupted half-way through, so we never got to see the end of it.  I don't know if this was just the one we got, or if the recording of others is also damaged.  But the dramas themselves are great, though a bit bloody in places - those with weak stomachs, be warned!",1349740800,,581,4.504761904761905
2306750,5,B0009NZ76U,"If you love Downton Abbey, you'll adore Bramwell. While Downton Abbey is a soap opera, Bramwell is real life.  The acting and story lines are absolutely top notch.  Jemma Redgrave is incredible, and you'll quickly fall in love with her, her father, her assistant Dr. Marsham and Nurse Carr.  I watched this on demand, so didn't experience the poor quality DVD issue mentioned by other reviewers.  If you don't have Netflix or Amazon Prime/Streaming, and this is the only option for you, I feel it will still be worth it.",1333497600,,520,4.7444444444444445

2306753,5,B0009NZ76U,"This is a wonderful series.  After watching the 1st episode we couldn't turn it off.  Dr. Bramwell is a head strong young female doctor who is not afraid to speak her mind to the men around her.  She is filled with compassion, and has a great sense of care for her patients.  Watching this made me glad of the great strides of modern medicine.  I loved every minute of this medical drama. I'm off to order the 2nd and 3rd series.",1315008000,,429,4.246913580246914
2306754,5,B0009NZ76U,"I love to search through ""Period Piece"" DVD's on Amazon as I will invariably find many great ones, especially from the UK, that I've never heard of. One I picked up a year or so ago, that we finally got around to viewing, is Bramwell, Series 1.

Bramwell is the story of Eleanor Bramwell, one of the first (though fictional) female Doctors in Victorian England. Bramwell follows Eleanor's trials, tribulations and surprisingly ""realistically grusome"" medical cases, as well as her acceptance or nonacceptance in the ""man's world"" of Victorian era Medicine. The costuming and sets are accurate and to die for. Eleanor's  ""Gibson Girl"" leg o mutton blouses and frocks are drool-worthy :)

The show stars the beautiful Jemma Redgrave (yes, THAT Redgrave family-she is the daughter of Corin Redgrave and niece of Vanessa/Lynn Redgrave) and the incomparable Ruth Sheen who is one of the best Veteran UK Character actors around as Nurse Carr.

The show ran 4 seasons and I eagerly look forward to renting and viewing seasons 2-4 :) Recommended-5 stars.

PS-seeing the other reviews here-yes, my edition did not have the eighth episode on it. I agree with the other reviewers-I'm highly disappointed in the company who manufactured the DVD (they'd get zero stars) the five stars is for the show itself.",1275177600,9,1295,5.004651162790697
2306755,1,B0009NZ76U,"I know that I will love the DVDs because I have the VHS edition of this show.  However, I am not happy with the company who is suppposed to have sent them.  I was supposed to have received them late in October or early in November and I still do not have them.  It is November 30 today.  When I look at my order it shows that they were sent but we have not received them.  Kitty Brilliant",1228003200,3,388,3.923076923076923
2306756,5,B0009NZ76U,Brilliant series which illustrates the prejudices of Victorian England against educated women. Also graphically shows medical practices of the time and the attitude to the poor. Combining this with excellent acting and costuming make this a series worthy of recommendation.,1170115200,7,273,5.85
2306757,2,B0009NZ76U,"Bramwell is an outstanding series. The rating of 2 stars is for the following reason. To add to AGPym's formatting issue, Shanachie has also issued 7 episodes and labeled the dvd as season 1. According to the PBS web site I printed out with the Bramwell retrospective, listing all seasons and episodes, this dvd combines seasons 1 and 2 (which originally totalled 8 episodes)and leaves off the final episode of season 2. This missing episode involves a subway (underground) train crash which I did originally see when the series was new. Also check my customer review for the so-called season 4.",1167955200,30,595,4.900990099009901
2306758,5,B0009NZ76U,"I absolutely love this series.  Set at the turn of the century in England, it has great accuracy in showing medicine and surgery before the discovery of penicillin and modern anaesthesia. The characters are richly protrayed and deep...never one-dimentional.  If you enjoy period films and excellent drama, this one is a sure keeper!",1163203200,10,332,5.245283018867925

8064035,5,B0009NZ76U,"This is an excellently done series portraying the story of a lady doctor in 1895 in England, who tries not just to pity the poor as most members of her class do, but actually help them by founding ""The Thrift"".  An infirmary for the poor with her as the presiding doctor.  Jemma Redgrave portrays Eleanor Bramwell in a very sympathetic and convincing fashion.  As at times, Doctor Bramwell runs into difficulties in her quest to aid the poor as their circumstances are overwhelming.  One also admires her bravery in the series in continuing her quest to aid the poor, as they are often gruff, brawling, drunkards.  Thankfully, she's aided in this charitable foundation by a well-to-do benefactress who also works as the administrator of the hospital.  Lest I spoil the plot, I was sad to see what becomes of her in one of the later episodes.  I also really respected the senior Doctor Bramwell, Eleanor's father, as while he would prefer his daughter join him in private practice and actually bring money in from her expensive education, in the end, he always comes through for Eleanor and lends his medical and professional expertise in the process.  I also enjoyed Dr. Marsham and his Scottish brogue.  The series highlights some of the issues of the era, especially concerning women entering a ""man's"" profession and the plight of those without opportunity.  It is very well done and my Mother and I both have stayed up until the wee hours of the morning watching it.",1454371200,,1470,4.7976190476190474

8064040,1,B0009NZ76U,OMG this DVD show was more than I could stomach.  I realize in the past that medical care was bad in that very little was known about the human body and science was in its infancy.  But I simply cannot watch such horrific medical procedures from times gone by.  I have a strong stomach and have worked in a hospital so I am not easily grossed out but this show was simply too graphic for me.,1419552000,,391,4.118421052631579
