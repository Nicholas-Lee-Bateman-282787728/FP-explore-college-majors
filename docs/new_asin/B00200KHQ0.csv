8348373,4,B00200KHQ0,"There are a lot of rumors about the history of the hotel. But from the video, real stories are revealed and they present a real and impressive living history before us. To me, WA seems to be the record of Commercial NYC from the 1890s to the 21st centuries. All those fancy dreams, great courage and expectations about the future, and the listless efforts willing to spent towards the dreams. It is also the product of an American dream. It will carry this spirit- nothing is impossible- to people in all the places it will be settled. It is not only a dream luxurious home but also an inspiration for realizing our dreams. Willing to dream, and willing to do. :)
Strongly recommend those who are interested in luxurious hospitality services to watch this documentary video.",1363392000,,774,4.698529411764706

8348376,5,B00200KHQ0,"Comprehensive, informative and entertaining hotel movie. The movie was a surprise to me as I wasn't expecting video footage from 1930's and from the former Waldorf located where the Empire State building stands now. The movie length is only 50 minutes but it feels like 2 hours as there is so much information about the famed waldorf astoria- great work.",1245024000,3,354,4.916666666666667
