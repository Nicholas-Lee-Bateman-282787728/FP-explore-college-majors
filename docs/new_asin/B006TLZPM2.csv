5016355,5,B006TLZPM2,K-ON! is a really good  anime. It is about 5 high school girls that join the light music club and start a rock band. It's a heartwarming tale of friendship and fun. All of the characters are likable and memorable. Each character has a unique and interesting personality. It's fun to watch them goof off and play their music. I was actually kind of surprised with their band they actually have some style. Their songs are good and the costumes their teacher makes them are funny. It's a light hearted show with everything it takes to make a memorable story. I believe it will be talked about for years to come.,1348963200,5,609,4.486486486486487
5016356,5,B006TLZPM2,"Just to get it out of the way, this is the whole first season.  Packaging is fine, extra's include interviews with the US voice actors for the 4 main characters.  Nothing great, but not bad.  Video and audio where great to me, but I am neither a video nor audiophile.

Why you should buy this is simple:  it is fun.  It does not try and be anything other than a fun story of 4 girls forming a band as a club in High School.  No deep plot elements, no moral messages, no edginess, no resorting to fan service.  Just a fun story about girls doing fun stuff.  The emphasis is on cute and funny and having a good time.  And it works spectacularly well.  The characters are nothing that you will not see in other anime, but are still likable and enjoyable enough to stand out.  Yui, who can't cross the street without getting sidetracked(attention deficit...oh, shiny) who has a hard time studying and thinks proper care for a guitar is sleeping with it next to her.  Ritsu, the tomboyish hyper girl who plays drums.  Tsumugi(Mugi), the rich girl(ojou-sama) with a fascination for how normal people live(she takes jobs at McDonalds to see what it is like) and may be a yuri-fangirl, and Mio, classically Japanese, pretty, smart, talented...and afraid of blood, horror films, barnacles, and just about anything else.  Painfully shy and prone to crying oh so cutely.  By the end of this set you will be fans of them all.

English translation is fine but not perfect and suffers from some things simply not translating neatly to English(moe moe kyun!).  English voice cast is not as good as the Japanese cast, but certainly good enough that you can't complain.  Simply put there the biggest complaints you can make about the series and this release is that it is not absolutely perfect, only close.  This is a show that can and does appeal to men and women, boys and girls of all ages.  My 18 month old niece loves the songs and the bright colors.  There is no objectionable content so it is perfect for younger viewers.",1344988800,5,2012,4.56145251396648
5016357,5,B006TLZPM2,"This box set essentially has the same discs that was released individually with 4 episodes per disc a few months back, so if you were waiting to buy it, I'd highly recommend buying this and saving a lot of money. I bought individual discs, but went ahead and bought this anyway, and will give the other DVD's to my nieces who enjoy watching this show.

As for the series itself, it's a slice-of-life high school comedy, with occasional song thrown in. It has similarities to other anime series such as Lucky Star, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (minus the sci-fi stuff), and Azumanga Daioh. If you liked those shows, you'll like this one too. Nothing too outrageous, just a group of girls going about their lives and their Light Music Club, and goofing off a lot in between the actual band playing parts.",1333670400,19,807,4.643356643356643
8504026,5,B006TLZPM2,This is the entire season of K on season 1 on 4 discs special features include interviews with English voice cast music videos of English version songs and trailers a must-have for any slice-of-life anime fan or K on fan,1505692800,,220,4.525

I feel I'll enjoy english version K-ON! I bought a USED one, so I worried about this DVD's condition. But no ploblem. So good condition!! I'll buy something by american amazon some day.",1423526400,,328,4.576271186440678
8504030,5,B006TLZPM2,"This show is so cute, 5 girls with silly adventures but I do recommend watching a little before buying. I bought on impulse and although I did like it, I might of put it off for a bit til price went down. There's just others that are funnier and more interesting for the price I paid. The songs are awesome but there aren't very many of them.",1410307200,,342,4.119402985074627
8504031,5,B006TLZPM2,"I bought this on a whim after seeing a few clips of the show. That gamble could not have possibly turned out any better. K-ON is honestly one of my favorite shows now (including the second season); the animation is beautiful and the music is incredible. Both the soundtrack and the insert songs are far more wonderful than you'd expect and support a well written and endearing cast of characters. If you are at all into either anime or music, definitely do yourself a favor and try K-ON. And if you are into neither anime nor music, I'd highly suggest watching K-ON and bet that it may just change your mind for you!",1391990400,,616,4.460176991150442

8504034,5,B006TLZPM2,"Delightful characters and dialogue, snippets of rock-n-roll history, and garage band high-jinks. I highly recommend the series, especially for anyone that has ever been in a rock band in their younger years.",1375401600,,207,5.5
