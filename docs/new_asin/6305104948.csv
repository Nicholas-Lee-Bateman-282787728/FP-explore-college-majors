As far as the quality of the tapes goes, no attempt was made to clean the film, so there are a good deal of scratches and ""hairs"" on the film. The aspect ratio is goofy on most of them, making everyone look stretched out. Some of the tapes even run out before the movies end! All in all, not worth the money - even at the good price they have here.
This set contains - Hell'z Windstaff, Faster Blade - Poisonous Dart, Wu Tang Clan, Invincible Armor, Iron Man, Killer Priest, Wu Tang Swordmen, Godz of Wu Tang, Son of Wu Tang, Shaolin vs. Wu Tang 2, and 'Ol Dirty Kung Fu",1021420800,2,744,4.102739726027397
