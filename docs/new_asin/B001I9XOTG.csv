The only thing worse than the acting is the script. And I've seen better acting at elementary school performances!

Note that it has also been released in different packaging under the title, ""Vampire vs. Zombies.""",1404691200,,260,4.886363636363637

8310539,1,B001I9XOTG,"I am of the type who enjoys the cheesy b-movies.  For the most part many are well made and at least TRY to be entertaining and I give them that.  However, there are those films which turn even my (hardened) stomach.  I thought Dracula 3000 was the worst, until I saw this film.

Pros: A few cute actresses

Cons: 99.9% of the film.
-Bad acting, people don't know how to enunciate their words to make them seem believable.
-No discernible plot
-Plot holes
-Dumb lines
-Pointless lines
-Dumb and pointless lines
-etc etc.

Whatever possessed anyone to create this drivel, under who knows how many varying titles, should be shot.

I suppose their aim was to waste a few hours of our time, if so, they succeeded.  AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!  I mean it!",1269734400,,757,4.507352941176471
8310540,2,B001I9XOTG,"This film has already been released (several years ago) as ""Vampires vs. Zombies"". It's a rip-off that they would release this film again under a new name.

The film's a confused mess. There's an end-of-the-world scenario with a plague creating zombies everywhere. Brinke Stevens stops a car and convinces the people to take care of her daughter, the vampire of the title (a plot ploy stolen from ""The Vampire Lovers"" - that allows the vampire to 'join' with her supposed victim)

Maritama Carlson seduces Bonny Giroux, her prey during sleep. It's shown that she's cause of people becoming zombies but then this flys in the face that her 'prey' Ms Giroux does not turn into a zombie at each feeding.

Even when they drive along it appears that the car's being pushed - it's travelling that slow.

They stop in the middle of the road and Bonny takes off her top and the vampire feeds from between her legs and then Bonny wakes up as if she's dreamt the lot, only she's bleeding from between her legs. She thinks it's her 'period', only she's bleeding from two puncture marks on her inner thigh. *sigh* There are that many dumb plot moments. The vampire even hands her a tampon.

Avoid this film",1231977600,,1193,4.6350710900473935
