7199833,5,B00XV4X6VC,"I love that it doesn't take a really long time to feel like you got a GREAT workout in. Natalie isn't kidding when she says that shorter workouts work just fine when you are doing what is intense for you. I love that these advanced workouts pushed me to that level of intensity. I get such a good workout...not much makes me feel so sore in an amazing way! :) Plus, I love how motivating she is. All in all I recommend.",1458518400,3,419,4.121951219512195
7199834,5,B00XV4X6VC,This DVD is no joke guys!! It's the real deal. Is it challenging & advanced? You bet it is! The best part is it walks that fine line ..... It challenges me And motivates me at the Same time !!! Other workout DVDs  feel too challenging & then you feel discouraged. Not Natalie Jills!! It's challenging & accessible ... It motivates you to work harder & feel empowered!!! Love this DVD and the entire series!,1457568000,4,406,4.413333333333333
7199835,5,B00XV4X6VC,"I have been using Natalie's programs for over a year now. The videos are short, but they are effective. As a working Mom, I don't have a lot of time to workout/go to the gym, nor do I have a lot of money for workout equipment. I can complete a session, warm-up to cool down, in 30 minutes, using my own bodyweight. At the end of the workout, my muscles are burning, I am breathing hard, and I am sweating. Natalie trains functionally, which is an effective workout for me. Following Natalie's programs, not only have I seen results, but I was able to overcome a significant back injury following the Total Body Weight Advanced workout programs.",1457568000,,644,4.512820512820513
7199836,5,B00XV4X6VC,"I've been using Natalie Jill's DVD's for a year now and I absolutely love them!  First, Natalie is so motivating.  These workouts are quick and really tone your whole body.  I am so much stronger from doing these.  You can choose a 10 minute workout for days you don't have a lot of time to workout or you can do the whole DVD for a full body workout.  The best part is that you don't need anything to do these workouts!  Just pop the DVD in and your ready to workout :)  I've lost 20 lbs and 22.5"" off my body in the past 2.5 months following Natalie's fitness and nutrition programs!  I promise you won't be disappointed with this DVD!",1457568000,7,637,4.206611570247934
7199837,1,B00XV4X6VC,It was supposed to have two advanced workouts. It only came with one; the other one didn't play. I guess my CD was defective.,1443139200,,125,4.25
8716677,4,B00XV4X6VC,It's not going to get your heart rate up but it is effective for toning.  I use it on rest days or if I am short on time.,1520467200,,121,3.3214285714285716
8716678,5,B00XV4X6VC,Two great quick workouts. I like for my days that I don't have enough time for a longer workout. I still feel like I worked up a sweat and worked my muscles!,1518134400,,157,3.9375
8716679,1,B00XV4X6VC,DVD is supposed to have two workouts. The second workout is not on the disc however!,1506297600,,84,4.3125
8716680,5,B00XV4X6VC,"Great workout that works you but doesn't exhaust you. Natalie is a very positive motivator; and her series of routines here are tough, sometimes I have to break or modify because I am still intermediate for some moves. These two workouts make the most of their time, and Natalie keeps you focused on what needs to be done. Excellent 20 minute workouts plus really good warmup and cooldown.",1504396800,,389,4.735294117647059
8716681,4,B00XV4X6VC,"The DVD I received was defective, Workout #2 will not play.  Other than that, Workout #1 is great!",1496707200,,98,4.444444444444445
8716682,5,B00XV4X6VC,"I love Natalie Jill's programs. I started with Rev 4, after 2 years of this video I bumped myself up to the Advanced workout. It's challenging but I really feel like this DVD got me to the next level! I now get asked if I lift weights- which I love. I feel like I'm in the best shape ever at 42!",1473120000,3,295,3.8524590163934427
8716683,5,B00XV4X6VC,Great at home advanced workouts!  These are a great step up from Natalie's Rev 4 workouts and they do not disappoint.,1464825600,,117,4.571428571428571

8716685,5,B00XV4X6VC,I love all three 15 min workouts in this DVD! It makes it so convenient for me as a mother of two and working 3 days a week! Natalie Jill does an excellent job since she actually works out with you with a smile on her face even when the workouts can be intense! She has a great attitude! I will definitely order this again since my last DVD doesn't work on my DVD players anymore since I've played it so often!,1464566400,,410,4.012195121951219
8716686,5,B00XV4X6VC,I love this workout DVD. It's perfect for everywhere because it's all your own body work training. Even with just using body weight you get an incredible work out,1464566400,,162,4.620689655172414
