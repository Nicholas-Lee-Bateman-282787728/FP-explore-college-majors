8684638,3,B000YNHU9C,"I would have awarded this excellent, beautifully scripted and acted film four stars had I not had the disappointment of discovering that the English subtitles promised by the company that distributed the DVD were listed but not accessible. The only subtitles available are in Italian. Some scenes are in English, but the majority of the film is in Italian, so if you don't understand, at the very least, a smattering of Italian, don't buy this version of the DVD.",1386633600,,463,4.8734177215189876
