8594422,1,B00DMB8E84,"This is perhaps the most despicable film I have ever seen.  In some perverse way, it seems to equate the murder of an unborn child with the death of a soldier on the battlefield.  If that was the intent, this film is utterly wicked, and its very production would constitute a crime.",1523836800,,282,4.403846153846154
