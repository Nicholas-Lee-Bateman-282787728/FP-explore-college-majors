8176646,5,B00006I9U5,"As I mentioned in my review of the Dreamspinner toy, my dad found this anime for me back when it aired on 4Kids. I fell in love after viewing episode 7 (Caitlyn's Day Out) and watched it every weekend it was on, but I stopped watching it around the time VeggieTales came on qubo. This magical girl series is cute and teaches great lessons. If you like magical girl animes, give it a try.",1411171200,,387,4.243243243243243
