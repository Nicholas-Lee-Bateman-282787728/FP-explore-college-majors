7800131,4,1600980708,My youth (9th-12th grades) really enjoyed the videos and the discussion afterward.  Hearing thoughts from current worship artists really made an impact. I liked it because the length of each video was just right and the topics were just what the kids needed at this time in their lives.,1399939200,,286,4.836734693877551
