8005872,3,B00013F2JK,"This disc contains three documentaries in a series. The first two are very good, and I learned some interesting things that occurred during the war that I had not known, even though I've been studying the subject for ten years now. In the third program of this UK produced series, the British narrator states that Field Marshall Montgomery was the commander of the Allied Invasion Force on D-Day. In fact, there is no mention at anytime of an obscure personality by the name of Dwight D. Eisenhower. In addition, he states that the Americans met with much weaker resistance at Utah and Omaha Beaches (the two bloodiest and heavily defended beaches of the Normandy Coast), than the gallant forces of the UK met with at Gold, Sword, and Juno Beaches. Maybe the books I've read and movies I've seen are pro-American propaganda designed to make us dumb Yanks think that we played a significant part in Operation Overlord, when in fact the British would have won the war without us.",1158192000,2,977,4.752941176470588
