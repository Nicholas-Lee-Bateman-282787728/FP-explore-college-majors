8212022,2,B000U27F1A,"I went through the program and found it overwhelming, left, right, no right, no left, oh I have it backwards, its OK, I think.  It was not until the end that they stood with their back to the camera and stated that this would make this easier to follow, but, unfortunately, this was done at regular pace.  Its too bad they did not have at least one of them with their back to the camera.  I am going to try another program.  The movements themselves only take a few minutes for the cycle.",1329609600,2,488,4.21505376344086

The moves are taught in segments and then put together as a whole so you can practice the whole routine with the video.",1274745600,7,278,4.264150943396227
