7453456,1,B015XC8740,"It was an awful movie. It's called ""Close Range"" because he can't kill anyone more than 5ft away. However, at 1:15:25, it made the movie worth it. WORTH IT.",1450569600,,156,4.413793103448276
7453457,1,B015XC8740,This was so slow we stopped it at 27 minutes into it.  The acting was very poor as well. This is the type of low budget movie acting you'd expect to catch on Lifetime. Not recommended.,1449964800,,184,4.111111111111111
7453458,4,B015XC8740,"In between filming scenes of the upcoming Undisputed IV, it seems as though director Isaac Florentine and karate torchbearer Scott Adkins decided to crank out an additional movie while they had the time. Shot on a low budget in only a couple of locations with a limited cast, Close Range may be the most compact action film of 2015, but its a pretty good one at that. While not the best work of either the director or the star, this is high quality time-wasting material that supplies all the thrills that action junkies and Adkins fans could want. Potentially the best DTV action title of the year.

The story: Following a rescue mission, a mercenary (Adkins) and his family are besieged on a rural homestead by the minions of a dangerous drug lord (Tony Perez,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hill-Street-Blues/dp/B00GSTHCHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hill Street Blues</a>).

For the most part, the film looks like something that Florentine would have filmed 15 years ago, before he achieved major cult fame. Hes virtually exploiting himself here, from the pseudo-western vibe and corny dialogue to the condensed nature of the script. Running at a slim 85 minutes, Close Range sticks pretty close to its adrenaline agenda and doesnt bother with things like character development, focusing instead on physical tension. Its the type of movie that drama snobs will hate, though its also a step down from the level of storytelling that Florentines become adept at. Its disappointing that the films premise boils down to a white guy almost exclusively killing evil Latinos, and overall, I conclude that this one leaves less of an impression than almost any other picture the star and director have made together.

Unless, of course, were talking about the action scenes, for which the auteurs remain in top form. These scenes are an even balance of fights and shootouts, and both are exhilarating. The best of the gunfights take place within a home, at close quarters, with the shooters blazing at each other across furniture and through walls. The fights, though, are in a league of their own. Adkins has so many stellar matches under his belt that how these ones rank among the rest is a matter of opinion, but know that onwards from the very first fight  wherein Scott lays waste to seven thugs within a single extended camera shot  top effort has been made. These fights are potential star-makers, as Adkins finds some choice opponents in relatively unknown performers like Jimmy Chhiu, Craig Henningsen, and especially fight choreographer Jeremy Marinas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-of-Tai-Chi/dp/B00FEHCQEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man of Tai Chi</a>). Occasional slow motion marginally taints some of the brawls, though their overall quality is strong enough to withstand this fault.

In a movie wherein the characters are stock, the setups are old hat, and the lines are recycled, what can still make it worth watching? In this ones case, the answer is gusto and talent. I emphasize how much this seems like something the filmmakers threw together as a side project, but the fact that its Isaac Florentine doing the throwing means a lot. Close Range is a short, fun trip to Actionville that I encourage all fans to take.",1449792000,7,3317,5.308571428571429

7453460,3,B015XC8740,"This film starts out like a Liam Neeson film ends...young girl getting rescued from bad guys. In this case it is the Mexican Cartel and the girl is his niece (Madison Lawlor). Colton MacReady (Scott Adkins) is ex-special services and some sort of lone wolf who managed to rescue his niece. Her step-dad is involved with the cartel as is the local sheriff (Nick Chinlund). The plot basically has no twists or real imagination. It is not hard to figure out where the story leads. The film is done grindhouse western style. The drawn out climax scene was laughable. I didn't know if it was meant to be serious or they were spoofing western showdowns. The dialogue lacked classic lines and the acting left something to be desired. It needed Danny Trejo. Maybe the next one.

7453504,2,B015XC8740,"I would have given it only one star but, there were already several one star reviews and no two star reviews when I wrote this.  And, actually, for this kind of low-budget movie, most aficionados would give it three stars.  If you like the action where a trained bad-ass soldier with much combat experience can't hit anyone beyond three feet with a rifle, pistol, or shotgun (luckily, the bad guys can't either) and a bunch of really, really tough fighters (especially Scott) who hit like little girls (obviously, because nobody gets really hurt until they've been hit forty or fifty times) you will love this movie.  Another reviewer said the main woman (Caitlin Keats) is scary tough looking with a gun but, anyone familiar with handling firearms will immediately see she has no idea what she's supposed to be doing with that rifle.  She never shoulders it (fires with it tucked into her armpit) and doesn't even pretend to aim it.  Which probably is why she never actually hit anyone.  Or maybe, that was just the way the script was written.  I have seen most of Scott Adkins' movies and always hope for the best.  He's got some great moves.  It's so disappointing to see him beating and beating and then kicking and kicking on someone and having them pop right back up and hit him.  If he can't hit effectively he should just pick up one of the guns that are always lying around and ... never mind.  He can't shoot anything either.  I can hardly wait for his next movie to come out.  I KNOW it will be much better.",1460160000,,1518,4.536764705882353

7453545,4,B015XC8740,"Scott Adkins (""Wolf Warrior"") and director Isaac Florentine (""Cold Harvest"") team up for their 7th collaboration, and as usual, don't disappoint.  I actually have expectations when these guys get together, which is saying something considering how often I'm let down by the majority of the martial arts genre's contemporary output. Unfortunately, the action is about all that's taken seriously here, but if that's what you, as a fan, were looking for, then by all means, pick this one up.

Adkins plays Colton MacReady, a highly decorated soldier turned mercenary, who opens the film by beautifully wasting several members of the Antibalas drug cartel, who had taken hostage his niece, Hailey (Madison Lawlor, ""Brush With Danger""), in an attempt to get back some skimmed product taken by her step-father (musician Jake La Botz, who performs the Reggae-tinged ""Everybody Got to Fall Down"" over the end credits).  Though the rescue goes well, Colton inadvertently makes off with a flash drive containing all the cartel's crucial information.  Not only do they want it back, but one of the members our star disposed of is the nephew of the cartel's chief (Tony Perez, ""Scarface""), and the brother of head enforcer, smilingly named J.J. ""Loco"" Cruz (fight choreographer Jeremy Marinas).

The action content consists mostly of claustrophobic MMA-style fights mixed with classic kickboxing, and is very well choreographed, performed, filmed, and edited.  Some groovy shootouts, too.  A little more slow motion than I'd prefer but it's a minor complaint considering the fast-paced and brutal execution we're otherwise treated to.  The fisticuffs owe particular nods to Donnie Yen's ""Flashpoint"", Jet Li/Yuen Woo Ping's ""Unleashed"" (which Adkins briefly appeared in ), and of course 2011's ""The Raid"" and its sequel.  And while ""Close Range"" is not nearly as ambitious as those other titles, and a bit less magnetic in pulling viewers in, it stands proudly next to them, action-wise.

The DVD from Xlrator/Compound B has a nice widescreen picture, but no special features.  No optional subtitles or alternate languages either.  All dialogue is in English with some Spanish.  Basic production is cheap but looks good.  If you're an action-junkie of the martial arts variety that doesn't require much story, this comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Cinematic kickboxing aficionados should look fast for Dennis Ruel (""Contour"") as MacReady's penultimate casualty during the opening rescue.

Actually, I kind of get the feeling that this movie only exists because some poor, unsuspecting farmer asked Scott Adkins to house-sit while he went out of town for two weeks. This farmer was so happy when Adkins said yes -- it was his first real vacation in thirty years!

But after a few days of sitting around the farm doing nothing, Scott Adkins grew restless. He called up his friend Isaac and said, ""Hey, I'm just sitting around a farm doing nothing for the next two weeks, let's grab a camera and some stunt guys and blow this s*** up!""

When this poor farmer finally returned from his trip, his home was a smoldering ruin filled with bullet holes, broken glass, and three dozen sweaty unconscious stuntmen.
