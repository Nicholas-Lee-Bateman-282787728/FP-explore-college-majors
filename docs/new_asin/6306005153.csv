1107843,3,6306005153,"Since ""Streaptease"", Demi Moore has been receiving very negative critics on her performances. Forget about all that and watch this movie, coming to you own conclusions. The plot is original: a woman that has 2 different lives. One, as an executive in books business, in NY, and the other one as a devoted mother in France. The fact is that she does not know which one is real, and which is a dream. She loves both and does not want to give up on them. The film locations in France are simply wonderful and should be seen in DVD quality! I really recommend this movie!",974160000,5,567,4.40952380952381
1107844,4,6306005153,"I don't dislike Demi Moore although I also would not describe her as a favorite actor of mine.  She does a credible job in this movie though.  The idea itself is very engrossing.  Every time she wakes up, she is either a single career woman in New York or a widow in France with her two children.  She sees psychiatrists in both places and has lovers in both.  Who are all of these people is the question you will want answered by movie's end.  The resolution is equally as clever.  I really did not guess who the ""unreal"" woman was, once you figured out which of the two women really existed and was ""real.""  If you hate Demi Moore though, you may not like this movie because she certainly is in just about every scene of it.

1107845,5,6306005153,"Some Amazon reviewers of Passion of Mind would have you beleive it not worth your time: if you are a superficial, close-minded viewer more corncerned with Demi Moore's wardrobe and costume design than character development, plot twist, and strong performances than, indeed, Passion of Mind is not for you.
As a strong advocate of Demi Moore's underappreciated acting chops (see Mortal Thoughts or G.I. Jane for proof -- or even Disclosure of The Seventh Sign for than matter), Passion of Mind offers the viewer the strongest and most riveting performance by Demi to date.  You don't have to be a hard-core Moore supporter to recognize the Passion put forth into the dual roles.  Furthermore, straying from the usual big-budget, summer movie formula that propelled Demi to superstardom, here she steps back,in a sense turning her back on everything her typical audience has come to expect.  Certainly, a calculated and gutsy move, Passion of Mind certainly pays off -- especially for the viewer who has the attention span to invest in a film with no fast moving action sequences.
The result is an amazing ride, an amazing story, and an amazing performance.  The film is truely more in the independent style/art-house vein than that of Striptease and the results are surprisingly astounding.  As a 22 year old male, take my word that if thought-provoking, character driven materail is something you may enjoy, Passion of Mind is your ticket.
William Fitchner co-stars as Demi's New York self's love interest.  Here he shows amazing range and a quiet calculation of his part.  In following his roles as of late, from the dreadful Drowing Mona to his compelling The Perfect Storm character, Fitchner definately delivers a quality to the role that may have been lost with other actors.  Moore, exquisetly and subtley demostrating the differences between the neurotic, insecure New York literary agent and the calmed, mourning South-of-France widow, demonstrates, surprisingly well the overriding instability in two very different characters.
Passion of Mind, ... certainly deserves a look -- especially if what motivates you in a motion picture experience is, in fact, just that -- the experience (in lieu of playing Joan Rivers to the costumes or critiqueing Demi Moore's career choices).  I've got Passion for this quiet, thoughtful, beutifully shot and acted sleeper piece.",973814400,7,2371,5.202099737532809
1107846,3,6306005153,"It appears that this woman has one life as a high-powered exec in New York and another completely different existence as a homemaker and mother in a French countryside of jaw-dropping beauty. (If her French life ever becomes available, I want it!) The appeal of this film is the insight that chosing one thing prevents others that may be equally marvelous. Worth seeing once. The little girls, especially the five-year-old, were adorable.",971481600,,438,5.097222222222222
1107847,4,6306005153,"How much one enjoys this film depends greatly on how much of Demi Moore you can stand.  If you like long drawn out schmaltzy romances with Demi as the romantic heroine, you will love this film times two.  Otherwise, hide any weapons lest you begin attacking your screen.
This film was toasted by the critics, but I didn't think it was that bad.  In fact, I liked it.  I guess I fall more into the first (sucker for schmaltz) category.  The story was criticized as being a contrived version of ""Me, Myself I"", where a woman is torn over the choice between life as a professional and the family shtick.  That criticism really misses the point.  This is a story about a woman's psychological attempt to deal with her traumatic past and has nothing whatever to do with lifestyle choices.
I found this to be an intelligent and complex character study of a woman who seems to be two people living two lives, but really isn't.  If that seems cryptic, see the film and it might become clearer.  When she goes to sleep from her life with her children in France, she wakes up to her high-powered career in New York and vice versa.  She can't determine which is real and which is a fantasy.  She has a lover in each life and both seem very real to her.  As the story unfolds, she and we try to figure out which is her real life and which is the dream.
The trouble with the presentation is that its real intrigue lies with the psychodrama.  Unfortunately, neophyte director Alain Berliner pushed that element to the background and cranked up the schmaltz machine, centering the story on the romances instead.  That wouldn't have been so bad if they weren't so interminable.  Scene after scene retraced the same romantic theme, until it became frayed.
Other than the misplaced emphasis, the film was well crafted.  There were subtle hints throughout about which was the real life, but they were far from obvious tip-offs.  However, when we finally discover the truth, it takes forever to wrap up the loose ends.  To Berliner's credit, the locations were breathtaking, in both France and New York.  It is easy to find beauty in the French countryside, but these were some of the most wonderful film perspectives I have ever seen of New York's skyline and street vistas.
After enjoying a few years as one of the highest paid entertainers on the planet, Demi Moore disappeared for three years.  This was probably not the best vehicle for her return.  Her performance was strongly emotional but one-dimensional, failing to differentiate the characters sufficiently.  She played the high-powered NYC girl to be just as wimpy as the insecure girl in France.  To be fair however, she created two very appealing and vulnerable romantic characters and deserved better notices than she received.
William Fichtner was not the greatest choice for her NY love interest.  Fichtner is better at abrasive antagonist roles and his attempts at sensitivity came across as far too pathetic.  Stellan Skarsgard was much better and made a dashing and attractive romantic figure.
This was a good story that took a sentimental detour under the guidance of an inexperienced director.  Still, it was engrossing and even touching at times.  I rated it a 7/10.  Add a point if you like sentimental pieces and subtract at least two if you aren't a Demi Moore fan.",970704000,,3321,4.7386759581881535

1107849,5,6306005153,"I was dragged to this film by friends and I'm so glad I was! This is a story of a young woman who seems to be living a duel life. Which is real? We don't know. Along the way we meet people and experience situations that may just tell you about yourself. Not quite a character-study, this is a wonderful story of perception and emotion and left me with a feeling of satisfaction. I don't know why this film is doing so badly in the theaters. Maybe people just don't understand how to feel anymore, they just want to see explosions and sex. I'm glad Demi chose this film to return to the big screen. It's easy to see why she did it.

1108069,5,6306005153,I happen to like Demi Moore and this movie was amazing. She has to play two almost opposite characters who are actually the same person and she pulls it off so smoothly it's hard to keep telling yourself it's the same person. That has some to do with the plot but I'm not here to describe plot. The DVD was brand new and I am glad to have it as part of an extremely selective DVD collection.,1376092800,,391,4.090909090909091

Unfortunately the script has no real depth and there is no opportunity for the viewer to connect with the characters and actually care what happens to them.  This is lightweight drivel!  It is neither a romantic ""chick-flick"" nor a highbrow arthouse movie, in fact it doesn't really know what it wants to be.  Quite why either of the leading men would be remotely interested in Demi Moore's character I just don't know!  Don't waste your money...........",1331596800,,568,4.814432989690721
1108074,4,6306005153,"I think most Americans might have a hard time with this film because it is like a foreign flick - French type of film - where the movie is character driven. After all the crap Demi did after Ghost, she took a chance on this film and she worked with actors not there to be celebrities. They are just masters of their craft and she kind of is better because of them. I think women would appreciate this film the most. don't write it off because you didn't see it in theaters. Rent it if you can. I will buy it at one point because this is a film I would go back to again. I love her dress in this film because her body was actually covered in an eclectic way - she stepped outside of her comfort zone and she isn't covered in heavy make up.
Character films are good to see as much as the action packed and others because they all give us different perspectives and widen our point of view on life.",1256774400,,895,4.062146892655368
1108075,4,6306005153,"In this film, which I have watched several times, you may draw different conclusions with each viewing.

At least that was my experience.

The premise is that a woman, with a fragmented personality sustained through grief, is living in two separate worlds:  The French countryside vs. Manhattan.  Mother of two young children vs. single career woman.

Each life contains the possibility for love and fulfillment.  But the woman stands slightly apart in each world, never really giving herself over to it.  As if by detaching, she will not be hurt.

Demi Moore's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passion-of-Mind/dp/B00004W5UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passion of Mind</a>&nbsp;was truly captivating.  She is believable, vulnerable, and fascinating.

Sometimes I hoped that she would finally resolve the fragmentation and end up as ""Marie"" in France, while other times I was rooting for ""Marty,"" the Manhattan career woman.

In the end, the pieces gradually fall into place until you wonder why you didn't suspect that everything would turn out this way.

As you can tell, I liked it well enough to watch it again and again.  I deducted one star because I would have enjoyed seeing a little more angst from a character who was so clearly torn between two worlds.",1255737600,,1318,5.562814070351759
1108076,1,6306005153,"I give this boring piece of garbage 1 star without hesitation.

I'll be the first to admit Demi Moore doesn't do a whole lot for me.  She never has, but I'll always be willing to give her another chance because I believe it's only a matter of time before every actor and actress releases SOMETHING good.

Well, maybe that golden moment for Demi is coming up ahead, or maybe not.  With a boring movie like Passion of Mind, I hope she eventually does something captivating and forgets all about this snorefest of a typical love story (or ""light"" mystery if you prefer... yeah right).

This movie is totally not what I was expecting going by the description.  A woman has trouble knowing what's real and what's a dream, and has to go through life that way.  She wakes up and you're not sure if what she's experiencing is all a dream or reality.  Sounds like a perfect mystery or drama to me... unfortunately it's nothing like that at *all*.

Instead it's basically a love story between two people that enter her lives and it's extremely difficult to pay attention to THIS kind of dream or reality. The storyline that had so much potential originally has now been reduced to nothing more than a mediocre love story.

The two men in her life are very dull.  Dreadfully dull in fact.  They are almost completely pointless because both characters are *that* boring.

That's not the only problem.

Sometimes a storyline focuses on the main character of the film constantly (in fact, that's how it should be).  This movie is more about focusing on Demi Moore and nothing else.  Forget about the fact you're watching a movie- the camera has to be on Demi Moore all the time because she likes the attention.  So that's another problem I have with the film- it's basically the Demi Moore Show taking place.

Just a very very below average movie that could have been a heck of a lot better.",1251849600,,1877,4.568862275449102
1108077,5,6306005153,"I absolutely rank this in my top 5 favorite movies.  For many people, we think about the road not taken...or the man we didn't marry etc...  This movie is amazing in that you get to see Demi live two different lives and you don't know which one is real.  They are both perfect lives in their own right and you struggle along with the characters.  This is a great chick flick and also a great movie for men who want to earn bonus points with their girlfriends (if the women are sentimental).  Get this movie and watch it with your girl...she'll adore you for it.",1215993600,,561,4.304761904761905
1108153,3,6306005153,"There've been a lot of Demi Moore pictures which have done nothing for me. Eg, Ghost. But this one just stays with me. Partly because she has not one but two excellent, hot leading men (yes, I'd say it's a girl flick). Partly because she really does have that ""star"" quality, the energy that pops off the screen, the haunting, slightly hoarse voice. Ok, the writing is a tad uneven, but I'm able to take the occasional awkward line in stride in favor of the compelling performances, including actors Stellan Skarsgrd and William Fichtner. (I do think the title of the film stinks: oh, well.) The production design is topnotch and Demi has some excellent costumes. Ladies, add this to your collection.",1193097600,,700,4.745901639344262
1108154,4,6306005153,"I bought this movie on the spur of the moment -because my favorite actor, William Fichtner, is in it- and actually enjoyed it. The plot (other reviewers have done a great job of describing it) is developed slowly and methodically, which gives the viewer time to care about the characters and their choices. I have never seen Demi Moore in this type of role (the last movie I saw her in was ""G.I. Jane"") and I think she did a pretty good job. I normally have zero patience for female characters who have the ""problem"" of deciding between two men but ""Passion of Mind"" had such an interesting twist that I didn't mind. The scenery of France is absolutely gorgeous and made the slooooowwww scenes set in France a little easier to sit through. Of course, in the real world a choice between any other man and William Fichtner is a no-brainer, but in this case, I'll make allowances for mental illness, scarred childhoods, and parallel universes. I would recommend ""Passion of Mind"" if you enjoy movies that take a while to unfold and if you are more interested in psychology of love than the usual zippy romantic comedies. If you are looking for a more fast-paced, less psychological romance, definitely pass this one by for ""Sliding Doors"" with Gwyneth Paltrow and John Hannah.",1176163200,2,1273,4.6875

1108234,4,6306005153,"This film got spanked righteously in the press and Demi Moore, leading lady, earned a Golden Raspberry (not a compliment) for starring in it.
But was this film as bad as the critics made it out to be? I certainly don't think so. While it is true the dialog was somewhat mundane and the leading men unsexy, the film really seemed to focus on the question of ""what is reality?""
The premise of a woman who fragments her personality in her dreams to the point of psychotic delusion is fascinating. Fully functional when awake in either world, at first it is hard to tell which woman, New York Marty or Provence Marie, is the ""real"" one. But the director carefully controls the colors and temperature of the light. At first, Provence is sunny, warm and misty, New York is blue and cold. Even the skin tones of the actors change with the venue. But as Marty/Marie begins to integrate her personality, the colors shift in the cinematography. Moore is careful not to overact--her Marie or Marty is rather equivocal in her madness or sane-ness. Perhaps the critics wanted more ravings from her.
This is a cerebral film; no mad fugues with wild yelling and screaming and blood and guts. Instead, you have to see if you can psychoanalyse the fragmented mind of Marty/Marie and come up with a plausible explanation. If you get it right, you meet the end of the film with cries of ""Ha, I knew it!"" If you don't get it right, you get a pleasurable surprise. Either way, a fascinating psychological drama and well worth viewing.",1045958400,47,1513,4.607407407407408

She is living one life in reality and one in her dream world. She alternates between living in N.Y. and France. In France she is Marie. In N.Y. she is Marty. At first, not even the viewer can figure out which life is real.

When Marty/Marie falls asleep, she enters a fantasy land of her dreams, fears, sorrows and past pleasures. At some point she looses track of which world is a dream and which one is reality. She wants to live in both worlds because in each she finds significant fulfillment. She wants to figure out which world is real and says:

Her fantasy world does not seem to be harming her real life, but her real life seems
to be slowly destroying her fantasy/dream world. In both worlds, she falls in love with a caring man. In France, Marie falls for a writer (Stellan Skarsgard) who says he will fight for her, but keeps reminding her of when she gave his book a bad review. His theory of life is to always do what you wish you could. He wants Marie to love what he writes and to have her think he is amazing.

In New York, Marty is a business woman in love with a man (William Fichtner) who says he doesn't want to date her, he just wants to be interested in who she is and enjoy her. Marty asks him if he could ever care about anyone enough to save them from themselves and he proves he can by accepting her totally for who she is.  She finally realizes that he is the man she has been writing all her stories for and gives them to him to read.

A beautiful thoughtful movie, especially the scenes in France! To me, this is about women who feel they have too many responsibilities and feel the need to escape to a more peaceful and romantic existence.

Anyone who didn't enjoy this movie, has never dreamed about living in France. Oh, I would be there in a minute. Provence, I will see you in my dreams.

Completely Captivating,
Romantic
and fulfilling
on many levels.

If you love foreign films, you will enjoy the artistic
nature of Passion of Mind.

The movie rolls through your mind and creates a new vision for film-watchers..  Demi plays a woman who is living two lives..  one is a parisian housewife and mother of two..  the other is a new york upper class business woman..  every night when the halves go to sleep, the other takes over..  she falls in love with two men and confides in them about the other life and the other man..  she is faced with problem of figuring out which life is real and which one is dream..  and the end was a real shocker.. if you like Demi, you must see this..",982195200,5,665,4.1328125
1108239,3,6306005153,"The possibilities for this basic story idea were endless, however I do not think that the movie took this story to its fullestest potential.
The story is of a woman, played by Demi Moore, who seems to be two people living two lives, but really isn't. When she goes to sleep from her life in France (where she is a widower with two children and works as a book reviewer), she wakes up to her second life (a high-powered career woman in New York) and vice versa. She can not figure out which is her real life and which is a fantasy. The main plot of the movie is her struggle to figure out which is which.
This is a great idea for a movie.  The beginning sets up the plot very well and then seems to go on-and-on and does very little to expand on this great concept.  Everything is tied together neatly, and with some creativity, in the end.  However, the film really dragged in the middle.
Demi Moore's acting was good and believable.  However, the script was so reptitious that I don't think there was enough of a screenplay for her to make the movie any better then it was.",978739200,,1074,4.275862068965517
1108240,2,6306005153,"Demi Moore was so ubiquitous in the '80s and '90s that it was easy to take her for granted.  But the three years since G.I. Jane and Deconstructing Harry (both 1997) represent the longest amount of time she's ever been away from the big screen.  The good news is that Passion of Mind represents something of a change of pace; the bad news is that it doesn't fulfill the promise of its intriguing premise or the potential of Belgian director, Alain Berliner, who made such an impression with his Golden Globe winning debut, Ma Vie En Rose (1997).
Like Sliding Doors (1998), Passion of Mind is about a woman living two lives.  The twist is that she's living both of them at the same time.  In one, she's a single Manhattan businesswoman; in the other, a widowed mother living in the French countryside.  Neither can tell which life is real and which is the dream (and both are so idyllic, it's hard to believe either could be real).  And so Marty/Marie starts seeing a therapist in each life.  She also meets and falls in love with a businessman in New York (William Fitchter) and a writer in France (Stellan Skarsgard).
Screenwriters Ron Bass (Snow Falling on Cedars, Entrapment) and David Field have basically written a Hollywood version of a European art house drama and, just as Marty/Marie is unable to reconcile the two halves of her life -- until the end of the movie -- Passion of Mind never quite comes together either as a splashy romance (there's little chemistry between Moore and her on-screen paramours) or as a serious examination of psychological/philosophical dislocation.  But Demi Moore fans should be pleased to have her back where she belongs and to see her branching out into new directions.",978566400,10,1711,4.737373737373737
1108241,3,6306005153,"This when I read the description seemed very much like a movie that I saw several years ago by Kathleen Turner called Julia Julia.  However it was not.
The basic story is that a young woman is a widow in France with two young daughters and a close neighbor friend.  She each night while sleeping lives a dual life in New York as a high powered executive.  Besides the obvious time discrepancy (you only sleep about 8 hours and kids that get sick wake you up in the night) it seems unlikely that the logic works to support this.
It is a compelling story none-the-less if you want to suspend logic for the hour and 45 minutes.  She in both lives meets someone and then tells the significant other of her dream life.  This was why she could not sleep overnight with either of her significant others, so she told them why.  Of course they become jealous of the ""other"" man.  She sees shrinks in both lives for this duplicity, she seems to be living.  The shrink in New York seems aghast that he might be considered a figment of her imagination.
Without giving the story line away, it is an interesting movie.  I found the views in France to be breathtaking.  I would love to visit there.  They even made NY city look good. I'm not much of a city person, so this took alot.
If you like romanitic movies this one is definitely in that genre.  However, it gets confusing towards the end and the director does not wrap things up in a fashion where you can understand quickly what is going on.  In fact after musing about the movie for a little while there is still some loose ends hanging in my mind about what different things meant.
Demi Moore's character Marty/Marie comes across at some point as a very self absorbed character expecting people to dote on her problems and concerns.  It is amazing how little with the exception of the birthday celebration, that she offers to the people around her.  Her ""friend"" in France and her love interests seem quite content to indulge her excentricities and ignore their own needs.  Not very realistic, but then this is a movie.
It was an interesting movie, no more no less.",975801600,,2110,4.469973890339426

7899315,5,6306005153,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is emotionally sensitive, intellectually satisfying, and artistically beautiful. It is a psychological mystery story with a heavy dose of romance that could easily have degenerated into pop psychoanalysis or embarrassing sentimentality, but it does not. The acting is exquisite. Because I could not rent or stream the movie, I recently bought it to see it again and noticed many details that I missed the first time I saw it and I am sure that I will notice many more when I watch it again. The details I refer to are clues to the mystery and also sometimes foreshadowing of what will come later in the movie. I cannot praise it enough -- and I am not easy to please in the movie department. I think the producers did not promote it properly when it first came out. I hope they find a way to bring it back and make it available to more people who, like me, appreciate good acting and a well-constructed plot.",1416441600,3,960,4.4602272727272725
