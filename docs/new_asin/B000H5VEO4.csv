8136806,5,B000H5VEO4,"This is a must have if you are a fan of true road racing. This was filmed about two years before Robert's tragic death in 2008, and consists mostly of interviews and great footage of his record 15'th win at the North West 200. Interspersed with a long interview with Robert are interviews and insights from his parents, mechanics, friends and supporters and some great vintage race footage.
 Robert was a brilliant rider who beat the best of the best during his prime years, including his more famous older brother Joey. His career was only hampered by injury, some of wich would have ended any other riders interest in the sport. The guts and determination he shows to regain his strength and return to the track are almost unhuman. Amazing strength of spirit, and a genuine good man.
