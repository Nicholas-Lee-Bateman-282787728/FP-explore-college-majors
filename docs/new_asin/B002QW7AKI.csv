3967832,1,B002QW7AKI,"This is a typical Lifetime/Oxygen/ Womans Network kind of movie.  Very boring.

3967833,1,B002QW7AKI,"This is one of the most unintentionally funny and convoluted movies that I have ever seen in my life. Michael Douglas used to have an illustrious and charismatic career. He now resorts to associating and SELLING his name to a movie in which he appears for less than 15 minutes total screen time. (Sort of like the has-been Val Kilmer's appearance in recent Dead Man's Bounty where he is dead in the whole movie and is not a part of the plot in any shape and manner). Jesse Metcalf and Joel David Moore portray two reporters and are two of the worst actors in the world. Their attempt at relevance and hip is to grow two day growth beards and to act like Jimmy Olsen, cub reporter. However, Jimmy Olsen is MENSA material compared to these two very unpleasant people. I'd rather watch wood warp and paint chip than see these two again. The plot basically is about an up-and-coming district attorney on his way to governorship who is suspected, by these two rodent parasitic reporters, of planting evidence to win every case that he tries. Their idea of implicating him is for one bearded wonder to actually implicate himself in a murder crime, record a journal DVD of specific points of innocence, get busted and then see what additional evidence the DA plants. This is a very, very bad idea just in case something goes wrong. And it's a bad idea for a movie because everything goes wrong in the film. Examples of bad filmmaking include the partner cub reporter rushing to his safety deposit box to retrieve the DVD evidence of innocence and being in a high speed car chase with a stereotypical mean police officer. This scene was obviously put in just to hasten the action, in an otherwise boring story. Examples of faulty logic includes the beautiful Amber Tamblyn, also as an up and coming assistant to Michael Douglas, sleeping with the inept reporter after one night of Chinese fast food. They compare sexy stares and then sexy sackings with lack of motive or adequate reasoning as even simple need for lust would have sufficed. The well-off Ms. Tamblyn then asks about the ""L"" word to her Chinese food bed mate. That's love not lesbian. There must be some clinical personality flaw in this DA assistant's trait to jump to and desire to commit without even knowing anything about the person whom she beds. Examples of more faulty logic includes, a 30 second appearance of Michael Douglas, visiting the now charged reporter in prison to taunt him. I'm sure that a high profile DA on his way to governorship would not just show up at prison just in case other REAL, GOOD reporters and photographers may be in the vicinity with questions and 8 by 10 glossies for the next morning's edition. Examples of more faulty logic include Ms. Tamblyn showing up at various sites to investigate the charges against her unshaven lover. Somebody, somewhere, just somehow may recognize her and may tell her ""daddy"" DA is a logic that seemed to have escaped her mind. Then, as a final outcome, the mystery about doctored photographs is solved by untrained geeky student interns, no less, nicely implicating the DA. And the final twist ending, which I will not reveal, came out of left field with no apparent reason or need other than to create coffee pot morning banter at the office for boring state workers. You should either avoid this movie if you are a Michael Douglas fan, of which I am OR see it as a part of a triple feature with Gigli (J. Lo Turkey), Battlefield Earth (always over-rated John Travolta squawker, i.e. also see Taking of Pelham) or Plan Nine from Outer Space (Ed Wood's mohair shocker). You have been warned.",1262476800,9,3617,4.670846394984326
3967834,3,B002QW7AKI,"There are so many questions raised by this film that it is difficult to review it.  The original screenplay by Douglas Morrow (1956) has been 'updated' by writer/director Peter Hyams, and while the concept of the plot is a strong one, it requires rather savvy actors to make it work.  Aside from Michael Douglas as the DA of questionable ethics and court procedings, the rest of the cast is a rather ill-prepared group of nascent actors in need of more experience than in the fluff films from which they came.

C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) enters the Shreveport scene complete with a prize for reporting, eager to make it big and earn a Pulitzer: he seems to have an equal obsession with chasing young pretty women and finds one in the person of Ella Crystal (Amber Tamblyn) who happens to be the assistant to the DA.  Nicholas, and his entertaining co-worker Corey (Joel David Moore), are on to something - they believe that the DA tampers with forensic evidence to win cases, focusing on phony DNA samples rather than thorough investigation.  Out to debunk the DA, Nicholas plans to plant evidence at a crime scene, a stunt he will later use to expose the wannabe Governor DA, and in order to make this work, he places himself as the 'evidential perpetrator' of a crime.  He manages to draw Ella into his circle of lust as well as his overall plan to unseat the DA.  Things change and the ending could have been surprising in the hands of better actors.

The film is heavily padded with the requisite car chases and explosions and derring-do of the good cop/bad cop type, but the real problem with the movie is the weak presence of Metcalfe and Tamblyn.  If the viewer can tolerate the confusing aspects of mixing high humor in the first part with the supposed susupense in the second, then the film is worth the entertainment.  It could have been a stronger film with a cast of professionals. Grady Harp, December 09",1262217600,2,1921,4.640117994100295
3967835,5,B002QW7AKI,"Outside of Michael Douglas, every other character should have been cast with a better actor. If so, this movie would have been through the roof! Still, it was so ingenious that I gave it 5 stars anyway since 4.5 was not an option. Actually, this movie seemed like it was originally a novel. Wouldve been a great read if it was. I CAN NOT BELIEVE THIS WAS NOT A BLOCKBUSTER THEATRICAL RELEASE especially with a proven actor in Douglas.",1261785600,4,434,4.506329113924051
3967836,4,B002QW7AKI,"WOW!  What an ending!  On that note, I'll calm down and give my decidedly biased review of this movie - biased because I've just finished watching it and still have chills running down my spine.  The main actors, Jesse Metcalfe and Amber Tamblyn, are not major stars, but they carry the story very well.  Jesse plays an ambitious newscaster, and Amber is the D.A.'s assistant.  The big name, Michael Douglas, is, of course, the corrupt D.A., although he doesn't see a lot of screentime in this movie.

The plot has already been discussed, so I'll just add that Jesse and Amber are in a lot of frightening situations, and they grab the viewer's sympathies so well that you will find yourself actively rooting for them and hoping that their enemies die soon enough to save the good guys.  However, things are never exactly what they seem, which is what makes this such a good suspense movie.

The beginning is rather slow, hence my 4-star rating, but aside from the first half-hour or so, this movie is, as they say, pulse-pounding. Solidly recommended.",1261785600,2,1051,4.736263736263736
3967837,1,B002QW7AKI,Amateurish B movie remake of a 1956 RKO film.  Uses every cliche in the book.  Awful!  How did they get Michael Douglas to do this film?,1261699200,18,136,4.153846153846154

3967839,5,B002QW7AKI,"I have to be sincere here: I have never seen neither the original 1956 RKO movie from which this remake was made from, nor the remake itself. But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" kept me interested from beginning to end, and it is truly what a great suspense film should be all about.

C.J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) is a young, ambitious reporter, who has been investigating Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas), a powerful District Attorney who is running for Governor. He believes that Hunter wins all his conviction trials by fabricating evidence. However, C.J.'s boss informs him that the budget for investigative reporters has been cut due to low ratings, and that he has been dumped to do general assignments. Not happy with his editor's decision, he takes upon himself to proceed with Hunter's investigation, convinced that this case will make him famous and win him a Pulitzer Prize. For this purpose, he recruits Corey Finley (Joel Moore) -- his friend and colleague -- to help him in his research. He also romances Ella Crystal (Amber Tamlyn), a young attorney that works with Hunter, and unknowingly enlists her to assist him to get her boss. Unbeknown to C.J., he is in for the ride of his life. So do we.

Ably directed by Peter Hyams, who can do great suspense films, and was also responsible for ""The Star Chamber"" (1983), one of my all-time favorite thrillers, ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" delivers until the last second. Curiously, Michael Douglas also starred in ""The Star Chamber."" The DVD also includes audio commentaries by Hyams and Metcalfe, making-of documentary and more.

3967840,4,B002QW7AKI,"I did not expect much from this movie. Mostly because it stars Jesse Metcalfe and Amber Tamblyn. Amber is ok but Jesse Metcalfe clearly needs some more practice. He's so emotionless. This movie would have been even better if he were replaced with a better actor. Sorry, but the guy needs work. I was definately wrong about the film though. This is actually a pretty good film. It's about this reporter that decides to frame himself for murder so he can expose the dirty D.A. played by the great Micheal Douglas. This movie has a really strong script. I don't think anyone with common sense would frame themselves for murder but this movie had me going. It also has this surprise ending that will make your jaw hit the floor. I would definately rent this one. If you can find it cheap on DVD it might even be worth buying.

I would label the movie a cross between Richard Gere's ""No Way Out"" with an ending familiar to ""Gone with the Mind,"" although I did cringe on Amber Tamblyn's unnecessarily use of the ""F word"" at the end of the movie and her readiness to jump in bed with very little character development on her part. While the script might have been limited due to the original version of the film, Tamblyn's part would have been stronger if she had some strong courtroom scenes, aka Marcia Clark and OJ Simpson, but her character was very weak in this film and was morally deficient. She is certainly capable of much more since her courtroom scene in Season 2 of Joan of Arcadia was one of the best scenes of that short lived series. Michael Douglas was of course convincing as DA Hunter. Finally, the manipulation of the evidence in the cases presented in this film were unrealistic at best with the story plot unfolding more like a mystery novel than anything else.",1465171200,,1126,4.606965174129353

see it once. I finally got a VHS of this and for a Hollyweird movie made in last 15 years it's better than average but it doesn't hold a candle
next to the original which everyone should see! that movie is so much better with the theme of a politician who is convicting people of murder
on circumstantial evidence and the state has the death penalty which his is against. The local reporter and publisher who are against capital
punishment scheme up a frame to catch the prosecutor but when the publisher is killed in accident they reporter is about to be sentenced to
death until he's cleared but then more evidence shows he actually did commit the crime! This movie is not even close in the drama and the
twist and turns and of course the acting except for Douglas who is not the main focus of the movie which could have helped make it better.
The lead cast is pretty lame and he has none of the star quality of Dana Andrews who stars in the first one. He's a pretty boy who's pretty
boring. The actor who plays his partner in crime is actually pretty good in his role. The girl another pretty face with pretty boring acting.
This script is different than the original but it does have it's moments and is a good watch for those who don't like classic black and white
movies but I can tell you if you try the original you will see the difference and that movie if far superior to this Hollyweird remake.",1457222400,,1532,4.2320819112627985

In that earlier version the reporter is a writer who's not out to catch a corrupt DA but to get capital punishment banned, so the motivation in the remake is actually an improvement. Also, the newer version has a dark turn at the end that's not in the '56 picture. There's also a couple of well-done action sequences of the sort that were non-existent a half century ago.

Here, Jesse Metcalf is the fifth estater who purposely makes himself look like the perpetrator of a murder. He has an accomplice in acquiring certain pieces of evidence who can prove Metcalf's innocence once DA Douglas does his expected evidence tampering. In the original movie Andrews' ally, future father-in-law Sidney Blackmer dies of a coronary. With the '09 version, cohort Joel David Moore is also eliminated and the exculptory video discs destroyed or stolen. All this after Metcalf is arrested on murder charges and put on trial. Without Moore's help and discs things look bleak for Metcalf. Only his GF, Amber Tamblyn, who's also in the DA's office, is left to try to prove his innocence.

It's always good seeing Michael Douglas, who in this movie has the ""guest star"" as his role of the corrupt lawyer who hopes to become Louisiana's next governor. To this end he'll do anything to win cases, even have people murdered.

One thing that surprised me is the studio that released this drama, good old RKO.

Well, despite what we may have seen before, this film is decent enough to keep an audience's interest.  Suspecting corruption behind the string of in-court victories by District Attorney Mark Hunter, played by Michael Douglas, investigative journalist CJ Nicholas, played by Jesse Metcalfe, sets out to prove his theory and get one heck of a story by framing himself for the murder of a prostitute and recording evidence of the setup to expose Hunter with later.  As planned, CJ is ultimately arrested and charged with the crime thanks to the circumstantial evidence he planted.  But when his friend and cameraman, Corey Finley, played by Joel Moore, retrieves the incriminating (for Hunter) video footage, he is run down and killed by Hunter's apparent partner-in-crime, a local police officer, and the evidence is destroyed.  With nothing to ""exonerate"" himself, CJ is sentenced to death.  From Death Row, he tries to reach out to Assistant District Attorney Ella Crystal, played by Amber Tamblyn, who could be his last hope for exposing Hunter and staying alive.  This film was an okay picture, but it was underwhelming.  The best performance came from Michael Douglas, but his villainous persona remained unbalanced by any such contribution from the good guys.  Jesse Metcalfe was just bland no matter where in the film he was at.  Joel Moore was livelier, but he was seemingly killed off for that reason.  From what I know about her today, Amber Tamblyn could have also done much better.  She could have been wittier and definitely livelier.  Here, she was just the love interest who happened to have a brain at certain points in the plot.  But as far as crime films go, I've seen many worse projects and this film's twist ending was well thought out and wonderfully unexpected.  I also think the final scene was when both Metcalfe and Tamblyn actually tried to put a lot more emotion into their performances.  They didn't succeed, but they certainly moved up a few notches.  If you've got nothing else to do, go ahead and pop this into your DVD player.  Enjoy.",1403654400,,2243,4.914893617021277

3967914,3,B002QW7AKI,"Jesse Metcalfe plays C.J. Nicholas, a young and hungry-for-excitement journalist who frames himself for murder in order to expose the evidence-tampering and phony convictions by the corrupt D.A.of Shreveport, LA. Amber Tamblyn plays Ella Crystal, the pretty young Assistant D.A. who suddenly and rather unconvincingly falls in love with Nicholas and enters into a fall-on-her-sword relationship with him. While I'm not personally a huge fan of Michael Douglas's too-cool-for-words acting style, his fans will probably enjoy his performance as the D.A.

BEYOND a REASONABLE DOUBT is, of course, a remake of a somewhat better 1956 film by the same title. This version is probably worth seeing if you're a not-too-picky legal thriller fan. It's generally well-filmed and keeps your attention with some nice courtroom drama: Sharon London is a standout here as Judge Sheppard. On further scrutiny, however, it's all quite contrived, and the supposedly big twist at the end is awful sudden and tacked-on.

And you are supposed to be tipped off that something is off about the hero because the terrible documentary (bad acting, bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad lighting, you name it) does not deserve the job promotion and his new girlfriend. The documentary is intentionally bad, in other words.  The film itself is almost as bad.  And that does not seem to be intentional. It is a film I watched only for professional reasons.

C. J. Nicholas (Jesse Metcalfe) is a young TV reporter who gets convinced that District Attorney Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas) is planting evidence to get convictions. In fact, he went from having a fairly pitiful record of convictions to one of 17 straight wins. Now he's poised to run for governor, and C.J. is determined to bring him down. Enlisting the aid of his friend in the newsroom, Corey Finley (Joel Moore), he makes a terribly risky plot to get himself arrested for murder and then prove that all the evidence leading up to him was circumstantial, and presumably Hunter will take the bait and plant something conclusive, like blood on his clothes that matches the victim.

Complicating everything, one way and another, is C.J.'s intense affair with Assistant DA Ella Crystal (Amber Tamblyn), who does not know he and Finley cooked the evidence to get the story. That is, until C.J. finds he needs her help.

Nope, can't tell you anymore. Not that I think you will guess the outcome, but since I didn't, I don't want to be humiliated if you do.

And he believes - we don't know why - that high profile District Attorney Mark Hunter (Michael Douglas) is planting false evidence to maintain a high conviction rate. So, in order to expose and publicly humiliate the DA, C.J. devises a contrived plan to set a trap for Hunter by making himself look like a prime murder suspect!

Well, things terribly wrong for C.J., as you expect. This is so terribly wrong that you may start scratching your head wondering why characters including the DA's assistant Ella (Amber Tamblyn) keep doing silly things throughout the film.

The whole premise could be pretty unbelievable back in 1956, when the original ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" (directed by Fritz Lang) was made. In 2010, when most people in America have an easy access to the internet and digital technologies, the story looks simply absurd. In short a reporter doesn't need this elaborate scheme. Of course, everything will be explained in the end, but by the time that happens, most viewers would stop taking the impossible story seriously.

OK, I know this idea, ""willing suspension of disbelief,"" and we often need it to enjoy some classic films. But for the storyline this incredible to really work, we need something - like more round and believable characters, atmospheric cinematography, and most of all, actors and actresses as charismatic and skillful as, say, Humphrey Bogart or Barbara Stanwyck.

What it begins as an apparent sluggish mystery melodrama in which a greedy journalist (who overtly wishes to win the Pulitzer) turns into a real tour de force Noir in which nothing is like it seems and obviously no one is absolute innocent, a basic tenet of this genre in which the reality isn't neither black nor white but grayish.
