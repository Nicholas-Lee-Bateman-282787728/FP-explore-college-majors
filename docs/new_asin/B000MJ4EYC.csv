8169380,3,B000MJ4EYC,"Bilbao ('77) is the earliest film in this three-disc set by the Spanish director Bigas Luna. It's a dark drama-thriller that tells the story of a disillusioned, middle-aged loner who is beguiled by Bilbao, a mannequinesque prostitute. He lusts for her and obsesses over her,  becoming increasingly delusional with the conviction that one day she will be his, body and soul. Bilbao opens with an alluring atmosphere that focuses on mood and gloomy urban aesthetics. Unfortunately, the film begins to disappoint somewhere near the middle as its main character (portrayed by actor Angel Jov) becomes more and more dull and unbearable as the story progresses, leaving little to hold a viewer's attention. The plot plods on and on without much creative development giving Luna's first feature-length film a dense, amateur quality. (3 stars)

Caniche ('79) is the second in this set and the second feature film by Luna. Of the three films included here, it's the strongest offering and the most transgressive in the set. The caniche (or, poodle), Dany, is the star. He provides sweetness and comic relief in a plot marked by delinquency and perversion. The two main characters are a pair of disconnected siblings who seem to bond whenever dog cruelty is involved. If you love dogs and are thinking about giving this a try, prepare to be repelled and/or disturbed. Luna is clearly trying to provoke viewers with Caniche. He makes the leading characters so believable one can't help but think that these kinds of occurrences could happen in any neighborhood. This film should hold the attention of the viewer who looks for the unusual/bizarre and enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the story interesting. Compared with Bilbao, a film which ends up being smothered under its own weight, Caniche surprises, amuses (thanks to Dany), and keeps one guessing. (3.5 stars)

Of the three films in the set, Lola ('86) is the most tiresome with a stereotypical storyline resembling countless drama-thrillers and soap operas from the 80's. It tells the story of a young woman who is mistreated by Mario, her greasy, demented alcoholic lover. She leaves him and soon finds happiness and love with another. However, nearly any viewer knows that  Mario won't allow himself to be so easily discarded. Along with having the least interesting premise of the three films, Angela Molina (as Lola) gives a less than credible performance as a needy, naive character. Her vapid, uni-dimensional personality and good guy/bad guy characters of the leading men are what gives the drama a cardboard quality. For the most part, Lola is predictable and unsatisfying with nothing memorable or particularly entertaining to recommend. (2.5 stars)",1495670400,,2716,5.11036036036036
