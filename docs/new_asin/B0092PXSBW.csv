I highly recommend this to anyone tired of the mind numbing fake science (evolutionism) presented by most media outlets.

8534789,5,B0092PXSBW,"Our five children love this video! They enjoyed the pictures of live animals in the Everglades, the pop-up pictures and facts about each animal, the experts that provided all sorts of information on the animals (while they climbed on Buddy), and the catchy, God-honoring music. Buddy really shows what it means to use your passions and talents for the Lord. I loved learning things as well. A real winner!",1357257600,9,405,4.884057971014493
