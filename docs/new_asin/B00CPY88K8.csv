8584861,5,B00CPY88K8,"I purchased this video for my 68 year old mother who recently had a fall.  Her doctor had told her that she needed to work on her balance or she can fall again; and that in an older age the fall can can cause her more injuries.

The video is great and she loves it.  It is truly easy to follow.  The Physical Therapist speaks slow and clear, and her exercises are simple yet very effective.  She has been using this video to excising  3-4 times a week for the past 2.5 months and says that she clearly feels a difference in herself.  Even her posture is better.  I am buying the video for my 2 aunts and my boyfriend's mother as well.

I definitely recommend this video.",1390608000,,670,4.171875
8584862,5,B00CPY88K8,"This is an excellent exercise program in a video that is very easy to follow.  I use the video 3 or more times a week in addition to attending Geeta's class.  The exercises improve balance and build strength and endurance, and are helpful for osteoporosis concerns, too.  I have been using the video for a few months now, and it was easy to integrate it into my daily routine.  I recommend this very highly.",1383004800,,407,4.45945945945946
8584863,5,B00CPY88K8,"Geeta has done a fabulous and very comprehensive job addressing all the components needed to improve balance and prevent the risk of falls.  This video is very clear and easy to follow.  The combined use of Tai-Chi and specific resistive exercises and flexibility is very effective and unique.  I will absolutely integrate these exercises into my clinical practice and recommend this video to my patients.  This is a very safe program and offers various levels of intensity to accommodate different ability levels.  I highly recommend this video not only for fall prevention, but for a comprehensive exercise program for seniors.",1375488000,,629,5.25
8584864,5,B00CPY88K8,"I am a senior and, though I am in good health, I have had a history of a couple of fractures from falls. I knew I needed to get moving and improve my balance and flexibility. This exercise program has really helped me with my goal . The instructions are easy to follow and the activities incorporate a variety of movements  that work my entire body. I feel good after doing  the video and it does not take that much time out of my day.  Now with people living so much longer, I want to do these exercises regularly to help me feel more energetic and agile as I grow older, and avoid future falls that beset so many seniors and affect their quality of life.",1374451200,,656,4.190476190476191
8584865,5,B00CPY88K8,The instructor Geeta offers effective band exercise moves that are easy to follow. I'm impressed and definitely recommend this dvd.,1374451200,,131,5.6
8584866,5,B00CPY88K8,"My father is in his mid 60's and suffers from a surgery gone wrong. He's forced to walk with canes due to severed nerves in his spine. He also has little to no feeling from his waste down. I got this DVD and the resistive bands for him and he loves it. He says it's really easy to do and he's happy he now has some exercises that someone like him can handle.

His doctors all tell him it's really important for him to get some exercise so he doesn't get worse. It's hard enough seeing my Dad sitting around all the time (he used to be very active), and when he does walk, using the canes... We feel this DVD and those resistive bands are deffinetly assisting in keeping him at this state.

My grandmother is turning 91 this year and gets absolutely no exercise. I'm probably going to get hers next... I've just got to get her into the technological world first. She doesn't have a DVD player, let alone know how to use one if she did. It will be a great asset to her though if I can train her how to use a DVD player.",1374364800,,1017,4.08
8584867,5,B00CPY88K8,"Don't fall! Stand up!
This video improves balance tremendously, while still being relaxing and energizing.
The teacher's instructions are very clear and concise, and the exercises are never
boring.",1373328000,,197,5.827586206896552
