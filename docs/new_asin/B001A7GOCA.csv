3446374,4,B001A7GOCA,"This is a collection of sci-fi short stories, basically making this the genre of THE OUTER LIMITS.  The stories are all independent of each other & cover such sci-fi genres as artificial intelligence, the end of the world & genetics / genetic engineering.

The DVD is hosted by the great Stephen Hawking.  Some know him as the Lucasian professor of mathematics, Cambridge university.  Others know him as the author of the mega-popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Brief-History-of-Time/dp/0553380168/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Brief History of Time</a>.  Still others know him as the ""really smart dude in a wheelchair"" (Hawking has ALS).  In any case, it's terrific to have him as a part of any science fiction gathering.  To be sure, however, Hawking only has a couple of lines to introduce each story, and occasionally has something to say @ the epilogue.  Hence, calling him a host might be stretching things a wee bit.

For the stories, my favorites were A CLEAN ESCAPE and JERRY WAS A MAN & THE AWAKENING, all of which are on the first disc.  The ensemble of actors / actresses is impressive, and it's obvious that Anne Heche has a great time w/her role as a Paris Hilton type of spoiled brat in JERRY WAS A MAN.

LITTLE BROTHER could have been better if they had stretched out the story some more.  The concept of courts run totally on AI is an interesting one, but the story was a bit too weird for me to really get into.

If you like shows like THE OUTER LIMITS and THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this one is certainly worth picking up.  It has stories by some of the best sci fi writers in the business.",1220313600,,1651,4.892086330935252
3446375,4,B001A7GOCA,"This is a compilation of 6 episodes from the first and only season of Masters of Science Fiction. There are 6 episodes of this show on two DVD's. I found the episodes of variable interest, some stories resonated more with me than others. Overall 5/6 of these episodes feature dark subject matter in a bleak future where humanity, despite its best intentions goes horribly wrong in some way.

****Warning: Reviews/Synopsis may contain spoilers.***

The Escape
A man with mental illness with amnesiac symptoms consults an unsympathetic psychiatrist who tries to shake him free of his memory lapses. As the psychiatrist begins to run out of time to treat her patient, she begins to use more extreme measures to cure him of his condition. Is  everything truly what it seems, or is something sinister going on? 2/5 star

I found this episode to be somewhat tedious, and considering this is the first episode,  I worried this didn't bode well. I didn't like the psychiatrist character that much. She came off as cruel and jaded. Granted, she had her reasons, (which are revealed) but she was difficult to like.  There was too much sitting around talking as Havelmann struggles to remember. The twist at the ending I was only meh about. I was more interested in the people and how they lived than in the situation  they were in, than the struggle between doctor and patient which I was only lukewarm about. To me the therapist came off as vengeful rather than... Therapeutic.  2/5 stars.

The Awakening
A downed chopper in Iraq is the scene of the opening for this second episode. As two soldiers... An American and an Iraqi discover they can communicate and encounter an alien cocoon. When they are eventually rescued they are discovered comatose and  are taken back ot base, where Alien expert Terry Quinn is called in to investigate

I liked this episode much better than the first. Mostly because I liked the characters more, and there was a wee bit more action. Terry (of Lost fame), is a great actor, and I was intrigued by the aliens. But I lost enjoyment with the rather heavy message, which despite being a good one, was about as subtle as a kick in the face. Meh... . 3/5 stars.

Jerry Was a Man
In the future humanoid robots are used to as disposable labor for a jaded group of elite. When a spoiled rich woman grows attached to a cyborg named Jerry, she goes to great lengths to free him from becoming puppy chow.

I liked this one the best of the first 3 episodes. It was humorous and light-hearted and the acting was great. (Anne Heche as Martha Von Vogel) (Malcolm McDowell as Tibor Cargrew). I also thought the CGI for the elephant was adorable. Unlike the first 2 the subject of Nuclear War was not mentioned. Thank Heavens.  5/5

The Discarded
This short opens on a spaceship where a group of horribly mutated humans are living in poor conditions. After a delegation from earth makes an offer these outcasts cant refuse will it prove to be too good to be true?

This was a well thought out short story by Harlen Ellison. The characters were interesting, and I particularly enjoyed the wedding and I especially liked  Bedzyk. I would like to see more set in this universe, particularly what was going on on earth. On the flip side, the subject matter was a bit bleak. (A society of outcasts who are used and discarded like old toys). I wanted these people to have a happy ending. I guess not. 4/5

Little Brother
A man escapes a work camp in a bid for freedom. Instead he finds himself behind bars and tried for murder. Can he triumph over the justice system ran by computers?

I enjoyed this episode. The main character was sympathetic, and the idea of a computer judge and jury was intriguing. Negatives? I was a bit surprised that the 'judge' was so easily discombobulated. Surely this can't be the first intelligent criminal to hit its court. 4/5

Watchbirds
A scientist designs a robotic bird for military purposes. When greedy developers insist he use the bird to patrol domestically, the designer resists, will the watchbirds be the latest victim in the government's bid for power?

I think this was my favorite episode on disk 2. I thought the birds were really cool, the future, interesting, and how the story played out towards the end had a nice twist. I thought the concept of the mentor bird and her flock was intriguing. 5/5",1220054400,,4348,4.650130548302872
3446376,5,B001A7GOCA,"It doesn't surprise me in the slightest that the bad review came from a right wing Republican War-Monger... they obviously don't get it! I can only conclude they must all have some kind of brain damage... The first two stories(disc 1) are excellent and the ""anti-war"" messages are most appropriate in this day and age where we are at the mercy of an idiot president... much like the one portrayed in these two stories! Old thinking just isn't good enough anymore people!... Humanity can not survive it! --- The remaining 4 stories are still quite good, even tho they do not have the same impact, with the possible exception of the 1st story on the second disc, which is a scathing commentary on how we americans shun and hide away those of us born with physical deformities... again very emotive, unfortunately the message is once again beyond the level of thinking required by the people who most need to learn this lesson about life and man's inhumane treatment of each other... very sad, very sad indeed... --- I wholeheartedly recommend these six stories to those few thinking people left on this planet... all 13 of you!",1219104000,2,1125,4.744897959183674
3446377,5,B001A7GOCA,"Whilst skipping through the usual summer rerun fare last July, I happened upon this program in time to see the Harlan Ellison novella made 'live'.  I was stunned by how beautifully made this episode was and it sticks with me still, and then I never managed to see another episode.  I was so disappointed to see that it didn't last, though I wasn't at all surprised.  The network spent nothing on advertising and missed out on what could have been a huge audience; I had hoped that perhaps it would reappear this summer for a few more stories, but no, it was obviously too complex for the network execs to comprehend.

Basically, I loved it.",1217548800,28,640,4.539130434782609
3446378,5,B001A7GOCA,"News and rumours of the excellence of ""Masters of Science Fiction"" had been rampant.  Throughout the media, praise was unanimous for  this series.  Having watched an episode with my wife, I caught disjointed bits and pieces that left me wondering.

With the release of the series due out August 5th, 2008, Anchor Bay is about to shatter the world of TV. TV screens today are filled with reality shows, crime detection masterpieces, family comedies with insipid role models, and cartoons of questionable quality.  ""Masters"" surely changed that.  Watching the series in sequence (6 episodes-2 unaired) you get the feeling that intelligence has once again become fashionable on TV.

Based on classic speculative fiction by Harlan Ellison, Robert Sheckey, Robert Heinlin, John Kessel, Howard Fast, and Sam Egan, ""Masters"" revisits the arena left vacant for so long by the departure of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Outer Limits"".  Not only did the producers select strong stories, but also a stellar cast that includes John Hurt, Terry O'Quinn, Sam Waterston, James Denton, Brian Dennehy, Anne Heche, and Sean Astin.  Directors Jonathan Frakes, Michale Petroni,  and Harold Becker  conduct a philosophic discussion of what might be.

To say this series is intelligent and overdue is an understatement.  The six episodes are  ""the Awakening"", ""A Clean Escape"", ""The Discarded"", ""Jerry Was A Man"", ""Little Brother"", and ""Watchbird.""  The episodes ooze style, class, and an approach to production not seen since the Indy Chronicles.  Which one stands out the most?  ""Little Brother"" is stunning.  Walter Mosley's short story about a time when automated justice dispensed by absorbed personalities is  commonplace is frightening.  Fredon is accused of murdering two policemen and a young child, but found innocent after he proves the policemen lied, causing a breakdown in the system.  The truth was too much to handle.  Clifton Collins Jrs' portrayal of Fredon is bang on for a man doomed to die, yet refusing to die without causing change.  ""The Discarded"", based on an Ellison novella, is the ultimate story of minorities and diseased floating adrift in space, waiting for a chance to go home to earth one last time.  When hope arrives bearing a promise to take them home, the merest chance is too much to take.  Hope turns to disappointment as faith is replaced by desperation as the army uses them to save themselves, then returns with more discards.  Concepts like genomic mutations, prejudice, and hope are examined in this visually disturbing portrayal of nazi-like death camps of the future.  William Hurt and Brian Dennehy are remarkable in their roles.

A very interesting addition to the series is that of Professor Stephen Hawking as narrator.  Just like Rod Serling before him was the voice of futuristic fantasy, Hawking has become the voice of the scientific future.

We can only hope that this series continues to bring anthologic intelligence to our TV screens once more.  The world of science fiction needs more Masters.

I know that through the years, science fiction has been filled with messages like the dangers of nuclear power, dangers to the environment and soon, but this series just tries to hard to make statements. The episodes seem to want to be cerebral but to they just came off as slow paced and boring. Episode one was very well acted but at the end, I could only think, ""what was the point of the whole story?"" The ending was a dead giveaway from early on and the entire purpose of the appointments were pointless. This was the case with most episodes. The Discarded had an ending we called in the first twenty minutes. Jerry is a man was mildly humerous, but again, the ending was obvious and the episode had no truly likable characters. Little brother had elements of Logans Run and Doctor Who.  Like all the episodes, all the stories had been done before and better. I will say the acting was pretty good but in my opinion, the 'Masters' of science fiction took stories with possibilities and exchanged originality for meeting a deadline.

Each of the stories was awesome in its own right.  Each of the stories painted a vision of the future that was rather dismal in its own unique way.  This is not the rosey picture of the human future painted by Star Trek.  Some might label the future Masters of Science Fiction: The Complete Series portrays as depressing and in a way it is.  These short stories are worthy of Stephen Hawking  who does a good job as a Rod Serling style introduction and epiloge lesson spinner.

Some of the episodes really gave me the creeps.  The Nuclear Winter episode and the Ship full of mutants episode were noteworthy for their sheer powerful creepout factor.  This was some of the best money I spent on great Science fiction in a long time.

Perceived Running Time: 80

Replay-ability: zero...this is one of the rare times I'll actually be reselling a DVD.

Estimated Durability: none. It's one for the trash heaps.

Audience: pretentious sci-fi fan wannabes? Is there such a thing? Someone more desperate for sci-fi than me. Again, could there be such a thing? Maybe you're thinking, ""hey, my friend, lover, significant other...is a real geek! They'd LOVE this."" No. They won't. Don't embarrass yourself.

Why
I dunno. You think it might look good on your shelf? Maybe you have collected every other thing Malcolm McDowell had done and this completes your collection? Nothing positive springs to mind.

Why not
Each episode is pretentious, dull, poorly acted, very poorly produced, and at times even dim-witted. Preachy and sanctimonious, it sacrificed story and art on alters of socio-political ideology like the worst episodes of Star Trek: Next Generation (without the pizzazz). I bought this sight-unseen on the merit of Dr. Hawking's name, several of the writers, and the ""Masters of"" title, following the outstanding Masters of Horror. The Amazon review calls it ""thought provoking."" It was, I suppose, but only barely. One would do better to just read the thought-provoking short stories on which these eps were ineptly based and spare themselves the annoyance of these poorly executed shows. Those short stories, by the way, were some of the authors' weaker works; ABC probably got them cheap. And does Amazon ever give negative reviews? The first story, Clean Escape wasn't too bad, save the shoddy craftsmanship. Nothing too spectacular after that.
Production was hurried and almost amateurish. Actors uncommitted to their parts. Effects and make up were cheesy. It looked like something from the 80's. The futuristic episodes were set in convention centers and stadiums, and the distopian scenes in alleys and factories. All the cliches are there.
I wish I could find something good to say, if only for balance. I'm a ordinarily a real sci-fi slut, but I'm coming up with nothing.

Verdict
Get the old or new versions of the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone. Both versions of either series provide outstanding sci-fi with genuinely ""thought provoking"" material, with artistry and intelligence. Seriously, if you're contemplating getting this and you don't have all the disks of Outer Limits and Twilight Zone (old and new, both), start there and hopefully by the time you've finished watching them there'll be a much more deserving sci-fi anthology available.",1371168000,9,2564,5.226277372262774

The irony is that the last two episodes, which were unaired, are actually pretty good.  Considering the strong cast of actors, I expected much more.  One of my favorite authors is Robert Sheckley.  His story Watchbird was the sixth and last and is the best of the series.  It compares favorably to an episode of the original Outer Limits, which added a subtle moral message to the science fiction.  And who can object to the message of The Day the Earth Stood Still (origianl film)?  The Masters of Science Fiction series mostly forgot the science fiction.  It was a good idea gone terribly wrong.

3446419,3,B001A7GOCA,"It was with great anticipation that I watched this series, which I completely missed on television.  Unfortunately, while the series does indeed have stories based on stories by some of the great authors of science fiction, the execution generally leaves something to be desired.  This collection contains some interesting moments, but I suspect it is doomed to be a curiosity that may negatively influence television executives from trying such anthology shows in the future.

Six episodes were produced for this series.  The series was quite short-lived, and not all episodes were originally televised in the United States.  One problem may be that science fiction in general is not really all that popular.  Much of what people think is science fiction is actually fantasy or science fantasy (e.g., ""Star Wars"" is science fantasy, though too many people mistakenly classify it as science fiction - even people who should know better).  If you are accustomed to watching fantasy or science fantasy, and you suddenly find yourself in a science fiction story, your reactions are not going to be positive and you may, wrongly, find yourself thinking, ""I do not like this kind of science fiction,"" when in reality you may never have liked ANY kind of science fiction.

While the six episodes cover different topics, the range of topics is relatively narrow and may delve too deeply into philosophical and political matters.

The first episode, ""A Clean Escape,"" based on a story by award-winning author John Kessel, jumps into an old theme of science fiction, the hazards of technology.  The theme is strongly oriented in the philosophy of power and the inability of people who have no technical background to understand the technology they control.  The story seemed frustratingly slow to develop, and I longed for something to happen, though it never really did.  The shock value was relatively low when the underlying story was finally revealed, and I thought to myself that this was yet another cautionary tale that I had read too many times.  Perhaps a newcomer to science fiction might be more impressed.  Sam Waterston does as well as he can, and indeed, he probably rises above the material he has.  If you love stories involving the depths of human psychology, this story might be for you.

The second episode is ""The Awakening,"" by author Howard Fast, who has written but a few science fiction stories.  This story is yet another standard theme of science fiction, visitation by aliens who are here to help us, whether we want to be helped or not.  This story was much better than ""A Clean Escape,"" and the story tries hard to get into the motivations of decision-makers.  Unfortunately, when a story is less than an hour long, and the complexities of the subject are as deep as they are in this story, it is difficult to develop the characters to the point where we care about motivations, so one of the primary benefits to the story is never fully realized.  Furthermore, as with the first story, this story is also strongly political, and the political aspects detract from the story, in my opinion.

The third episode is ""Jerry Was a Man,"" based on a short story by Robert A. Heinlein, one of the greatest and most influential science fiction authors.  This story has certain aspects that are humorous, which is a trait of many of Heinlein's stories, while having one or more serious underlying themes.  In the case of this story, the themes are racism, prejudice, and bigotry.  Just what makes a man, and who decides who is human and who is not?  It is easier to appreciate this story when you consider that Heinlein wrote it at a time when there was much racism, and minorities in the United States were often treated more poorly than animals.  As with the previous two stories, there is a political, or perhaps societal, message in this story, but it is much more subtle than in the first two stories.  Anne Heche is a pleasure to watch as she takes command throughout the story.

The fourth episode is ""The Discarded,"" based on the short story by science fiction great Harlan Ellison.  This story combines another standard theme of science fiction, a disease or condition that dooms mankind, with one or more political messages that take a while to develop.  Unfortunately, this story is so negative and develops so slowly that the talents of Brian Dennehy and John Hurt are unable to save this story, which might have been much better and been more powerful in a 20 or 25 minute format.

The fifth episode is ""Little Brother,"" which I consider to be one of the finest episodes of this series.  The story covers yet another standard theme of science fiction, excessive control and interference by government in the lives of citizens.  However, this story breathes new life into the theme by including a different twist in a society that has come to rely on machines and technology far too much to administer that society.  This story is enjoyable, and I enjoyed the twist at the end, which I did not see coming.

The final episode is ""Watchbird,"" based on a short story by science fiction great Robert Sheckley and which stars Sean Astin.  This episode vies with ""Little Brother"" as being the best episode of the series.  While the theme of this story bears some similarities to ""Little Brother,"" it is the execution of the story that makes the story interesting.  The Watchbirds were developed as military technology, and now the government wants to use the Watchbirds for law enforcement (drones, anyone?).  Of course, as tends to happen in many science fiction stories, once someone has power, they always want more power, and the Watchbirds are very powerful, giving whoever controls them what may be the ultimate control over people.  You know that no good will come of this.

Anthology science fiction has been done in the past, and done well.  ""The Outer Limits"" has gone through two incarnations, and both incarnations were executed, overall, well.  Yes, both covered standard themes of science fiction, but not every story was political or philosophical, and focused more on the most fundamental tenant of science fiction, ""what if...?""  Many of the stories had an excellent ""shock"" at the end of the story that I still find shocking, or at least surprising, even today.

""The Twilight Zone"" also addressed science fiction subjects, selecting stories best addressed by the shorter format of that show.  Once again, while the stories were often political, the messages were often so subtle that by the time you realized there was a political or philosophical message, the story was over and you had already enjoyed it.

Sadly, ""The Masters of Science Fiction"" breaks no new ground, and fails to reach anywhere close to the great science fiction anthologies of the past.  The final two episodes, which were not aired during the series initial run on television, were probably the best episodes.  Those two episodes might have garnered an audience that permitted the series to continue.  Instead, the four lesser episodes were aired, likely driving away much of the potential audience.

For the right price, and for a person who loves science fiction, this series is worth having, in spite of my often negative comments.  Casual fans of science fiction should pass this one by.

Honestly this just isn't very *good*. I had hopes I was going to get something along the lines of ""Twilight Zone"" or perhaps ""Tales from the Dark Side"", but instead the stories here are basically second- or third-rate at best.

Production values are fine--as good as anything in ""Twilight Zone""--but the stories just aren't very INTERESTING.  The best one was probably the fifth one, ""Watchbird""....a decent enough tale about robotic police drones gone awry.  Looking at the details I see *why* it's easily the best one, as it's written by J. Michael Straczynski of ""Babylon 5"" fame.

But really that's about it.  A nice try but....just not all that compelling.  Buy it if you're a purist and want to build a really *complete* collection; that's about all I've got to recommend it.",1348358400,,864,4.836734693877551
3446426,3,B001A7GOCA,"I don't have much to say one way or the other about the ""Masters of Science Fiction"" DVD set. It's neither exceptionally good nor unbearably bad. At worst, it's a decent way to kill a few hours, especially if you did not catch the ""acclaimed"" series when it aired on network television (I didn't). At best, it's an interesting example of what can result when world-class screenwriters, directors and actors get together to visually interpret well-known science fiction short stories written by masters of the craft, such as Harlan Ellison, Robert A. Heinlein and Robert Sheckley. The six segments in this anthology (two of which did not air in the original series) are not remarkable by any means. Nor are the acting, special effects and production values anything special. I found the whole thing to be just so-so. I'm glad I had a chance to see the shows, and I may re-watch some of them from time to time, but on the whole I was underwhelmed.

I think much of my lukewarm reaction to this DVD set stems from the mediocre authors' works selected. Specifically, I'm very disappointed in the choice of Robert A. Heinlein's ""Jerry Was a Man"" as the Grand Master's story for this series. In my opinion, virtually ANY other Heinlein short story would have been a stronger, better choice. I can rattle off a long list of MUCH better stories without even consulting my library, classics such as, for example, ""By His Bootstraps,"" ""Goldfish Bowl,"" ""And He Built a Crooked House,"" ""Project Nightmare,"" ""The Long Watch,"" ""Year of the Jackpot"" and ""Sky Lift,"" to name just a few. I can't imagine why the producers of this series picked the relative stinker ""Jerry Was a Man.""

Full-length movies of Heinlein's novels have not been conspicuously successful. Consider, for instance, ""The Puppet Masters,"" which was second-rate on many levels, and the truly execrable ""Starship Troopers,"" an embarrassingly inept, relentlessly depressing gorefest that should not even share the name of Heinlein's masterful novel. ""Jerry Was a Man"" continues the tradition of poor adaptations of Heinlein's stories. In this case, the original story wasn't even that good.

""A Clean Escape"" has a good plot but its roundabout execution lacks the mystery it attempts. The scenario of nuclear winter is a believable topic but i felt little for the characters. ""The Awakening"" is my favorite. Can the motive for an alien invasion be a good one, is the question in this story. The ending is a profound one i don't believe I will forget. ""Jerry Was a Man"" is a bizarre tale regarding robots that left me empty. DISC 2: I found ""The Discarded"" an abstract reminder of the corruption and mistrust of government.

The brief series had a  cast including Sam Waterston, Malcom McDowell, John Hurt, Judy Davis, Brian Dennehy, Anne Heche, Sean Astin and Terry O'Quinn among others. And the episodes were based on the stories of true SF masters. In addition to Sheckley, the authors whose stories were used for episodes included Harlan Ellison, Walter Mosley, and Robert Heinlein.

This collection is rife with this kind of pandering. After the first story, A Clean Escape, (which holds up the best), the series descends into a fest of clichs.

The acting is mostly pretty good and you'll recognise quite a few 'named' actors.  Also, the stories are written by several top of the line authors.

3446442,4,B001A7GOCA,"Overall, this was a fantastic idea with only good execution.  As others have mentioned, this is very reminiscent of ""The Outer Limites"" or ""Twilight Zone.""  However, those programs tackled controversial issues with SUBTLETY.  This series tries a little too hard to be relevant, when it needed to concentrate on entertainment value.  The anti-war message was blatant, and the tried and true ""diversity"" rears its head as well.  That said, there is something to enjoy here.

The acting is top notch with a LOT of recognizable talent.  I love Sam Waterson, Sean Astin and Malcolm McDowell.  If viewers look past the politicizing, the source material is some of the best in the SciFi genre.  Heinlein's writing is usually thought-provoking and the story selected here, ""Jerry was a Man,"" is the best on the disc I think.  In the vein of his masterpiece, ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" it really stands out and the set is worth purchasing for this alone.  Of course, adapting any written material results in something being lost, but the gist is here. Reviewer CFH provides a succinct, if a little harsh, recap of the other episodes.

Overall, I think the network should have given this more of a chance.  I missed it entirely when it aired, and would have made an effort to see it if I had known about it.  For me, the biggest disappointment was the lack of extras.  Producers had a great opportunity to explore the works that inspired these stories, with interviews of the authors still living, their impact on actual scientists (like Stephen Hawking), etc.  That would have made this a must-have.

3446443,5,B001A7GOCA,"Hosted by the voice of Stephen Hawking, Masters of Science Fiction began on American television as an anthology series from the same creators who brought us Masters of Horror. The show debuted on ABC in August of 2007, but was cancelled after four shows. On the DVD, you can view all six of the original shows scheduled to air.

The shows include the following:

A CLEAN ESCAPE is from a 1986 play by John Kessel. It features a dying psychiatrist  attempting to cure the President of the United States of his amnesia in order that he can be held accountable his role in the world's nuclear holocaust.

JERRY WAS A MAN is based on a 1947 short story by Robert Heinlein. It's a futuristic setting that centers on the worlds seventh richest couple and an anthropoid named Jerry. It deals with civil liberties and equal rights.

THE AWAKENING, originally called, The General Zapped an Angel, is based on a short story by Howard Fast. In this episode, two U.S. soldiers outside of Baghdad discover a mysterious casualty, only no one can identify as human.

LITTLE BROTHER written by Walter Mosley is set in the future. The courtrooms exist without human judges or juries. In its place is a computer that decides the fate of the convicted.

WATCHBIRD is based on the short story by Robert Sheckley. A corporation creates a robotic machine originally to assist with our wartime soldiers. When it saves lives the government uses it to fight crime in the US. In the end, it will question if we are willing to sacrifice liberty for security.

THE DISCARDED is based on the short story by Harlan Ellison. Humans born with various mutations are isolated and forced to drift in outer space. Many commit suicide from the loneliness and despair. Hope comes, but they must make a pact with the very people who sent them there to begin with.

Judy Davis, Sam Waterson, Anne Heche, Brian Dennehy, John Hurt, James Denton and Malcolm McDowell are to name some of the few stars of this series. I am sorry to see this canceled as each would make for an enlightening discussion for high school students.",1227052800,,2081,4.67945205479452
3446444,1,B001A7GOCA,"The idea behind MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION is, on the surface, a good one: Draw from some of the best literature of the genre, commission scripts from some of the best screenwriters in the genre, and turn those scripts over to some talented filmmakers.  Good idea, true, but just as with Dr Frankenstein's infamous experiment, the stitching together of these various parts has produced a horrible monster.

Instead of delivering thought-provoking, cutting-edge speculative SF or subtle cautionary tales wrapped in the trappings of SF, these ""Masters"" of Science Fiction offer up ham-fisted, blatantly biased socio-political sermons.  What's more, they can't even keep their politics straight, with at least one of the episodes (to wit, ""The Awakening"") preaching the spiritual beliefs of the Religious Right at the same time that it stands on the complete-disarmament soapbox of the ultra-left.  That's a stitched-up wreck of a Frankenstein monster if there ever was one!

Now, lest you accuse this reviewer of being politically biased, let me state right now that I am a dyed-in-the wool liberal and actually agree with some of the political stances presented in this show.  But I've also been a fan of SF practically since birth, and I can certainly appreciate a dystopian cautionary tale. Indeed, two of my favorite SF novels are George Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR and Ayn Rand's ANTHEM, one of which was written by a disillusioned socialist and the other by a staunch laissez-faire capitalist.  Nonetheless, that doesn't mean that I want to watch a science-fiction TV series where every episode is little more than an anti-American political statement.  And frankly, that's what each of the six episodes of MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION amounts to--40 minutes of ideological propaganda.

On the plus side, the technical skills that went into this short-lived series are outstanding.  For example, the performances from the likes of greats like Sam Waterston, Terry O'Quinn, James Cromwell, Malcolm McDowell, and many others are superb.  Also, the make-up FX for episodes like ""The Discarded,"" a story that centers on a society of genetic mutants, far surpass those of most made-for-TV SF shows.  And the special FX for all the episodes are very well done, with even the nowadays-ubiquitous CGI being used to good effect. Sadly, these positive aspects of the show are too greatly diminished by the in-your-face politics of the writers and directors.

The idea behind this series is a good one: Take the best talents from the genre and use them as the foundation for a TV series.  As a matter of fact, the same idea was employed on the earlier series MASTERS OF HORROR, and that show had a successful two-year run on cable and experienced phenomenal DVD sales.  Unfortunately, when the same producers--Mick Garris, Keith Addis, and Ben Browning, to name a few--applied their idea to a science-fiction series, they let their politics get in the way, and the result is merely a batch of 40-minute agitprop films that are poorly disguised in the trappings of SF. It's really no surprise, then, that MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION lasted for a scant six episodes, and it's almost laughable that the creators of this travesty actually expect people to pay for the-- ahem!--""privilege"" of watching it on DVD.",1226275200,30,3299,5.128731343283582

In an age where the mindless banality of so-called `reality' shows have consumed the American viewing public, thought-provoking shows such as MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION easily fall by the wayside in their first season.

Classic Science Fiction stories do not necessarily offer happy endings for their characters, and the stories in this series often do not.  What they do offer are meaningful plots with underlying statements on the social and political climates that are as relevant today as they were when each story was written years ago.

Why is it called MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION?  Because each episode was based on a novella by popular science fiction authors such as Robert Heinlein, Harlan Ellison, Robert Sheckley, and John Kessel.

The series was cancelled with only six episodes in the can, and so the DVD has just that number of shows.  I enjoyed each to some extent, some more than others.

But my wife Christine, on the other hand, it one bona fide sci-fi nut!  If it's strange and kooky with aliens or parallel universes involved, then she is watching it.  Her eyes won't come off of the Sci-Fi Channel.  So I got this DVD series for her to watch thinking it would be right up her alley.  Ummmmm, NOPE!  She hated it and said it wasn't authentic sci-fi to her.  Sure, there were a few good moments here and there, but most of it was extremely disappointing.  Too bad!  Describing something as ""masters"" raised the expectation level too high.  How about renaming this the ""Amateurs Of Science Fiction"" instead?",1222300800,3,802,4.617021276595745
3446451,3,B001A7GOCA,"We watched the show when it was on the local ABC channel. We liked it well enough & thought it had a lot of potential. But like many Science Fiction shows on networks it never had a chance...or maybe that's ""got"" a chance.

First to the makers of the show: If you are going to call your show ""Masters of Science Fiction"" get more ""Masters"" Robert Heinlein=Master. Robert Sheckley=master. We'll even give you a pass on Harlan Ellison, though he's harder to pin down as Science Fiction...but HOWARD FAST? WALTER MOSLEY? Uh, no...good writers, sure, but not masters of science fiction. How about Phillip Dick, Greg Bear, Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, marion Zimmer Bradley, Sheri Tepper, Ben Bova, William Gibson, Ursula K Le Guin, Larry Niven, Ray Bradbury...I could go on all day with actual ""masters."" When you're starting a new series like this lead with your strong suit and play to your fan base.

Other than that, I think they did a fine job with good strong casts and nice production values. ""Clean Escape"" was taught and very nicely acted. ""The Discarded"" was gross and a bit predictable, but interesting. ""Jerry was a Man"" was quirky and odd. Now that we've seen them all, we liked the whole run.

The DVD is good for fans of the genre especially with the two unaired episodes. Well worth the price if you liked what you saw in 2007 or if you missed its short run entirely.",1222300800,,1379,4.6204081632653065

If you're a scifi fan, you know the one.  Now recall the best episodes of that show:  ""The Sandkings,"" ""The Quality of Mercy,"" ""The Refuge,"" ""Birthright.""  Great short science fiction, from some great writers.

This series is like the best episodes of that show, and it even harken's back to some of the best episodes of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Outer-Limits/dp/B000W8KY0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Outer Limits</a>.  It has stories from some of the best scifi writers, and many of the epsiodes are directed by some of the best scifi filmmakers.  The only real problem is that the series is cut short.  Most of the episodes have servicable effects, but it is obvious in the two unaired episodes that not much money was left for special effects wizardry.

That said, you will be hard pressed to find a better value for your short scifi anthology series.  All these episodes feature great writing and acting, and many of them are based on famous short stories by the great masters of science fiction.  The effects, while not on par with something like Star Wars, are good enough not to distract you from the great stories and great acting.

My particular favorite episode is called ""A Clean Escape,"" which  adapts John Kessel's short story to devastating effect.  There are almost no effects in this episode, and it takes a long time for the scifi element to become readily apparent, but the acting carries it through the poignant script without a hitch.

The only real knock on this DVD set is the lack of extra features.  The disc is bare besides the episodes themselves, and even those menus aren't very well put together.  The DVD release seems to be an attempt at a quick cash-in on a cancelled show, and not the high quality presentation that this series deserves.  Still, the content is beyond compare, and I still hold that to be the real measure of a DVD's quality.",1221696000,,2194,5.421828908554573
3446453,3,B001A7GOCA,"With only four episodes making it to the small screen (and two that never saw the light of day until the release of this DVD set), I'd hardly call ""Masters of Science Fiction"" a true series.  However, Anchor Bay was nice enough to release all six episodes in a standard, thrifty two-disc set.

These television adaptations do very little justice to the short stories they've been based on.  With a collection of authors such as Robert A. Heinlein, Robert Sheckley and Harlan Ellison, you'd be hard-pressed to find better printed material to work with.  However, most of the stories chosen follow the age-old science fiction format of ""man screws up/future looks bleak.""

In my opinion, none of the episodes are stellar.  However, a few do stand above the pack.  ""Watchbird,"" based on a short story by Sheckley, was one of the episodes that never aired on television.  It should have.  It shows you how bad things can go when a weapon designed for military use is integrated into normal society.  ""The Awakening,"" based on a short story by Howard Fast, blends religion and science fiction and comes very near to being great.  The best of the lot is Heinlein's ""Jerry Was A Man,"" and, as expected, it features the most humor of any of the episodes.

The casts for each episode are wonderful, and range from Anne Heche to Malcolm McDowell to Sam Waterston to Sean Astin.  Unfortunately, these actors aren't given a lot to work with.

With just a little bit more hope added to the show, ""Masters of Science Fiction"" could have been wonderful.  Instead, we are offered another run-of-the-mill dismal future to look forward to.  I recommend this series only to hardcore science fiction fans as a purchase.  Everybody else can rent it and skip ahead to the shows I mentioned above.",1221696000,2,1774,4.7639344262295085
3446454,3,B001A7GOCA,"Like most of America, I missed Masters of Science Fiction when it was actually on television, apparently it ran for a month last August on ABC.  It was a spin off of Masters of Horror, a show on a channel I don't get and has the same premise of taking a short story from well respected writers in the genre and turn them into a short film that fits into an hour of television. The DVD set features two episodes that never made it to air.

The cast is decent with John Hurt (Hellboy), John Locke (Lost), Sean Astin (Rudy), Sam Waterston (Law and Order), Brian Dennehy (Romeo + Juliet), Anne Heche (Six Days and Seven Nights), Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange), and James Denton (Desperate Housewives).  Only Little Brother lacks a decent marquee name.  But the real star of the entire series is Steven Hawking who narrates each episode with an intro and outro of them all giving us life lesson of what we should have learned from them.

The stories themselves are your run of the mill Sci-fi stories like living underground in a post-apocalyptic state, the guy whose memory is wiped clean ever hour, the alien visitors, a robot that can feel, mutants that are discarded into outer space, a Big Brother type society, and machines that get too smart.  Most of stories take them too seriously for their own good and only Jerry Was a Man is the only one with a sense of humor about it.

But each stories is at the very least watchable, but only hardcore Science Fiction buff would want to add the DVD, which comes with zero extras, to the library.  For everyone else, Masters of Science Fiction would be a decent add to your rental service if your queue is getting low.",1221696000,,1668,4.5

This was never destined to be that type of series.  If it was ever even given a broadcast chance at all.  I remember seeing The Discarded through fuzzy reception last summer when it aired and I wondered if it looked as cool as I imagined under the layers of interference, it does and the acting by Dennehy and John Hurt is the stuff of great tv.  Other episodes are intellectually stimulating but fall into the view once and done category.  The performances throughout the episodes by the likes of Malcolm McDowell and Judy Davis run the gamut from exceptional to exceptionaly appropriate.  Terry O'Quinn of Millennium and Lost has terrific turn here in his episode.  The overall theme that rides through these episodes might be its downside as a slightly more varied bunch of stories would have been welcome.  It is hard to complain when Scifi of this quality hits the airwaves, except when it is promptly cancelled.

My favorites in the set were the more off-beat episodes, such as ""Jerry Was a Man"" and ""The Discarded.""  These episodes stand out from the set both because they are visually-appealing, and they don't feel as ""preachy"" as some of the other episodes.  ""Jerry Was a Man"" actually has quite a few humorous moments, which was a nice reprieve from the bleak tone of many of the other episodes.  I don't have a problem with science fiction that is political in nature, but I would have liked the series to explore the wide variety of the genre.  Unfortunately, the series didn't last long enough for this kind of exploration.

3446458,3,B001A7GOCA,"I personally abandoned the major networks some time ago, I suspect around when just about every show they put on seemed to be sex obsessed. I have since only gone back to catch new episodes of ""Heroes"". So, it's no surprise that the short-lived ""Masters of Science Fiction"" series came and went on ABC without my ever even knowing about it. I was aware of the more popular ""Masters of Horror"" series from Showtime, even though I don't even have Showtime, but then I'm a bit more into the horror genre and love horror anthologies. One thing that puts me off of Sci-Fi anthologies a bit is that they tend to always be about aliens, bleak futures, and robots. Rarely anything else.

""Masters of Science Fiction"", in all of its six episodes, doesn't deviate from that, and it also is high on making political and social statements. That's pretty common in sci-fi, but it does get a bit old, especially in a world where the political statements on television are getting as monotonous as the sex. Still, over all, this very ""Outer Limits"" TV series is about as good as can be expected. Some episodes are better than others. Oddly, the two episodes I found to be the most enjoyable are the two that never aired on American television, ""Little Brother"" and ""Watchbird"". Here is a breakdown of the 6, 44-minute episodes you get in this complete series, 2-disc DVD set (with zero extras):

""A Clean Escape"" (Story Author: John Kessel, Director: Mark Rydell): A dying doctor's patient cannot remember the past 25 years of his life; 25 years in which the world has been changed greatly as a result of his actions. This one is a little slow and a bit too ""in your face"" with its political statement.

""The Awakening"" (Story Author: Howard Fast, Director: Michael Petroni): A strange visitor to Earth brings forth an ultimatum that could cause the leaders of the world to reach an understanding with or completely destroy each other. This second episode is probably even more in your face with the political statement, but it's more exciting than Clean Escape (which probably could have worked better as a 22 minute program). Starting the series with its two most blatantly political episodes was probably not the best idea.

""Jerry Was a Man"" (Story Author: Robert A. Heinlein, Director: Michael Tolkin): A more lighthearted episode, this futuristic story presents a bored rich couple who take in some unusual ""pets"". One of them is a man-made humanoid that was marked for destruction. The rich woman who now controls his fate soon becomes determined to defend his rights as a ""human being"". This episode was pretty fun, but could have been better if ""Jerry"" had been more likable. He was rather annoying with his constant requests for candy and cigarettes.

""The Discarded"" (Story Author: Harlan Ellison, Director: Jonathan Frakes): An odd collection of diseased freaks exiled from Earth travels through space in search of a new home and is suddenly presented with an offer to return. Yet another I would rather have seen in 22 minutes than 44. This one really drags and I didn't find it that entertaining. Perhaps it's just too much of a downer throughout. Boasts a fine cast though. John Hurt and Brian Dennehy are in this one.

""Little Brother"" (Story Author: Walter Mosley, Director: Darnell Martin): A man trying to escape the confines of the lower levels of urban development finds himself on trial for a murder that was clearly not his fault. However, the judge, jury, and executioner of this future world are not human and lack the willingness to weigh the facts fairly. One of the better episodes, in my opinion.

""Watchbird"" (Story Author: Robert Sheckley, Director: Harold Becker): A young inventor creates the weapons system of tomorrow in a fleet of mechanical birds designed to take out a killer before he strikes. Things get out of hand though, when the government wants to put the birds, designed for war combat, over the streets of the U.S. to protect the citizens. I found this to be, hands down, the best episode of the series. It's the only one that didn't feel it was dragging at any point. A genuinely good episode.

When all is said and done, ""Masters of Science Fiction"" really is about the same as any other sci-fi anthology show. Perhaps a smidge better, because there were more episodes about the future of mankind than about aliens. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this. Of course, it's an anthology, so even at just six episodes it is hit and miss. Still, it's probably better than anything else that's been on ABC for a long time.",1221523200,140,4561,4.764556962025316
3446459,2,B001A7GOCA,"At one time anthology shows were fairly popular, but there came a certain point when they were all, but forgotten. With the release of Masters of Horror the anthology show got a new lease on life, while Masters of Horror wasn't the ratings blockbuster many thought it would be it found its audience. Masters of Science Fiction pretty came out of Masters of Horror with some of the same producers one being Mick Garris.

Where as Masters of Horror felt more like 1-hr movies, Masters of Science Fiction follows the TV format, which isn't a bad thing, but this show just never really works and often seems more messy than anything. The show is also highly political driven and that can be slightly annoying. I have no problems with social commentary, but I hate when I feel like someone's views are being forced on me regardless if I agree or disagree. It seems this show was just made for the filmmakers to get out their political views.

I really wanted to like this show, but I just was never able to get into it and most of the time I was looking over to see how much time has passed, which is never a good thing. Masters of Science Fiction proved to be a ratings failure and only lasted 4 episodes with 2 never airing, but can now be seen on this DVD. Unlike Masters of Horror, the talent here isn't as well proven, but the one thing this show does get right is the casting. Each episode had some really talented actors that can take this material and make it slightly better. To be quite honest I found it to be a chore to get through the episodes and thankfully there were only 6 had their been more I doubt I would have been able to finish it. Maybe the hardcore Sci-Fi fans will enjoy this, but odds are you'll be letdown.

The DVD from Anchor Bay has an excellent audio and video quality, but very much lacks of the special features, which for me doesn't matter I suppose since I didn't like the show I wouldn't be interested in anything anyone involved had to say.

Their was a slight mistake on the insert card and DVD; on the insert card Little Brother is listed as the last episode and on disc 2 it's listed as the last, but when you put on the DVD the last episode is actually Watchbird.

A CLEAN ESCAPE- ***

Starring- Judy Davis & Sam Waterston

Screenplay- Sam Egan (short story by John Kessel

Director- Mark Rydell

This is probably the best episode of the series, which isn't saying much since at best it's average. The story is fair enough, but never fully moves forward. Still despite that I mostly liked this one and the performances from Davis and Waterston are excellent; some decent twists save this one.

THE AWAKENING- ** 

Starring- Terry O'Quinn & Elisabeth Rohm

Screenplay- Michael Petroni (short story by Howard Fast)

Director- Michael Petroni

Had potential, but mostly falls flat after a solid start. As the episode goes on it just doesn't go anywhere and gets rather boring. The concept reminded me a little bit of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, so that's the main reason I looked forward to this one. But after a decent start it just goes downhill and gets far too preachy.

JERRY WAS A MAN- **

Starring- Malcolm McDowell & Anne Heche

Screenplay- Michael Tolkin (short story by Robert A. Heinlein)

Director- Michael Tolkin

Way too silly and over the top, which was the point, but for me it was just too much. The writing was silly and I couldn't get into this one at all. The only saving grace was McDowell and Heche who were both really funny and make this one just barley watchable.

THE DISCARDED- * 

Starring- John Hurt, James Denton & Brian Dennehy

Screenplay- Harlan Ellison & Josh Olson (short story by Harlan Ellison)

Director- Jonathan Frakes

I found this terrible; I quickly lost my attention with the episode and was just passing the time before it finally ended. This one looks like a cheap made for Sci-Fi TV show. Actually that would be an insult to those Sci-Fi originals. This was the last episode to air on network TV and honestly can't say I'm surprised.

LITTLE BROTHER- ****

Starring- Clifton Collins Jr. & Kimberly Elise

Screenplay- Walter Mosley (short story by Walter Mosley)

Director- Darnell Martin

Best episode of the series; if only the rest could have been like this we'd have a winner. While nothing great, Little Brother is very entertaining and works out quite well. Honestly this is the only one really worth watching.

WATCHBIRD- ***

Starring- Sean Astin & James Cromwell

Screenplay- J. Michael Stracznski (short story by Robert Sheckley)

Director- Harold Becker

Fairly good; has its moments when it's entertaining as well as some boring moments. There was potential to be more, but never quite reaches it. Watchbird is one of the better episodes, which isn't saying much since it was average at best.",1221091200,3,4788,4.6049528301886795
3446460,3,B001A7GOCA,"I guess I'll also reflect what seems to be the majority opinion here - that the show had good episodes and bad.  The good ones are absolutely riveting, but the bad ones just make you want them to be over ASAP (Jerry was a Man, particularly, drove me crazy).  Many of the episodes tried to make political points, which is a perfectly valid thing for - and is often done very well within - the sci-fi genre.  This show had several like that - episodes that actually draw you in to a different world and subtly get you to think about your own world.  However, it also had the episodes, like ""Jerry"", which hit you over the head repeatedly with a message until you feel like you're about to be bludgeoned to death.  Thankfully, the ratio of good to bad (as I see it) was about four to two.

But after viewing them, they're not that bad, it's a shame that the network didn't give the show a better slot or any kind of promotion (I didn't even know the show was on the air).  Smart television is what's missing from the airwaves.  I wish there were more shows like this one instead of the same old lousy sit-coms (British retreads or badly written ones) and cheap-to-produce reality programing. If you want to watch some interesting sci-fi drama then look no further.  I strongly recommend this DVD set.

First of all, I found some very well know people starring in this such as, Brian Dennehy, Anne Heche, Sean Astin and others, that was good and added a lot to the viewing.
As I watched each espisode I found I certainly enjoyed them.  They dealt with war, humanity, and even the Angelic, which was definitely my favorite. These stories have a flare like those of The Twilight Zone, or Outer Limits, but with more of a 'this could happen,' feeling as you watched them. That did add to the weird feeling that filled the room, which I believe is suppose to be part of the experience, right? In conclusion let me say this.  I  did enjoy some of the stories and I believe for someone who likes off the beat tales they will love this series. A good addition to your DVD's if you are a Sci-Fi fan.",1220918400,,1150,4.252293577981652
3446463,3,B001A7GOCA,"Masters of Science Fiction was a series produced for ABC that sought to capture some of the magic of The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits.  Of the six one-hour episodes made (under 45 minutes without the ads), all included here, only four were shown.  The series was arguably not given a chance, as it was aired on Saturday nights in August, not a great time slot.

Some of the concepts are interesting and promising, and there are some top-notch actors, but I still didn't enjoy these much.  On the whole the writing is superficial, the logic weak, and the atmospherics that might make up for that are only so-so.  I only enjoyed one of the six episodes enough to say I liked it.

The first episode has a nice basic idea to work with, revealed bit by bit in a way that makes much description of the plot too much of a spoiler.  Judy Davis plays a psychotherapist who has a patient (Sam Waterston) with a condition she is very anxious to cure, for reasons that are only made clear later.  Sadly, some of it doesn't quite add up or is only tenuously credible, and the exposition is clumsy.  I thought Waterston seemed oddly hammy and fake, though maybe he thought that suited the character.  Davis has a compelling screen presence.

The second episode takes place in the very near future.  Alien creatures appear on earth and (without giving too much away) do stuff that it seems they should have done long before.  The way this happens is fairly arbitrary.  I liked Terry O'Quinn in this episode, in a measured performance that brought some subtlety of character at least.

Both the first two episodes, and most of the others too, fail to be very subtle about the rather simplistic principles we're supposed to draw from them.

The episode I enjoyed is the third one, ""Jerry Was a Man,"" based on a short story by Robert Heinlein.  Part of the enjoyment was sheer comic relief from the first two episodes, both rather Serious and a bit preachy.  This is the only one of the six that's primarily comedic, though serious ideas are dealt with.  Jerry is a genetically engineered android who was originally designed to sweep minefields (in about the least efficient way possible), but who has been working as a janitor lately and is about to be turned into puppy chow.  A very wealthy woman (Anne Heche) takes a fancy to him and undertakes to save him, eventually by trying to prove he's a human.  The intriguing tag line that is spoken by Stephen Hawking at the end is, ""What makes us human may one day be defined not by the gifts we possess but by the virtues we lack.""  Malcolm McDowell is particularly good as the genetic engineer.

Series host Stephen Hawking, by the way, has very little to do in this series.  He says a line at the beginning and end of each piece.  The lines generally don't quite work like Rod Serling's comments for The Twilight Zone.  I doubt very much that Hawking wrote them.

Episode 4 concerns a group of people rejected from Earth because of various unpleasant mutations and sent to wander the solar system in search of a home.  They're approached by a representative from Earth with a deal to take them back.  The drama is fairly thin and the results are highly predictable.  John Hurt and Brian Dennehy are fine, and the make-up artists had a great time with the mutations, including a fairly well done second, smaller head on John Hurt.  There are a couple surprisingly if still only mildly brutal touches in that episode.

The fifth episode is similar in several ways to Robocop, but with small eagle-like flying ""Watchbirds"" as the peacekeeping machines, and a kind of wireless human-machine interface instead of flesh and machine joined directly.  The machines start off well and then problems come up as they're tied up in politics.  It lacks Robcop's high-powered action and is only briefly and mildly violent.  It also lacks the clever, polished script.  The acting is fairly good.  This one is the second best of the group for me.

The final episode has elements of 1984, done in a pale Terry Gilliam (Brazil) style.  An underground worker escapes, is accused of murder, and fights with his mind against a partly human machine that constitutes his judge, defense counsel, and jury.  The things that cause trouble for the machine are so elementary as to lack much credibility or interest, and the ending is sheer Hollywood.

The production values for the series are on the high side of what would be expected for a TV series.  With all of the episodes, there are some interesting or enjoyable points.  I can see why some people enjoyed them.  But viewers inclined to be picky or critical about their science fiction should probably look elsewhere.",1220572800,33,4685,4.660975609756098
3446464,4,B001A7GOCA,"Even with a good cast, good stories, and decent production values, TV science fiction anthologies aimed at adult audiences are probably a thing of the past. Masters of Science Fiction follows in the tradition of The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, and Amazing Stories and may well be the last time we see anything of the sort on network television.

I saw the series when ABC aired it, and I did not mind re-watching the four episodes that were actually broadcast before ABC pulled the plug. As others have noted here, this set of stories probably leans a little too heavily toward the ""thought-provoking social relevance"" end of the sci-fi anthology spectrum. The earlier series all dabbled in this as well, but they also had a lot of stories that were just weird, amusing, or creepy without the burden of a message of some sort.

If you collect DVD's of science fiction anthologies, you definitely want to add this set to your collection; more casual fans of the genre will want to see, but not necessarily own, Masters of Science Fiction.",1220572800,,1042,4.751381215469613

in movies and TV. The closest to a positive ending was in ""Little Brother""

In other words, it was good TV and good science fiction.  It reminded me of the the intent (but thankfully not the hoaky presentation and stories!) of the 80s show ""Amazing Stories"" and the sci-fi elements of Star Trek The Next Generation.

Viewers will enjoy seeing some of their favorite actors here - Terry O'Quinn (currently in ""Lost""), John Hurt, James Denton (""Desperate Housewives""), Brian Dennehy, Anne Heche, James Cromwell, Malcolm McDowell, Sean Astin (""Lord of the Rings"") and others highlight the cast of the various episodes.

""Masters"" didn't really fail because ABC made sure from the very beginning that it would never make it in the first place. ABC entertainment president Stephen McPherson put the series on hold for a year (thus dating some of the material) and aired it on Saturday nights at 10 p.m. in August.  As a Reuters reviewer put it, this is what you call ""burying a show deep within the bowels of television Siberia.""  A network doesn't do this to a show it wants to promote or have on the air.  It was used as temporary filler, nothing more.  It's clear that ABC's McPherson wanted this show to die and die quick.  It appeared it couldn't be fast enough as only four of the six episodes ever aired.

""Masters"" is definitely political at times, but that's part of what makes it good - and at times bad when it makes a point too bluntly.  It's probably one of the reasons it was killed by its own network.  It might rest in obscurity now, but it's possible that it will become part of the historical record that will show how some of the real world of the Bush era leaked into entertainment and what it attempted to reflect back to us.",1220400000,5,2026,4.6892655367231635
3446467,3,B001A7GOCA,"Sci-fi short stories from prominent authors, quality actors like John Hurt, high production values.  How could they possibly go wrong?

The short answer is that they were so concerned with making high-minded art that they forgot to make it fun.  They decided not to have action because action is low-brow.  They decided to use slow pacing because a fast pace is low-brow.  They decided to down-play tension because too much tension is low-brow.  They try bits of humor, but they come across as forced.  Sci fi television can have action, and still be high-minded.  It can be fast paced, and still be high-minded.  It can be tense, and still be high-minded.  It can have humor, and still be high-minded.  Great Sci Fi shows can be high-minded, and still be fun.  Shows like The Prisoner and the new Battlestar Galactica are high-minded and fun.  Masters of Sci Fi has a great deal going for it, but its fundamental flaw is that it just isn't fun.

The obvious points of reference for this series are, of course, The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits..  When each episode is a complete stand-alone story, it is not possible to develop a nuanced character, so everybody is little more than a cypher.  It is also impossible to have an elaborate story, so the plots are relatively simple.  Episodes are short stories, and the best short stories (like those of Philip K. Dick) present one interesting idea that is just too small to sustain a full novel.  The trick is to get to the point, and end it before driving it into the ground.  The ideas in these episodes are relatively common.  There is an episode combining a Kafkaesque trial with computers taking over the world, a trial about when an artificial intelligence becomes human, an episode about a rejected minority of mutants, etc.  In other words, there isn't much here that we haven't seen before.  Of course, one could argue that all plots are derivative at this point, but it is always possible to put a new twist on an old idea, and there aren't even any particularly different twists here.

The more important problem, though, is that the episodes generally take too long to get to the point.  They have one interesting tidbit that doesn't come until the end of the episode, and nothing leading up to it is sufficiently dramatic, tense, funny, action-packed, etc. to sustain you until you get to that tidbit.  Then, of course, if you know the tidbit, there is no point watching, so I can't see rewatching the episodes.  In that sense, they are sort of like M Night Shamalamawhatshisname movies.  However, Shamalambadatheforbiddendance at least tries to keep a level of tension until you get to the relatively easy to predict twist.  This series doesn't bother with tension.  I will provide an example in the next paragraph.  I won't be ruining any great surprises, but if you want to watch this series without knowing anything in advance, don't read the next paragraph

In one episode, a pair of incredibly rich and incredibly annoying twits decide to try to save a semi-sentient android-cyborg-type-thing named ""Jerry"" from being destroyed, and the trial rests on whether or not Jerry has rights.  The episode only breaks from sci fi cliches when the court finds Jerry to be human when they realize that he is capable of lying and cheating.  The lesson, then, is that our faults make us human.  OK, so it isn't entirely new, but it is a bit different and interesting.  The problem is that the only interesting, different thing in the episode comes in a three minute segment at the end of the episode (the fact that Jerry likes candy and cigarettes hints at vice, but that is not enough to sustain an episode).  Everything else is just about watching two annoying people going through cliches.  Yes, they had to make us hate the rich couple in order to drive that point home, but they could have done that with only half as much of their annoying banter.",1220400000,,3913,4.718289085545723
3446468,3,B001A7GOCA,"Most of the filmed science fiction stories in this collection from the short lived ""Masters of Science Fiction"" series are intriguing enough to be worth watching.  If that sounds like faint praise, it is.  There is nothing here that is a ""must see"" and nothing that I would strongly recommend -- but if you like science fiction, and especially science fiction that wears its political and philosophical message on its sleeve, you could do a lot worse.

There are six episodes here, two more than when this aired on television.  Most tell stories about the future, and warn of the dangers and ambiguities of technological development.  All are built around a message, and can be a bit heavy-handed about its delivery, but the stories are entertaining enough (and short enough) that that doesn't detract too much from the appeal.  The production values are fairly strong -- but the special effects and set pieces don't always work together to create a believable world.  Many of the worlds presented in the series seemed neat but not really ""lived in.""

There are a few standouts here, that really did work well, and whose aesthetics matched perfectly with the story and the message: ""The Discarded,"" was probably the best, presenting the plight of mutated misfits exiled from Earth on an aging and ill-equipped vessel, with a standout performance by John Hurt as a disappointed idealist with an extra head on his shoulders; Michael Tolkin directed the amusing and intriguing ""Jerry Was a Man,"" that worked because of the satirical social comedy that played as the backdrop of the more explicitly science fiction message.

There is lots to like about this series -- the films mostly look good, the acting is strong and they hired great people who performed their roles as well as they could be.  I think what killed it for me a bit was that they designed it to be too similar to the science fiction of an era when to play fantasy on television you needed to deliver a message, there needed to be a moral of the story -- otherwise it wasn't ""serious"" fiction, it was a mere diversion.  The kind of science fiction I read and the kinds of science fiction films I enjoy have moved beyond that to where they don't need to apologize for being ""unreal"" and focus on telling compelling stories whose messages can't be summed up by a robotic voice (Stephen Hawking narrates) over the credits.",1220313600,,2382,4.771289537712895

I grew up with anthology shows like the Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Ray Bradbury Theater, etc. I only recommend this to those die hard fans of those anthology type shows and if they like the many famous actors in these 6 episodes. If the price is cheap like when I got it get it. It's worth the entertainment for a few hours. Note: It says Stephen Hawking hosted. Don't expect to see him like you saw Rod Serling in the original Twilight Zone and Forrest Whittaker in the second remake of the Twilight Zone in 2002. You only hear his computer voice.
