1851468,1,B00008MOUP,"This movie has a G rating, but I'm not sure why. Possibly because of the year 1963; however if you are watching this with a teenage student I caution you to preview privately before watching with your teen student. In my opinion this movie deserves an R rating due to the partial nudity in 2 scenes that we watched within  the first 30 minutes.

1851537,4,B00008MOUP,"Methinks this classic strains a bit so many years on. As a sword and sandal epic it is grand and lavish but the acting, by both Taylor and Burton, is often melodramatic/ overwrought. What I found most interesting in the movies portrayal was how Cleopatra was a very masculine figure in the sense of how she approached decisions, and how the men still tried to squelch this aspect of her personality/ fortitude, and just wanted to see her as their feminine conduit. I wonder how our current climate, with so many who want to wash away the terminology and ideology of masculinity and femininity, would approach or view this? I also wonder if thats what the original filmmakers/ writers were trying to depict?",1504137600,,706,4.747967479674797

1851565,3,B00008MOUP,"Review of Cleopatra
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

Cleopatra is famous for many reasons, but its not generally well-liked. Obviously, casting Elizabeth Taylor to play one of the worlds most beautiful women, and cladding her in unspeakably beautiful costumes, is one reason this movie has been remembered. Liz was married at the time to Eddie Fisher, a union that cost her her reputation, but that couldn't stop the sparks from flying between her and her married costar, Richard Burton. Once again, Liz became a homewrecker, and her love affair and marriage to Burton is one of the most famous of all Hollywood couples.

Also, Cleopatra was the most expensive film ever made at the time. It cost $44 million, and almost bankrupted the studio. Can you imagine a world without 20th Century Fox? Audiences at the time felt it was too long and too wordy, but modern audiences won't feel that way. Were used to long epics, like Gladiator and Alexander, so the four-hour running time won't be a hindrance. And watching Liz and Dick fall in love on camera is magical; boring just isn't an applicable adjective.

I wouldnt call Cleopatra a must-see, unless you're particularly attached to that Hollywood couple, but it is a spectacle. If you like epics, or if you like your films to have glorious splendor, you're not going to want to miss this one.",1500422400,,1340,4.792207792207792
1851566,5,B00008MOUP,"LOVE this movie. And finally had to purchase it because it is not offered as prime enough. The scenery dazzles. And oh the stars who went onto other movies and Tv, Martin Landau, so many even Carroll O'Connor! And not cgi either. You drool at the costumes and wonder how did they not chafe?  Were the mosquito bitten? But the story and the acting are well done. I miss movies like this.",1500422400,,386,4.361111111111111

1851638,5,B00008MOUP,"One of the best film examples of eye & ear candy ever.  Wonderful, depth of field sets highlighted with the beautiful musical score of Alex North.  Part blockbuster ... part Shakespearian play.  The interaction of the stars is spellbinding, especially between Taylor & Burton.  Much to look for, like the pairing of hero & loyal follower; Caesar & Flavius, Cleopatra & Sosigenes, Mark Antony & Rufio, Octavian &  Agrippa.  War & romance, drama & humor ... a history lesson was never so enjoyable.

Full of powerful dialog ...
Octavian:  ""Is that how one says it? As simply as that. 'Mark Antony is dead. Lord Antony is dead.'  'The soup is hot; the soup is cold.'  'Antony is living; Antony is dead.'  'Shake with terror when such words pass your lips, for fear they be untrue and Antony'd cut out your tongue for the lie!  And if true, for your lifetime boast that you were honored to speak his name even in death. The dying of such a man, must be shouted, screamed! It must echo back from the corners of the universe. ""Antony is dead! Mark Antony of Rome lives no more!""
 ... & witty humor ...
 Julius Caesar: ""Two hours until dawn. We will hold where we are.""
Agrippa: ""And what happens at dawn?""
Julius Caesar: ""I thought you knew. The sun comes up.""

Bought this for a friend who doesn't have Blu-ray.  The day the Blu-ray copy came available was the day I bought a Blu-ray player.
Perhaps the best thing I can say about this film is my initial experience.  Went to a theater to see it in '63 ... when the filmed ended I was so stunned  that I never left my seat.  For the first & only time ever, I sat through the second showing of a film.  The movie is 4+ hours long so I stayed glued to my seat for over 8 hours ...

1851677,3,B00008MOUP,"I'm a fan of Roman history, and while Elizabeth Taylor's performance was spectacular, and the processions and parades where impressive, I expected more from a 4 hour movie.

1. Romans guided their armies with TRUMPETS (cornicens), not drums. The sound of a trumpet can be heard during a loud battle, the sound of drums cannot.

2. While boats did have drummers that beat them to set the pace, the drummer would be BELOW DECK, with the slaves rowing the ship. Not above deck.

3. While Octavian was a sickly child and a bit of a wimp, he was not the loser portrayed in this movie. Octavian did two things that endeared him to the troops. 1. He honor the will of Caesar by going into debt to pay his soldiers. 2. He led from the front at times, including a brave charge. 3. He and his childhood best friends composed arousing speeches. Octavian did not sleep during battles, and he would not have been in a cot during the naval battle of Actium.

4. Marc Anthony married Octavia for political reasons BEFORE meeting Cleopatra, not afterwards. In fact, Octavian sent Octavia and his mother to Egypt after Marc Anthony was living with Cleopatra, to beg him to come back. Marc Anthony did not bother to receive them, his guard simply told them to go back to Rome. It was after this rejection plus his inflammatory will that the Senate declared war.

If they had gotten that right, I would have given this movie 5 stars.

Frankly, I think HBO's Rome tells the Cleopatra story better.",1467763200,,1477,4.554716981132075

The sets are gorgeous and realistic, giving you an idea of what Egypt and Rome looked like over two-thousand years ago. The actors do a great job making everything believable, and the historical accuracy is definitely on-point. I felt like I was learning about Egypt, Rome, and Cleopatra herself throughout the whole movie. Romance, battle, spectacle, and daily-life scenes are all well-done.

1851746,4,B00008MOUP,"Great Hollywood History. Over the top and way over budget. Glamour and great costume changes for Elizabeth Taylor. The real drama was going on behind the scenes. Taylor was the first actress in history to be paid a million dollars for one film role: Cleopatra. She made the most of it. Off the set. Between illnesses and her legendary affair with Richard Burton, while making of this incredibly epic, expensive film, nearly bankrupt 20th Century Fox.
  This film did cause a global sensation when it was released in 1963. Taylor and Burton were the notorious "" it couple "" . In Hollywood we all know bad publicity can be good, as long as the picture makes money. And it did, eventually making a profit. The adulterous, boozy, cigarette- filled affair was on magazine covers around the world. With pictures, in color. This only helped the box office appeal for the actual movie.
  The movie itself is mostly long and mediocre. However it is worth watching. The cinematography is a feast for the eyes.  There are some memorable moments between Taylor and Burton, we can see real passion that perhaps Antony and Cleopatra may have come close to in real life. Roddy McDowell really shines as Octavian the villain in the second half. He deserved an Oscar for best supporting actor in this role. He should have had it.
  I was moved by Taylor's very last scene. Her spoken words were indeed sad. As Cleopatra, her last comments were touching and tragic as she summarized the end of her short life. Elizabeth Taylor was still truly a beautiful woman in this film. Even though the double chin had already started, in her early thirties, she was still simply stunning to look at. And she did STAR in this film. The girl could really act. With all the costume changes and other distractions, this simply was not her best work. The film itself is indeed art; this was a historical event in every sense, at every level.
  Worth watching if you have the time. I enjoyed viewing the entire film, twice, since 1963.",1457481600,,2000,4.6752136752136755

1851775,5,B00008MOUP,"1963 version of Cleopatra with Elizabeth Taylor is a great film, I say this disclosing myself both as an Elizabeth Taylor fan, and as a history buff, or ""arm chair historian"", that I consider myself.  I have heard at least one historian, an Egyptologist say that the film is historically accurate.  The credits at the beginning of the film, cite ancient historians, i.e., many primary sources, and ancient writers who considered themselves historians, such as Plutarch, to name only one.  The production values I think remain unsurpassed, and special visual effects are all, as they say,practical, and in camera. I don't believe this film could be remade without resorting to CGI, a lot of CGI.  Elizabeth Taylor gives and intelligent and shaded performance, and under difficult circumstances, i.e., getting each scene to film the day before, or sometimes the morning of, in the stressful and somewhat panicked  production atmosphere, portrays both the young queen and later more confident somewhat older one.  Rex Harrison was Oscar nominated for this role, and  Richard Burton's performance is a little uneven, sometimes brilliant, and other times less than that.  Attention to detail is perfect, and nothing in this looks cheap.  I highly recommend this film to everyone. There are great extras including commentary tracks by Joe Mankiewcz's family, film archivists, film critics, and others.  Also there is a section re: the films ""missing footage"", i.e. that missing footage which was another 3 plus hours, which seems to have been lost forever, although the search goes on for some, similar to an archeological expedition.  Elizabeth Taylor has rarely been more beautiful, that is another reason for viewing this film, at least for me.",1449878400,,1741,5.226618705035971

1851784,4,B00008MOUP,"I love 60's movies where, as Groucho Marx [best movie is probably DUCK SOUP] put it, ""A woman is a woman, and a man is an empty overcoat."" Is the origin version of Cleopatra, which was over 222 minutes long, available anywhere on dvd?
  Rumor has is that the Elizabeth Taylor's bath scene was done by an American waitress stand-in; I used to know the waitress's name but I've since forgotten it.  If you know her name, tell me Tom Lang, tomgpotter@gmail.com!!
  Those were the good ol' days when beautiful women not only made movies, but also BABIES.  Can you even IMAGINE Christina Hendricks, Scarlett Johansson, Kat Dennings, Morena Baccarin, Lindsay Lohan, or, ironically the star of the TV series Modern ""Family"", Sophia Vergara [her best movie is Tim Allen's BIG {not a tongue-in-cheek reference to Vergara's assets} TROUBLE] actually going through the hassle of having children and contributing to the human genetic pool?  Not Hardly.  Diana Dors and Mamie Van Doren had three children each, ELIZABETH TAYLOR had two children, Elvira [Cassandra Peterson] and Cynthia Myers had one apiece, and even Marilyn Monroe at least tried.
  Permanently removing good genes from the gene pool is so sad.  Sophia Loren [her best movie is probably the musical ""MAN OF LA MANCHA""] has become some sort of [UGH!] role model; on the other hand, she's got great bumpers---on the other other hand she neglected to pass on those great ""bumper"" genes.
  If you're into 60's SPOOF movies, I heartily recommend another movie with Richard Burton in it entitled ""CANDY"".  The movie also stars Marlon Brando [Da' GODFATHER and ON THE WATERFRONT], James Coburn [The PRESIDENT'S ANALYST], John Austin [the original father ""Gomez"" in the TV Addams Family], Karl Maldon, Ringo Starr [drummer for the Beatles], and in the title role of ""Candy"", which was offered to and refused by EVERY A-list American movie actress, Miss Teenage Sweden!!  CANDY was banned by the Vatican, some wuss Scandinavian countries, some counties in England, and some southern states in the USA.  Obviously a MUST-SEE movie!

Speaking of banning books and movies as a Religious Philosophy:

1851836,5,B00008MOUP,"A truly lavish presentation, the film made during the era's of the most revered 'Epic's' such as 'Ben Hur' 'Spartacus'
'The Ten Commandments' and 'El Cid' among them.
This perhaps the most expensive of it's day due to health issues that plagued 'Elizabeth Taylor' preventing filming,
the cast still had to be paid, the sets maintained, it's cost, around $44 million, a lot of money in the early 60's, though
it did in fact gross nearly $58 million in the U.S alone.
The story telling of the internal power struggle that existed in both the 'Roman' and 'Egyptian' empires, 'Rome' led by
'Caesar' (Rex Harrison) and 'Egypt' between brother 'Achillas' (John Doucette) and sister 'Cleopatra' (Elizabeth Taylor)
'Rome' a mighty power, 'Egypt' once so, but no longer the influence it once was.
'Rome' now seemingly with administrative influence over the affairs of 'Egypt' - 'Cleopatra' wanting the support of 'Rome'
to be sole ruler of 'Egypt'
Temptress 'Cleopatra' offers herself to 'Caesar' who in turn ensures her rule..
'Caesar' spends much time in 'Egypt' but needs to return to 'Rome' though loyal General 'Mark Anthony' (Richard Burton)
has seen to it that 'Rome' remains loyal to 'Caesar's'
Eventually after fighting two wars 'Caesar' does return to 'Rome' however he's yet to return back to his love in 'Alexandria'
and his young son 'Caesarian' for three long years.
'Cleopatra' decides to visit 'Rome' itself, making a glorious and lavish entrance with her son amid adoring crowds to greet
her.
'Caesar' seeks higher recognition from the Senate, that of both 'King and Emperor' which brings much unrest within the
walls of the senate, it is planned that 'Caesar's' ally 'Mark Anthony' is distracted whilst the Senator's commit their act of
treachery.
'Cleopatra' and her son return to 'Egypt' after 'Caesar's' death, she will now turn her scheming attention toward 'Marc Anthony'
to fulfil her ambitions, after 'Mark Anthony' brings justice to those that had killed his beloved 'Caesar' he could at that time
claimed sole power but chooses to divide the power, leaving 'Octavian' (Roddy McDowell) in 'Rome'
However 'Cleopatra' will weave her spell upon 'Mark Anthony' to become more ambitious, but, does he still command all the
Legions he once did.
The alliance between the two will put them at odds with 'Rome' with War inevitable, the romance between the two leading to
their demise, that of legends.
Perhaps stretching Historical fact some, the spectacle that is 'Cleopatra' unforgettable nevertheless (of course 'Roddy Mcdowell'
went on to play the role of 'Caligula')
The 251 minute presentation is spread over two discs with all the touches of yesteryear including the 'intro' and indeed the
'intermission' faithfully in tact.
The picture and sound upgrade for this lavish 1963 presentation is quite outstanding.

1851841,4,B00008MOUP,"Cleopatra is a epic drama film stars Elizabeth Taylor in the title role. The film tells the story of the struggles of Cleopatra VII, the young Queen of Egypt, to resist the imperialist ambitions of Rome. Together with Liz Taylor,it also stars Richard Burton.

Cleopatra follows the eighteen years that led to the founding of the Roman Empire. The Queen of Egypt,Cleopatra VII, meets up with Julius Caesar and plans to lure Caesar to her boudoir in order to forge an alliance with Rome so that she may hold on to her Egyptian empire. When Caesar is stabbed to death in the Roman Senate, Cleopatra is left without an ally, and Egypt is up for grabs. When Roman general Mark Antony comes along, she seduces him in order to make him over into her new protector. But, under the charms of Cleopatra, Mark Antony is reduced from a an awesome and dominating general to a sniveling, drunken wimp. At the Battle of Actium, Mark Antony is defeated and Cleopatra withdraws her troops, dooming him and his army. With Egypt in peril, Antony and Cleopatra, the doomed lovers, meet each other for the last time, as the enemy forces close in.

Cleopatra is an display of cinema opulence as it tries to recreate a historical epic during the times of the Roman Empire. The costumes were simply awesome and the musical score was outstanding. It was definitely the most expensive movie during its time of release especially after Taylor was awarded a $1 million contract to make the movie. Unfortunately,despite the expenses for production values,the story become somewhat boring as it became talky and verbose. Also,the pacing was slow that one may lose interest in this almost 4-hour film.

Overall,Cleopatra turned into an entertainment flick from both Taylor and Burton instead of a historical epic that could have provided a landmark for cinema excellence in the future.",1432598400,,1854,4.860759493670886

Despite the difficulty making this film, it turned out to be a tremendous time capsule into ancient history while at the same time pointing out that sex, politics, and corruption  haven't changed to much in the present. On top of all this you have Elizabeth Taylor at her peak. Her beauty and seductive qualities are only overshadowed by her commanding performance in the title role. Cleopatra is Grand Spectacle and human drama played out against the glorious backdrops of  Ancient Rome and  Pre-Christian Egypt. It remains great entertainment with lessons  to be learned by the discriminating viewer. THIS is what great film making is all about. I'm giving it five stars.",1424131200,,851,5.057142857142857

This 1963, 248-minute, color, 2-disc, Special Edition, DVD set of the historical, seductive, mysterious and absolutely gorgeous, Ancient Egyptian Queen - CLEOPATRA, is appropriately portrayed by the beautiful Academy Award winning 'Best Actress' for the movie: Butterfield 8, the stunning - Elizabeth Taylor. Also staring in this magnificent Joseph L. Mankiewicz epic production, are Actors Sir Richard Burton as the tempestuous Marc Anthony, Rex Harrison as the mighty Roman General - Julius Caesar, Roddy McDowall as Octavian Caesar, along with appearances by a young Martian Landau, Pamela Brown, Andrew Keir, George Cole, Robert Stephens, Hume Cronyn, Kenneth Haigh and Caesar Danova. This film comes to it's audience in THX digitally monitored sound with spoken English and French and with subtitles, in English and Spanish. Love, lust, politics, titles, acquisition of land through war and economic control, royal intrigue and murderous betrayal between Egypt and Rome, come alive, in this fascinating and powerful, big-screen, historical, movie extravaganza. The beguiling, sensuous and extremely intelligent, Queen of the Nile - CLEOPATRA, through her love affairs with Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony respectively, both initially... united Egypt and Rome, and then, tore them apart. And, in so doing, changed the course of history. For the strength, honor and might that is Rome and the beauty, wealth and enticing seduction that is Egypt, was never more to be the same, when the defiant yet politically shrewd CLEOPATRA, was placed on the throne of Egypt. Julius Caesar made CLEOPATRA the undisputed, Queen of the Nile and then some but not before, he made her his lover and mother of his only son, Caesarian. The mighty and conquering Caesar after having securely established CLEOPATRA  as Egypt's royal and thought to be divine Ruler, goes back to Rome in triumph. Several years pass in relative peace and CLEOPATRA decides to come to Rome with Caesars' son, to pay him a visit. Then, a murderous and treasonous plot is enacted and Julius Caesar is brutally murdered. Leaving CLEOPATRA to flee for her life and that of her sons', back to Egypt. Marc Anthony goes to Egypt to maintain Roman rule for CLEOPATRA who was now, following Caesars' untimely death, only the figure-head of power and rule in the midst of political unrest. With Anthony in Egypt, Rome is ruled by Caesars' heir - Octavian, who despised CLEOPATRA. And so, the ultimate power struggle for supreme rulership of Egypt, erupts. War breaks out between Octavian and Marc Anthony who is now, CLEOPATRA's lover. If he had fought the battle on land as was his custom undoubtedly, Marc Anthony would have utterly crushed the young and inexperienced, Octavian. But, Egypt had many battleships ready and available and CLEOPATRA implored him, to utilize the Egyptian vessels against Rome. Anthony, influenced and blinded by his passionate love for CLEOPATRA, made a fateful decision. He went against his own better judgment and military experience and decided to wage war against his own homeland and former friends-in-arms, on the sea rather than on land using her ships. Octavian wins the war and rather than being dragged through Rome in chains, the tragic end for the passionate couple is to end their own lives. This stupendous motion picture production is a breathtaking presentation in it's entirety, as represented by a cast of hundreds. Historical pageantry and intensity are depicted, complete with all the pomp and circumstance that denotes royalty. In addition too, the enormous wealth and splendor that typified Ancient Egypt and the vast and mighty Roman Empire. CLEOPATRA is by far, a superb and masterful classic, film epic that is more than just a movie. It is a viewing event. A definite keeper for your Golden Age of Hollywood Cinema, DVD collection. So, pop the popcorn, relax and enjoy this enthralling historical account. Nina Kish",1412985600,,4241,5.2459499263622975

1852065,5,B00008MOUP,"Cleo's have come and gone. There have been many films and books depicting Cleo as she really was to great melodramatic Cleo. Three other popular Cleo's were the Claudette Colbert (1934), Vivien Leigh (1945), and Leonor Varela (1999). There were many more variations between those years.

The one Cleo that will always stand out and let's not forget Mark is the one staring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (1963). I was old enough to enjoy it on the big screen. Rex Harrison made a good Caesar; watch him have a similar attitude in ""The Honey Pot"" (1967).

Enough time, thought, and money have been put into this production that I am bound to overlook a few of the most important items about this film. The movie is more than just the actors are. The characters are very well portrayed. The set and costumes are dazzling. They really showed up in the scene when Cleopatra entered Rome. And the navel battle was spectacular.

The year 48 BCE, the place Egypt. The end of the great Pharos is near. The world is being usurped by Rome. We are looking at the story of a power struggle between brother and sister for the control of Egypt, and just as intriguing between two great empires and as results an unforgettable lone story. Will a great sew battle turn the tide?

1852094,4,B00008MOUP,"The thing I like most about the epic films of the 50s, 60s, and early 70s, was the authentic visual expansiveness that was there because the sets were actually created, full size, on earth somewhere. And the types of cameras and film (not digital) that were used created pictures that are three or four dimensional in quality. Simply lovely to behold. The computer generated junk they spit out today is just so cheap, flat, boring, comic, adolescent, and fake looking by contrast.

To think 20th Century Fox nearly bankrupt itself over this story. But 20th Century is even more disgusting than Octavian as they both remained alive only because of the death of someone great. Cleopatra, Mark Anthony, Cesarian and Cesar all died tragically and Octavian remained alive and benefited through them - and he did not deserve it at all. So to, 20th Century Fox profited over 20 million dollars from a life insurance policy they had taken out on Marilyn Monroe shortly before she was murdered. And 20th Century Fox should have died bankrupted by this stupid movie, but they profited unjustly by death of the greatest Actress that ever lived, Marilyn Monroe.

As I watched this film, I couldn't help but wonder how much better this film would have been if only they had employed a real actress with talent, and especially Marilyn Monroe, to play Cleopatra.  Just imagine in your mind, how riveting the scene would have been when Marilyn, I mean Cleopatra, said ""my breasts are full of love and my hips are round and wide apart. I will bear Caesar many sons""!  Wow!!! Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.

Or imagine the scene where Marilyn, Cleopatra, was lying on the sofa in a sheer gown exposing her nude body, when Caesar walked in.

Or how stunning, how epic, how breathe taking the scene would have been when Marilyn, Cleopatra, rode in on the huge stone Phynx with her son little Caesar.  With Marylin in golden hair full of gold beads and golden strings and chains, with the giant black Egyptian eye makeup.  And to top it off, with Marilyn's plethora of talent which includes physical beauty, athleticism, singing and dancing (all unavailable to Liz Taylor, sadly), Marylin could have joined in and lead the dancing in the parade, and even sung!  Talk about ""walking like an Egyptian!!!!""

20th Century really missed out by not casting Marilyn Monroe as the lead role in Cleopatra.  Just think, instead of being the record holder for biggest money losing movie ever made (a record Cleopatra still holds today), Marilyn would have turned Cleopatra into the biggest gold mine in Cinema History.  I mean, just look at the millions of dollars per year, every year every one of Marilyn's films from the 1939 thru 1962 are still earning to this day!  And most of those movies are bad scripts and bad cinematography.  But because Marilyn Monroe is in them, they sell 10s of millions of dollars each film annually.

By contrast, Liz Taylor, did continually fall short and lack in the scenes. Even though it was a very good movie.

I recommend watching it.",1403913600,,3055,4.7685009487666035

1852096,4,B00008MOUP,"I bought this movie several years ago (from Amazon) but never reviewed it for Amazon.  Being a Romanofile and knowing a great
deal about Roman and Greek history even when this was first released in the early 1960s I was anxious to see this.  I am very
critical watcher of most movies (and the telly) and especially in so called historical dramas.  This is a first class movie of entertainment
and fun though rather long in the original theatrical version.  Liz is gorgeous, Burton is same old self (always the Shakespearian actor)
and Rex Harrison  as the slick, political genius Julius Caesar,as great.  Some of the historical truths were removed from the film
for dramatic reasons and politically correct purposes (yes, even in the 1960's) but I still give a strong thumbs up recommendation for
the film. though it does have some issues.  As a kind of stickler for historical truth, I did not like certain changes, such as the director
having Caesar demanding to be named ""Emperor"".. that never happened.  Historians really don't know what Caesar had in mind
for political reform of the Republic: possibly a kind of constitutional monarchy.  Perhaps he had no answer; instead he was
preparing to invade Persia.  Perhaps it is well when he died, but what would history been like if he lived?  Certainly no second
civil war that decimated the Roman Youth.  By the way, there is no word in Latin for Emperor; the word we translate loosely
was IMPERATOR which was more of an honorary title given to successful generals in the field.  It was like giving Eisenhower
a fifth star after World War 2 was over.  The rank was more honorary than permanent.  And the title is an old title going back to
the early days of the Roman Republic.
  Now about the real star of the Movie.  Liz Taylor was a beautiful woman (watch her in LIFE WITH FATHER) and looked splendid
in the Cleo outfits.  It was a good choice for I guess in real life she was conniving; certainly had enough hubbies.  Anyhow she
played the role well, though I thought the 20 century English was a bit out of place.  Should have spoken more ""British"".  And
Richard Burton played the womanizing, drunk, self centered Marcus Antonius very well..like in real life.  But he was the best hubby
for Liz. and I think we all really miss him.  He was great in 1984, in 1984, his last movie I believe and I think his best performance.
  I been told that a number of battle scenes were filmed but they were so lame, that the studio cut them out.  They really could have
used CGI!!  And the original set of Cleos palace in London got caught in rain and partially melted; so much for limey weather.
They moved the set to Italy.  I understand that Liz got very ill.  The extended version of the DVD I think has all this good stuff in
the extra programs.  In the extended version they show Caesar and Cleo visiting Alex the Greats coffin.  Historians today wonder
what happened to it; it would be great historical find; it is believed to have existed.  The light house at Pharos, 450 feet high some
say, exists (in ruins) at the bottom of the bay.
  All said, and dispite my personal critical appraisal and gripes, I think this is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie for those who
like Liz and Richard and sword and sandal quasi history then I strongly recommend it.  I got mine from Amazon.  And no Dr Sweets!!!!",1402790400,,3357,4.562814070351759

Like Charlton Heston and Ben-Hur, serious film fans are supposed to hate Joseph Mankiewicz's Cleopatra but I've never understood what is so repulsive about it. I've seen it twice and each time I was wowed, amazed and entertained. Am I crazy? Am I a moron? Am I a bad judge of art? I'll admit, it has its flaws. Four hours can try some people's patience and the script is a little disjointed at times:

1. Apollodorus suddenly declaring his long-harbored love for Cleopatra when no hints have been dropped or foreshadowed throughout the film.
2. Lotus the cupbearer's poisoning scheme is a little vague. I had to rewind it about three times to get how she did it.

But overall it's an absorbing film with fine acting, a complex and entertaining plot and dialogue so dramatic, lyrical, poetic, beautiful and as sweet as honey on the tongue.

The costumes, sets, photography and visual effects deserved their Oscars 100%. Elizabeth Taylor's wardrobe is beyond description. I could never get tired of gazing at the gorgeous detailed palace interiors--Cleopatra's throne room, bath, barge and bedroom and Caesar's palace. Leon Shamroy's cinematography contains light, soft, pastel colors like watercolor paintings. My favorite shots are:

1. Cleopatra's barge on sea.
2. The desert scenes
3. The scene where Cleopatra sees Caesar for the last time in Rome.
4. The end of the first half where she's packing up to go back to Egypt and bids Antony farewell.

The dissolve effects with the shots that `freeze' into frescoes, change over and over and then `unfreeze' are terrific and those quadruple shots of Cleopatra the High Priestess, flames and the senate in the `Ides of March' scene was absolutely breathtaking and intense. I'm not sure if I'd throw the shiny little gold man on the plaque to Cleopatra over the bird attacks in The Birds but I can understand why it won.

Alex North's score is very light and crisp. He blends Middle-Eastern elements (A wide variety of exotic percussion instruments) with trumpet fanfares to portray the clash of Egyptian and Roman cultures. I love the use of harpsichord cadenzas and trills in the credits music and his string parts are absolutely beautiful. Plus, he manages not to repeat the main theme over and over to the point of obnoxiousness--a very difficult feat for scoring a four hour movie.

I would personally not have nominated or awarded any of the actors in Cleopatra but to be frank, they all fit their roles perfectly like gloves.

I had always felt Elizabeth Taylor was 70% clothing/jewelry model and 30% actress but in this movie she really gives a great performance--although the screenwriting has to shoulder on some of the credit since it gave her a more complex, multi-layered, four-dimensional role. Her acting is so natural, un-self-conscious and nuanced and I thought more highly of her than I ever had before.  She pulls off Cleopatra's good and bad side and shades of black, grey and white effortlessly. There is never a false note in her portrayal of the queen of Egypt who slowly lets her lust for power become her demise. My favorite of her scenes are:

1.  When she tears up her room after discovering how Mark Antony broke his promise to marry her and married Octavia instead. Not when she starts whacking everything around with a knife--just THOSE FEW SECONDS before it happens, as she's shaking all over trying to take it off the coat rack. From that look on her face as she heads for the bed, if I were Antony there is NO WAY I would want to be there at that moment!
2. The soft, ethereal sound of her voice when she tells Caesar. ""A woman that cannot bear children is like a river that is dry. She must make the barren land fruitful just as the mother Nile feeds and replenishes the earth. I am the Nile. I will bear many sons. Isis has told me."" Pulls her face to his and looks like she's trying to hypnotize him. ""My breasts are filled with love and life. My hips are round and well apart. Such women, they say bear children unto their husbands.""
3. Trying to comfort Caesar after an epileptic fit and you realize she is not always the power hungry seductress, she sometimes seems.
4. The remorseful way she admits how she persuaded Antony to divorce Octavia. ""It's true. I did instigate it. The responsibility is mine.""
5. ""I do NOT grant PRIVATE AUDIENCES to UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS!""
6. The profound, resonant, absolutely heart rending way she gives her final speech. ""And now I will begin a dream of my own which will never end. Oh Antony...wait.""

Rex Harrison is a strong, warm, commanding presence as Caesar and delivers his lines with crisp speed and wit. Richard Burton chews a little scenery here and there but it really works well for this particular role because Mark Antony is supposed to be sappy, annoying and pathetic.

The three leads are supported by an array of terrific character actors who lend some nice color to the film. Martin Landau (who looks a LOT like Spock in Star Trek) is Rufio, the level-headed Roman centurion who enjoys his patronage to Caesar but eventually has to carry the stubborn, dense-headed Antony like a ten pound weight. Pamela Brown's melodramatic spell recitations as the High Priestess of Isis. Richard O'Sullivan's hilariously whiny and brainless Pharaoh Ptolemy. Roddy McDowall's effeminate but shrewd conqueror Octavian with a voice that can peel paint. Cesare Danova's strong, warm, endearing Apollodorus, Cleopatra's housekeeper who secretly harbors a platonic love for her but would never dare act on it.

Joseph Manckiewicz's director is fine, simple and unfussy and gives the actors plenty of reign to show off their abilities.

The only real quibble I have with this film is the entrance into Rome and drunken banquet on the boat with a gazillion skimpy dancers. That was silly, over the top and went on too long.

I certainly don't think Cleopatra is anything really groundbreaking or innovative like say Citizen Kane but it's still a very fine piece of entertainment and deserves more credit than it gets.",1400544000,,6337,4.893656716417911

 CLEOPATRA (UK/USA-1963) was a legendary ""flop"" that won 4 Oscars, ran to full houses for months and eventually earned back its enormous cost. A bloated $44 million budget is still one of the highest ever (in 2011 dollars ""Cleo"" cost $300 million!).

In recent years the film has gained in popularity (see its IMDb rating). Although the story is often historically inaccurate and moves slowly in spots, this one's also consistently lavish, glamorous, bigger than life and everything a Hollywood epic used to be but is no more. If you like sprawling romantic costume dramas, you're sure to enjoy CLEOPATRA!  (Highly recommended.)

We see here the initial sparks between Burton and Taylor that led to Liz's divorce from crooner Eddie Fisher (the poor guy was on the set watching as his wife strayed), and to a pair of tumultous Liz and Dck marriages. For all her glitter and allure, Rex Harrison commands the screen when he's up against the formidable Taylor.

Supporting cast includes Hume Cronyn, Martin Landau and Roddy McDowall.

1852189,4,B00008MOUP,"What more can be said about a film which has attracted - and continues to attract - so much notoriety since its release half a century ago? Every aspect of its gestation, release, and subsequent reputation has been pored over by critics, biographers, fans and - more recently - bloggers alike. Sitting through Joseph L. Mankiewicz's three-hour epic once more, one is struck by its sheer scale; in the days before CGI, every detail of ancient Rome had to be painstakingly recreated, from the sets to the crowds thronging the piazzas of Rome and Egypt. The visual effect of what was created at Rome's Cinecitta studios is truly breathtaking - a triumph of design and staging. The film is less effective in terms of characterization: Rex Harrison offers us another take on his light comedy persona as Mark Antony, Richard Burton provides plenty of Welsh hwyl, while reminding us of his unique vocal qualities, while Roddy MacDowall is an effeminately evil Octavian (a performance that must have provided a template for Joaquin Phoenix's rendering of a similar role in Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR (2000)). For character actor fans, there's the pleasure of identifying other performers (Martin Landau, Robert Stephens, Pamela Brown) in small roles, but that experience does not really compensate for a narrative that sags badly in places. And what of Elizabeth Taylor? She doesn't so much give a performance as dominate the screen - in a wonderful array of costumes and make-up, she truly seems like someone whose face could have launched a thousand ships. Technically speaking, she might have given better performances but her Cleopatra is comprised of one hundred per cent star quality.",1387929600,,1680,5.090579710144928

1852211,5,B00008MOUP,"My 7 year-old wanted to be Cleopatra for Halloween, she hadn't heard of her before but she liked the costume so it was a good introduction as to why all this time later this historic woman still ranks notoriety among Disney princesses.  This was a good book to highlight the bigger events in Cleopatra's life and cover the confusing transitions of power.  I liked that it included a map, though extremely basic, to help anchor the fact that these events took place at a real place and time.  I especially liked that the book made it a point that Cleopatra was intelligent and held her own, something that I really want to reinforce with my daughter.  It also led to an interesting conversation about how important voting rights are (due to the bit about the assassination of Caesar) and the various reasons why people commit suicide (Antony, Cleopatra and two servants) and how ruthless people can be when they want power (the killing of Cleopatra's eldest son).  The book doesn't glamorize any of this, just states it as close to fact and the pictures do not depict anything graphic.  For a younger child it might be a bit harder to explain the last half of the book that cover those events.  The illustrations are beautiful and my daughter wants me to do her hair like the artist designed rather than the generally accepted straight black hair.  She also wants to read the book more than once so she must have found it interesting.",1381017600,,1433,4.636363636363637

Elizabeth Taylor is at her spoiled best in this movie and Richard Burton plays an unusual weakminded, obsessed man turned traitor I've never seen in him.

1852214,3,B00008MOUP,"I ask this question right up front because I want Fox to know that WE know there is more to this story than what they gave us. It should be a three-disc set and I know I would pay good money to have the original screening. The acting is so marvelous. It must be other legal thing that keeps them from totally restoring it like they have done with so many of the oldies. This is the BEST one every made. I bought a book by Manger the producer of the movie who said it was the best film ever made and I believe it. I know that Liz vomited when she saw it and Burton never did. They all nearly died making it, Liz lost her marriage as did Burton and so why wasn't it given it's full regard by Fox? I think it was mishandled by the new Pres of Fox who took over for Spyros when they outed him just before it was done. Anyway, the heartaches continue regarding this epic film. I recommend it for the acting, costumes and scenery alone. The story is sad. A woman wants to rule the world with her lover. It is tyranny beyond belief. It goes on today in many countries around the world. Domination, greed and power hungry people want to have it all and she was no exception. Spoiled, beautiful with power over men that should have frighted them to death. There is really nothing good to say about the character of this maniac woman in 30 BC. She was the most treacherous female ever to hit the planet in my opinion. I do not regard her as anyone I want to admire. I don't ever like Liz Taylor for her behavior but the acting is perfection and I like good acting. That's it for this one. See it if you haven't.",1379894400,,1601,4.101910828025478

Rex Harrison was an Englishman pretending to be Julius Caesar.  Elizabeth Taylor was just sort of walking through a poorly written role at that point. But then upon Cleopatra's arrival in Rome everything changed. Hollywood completely outdid itself in the splendor & pomp of the procession that concluded with her appearance. It may well be the most impressive scene of its kind in movie-making. I was very deeply moved even though I wondered how it compared with the real thing. And then there was the Ides of March & all that went with it. next we were pluged into Antony & Cleopatra's tumultuous relationship (shades of ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolfe?"" & all the off-screen shenanigans of the Burton-Taylor romance).

1852259,5,B00008MOUP,"I'll not spend any time here recounting either the well-known story, the troubled production nor the gossip surrounding this particular movie.
Those things are well documented elsewhere, .....and if you are at all interested in movies you will no doubt have seen this ""Cleopatra"" several times already.
You probably even own a copy on DVD.
So, why should you buy this Bluray edition?
Well, for a start the work that has been done on this movie has produced a print SO LUSH and clear as to constitute a virtual new work.
I have seen this movie many times, but I was totally amazed at just how good it looks now.
Fresh as, ...no, far fresher than it ever was when first released, ...and restored to a far greater length than the theatrical release too.

There are whole extended scenes you may not have seen before, and while their inclusion is a very welcome treat, they are often preceeded by momentary black screen, ....which is a little at odds with the editing of the rest.
However, this small point aside Cleopatra NEVER looked better. You can clealy see the incredible detail and care that went into the lavish costumes and set dressings. These are so amazingly and authentically constructed that one wonders just where they all ended up after the shoot.

The movie comes on TWO discs, ....each with extras at the end.
Disc One has the original theatrical ""overture"" music, ...and there's also the Interval music and the ""Walkout"" music on Disc Two.

Quite a few extras, ..including a two hour doco on the ""making of"" that's way above those pathetic offerings that are little more than extended ads you see now.
This one will astound you with the difficulties experienced during production, the money wasted, some nasty corrupt people mis-appropriating funds in Italy, and the troubled and seemingly fragile health of Ms. Taylor.
Did you know all those lavish sets were built in England (of all places!), but the constant inclement weather(surprise, surprise?)proved to be such an obstacle that the whole very expensive construction was pulled down and just junked, and the production shifted to the sunnier climes of Rome?

Forget Theda Bara's b&w campy-vamping, ....and Claudette Colbert's managing to die sitting bolt upright on her throne, ...even the weird ""little-girl-woman"" performance of Vivien Leigh in George Bernard Shaw's production that can't make up its mind as to what genre it wants to be seen as.
Elizabeth Taylor looks gorgeous and certainly brings strength to the role.

Now whether you think this is a great movie or a bad one, I assure you that you will never see a better looking one.
Sure it's probably FAR more lavish than Ptolemaic Egypt ever was in reality, ....but this is epic on a grand scale, and a story that's still being told over 2100
years later.

But when Twentieth Century Fox released their version in 1963, after over 3 years of production - they truly made a masterpiece,
not only in casting Elizabeth Taylor, but Rex Harrison and Richard Burton as well.  With a great director, Joseph Mankiewicz at the helm, this film(over 3 hours long) was the closest to the real story of Cleopatra and her life.

Taylor is the ""only"" actress to really get, ""Cleopatra"" as she really was.  When I think of this film, I see her face above all the other versions of this ""Nile"" princess!!!  Harrison as Caesar and Burton, as Marc Anthony, added to the beauty and greatness of these characters - as doors to the passing of history of it's time.  Rent or buy, thru Amazon.

1852308,5,B00008MOUP,"What else need be said? One of the truly great epics. I saw the three-hour version in the theater as a kid, an thought it was long and boring. Later I heard about the controversy surrounding the actors, and being a kid I didn't care. When I was older I began to appreciate the film for itself. Older still and I began to appreciate the historicity. It's actually pretty accurate, with a couple of exceptions. This time around I realized that the ""Admiral Agrippa"" character is semi-fictitious, in that his appearance as Caesar's aide is totally ahistorical. The real Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was a friend of Octavius, and the same age, so when Caeser went down to Egypt he was at most 14, possibly as young as 12.

But that's quibbling on my part. Overall Cleopatra tells the story and tells it very well. Watching this version led me to read up on the story of the making of the movie, and it's cutting-down from five to four to three hours. This is the first time I've seen the four-hour version, and it's been so long since last time that I would have to watch them side-by-side to find out what I missed before.

Well, it's an epic, alright! It is quite simply the most gorgeous looking spectacular epic I have ever seen. And I love Lord of the Rings. LOTR of course are better movies, but for sheer spectacle of 1960s film making, Cleopatra is 'da bomb'.

Probably, you've read about its troubled shoot, the Taylor/Burton scandal,the fights between directors and studios, et al. All very interesting, but what is the film actually like?

Well, kind of boring. Boring but so fabulous to look at. The costumes are amazing. The sets are amazing. And HUGE. Cleopatra's visit to Rome is like some Broadway drag queen's wet dream in its over-the-top-campery. This film is worth owning, just for the visuals alone. The transfer to blu ray makes it look beautiful.

Taylor is very good as Cleo, and Burton hams only a little bit, though that is arguable. Roddy McDowell waits for most of the film's entire length, before erupting into one of the most stunning pieces of overacting I have ever seen on screen. ""Marc Antony is DEAD!!"" he screams. ""The soup is hot, the soup is cold, Marc Antony is alive Marc Antony is DEAD!!! THESE WORDS SHOULD BE HOWLED FROM THE ROOFTOPS, etc, etc,"" some old bollocks. Fairly risible stuff.

1852340,5,B00008MOUP,"I never knew why Liz was chronically sick while making this movie. The documentary explains that the sets were initially disastously filmed in a damp england to get free production help from the government there. Since Mankiewicz rewrote the film as he directed when he was asked to step in and take over in Italy, the movie is filmed chronologically. Liz Taylor playing Cleopatra gained alot of weight from the time she starred with Julius  in 1961 to the time she was involved with Mark Anthony. But she practically bankrupted the studio with 1M salary + 15,000/wk overtime.
Alot has come to light about who Cleopatra was since 1963. She was average in looks but gifted in intellect and was ruthlessly ambitious, unprecedented for her time. She knew how to create her own legend and charisma back in rome and egypt. Her inspiration was more Alexander the great, rather than the god Isis. The film shows her photogenic recall of the terrain of her country and the hidden doors of her palace. She understood how egypt's natural resources was essential to rome in trade. Caesar is written  as the military genius he was and portrays Cleopatra in a secondary role, as when she protests the accidental burning of the library in Alexandria near the maritime ships when Caesar is trapped there outnumbered. She asks him to put the fire out. He did not confide in her his plans.  The movie shows that she read about his military campaigns, then why didn't it show her as a military leader. Julius reminds her he  saved her from being stabbed by her brother Ptolomy's advisor. In 1963 Hollywood was afraid to show women powerhouses and still being rescued by stronger men. I wish some of Cleopatra's writing and details about the fire at Alexandria's library caused by Julius  and what books were lost were covered.",1348272000,,1808,4.782051282051282
1852341,5,B00008MOUP,"After nearly 50 years since the release of CLEOPATRA, it's time we got past the scandal and hype about how it nearly sank 20th Century Fox and appreciate the film for the monumental masterpiece it is. The combination of intense drama with eye-popping pageantry and spectacle has never again been seen in motion pictures, and never will. No, I'm not forgetting James Cameron's CGI shortcuts TITANIC and AVATAR, which I don't for a minute put in the same league with CLEOPATRA, a film that literally took blood, sweat and tears to create. No expense was spared, everything was built to size, and you see it all on the screen.

When CLEOPATRA was released in 1963 it was the most expensive movie ever made up to that time, and probably still is in today's adjusted dollars. Yet, even with its massive scope and opulence, CLEOPATRA's human story doesn't get buried. This is due to the intelligent script and direction, both courtesy of Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and to the excellent performances of everyone in the cast, from leading to supporting players. Elizabeth Taylor is pure perfection as the ambitious, seductive Queen of the Nile who uses her wiles to achieve her goals. She's breathtakingly beautiful, oozing with sexuality, and brainy to boot. It's simply one of Liz's best EVER. As Marc Antony, Richard Burton delivers a super-charged performance that's in total harmony with the character's complexities and grandeur of the film. He also includes plenty of his characteristic sarcasm and self-loathing, without which a Burton performance would be incomplete. The fact that he and Taylor fell in love during production worked to good advantage toward fueling the on-screen drama. In his superb portrayal of Julius Caesar, Rex Harrison brought a distinguished, world-weariness and vulnerability to the role that's so potent, his presence is felt even in the second half in which he doesn't appear. A standout is Roddy McDowall as Octavian - he's really a lot of fun to watch and almost steals every scene he's in.

The screenplay was based on several sources and takes some historical license, but most of it is factual and the political situation that existed between Rome and Egypt at the time is accurately and intricately played out. Indeed, it's fair to say that one can learn something about the ancient world from watching CLEOPATRA. Noteworthy too is that with a running time of four hours and eleven minutes, the narrative is remarkably tight. There aren't any redundant scenes or silly diversions thrown in just to eat up footage; all the action has a definite purpose, which is to serve the story. THIS is how a long movie should be made.

Not to be overlooked is Alex North's lavishly exotic musical score. While it contains the necessary epic style - plenty of pomp and grandiose fanfares -  the score is also multi-layered with delicately orchestrated themes. There's a slinky, snake-like quality to the music that fits the film like an Egyptian headdress.

The art direction/set decoration and costume designs are spectacular, among the best in film history and add immensely to the viewing pleasure. In fact, CLEOPATRA won Oscars in those categories as well as for cinematography and special effects.

20th Century Fox's Blu-ray edition of this phenomenal film is flat-out gorgeous. The image is razor sharp so that the most minute details in fabrics and backgrounds register clearly. Colors are rock steady and vibrant. The 70mm format is reproduced faithfully in 1080p resolution. It really is a joy to watch this stunning presentation of such a visually rich movie. The audio is also the best it's ever been, well balanced and channeled properly so that voices are crisp and sound effects aren't overbearing. The music is clear without any distortions, making the subtler textures, muffled in previous editions, more noticeable.

The extras are the same as Fox's 2001 DVD, minus the stills gallery and foreign issue trailers. There are, however, some new features: Cleopatra Through the Ages: A Cultural History; CLEOPATRA's Missing Footage; Fox Movie Channel presents Fox Legacy with Tom Rotham; and The CLEOPATRA Papers: A Private Correspondence.

With the release of CLEOPATRA the era of grand scale, epic filmmaking was coming to an end, never to rise again. Treat yourself to a sterling example of the kind of high class entertainment Hollywood was capable of dishing out once upon a time - it'll make you forget the gossip and marvel in the artistry.

1852357,5,B00008MOUP,"Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, Richard Burton is Marc Antony, and Rex Harrison is Julius Caesar. Right away you know this has got to be a great movie. It had a record-breaking budget for its day, amazing sets and costumes and opulent pageantry. And best of all, a behind the scenes romance between Taylor and Burton that made the on-screen passion so authentic and so electric.

I suppose there's little need to summarize the plot, since most of us got the gist of it in ancient history when we were in high school. But the film is just over four hours long, so I suppose I must say something.

For one thing, the decision to go to Egypt was the same for Caesar first and Antony second: Rome needed money to pay her soldiers, and grain to feed them. Egypt was fertile and grew much grain, and had fabulous wealth for the time. When Caesar went, Egypt was ruled by Cleopatra and her spoiled brat of a brother, jointly, and her brother had chased Cleo out of Alexandria. She returns rolled in a carpet as a ""gift"" for Caesar. What else could he do but fall in love with her?

But Caesar already had a wife back in Rome, who was infertile. So when Cleo promises him sons, he marries her in an Egyptian ceremony. And indeed, by the time he is forced by circumstances to return to Rome, Cleo is already pregnant with the son she will bring with her to Rome when she is finally invited some 2 or 3 years later. She arrives in the most opulent display of conspicuous consumption, including several troupes of dancing slaves, and a huge statue of the Sphinx which she and her son ride, all dressed in cloth of gold.

Unfortunately, the Ides of March puts an end to that romance. This makes Cleo something of a persona non grata in Rome, and she returns to Egypt. That's just on the first disc, which ends with ""intermission.""

Marc Antony is one of three consuls of Rome after Julius' murder, with the other two being chosen by the Senate and immediately starting the schemes and backbiting which characterized the early Roman Senate as much as today's Senate does.

Antony marries his co-counsel's sister as a necessary political move (remember that Caesar also had one wife in Rome and another in Alexandria), and when Cleo learns of it, she is furious. So she makes a big show of humiliating him, and eventually accepts him for what he is. Makes a person wonder whether there really can be love between two such powerful people. And yet there was clearly much passion, since both sacrificed much to their relationship.

There's a big question as to what the alliance between Egypt and Rome was really about. Rome wanted money and grain; Egypt wanted power. But I think there really was a passionate love with Cleopatra in both Caesar and Antony. I have to admit I didn't understand all the political intrigues and such, although I will accept that they are historically accurate. It just seems as though everyone had at least two faces, except perhaps the servants.

There was much reminiscent of Romeo & Juliet in the end of the story, when first Cleopatra believes Antony is dead even though he is not, and then Antony believes Cleopatra is dead, though he is not. Finally, they both commit suicide; Antony when he believed Cleo was dead, and then after he is mortally wounded by his own sword, she comes to him, alive, and holds his head in her lap until he dies. Then, as you know, she took up the asp. One tragic aspect was the fantastic loyalty of her two primary serving women, who committed suicide with her.

It's a powerful movie, with three of the best actors of our time, and absolutely amazing spectacles that may explain the record-breaking budget.",1337126400,,3657,4.570992366412214
1852358,5,B00008MOUP,We were going on a long drive and I watched the movie while my husband drove.  It was an awesome thing to get to see a movie while riding along.,1336867200,,144,3.8
1852359,5,B00008MOUP,"You may not believe this, but after renting a download of this movie, I was so astounded by its imagery and scenic quality, that I immediately ordered a Blu-Ray player (I'm not a gadget guy and didn't own one), so that I can see this movie in all its glory, not merely DVD quality. The color, the cinematography, the set design, the astounding spectacle all make this entertaining to view even with the sound turned off. In comparison, modern digitally edited and enhanced movies, particularly the popular features by James Cameron, all look Mickey Mouse. Literally. Using this movie as a standard,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B002VPE1AW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>&nbsp;looks as realistic as a Mickey Mouse cartoon (as does his movie about the boat). Even the theatrical screenings of modern, digitally-projected movies look muddy, and the standards of cinema seem to have gone the way of musicianship in pop music.

Another reason for owning a copy of Cleopatra is the acting. Both Rex Harrison and Richard Burton were celebrated Shakespearians in their day, and they curiously recite their lines in this movie at a rapid pace in the traditional Shakespearian manner. That's somewhat unsettling, especially today, when most actors deliver their lines in the manner of an apprentice fry cook, but after watching all four hours, you may find yourself affecting a British accent.

The main reason for purchasing this movie is sex. If you are young, you owe it to yourself to learn what all the fuss was about Elizabeth Taylor. Yes, she's the hottest thing since sunburn, but there's something very important to see here.

Today, a sexy woman -- someone considered ""hot"" -- is judged so by how slutty she appears. If her makeup, her hair, her apparel, her demeanor all combine to give her the appearance of a streetwalker, that's considered sexy. So sex is now trashy and slovenly, a low-class thing.  If this standard were applied to men, I suppose a vagrant pushing a shopping cart would be ""hot."" In this movie, Elizabeth Taylor radiates sexuality, yet she's regal, powerful, confident.  Of course she's beautiful, but it's her style and comportment, her presence, which make her sexy.

That there will never be another movie spectacle like this one is another symptom of America's decline. For most of its history, the United States was the most puritanical nation on Earth, but now that we are no longer oppressed by censorship, in its place we are presented only with the Lowest Common Denominator.

I believe that more important than casting a ballot in an election, is when one votes with a dollar. If you spend your money on fast food or factory food, then more of it will be made available. If you order the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-Gone-Wild/dp/B0002K3QDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls Gone Wild</a>&nbsp;videos, then more will be produced. Even if I watch the Cleopatra disk only once, I'm still glad I bought it, because I voted, with my dollars, for the finest cinematography, the finest acting, the greatest sets, and one of the most dramatic stories in history.  That's what I want.

Get this movie! Why settle for anything less?",1335916800,,3269,5.332038834951456
1852360,4,B00008MOUP,"It's a classic; what can I say? Liz Taylor dominates the screen. I saw this in the 60's when I was 8 and didn't remember much. Seeing it now, I'm amazed at how racy it was; and would still be a little racy for network TV. Liz repeatedly bares as much as she can without showing the goods and they've even got a dancing girl who's braless, wearing pasties shaking what her momma gave her. This film must have pushed the envelope back in '63. But that aside, Taylor's acting, coupled with the natural heat between her and multiple-time husband Richard Burton make it entertaining. It's not a great movie, but there was too much talent for it to be a flop. If you're building a library of classic cinema, this should be in it.",1332806400,,723,4.362962962962963
1852371,5,B00008MOUP,"This restored version - the 4-hour release that was immediately rejected by theatres as impossible to screen 2x per night, forcing more than an hour to be cut - is an absolute delight for the eyes.  From the first minutes when Caesar appears, I was utterly riveted by the splashy spectacle, the evocation of a vastly different time, and acting that can only be called first rate.  The only thing that threw me off, as a Roman history nut, was the ridiculous historical inaccuracies that could only be made by an ignoramus.

On the positive side, the drama is a complete success:  Cleopatra, the last Ptolemaic queen of Egypt, uses her feminine attributes and fine mind to advance a dream of staying in power and perhaps even create a new empire based on Roman power.  To do so, she seduces first Julius Caesar, who restores her to power in a civil war with her brother-husband, and bears him a son.  Once Julius dies, she then seduces his lieutenant, Marc Anthony, eventually losing to the wily Octavian, Caesar's adopted son.  In the process, she genuinely falls in love with Anthony, perhaps for the first time in her life.  They die together by their own hand.  Surely, this is one of the greatest dramas of power and love in the history of mankind and it is the basis of this film, executed to perfection.

The costumes, sets, and images of sex and power are wonderfully vivid, which the bluray version (I have the British one that is available for $10 in Europe) brings with the sharpest of clarity.  Beyond the actors (whose salaries were the highest ever paid), these props are the reason for the cost of the film.  In my opinion, they were worth every penny as there are few film experiences that could compete.

Finally, there is the acting.  Taylor, just after her 1950s prime, is at her best as a politically savvy seductress, aging and scrambling to maintain her nation and heir in their positions of prominence.  I found her convincing, astonishingly beautiful, and realistically shrewd.  In my view, Rex Harrison believably projects the universal genius of Julius Caesar, whose calm in the face of overwhelming odds and ever-changing political calculus are implacable and unpredictable.  McDowall is also a good Octavian, who he plays as a sleazy, effeminate conniver, ultimately perhaps the smartest of all.  The only principle I feel does not give a subtle and interesting performance is Burton, whose Anthony, while flawed as a love-starved drunk, is blandly formulaic.  The supporting characters, such as Agrippa, are not all that distinguished, with the exception of the courtier Hugh Cronin.

On the negative side, the script really needed a scholar as consultant.  Given that Mankiewicz was re-writing the script while directing, this was perhaps impossible.  It is a pity, because while most of the blooper inaccuracies do not detract seriously from the storyline, they were constant irritants kind of like a buzzing mosquito at night.  For example, Agrippa appears as a middle-aged lieutenant of Julius Caesar, when the person with whom he rose to prominence was Octavian, his coeval.  But there are bigger problems as well.  Just prior to his assassination, Julius is shown as demanding that he be named King by the Senate, which he was far too subtle ever to do in life.  This fundamentally distorts his character, making him more of a simple tyrant than a master manipulator whose end game, if he had one, will never be known due to his premature death.  Finally, there are many political complexities that are left uncovered, such as Anthony's massive and unprecedented failure to conquer Parthia.  Anthony also had many implacable enemies, such as Cicero, whose right hand he had nailed to the Senate doorway during the civil war that followed Caesar's assassination.  I know I sound like a pedant, but given the lavishness of the production, why not have made it more accurate?

With all of its flaws, I still recommend this warmly.  The extras are also excellent, such as the documentary of the chaos of its production.",1331251200,,4049,4.901615271659325
1852372,5,B00008MOUP,"Good news about the UK blu-ray of CLEOPATRA:

 The double-disc set is a stunner, and no one waiting for this big one will be disappointed. It's glorious and looks to be mastered from the latest Todd-AO 70mm source. Colors are rich and detail and depth are superb. The DTS HD 6-track master offers up splendid fidelity and the original, discrete 4-track stems are offered as a Dolby-digital audio option.

 The Overture, Entr'acte and Exit music are intact, but once again, the intermezzo music is misplaced at the end of the first disc. The distraction of this alteration isn't too bad since the second disc starts immediately with a continuation of the film as soon as it loads (there is not a pause for menu startup). All the musical interludes are played against a card displaying red velvet curtains, instead of a black screen as in the theatrical prints. The curtain cards worked for me because they actually look pretty cool.

 I haven't watched the extras, but they are the same as the Fox DVD sets, along with the inclusion of some new material especially for the blu-ray. Extras are spread across both discs. There is one entitled CLEOPATRA'S Missing Footage - which should probably offer up the latest on the original 6-hour intent.

The authors mention the use of sails aboard Cleopatra's flagship as evidence of her strategy to return of Egypt.  This simple fact gets left out of too many Rome-centered works for historians, so I am both surprised and satisfied that it was presented in this glorious picture book.

1852378,3,B00008MOUP,"This 1963 film is famous for all the wrong reasons.  It cost millions of dollars, was delayed because of Elizabeth Taylor's illnesses and brought about a real love affair between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  Of course I remember all the publicity but had never seen the film before.  So here are my impressions.

It sure is long, a full four hours.  Good thing I was watching it on Netflix at home because I was able to take several days to watch it.

Elizabeth Taylor looks great but body types and styles have changed.  In the year 2011 she looks a little too short and dumpy.

The costumes are ""over the top"" terrific and  the best part of the film.  Every few minutes there is a costume change and I applaud the costume designers for being able to create so many outstanding outfits for Cleopatra.

Rex Harrison is a fine actor and does a great job as Julius Caesar.  So does Roddy McDowell as Octavian.

Richard Burton just didn't capture the strength of Mark Anthony.  Most of the time he seemed like a lovesick cow lusting after Cleopatra.

The sets were well done and extremely theatrical.  I did get the feeling of the splendor of Rome and Egypt.

I enjoyed the film mostly because it reminded me of 1963 and what a big fuss everyone made about the film at the time.  Certainly it is worth seeing, if only for the costumes and its place in movie history.",1313452800,,1372,4.463709677419355
1852379,5,B00008MOUP,"More than 20 centuries ago, the city of Rome precariously maintained its semblance of a republic.  Civil wars were common.  In one such, Julius Caesar's legions defeat Pompey's, but Pompey escapes to Egypt . . . .

If you are Julius Caesar you take no pleasure in pursing Pompey, he had married your daughter after all, but he started this war.  At Alexandria you learn that King Ptolemy - to please you - had Pompey killed; you were not pleased.  Nor was Rome pleased with the disruption of grain from Egypt because of the sibling war between Ptolemy and Cleopatra . . . .

If you are Cleopatra you want Caesar to make you sole ruler of Egypt, but you find that your feminine wiles bounce off him like spears off of armor.  It's your brother's foolish assault on Caesar's legions, that results in Caesar placing you on the throne.  You fall in love, marry, bear his son, go to Rome, but then, treachery in the Senate rudely ends your dream . . . .

If you are Marc Antony you have defeated the conspirators, and now you are proconsul of the eastern Roman domain, but your men are deserting; you need to pay them.  You finally swallow your pride and ask Cleopatra for help.  You quickly fall under her spell, like a man befuddled by too many chalices of wine, you are helpless before Cleopatra . . . .

If you are Cleopatra you see in Marc Antony a second chance to make your dream come true.  You fall in love, but Antony doesn't share your dream.  After he marries Octavian's sister, you become invective, humiliating him before his men.  You begin making his military decisions for him, unfortunately you haven't mastered the art of war . . . .

1852411,3,B00008MOUP,"Okay - so I have a fascination for Cleopatra and have read whatever I can get my hands on on this woman, very few accounts describe the true essence of Cleopatra and rather we are bombarded with propaganda from Rome, who didn't think much of a Queen in a client country (under Roman rule) in opposition to Caesar towards the later part of her life. She was incredibly charming, witty, intelligent and oozing with finese. She ruled the Egypt with an steady hand and won the hearts of her people by respecting there gods, learning their language (past Pharohs spoke Greek- none took the time to learn their native Egyptian lauguage)and ruling fair and justly attending to all matters with her people personally brandishing a smile. She effectively managed the country's supply of food while selling rashings to other countries (like Rome), managed the creating of fleet ships in Alexandria, praised herself as a direct descent from Alexandar the great. With all this said I was expecting to see a vibrant, lively, seductively charming woman with a sharp tongue and incredible wit.

The character of Cleopatra portrayed was soo far from the charming, charsmatic woman. Elizabeth Taylor played a bratty queen with a power hungry thrist to end the world if she had to just to gain wealth. This was not Cleopatra at all, she was strong yes and she had authority yes, but she also was the epitome of feminity - full of grace, bathed in milk and honey - not bratty or annoying but charming and with her soothing words she made men fall to her knees.

A War Movie:

In many ways this film is a war film.  We have Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) and his lieutenant Ruffio (Martin Landau) grinning while they've put down a civil war by Pompeo.  Amazing scenes of the Roman legions, the burning of the funeral pyres.

Later in the film, Marc Antony (Richard Burton) is convinced to fight against Octavius (Roddy McDowell) because he is in love with Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) and wants to have Egypt as their own empire.  He loses miserably on the high seas.  The burning boats, his abandonment of his men for Cleo's barge -- just amazing imagery.

Political Movie:

The scenes of the Senate in Rome are interesting.  Great to see several character actors I've seen in other films and Carroll O'Connor as one of the assassins of Caesar who would later make TV history in the 70s as Archie Bunker.  The arguing as they held their red and white togas in check was humorous.  The intrigue as Octavius convinces one and all that a fight with Egypt is the way to go.

The spearing of Cleo's advisor during this near riot outside the Senate building was horrific and true to form.  William Shakespeare could not have written this better (oh wait, he did!  But I digress.).

Romantic Film:

Of course the themes of love pepper this film, but more than what you might think.  Rex Harrison as Caesar suffering from seizures, falling for Cleopatra and she having a son by him, all very nice.

Liz Taylor plays several nearly nude scenes during the time with Caesar that are quite tasteful yet sexy -- the bath with the vestal virgins, the wild dancing & dinner entertainment, the colors and the pageantry.  Amazing.

As we know the story of the suicides of Antony and Cleopatra does not make the scenes less horrific and interesting.  And Roddy McDowell as the crestfallen Octavius who wanted more than anything to march her through Rome for political purpose was dashed.

Pageantry:

The pageantry of the film, the amazing costumes and the tightly controlled production values with the cast of thousands (no CGI in those days) with war ships and amazingly realistic sets, it's no wonder that 20th Century Fox nearly went bankrupt with such an amazing film.

Cleopatra must have been in at least ten or fifteen different gowns and dresses, and many wigs, jewelry, bracelets and necklaces to set back Tiffany's!  I believe the film won an Academy Award for Best Costumes.

Bottom Line:

This film has everything -- from costumes and designs, from war and strategy, political intrigue, in-fighting, betrayal, death by sword or suicide, and yes a bit of overacting on the parts of Burton and Taylor.  But hey, it's an epic!  Highly recommended.",1301184000,,2857,4.734279918864098

In recent years the film has gained in popularity (see its IMDb rating). Although the story is often historically inaccurate and moves slowly in spots, this one's also consistently lavish, glamorous, bigger than life and everything a Hollywood epic used to be but is no more. If you like sprawling romantic costume dramas, you're sure to enjoy CLEOPATRA!  (Highly recommended.)

We see here the initial sparks between Burton and Taylor that led to Liz's divorce from crooner Eddie Fisher (the poor guy was on the set watching as his wife strayed), and to a pair of tumultous Liz and Dck marriages. For all her glitter and allure, Rex Harrison commands the screen when he's up against the formidable Taylor.

1852420,4,B00008MOUP,"This FOX twin-VHS set is of mid-80s vintage, a full screen dub without HiFi audio, just a monaural linear track.

CLEOPATRA (UK/USA-1963) was a legendary ""flop"" that won 4 Oscars, ran to full houses for months and eventually earned back its enormous cost. A bloated $44 million budget is still one of the highest ever (in 2011 dollars ""Cleo"" cost $300 million!).

In recent years the film has gained in popularity (see its IMDb rating). Although the story is often historically inaccurate and moves slowly in spots, this one's also consistently lavish, glamorous, bigger than life and everything a Hollywood epic used to be but is no more. If you like sprawling romantic costume dramas, you're sure to enjoy CLEOPATRA!  (Highly recommended.)

We see here the initial sparks between Burton and Taylor that led to Liz's divorce from crooner Eddie Fisher (the poor guy was on the set watching as his wife strayed), and to a pair of tumultous Liz and Dck marriages. For all her glitter and allure, Rex Harrison commands the screen when he's up against the formidable Taylor.

Supporting cast includes Hume Cronyn, Martin Landau and Roddy McDowall.

1852441,5,B00008MOUP,"There seems to be a great deal of confusion regarding the various running times attributed to ""Cleopatra"", and which version is available on home video as of early 2012.  Let me try to help those readers who have been seeking to purchase the most complete version possible.

When director and editor Joseph L. Mankiewicz first screened the rough cut for Fox executives back in 1963, the film ran approximately 5 and a half hours.  Mankiewicz conceived the film being released as two separate features, the first detailing Cleopatra's relationship with Julius Caesar and the second exploring her liaison with Marc Antony.  Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck adamantly refused Mankiewicz' plan:  Fox had so much money invested in the film that the studio was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Zanuck wanted to rush the film into theatres quickly and recoup as much money as possible while the public was still fascinated by the real-life romantic scandal taking place between Elizabeth Taylor (Cleopatra) and Richard Burton (Antony).  He ordered Mankiewicz to edit the film down to a cut that ran a little over four hours (248 minutes).  This is the version that was shown to reviewers and early ""roadshow"" audiences.

However, when it came time to send the film into general release, theatre owners complained that the movie was so long, it could only be shown once per evening.  Zanuck agreed and had the film cut again, down to about 222 minutes, and then a second time to a little over three hours in length (192 minutes) so that it could be shown twice per evening and thus, theoretically, bring in twice as much money, and quickly.  This 192 minute theatrical version thus became the most complete edition of the film that most original audiences ever saw.

However, with the advent of the home video revolution and the consequent revival of interest in the film, Fox searched their vaults and came up with a print of the four hour ""roadshow"" edition, and it is this print which is currently available on DVD in both the out-of-print 3-disc ""Five Star Collection"" and the current 2-disc ""Award Series"" releases.  Although various press releases advertise the DVDs as running 193 minutes (including, at present, the Amazon Item Descriptions), they are incorrect.  The DVDs run approximately 248 minutes, with the feature spread out over two discs.  (The third disc in the ""Five Star Collection"" edition contains a wealth of bonus materials, including vintage multiple trailers and newsreel clips, an extensive gallery of publicity stills and portraits, and best of all, the AMC original full-length documentary, ""Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood."")

So ... if you've been avoiding a purchase because you want the most extensive cut of the film available, wait no longer!  50 years after the film was released, with the hullaballoo over the film's cost and the scandal over the Taylor-Burton affair no longer dominating viewers' minds, ""Cleopatra"" is definitely worth a look.  The performances are not nearly as bad as the initial reviewers claimed (Taylor and Burton were both lambasted while Rex Harrison received an Oscar nomination and won the National Board of Review's Best Actor accolade), and the production values are dazzling.  ""Cleopatra"" may have cost a mint and nearly sunk Fox financially, but for sheer visual spectacle it can't be beat.  The film scooped up Oscars for Cinematography, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Costumes and Special Effects, and it deserved every one of them.  It also should have garnered Roddy McDowall the Supporting Actor Oscar, but Fox mistakenly designated him as a Leading Actor, and he failed to be nominated by the Academy in that category.

As a postscript, I should mention that the search for the missing footage that would restore Mankiewicz' original vision of the film as a five-and-a-half hour blockbuster continues as of this writing.  Hopefully, we will all someday see ""Cleopatra"" as it was intended to be seen.  Until then, the 248 edition currently available is definitely recommended.",1291939200,,4045,5.077039274924472

The script was awful, and the acting even worse. Rex Harrison was horrible as Caesar, reciting his lines in a most disconcertingly bizarre manner. Elizabeth Taylor was beautiful as Cleopatra but wooden, lacking any personality or sex appeal whatsoever. Richard Burton was somewhat better, but was hardly a charismatic figure. He was certainly a bloodless shadow in comparison to James Purefoy's Marc Antony in HBO's ""Rome"" series. The best that could be said is that the sets were lavish.",1291334400,,646,5.046728971962617

1852445,5,B00008MOUP,"Epic entertainment with Elizabeth Taylor an excellent choice for the part. It illuminated historical events and personalities with color, clarity and passion. Cleopatra is portrayed as a real person, with intellect, ambition, and vulnerability, not just a lusty plaything. Multi-faceted characters, well-acted, with awesome cinematography, magnificent sets and costumes, and music that is evocative and sultry, like Cleo, like Egypt.  It's well-edited too, making a long and intricate story easy to follow.  It all comes together to give that larger than life feel, appropo for a story that historically is mythic to this day.

My only criticism is the usual casting of British actors in the roles of middle-easterners, which continues to today.  Still, this is epic movie-making, extremely well done, well worth watching, and a steal at the bargain price here.

What I loved about CLEOPATRA was once again seeing the utter beauty of Elizabeth Taylor in a very covincing role as Cleopatra and the historical elements of what transpired when she met her Marc Anthony.

The costumes, pagentry and of course her entrance into Rome brought back to me the first time I saw this film in 1963...However, in 2010, the brilliance of what Burton and Taylor brought to the screen in their roles had nothing to do with today's novel, ""Furious Love"", but to performances which are ""timeless"".",1280793600,,702,4.616

1852461,4,B00008MOUP,"I've been a fan of the swords and sandals epics for a long time now.  Sure, they aren't all great films, but for the most part they are all entertaining to say the least (""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"").  When you add a layer of `biopic' on top of that, you have really peeked my interest.  Throw the deliciously captivating Elizabeth Taylor in the mix and I am salivating in my seat.

I'll take four hours of that please!

Now, I was thoroughly entertained when watching `Cleopatra', but as my opening paragraph outlines for you, that is not something that should be a shock.  This film is right up my ally.  The four hour running time may be daunting, but I nestled in my bed (forget the couch) on a rainy Saturday afternoon and just soaked it all in.  Despite my thorough enjoyment, I must say that this film was not everything it could have been.

Let's start with the good.

When you think of beautiful and lavish set pieces (which are total requirements for any epic worth its weight) you automatically think of `Cleopatra'.  The film is one eye-popping image after another.  The costumes are perfectly tailored to embellish the beauty of the stars (talk about three beautiful people) and the scenery is so worth chewing on that at times you can be drawn away from the events as your eyes focus in on the gorgeous surroundings.  When you add to that sharp editing and crisp music you have a stunning and captivating canvas.  I also loved the overall tone of this film.  Some have complained that it was too `talky', but politics are some of the most important and interesting aspects of films of this nature and thus they need to be discussed.  In fact, it can be these `politics' that carry the entire film (just look at `Spartacus', a film that fails miserably in scenes that DON'T involve the political side of things).  I actually admired the script here, the way in which it is woven, truly fleshing out the entirety of this gigantic story.

One of my issues is the tonal shift when the two halves of the story break.  The first half of the film concerns Cleopatra and her husband, Caesar.  The second half involves Cleopatra and her lover, Mark Antony.  For me, the film feels like two separate films.  Overall it works, but it does lack fluidity in that department.

You can feel the `shift'.

When you consider the acting, first and foremost SHOULD be Elizabeth Taylor.  I mean, she plays Cleopatra, and the films title IS `Cleopatra'.  Sadly, when I think of the acting in `Cleopatra' I immediately think of Richard Burton and Rex Harrison.  The fact remains that, while the film is about Cleopatra, the true stars are the men who fell under her spell.  Taylor is stunning to watch, but she also overworks a lot of her scenes.  Harrison and Burton on the other hand completely melt into their roles and present to us two distinctly dynamic (and extremely memorable) portrayals of these two very important historical figures.  Taylor gets lost in the shuffle, and thus Cleopatra as a woman gets lost because we are so enamored with Caesar and Mark.

In the end I can recommend and revel in this films majesty because, despite a few flaws, the film really is captivating and beautifully done.  Sure, it can feel longwinded at times, but isn't that what you expect from any biographical epic trying to give us `what we paid for'?",1262649600,,3337,4.612903225806452
1852462,3,B00008MOUP,"'Cleopatra' is a four-hour, very talky and plotty yarn, set against some of the most elaborate and exquisite scenery ever put on film. It is also the ultimate example of Hollywood excess and movie star ego.

With a very literate script and an outstanding cast, 'Cleopatra' should have been a blockbuster, and yet it comes across as a lumbering behemoth, beautiful and intelligent while also plodding and distant. Scene after scene goes by, with endless dialogue and exposition but very little action. It's as if Manckiewicz were filming a stage production, rather than a big budget feature. Kudos to the set and costume designers for their almost overwhelmingly elaborate creations, and extra kudos to Rex Harrison for virtually carrying the first two hours of the film.

Cleopatra is a relic of a Hollywood age gone by; the age of the epic specatcle. Though worth the 4 hour time investment, it is not one of the all-time greats, and yet its sheer star power in the form of Elizabeth Taylor makes it a classic despite itself.",1257811200,,1026,4.857142857142857

1852464,4,B00008MOUP,"Cleopatra is a majestic and sumptuous film. The stage sets of Rome and Alexandria are nothing short of amazing, especially given that none of it is computer generated. For anyone who has watched the HBO series ""Rome"" this will be a treat to watch. The HBO series portrayed a grittier side of Roman life, and never dealt at all with the two years Cleopatra lived in Rome with Julius Caesar so watching ""Cleopatra"" is almost like seeing six more episodes of the series with the focus on life in Alexandria where the Macedonian lived.

  Elizabeth Taylor puts in a fine performance as Cleopatra, as does Rex Harrison portraying Julius Caesar, Roddy McDowell playing Octavian, and Richard Burton as Antony. Relying mostly on Plutarch's ""Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans""  Cleopatra covers the years that she knew Caesar before his death, and then up to her own death. The difference between HBO's representation of her apparently debaucherous final years living  with Antony are in striking contrast to the elegant presentation we have here. It is constantly mentioned in writings about her that she was a highly educated woman who knew many languages. And if she were living today she would have mingled easily with the intelligentsia. It would have been interesting to see more of this side of her. She was not known to have been overly beautiful, but it is this glamorous angle that is usually presented. Perhaps someday someone will make a film from this point of view. Elizabeth Taylor, however, does convey convincingly a complex woman who lives with great fervor.

  This movie is 248 minutes long but I wished that there had been more. I would have liked to see a reconstruction of the Library of Alexandria before it was burnt, and more about Cleopatra's life before she met Julius Caesar.

This movie is a magnificent spectacle of pomp and pageantry. Some of the sets are nearly beyond belief, such as the grandeur of the palaces of Alexandria, and the grand procession of Cleopatra's entrance into Rome as she is regally attired and perched on the extended legs of a colossal black stoned sphinx being pulled through the gates of Rome by hundreds of men. The quality of this DVD is also splendid and richly showcases the breathtaking colors and textures of the film.

Contrast this to Liz Taylor who is as white as snow, aging and fairly fat (OK voluptuous to those in the same weight catagory.) Not only was the obvious display of cleavage distracting but I couldn't get over the eye makeup! Must have taken hours...for one eye...and just think how comfortable it would be if some of that glitter fell in her eyes! Inthe Rome series, their little Cleo gets by without any makeup until she duds herself up to march in and reclaim her throne from her fat little juvenile delinquent brother. Now THAT series had drama!

My hat is off to those who want the original 6(?) hour movie to be made available. I don't think I could stay awake if it was cut to 2 hours. A real snoozer, but could be a hilarious party movie if you were to get drunk.

Go with the ""Rome"" series!",1219363200,,1165,4.30593607305936
1852510,5,B00008MOUP,"For Roman history enthusiasts this is one of the best films to recreate the nearly-vanished glory and grandeur that was Rome.

It brings to life the story of Julius Caesar and fall of the Republic followed by the rise of Augustus. This is familiar to everyone so I'll not repeat it here.

For Roman history enthusiasts there are other films that bring Rome to life but none that do as grandly.

Spartacus comes closest. Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire gives a good look at the later Roman Empire during the time of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Gladiator had some high points, especially the opening battle scene. Quo Vadis is not bad but extant prints are of low quality.
The recent HBO/BBC miniseries Rome was very good but suffered from some unnecessary dull storylines (proto-Mafiosi in the Aventine,? what nonsense) added to pad the running time. The 1980's Last Days of Pompeii TV mini-series with Ned Beatty is unwatchably poor (unavailable except on TCM AFAIK). Ben Hur was a grand spectacle but the focus was less on Rome than on the Christian aspect of the story.

The grandeur of Cleopatra's entrance to Forum alone is worth the price of admission. The included making-of documentary explains that the set designer thought the real Rome forum (which still exists as a ruin in downtown Rome) was thought too small. The filmakers recreated it a Cinecitta larger-than-life.

Elizabeth Taylor acting has been criticized but the movie was conceived as a star vehicle for her. She was an enormous star at the time; the movie would not have been made without her. The documentary details an aborted early attempt at filming on soundstages in London. After spending huge sums on sets and months in pre-production, Taylor fell ill and nearly died. An emergency tracheostomy was needed to save her life. Filming stopped for months. When it resumed in Rome with a new director, all the previously shot footage was scrapped. New Director Mankiewicz shot so much new footage shot that he entertained thoughts of having two 3-4 hour films. The first would have been Caesar and Cleopatra and the second was to be , Antony and Cleopatra. This idea was scrapped when Twentieth Century Fox was nearly bankrupted by production cost over-runs. The extra footage has been lost (for now).

Richard Burton had become a middling star after a few moderately successful film role but it was his role as King Arthur in Camelot on Broadway that rocketed him to the top. Oddly enough, it was this Broadway musical that made Burton the biggest star in Hollywood.

The pairing of the two stars inevitably led to their relationship. Great pains were taken to keep the secret but was the romance was eventually revealed. There is a famous first photo of the two of them together lounging on a boat at a beach near Rome. There was great fear of a public backlash as both stars were married. Clergy in the US denounced the relationship and called for the film to be boycott.

I'm a fan of Burtons but I can see some of the shortcomings of his performance. If he intended it to be over-the-top, he succeeded.

Rex Harrison is superb as Caesar. Some of Caesar's lines are tinged with inappropriate humour.  In this the filmakers got it wrong While Caesar was famous for rousing speeches intended to fire up the legions before battle, he was not a stand-up comedian.

Roddy McDowall is quite good as a young Ovtavian and actually does resemble the famous Augustus of Prima Porta found at Livia's villa near Rome. His role is harmed by editing that makes him inexplicably pop up at the end of film. Almost no context is given for his having been chosen Caesar's heir. In fact Octavian had endeared himself to Caesar for his (minor) actions as aide-de-camp during the Civil Wars. Octavian was also Caesar's great-nephew. After Caesar's assassination he is adopted as Caesar's son according to his will and begins to refer to Caesar as his father. Among the Romans, this adoption of one man by another via a will was unheard of. Octavian's referring to himself as the son of Caesar thereafter would have been considered wholly appropriate. Octavian's rivalry with Antony was poorly explained. Fourteen years passed  beween the death of Caesar and the defeat of Antony and  Cleopatra during which time the realtions between them varied from friendship to war. After the defeat of Cleopatra, her son (by Caesar)Caesarion was killed. The film does not dwell on this fact.

The Battle of Actium was poorly realized but I can't hold that against the rest of the film.

Some of the supporting characters are a bit jarring. Archie Bunker as Casca and Rollin Hand as Rufio play their roles acceptably well but you can't help but associate them with their TV characters.

I give this my highest recommmedation; it is arguably the best film about ancient Rome ever made.",1205884800,,4835,4.807228915662651
1852511,4,B00008MOUP,"This epic blockbuster was interesting and entertaining on many levels, though I wonder if when it was released it was considered either a box office or a critical success. It obviously had a huge budget, so I wonder if it was able to make enough at the box office to pay for itself. Lavish costumes and sets, battle scenes with hundreds of extras, not to mention the big stars: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Roddy McDowell, and Martin Landau. It was long--it took me three nights spread out over a few months to wade through it. I can imagine the theaters complaining, since they could have fewer showings per day, and the audiences must have also been complaining about the length, too. It was undoubtedly ballyhooed with massive hype, making it even harder to live up to the expectations.

There are two ways to look at it. First, as an epic telling of an historical tale of wars, conquest, the Roman Empire and the dynasty of Egypt and the pharaohs, not to mention Cleopatra. The lavish costumes, sets, and battles certainly contributed to the success of this way of looking at it. Richard Burton was very believable as Mark Antony, a warrior with two fatal weaknesses--women and wine. Perhaps that wasn't too much of a stretch for him. Though Burton came first, I was reminded of Russell Crowe's Oscar winning performance in Gladiator. Both actors were able to convince that they were warriors, yet there was something deeper than that in there as well. Elizabeth Taylor was great at the thrust and parry of seduction and court intrigue, but I couldn't picture her as Cleopatra, she was just too pale to be Egyptian. Besides, she is an Icon of Beauty in her own right, and I found it hard to suspend disbelief. No matter how well she acted, I was always aware that it was Elizabeth Taylor; no matter how much mascara she wore, Liz Taylor, baby. Rex Harrison, even more so. What was Henry Higgins doing pretending to be Julius Caesar? I half expected Dr. Doolittle to talk to the animals. Strangely though, Roddy McDowell was much more successful at portraying Octavian, but I will get to that later, as it pertains to the second way of looking at Cleopatra, the epic blockbuster.

The second way of looking at it was just to enjoy the spectacle, and as much as possible speculate on the drama backstage. Draw parallels with the way Cleopatra uses theatrical techniques to make the most of her power as queen of the Nile. She always seems to be bathing when conducting her diplomatic negotiations. There is one scene where she entertains Mark Antony with a Cleopatra look-alike, and another where she makes her entrance wrapped in a carpet. At other times she is presented as the Queen of the Nile, making another dramatic entrance on the royal barge, and the hype and ballyhoo very much comments ironically on the hype and ballyhoo surrounding Elizabeth Taylor: Big Fat Movie Star. At times I couldn't help imagining Britney Spears or J. Lo in the role, but I digress.

Backstage drama galore, as there was a budding romance between Taylor and Burton, which must have driven the tabloids wild. I think it might have contributed to the bad reviews as there was a lot of wagging of fingers and tsk-tsking over the fact that Liz was still married to Eddie Fisher. But that added a lot of spice to the mix, making the scenes between the two an intriguing guessing game, looking for clues to their infidelity, tracking the precise moment when they fell in love. You could follow this trail from The Sandpiper, all the way through Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?

Finally, Roddy McDowell. His portrayal of Octavian was very well played, especially in the way he used the withering remark, stealth, guile, cunning, and even a well-placed hissy fit or two, while debating in the Roman Senate. Contrast him with Mark Anthony, who may have been a drunk and besmitten with Cleopatra, but he was a strong warrior who fought his battles bravely. McDowell's Octavian was the man you loved to hate, as he achieved his power not through battle, at least not personally, but by manipulating the emotions of the Senate and the masses. He was a perfect demagogue, working the crowd into a fever pitch, getting them to beg him to start a war with Egypt. He gave one of his best performances as the villain, making the fall of Anthony & Cleopatra all the more tragic.

So, I will give this a thumb up, just as Siskel and Ebert might have, or possibly a Roman Emperor would give to a gladiator who had fought bravely. It is entertaining on many levels, though some of the levels aren't the ones intended.

1852512,1,B00008MOUP,"Despite the lavish sets and really good acting from Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, Martin Landau (was he ever so young????), and many others, this is a wretched film.

Its wretchedness stems entirely from Liz Taylor.

She manages an astonishing feat.  She simultaneously overacts and is wooden.

I don't know how she achieves such opposite things.  She is breathtakingly bad, thrillingly terrible, awesomely awful.

Apparently she was raised on a different planet, and then plunked down on the set.  She has no idea what a human acts like, or what a real emotion is.

This explains Michael Jackson's fascination with her: birds (?) of a feather.

In a grotesque way, she is fun to watch, if you like watching bloody and terrible car wrecks over and over.

Just ghastly.  She would have to improve (A LOT) to suck.

There aren't adjectives enough in the thesaurus to say how vomitrocious her performance (?) is.",1201132800,,909,4.907894736842105

1852514,4,B00008MOUP,"With more than $25m in advance bookings in the kitty before it even opened, 20th Century Fox's notoriously out-of-control nightmarish production of Cleopatra is far from the biggest flop of all time but is certainly the most notorious. Indeed, it only has one major problem. Unfortunately, it's Elizabeth Taylor. When she's off the screen and Joseph L. Mankiewicz concentrates on Harrison's Caesar (the screen performance of his lifetime) and the events surrounding the death of the Republic, it becomes a different class of film altogether: intriguing, witty and absolutely riveting. And then the Queen of Hollywood comes on speaking Americanese (""I've done nothing but rub you up the wrong way."") and ruins it all.

Burton's Marc Antony is also a major problem. We have to take his greatness entirely on trust - we see him win no battles, nor does Mankiewicz attempt his own take on his famous oration at Julius Caesar's funeral. What we do see is Burton at his hammiest, flagon of wine constantly in hand, giving us a petulant drunken schoolboy much given to breathy intonations and snorts of outrage. His love scenes with Taylor, the odd well-written exchange aside, strike no sparks but all too-often come across as a camp rehearsal for Virginia Woolf. Still, he does at least get better as he goes along. The same cannot be said for Hume Cronyn, who is simply inept beyond belief here.

Unfortunately, when Harrison dies, so does the film, or very nearly, only showing signs of recovery in the last half hour as Roddy McDowall's superbly realised Octavian takes centre stage. There's still much to admire - the sombre opening, some beautiful writing, North's score, the lavish production design and some fine supporting performances from the likes of Martin Landau and George Cole (yes, George Cole) - but it is definitely a case of taking the rough with the smooth.

This is the uncut four-hour roadshow version, and the restored sequences, among the best in the film, really do make a difference. However, be sure to get the three-disc edition for the excellent two-hour documentary on the making of the film not included on the two-disc set.",1197763200,,2150,4.966666666666667
1852515,2,B00008MOUP,"I love period pieces and have studied Roman history from this era pretty extensively.  My review won't comment on the ""historical"" nature of the film; it's always difficult to do legitimate historical justice to a period we know so comparatively little about.  This movie is beautiful, with vivid colors and gorgeous music.

However, it's deadly dull!  Apart from some of Julius Caesar's snarky commentary in the first half, there's nothing to do but sit around and watch the scenery.  Taylor's Cleopatra is nothing like the vapid bubblehead played by Vivien Leigh in ""Caesar and Cleopatra,"" but at least Leigh made the character interesting.  Taylor moons around beautifully in funky headgear and in dresses that look like leftovers from ""Ivanhoe."" She shows very little emotion except when she learns of Antony's marriage to Octavia, at which point she rips the bedchamber to shreds with a long knife.

I'm very glad this is on DVD so I can spend the next few days watching it, rather than trying to down it all in one sitting.  I can't imagine having gone to the theatre to see it in 1963...",1195689600,,1094,4.844086021505376
1852516,2,B00008MOUP,"Well, it took me a good ten years, but I finally finished watching this movie. I have owned it in various avatars, but everytime I used to start ""Cleopatra"", I would lose it by the half hour mark, and would be fast asleep around the forty-five minute mark. This has happened at LEAST five times that I can remember.

This is not a bad movie, but you will HAVE to invest yourself in it for the first hour if you really want to finish it. It doesn't quite grab you as other historical films from the genre (if you like 'The Ten Commandments' and 'The Bible', this movie isn't as light watching as those are). I also initially had a problem with Elizabeth Taylor. In some scenes it really looked like she spent the night out drinking WAY too much alcohol, and she tried using loads of make up to cover the damage. I don't know - she didn't work for me at least 50% of the time.

Yes, if you use all the politically correct definitions under which Hollywood functions, this is a 'classic' in every sense of the word. After watching this, you should revisit the made-for-TV movie 'Cleopatra', starring Billy Zane and Leonor Varela. You judge, and tell me which is the better film. I could finish the latter in one sitting.

I think the problem is that the script here is very slow, and Eliza's Cleopatra isn't very alluring - its quite hard to care for a creature such as her, and she came across as rather vampish and trashy at times. I doubt the real Cleopatra was like this, but what do I know. I'm no historian.

Everyone has very polarized views on this movie decades after its' release. It took me years to watch it to the end. Was it worth it? Yes, I think so. Its a passably good film with lots of costumes and fanfare, but to me it lacked what makes a 'true' classic - and thats soul. Just my two cents.",1194220800,,1807,4.290322580645161

1852531,5,B00008MOUP,"I can remember as a 19 year old in the early 1960's all of the media frenzy involving the making of this film and it's two principle players: Taylor and Burton. They were household words and having one of their countless affairs, off and on again.  If my memory serves me, lovely Liz was still married to Eddie Fisher (in name only) and nearly died during the filming of ""Cleopatra.""  No film since ""Gone With the Wind"" drew more public attention and the expectations were just too high when finally released. The critical reviews were mostly negative, dwelling more on the troubled making of the film, rather that the film itself.  This surely affected the public at the box office, and it was far from a smash hit.

But this film is a legend and a real ""gem"" that time has favored over the years.  It is well-crafted by the great Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and takes it's place with the great epics of movie history like: ""Ben Hur, ""Spartacus,"" and ""Quo Vadis."" This is one of Mankiewicz""s better films, his second effort at a Roman theme since filming Brando in ""Julius Ceasar"" in 1953. Our fascination with Roman history continues to this day with the brilliant HBO series: ""Rome.""

Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz is one of those greats of movie history, both as a director and screenwriter. A collection of his films is essential to any real film collection.  I got hooked on Mankiewicz after seeing ""A Letter to Three Wives"" for the first time. His films are a proud part of my film collection, and ""Clepatra"" is one of my favorites.",1181347200,,1533,4.613970588235294
1852532,5,B00008MOUP,"I have found that the best way to learn about many subjects is to pick up a children's book from the library.  In a good children's book, the facts are clearly and engagingly laid out, often with wonderful illustrations.  You finish the book knowing that you have learned something you didn't already know, and it was explained so simply and clearly that you are not going to forget what you've learned.  Cleopatra by Diane Stanley is that kind of book.  While it is written ""simply"", it does not talk down to the child or to an adult reading the book.  It just says what happened in a memorable way. Books like these teach history the way it ought to be taught.  Highly recommended.",1181088000,,683,4.512195121951219

1852534,4,B00008MOUP,"The film is a true spectacle.  More beautiful than beautifully acted, in my opinion.  Elizabeth Taylor gives a modern day twist to the character of Cleopatra, with her sly winks and smiles, she seems to be more down to earth and blatatantly flirty than one would expect a monarch to be.  The sets are fantastic, also the acting of the two male leads.  I had hoped that this film would follow the Shakespeare play, Antony and Cleopatra, but it is nothing like the play.",1178409600,,468,4.535714285714286
1852535,3,B00008MOUP,"CLEOPATRA was originally planned as a 2 part separate release. The 1st part was to be ""Caesar & Cleopatra"" and the second ""Antony & Cleopatra."" Each was to run appx. 4 hrs. The problems on the set (and off) are well known. Elizabeth Taylor only agreed to do the role for a then staggering one million $$$. That was just the beginning of a financial nightmare for the studio. The film was drastically cut to fit into a single release. It's reported that Taylor ran out of the first screening in tears, denouncing the film, claiming that the most pivotal scenes that delineated the depth of Cleopatra's character had been deleted. What was left was a superficial interpretation of a formidable woman & leader. At times Taylor's Cleopatra comes off more as a petulant sex kitten than the last great Pharaoh of Egypt. Richard Burton's tendency for ham acting & bloated appearance didn't help.

So why see the film?

Well, there's Elizabeth Taylor's famous beauty--and it dazzles in this movie. Her make-up and hairstyles set new trends in the fashion industry. Edith Head's costume design is absolutely gorgeous. Alex North's fantastic soundtrack is one of the very best. The set design is oddly abstract at times, but it works. The ""spectacle"" scenes are great. Cleopatra's entrance into Rome is a real jaw-dropper, a delicious display of creative opulence, replete with half-naked native girls dancing to wild African music, multicolored incense smoke scattered into the spectators by exotic medicine men, whirling dervishes and a pyramid containing doves released in front of the assembled Roman Senators & their rather annoyed & envious wives--compared to the Queen of Egypt they look like frumps. This way beyond ostentatious display of art & power concludes with Taylor seated on a gold throne atop a gigantic golden sphinx (we're talking the equivalent of 3-5 stories tall), wearing a gown of pure gold feathers, with a solid gold crown three feet high stately adorning Taylor's coal black curls. (Claudette Colbert, eat your heart out!)

Unfortunately the spectacle ends with Cleopatra's golden barge sailing into a harbor in such splendor that the superstitious townsfolk think it is Aphrodite herself come to meet Bacchus in the form of Marc Antony. This scene was originally meant to be the beginning of the next sequel, but as it stands it is strangely brief and seems almost out of synch. This last half of the now truncated film fizzles out (until the famous asp scene at the end.) Reportedly the barge alone cost a million & the studio was desperate to sell it at the end of filming.

All this being said, if you've never seen the movie--you've got to. It represents the end of the spectacle film era--it's just too darn expensive. CLEOPATRA also represents a real event in 1960's culture.

1852536,5,B00008MOUP,"This 1963 film from 20th Century Fox, albeit oboviously compressed in time, offers a great opportunity for insight into the classic struggle of Rome's movement from a Republic to rule by dictatorship. Subtle references such as Cleopatra's teasing of Caesar's balding by referencing  his cognomen (nickname) ""Julius"" (means full head of hair), the burning of the great library of Alexandria, and the propaganda used by rullers of the time (Cleopatra claiming to be Isis and Caesar claiming to be related to Venus through Aeneas), give opportunity for scholarship; all the while being thoroughly entertained. Scenes like the death of Pompey, the mention of Caesar's pride, his 10th Legion, Cleopatra's references to Caesar's writings ""Commentarii"", Cleopatra's grand entrance into Rome with her son, Caesarian, the naval battle at Actium between Antony and Octavian, are all rich with generally accurate historical facts.

I love the great costumes and actors, Landau as Rufio has always been a favorite.  Its one of those movies that while you cannot take as historical in every way, you can take for what it truly is and that is a love story that is so great that it has survived more than two thousand years.

I have seen every version of Cleopatra, I love that she was a woman who was in control of her destiny when most women were pawns in a man's game.  Elizabeth Taylor for so many reasons is an actress that I love.  Rex Harrison as Julius and even Richard's Marc Antony was great.

My favorite scene is the one that I referenced and if you are a true fan of this movie you will know which one I mean.

1852549,5,B00008MOUP,"I'm not ashamed to admit I love this film and always have--even though at times I have been teased, ridiculed and even insulted for it. It came out when I was a highschool freshman, and I instantly fell in love with Liz. That's one place to start in considering this movie: at the time it was made, Liz (as Elizabeth Taylor was known in all the media) was at the absolute peak of her luscious physical perfection. It is entirely possible that there has never been a more gorgeous creature on two legs on the face of the earth. The fact that she looks stunning in such extreme makeup and headdresses says a lot. Then there's the impeccable credentials of the writer/director, Joseph L. Mankeiwicz, who had won Oscars for writing and directing two years in a row (A Letter to Three Wives, 1949; and All About Eve, 1950). While there is no denying the eye-popping visuals of this film--the costumes, the sets, the action sequences, and (of course) Liz Taylor in her prime--it has a literary and witty screenplay that seldom is given the credit it deserves. One example: When Cleopatra compliments Marc Antony on his Greek-style garb aboard her barge, he explains, ""I have a fondness for almost all Greek things,"" to which she retorts, ""Being an almost all-Greek thing, I am flattered,"" a reference to the historical Cleopatra's lineage. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won four. Contrary to popular belief, it did NOT lose money, even though it was the most expensive film made up to that time (and, if you adjust for inflation, of all time). When it opened in the original reserved-seat roadshow run, it was sold out for four solid months. The New York Times gave it a glowing review.

So why is it thought of by many as a flop? The major problem was with the advance hype the movie generated, a phenomenon that has never been matched. When Fox advertised it with the slogan, ""The motion picture the world has been waiting for,"" that was no idle hype. The movie was literally years in the making, for most of which time you couldn't pass a magazine rack without seeing at least a half-dozen publications with Liz and Burton on the cover. Their adulterous affair (both were married, he to Sybil, she to Eddie Fisher) during the filmmaking process made headlines and marked the true birth of the paparazzi in Italy, where it was filmed. It even earned a condemning editorial in the Vatican newspaper (although not, as sometimes reported, by the Pope himself). The film was parodied on prime-time television even before it opened. As a result, many people were just waiting for a chance to pounce on it, eager to denounce it as a flop, regardless of how it turned out.

Cleopatra also suffered because of its great length. It is reported that Mankeiwicz wanted to edit it as two three-hour films, but that Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck would not permit it, resulting in a film that ran slightly over four hours--for a few weeks, at least. It debuted in New York at four hours and six minutes; by the time it opened elsewhere, it had been trimmed by 22 minutes. And as its first run continued for the following months, it got progressively shorter as exhibitors whittled it down to allow for more showings per day. I went to see it four times during its first run, and each time after the first would realize that more scenes were missing.

This DVD release, like the original VHS release (and first telecast), restores the film to its original premiere running time of  246 minutes, including scenes that moviegoers outside of New York never got to see in the theater. The original three-disc DVD version (apparently available now only through used DVD outlets) included an outstanding AMC-produced documentary on the incredible history of this film, which is well worth seeking out. But the film really speaks for itself. Divorced from the hype and scandal and rumors, it stands up very well on its own. I have shown it to numerous younger viewers who have never seen it, and they are without exception delighted by it. The performances are uniformly strong (especially Rex Harrison and Roddy McDowall), the production values unexcelled, and the technical transfer is stunning in both video and audio (Alex North's exquisite score is among the films greatest assets).

1852551,4,B00008MOUP,"Taylor stole the spotlight from Cleopatra; she was grander in her own person than she was on screen as someone else... It isn't big or intelligent or daring enough, but her interpretation of the Empress is not without some charm and some fire...

Mankiewicz shaped the characterization to suit her... The movie follows her from the father-daughter romance with Caesar to the tempestuous man-woman contretemps with Marc Antony...

The forty-million-dollar epic is constructed as a series of views of the Taylor woman complaining and making her way into Caesar's bed, to ruler of the world, and to the human being who was too much for Marc Anthony...

Taylor is much better in the first part... As the cunning, nubile daughter to Caesar's wise father, she's quite pleasing... She can handle the sardonic cracks and the little girl petulance... Though, of course, Rex Harrison's courtly insouciance helps to shape her own performance...

She's expected to do much more acting as the womanly, passion-driven Queen, but she's more in control of the character when she's playing Caesar's pupil rather than Marc Anthony's teacher... Her high comedy exchanges with Harrison have quiet authority; her doomed romance with Burton never ignites...",1166832000,,1235,5.253807106598985
1852552,4,B00008MOUP,"Just finished watching this movie and I thought it was okay and I would of enjoyed it more if it wasn't four hours long! The one thing that I caught attention of was the supporting cast that included Roddy McDowell, Martin Landau, Carroll O' Connor, and Hume Cronyn. The third disc features the 2000 documentary that was shown on AMC called ""The Film That Changed Hollywood"" and this piece, running at the two hour mark, is more intriging than the movie itself. In it, narrator Robert Culp (of ""I Spy"" fame) explains why it changed Hollywood and the reason was that it started the big budgeted movie that you see today and the movies' power shifted from the studios to the stars. But some of the film historians that were interviewed in this doc think ""Cleopatra"" goes beyond Hollywood; they think the movie started the pop culture explosion that occured for the rest of the 60's as well as sex and sex appeal in the media (in my opinion, I think it was a rebellion, not a revolution and I blame the media for that). There's vintage footage including from ""The Tonight Show"" the day the movie opened when they did the show live and in the middle of the day to get a jump on the activites. Bert Parks interviewed the stars that came in (I felt my heart sink when I saw Johnny Carson not because that he's dead but he was like my grandfather: I never knew him very much). For those who want to buy the movie must watch this documentary first to understand how flawed this movie was. Flop or all-not losted movie? You be the judge.",1158969600,,1528,4.421985815602837
1852553,2,B00008MOUP,"i learned in film school that in film, the camera tells the story, it's a visual medium.  however the script is king in THIS film, and that is the main problem of 'cleopatra'.  mankiewicz's script is so overloaded with exposition and talking that, after 4 hours, nothing stands out.  the camera barely moves, it's like watching a filmed stage play.  the battles, the action scenes, the  few love scenes are lost amongst the excessive talk, which swallows up everything!  it's almost impossible to watch this film in one viewing and digest it.  and it's a shame that the world's most beautiful woman at the time (taylor)-- in what should have been perfect casting-- has to play cleo as a screaming, bitchy harpy instead of the charming seductress of legend, but that's how the part is written.

cleo's relationships with caesar and antony consists mainly of loud arguments (each pairing has at least 5 arguments). cleo comes off  as being highly negative and aggressive until she gets what she wants, which is a fatal flaw in this film. cleo yells, browbeats, demeans, and armtwists caesar and (especially) antony into submission--- the two most powerful warriors of the roman empire!!!  she emasculates these men.  yet we are asked to believe these men fall head over heels in love with her anyway. mankiewicz relys solely on taylor's great beauty to relay this plot point, because his cleo as written is a [...].

compare this with demille's 1934 version with claudette colbert, who plays her cleo with charm, intelligence, and cunning (ancient historians describe the real cleo this way)... the storyline in that film may be simpler, but the camerawork is fluid and stunning--- all in all the film has a much smoother pace, created a great mood, and is a much better film.  this film in comparison is quite clunky. there are far too many unnecessary scenes in this 1963 version, they could have been cut, they don't move the story along. we can see caesar's wit or antony's melancholy once or twice, not twenty times.

the film's extreme length taxes the talents of all involved, on both sides of the camera. alex north's unconventional, offbeat score becomes grating in spots after four hours. the same can be noted of taylor's costumes, designed by irene sharaff. the sheer number of costumes needed for taylor must have drove sharaff crazy considering the time constraints she had to work under (she joined the production in progress). there's some really great costumes in the beginning, then some memorable ones mixed in with uninspired ones, and toward the end it's the same design over and over in different colors---and a few downright ridiculous wigs & headresses thrown in (one scene that comes to mind is a closeup of taylor busy emasculating burton at the top of her lungs while a golden christmas-tree ornament of a headress jiggles atop her head).

it's obvious that this film had no time for preproduction planning or storyboarding to achieve a nice flow. perhaps mankiewicz should have worked within the parameter of the existing script when he took over filming, not rewrite the whole thing fom scratch himself.

taylor riding into rome on that golden sphinx is the only truly spectacular scene in the whole 4 hour movie. cleo's fullsize barge is barely used. the same is true of the ships in the battle scenes... you realize these are full scale boats but they're not used to any great advantage in the movie--- models could have done the trick.

the acting however, is uniformly well done. although burton is a little scrawny as antony, he has a few good acting passages--- but antony is written as a whiny loser from the beginning, with no chance given him to match up to caesar in cleo's eyes. cleo clearly wears the pants in that relationship. harrison has always gotten the best reviews for his performance in this film, but then his part is the best written.

one wonders what the original film would have been like had fate not stepped in.... peter finch as caesar, stephen boyd (messala from the 1959 'ben hur') as marc antony, oliver messel designing both sets and costumes (you can see taylor in some of these costumes on the internet...less polished, more primitive looking.  messel dressed vivien leigh as cleo in 'caesar and cleopatra' in 1945) and directed by rouben mamoulian who was a great visual stylist. to end on a positive note, the millions of dollars spent can be seen on the screen.",1154390400,,4426,4.83841059602649
1852554,3,B00008MOUP,"Here is a film more famous for what went on behind the camera than before it.  Nearly bankrupting 20th Century Fox, which would not recoup the losses from this debacle until the box office receipts from ""Planet of the Apes"" would be tabulated nearly four years later, ""Cleopatra"" (1963), clealy demonstrated all that was inherently wrong with Hollywood--even over 40 years ago.

On a technical scale, the film is a remarkable achievement; one merely needs to only look at the quality of workmanship of the numerous Roman and Egyptian sets employed throughout the film long before the words ""computer animation"" or ""computer imaging"" ever entered our lexicon.

More than a portent to the end of the so-called ""historical epic"" (Anthony Mann's ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,"" made in 1964, would be the last real historical epic made for some time), ""Cleopatra"" faced problems from the start including Ms. Taylor's countless ""illnesses"" to an emergency tracheotomy and to a number of romps with Burton in her trailer (she was married to Eddie Fisher at the time) which cost 20th Century hundreds of thousands of dollars in costly delays running the picture seriously overbudget.  Let alone her 1 million dollar salary for the role and her ability to fire or hire directors at will didn't help either--concessions made to an alledged ""star"" that were considered risky and ill-advised.

Incidentally, after the initial director, Roberto Mamoulian would bow out of the movie, George Stevens was considered a replacement, but he was committed to the biblical epic, ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" and was unavailable.  The director's job then went to Joe Mankiewicz who completed the picture.

The picture showcases some fine acting by several of the leads, particularly Burton and Harrison.  Burton, no stranger to roles dedicated to characters larger than life, like Alexander the Great and Thomas Becket, plays Antony with all the gusto he can muster and with his theatrical roots revealing Antony's Shakespearean origins.

Harrison too, not unfamiliar to playing great men, from Pope Julius II who inspired and bullied Micahelangelo in ""The Agony and the Ecstacy"" and as whimsical Professor Higgins in ""My Fair Lady"" would get top billing the following year for these pictures. Even Martin Landau as Rufio, Antony's able and loyal lieutenant, demonstrates his tremendous range that would earn him an Academy Award two decades later. His commentary, along with that of Tom Mankiewicz offers a revealing and informative inside look into the making of this film.  Landau is a great storyteller; it's a shame his commentary lasts approximately only 45 mins. He really shares some revealing insights into the mammoth task it was to coordinate this film.

Sadly, Liz Taylor, perhaps the most overrated actress of all time, comes off sounding more like a fishwife from London's Eastend rather than the Egypt's Queen of the Nile, nagging her paramour to choose either her love or an empire.

Clealry, Taylor seemed more suited to roles that would distinguish her later collaborations with Burton; for example, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and ""Divorce His, Divorce Hers."" No doubt the multitude of costume changes in ""Cleopatra"" kept the audience distracted from Ms. Taylor's apparent lack of range for this role.

Some of the elements in the film are impressive--like an ancient Roman Bacchanalian rite, it is a visual feast for the senses replete with a full-scale Roman Forum (despite a historical innaccuracy depicting the Arch of Constantine that would not be built over 300 years later), with the Battle of Actium nicely depicted as is Cleopatra's triumphant entry into Rome, but the rest feels and sounds like a melodramatic soap opera of a couple who cannot conquer the obstacles in their relationship, much less a world.

Funny, not much has changed 2500 years later....",1153267200,,3881,5.159235668789809
1852555,5,B00008MOUP,"This book isn't a history or academic work. In fact, it's a picture book designed for children ages 7 and up. However, that should not suggest that it's not worth a read even for adults as an introduction to the life and times of Cleopatra, Antony, and the fall of the Roman Republic. The author presents a detailed, fact-based account of the queen's life, including pertinent and amazingly helpful references and quotations from Plutarch's histories. No fictional flourishes were added to richen the story, and though sometimes opinion slips in in a description of a descision or event, the story is very unassuming and true to historical evidence and generally accepted fact.

So, as a short academic text, this book lays out the basics of her life (her marriage and civil war with her brother Ptolemy, wishes for an empire combinging East and West, affairs and marriages to Caesar and Antony, defeat at Actium and suicide in Alexandria,) in an inviting, exciting manner. But, in this case, its more important role is as a picture book, a role that it magnificently fills and excels in. Stanley's illustrations are beautiful and lavish, scenes of the beautiful queen and the people of her life set among breathtaking scenery such as the Alexandrian palace and harbor, the streets of Rome, and flowing sea. One particular favorite of mine is the illustration of Cleopatra's vessel as she approaches Antony's encampment at Tarsus, in which she sits reclining, dressed as Venus, in all of her splendor upon the magnificent boat and splendid sea.

For the fledgling historian (particularly a child interested in history) this book is a must.

1852557,4,B00008MOUP,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time but I don't know why.  I think it is because EVERYONE in this movie overacts and I am a thespian fan.  The scene when Rex (Caesar) visits Cleopatra during her bath is the worst of all.. yet I watch it like one views a horrific trainwreck; it's so bad that you CAN'T not watch.

Richard Burton makes no sense being in this movie.  It is a 2 CD set and he is appears more frequently in the 2nd CD, which is why I rarely watch it.  Overacting most times, not acting the other times, acting drunk all the time. Sean Connery would have made a FANTASTIC Antony

Elizabeth, her hair and her wardrobe are gorgeous except for the do she sports during her boat party...she looks more like Cleopatra's mother than Cleopatra.  Most of her dresses accentuate her cleavage, which temporarily distracts you from her bad acting. During her coronation ceremony she is absolutely stunning.

My favorite part is her triumphant ride into Rome (although I don't think she ever visited Rome; I'm reading her ""memoirs"" which said she did but maybe I'm wrong).  She really sticks it to the smug Roman aristocracy riding in on that statue which takes up the entire gate when it passes through it.

Elizabeth is kinda pale for the role.  My husband thinks she's fat which I resent because most men think that if you aren't built like a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model then you are a fat pig.  She's very voluptuous although part of me wishes she had done some pushups as her lack of triceps is awfully frightening.

The romance between Elizabeth and Rex is not believable.  When they kiss it looks so uncomfortable.  Maybe Rex was worried the semi-sober Richard was going to explode if it looked too real.  If I HAD to choose between Richard and Rex...ack, OK, Rex.

But, the plot and scenery and cinematography more than make up for the lapses in acting.  There is one thing I cannot figure out...what is it that thing that sits on the head of Cleopatra's private soothsayer?  Is it animal, mineral, vegetable?  Is it her hair?",1145318400,,2050,4.564383561643836

A quote from Life magazine in 1963, when this movie hit the screen. I couldn't agree more.

This movie, this epic, is truely one of the most beautiful eye candy I have ever seen.

The sets and locations are truely jaw dropping. They are so fine of quality and rich of colour that you can't believe what you are seeying.

Then there are other things that make this movie worthwhile:

The acting: Elizabeth Taylor is beautiful, stunning and powerfull in this movie. She acts as the best and portrais Cleopatra in a way only she could. The next time you hear someone talk about Cleopatra after seeying this film, you will have the image of Taylor as Cleopatra in your mind.

Richard Burton as the warrior Marc Antonius is a perfect choice and he plays the roll with such great acting, that he is totally believable. The third star is Rex Harrison as Julius Ceasar. He does it fantastic with his way of acting.

Cleopatra is one of those movies thas is purely a classic and has everything you demand of a historical epic. It has a few major battle sequences, but is mostly focused on the drama. Long dialouge scenes that really give the actors a chance to show what they got.

If you like movies like: ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Ben Hur"" , ""Spartacus"", ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and all those other classics around that era of film making, you must see this!

The sets are massive, and the Cinemascope takes full advantage of their terrifyingly huge scale: the characters are sometimes photographed to look especially diminutive within them so you can hardly distinguish them from one another. Naturally this does allow for amazing moments of spectacle, and the movie is worth seeing just for the jawdropping excess of such scenes as Cleopatra's spectacular entrance into Rome to visit the father of her child Caesarion. Yet everything in the film is so overscaled that it encourages the actors to do the same with their performances, and everyone is always shouting at one another across grand piazzas and up giant staircases. Rex Harrison (as Caesar) and Roddy MacDowell (as Octavian) fare the best, since their characters best alllow for such posturing, but both Taylor and Richard Burton (whose romance with one another made this film's production an international sensation) find their performances cheapened by the melodramatics. Burton was never at his best when delivering his lines at the top of his lungs, and Taylor started with this performance to give vent to her over-the-top tendencies in a way that only found an admirable outlet once afterwards, in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF. Here she seems to be shrieking at everyone within range of her excruciating voice (moreover, this is the first film where she seems pudgy and out-of-shape).",1139616000,,1614,5.16412213740458

And....Oh! My! Gawd! She DID open her mouth! And I thought, what is that NOISE coming out of her? That's her voice??!! It pretty much stopped everything in the rest of the movie from the point of first hearing her voice (too bad this was a talkie) and I never got the gist of history.

I am hooked on the HBO version of Rome and tried to watch Cleopatra just recently to get ahead of HBO's series so I'd know what's going on. I fell asleep. Liz wasn't 36 in this movie (she was born in 1932), but too short, fat, dumpy,white and old to play the part all right. I did not even find her particularly sexual. Sexy looking yes, but not sexual.

 Everyone WAS miscast in this movie, especially Dickie Burton who never looked like he enjoyed one single day of his miserable life and who wouldn't have had a career without Liz and he knew it. Therefore he hit the bottle real hard. Wasted life! i didn't think Rex Harrison was cast correctly as Caeser. Too British, too Broadway. I kept expecting him to break into a show tune. The rain in Spain or something to that effect....?

1852584,1,B00008MOUP,"ATTENTION! If you love Liz Taylor, just because you love her, or whatever, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. The same applies if you love 60's genre movies that you regard as ""Classics"".

My ""reviews"" are tongue in cheek.......I think Elizabeth Taylor was once one the most beautiful women in the world. She did not deserve the Oscar for ""Butterfield 8"" (she said so HERSELF), but she did derserve it for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and a few other movies, too. She's NOT a ""terrible actress"". That would be J.LO. Liz is a legend, it's a fact, so please, take this HUMOR (albiet dark humor) review with a grain of salt, OK? And please, I am a PUBLISHED HUMOR WRITER! I ""wrote"" this review after sending it in e mail form to several friends. They ALL said I should post it on Amazon. LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT THERE ARE NASTY MINDED PEOPLE WHO THINK I AM MEAN, and took every word I wrote LITERALLY! People, PLEASE!!!!!I'm not mean! And by the by, who-EVER thought this movie deserves FIVE STARS does (and I am not kidding) belongs in a loony bin. It's really pretty bad, and that's no joke!

Look at the HBO series ""ROME"" if you want to see what it was REALLY LIKE, and note to a certain OTHER ""REVIEWER"", read your HISTORY. CLEOPATRA NEVER SET FOOT IN ROME. EVER. And Octavian (later Augustus Caesar, the FIRST Ruler of Rome) ruled Rome for over FOUR DECADES, and he wasn't a silly swishy mealy mouthed jerk as he is portrayed in this movie. He was clever, wise, and he was a FINE RULER OF ROME, and he took NO PLEASURE in the fact that Marc Antony choose to fight him. And he NEVER GOT SEASICK and said ""Wah"", I don't like to fight SEA BATTLES"". That part of this movie DID make me angry, as it was COMPLETELY HISTORICALLY INACCURATE. ELIZABETH TAYLOR WAS TOO OLD TO PLAY CLEOPATRA. Cleopatra was a YOUNG, GREEK TEENAGER who wasn't that pretty. OK? OK!
Well, if you want to know ANYTHING about Roman History, Egyptian History, Greek History, do NOT watch this movie. Actually, there are MANY reasons not to watch this movie, the first reason being, it's TERRIBLE.

Made in the early sixties, this movie created SUCH a buzz!
I don't remember what I thought about it then. (I was pretty young..like, too young to be watching this movie)....

So, when Turner Movie Classics decided to show this movie in UNCUT form, (it was three hours, uncut, it was four and a half hours, two hours would have been sufficient with this cast and script).......my husband and I were caught unaware that we were about to watch ONE OF THE STUPIDEST MOVIES EVER MADE.
And we watched the WHOLE THING

The cast is stellar, but they are almost ALL miscast!

Eddie Fisher, one of Liz's many husbands, was promised a role as a Palm Tree, and he took it. He did a GREAT JOB!

So, filming began in London, directors were hired and fired, and here's a thought, WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT TO FILM A MOVIE ABOUT ROME OR EGYPT, which is SUNNY AND DRY, in LONDON?
Um, isn't it RAINY there? Yes! So production was shut down, Liz got Pneumonia and almost died, held up production, they decided to start again in Rome, and here we go.

Richard Burton was cast as the dashingly handsome Marc Antony, beloved General and most trusted friend of Julius Caesar, played by ""My Fair Lady's"" Rex Harrison, who, after reading the script, pronounced ""I can read sh**ty dialog with the best of them,"" plus, he needed the dough.

Not to sound like an idiot, but duh, ELIZABETH TAYLOR, who was thirty-six years old, was cast as the nubile young temptress, Cleopatra. OK. That's just wrong right there. Liz was too old, I don't care how ""pretty her face was"". Thirty-six is NOT old, it was just WAY too old to play Cleopatra, who was about 14 years old. Cleopatra was Greek actually, olive skinned, and not particularly beautiful, but quite wily and smart and had a way with sexual things that I wish she had passed down!

So, Caesar is in Egypt, because, he has fought a seven year civil war against Pompey Magnus, and also, Caesar needs Egyptian stuff, like all their gold, and wheat, and gildings and marble and granite, and all their stuff, and I mean, ALL of it!!! Every bit! Cleopatra had already had her brother killed, but in the movie, it makes it seem like her snotty brother is still around and trying to kill Cleopatra. He is played by some guy who I am sure is residing on the ""where are they now list"", and all he said was, ""I don't LIKE my sister! I want to be King. Give me the Kingdom, I want to be King. Hmmph!"" Really. He said that. While wearing a giant Egypt type headpiece that had a golden snake that went almost in between his eyes that made him look like a cross eyed idiot. Which I think he was.

So, taking a bit from history and a bit from Shakespeare and a bit from various Villiage Idiots, the Script has that puffed up booze addled Elizabeth Taylor, who was weighing in at about a buck fifty-five then, (you know how Liz has ""battled the buldge)"" brought to Caesar, while he is staying in the Egyptian Palace, and she has herself wrapped up in an Oriental Rug.

I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want the job of carrying that tub of lard in a HEAVY Oriental Carpet, and apparently, no one else did either, because it's clear when the man walks in, ELIZABETH TAYLOR is not in that carpet. If she HAD been it would be like an Anaconda after it eats a sheep or something. YOU'D HAVE SEEN HER.

So, fiction continues, and out rolls Liz, and rolls and rolls, with her Cleopatra wig on and a DRESS THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FOR THE 1961 PROM, because correct me if I am WRONG, but didn't women back then wear robes and gowns that were gauzy and flowing, and had empire waists, or one shouldered outfits? Look at the history books! They didn't WEAR GIRDLES, and nipped in the waist gowns, but then again, they WEREN'T Elizabeth Taylor, who needed a GIRDLE really BADLY!

Her fat white arms distracted me as much as her NASAL and IRRITATING VOICE, and she never SHUT HER MOUTH. Elizabeth Taylor is NOT a great actress. She COULD be good, but not in this movie. The end. Richard Burton always said that about her, and he was right.

So, Rex Harrison, as Caesar, looks at Cleopatra, and exclaims how BEAUTIFUL she is (that was written in Liz's contract, she HAD to be called beautiful at least seventeen times OR ELSE)......and HOW YOUNG she is. OK. At WHOM is he looking? The ONLY person I think would be qualified to play Cleopatra now would be a young ""Prince,"" but not be funky. Really. Cleopatra was tiny and dark and kind of average looking but had kinky sex tricks that just made men weak in the knees, and all that.

In one bit of hilarious dialogue, Rex Harrison is talking about the great Alexander (the one played by Colin Farrell in that GOD AWFUL MOVIE), and saying ""Alexander was YOUNG when he started his campaigns, and you are even younger! You are but a girl!""
No she's not! She's a thirty-six year old somewhat tubby temptress who peaked at age thirty-two and has rolls of flab on her belly. THAT would be like telling Phyllis Diller she looked like Britney Spears!

Anyway, Cleopatra's Brother is killed, Cleo gets to be queen, she has sex with Caesar, as Caesar is married to the barren and ugly Calpernia, who is back in Rome, and SO IT'S SAID that Cleo bore him a ""MALE CHILD,"" which, as we all know, is WAY better than a ""FEMALE CHILD.""

Caesar returns to Rome, but not before fighting for TWO YEARS in various places and conquering pesky people who do NOT want to be part of Rome, and when he comes back, he declares he wants to be Emperor of Rome, and Brutus and Cassius and the gang at the Senate don't like that, so they stab him to death in the Senate Halls, and scurry away, because people of Rome DO NOT like that they did that.

So, Marc Antony starts to hunt them all down, and meanders around Cleopatra's way, and BOOM! He falls for her RIGHT AWAY! He ALSO needed Egypt's money and Ports and grain and you name it, but he was REALLY SMITTEN with Cleo!

Back home in Rome, Octavian (Julius Caesar's great Nephew, and later, his ADOPTED SON) is appointed as part of the Triumvirate of Rome, which includes Marc Antony, Octavian (later to become Augustus Caesar, one of the BEST and GREATEST Rulers of Rome) who is played by, get this, RODDY MCDOWELL, of ""Lassie Come Home"" and ""National Velvet"" fame. PROBABLY the worst bit of casting, as they make Octavian to be a simpy, girlish, mean spirited know-nothing. WRONG.  Carroll O'Conner was cast as a ROMAN SENATOR (I think I heard him mutter ""meathead"" as he stabbed Julius Caesar).............and Martin Landau as a Centurion, which, I guess I can KIND OF imagine, MAYBE, and HUME CRONYN as an EGYPTIAN GUY who is close to Cleopatra. HUME CRONYN? EGYPTIAN? WHAT?

So, when Antony sees Cleopatra again, after he had returned from Rome to marry Octavian's sister, Octavia, for Political reasons, Richard Burton has to look at Elizabeth Taylor and say ""Eet has bean three YEAHS, how is it possible that you are even MORE beauteeful than BEFOH""?
Point: It isn't.

Great scene: Marc Antony walks up when Cleopatra is taking a bath in a giant tub, with CHLORINE in it to hide her FLAB, and she has TOY ships in the tub (think Francis in ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure)....and remarks on her incredible beauty once again, because it's in the script, and he wants to say his lines really fast because he needs a drink.

My husband said that Richard Burton spoke in Staccato bursts....how can I write this? Like this perhaps: Burton:""YOUhaveNOTgivenmeREAsonTOSTAYHENCEImustgo."" Like that.
IN the giant scene where Cleopatra enters Rome with her son, WHICH NEVER HAPPENED she has a fine show............she arrives on a mini-Pyramid with her son at her side, and the only black people in this whole movie were ""fine Nubian Warriors and Dancing Maidens"", who kind of looked like they were doing the Funky Chicken in the wrong time period costumes........and strictly for the white people's amazement and entertainment.

They had one or two pathetic ""battle"" scenes, and I swear, we were laughing SO HARD as that drunken stick armed Richard Burton tried to pretend he could SWORD FIGHT, it was like he grabbed a play sword and was going ""Wheeeeeeeeeeahhhhhhh!"" Ummph"" ""Weeeyahhhhhh!"".....like a little kid pretending he could do something, and of course, great big guys had to throw themSELVES backwards as if the great Marc Antony had actually HIT them................

As we grew giddier, every time Richard Burton walked in the room, all we said was ""I need a drink,"" or, ""Perhaps we should settle this over a drink,"" or ""I had too much to drink last night, perhaps another drink would help.""

As he CRAWLED over a fake boat side, (the crew of the movie had lifted a STUNT GUY, I am SURE, seen only from the back, on this trapeze like thing, to get him from one boat to the other, as Richard Burton, had he done it himself, would surely have lost his grip and fallen and broken his NECK.)  Then, they would pan to Richard Burton climbing on board, and the lack of MUSCLE TONE and his HIDEOUS WHITE SKIN were hilarious.
We were DYING from giddy laughter by then.

Plus, after her Cleopatra wig scenes, Elizabeth Taylor wore her hair in a SIXTIES STYLE for a while, which was, IMPOSSIBLE, because Romans AND Greeks and Egyptians either shaved their heads and wore wigs, or wore a cap over their hair and wore wigs.
Her VOICE! It was so annoying I don't wonder why the man took to drink even more!

Some of her ""Handmaidens"" were NATURAL BLONDS with BEEHIVE hairdos, and we all know how COMMON that look was in EGYPT.

And blah blah blah, as history DOES tell us, Marc Antony DID ally himself with Alexandria in Egypt, and Octavian had NO choice but to go and KICK MARC ANTONY'S ASS, which he did, but Antony was so ashamed he fell on his sword, as she should have, but in the movie, he falls on his sword in CLEOPATRA'S PALACE, which he wasn't IN, during the BATTLE ON THE SEA, and we both said (my husband and I) ""OH THANK GOD he is DEAD and will NOW SHUT THE HELL UP"". Oh, but he wasn't dead! He ""fell on his sword"" in a place on his body where I guess there are HARDLY ANY ORGANS OR BLOOD VESSELS, so he could CONTINUE to blather to Cleopatra about I FU**ING DO NOT KNOW WHAT, and if you had a GUN to my head I would not be able to tell you. It was DRIVEL! And we were like...............you know, ""The English Patient""...........we were screaming ""JUST DIE! DIE ALREADY! SHUT UP AND DIE!!!!!!!!!"" And fifteen minutes more of blathering and he did die, and then SHE got to die, along with her sixties hairdo handmaidens, when she picked up a snake in a bowl of figs (I'm SURE while doing the scene she managed to eat about ten figs because she was always starving and wanting chicken or something).............and blathered and blathered and then, THANK GOD for that ASP (it looked like a harmless GARTER SNAKE, which I am sure it was), when it slithered away, but MERCIFULLY FOR US, it killed her quite quickly. In truth, it would have taken about FIFTY deadly ASPS to kill that loud mouthed overrated chunky woman with a pretty face who was pushing forty.
If Time Travelers from the past came back and saw that movie, they would slaughter the human race.
Oh, and the cost of the movie, while IT DID WELL AT THE BOX OFFICE GOD KNOWS WHY, didn't recoup what it actually cost to make the movie, SUNK the Production Company, and signaled the end, of the ""Sand and Sandals"" movies for another thirty-eight years, until ""Gladiator"" reclaimed the genre.
And then, other studios had to make ""TROY"" which sucked, and ""Alexander"" which sucked more, and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" which really sucked, so maybe, we won't be seeing epics like ""Cleopatra"" for a good long time. And I think that might be a GOOD THING..............and wait!
ELIZABETH TAYLOR LIVES ON YET! Richard Burton is dead, Rex Harrison is dead, Hume Cronyn is dead, Roddy McDowell is dead, Martin Landau is dead, Carroll O'Conner is dead....................hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm? A DEAL perhaps? We'll never know! People, READ YOUR HISTORY! They got a lot RIGHT in this movie, regarding time periods and names. The portrayals of famous people in history were horrible, and they took WAY TOO much artistic (if you want to call it that) liscence here. Trust me.",1127347200,,14243,4.526049766718507
1852585,2,B00008MOUP,"Cleopatra was supposed to be a blockbuster in 1963. Costing over $40 million it was the most expensive film of its time. Unfortunately the almost four and a half hour-film (Originally planned to be six hours was one of the biggest flops in movie history. Studio executives thought bigger would be better. However, the excessively lavish sets and elaborate costumes of this big budget movie can't make up for a boring screenplay and terrible acting. The saddest part of watching this 45-year-old disaster is that Hollywood hasn't learned anything from the failure of this movie. People like Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich still try to make movies this way with the same disastrous results.

The main reason why Cleopatra fails is because of its script. It takes too long to get the story started and does not flow very well slowing the films pacing to a crawl. We don't see Cleopatra until a good half hour to forty five minutes pass. I thought I was watching the History of the Roman Empire, not a story on ancient Egypt. Without a solid foundation established by the screenplay the entire film collapses under the weight of the elaborate costumes and sets. In Cleopatra they're the distracting equivalent of CGI today. They add nothing to the story and don't advance the plot. But they're just so pretty. Quite a few frames belonged on the cutting room floor. They say the four and a half-hour version was a butchered version, IMO, it needed a LOT more editing.

Elizabeth Taylor is horrible as Cleopatra. It's one of the worst performances of her great career. I didn't even think I was watching the same legendary Oscar winning actress who blew me away in Butterfeild 8 and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. If the film weren't over 40 years old I'd swear I was watching Jennifer Lopez. That's who Taylor's portrayal of Cleopatra reminded me of, J-Lo, a no talent who can't act or sing but makes the papers because of the way she works her assets. Richard Burton is phoning it in here. His performance reminds me of J-Lo's wooden ex fianc Ben Affleck. Most of the other actors try to overcome the script, but without a story to work with all hope is lost.

If you want to see the legendary Elizabeth Taylor truly perform, skip this train wreck and get one of her great films like Cat on A Hot Tin Roof, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Butterfeild 8, or National Velvet.",1126483200,,2381,4.65083135391924
1852586,2,B00008MOUP,"I saw this long festival of elaborate sets, costumes, and gratuitous marching scenes last night on PBS for the first time in years since I was a child.  What was I thinking as a little girl to have liked this so much?  Now I remember:  It reminded me of an Egyptian themed restaurant in my area, so it was definitely the costumes and sets.

Without a doubt, this is a one star spectacle that is boring once Rex Harrison's Ceasar is stabbed to death.  In fact, Harrison's performance is the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars.  After that I lost interest.  Elizabeth Taylor is one of the most overrated actresses in the world, and Richard Burton wasn't so hot either.  Burton had the same expression on his face throughout the entire epic--like he had to go potty for two days, and there was still no privacy to be found.  Taylor's costumes were much sleazier than I recalled, and the wardrobe department seemed to delight in making sure they could concentrate on her boobs as much as possible--as if that was really going to distract anyone from how sickening her weak voiced screaming and tantrum throwing was.  In fact, her performance reminded me of Susan Lucci in one of her awful TV movies.

Too bad this movie is hailed as a cinematic classic by some old fools who think it should be just because it was BIG and released before 1970 (yes, we all know that everything released after 1970 sucks, right?  Wink, wink.).  It's not.  The sets aren't even good, although the use of color compensates for that a bit, and I can only imagine a lot of Taylor's costumes gave the censors of that time fits.  For the life of me, I never understood that woman's appeal; she has all the sensual aires of a dead bee on a sidewalk, but at least she was better in other movies.  There were lots of bad flicks released before 1970 just as well as there were good ones released after, and Cleopatra is definitely one of the huge stinkers of the 60s.  There are lots of riding to war scenes.  Too many.  Most laughable is that huge procession when Cleo and Ceasar's son blow into Rome with that huge parade before their equally overblown entrance.  There were so many people in that scene alone, I wondered who'd seen this film in 1963 that WASN'T in it!  For God's sake, I kept looking in the crowd for somebody I might have once known in my neighborhood!  For me, that scene alone was the very key to what this movie was all about:  a grandly expensive, yet rather cheap looking spectacle to the eye that was supposed to divert your attention from the fact that this movie had a lousy script, bad acting (except for Rex, of course), and was centered around catering to Taylor's overblown vanity.  She already thought she was queen before they gave her this turkey.  There would only have been one worse choice for this role, and that would have been Anne Baxter, who singlehandedly ruined every scene she was in ten years earlier in Ten Commandments.  If you have insomnia, watch Cleopatra; something tells me once they kill Rex off, you'll be snoring like a hibernating bear.",1124582400,,3064,4.525454545454545

It has actual sets built out of marble and the locations where authentic and breathtaking and so were the costumes LaTaylor wore.  But the real story was the torrid love affair between Liz, who was married to Eddie Fisher at the time and Dick, who was married to some English actress.  It was quite the scandal at the time.  I remember the fan mag ""Silver Screen"" I was about 12 or 13 at the time had pictures of Liz & Dick kissing on the Italian Riviera (I thought that was shocking at the time).  Although I never thought Liz was a fab actress I always thought she was very beautiful so enjoy the movie for what it is, not historic but Hollywood historic.",1123027200,,745,4.292857142857143
1852598,4,B00008MOUP,"I disagree with one of the previous reviewers who said that Richard Burton appeared as though he were ""loaded"" throughout this movie. I think that Richard was on his mark when speaking his dialogue, and his mannerisms were believable.

I only gave 4 (actually 4 1/2) stars for this movie because I think there were times when the story was dull and the acting was over-done. Granted, this is an epic story, and in some sense there would be a lot of drama purely because of the subject matter. But I believe that the film felt ""heavy"" because of the dreary and scheaming characters, along with the staggeringly long length of the film. Let's face it, a person can only sit for just so long and watch people being killed non-stop.

I will say, however, that the sets on this movie were magnificient!!!

It is a known fact in Hollywood that the making of Cleopatra almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox. There were so many delays while shooting this movie (Liz Taylor was sick with pneumonia a couple of times, and there were other casting and production problems, etc.) and the budget swelled into an unbelievable $40 million dollars. By 1963 standards, that was a HUGE problem. In light of the money pit that was known as Cleopatra, all movie productions were shut down on the Fox lot except for Cleopatra, and a romantic comedy called ""Something's Got to Give."" That little known movie starred Marilyn Monroe and Dean Martin and was directed by George Cukor. Eventually ""Something's Got To Give"" was remade with the title ""Move Over, Darling"" and starred Doris Day and James Garner.

The executives at Fox believed that their two female megastars (Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe) could propel 20th Century Fox out of the money troubles that were strangling the studio. Cleopatra, though over-budget, was eventually completed. Something's Got to Give, however, wound up in the annuls of Hollywood history as the final and uncompleted film of screen goddess, Marilyn Monroe, who died before the film could be completed.

Anyway, this movie Cleopatra is worth a watch, but just allow a large segment of time.

Liz Taylor did look beautiful in the film, and her acting was pretty good. If you were not thrilled with this movie, and if you are a fan of Liz Taylor, you might prefer Dame Liz in these following movies instead: Raintree County, Butterfield 8, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and Suddenly, Last Summer.

I think that Rex Harrison did a great job in this film, but I always loved him best as Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady.

1852599,5,B00008MOUP,"At 243 minutes, this is one of the longest movies ever made. Nominated for 9 Academy Awards, (including Best Picture) it finally won 4 for its special effects, cinematography, costume design, and  art direction. Impressive sets  and costumes, remarkable styling, large scale epic scenes (such as Cleopatra's spectacular entrance in Rome or the sea battle in Action), thousands extras, excellent cast and, strangely for Hollywood's productions, a very historically accurate  script, based on ancient historians (Plutarch, Suetonius, etc) consist an underrated  masterpiece.

It's the widely known tragic story of Queen of Egypt Cleopatra VII (69-30 BC), the last and probably most famous member of the Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty, that ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC until Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC.  Cleopatra tries to maintain control of her kingdom and satisfy her  ambitions to unite Egypt and Rome in a great empire by having affairs with Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) and later Mark Antony (Richard Burton) after Caesar's assassination. In real life Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton had a passionate affair on the set of this movie and finally became one of the most celebrated couples in Hollywood.

Undoubtedly gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor (in my opinion the best Cleopatra ever on screen) was the ideal choice for the role of Cleopatra, being very close to Plutarch's description: ""...For her actual beauty, it is said, was not in itself so remarkable that none could be compared with her, or that no one could see her without being struck by it, but the contact of her presence, if you lived with her, was irresistible..."" (Plutarch, Lives, Anthony). Richard Burton gives a memorable performance as Mark Antony and Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar simply appears the depth of his great talent. Excellent performances too from Roddy McDowall as ruthless Octavian Caesar Augustus, Hume Cronyn (Sosigenes), Cesare Danova (Apollodorus) and Martin Landau (Rufio).

""Cleopatra"" actually  was an idea of Greek American tycoon, Spyros P. Skouras, Republican Party's leading member and 20th Century Fox's powerful President. His dream was to present the audience a spectacle of unique grandness about the ill-fated last Queen of Egypt Cleopatra, that could compete TV programs, bringing people back to theaters and the success of other  similar epics, (such as MGM's Ben Hur). He also wanted to pay a tribute ""...to the beautiful Greek Queen of Egypt..."" as he stated in an interview. But the movie's astronomical  budget (44.000.000 $!!! in 1963, about 1 billion $ today!!!) caused his fall from Fox's ""throne"". Studio's heads  doubted  that ""Cleopatra"" could ever make back its record production costs and  so they decided to remove him and terminate his long time reign in 20th Century Fox.. But despite Studio's fears it did well in 1963's box office with approx. 60 million $ grosses only in  USA.

Joseph L. Mankiewicz both directed and scripted ""Cleopatra"" brilliantly (although Skouras's friend Ruben Mamoulian was initially hired as director). Irene Sharaff, Vittorio Nino Novarese and Renie  simply deserved the  Oscar they won for best costume design  and Hermes Pan did a splendid work in choreography.",1121472000,,3248,5.257751937984496

I have no words about the movie. It's the best movie of 1962 and I really admire it and don't want to discuss. I bought it for my collection, I'd saw some Dual layer import editions which had very fine Box, print and packaging. Dual layer made in singapore for approximately 15 dollars! I didn't buy that set cause at that time I used to think, import editions are not as good as US edition and don't have collectible value. I bought it made in USA and it completely turned my opinion!
5 star edition of this movie has an Unsusual Silver box which is 1.5 times ticker than an ordinalry DVD keep case! it's plastic quality is terribly low. I bought it brand new, but it originnaly had many wrinkles and the whole box was a little torn cause of low quality of plastic they have used! I returned it and order a new one, It was defected too. I closed my eyes and said well, all of them are same and defected. let's keep it. I opened it. guess what I saw? case had place for only two DVDs. they've put the 3rd disc in a booklet-like paper sleeve whitout any protection. the sleeve couldn't even keep the DVD in it's place. DVD had been removed from it's place during shippment and got terrible scratches. well, what could I do after I saw that? I had removed the shrink wrap and due to rules, they didn't accept to replace it or refund my money!

Stanley's technique is superb, and her medium is gouache.

The history is fascinating and clearly written, and describes the times that Cleopatra lived in as well as what is known about her, which as Staley and Vennema point out, ""Everything we know about Cleopatra was written by her enemies"", and also, though we know what Julius Caesar, Mark Anthony and Octavian looked like, all we have of Cleopatra's image are crudely carved coins, as her statues were destroyed.

That may sound like an odd question given that ""Cleopatra"" runs 4 hours, but despite the lavish sets, clever dialogue, generally good performances, etc... there is nonetheless a certain ""smallness"" about this gargantuan piece of Hollywood history (which, if one adjusts for inflation, remains easily the most-expensive movie ever made).
This ""smallness"" is hard to explain, except that I think it may have something to do with so many scenes occuring inside, with very little external shooting which remains in the final cut.

As I understand, the original version was ~6 hours, which does seem a tad too long, but FOX made Mr. Mankiewicz cut the film down, which he initially did to a length of about 5 hours and 15 minutes... THIS is the version that I'd like to see (but no one's apparently been able to find the footage) but the studio then took it and hacked it down to ""only"" 4 hours in 1963, some prints running less than 3(!!) Elizabeth Taylor is said to have vomited after publicly viewing the slashed-up version in London.

It's also been said that the two stars missing from the 4 hour version (let alone the shorter one) are Rome and Egypt... I can believe it-- as there is a pronounced lack of a sense of ""place"" or location in the 4 hour cut, the version readily available.

If they could reassemble the 5 1/4 hour cut, with that footage back in place, I wonder if the size and scope of ""Cleopatra"" would finally measure up to what it seems to be trying to promise at every moment. Because despite how long it already is, one senses that you've ""missed"" something throughout the movie.",1107820800,,1625,4.612456747404845

The film combines drama, action, and adventure, making it one of the best of its kind.

Needless to say, the Hollywood heavyweights Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, as well as the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  The actors' incredible talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.

The setting, the acting, the dialogues, the music, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!

History, Love, Passion, and Honor, are all about.

1852606,5,B00008MOUP,"Box-office results are hardly a measure of the technical merits of a film: Cleopatra is clear proof of that conclusion. Joseph L. Mankiewicz' direction of this 1963 film was, for the longest time, the biggest flop in Hollywood history until Kevin Costner's ""Waterworld"" (a real flop in every way!) However, when one sees the phenomenal sets and impeccable acting, one begins to wonder why this film had such a bad rap.

 The film failed to attract audiences simply because the genre was fading out of the spotlight after the preceding decades' major successes of ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Ben Hur"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""Spartacus"", etc. ""Cleopatra"" expected to ride on the wave of success as the latter did but simply found itself at low tide. So much money had been spent on the lavish costumes, sets, locations, and actors that it couldn't make a profit when it was released. The film was also subjected to the scandalous stories of the affair between Burton and Taylor which had started during the making of the film.

 The truth of the film is that it is technically brilliant in every way. The movie brushes over Cleopatra's (Elizabeth Taylor) relations with Caesar (Rex Harrison) because the main focus is Mark Antony (Richard Burton.) Depsite this rushed plot, Rex Harrison's confident and affable performance brings the character of Caesar to life without flaw. This being primarily a romantic tragedy, both Caesar's and Marc Antony's military exploits are very briefly touched upon; the main battle scene in the film is the decisive naval engagement of Actium . Richard Burton delivers an outstanding performance as Marcus Antonius; Caesar's most trusted legate. Burton's powerful acting brings to the forefront Marc Antony's bachid personality. It seems that Burton and Taylor's love affair during the film simply added to the legendary magnetism between the two doomed lovers. Finally, Roddy McDowell delivers an impeccable performance as Octavian; Caesar's sickly adopted son who would soon give the coup de grace to the failing Roman Republic and become the sole master of Rome as Emperor Augustus.

 The plot is character driven and the actors deliver outstanding performances. The substance of script is primarily based on the anecdotal history of the characters as recited in Plutarch's classic work ""Lives"" and this gives the film a sense of authentic classical flair. This is complemented by one of the most lavish sets and backdrops ever to be made in Hollywood history. A simply brilliant film that one can watch over and over again without ever getting tired. I would strongly recommend this edition for one's collection.",1090886400,,2634,5.142523364485982

1852608,4,B00008MOUP,"""Cleopatra"" is a great film released in 1963 about rise and relationships of the woman herself played by Elizabeth Taylor.  This five-time Oscar winning spectacular film gives a rise to audiences of all kinds.  Its beauty is never to be forgotten.  The hard work and dedication placed onto this film shows greatly.  Such film quality answers why it's since become a highly remembered classic.  Its brilliant plot follows the emotional path of Cleopatra through her rise in power and her life turbulances.  The emotional value stands greatly beyond the spectacular surroundings.  This doesn't distract from the many history details expressed.  The love themes are romantic as any great love classic.  The sense of loss and struggle, namely losing those closest to her and trying to stop the wars from erupting, are greatly present.
All five Oscar wins were won for the spectacular surroundings that continue to amaze audiences after forty-one years: costume design, art direction, special effects, sets, cinematography.  Few other films from the classic days was as elaborate as ""Cleopatra"".  The multi-million dollars spent was worth it.  The backgrounds are accurate desplictions of the actual Ancient Egypt and Ancient Rome.  The buildings and the structure styles are amazing.  The wardrobes are accurate to the actual styles worn by the characters.  The elaborate costumes, namely the ones worn by Cleopatra, are unforgettable.  This set a record for most costume changes by an actress for one film, 32, which would take 33 years to break (""Evita"", 68).  The make-up work blends perfectly with every costume.
Elizabeth Taylor's role as Cleopatra is unforgettable.  Her previous research of the subject is present.  More perfect is the Oscar nominated role (Best Supporting Actor) of Caeser played by Rex Harrison.  His expressions of love and life turbulances greatly improve the movie's theme.  All other actors also play their roles wonderfully: Richard Burton, Martin Landau, Carroll O'Connor, and others.
""Cleopatra"" is a great classic film that will continue amazing audiences for many more years.  This will leave them with an unforgettable experience.  After viewing, those looking for more should also watch the bonus features, which have a lot of interesting details behind the film.",1082246400,,2296,5.351955307262569

1852610,5,B00008MOUP,"What can I say about Cleopatra that has not already been said? It's an epic, powerful, enthralling and magnificent beast of a film, combining breathtaking and expansive visuals with powerful lead performances, and sublime direction by the genius Joseph L. Mankiewicz (responsible for the brilliant 'All About Eve').
'Cleopatra' is the co-ruler of Egypt, exiled by her upstart, puppet-king brother Ptolemy. Enter Julius Caesar, fresh from a civil war with Pompeii, who, ostensibly for the benefit of the Roman empire, ousts Ptolemy and his evil advisors and invests Cleopatra as the sole ruler of Egypt. Hungry for more, the good lady Queen married Caesar and bears him a son in the hopes of extending the Roman empire with Alexandria as its seat of power, but the democratic Roman senate does not agree. Murdering Caesar and forcing Cleopatra and his heir into exile, she returns to Egypt, while Octavian, a heretofore venal and weak man, takes Caesar's place.
Enter Marc Anthony, who, through a series of popular and victorious conquests, rules one-third of the Roman empire. He falls madly in love with Cleopatra, and she with him. Siezing lands and power from her new husband, the couple attempts to overthrow Octavian in a historic battle-at-sea. What follows is real and movie history.
The most remarkable thing about 'Cleopatra' is the fact that it still carries the taboo of failure. This is very much due to a perpetuated myth of financial failure (see the excellent documentary on the bonus disc for clarification of this - lousy money and location management are the culprits) and the fact that this movie is where the Taylor & Burton affair all began. Unpopular as it was in the 1960's, it kept a certain amount of people from giving the picture the praise it deserves. However, mud sticks, and this is another reason for the perceived critical failure of 'Cleopatra'.
Both reasons, happily, are immediately invalidated when one sits down to watch.
In her role as one of the most famus women of all time, Elizabeth Taylor gives a bravura performance, as epic in its attitude as the film itself. She displays a rare feeling for the part, being by turns seductive and regal, human and ethereal. We don't question her authority or her intelligence for a moment.
As Caesar, Rex Harrisson is wonderful. Cleopatra's first powerful lover becomes, in Harrisson's capable hands, a real man, a human bearing the mythical title of Caesar. He is tender and human, wholly believable as a Titan made vulnerable by love.
Richard Burton is similarly magnificent, eclipsing Harrisson's performance with the fire and rash emotion befitting a man in his position. His onscreen chemistry with Taylor is palpable and we are wholly accepting of the fact that she, too, loves him. He is a General of War, and his fierce and passionate battle sequences coupled with his tender, almost innocent love scenes mark him as one of the best actors of his time.
With such excellent performances from the leads, the supporting cast could be forgiven for having been overlooked, but this is happily not the case. Roddy MacDowall is astonishing as the vile and willful Octavian, narrowly and unfairly missing a Best Supporting Actor nomination (again, see the documentary) for his excellent portrayal of an unpopular emperor in uneasy times. Hume Cronyn as Sosigenes is excellent, too.
I can't do any justice to the visual impact of 'Cleopatra' by going into it in-depth, so instead I will just say this. Never before, nor never since, has such a realistic and glorious impression been made by a film. Forget Titanic, and Ben Hur, and all the others - Cleopatra takes the word 'Epic' and utterly redefines it with magnificent temples, sweeping deserts and tempestuous ocean scenes. Taylor as Cleopatra shines like a regal bauble, matched only by her husbands, Caesar and Anthony, in terms of all-encompassing screen presence.
Joseph L. Mankiewicz is, in my opinion, one of Hollywood's most enduring talents. Not content to be responsible for the genius scripting of 'All About Eve', he has created in 'Cleopatra' that which every director surely strives to do: a wholly believable and engrossing setting against which an epic drama is played out.
The DVD quality is superb, with clear and crisp audio and visual elements. The extras are similarly amazing, and the documentary I keep referring to is two hours of fair, unbiased commentary and fascinating insight into one of Hollywood's greatest ever pictures.
I can't recommend 'Cleopatra' highly enough. For scope, beauty, and drama, it is the unquestionable best. The length of the movie is immaterial, further cuts would only diminish its effect. One for everyone's collection.",1073347200,,4706,5.057915057915058
1852611,5,B00008MOUP,"I think Cleopatra is the best movie ever made, it is also the most expensive movie ever made costing twice more than Titanic in today's money, but it just didn't make it to the screen. Intended to be two movies, Caesar and Cleopatra & Antony and Cleopatra, three hours each. But partly because of the attention of the famous Taylor-Burton affair, Darryl F. Zanuck shamelessly ruined Cleopatra from its 6-hour two movies into ONE 3 hour 14 minute movie, which is the TV version, which is Horrible! But luckily, the 4-hour version, this DVD version, survived the brutal cutting of the film. This movie is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. The sets, clothes, props, and music... they are just FLAWLESS! As many people know, Rex Harrison as Caesar and Richard Burton as Antony both got nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars, but because the movie was cut to one, they were nominated against each other in the same movie, and more importantly, their best scenes were cut because of the length, so none of them won (but they deserve to), and Roddy McDowell got nominated in the wrong section and his votes were canceled. Martin Landau was going to be nominated as Best Supporting Actor, but after the film was ruined, the Academy Awards dropped him. Elizabeth Taylor's best scenes were cut off that she was so angry she puked at the Premiere.
The Music of the film is the BEST. Till this Day, I don't know why the Oscars didn't give Cleopatra the award. Of course, Oscars didn't give Gone with the Wind, Gladiator, and lots of other film's beautiful scores the Oscar, it's weird.
How do I know about all about Cleopatra? I have ALL the books, interviews, and even the full movie shooting script of this movie, I am the biggest fan! If you have seen the movie, you'll realize that Cleopatra was usually unhappy and tense. But there is a happy side of her, for example, there was a scene where Cleopatra, Antony and her son with Caesar were in the garden, Cleopatra watching them play swords. Then Caesarian, the son, stubbed Antony with his wooden sword and Antony cried out in ""pain"", and Caesarian suddenly went crying, saying ""don't die, don't die!"" Antony suddenly comes back to life and tickles Caesarian, then drags Cleopatra into them and they were all laughing and rolling on the floor... it was so happy, and that's one of the many sides of Cleopatra that's been cut off.
In the four-hour version, we first see Cleopatra dumped out of a carpet. That was NEVER intended to be the first scene we see Cleopatra. From the script I learned that there was a whole story of Cleopatra outside Alexandria, and she and the others planned to meet Caesar and how to sneak her in. Just after they got to the Palace, some soldiers almost caught them and the maid had to lure the guards away... it was thrilling to read the pages of the script! There are sooo much to saying about what Cleopatra should have been, but sadly, no one expect FOX has the missing footage, and they are the best scenes of the movie (some scenes were so humorous that I laughed out loud!).
In the late 70's, 20th Century FOX called a recording session to record the lines of the movie so they can restore it, since the sound elements were missing. But it was called off at the last minute. But the three-and-half hours of missing film footage was NEVER lost! With today's technology, they can totally restore the film back, including the sound. They also have the missing part of the unused scores, but why doesn't FOX, after making a two hour documentary about the film, restore it? No one knows! Movies like ""A Star is Born"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Sparticus"", and many other classic movies has been successfully restored and loved by many. Why not Cleopatra? I am writing just to let you know the truth about the movie, and hopefully, if more people know maybe FOX will restore the film to the intended way. In a Late interview with four-time Oscar winner Joseph L Mankiewicz, the director and screenwriter of the movie, when the subject Cleopatra went up, he literately cried (on TV!). He said he wanted the film to be perfect that he bit his nails until they were bleeding that he had to wear gloves when he was writing the script... He called Cleopatra his ""butchered masterpiece"". But however, it's still one of the best movies out there! Totally worth buying!!

1852612,4,B00008MOUP,"I feel compelled to offer my perspective, since I might not watch this film again for a decade or so. I first saw it as a child, and was dazzled by the spectacle of it, the cast of thousands, and Ms. Taylor's breathtaking costumes. It is, of course, a very different film when viewed from the perspective of adulthood. It definately feels like a 248-minute long film, which makes it hard to get to the ""Bonus Features"" disk. Where to begin with an epic like this . . . perhaps the performances would be a good starting point. Elizabeth Taylor is wonderful, conveying convincingly the ruthlessness and arrogance of this historical personage as well as the more intimate manifestations of a woman in love. I find Rex Harrison to be a bit tired and stagey in the role of Caesar, but Richard Burton is beautifully cast as Marc Antony. That great voice! Roddy McDowall disappears into his character and almost steals the show as the ambitious Octavian. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who was often disparagingly called ""a woman's director"" (Hollywood could use more of his kind right now!), manages exemplary performances out of all of his major players, and it is his vision which holds the whole thing together. The Alex North soundtrack is perfect, the cinematography stunning, the screenplay very powerful and emotionally honest.

One has to remember that, in the early 1960's, computer effects didn't exist. What you see in 'Cleopatra' is real, not fake, real!
But, as we discover in the documentary 'Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood', there is two hours of footage of this superb film missing. Who knows what story lies in this lost footage.

She also launched into an affair with then married Richard Burton while she herself was married to Eddie Fischer.  Well, I suppose every queen has her suitors.  The movie itself made a resounding thud at the box office even though ticket sales were better than average.  The reason - ""Cleopatra"" was the most expensive flop ever made in Hollywood until Kevin Costner's ""Waterworld"" eclipsed it some 35 years later.  But enough about the film's backstory.  All the lurid details on the making of this giant-sized motion picture are brought together in an exceptional supplement featured with the movie called ""Cleopatra - the Film that changed Hollywood"". One wonders why Fox abandoned their 5 star line of DVD special releases.  This one is a definite must have.
The transfer is pretty pristine.  Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. There is some minor edge enhancement and some pixelization but neither terribly distracts.  For the most part the picture is sharp, smooth and eye popping to look at.  ""Cleopatra"" has never looked better.  The soundtrack is equally impressive, a remastering effort that brings out the film's brilliant underscoring and presents dialogue at very pristine levels.

As for Richard Burton his acting performance is great, he make a very good Mark Anthony.  Rex Harrison acting performance for Julius Ceasar is fine but could had been much better and for the one who play Octavian he look and act gay and I think in real life he his gay, well that's not a problem that his life but his acting was bad he got on my nerves he was annoying.

1852620,4,B00008MOUP,"Cleopatra was an amazing woman in her time, and her story translates well in this film despite it's reputation as the biggest flop of all time.
Through production problem after production problem, the film ended up costing more then any other film ever made when taking inflation into account, and led to problems making it all back upon release (which it eventually did after a few years). But leaving all that aside, the spectacle of the film speaks for itself.
Told in a grandiose fashion like that of the Ten Commandments and Ben Hur, Cleopatra originally was to be two separate films. The first dealing with the relationship between the woman and Julius Caesar, and the second about her and Marc Antony. But the studio forced the two films shortened and combined into one, resulting in a more then four-hour-long epic.
The passion, political intrigue, and cinematic beauty of the film is all encompassing and amazing. The sets are among the largest ever produced for film, and definitely the most lavish. Some of the set pieces are so large it's hard to believe they'd even think to attempt to create them. The visuals are simply breathtaking. Added to that, Rex Harrison is a wonderful Caesar, and of course Elizabeth Taylor creates the perfect Cleopatra.
The only fault this movie has is the pace drags at times. But with such a long film, its hard to avoid that. Strangely enough, I think the addition of lost scenes would improve the pace. The studio cut about an hour and a half of footage before release, most of it battle scenes and character development. What's left is a lot of plot development and it creates long stretches of talk between characters without many breaks.
Despite the pace problems, Cleopatra still delivers everything you expect in a grandiose epic, and is finally receiving much of the praise it deserves.

It had gone out of print, so I thought of buying it, but never got around to doing so. Then when the DVD came out I picked it up mainly because years of curiosity got the better of me. I started with watching the two-hour documentary. And it must admit it really helped me understand the hype behind the film, and put it into the historical context of the time. It  is one of, if not THE best, documentary extras ever on a DVD. It is about the only major extra on the set. A short 1963 newsreel documentary is also included along with a trailer or two. Then I sat down to watch the film with its marathon length of 405mins! It was breathtaking. It was captivating and rich in texture and scope.

Guess what? I found the recently made for TV one, laughable to say the least. It was just another MTV generation, ""show us the b... and wiggle your a..."", kind of movie.
Stereotyped actors freshly out of Academic acting at best.
In the 1963 version instead, you've got true Greatness.
Just mention Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison and you know what you're in for. Count with appearances of actors such as Martin Landau, Andrew Keir, Hume Cronyn, Roddy McDowall, Francesca Annis, Michael Hordern, and so forth, that you are sure it is not you're regular everyday movie.
Many also blabber about the Cecil B. DeMille '30s version, which was good for Hollywood greatness but ridiculous in historic terms.
You should consider it like ""The Robe"" and ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"": a two-part story.
The first part centering on the political, military and sentimental liaison between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. This is where Caesar, having won over Pompaeus, finally elevates Cleopatra to ally of Rome and defies the Senate by marrying her, despite the fact that he is already married!
The second part starts after the Ides of March. Rome is plunged into civil war following Caesar's assassination. A new man rises, Marc Antony and he's got all the chances to become the next Emperor of Rome. Unfortunately for him, in order to achieve victory over the plotters against the State, he's forced to make concessions, one of which is to part the Empire in three pieces, thus being a Triumvirate.
Cleopatra won't accept the evidence and humiliates Marc Antony in public. In the end, after a long struggle, both like orphans without a spiritual father, fall for each other and a passionate love affair starts out of sheer despair for the future of Egypt and the Roman Empire.
The end is inevitable, Marc Antony makes mistake after mistake. Diplomatic and not, until he finally gets a firm answer from Rome: ""Either with us or against us!"" (sounds familiar?).
In the end there's only death in sight. Death of our heroes, death of a period and the death of the values for which they stood.
It certainly is not Gladiator, but is the faithful account (as far as it is possible in the world of movie making) of those glorious bygone days.
Burton and Taylor performances truly shine, despite the fact that they both consumed a lot of alcohol during the filming just to keep up with both their tempers. A fact, that for a movie like this and the situations depicted by the two, could only help.
Rex Harrison as the older, weakend and disillusioned Caesar is in top form and adds to a realistic if not historic depiction of the famous would-be Emperor.
The costumes, the sets, the battles were all recreated following meticolously documents of that period. Everything is ""real"".
So, the next time somebody should call it pompous or fake, he should bite his tongue, because everything you get to see in this movie is as it really was!
If you're looking for gladiators slashing each other to pieces, you're in the wrong place. But if you're interested in history and historic recreation then you get plenty for your money.
Naval battles as they were really fought at sea, Republican Rome as it was before the Civil War, Alexandria as it appeared when the famous Library still existed. All this and more, all faithfully rebuilt for the feast of your eyes.
And then there is the Love Story of all times, even made famous by Shakespeare himself and which couldn't have been told more clearly and played out more vividly and passionately than here.
If you still don't like it go with ""Caddyshack"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"", you're better off with those... but don't forget, no one will ever be able to produce a movie like this again. Either money wise or casting wise.",1027382400,,3845,4.783458646616541
1852625,5,B00008MOUP,"Forget the naysayers; Cleopatra is pure entertainment. Every one of its 246 minutes is filled with opulence and visual treats.  Elizabeth Taylor plays the Egyptian queen who used her feminie wiles to make powerful alliances with both Ceasar (Rex Harrison) and Marc Antony (Richard Burton). She bore Ceasar's son, but lost everything in her devotion of Antony.
The grand scale of the film makes it a pleasure to watch, and not a guilty pleasure. Cleopatra's entrance into Rome is one of my favorite movie scenes of all time. No expense was spared in receating the glory of Rome and Egypt. The film is well-acted and well-written. Harrison's Ceasar is majestic and cunning, and Taylor and Burton still burn up the screen even after all these years.  They don't make lavish spectacles like this anymore; enjoy it!",1027123200,,810,4.948529411764706

Those who did see it in its original release were pleased despite mixed reviews. Today, it is possible to see that it is a GOOD film. Not a great one, but a good one. The sets are appropriately lavish, not the tacky ones envisioned by those who believe that it MUST be a bomb to have so much bad press. The script is intelligent. The acting is well done EXCEPT for Taylor who never really gives it her all. She is only adequate. An excellent documentary is included. This is a historical spectacle well worth seeing.

This movie does everything on a grand scale of imagery and color. With thousands of extras, costumes and brilliant sets sprinkled throughout. Everything on a very large scale and the power of the scenes can vibrate through the screen
The DVD contains an extremely cool look at the politic behind the productions. The trials and tribulations of getting the picture off the ground, into production and out of the can and into the theatres was a major battle.
Richard Burton, Roddy McDowell and Martin Landau give stoic but multi layered performances. The Jewel in this movies crown is by far Elizabeth Taylor. He performance ranges from outraged to the sweetest lover you would ever want to have. In the end she even dies in grace and with honor.
A very layered character, Cleopatra was troubled, hurt and extremely promiscuous at least until she met Marc Anthony. The all ""hell"" broke lose between the Egyptians and the Romans. Accurately portrayed too!
Its is a great look at ancient history and for film students all over the documentary can really educate you on why Hollywood film making is the way it is today. The magic of the epic movie has never been as bright. This is a must for your DVD collections.",1025481600,,1330,4.757575757575758

1852630,2,B00008MOUP,"The Elizabeth Taylor version of CLEOPATRA has taken quite a beating over the years, and its easy to see why: the film is elephantine, with an emphasis on making everything BIG; as such, it eventually sinks under its own weight.
It is difficult to imagine any other actress better suited to play Cleopatra, but Taylor does comparatively little with the role, coming off as less the complex Queen of the Nile than a luxury-loving little minx out for a slinky good time.  Rex Harrison and Richard Burton fare a bit better, although not much. Still, the emphasis is on spectacle--and in spite of the big budgets, historic costuming, and mammoth sets it is really here that the film falls apart.
The problem, really, is that the film's spectacle is too imaginative and takes too many liberties.  A good example is found in the role of Cleopatra herself: the historical Cleopatra considered herself Greek and probably wore Egyptian attire only for ceremonial occasions, but the film prefers to present her flatly in stereotypical fashion, when the truth would have been considerably more complex and entertaining.  Much the same may be said for most of the characters in the film.  As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to accept these characters as anything else but movie stars playing parts.
And in terms of spectacle, in spite of all the money poured into it, the movie looks cheap.  Sure, they had a budget of heaven only knows how much money, but they had to stretch it to costume so many people that the wardrobe department had to settle for nylon-looking material, and a great many of the sets betray the fact that they are sound-stage created.  Then, when really lavish spectacle occurs--as in Cleopatra's entrance into Rome--the production values clash: they seem to be two completely different movies.
It is difficult for me to understand why any one would want to spend money on a VHS, much less a DVD (even with various bells and whistles added), of this particular film.  If you must see the film, you're better off renting it or catching a rerun on cable television.  For CLEOPATRA is essentially a curiosity: a film that should have worked... but didn't.",1008374400,,2184,4.867924528301887
1852631,5,B00008MOUP,"It's a shame the bad rap this film has gotten over the years.  To paraphrase the New York Times in its rave review at Cleopatra's opening - this is great epic entertainment, and unless you are predisposed to give Cleopatra the needle, it is a hugely satisfying and stirring spectacle.  One of the common themes in many of the notices posted here on Amazon is the shock & pleasure of viewers who were surprised at how literate and beautiful the film really is.  They had expected a travesty, a colossal eyesore ineptly acted.  Over & over again the theme is replayed - low expectations giving way to astonishment at how fine the film really is....and always was.
With this film Elizabeth Taylor transcended her then considerable stardom, and became to millions the worldover THE ELIZABETH TAYLOR of legend, a veritable modern Cleopatra of wealth, excess, and star-crossed romance.  This transformation was fueled by Taylor & Burton's very public adultery inviting the censure of the Vatican concerning her fitness as a mother, and debate by the United States Senate about revoking Taylor's citizenship on the grounds she was a threat to public morals.  Adding fire to the inferno was Taylor becoming the highest paid ""million-dollar plus a piece of the boxoffice"" performer in entertainment history.  The vitriolic press lathered themselves up to bash her; but her films continued to earn millions.  Scandal did not seem to taint her.
At its opening, the critical opinion to Cleopatra was decidedly mixed.- everything from raves to bombs....as would be expected when the director's 6 hour/2 film vision was whittled down to 1 film at 4+ hours, and then later for general release, cut again to 3+ hours.  In reading some of the reviews at the time it becomes glaringly clear that many critics got insultingly personal and reviewed the highly paid sexual femme fatale rather than the actress' nuanced performance, finding it impossible to separate the two.  And to blame Taylor for the astronomical costs is absurd. The remarkable DVD includes the documentary ""Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood"", which is a very thoughtful accurate attempt to correct this myth.  From the start, the cast and director/writer were forced by a mismanaged 20th Century Fox to shoot from an incomplete script, practically in sequence - the most inefficient way to shoot since it meant many huge monumental sets stood idle for inordinate periods of time waiting to be used.
The film was a boxoffice hit - not the flat-out bomb the film's detractors wished for.  It was number 1 on Variety's Weekly Boxoffice charts month after month.  It was the number one grossing film of 1963.  Cleopatra continued to perform well in 1964.  And as the above documentary states, it was one of the 1960s top moneymakers.  No film with bad word of mouth plays at theaters for 6 to 15 months at roadshow prices in city after city.  It just doesn't happen.  The fact is that audience reaction to the film was much more positive than the critical reception.
Having said all of that, let me articulate why so many people love this film.
*  Cleopatra has a great literate script.  A very complex story of empire, dynastic ambition and love is rendered understandable and compelling.  And the story it tells is remarkably accurate - some liberties are taken but the general arc of how history unfolded is correct
*  The relationship between the 3 leads is well thought out and the dynamics in their performances shift accordingly.  Caesar and Cleopatra have a relationship of ambitious peers who respect each other and agree to mutually use each other - their dialog fairly crackles with wit and innuendo.  Antony and Cleopatra from the beginning are doomed.  In spite of herself, her political judgement is compromised by her love.  And he is besotted with her, living in Caesar's shadow.
*  Taylor's Cleopatra is a complex compelling woman of force and dignity, fired by a fierce ambition to protect Egypt's independence and rule the world.  In her is embodied the woman, the ruler, the statesman, and the exoticness of the ancient East.  To the movie-going public at the time, she was the only actress beautiful enough and talented enough to play this role.  At this point in her career, she had already been Oscar nominated 4 times (and would be again), and won once (for the wrong performance - but THAT'S another story!!!).  In several years she would win again for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".
*  The opulence of the production is staggering......Alex Norths music is stunning - remastered and rereleased by Varese Sarabande, it is one of the great original compositions for the screen.  The costumes and headdresses are a sensational example of Hollywood craft and art.  And a film on this physical scale would be impossible to produce today.  I saw this film screened at MOMA in New York in the early 1990s as part of a 20th Century Fox retrospective.  The reaction to the sets, the sheer size of the production, the attempt to recreate the exotic grandeur of ancient Egypt was an eye-opener for those in the audience seeing the film for the first time.  From the entrance into Rome, to the barge at Tarsus, to the Battle of Actium and so forth there is one gorgeous set-piece after another.  I enjoyed ""Gladiator"" a great deal, but as so many have expressed, it looks cheesy and false next to the Forum and Alexandria built for this film.
*  The intersection of art and life is the final factor at play.  Here is where began one of the most potent and public of film partnerships - lived on screen and in the tabloids for close to 15 years.  Whether you approved or disapproved of Taylor & Burton, there are few if any stars nowadays that can project that glamorous larger than life aura as they did.  And that, coupled with the spectacle of the film's production - the gossip, the flood of news, the outrage, the money being spent to bring the story to the screen, the crises, and so forth - would simply not occur nowadays.",1006992000,,6003,4.816585365853658

A friend hired it, and I agreed to watch the beginning, only to see what the DVD quality looked like. Two extremely entertaining hours later, the ""Intermission"" title came up, and I knew I was hooked. I bought this DVD the next day, and watched the second half the moment I got it home.
I can see that watching this movie in a theatre would be impossible to do. Its length is made worse by the drawn-out, plodding second half, but with the DVD, you can turn this movie into a mini-series and watch it over a few nights, enjoying the sumptuous sound and music, the awesome wide-screen cinematography and the magnificent sets and costumes as though you were in a theatre.
Liz Taylor is marvellous, spitting venom one minute, a suductive kitten the next - Richard Burton's voice would melt even the most vicious dictator's heart, and Rex Harrison is Henry Higgins in armour. All three lead actors are stunning to watch, belting out their well-crafted lines as if they were thinking them up off the top of their heads. Cleopatra's entry into Rome must have cost the national debt of a small country, and the costumes must have made many seamstesses blind. The Alexandria Palace exterior set almost steals the show, it is amazing.

1852637,4,B00008MOUP,"Starring Liz Taylor, and Rex Harrison. This 4 hour long melodrama has setpieces and costumes that would cost the studio half billion to recreate today. It has behind-the-scenes gossip and news that would make Cleopatra blush.
The film moves with the speed of a snail, yacking and talking of characters that aren't identifiable. The great acting can't make up for the snoringly butt-aching length. Note to filmmakers: At least stop the film in several places; add two intermissions instead of just one. Let the audience stretch. There's no innovations in direction. You get the same narrative scope from ""Ben-Hur."" But at least, the way that was made kept people interested.
The cost and all it's setpieces is the grandest of all.

1852659,5,B00008MOUP,"A masterpiece of the late studio era, though a little lo0ng in length, Cleopatra newly restored and put on DVD is not to be missed.  There are so many great things about this movie, one in particular. A hollywood movie actually attempting to display the Fall of the Roman Republic (though romanticized), Spartacus attempted to do so, and while that was a decent film, its glaring historical inaccuracy is unforgivable. Never before on film has the great Gaius Julius Caesar been brought to such vivid life, though he was a bit old and slightly overweight. Rex Harrison and Richard Burton make this movie, not Elizabeth Taylor, if she was the center than the whole movie would be her own private birthday party entertainment as if she was a spoiled little girl. Ive seen Taylor in better roles, and this wasn't it.  But R. Harrison as Caesar, and R. Burton as Antony are not to be missed. I notice alot of people are comparing this movie to Gladiator, which is good I think. Gladiator took the idea of the Roman epic and showed the primal brutality, the darkness behind all the marble and gold that was Rome. It is a step in the right direction, H'Wood should seriously consider going back to Republican times and show the world, brilliantly, and truthfully the fall of the Roman republic. This film is the closest to doing so and I applaud it.  Mr. Speilberg, Mr. Scott, even Michael Mann, bring on Colleen Mccullough's books! There's a juicy script waiting to be adapted, I would love and so would many others to see Sulla come to the big screen, despite his ominous mention in Cleopatra:  Harrison (Caesar): ""Rome? What was Rome when Sulla died?""  or in Spartacus: Olivier (Crassus): Sulla! To the infamy of his name, to the utter damnation of his line!"" McCullough's Masters of Rome would be great to the big screen, what with the success of Gladiator. I would love to see Julius Caesar take the to the silver screen once more and be played not just brilliantly (like Harrison, dialogue, attitude and all) but physically (Caesar was  a lean, trim powerful man, who did not cover his legs with trousers but flaunted every element of his masculinity and sexuality. He was a powerhouse, lets do him justice!  enough about what hollywood should do, just enjoy this movie and consider it a step in the right direction to the perfection of the Roman epic (not yet done).",995414400,,2367,4.6891566265060245
1852660,5,B00008MOUP,"This movie was miraculous that it even was finished and was able to have a road show engagement.  After the much maligned and problematic (and endless) production, it's a surprise it ended up as good as it did.  Number one, There will never be anyone else but Elizabeth Taylor to play Cleopatra.  Whether you liked her or not in the roll, she was the only choice at the time.  At least her salary said she was.  I don't think Joan Collins had the depth that luscious Liz did.  Audrey Hepburn was considered, but she didn't have the fire needed and was booked solid in film contracts anyway filming ""The Nun's Story"", ""The Unforgiven"", The Children's Hour"", and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" practically in succession of each other.  At least Liz didn't play it campy like Claudette Colbert in the cheesy 1934 version where she just gave in to the Roman Rulers.  Number two, this movie probably has the most sumptuous sets, costumes, cinematography, promotion, etc., on and on, of any major movie to ever come out of Hollywood.  It certainly again won all the Oscars to prove that. Joseph Mankewicz deserved the Oscar for this picture simply because he didn't die trying to complete it.  The production manager did.  It ended up being a far more superior film than what it was given credit for back in 1963.  This was obviously due to the audience of the day responding to the hype over Liz and Dick and the enormous production problems that stuck to the film's image.  All this aside, the completed product ended up being a gorgeously-filmed, intelligently-acted, marvel of a film.  What if it were a few minutes too long? Look at who's lives you're dealing with here.  It certainly was exceedingly better than that television piece of junk with that actress that couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  By the end of Cleopatra (1963 version) you almost felt you had lived a lifetime with these people.  It almost took a lifetime to make.  I always got the feeling that the actors actually really studied acting and read their scripts for the endless photographic shoots.  From the hype at the time, you'd wonder how they did with all the shenanigans off the set and drinking, partying with Taylor and Burton, but their (as well as Harrison's and McDowell's) English Shakespeare-trained talents thus show especially on the literate script.  Even in the comical areas they excel and there aren't many of those in a high-drama like Cleopatra.  Rex Harrison's line ""you all look so impressive, anyone of you could be king"" was perfect.  Of course, the end with the death by snake and the dialog just blows me away because it was done so well.  I have always said there is only one ""Cleopatra"" and this was it.  Also, thank God they finally released the soundtrack on CD two months ago.  Why has it taken all these years to get this stuff out?  It's mind-boggling, but 20th Century-Fox probably thinks they have a hit in ""Cleopatra"" with this generation.  Who knows?.....the film will probably end up making more money than they imagined.  It has certainly received far better reviews from people who recently or never saw it than not.  Just to let anyone know about a small piece of trivia (not to Fox by any means)if they don't.  Cleopatra was the biggest box-office moneymaker after all was said and done in 1963.  It raked in over $58,000,000.00.  Considering it cost $44 million, they have made a small profit and actually have made the money back and over the years have earned a tremendous amount of money and a better reputation for having made the costliest, most-publicized film in movie history.  How could it not add to its credit?  Anyway, then as now, ""Cleopatra"" is an absolutely beautiful, artistic, stunning film that will never be made again and was probably the last glamourous epic from a wonderful time in moviemaking!

1852663,5,B00008MOUP,"In the documentary included with this film, entitled ""Cleopatra: the Film that Changed Hollywood,"" the narrator states that after Elizabeth Taylor saw the London premiere of this movie, she went immediately to the restroom and vomited. Actually, it isn't that bad. In fact, it is a very good movie, although Taylor was a little out of her depth in the title role.

The scandal of scandals is that it was -and still is- the most expensive movie ever made. The money spent to make this movie in the early 1960s, when adjusted for inflation, is more than was spent to produce ""Titanic,"" but the cost of ""Titanic"" was split between two major studios. Twentieth-Century Fox absorbed the entire cost of this runaway production; ""Cleopatra"" virtually shut down the company, almost putting it out of business. How the production got so out of hand is one of the subjects covered in the fascinating ""film that changed Hollywood"" documentary. Among the reasons: the producer, Walter Wanger, sold the studio on a much larger production than had originally been contemplated; principal photography was begun without a usable script in hand; Elizabeth Taylor's contract specified a foreign location, and much money was wasted on an abortive shoot in England; two different directors were used; the second director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, was writing a new screenplay at the time the movie was being shot, so instead of the scenes being filmed in some sort of economically efficient order, they were shot as they were written. Along the way, control of the studio changed hands from Spiros Skouras, who had come up through the ranks of exhibitors, to Darryl F. Zanuck, one of the original founders of the 20th Century Fox. Also along way, Mankiewicz decided he was actually shooting two movies, ""Caesar and Cleopatra"" and ""Antony and Cleopatra,"" each of which was to be about three hours long. Zanuck viewed a screening that was over five hours long, didn't like the film, didn't like Mankiewicz' concept of releasing it in two parts, and insisted that it be released as one film. After much contentious wrangling between the two men, Mankiewicz produced a version that was about 4 hours 8 minutes. This was the movie that was premiered in the U.S. It was too long to be exhibited more than twice a day, however, and Zanuck ordered it to be shrunk to about 3 hours 14 minutes. (This was the version that was premiered in London and caused Liz Taylor to throw up).

The film was not generally well received by critics when it was released in 1963. It was also snubbed by the Academy, which, probably out of revulsion at the waste and scandal surrounding Cleopatra, gave the best picture Oscar to ""Tom Jones."" A smaller film in every way, Tom Jones looks like a made-for-television movie compared to Cleopatra. Alex North, who produced the truly outstanding, evocative music for the Cleopatra was robbed of an Oscar that he should have received. Tom Jones had no memorable music whatsoever.

In 1995, Fox executives explored the possibility of releasing a restored version of Cleopatra at a length of about 6 hours. With Mankiewicz having passed away in 1993, it would have been impossible for anyone else to find the excised footage and edited it in the way Mankiewicz originally envisioned it. What we do get on this disk, however, is the 4:08 version of the film, as originally premiered in the U.S. This is a very good DVD product, widescreen, on two discs, with bonus material, including the excellent documentary, ""Cleopatra: The Film that Changed Hollywood.""

Don't get me wrong, the dvd's themselves are very attractive and for the fact that it is a 3 dvd set the price is exceptional. It was the movie itself that disapointed me. It was lacking a major land battle scene which for the price to make this movie there should have been one. We have some of the greatest military minds of all time and it seems like a waste of 4+ hours not to have at least a small battle. There was also no super scene that all great movies have. (Ben Hur has many, Gladiator had it's opening battle just to name a few.) If you are a past fan of this movie then go ahead and buy it.

1852665,4,B00008MOUP,"the good points? the set, costumes, harrison, burton, and the screen play, the bad points? the script, taylor, and lots of the cast. the famous elixabeth taylor, richard burten saga had a more steamy off screen than on screen. Taylor with everything but what is needed for this movie is (thankfully) out shone by harrison and burton who give terrific performances, harrison as the infamous julius caesar, his acting has never been any better and by far deserved his oscar nomination, burton as a moody anthony. The key scenes may disappoint, the cleo entrance into rome is like saint Patricks day in new york with a big scary sphinx. When taylor and her adinoids scream ""AN-TH-ON-E! when she discovers he has married octavia, that shreek would scare the living daylights out of king kong. the sets are magnificent, 1950s/60s thats is, all we need is sonny and cher in the background with lutes and james deane to roar through the via sacra. the ancient egyptian orgy is more like a scary happy hour, as is taylors costumes which are like renditions of her wedding dresses. the script should be lawfully incinerated, ""puked"" ""Gee!"" and ""boney knees"" are only highlights of the bad bad script in such a movie. This movie would have achieved by far more an audiece had a more suited Cleopatra been cast, Joan collins was tested three times as was susan hayward. All the world went ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" with the taylor- burton story, pity they didn't include that in the movie, at least we wouldnt be as frustrated. The better scenes include the final scene, eerie and poetic, taylor comes alive when her character dies, and after her nasal schreik (as graphically provided above) she tares up her bedroom, that is taylor in action! watch this for the beautiful sets, sometimes believeable costumes and the male leads. but the comic strip colour and horrifying script would even have Cleopatras mummy turning in her sarcoficus!

Saving Private Ryan and Titanic, and even Gladiator don't touch how good this movie is.  I think Caeser did a much better job than Anthony in this film though.

1852667,5,B00008MOUP,"I have been a major fan and memorabilia collector of this film since it was originally released when I was a little boy. During the first decade after its release, it was pretty much thought of as a dismal flop. Truth be known, its original release got MIXED reviews! What a feat - considering nearly 2 hours worth of character development and motivation was deleted. Along with what legend has it as one of Burton's best performances. But, curiously, as the years have gone by, the film, and Taylor, especially, seems to be gathering more and more fans. For at least the last 15 years, there have been several articles, and a growing public base calling for the ""editor's cut"" of this film. Curiously, EVERY epic within a 5 year radius of Cleopatra has been given such treatment, but, despite all the demand for it, WHY has it not been done for Cleopatra? When I heard Fox was preparing a 3 disc DVD for the film, my heart started thumping......MAYBE the time was at hand. Sadly, it was not! I know for a fact there were numerous clips and outtakes that could have been included on the supplementary disc. They were not!! Still, I commend Fox for one of the most SUBERB DVD releases I've ever seen! And, despite the glaring omissions, the supplementary disc contains some remarkable treasures. The film transfer, and the audio quality has NEVER been this pristine! On that note, BRAVO!!

1852679,5,B00008MOUP,"CLEOPATRA has been given a new life in its glorious DVD presentation from 20th Century Fox. It's all here: great digital/THX transfer for improved sound and superbly clear picture, a cast from Hollywood's Golden Age, including the greatly underrated Elizabeth Taylor (in one of her finest roles), Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Martin Landau, and Roddy McDowell, as well as Hume Cronyn; plus an eye-popping menu for language and scene selection and many other features.
Included on the 3-disc set are 2 documentaries on the making of the movie, as well as commentary from Landau and Joseph Mankiewicz's son among others. I haven't listened to all the running commentary, as it goes on for the entire film's length or some 4 hours. It is interesting to learn about the director's intentions that were just a part of the many, many months of actual film production. Cleopatra was several years in the making; and is to this day considered the most costly film ever made. At the time Elizabeth Taylor was cast, she was the first actor to ever earn $1 million for a single role. She went on to earn several million more because of the lengthy overruns in production time. Her salary was all a part of the huge studio publicity machine generated for the public's appetite for more Hollywood star glamour and gossip. Of course, the Taylor/Burton real-life love affair that started on the set was an even greater cause celebre than today's Hollywood ""romances.""
The production values were worth every last penny as the DVD will show: the sumptuous colors, Liz Taylor's costumes/makeup/hair, the lavishly detailed sets, and the remastered sound bring you an old-fashion moviehouse experience.
A previous reviewer has mentioned a technical problem in Disc 2 on Chapter 35. The problem being the picture freezes the film and you have to skip the entire scene. I e-mailed Amazon for a replacement copy, and I received another edition this week. Happily, my new copy is free of any problems. It must have been a badly pressed disc.
Don't skip ANY scene: each one is so important in telling the whole story. That is one advantage to a movie of such length: the screenplay has time to unfold and present all the intrigue, passion, rivalry and emotions that make Cleopatra the classic epic that is and always will be!
They really don't make movies like they used to....So, sit back and enjoy 4 hours of the finest moviemaking you'll ever see!!",987811200,,2427,4.878934624697337

Cleo's entrance into Egypt/Rome on that gigantic Sphinx is still one of the great scenes in movie history. Only problem: as one reviewer said, there's a slight glitch on both the documentary disc and on the second disc, where the picture freezes and you have to skip over it into another segment. Also, Director Joseph Mankeiwicz does a sloppy job of writing toward the end, where he throws all the action to hambone/scenery chewing Richard Burton who goes on and on about his tragic fate his great love for Cleo. He emotes like he's on the stage, rolling his eyes and twisting his mouth and flailing his arms while Liz merely watches. Still, this is a million times better than the washed-out looking Gladiator which seems to have been photographed through a beige veil, with such a paucity of color you wonder why it was even photographed in color.

2. Mark Antony charges into the Roman army: A scene which poignantly displays Antony's grief at not being able to die the death of a honorable man.

1852685,5,B00008MOUP,"A monumental achivement and a powerful milestone that  changed hollywood forever , not only is this film as big  and legendary as the true life story , the true life story ended this movie this film the story is endless from the  massive production to the sweeping love story that it gave on and off screen with Liz Taylor and Richard Burton is in many cases as legendary as the love affair between Antony and Cleopatra. Huge massive sets and authentic locations  and an powerful cast of it's time such as Rex Harrison as Julius Ceaser,Richard Burton as Mark Antony and Roddy Mcdowell as Octavian but at it's heart Liz Taylor in the role that made her the dream of every man Cleopatra who held the power of two nations in the palm of her hand.
  This still hold the worlds record as the most expensive  film ever made 45 millon at a time when you could spend 2 millon on an epic and still get something grand but many  drawbacks and waste and script rewrites , directors getting tired and producers fed up and many times a sick Liz Taylor ,it also holds the record for the largest sets ever built. At the hights of the Roman Empire and the Egyptian Empire, Julius Ceaser a respected Ceaser and general wars to make and expand the greatness of Rome, after the battle little  does he know that while he may conquer countrys there is  one thing he cannot conquer the love of his neighboring Egyptian Queen and ruler of Egypt Cleopatra who is feirce and ambitious and seducting and uniting Rome and Egypt as  one she will do that at all costs even if it means loving a Ceaser and bearing him a son. But when both nations are  locked into war and famon , The Roman senate decides that Julius is no longer capable of being a Ceaser so they , assasinate him. Cleopatra alone and not fufilling her dream she meets the beloved Roman General Mark Antony and is  immidiately swept into another love affair from a Roman  but Antony seemingly betrays Egypt and strikes Cleopatra's anger and frustration now hated and decived by Rome Antony is once again engaged in war with announced Ceaser Octavian as Antony wars at Actium he must endure a terrible defeat.
  But as the movie ends in a almost Romeo and Juliet style as Antony dies in the hands of the only thing to him that was worth fighting for Cleopatra , when she realizes how  much Antony loves her she causes her death and is bit by  a serpent and dies before Octavian can capture her alive.
  An amazing film , a legendary film sprawling in intrigue and betrayal and lust the DVD contains a two hour making of the film and a legend  that almost bankrupted 20th  century fox if Cleopatra was made today it would cost twice  as much as TITANIC to make. Cleopatra was a virtual flop and badly tanked at the box office but this movie is good because  it manages to bring a legend to life with unserpasssed and powerful brillance few Hollywood films can do today.

1852699,5,B00008MOUP,"That a film as good as CLEOPATRA is was created at all under the madness and panic of it's legendary production is indeed an amazing feat. That CLEOPATRA has been given such loving care in it's restoration in this DVD of the ""Road show"" print and the attendant bonus materials is a wondrous gift to those who love this film.
  The documentary, ""Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood"" is in on it's own an engrossing and informative two hour movie. For anyone who knows little of the history of CLEOPATRA, or who was not around at the time, this documentary will give them the feeling of what those last days of old Hollywood were like. And therein one can find the reasons why this intimate epic is indeed the wonder that it is. Much thanks must be given to the Mankiewicz family and the producers of the documentary.
  The print and the sound of CLEOPATRA seems now to surpass what I recall it to be in its first presentation nearly forty years ago. The depth of the colors and the richness of the shadows are indeed splendid. In it's present form it is hard to believe this film is as old as it is. The commentary track is like finding the lost treasures of the long dead monarch. For there are wonderful recollections by Martin Landau, Tom and Chris Mankiewicz, and even Jack Brodsky gets to read sections from his book ""The Cleopatra Papers"". But I must give special mention to Landau's part. With his keen eye for the art direction of John DeCur one sees things in the background and along the edges of the scene that one never noticed before. Such lovingly detailed sets and interiors will never be seen again. The costs today are just too prohibitive. Also his insights into what was cut from the film, particularly his and Richard Burton's contributions in the second act give one the idea of what Mankiewicz was intending. Poor Richard suffered the unkindest cut of all. The presentation of the DVD menus are so clever and exotic and are to be commended in their art direction. At last we now know what is behind the massive 20th Century Fox logo!
  The film itself remains what it has always been, a good film that might have been great if only Zanuck had but trusted Joe Mankiewicz' original vision. In the documentary it is stated that Fox is looking for the missing film, one can only hope that they succeed.
  The performances range from excellent to good. Particular praise must go to Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, Martin Landau, Robert Stephens, Andrew Keir, and Roddy McDowall. Lastly in this department there remains Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Cleopatra. At the films release she got the brickbats and for reasons that had nothing to do with her performance. It is always hard to separate the history of the lady from her film roles. But here in this film is where she became the ELIZABETH TAYLOR she has remained in the mind of the world to this day. In this fact alone she is perfect in the role. She is at once regal and commanding, strong and tender, soft and hard. The contradictions that have always been at the heart of Cleopatra herself, the public enigma wrapped within a mystery. In her performance as written by Mankiewicz she is probably not too far off from the historical Cleopatra.
  Ever since Judith Crist gave CLEOPATRA the needle in 1963 and in the act made her name, the public, for the most part, has viewed this film a failure. But today, stripped of the scandal, hype and hysteria of its release in June of '63 it is now possible to view CLEOPARTA as the wonderful film that it is. Historically this is an important DVD and I recommend it highly. CLEOPATRA remains as seductive, beautiful, and intelligent as it was in Walter Wanger's original conception.

1852702,5,B00008MOUP,"Despite the legendary excesses and scandals that went on during the making of this unjustly maligned movie, it has three of the most critical foundation stones any work of this scope needs to succeed:
1).  A unified vision or point of view, extending from the development of plot and characters to the physical look of the production itself.
2).  A literate and compelling script that could play irrespective of the opulence of its surroundings.
3).  Four leading actors who instinctively understand how to work their material, making the seams between performer and character invisbile to the spectator.
#s 1 & 2 were supplied by director / screenwriter Joseph L. Mankiewicz, #3 by Taylor, Burton, Harrison, and McDowell.
This is a film that easily bears repeated viewings, and, again, thanks to Mankiewicz and his actors, functions simultaneously on a variety of levels.  For example, there are the love stories:
Caesar & Cleopatra / Antony & Cleopatra.
The tender scenes are written and played almost poetically, but there are also political manouverings going on as each uses the other to attain or augment their power.  This is made even more fascinating in that these are obviously intelligent, witty, charming, beautiful, ruthless, and influential people whose calculations shape nations and Empires.
Given all of the above, the movie also looks like the enormous sum it cost, has a brilliant score by Alex North, an accomplished supporting cast (in particular, Martin Landau, Pamela Brown, Hume Cronan, Cesare Danova), and spectacular ""set pieces"" that though fully integrated into the plot, almost play as ""movies within the movie"" - Cleopatra's Entry into Rome, Cleopatra's Barge & Banquet, the Battle of Actium.
In sum, Mankiewicz and cast succeed in bringing off the big ""world stage"" themes critical to this genre of historical film.

Of all of Hollywood's various reincarnations of ancient Rome (up to, and including the recent ""Gladiator"") this film stands as probably the most completely satisfying, and artistically solid of all such efforts. There isn't a mis-cast role. The level of acting is excellent throughout. Visually, and in every other way technically stunning, one wishes for the wide screen perspective: the standard pan-scan presentation is horrid. Alex North's score is probably his best (considering that he previously wrote the music for 2001, A Space Odyssey before Kubrick killed it and decided to use music ""in the public domain."")
This is a very long film. Do not expect snappy, tight flip-flopping from one situation to another. The exposition of the material is extremely detailed and needs its expansive development. If you can't sit still and follow a complicated story, don't even start this film. If, on the other hand, you can deal with Shakespeare and ancient history sumptuously presented, then you are in for a marvelous treat.
In truth, this is real film making - not hot shot special effects wedded to toilet bowl morality, horrid acting and total emptiness. Forget the Burton/Taylor romance and all the other garbage associated with this movie. Most of the blood and guts in this film takes place in your mind - where it properly belongs.

1852707,4,B00008MOUP,"This movie absolutely gets much too bad of a rap than it should. I just saw it for the first time and I thought it was marvelous. I'd seen The Taming of the Shrew a couple days ago and was appalled by most of Elizabeth Taylor's acting because I knew that she COULD act. This film shows it.
I agree with a previous reviewer who says that she might have been judged too critically because of her looks. The critics might have thought she was chosen for the movie because of that, and seen it with that viewpoint.
I thought the scenes which were most boring were the ones at the Senate when Octavian was talking. I fast forwarded all of those. They're merely to advance the plot some more and if you already know the story, you don't need to watch them.
Rex Harrison is extremely good as Julius Caesar, but I was eager to get to Antony & Cleopatra (I got interested in the story because Giulio Cesare is the opera that made Beverly Sills famous) so I didn't miss him after the first tape.
 Richard Burton is great and he and Ms. Taylor complement each other very well. I love their last scene together when he says, ""You and I will prove death so much less than love. You and I, we will, we'll make of dying nothing more than one... last... embrace... A kiss... to take my breath away."" And then she leans down and kisses him.
 When she comes up, he is dead. Her eyes lift towards heaven and she says, ""There has never been such a silence.""
 That is one of the many reasons I think this film is wonderful.",975283200,,1502,4.244755244755245
1852708,4,B00008MOUP,"Having read the previous reviews of ""Cleopatra"" on this board I could not help concluding that one either likes historical dramas or one  doesn't_____if you are in the latter category then you are in for a treat!  With its lush set designs,splendid costumes ,great dialogue (loosely based  on Shakespeare's ""Antony and Cleopatra"") and very competent  acting I couldn't find much room to quibble with this movie .Rex Harrison  as Julius Caesar is probably the best of the lot but even Burton's Mark  Antony is played pretty competently. And then there is the ravishing  Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role! She does a great job  playing the  coquettishly insouciant Cleopatra .I think her acting in his role is  under-rated_____ paradoxically because she was soooo beautiful! Her  triumphal entry into Rome is breathtakingly grandiose & I had to rewind  it half a dozen times to soak up its full impact . The only reason I gave 4  stars (not 5) to this movie is on account of its inordinate length: it  could have been edited to 3 hours without losing much in the way of  content. Finally for fans of Francesca Annis  (""Macbeth"",""Reckless"" etc) she also has a cameo role as  ""Iris"" playing Cleopatra's chambermaid .",967939200,,1212,4.862745098039215
1852709,2,B00008MOUP,"First, the good news about the '63 version of ""Cleopatra:"" Rex Harrison is in the first 90 minutes. The bad news is that Richard Burton takes over thereafter. Burton's performance as Marc Anthony is overbown,  overly dramatic and slightly silly. He was seldom sober during the making  of this turgid film and it clearly shows.
Liz is beautiful, as always,  and the sets are absolutely dazzling. For those who thought the Roman city  scenes in the recent ""Gladiator"" were good, they need to see  genuinely awesome sets and this film delivers.
Unfortunately, the film is  in desperate need of a an editor, as it scarcely holds ones interest for 4  and half hours, especially once Rex bites the dust.
Of course the  riveting ""behind the scenes story"" is the Burton-Taylor love  affair which ignited during the making of this film in 1962. Poor Eddie  Fisher and Sybil Burton back then... and poor us nowadays watching this  limping dinosaur. The 1934 Claudette Colbert ""Cleopatra"" is  superior to this bloated turkey, buy that one instead.",962755200,,1036,4.92485549132948
1852710,5,B00008MOUP,"So what if it was tremendously over budget, historically inaccurate, politically incorrect, and, at times, hammily performed! ""Cleopatra"" still remains one of those movies that I can pop in the VCR everyday and enjoy.
I hate it when a reviewer tells too much about the plot in his/her critique, but I am so enamored by this film that I must list my favorite scenes and bits:
1) Cleopatra being unveiled from a rolled-up rug to Julius Caesar; (2) Pompei's head being revealed to a stunned Caesar; (3) The burning of Alexandria and the Great Library; (4) Cleopatra's triumphant entrance into Rome; (5) Cleopatra's vision of Caesar's death and his death at the hands of the Roman Senate; (6) Cleopatra ""playing"" in her bathtub; (7) Cleopatra's magnificent barge; (8) The party/orgy on the barge; (9) Cleopatra's emotional eruption upon finding out about Antony's marriage to Octavian's sister; (10) The death of trusted aide Sosigenes at the hands of Octavian; (11) Anthony and Cleopatra having a little physical exchange in the form of shared slaps; (12) Antony on horseback futilely charging the Roman army; (13) Antony's suicide;(14) The final verbal exchange between Cleopatra and Octavian; and (15) Cleopatra's eventual suicide and how elegantly she looked ""laid out.""
As far as the acting is concerned, Taylor as Cleopatra was the logical choice for the time to portray the legendary queen. Who else but she could have gone through so many costume changes and looked as good in each one? Who else at the time had the range and experience, as well as beauty, to tackle the role?
Richard Burton had just the right fire and flair to pull off the role of Marc Antony. It didn't hurt, either, that he was infatuated by his co-star.
Rex Harrison utilized his commanding presence to his advantage in the somewhat third-tier part of Julius Caesar. Although he appears roughly in the first half of the film, he still is memorable in his part.
Hume Cronyn, Cesare Donova, and the great Roddy McDowall are brilliant in their supporting roles. Future ""Archie Bunker"" Carroll O'Conner and Academy-award winner Martin Landau are also on board in significant parts. Veteran character actor John Hoyt, always effective, portrays a Roman senator.
Alex North's score is one of his best. Too bad that it is not in circulation at present.
Now, I would be extremely satisfied if Twentieth Century Fox could find those reported missing two hours of film.
Would love to see how the whole bloody pleasure would have looked at six hours long!",959904000,,2520,4.959810874704492
1852711,3,B00008MOUP,"This film is so bad at some points that it's good.  At least it's bad in a big way.  Strangely enough, it IS entertaining, but not for the reasons I'm sure were intended.  The script is frequently terrible.  One example, when  one of the soldiers ask Julius Caesar ""what happens at dawn""?  Caesar's reply?  ""The sun comes up!"".  There are worse moments,  to be sure.  Nevertheless, there are some spectacular moments as well -----  Cleopatra's entrance into Rome, her barge floating down the Nile, etc.  The  battle scenes are ordinary.  Besides occasionally loony script, I find  little here to reflect the fact that the film had a great director.  Joseph  Mankiewicz directed some great films in his career (""Letter to Three  Wives"", and ""All About Eve"", to name two), but one would  hardly be able to discern this from watching this film.  The best  performances come from Rex Harrison, whose Julius Caeser is right on the  money.  Harrison is so good in this role that you really miss him after his  demise at the end of the first half of the film.  Richard Burton shows what  a fine actor he could have been had he taken a different career road.  By the time Elizabeth Taylor came to make this film, she had already won  the 1960 best actress Oscar for ""Butterfield 8"" (as well as  having been nominated for three previous films).She was to win another  Oscar in 1966 for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf""?.  While all  of this is impressive (and she could, under the right circumstances, act up  a storm), the fact is that her work in ""Cleopatra"" is very poor  indeed.  Of course she is stunning to look at ---- that goes as a given  ----- but with the dialogue she is given to deliver ---- her Cleopatra  lacks any sort of stature and power.  She walks into a scene, delivers a  line, and ancient Alexandra is transformed into Madison Avenue.  Critics  were highly critical of Taylor's performance when this film was released  ----- many felt it was the worst performance of her career.  They were  probably right.  One would never guess that the actress seen here was the  same who had already given us such fine performances in such films as  ""Giant"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", etc, and who was  still to make film history in ""Virginia Woolf"".  Whatever,  there it is.  It's big, lush, sometimes very bad, but also sometimes a lot  of fun to watch.  It's a film that has made for itself a very unique place  in movie history, and I can see why so many enjoy it.  But a great  film?Hardly.",944006400,,2495,4.532879818594104
1852712,5,B00008MOUP,The costumes and hair designs were amazing. This role was made for Liz. The role of mark was also made for Burton because he was a wimp when it came to women. Absolutely my favorite film.,943747200,,187,4.222222222222222
1852713,3,B00008MOUP,"Well I have yet to see this film 67 times,but I have seen it twice. Elizabeth Taylor is one fabulous broad who looks spectacular whatever century she chooses to dress up in. But Cleo should have eased up on the  eyeliner a bit here I think. Burton is ...adequate but Harrison &  McDowall really give it their professional all. There are also some  interesting cameos from Martin Landau and a young Francesca Annis. The sets  were fabulous(the only superlative that fits here) and didn't you just love  that grand entrance into Rome...incognito!?.All you Queens take note. This  is how its done.
Apparently it was a difficult film to make what with one  reason or another. Taylor had to be hospitalized at one stage and of course  this was where her & Burton started there long relationship. But all  this takes 2nd place to an otherwise noteworthy movie which unfortunately  missed its mark with the critics and especially the public. Hope they do a  comedy remake with Ellen Degeneres as Cleo and Jerry Seinfeld as Mark  Anthony. Id pay to see that. Meantime I might even watch this one again.",938044800,,1094,4.73015873015873
1852724,5,B00008MOUP,"Cleopatra is an amazing story that was transformed onto the screen in an amazing and brilliant way. This film is so timeless and perfect. Elizabeth Taylor is simply brilliant and plays her part so well that you feel as  though you are there and it is truly an amazing experience! Burton fits his  part perfectly with all the power of Caesar himself. The acting is  unsurpassed and cannot be equalled. If you want to see a truly phenominal  film that has what most of our movies today do not (great stories), then  you must see, Cleopatra (1963). Now this is no 60's skin flick, this film  is Oscar all the way and does not use Cleopatra's sexual charms to pull it  through. Cleopatra is timeless and truly entertaining. Elizabeth Taylor won  the Best Actress Oscar in 1963 for her portrayal as Cleopatra. This film is  a must see for every movie lover.",934934400,,852,4.552631578947368

7985399,2,B00008MOUP,"An endless, dragging bore-a-thon of sluggish and needless dialogue!  I remember seeing this in the theater when it first came out and thankfully the big screen, the lavish costumes, and Miss Taylor's voluptuous curves and eyes kept me awake. As a professional actor and director, I usually have a lot of tolerance for movies that fall short in certain categories. But after suffering through 1 tortuous hour of slow, dragging stage scene-after-scene, I had to remind myself that this movie forgot to include at least a few epic confrontational battles or stand-downs with a large army, horses and chariots!  Nothing but architectural panaromas of studio matt painters showing off on huge sheets of glass. Clint Eastwood's legendary penchant for throwing 70% of character dialogues out of scripts would certainly have been a correct choice in this plodding, sluggish, sleeper.
Only high point in the entire 4 hour production?  Cleopatra's grand entrance into Rome. FANTASTIC!  Take the unit directors and cinematographers and script writer for just that grand entrance parade, and give them the whole rest of the movie to do THEIR way. Too bad Cleopatra's entry into Rome couldn't have been created as a music video. That way everyone could have seen just THAT SCENE and forget the whole rest of the stilted, forced and ridiculously unrealistic dialogue. I'm going to now sell this brand new Blu-ray movie because I don't want it in my permanent archive of 1,000 movies!!! Not even to steal some adolescent quick peaks at Elizabeth Taylor's beauty  just beginning to enter her middle-aged phase of her career.",1520035200,,1608,5.122137404580153
