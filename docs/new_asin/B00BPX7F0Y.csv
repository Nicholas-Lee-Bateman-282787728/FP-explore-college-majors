8572327,4,B00BPX7F0Y,"This was a very short DVD, but interesting and with good graphics and story line.  I wouldn't suggest someone pay full price for it because it's so short.  Find a cheap, used one.",1388707200,,179,4.393939393939394
8572328,5,B00BPX7F0Y,"""River of Steel"" is amazingly informative despite the fact that it runs only about 30 minutes. I learned a lot and came away with a better understanding of not just how they built the current New York City subway system, but also with more knowledge about how and why New York was expanding so rapidly in the late 19th century that something had to be done about it. The story line moves along well and the filmmakers use great still photos with footage shot roughly 100 or more years ago; they show the very overcrowded and unsafe living conditions in lower Manhattan. People dreamed of moving uptown or perhaps to what was then the independent city of Brooklyn to enjoy more living space and a better quality of life.

""The (subway) train was their liberator, first in its elevated form and then underground. Built by Irish and Italian immigrants making 20 cents an hour, the new people-mover brought fortunes to speculators as it transformed the city's face and brightened its faces. Celebrities occupied the Ansonia on the Upper West Side; immigrants moved up to the Bronx; blacks moved to Harlem; everybody could get to Coney Island for a nickel. The first motto of Interborough Rapid Transit was `From City Hall to Harlem in 15 minutes.' It still happens on a good day.""

We first get some background information: how New Yorkers and businessmen envied London for having what was then a huge subway system even though the fumes from the underground trains were quite noxious. There is a brief look at an early New York City subway using what was essentially a pneumatic tube 1 block long; and the film explains well why there was concern about the expense of an underground subway which would cost 4 times that of the elevated trains that initially were the fastest mode of public transportation. They tell us how the financial problem was resolved; but I'll leave that and a few other things out so I don't spoil it all for you!

By 1940 the New York subway was considered complete, but since this film was made they are finally working on a 2nd Avenue subway line! However, for financial reasons certain issues still pose problems.

I highly recommend this documentary for people interested in the development of rapid mass transit; the history of trains in general and the history of the city of New York.",1343779200,,2314,4.734491315136476
