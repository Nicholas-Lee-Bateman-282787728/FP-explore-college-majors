8116069,5,B000F0UQXG,"I love this whole series of artists.  I use them to introduce my students to style, background and history genre.",1398729600,,113,4.65
8116070,5,B000F0UQXG,This film was a perfect addition to an art program I facilitate for seniors with memory impairment...they loved it!  It wasn't too long and the story line was very easy to follow.,1378771200,,179,4.59375
8116071,5,B000F0UQXG,"I use this series for my own pleasure, for learning, as I love art, but also for the classroom.
My students, have learned about especially French artists, and their techniques.  This has been
a wonderful way to introduce them, teach them, and 'hook' them into loving art, and trying this
method for themselves.  I think they will always recognize Monet's works.
  This series is great!",1367193600,,385,4.876923076923077
8116072,1,B000F0UQXG,I got this video in hopes of showing it to my 2nd grade students when introducing Monet.  Unfortunately I was not able to show it because it is really inappropiate for an audience of students - lots of violence and language.  I just thought I'd help out other art teachers - not appropriate for an audience of kids...,1304380800,3,317,4.448275862068965
8116073,5,B000F0UQXG,"This is a great video for both young and older students.  The action is well paced to keep their interest, yet very informative. One of the better videos in this series.",1281916800,,169,4.451612903225806
8116074,5,B000F0UQXG,"As an elementary art teacher I have viewed this film at least 12 times, and I never get tired of watching it with my students.  It is appealing to ages 7 through Middle School.  The film brings Monet to life and explains all of the important information about Monet's development of his Impressionist style.  It is also a great story about relationships.  Learning becomes fun and entertaining with wholesome movies like this.  The entire series is very well presented.",1157241600,,469,4.886075949367089
