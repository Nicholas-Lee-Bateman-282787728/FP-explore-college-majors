4268295,1,B0046H0I14,"Please note that I love Naruto.  This is not a negative review of the show.  All of these episodes are fantastic.  You should know by the 21st Naruto box set whether or not you like the show.  This is a negative review of the terribly cheap packaging Viz decided to start using.  This is exactly the same thing they did to the Bleach releases.  It's a slipcover for a standard size dvd case that holds three discs.  I would have even been somewhat ok with this decision if they had made it when they first started releasing the Shippuden box sets.  It's absolutely unacceptable to me when companies change packaging mid series.  My Naruto collection used to look fantastic on the wall.  Now, with these releases it will look awful.  Frankly, if Viz doesn't care about their customers then I don't care about Viz.  I will not be buying another anime from them again, ever, unless they fix this problem.  I understand the economy is tough and they are trying to save money. However, making your customers mad to the point that many of us refuse to give them another penny is NOT the way to save money.  They can't be saving much money on packaging per set.  I would have gladly paid an extra dollar or two per set if that's what it took to keep the fantastic packaging they were using before.",1297209600,17,1290,4.452991452991453

It is no longer three separate slim cases in the cardboard box. This box looks different and is self contained.  I haven't opened it yet to see exactly what it looks like inside, since I am annoyed that it looks different then all of the other box sets on my shelf, but I have as of yet been unable to find someone selling one like the the others, so my guess is it has been discontinued.

4268297,5,B0046H0I14,"Naruto is a show that is greater than anyother show. Right now I am past this ""arc"" and on the ""Plan:Moon Phase arc"". This arc ""Plan: Moon Phase"" is where u have already found out that sasuke defeats Itachi and gets Itachi's eyes. While everyone in the akatsuki is dead and it turns out madara uchiha is the man named tobi who wears that orange swirled mask. He has lived and is now planning to use zestu's clones to fight every shinobi. Sasuke has his own agendas the first is to team up with tobi and destroy the hidden leaf. Naruto must fight sasuke to make sure his friends are killed. Naruto has mastered his kyuibu 9-tailed fox in him by taking the nine-tails chakra. Only naruto and the eight tails are left alive. So the battle starts and Kabuto has now entered the scene promising Tobi/Madara Uchiha a new juistu to destroy the rest of the shinobi's and samurais. He has a juitsu where he can revive those dead through 'Unwordly Resurrection Jitsu. This allows him to revive all of naruto's past enemies. Danzo has been killed and so has Kisame and everyone else. Only Madara, Sasuke,Jugo, Seigestu,Karin, and kabuto are the only bad people still left alive. THIS arc can be read by searching for 'naruto magna online free read'.

4268298,5,B0046H0I14,These are pretty good episodes and they give you alot of good backgroud information that is yet to come. Plus I watched a few episodes past 65 because I'm tired of waiting for the english dub but whats to come after episode 65 is going to blow your mine and if you don't watch these episodes you will be confused.,1294704000,6,313,4.233333333333333
4268299,4,B0046H0I14,"This ""box set 5"" includes episodes 54 through 65, starting what's known as the ""Sora Arc"". This new set begins Shippuden's first filler arc which had some level of criticism of fans but they aren't as bad as people think, specially considering the first series 80+ episodic filler. However this time around the studio worked around that and created a singular story arc (which will finish in middle of DVD box set 6) with interesting characters and plot. The story itself seamlessly merges with the original Manga's Canon material so as to provide more depth to the story and some of it's characters. The story might have it's faults but it is no way a ""horrible experience"". I definitely recommend this for all fans of the series.

By now if you are watching this show you are fully aware of the standard practices in these types of DVD boxes, dual language (English and Japanese), basic audio/video options, subtitles, text-less opening/closing videos. As well as an extra feature highlighting the English production at Viz. Overall this ""filler arc"" is pleasing to watch and provides some much needed insight to one character in particular that will be further explored in the following DVD box set.",1291248000,41,1202,4.921182266009852

Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

4268450,2,B0046H0I14,"Straight to the point, the first three episodes are interesting as Naruto learns to use his wind-nature and Sai tries to address his social problems. These episodes are worth watching and re-watching... HOWEVER the rest of the box set is filler. Therefore, rent these episodes first BEFORE you decide to buy them.

Regarding the filler episodes: These filler episodes are better than what occurred in the previous Naruto series. The animators really tried to do a quality filler ARC and linked to characters actually in the manga in order to set up for future story lines. But, fillers just can't compare with the original story. I never grew to like or care for Sora and his ""connection"" with Naruto felt ""forced to exist"" so the arc was possible. It would have been better if the connection between these two had been through empathy, emotion, understanding, and past experience (as is true with most of the other characters including Gara and Sasuke).  I felt the 4 enemies' powers were at times over-done, i even found myself rolling my eyes at some of their powers/jutsus. The set up for the large battle made the Leaf Village look too weak, foolish etc and the bad guys too powerful. I prefer a more balanced approach. The other new characters were monks, who ended up being rather flat and uninteresting. You do not grow to care for them or learn that much about them. So, in my opinion, the Sora arc needed better writing and character development to make it worth re-watching/buying.

Heads up: Be aware that the filler arc is not wrapped up in this boxed set. Plus these three discs only hold 12 episodes instead of the usual 13-14. Therefore, this leaves 6+ of filler episodes for box set 6. Fortunately, the arc that comes next is really good = )",1302220800,3,1758,4.701298701298701
4268451,2,B0046H0I14,"I am a huuuuuge Naruto fan and I own every english dubbed series/movie released at this point.  However I some serious issues with the way Viz went about releasing this set.

The episodes contained in this set are 54-64 and are filler episodes.  This means the episodes do not further the story, and are not in the original manga by Kishimoto Masashi.  Episodes not furthering the story are typically less interesting than episodes that do, although for filler episodes these aren't too bad.  Despite the arc being somewhat interesting, the arc doesn't conclude in this set, so one would still need to watch more episodes for the non-story-furthering conclusion.

One thing that most other reviewers neglect to mention is that there is SOME non-filler present in the early episodes (consisting of Naruto doing a bit of training).  These episodes are actually very good.  The filler arc develops the character of Asuma Sarutobi a little better, which is useful since he plays a bigger role in the near future.

The physical box set itself was shodily put together.  It is a standard dvd case, with three discs crammed inside.  The disc-holders do not seem sturdy in the case and the set lacks the quality of every single other Naruto box set Viz has released.  The only thing the set has going for it is a slip cover over the dvd case.

Presumably, the excuse for this is that the set is filler.  The next set is receiving the same treatment, but the following set will go back to the original format because it doesn't contain any purely filler episodes.  The problem with this is if this set is regarded lower by viz, and has cheaper packaging, and has worse episodes, then shouldn't the price be lower?  Of course not.  The price is the same as the other sets.

I suppose Viz did this to save money on cardboard boxes for their box sets . . . but this ruined the set-up of any Naruto anime collectors collection.  I have also read some complaints from people who purchased every single special edition box-set of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden up til this set.  The special editions are much bigger boxes(I have one of these) and have a little something extra in them.  This isn't offered for Box set 5, so those people are really out of luck.  Saving a few bucks is worth more to Viz than pleasing fans, I suppose.

Purchase this set if you already have a complete collection of dubbed sets, but if you do not . . . skip this set!  It's quality is much poorer than every other released set and isn't worth the price of the cardboard boxes Viz excluded.",1300406400,4,2552,4.582781456953643
