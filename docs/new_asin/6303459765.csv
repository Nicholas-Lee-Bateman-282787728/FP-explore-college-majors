646662,5,6303459765,not only has his music been a real treat but his videos as well.they have taken the concept to greater heights.his vision&dancing are still major events as far as i'm concerned.he was already bad musically and then came  video and he ran away with it.folks might not want to fess up but alot of  folks rock on his style.,947289600,4,320,4.406779661016949
646663,5,6303459765,This is an amzing video and also History on film vol. 2. He should be the master of music and hopefully his son should take his place when he retire and be just as amazing.,925603200,,172,3.942857142857143
646783,5,6303459765,"I've always liked this DVD, in particular because of the longer versions of his videos that are on it. Some were never played on MTV back in the day when it was really popular with the format. They were either too long or too controversial in nature, like that of the ""panther version"" of ""Black or White"".
10 of his best from his 1979 solo debut to a few from 1991's ""Dangerous"".
The sound is pretty good, but I would say now that we live in the ""Digital Age"", the quality of this DVD looks dated. IF you can, play it back on a Blu-ray player with the UHD TV set up. It will improve the overall quality somewhat. I did just that and compared it to my standard DVD player. The image was better, but still not up to Blu-ray standards we all now have seen and enjoy.
Would love for one day for his material to get on the bandwagon and get the HD upgrade to Blu-ray. The image and sound would be superior and would not be ""compressed"" like that of standard DVD format.
Still, if you don't have any of his video releases, YOU MUST get this one just for the THRILLER video.  Find a good price and look around. You will find a good deal.

~ Just a side note, MAN IN THE MIRROR is NOT on this DVD like it is stated above in the details for purchase. It starts out with BRACE YOURSELF and then a KALEIDOSCOPE of Michael Jackson History images...",1501286400,,1337,4.158301158301159

He was love world wide as well. This is a DVD with excellent quality and management of Michaels skills of being on the World Stage. Some back home wanted to believe the worst about him.

647631,3,6303459765,"I bought this Dvd for my Grandson who is 6 and just now discovering MJ. He likes Michael's energy and moves on stage. I grew up on Elvis and even though i thought Michael sang better when he was younger i still will admit he was the 2nd greatest stage entertainer America ever had. Some people are just born to entertain on stage and Michael was. While Elvis was better looking and had a better voice, had more charisma and was more manly, i still give Michael more credit for being more creative on stage and a better dancer. Elvis only moved as the music moved him which was exciting to watch but Michael choreographed every beat of a song until it was a visual painting brought to life. He had his weird times and these videos show a few of them much like when the Beatles started doing drugs and experimenting Michael did the same but when he was on his best game he was an awesome entertainer. That's why i don't mind my Grandson watching a truly great talent at work and he will not be raised watching untalented rappers and voice synthesised singers. He will be exposed to the true great talents of Elvis #1 Michael #2 and by then all the others will not measure up to them and he will know what a real entertainer is.

I love the long version of the ""Bad"" video. That's a freakin' classic! Wesley Snipes is very convincing as a tough guy gang leader and Mike is hilarious trying to act like a gang banger. The long version of ""The way you make me feel"" was jive and same goes with ""Black and White"". I still love those videos but the long versions was not necessarily a plus. The ""Remember the Time"" video is a classic and I don't know if they play the whole video on TV anymore. It's good to have that. Overall it is a good product particularly if you have not seen these videos only a few times. The long versions of the videos are ok but not great except for ""Bad"". I did not comment so much on Thriller, Billie Jean and Beat It. People are pretty much familar with these videos although I never was a fan of the Billie Jean video even though I love the song. The dancing of ""Beat It"" is very fun to watch. Thriller is just one of the best!

647929,4,6303459765,"This DVD starts out with a montage of Michael performing at various concerts, showing off some of his performing skills. As this is going on, you get a message to ""Brace Yourselves..."" and Brace Yourselves is exactly what you need to do as you see the following videos...

BILLIE JEAN - One of the videos that broke the barrier on MTV, and also the video to one of Michael's biggest hits of his career. And to think...this is before the moonwalk became a big craze. :)

THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL - Here, for the first time ever on DVD, you have the full nine minute mini-movie to the song. One thing that Michael is known for, besides his dancing, of course, is the way he revolutionized the music video industry by creating little mini-movies to most of his songs, and this one is no different. And, yes, of course, he gets the girl in the end.

BLACK OR WHITE - This is another one of the famous mini-movies, and, for the first time ever on DVD, you get the full mini-movie. This garnered a lot of controversy due to some of the racist remarks that Michael destroyed that were painted on windows of buildings and windshields of cars, but, looking back on it and listening to the song now, that kind of seems like the point.

ROCK WITH YOU - One of Michael's early videoes. And it seems so simple compared to some of his later videoes. But, in my honest opinion, it's also one of his best on the DVD set.

BAD - FOR the FIRST TIME on DVD, you get the full 18 minute mini-movie directed by Martin Scorsese. This shows Michael as a schoolboy early on, and it heats up when the song starts, proving to the world, and to the people he's singing to, that Michael is indeed bad, and he wants the whole world to know that he is bad.

THRILLER - Of course, what would a Michael Jackson video DVD be WITHOUT including his most famous and most popular video?? This is the video that turned me on to Michael, and it's in its entirety here. It's a horror-comedy themed video, with a special rap by Vincent Price and a pretty woman for Michael to sing to and scare. How much better does it get?

BEAT IT - Another one of the videoes that broke the color barrier on MTV, and, just like Billie Jean, one of Michael's most known and most beloved hits of his entire career. Includes Michael breaking up a gang fight by using the power of dance. This is one of his most beloved videoes, and I fully understand why.

REMEMBER THE TIME - Once again, you get the complete mini-movie, including an appearance by funny-man Eddie Murphy. The Egyptian theme is something unexpected, considering how the song is, but once you watch the video, you'll come to find that only Michael could take a song about heartbreak and make it a dance around the room song.

DON'T STOP TIL YOU GET ENOUGH - One of Michael's first videoes, and it is SO SIMPLE compared to some of the other videoes on this disc. It's just Michael dancing in front of a different screen for every shot. Sounds simpler than the other videoes on this disc, and it looks it too. But it's still not a bad video for an early video.

HEAL THE WORLD - And the perfect way to end this DVD, we get Heal The World, which is one of THOSE videoes. And by one of THOSE videoes, I mean one of those that will put a tear in your eye, regardless of if you want it there or not. If you have a heart and soul, this video is destined to make you cry, just because of the themes and the stuff that is shown in it. It's not the best video on the DVD, but it's definitely the most tear jerking video on the DVD -- before AND after the death of the King of Pop.",1256947200,8,3577,4.224011713030746

The memories were still there but the audio quality was sub-par. Maybe because of my affinity for good sound quality, I was a little disappointed in the so called 5.1 audio. It sound like they just took the stereo elements and spread them across a 5.1 matrix.

648315,5,6303459765,"Well worth it, especially now that he is gone. These are not videos, they are 90 min. visual stories.  And as such these short films ARE historic; complete with the special LONG version of Bad, based on a true story...except Michael doesn't die in this one; but he drives the point home at the end.  Is anybody listening?

The Way You Make Me Feel has a more detailed beginning, again with Michael's character trying what most people do; fit in. The moral of the story?  Be true to yourself.

The Controversial ""Panther"" version of Black or White is good, but I have to admit I still don't get the zipper part of it.  While I don't condone destruction of private property, try to take into consideration there's racist graffiti all over the car etc. before you get all caught up in the ""violence"" part of it.  I don't remember if that was ever shown on MTV.

Everything else is CLASSIC...although I would have loved to have seen the behind the scenes making of Thriller included in this!

People have reviewed this negatively saying that:
 ""the sound and the picture are out"" - This is faulse. Its perfectly in sync.
""the picture quality is poor"" - the videos were made in 1980!! of course there not perfect. The dvd case doesnt say Digitally restored ANYWHERE. Its the best quality you could expect.

I have to say even jsut putting it in the dvd player and seeing the starting video of all the people screaming, trying to grab jackson and him on stage it gives you goosbumps and makes you remember jsut how spectacular michael was and still IS.

You see Michael evolve, creating his own ""brand"" of never-seen-before or since style of movement. From the earlier days of ""OFF THE WALL"" and ""ROCK WITH YOU"" - his is tailored suit with a bow tie, and shining from within smiling throughout the songs.

Then, watch out as he progresses - you actually SEE with each new song, how he created his moves, how he captivated me and the world.

648653,5,6303459765,"For someone like me yeah part of the appeal of the videos on this DVD might be mildly generational. I'm sure it is with a lot of people. Either way you look at this or at Michael Jackson this is the best visual example I can think of what made him such a beloved talent in the beginning. Even though I cannot at all get into all the idolation that plummeted him as the 80's went on (and even here you'll find a kind of over-the-top document of that with the ""Brace Yourself"" intro) the ten videos featured here.....well it's hard to put into words. These are Mike's classic videos,the ones that made him. Probably the first major artist to come from the field of R&B to cross over big time to MTV.And he did so by being a trend setter,blending the influences from his past into a quality all his own. As I did with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Jackson-History-on-Film-Vol-2/dp/1573300403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Jackson - History on Film, Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;I will list each of the videos with a mini review;seems the only way to do it.

BILLIE JEAN
  The video that broke Mike onto MTV features his match point choreography with some very noirish and syncopated backdrops.

THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL
  A mini movie featuring the very curvy Tatiana Thumbtzen being pursued by an at first somewhat shy Michael. Note for music fans Roy Ayer's 1985 funk classic ""Hot"" is playing in the backround.

BLACK OR WHITE
  In terms of drama and even humor this is one of Mike's best videos. The intro with McCauley Caulkin and George Wendt is hilareous. As if Mike doing an explosive dance from behind images of KKK members burning crossess stating ""I AIN'T SCARRED OF NO SHEETS"" wasn't enough,this is the version with the ""controversial ending"",featuring a stunningly angry and funky dance routine. Of course Michael also morphs into a black panther (I get it,by the way) and violently smashes car and store windows griffito tagged with racial slurs. For who he was this has to be the most obviously racially charged imagry of anything Mike ever did. It's a pity he later withdrew it in favor of an edited version.

ROCK WITH YOU
  One of two videos here from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Off-the-Wall/dp/B00005QGAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Off the Wall</a>. A lot of people find this video low budget and tacky and...I have to admit I don't. It makes great use of disco-like projected light effects up against Mike's glitter suit creates this great rainbow of colors. That mixed with his dancing in place gives this a real kind of performance feel.

BAD
  It had been a while since I saw this mini movie directed by Martin Scorsese. Mike goes from this timid prep school graduate out of place with his old friends,one played by Wesley Snipes to this mean leather clad dancer and back by the time the video is over. Nice touch with the ""B&W/color/B&W"" effect.

THRILLER
  I already reviewed this video as it is featured on both Mike's video volumes. For more info refer to my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Jackson-History-on-Film-Vol-2/dp/1573300403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Jackson - History on Film, Vol. 2</a>.

BEAT IT
  The fact that Mike had the clout to get dancer and real gang members for this video is amazing enough. Not only that but he leads them in this dance I can only describe as a funk era version of something out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/West-Side-Story-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B0000AM6IY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)</a>.Also the first appearance of his famous red leather jacket.

REMEMBER THE TIME
  A great celebrity cameo video with an Egyptian motif starring Iman and Eddie Murphy and Pharoh and Neferttiti. Mike literally comes out of a pile of gold dust and goes into some involved moves invoving a little escape. A lot of fun.

DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH
  Mike's first music video as a solo artist is a favorite. He is working his way for the first time through some of his own moves with this tux and oversized bowtie in kind of a psychedelic blue screen setting. Sort of looks like a dreamy American Bandstand.
HEAL THE WORLD
  Similar video to ""Man In The Mirror"",only here Mike is completely absent. More or less a PSA for Mike's Heal The World foundation dealing with children from poverty and violence ridden areas looking for a world of peace. A noble cause if not the strongest video here.

  I am not going to nitpick that many videos such as ""She's Out Of My Life"",""Dirty Diana"",""Leave Me Alone"",""In The Closet"",""Jam"",""You Rock My World"" and the ""Ghost"" feature lengh video aren't included on either video set.

For those person whining about the quality, a reminder that some of these videos were filmed in the late 80s early 90s when some of the high end audio-visuals we have now were only concepts.

648743,5,6303459765,"When I heard the news of Michael Jackson's untimely death I was at work & the whole floor was engaged in verifying if was true. When it was verified, one girl just completely broke down & I happened to be the closest to her, so I held her tenderly for a few. Comforting her seemed to ease my own pain. But I was still in Trippsville. How could this have happened? Yet I must accept it as the working out of Allah's Divine Will & Purpose. Michael Jackson's death will be the topic of conversation for the next few months if not years. As to the cause of Michael's death, we will have to wait for the coroner's report. I hope no foul play was involved.

Yes, he was a natural born genius. Yes, he was a critical component of what we call ""POP"" (BLACK MUSIC) today. But what is his true legacy? For me first it will always be the early recordings, although the later recordings are also astounding. Michael's songs connect you to raw emotion & authentic truths. That is why the people love him. Sometimes there are no words...it's a case of ""SCENIC ECLIPSE"" each song eclipsing the former, yet the former songs becoming standards in their own right. Standards that no one but Michael can do justice to. The mark of true genius.

Michael was one of the last truly great ones, in a long line of Black Musical geniuses, including Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Sammy Davis Jr., Beethoven, Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Eubie Blake, Mozart, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, etc., whose musical truths shone so brilliantly, than even in a racist world, they were able to make a connection based on their authentic musical genius.

Michael Jackson left a immense legacy, & will be sorely missed, but do not fret....there are even greater ones coming....Diamonds in the rough....coming from from the despised & the rejected, coming from the Womb of a Black Woman. They tried to destroy you Michael, because you dared to speak out against the racism you observed in the World & in the Music Industry perpetrated by both Jews & Anglos & their Black puppets, but they were unsuccessful. Don't worry, Jermaine will continue to sound that trumpet. Despite that, you still got the Beatles Catalog. My Man! Man makes plans, but Allah is the Best of Planners. Now Listen Michael, I'm looking at ""THE MAN IN THE MIRROR"" & I don't like long goodbyes, so just ""BEAT IT"" & ""EASE ON DOWN THE ROAD"" you know that you've ""GOT TO BE THERE, and don't be ""BAD"" just ""HEAL THE WORLD"" & be a ""DANCING MACHINE"". Holla at ""BILLIE JEAN"" for me while you find your ""CORNER IN THE SKY"" & always remember ""WHOSE LOVING YOU, Michael? We All Are. May Allah Bless You.",1246060800,11,2652,4.567226890756302

This is an great DVD. The sound and picture quality is very good and the songs and music videos are some of the best around. The King Of Pop is spectacular!

Brace Yourself - A good intro to the DVD showing clips of Michael performing live in front of many fans. ""Brace Yourself""...

Billie Jean - This is one of the best Michael Jackson videos ever released. A highlight.

The Way You Make Me Feel - This nine and a half minute version is great and also rarely seen!

Black Or White - My all-time favourite Michael video. It made me laugh at the beginning and the rest of it was brilliant!

Rock With You - Not keen on the song but I love the video!

Bad - The full-length 18-minute version is a must-have! It shows Michael as a young school boy at the beginning.

Thriller - The best chip of world. It needed to make this collection!

Beat It - A great video and a great song. Another highlight.

Remember The Time - I just love this video! Not only is the song good, but it includes a great egyptian-style video!

Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough - Not one of my favourites, but not bad either.

Heal The World - This song and video end the DVD nicely!

Buy this DVD and never say, Good Bye Michael!",1246060800,15,1250,4.184100418410042
648745,5,6303459765,"This dude could sing, dance, and enthrall audiences.  He has some of the catchiest songs ever put to tape/DAT/computer.  There is a certain genius and magnetism that shone through the abusive childhood, multiple surgeries, and accusations.

I think people were too vicious to this man.  He grew up in a horrid atmosphere and had zero childhood.  How could he, he was paying his parent's mortgage when he was five.  And what thanks did he get?  A nasty, mean, abusive father.  Then he grows up and becomes a punchline to millions, instead of seeing the damaged regressed mentally ill and pain ridden psyche behind the face; people just saw a freak.  And millions heaped abuse after abuse on him.  Further, he was never convicted of anything and it is possible he was the victim of scamming parents looking to cash in; yet most people condemned him as if he were a rapist.  Even if the allegations were true, he did not rape anyone.

So what we have here is a great video documenting some of the best pop culture moments captured to video.  We also have a sad lonely man who never had a chance to grow up.

Thanks for the memories MJ.  Peace brother.

PS. If you don't have some MJ in your video or music collection, get some.  There is a reason he was the most popular singer/dancer of all time.",1245974400,23,1294,4.508620689655173

Overall, it's a good production, and I especially like the feature where you can see all the lyrics.  Who ever knew what Mike was saying before this?",1163116800,,619,3.991869918699187

This dvd also includes the full length videos of ""Bad"" and ""Thriller"" Lets not forget ""Remember the time"" with its amazing dance moves and catchy rythem. This dvd compilation makes you see why Michael Jackson will always be the king of pop. I like this dvd out of all of Michael Jacksons dvd releases. ""Dont stop till you get enough"" and ""Rock with you"" may be simple videos but I watch both videos and see an innocence in Michael before the Thriller phenomenon. This is the best of Michael Jackson. Sony dvd has done an incredible job on the sound quality of this Michael Jackson dvd.

649230,5,6303459765,"You'll like him once you get your hands on this plethora of Michael Jackson's greatest and most well-known short films of the 80's and 90's, simply titled ""Video Greatest Hits: HIStory"". Michael Jackson, with his outstanding efforts in music and entertainment, stands tall as one of the pioneers of music and music videos, and this immaculate collection of short films proves just that.
This DVD (or VHS, whichever you may have) features 10 of Michael's top short films, all in their full-length, uncut entirety!!!
The lineup of short films include:
1. Brace Yourself (A Kaleidoscope of Michael Jackson HIStory) : Although it is not a short film, it does give you a taste of Michael Jackson's impact on the world of music, the fans, and the world, and puts out a simple message: Brace Yourself.
2. Billie Jean - The popular video that single-handedly broke the barrier between not only man and music, but also the color barrier on MTV, as he became the first black musical artist to have a video shown on MTV.
3. The Way You Make Me Feel - A great video all by itself, this video, which lasts nearly 9 1/2 minutes, features Michael at a high point in his career, with his innovative dance moves and impeccable standards for music!
4. Black Or White - This video, aired in 1991 on many broadcast stations around the nation, started the beginning of Michael's music onslaught of the 90's...and a lot of controversy as well. This video, featuring dance moves galore and a kaleidoscope of nations around the world, also featured a scene at the end, most commonly called ""the panther scene"", as it features a panther who morphs into Michael Jackson and then dances in the street, ravaging a car with gang and racist graffiti sprayed on the windows, and sexy yet somewhat disturbing gyrations with his crotch. This scene sparked outrage, but no matter what, this is one of his best short films.
5. Rock With You - A video made in 1979 features Michael Jackson dancing in a sparkling jumpsuit, singing. It doesn't seem like much, but the countless lights and other special effects you will see definitely make it worthwhile
6. Bad - Directed by world-renown director Martin Scorsese, This full 18 minute long version follows a high school kid (played by Michael) who goes to a private school. When school lets out he then goes home to visit his friends, who get the feeling that he has changed, and he's not ""bad"" anymore. Michael proves that he is, though, by showing off many mezmorizing dance moves. The choreography in this short film is just too good for anybody but Michael to perform. This video is probably one of his greatest.
7. Thriller - This short film showed that one man can indeed change the way people look at the connection between music and film. Michael does a fantastic job in this video, with the sometimes-crazy choreography and such. A must-see for any person, MJ fan or not. Directed by John Landis.
8. Beat It - Michael does it again with this music video, as it follows two gangs and their vendettas between each other. Again, the choreography is to die for, and the layout is just spectacular!
9. Remember The Time - Michael will blow you away in this short film featuring Michael, comedian/actor Eddie Murphy, supermodel Iman, and basketball legend Magic Johnson. Set in Egypt, Michael dazzles even the faithless soul with dance moves, special effects, and anything you would wish for in a short film. Definitely one to see!
10. Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough - Michael Jackson's first major music video features special effects and pretty good dancing. Good for its time, but unfortunately does not stand the test of time as well as people hoped. A good video though.
11. Heal The World - Not a short film, but rather a look into the heartache of sick and dying children around the world. Michael, in this video, hopes to touch your heart with this video and hopes that you can do what you can to ""Heal The World"".
In closing, Michael Jackson proves to be the single greatest musical icon that the world has ever seen, and not a single person can make the same impact that Michael has made in music!",1073088000,41,4122,4.679063360881543
649231,4,6303459765,"This DVD collection is a must have for lovers of M.J. and great music. You get M.J.'s newest sound as well as the 80's and 70's hits that made him the icon he is today.  The video collection is entertaining but leaves a lot to be desired for true M.J. fans.
First of all the quality of the older videos ( Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Beat It and Billie Jean ) were pitiful. It was as if the videos were taken straight from an unclear cable channel. This was definitely not what I expected to find in a DVD. The entire first half of Bad is unclear and the film seems worn and old.  Thriller has as much static as a low rated cable network.  The people who made this collection should have been a shamed trying to shove off such terrible copies of these videos to the public.  The upside was that the newer videos were very clear and vibrant with color. Remember the Time is the most beautiful-looking video in the entire collection. Along with the lyrics, the color of the video makes the song come alive.
I loved being able to get these fabulous videos on DVD but I expected a lot more.
1) This DVD would have been outstanding if it featured behind the scenes looks of how the videos were filmed and interviews with dancers, and looks at how the dances for the videos were handled.
2) Commentary from Michael himself or the directors of the videos would have also enhanced this.
3) More videos- I'm sorry but some of Michael's best like ( Leave Me Alone, In the Closet, Jam, Speed Demon, Off The Wall and Man In The Mirror ) were completely ignored and forgotten.  The fans deserve to see more videos included in the collection M.J. calls History.
These things along with better quality would have made this DVD a masterpiece. I pray that the next DVD release of Michael's videos truly stands out. This was a good release if you just want to watch videos, but the cheap quality of his most loved video releases diminished Michael's important presence as a world known icon and music legend.",1072742400,7,1992,4.387533875338754

1) BILLIE JEAN - This video is great. It goes very well with the song. I'm sure you all saw it.
2)*THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL (Long Version) - This is a rarely seen 9:30 min. version of this video. It has a whole beginning when MJ tries to fit in with hoodlums.
3)*BLACK OR WHITE - The Best Video on here!! The Complete Version, with the ending, when MJ is dancing in the alley, and smashing the windows with the car. This is the uncensored version, with the bad words spraypainted on the car. It ends with Bart and Homer Simpson.
4) ROCK WITH YOU - This is so Old School. Michael is dancing in this really tacky suit, with all these lights on him. Klassic MJ video!
5)*BAD (Long Version)- This is the 2nd best video on here!! It's like a movie!! Michael plays a character named Darryl in this video. The long version has never been released on TV. Only on this DVD and MJ's Website.
6) THRILLER - You guys have seen it tons of times. You know how good it is!
7) BEAT IT - This video is pretty cool. The dancing at the end is good.
8) REMEMBER THE TIME - This video takes place in Egypt, when Michael entertains the queen. The dance break in this video is sweet.
9) DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH - like ""Rock with you"" this video is klassic! Michael dances while different backgrounds are behind him.
10) HEAL THE WORLD - This is the reason why I onle gave this DVD 4.5 stars. Why is this video on here? I understand that Michael wants to heal the world, but couldn't he do it somewhere else? He could've put something better on here (along with the HIStory CD), like ""Smooth Criminal"", or ""In The Closet"". I'm sorry, this video does NOT fit in with the rest.
The DVD also has the lyrics that can go along with the video, and it show MJ's discography, also.
Besides ""Heal the World"" this DVD is awesome. Especially since all of the videos are full length and some are not the short ones that they play on TV. Get this DVD!!! It's Worth it.
* ""Bad"" and ""The Way You Make me Feel"" were not full length on the VHS version of this video, so that is why it is listed as ""long version"". Also, on the VHS version of this video, at the end of the ""Black Or White"" video, there is no spraypaint on the car, because of the bad words.",1014940800,30,2446,4.162447257383966

649381,5,6303459765,"I've been a big fan of Michael Jackson ever since I heard the ""BAD"" album for the first time in the early '90s.  I've heard his music before hand of course, but never really paid much attention.  When I bought my first video from Michael called ""Moonwalker"", I was hooked.  This video was amazing and I was  highly impressed with his dancing especially with ""Smooth Criminal"".  I love to dance today, because of Michael Jackson's music videos like ""Billie Jean : Motown 25 Performance"", ""Thriller"", and ""Smooth Criminal"".  After I purchased ""Moonwalker"", I bought all of Michael's solo albums on tapes at first then on CDs, than I bought Jackson 5 (Motown) / Jacksons (Epic) albums on CDs and tapes, than I ventured on to buy as many music videos of him as I can find.  At the time I was a fanatic, I couldn't find his best music videos on film in one collection, so when the ""Michael Jackson: Video Greatest Hits - HIStory"" came out on VHS, I was highly excited and bought it the first day it was released on VHS in 1995.  I was very happy with this video, but a little disappointed that the ""BAD"" music video was shortened.  Now in 2001, I bought the DVD version and I'm happy to say that ""BAD"" video is in it's entirety, with Wesley Snipes and all the drama.

- Brace Yourself
- Billie Jean
- The Way You Make Me Feel (complete version)*

- Thriller
- Beat It

- Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough

Whether or not you are a fan of Michael Jackson, this is an essential video because it shows how good music videos can be. BILLIE JEAN is a striking video that broke down color barriers on MTV; THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL has a loose improvisational feeling to it which makes it fun to watch; BLACK OR WHITE is modern masterpiece complete with morphing and the controversial ""panther dance"" sequence. In the original version of this video, Michael smashes in a car windshield that has racist grafitti on it... he is fighting back against the racism. However, in the version included on this tape, the grafitti is edited out, so we just see Michael smashing a window for no apparent reason. Even so, the video is still an amazing experience! ROCK WITH YOU takes us back to 1980 before Michael's plastic surgery; BAD and BEAT IT include some of the best choreography even seen in music videos, although the version of BAD on this tape is the short version, not the full version with Wesley Snipes.

This video is great for any Micael fan and any music  fan considering it contains 7 # 1 HIts.",968457600,77,567,4.365384615384615
649389,5,6303459765,"Just thinking of the videos and music in this video from the KING OF POP brings a smile to my face every time. On this video there is only a handful of MJ's Greatest videos of all time. Why? Because the man is a legend when  it comes to videos that there wouldn't be a tape long enough to show all  his masterpieces. From the greatest video of all time -  ""Thriller"" - to the special effect dazzling ""Remember the  Time"". There is everything on this video for an MJ fan. Pop HIStory on  one tape, what more could you want?",951868800,13,522,4.128712871287129
