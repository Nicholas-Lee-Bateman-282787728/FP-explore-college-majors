7827920,5,6302562112,Still not available on DVD. Come on MGM. It was good enough to warrant a sequel. Jeff Fahey in his prime. The guy is likable and this is a solid entertaining movie. Wish The Marshall would come out on DVD also.,1366588800,2,210,4.146341463414634

7827923,4,6302562112,"Jeff Fahey is the sketch artist.  A rich, important man has been murdered and Drew Barrymore is a witness who saw a woman that the police would like to talk to.  She describes the woman to Fahey.  As the sketch continues he finds he is drawing a picture of his wife (Sean Young).  Daisy leaves, he folds up the picture and draws another which unfortunately looks like another woman who has done work for the deceased.  As the story unfolds, Fahey is starting to look like the number one suspect.  I wouldn't rate this show a ""4"" if it wasn't for the excellent musical score by Mark Isham.  The soundtrack to this movie is one of the best.  This story couldn't happen in real life.  For one thing, Fahey withheld evidence in a felony investigation that got Daisy killed and should be charged with a felony himself.  Fahey also gets way too lucky in this movie, everything seems to work out so coincidentally for him in the last half hour.  Still, I think it's a good show, the music does a lot for many of the scenes.",1048464000,5,1016,4.379679144385027
