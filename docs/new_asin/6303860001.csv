7855232,3,6303860001,"I really love disco music and had high hopes for this one, but...

The moves aren't taught very well - and I am generally very good at learning choreography as I used to dance in college.  Some of the moves are a bit silly, and don't really get your heart rate up.  They also repeat one of the songs, and it would have been nicer to have gotten one more tune in.  However, it's still somewhat fun, and the toning at the end is a good addition.",1176163200,,443,4.057471264367816
7855233,3,6303860001,"I consider myself to be an experienced beginner in aerobics, meaning I have been working out for a good while now and generally find any tape labeled ""beginners"" or ""easy"" works well for me.  This is by far the most strenuous ""easy"" tape I've found.  The music is great, the sets are terrific, and Brenda's enthusiasm is inspiring.  I found her cues to be easy to follow and the steps were easy to learn.  *BUT* the pace is very fast (especially for floor work, i.e. abs and buns workout) and I was sore the next day after using this tape.  I bought it used and am glad I didn't pay full price -- I will try it again but really found it a bit too intense.",1020988800,3,655,4.166666666666667
7855234,4,6303860001,"I would consider myself an avid exercise video user, and I've been searching for a video that has fun dancy moves and has music that makes you want to let loose and move your body. Being an intermediate-advanced exerciser, I've always been skeptical of ""dance"" workouts fearing they would be to low-impact and not give me a good enough workout. However since I love disco music, I decided to give Brenda Dykgraaf's Disco Workout a chance. I am so glad I did. I can actually say that I look forward to doing this workout. Brenda is full of pep and fun, and motivates you to keep going. The moves are very dancy and you learn combinations to keep it interesting. You even dance in a 70's style and learn moves like The Hustle. It is a good cardio workout and you even do a little floor work at the end to work your buns, thighs, and abs. (Still moving to disco music.) No equipment is needed. My only complaint would be that they play the song Disco Inferno twice. This workout is great for people who love disco music and dance, and are interested in learning new dance steps. However it is not for people who lack coordination or prefer the traditional hi/lo moves. It is definitely by far my favorite workout video.",983145600,6,1216,4.457399103139013
