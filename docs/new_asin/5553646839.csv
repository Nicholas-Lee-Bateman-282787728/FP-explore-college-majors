Essentially a poor man's 'Beau Geste' (Paramount, 1939; 4-plus stars), this above-average George Raft vehicle is a little bland, and a little goofy, yet remains an enjoyable watch as far as period adventure/romances are concerned. The Hal Roach/Image DVD offers a clean, if unrestored, print showing only minor age-related wear (also, there is some crackling evident on the audio track), making it superior to any release in the public domain I've seen (Alpha, Genius, etc.).

207675,5,5553646839,"Nicely redone classic by DigicomTV. Superb audio and video quality.

Captain Paul Gerard (George Raft) is assigned to lead a patrol to the city of Bel-Rashad en route to a French Foreign Legion fort. Gerard is to escort the Emir's daughter, Cara, who has been studying in France, to Bel-Rashad that is off limits to Frenchmen and investigate whether there may be anti-French activity in the city. On their ten day journey Gerard and Cara fall in love. Leaving Cara at Bel-Rashad, Gerard reports to the Legion fort commanded by Commandant Fronval and his executive officer Lieutenant Glysko, a former Cossack.

One night at the Legion outpost, a sentry is shot by a sniper with all agreeing the bullet did not come from a usual musket. Gerard infiltrates Bel-Rashad discovering the locals are being armed with modern Mauser rifles. Detected, Gerard grabs a rifle and fights his way out being hidden by Cara in her room until he makes his escape.

207679,3,5553646839,"United Artists presents ""OUTPOST IN MOROCCO"" (1949  92 min/B&W) -- Starring: George Raft, Marie Windsor, Akim Tamiroff & John Litel

Directed by Robert Florey

Captain Gerard (George Raft), of the French Foreign Legion, is assigned to escort an emir's daughter (Marie Windsor) to her father's mountain citadel and find out what he can about the Emir of Bel-Rashad (Eduard Franz) activities. Gerard enjoys his work with lovely Cara, but arrives to find rebellion brewing. Can the garrison be reinforced in time?

Akim Tamiroff just about steals the film in his role as Lieutenant Glysko. He always assumes the character quite nicely, bringing in a top notch performance.

Marie Windsor fans will love how she plays out this character in every scene, feel she was one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood.  Look for the swimming pool episode, where she appears to be swimming in her birthday suit, who knows, could be.

Raft, in his cool outer crust, gives oen of his best performance, but considering the budget - rather a good showing, for all of his fans.

207681,3,5553646839,"Outpost in Morocco, 1949 film

The movie begins with a view of buildings that must be North Africa. Tesket is the regional headquarters of the French Colonial Army in Morocco. Captain Paul Gerard will be sent on a mission (once he is located). Couples dance to music in a caf. ""Services rendered."" Gerard is the right man for the job; he will find out what the Emir is planning. The schedule is important. Food is eaten without utensils. Why did Gerard join the Legion? Their travel is observed, messages are sent by heliograph. The talk mentions early Arab geographers. Next Gerard reports to the local post with his orders. We learn about the education of the Emir's daughter. At night a shot hits a sentry on the fort walls. It was from a rifle, not a musket. Gerard has a plan to go undercover to Bal Rashad.

Mules carry boxes of arms to the native city. Gerard, in disguise, wins a rifle. He is chased, and climbs to a roof to escape. Guess where he finds a place to hide? Gerard returns to the post with one of the new Mauser rifles. Colonel Pascal will be notified. The Emir warns his daughter about their enemy. The Colonel sends reinforcements, they are too many to be attacked on the road. They pass through narrow canyons. They find the Legion outpost was attacked; no survivors. [No radio communications?] Some were shot after surrendering. Can the Moroccans fight the powerful French? The Emir did just that. Captain Gerard has a plan to attack the enemy's ammunition supply; this will prevent any future attack. ""Take only volunteers."" They attack Bal Rashad, but find the arsenal empty! Can they capture the Old Goat? No, but another person may do.

""Too bad you weren't among them."" What about their water supply? The horses will be sent out of the fort to the stream. Gerard talks to the Emir's daughter; she is a hostage. Will emotions interfere with duty? If the course of the stream is changed the well in the fort will go dry. [Strategy, not tactics.] Gerard orders the horses released so they can find water. Water is now rationed in the fort. Their enemy is no longer united. Moroccan cavalry attack the fort. [Like the Charge of the Light Brigade?] The order is given to set off the mines. The Emir invades the fort at last. The other tribal leaders pledge allegiance to France, the uprising is over.

This story takes place prior to the anti-colonial wars against the French in North Africa. No mention of the oil or gas that made these lands valuable. This movie shows sympathy for the colonial rulers, not those seeking national liberation. This is a change from the war-time movies.",1301270400,,2611,4.645021645021645

207683,3,5553646839,"I picked up Outpost Morocco in a bargain buy because of the title, I wasn't dissappointed. The legendary George Raft as playboy French Foreign Legion captain Gerard. Gerard has to escort the daughter of a Moroccan Emir. The movie is shot in southern Morocco and its landscape looks pretty realistic. The movie made in 1949 from its original black and white composition has a vintage feel. France held Morocco in the grip of a protectorate from 1912-1956, so, during the shooting of this film Morocco technically was not independent. The viewer should pay careful attention to the Moors mode of dress in this movie. Some of the soft fezzes worn early in the movie are very similiar to the so called liberty caps worn by icons in early American history. Of course the Moors are played by Europeans with heavy makeup.

George Raft is his ever cool self escorting the exotic Marie Windsor with her huge Betty Davis eyes. Their screen chemistry is decent but the romance script written for them was somewhat lacking. I always believed Raft was cut from the same fabric as Humprey Bogart but I personally prefer his acting style. If you are looking for a Raft movie outside of the gangster genre, this is the ticket. The movie ""March or Die"" starring Gene Hackman would be a good companion. It is also about the French Foreign Legion but it concentrates on the Rif wars of Morocco 1911-1927 (Abd El Krim).",1154563200,17,1399,4.710204081632653
