8431837,4,B004JAUDKY,"I'm not sure how, um, authorized this release is (my hunch is that it's ""not very""), but this is a DVD of a TV broadcast of Devo's appearance at the FIB Festival in Benicssim, Spain on July 20, 2007.  Here's my 2 cents on this DVD:
SONG SELECTION:  More or less, this is a standard set from their '07 Euro tour.  This DVD has 4 songs not on any of the official live DVD's of the '90s and '00s live era -- namely, ""Going Under"", ""Peek A Boo"", ""Secret Agent Man"" and ""Beautiful World"" (the last one with Booji Boy singing, of course).  That's a big plus.  All the other standards you'd expect are here...""Whip It"", ""Satisfaction"", ""Jocko Homo"", etc.
PERFORMANCE:  Pretty solid, minus a flub at the beginning of ""Freedom of Choice"".
PICTURE QUALITY:  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it an 8.  Not horrible, but could be better.  I doubt it's from a direct TV master tape, though.  It's worth nothing that the aspect ratio appears to have been cropped to 4:3 from 16:9.  I have seen an alternate version of this show (same TV broadcast, but not a rip from this DVD) and it's 16:9 ratio.  It's most apparent in long shots where you may only see a portion of someone on screen (i.e., around 2:25 of ""That's Good"", we only see about half of Mark Mothersbaugh in the long shot of him and Jerry).  Not a total deterrant, but worth mentioning.  (but on the flip side, the alternate source I mentioned cropped off the top and bottom of the screen, which IS present on this DVD...I can't make much sense of that one!)
SOUND QUALITY:  The standard 2.0 audio is good. Everything's mixed well. No issues there. There's a 5.1 option but I don't have a 5.1 system so I can't speak for its quality.
SUMMARY:  Not a bad release.  Definitely some good stuff to be seen here.  If you're a Devo fan like me who can look past the aspect ratio thing and the fact that the picture quality isn't quite up to, say, Blu-Ray quality, then this is worth checking out.  ""Use your freedom of choice!""",1372032000,4,1968,4.342465753424658
