Many famous and highly esteemed people in time have believed in reincarnation...Socrates, Pythagoreus, Benjamin Franklin. Buddhists believe; hindi believe; new spiritualists believe.  If you have ever used the word ""karma"" you probably believe to a point too.  If you can not find a copy of this video for sale, check out small mom&pop independent movie rental stores that carry lots of Sundance films, independent films, etc...while they are still in business.",1210032000,2,613,5.224489795918367

Discussing it, helping people to overcome their fears, what is it, can we attain it? Who were you then, and who are you now. Great Companion piece to Search for Bridey Murphy, or the Reincarnation of Peter Proud. NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD! Also goes great with On A Clear Day!",1208995200,,400,4.647887323943662

I'm interested in this, but I have NO idea what I would be getting.
PLEASE,GIVE ME SOMETHING TO GO BY.",1207958400,,232,4.043478260869565
