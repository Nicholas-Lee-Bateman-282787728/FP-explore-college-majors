7836415,4,6303058817,Very good family western for those who liked the simple western without the blood shed.  I bought this film for a friend who is 89 years old and he loved it and wants more of this style of western.  Very easy viewing and enjoyed the banter.,1273536000,,240,4.195652173913044
7836416,5,6303058817,"To quote another reviewer, this is indeed proof of the golden days of the western and Clint Eastwood. In this one, the crew goes to a saloon in a nearby town to relax, but the locals have a scene hatched - steal their money and their supplies!  One of the sweet lady singers in the saloon warns them, and a good old fashioned bar brawl ensues! But there are two evil lady saloon singer gals who didn't like her telling the visitor to the saloon what was going on, so they decide to take it out on her.  The crews hears everyone laughing at her..."" do you hear that... that's the sound of someone else taking pleasure in someone else's misery!""
They offer her safe haven with them for a while, but one of the guys is kind of bent on getting to know her, and she is hard to get to know. Each individual has their own unique personality such as the one guy who likes the new lady: ""Noone laughs at me - nobody!""
Very realistic confrontations in this series. They are shown more the way hard feelings develope in real life. Character interaction is excellent.
First class western bravado.",1058400000,2,1084,4.361386138613861
