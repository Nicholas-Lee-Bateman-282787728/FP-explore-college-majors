I'm no art major, but I have taken a couple art history classes, and this went into details that put a psycho-social connection to a painting, rather than just studying the brushwork.  Each episode feels like a chapter of an artists story that you get a glimpse into, if only for a blink of an eye.
BBC as always does a fantastic job of putting it all together.  They've got several art historians who review the paintings, so you listen to a few interpretations.  I also appreciated how they show the modern day take of the painting.

As someone who knows the merest sliver about art, this series taught me so much.  What each episode does is focus on one important work of art, like Michaelangelo's ""David,"" and discusses the artist and the art.  It shows the development of the piece, the history of the artist, the history of the piece, why it's important, and, most importantly, what you might want to look for if you could see the actual piece.

This is the exciting type of information you would want to know if you went strolling through a museum.  Instead of zipping past a piece of art, you'd know to stop and what to look for.  Now this may sound dull and dry, but this series (again, at least the few episodes I saw...and rewatched) is amazingly addictive because of its casual narrative, brimming with tons of fascinating information.

Plus they don't just stop at the era of the painting. They continue to the present day and how some paintings become co-opted for better or worse into our modern culture be it parodies of Edvard Munch's The Scream or homages to Edouard Manet's Le djeuner sur l'herbe.

3069333,1,B0011V7PSW,"While this HAD the potential of being a ""masterpiece"" on its own, be forewarned.  The beginnings of many of the documentaries are marred by the intrusion of annoying ""pop"" or ""rock"" music that has nothing to do with the art involved, or even relevant to the culture or influences of said art.  Perhaps the producers thought that this ""music"" could make the subjects more appealing to younger people, but I can't imagine what kind of twit would be the demographic target audience.  If not for the music, the entire set would be a delightful addition to anyone's library of great art.  As a fan of all types of music, be it rock, pop, heavy metal, etc., I still fail to see the reasoning behind this irritating distraction.  One of the general attitudes is the reminder that many works of art have been appropriated for crass commercial imagining and marketing.  This is something that is so obvious that we do not need reminders.  The trivialization of culture is one of the sad facts of current commerce.  In the attempt to level every activity to the ""commonplace"" in order to attract younger audiences is both and insult to the art AND to young people, as if ALL young people are twits without any sense of the greatness of art or its place in the wide scheme of human achievement.  For example, the beginning of the documentary on Michelangelo's ""David"" immediately begins with the loud blaring of a pop-rock-folk theme that makes one cringe with shame.
The scholarship also leaves something to be desired.  Pomposity and ""begging the issue"" invade some of the presentations.  Many of the works are merely works of art, and do not need or benefit from extended half-baked theories of their origins or intended use.  I suspect that a lot of ""padding"" took place when the films were outlined at the BBC.  As a former teacher of art history and a life-long painter, I recognize undergraduate term papers when I see them on the screen.",1359676800,16,1934,4.720238095238095

After watching the compelling Sam Schama, Sister Wendy and the American Crafts programs, I thought I would love this.  I am an older artist who has always enjoyed art history but this series is lackluster and better suited as part of a college history curriculum. It is way too expensive for such a disappointing series",1353456000,4,394,4.850746268656716

3069340,2,B0011V7PSW,"I am another professor of art history who has reviewed many films and television videos in search of material that could be used profitably in the classroom.  The individual segments of The Private Life of a Masterpiece series are uneven.  The one devoted to Rembrandt's Nightwatch is exceptionally good--both the handling of historical questions and the explanation of its importance to Dutch national identity.  The film is fun, interesting and informative (in large part thanks to the top-notch education department of the Rijksmuseum).  The segment devoted to Botticelli's Primavera is quite bad. In this case the editors appear to have had little confidence in the serious views of the scholars who were consulted and chose instead to treat the painting as a bit of Renaissance smut. I would not recommend buying the whole box set.",1326585600,30,836,5.17037037037037

I agree with the others who've posted comments here.  This is a wonderful series, full of engaging information on each piece it examines.  It's especially fine for people who don't know much about art but would like to, because through its examination of the pieces and the interview clips from accomplished artists and knowledgable experts, it teaches you how to look at art.  So you can take the lessons you learn here and apply them to any piece you see in a museum or gallery.",1266537600,108,1831,5.086956521739131

3303829,5,B0011V7PSW,"In typical BBC fashion, this series is very well done.  The videography and narrarative are just what you would expect from BBC.  Tasteful and informative.  Although I have not watched the entire series time and time again, I have watched them all and would recommend them to anyone who wants more information about the masters.",1366934400,2,328,4.927272727272728
3303830,1,B0011V7PSW,"While this HAD the potential of being a ""masterpiece"" on its own, be forewarned.  The beginnings of many of the documentaries are marred by the intrusion of annoying ""pop"" or ""rock"" music that has nothing to do with the art involved, or even relevant to the culture or influences of said art.  Perhaps the producers thought that this ""music"" could make the subjects more appealing to younger people, but I can't imagine what kind of twit would be the demographic target audience.  If not for the music, the entire set would be a delightful addition to anyone's library of great art.  As a fan of all types of music, be it rock, pop, heavy metal, etc., I still fail to see the reasoning behind this irritating distraction.  One of the general attitudes is the reminder that many works of art have been appropriated for crass commercial imagining and marketing.  This is something that is so obvious that we do not need reminders.  The trivialization of culture is one of the sad facts of current commerce.  In the attempt to level every activity to the ""commonplace"" in order to attract younger audiences is both and insult to the art AND to young people, as if ALL young people are twits without any sense of the greatness of art or its place in the wide scheme of human achievement.  For example, the beginning of the documentary on Michelangelo's ""David"" immediately begins with the loud blaring of a pop-rock-folk theme that makes one cringe with shame.
The scholarship also leaves something to be desired.  Pomposity and ""begging the issue"" invade some of the presentations.  Many of the works are merely works of art, and do not need or benefit from extended half-baked theories of their origins or intended use.  I suspect that a lot of ""padding"" took place when the films were outlined at the BBC.  As a former teacher of art history and a life-long painter, I recognize undergraduate term papers when I see them on the screen.",1359676800,16,1934,4.720238095238095

After watching the compelling Sam Schama, Sister Wendy and the American Crafts programs, I thought I would love this.  I am an older artist who has always enjoyed art history but this series is lackluster and better suited as part of a college history curriculum. It is way too expensive for such a disappointing series",1353456000,4,394,4.850746268656716

They will provide you with educational entertainment for hours on end, as they are timeless and you can watch them over again and they will always be current. It's like visiting a museum with a wonderful guide. They give you a complete background of the artists and the time they lived in, which obviously influenced what they did.

3303837,2,B0011V7PSW,"I am another professor of art history who has reviewed many films and television videos in search of material that could be used profitably in the classroom.  The individual segments of The Private Life of a Masterpiece series are uneven.  The one devoted to Rembrandt's Nightwatch is exceptionally good--both the handling of historical questions and the explanation of its importance to Dutch national identity.  The film is fun, interesting and informative (in large part thanks to the top-notch education department of the Rijksmuseum).  The segment devoted to Botticelli's Primavera is quite bad. In this case the editors appear to have had little confidence in the serious views of the scholars who were consulted and chose instead to treat the painting as a bit of Renaissance smut. I would not recommend buying the whole box set.",1326585600,30,836,5.17037037037037

I agree with the others who've posted comments here.  This is a wonderful series, full of engaging information on each piece it examines.  It's especially fine for people who don't know much about art but would like to, because through its examination of the pieces and the interview clips from accomplished artists and knowledgable experts, it teaches you how to look at art.  So you can take the lessons you learn here and apply them to any piece you see in a museum or gallery.",1266537600,108,1831,5.086956521739131
3303842,4,B0011V7PSW,"This is certainly a very good series of reviews of some of the world's favorite masterpieces. Although it sometimes seems repetitive because the art critics, curators, etc. interviewed describe many of the works discussed as ""the most reproduced image in the history of art"", or ""an icon the world over"", and so on, once we get past the hype and into the background of the image all the stories are compelling and well told. I am glad to have my copy in English because here in France they are shown with a dubbed over narration which makes for an unbearable cacophony of voices.",1256515200,7,579,4.631067961165049

This is a fascinating and educational series that makes art history come alive and make sense.  I only gave 4 stars because the episode selection feature doesn't work and one must fast forward through previous episodes to select later ones.  Well worth the money.
