8701258,4,B00TDN9DS0,It is a very interesting documentary but the downfall is it in a different language,1493337600,,83,4.6
8701259,5,B00TDN9DS0,"This is an amazing documentary about the Forefathers of Christian Metal. It is not just talks about how amazing Extol is, but it talks about their conflict with the Christian community and the Metal community, why the band broke up in the first place, and not giving up their faith. I am happy that this film features Bruce Fitzhugh and Rock Gray of Living Sacrifice, Pastor Bob Beeman, and others. The only that I can say is that I wish this film features Andreas Larson (The Metal Deacon). Which there was a trailer of him speaking about the band. I do recommend this film to anyone who are interest it about the band, their faith in God, and their journey.",1468972800,,659,4.5
