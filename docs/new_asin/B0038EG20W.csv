4084410,4,B0038EG20W,"The disk about submarines was fascinating and I never realized that in the early part of the war they had so many problems with torpedoes.  The documentary was well done and the archival film used was, for the most part, very good to excellent.  There are a couple of places where, for dramatic purposes, they cut in film from Hollywood movies but these did not detract from the overall feel of the documentary.  Extremely well done but much too short.
The disk about the PT boats was also informative but there could have been a little more on their actual operation.  The segments on the veterans rebuilding a nearly-derelict old PT boat was interesting and I will probably make a trip up to see it since my uncle served on a couple of boats during WW2.  Two well-worthwhile documentaries at a great price.",1325462400,9,808,4.6223776223776225
4084411,5,B0038EG20W,"This is a awesome movie, especially if you love Subs. The interview with the Tang survivor is not to be missed. Also included was an excellent story about the PT boats. I highly reccommend this DVD to anyone. This movie made the submariners even more exciting thean they already are.",1318204800,,283,4.68
4084412,5,B0038EG20W,I gave this DVD to my Step Dad for a Christmas gift. You wouldn't believe the expression on his face when he opened his gift. He can't wait to watch his movie. This is a winner.,1293580800,,177,3.9444444444444446
4084413,5,B0038EG20W,"This is a great account of WW2 submarine warfare. The material is well narrated and organized. I specially like the maps, a criticism I often have about these documentaries. The video is of acceptable to good quality. But this does not diminish the value of the presentation. I highly recommend it.",1286668800,4,298,4.862745098039215
4084414,5,B0038EG20W,"The DVD about submarines lasted for 94 minutes - the DVD about the PT boat lasted 66 minutes.  While the story of the PT boat was fairly interesting, I could have done without it - if that meant more time had been devoted just to subs.  Like another reviewer, I would have liked more coverage of sub construction and layout.  I learned some things, but I had been expecting more.  I don't regret buying it, though.

Update:  I just lent the discs to a sub vet from WWII (Pacific theater).  He was most appreciative, and said it was the best documentary about subs that he had ever seen.  He even recognized some of the people who were in the interviews.  So I just changed my rating from four stars to five.",1281830400,66,707,4.33587786259542
4084415,4,B0038EG20W,"All in all, this is a very good product, especially considering the price, but as someone fairly well-versed in military history in general and American World War II submarines in particular, I found there to be an awful lot of rather careless factual mistakes. The most glaring of these errors are the two misspellings of submarine names within the on-screen graphics: USS Pogie instead of USS Pogy, and USS Pompanito instead of USS Pampanito. Other mistakes include a pilot being identified as an F-6F pilot instead of an F6F pilot, the Bashi Channel being misspelled ""Bashee"" and Takao, Formosa (modern day Kaohsiung, Taiwan) being misspelled as Takow. Picking nits? Perhaps, but these were all such easy mistakes to either avoid or correct at some point, I feel that I should at least mention them.",1279584000,7,802,4.992537313432836
4084416,2,B0038EG20W,"This was an almost commercial like documentary.  I would have liked more detailed info on operating strategy and boat construction.  Fleet type subs have always been a passion of mine for 50 years when I tried to get in the Navy Submarine Service.  Even for what I got, I will enjoy watching this set repeatedly.",1279497600,3,312,4.636363636363637
4084417,5,B0038EG20W,"A fantastic documentary about WWII submarines and the great men that served on them! Great archival footage of WWII sea warfare coupled with interviews from the men that served make this a wonderful piece. In addition, you get the DEVIL BOAT dvd. This is the story of PT Boats during WWII and the restoration of one such boat by PT Boating vets.

A great set! Absolutely worthy of ownership.",1278115200,11,391,4.666666666666667
4084418,5,B0038EG20W,"""Silent Victory"" is terrific! It is a well-produced, professional effort, a great documentary betrayed by terrible packaging! I'm guessing this twin-pack (also featuring another winner, ""Devil Boat, the Saga of PT 658"") is available at ""Big Box"" electronics stores with other ""shut-up"" or ""impulse-buy"" DVDs and had I encountered it there my response would likely have been ""nah!"" and walk away, the previous and enthusiastic review had me ordering this right away. As I said, this is a remarkably professional effort, the writing, direction, and editing are all top notch and the original film employed is fantastic! There is much use of really well-preserved color as well as clean black & white footage. The music is complementary and unobtrusive, the scripting accurate and concise and the animated graphics are also well done! Interspersed within the film are ""on-camera"" anecdotes by many veteran submariners, including USS TANG survivor Jesse DaSilva and even some pilots, including Alex M. Vraciu, 4th ranking Navy Ace in the Pacific. My only gripe-a tiny one-is the lack of any rank/rating given with the names of the submariner interviewed. I know both Mendenhall and Ruiz were officers but the rest? All in all, ""Silent Victory"" belongs in your DVD collection if you're as goofy about WWII submarines as I am and believe me, I'm mighty goofy!",1272412800,82,1353,5.1826484018264845
4084419,5,B0038EG20W,"If you are interested in American submarine warfare in the Pacific during WWII don't hesitate to buy this DVD.  I was a little put off by the cover art, the low price, and the fact it was bundled with a DVD about PT Boats.  Now that I have watched the video I can't believe I waited so long to order.  There is a significant amount of color footage of the fleet boats in action, outstanding commentary by WWII sub vets (including Ron ""Warshot"" Smith, Jesse DaSilva, Ken Ruiz, among many others), and the maps and graphics are as good as anything on The History Channel.  More than anything else, however, I appreciate the fact that it describes the evolution of both operations and doctrine over the course of the war - a really comprehensive overview of the service history, warts and all (the ""skipper problem"", the torpedo scandal, materiel limitations, etc).  You can probably tell from my glowing review that I give this DVD an enthusiastic ""thumbs up""!",1270598400,40,958,4.678571428571429

4084472,5,B0038EG20W,"I recently received this War Video combo set and I must say I wasn't disappointed. I watched both discs, Silent Victory and The ""Devil Boats"". Silent Victory proved to be a very in depth look at the role that the Submarine played, especially during World War II and the ups and downs it had to endure before establishing itself as a forceful menace to be reckoned with by the enemy. The actual rare footage and the excellent narration exceeded my expectations.
 On the other disc, Devil Boats, the history behind the use of this vessel enlightened my limited knowledge of it's key role in World War II. It proved to be a bastion of historical information that I wasn't aware of. Also, the soulful journey that the World War II vets were undertaking to restore the old PT boat 658 was both touching and enjoyable. They displayed the same comraderie during this ordeal that they lived through in actual wartime action.
The ups and downs of this huge restorative undertaking was astonishing. Kudos to their kind. I wish that we could all display that kind of gumption.
All in all, a very good buy. Would recommend to all war buffs.
