5492116,5,B00ARJM214,"If youve read my other Amazon reviews of British TV shows (or even US mystery films) you will know I hate spoilers. Theres no point of placing them in a review. After all they were written as a mystery. Im surprised at how many reviews give the mystery away  and regular reviewer suggests that the buyer watch the bonus feature first. There are many of the plot devices revealed there. Anyway, on to my review.

This is a five-hour (approx.) mini-series from England (produced in 2012) which aired on  (but was not produced by) the BBC. Each episode runs about 55 minutes. There is some graphic language (not much) no really graphic violence and a very graphic sex scene (with no nudity!)  but lots of sounds

The plot is pretty simple  (this is not a spoiler as it happens in the first 5 minutes): It is May 1st -  May Day  in a small close-knit town in England. When its time for 14-year old Hattie Sutton to ride the May Day Queen float, she doesnt show up. They find her bicycle  which she uses to travel the countryside. As we learn there are at least six possible suspects. This is not a procedural police drama (the police are rarely shown) but a mystery. Is she dead? Did she leave town? What other secrets do the residents have? As I said, its not the usual form and thats why it kept my attention. None of the cast were familiar to me. That made it interesting too.

I found the accents sometimes hard to follow so I used the option for English subtitles. They are probably the easiest titles to read because of size and contrast.

Another suggestion if watching the DVD  At the beginning of each episode  before you are given the option to press play  there is a summary of that episode. My recommendation (unless you don't like to discover mysteries on your own) is to not read these and just press play episode.
As I note above there is a bonus making of featurette which runs 24 minutes. Its worth watching, BUT only AFTER you have seen the five episodes. Too much is revealed.

In summary, I can recommend this show for those who like mysteries with interesting complex characters.  There are quite a few surprises in store.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5492117,5,B00ARJM214,"Mayday.  This dark crime drama, an ITV produced three-part British television serial, from the executive producer of BROADCHURCH, is set in contemporary times. In a quaint English village  Dorking, Surrey that is steeped in pagan traditions.  We join the story on May Day; in this picture postcard pretty, heavily-wooded village, the highlight of the day is the traditional annual parade. However, the May Queen, 14-year-old Hattie Sutton, a gorgeous child whos been riding her bike around town, a wreath of flowers and silky ribbons crowning her shining blonde hair, getting leering receptions from seemingly all the townsmen, disappears shortly before the event, wrecking it. The residents grow suspicious that someone among them might have taken her; they are forced to the shocking realization that there could be a killer in the community, shattering idyllic small-town life.

And the search for Hattie threatens to reveal  townspeoples darkest secrets. Ex-cop Fiona (Academy Award nominee Sophie Okonedo, who looked so much better in THE SLAP, why does she look so tired here? HOTEL RWANDA) struggles in her limited new role as  housewife. Gail (Lesley Manville, MALEFICENT) discovers that her husband, Malcolm (Peter Firth, child star who put himself on the map of adult actors with a clothes-free starring role in EQUUS; MI-5), lies about where he goes each day. Everett (the Dublin, Ireland born Aidan Gillen, unforgettable as Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish in GAME OF THRONES; THE WIRE) brings home a mysterious full trash bag big enough to hide a body. This police procedural turns more typical whodunits upside down, as it focuses not on the lackluster police investigation, but on the townsfolks horror at being forced to suspect loved ones have committed  this crime. The episodes are:
1. The village eagerly anticipates Mayday pageant; celebrations ruined when  May Queen fails to appear.
2. Steve leads the search party but might  just be trying to deflect attention from his brother Seth. 3. Local tycoon Malcolm fails to come home; his  suspicious wife Gail solicits their son James help.
3. Gail tries to deal with  revelations about Malcolm, who is now a principal suspect in Hattie's abduction. Steve tries to manage his increasingly disturbed brother Seth.
4. Reported sighting of  missing Hattie at nearby train station. Linus discovers connection between his father Everett and Hattie, makes a dangerous promise to Hatties twin Caitlin. Fiona, her cop husband Alan row over their daughter Charlotte's erratic behavior. Gail, her son James fall out over Malcolm. Seth's actions drive Steve to extreme measures.
5. Villagers attend a memorial service for Hattie. Seth decides to use occasion to deliver  message; Steves loyalties are torn. Linus finally discovers the truth about Everett; Caitlin provides a revelation.

The box set, which I received as a review copy in contemplation of an honest review, consists of two discs containing five episodes, totaling approximately 280 minutes.  It has subtitles, thankfully, for who among us is familiar with the Dorking accent?  Its extras are: the making of Mayday (25 minutes), and a photo gallery.  But beware; this production contains violence, coarse language, sexual situations, brief nudity, disturbing images. Never mind; in this gripping thriller, while the village looks beautifully inviting, as you might expect, it gets creepy if you look too long or hard. Things move fast. Clues to mystery of Hatties disappearance are frustratingly plentiful, but inconclusive. Impressive cast delivers some fine acting.  And  suspense never lets up.  In this house, we just had to know what was happening; we binge-watched the show until 2 A.M. When it delivered an unexpected, intriguing conclusion. Recommended.",1456704000,,3779,5.362098138747885
5492118,5,B00ARJM214,"I saw this on Youtube.  It is a wonderfully made who done it with each actor portraying their character expertly.  If you are looking for a lot of action, don't.  It was not meant to be an action program, but a mystery where you have to try and figure out who the culprit is !  One minute you think it just has to be a certain character and the next minute you realize it has to be someone else.

While you may not love this program, I think at least you won't be disappointed..  I  highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good, well done mystery !.",1456272000,,551,4.046296296296297
5492119,5,B00ARJM214,"View the bonus FIRST to understand why this series devotes itself to character development over plot.
MayDay is disturbing, paranoia, darkness that descends on an idyllic Surry small town beginning with the grand May Day celebration. Subsequent days of searching for a missing teen turns neighbor against neighbor, suspicions within families. A character-view look into psychological make-up of a community of individuals. Not a typical cop-driven crime show. May Day crime is overshadowed with a story cluster of family relationship threads. Strong actors portray a variety of locals that viewers are forced to choose which to loveto loathethen suddenly change. Deep dark intrigue rather than fast action crime, a welcome change up.

SDH SUBTITLES for feature and the excellent 25 min bonus.
1 == Village's May Day paradewait, wheres the May Queen? Suspects swarm from the Magic Circle of the woods. Caitlin feels life in her 14-yr-old missing twin sister, Queen (both by Leila Mimmack). Prime suspects: the twins dad (Richard Hawley); their Uncle Seth (Tom Fisher) an adult with mental issues and his brother Steve (Sam Spruell) estranged from his family; Everett (Aidan Gillen) who hides a heavy filled body-size bag seen by his son Linus (Mx Fowler); Alan (Peter McDonald) local cop with an ex-cop wife (Sophie Okonedo) who launders Alan's bloody shirt; developer Malcolm (Peter Firth MI-5), and you could name a couple of more on your own after seeing one episode.
2 == Police search for Hattie continues.
Steve troubled over bro Seths thieving habit. Gail (Lesley Manville), Malcolms wife, has son James (David Fynn) hack hubbys PC records exposing depth of loss by Hattie-led opposition to this plans.
3 == A body, not Hattie, found in the woods puts one family into evidence-erase mode. Suggestion and innuendo gossip mounts. Some suspects get a bit of relief while others appear to have more connection. Local conditions turn into violence and terror.
4 == Family cohesiveness is ripped and a clue is found in a locked briefcase. CCTV sighting offers hope for Hattieuntilthen a questionable confession.
5 == The confessed is releasedto do more harm? Village tension peaks. Most issues find a conclusionor at least a reprievesome escalatebut not full closure. The end is left open enough for a disturbing sequel.
If you liked the style of the Broadchurch series, and I did, then you will like this too.
I lost track of how many times I had to change my guess as to who did what to Hattie.",1455580800,,2496,5.058252427184466

5492121,3,B00ARJM214,"The editorial review on Amazon.com is not correct for the movie that is advertised.  The mini-series is about Mayday, a small town steeped in pagan traditions where the crowning of the May Queen is the highlight of the day until suddenly she goes missing.  It is somewhat like ""Twin Peaks.""  The actors play characters, and do mot act as hosts for the show.  The whole description of the movie was posted by someone who never saw it.",1450396800,2,433,4.584415584415584
8556863,1,B00ARJM214,"Weak writing, poor characterization, illogical actions by virtually all characters and a poor morally bankrupt resolution.  This was wrong on so many levels.  In the bonus feature the producer talked about how long it took to get this project off the ground.  Well there were reasons for that, poor writing.  The BBC should have passed on this one.",1507075200,,348,4.948275862068965
8556864,2,B00ARJM214,"An interesting, cretinous little drama of people behaving badly. This series is not a police procedural and not much of a ""who done it"". There is a murder but it is a plot device to illustrate the banal evil of this village's occupants. The story could have been predicated on any antisocial victim crime.  The murder is just a larger crime topping off a general day to day stream of common human venality, delusion and dishonesty.
 It is an examination of an insular community of characterless cretins who suspect each other of the crime. The village fails as a caring community in the face of the tragic murder of a teenager. Parents fail children, wives fail husbands, brothers and sisters fail each other, and vice-versa. It is all rather predictable and static. All of the characters will act out of self interest and self protection which results in an overwhelming lack of suspense.
 Unfortunately, no one is very sympathetic or even likable. I suppose the drama could be an interesting examination of how low many people will go to maintain an illusion of the happy family life status quo. Anything goes as long as the fantasy of ""happy families"" is sustained. OK, if you like that sort of thing.
 The acting was fine, everyone was suitably dishonest and self involved. The country village is attractive and a little unsettling. The music is eerily atmospheric. I think the attempt to deliver a pagan, nature spirited, Wiccan-like veneer to the characters and events failed in it's lack of subtlety. Oh, I did like the dog. This series is suitable for temporary rental.",1506556800,,1577,4.82962962962963

8556868,5,B00ARJM214,What a wonderful multidimensional film. THe film was filled with complex human interaction. T he plot which at first seemed  simple turned out to be elegant in design. It was a real treasure to be found by accident  while I was surfing the Internet for a different British film. A good surprise and value. I liked it.,1478995200,,317,4.543859649122807
8556869,5,B00ARJM214,"With Halloween just around the corner this program comes to mind as a perfect story for the season.  I watched it in the spring, and it is an excellent blend of eerie and realistic action.  The producer of the show says in the special featurette included on the DVD that when first reading the script he felt it was like the American series Twin Peaks, that there is something just a little off center in this village. It is modern times, but there is a sense of something ancient that affects both people and place.  On May Day the Queen of May, fourteen year old Hattie disappears just minutes after leaving home for the big celebration.  The whole village becomes focused on finding Hattie, and the story unfolds.  This is not a police drama, but a crime drama of the effects of the crime on all the friends and neighbors of the missing girl.  As they look for clues, dark secrets and eerie moments in their own lives come to light.  No one character is the focus of the series, it is truly an ensemble performance, and the viewer is caught up as if one of the villagers, thinking this or that person is the criminal. The suspicions cause breaks in relationships and outpourings of long held secrets.  The continuous rain in the series adds gloom and essence to the landscape of the ancient forest surrounding the village and with subtle words makes the viewer wonder if the crime is something connected to long held traditions.  This is an adult series, with more of a psychological horror impact rather than monsters and gore.....who is or who are the ""monsters"" in the village and what is the meaning of this crime?",1473638400,,1621,4.562068965517241

8556871,4,B00ARJM214,"In brief, a teenage girl disappears in a medium sized English town and there are several families that suspect it may be one of their own involved. Matters unravel from there as the viewer tries to guess who done it.

Good character development and many side dramas to the main issue as we gradually learn more about some of the villagers. Nicely filmed and acted - most of the actors are not well known in the States but some veterans like Peter Firth have been around.

I believe this is a made for Brit TV movie in 2012, recently showing up in my video store.",1465948800,,562,4.3428571428571425
