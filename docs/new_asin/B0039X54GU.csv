Now, this is not a professional production, but I don't think anyone who buys this will care the least.  If you're curious about what it takes to make this business work, then, absolutely, do not hesitate to grab these DVDs.  Note: Amazon currently doesn't have any copies (as I write this) but I believe you can get the DVDs directly from Kyle's website.",1373587200,,490,4.809523809523809
8523075,5,B0039X54GU,"I just wanted to say thank you so much for the quick shipping on the 2nd DVD. I finally finished all of the content on the mural DVD's and I'm BLOWN AWAY with everything that was on there. I was hesitant at first, but now that I've seen them, I couldn't have spent my money in a better way. There was A LOT of time an effort put into those, and it shows. You have an exceptional wealth of knowledge in painting murals and I couldn't thank you enough for making this set.",1366502400,,470,4.064516129032258
8523076,5,B0039X54GU,"One of the most valuable things this has given me is confidence! When I decided to start a mural painting business, I only had a vague idea of how to begin -- I knew I would need paint, some brushes, and a tarp of some sort (old shower curtain?) In my search for guidance, I found and and purchased all the DVDs offered by this individual. They been invaluable in starting my new mural business.

These DVDs are packed with the whole spectrum of information - from necessary ""office"" details (client lists, printing forms, advertising, insurance, etc.)to step-by-step organization, storage, and set up your supplies on the job. He shares which materials have worked best for him and which ones he avoids. He draws from many years of real-life situations - such as how to approach new customers in a professional manner, what to wear, the appearance of your vehicle, small details I'd never have thought of. He tells you how to prepare a wall, protect the surrounding area from spills, and so forth. Every possible aspect of a mural business are covered in these DVDs.

Included with the DVDs is a booklet containing supply lists, helpful supply websites, detailed information about how to design forms like invoices and contracts. Starting a new business can be very intimidating, but with the education I now have, I know I will be a success. He's definitely saved me a lot of time and money. Thanks, Kyle! :-) -- LD in Missouri",1347753600,,1429,4.734939759036145
8523077,5,B0039X54GU,"Kyle does a great job covering all you need to know. He addresses Q's that you may not have even thought you had, but would have later. Really covers the entire dynamic of what it takes to get business and successfully drive sales for your murals. Easy to watch and listen to. Makes a lot of sense and is easy to understand.
This won't teach you HOW to paint, just what to do if you already have the talent.
This set was sent very fast and with a personal note from Kyle. He was quick to respond to all my questions. Very friendly and wonderful person. I applied what I learned and am doing very well. You won't be disappointed!",1347580800,,628,4.241666666666666
