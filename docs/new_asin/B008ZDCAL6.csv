8533010,4,B008ZDCAL6,"PLOT: follow the phony $10 engraving plates to the people who push the funny money. Well done.

A Master Counterfeiter is in prison and dying of cancer. He reads the bible most of the time when he is not busy making hand stamped $10 engraving plates right under the noses of his guards. Follow the plates via a preacher exiting the prison and into the hands of the gang and the funny money (counterfeit) is soon flooding the USA. This is done in docudrama style. Don DeFore (Hazel tv series) is the
 treasury agent assigned to find the plates and stop the flow of counterfeit. DeFore is good as the T Man who goes under cover and finds the brains of the gang is closer than he ever knew. Over all 4 stars~ a bit laggy in the middle but keeps the interest. (Watch for a mistake.....DeFore is shot in the right shoulder and in the next scene it turns into his LEFT shoulder.....).....",1518998400,,882,4.371951219512195

8533012,5,B008ZDCAL6,"Sure this is sort of a ""Lite"" verson of the classic T-Men but this one is more procedural and less Noirish in my opinion. Defore was a star of film, TV and Broadway and was solid in whatever he did, including this film. He was no slouch as an actor. Andrea King has become a cult favorite and she delivers in this one. Everything about this film is well done and confidently executed by real pro's.. The picture transfer is fine. I enjoyed it very much.",1434412800,,453,4.27906976744186

8533014,4,B008ZDCAL6,"On the down side, Don Defore as the lead is milk-and-cookies, not anyone's first choice as the dynamic leading-man type. It's those who reside on the dark side that make this film worthwhile, Morris Ankrum as the ailing counterfeiter, Andrea King as his corrupted daughter, and in a bit part Joseph Turkel, a favorite of Kubrick's best remembered as Tyrell in BLADE RUNNER. Not an A noir by any stretch, I still think it has its virtues. At the right price this one's a keeper.",1359763200,9,477,4.623529411764705
8533015,2,B008ZDCAL6,"well developed story and femme fatale, but this edition of the film should have never been made. sound and picture are distorted distracting the viewer.  warner brothers archive collection has released an excellent edition of this film.",1350345600,,236,5.378378378378378
8533016,1,B008ZDCAL6,"I wish I could write a review on ""Southside 1-1000"" itself, which is a very rare film noir from 1950 directed by Boris Ingster, who served in the same capacity for the legendary title ""Stranger on the Third Floor"", which many critics regard as the first film noir. I was very excited to see that ""Southside 1-1000"" was finally available on DVD and that Amazon was offering it via their ""manufacture on demand"" process.

However, as soon as I attempted to watch the film, my excitement quickly turned to despair. The picture quality is absolutely awful. It looks like a VHS recording of the late, late show on a TV station with a faint signal and technical problems 30 years ago. Within the first few minutes, the picture rolled horizontally several times (remember old CRT sets that used to do that?) and even faded out completely, only to return with numerous video artifacts. In addition, there was a considerable amount of jitter, fuzziness and near constant vertical video noise lines throughout. All in all, I consider it unwatachable, not to mention a rip-off, and, as a result, am returning it for a refund.

As a huge lover of the film noir genre, I understand that much of the source material for the more obscure (low budget) titles is not in the best of shape. I consider myself tolerant of marginal video quality as an acceptable trade-off for the ability to view some of these rare titles. That said, as more material is becoming available because of the low duplication costs associated with the MOD DVD-R option, the arbiters of what gets released should be mindful that, just because there is source material available, certain titles should not be offered if they are unwatchable due to very poor picture/audio quality. Or, at the very least, they should offer a disclaimer up front.

No such disclaimer was offered for ""Southside 1-1000"" so let me offer one now for anyone interested in this title: the picture quality is beyond terrible on a PC screen and will only look worse on a larger device. Unless you are the most intrepid film noir fan who would be satisfied with turning off the video and listening only to the audio track of ""Southside 1-1000"", avoid this TVS Home Video Release! You will be well served by waiting for a better print to surface or DVR-ing ""Southside 1-1000"" off TCM, if we are fortunate enough that it ever sees the light of day on cable/satellite.

I will conclude by saying I still love Amazon.com but respectfully suggest someone keep a better eye on the quality factor for these MOD releases and advise their customers accordingly.",1329177600,2,2581,4.754464285714286
