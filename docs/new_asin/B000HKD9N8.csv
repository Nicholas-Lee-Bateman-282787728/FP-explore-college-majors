8323574,4,B000HKD9N8,"This dvd is for those who really love Michael Schenker and UFO. I found the solos a bit dated and nostalgic but i guess thats what this dvd is all about. MS playing style is simplistic but smattered with some nice runs and solo ideas that built rock nroll to what it is today.
The Amazon Listing of this dvd is screwed up as it says Jamie Humphries guitar metal techniques which i guess is a typo or misplaced listing the instuctor is actually Dave Killminster not Jamie Humphries? come on Amazon get on the ball!!..

Anyway most of this dvd is spent showing you the rythym guitar parts and bridges and the chorus and solos to all the big hits of UFO like Lights Out and many more classic UFO hits. I didn't come away excited by what i had learned but the overall dvd is a pretty fare sumation of the band and Schenkers playing. One Kill Joy was the fact that Killminster (The instructor) complained the whole time about how hard and unbalnced a Gibson flying V was to play sitting down...well ya? stand up then dumbo...seeing that the flying V was Michael Schenkers trademark guitar i found this more than curious for Killminster to repeat.

good but not great.",1288310400,,1162,4.450704225352113
