8179111,1,B000NKRJP6,"This is the kind of advice that gives antique dealers a bad name.  The entire video is just a head shot of a less than attractive guy giving his advice about how to sale. He is only interested in white haired people as customers and does what he can to make sure younger people are not present or he gets them out of the picture as soon as possible.  Why?  He says younger people cause too much trouble.  I think the translation is that younger people can see through his scams.
This tape is all about holding sales events at motels during the middle of the week (when younger people are likely to be at work).
There are a lot of excellent experts in the antique business who pay fair prices for what they buy.
The amazing thing to me is that he seems proud of what he does.
If I could I would give him NO stars.",1265846400,,812,4.120253164556962
