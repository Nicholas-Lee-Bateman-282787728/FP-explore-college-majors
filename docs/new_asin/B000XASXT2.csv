8227705,5,B000XASXT2,"Love this video, brings back so many memories from those days.  I didn't even remember that they made a video.  This was the best place to go to back in the 80's, so sad when it closed.",1434412800,,185,3.972972972972973
8227706,5,B000XASXT2,"This movie was rented so many times at the local video rental store in the hick town where I grew up. The money spent on rentals could have purchased 5 or 7 copies of it, back then.",1394409600,,181,3.918918918918919
8227707,5,B000XASXT2,Long ago this was the happening place to be in Tempe AZ....I was there the day they filmed this.  It was so fun to see my friends (audience and dancers alike).  In comparison to today's standards....this would hardly bleep a PG-13 rating as far as other movies I have seen.  But as far as enthusiasm and showmanship the dancers were always the best.  I would rather watch these guys (even though it was filmed in early 80s so graphics and filming are not up to current levels) than watch Magic Mike any day!,1359158400,,507,4.419354838709677
