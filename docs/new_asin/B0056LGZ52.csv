8459743,5,B0056LGZ52,"I recently received this six DVD set and have so far watched the first 1.5 DVDs. So far I am very happy with my purchase. Contrary to many other table tennis DVDs, these DVDs are really instructional DVDs - rather than simply demonstrations of drills. Therefore, the DVDs are quite similar to receiving in-person table tennis coaching. The DVDs feature Xue Ruikun as the coach, who was Wang Hao's first professional coach and who in 2011 signed a three-year coaching contract with Esbjerg Bordtennis Klub in Denmark.

The main advantage of these DVDs is at the same time also their disadvantage - the level of detail is huge. These DVDs cannot be watched quickly when you have a bit of spare time - they require the same concentration as if you were attending a lecture at university, and that's pretty much what watching these DVDs feels like. They start entirely from scratch. The first DVD first gives an overview of the history of table tennis and then define the terminology used in the DVD series, i.e. the different distances from the table, different racquet angles, different areas of the ball, and so on. The first DVD then continues with theoretical aspects of table tennis, such as arc, speed, strength, spin, and ball placement, before giving an overview of table tennis equipment (including different types of rubbers). The first DVD concludes with the initial lessons, which if I recall correctly includes grips, forehand no-spin serve, and forehand and backhand block. DVDs 2-5 are for the most part about different types of shots whereas the sixth and last DVD covers more advanced topics such as tactics, doubles, and physical training.

Throughout the DVD series, each of the lessons about a particular type of shot is structured the following way: first, Xue Ruikun gives a very detailed lecture about positioning, posture, shoulder angle, and elbow angle, about which swingpath and racquet face angle should be used, and about which part of the ball to hit. This is supposedly what seemed ""boring"" to the previous reviewer, but to me it is actually very helpful since it breaks down each type of shot into its different aspects without rushing through it. Xue Ruikun is speaking very slowly, but the English subtitles are continuous and neverending. As mentioned earlier, one needs to be very attentive to get real benefit from these lectures - but if one is then one can learn a lot.

I should talk about the quality of the English subtitles here. To me, who has experience with various European languages (and hence some imagination as to what a particular word could mean if misused by a non-native speaker), most of the subtitles are understandable. However, they do certainly often use non-standard words or strange phrases. There are also some words that have been transcribed but not translated (which, I assume, the translator must have forgot to translate). Also, the subtitles are sometimes slightly out of sync, i.e. sometimes the English subtitles already deal with a topic that hasn't yet started to be shown. So yes, it does take some extra effort to really decipher everything that the English subtitles say, and the amount of information is sometimes overwhelming. But as already mentioned, if you are patient and open-minded (and preferably have some experience with non-native speakers of any other language) then it is certainly doable. The 3.5 minute intro (which, if I had to guess, seems to introduce Xue Ruikun) of each DVD as well as the closing credits have not been translated.

After the lecture part for a particular type of shot, Xue Ruikun starts with the practical demonstration. This usually starts by explaining and posture and stance and by doing some shadow practice, before actually using balls. Each demonstration starts with penhold grip before covering shakehand grip at the end. The video quality is good, and each shot is shown several times from different angles. There are usually also one or two examples in slow motion (where, interestingly, the audio is continuing in realtime). Often there are also close-up shots of, say, footwork or the racket around the moment of impact. The long shots are unfortunately sometimes a bit shaky, and the autofocus is slow with some of the close-ups, but overall the video quality is very good. The demonstrations don't focus on speed - they focus on the aspects outlined in the corresponding lecture. I found this approach a lot more helpful than watching a drills DVD that shows the same type of shot dozens of times in very high speed.

The types of shots that the DVD series covers are the following:

- No-spin, topspin, and backspin serves (with different ball placement and different depth)
- Push
- Half-volley (close to the table)
- Attacking from different distances
- Backspin shots from different distances
- Chopping
- Short balls
- Looping

Total running time of the six DVDs is 284 minutes.

Overall, I find these DVDs very helpful so far since they are very systematic and very detailed. Yes, they are neither exciting nor captivating, and the quality of the English subtitles is not the best, but if you like to learn things carefully and with a good level of detail then these DVDs may be something for you.",1351728000,3,5227,4.931818181818182
8459744,1,B0056LGZ52,Each dvd has the same sequence: one trainer speaks in chinese for a very long time and then present the techniques briefly with the aid of one kid. Even the drills are slooooowww and the content is really basic.  A lot of material in youtube is better produced and more useful.,1349654400,,277,4.431372549019608
