1708375,4,B000065U2I,"This is a very basic dvd and is a great place for the complete novice to start.  The postures are easy to learn and simple to follow.  A slow pace and repetitions make it possible for anyone to keep up.  Plus the dvd also offers features that allow you choose just the portions of the dvd that you want to watch, skipping over postures you're comfortable with and repeating the ones you can't quite get.",1123027200,8,403,4.346666666666667

To follow Scott into Tai Chi, no matter what level, is an enjoyable learning experience. Starting from the first few minutes, good feelings are brought up by watching him doing it and confidence is built up by doing with him. The result is guaranteed. A beautiful example he has set for Tai Chi exponents.",1122854400,,413,4.581081081081081
1708377,5,B000065U2I,"I found that this DVD is an excellent starting point. The instructions are easy to follow as he describes every move very clearly. The DVD has many special features that others DVD's don't have which I give a 10 out of 10 for. Each movement is in a separate chapter so you can select the movement that you want to practice.  The music is also wonderful.

I also have the PAUL LAM 24 forms DVD. The DVD was produced from a VHS Video and it shows. The graphics are awful and does bnot come anywhere near this one in quality.",1121817600,13,522,4.21
1708378,5,B000065U2I,"I have watched several DVDs and this is the only series I have ever stuck with.  He takes the time to show you the moves and the link them all together in the form.  Although I have never gone to a class, I don't believe that any DVD will ever take the place of a good one on one or one on class instruction.  But for those of use short on cash and time to go to the gym this is a great place to start.  I finish and I feel stronger and more relaxed every time.",1116460800,9,461,3.7216494845360826
1708379,5,B000065U2I,"What an awesome DVD. Scott Cole takes you through the moves first with him and then it fades into him on a beach doing the moves. He allows you to put the moves all together during this time and it is long enough to feel the power and smoothness.

He speaks very softly and slowly which allows you to stay focused even while changing moves.

 His techique in teaching, is enjoyable and relaxing.",1091232000,26,395,4.383561643835616
1708380,5,B000065U2I,"""...because he is alive to difficulty. That is why he meets with no difficulty."" ~Lao Tzu

Firstly this workout DVD has so many features it was quite amazing. If you are new to Tai Chi this is a perfect place to start. The music is soothing and exotic, the scenery is beautiful and the instructor's voice is calming.

Secondly, I could actually do the workout on the first try. Tai Chi looks difficult when it is done too quickly. On many other DVDs I felt that I could not learn the moves fast enough so I gave up. Scott Cole moves at a perfect pace.

Scott Cole focuses on guiding you through Tai Chi postures and training techniques. He blends martial and healing arts in order to empower you and motivate you to move in a healing direction. He was named one of the Top 5 Fitness Instructors in the world and has appeared in over 300 publications worldwide.

3. Special Features - Postures with Narration, Postures With Music, Workbook Slideshow, Hawaii Workout to Music.
4. Audio Features - Dolby Digital 2.0 and 5.1

The benefits of this DVD are immediately apparent:
Renewed Strength
Upper Body Warming - blood flow definitely increases in the upper body.
Increased Flexibility
Increase in Energy and Confidence

This Tai Chi workout is the best I've ever tried. It was easy to learn the exercises and I also had a few great laughs because, well, some of the postures and movements are rather funny the first time you do them.

Once you have learned the moves you can then try the workouts with just music. Once you have memorized the workouts you may find yourself wanting to do the exercises outside. The exercise routines can be done almost anywhere and you need very little space to do them indoors at home.

1708381,5,B000065U2I,"I took Tai Chi classes a year ago and because of a busy schedule got to quit. I really miss those classes cause Tai Chi is the best way to relax and exercise your body and your mind. So I decided to start again with this DVD and I am not disapointed! Scott Cole is an amazing teacher, he explains well and he makes you feel great about yourself! I loved the special features and especially the different angles option for the moves I have a hard time with. It is a DVD that I suggest to everyone. Trust me, you will feel so good after a session!!!",1068249600,32,547,4.074074074074074
1708382,5,B000065U2I,"I have been doing Tai Chi in my home in front of the TV now for about 8 weeks.  Scott Cole presents the material in an easy to digest way and keeps it light and interesting.  I own this disc and the AM/PM workout disc.  This disc is a little more advanced than the AM/PM workout disc in my opinion, but it doesn't move too fast.  I would recommend the AM/PM disc if you haven't studied any martial arts before.  I think that the postures in the AM/PM disc are a little easier to do than the moves on this disc.
That said, I think this disc is also appropriate for a beginner.  The disc presents an introductory workout that gets the juices flowing.  The disc menu is organized to help you do the workout, but also to get additional help on the postures.  All of the moves are available from the postures menu.  This is a good feature in my opinion - you can review any posture you are having problems with.
Overall I really like the disc.  One complaint that I do have is that the default audio is stereo.  The default should be Dolby digital 5.1.  The DVD player and TV can convert that signal to stereo so why make that the default mode?  Anyway, enjoy.
Cheers,
Chris",1044921600,66,1169,4.235294117647059
1708383,4,B000065U2I,"The start of the DVD, where you have to go through all the company's crud that made the DVD, is really really annoying. Scott is fairly easy to follow, but I'm still not all the way through the DVD. I wish he went into some stretches, and how you're supposed to breathe and all a bit more; he goes a bit fast, sometimes. Which may seem a strange complaint, given he's moving in slooooow motion, but this is the very first time I've ever tried this stuff; I'm not just in it to learn the forms, I'm in a remote area and have no other way to learn this stuff. I guess I was hoping for a bit more of an introduction to Tai Chi; but if you already have a bit of experience in yoga or martial arts, and just want to learn & practice with the basic forms, this is a good DVD.",1035676800,30,769,3.967741935483871

1708484,2,B000065U2I,"OK, I got this because there aren't a lot of videos that are doing by men or for men.  I thought this would be more comfortable than something obviously marketed to women.

I was wrong.

While I have nothing against, Tai Chi for the exercise value, I am not into waving my arms around to usher ""waves of self love and acceptance"" over me.  What a pile!  Come on!  Really?

I think the audience would be better served without the psuedo-spiritual dung pile that accompanies any actual physical exercise.  Besides working out my gut from laughter, I just don't see the benefit.

Bottom line: the guy is a fruit.  So if that's your thing, enjoy.  Otherwise, steer clear....",1302048000,3,670,4.593220338983051

1708488,5,B000065U2I,"First of all, I have NEVER learnt Tai Chi before. Recently, however, I have had some health issues and I was recommended to do more exercises like Tai Chi. And I got this DVD as a gift. So since last week, I've been practising Tai Chi every night before going to sleep. I can't believe that I'm hooked! And I must say, Scott is amazing!

Yes, it has been only a week. But I've to tell you, I feel so much better already! Now I do not wake up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Also I do not have stuffy nose whenever I lie down on the bed at night (yes I literally had this problem almost every night before)! It is just soooo soothing! Although I think I still need to improve my breathing skills, I do already feel the ""Chi"" going through my body. So hopefully this will help cure my other health problems soon.

And you will learn several moves followed by 2 workouts that use the moves.  Once you get the moves figured out you can skip the educational part and go straight to the workouts by using the menu selection.  Also, Scott added about 6 additional moves in a special feature section.  Very well done video!

I tried a Tai Chi class and was very frustrated by an instructor that tried to do too many moves at once, but I actually got it figured out with the help of this DVD.  Now I'm looking for the next one Scott does so I can learn more.

Don't waste your money on the Joe Bond DVD. You'll spend 45 minutes on 1 move and not know anything that feels like Tai Chi.  Plus the guy seems really stuck on himself.",1201651200,4,822,4.178343949044586
1708492,1,B000065U2I,When I started to play this dvd instead of the tai chi workout I was expecting I instead found rap videos!?! I have no idea what happened.,1199404800,,138,4.148148148148148
1708493,4,B000065U2I,"Scott Cole does an amazing job of instructing his viewer through specific tai chi moves, and this was the first tai chi DVD I actually used over and over for a while even.  This DVD is without a doubt perfect for beginners, just like the title suggests.  However, after buying almost every tai chi DVD of Scott Cole's, i realize his teachings are really just a cheesy ""dumbed-down"" version of true tai chi.  I'll explain why in a bit.

But before I start, I just want to add that I've read a lot of reviews commenting on his ""new age"" babble, but this is not new age at all, this is almost ancient knowledge, and it has an approach coming from however many years ago.  But the roots of its beliefs are most definitely real.

Anyways, The DVD will be able to teach you every move they throw at you, and it will be a very fun experience as Scott Cole is an enjoyable person to learn from.  However, the amount of material on the DVD is surprisingly low.  After quickly finishing this DVD, I went straight to almost every other tai chi DVD of Scott's, it didn't take me long to find out that almost every DVD of his are almost all the identical.  Yes, there are some new moves on each DVD, but there are so many DVD's in his ""collection"" that it starts to get pretty expensive if you wish to learn more.  Your better off getting something with all the traditional 24 or 48 postures (or taking a class even), it may not be as easy to learn, but you'll have the entire tai chi database as reference rather then only a sliver of it.  ""Simplified Tai Chi Chuan"" by Master Liang, Shou-Yu will be a good DVD/book if you really want to get serious about tai chi.

You must understand that traditional tai chi consists of either 24 or 48 postures that go through in a specific order, and when you watch a tai chi master, such as Master Liang, and see the beauty of the moves together, you will understand why.  It's not in some strict rule book, as each of the moves are really individually powerful in their own way, but in traditional tai chi each move sets into the next one, so it really becomes a chain of moves, which any master will tell you is really the focus of tai chi, even Scott talks about it.  Now in every DVD of Scott Cole, he picks specific moves out of the posture list and kind of teaches them one at a time.  So his approach to tai chi is really: move #1, returning position, move #2, returning position, move #3, etc.  To me, this seems to destroy the entire purpose of tai chi.  However, I would be wrong to say that there is zero benefit from this DVD.  Yet you may like his approach, to summarize it up, he takes tai chi and puts it into a kind of aerobic class style (one and two and three and four... GOOD!).  This really becomes apparent on his ""tai chi for weight loss"" DVD.

OVERALL:  If you haven't even touched tai chi before and your curious to its benefits, this DVD is absolutely perfect.  If after finishing this DVD and your interesting in learning tai chi as an art form, do not buy any other Scott Cole DVD.  I had to learn the hard way.  On top of not learning very many extra moves, you will be stuck in his approach to tai chi, which, in my opinion, is extremely limited.  I gave it 4 stars, because I have to rate this specific DVD, not the series.  This DVD does everything its supposed to.",1177459200,26,3323,4.234920634920635
1708563,4,B000065U2I,"I bought this after using the Scott Cole's Tai Chi for Weight Loss. This was too basic for me and my daughter after using the weight loss DVD.

When he says right hand, you are moving your right hand if you are mimicking him.  Thank you Mr Cole for making an easy to follow DVD.",1165449600,16,307,4.066666666666666
1708568,5,B000065U2I,I am going to attempt to become more limber and graceful--I believe this video is a great beginning.  Mr. Cole is certainly limber and extremely graceful.  His explanations of the moves are helpful and the moves are quite easy to follow.,1154908800,19,237,4.7560975609756095
1708569,5,B000065U2I,"I'm new to Tai Chi and am very happy with this video.  As others have noted, Paul Lam's is a good reference, but is fairly useless as a guide for a workout.  Scott knows how most people like to use these videos: standing in front of the TV, getting an extended set of demos and a chance to practice complete motions several times.  It also helps that Scott makes himself a mirror image of you, so you don't have to turn yourself around in your head as you practice.

The sequence and pacing of the exercises are wonderful.  Gentle seeming, but building up gradually until you may be a bit amazed at yourself.  Feels like a very productive workout, and I regulary walk, run, and do calisthenics.  From what I've seen, the differences in form from Lam's are small.

The ""new age"" references are very minor and integrated with the moves.  They help to remind you that Tai Chi has a philosophy behind it, rather than just being exercise.

Scott's video is great for getting into the feeling of a connected whole-body routine.  You can see his dance background behind what he's teaching you to do, though it really is Tai Chi, at least it looks like what I've seen in China.  My in-laws from China, who have done Tai Chi there, give it two thumbs up.

The music and visuals are very pleasant and Scott conveys a sense of enjoyment and fun, instead of being dour or grim.

This DVD I'll use regularly.  When I'm ready to prepare for competition, I'll get Lam's out of the library again.",1153526400,44,1480,4.449814126394052
1708570,4,B000065U2I,"I have never done Tai Chi before and I wanted something easy to follow.  I was plesantly surprised with this dvd.  It was very easy to follow and everything was done step by step.  It is a good workout for beginners, however anyone has has done Tai Chi before will probably be bored with it.  It is very elementry, which it should be for a beginner lesson, however I wish it had more ""routines"" to follow. Overall I enjoyed this dvd and recommend it only for the very basic learner.",1153526400,7,482,4.322222222222222
1708571,2,B000065U2I,"I've been practicing Tai Chi for only about a year and I bought three DVDs to help me with my practice at home:  Scott's, Dr Lam's 24 Step and Robin Linde's Tai Chi for Well-being.  Each has its good and bad points.

Scotts:  Beautiful scenery & (hunky guy), but there is a lot of talking and its a bit hooey-fooey new-agey for me.  Also I don't know, but his forms seemm different of off from the others.  I'm afraid that if I use this DVD it will throw off my practice with my own teacher.  It seems like Scott thinks you can learn Tai Chi from a DVD and most people believe you can not!  It was pretty cheap and I'm glad I have it, but there are some others you should look at.

Dr. Lam's:  Very detailed instruction.  Its very good the first time, but very, very hard to practice with.  You have to sit through several minutes of his heavy accented English before you get to a move.  Overall pretty good though.  A good reference.

Robin Linde's Tai Chi for Well-Being:  This is my personal favorite.  I LOVE SEEING A WOMAN DO TAI CHI!!!  Robin Linde's DVD is such a breath of fresh air.  Really there is nothing out there like it.  Its true that she does not ""teach"" you Tai Chi, but rather what she does it provide a beautiful program with all 24 moves for you to practice with on your own.  I really like the ability to repeat a move in various speeds so I can compare what I am doing to her form.  You can watch the entire 24 step sequence with or without commentary.  Robin faces the camera, like Dr. Lam does but she also adds another camera angle thats shot from sorta the side.  I personally liked it because you can see what's going on.  The scenery is beautiful shot outdoors in like a tropical forest or something.  Sometimes the grass covers her feet, but that never really bothered me.  Oh, also her commentary talks about the martial arts applications for each move.  This was fascinating!  I've never heard any of this before.  Its actually kinda funny to think about the slow graceful moves as self defense.  It was a suprise to find that and while I'll only look at that part once, it really helped me to think about what I am doing and why I am doing it.

I did also bought the Scott Cole & Dr Lam's videos with no regrets.  Both have a lot to offer, but I'm not really into the whole ""new-agey"" thing that Cole's video makes you sit through.  The scenery is beautiful, and he is a hunk, but his forms are SO Different from what I've been taught that I really can't use Scott's video in my practice.  Dr. Lam's video is good too, but his long winded explanations are hard to follow and I had a hard time understanding his thick accent.  I'm going to keep Lam's video for reference and to get another perspective from my teacher.  However, Robin's DVD is my favorite.

Ten Reasons Why I LOVE Robin Linde's DVD:

1. I can easily jump to any of the 24 steps and review in detail without long explanations

2. Her commentary on the martial arts applications is fascinating and unique

3. Its refreshing to see a woman beautifully demonstrate Tai Chi (I can relate to her better!)

4. The ""Tips for Your Practice Section"" is very Helpful

5. There is a bonus meditation section with animation and music that at first I thought was goofy, but now I find myself using all the time to relax (its not Tai Chi, but its fun)

Overall, this is an excellent DVD that does exactly what I wanted it to: help me with my practice when I am not in class.  It doesn't replace a teacher and Robin tells you that up front.  Its easy to use and get what I want quickly without having to fast forward, rewind or listen to a lot of talking.  You can't learn Tai Chi from a DVD, but you can learn more about Tai Chi and see the best of the best demonstrate their form.  Sometimes you can get bonuses like Robin offers.  My advice is to buy several DVDs and take the best from each.  If you only buy one, buy this Robin's.",1153353600,24,3918,4.24966078697422

1708614,5,B000065U2I,"This DVD was useful to a Tai Chi beginner like me.  The movements are easy, and Scott Cole focus more on the flow of the movements than ""make sure your fingers are done this way"" kind of attitude that I have seen in other Tai Chi videos.  He obviously takes Tai Chi seriously, but not SO seriously that it is unapproachable to a beginner.  Scott encourages you to go at your own pace, which is refreshing.

I bought this video to improve balance and lose weight.  I've accomplished both goals using Scott's DVD.

The workout is low impact (lasting about 50 mins from beginning to end) and easy to do even for beginners.  You will feel it after you are done, but a pleasant ""gee, it is working"" kind of way, not an overly sore kind of way.  Like other reviewers, this DVD has made me a Tai Chi addict, and I now work with this DVD every day.  Highly recommended.",1147824000,23,861,4.298136645962733
1708615,5,B000065U2I,"I have viewed various Tai Chi videos, but not until Scott Coles' Discover Tai Chi for Beginners, was I able to pull it all together. From other videos I learned a little of this and a little of that, but from watching Scott's video, I was finally able to get the flow of the movements blending together and gradually incorporate leg and foot movements along with the arm and hand flow.

Scott does show a lot in this video, but you can digest it at your own pace. With each viewing you become aware of more fine-tuning that you're able to apply to your form and movement. He has it all there for you to absorb at your own pace. Learning through mirroring his image as he faces us makes it much easier for me. I found that at one point when the camera shifted behind him that I lost my sense of direction and I became disoriented in not being able to mirror exactly what he was doing. But this was an isolated occurrence in the video, which made me aware of how much I rely on the mirroring.

The video also had excellent continuity. The camera would take you from outdoors and back to the studio (or vice versa) and he would be continuing the flow of the movement at the exact position where he was at the previous location. This is an excellent quality video.

With Scott Cole's video, I have become totally addicted to Tai Chi. Finally as a beginner, I am able to pull it all together. I am 58 and have done Bikram Yoga for 8 years, and have now incorporated some Tai Chi into my twice weekly 90-minute yoga routine. And, I now make time for 15-45 minute Tai Chi several times a week. Since doing Tai-Chi with Scott's video, I have noticed an increased strength and stability in my legs, knees and ankles, not to mention a strong awareness to increased energy and energy flow.

I'll be looking forward to checking out the next level by Scott in the near future. At present I'm still getting plenty of use out of this Beginner's tape. By the way, I would have given this 6 stars if that was one of the choices.

He also has some great workout tips, eating and health tips on the feature portions of his DVD's. The workouts are usually 45 minutes, which are designed to take you through the movements. Then at the end of the DVD is the whole workout which you can do once you are familiar with the movements. So the workouts don't take very long once you have it down.",1139184000,12,656,4.298387096774194
1708618,5,B000065U2I,"This is absolutely great. I had never done Tai Chi before. I learned the moves and Scott Cole knows how to talk you through the movements while demonstrating each. My knees were terrible, and I was stiff. I no longer have knee pain and I can literally bound up and down stairs.  I have now moved on to the AM & PM workouts and the one for Weight Loss. I am recommending it to everyone",1137456000,14,384,4.12
1708619,5,B000065U2I,"Made it so you want to continue. Was a better owrkout than I thought it would be, very challenging yet perfect for someone, like me, that had never done this before.",1126656000,9,165,4.354838709677419
1708620,5,B000065U2I,It is a great video. Scott Cole is a good trainer and the music and his voice were very relaxing. This was the first time I have attempted Tai Chi and I was able to follow him. I recommend this for all beginners.,1126224000,10,212,3.953488372093023
1708621,5,B000065U2I,"My 8 yr old son and I have started an exercise regime.  Since my father has been involved in the martial arts all of his life, us kids really never got involved with him on a regular basis - it was his freedom, his release.  Well, after 17 years away from home, I have decided to try Tai Chi out for myself.  Now, I am familiar with the basics, but you do not have to be with this DVD.  My son had no problem keeping up, and even my girls (3 & 5) got into the routine and learned a few of the moves.  I now know why my dad faithfully did his Tai Chi (and still does!.  I feel energized, and it really does help in releasing stress!  It is a great way to get the kids moving as it is low impact and as my son says - it looks cool.  I will keep an eye out for more like these, but more advanced as I really enjoyed Scott Cole's approach, teaching techniques, and of course how great he looks doing these fluid motions - I only hope to look that graceful!",1125964800,12,952,3.8711340206185567
1708622,3,B000065U2I,"I bought this tape based on other reviews. I've been doing qigong for a long time and I wanted to try Tai Chi. I tried it before, but I found it nearly impossible to learn from the tape. All other reviews indicated that it was easy and you can follow it right away. It was certainly easier than the tapes I tried before, but the footwork was still difficult to follow. I could only do some of the exercises and the ones I did, I tried number of times, but I didn't feel any energy increase or anything to make me want to do it again. I think I am going to stay with qigong for now.",1124668800,2,581,3.9743589743589745

7961424,5,B000065U2I,"This is a great Tai Chi DVD. It covers a lot of moves and is slow and gentle. Scott Cole does an excellent job of instructing and makes it fun to do.  I've been doing His Tai Chi DVD's for about 9 months and have increased my flexibility, strength, and balance. I get a good workout without having sore muscles or being exhausted afterwards.  I would definitely recommend this one.",1503532800,,381,4.428571428571429

7961427,1,B000065U2I,"I felt the DVD did not contained enough material for the money ($50). The presentation of the material provide was acceptable. But overall the ""bang for the buck"" was not there.",1426032000,,177,4.741935483870968
7961428,3,B000065U2I,"It's hard to know, as a novice, if these are ""genuine"" tai-chi moves or some sort of westernized exercise hybrid, but all the same the pace and direction of these Scott Cole dvd's is good, and I feel like I get a good workout/stretch from following these.  Good for beginners who aren't expecting to be doing flips and twists or anything over the top.",1399507200,,351,4.484375
7961429,5,B000065U2I,I really loved this DVD.  It is my favorite Tai Chi I've seen.  Scott Cole's voice is very soothing and it was very easy to follow the correct form with his instruction.,1393459200,,169,4.25
7961430,4,B000065U2I,I am just getting into Tai Chi so definitley wanted something for beginners.  Scott demonstrates the poses well and makes it look so easy.  I thought he was easy to follow.  It was nice that once you get the moves down there is a chapter that does the tai chi without all the breaks.  I wish that part was longer.  Overall I was happy with my purchase. I've used this for about a month.,1362528000,,386,4.162162162162162
7961431,5,B000065U2I,I bought this for my mother-in-law who claims that it is just what she wanted--a basic introduction that she could use to practice the things she learned in her Tai Chi class.,1316476800,,175,4.5
7961432,4,B000065U2I,This DVD does what is says. It's gives you a teaspoon of tai chi. It helps you discover if this is for you or not. That's it. Scott Cole explains well. I  did not feel the chi or energy during the work out but I did feel calm and relaxed after doing this. Well made. If you want to go deeper and try to grasp the essence of tai chi then keep looking.,1309305600,,350,3.7945205479452055
