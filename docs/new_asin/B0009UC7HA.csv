2319377,1,B0009UC7HA,"First, I must say that i have been looking forward to this movie for some time. I am a huge Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt fan. That being said, this is the worst book to movie adaption ever made.

Before people jump all over me, let me preface this opinion by saying that I understand that it is not possible for a movie to truelly emulate a book because the movie would be 7 hours long. I understand that and I go into the movie with a fair amount of lenience with plot and theme changes.

This movie should not be called Sahara and Clive Cussler's name should not be used in conjunction with this movie. People, The book is fantastic. It is smart, the characters are great and it is increadibly entertaining. Dirk Pitt is my all time favorite character in all of fiction.  The character portrayed in the movie was not Dirk Pitt. Not even close.

I can honestly say that less then 5% of the books plots, themes, character types, and dialogue made it into the movie. I am talking about a best seller book here. Apparently, The director of this disaster felt he should change everything. And I mean everything. Not only are the charecters horribly casted (especially Al Giordinos character), the characters in the movie are pretty much opposite of what they should be.

The director apparently believes that the viewing public are idiots and cant understand complex and smart themes and plots. This movie is so dumbed down, its laughable. I have never been so disapointed in a film in my life. The characters are transformed from smart, poised, and clever science engineers to idiotic and silly treasure hunters.

Message to directors. The public are not stupid. If characters of a BEST SELLING book are not ""treasure hunters"" you don't have to make them ""treasure hunters"" to sell more movie tickets.

It really is a shame that Clive Cussler and his masterpiece characters: Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker and Rudi Gunn are portrayed in such a ridiculously bad manner.

I ask anyone who has a serious interest in good stories and good characters to please read the book and save yourself from the the completely dumbed down and ludicrous action/adventure flick ""Sahara.""

I must reitterate that this movie is not bad simply because they botched the book. This movie, even if it hadnt been a book, is absolutely horrible. Horrible with a capital H.

It is my mission to spread the word so that this movie makes as little money as possible and hopefully we will never have to experience another movie like it. I am that passionate about my hatred for this film.

Dont see it. Tell people not to go see it. If the preview comes on the TV, change the channel. If someone brings it up at a lunch or dinner, change the subject or leave. Just pretend it never happened. Im Serious......",1113004800,7,2787,4.632860040567952
2319378,4,B0009UC7HA,"Mid to late April is the beginning of the summer blockbuster season.  Movie critics like me can sit back and enjoy spectacular films with lots of explosions, action, and cool special effects; particularly refreshing after about three months of the film equivalent of gruel.  Unfortunately, many movie critics also get some weird obsession that films should be thought-provoking or deeply meaningful.  Summer movies rarely provide this brand of stimulation, generally opting for the ""Let's see how many things we can blow up"" brand of stimulation.  But they remain entertaining, nonetheless.

""Sahara"" is the first such film for 2005.  This adaptation of Clive Cussler's novel about, of all things, an adventuresome archeologist, is a worthy addition to the action/adventure genre.  It's like a smooth mix of George Lucas' Indiana Jones and Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan;  the action is more outlandish and unlikely than a Clancy novel, but there's no crate of vengeful spirits attacking Nazis either.

Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) is obsessed with finding the Civil War ironclad CSS Texas, which was lost in 1865.  He believes the primitive battleship made it to the coast of Africa, and sank somewhere up the Niger River.  His colleagues scoff at this preposterous idea, but Pitt remains convinced.  An expedition up the Niger River with his good buddy Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) leads the pair into uncovering a hazardous waste conspiracy that threatens the entire globe.  Heavy stuff.  They are joined by a stunning doctor, Eva Rojas (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) who is investigating an outbreak of a deadly disease in Nigeria and nearby Mali.  The evil thorn in everybody's side is the murderous warlord General Kazim (Lennie James) who is essentially running the country of Mali.

The action is intense at times, and the ever-present threat of an ecological disaster beyond anything anyone has ever seen makes things understandably edgy.  But, with that old Harrison Ford-ish twinkle in his eye, McConaughey pulls us through.  ""Sahara"" is lighter in tone than you would expect, pulling it more toward a good action/adventure yarn than a nerve-wracking techno-thriller like ""Sum of All Fears"".

However, there is one glaring problem with this film, which must be addressed:  It ends happily, of course, and the world is saved, but you never really see much of that.  Our heroes get out of one last scrape; dramatically and thrillingly, but it doesn't seem like an appropriate ending.  In particular, the threat of hazardous waste contamination just seems to go away.  There's just a big explosive ending, and the next thing we know, Pitt's boss, Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy) is being congratulated by the government.  I know waste disposal is kinda boring, but they could find a way to make it cool.

""Sahara"" does a decent job of ushering in this year's Blockbuster Season.  And with a movie adaptation of one of the craziest sci-fi novels of recent history, the last ""Star Wars"" film ever, and Spielberg's remake of ""War of the Worlds"" coming up, it will only get better.  But this is a good start.",1113004800,,3099,5.097222222222222
2319379,5,B0009UC7HA,"A wonderful romp w/almost-believable escapes [there are a tad too many concidences here, but...], -Sahara- shows Matthew McConaughey at his best as the brawling, good-natured Dirk Pitt, who seems to show up at the Right Time all the time.  Indiana Jones' Harrion Ford is getting a little long in the tooth & James Bond is on his 5th incarnation, so it's well past time for a new hero, & Dirk Pitt fills the bill nicely.

From the opening rocket-bombing of Richmond in 1865 to the rollicking strains of ""Right Place, Wrong Time"", the movie zooms thru Dirk Pitt's past [including a brief reference to -Raise the Titanic-, a glacially-moving '80's Dirk Pitt film that had lovely effects for its time: the -Titanic- slowly rising to the surface is cheesy now, but *sigh* wasn't in 1980].  Cue NUMA, & Pitt's obsession w/the -Texas-, a Confederate gunship which vanished w/""the future"" of the Confederacy.  We switch viewpoints again, this time to Dr. Rojas, who's finding a number of people who came from Mali w/an eye-crystallizing plague.  She looks a little too closely at 1 village & is attacked by a mad Abab [yes, there are other types of Arabs shown in -Sahara-; there are also good & bad black guys].  Strangling in his grip, she's rescued by a timely speargun dart from Pitt, rising from the sea like a modern Poseidon.

The movie careens on from that point, from the NUMA flagship [captained by the Admiral - William Macy, brlliantly grinning thru his cigar - as he gives in to Pitt's wheedling for a boat ""for 72 hours""] & a fte at a Lagoan museum, then helping Dr. Rojas & her assistant to investigate in  Mali.  Before you know it, Al & Pitt [w/the help of their buddy Rudy] are going upriver to unexpectedly ""pull a Panama"" [bye-bye boat!] after they spilt up w/the MDs, Dr. Rojas goes into an empty well, to check the water for toxins & barely misses being scragged by Stock Bad Guy #1 [the Dictator of Mail, he has no trouble killing her fellow MD] who then leaves as Pitt & Al wreak happy mayhem on his brutal thugs...  There's a 2nd Bad Guy, Yves [French!  Aha!  you *know* he's bad!] a millionaire whose dreams for the future are dimmed by a plethora of Nasty Toxins.  The Admiral [Macy] goes to a CIA  friend [Delroy Lindo, in a nice turn as a near-cameo] for help after getting none from the local US Ambassador [boo! hiss!] who seems more interested in doing the Washington 2-Step than the Right Thing.

There are more near-misses, coincidental meetings, mad Arabs, noble Tuaregs, good guys, eeee-vil brutes, a vintage car, a solar plant that threatens the entire globe's water, & - finally! - the solution to the mystery of the -Texas-.  As i 'own' a larger [6'+, 380 lbs] version of Al, who's named Al, i *truly* enjoyed his ""blow it up!"" attitude ... & i loved his ""lose every hat he wears"" tribute to Indiana Jones.  Steve Zahn is *terrific* as a guy who hasn't met a devise he can't defuse, a gun he can't use, or an explosive he can't exploit ... all which moaning that ""This isn't good!"". McConaughey glints & grins, having the time of his life as the good-looking Pitt, & Cruz is grittily believable as an MD w/a heart for adventure.

A real treat ... & all w/o profanity!  Not hard to believe the director is the son of Disney's Michael Eisner...",1113004800,84,3273,4.554607508532423
2319380,4,B0009UC7HA,"OK the reviewers of movies have done it again.... blasted a movie for being just what its supposed to be, a action movie and nothing more. this is not about anything else and as such does pretty well. I saw this today and both myself and my 2 boys came out enjoying the movie.

Now I think at times I would of liked a different dirk pitt, and maybe a little better chemistery between pitt and dr. rijas, but all in all a good action movie. Worth going to see.",1112918400,2,459,4.1
2319381,5,B0009UC7HA,"Sahara is a fantastic adventure. Dirk Pitt and friends take you for an amazing ride that is witty, intelligent, funny, and FULFILLING. Here is one of the greatest movies of the new millenium!

2319382,5,B0009UC7HA,"First off, Sahara is not a Comedy, but an Adventure with Humor. Secondly, its obvious Gentleman Caller 83 has never heard of Clive Cussler, or read any of his books - considering if he had, he would have understood the first fact. The Dirk Pitt series has been on the National Best Seller lists for about 2 decades now.

""Cussler's books have been published in more than 40 languages in more than 100 countries and have a readership of more than 90 million avid fans. His past international bestsellers include PACIFIC VORTEX, MEDITERRANEAN CAPER, ICEBERG, RAISE THE TITANIC, VIXEN 03, NIGHT PROBE, DEEP SIX, CYCLOPS, TREASURE, DRAGON, SAHARA, INCA GOLD, SHOCK WAVE, THE SEA HUNTERS (non-fiction), FLOOD TIDE, and CLIVE CUSSLER DIRK PITT REVEALED"" (excerpt from bookreporter.com article).

If the Direction is at least competent, the acting decent, and the special effects fun and dazzling, this movie has the potential to become a blockbuster with the ability to continue on in the likes of James Bond and Indiana Jones.",1112227200,12,1021,5.035502958579881

2319389,5,B0009UC7HA,"I really liked this movie, I had never seen it before, I just a college archaeology class and had written pretty extensive bibliography on the Valley of the Kings and more specifically the workman's village...I have been studying intensely for the past year and the title caught my eye, I had no idea what the plot was about having never read Clive Cussler before, the actors are all good actors in other films and I b thought what the heck...I found the plot amazing , I have been to civil war sites, such as Andersonville Prison and Vicksburg where they have an ironside that was raised from the Mississippi,  a really amazing display of history. The only real drawback with the film is the potential for development in so many of the parts of the story would require almost a series to ever make, obviously the book has done this but time constraints made it what it was. I thought McConaughey seemed to convey a serious side regarding history , Zahn is a very good comedic actor, and Cruz  probably would have been a good doctor in real life...but overall the movie was good fiction a welcome  break from the grind",1514592000,,1118,4.552238805970149

He has become one of my favorites. I appreciate the minimal profanity, the lack of sex & nudity, the frequent injection of humor & the un-put-downable nature of his story lines.  Most of his books have made the NY Times best seller list.  I believe ""Sahara"" made the transition to the big screen beautifully.  It held my interest from start to finish, & I wasn't left feeling that anything of importance was omitted.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes action/adventure flicks.",1471996800,4,645,4.714285714285714

Daredevil undersea salvage expert Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), with longtime buddy Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), computer geek Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson), and NUMA boss Adm. Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), is just off Lagos, Nigeria, fishing about in the Bight of Benin for a seven-centuries-lost funerary effigy of a famous king, when he picks up some information connected to an old obsession of his--a Confederate ironclad that supposedly ran the Union blockade as Richmond was falling in 1865, and is said to have ended up somewhere in the eastern Atlantic.  Sandecker is tired of hearing about this boat, but gives the trio 72 hours to follow the new lead.  Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization and her partner Dr. Frank Hopper (Glynn Turman) have discovered evidence of a possible plague creeping out of neighboring Mali, which is currently ruled by Gen. Zateb Khazim (Lennie James), ""the man who put the 'war' in warlord.""  And Khazim doesn't want the truth discovered, as Eva finds out when she's attacked by a Tuareg after finding the body of a lighthouse keeper.  Rescued by Pitt, she finds herself under NUMA's protection as Pitt and Company head up the Niger River.  Separated and reunited, Dirk, Al, and Eva eventually discover a chilling truth: it's not a plague, it's poison, and it's spreading down the river.  If it isn't stopped, it will contaminate every ocean on the planet.  Tied into the mystery of its origins are a French industrialist (Lambert Wilson) who's entirely too cozy with Khazim.  Making common cause with Modibo (Paulin Fodouop), a Tuareg chief, the trio finds an unexpected secret weapon in... yes, the ironclad!  Meanwhile Sandecker is getting ""the D.C. two-step"" from Ambassador Polidori (Patrick Malahide) and CIA agent Carl (Delroy Lindo).  It all comes to a smashing conclusion that may remind you of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Executive-Decision/dp/B0045HCJFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Executive Decision</a>.

McConaughey is in his element as a swashbuckling marine scientist/master explorer out to save the world from an evil polluter in this Clive Cussler story. Penelope Cruz sizzles as a World Health Organization physician dogmatically seeking the source of a toxin that is killing many people in Africa. And Steve Zahn is simply great as the comic relief, sidekick of McConaughey.

This is one of those movies that had every element for mass audience appeal. Why the critics were so hard on it and why it did not do better at the box office is a true mystery.

2320234,4,B0009UC7HA,"I always intended to see the movie Sahara, yes, even though it was getting bad reviews.  Somehow, it never quite happened until I spotted it playing on TV recently.  I can see where people wouldnt have liked it, but I enjoyed it for the mindless action flick it was.

Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) is currently in Africa hunting for a treasure for his boss Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy).  Along the way, his path crosses with Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) who is there with the World Health Organization.  She has recently found a plague affecting certain villages in the area.

Just as Dirk is about to leave the continent, he gets a lead on a Civil War treasure hes been tracking for years.  Heading out with his best friend/hunting partner Al (Steve Zahn), he is determined to find it before he heads back to the states.  But when his ship is attacked just after parting from Eva, he finds himself stranded, fearing that she might be in danger.  Can he help?  Will he find the treasure?

Now, if you are going into this film expecting anything serious or realistic, don't bother.  This movie is designed to be a fun action flick.  You know the kind  the pop corn flicks where you sit down and enjoy without thinking about it too hard.  And if you do that, youll have a good time.

There are some great action sequences and plenty of suspenseful scenes.  I was glued to the TV for several of them wondering how our heroes would get out of it alive.  I never doubted that they would, but the odds were certainly against them.  Were all these scenes realistic?  Not on your life.  Honestly, I didn't care because they were fun.

Likewise, the story featured some pretty major coincidences.  Actually, this one did bother me a little, but for the most part I didn't mind.

All of the action sequences were well done, and I bought all of the stunts I was watching.  Likewise, when the movie did call for special effects, those worked, too.

And the acting was good.  Theres nothing that will blow you away here, but I bought these people as these characters.  There was certainly nothing to pull me out of the movie.

If you go into this movie expecting something amazing, you will be disappointed.  But if you go in expecting a fun time, youll find you quite enjoy Sahara.  And thats all the movie is trying to be in the first place.",1434240000,,2332,4.494033412887828
2320235,4,B0009UC7HA,"It is customary for hollywood to take a good book by a good author and totally turn it into a barely recognizable flick not worthy of viewing.  Didn't happen.  Cussler's entertaining but improbable story remained recognizable.  Didn't even end up with the expected horrible Hollywood end.  The movie also boasts a good cast across the board, and the special effects are well done.  So what's not to like?

As with anything Cussler does don't take it too seriously, just enjoy the ride, it's worth it.

The opening sequence with the ironclad CSS Texas escaping Charleston harbor under attack is absolutely fabulous, the movie is worth watching just for that.

My biggest gripe has nothing to do with the movie itself, it's about everything that went on around it. Apparantly there was a HUGE legal kerfuffle over it and it's not likely any more Cussler books will be made into movies anytime soon, which is a real shame.",1433721600,3,653,4.612068965517241

2320309,4,B0009UC7HA,"""Sahara"" (2005) was directed by Breck Eisner (The Crazies). The movie is like a cross between a James Bond and Indiana Jones film. The two stories that criss cross have Matthew McConaughey treasure hunting, and Penelope Cruz trying to stop what seems like a plague. Eventually these two stories collide in the middle of the Sahara at a large waste disposal plant. This is a comedy adventure film that is non-stop action.",1433376000,,420,4.847222222222222

However, some of the wonderful historical fiction aspects are completely gone and what's left looks more like Tomb Raider or James Bond. This is not originally a story about gold or a girl.  It's about the hunt for history, and setting straight what happened.  If I didn't know what it could've been I think I'd've enjoyed it more.",1429401600,,583,4.462264150943396

2320624,2,B0009UC7HA,"This film, even after watching it a few times, once with the director's commentary, still strikes me as ridiculous, improbable hokum. An action film usually has wide plot holes, with much not logical, and this is one of many of this variety. It is an absurdist comedy, with some scenes being more like a Beckett play than a serious film. The scenes of the two leads dragging that truck liner around in the desert is ludicrous and done for laughs. Perhaps the director was trying to update The Road to Morocco film. Compared to other action films the gore is minor, getting to a PG rating. The plot, I assume, made more sense in Cussler's novel than in the script, but it is the script that has most of the problems: too many holes, and that solar powered toxic waste dump run by the Massarde character was not explained enough. Also I had trouble following how this or that character ended up at a certain place, so it all seemed to me to be a muddle. An escapist action film with unfocused script is the best I can describe it. Not really good. Two stars is all it deserves.",1421539200,,1075,4.407035175879397

Andrews Blu-ray Review: SAHARA follows the adventures of Dirk Pitt [Matthew McConaughey], is obsessed with tracking down a Civil War battleship that mysteriously disappeared. Along with Dirk Pitt, who has tagged along his friend and comic relief pal Al Giordino [Steve Zahn]. Dirk Pitt spends his days searching for lost artefacts for the NUMA [National Underwater and Marine Agency] and the desire to uncover the exact whereabouts of the missing ship.

SAHARA, is based on a novel by the prolific Clive Cussler, stars bongo enthusiast and Texan Matthew McConaughey as the improbably named Dirk Pitt, an ex-Navy SEALS turned marine adventurer. Working under the ever patient command of the stout Admiral Sandecker [William H. Macy], cashing in a big pay check, Dirk Pitt and long-time buddy Al Giordino [Steve Zahn], who is perfectly at home as the comedic sidekick and spends their time finding lost treasures from the ocean floor. But Dirk Pitt has more ambitious plans in mind, one that includes finding a fabled Confederate ironclad ship that was thought to have gone missing at the tail end of the Civil War over 150 years ago. Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino track the ship to West Africa where they encounter the lovely Dr. Eva Rojas [Penelope Cruz], a relief worker for the WHO [World Health Organisation] whos on a hunt of her own. Dr. Eva Rojas needs to investigate a growing plague and try and find the source of the mysterious illness sweeping across Africa.

As luck would have it, the script is full of convenient plots and especially with lots of twists and turns, and Dirk Pitts search for the missing ship leads him to a war-torn African country, which also again happens to be where WHO [World Health Organisation] is. Now in Africa and hunted by a vicious warlord with his own personal army, Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and Dr. Eva Rojas crosses paths with a band of resistant fighters, a slimy Frenchman, and lots and lots of random desert. Then later Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino stumbles onto the wreckage of what looks like the plane from the Dennis Quad film Flight of the Phoenix, but don't quote me on it.

SAHARA is an unapologetic action-adventure film without any brains to hinder its brawn. The film is straightforward in its inability to be smart and true to its dedication to being loud, fast, and devoid of all levels of substance. One would have liked more chemistry between Penelope Cruz and Mathew McConaughey, but in a film where the romance is little more than perfunctory (if that), I guess you cant really complain too much. Although its curious to note the general lack of chemistry between the two leads, as one has to wonder what that means in real-life when they cant even fake credible interest in each other onscreen.

SAHARA is a surprisingly fun packed action comedy film with a cast that connects. As Dr. Eva Rojas [Penelope Cruz] races around on a camel and does as good a job saving the men around her. Mathew McConaugheys who has a naughty sense of adventure in pulling off this daring exploration for the treasure. Steve Zahns is perfect for this type of role. He knows when to take it over the top and when to play it subtle, and he has pulled off just the right balance as Mathew McConaugheys onscreen buddy.

Blu-ray Video Quality  SAHARA has a presentation that is really excellent and satisfying in an excellent 1080p encoded image. The source material is pristine, with not a speckle of dirt or other blemishes noticeable, and the kind of smooth, grain-free look that looks more like a digital photo than film. Colour reproduction is also impressive and hues are rich, vivid and free of colour noise and smearing. Blacks and contrast are also excellent, with even the film's few dark scenes, indeed; the vast majority of 'SAHARA' takes place in sunshine-soaked daytime exteriors, boasting above-average shadow delineation. At times the level of detail and depth to the image is up there with the best Blu-ray transfers I've seen, with the kind of three-dimensional appearance that really shows off the high-resolution capabilities of the format and especially three scenes, the opening credits, the first major action sequence, and a dinner party scene about two-thirds of the way through the film. So all in all it has a great image performance. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio presentation for 'SAHARA' is really action packed and is presented with either a 5.1 DTS Master Audio or a 5.1 Dolby Digital. And the film's sound design is a winner, delivering an aggressive, exciting experience that is sure to please. All channels are active, with noticeable uses of discrete pans across the entire sound field. Dynamic range also earns a solid ""A,"" with a very full presence from lows to highs. Bass is delivered forcibly but tightly, and doesn't overwhelm the mix like some big-budget action soundtracks can. Balance is also well done, though I did have to adjust my volume control to compensate for the low dialogue levels at times.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Breck Eisner: The director is a pretty good speaker and sounds like a smart guy. The track is mostly technical in nature, explaining how various elaborate action scenes were accomplished.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Breck Eisner and Matthew McConaughey: The director returns for another commentary, this time joined by his star and Executive Producer Mathew McConaughey. They all have a good rapport and focus on story and characters.

Special Feature: Across the Sands of Sahara [2005] [15:00] A fluffy making-of piece that talks about the production difficulties with heat, sandstorms, rain, and locusts. Matthew McConaughey explains how he lobbied for the role.

Special Feature: Visualizing Sahara [2005] [20:00] A pleasantly thorough overview of the film's visual design. Covered topics include: storyboards, pre-visual planning, production design, photography and especially the director even mentions his choice of aspect ratio, costumes, sets, and visual effects.

Special Feature: Cast & Crew Wrap Film [2005] [10:00] An assemblage of random behind-the-scenes footage, with an entertaining view of the crew who relive their experiences during the wrap party, this was more aimed at people who know all the technical features of making a film.

Deleted Scenes [2005] [5:00] Four scenes are offered with optional commentary by Breck Eisner and Matthew McConaughey.

Special Feature: Camel Chase [2005] [1080p] [5:00] A behind-the-scenes look at the filming of one action scene, including the problems faced due to bad weather.

Special Feature: Animatics [2005] [1080p] [9:00] Animated storyboards are presented for two scenes.

Special Feature: Storyboard Comparisons [2005] [1080p] [6:00] A before-and-after look at three scenes.

Theatrical Trailer [2005] [1080p] [1.77:1] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for SAHARA.

Finally, SAHARA is a film that really has a lot going for it and something that must not be taken too seriously, and then you will have a perfect fun time with the film. The cast seemed to really enjoy doing what they do best, and that made it easier for me to really get into the enjoyments of the film. It has all of the elements of a fantastic all action and adventure film with a solid plot, and definitely good chemistry between all of the characters, which is why I enjoy good character driven films and there is enough here that holds it all together very well to make this an interesting popcorn munching film. For those who are really into action and adventure films like I am, this film is really a definite blockbuster action fun film and I know the whole family will have a great time viewing this Blu-ray disc, which has been an all-time favourite film of mine, ever since I saw it in the cinema on its initial release and now I have it in the ultimate Blu-ray format, as it is a stunning fun rollercoaster ride from start to finish and the picture quality is definitely reference material and it will definitely make your friends jaw drop in what they view and now it has gone pride of place with my other fun packed Mathew McConaughey Blu-ray film Fools Gold. Highly Recommended!

Unbelievably cheesy action scenes, haphazard and poorly developed plot, lame acting and several obvious continuity screw ups(I counted 4 in the train scene alone. And don't even get me started on the car chase scene). Just very amateurish overall, which is sad because they had a very good base to work off of from the book.

I understand loyal fans want to see their daydreams on the big screen, but it's not often realistic in the Hollywood action movie making paradigm.  Of course, it is unrealistic, and outrageous at times, but the visuals are fun, the tone is lighthearted, and I would go to another Dirk Pitt movie in a heartbeat.",1377820800,,443,4.5125
2321088,5,B0009UC7HA,I don't write film content reviews as a rule because it really is a matter of taste. This case is a little different as it is based on a Dirk Pitt novel. The operative word is based so I disagree with those that would attack it from that perspective. As a B grade novel the story works but I don't think so for film because of time limitations and pace. The screen writers in my opinion did a spectacular job with this. The action flows and flows with comic relief still managing to utilize most of the key elements of the novel. The casting was also great though that too would not really match the characters of the novel franchise. The reason for a late time review is I have had the movie for years but only recently read the book. It's too bad in my opinion that the novels were not made as a trilogy movie franchise and the basic characters played by these actors would have been just fine.,1377820800,,896,4.245614035087719

2321119,4,B0009UC7HA,"Sahara is a shiny big budget picture taken from the Clive Cussler ""Dirk Pitt"" novels. Overall I think the budget is what killed it with the studio. With less money and media hype the movie would have had a shot. The performances are consistent and entertaining. Steve Zahn nails many aspects of the Al Giordino character, William H Macy is Jim Sandecker and Matthew McConaughey is probably the weakest like but still makes Dirk Pitt rougish and likeable.

When budgets are large people often forget some movies are just supposed to be fun. This film is not art but is a film worth watching and it doomed the other books in the series like Iceberg, Inca Gold and Atlantis Found which would have translated well to the big screen.",1374105600,,728,4.6434108527131785

2321211,4,B0009UC7HA,"This is definitely on my top 10 movie list! Matthew McConaughey effortlessly captures Dirk Pitt's charisma and bravado, and never has there been a more perennial movie sidekick than Steve Zahn, a perfect Al Giordino. I can't read a Dirk Pitt novel now without picturing William H. Macy as Sandecker. And Penelope Cruz's Eva Rojas is able to stand toe-to-toe with Dirk each step of the way. But a perfect cast is only part of the brilliance of this movie. The African landscape paired with Clint Mansell's score effortlessly pull you in, from the ride up the Niger to the final battle in the desert. A great watch for Clive Cussler fans as well as those just looking for a good time!

Side note: As a fan of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels, I would love to throttle whoever it was that started that stupid Sahara lawsuit. It is an absolute crime to not make more movies out of those novels.",1365033600,,890,4.527950310559007

This seems like a reasonable representation of his work, but with a more comical twist that I wouldn't expect in his books.  Still it was worth watching.  It was well acted and directed.  Some historical fiction, action, intrigue; all of the stuff it takes to hang a good action movie together.  Some violence, disturbing images of affected victims, but no bad language, nudity.

This is one of those movies that you get to cheer on the good guys, the bad guys are believeable, and the usual twist is also included.  I also enjoy that there is little cursing in the movie.  I get so tired of hearing every other word of OMG, etc.  I want dialogue, not slang.  I watch this frequently to enjoy a good modern movie.",1360540800,,627,4.486725663716814

But show me an action/adventure that doesn't stretch it and I'll show you a boring film.  The best part of this film was the lack of swearing and lewd behavior or attire, over-the-top violence and gore.  I watched this movie with my 15y old daughter and 12y old son and had nothing to be embarrassed about. They loved it. The acting was good, the cinematography outstanding, the characters likeable, non-conflicted and fun.  The only knock I could give this was the soundtrack - some of the tunes seemed out of place for the movie, however the Clint Mansell song played throughout the movie and at the closing credits was perfect, and addicting - I have been whistling it ever since.

It is one of the best we have watched and has some of the most halarious and creative moments.  They are not cookie cutter one liners like so many movies now. I have to admit some of the plot is pretty ridiculous but is an adventure that is fun and the whole family can watch.  It is my kids (girls 10 and 7) favorite movie as well.

Vehicles have bullet holes in them but when the heroes are riding in them and bullets hit, they spark but don't leave holes.

A fiberglass boat repels bullets on some parts but not on on other parts, it even repels bullets from a Jeep mounted 50 cal.

They ""pull a Panama"" and the boat blows up, which it would not have blown up especially that fast, and it blows up one of the bad guy's boats.  The other bad guy boat is clearly visible and untouched but they swim to shore with no pursuit.  They also look like they are standing on something in the water and they are all together even though one of them bailed out about 200 yards before the others.

But that's the problem, I could fill five pages with the goofs or careless science.  I can do this with almost any Hollywood movie, but this one is completely over the top.

Of course everyone's reaction to films is a personal issue, but it can be noted that the film received no major awards or even nominations for awards in a year (2005) that didn't exactly produce an outstanding list of films. Bottom line - give this one a miss.",1306713600,7,625,4.796296296296297
2321406,3,B0009UC7HA,"Sahara (2005) is an action adventure that largely delivers what you expect from a big budget film of this type, a likeable hero, a beautiful damsel, exotic locations, epic scale, cool action sequences, a touch of humor, a little romance, an ancient mystery, and hidden treasure.  Except for a major bad guy, it's all there, packaged within a decently constructed story.

The film is based on a Dirk Pitt novel, one of over a dozen written by Clive Clussler, whose first book featuring the character was published in 1973.  While the books featuring Pitt, an ex-Navy officer turned salvage expert, may be fertile material with cinematic possibilities, prior to Sahara, only Raise The Titanic (1976) had been made into a feature film in 1980.  Cussler had apparently been so dissatisfied with the way Raise the Titanic had turned out, that he refused to permit any of his other Pitt novels to be made into films for over 20 years.

Mathew McConaughey had great interest in playing Dirk Pitt, and contacted Cussler to discuss the possibility.  Eventually Cussler agreed to McConaughey playing his beloved character, although the actor had to agree to dye his hair dark, and wear green contact lenses, to match Cussler's description of Pitt.  With script approval, Cussler greenlighted the production, however he later had major objections, and took legal action against the production company.

The movie incorporates many of the major elements from the book, a winding tale centered on Pitt's search for the CSS Texas, a US Civil War ironclad, he believes is lost somewhere in the African desert.  As ironclads were not the most seaworthy of craft, the possibility that one travelled from the east coast of America to Nigeria, would seem to be quite remote, but that is the premise here.

Dirk Pitt fans may have strong feelings about how the character is presented, and how well the novel is translated to the screen.  Those without preconceptions, may regard Sahara as just another adventure in the style of Indiana Jones, with some James Bond influences.  Dirk Pitt comes across as a rather generic, nice guy hero type, who while not seeming particularly nautical, is perhaps more affable than in the books.  The principal casting is solid, with Steve Zahn as Pitt's best buddy Al Giordino, William H. Macy as James Sandecker, the head of NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency), and Penelope Cruz as doctor Eva Rojas.

After rescuing doctor Dr. Rojas in Lagos, Nigeria, Pitt convinces his boss Sandecker, to allow him to head up the Niger River in a NUMA boat, to follow an obscure clue.  Eva Rojas hitches a ride on Pitt's boat to Mali, before departing to find the source of a plague.  General Kazim (Lennie James) the ruler of Mali, is colluding with businessman Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson) who is running a secret solar power plant in the middle of the desert, that is poisoning the water supply.  Kazim attempts to eliminate both the medical team, and the NUMA expedition.  Pitt's boat is attacked, and sunk.  Proceeding through the desert via camel, Dirk and Al manage to find Eva, just after her medical team has been massacred by Kazim's men.  While travelling by Jeep, the group is taken in by natives, the Tuaregs, and taken to their city in the desert.  There they meet Madibo (Paulin Fodoup), the Tuareg leader, and Al discovers a clue to the location of an ironclad in the desert.  The stage is set for an eventful final act, where the heroes discover the secret plant, the remnants of a lost airplane, and buried below the desert sands, the long lost CSS Texas.  The buildup is nicely done, but with Kazim attacking in a helicopter, the end of the conclusive chase is a little lame.  While the reality factor is low, overall the film is a pretty lively and entertaining romp, with a lighthearted tone.

Regarded as a box office bomb, Sahara had a massive budget reportedly topping $130 million, and has apparently yet to make a profit.  Also part of the baggage that has become attached to the film, is the falling out with author Clive Clusser, which resulted in a lawsuit being filed against the production company, who in turn countersued Cussler.  The cases have gone to trial and the appeals process.  Judgments have been rendered, but a final resolution has apparently yet to be reached.  Odds are, we won't be seeing any new Dirk Pitt films anytime soon.

Among the many special features are two commentary tracks, one with director Breck Eisner, and a second with Eisner and Mathew McConaughy.  The first is more informative technically, while the second is more informal.  Besides being the star, McConaughy served as an executive producer, and was crucial in making the project a reality.  Clive Cussler's involvement is briefly discussed, but there is no mention of any legal matters.",1294444800,3,4819,4.880835380835381

I love that Dirk Pitt runs around saving everyone in the world, getting out of tight spots with only a screwdriver and always gets the woman.

In realty Dirk is a combo of the two- sexy, drives nice cars when he can, takes care of the woman around him and yet able to get out of tight spots with nothing but his wits and a few odds and ends.

This movie lived up to my expectations of great fun.

Others have reviewed and covered the plot far more deeply than I can. Needless to say, the hero saved the day, saved the girl, saved the world and saved his best friend. He got a cool car out of the deal and a kiss from the girl and had fun doing it.

2321461,4,B0009UC7HA,"My first comment is, don't try to take this film too seriously! Sahara is one of those misunderstood, underrated movie in recent years. I found it to be (mostly) lighthearted, campy, fun, and even a little bit dumb ...and reminiscent of the original Indiana Jones (Lost Ark, not the other three).

It got awful ratings by critics (38% on Rotten Tomatoes), and I think many people were expecting another National Treasure. I'm not sure why they drew the comparison - just because they came out at the same time? But I actually enjoyed this more than National Treasure (and even more than Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skulls), simply because it didn't take itself too seriously.

The film did tip it's hat to a few serious social issues (some of the corruption in African governments, lack of humanitarian aid, and most importantly, the corporations trying to corner the natural resources markets). But mostly, this was lighthearted and fun - windsurfing through the desert, diving, flying, racing, chasing, etc.

And the casting was simply perfect. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of Matthew McConaughey, but he was perfect for this role. Steve Zahn added a LOT to this film as the sidekick, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz and Delroy Lindo were wonderful, and William H. Macy was brilliant.

I frankly was expecting something like Blood Diamonds (an excellent, excelling film) or National Treasure. Instead I was pleasantly surprised - I found it to be a breath of fresh air.

Yes the villains were a bit over-the-top. The plot was a bit absurd but straightforward nonetheless (I simply cannot understand people who were confused by this, or said there were too many twists and turns) - it's a simple adventure movie that made me smile.

I'm usually not into pop/pulp fiction novels, but seeing the movie actually made me pick up some Clive Cussler novels. I hope they make more of these films!",1243296000,,1880,4.89622641509434

Actually, I preferred Jordan as Pitt.  He was an actor who can be truly menacing and was damned good looking. McCounaghy looks to much like a southern California surfer than a deadly agent.

If a book appears on the shelf with Clive Cussler or even NUMA files - It is immediately bought.  I saw the film Sahara - What a dissapointment.  The actors were very much less than convincing.  The thread of the book was totally lost in the movie.  Somewhere so was Abraham Lincoln.  The story plot was very much lost and re-written in the movie.  If I were Clive Cussler and wrote this book and then saw the movie - I don't think I would recognize it as the same thing.  In my final opinion movie very poorly done.

2321494,3,B0009UC7HA,"The producers of Sahara might have done well to have considered how well the previous attempt to bring one of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels to the screen went before pouring a hundred or so million dollars into it even before Cussler launched an ill-fated lawsuit against the end product. While it's not as dull as Raise the Titanic, it didn't exactly set the box-office on fire let alone kickstart a new Indiana Jones-style franchise about the maritime treasure hunter that the studio so desperately wanted. It's not that hard to figure out why. Matthew ""Naked Bongos"" McConaughey and Penelope Cruz make for an unsurprisingly bland pair of leads, not helped by a plodding script that, after a terrific prologue in the American Civil War, pretty much traipses along with only a single boat chase to hold your attention until an action-packed last half hour finally wakes the film up. The outlandish premise - McConaughey's hunting a Civil War ironclad ship in the Sahara desert while Cruz is tracking the source of a new disease that threatens to poison the continent and beyond - works rather better than it should and the film's other MaGuffin, a solar-powered toxic waste disposal plant, must have had the Bond people kicking themselves that they didn't think of it first, but not well enough to make up for the lack of any chemical reactions among the cast.

I wrote the above review after watching the DVD and have since purchased the HD DVD to increase the video and audio quality for future viewing.
I am however EXTREMLY disappointed with the HD DVD version. There is no visible increase in picture quality and for some reason the audio is poor. The soundtrack on the DVD rattles the windows but this version hardly breaks into a sweat.
I do have an XA2 and the upscaling it does of good quality DVDs is astounding, this maybe why there is no increase in video quality, it doesn't however explain a huge drop off in audio quality. Whenever I fully re watch this movie, I will play the DVD instead.

I will tell you though, Matthew is PERFECT as Dirk and Steve (while totally different than Al Giordino) embodies the role in great spirit.

I'm sure somebody might disagree, but if you ask me, as someone who takes a film for what it is, I'd say this one's a definite keeper!

The HD DVD picture is astonishing (of course the camera crew has their role in that too) and the aduio is engaging (although among the many choices Dolby True HD is not one of them - the DD+ is still great), well edited film all the way around!

There are really only two things I have to tell you about to prove this movie stupid, I don't even have to talk about the awful acting or the crazy nonsense plot. one, they shoot down a helicopter with a Civil War cannon that's been buried under the sand in the SAHARA desert for 150 years, and an armored column surrenders to cavalry.

Here's why that's so insanely stupid for all those who don't get it, and I'm going to use historical examples to prove it. During the battle of Gettysburg the army of Northern Virginia opened fire on the union army with their long ranged cannon, and MISSED! They couldn't even hit an army. now, fast forward to the modern day, give a cannon that's been buried under the sand since the end of the war to three Indiana Jones want to be's and give them the most impossible target to hit, a helicopter. What do you think happens? Well, they shoot it down, duh.

Second, an entire armored column, I think there must have been more then a dozen tanks, surrenders to an enemy army on horse back. Now, does anyone remember when the Polish army fought German tanks during WWII? Anyone? Well I'll tell you, uh, they died. Yeah, they all got killed because there is no possible way for mounted cavalry to defeat armor, and yet the tankers in this movie didn't seem to know that. Pathetic.

There's a lot more I could rant about, like how on earth could a Civil War battleship get to the Sahara desert, but I think I've made my point. This movie is simply one of the dumbest ever made, and I've seen some doozies. Stay away, for the love of god, stay away from this flick and just see Indiana Jones.

Overall the character of Dirk Pitt being played by Matthew McConaughey to be pretty spot on.  Zahn as Al Giordino was not cast well, however, as he looks nothing like Cussler's character from the several books Al has been in.  Besides that, the story is great and the ""thrill of the chase"" is always done right.  The scenes in the desert were fun and remind you of Indiana Jones movies perhaps.

2321584,4,B0009UC7HA,"Clive Cussler's books featuring Dirk Pitt have always been a favorite of mine.  That's a bit of a guilty pleasure.  Cussler's characters could better be called caricatures.  His plots are also larger than life -- no one could suspend disbelief enough to think that the things Cussler dreams up for his hero Dirk Pitt could ever happen in real life.

But that does not stop me from enjoying the books.  Cussler's lively imagination captures me in his make-believe world for a time.  And his almost self-parodying characters always entertain as an escape from real life people.

The movie Sahara is the same way.  It's just as fun to watch as the book Sahara is to read.

Yes, it's true that the movie does not follow the book.  That's probably a good thing.  Cussler's novels would not translate well to the movie screen if the translation were too direct.  Cussler's intricate plotting, his attention to detail (as in his detailed description of each classic car that appears in any book), and his rather cartoonish dialogue work in his books.  They would look foolish in a movie.

As a movie, Sahara works best as a family picture.  Adults will probably find it entertaining enough.  Children will find it easy to understand, with enough humor and surprises to keep their interest.

Definitely not a must-see film.  But everyone in our family liked it.  Both adults, and both children.  Everyone thumbs up.  That's pretty rare.",1172448000,14,1428,4.842323651452282

2321586,4,B0009UC7HA,"""Sahara"" had less than a stellar turn out at the box office upon its initial release and I happened to let it slip by my radar at the time.  I had read the novel upon which the film was based and thought it stupid but fun and I expected the film to be about the same but with more emphasis on the former than the latter.  Well I was a bit wrong on that score.  Sure, ""Sahara"" isn't going to win awards for smarts but hey this is an action adventure film and it doesen't pretend to be anything but that.  Fortunately thats what makes this film stand out from a lot of others of its kind.  Its concerned only with providing good old fashioned actioneer fun; nothing more and nothing less and it succeeds quite well with those simple ambitions.

Now if your a hardcore Cussler/Dirk Pitt fan you may be disappointed with the fact that the films characterizations are not the same as the ones in the book but I will argue that the movie does a good job of at least staying true to the spirit of those characters.  Frankly I'm not overly impressed with Cussler's writing.  His characrers are flat and his dialog is laughable.  For example, his villains are right out of some old pulp or movie serial and will actually say things like: ""The American devils have foiled our plans and now they must die!!""  I kid you not, that is not an exaggeration of typical Cussler dialog.  You can see how that may not translate well to film and fortunately the film makers are able to make the dialog and story a bit smarter than the original material upon which it is based.  Anyway, the actors are fine and are having a great time and the direction and cinematography are above average.  My only real complaint is an over reliance on classic rock as a soundtrack; I like classic rock but it should have a more limited role as a music soundtrack for an action film.

All in all ""Sahara"" is great old fashioned escapist entertainment and is not meant to be taken too seriously.  So, my recommendation is to pop some popcorn and put this disc in for an evening of solid action entertainment.",1169424000,31,2070,4.382198952879581

This was my very first HD movie & I must say it's a great experience watching it in high definition! The video transfer is super. Mind you, I watched it in a 720p 42"" display & I believe in 1080p resolution plus a bigger display, it's going to rock! Out of 10, I'd score it a full 10! The color of the blue/green sea water, the sand, rock, mountain, smoke, etc are simply vivid. The desert scenes & toward the ending is totally awesome.

Now I understand why some viewers said after watching HD movies, it's hard to go back to the old standard DVD...

The movie didn't deliver - it sort of picked and chose what parts of the book to use.  If I hadn't had such high expectations, the movie would have been more enjoyable, as it did have believable characters and a good plot and moved along for the most part (sometimes it lingered over scenery a bit much).

It looks as though the characters are staring out from swiss cheese, and through sheer skill or dumb luck, not a scratch on 'em. At every turn this clunker jumps the shark. This is NOT Indiana Jones fun, this is ripped off stupidity. The biggest problem is the script. Five writers are listed and if any one of them has worked on anything more difficult than their high school yearbook, I would be amazed. Through this gifted prose the principle three avoid being shot, the plague, sand storms and everything short of Armageddon, and come out victorious standing together with Cruz as the Princess Leah- Laura Croft super broad. I longed for the Imperial Storm Troopers to just shoot them all. The only saving Grace is William H. Macy, who maintains some sort of decorum in this madness. Poor Matthew uses some other voice, a combination Darth Vader-Alec Baldwin with a little ""shiver me timbers"" thrown in. Sorry, I can only suspend disbelief  so long.

I think Raise the Titanic bombed because the people who put it together rewrote the ending and put in a lovey dovey Peace message which Cussler did not. Sahara wreaks on  it own.

It begins with the best scene of the movie, southern ironlad CSS Texas apparently loaded with the Confederate Treasury shooting its way through yankee batteries in the night during the fall of Richmond and the last days of the American Civil War. Its beutifully done.

Then it races forward to the present to Africa and Clive Cussler's character Dirk Pitt is looking for the Texas in Africa which he eventually finds in the middle of the African desert with the skeletal remains of her crew. Completely Unreal. These ships were not seaworthy and lacked the coal capacity. And what would a Slave nation's crew want to do in Africa?

The only things in this film worth seeing are: 1. The girl is pretty and definately feminine in a rough way. 2. The African scenery is well shot. 3. The action Scenes are superb. Everything else wreaks.

Not that Cussler's books are provocative for my mental neurons, I read them when I am in the mood for surrealistic action typical to James Bond.  However, this movie went over the top, to the point of being preposterous.",1158883200,3,448,4.792207792207792
2321621,3,B0009UC7HA,"I don't mind a bit of Cussler now and again. He writes entertaining if undemanding page-turners, that are perfect fare for a long flight or lounging around on a beach.

I was therefore curious to see how this Cussler yarn transferred to the big screen.

Well, Sahara is certainly undemanding - the goodies and boo-hiss baddies are all very clearly demarcated early on.  It has to be said though that Matthew McConaughey as our hero Dirk Pitt, bears only a passing resemblance to Cussler's creation.  In the novels, Pitt comes over as far more mature and with a hint of military or secret agent about him.  Let's face it, Pitt is James Bond-lite.  The designer-stubbled, longish haired medallion man that McConaughey gives us, simply didn't feel like Pitt and will probably annoy the Cussler purists no end!

No matter! Let's discuss the plot in some detail now. Pitt saves the world from environmental disaster, discovers a hoard of Civil War gold and gets the girl. Errrm ... that's about it!

Doesn't sound like much does it?  And yet, the movie still kinda works, if you're in the right frame of mind.  Just go with the flow and you will have to acknowledge that Sahara is beautifully filmed, amidst spectacular landscapes and with expertly selected dynamic camera angles. The high-speed boat pursuit and the action atop the solar tower, although somewhat derivative, were undeniably spectacular.  The improbability of some of the stunts is such that they would make Indiana Jones gulp with disbelief!  What the hell though - this has no pretensions to be oscar material and the 110 minutes flew past in a blur of sumptuous colours, action and amiable camaraderie between McConaughey and his wisecracking sidekick Steve Zahn. Great rocking soundtrack too!  Oh and Ms Cruz is certainly rather decorative!

With that being said this picture absolutly suceeds in being what it is, a fun adventure film. I see films like this all the time as my son loves them and not many of them do I think about much after seing them but i absolutly loved this film. Great chemistry between the actors, especially between McConaughey & Zahn. Zahn plays his part perfectly and never goes overboard which is a pitfall for his type of character. Playing it crazy but not annoyingly so, Zahn really steals the show.

I won't go into detail on this film as its pretty pointless with action films although I will say its entertaining and puts the characters into situations where the film never bores and moves at a nice brisk pace. I would love to see a sequel to this film with Zahn & McConaughey teaming up again. Penelope was basically eye candy but did what she was supposed to well.

Bottom line is this movie does exactly what it sets out to do and that is not to win an academy award but to highly entertain an audience that is in love with the action-adventure film genre.

As a footnote this movie absolutly shines in HD-DVD and is by far the best looking film paramount has released yet. After viewing sub par HD-DVD releases such as Tomb Raider from them it was nice to see Paramount up the ante with this one. This is by far the disc I would put in to show off my system to someone. At times i wonder why I spent so much to upgrade to HD-DVD but then I pop in a movie like this or Pitch Black and that feeling drifts away into pure amazment.

2321626,5,B0009UC7HA,"I really am not into this type of movie at all, but it actually worked for me and I really enjoyed it.  ""Sahara"" has everything (action, romance, drama and adventure).  Matthew McConaughy plays a swarthy treasure hunter, and Steve Zahn is his delightfully goofy sidekick.  People are mysteriously dying of a disease nobody has been able to diagnose in Mali, and Dr. Rojas (Penelope Cruz) is the doctor out to get find the source.  The trio ends up brought together, running for their lives from the evil masterminds behind the infection.

I love this film because it has the combination of droll humor, great action scenes (yes, if you love watching things being blown to smithereens, this is definitely for you!) and gorgeous cinematography.",1154304000,4,742,4.951612903225806
2321627,4,B0009UC7HA,"Any movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie). Then again, it was really upsetting at the film's climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up. Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here.

""Sahara"" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy. It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask ""how,"" because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score). Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes. Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas.

Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region. However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson). Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent. Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way.

These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner (""Thoughtcrimes""). The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the ""Panama,"" which comes relatively early in the film. I want to ask, ""Whatever happened to saving the best for last?"" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in ""Raiders of the Lost Arc,"" so why should that happen here? Granted, ""Sahara"" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than ""National Treasure,"" probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality).

Besides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film. I especially liked Sandecker's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film. For me the end result is that ""Sahara"" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety. But if you want more, then look elsewhere.",1153440000,5,3411,4.550488599348534
2321628,3,B0009UC7HA,"""Sahara"" is not a brilliant movie.  Its plot, to the extent there is one, is ridiculous and chock full of as many laughable and astounding coincidences as any Bond film.  Perplexingly popular Penelope pairs poorly with Matthew McConaghy.

And yet, this movie works for what it is, and is an enjoyable and good-natured action picture.  If you turn off the logic part of your brain (and you will have to), the picture doesn't take itself too seriously, keeps moving at a good pace, and has a good sense of humor.  Steve Zahn and Matthew McConaghy are excellent, as is William H. Macy.  While not a top-tier actioner, this movie is entertaining, and is at least worth a rent.

2321660,3,B0009UC7HA,"Sahara, directed by Breck Eisner, is an action/adventure film about two treasure hunters, Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn). Al and Dirk travel to Mali to try to search for a lost Civil War battleship filled with treasure, but then they temporarily abandon their own quest and join Eva Rojas (Penlope Cruz) to try to find the source of a deadly ""plague"" that's spreading across Africa.

 If you think Sahara is another one of those predictable, clichd action movies that we've seen too many of lately...you're right. Everyone loves to see a great action hero perform some cool, humanly impossible stunt, and it just wouldn't be an exciting enough ending if the main characters didn't overcome impossible odds to achieve their victory, but when this happens again and again and again...it's not even thrilling any more. ""There's no way that should have worked, right?"" remarks one of the characters near the end of the movie, but by that point I'd already thought the same thing myself countless times. Still, I do have to give the filmmakers some credit. The special effects are great, and at least a lot of the stunts are imaginative, though unrealistic. But there was one thing about the plot that really got on my nerves. Isn't it suspenseful enough to watch the heroes and heroine try to save the lives of all the people in Africa? Apparently not, since part way through the movie it's revealed that if the nuclear waste that's poisoning Mali's water supply isn't taken care of in a few days, it will destroy the entire world. No, I'm not joking, they really expect us to suspend our reality that much.

 The three main characters in Sahara are formulaic for this type of movie. You've got the laid-back, overconfident action hero who has more luck than skill, the comic-relief, and the brave heroine who, despite her brains and resourcefulness, still needs the aforementioned action hero to rescue her from the bad guy's lair. McConaughey wasn't very believable in his role, often appearing way too calm, but Cruz did alright in comparison. At first, I was pleasantly surprised at the way the movie down-played the usually inevitable romance between the male and female lead, but that just made it seem out of place when they started kissing at the end. Uh, did I miss something? On the other hand, I was really impressed with Zahn. He had a lot of funny quotes, and his comedic timing was perfect! I wasn't the only person in the theater laughing out loud at lines that would have sounded lame if they'd been said by almost anyone else. If you ever decide to go on a perilous treasure hunt, Zahn's character, Al, is definitely the type of guy you want to take with you; he'll make the whole experience much more enjoyable.

 Sahara is funnier and more imaginative than a typical action movie, but that doesn't change the fact that it is still just that: a typical action movie. But, since I doubt that too many original action/adventure movies will be coming out in the near future, if you're a fan of the genre you might want to settle for this.",1149206400,5,3079,4.735074626865671
2321661,4,B0009UC7HA,"Much like most modern action yarns, ""Sahara"" hits the screen with a bang.  Its bang, however, takes place in the twilight of the American Civil War as the Confederate ironclad, ""Texas,"" escapes an attack.  We blitz forward to modern times and are quickly introduced to Eva Rojas(Penelope Cruz), Dirk Pitt(Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino(Steve Zahn), in that order by way of swift-moving events.  The Zahn introduction segues into a slower atmosphere, as we meet William H. Macey, who plays Admiral Sandecker and the geeky Rudi(Rainn Wilson).  We also take a brief gander at the primary baddies and from there, the adventure takes off again.

Pitt is in search of the ironclad ""Texas,"" which he, and only he, believes has managed to end up somewhere in Africa.  He coaxes Sandecker into letting him take his private boat to hunt for the ship.  The only catch is that he must bring along Rojas and her companions from W.H.O. looking for a cause and cure for a plague that has stricken Africa.  From this point on, the viewer is fed a steady diet of explosions, old-school cannon fire, gunplay, tricked-out plane wreckage, and African tribesmen.

McConaughey has hit a homerun with this flick.  It's the perfect beginning for a new action franchise.  He's almost too clean to play Dirk Pitt, but it's the fact that he IS too clean that makes him perfect for the role.  The character just oozes with the machismo of characters made legendary by the likes of James Cagney.  Even his name, Dirk Pitt, makes one think of a soap opera-like hero who always manages to get away by the skin of his teeth.  Zahn is a complete opposite, making his character the perfect foil to Pitt.  He doesn't look or act like Navy material, but somehow he works perfectly in the role.  His comedic timing throughout the flick is dead on.  Cruz and Macey fill out their respective roles perfectly, with Cruz supplying just enough sexuality and innocence to make Pitt fall for her and Macey sort of bumbling around as the leader of NUMA.  The rest of the cast does a wonderful job, though this is Dirk Pitt's story.

As stated before, there are a ton of explosions and plenty of action for any fan of the action genre.  It's pretty much all surface here, but the story is just too fun to turn away.  The comedy relies heavily on the skills of Zahn, but McConaughey doesn't take his character too seriously, reminding us of good ol' Indiana Jones.

I'm not familiar with Clive Cussler's work, so I don't know how much this contrasts from the books, but as a stand-alone flick, ""Sahara"" is a breath of fresh air amid a ton of stereotypical action tales.

There is just something about those old adventure movies, that is different than the new action/adventure movies.  Occasionaly a movie or series of movies comes along that catches my attention.  A new movie that captures the mystique of the old.  Movies like Indiana Jones and Star Wars, and Sahara is a movie that deserves to be in that mix.

Sahara is based on the novel written by Clive Cussler.  My dad loves those books, and as a kid I loved it when he would buy a new one, because on the back would be Cussler standing beside a classic car owned by Dirk Pitt.

This isn't the first movie made based on a Dirk Pitt book, I remember ""Raise the Titanic"", it flopped at the box office, but I rather enjoyed it on tape.  But Sahara succeeds where ""Titanic"" failed because of one thing, the cast.  This cast for me made a good movie great.

Matthew McConaughey is so cool, and that crosses over so well in his portrayal of Dirk Pitt.  He is like the guy that all the girls want to date, and all the guys want to be bestfriends with. Cruz plays a great female lead, and McConaughey's side kick, plays a funny man to Matthew's straight man so well I loved to watch the two interact.  William H. Macy plays a great supporting role as the boss of Dirk Pitt.  In short the cast was wonderful, and the story is a great adventure story (thank you Clive Cussler).

An unexpected plus to the movie was the soundtrack.  I loved the music from the opening credits to the closing credits.  I especially loved the the Steppenwolf song ""Magic Carpet Ride"" when they were sailing across the Sahara desert, totally awesome!

This is an Adventure movie that captures the heart of the classic adventure movies from years gone by, I can watch it over and over again, I hope you will to.",1144713600,2,1866,4.422287390029325
2321680,4,B0009UC7HA,"What I loved about this movie was how it had a lot of fighting scenes, but still had fun, loveable charcters too. Steve Zahn had his good share of jokes with Matthew, but Penelope was not very fun. She played a doctor for the W.H.O. and that showed a few grotesk seens. I thought it was pretty cool how the cast got the treasurehunters and the doctor to meet, but some of the plot was hard to follow. For example, you were expected to think an ironclad crossed the ocean. Not likely. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie. If you get Sahara, you will get a few laughs and some cool scences and a above average plot. P.S. If you buy watch the deleted scenes.

What it could have been a full and rounded off movie with major dimensions, a serious ecologic warning, simply vanished packaged by a sand torment.

But, if you overlook that premise and let your neurones rest, you will obtain a gratifying pop corn movie than will be forgotten very soon.",1144195200,,508,4.827586206896552
2321682,3,B0009UC7HA,"""Sahara"" is the film adaptation of Cussler's mildly-successful book ""Sahara,"" based on the adventures of Dirk Pitt, a poor man's James Bond who goes through life one adventure at a time and always seems to find some long lost treasure at the end of the book.  As a stand-alone film, ""Sahara"" is a lot like ""National Treasure"" and ""The Mummy."" It can be very cheesy and there are way to many coincidences (Pitt wanders through the Saharan Desert and just happens to come up on Eva getting attacked a second time), but if you can suspend your disbelief, you will probably enjoy it as an entertaining popcorn-flick.

If you're a Clive Cussler fan you may have problems though. I can understand why Cussler did not want to be associated with this film.  It is only loosely based on his book.  Of course films always have to change books when doing film adaptations, but only a few of the main ideas were kept for the film, and the biggest flaw is that the characters of Pitt and Giordino were horribly mis-cast.  Pitt is supposed to be an ""ordinary-looking"" man, not People Magazine's Sexiest Man of the Year.  McConaughey comes across too much like a stereotypical surfer-Keanu Reeves type.  Al Giordino appears to be changed into the bumbling idiot sidekick, a role very similar to the sidekicks in ""National Treasure"" and ""The Mummy.""  The only other major flaw with the film is the soundtrack, which sounds like it was thrown together by the staff of the Today Show and is a weird mix of classic rock songs that don't seem to make much sense (eg, Pitt and Giordino are driving down the Niger river in their boat and the movie blasts into Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Sweet Home Alabama"" for no reason.)

Overall, if you're a big Cussler fan and you're approaching this film as your chance to see one of your favorite protagonists realized on screen, you will be disappointed.  However if you're watching Sahara as a mindless way to kill two hours, it's not too bad of a film, and will likely keep you entertained.",1143676800,2,2002,4.645892351274788
2321683,4,B0009UC7HA,"I enjoyed this movie, even though it was a VERY loose adaptation of Clive Cussler's book (by the way, Sahara is one of my favorites of Cussler's books, although most of his books are great!)  However, that said, the movie was fun with lots of action, and humor. It's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then, what is?  Definitely worth watching, and if you're into this type of movie, worth owning!",1141948800,3,406,4.4

2321685,4,B0009UC7HA,"The mere premise of a Confederate ironclad ship somehow winding up buried underneath the desert of Africa was enough to make me want to see this film.  How the heck are they going to explain that one?  Sahara was a different film than I expected, however; I pictured these guys out there digging up this historical relic, but there's very little of an archaeological nature to what turned out to be a fast-paced, quick-witted thrill ride of an adventure.  The discovery of the ironclad ship sort of falls into the background as the story mixes in a deadly plague, a brutal African dictator, and a potential threat to life as we know it.  Don't expect things to get too serious, though, as ""treasure hunters"" Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and his hilarious sidekick Al (Steve Zahn) basically laugh their way through an incredible series of dangerous escapes and reckless acts of heroism.  These guys could show MacGyver a trick or two.

Dirk works for NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency), and he manages to talk his boss into giving him a couple of days to follow up on an important clue to his pet obsession; not surprisingly, most folks think he's crazy to argue that the lost Confederate ironclad The Texas somehow crossed the Atlantic and now rests beneath the sands of Africa.  Along the way, though, Dirk and Al get a little sidetracked by Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) and her cohort Dr. Hopper (Glynn Turman), doctors with the World Health Organization trying to find the source of a deadly, spreading infection.  That source lies in Mali, a country ravaged by fighting between the forces of General Kazim (Lennie James) and rebels opposing his dictatorial ways.  Dr. Rojas does indeed run into trouble, but the personal danger she faces is nothing compared to the dangers she and Dirk eventually discover out in the wastelands of the desert.  Dirk and Al are a two-man wrecking crew, single-handedly taking out whatever comes their way - armed soldiers, tanks, helicopters, you name it.  A lot of it is ridiculously over the top - yet all the more entertaining for that very reason - you'll be rolling your eyes, but you'll be laughing as you do so.

Sahara is really an action comedy.  A Confederate ironclad ship buried beneath the Sahara (carrying oodles of gold coins, to boot) is far from the most improbable plot element on display here.  McConaughey and Zahn are great in their roles, though, and that is the real secret to this movie's success.  The wrong actor in the role of either Dirk or Al would have been disaster, as the fanciful story could never have stood on its own two legs without the support of the right actors.  I can't say I truly bought Penelope Cruz as a doctor, but she more than held her own when it came to playing hardball with the big boys.  Of course, it helps when the bad guys are the worst shots in the world; it's actually rather ridiculous, as these guys almost surely broke the world's record for most missed shots in one movie.

It's pretty simple, really - if you like action comedies, you should enjoy Sahara.  The comedic banter between the actors is consistently funny, there are plenty of action scenes chock full of gunfights, explosions, and fisticuffs, and you won't find any dull moments once things really get going.",1140566400,4,3285,4.731578947368421
2321686,2,B0009UC7HA,"Hollywood moguls should be required to actually READ the books they turn into movies. This is not a bad interpretation of ""Sahara"" but it could be so much BETTER.

Loyal, sturdy, reliable Al Giordino reduced to being a goofy sidekick?? No, No, No! And Rudi Gunn, a brilliant scientist and 2nd in command at NUMA as - what? - a college sophomore on spring break?? Just when fans think it couldn't get worse..Admiral James Sandecker, a man of power and authority, turned into a somewhat befuddled mid-management type!! EGADS!! The travesty of it all!!

2321687,3,B0009UC7HA,"""Sahara"" is an Indiana Jones/James Bond hybrid that should be appreciated by fans of, say, ""National Treasure"" and ""The Mummy"" (1999), though it's not quite as good as either of those films.

I was hoping it would be closer to the Clive Cussler novel, but the main elements of the story are there. Matthew McConaughey makes a decent enough Dirk Pitt (Cussler's hero in his book series), although I envisioned him with brouder shoulders and facial features more akin to Charles Bronson. Steve Zahn doesn't physically look like his sidekick Al Giordino (who is supposed to resemble a human bulldozer), but I enjoyed Zahn in the role. Penelope Cruz is also enjoyable as the W.H.O doctor.

I'm a sucker for desert-adventure flicks (e.g. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" ""The Mummy,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" etc.) and so really enjoyed the great desert scenery (from locations in Morocco and Spain).

So why only 3 Stars? Mainly because the flick doesn't match the greatness of the novel, but also because of the many implausibilities (e.g. the escape from the pick-up truck, the absurd entrance into the desert facility, the soccer ball incident, just to name a few). In other words, the film often has a highly unrealisitic tone. Still, I enjoyed the fun, upbeat spirit of ""Sahara,"" similar to Indiana Jones or the 70's/early 80's James bond flicks.

If you haven't read the book it would be more like a 3.5 or 4 Star film.",1140048000,2,1437,4.829268292682927
2321708,3,B0009UC7HA,"What better place to open a movie titled Sahara then in an Ironclad off the Virginian shore during the Civil War? Apparently our hero of the movie, Dirk Pitt played by bongo enthusiast Matthew McConaughey, thinks that the same Ironclad sailed the Atlantic and wound up in Africa. And that isn't the most far fetched part of the movie because Penelope Cruz plays a doctor from the World Health Organization. And to remind you that her character is smart, they routinely put her in glasses in hopes of fooling you.

Rounding out the cast is go to goofy sidekick Steve Zahn as Pitt's goofy sidekick that he's known since high school. William H. Macy makes a couple appearances as Pitt's boss. And Dwight Schrute himself steps out of The Office to add some comic relief when Zahn's goofball antics just aren't enough.

The film itself plays like as if Indiana Jones was a present day oceanographer. But instead of those darn dirty Nazi, Dirk has to save his love interest of the moment from African Warlords who is poisoning his enemies and sees the WHO as a threat. But it takes a while for the movie to move along and seems as they deleted some important aspects from the movie, which is based on a popular series of books on Pitt, due to time limits. Some of the action scenes are cool including an odd wind-surfing sequence. But really not cool enough to completely save Sahara.",1139702400,,1378,4.597560975609756
2321709,3,B0009UC7HA,"Sahara is, in essence, the same movie that we see bearing half a dozen titles every summer. It's not thought provoking, scary, or romantic. But it does have action, and it's mildly funny. Steve Zhan is a hillarious guy, he ought to get bigger parts. But anyway, it's fun to watch, and not boring by any stretch. It reminded me of Indiana Jones without the intrigueing storyline.",1137715200,4,378,4.656716417910448
2321710,2,B0009UC7HA,"Sahara is an action movie that knows it is an action movie, and not in the good postmodern way. At one point, the hero's sidekick offers 'you get the bomb, I'll get the girl'. If i were the writer, I'd argue that the sidekick had seen too many dopey action movies. As the critic, I'd argue that the writer hasn't seen enough good ones.

The film stars Matthew Mchoguney as an all-purpose action character, Dirk Pitt. Unlike James Bond or Indiana Jones, who save the world for a reason, Pitt seemingly only does it because as an action hero, that is his job. Often times he points at things and helpfully explains how they fit into the ludicrous plot, just in case we care. The film's action sequences range from boring to mildly entertaining, nothing that seems to justify the film's $130,000,000 budget.

A range of not quite A-list actors chime in supporting performances, including the completely wasted William H. Macy as Dirk's boss and the atrociously miscast Penelope Cruz as a concerned WHO doctor. Sure, Penelope serves as eye candy, but when you only devote a solid sex seconds of the film to her traipsing around in a bikini, was it really worth having to listen to her phonetically pronounce her lines? For that matter, was just about anything in the film worth our time and $130,000,000 of Disney's money?

Sahara was based on a novel by Clive Cussler, who rejected numerous drafts of the screenplay, most notably the one that got put to use. Who can blame him? Either the film takes one of his stories and makes it grossly unbelievable and stupid, or it shows how grossly unbelievable and stupid his original work was.",1137542400,,1632,4.679442508710801

2321712,2,B0009UC7HA,"I saw this tonight.  It is an ok movie.  Acting and special effects are good, but it is way too predictable.  This ruins the whole effect for me.  Also there are quite a few cliches.  Also there are a few eureka moments that could only happen in the movies.  For example, in one part, a soccer ball happens to get away from Steve Zahn's character.  He follows it down some steps into a darkened cave and just happens to see across the cave a small mural with a tiny (and I mean tiny) representation of the ship they are trying to find.  They discover it is a map. This leads them to determine a lot of stuff relevant to the movie.  I mean, what are the chances that any of that would happen in real life?  Naturally this is the movies, but a little realism would have been appreciated.  There are a lot of things like this, including the finale.
The other issue that I have is that fully half of the movie seems to be an environmental message.  The other half is an adventure.  They don't seem to be too well tied together.

So, the good stuff:  Gorgeous environments are one reason to rent this movie.  Or buy it off Amazon, of course.  The other is the actors.  Zahn steals every scene, in my opinion.  The others did a fine job too.  The fight scenes are well done too.  So, 2.5 stars.

2321713,3,B0009UC7HA,"Entertainment is a commodity. People buy it in bulk to fill their idle hours. This is a fair specimen of bulk entertainment.

It has all the right pieces. There's the pair of happy go lucky ex-military buddies, out to make a few bucks, have a few laughs, and save the world. There's the pair of WHO doctors, out to track down a mysterious disease and to save the world. (The requisite babe is one of the doctors.) There's the evil business man, out to make a few bucks even if it destroys the entire Atlantic ocean.

Did I mention credibility? No? There's a reason for that. If you can believe a gunboat from the American civil war in the middle of the Sahara, you'll get along with this movie just fine. You might even believe that the gun still works. If you don't look too closely, it's just a good guns'n'chases eco-fable where everyone keeps their clothes on. You could do worse.

2321714,3,B0009UC7HA,"Some slam bang action and some reality-testing scenarios offer some color. But Matt McConaghey is young, sexy, long haired and not nearly sophisticated enough to play Dirk Pitt. Penelope Cruz, like Katie Holmes, is experienced, pleasant to look at, and eager to please, but perhaps she should stick to Spanish-language films. These are two pretty people but there is no chemistry. Sidekick Steve Zahn is a comic book character and the second Pitt sidekick, Al Giardino, is played by the actor with the same gusto he brings to his current role as the ubergeek in NBC's knockoff, ""The Office"".

The most interesting part of the film is, per Cussler's standard approach, the fictional historic event that sets off the search for a Confederate ironclad in the middle of the Nigerian desert. The viewer feels more connected with the doomed sailors in their few minutes on screen at the onset than with the rest of the characters in the next two hours. Director Doug Liman pans ever so slowly over the interior of one of Pitt's exploration vessels, trying to create some sense of context or history, through photos, technology, high-tech gear, and other visual aids, but there is no real connection or explanation to be had unless you are a fan of the genre or have read the novel.

It may be that Cussler does not translate well onto the screen. It might also be that I've grown bored with Cussler after reading more than six of his novels. They do become a bit predictable while outlandish, cartoonish, and two-dimensional, just like this film.",1136160000,,1540,4.829545454545454

Dirk's impossible dream - get this - involves finding and salvaging an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that he believes somehow made its way across the entire Atlantic Ocean before it sank in a river in Africa!  In his search for the unlikely relic, Dirk soon finds himself knee deep in trouble, trying to make his way through a country ruled by a vicious, bloodthirsty warlord and torn asunder by chaos.  Penelope Cruz plays a World Health Organization official determined to enter the country to help stave off a plague that seems to be taking hold there.  The two of them, both with markedly different motives, wind up joining forces as they take on the murderous thugs and corrupt officials who are determined to stop them from reaching their goals.

""Sahara"" is one of those movies in which a bunch of beautiful people wisecrack their way through one death-defying adventure after another - with an occasional time out for platonic romance and a moment or two of social conscience.  The problem here, though, is that the humor is pretty wan overall and the action sequences strictly standard-issue in nature.  The acting, too, is pretty shallow, with McConaughey spending most of his time flexing his muscles, and Cruz making the most glamorous and least convincing ambassador of goodwill to a third world country since Angelina Jolie tried the same stunt a few years back.  And, of course, as is the case with so many of these films, ""Sahara"" reduces complex geopolitical realities to little more than simpleminded melodramatic cliches.

As the movie drags on, the plot becomes more and more ridiculous at every turn and the stunts more and more over-the-top, with the whole shebang culminating in one of those hail-to-Dorothy-the-Wicked-Witch-is-dead - type endings that is as corny as it is preposterous.

I've only seen a handful of Matthew McConaughy movies over the years, but this may well be my favorite -- just because the Dirk Pitt character is just so darned cool.  He's a true man's man -- ex Navy Seal, treasure hunter, and semi-credible action hero, complete with dashing good looks, a keen wit and a full head of wavy dark hair that is the envy of bald guys like me.  In short, he's the consummate studly guy.

Pitt is cool, but he has some good support from guys like Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), Admiral Sandecker (well acted by William H. Macy), and the predictably babish Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz).  The story is fast-moving, the stakes high (saving the world, as is usual in movies like this), and the plot is only modestly cliche.

On the last decades of the nineteenth century, a new science called anthropology produced all kind of (ethnographic) descriptions of faraway people in faraway places, so different from the white explorer-scientist and his mother-society.  The sense of superiority inherent in this kind of enterprise constitutes a big part of what makes backpacking appealing (back then and to this day).  With this film you have the opportunity to feel that there are some places on this Earth were you can stand in awe simply because you're there.

The plot is extremelly silly but never insulting, and the cinematography is extraordinary.  Some interesting directorial touches of Disney's ex-CEO son (sorry mate, you need to do some movies before getting people to remember your first name) makes this light summer film very worth of a rental (assuming you have a 5.1 surround setup).  It is a shame that the best shot of the film is the opening credits one (you'll understand when you see it), but the rest of the film has enough gloss to put your mind in a kind of popcorn trance.  Finally, I appreciate that the CGI is really kept at bay and that most of the action seems to be filmed on location with real stunt-doubles.

By the way: this was filmed in Morocco, but you know that, you stayed until the end of the film credits to know where to next time you get your backpack out of the closet, isn't?",1131580800,,1559,4.6231884057971016

Its main purpose is to be a fun film to watch, there are some funny parts and some deep parts, but all in all it can't be taken too seriously. It's music is also rather notable. The only things it's lacking is in the realm of believability in the end, that a toxin which had been leaking into the ground, for who knows how many years, could suddenly be a non-issue.

So aside from one man's obsession with finding a treasure ship in the middle of the Sahara desert, and aside from some plague or toxin killing people, the movie itself is supposed to be a light hearted action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.",1131494400,2,718,4.4393939393939394
2321736,3,B0009UC7HA,"Yes, Sahara does take place in the same universe as the monumental flop Raise the Titanic, a universe where the Titanic sunk in one piece. Keep your eyes open during the opening credits and you'll see a newspaper clipping of the ship being towed into New York.

Matthew McConaughey takes over the role of Dirk Pitt from Richard Jordan (whoever he is) and teams up with Steve Zahn and Penelope Cruise for a film that should offer much more action and excitement than Raise the Titanic offered. It's doesn't really succeed.

Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordino are professional divers/explorers who sneak off from their ordinary salvage duties to find a legendary ship packed full of treasure in a warn-torn part of Africa. Penelope Cruz is a W.H.O. doctor (I could have made a joke there) investigating a series of mysterious deaths and ends up on the wrong side of a local dictator/warlord. Naturally Pitt saves her and is rewarded with loads of foot-soldiers out to kill him.

The treasure hunt/ecology plot could have been entertaining but nothing really amazing happens. It could have worked as an Indiana Jones-lite but it's completely free of any of the iconic or classic scenes that make that franchise so famous. What we get is a lightweight James Bond kind of film with no real edge or excitement. The anonymous direction doesn't help either and the whole thing seems to drag along rather than being a breathless ride.

None of this is the fault of the actors. McConaughey and Zahn are watchable as always, though I would have liked to have seen William H. Macy and Delroy Lindo given more to do. Since, I've never read any of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels I cannot compare but whoever adapted the novel of Sahara into the screenplay forgot to put anything resembling spectacle or epic into it.

Sahara is good for a single viewing only. There's nowt in here that make you come back for more. Which is rather worrying since Paramount bought the rights to 3 of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. They ought to make them better than this, but it's still superior to the similarly plotted National Treasure.

I enjoyed the humor - the action - and the gorgeous color - so who is Dirk?  I didn't find too much wrong with him.  The voyage of the Ironclad was a bit far fetched but enjoyable as a hunt - I surely would like to have seen some of that gold.

The boat chase should have had multiple angles and close ups of the boat crashes. Scene changes are too rapid.

The casting is so poor as to be the equivalent of casting David Spade as Rocky, or the Rock as Michael Corleone in the Godfather.  Nothing against the actors themselves, but they simply do not fit the roles.  It's as if the director never read the book, and had only heard the plot through word of mouth.

2321762,4,B0009UC7HA,"A couple years ago I interviewed Clive Cussler and asked him why it has taken so long for another one of his novels to be turned into a movie?  He told me that he was SO upset at how Hollywood butchered 'Raise the Titanic' (one of the greatest adventure novels EVER written, by the way) that he would NEVER again sell one of his novels...UNLESS he had script approval, actor approval and director approval.  Virtually every year someone came knocking on his door making another offer, and he said the same thing: ""Sure...just give me what I want and you can pick and choose which book you want to put to film.""  They kept saying there was no way that would happen, so he politely declined each year, even though they kept offering more and more money each time.  FINALLY somebody made the appropriate concession and suddenly 'Sahara' was turned into a viable screenplay.  However Clive became unimpressed at the adaptation and against the deal they had made, decided to go ahead with the script they had WITHOUT author approval...hence the lawsuit we keep hearing about.

While 'Sahara' is not the Cussler novel I would have picked to put on the big screen, it IS a fun book (as are all of the Dirk Pitt stories) and I looked forward to it nevertheless.  I MUST admit as many others have noticed, the deviation of the written plot, especially leaving out the historical Abraham Lincoln storyline left me almost disgusted -- at first.  Cussler told me that of ALL the hundreds of fictional characters he has created over the years, only Al Giordino was based on a REAL person.  For personal reasons, he was VERY determined to make sure that Giordino was cast correctly...but unfortunately finding a short, muscle-bound, curly black haired Italian was easier said than done.  After months of searching, it became obvious that finding the RIGHT person to play the role as written in the Pitt novels just wasn't going to happen.  This certainly helped me to accept that blunder much better -- even though I REALLY enjoyed Steve Zahn's performance as Al.  It was well done and offered the biggest laughs of the entire movie bar-none.

After seeing it on the big screen and again on DVD, I did my best to watch it without any expectations as a Cussler fan, and you know what?  It was pretty dang fun anyways.  Sure, a lot of details were dropped (quite a LOT actually) from the novel, but one thing I was VERY impressed at was how family-friendly the movie was as a whole.  Sure there was action and violence, but the sex and language was pretty much nil -- which goes against virtually ALL the Hollywood norms these days.

In short: for the Dirk Pitt fans who are also the purists and expect no change from the written novels, you may want to pass on 'Sahara'.  For those who are looking for a fun, adventure-laced movie loosely based on a Cussler book, you are in for a fun time.  I think I fall somewhere in between.  I enjoyed the movie, but I am also disappointed that the storyline wasn't followed closer.  All in all I will eagerly await a follow-up Dirk Pitt movie (if Cussler even allows it...which is questionable at best at this point...) and I felt that the casting of Matthew as Dirk Pitt was right on.  I have wondered for YEARS who in Hollywood would do the character justice and I must admit, he did a great job.  I hope he gets another opportunity to do it again.

If, however, you have read the book be prepared to see something that only touches upon what Cussler wrote because it is a very liberal adaptation. Lot's of bits have been dropped, other's rewritten or rearranged- it's no wonder Cussler got upset.

Where National Treasure ""succeeded"" was that it had a storyline and action that flowed. I don't think that National Treasure was a great movie, but it certainly was better and more entertaining than Sahara.

Sahara is more like Charlie's Angel's 2.  It is a collection of action scenes.  It is choppy and there is no flow to the story.  For instance, they are wandering through the sand dunes, chained to a pick up bed.  They find a crashed plane.  Then, boom, the next scene is them wind surfing across across the desert on bits of the plane.  It reminds me of when they cut up a movie to fit into a TV time slot.

He carries a gold coin that supposedly ties in with its disappearance. The action is almost non-stop when they meet an attractive lady doctor, Penelope Cruz, from the world health organization trying to track down a deadly illness.

2321786,3,B0009UC7HA,"This film cost $130 million to make, but only earned $120 million in worldwide gross plus $10 million for TV rights.  You might think that means it broke even, but in movie math that means it only got half of its money back.  It was released almost two years after it was completed, so the studio knew it had problems.  What are the problems?

Well, it isn't a bad movie in the sense that while you are watching it you want to throw something at the screen.  Yes, it has a preposterous underlying idea - that a civil war ironclad from the confederate states, laden with CSA gold, somehow traveled across the ocean and maybe ended up trapped in the Sahara desert.  But so what?  A lot of movies have more preposterous ideas than that and make hundreds of millions of dollars.

All the actors do a good job and play the movie straight.  There is some action, danger, fighting, and even some not too gory dying.  You would expect that with Penelope Cruz there would be some real sensuality, but not in this movie.  She is Dr. Eva Rojas from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) risking life and limb to track down the source of a plague before it becomes an epidemic, so she can worry about love later.

Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are childhood buddies who have gone through school, the Navy Seals, and life afterwards together.  They work for ""The Admiral"" Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy) under whom they served in the Navy.  In their current job they bring up sunken historical artifacts for various countries around the world.  This also gives Dirk occasional time to indulge his speculations about what happened to the Civil War Ironclad with all that gold that no one else believes exists.

Fate brings Dirk and Eva together and drives them both north of Niger into Mali for different purposes.  They both end up finding something very different than they expected, all the while Giordino provides the sidekick relief (and is often the most fun and energetic character on the screen).  In the end, well ... you have to watch it to find out.

I think the problem is simply one of chemistry and lift.  Dirk and Eva are the love story, but Dirk shows more interest in the gold than in Eva, although he knows which is more important and does his duty.  He does fall for her, but always seems more comfortable with Giordino.  It is a movie worth seeing once, but to be a big blockbuster you need a large portion of the audience to say, ""Wow!"" and come back several times.

2321796,3,B0009UC7HA,"I don't get the comparisons with James Bond or Indiana Jones. Yeah, the filmmakers play James Bond type music during the boat chase sequence, trying to establish that connection; and, yeah, the hero, Dirk Pitt, is adventuresome and scruffy like Indiana Jones. But to me, the strongest comparison is with the Michael Douglas character in Romancing the Stone. As a matter of fact, I can't think of an actor that Matthew McConaughey resembles more than Michael Douglas.

I hate the comparisons with the novel. On the one hand, if you're going to base a film on a well-known book, make it as close as possible to the original while still maintaining your own vision. But then, on the other hand, why did the author, Clive Cussler, feel it was necessary for McConaughey to look so much like his character, Dirk Pitt, that he made him dye his hair? Wouldn't it have made more sense if the script and McConaughey's acting had resembled the character? But then, nothing about the background of this film makes any sense, even though much of it is covered in the extra features.

The one thing that does make sense is Matthew McConaughey's motivation for making this film: to be like Dirk Pitt - i.e., to save the day and get the girl. Now, that's not exactly a brainy, innovative motivation; but then, neither is McConaughey or this film. We've seen it all before: good-natured, typically selfish, treasure hunting male; beautiful, compassionate, socially minded female; handy, faithful, wisecracking sidekick; power-crazed, ruthless villain bent on ruling the world. It would have been nice if they had given this well-worn formula a new spin.

One of the more interesting aspects of Sahara is the art direction. Visually the film is stunning, especially the locations. The opening sequence in which we take a tour of Dirk's workroom while the credits roll is both interesting and informative.

And the dialogue is often entertaining for some light and witty bantering. But then we go off on a plot that is thin and getting thinner; until finally, by the end of the film, everything hinges on keeping a stockpile of disease-causing waste out of an African river that flows into the Atlantic Ocean, thus preventing the entire world from becoming infected and dying. Please.

The biggest disappointment for me is that, by the end of the film, no one has changed. That is the earmark of a good story: the hero goes through something that causes him to change, hopefully for the better - but not Dirk Pitt. Even though he faces superhuman challenges that would break a lesser man, none of them seem to affect him. He's the same person at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning. Oh, he saves the day and gets the girl, but...shouldn't there be more? Based on the $69 million return on the $130 million invested, I'd say most movie goers believe there should.

He's much more brooding and serious. And Steve Zahn??? He was funny, but Al Giordino is supposed to be a short, Italian fireplug who's a solid backup man of few words. He and Dirk have such a close friendship in the books that they understand each other with just a look. None of that here. In the movie they don't seem that connected at all. Rudy Gunn should be older and very intelligent (not whiny and confused). William Macy was the closest, in appearance, anyway. But where's the tough-as-nails banty rooster? Just using a few swear words doesn't get it. Had I never read the books, I would have liked the movie better. It was still fun, though. I just had to stop thinking of it as a Clive Cussler novel.

What I got was waaay more then I anticipated.  I came out feeling like I'd seen a great adventure, something that we really haven't seen since National Treasure.

Ok, so the pros and cons.

The story is quite interesting, won't give away any spoilers but there are two parallel stories going on at once, one from the doctor played by Penelope Cruz and the treasure hunting one from Mathew McConaughey.  Both are fairly interesting and the producers get them intertwined pretty well.

The acting was not great but good enough for their respected roles, which is nothing to shake a stick at mind you.  The only real outstanding acting I saw was on behalf Steve Zahn, who played the hilarious sidekick Al.  There's something about a sidekick that just fills in the comic humor gap and Zahn did a great job of filling it with his smart-aleck attitude and his funky ""Hi, how are ya"" voice.

The villian is just an evil warlord bent on making money and saving his own hide; nothing special there but he has a cool helicopter so that's gotta amount to something.

The action is pretty good, from the gun fights to the dramatic James Bondish boat scene, which ironically has music that sounds like something from a James Bond movie.  Sahara even has a climatic climax atop a giant tower where McConaughey is trying to save the girl from the evil villian and his henchemen.

Basically, Sahara is a James Bond movie without all the suggestive remarks and sex scenes, making it a family movie, a rare thing these days.  All in all, I give Sahara a 95% since the acting was not entirely steller, but it was still a great movie.",1127260800,3,1796,4.489230769230769

Normally you look for the hero & girl to shack up by the end because you feel they're made for each other (or at least would be a nice couple), but in this movie I just didn't care. The ending was pretty unsatisfying as well - one expects that everything eventually gets artfully tied together to make sense to the viewer, but instead it is hastily slapped together. In the end, it's not a horrible movie and does have some redeeming qualities, but is lacking in several ways.",1127260800,,959,4.714285714285714
2321800,3,B0009UC7HA,"What happens when you take a negative of a negative?  As an example, the novel Sahara was absolutely awful, a one-star effort that failed on almost every level of plotting and characterization.  Clive Cussler, the book's author, however, disowned the movie version of his novel.  Did this mean that the film would be good?  The answer is ""sort of.""  Sahara the motion picture is a vast improvement over the source material but is essentially just an okay movie, neither bad nor good.

The movie version of the story follows Dirk Pitt (played by Matthew McConaughey) who is basically a marine version of Indiana Jones who seeks underwater treasure for a semi-private organization called NUMA.  He and his friend Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) go up the Niger River in search of a Confederate ironclad that apparently crossed the Atlantic and wound up in Africa.  Meanwhile Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) is in search of the source of a mysterious ailment that is apparently coming out of war-torn Mali.  The dictator there is intent on eliminating all outsiders, and soon Dirk and Al are assisting Eva as they find the source of the plague and do a little treasure hunting on the side.

On the plus side, most of the truly awful parts of the book have been eliminated, most particularly a supposed plot twist involving Abraham Lincoln.  The movie's writers have just taken the book's core plot and characters and reworked it into a light action movie.  On the minus side, none of the lead actors are all that great.  McConaughey and Zahn are reasonably amiable and Cruz is nice to look at, but none are really good actors.  The best in the cast would be William Macy, but he is underutilized.

On the other hand, this is not the sort of movie that requires talented thespians, just some decent action and effects, and there is enough of that to keep most viewers entertained.  Overall, this is a three-star film, not particularly good or bad, a routine action movie that allows you to turn off your brain for a couple hours.

The whole scenario is scripted for fun, and probably thats where the issue lays  for some critics... but they never seem to like the family fun movies anyway :-)

As for the hard to believe  parts... this is a film, its meant to be fun and a nice way to escape day to day things. However, one thing that makes the action sequences more believable is that the plot point that the guys are ex-Navy Seals is established virtually  immediately; thus the amazing physical action is easily justified.

Anyways, Just like the wonderful NATIONAL TREASURE, its a nice way to while away some time, and have some fun. It's an 'A' Grade ( or B Grade, depending on your view) piece of fun and action. It has just about every conceivable set piece in the action Lexicon without the gross out factor that some action films have. So if you have issues about what the Family can watch, well this is both very Family friendly, and enough to satisfy any action fiend. If McCounaghy[sp?] is trying to establish a Dirk franchise, well I hope he succeeds because this is a gem.

2321822,3,B0009UC7HA,"Clive Cussler's popular series of novels featuring the character of Dirk Pitt have been around for many years but never turned into movies because the author has always maintained tight control over them. He somehow let his guard down (reportedly promised that the film would be a faithful adaptation of his book) and allowed Hollywood to adapt Sahara into a big budget action/adventure film starring Matthew McConaughey as Pitt in 2005.

Sahara trots out the usual archetypes: Pitt is the dashing hero; Al is his comic relief sidekick with the Eva as the plucky love interest. The chemistry between McConaughy and Zahn is good and feels authentic. They play well off each other even if their characters never transcend their stereotypes. McConaughy proves to be a credible action hero firmly in the Indiana Jones tradition while Zahn is spot-on with his comic timing and is as watchable as ever. Alas, there is zero chemistry between McConaughy and Cruz who looks lost in this movie. To her credit, she has little to work with.

There is an audio commentary by director Breck Eisner. Lines like, ""our methodology for shooting this scene..."" are typical of this technically-oriented track. Eisner comes off as a little dry but his comments are worth a listen if you want the nitty gritty details of how this film was put together.

Also included is another commentary with Eisner and actor/executive producer Matthew McConaughy. There is a nice, conversational tone to this track as the two men tell many anecdotes of filming.

""Across the Sands of Sahara"" is a featurette on the long journey to get this movie made.

""Visualizing Sahara"" examines how every scene was extensively storyboarded but was sometimes changed once on location or when someone would come up with a good idea. The look of the film, like costumes and visual effects, are explored in this featurette.

""Cast and Crew Wrap Film"" is a montage that establishes the scale of the production: hundreds of crew members, all kinds of vehicles and several exotic locales. It's a quick snapshot of how tough this shoot must have been but also the fun that these people had making the movie.

Finally, there are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Eisner and McConaughy. Most significantly, is a second historical opening that sets up the plane that Pitt and Al find later on.",1126656000,,2349,4.946700507614213

Zahn is part of a group that searches for expensive old junk and ends up traversing African countries running into and away from bad guys. Zahn, who is always a pleasure to watch, outduels the bigger name stars in the flick  (Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz among them) and has a great scene near the end where he unloads about 20 guns from his person.

There's a lot of action that helps you forget this is about the dumbest conglomeration of ideas you've ever seen put together in a movie. The flick starts out during the Civil War and ends up in modern day Africa, and somehow strings together all this nonsense for a feel good ending.

Never mind that but pay attention to Zahn. He's a blast and is by far the best thing going in this flick. Fans of high adventure, action and mayhem will like this inventive if somewhat stupid movie.

Ths is non-stop adventure yarn with the good parts of the Cussler story well entrenched. This is Drik Pitt as I always imagined him. Not only that but Steve Zahn does a magnificent job as Al, and William Macy as always becomes his parts and brings Sandecker to life.

When I heard Matthew McConaughey was going to do Dirk Pitt I was skeptical and expected anopther lame disaster. McConaughey however did Pitt and became Pitt with all his ""boyish charm"" tempered by self confidence and never-give-up attitude.

The reason I think it was better than the book is that of late - and that includes Sahara - which dates to 1992 - Cussler had lost his edge in my opinion. The storied became too bombastic and he gave Dirk that which can only be described as super-powers.

This film made Pitt more real without losing the elements that make Pitt and Giordino such popular characters.

The storyline was simplified from Cusslers original in my opinion the better for it.

This is truly James Bond meets Indiana Jones.

2321863,3,B0009UC7HA,"After a 25 year hiatus, another Clive Cussler novel gets the big screen treatment. Being a fan of Cussler and having missed the earlier movie based on his novel Raise the Titanic, I was looking forward to seeing Sahara on DVD. After seeing it, my feelings are somewhat mixed. On the one hand, there were some things I really liked about the movie and on the other hand, a lot of things that I didn't. But most of the gripes, I think, stem from comparing the movie to the books. I agree that it is difficult for me to look at the movie objectively but one thing is sure for me. This movie does not measure up to most of the movies in the genre.

Mathew McConaughey makes a better-than-average Dirk Pitt, which was a casting choice that I was not so sure about when it was first announced. Steve Zahn, although funny, lacked Al Giordano's (the book version, I mean) charm and cool-as-ice-under-pressure bravado and wisecracking nature. William H. Macy, who plays the part of Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker, just did not look like the tough-as-nails, manipulative and charming (although, to be fair, he is always smoking his trademark cigars) NUMA chief portrayed in the book.

The story, based on the book, had to sacrifice a lot in the transition to the big screen and this wasn't such a good thing. I admit it will be difficult to bring the whole book to the screen but I think it could have been done better. In the hands of a more talented and experienced director, this movie could have been as timeless and exciting as the movie that revitalized the Action Adventure genre, Raider of the Lost Ark.

None of the action sequences were what would be called spectacular or thrilling and since they were all pretty short sequences, rarely had time to build to a breathtaking finish. In this age of jaw-dropping special effects and flashy explosion-filled Summer Blockbusters, Sahara actually looks quite tame and mild. The only sequence that stood out was the ""Panama"" sequence. But this sequence comes pretty early in the movie and by the end of the movie I was wondering why they didn't save the best for last. To be fair, some things, like blowing up Sandecker's boat, were classic Pitt and Al. And some of the lines, like during the Panama sequence ""It didn't work the first time"" and Al discarding enough hardware and ammunition to start a small war during the desert capture, really do justice to their sense of humour.

Another thing that annoyed me was that some of the more spectacular scenes from the book, namely using the crashed plane to cross the Sahara, were underplayed. Some of the more witty dialogues and exchanges between Pitt and Al as they make the crossing were also left out. There were a lot of instances where I thought Al or Pitt was going to make a witty quip or sarcastic remark but was disappointed and left me thinking that Al would never let a chance like that go without making a sarcastic remark. If Cussler had in some way contributed to the screenplay, I think we might have seen a much better movie.

I can understand why Cussler, and his huge fan-base, were unhappy with this movie. Spielberg and the Indiana Jones series had set the bar pretty high for Action Adventure movies and with movies like The Mummy and Pirates of the Caribbean following with satisfyingly entertaining additions to the genre, Sahara looks pretty out of place and low on the totem pole of Action Adventures.

That being said, I believe that Sahara was a good movie with a good cast. I also believe that it could make a good franchise.  However, I believe it must have a different director at the helm, if this series is to become all it can be.

Get someone who knows action movies, and will watch more closely for continuity errors.  If you don't just want to be a James Bond clone.  That does a disservice to Mr.  Cussler, and his character Dirk Pitt.

2321900,4,B0009UC7HA,"I have not yet read any of Clive Cussler's novels, but given how vehemently his fans are insisting that his books are so much better than this movie I will have to check them out because this movie is pretty good (and Cussler signed off on the script and the casting, which certainly undercuts complaints about the same).  Of course, any movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie).  Then again, it was really upsetting at the film's climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up.  Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here.

""Sahara"" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy.  It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask ""how,"" because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score).  Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes.  Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas.

Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region.  However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson).  Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent.  Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way.

These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner (""Thoughtcrimes"").  The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the ""Panama,"" which comes relatively early in the film.  I want to ask, ""Whatever happened to saving the best for last?"" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in ""Raiders of the Lost Arc,"" so why should that happen here?  Granted, ""Sahara"" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than ""National Treasure,"" probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality).

Besides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film.  I especially liked Sandecker's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film.  For me the end result is that ""Sahara"" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety.  But if you want more, then look elsewhere.",1125532800,2,3759,4.550445103857567

2321903,1,B0009UC7HA,"Or, may I should say, no where near what it sould've been. This movie is horrible in terms of following the book. Even with Clive Cussler himself supposedly getting cast and script approval; something that Hollywood of course was not willing to follow up on.

First and foremost, they left out almost everything that made the book so exciting, and either pointlessly changed it or added something else just to make the film more action.

The book was not a shot 'em up action story like this was. While the book had reasons and explanations for everything, This movie fails to explain several key points and leaves the audience guessing at what's going on at certain points.

Another problem was the characters that were altered by Hollywood writers. It is just sad. They've made Al Giordino into a moron; that's the truth. Just watch the movie to see what I mean. He doesn't even seem to take his job seriously.

Rudy Gunn is barely in it at all, and when we do see him, he's made up like a nerd and is a total joke. Not the officer and valuble asset to NUMA we saw in the books.

Dirk Pitt has been turned into a treasure hunter; basically a man hired by NUMA to handle thier dirty work for them. He only seems interested in the rewards this job brings him. (i.e, loads of cash. This seems to go hand in hand with how the intro's subplot was altered). He also is not an ex Air Force Major, but an ex Navy Commander, like he was in Raise the Titanic.

Sandecker was mostly correct, just way too arogant sometimes.

Dr, Eva Rojas...well, just watch the film. I'm not sure how to describe her in this.

I am so disapointed with Hollywood over this. I'm going to go as far as to say that Hollywood has stabbed us Cussler fans in the back, as well as the doctor himself.

You owe us a good Dirk Pitt movie, Hollywood. Take notes from all the negative feedback Sahara got, and get it right next time. We don't want yet another ""Raise the Titanic.""",1125446400,7,1943,4.375
2321904,4,B0009UC7HA,"SAHARA is one of those films to view when escapism is the goal of the evening.  Made along the same lines as the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' genre, mixing adventure with comedy, a smattering of love interest, a dollop of social comment, and some pretty fine scenery that creates a stage for likeable actors such as  Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, William H. Macy, Delroy Lindo, and Lambert Wilson, SAHARA succeeds in pulling off an interesting caper film.

Not having read the apparently sacrosanct novel by Clive Cussler upon which the film is based, this 2 hour plus film seemed to putt along without any great shakes, without much in the way of character development, without any hint of screen chemistry between Cruz and McConaughey, but with the surprise pleasure of watching Steve Zahn steal the scenes with his comic talent. It is that kind of film - not to be taken seriously or valued higher than its intent.  It is just entertainment - and there is nothing wrong with that!

Dirk - well, he resembled the Dirk we know from the novels in one way - the name.  That's it.

Al - Could they have picked a worse person to play him?  Instead of being a wise-cracking rock-solid individual, he's a blithering idiot that looks like a surfer-bar reject. Look at the CD cover - see the dimwit on the right? What do you think?

Sandecker was passable, but 50 lbs too light and a little too swishy.

The entire film is an exercise in miscsasting.  Sore, if you've never read the books, you'll think this is an OK move.  Weak plot, poorly executed, badly acted, but passable. The opening scene was well done with believable SFX.  Unfortunately the rest on the movie did not even come close.  I found myself using the >> control many, many times to get past the weakest moments, so at least I was able to enjoy this as a 40 minute movie.",1125446400,3,1118,4.241706161137441

Overall, a relatively bloodless action film suitable for families who liked National Treasure, Raiders, etc.",1125446400,2,430,4.706666666666667
2321947,3,B0009UC7HA,"The ability to apply several different concepts into a film requires much skill, as Steven Spielberg does in his Raiders of the Lost Arc (1981), or as Sam Raimi does in his Spider-Man (2002).  Adventure, suspense, comedy, and drama combined into a mix where one single person carries out breathtaking tasks with ease which is a difficult tightrope-balancing act for a director.  The director must juggle several different cinematic elements precisely in order to please a tough audience.  If the director slips, a long fall awaits the director ending with a rough landing.  Sahara tries to deliver such an experience with heroic deeds that deliver action, drama, comedy, and suspense in order to entertain the audience.

At the end of the Civil War when Richmond, Virginia, is under attack the ironclad ship Texas is about to embark.  Before the ship is leaving, some Confederate soldiers are loading it with heavy metal boxes, which suggestively contain gold.  The opening with the Texas presents a special effect spectacle where thundering cannons spew out flaming balls at the evading Texas, which also continues throughout the film.  Stealthy the Texas attempts to run the Union blockade by slipping into the night like a submarine on stealth mode eluding the enemy's grasp.  The Texas set up will lead the audience on a treasure hunt in modern times where the story's hero with the absurdly over the top name, Dirk Pitt, ventures into the Western Africa.

The opening credits, which follow the Texas escape, provide a quick and intricate character development of Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and his best friend, Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), through the mise-en-scene.  The mise-en-scene reveals that Dirk and Al have spent most of their existing lives together.  They have gone through childhood, Navy Seals training, and are currently working together for NUMA where they salvage shipwrecks.  The relationship between Dirk and Al is always tense; much like a relationship between a bickering married couple.  This of course adds a lot of heartwarming humor to the film.  Matthew McConaughey's performance as Dirk is actually very good and fits the spirit of the film, as Steve Zahn contrasts McConaughey's character very well.  Dirk is the hero who always sees the glass half full while his partner in crime is a clear opposite.

Dirk and Al are on an assignment in Western Africa for NUMA when Dirk discovers an important clue to the whereabouts of the Texas, which he has been seeking for a very long time.  This notion of the obsessive seeking for a treasure is not a new concept, as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) and National Treasure (2004) depict the same obsessive search.  These two goofs, Dirk and Al, also stumble across Dr. Eva Rojas (Penlope Cruz) whom Dirk saves from a sure death.  Eva has discovered an epidemic outbreak of a deadly disease that seems to come from the same country where Dirk intends to seek for the Texas.  Together Dirk, Al, and Eva begin to travel upstream of a river with his boss Admiral Jim Sandecker's (William H. Macy) speedboat to find the treasure and the disease.

The quest for the gold treasure and the lethal illness is not without trouble, as they will meet people on both quests willing to stop them at all costs.  Luckily, Sahara employs the Navy Seal mystique to a level of super heroic quality, which will miraculously deliver the heroes to their destination.  This is done with a large amount of humor and action, as the film tries very hard to continue in the traditional approach of how many adventure movies attempt to balance comedy with suspense.  The film will turn into a roller coaster that swiftly moves from scene to scene, but does so without risk and suspense.  In addition, the director Breck Eisner moves too swiftly from scene to scene, and in some instances leaves the audience behind in the previous scene without a coherent and visual bridge into the following scene. It makes some scenes feel awkward, which resembles a first draft of a turn paper.  Thus, when Eisner walks out on the tightrope that he only keeps it a couple of feet of the ground he makes the fall funny.",1124841600,5,4157,4.884615384615385
2321948,4,B0009UC7HA,"Before you watch this movie, one thing: Don't compare it with Indiana Jones. Everybody does that, while Sahara is it's completely own film. Of course Dirk Pitt is a bit like Indiana Jones: an archeologist who has the greatest adventures imagable.
But Sahara stands on it's own feed, putting Indiana Jones aside. It's adventure with a new name indeed: Dirk Pitt.

The story of the movie is losely based on the story of the book. It's a great story. It has lots of breathtaking action (a boat chase, an actionpacked beginning, a shootout, a clymaxing end, a trainjump and much more), suspence,  beautiful locations (The niger river, the Sahara desert, and others).
It has a great hero (Matthew McConaughey is perfect as Dirk Pitt), a beautiful lady (Penelope Cruz as the beautiful and sexy Eva Rojas), and a fun sidekick (Steve Zahn in a great hilarious part). But also the music is great to listen to, and bring even more excitment to the film (Clint Mansell has done a fantastic job creating a perfect adventure theme).
With other words: this movie is as hot as the Sahara itself!

Another thing that just can't be missed: the humor. McConaughey and Zahn have a great camestry which brings funny scenes and situations. For example: the escape from the riding car is hilarious!
The word is that there is a sequel coming. I can't wait!

2321953,3,B0009UC7HA,"Sigh. Clive Cussler's novels are fun beach or poolside reading where reading a 400 page book in two sittings seems like an accomplishment. At the end, you never really remember much out of it, but at least you had a good time turning the pages.

This didn't quite translate to on-screen. The basic plot of the movie is this: Matt McConaughey and Penelope Cruz are very good looking and stuff blows up. Unlike Indiana Jones or James Bond (in the good ones), this Dirk fellow never really impresses. He has tremendous luck and a wicked sucker-punch for a diver, but there's no depth. There's no martini or irational fear of snakes. There really isn't anything about this character that I am inclined to remember. The audience is simply told that this is our hero, and shown that he looks even sexier after a few days in the desert.

What little comic relief is provided is unremarkable, but well-timed. The major action sequences are fun enough, but often too predictable. I sort of liked the pointless plot turns here and there, that the bad-guys are not after the same goal as our intrepidly attractive explorers, but in the end it felt too convenient that these two motives should cross paths in the vast expanse of the world's largest desert.

2321990,3,B0009UC7HA,"""Sahara"" is one of that delightful breed of movies that I like to call a ""smart dumb movie,"" because it is stupid, it knows it is stupid, and it revels in its own stupidity. It does not hurt to have significant eye-candy in a Smart Dumb Movie; here Matthew McConaughey fills the requirement nicely, displaying beach-blond locks and a bronzed, buff body that are welcome distractions from the shreds of plot.

The plot, from what I bothered to piece together, revolves around ironclad steamboats from the Civil War, one in particular that our hero - bearing the hilariously macho appellation Dirk Pitt - believes crossed the Atlantic bearing a substantial fortune before vanishing into the unknown. This unknown is, of course, the Sahara Desert, but by the time the ironclad makes an appearance again near the end of the movie we are so distracted by all the other plot elements thrown at us that we have forgotten it is supposed to be there, and it is made rather amusing use of.

Dirk Pitt is accompanied on his grand adventures - he is a treasure seeker, so his adventures are all grand - by his trusty sidekick Al, who does remarkable things with and to boats. They are joined soon by the lovely Dr. Eva Rojas, who thinks strange and nasty things are happening in the desert. She is right, more than she knows, but this does not really matter all that much as plot is a very insubstantial element in movies like this. Things explode, people run and dangle from very high places, and the usual bits of comic relief are involved, although there is a particular moment involving a jeep, an old airplane, and surfing that is quite outstanding.

It is not necessary to divulge more of the plot than this, because there is a lot more of it and none of it really matters at all. Matthew McConaughey brings a macho flair to Dirk Pitt that works in a larger-than-life way, and Penelope Cruz is her usual lovely but unremarkable and somewhat helpless self. It all works, though, and though the result is supremely stupid it is two hours of unabashed amusement that is excellent for summer fare.",1121472000,4,2087,4.635135135135135

Rudy portrayed as a bumbling stooge? No Abraham Lincoln or mention of Kitty Mannock, who's plane Dirk and Al make into a sail racer? It's like Raise the Titanic, half the book, missing the other half. And to the producers, Dirk was a Major in the US Air Force before Sandecker recruited him for NUMA, not the US Navy, get it right.

2321992,3,B0009UC7HA,"I don't know the reaction of Clive Cussler fans to this film -- I don't know why the author is so angry about it -- but as an ordinary film fan, 'Sahara' is mostly enjoyable, if not outstanding action adventure film.  Matthew McCoaughey is a likable treasure hunting hero Dirk Pitt from 'NUMA'; Steve Zahn is a scene-stealing sidekick (and he is always so) Al Giordino; and Penelope Cruz as a doctor Eva Rojas from WHO, who gets involved with Dirk's adventures.  These premises, together with the hidden gold coins made during the time of the Civil War, sound much like 'National Treasure,' and the comparison is interesting because director of 'Sahara' is Breck Eisner ('Taken') also known as son of Michael Eisner.

But 'Sahara' is different from that Nicholas Cage film, and that is the location mostly set in the hot desert of Africa.  Dirk, Al, and another NUMA agent Rudi (Rainn Wilson) borrowing a small boat from Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy), cruise on the river into the desert of Mali, Africa, where he believes a huge US iron-clad ship disappered with gold coins.

At the same time, the film shows us that a deadly plague is killing the people of Mali.  So, on the way to the country, Dirk and Al travel with a beautiful doctor Eva, who seeks for the cause of the disease with her senior Dr. Frank (Glynn Turman).  Don't call it a contrived story yet, for 'Sahara' is going to get more contrived as the team is attacked by the machine-guns, rockets, tanks, and helicopters of the country's troops, and their incredible adventures begin.

That's it, and that's all I have to say.  The film is made with a familiar set-pieces, none of which are particularly imaginative or innovative, but techinically speaking they are fine.  Action film fans like me might say we have seen the same kind of scenes -- like, peeping into the 'secret' of one company owner (Lambert Wilson); blowing dynamites without using fuse, or foolishly giving our heroes chances to escape from the villains who just don't think of killing them instantly.  You can spot bits from James Bond, bits from Indiana Jones, or bits from any actioners shot in Morocco, the land which provides the wonderful landscapes for the film.

However, in spite of its impossible story and lack of chemistry between McConaughey and Cruz (who is miscast, I am afraid), the whole film goes plesantly enough, with competently done action sequences and authentic images of Africa.

They're handcuffed to the flatbed of a truck that they unscrewed, shoved out of their captors' vehicle, and now have been hauling up and down dunes all day - without any water, mind you - until they've stumbled upon this wrecked plane. The goofy guy looks at the hunky guy, the goofy guy makes a joke, cue up Steppenwolf's ""Magic Carpet Ride"", and, well these guys have unlocked the handcuffs and rigged the wrecked plane into a windsurfer.

That's ""Sahara"" - the worst of ""MacGuyver"" mixed with the worst of ""Indiana Jones"" in a plot that was handled better in the ""Tomb Raider"" series. I'm comparing ""Tomb Raider"" favorably here. You get the idea.

Long, ridiculously convoluted story short: Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and Al (Steve Zahn, getting a career bump from his Texas buddy) are old treasure hunters, and Dirk believes an Civil War freighter sailed across Africa near the end of that war, ran aground in a then-fertile Sahara Desert (it was?) and remains lodged there under sand.

Their quest becomes intertwined with the mission of a UN health worker (Penelope Cruz) investigating the mysterious, toxic deaths of hundreds of nomads and rebel fighters. There's a military dictator, a chemical waste plant, a wicked corporate type disguised as a humanitarian, and Dirk and Al's boss, the Admiral, played by William H. Macy, a talented professional who'll act in just about any old rotten thing.

Unlike the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy, content to fit archaeology into a single plot engine, ""Sahara"" is based on a Clive Cussler novel, and it's a buffet of perspectives and characters stuffed into two hours for the movie to ever have coherence.

Was it necessary that the mysterious deaths warn of a worldwide plague? Was it useful to supply an African Civil War subplot? The two action peaks - a motorboat duel and a brawl atop a solar tower - aren't original, and the jokey-dokey interplay between McConaughey and Zahn clang against the movie's detail overload and the presence of Cruz, a stunning woman still struggling with pronuciation and syllable emphasis in the English language. Cruz inches ever closer to achieving a sense of humor, but she's still dead serious in ""Sahara,"" forgetting even to crack a smile in the movie's obligatory celebration scene.

""Sahra"" sits on McConaughey's shoulders as producer/star, and possibly the lead scapegoat in a lawsuit Cussler has threatened to file after disowning the picture. Well, Dirk Pitt's no Bond or Jones or even Croft. The appeal of McConaughey eludes me. He has the face of an underfed dog, is consistently tanned to the color of a burnt turkey and seems to given over most of his career to playing the gentleman doof in romantic comedies and gunk like this.

It'd be one thing if he had Harrison Ford's sarcasm but he doesn't - he drawls and lumbers about, as capable of an overnight drunk as he is a day in the action movies. He's added a thin moustache for this role; let their not be a sequel, lest young women begin to pester their boyfriends for the sleazy, casino dealer look.",1117324800,5,3139,4.85607476635514

This movie doesn't mess around with heavy drama or annoying romance. The romance was the part I was most worried about and I was happily suprised to find that they didn't hate each other, that the female didn't have to dominate the male, and that they didn't have to try to hide their emotions or make a lip-lock in every scene(in fact there's only one). Steve Z ws perfect - great lines and facial expressions. Sure, alot is improbable, but in this movie its not so tedious. I highly recomend this movie - and hey!

2322036,4,B0009UC7HA,"Dirk Pitt. Adventure has a new name? - so reads the tagline, and to be honest it's about time something new came along to replace the likes of Indiana Jones, and James Bond (against whom it is difficult not to draw comparisons). Matthew McConaughy is suitably charming and buffed as the handsome adventurer / treasure hunter alongside Steve Zahn's able but bewildered sidekick Al, in this global trek to find a phantom Iron Clad ship from the civil war that has somehow ended up in Africa. This obssession of Pitt's of course enrages his sponsor and employer Admiral Sandecker (superb casting William H Macy)who outwardly only tolerates his best asset but cares with a veiled admiration. The crew happen to be in Africa of course on another salvage operation, when they get a whiff of the Iron Clads possible location, but things take a turn however, when they must intervene to save Dr Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) who is on the run from the local warring factions after discovering illegal toxic dumping. The threeway escapade takes off with plenty of high jinks, action and adventure in a wholesome but believable way which is both refreshing and entertaining. Clive Cusslers novel may not have been represented to the satisfaction of the puritan fans, but the sober undertones of the story and one or two serious moments, do much to help keep this light romp on the ground. More than a buddy movie (although many cliches are apparent) this is a good contemporary story, and McConnaughy represents an ideal Action Icon for a modern audience. The reasonable success of the picture will undoubtedly pave the way for a myriad of sequels, but for now sit down, grab the popcorn and enjoy some old fashioned action and fun brought bang up to date.

2322038,2,B0009UC7HA,"This film is combination Raiders of the Lost Ark meets Outbreak. I really believed the Raider's storyline was really more interesting than the Outbreak storyline; however, most of the film deals with the epidemic of industrial pollution occurring in Africa and leaves the ironclad storyline for fluff and filler.

The movie features Matthew McConaughey (Dirk Pitt) and Steve Zahn (Al Giordino) as a couple of ex-navy seals turned fortune hunters working for William H. Macy, who we can only assume was their former commander (Admiral Jim Sandecker). Thrown into the mix are Penlope Cruz (Eva Rojas) and Glynn Turman (Dr. Frank Hopper) as a couple World Health Organization (WHO) medical doctors.

Dirk Pitt has been in search of an elusive ironclad, which supposedly transverse the Atlantic Ocean some 150 years prior, at the time of the Civil War. Every time Pitt's endeavors bring him to Africa, it rekindles his desire to find this monumental discovery.

While traveling up the Euphrates, Dirk and Al are met with opposition; and immediately Dirk determines it's because they were traveling with the two WHO doctors. Equipped with only a camel and his trusty cohort AL, Dirk Pitt changes his desires of finding his intangible watercraft to locating, helping, and rescuing the medical team.

Again, of the two storylines, the search for the Civil War ship seemed much more intriguing; however, the solar powered waste disposal plant was interesting to look at. This was not a great film by any means, but it was moderately appeasing. Worth the price of a video rental; however, not a penny more.

2322039,4,B0009UC7HA,"Caveat: I have not read Clive Cussler's book on which this film is based. Even so, it is clear that this screenplay is only a very loose adaptation of  the book and that Dirk Pitts role in this film is an extreme caricature of his roles in the Cussler series in which he is the main protagonist.. The fact that I was familiar with NUMA and Pitts from Cussler's other works but couldn't compare this film to the novel in all likelihood increased my enjoyment of the movie.

Matthew McConaughey is cast as Dirk Pitts, intrepid NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency) explorer who is completing a mission off the African coast when he is contacted by a trader with a rare Confederate coin. It rekindles Dirk's quest for the legendary ironclad warship that supposedly somehow mysteriously disappeared over a century ago. Despite the reluctance of his (retired but with title intact) Admiral wonderfully played by William Macy, Dirk wheedles the use of the crew's powerboat to explore the Niger River in search of any traces of the lost ship. Those accompanying him include his sidekick Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) and Penelope Cruz, cast as the dedicated bush Doctor Rojas from the WHO (World Health Organization) who is trying to track down the cause of what appears to be a few cases which appear to indicate the potential for an outbreak of some unknown plague. They quickly arrive upriver in Mali, currently in the throes of a violent civil war. With this backdrop to establish the storyline, the pace accelerates and the audience's fun begins. Mystery, death, disease, drama, intrigue, war, pollution, several humorous interludes and even a touch of romance - the producer and director decided to touch all the bases. It is probably a little long, but it's so much fun and there are so few slow moments in the last ninety minutes that no one in the audience when I saw it seemed to get restless. WARNING: don't get to the theater late (very difficult in NYC with all the ads and previews), the first few minutes provide the crucial backstory for the rest of the film.

This is the type of extreme action/adventure film that appeals to moviegoers who just want to be entertained with an interesting even if totally implausible storyline and lots of over the top action sequences. While it might be labeled a thriller, I hesitate to do so even though the main characters almost continually find themselves in unbelievably tense and dangerous situations. The reason is that this is the type of movie that was popularized by the INDIANA JONES series (which it much more resembles than JAMES BOND); the action is stylized, the story is high drama but totally unrealistic, and the theatergoers never share the tension of the participants because we know that the good guys will remain alive (with minimal collateral damage) and the bad guys will get their due in grand fashion - we just don't know how it will all work out in view of the overwhelming odds against the eventual heroes. However, there is neither enough realism for us to be drawn into the action as vicarious participants or enough uncertainty about the broad outlines of the outcome to qualify for my definition of a thriller.

So my four star rating is a reflection of the fact that this film fulfills the goal of its creators and producers - lighthearted entertainment. It reminds us that movies can be enjoyable and provoke laughter without gory violence (although there are plenty of dead bodies). While I don't think that it quite deserves a full four stars on my usual rating scale, it sure was too much fun to downgrade more than minimally below that level. If you want to see a moving drama, memorable character studies, outstanding performances, relevance to the real world or a potential classic, then skip SAHARA - if you're willing to suspend belief and travel through the desert of Mali for a while with Dirk and his friends, you'll have a great time.

2322040,5,B0009UC7HA,"Breck Eisner's ""Sahara"", adapted from a Clive Cussler novel odf the same name, may look, at first, like a routine action comedy. The action sequences are overdone and outlandish, the plot is thisck enough to hold up for a solid 137 minutes, and the stars are giant. All of that is true, but it adds to the endearing charm of the movie. Really, it's just a throwback to the old Indiana Jones films, but this seems much more accomplished. It seems as if the action really explodes off the screen, and that when something is fired, a gun or a cannon, the theater seems to vibrate. The film works on many levels, one of which is that it evenly balances comedy and action. The first scene, which is very misleading, launches directly into an action sequence, and it seems for a while that ""Sahara"" will be just another run-of-the-mill adventure with the overly cocky adventurer and the joke making sidekick. OK. That again is true, but it is done in a much better way. Adding attempted rape to the plot (on part of the villains, not the heroes), also makes the film different. Usually the heroins are resourceful, but early in this movie we learn that Penelope Cruz's character is anything but. It takes a spear gun and a severed hand to get the criminals away. The scene is, however, relevant to the plot and not just a weirdly out of place scene. At times, the movie drags a little, such as scenes where the heroes are captured over and over again, and one must ask at one point ""If the team was already in the villains fortress, why did they leave and come back?"" I still think it was so that they could shave and get a nicer car, but I may be wrong. I have heard people calling this movie ""National Treasure 2"". Alright, that just isn't true. First off, ""National Treasure"" was PG, so there was no spurting blood when people where shot, and I don't remember a person ever getting their hand sliced off with a harpoon gun. Funny, too, I also don't remember people getting sliced off with machetes. There is another plot that is not given away in the preview (more on that later), and it adds to why it is unfair to call this movie ""National Treasure 2"". I also don't remember attempted rape in ""National Treasure"". Or do I? I liked both movies, but if I had to pick between the two, i would probably pick ""Sahara"", just because it was more daring and had better action sequences. One scene, set in a power plant reactor of some sort, is spectacular and quite original. I must say that the sequence in itself was one of the best choreographed I have ever seen, and also contained some astonishing special effects.

The plot revolves around soap-opera named Dirk Pitt (Mathew Mcconaghey) and his sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn, who really should just be a full time sidekick) searching for a war ship from the late 1800's that carries a large treasure. Along the way, Dirk meets, or more rescues, doctor Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz). Eva works for the World Health Organization, also known as the W.H.O. She is investigating a strange sickness that is sweeping Mali and leaving its victims with bloody holes in their body and wildly disfigured eyes. There are sinister people who do not want Eva to learn the origin of the disease, and they will stop at nothing to kill Eva, Dirk, and Al. Early on in the film, the army ambushes Eva's crew and threatens then with death, so Eva is now truly scared. William H. Macy turns in a good performance as Jim Sandecker, the captain of the boat Al and Dirk work on, and the person that contributes heavily to the troups trip. The film spans to about three locations in the 2 hour 17 minute running time, and their is an action sequence in each.

The movies action scenes stretch from five minutes being the shortest to twenty minutes being the longest. Although they stretch forever, and contrary to what I may have implied, the movie has more than three action scenes and they never seem to grow old. They keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through, and the special effects never grow old, as they did so quickly in the similarly themed (and set) ""Scorpian King"". I liked how the movie wasn't all action, and how the film graciously took its first hour to introduce characters. I also enjoyed the movies many references to those strange 1940's action movies( the opening title sequence pans across a wall of newspaper clippings and the title is accompanied by the subtitle ""A Dirk Pitt Adventure""). Nice touch. But that is what the whole film is. One good, fast paced, funny, thoroughly entertaining popcorn action film. This is officially the first good action blockbuster of the summer. If only they all could be this good.

""Sahara"" is approximately 137 minutes and is rated PG-13 for Violence, which is at times graphic with shootings and stabbings, and lots of bombing and helicopters exchaning gunfire. Most of it is non-gory except for a thoroughly graphic scene involving a severed hand and a harpoon gun.",1114300800,4,4960,4.583333333333333
2322041,4,B0009UC7HA,"First of all, know that Sahara does not try to be something it's not - namely, a great movie.  It's simply a fun movie, and worth watching at that.

If you are a Clive Cussler fan, you might be upset because Dirk Pitt and especially Al Giordino are very different from the book characters.  However, Matthew McConaughey's Pitt is at least as cool and likeable a character as the book Pitt.  Plus, he's pretty doggone hot.

Another impressive thing about the movie is how clean it is.  Penelope Cruz's character manages to be a good female lead without being snotty and obnoxious.  There are no filthy sexual scenes and very little profanity.  On the whole, the movie is unbelievably wholesome.  McConaughey is fun-loving and even chivalrous; Steve Zahn as the sidekick is funny without being vulgar; the villains are improbable but manage to be evil without being slimy and repulsive.

Although the plot is pretty improbable and requires a LOT of the willing suspension of disbelief, if you've got an imagination you'll enjoy it.  On the whole, I'd say

A) die-hard book fans, don't watch;

B) stodgy people, don't watch;

Grateful that Harrison Ford wasn't resurrected to take the Indiana Jones roll

Grateful for the rose tinted glasses finally being removed from our view of Penelope Cruz (playing Damsel in Distress aka Ms Hotstuff)

Grateful I could sit through the whole movie

Less grateful I didn't watch something else

Grateful I get enough satisfaction outta watching the movie by reviewing it here, on Amazon

Grateful that my every expectation of this movie was fulfilled - it WAS a marginally entertaining remix of Bond/Indiana Jones hero adventures

Mostly I am grateful that although the scriptwriters took advantage of every well-known plot twist, they refrained from having ""Dr Evil"" kidnap Cruz's character out of twisted love for her (although it was a near run thing!)

So they let Cruz kick some *ss - they still had to excuse her presence by making her the romantic sideline for swashbuckling MC

2322053,4,B0009UC7HA,"The movie SAHARA proves on indisputable fact. Most reviewers would not know entertainment if it came along and bonked them on the head. The movie, based on the novel of the same name, is high-standard entertainment that has enough drama, humor and good natured fun to fill a couple of movies. It also avoids being pretentious unlike some other big budget movies I could mention.

This movie was unfairly targeted as an Indiana Jones clone. Sure the two have obvious comparisons - both searching for historic treasure - but the reviewers fail to comprehend that Cussler was writing Dirk Pitt novels over a decade before Harrison Ford donned the fedora and cracked the whip in 1981's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.

Pitt (and sidekick) Al Giodino are modern-day adventurers whose quest to explore the deep oceans often lead them into high adventure against improbable villains. Here, the two search for a civil-era Confederate iron-clad that Pitt firmly believes is in Africa. Of course everyone around him scoffs at the notion, but Pitts belief is further reinforced when he discovers a coin from the ship.

Joining Matthew Conaughey and Steve Zahn (as Pitt and Giordino respectively) is Penelope Cruz as a World Health Organization scientist out to investigate a mysterious plague - in a role which Cussler nominated Selma Hayek for. I have always found Cruz somewhat annoying in her other roles, but here she was actually a very appealing heroine.

The three take on a multi-millionaire industrialist and a two-bit African dictator and I found the journey of getting to the climactic confrontation to be highly entertaining.

I'm personally hoping to see one of Cussler's other novels (Night Probe) make it to the screen. That always seemed to me to be the most cinematic of the adventures and hopefully McConaughey and team get to film that one.

There are a number of differences between the filmed version of SAHARA and the Cussler book:

o In the movie Pitt is an ex-Navy Seal. In the novels, Pitt is a Major in the Air Force (technically, he is still on staff, but is ""on loan"" to Admiral Sandecker to work at NUMA).

o Dirk and Al are no longer former Air Force officers, on loan to NUMA as marine engineers/scientists. They are now ex-Navy SEALs who work for NUMA as treasure hunters. Ruins their credibility a bit, I think.

o NUMA is no longer a massive government agency dedicated to the preservation of lost nautical craft or concerned about the aquatic environment. It is a private-run organization dedicated to locating treasure and archeologic finds in aquatic areas. However there are hints at the end of the movie that NUMA may become more tied to the government.

o In the novel, Sahara begins for our heroes when they are confronted with the threat of the accelerated red tide. Along the way, they find out about the legend of a lost Confederate ironclad. In the movie, Dirk is, right off the bat, dedicated to finding the ironclad, giving him more the image of a shallow treasure hunter. It is during his search for the ship that he helps Eva Rojas in her search for the cause of the poisoned water and the accelerated red tide.

o The Rudi Gunn of the novels is Sandecker's enigmatic right-hand man. I say enigmatic because he is short, nerdy-looking, and appears rather unintimidating. However, he is a Naval officer who had served under Sandecker, and is EXTREMELY capable of handling himself in rough situations, holding his own with Dirk and Al. The film's Rudi is just a scientist, extremely nerdy, with no military experience.

o The humor is a little more dumbed down, I thought. There were several instances where Al acted quite a bit like...well, Steve Zahn.",1114128000,5,3682,4.826984126984127

Sahara is one of those rare movies that are appropriate for most age categories. The plot is a bit shaky. It goes back from one thing to another, and the end came quickly with some rushed 'tie-ups'.

There is a decent amount of action in this movie as well as mystery. Not orthodox suspense, but getting there. The movie starts with a bang, which really catches the viewers attention.

I think that I also liked this movie because of the humor in it. One of the characters is those funny/stupid personalities that really fits. For example, they're being chased by boat. One character gives the other a flare gun. The man replies To signal for help?....of course not! To shoot the guys with guns! See what I mean?

overall, this movie was great. I would definitely classify it in the category of National Treasure (also a great movie). If you liked National Treasure, you'll like Sahara.

But if you're not expecting a meticulous rendition of Cussler's novel this is certainly a fun weekend caper. You have seen these fierce explosions and wild deus ex machina twists before, but that's what disposable action thrillers are about, aren't they?

The adult cast may trick you into thinking the script was done by grown-ups too. Names like Dirk Pitt and the overall premise should swiftly dispel those suspicions -- an ironclad ship from the Civil War is buried beneath the sands of the Sahara, having ventured there 150 years ago but must now be found.

Two diametrically opposed male leads are called to the task, one a six-pack toting macho stud and the other a shrimpy blunderbuss, but that doesn't a film make so we roll out a red mat for a Ms. Hotpants played by Penelope Cruz, who, surprise surprise, indulges in some choice moments with the macho man while saving the planet from a deadly nuclear chemical.

I'm not surprised reviewers are drawing analogies to the other doozy thriller from recent memory, National Treasure, which at least played its cards with lilting pace.

Yet I must admit that for all its obvious flaws this desert adventure doesn't suck as much as it could have. The Saharan context could have used more African influence on the soundtrack (which as it stands is a forgettable jumble of 70s rock) but at least it doesn't star Jean Claud Van Damme.

Being a big fan of Crussler, I have to say that Matthew McConaughy doesn't fit the profile of Dirk Pitt, not even close. Having said that, I can't say this casting chocie was a mismatch since McConaughy actually does a pretty decent job here. Simply put, he's not Dirk Pitt of the Clive Crussler novels but Dirk Pitt created by Hollywood.

I enjoyed the movie, it was entertaining and fast pace action film. Most people would called this a great ""popcorn flick"". The plot is far-fetched as humanly possible so there really nothing on film to take seriously. William H. Macy plays Admiral Sandecker, a surprised but pleasant choice and he does a good job playing a ""boss"" figure for once. Steve Zahn provides the comic relief and poor Penelope Cruz was totally miscast in her role. Its also embarassing that her limitation as an actress was totally revealed in a ""popcorn flick"" of all things. But she was nice to look at and in a movie like this, that is what most people really care about. (That may sound bit chauvinist but its the sad Hollywood truth. After all, they could have easily hire Emma Thompson instead but for obvious reason, they did not.)

Not much at all is put into developing the history/lore of the submarine they are hunting for except for a few references that only remind you why the characters are in Africa in the first place.

The actors do a good job, McConaughey does a good job and gives quite a show for the lady's (my date was impressed).  Cruz is totally out of place and acts terribly, but acting skills aren't why she got the part.  As always Zahn is hilarious, he is way past the fear of being type casted but still manages to play his parts perfectly and always makes his characters enjoyable, no difference in Sahara, he is the perfect sidekick to the pretty boy.

Dirk Pitt had received a gold coin from an African antique collector which dates back to the Civil War leading him to negotiate to use a power boat for exactly 72 hours. It is owned by his boss who is head of an underwater search team,, NUMA, that looks for ""lost treasure"". He is alloted exactly 72 hours to use the boat. His goal is to discover the origin of the gold coin. Instead he finds himself in the midst of a major civil conflict in Mali ... where a local warlord Kazim, is allowing waste to be dumped into the Niger River which has underground tributaries. The contaminated river water seeps underground ... becomes available as drinking water in wells. One must view the film to discover how Dr. Eva Rojas and Dirk Pitt become partners in solving two separate mysteries ... and how they become romantic partners as well.

This film captured my imagination from the start ... first, by showing a Civil War scene where the Iron ship is docked and makes its escape into the Atlantic Ocean in April 1865 ... never to be seen, heard from or discovered. And second, by the opening scenes where a camera scans the office of Dirk Pitt ... showing photos, newspaper clippings, and model ships from the past. This introduction was only the foretaste of the great cinematography which was so evident throughtout this film. The film lasted 2 and 1/2 hours and I loved every minute of it! The Sahara scenes of Dirk Pitt and Eva Rojas riding on camel's backs ... with the sun setting behind them ... the camels undulating as they walked on sand dunes ... superb creative photography. The scene where Dirk, Al, and Eva reach a mountain pass ... stop their jeep ... drop all their weapons one by one ... raise their hands ... in anticipation of being captured by desert tribes is very powerful and effective, again, among the best scenes in the film. When they arrive at the mountain village, where the homes are carved on the side of the mountain, like old style condominiums, unbelievably beautiful. The monumental discovery by Al in the cave ... The adventure/escape fighting scenes on the Niger River, as Kazim's soldiers try to stop Dirk and his pals ... hair raising, seat of the edge tense moments, took my breath away. Most appealing is the train-ride in the desert to get to Yves Mossard's waste factory in the desert ... the cinematography was over-whelmingly superb. Building a wind-driven dune buggy out of a downed airplane (hahaha, loved it!). There are other great scenes throughout the film but to describe them would ruin the plot ...

This is the first Clive Cussler novel I have viewed with the action-hero Dirk Pitt on film. Matthew McConnaughy lives and breathes the part, his personality fits perfectly into the character. Penelope Cruz was another perfect cast for the role of Dr. Eva Rojas. My prediction is: this may be the first in a series of multi-million dollar making films, similar to the Indian Jones series. Make another film from a Clive Cussler book: I promise! I will be there! This is among the best (likley THE BEST) action/adventure/mystery film I have seen in recent memory (past 5 years).

2322075,5,B0009UC7HA,"I'm a big fan of the Cussler/Dirk Pitt books so, this was a lot

of fun for me. Granted some things are changed from the books but,this isn't too much of a problem.

The actors all do a good job. Matthew is great as Pitt and seemed

to capture all of Dirk's best qualities. (Brave, resourceful,tough,willful,etc.)

Steve Zahn was good as Al as well. No, he didn't ""look"" the part but, he had the character nailed I thought.

The action is very good and not the over the top CGI junk that seems to fill movies these days. It's more along the lines of the Indiana Jones movies.

The story and the mysteries involved are done well and you actually have to look into things a little like the characters rather than just have it handed too you as the standard Hollywood action flick tends to do.

The short version is this is a well made, fun, action filled movie worth your time and money. Sit back, have some popcorn, and enjoy.",1113350400,3,925,4.343023255813954
2322076,4,B0009UC7HA,"Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt finally comes back to the big screen in the form of Matthew McConaughey.  He is a treasure hunter of sorts, working for the National Underwater and Marine Agency, and aided by good friend Al Giordino (Zahn).  Dirk has been looking for a lost Civil War boat -- in Africa -- for a while.  His boss, Admiral Sandecker (Macy) and Al both think he is crazy, but still he presses on.

Eva Rojas (Cruz) is a doctor for the World Health Organization, looking for the source of a new plague in Africa.  Pitt show up in time to save her life, and since they are working in the same area, they decide to team up.  Of course, things are more than they initially seem, and soon Pitt finds himself in the position of having to save the world.

""Sahara"" stretches the boundaries of believeability, but that is not the movie's fault so much as the source material's.  Clive Cussler novels have a tendency for over the top story lines, but that is part of their charm -- much like James Bond movies.  ""Sahara"" the movie is a little lighter in tone than the novel, and perhaps that is why the story seems far-fetched at times.

McConaughey and Zahn convincingly portray life long friends and adventurers, even if they would not seem like the best choice to fill Cussler's characters.  Their relationship is the centerpiece of the movie, and it is very funny at times.  Cruz is bland as the love interest, and adds little to the movie.  Macy is his usual great self as the grumbling Sandecker.  ""Sahara"" is a surprisingly entertaining movie.  I had some worries after seeing the trailers, given that I have read all the books, but director Breck Eisner pulls it off.

Unfortunately, the chances for a sequel are slim to none despite the amount of material available from Clive Cussler.  During the production of the movie, the producers and Cussler had a falling out over the direction the film was heading and there are lawsuits pending.  My recommendation is to enjoy this Dirk Pitt adventure, because it might be the last for a while.",1113350400,3,2044,4.599447513812155
2322077,4,B0009UC7HA,"I was really excited to see this movie because I had such a fun time seeing National Treasure, another good action/adventure type flick. This one isn't quite as good as National Treasure (so what if I like Nick Cage better??!!) but I still had a great time-- the action, the stupid sidekick, the foreign chick, this movie has it all.

Dirk (McConaughey) works for NUMA (I forget what that stands for). Basically, he's a treaure hunter. His best friend is played by Steve Zahn-- these two have great chemistry. Dirk has been searching for a long lost ship, supposedly stranded somewhere in Africa. A girl is tossed into the mix, a worker for the World Health Organization played by Penelope Cruz. She's looking into some kind of outbreak that is killing hundreds. The three get tangled up together, Dirk still seeking his treasure while helping the girl figure out the source of this disease. It gets more complicated, though nothing that will hurt your brain, but it's all good fun.

All in all, a pretty fun movie. Awesome on the big screen, one of the great reasons to see it at the theater. I love how everything is connected and is wrapped up in the end, even if it is a bit extreme and far-fetched. That's what movies are, after all. If you don't like action, see this movie for McConaughey's tan, buff body. Or Zahn's comic zaniness, which is just fantastic (he loses his hat three times in this movie, all of which are big deals, to him at least!!). RECOMMENDED!",1113264000,3,1469,4.603053435114504
2322078,3,B0009UC7HA,"Why National Treasure? Both Sahara and National Treasure are somewhat similar movies about treasure hunters (or ""preservers"" or whatever Nicholas Cage was pretending to be) and both movies have segments of US history included into the plot (National Treasure - some of those debt-ridden Founding Fathers actually had access to all the gold that has been stolen/captured/gathered throughout history - and there is a scene set in early US history; Sahara - Rebel Ironclad carrying huge amounts of rebel gold, sails away from Richmond as it is attacked (the boat and the city)). Both treasure hunters track the gold (though the Sahara fellow is tracking the Ironclad filled with gold, didn't realize it had gold in it).

Matthew McConaughey plays Dirk Pitt from the Clive Cussler book series.  Steve Zahn plays his sidekick and William H. Macy plays the ex-Admiral that runs NUMA (which Pitt and partner are members of).  Penelope Cruz and unknown actor (Glynn Turman) are doctors with the World Health Organization.  Pitt and partner search for the Texas (the Ironclad) in Africa after they finish a mission off the coast of Africa.  Cruz and fellow doctor are following a plague out-break that seems to be coming out of Mali.  Lambert Wilson plays the French bad-guy and Lennie James plays the Mali dictator.

The movie plot has huge holes in it, and some of the sequences seemed to just be there because they thought it would be fun to include (like that desert craft made out of the downed plane). The Sahara people stumble along and oops, they found some clues.  The National Treasure people actually seemed to be tracking clues instead of stumbling over them (however implausible the clues might be).

2322079,3,B0009UC7HA,"""Sahara"" feels like a combination of ""National Treasure"" and ""Hidalgo"". It is a pretty decent film that will be well worth renting once it hits DVD, but I would pass seeing this one in theaters. The acting is good for the most part and the $130 million dollar budget was spent on some good special effects and stunts. I don't regret spending $7.00 on this movie, but it is really nothing memorable.",1113091200,4,398,4.541666666666667
2322080,5,B0009UC7HA,"Although there have been a lenghty string of action/adventure movies in the last year or so, and they have all been worthy and entertaining, never as action-packed or fun-filled as this one. Matthew Mconaughey plays a modern-day Indiana Jones or Rick O'Connell who is in search of a Civil War battleship buried in the Sahara. He is everything you'd want in an action hero. He has a wisecracking sidekick (Steve Zahn). Also helping is a doctor (Penelope Cruz). Some people say this movie is unrealistic, silly, and stupid. And some of it is. But really, who cares? It's action-packed, National Treasure-meets-The Mummy type of movie. And if that's not the greatest action/adventure ever made, I don't know what would be. Also reccomended, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, National Treasure, the Indiana Jones movies, and Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow.",1113091200,13,855,5.070921985815603
2322081,4,B0009UC7HA,"This adaptation of Clive Cussler's novel is quite interesting and entertaining. Right away you'll notice Clive's interest in antique cars, and of course his trademark knack for the marine life. To the movie itself it demonstrates excellent motion picture photography, meaning the camera crew was doing an excellent job with excitingly unique shots. Most of it plays in Africa - Sahara - duh ... A lot of action with comedic lines by Steve Zahn's character, but a rather unbelievable storyline which might not be the important issue in this flick. As one of the only - if not the only - female characters in this motion picture, Penelope Cruz doesn't really have a role and her role seems forced. Matt is doing alright as the hero Dirk Pitt trying to launch a career as an action star - and maybe it works ... I'm sure he had fun after he apparently went through a rigorous body workout program to put on some muscle -- and it shows.

Why do I give this movie 4 stars? First of all I think this movie should get a PG rating instead of the PG-13 as there's no bad language and no sensual situations -- it's actually a very clean movie ... and this is refreshing and a reminder that Hollywood can produce a fun-filled action movie without foul language and without the usual stupid half-naked babe scenes. I think the concept was executed very well and it has been a while since a nice powerboat like a Donzi or SeaRay has been extensively featured and trashed in a movie and in this flick you get the pleasure of such action. It's well worth watching this movie and my wife said that this is one for our DVD collection whenever it's released on DVD in several months or so. I would say it's a cool motion picture adventure for the whole family, but also noting that a film like this is probably not everybody's cup of tea.",1113004800,4,1820,4.465465465465465
