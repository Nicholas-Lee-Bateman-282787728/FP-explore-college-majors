As he is investigating a serial killer ring that photographs the children that they bomb, he gets called to a crime scene that was a mass slaughter.  When he arrives, he finds a young woman standing there with a human heart in her hand.  He brings her in for questioning and finds out that she is an amnesiac mental patient and names her Maki.  Maki also can see ghosts and uses that ability to help solve the serial killer attacks.  As Murakami tries to find out more about Maki, he begins to fall in love with her.

""Arcana"" is a captivating story that involves doppelgangers or ""alter egos"" that are formed when a person nearly dies during an attempted suicide or accident and their war against their human counterparts.  The problem is that the first half of this movie throws so much at you so fast as far as plot points and characters, the movie becomes confusing and almost overwhelming.  The second half slows down and the story begins to make more sense.  This film has a good premise  with decent acting, but because of the frenetic first half and a weak ending, I suggest waiting to see if this comes out on Prime or Netflix.
