8286288,1,B001C9C5MO,"I thought this was going to be some kind of cool screensaver (don't know what gave me that impression), but all this is a bunch of underwater snapshots taken with a cheap digital camera with half-way decent background music. The only place that I would think this would be a good place to play would be at a dentist office to take your mind off the dentist pulling all your teeth at once.

In other words, stay away from this piece of crap. What a huge disappointment. I started to play this blu ray and in about 30 seconds, I turned it off and went straight to Amazon.com to file this review. I don't want to see any of you to buy this blu ray and if it comes in DVD format, stay away ""period!"". What a piece of crap. I gave it one star because there isn't any scoring lower than a one start. If there were lower scoring, I would give it the worst score possible. Wait a minute, I believe I just did.

Save your money, don't buy this joke of a blu ray video. I am seriously thinking of donating it to my local library, but I wouldn't want the librarian to get angry at me. Besides, they probably wouldn't give me 25 cents for this piece of crap.

I hoped that I have helped deter any more sales of this blu ray. It is not worth your time. Believe me, I am disappointed in this blu ray.",1310688000,,1286,4.095238095238095
8286289,1,B001C9C5MO,"There is so little 7.1 material out there that I was very much looking forward to this BD to more fully experience my system's potential. That, however, was not to be.
The first disc did not operate in my Samsung BD-UP5000 and was returned. In the mean time, I update the unit's firmware and eagerly awaited the replacement disc.
Unfortunately, no luck... no play.
Though it maybe a great 7.1 BD, I have no opinion, hence the one star rating.",1294617600,3,442,4.5375
8286290,1,B001C9C5MO,"Amateur, low quality, home-made production.
It should cost less than $5.00
I have returned this item. Do not buy it.",1271808000,4,116,4.85
8286291,2,B001C9C5MO,"Very disappointed in this one!  This is nothing more than a music CD whith a cheesy underwater slide show in the background.  I have two Blu-ray players plus a PS3.  This disc would not play in either of my dedicated BD players, which were updated with the most current firmware drivers available and this disc would only play on my PS3.  Purchasing this disc is a gamble for those with only one BD player.  The music itself is ""OK"" at best.  There are far better recordings out there of higher quality and much more ""3-D"" sounding.  In short, save your money and skip this one....",1266624000,2,581,4.476190476190476
8286292,1,B001C9C5MO,It won't play in my brand new Samsung BD-P3600 Blu-Ray player with up to date firmware.  I'm sending it back!,1250899200,2,109,4.45
8286293,1,B001C9C5MO,"FULL ON SCAM, OF SOME PERSON SMOKING WEED AND PLAYING HIS WEAK SOUNDING KEYBOARD.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO A PRESCHOOL MUSICAL FOR BETTER SOUND REALITY. THIS WILL GET PULLED FROM SALE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BLU-RAY DISK IT IS JUST A DVD-R IN AVCHD FORMAT THAT ANY ONE CAN MAKE AT HOME WITH A BLUE BOX AND COPIED PAPER COVER...I'VE JUST HIT A QUADRUPLE WHAMMY OUCH....",1235174400,8,365,4.367647058823529
8286294,1,B001C9C5MO,"This is basically somebodys slideshow, the graphics that are used are low resolution and grainy, as for the claim to be HD surround Music not good either don't get fooled by the producers description of this product.",1227052800,7,216,4.864864864864865
8286295,1,B001C9C5MO,"The description sounded pretty good and I figured this would be something great to show off our home theater.  When I put in the disc, it just began playing.  No menus, no options.  And it soon became apparent that the picture was just a slide show - no motion whatsoever!  I couldn't believe my eyes, and my ears were none too pleased either.  The new-agey ""songs"" issuing from my speakers were extraordinarily dull, and they all sounded pretty much the same.  Buy the Animusic DVDs instead.  They're MUCH better!  Any chance I can get a refund, Amazon?",1223337600,8,554,4.639175257731959
