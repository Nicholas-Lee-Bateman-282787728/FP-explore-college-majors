5890409,1,B00E4V0JNY,This is C movie garbage.  So tired of all the five minute wastes of time caused by all these fake high-rated movies.  This is a C movie.  Hint: C comes after B.,1394928000,3,160,3.9375
5890410,5,B00E4V0JNY,"I don't like to tell people about movies just my opinion. I really liked this movie, yeah there was some stupidity but limited.  The good news is that the characters couldn't do anything a bough their situation which made it better than the don't go there stupid we often find ourselves saying. Check it out.",1394841600,9,308,4.6
5890411,3,B00E4V0JNY,This movie could have been made in a lot. Bad  photography.bad story. Too much in the dark with nothing to cause you any suspense. Save your time for something better.,1394323200,6,167,4.566666666666666

5890426,1,B00E4V0JNY,A little boy in the woods. It looks like a movie two teenagers with a brand new camcorder might make. Blech!,1434412800,,108,4.190476190476191
5890427,2,B00E4V0JNY,"Eh.  Just kinda not there.  You can do better.  Much better, actually.  No real payoff.  If you've seen any dead teenager flick of the past twenty years, you've seen this.  Not original, not clever, not shocking and not scary.  Go elsewhere for your shocks.",1430524800,2,257,4.704545454545454
5890428,5,B00E4V0JNY,"it's hysterical, not real scary but the cast of characters and their antics and dialogue are priceless.",1429488000,,103,5.117647058823529

5890433,2,B00E4V0JNY,I just could not enjoy this. The writing became painfully repetitive and unnecessarily expositional and I just couldn't take it seriously.,1420502400,,138,5.619047619047619
5890443,4,B00E4V0JNY,"Pretty creepy little ghost story. Not alot of explanation of how the ""ghost"" came to be, but it's still scary.",1418601600,,110,4.55
5890444,4,B00E4V0JNY,"Interesting horror film.  It had it's moments of cliche, but was fun to watch.",1415404800,,78,4.571428571428571
5890445,4,B00E4V0JNY,"I like this movie, it was somewhat scary not as thrilling as I would like.",1414368000,,74,4.0
5890446,5,B00E4V0JNY,Very scary flick. Had me on the edge of my seat.,1413331200,,48,3.4545454545454546
5890447,1,B00E4V0JNY,Typical boring horror.,1410393600,,22,6.666666666666667
5890448,3,B00E4V0JNY,"It's really hard to find quality horror movies with good actors and interesting plots available on Amazon to watch instantly. All the ratings are three stars and under, so when I found this one I actually thought it might be slightly good. Oops. The actors were terrible and the plot was pretty bare and bland. To be fair, there were a few good little spooks, but the twist at the end, while exciting, didn't really have much substance and didn't make much sense, honestly. Basically, if you're looking for a rainy day horror movie and don't care about the quality or skill, go ahead, you'll enjoy yourself. But if you're like me and want something that twists your brain and petrifies you with thrilled fear, this movie is definitely not for you.",1409529600,4,747,4.666666666666667
5890449,3,B00E4V0JNY,"Good beginning, weak ending.",1409097600,,28,6.25
5890450,1,B00E4V0JNY,"Awful. Began promising with potential, ended with loose ends and dissapointment. Boring.",1409097600,,88,6.416666666666667
5890451,4,B00E4V0JNY,"The important message of this movie is, ""Don't piss off a ghost-child."" I remember seeing this movie in 1960.  I was a kid and went with my best friend Jack.  We both wet our pants.  Now that I'm in my 70's you would think I'd be a bit more mature.  Well, I guess not.  Same thing happened but this time Little Arthur 111, my grandchild, and I wet our pants.  My daughter (little Artie's mom) and my wife Gilda, raised hell with me for scaring Artie. ""He will have nightmares for months because of you.""  Well, so might I.  Oh, by the way, my review of Black Sunday was totally mistaken.  After watching the first 10 minutes,  I stopped watching having wet my pants.",1405382400,3,666,4.298387096774194
5890452,3,B00E4V0JNY,"Good enough to sit through. They don't really go into the why too much but the story flows, the acting is tolerable, and the characters aren't annoying.",1405209600,4,152,4.666666666666667
5890453,2,B00E4V0JNY,things said in the movie by the boy just didn't make since in parts,1404345600,,67,3.857142857142857
5890454,4,B00E4V0JNY,I liked it. It was pretty good if you like the common mysterious slasher movies that are also paranormal and take place in the woods.,1403049600,,133,4.36
5890455,3,B00E4V0JNY,The movie was ok - if you can't find anything at the moment to watch then it's ok to watch.,1402272000,3,91,3.6
5890456,1,B00E4V0JNY,It was somewhat predictable for a horror movie involving a child. I could almost tell you what would come next.,1399334400,,111,4.6
5890457,1,B00E4V0JNY,"Movie didn't make sense, plus why did the character who supposedly was killed show up in the last reel of the film?",1398556800,,115,4.2727272727272725
5890458,1,B00E4V0JNY,This is a low budget horror flick that was a little slow. The story concept was good but the characters were annoying.,1398297600,,118,4.409090909090909
5890459,1,B00E4V0JNY,"Don't worry, you're completely safe. You'd probably encounter more ""fear"" walking to the mailbox. And movie makers, please, I beg you. Stop making mediocre films.",1397865600,,162,5.52
5890460,1,B00E4V0JNY,"This movie is packed so full of cheese, it might as well be a soap. There was absolutely no aspect of that child that was scary or intimidating. The rules of the game were not followed, so the entire plot literally was non-applicable. More than half of the movie was just filler anyway and had no purpose being included. So, no plot, no scare, extra cheesy. One of the worst movies ever.",1397433600,2,387,4.388888888888889
5890461,1,B00E4V0JNY,"Nothing was told or solved. I don't know what was the movie was about. It was wasting of time, and made me mad at the end.",1396224000,2,122,3.730769230769231
5890462,2,B00E4V0JNY,I didn't like it because it was corny . it wasn't scary i expected more it just didn't please me,1395273600,,96,3.85

8601136,2,B00E4V0JNY,"I always feel bad criticizing these little horror movies made on the cheap. I really do appreciate that people love this genre so much that they'll make a movie without...thinking things through, let's say.

I'm no social justice warrior, but the stereotypes in this movie were downright insulting. The Asian girl is super smart, wears glasses, and is naive. The Latina girl is tough with attitude and has a reputation for being easy. The White girl is All-American and bland as fat-free milk. I can't think of how to describe her boyfriend's personality. ""Not there"" comes close. Then of course there's the derpy class-clown caricature who no one really wants to come on the hike. He's the one constantly sticking his camera in everyone's face and coming on to the Spicy Latina. (She admits at one point that she slept with The Derp, but she was drunk. Yep. All we're missing is the Native American character to tell the legend of why their ancestors say this ground is cursed by evil spirits.)

Although our boy-ghost-invisible force-antagonist thing looks pretty good on the cover, in the movie he looked like a normal kid, slightly peeved to be wearing a sweater vest. He did his thing convincingly enough without becoming obnoxious as kids in movies are won't to do. (Anakin Skywalker *cough*). To be fair, it's really hard to be menacing while wearing a sweater vest.

The biggest reason why I'm so cranky about this movie is that good ideas were there! An urban legend is mentioned a few times, but never told. I know ""we all know"" urban legends, but I am not aware of one about a peeved boy in a sweater vest who flings people around like my cat does a rubber band. (Even when the urban legend is The Hook, or Bloody Mary, the script still manages to work in a recap at least. It's usually told to the one character who was raised by wolves in a cave and had no access to human culture, but at least it's there.) The lack of an urban legend recap means there is little context for what's going on and a huge source of potential tension dissipates like a fart in a hurricane.

There is the most meager hint of tragic backstory. There is a creepy abandoned building (that is somewhat wasted as they film the usual boring ratty old junk inside) and a strong indication that Bad Things Happened to Small Children there. Like what? Tell me more! Gimme some ugly, gnarly context so the Peevish Sweater Vest has a good reason to be angry enough, powerful enough, to toss people around like Carrie White on a bender.

Nah. But here's a couple scenes of our stereotagonists (stereotype + protagonist; I just made that up) posing for pictures!

It's watchable and good for a night when you've seen almost everything else. May your dreams be free of the Peevish Sweater Vest.",1477612800,4,2772,4.623983739837398
8601137,1,B00E4V0JNY,Two thumbs down,1469232000,,15,4.333333333333333
8601138,5,B00E4V0JNY,"Not sure what the bad reviews are about, but I really liked this movie! It did have a plot, several things were explained later on about the creepy kid. The movie had great actors in it, good special effects, I even jumped twice at different scenes. I am a horror addict, so its not anywhere near my first rodeo. Great movie!",1469145600,,325,4.344262295081967
8601139,3,B00E4V0JNY,This movie was very entertaining and scary at times,1468540800,,51,4.777777777777778
8601140,3,B00E4V0JNY,Ok.  Typical for the genre.  Nothing special but still ok to kill time or have on in the background.  Not for kids.,1465257600,,115,4.136363636363637
8601141,2,B00E4V0JNY,"This could have been a good movie except they explained nothing.  You had no idea why this was happening to them. Why the kid gave the one guy to protect them yet his friends die.  I am sorry I just can take movies with huge holes in the plot.  SPOILER ALERT!!! The writing was okay but once again no final girl.  To the writers and director, watch the classics.  There is always final girl.",1457222400,2,391,4.22972972972973
8601142,2,B00E4V0JNY,"The premise was OK. The acting was not. You have the same prototypes as they do for characters in horror movies. Spooky kids are usually a draw for me. But, we get a bit of Johnnie's back story and it's really not enough. So, I wouldn't say it's a total waste of time. But, you can do better.",1451001600,,292,4.051724137931035
8601143,1,B00E4V0JNY,"Don't bother watching this. Lots of people get killed and there is no explanation as to what in the world is going on. The -Story - There is no story, no plot, Some supernatural force flings them against trees and up in the air, atop cars with no thought to why. There is no way to stop it, or perhaps there is. We'll never know since none of the characters seem too inclined to do anything about it, except that one runs down the road, at night to get help although they are completely lost. Not worth the time.",1449100800,2,512,4.181818181818182
