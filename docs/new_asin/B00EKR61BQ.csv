5926588,2,B00EKR61BQ,"I'm a huge Kevin Hart fan. I eagerly awaited this movie, and as soon as it hit Redbox, I rented it and watched it.

Ultimately, it was a let-down, and confusing as well.

The first part of the movie was funny, and when Kevin pledged to ""Explain"" a lot of things, I was all ears.

But then the film took a bizarre and unexpected turn into megalomania which was boring and baffling (I ended up skipping it). Who was Kevin trying to impress? Obviously, not the fans watching the movie who don't care if he killed Denmark or not. We're just there for the jokes.

Finally, the Madison Square Garden performance began, but something was off. Although the stage caught fire, Kevin never did. He failed to hit his stride, but I kept waiting.

There is no doubt about it that Kevin is a genius. His physical actions and voices are usually so spot on, he's like a brilliant, one-man Shakespeare play. But very little of this sparkling genius was evident in this lackluster and ""phoning-it-in"" performance.

I did not even seen him go to his physical edge with his physical actions and facial expressions like he usually does; it just seemed to me he wasn't trying.

His material was half-*ssed and poorly edited. It just seemed to be a random hodge-podge of leftover standup he decided to make into a new show. He made few, if any, unique observations about life. He was mildly funny, but nowhere was his genius evident.

In addition, I did not feel he ""Explained"" anything he said he would at the beginning of the show. I thought there was going to be a comedic payoff for the beginning of the jokes planted at the beginning of the show. There never was. The audience was left holding the bag.

On the production side, there were tons of distracting cuts to hysterically-laughing audience members interspersed, without rhythm, throughout the show. I found myself questioning if I was watching the same show they were?

I'm not sure why, but Kevin was off on this one. But he is a true genius, so I know his next project will be classic Kevin.

I'm still a huge Kevin fan and always will be!! All right all right alllll riiiiiight!",1381881600,10,2121,4.5552631578947365
5926589,2,B00EKR61BQ,"I am a huge fan of Kevin Hart, however I am very disappointed with this project. It was nothing like any of his other shows. I only laughed out loud once throughout the entire show and I was laughing at his facial expression and not what he was actually saying so had I listened to this show on Pandora (audio only), I would have been even more disappointed. Although I didn't much enjoy this show, I look forward to his next project in hopes that it's better than this one.",1381795200,2,474,4.277777777777778

5926591,4,B00EKR61BQ,"My brother introduced me to this comedic diminutive, dynamo back in 06, with his first special ""I'm a Grown Little Man"" we watched that bootleg several times, laughing hysterically at the story where Kevin and a friend piss off an ostrich with a pen. Alright alright alright. You're gonna learn today! became a catch phrase from his 2011 special ""Laugh At My Pain"", where Hart talks about his coke addicted father stumbling into his spelling bee, wearing sweatpants with no underwear - just swinging in the breeze.

The trick of a good comedian is to make the worst s*** funny. Hart's now been through a divorce, which he admits ended mostly due to his cheating, he's anticipating despising his kids eventual step-father, he was held at gun point, and fears the possibility of a bum bump, all of it delivered with side splitting, stupid, hilarity in this latest special.

5926682,1,B00EKR61BQ,"Nothing funny here.  This was my first experience with Kevin Hart, a man that is literally the least funny ""comedian"" I have ever seen.  To put that in perspective, this dubious distinction was previously held by none other than CarrotTop.
For the first 9 minutes of the program, I didn't even detect any attempts at humor.  An ""after party"" is being hosted by Kevin Hart, where his friends, associates and guests take turns interacting with Kevin with sort of a rowdy, party feel.  It would be like if you walked around a wedding reception with a camcorder and taped various drunks making lame comments to one another for 9 minutes.
Then Kevin announces to one of his entourage that he needs him to ""call the Garden to tell them he is on his way down there to get some shizz off of his chest.""
The friend responds ""Kevin all this food and you want Olive Garden man, fo real?""
Annoyed by his friend's lack of understanding, Kevin snaps back ""No, Madison Square Garden...""
When his lackey argues about the need to call Madison Square Garden, Kevin gets fired up and tells him ""I'll punch you... I will double punch your face.  I'll break both of yo eyes.""
Now, it was clear to me that because of Kevin's animated facial expressions and his 'hip hop inspired' manner of speech, this was intended to be funny  If this sounds like a real knee slapper to you, then you will be in for a real treat with the rest of your viewing experience.  If, like me, this doesn't even make you consider cracking a smile, let alone muster up a weak, half-hearted chuckle... then I think you will find the rest of Kevin's attempts at humor to be much of the same.
For the next 11 minutes of the show, we watch random people being interviewed outside of a few of his performance venues where they tell us how hilarious Kevin is.  Not a joke is attempted during this excruciating sequence.  We read on screen stats of how many people attended each show and how much money he grossed.  It feels very much like an attempt to convince the viewer that Kevin is indeed funny, rather than just having Kevin's performance speak for itself.
If you enjoy humor and in particular the more ""urban humor"", ""ethnic humor"", or ""black humor"" you will need to look elsewhere because there is nothing funny here.

I was looking for something to watch online and thought I'd give him a shot with the Amazon rental.  Also, if your ish is really funny, I can disregard a few bad words. ;\

Really? This show sold-out everywhere?  Is this what the masses are enjoying nowadays?  'Cuz it ain't funny.  The funniest thing about this whole hour was the bit about (and use) of the fire, and that got old after 2-3 times.

I want my $5 back.  I haven't said that in a long time because normally I trust my instincts.  (I also want the hour back.

5926763,3,B00EKR61BQ,"There are concert films released of comics all the time. The most confusing thing these days is to know which came first, their being comics or having starred movies. It seems the two are connected more often than not. In the case of Kevin Hart my first exposure to him was via movies and TV. Now that I've had a chance to see his stand up performance I see bright things ahead for him.

KEVIN HART: LET ME EXPLAIN begins somewhat different than most stand up comic performances. Instead we open at a party being held by Hart in celebration of his success. The problem is that now that he's successful he's found all the baggage that being there adds on. Slams for not being funny to not being all that he can be etc. lead to his shutting down the party and heading for Madison Square Garden so he can set the record straight. In all honesty it's an interesting premise to start with but goes too long, nearly 10 minutes of a 75 minute film.

Hart arrives at the Garden and walks out to roaring applause and a humongous stage that has shooting flames, part of a joke he shares with the audience that he pops up now and then. It is here that he starts the stand up portion of the film and the start feels a bit rocky. The excitement that Hart feels is on display from the get go as he starts out with such a rapid fire delivery that by the time you get one joke he's already three past it. His delivery even sounds like he's gasping for breath before he can get out his next line.

Eventually he slows down this delivery and begins to offer his take on life and more importantly the life that he is now leading. Hart is the type of comedian who gets his humor not from writing simple jokes that start out with a set up and end with a punch line. Hart tells stories that are funny. Some of the best comedians have done this in the past, most notably Bill Cosby. Hart has the potential to become as successful as Cosby with the way he delivers his stories and how they drag you in the longer they become.

 With only 60 minutes or less of material on display (the rest is the intro, applause and a heartfelt moment at the end) Hart gives you plenty to laugh at. No spoiler warning here as I don't intend to spoil any jokes he offers by sharing them. Just know to expect some truly funny tales. Also expect to find one thing that's always bothered me about young comedians which is the need to use the bluest of language. If Hart were employing a swear far at a quarter a pop just for his use of the F bomb you could feed a family of four at a nice restaurant. If this doesn't offend you then you'll never notice it.

By the end there were two things that stood out for me with this performance film. The first was the potential that Hart shows. He really can be quite funny and not just in a film performance way but with his delivery and body language joined together to make something that will evoke laughs. The other thing was the heartfelt moment near the end when he walks back onstage to thank the audience for supporting him and for coming out to the show. As one of few comedians to sell out Madison Square Garden it brings him to tears of appreciation for his fans. Anyone willing to acknowledge those who brought them this far earns respect from me.",1388448000,,3257,4.236714975845411

KH should be careful the lure of fame and money don't ruin his run as a comedic artist. Don't let your running buddies have you believing everything you say is funny. You are funny. That's no lie. But joking it up with the boys won't give you a long career. Stopping to think about what your theme is will. This show is disjointed compared to others of KH's. It mixes weak new material with stronger old material. (And not my favorite old material, at that.) The opening scenes run on too long and felt amatuerish. The end scenes would have made a perfect opening. I would have given this show two stars. But I like the guy. Hoping as he matures the work will get stronger.",1386547200,,769,4.202702702702703

5926830,2,B00EKR61BQ,"I love Kevin Hart but this was disappointing.  His other shows focused more on his kids and the fun and funniness of relationships.  This show is more about a relationship that is just sour.

There's only so many times you can hear women generically referred to as b*tch*es and still find it funny.",1382659200,4,298,4.584905660377358

5926833,3,B00EKR61BQ,He had his moments where he made me laugh so hard I cried but those were few and far between. I rented this just because it is kevin hart and I normally find him hilarious.  If your a fan of his you'll appreciate it but if this is your first time watching kevin hart I recommend seeing one of his other stand ups first.,1382400000,,319,3.984375

It had a couple good moments but besides that I was just looking at how much time remained and hoping it would end sooner. I do not recommend watching this movie, it is not worth watching the whole thing for like 2 or 3 funny moments.",1382400000,6,362,4.112676056338028

5926838,2,B00EKR61BQ,"I love Kevin Hart but  this wasn't his best stand up. It took forever for him to get into the comedy because the first 20-30 minutes are spent on him getting dissed at a party (lame and not funny) then the camera follows him and his crew on his worldwide comedy tour. He doesn't tell any jokes in this footage. It's just him saying thank you at the end of every show. Once you've endured the quite tedious beginning then we get into the comedy. I'll just be straightforward. His material (e.g., crazy girlfriend/wife, friends who can't cover for you, lying, relationships, etc) was done a long time ago. Been there done that. He may not have done it but other people have done. Plenty of people have done it. I was so bored with this stand up that I didn't even bother finishing it. I feel sorry for folks who saw this in the theater. Can we say ripped off?",1382400000,10,857,4.3229813664596275

5926841,1,B00EKR61BQ,"Without a doubt his worst piece of work yet... Hopefully not a foreshadowing of things to come... The only part of the video that was enjoyable was the skits leading up to the actual stand-up. Outside of that, most of his jokes were obviously fueled by anger towards his ex-wife, other material was filled with his usual 'noo, noo',usually funny but this time around it got pretty old... Wife & I couldn't even finish & ejected a little past the 30 minute mark. So glad this was Red-Box'ed though I still feel ripped off...",1382227200,,523,4.574468085106383
5926842,2,B00EKR61BQ,"I tried, but Kevin's just not that funny to me. The first 15 mins were spent on a skit that wasn't amusing. Once it finally got to the stand up portion, I was begging for more skits. Props to KH for living his dream by doing a show at MSG...I did enjoy that part. While I laughed a few times, the quality of the show did nothing for me. Die hard KH fans will probably love this, but I could've passed on this show.",1382227200,,414,3.9404761904761907

5926847,1,B00EKR61BQ,It wasn't as funny as his others. I would have been mad if I spent the price they were charging for them tickets in MSG. I would have been on fire!

After 15 minutes of him ranting and cussing back and forth with ""friends' in a club - - no comedy here - - he makes his way to Madison Garden to tell narcissistic stories that again lack humor.
