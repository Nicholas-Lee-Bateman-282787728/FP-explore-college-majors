1699368,2,B0000640UA,"A YOUNG LATINO THUG [JON SEDA] BETRAYS HIS OWN BROTHERS ONE BY ONE SO THAT HE CAN CONTROL THE STREETS OF LA. THE ACTING IS OK, BUT, THE PLOT IS MEDIOCRE AND THE MOVIE'S JUST NOT ALWAYS ON TARGET. I THINK THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN MOST OF THE GANGSTA MOVIES THAT'RE CURRENTLY AT THE VIDEO STORES RIGHT NOW, BUT, THIS MOVIE NEEDS SOME SERIOUS WORK. THAT'S RIGHT, THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY IS AN URBAN REWORKING OF ''RICHARD III'', THE CLAASIC SHAKESPEARE STORY. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, RENT IT. BUT DON'T BUY IT.",1081296000,6,502,4.527472527472527
1699369,5,B0000640UA,"This is one for the English teachers out there. The film takes a Shakespeare play [Richard III] and adapts it to a contemporary setting. Anyone who loves Shakespeare will enjoy watching how the plot line is used here. The actors all seem to be relishing their over the top perfomances...but isn't that one of the charms of the original character? I think yes. Buy this one, show it to your students, and discuss how Shakespeare borrowed from other sources.",1077148800,7,456,4.784810126582278
