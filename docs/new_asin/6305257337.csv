7887220,1,6305257337,"This video was a disappointment to my son, a Titanic fanatic, and myself.  It was not really about the Titanic at all. Most of the movie concentrates on the research submarine  that will go down and explore.  The narrator  seems more interested in waxing poetically about the tragedy and the sunset  than giving us real information.  There is no footage of the boat  whatsoever except about 10 seconds of shadows when they first figure out  where the boat is.  Unless you would like to find out more about the  research submarine, don't buy this video.",951436800,2,552,4.71578947368421
