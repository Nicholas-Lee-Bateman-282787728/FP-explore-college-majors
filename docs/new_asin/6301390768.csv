329630,5,6301390768,"I just saw Mighty Joe Young the other night and feel compelled to write a review of it.  Well of course I am a fan of giant monkey movies, which at their best never fail to have both a serious theme while also being quite  hillarious (why, for instance, is there a -giant- door on Kong's skull  island?  Is Kong sometimes a rather peacable and likable fellow that likes  to visit once he has a bride?)  Mighty Joe Young in this sense is perhaps  even better than Kong, although it lacks the power and archetypal vision of  that earlier classic.  Young makes up for this though in its surreal  sweetness--perhaps this came off very straight faced in 1949, but in 2000  we arn't buying it.
If you can follow this, cowboys go to Africa, where  they have one of the most unbelievably funny scenes trying to lasso Young  the giant (approx 15 ft high or so) gorilla, but then finally convince  Young's owner to ship her and the giant monkey to LA where they can star in  a lounge act.  Said lounge act features exploitational acts like Joe  playing tug-of-war with the strongest men in the world, and drunks throwing  pie plates at the giant monkey.
Of course, the story shows us Young as  the misunderstood kindly monkey who is humiliated by people who only see  him as a freak show--they actually get him drunk in one scene with  terrifying and also quite humorous results; I've always wanted to see lions  set free amongst the drunks!
Thus, unlike Kong, Young is a gentler,  kinder film, and this is in part what makes it so strange.  I really  couldn't help but think of films like Edward Scissorhands when seeing this,  which is why I think Burton might have really made a far preferrably remake  that caught both the serious and very very strange sides of this unique  film.
For fans of the giant monkey genre, or people who are just tired of  the usual fare, give this odd 1949 flick a chance, you won't be  dissapointed.",954374400,5,1922,4.48695652173913
329631,5,6301390768,"On the Disney Channel they demonstrated the robotics of how they made the huge gorilla character move like a living cast member, including facial expressions. Absolutely astounding the realism. Charlize Theron, did a  spectacular job of making us believe in the reality of the story. This  gifted young actress exhibited a sensitivity and and inner beauty that is  extremely rare. The film's jungle panorama and African music leaves you  with a wonder at the beauty of it all. My family has seen it twice and I  bought a copy to send to the grandkids.",924393600,2,551,4.819148936170213
329632,5,6301390768,"I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE AS A CHILD OF ABOUT 5, IT HAD A LASTING IMPRESSION ON ME. AS OF THIS DAY IT'S LIKE I JUST SAW IT YESTERDAY. ESPECIALLY THE SONG ""BEAUTIFUL DREAMER"" I AM ALMOST 46 SO I WOULD SAY THAT WAS A  ""LASTING"" IMPRESSION.I JUST WISH I COULD FIND THE VIDEO. I'M  AMAZED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS AN ORIGINAL  MIGHTY JOE YOUNG BEFORE THE DISNEY REMAKE.",915062400,,391,4.1866666666666665

329732,5,6301390768,"The Motion Picture ""Mighty Joe Young"" has proved more to be a learning experience this day than I knew. I'am of the opinion that the special features offered by the DVD  assisted this reviewer in knowing  the film better than  anything I might of known even of some time ago.  I'am in my late sixties with the original viewing of ""Mighty Joe Young"" occuring  perhaps in the late 1950's. I'am thinking of Million Dollar Movie that had the thematic song from ""Gone With The Wind"".That is how we viewed many films then and perhaps as things were once when something was shown it was something of a chore to see it again. Then,you could rent the actual reel to reel for some movies however like I said it would be a chore. I can recall a Merle Oberon film which my mother cared for and we did just that, we rented the reel to reel with the projector.  This does not in any way diminish the appeal  this particular motion picture has but it was much of the discussion as it concerns the contribution of Special Effects person in Ray Harryhausen that was most interesting. ""Mighty Joe Young"" is a very likable film however not everyone seems to know just how  these films are made. It seems that Joe Young started out in 4 different sizes, two sizes were of the 41/2 inches, and two were 21/2 inches. The cost  to the  film makers was nearly $2,000.00(1948-1949 dollars). These were terminator look a-likes whose mechanical ability is what you see when Joe Young is on the screen. The editing could often said to have a hard time as Joe Young was made to fit the scene,  Joe Young it can be said  appeared  to have a hard time fitting in. I think that is a very legitimate gripe that the editing appears to be a bit rough. Joe Young seems much larger at times yet when he does certain activities it is most certainly hard to figure. Ray Harryhausen said that,with this particular project he wanted to give Joe Young something of a personality. Indeed it is most probably this very interesting discussion on giving Joe Young a personality that may very well provided for much of why Joe Young is such a likable film. Joe Young is something of a hero as are the personalities of Greg (Ben Johnson) and yes even Max Ohara (Robert Armstrong). I felt that the initial scene filmed when O'hara is in Africa was very good. The attempt to lassoe Joe Young was good to very well done. See... no one was killed ,there was no blood and the cowboys showed that they to got up for a challenge. The opening scene when Joe Young is on stage is worth saying something about. ""Beautiful Dreamer"" played by Jill Young (Terry Moore) at the piano is a very good scene in fact it is a beautiful and as well terrifying scene. written by Stephen Forster(1826-1864) The song  is addressed to a ""Beautiful Dreamer"" who does not know or is not aware at all of the cares of this world  and it is thought that this sentimental parlor song that the ""Beautiful Dreamer"" may very well be dead. The appeal in the songs second stanza when addressing the ""wild lorelei"" is of a fading spirit which is ""queen of his heart"".This even today is sung by many as the songs enchanting ability seems not to have faded with time. A very excellent recording made some time ago can be had from the recordings of Bing Crosby(Bing Crosby was voted most admired man in 1943 as the voice of our troops overseas was heard here at home) however ""The Irish Tenors"" on their album ""Ireland"" have a most lovely recording of ""Beautiful Dreamer"".I have listened to both recordings and both should not be ignored. The tug of rope scene is another show stopper as the wrestlers were in fact just those persons. The introduction of Primo Carnera is for real as Primo Carnera was very much both a Heavy Weight Boxing Champion and a Wrestling Great. His prize fighting career was something like 88 Wins and 14 losses with 72 of those 88 wins being by knockout. He also wrestled, as a wrestler he compiled something like a 141 Wins against 1 Loss and 1 Tie. The tug of rope scene is excellent, Primo Carnera was just as he appeared. The scene of the orphanage is one of those scenes that might be said to have stood the test of time, it is in fact memorable. I can only suggest to whomever might read this that this film is very likeable, it is very enjoyable to think about, and can on occassion stay with you in heart and mind. Well worth a recommendation.",1491436800,,4390,4.429280397022333

329738,5,6301390768,"Believe it not but I was 10 years old and had never seen a real fire.  The orphanage on fire was so frightening and
after all these years I have not forgotten it.  The fascination with the film changing to a misty red while the fire rages on,
the children on the ledge and yet the film itself ends in such a wonderful way, something we don't see today.  The little
girl bartering with the natives is something we don't see today either (probably wouldn't be politically correct).",1468454400,,479,4.420454545454546

330219,5,6301390768,"The same crew that brought us the original King Kong must have decided it was something of a downer, so they offered us a different, more upbeat (and very funny) variation on the theme, complete with happy ending.

Mighty Joe is a huge 2000-pound gorilla, raised as an orphan by a human girl companion. Joe is no King Kong, he's a gentle, good-natured giant.

One of Ray Harryhausen's first stop-motion projects, Joe's expressive face and mannerisms - body language, personality quirks and the like - make for the most believable stop-motion gorilla on film.

(spoilers):

Mighty Joe and the girl get ""discovered"" and end up as a truly remarkable act in an African-themed 'coconut grove' night club, complete with a dozen African lions behind glass partitions..

It doesn't take long for a pair of drunks from the audience decide to go backstage to Mighty Joe's pen and introduce him to the joys of alcoholic intoxication, leading to what may be the single most outrageous scene ever filmed.

The ensuing ""giant-gorilla-on-the-loose"" scene pulls all the stops: A drunken, berserk Mighty Joe proceeds to demolish the night club, throwing lions around as the audience scrambles for the exits. The stop-motion Mighty Joe is, of course, throwing stop-motion lions, but those are real, live lions we see flying about, crashing into tables and running off!
  This has got to be the only film where you can actually see live, very-confused 500-pound African lions being catapulted across the room into furniture!

Everything works out for the best, of course. Plenty of good gags and cute touches, fun for adults and kids alike.",1206662400,,1621,5.018656716417911

330221,4,6301390768,"""Mighty Joe Young"" was a very entertaining film with a surprising amount of action. In fact, the last third to last half of this film is just about non-stop. it reminded me of King Kong, of course with a big age being brought to New York City for display and then things going haywire. This movie, however, has a happier ending than ""Kong,"" although it doesn't look like that will be the case near the end. It turns to be a very suspenseful movie in that last 30 minutes, especially.

Even though this was an early Ray Harryhausen special-effects effort (and he's interviewed in two features on the DVD), it still looks pretty hokey in spots. But in 1949, this must have been pretty cool. Hey, to be fair, some parts are decently realistic if you aren't too critical. One thing: they are fun to watch!

What made this movie better-than-average was the injection of some humor into this adventure story. Humor, and a bit of sentimentality as Mighty Joe is humanized to a degree. The big ape was funny while sitting in the back of a speeding truck eluding the police, and at the very of the movie he made most viewers laugh.

This movie is much better now that it's on DVD. The transfer is excellent; a nice picture. The commentary and bonus features are done well.  Overall, if you liked the 1933 version of King Kong, you'll like this. A lot of the same people were responsible for both films. This is pure entertainment.",1189987200,,1421,4.517509727626459

Great transfer to DVD and some very interesting extras.

330224,4,6301390768,"PLOT: The film begins in Africa in the late 1930s. The film focuses on a little girl named Jill Young, who lives in Africa with her father who is an American explorer. One day, two natives walk past Jill's house with a straw basket. Jill asks if she can see what is inside. To her amazement, it is an adorable baby gorilla. Jill gathers up some of her belongings, as well as her father's big flashlight, and uses them to buy the gorilla. She names the gorilla ""Joe"". Jills father later comes home and sees that his flashlight is gone. When he finds out that Jill used it to buy a baby gorilla, he immediately says that there is no way that she can have it. Soon enough, Jill's father begins to fall in love with Joe the same way she has, but he reminds her that they can't keep him forever. Some day Joe will grow into a large, ferocious gorilla. The film then jumps to New York City in 1949. A nightclub owner named Max O'Hara (King Kong veteran Robert Armstrong) is looking for a new theme for his club, and he is certain that he will find it in Africa. O'Hara journies to Africa with a team of cowboys led by Gregg Johnson (Ben Johnson) to capture some animals for the nightclub. The group of men are stunned to find Joe, who has miraculously grown into a ten-foot-tall gorilla. Jill (Terry Moore) is now a full-grown women and she rescues Joe from the men, who nearly shot him. She shows them that while Joe may look ferocious, he is very sweet and gentle. O'Hara knows that Joe is the perfect act for his nightclub, and he pleads with Jill to sign a contract. Eventually she agrees and she and Joe go to New York. Joe, billed as Mr. Joseph Young, is a huge smash with the public, but eventually several weeks go by and Jill is uncertain if the act will ever end. Is it possible that Joe can become a danger to others as well as himself?

COMMENTS: While not an official King Kong film, this RKO produced film is often considered one because it was created by many of the same people who created King Kong (1933). The film isn't exactly a horror film, but it does feature some of the best monster special effects ever seen on the screen. The story was conceived by Merian C. Cooper, who also wrote King Kong. Stop-motion master Willis O'Brien once again was hired to create the astonishing visuals, but by now they had been perfected a little bit more. Joe was created from a fifteen-inch tall armature puppet. A new type of hair was put on him so that the animator's fingerprints weren't visibile, as seen in King Kong and Son of Kong (1933). Because of time constraints, O'Brien was unable to do any of the actual animation himself. Most of the animation was done by his new protege, Ray Harryhausen. Harryhausen saw King Kong when he was 13 years old, and he wanted to be a stop-motion animator ever since. He eventually tracked down O'Brien and convinced him to take him in as his apprentice. Harryhausen made Joe move and behave more like a real gorilla, unlike the cartoonish behavior of Kiko in Son of Kong. He later went on to do some of the amazing stop-motion seen in films such as The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) and One Million Years B.C. (1966). Ultimately, Mighty Joe Young was succussful but not successful enough to earn back the $2.5 million it cost to produce the film. A planned sequel, Trazan Meets Joe Young, was cancelled. Willis O'Brien later received an Oscar for his work on the film--the only one he ever received. In 1998, Walt Disney Pictures remade the film. Joe was now created by special make-up effects master Rick Baker, who also created the King Kong suit in the 1976 remake of King Kong. Baker created Joe through the use of a man-sized costume, two full-scale animatronic puppets, and CGI. The storyline, however, was radically changed from the original. The remake featured cameos by Terry Moore and Ray Harryhausen. This DVD features the film in its original fullscreen presentation. It also features the theatrical trailer, two featurettes with Ray Harryhausen, and Commentary by Ray Harryhausen, Terry Moore, and Ken Ralston.",1174435200,,4069,4.536054421768707
330225,4,6301390768,"This could also be titled, ""A tale of four giant monkey movies"", since MJY and KK were both given remakes in recent years (for this review, I'll ignore the unfortunate 1976 KK remake). The plots for each is, by now, pretty much familiar to most people, although MJY has been overshadowed by KK. This is a pity. Growing up, I always loved this film. I liked the original KK, too, but always thought it took itself just a little too seriously. Also, as a child, I really didn't like that Kong was killed at the end. Kids don't really appreciate tragedy.

MJY has the heart and humor that KK lacked. Some would complain about maudlin sentimentality, and it does require a certain innocence to appreciate it. I was fortunate enough to first see it at an age when I still had that innocence. I'm not ashamed to admit that I can still see it that way after all these years. Disney remade MJY in 1998, but some of the innocence and charm were lost in translation. The '98 version was a very forgettable film and an unworthy successor to the original.

Comparisons to KK as well as the '98 remake are inevitable though, so let's address them (WARNING: some spoilers ahead)...

KK is pretty much a straightforward action film with interludes of unconvincing romance. The acting in KK is really quite awful. (Although Robert Armstrong plays pretty much the same part in MJY that he played in KK, he does it better in MJY.) But then, all of the human actors in KK are pretty wooden, and not helped all that well by the script. (Peter Jackson's KK remake is excellent, crippled only by the poor choice of Jack Black to play the Carl Denham character.)

By comparison, MJY also blends action and romance, but adds some notes of humor and sentiment. All of these have held up well over the years. One of the big differences between the original and the '98 remake is that the original seems more genuine in context. The original is really good storytelling, but the remake seems built on the same plot framework, but designed to appeal to focus group audiences. The acting in MJY is still inferior to the remake, but that's not enough to detract from the charm of the story. Peter Jackson obviously had some of the same feelings about the two that I did since he added some moments of lightness and sentiment to his KK remake that the original lacked.

KK's great weakness is that its ""moral"" is hopelessly naive from a modern perspective. ""Beauty killed the beast"" is not only corny, it ignores that what really killed Kong was human greed and meddling with the natural world. Both KK remakes have picked up on this. By contrast, MJY is a ""fish out of water"" movie where both Joe and Jill are seduced by a society they're too innocent to understand. As great storytelling, you root for them to be able to go home, and the story obliges in the end. Unlike KK, the moral of MJY is every bit as relevant today as the day it was made.

One weakness of the MJY plot is that Joe is, essentially, Jill's pet. Although this enhances the charm of the story, it detracts from its message about nature. No, Joe isn't a house pet, but he's still clearly domesticated. That Kong is just as clearly a wild animal enhances the sense of dread in KK's action sequences. KK turns that relationship on its ear, the making Ann Darrow character Kong's pet. One major difference between the original KK and Peter Jackson's remake is that the original suggested that the relationship between Kong and Ann was sexual on some level. The remake depicted Kong as a lonely creature and his pet human as a welcome companion.

I have to make one final observation, unrelated to reviews of any of these films... I find it fascinating to see the effect that these giant monkey movies had on the careers of their female leads. Without KK, no one today would be likely to remember Fay Wray. Alone among these actresses, Terry Moore was most likely to have been remembered, but more for her relationship with Howard Hughes than her work in MJY. The '76 KK remake launched the career of Jessica Lange just as the MJY remake launched the career of Charlize Theron. It will be interesting to see how Naomi Watts' career progresses after the latest KK remake.",1171065600,3,4207,4.556878306878307

Does anyone know what the movie makers were thinking when they applied this red tint?

I'm just scratching my head as to what effect the producers were trying to accomplish, because it fails miserably (at first I thought the color on my TV had gone off).  The movie is still terrific and the effects our still impressive when viewed today.",1142121600,,856,4.512987012987013
330228,4,6301390768,"The third in a trio of films by Merian Cooper, Ernest Schoedsack and Willis O'Brien's featuring giant apes , ""Mighty Joe Young"" has a heart of gold. He's a big ape with a soft spot for Jill Young (Terry Moore) that raised him. Promoter and nightclub owner Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong from ""King Kong"") and Gregg a cowboy from Texas (Ben Johnson)attack the 18 foot tall Gorilla when they first encounter him in the wilds of Africa. When they discover he can be friendly and that he's only protecting his turf, O'Hara sees Young as the lynchpin for his new nightclub. O'Hara convinces Jill to take Joe to New York for his nightclub based around an African theme.

Featuring dazzling effects that echo ""Kong"", ""Young"" may not have the amazing look of the previous film but the dazzling mix of animation and live action done by Ray Harryhausen under O'Brien's direction looks pretty impressive even today. While the story might be a little slow initially for modern audiences, it has a wonderful pay off and an ending that beats the remake by a mile.

Warner has done a terrific job of transfering ""Joe"" to DVD. The grain isn't quite as bad as ""Kong"" (the source material was, no doubt, in better shape)and Warner has restored the color to the fire sequence bringing the film close to its original glory. The commentary track features legendary animator Ray Harryhausen (who did much of the hands on animation), actress Terry Moore and visual effects Ken Ralston discussing the making of the film. There are also a duo of great extras. The Chiodo Brothers animators currently working in the industry interview Harryhausen about the effects work on the film. ""Ray Harryhausen and Mighty Joe Young"" takes a glimpse back to Harryhausen's work on this pivotal film with O'Brien (and the only film to win O'Brien and his crew an Oscar for visual effects). We also ge the original theatrical trailer as an added bonus.

A classic finally gets the restoration and loving care it deserves.",1133654400,15,1978,4.794721407624634
330239,4,6301390768,"This doesn't approach the status of ""King Kong"" but there is alot to like about ""Mighty Joe Young"".  The creature effects are excellent but that goes without saying because Willis O'Brien (""King Kong"") and Ray Harryhausen were the principal designers.  Memorable setpieces include Joe trying to elude capture by cowboys on horseback, Joe's trashing of an elaborate safari themed nightclub, and Joe's rescuing children from their burning orphange(Aw!!!).  I liked Robert Armstrong's reprise of his Carl Denham character from the original ""Kong"" in the person of impressario Max O'Brien.  Armstrong played this character type straight to the vest in ""Kong"" but here he mines some laughs out of it.  A young Ben Johnson contributes acting heft to a cowboy sympathetic to Joe's plight.  Terry Moore is fetching as Jill Young, Joe's owner.  In a nutshell, amiable entertainment that still enthralls almost sixty years since it's initial release.",1133308800,2,940,5.35374149659864
330240,5,6301390768,I've seen the movie 100 times. Yet watching it while listening to the commentary track was a brand new experience! Who knew half the interesting trivia associated with this gem! The other 2 bonus interviews with Ray are the things dreams are made of! Not only a super value for the money but so above and beyond my expectations its not funny. Did I mention I liked it?,1133222400,23,368,4.426470588235294
330241,4,6301390768,"Mighty Joe Young is a very moving, endearing film played with a wonderful earnestness. Other reviewers have noted positive aspects that I don't need to cover. An additional aspect of the film, which I have noticed, is the idea of home and family initiated in opening scenes between the child Jill and her father (Regis Toomey). Max O'Hara's (Robt. Armstrong) enticement, to have the adult Jill, obviously happy where she is with her simian friend, bring Joe to the States, should have the viewer definitely against the suggestion. One gets the notion that Ben Johnson's character, Greg, might be againts it. He looks about Jill's African farm, with its lush verdant beauty, and exclaims ""sure is pretty around here. I reckon this is my kind of country."" Along with the sentimental parts of the script, there are clever moments as well as a good deal of humor. There is a large collection of character actors of the era who can be found throughout the film. Mighty Joe Young also captures the flavor of its era by looking like classic film noir especially in the night club and Hollywood scenes many of which take place at night. This is a very entertaining movie with some real thought to the script and direction. I never tire of it.",1127088000,2,1234,4.717592592592593
330242,5,6301390768,"The Disney remake of ""Mighty Joe Young"" is excellent, but nothing beats the charm of the original film. With the original ""Mighty Joe Young"" you don't get the state-of-the-art special effects of the remake, but what you do get is a much better story which tugs at all your emotions. The climax of the film is very exciting, and so touching that it brings tears to the eyes. I won't give it away as to not spoil it. Great news, this film is finally being released in November 2005 along with the original ""King Kong"" and ""Son of Kong"" as a special collection. It most likely will be available as a single DVD as well. It should be a winner!",1122508800,7,639,4.333333333333333
330243,5,6301390768,"Tacked onto a double-bill with 1933's ""King Kong"", ""Mighty Joe Young"" should be considered Stop-Motion Animation 101 for film collegiates and aspiring special-effects men.  Though I viewed the films 2 nights apart, they are 16 years apart in their technological advances.  And the advances are (forgive the pun) monstrous.

Since I've been going over the Golden Age of Stop-Motion recently with ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"", ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""Clash of the Titans"", etc., to see the technique really bloom as it does in this sweet-but-mos-def-not-saccharine tale of a teenage white girl in Africa and the big ape lug she raised fom birth, is rather enlightening.  I'm 25 years old, but I was firmly entertained by this effects showcase.  It's a good one, I'm telling you.

I'll skim the plot for those who just want the gist: safari nightclub owner travels to Africa, lures Jill and her oversized simian pal Joseph Young to America to perform sideshow acts, human cruelty makes Joe go... apesh-t, Jill and her love interest intercept Joe and speed away back to Africa, but not before a noble pit stop...

No need to compare ""Kong"" and ""Joe"": same director, producer, writer, editor, and technical wizard -- Willis O'Brien.  A little-known ace up ""Joe""'s sleeve, however, is a young-but-bonafide budding genius named one Ray Harryhausen, credited as ""First Technician"" on the project.  His precocious mastery (under O'Brien's supervision) is certainly evident and an all-around wondrous sight to gaze on.  The SPFX techniques (rear projection, stop-motion blended with live-action) foreshadows what he would end up polishing in subsequent films, such as ""Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers"" and ""It Came From Beneath The Sea"".  Joe is given mannerisms, playfulness, and a CHARACTER like ""Kong"".  This 15-foot high (to scale) gorilla is one fleshed-out, emotive, angry, confused, but above all impressive creation.

And then they get him sloshed on 3 bottles of wine and burn his hand with a Zippo lighter (oops), which will lead him smack into the middle of two nightmarish set pieces (described in the editor's review).  The results, even to these CGI-accustomed eyes, were truly awesome in Webster's definition of the word.  Yeah, the film's black-and-white.  Sure, the acting's fairly pantomime and wooden.  But Mr. Joseph Young ensures that you will pardon all that, in case you have a bias on old films.

What is most endearing after it's all done is that the effects aid the relationship story BEFORE becoming an intense extravaganza.  Lo, the days when filmmakers actually knew how to do that stuff.  They called it ""craft"" back then...  ""Mighty Joe Young"" should probably be considered a really offbeat buddy-movie with an occasional flaring temper.  It's thoroughly entertaining, has a nice message to teach the kiddies, yet what happens in the story is distinctly adult, though less adult than ""Kong"".  Might want to wait 'til the kid's 10 to show 'em this one.  But this monkey's a real showstopper.

The 1998 remake:  GOOD EFFECTS WORK, again.  More syrup 'cause it's produced by Disney, more kid-oriented, but a very loveable leading man, nonetheless.  Still inferior to the original, but worth a watch.

""Mighty Joe Young""(1949): 4.5 stars, but I'll round up for him.  Joe's alright, like Argyle.",1107993600,11,3306,5.1482176360225145
330244,5,6301390768,"Yes, this something like is King Kong on a smaller scale, with a happier ending, but that's not the whole story. Joe is a huge, but not impossibly so, Gorilla, who along with his owner (or I could say, best friend) is brought out of Africa to star in a nightclub. If you think you've seen it before, you haven't, though.
This is less a monster picture than an animal-buddy film, along the lines of Old Yeller, or Turner and Hooch. Joe's more believable fifteen feet or so is a good choice by the film's designers and director. Joe doesn't stomp people to death or knock over skyscrapers. It's a get-out-the-handkerchief film that King Kong never could have been, with its monstrous title character.
But most importantly, this film has a place in cinema history for it's brilliant stop-motion animation. Willis O'Brien invented stop-motion for The Lost World (an old 1922 silent, not the sequel to Jurassic Park), polished it up in King Kong, and perfected it in Mighty Joe Young. Joe the gorilla is so real, there's no need to suspend your disbelief-- there is no disbelief. Only computerized graphic imaging has been able to equal Joe's realism. The gorilla has facial expressions that are beautiful to see; he is like a little kid in his expressions of love and wonder, and fear, a comparison that couldn't be made but for the perfect animation.
While this is a great ""family film,"" g-rated, and simply plotted, it's a grown-up movie. No people of any age will be able to tear their eyes from the screen.",1063584000,6,1506,4.686792452830189
330245,5,6301390768,"To begin with, when I first heard of the movie ""Mighty Joe Young"" I was only six or seven years old at which time I was living in the ""Little Old Island of Cuba"" located 90 miles from here and during that time our maid spoke to me about the movie in question. Then when my family and I immigrated to America in 1965 I all but forgot all about the movie. Then in 1967 when I was twelve years old and the local TV station showed movies at seven o'clock in the evening-when the local networks used to show movies-and I mean good movies-and not the garbage that they are showing nowadays-when I turned on the TV set, lo and behold they were showing ""Mighty Joe Young"" and let me tell you that I really enjoyed seeing it for the first time. Naturally, I could have recorded it, but unfortunately VCRs were not yet invented in 1967-let alone dreamed of and I had to be happy with getting the chance to see the movie. Well, as time marched on, in 1990 I had tha chance to see it again on VHS. And seeing it again really brought back some wonderful memories of my childhood. Now as far as the movie itself is concerned, well, let me say that it ranks right up there with the best of them. The latter being: ""King Kong"" and ""Konga."" Finally, suffice it to say that my mother does not like to watch horror movies and that is why I tell her that in my opinion those old horror flicks from the 1950s and 1960s-especially their special effects alone are worth their weight in gold! Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to say, Thank You, Amazon.com for bringing back the best years of my life!",1052265600,5,1589,4.247524752475248

330247,5,6301390768,"Well, for starters, I first heard about the above-mentioned movie, ""Mighty Joe Young"" when I was just a little kid growing in Cuba from a friend of the family who had seen it in the local movie theater. Incidentally, the aforesaid was dubbed in Spanish. Anyhow, then when I first came to America in 1965 and two years after we had all moved into our new house back in 1967 I had the opportunity to see ""Mighty Joe Young"" on television. Now let me tell you that was way back when they used to show the REALLY GOOD movies on television.  Anyhow, since I was a kid I did indeed liked and enjoyed watching the movie and as a matter of fact, I even wrote a letter to our family friend to tell her that I had seen the movie. Now being a kid I was unable to grasp its meaning. Then around 1992 or 1993 I was able to see it again on video and I enjoyed twice, perhaps three times as much than when I was a kid. Now as far as my rating is concerned, well, I give it FIVE SOLID stars-as an amateur movie critic. And finally, as far as remakes go, well, they can have them! Because when it comes to the classics I like to see the REAL MacCoy! And believe me, there is aboslutely NOTHING like the ORIGINAL!",1005091200,16,1194,4.080851063829787
