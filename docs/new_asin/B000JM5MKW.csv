It does take forever and you definitely don't burn one calorie but somehow it seems really beneficial.  I am frustrated because I am three months postpartum and I really like this workout but it is very long and is only supplemental to your muscular workout and cardio.  I am lucky and my baby is a great sleeper and I still don't have all that time I would need!  That being said, this Dvd definitely has value.",1470096000,,527,4.458333333333333
8152250,4,B000JM5MKW,"This DVD has very good exercises for alignment and balancing of the pelvis and hips. At first it does seem slow when compared to other exercise dvd's but really I need the break in between each set to rest and prepare for the next set because each exercise is actually a good deal more difficult if you really focus and use all the muscles. There are always certain muscles (ones which are not adressed on my regular exercise dvd's) which get stretched and strengthened after doing this DVD which I know are the ones which need to be stretched in order to straighten up my posture and body alignment.
I bought this a few years ago because my left hip was ""messed up"" after having children and carrying them on my hip. I also do a lot of other exercise dvd's to recover from having the children. But, I would like to say that I was not able to really appreciate this DVD untill I did the ""Stretch Away Hip Pain"" DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stretch-Away-Hip-Pain/dp/B002DGS0QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stretch Away Hip Pain</a>
Hope this is helpful.",1287100800,3,1100,5.049450549450549
8152251,5,B000JM5MKW,"Suzanne's teachings are revolutionary... If it wasn't for her I would be laid up in bed and feeling really desperate... She showed me how to hold my pelvic floor correctly, which is quite difficult to do while doing the exercises... the other reviewer stated she ""droned on,"" yet I think she is unaware that the exercises are therapeutic in nature and to be done correctly, not to just rush from one to the next...  After having learned to correctly hold my pelvic floor and core, which took several months to adjust and gain strength, then I was able to move quicker with the exercises... I am fortunate though because I am taking Suzanne's weekly pilates class and have seen her for one-on-one consultations...  She stated that if I had not come to see her, I would have been on disability soon... I can believe it because I've had my sciatic pain for years now... The pain has not gone away completely, yet I know how to comfortably manage it... some days are better than others...  I would recommend Suzanne to anyone with bodily pain...",1245110400,4,1041,4.646739130434782
8152252,3,B000JM5MKW,"I found this while looking for ways to strengthen my destroyed back (4 blown out discs, 2 with tears).  The exercises are good, but the woman leading them takes so long in-between starting one exercise, and then ACTUALLY starting it, that I find myself holding the fast-forward button throughout the whole DVD.  She keeps regurgitating the same nonesense about 'put a pillow here if it hurts' and she's got this droning voice. She gets you in position to start an exercise, then spends the next 4 minutes droning on about how it will go, which by then I've quit holding the position to wait for her to shut-up and start!  kind of like that.",1237248000,8,640,4.5964912280701755
