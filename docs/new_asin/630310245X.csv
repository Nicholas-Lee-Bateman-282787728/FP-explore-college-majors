577514,5,630310245X,"I had no idea I would like this movie so much. It's not the standard run of the mill film that everybody would like, but it's incredibly non-judgmental and sweet. I like that movies can show the best sides of human nature, and develop a male character who is so extremely non-judgmental of a woman and her human frailty, particularly for the time the film was produced.
In addition to the quality story line, the chemistry between the two lead characters is amazingly good. I have seen Cary Grant with his other onscreen ladies, and he does not always create a heat wave when he's in his romantic element. Oh, he's charming, al right. But he doesn't really appear to be interested in his leading ladies all that much. But in this movie, he seemed to be interested, and the chemistry was more than evident.
Good movie!",1068076800,16,817,4.5646258503401365
577515,4,630310245X,"""People Will Talk"" is a movie that I first stumbled upon while flipping channels one day.  Cary Grant plays Dr. Noah Praetorius, who both practices and teaches medicine with an apporach that is refreshingly modern, even by today's standards.  When young Deborah Higgins (Jeanne Crain) collapses, the good Doctor learns she is pregnant, unmarried, and suicidal.  After telling her a story about a frog to make her think she is not really pregnant, some things happen and he ends up marrying Deborah.  Meanwhile, Professor Rodney Elwell (Hume Cronyn) find Praetorius's novel methods abominable and is trying to find out the truth about not only the good Doctor but his strange companion, Mr. Shunderson (Finlay Currie).  The film's climax is an inquisition into Praetorius's past (which keeps him from conduction his orchestra made up of all the school's med students), where it seems that he cured people in a backwater town as their butcher.  However, the more Elwell goes after Praetorius, the better the good Doctor looks.  Then there is the unbelievable truth about Mr. Shunderson.
For me and a lot of other people the strengths of this film outweigh its weaknesses.  The proposal scene does not really work, Grant's performance goes off in different directions from time to time, and you have to think Professor Elwell is too smart to be this stupid.  But for me the reason I always watch at least the end of this film whenever I can is that the payoff for the mystery of Mr. Shunderson just bowls me over.  Walter Slezak is wonderful as always playing Professor Barker, Praetorius's stout supporter, and although it might be a tad forced I love the scene where the three men are playing with the good Doctor's new train set.  Hume Cronyn creates an extremely bitter little man to be the story's villain (pay attention to the little details of his performance).  Basil Ruysdael does a nice job as the Dean, who finally restores sanity to the proceedings.  Certainly there are massive holes in ""People Will Talk,"" but for me the sum of the whole is greater than the parts. I know lots of better films that are not as enjoyable as this quirky little film.",992476800,107,2157,4.828804347826087
577516,5,630310245X,"This movie reminds me of Miracle on 34th St.  It has the same gentle tone, though with a few more villains, and the same quality of cast.  Both films used character actors perfectly cast.  There are a few scenes that, to modern eyes, are unintentionally funny -- an open hospital ward with ashtrays on the window sills, but the overall effect of the movie is the feeling that if there wasn't a Dr. Noah Praetorius, there should have been.  The observations on patient care ring at least as true today as when the movie was made.",983404800,5,528,4.46875
577517,5,630310245X,"Another one of Joseph L. Mankiewicz's films to be lost in the wake of All About Eve, People Will Talk is a terrific comedy/drama featuring a wonderful cast.  Cary Grant is Dr. Praetorius whose treatment of patients is somewhat controversial and unconventional.  When he befriends a young, unmarried pregnant woman (Jeanne Crain), Grant finds himself the focus of an investigation lead by a jealous collegue (Hume Cronyn) at the university where they both teach.  Grant's interest and concern for Crain goes so far as his proposing marriage.  And then there's the matter of Mr. Shunderson (Finlay Currie), Grant's seemingly simple-minded, yet constant companion.  No one seems to know the details of Mr. Shunderson's life, except Grant, and he's not telling.  Not a huge hit when first released, People Will Talk has developed an almost cult following today, and like many past film ""failures,"" it's now considerd a pretty good film.  Perhaps it was ahead of its time, but it has some wonderfully rich characterizations, including great turns by the aforementioned Currie, Hume Cronyn, Walter Slezak, Sidney Blackmer, and a terrific bit by an unbilled Margaret Hamilton as Miss Pickett to keep the narrative moving.  My favorite scene is Grant's visit to Crain's uncle's house (she and her father life with her uncle).  Grant, Blackmer, Currie, and Crain are all sitting on the front porch.  Crain objects to being the center of their discussion and refuses to leave the porch.  She goes so far as to scream the cook's name ""Bella"" at the top of her lungs, rather than move from her perch.  What the movie does say about the practice of medicine and human relationships is perhaps more relevant today than when first released in 1951.  As with most Mankiewicz films, it is successful on the surface.  If there was another intent by the director to tell another tale or an allusion to something else, look at this as an added bonus.  Fans of Cary Grant will not be disappointed; this is one of his best and most relaxed performances on film.  And fans of Jeanne Crain will be pleased as well.  Her role is the more difficult one and she pulls it off quite well, besides looking beautiful in ordinary farm-girl dress.  Any way you slice it, you'll be talking about People Will Talk.",981504000,128,2279,4.875324675324675
577518,3,630310245X,"Cary Grant stars as Dr. Noah Praetorius, a gifted physician who believes that his patients' emotional and spiritual states are critical to their overcoming physical challenges.  There's a lot of mystery surrounding Grant's past, and Grant plays the character with such an even balance it adds to the mystery.  He's given a lot of preachy speeches to deliver, some of which work and some of which don't, but Grant makes the character believable.  Jeanne Crain is less successful as the young woman that Grant saves.  She never zeroes in on her character's personality, although that may be, in part, a fault of the script.  The rest of the cast does well, including Finlay Currie as Grant's mysterious, quiet manservant and shadow.  The film left me with an odd feeling.  I felt I was being preached to, but I did enjoy learning about the puzzle that was Grant's past and the role that Currie played in it.  This is an unusual film, difficult to describe, that will fascinate some and frustrate others.  It did both for me.",981158400,12,1022,4.761363636363637
577519,4,630310245X,"Though this video doesn't stint on Cary Grant's usual charm, it really isn't one of his typical star vehicles.  Rather it's an odd story about an odder man and his unexpected (and perhaps unbelievable) tumble into love  and marriage.  Even with the mysteries of who Praetorius is and what's up  with Mr. Shunderson solved by the last scene, questions remain, and in  those questions lie much of the film's appeal.  The weak link here is  Jeanne Crain's mannered performance as a young, unwed mother.  Crain seems  to be acting in another film all together, and tends to be distracting,  though this does add to the overall quirkiness of the film.  A fantastic  cast which includes Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn, Margaret Hamilton (in a  small but memorable role), Finlay Currie and Sidney Blackmer, makes this  film a delight.",939340800,15,823,4.912408759124087
577520,5,630310245X,"This film certainly stands the test of the nearly 50 years since its release.  Cary Grant is at the apex of his physical charm, and under Mankiewicz direction, gives one of his most subtle performances as the  mysterious Dr. Praetorius. The delineation of all characters is rounded and  complex: unusual to find outside of a novel or a stage play. Although one  premise in the plot (the stigma of unwed pregnancy) is dated, the scenes  involving the small minded bigotry of ""little men"" are worth  seeing again and again.  The supporting cast, including Hume Cronyn as the  vilain, and the actor who plays Jeanne Crain's uncle, are deserving of  special kudos.  This is a rare example of a movie that entertains while  subtly imparting a lasting message.  It also keeps one intrigued waiting  for the solution to the mystery of Mr. Sunderson: a solution you won't soon  forget.",931996800,19,877,4.837837837837838
577521,5,630310245X,"One has to ask where AFI was in not selecting this movie as one of the 100 best of the last 100 years.  ""People Will Talk"" has to be the best kept movie secret in the history of filmdom.
The characters are well  developed and are all either lovable or laughable.  Margaret Hamilton turns  in a hilarious performance in a brief supporting role.  Grant and Crain  exhibit a great deal of on-screen chemistry matched by very few duos.  I  saw this movie by chance, and loved it so much that I immediately bought a  copy and was mighty glad that Fox saw fit to just recently release it on  video.  I can't wait until my son comes home from college to share the  pleasure of this film with me.",918000000,6,688,4.248062015503876

Now don't get unfair expectations, it is not on a par with the Hitchcock classics.  The story is silly fluff with huge plot holes. But, it is not what you think.  This
movie was released in 1951 in reaction to the McCarthy hearings that were hurting Hollywood producers, directors, writers, and actors. The story is a not so subtle back handed slap at the ignorance and prejudice of the time. There would be greater movies like ""Inherit the Wind"" and  ""The Crucible"" that also strike back.  But, this one is gentle with humor that reminds us of how good men and women can be hurt. Even so they will rise above the situation and do what they can to help others.

there are several scenes that stand out in this film.  my favorite is the little monologue served up to prof. elwell by mr shunderson at the end.  but there's also shunderson's story as told by him and dr praetorius.

578629,1,630310245X,"For the life of me I cannot understand why anyone would think this movie isn't a gobsmackingly awful, jaw-droppingly preposterous, astonishingly wrong-headed fiasco. That Darryl Zanuck, Joseph Mankiewicz, Cary Grant, Jeanne Crain, Hume Cronyn and a bunch of other professionals got within 100 miles of this stinking pile is just as bewildering. Mankiewicz adapted it, terribly, from a creaky, ridiculous 1930s German morality play. Maybe the characters and action seemed vaguely realistic in their original context (though I doubt it), but updated to America in 1951 they make absolutely no sense -- it's like watching Venusians doing a play about Earthlings. Grant's character is an unbearably smug, pretentious, unethical liar, yet the hero. Crain's character is a moron and an insult to womanhood, one of the most sexist caricatures in 1950s film, which is saying a lot. She's so dumb she can't tell whether or not she's pregnant. Cronyn's character seems air-lifted from an Viennese melodrama of the 1880s -- in fact, the whole morality of the story does. The dialogue in the last act suddenly switches from something sort of resembling colloquial American speech in the 1950s to absurdly stilted Victorian stage-speak that is utterly bizarre in context. The Grant-Crain romance is implausible in the extreme, the Grant-Cronyn conflict is incomprehensible in a 1950s American setting... I could go on. It's just mind-boggling. What on earth is there to like about this debacle, except to gawk at it as an astounding example of High Kitsch at its very worst?",1444521600,4,1561,5.248

Was some of the action implausible? Sure, but I was more than willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of the overall production  e.g., as to why the doctor wanted to marry the girl; lets assume he saw and felt things other than the few depicted. Besides, I was 16 when this movie came out, 10 when Jeanne Crain appeared in State Fair, and I was devastated to learn that she was 10 years older than I, so I didn't have a chance.

Many people believe God's laws are more strict than society's and maybe they are at first but when we make a societal faux pas, how forgiving are they?  And how forgiving is God when we come to him?  Because of the unstable nature of society, I choose to think about not what people think and say about me but what God thinks and says about me.

A woman finds herself single,pregnant and a Dr. who falls in love with her who carries not only her secret but one of a friend. The reason for the # 2 rating is the young woman shoots herself because of her diagnosis of pregnancy (off screen) partially because of the social stigma and  mainly the heartbreak and trouble it would cause to her father, as well as her questioning her own moral character.  This is movie I can watch with my children (7 and 8 )running around because it is done in such a tasteful manner. It is not gruesome or illicit but then again it doesn't hide the issue as if it doesn't exist.  So to be clear I give it amazons 5 star for family quality and story, then my personal guideline on age appropriateness.

Hume Cronyn -- in a nice performance as a curmudgenly medical doctor/professor -- is jealous of Grant.  He goes after Grant to try to smear him and get him dismissed from the college where Grant is also a medical doctor/professor.  Cronyn throughout his career could play anything and could play any age.  He was still fairly young when this film was made, but he manages to give the viewer the impression that he is a crotchety old guy who can't stand anyone who is more popular or skilled than he.

Jeanne Crain somehow pulls off a cringe-worthy character whose dialogue at times is so dumb you want to scream -- but it doesn't matter because she does a good job of making you believe that she believes who she is.

Margaret Hamilton -- (Wicked Witch of the West -- Wizard of Oz) -- supplies the inside info so Cronyn can go after Grant.

Walter Slezak plays a professor and friend of Grant's.  He gives the film the comic relief it needs.  Why the film has Grant as the conductor of the college orchestra is a mystery -- unless it was supposed to be a counterpoint to his doctor role -- and to allow Slezak a fine comic bit while playing a cello.

The production code was till in effect when this film was made, which probably accounts for some of the strange dialogue, and of course, the ""happy"" ending -- mandatory at the time.

It is not a long film.  Worth seeing.",1431388800,,1550,4.469750889679715

There are some high caliber performances by Cary Grant, Jeanne Crain, Walter Slezak, and of course -- Sidney Blackmer.  A great family film.  Unforgettable!",1431043200,,462,5.093333333333334

580434,5,630310245X,"This film has remained in the top 20 films on my (admittedly long) personal list, and I watch it again at least once a year.  Before it became available on DVD, I often traveled to film society screenings of the film and dragged my wife or various friends along.  I don't know anything about the Curt Goetz play that was the source material, but this film is simultaneously ""about"" (1) the practice of medicine focused on patients as whole human beings, (2) death and dying (dealt with in ways that are unpredictable), (3) personal loyalty and friendship, and (4) the witch-hunting tactics and atmosphere of the McCarthy era, which not coincidentally was in full swing in 1951 when this film was released. If this film could be said to illustrate a set of values, I'd say  they are ""humanist"" values. As you might expect from a film that combines light comedy and some drama and that was both directed and scripted by Joseph Mankiewicz, the dialogue is sophisticated and sparkling.  Real human beings usually don't talk like this, in beautiful complete sentences, but they would talk this way in a closer-to-perfect universe, and here a very professional cast (Grant and Crain, Walter Slezak, Finlay Currie, Hume Cronyn, Sidney Blackmer, and an uncredited Margaret Hamilton in the opening scene) deliver Mankiewicz's lines with polish and panache.  The characters who come off badly in the film are those who are unkind, envious, narrow-minded, or scheming. The plot builds nicely to the terrific faculty hearing / trial sequence in the last 20 minutes, when Grant, Slezak, and Currie really shine and reveal the mysterious past of Currie's character and how he came to be the constant companion of Grant's Dr. Praetorius.",1417046400,,1722,4.965277777777778

In those days, the musician's union required that all portrayed musicians actually be the real deal, professional musicians.

Jeannie Crane and Cary Grant are some of my favorites.  This was a perfect role for Grant, and he played his character perfectly.  I wish comedies today could be more like the old ones.  Everything doesn't have to be stupid slapstick.  It can also have a meaningful story.  In this comedy/drama,  the author develops all the characters and you like each one of them, even the old grumpy professor (Hume Cronyn) who was trying to get Cary Grant's character, Dr. Praetorius  fired.  It was so funny watching him trying so hard to ruin Praetorius and then to see him (Cronyn) fail.  It is obvious that he was so jealous of Praetorius' success at the university and in life itself, that he was willing to do most anything to discredit him.  Instead of doing that, he proved just how really special Praetorius was, when the whole story of Mr. Shunderson (Finlay Currie) was revealed.  It was near the end of the movie and was just too special to miss.  In fact it was quite unbelievable and simply amazing.  This was just one of the story lines that showed that Praetorius was a man of great character and self sacrificing at the same time.  Another involves Jeannie Crane's character.  It was a feel good movie, sure.  But it is also a good reminder that there really are men and woman out there who are like Dr Praetorius.  Too unbelievable?  Only to the old curmudgeons in  life.

580732,4,630310245X,"This might be one of the odder movies Cary Grant ever did, but in its own way it's wonderful. Based on a German play by Curt Goetz that was produced the previous year - which explains why Grant's character's real name is Ludwig - he plays a doctor at an unspecified university in the United States (the campus scenes were shot at Princeton) who attracts the envy and enmity of one of his peers, a weasel of a fellow named Elwell (Hume Cronyn). Elwell seems obsessed with driving Praetorius out of the faculty by exposing his supposedly shady past. It turns out, however, that Praetorius is a most selfless and noble person, and Grant plays him so well he makes you wish you could be just like him. He is fiercely devoted to his patients - to the point where he seems to have married one (Jeanne Crain) to save her life. With Finlay Currie as an obsessively loyal sidekick, Walter Slezak as a humorous colleague, Sidney Blackmer as a friendly father-in-law, and the inimitable Margaret Hamilton in a neat cameo role. Joseph L. Mankiewicz directed and wrote the witty, sophisticated script the year after he did All About Eve, which won Best Picture. My favorite line (by Slezak): ""The trouble with you, Elwell, is that you've never had a cadaver or your own, much less one that bit your finger.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1378771200,,1545,5.362139917695473

All-in-all, I believe that Grant put on a very good performance, and I thought that Crain was exceptional as well.  I'm sure with the abortion concepts in this film, she probably took a lot of flack, so she must have been a brave woman.

I found it full of agreeable delights:  Cary Grant's humorous patter as a medical school professor, ""Dr. Praetorius""; an unexpected plot about an unwed mother; some talk that points to a future of holistic medicine; medical students who wear coat and tie to every class; some nice character acting in the small parts; a mysterious manservant; and some Mr. Chips scenes as Cary Grant directs a student orchestra and chorus in a stirring performance of the old academic song, ""Gaudeamus igitur.""

581086,5,630310245X,"""People Will Talk"" is a funny, warm, and wonderful social commentary on the importance of compassion and tolerance.

Cary Grant  plays Dr. Noah Pratorius, a competent but eccentric obstetrician and medical school professor. He is genuinly concerned about each of his patients as individuals and and puts their welfare ahead of all other considerations. His success and popularity, as well as his disregard of convention, make him a object of attention and discussion (Hence the title, ""People Will Talk""). In particular he incurs the jealous attention of Dr. Elwell, a petty, insecure, unpleasant little colleague. Elwell launches his own investigation into Dr. Pratorius' background  hoping to uncover facts he can use to destroy  him.

Meanwhile, we watch as Dr. Pratorius deals with a suicidal pregnant woman his own unique way,, handles his mysterious manservant who almost always accompanys him, and generally goes about putting compassion for individuals first while caring little what people might think. Finally, when Dr. Elwell has all the information he thinks he needs, he arranges a hearing in which his uncovered evidence is introduced  before a committee. We find that Dr. Pratorius is even more unconventional than we imagined, but his explanations produce a result that Dr. Elwell little expects.

A movie that gently reminds us to be a little wary of conventional wisdom and judgemental behavior.",1347321600,,1413,5.366515837104072
581087,5,630310245X,"I saw this movie last night. My mother had recommended it. It was excellent. Classic Cary Grant. But more important to me was the story it told. People Will Talk is a  1951 remake of a German film that came out the year before and the plot is basically Humanism vs. traditionalism. As a Humanist, I loved it.

The basic story is that you have a doctor practicing what we now call Humanistic Medicine who is a) being challenged for unethical conduct by a colleague and b) who falls in love with a pregnant woman, which is obviously scandalous for the time. But what gets people talking is actually his mysterious friend who is like a man servant to him, but who is actually just a very good friend. This friend has his own story that again, highlights the applied humanist ethics of our lead character. And yes, it is very powerful.

Dr. Praetorius, our lead, runs a clinic where patients are considered humans and not inmates. They are real people to be treated with compassion and not just as lumps of flesh to be cured. As much attention is paid to their mental health as it is to their physical health. And if you were wondering why more doctors don't practice medicine this way, you will be glad to know that there is a modern movement to encourage doctors to approach their work with exactly this attitude. It is promoted by the Gold Foundation (for Humanistic Medicine).

Dr. Praetorius' relationship with the woman pregnant out of wedlock and her family is compassionate, ethical, and responsible and ultimately very loving. As is his relationship with his friend Shunderson. Shunderson is a beautifully written character and well acted by Finlay Currie.

This movie covers a variety of difficult topics but ultimately encourages all of us to lead ethical and compassionate lives and to do what is right by others. It doesn't matter that people will talk, as Dr. Praetorius shows, there is joy to be found living life ethically, fully, intentionally and compassionately.",1340668800,,1977,4.769005847953216
581088,1,630310245X,"Avid Cary Grant fan. This is bar none the worst role he ever had to try to make sense out of. His speeches are delivered in a preachy, supercilious, sneeringly long-winded way that seems bitter against any other doctor. As someone who has had to deal with dozens of doctors and surgeons I do see the point that this film is trying to make, but there are a hell of a lot of doctors who have spent their lives - literally - saving the lives of others. Praetorious says a few things, too, that makes him sound like an utter quack.  And giving out so much candy, I assume his  brother is a dentist. Bottom line: Trying to do ""Message"" over ""Story"" is bad medicine.",1338508800,5,660,4.272
581089,4,630310245X,"As an action adventure fan, and one who has lacked an appreciation for romantic comedy, ""People Will Talk"" has been a revelation. Though it starts out somewhat draggy and boring with an opening scene in the administrative office of one Dr. Rodney Elwell (Hume Cronyn) with the craggy Margaret Hamilton setting the scene with him for some character exposition, your patience will be richly rewarded if you just hold on a few minutes for Dr. Noah Praetorius (Cary Grant) to show up.

The setting is a medical school, with all it's bureaucratic trappings, and Grant as Dr. Praetorius is an educator with the magic touch of a healer - and a holistic approach to medicine that includes the mind as well as the body. He is also an orchestra conductor, which serves as the musical focus of this movie.

One of his students faints in class in the presence of a cadaver, and thus the real story begins. Jeanne Crain is Grant's co-star, and she plays the beautiful and bewildered Deborah Higgins, pregnant, unmarried, and uncertain of her future.

I have one word to describe Cary Grant after seeing this film: magnanimous. Of course, no ordinary person in real life could be this kind and altruistic, still it is a pleasant fantasy -- and an exemplary lesson in the art of being human. In the end, Cary Grant is just Cary Grant - an actor with a style and charisma so well-entrenched and so well-anticipated that he is virtually a brand unto his own.

Cary Grant reaches the threshold of an addiction here, seriously. Every nerve impulse is so right you cannot take your eyes off him. The 1950's were his golden years. People Will Talk is, to be sure, a comedy-drama, but right up there with North by Northwest in terms of wit and style. If you want to see Grant out of the Hitchcock mold, but NOT in romantic slapstick, this is a film to see and savor. He's the exact same Grant as you'll find in North by Northwest, a ""Dr. Thornhill.""

The third, wonderful player is Praetorius' rock steady handyman, butler, and all-around pal Mr. Shunderson, whose past is cloaked in mystery.

In the end though, it is the story here that triumphs. Goetz and Mankiewicz's screenplay is unpredictable and quirky at every turn. And very human. And once the story gets going, it won't let go of you!

This is really an early take on holistic medicine vs medical bureaucracy, and makes it's contribution to the HMO vs human being argument. Very high rating on this picture, a real find!",1315872000,,2460,4.641379310344828
581090,5,630310245X,"I had heard of this film though never seen it until today - I am a child of the Sixties and the glory of this film is that it is kind, tolerant, moral, funny, unpredictable and shows a wonderful humanity. The moral is just this: we all want to assume the worst in people if they don't conform to our norms - Cary Grant was wonderful in his love of helping his patients with kindness and understanding - not just tests, surgery, medicine etc. It is a tale of what we humans are missing: people who truly care and want the best for each other. This may be a rather idealistic interpretation but I don't think I'm wrong. Considering the time it was made (early 50's) it was a special and idealistic film - the McCarthy era was hitting Hollywood and anyone who could say that Goodness is sometimes not always ""seen"" and that Bad can appear ""good"" - well, this was such an original film - that you must get through the sometime stiff approach and listen to the sublime humor and common sense!",1305849600,2,987,4.34054054054054

It's too bad that Cary Grant had such classic good looks because it made it inevitable that he play leading man roles.  I think I've seen almost every Cary Grant film and he has never played a romantic lead successfully.  That scene on the train in North by Northwest - ugh. He is not romantically believable in People Will Talk, Charade, To Catch a Thief, The Philadelphia Story, Suspicion, Father Goose, Notorious etc.  He should have been portrayed as the essential bachelor.

On the other hand he is a fine actor.  Being slotted into romantic leads allowed him to relax into a sterotype.  He would have been great in action films, comedy (Arsenic & Old Lace) or anything else that would have stretched him as an actor.  While he was not particularly successful as a romantic lead in this film, People Will Talk, he was first-rate as an unconventional physician and wonderfully exuberant as a conductor.

581145,4,630310245X,"...shows his classic bent by bringing the story of Dr Praetorius to life. Cary Grant is the mysterious gynecologist who treats his patients holistically. (If my doctor looked like Cary Grant I think I would swoon and faint dead away). He is vaguely aware that he has an enemy in Dr. Elwell (wonderfully played as a fussy, nibbling, gerbil of a man by Hume Cronyn). Cronyn is on a witch hunt (it is the fifties after all) to run Praetorius off the faculty of the university where they teach. Having hired a private investigator, he knows that Praetorius may or may not  really be a doctor, and also that Praetorius' ever present companion is a weird and maybe shady person. Consequently, Praetorius' problems mirror the problems of leftists in the country at the time. He may or may not have done something questionable, it doesn't matter, Elwell will get him anyway, and he is branded by the company he keeps. These were issues that must have been dear to Mankiewicz' heart as he helmed the Director's Guild during the focus of HUAC on Hollywood subversives. Mankiewicz was himself suspected of being such a subversive, and went through a hearing at the Guild similar to the one Grant goes through in the film. Fortunately, Mankiewicz' outcome was as satisfying as Grant's in the film. All of the background is interesting, but the film must stand alone as entertainment. I think it does.

This is not the typical Cary Grant comedy where we expect snappy dialogue, his incomparable doubletakes, and exciting heat with his leading lady. In this adaptation of a German play, the dialogue is witty, not snappy, the doubletakes make way for pregnant pauses for the audience to consider carefully, and the heat with the leading lady is a bit more tepid. (No slight to  Jeanne Crain, I am a fan of hers, but the situation in which the characters find themselves is more conjugal than hot). The script is perfect for Mankiewicz, who was raised in a literate home by an academician. The score is classical and lovely, and the message is clear. Folks can be unconventional, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions about character without all of the facts, and people who properly mind their own business don 't need to pry into  the lives of others who are acting within their rights under the law.

The problems with the film are that some of the scenes are stagey, and the transitions from one scene to another are a bit choppy. Jeanne Crain (whom Mankiewicz did not like or appreciate) is sometimes not clear in her interpretaion of her character's mood and emotions, so I thought her performance was a little confusing in some of her scenes.

Finlay Currie is really splendid as Mr. Shunderson, stage actor Walter Slezak really shows his flair for comedy, and Margaret Hamilton is wonderful in her opening scene. She sets the film up perfectly as one in which the audience needs to  pay attention as we are in for something completely different.",1280966400,3,2937,4.747058823529412
581146,5,630310245X,"I just saw this on the fox movie channel. Now it's in my Amazon shopping cart. I missed the first half hour, so I'm looking forward to seeing the whole movie.

Near the end, when Shunderson (Finlay Currie) told professor Elwell (Hume Cronyn) that he was a small man, not meaning his physical stature, but his condition of heart and mind, that spoke volumes. The whole interrogation scene was great.

I really don't understand how anyone could give this movie a low rating. Perhaps it is a condition of the heart. Maybe after I see the whole movie, I won't feel quite the same. But I think not.

The facial expressions of Cary Grant as he conducted the orchestra were a little overplayed. He seemed a little too happy. And that detracted from his poise and dignity. But that's the only thing that seemed a little out of place.

581204,5,630310245X,"If you love romance movies, you cannot skip this one.  Not only is it one of the very best romance movies, it is also one of the very best Cary Grant movies.  Win-win in other words.

Grant plays a renowned gynecologist and college professor,  Doctor Praetorius, in this 1951 glorious black and white film. He is the target of jealousy by his peers who attack him for unconventional practices, including for his having a hulking assistant.  But it is more sinister than that.  For the film's director, Mankiewicz, was targeted by McCarthyism in that era.  Thus, Grant is Mankiewicz's stand in for when he was the main target for a McCarthy attack upon the Director's Guild.

While dealing with this 1950s mindset, Grant takes on a new patient played by Jeanne Crain. She is pregnant, unmarried and attempts suicide as a result. Grant sets out to save her. This is not enough for you to be able to separate it from the romance movies of today. What separates it is how much better it is straight across the board than the vast majority of them.  First, a man is playing the lead whereas a lot of today's romances are headed by boys. Likewise, a woman is playing the lead.  No one would ever refer to Grant and Crain as a boy and a girl.  There is real electricity when they come together and there is not any silliness as its basis. Grant has such a lovely, light touch when anyone else would have been terribly over melodramatic with the same material.

The screenplay is also first rate as is the direction. Mankiewicz had already won a few Oscars and did not waste his time directing inferior scripts.  The screenplay sparkles and you hate for it to end.

I can guarantee that if you are a woman you will love this.  It is irresistible.

The audio is excellent and I detected only a couple of defects in two scenes  in the video. All in all it is a very good transfer.

Although made in 1951, it is refreshingly modern and mature in its content yet it is a feel-good film in spite of the serious nature of some of the subject matter. Cary Grant plays Dr. Noah Praetorius, a medical doctor and professor at a college who also runs his own low-cost clinic. Hume Cronyn plays a fellow doctor and professor who hates Grant's character. He is one of those fellows who doesn't have to be passed over because of someone else or feel he has been unjustly treated to dislike that person. He just has to look around and see someone who is well-liked and successful where he is not to hold a grudge. The wonderful thing about Praetorius that Cronyn's character cannot grasp is that it is not that Praetorius is exercising tremendous willpower in order to to do good because he feels he must live up to some kind of code of conduct. He is just a man with a generous spirit anda a healing soul.  Dr. Praetorius' constant companion is Mr. Shunderson. He isn't in the actual employ of Praetorius, he is just always at his side and has no apparent medical training of any kind. It is the constant presence of this mysterious older man on which Cronyn centers his search for some dirt on Praetorius to hopefully eject him from the university.

Further complications arise when Dr. Pretorius treats a young woman (Jeanne Crain) who turns out to be pregnant by her fiance who has just died in combat. The young woman attempts suicide upon hearing her condition. After Dr. Praetorius saves her life Mr. Shunderson points out that nothing has changed, the girl is still all alone and in trouble, and will therefore likely try suicide again.

These two subplots set up what could have been a very tragic film but ends up being an uplifting movie about the triumph of the better side of human nature made at the height of McCarthyism. You might even call it a kind of romantic comedy. I hadn't seen this film in years and for some reason wrongly remembered it as having taken place at Christmas. In fact it takes place in the spring. I guess my memory had more to do with the fact that it has a kind of ""spirit of Christmas"" feeling in it the same way that ""Boys' Town"" does. In fact, ""Boys' Town"" is even in one of Warner Bros. Holiday collections even though it has nothing to do with Christmas.

Dexter Haven (we named our first-born pug ""C. K. Dexter Haven."") If someone asked what was Cary Grant's ""best"" role, I would have to say Dr. Noah Praetorius in ""People Will Talk.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/People-Will-Talk/dp/B0000DD780/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">People Will Talk</a>

Where to begin: Joseph Mankiewicz was making a poignant and powerful  statement (as a victim of the McCarthy era) of witch hunts and the zealots who fuel them.

The victim (who really isn't in the end) is Dr. Noah Praetorius, gynecologist and professor, who owns a medical clinic, and happens to be ahead of his time. Dr. Praetorius has the temerity to do more than just push pills - he also treats the human spirit and psyche. His philosophy is that attitude is key in the healing process.

Jealousy and small mindedness fuels the zealot in question - Professor Elwell, played by Hume Cronyn. When Elwell digs long enough and discovers Praetorius's not-so-open-book past, he goes on a crusade which culminates into a hearing. The attitude is clear and typical at that time in history - ""if we don't understand something, then let's burn it at the stake!""

This story is loaded with witty and rapid-fire dialog, humor, and a few wonderful characters including best friend, Professor Barker, played by the incomparable Walter Slezak, and Shunderson portrayed by Finlay Currie.

Probably the most evident is the charm, dynamics, vigor, and energy Grant brings to this role. As a physician, husband, and conductor of the college orchestra, Grant's Praetorius brings a believable, honest vitality to the story.

And much like the ribbon on the package, the movie's underlying musical score is based on Brahms ""Academic Festival Overture"" (Akademische Festouvertre) which lingers long after the movie is over. It seems to be the final and perfect touch to an exquisite movie.",1187654400,3,2052,5.373831775700935

The film is brilliantly cast with supports like Stanley Blackmer/Hume Cronyn/Finlay Currie who are superbly directed by Manckiewz.  It is an excellent under statement against the McCarthy witch hunts of the early fifties era and in our times of 2006/7 it may give all of us time to reflect on what value there is in standing up for personal belief and individual rights.

Grant gives one of his best performamces, thoughtful , understated , positive and with great expression , compassion and humour. Crain although slightly typecast in the times of the era is given a chance by the director to show that she can act as well as appear beautiful.  Not to be missed",1184630400,,756,4.792307692307692

Grant's Praetorius is a progressive who believes the mind can be an instrument of healing, and the actor gratefully chews up his scenes, especially when he's required to lecture his peers.

Another of the doctors at the college is investigating him because of his shady background, unbeknownest to Cary. He meets a college student when she faints over a cadaver ( body ). She later makes an appointment to see him about her fainting spells and later finds out she is pregnant. He makes a follow-up appointment for her to see him again for further care, then she leaves his office. A few minutes later, a shot rings out, and he finds her lying in the hallway. After surgery for a surface wound, she admits that she has fallen in love with him. He then tells her that she isn't pregnant when he visits her in post-op care. She quietly slips out of the hospital in the middle of the night and goes to her fathers house. Cary goes after her and ends up marrying her, and later tells her that she is really pregnant. In the meantime, the other doctor is getting closer and closer to finding out about Cary, only he is coming to all the wrong conclusions, especially the one about Cary Grants friend- commiting murder. Towards the end of the movie, everything comes out, including the twist at the end. This is one that you will love forever, and watch over and over again.

581433,5,630310245X,"Simply one of a handful of films that impact society decades later, in the hands of a master storyteller, Joseph Mankiewicz. A cast of casts: Cary Grant, Jean Crain, Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn and Sidney Blackmer for starts. Dr. Praetorius (Grant) teaches at the local medical school,attended by his always-present mute (Finlay Currie). A rival doctor connives to get to the bottom of this shameless display. Before long this competent doctor intevenes with one of his students (Crain) in a very gallant,compassionate way before his past catches up to him. Grant's unconcern and Cronyn's connivery builds in suspense. Only at the symphonic finish do things tie together. What contemporary film has room for the doting proud single-dad of Jean Crain's, played by the refined, debonair Sidney Blackmer, a never-do-well professionally, who's only lasting pride is his daughter? Watch the scene around the family farm radio when Dr. Praetorius (Grant) is allowed to comment on those who must humbly watch from the sidelines of life because their talent was undervalued, while others can idle with plentiful farm subsidies. The film is caught in the 50's paranoia of communist conspiracies, the smear of innuendo and a Puritanical society, yet proceeds with great suspense to the end, where it is neatly resolved and justice is served. This should be a film talked about and studied for its character strengths (including eccentricities) moving storyline about the human conditiion, and inspiring belief in the decency of man. The economy and depth of expression all at once is astounding in this wonderful film.",1146700800,3,1607,5.256809338521401
581434,4,630310245X,"This is a remarkable movie. Adapted to the American screen from writer Curt Goetz' ""Frauenartz Dr. Praetorius"", the plot is simple and somewhat superficial. In the hands of director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, though, it turns into a gentle, thought provoking comedy of manners that showcases Cary Grant's genius at debonair humor, even though it might come in the middle of surrounding high drama.

The movie opening introduces us to the immediate plot line, with Hume Cronyn, playing a stuffy professor of medicine obviously envious of the good Dr. Praetorius, investigating Cary Grant's background prior to arriving at the university. The romantic interest is carried by Dr. Praetorius being smitten with student Jean Crain (who, at 25, was initially considered to be too old to play the co-ed role) and her out-of-wedlock predicament.

If one is asked what the movie is about, it is a queston that is difficult to answer. The plot is fluff, but the themes of medical ethics, humane treatment of patients, selflessness and witch hunt prosecution of the innocent are universal and apropos of modern life. At one point, Dr. Praetorius speaks about the unthinking distillation of medicine to the point of creating a ""mechanical doctor."" Needless to say, love conquers all and the righteous prevail. All this, set to the rousing strains of Brahms' ""Academic Festival Overture.""

The supporting cast is wonderful, from Walter Slezak as the loyal friend to Margaret Hamilton in a delightful scene, to Finlay Currie, as Mr. Shunderson, practically stealing every scene he is in. Sidney Blackmer, Will Wright and Basil Ruysdael also play pivotal roles.

Much has been written about Cary Grant, more than can be cited in this small review. This movie, released in 1942, was at the beginning of an incredible run of fine movies Grant made (his first credited film was released in 1932) from 1937's ""The Awful Truth"" to ""Walk, Don't Run"" in 1966. Writers have commented on his good looks, his sartorial elegance, his panache, all the way to his dimpled chin. But, in my opinion, if one wants to understand what a complete actor he was, watch his hands. They are never out of character; they  are always doing exactly what his character needs. They are as elegant, whether in drama or comedy, as Cary's character needs them to be.

As for the DVD version, there is nothing notable extra on the disk, but it is a good, clean copy. I saw only one awkward cut during a scene on the farm porch, otherwise it is intact.

I have discovered that when movies, books, and music get mixed reviews they are worth investigating. Often they strike close to home somehow and the reviewer may be striking back or prefers something less benign. One can't go wrong watching this movie. Every character is developed and, yes, one can learn a lesson or two (as with any movie, book, and even in music).",1126051200,10,477,4.558139534883721

581438,5,630310245X,"I watched this movie for the first time recently, and I loved it.  Perhaps it was due in some part to the fact that I didn't go into the movie expecting much--the summary didn't really appeal to me.  But Cary Grant is clearly loving his role in this movie.  he is more relaxed in this movie than I have ever seen him, and I happen to be a Grant-aholic:)

As for his supposed lack of chemistry with his female co-star, I didn't happen to see it.  He seemed sympathetic and loving to her, and she was clearly nuts for him.  One issue that may contribute to the supposed lack, though, is that they hardly ever are together without problems.  In the first part, she is pregnant and fearful of his perception of her, and in the second they are dealing with other problems that I will leave out so as to avoid spoiling anyone.  However, there is a clear sense of love between the two characters, and if they are not passionate together, it is only because they don't really have any passionate scenes.  The lack of passion is more than made up for with tenderness though, which shines through in their relationship.

P.S.--I happen to love the proposal scene, and I also loved seeing the ""Grant sidle"" ;)",1097280000,6,1198,4.429223744292237
581439,3,630310245X,"""People Will Talk"" used to be one of my favorite movies. Watching it again reveals that -- dramatically -- it's as sterile and antiseptic as Dr. Praetorius's operating room.
""Talk"" -- and I deliberately selected ""Talk"" rather than ""People"" as the shorthand -- was Joseph Mankiewicz's follow-up to ""All About Eve."" He'd no doubt had this project on the burner, and ""Eve""'s huge success gave him the clout to get it produced.
The story (from a German play) must have looked nice on paper -- an idealistic doctor keeps an out-of-wedlock pregnant woman from committing suicide, while successfully defending himself from unjust charges of medical impropriety -- but it doesn't play well on film. Not in Mankiewicz's adaptation, anyway.
Mankiewicz is more interested in being clever than humane, and in a story about what it means to be humane, he fails to make a sincere connection with the characters' inner lives. Even when the characters are forced to confront their situations, Mankiewicz's penchant for witty dialog overrides believable dramatic interaction. Issues are resolved in a ""verbal Band-Aid"" fashion, merely by the application of clever words.
""Talk"" seems more a reflection of Mankiewicz's personality than anything else. The characters are spokespeople for his views rather than fleshed-out human beings. When Shunderson says he's reached the point where music is just about the only thing he enjoys, you suspect you're hearing Mankiewicz himself. (At the age of 57 -- and, like Mankiewicz, a Brahms freak -- I know what he means.)
The principal performances are ineffective. Dr. Praetorius -- who has a history he doesn't want made public -- must have appealed to Cary Grant, who was similarly hounded by rumors about his private life. But his doctor is more charming than deep. There is rarely the sense of ""gravitas"" you would expect from a person so concerned about the welfare of others. He comes perilously close to expressing a light, almost patronizing attitude towards the problems of human existence. You do, however, get to see the unique ""Grant sidle"" in the barn scene.
Jeanne Crain's performance is terrible. She's not only miscast -- there's no chemistry whatever between her and Grant -- but the script requires her to be both intellectually strong _and_ vulnerable enough to attempt suicide, while possessing the mental agility and wit to win a verbal fight with Dr. Elwell (Hume Cronyn). Even Bette or Kate would have had trouble handling all that. Poor Jeanne isn't remotely up to it. *
But the supporting players are a delight. Hume Cronyn is at his peak, playing the weaselly Dr. Elwell as a flawed human being, rather than a caricatured villain. Then there's Walter Slezak as a self-absorbed physicist, and marvelous Margaret Hamilton as Dr. Praetorius's ex-housekeeper. She's typecast, but brings far more to the role than you'd expect.
""Talk"" is more than a half-century old, and shows it in many ways. The thought that an unmarried pregnant woman would even _consider_ suicide seems alien, even to someone (like myself) born before the film was made. The Code-enforced treatment of attempted suicide is delicate (we don't see Crain lying on the floor, only the people gathered around her), while Mankiewicz's reference to abortion -- without actually saying the word -- is a model of brilliant writing any would-be screenwriter should study.
So, with all this nay-saying, is ""Talk"" worth a look? Yes. Mankiewicz's dialog is always fun to hear. (His 1983 biography is titled ""Pictures will Talk."") And the story _does_ have much to say about professional integrity and respect for other people's private decisions. It also presents the older view that medicine is not about treating symptoms, but treating people -- ""Helping sick people get well,"" as Dr. Praetorius puts it. In an era when motion pictures are rarely ""about"" _anything_, it's a pleasure to watch a film that -- though it does so in a pompous, even self-righteous manner -- is not embarrassed to say something worth hearing.
The DVD (which I purchased 12/09/03) is sharp, finely detailed, with excellent contrast, but a lot of film grain (or is it coding artifacts?) visible in many scenes.
* The fault is at least partly Mankiewicz's. There is a lot to be said for Hitchcock's approach of letting the actors find their own way.",1082073600,21,4329,5.064425770308123
581440,1,630310245X,"Honestly?  P.U.
despite being a huge Cary Grant fan, I can't buy him in this role.  both the character (selfless gynecologist to the down-trodden, amateur orchestra conductor, sensitive soul, all 'round renaissance man) and grant's performance (all over the map) are far too precious to be taken seriously.  or even comically.  which may be the problem w/ the film: the odd mixture of satire, moralizing, and cautionary anti-mccarthy tale just doesn't hang together well.
I'd write this off as yet another retread of hollywood's ham-handed self-congratulatory liberalism.  if you're looking for vintage mank, stick w/ ""all about eve;"" for classic cary, ""north by northwest.""",1078272000,21,674,5.4423076923076925

Mean while back at the ranch Dr. Praetorious is getting romanticlay involved with a young student that has a problem that she can not reveal to her father.

Mr. Shunderson is a mysterious person from Noah's past. You may think that Shunderson ""the bat"" is scary.

This movie is a remake of ""Frauenarzt Dr. Prtorius"" (1950). Luckily it is much better than the original. Watching the train scene made me want to go ""beep beep"" or was that ""beep beep beep?"" This is one of those movies that just works. You can not pull it apart as each actor was excellent for his or her character.
