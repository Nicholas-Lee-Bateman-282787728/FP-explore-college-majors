8226410,5,B000X1ESI6,"Created in Belgium in 2005 this series is sometimes known as Russian Dolls - so careful you know what you are getting as there is a film of the same name floating about. The product at hand is a fictional adaptions of the sort of stories that have been coming out of Europe for some time now. That is, the trafficking of girls from the very poor parts of newly independant nations such as Moldova and Romania to be used in brothels and even less salubrious surrounds in wealthier nations to their West. Anyone who has seen the excellent Eastern Promises film will have already seen a fictional portrayal of this trade.

The ten episodes of Matrioshki follow the story of a bunch of Russian and Lithuanian women who answer a casting call to become dancers in the West. Given contracts to sign in Greek and basically rorted every step of the way the girls soon wind up in Cyprus where they find their employers really aren't very nice people at all. And things go from bad to worse once they arrive in Belgium where they enter a very unpleasant world indeed where pretty much what you imagine will happen to them does.

The production values are good, make sure you get a copy your player will be able to run and one with subtitles. For all the annoyance of tracking down a copy, this isn't a show you'll forget soon as not only the criminal gang running the show starts to unravel under the pressure, so does the us vs them mentality of the group of girls as each must make some sort of accommodation with their situation. And not all of them are mentally strong enough to do so nor are all of them ever destined to return to their families.

Probably not a show for young 'uns but you've already figured that out by now, there is some nudity of course and some of it's not easy to watch but if you want something based on reality, want something different and are prepared to immerse yourself in this story you will be rewarded.",1254528000,2,1928,4.410112359550562
8226411,5,B000X1ESI6,"Belgium: 10-Part Mini-Series AKA Groundbreaking Docudrama (though I don't know if the producers would be comfortable with the tag) that addresses human trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The series commences with the pretext of girls attending an open audition in the former Soviet Union for ""dancing jobs"" in Western Europe.  The girls that are selected are then given a contract to sign, which is written in Greek.  In actuality, the girls are to be moved along a specific route with the ultimate destination to be a ""club"" in Belgium.  Personally, I like a series that is thought provoking while alternatively being both fascinating and repulsive.  Throw in factually accurate (at least based on what I have read) and Matroesjka's (AKA Russian Dolls [not to be confused with the French film]) hits on all cylinders!  I won't give away any spoilers, other than to see that my friends and I started watching the series at 10PM and the next thing we knew it was 6AM!  Note that there are several versions available (primarily with or without out sub titles).  Unless your French, Dutch and Flemish are up to speed, make certain that the version with sub titles is purchased.  Interestingly, the common language spoken (where this is a common language) is English.  Series 2 (3-years later) is arguably better than the first!",1253577600,,1327,4.990909090909091
