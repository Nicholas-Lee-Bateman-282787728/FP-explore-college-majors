8659833,4,B00KLPGXUA,"The James Bond films were and still are a huge franchise. One of the THE film franchises to span decades and generations. But who really knew anything about the character's author Ian Fleming? Not me. So I was enthralled with this depiction of him.

Here's the scoop. Ian Fleming was ne'er-do-well, trust fund kid from a wealthy family who worked as a stock broker in pre WWII London. He wasn't good at it as he spent more time partying and chasing women. But his innate smarts, and knack for getting around things brought him to the attention of British intelligence community. They figured he could bring them up to speed and help defeat the ever increasing Nazi threat. They were correct.

This is a real eye opener. I don't know how much the script had to be tweeked to bring the reality of his story to fruition but, if half of it is true, he was one heck of a guy. He spoke his mind, even in the face of superiors. He seemed to find the one thing he was genuinely good at and grew to love the work, even if it put his life in danger. He re-organized the intelligence department and brought new methods of gathering intelligence to the forefront. Some of the schemes he thought up were used and actually worked.

Dominic Cooper is outstanding in the lead role. He chews on it with true gusto. I cannot say I detected a false moment in his characterization of Fleming. And it was a real hoot seeing the people he worked with who would later become ongoing characters in his novels. All those around him do fine jobs as well. It's always a shock to me to see people being so bluntly honest in the way they address one another. There is a boat load of that here. Particularly from Fleming's stiff upper lip mother. She's of the wealthy upper crust and treats others with the disdain she feels the deserve. Would not want to be in the same room as her.

The period depiction is great as well. The viewer gets a good taste of the time and circumstance. The music, costumes, sets and so forth are all top shelf.

As much as I liked it I could have used more detail on his work within the intelligence community. They touch on the ""Man Who Never Was"" ruse, and his creation of AU30. But, even in the thick of things much of the time is spent on his personal dealings with the people (particularly the women) around him. There were also quite a few oddly framed closeups that I found distracting. That being said, this is still a great depiction of a man who has affected and thrilled the lives of movie going audiences for a long long time.",1420761600,3,2538,4.36864406779661
8659834,5,B00KLPGXUA,"Thisis so delightful, so interesting, and the characters are well done! The back drop of WWII is carried out so wonderfully that it makes watching this a real treat. It is not fluff but smart TV!!!",1416268800,2,197,4.5
8659835,5,B00KLPGXUA,"Excellent series!  Loved this series so much and have been hoping for a US release, none so far so I purchased this one and it was sent from Thailand.  It plays on my laptop but does NOT play on my Blu-ray player,  I am in the US.  It is in PAL format.  When you first get it the audio is set to Thailand but you can switch over to English, no worries.",1405900800,2,352,3.8333333333333335
8659836,5,B00KLPGXUA,"This Mini-series gives a whole new propective to Ian Fleming's life. Ian was truely a man of mystery and to this day the franchise that he created with his books still goes on thanks to Cubby's daughter. What is truely a mystery is why the BBC never released this in the United States (but it played on BBC America). I have hunted for this ever since its release, and have been hounding the BBC about it with little or no response. It took a dealer from the UK who is selling it out of Thiland for me to finally get it. It is in English and has English Subtitles and is set up for ALL REGIONS under the PAL system. There is a small drawback to that for us that use the PS3 to play our movies as it is not set up to use PAL, however since I run both the PS3 & the new PS4 systems that was not a problem as the PS4 is set up to run the PAL system and it worked just fine on that. I have no idea how well it plays on standard Blue ray system, but suspect the new systems will also play it. This is well worth the money and for an import at $26.00 US quite reasonable. I highly recommend it for those who are true Bond fans.",1404691200,8,1120,3.8951965065502185
