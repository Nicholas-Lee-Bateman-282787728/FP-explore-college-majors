2042190,5,B0001XAMIQ,"Ash, May, Brock and Max are off to another feature length adventure in Jirachi Wish Maker, where they encounter a Pokemon that only comes out every 1,000 years. Max who is the youngest of our hero's is the one who gets Jirachi and the events sprial out of wack from there.
With a magicians assistant helping them, they travel in the magicians bus that his assistant has taken from him in order to take Jirachi home. From the rough cross country drive to pushing the stuck bus out of the mud our hero's do their best to get Jirachi home.
With well drawn animation mixed with CGI it will keep the young and old alike glued. Fantastic flight scenes utilizing new Pokemon are a wonder to look at.
Team Rocket of course puts in their obligatory appearance with the usual and hilarious results.
Special feature includes the Pokemon Let's Dance short and a very moving rendition of ""Make a Wish"" sung both in English and Japanese at the same time. Interview with the director is also on DVD. A music video of ""Make a Wish"" is on DVD in Wide Screen Format.",1086220800,,1048,4.463541666666667
2042191,1,B0001XAMIQ,"Despite being a great fan of the Pokemon series, I feel that this has been by far the worst Pokemon movie. I really liked Pokemon Heroes and 4-Ever, so I still think Pokemon is a fresh and lively series. But this movie is simply not done well. The pacing is very slow, the BGM is uninspired, and the directing seems different from the earlier films. One thing you will notice right away is that the traditional introductory music sequence is missing for the first time. The dub has been done by the same excellent cast, however one can tell at times this was not a theatrical release in America. A few of the dubbed lines are noticeably raw and unrefined, suggesting not much time was spent to write this movie for American audiences.
Don't be misled by clips and screenshots of this movie, which do look very nice. Some young viewers may enjoy this movie regardless because Jirachi is in it, but in reality this movie lacks the action and atmosphere of previous Pokemon films. This is the first movie to feature the new characters of Pokemon Advanced, but lacks the character depth and interaction of the related TV series.",1086220800,3,1124,4.625
2042192,5,B0001XAMIQ,"The sixth installment in the Pokmon films, ""Jirachi Wishmaker"", marks something of an interesting point in the whole series of translated versions. Namely, the point at which it seems that they FINALLY got an adaptation of one of these things dead-on perfect! Of course, at this point the films go direct to video and we'll never get to see this on the big screen...which is a shame, because the animation quality here is superb. Shogakukan's team has the integration between the digital and cel parts (which were not as 'seamless' in earlier films) just about perfect, and this makes it a real shame that we won't get to see this movie the way it came out in Japan.
The plot, both in the original direction and in the adaptation, has been handled excellently. In fact, this has the feel of how the films should go, if one's ever had the pleasure of seeing past Pokmon movies in a subtitled, literal translation version. It doesn't erase the catastro-mix of that very first one, ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"" (which has plagued all of these films critically ever since, and which still, I think, needs to be 'restored'), but it comes very close. Note, also...this is really, really dark stuff, such as how ""Pokmon Heroes"" was as well; this isn't the lighter-weight fare such as in the TV series. The story touches on the darker side of personal ambition, and contains some really ugly and hard-taught, yet valuable lessons about how this can ultimately destroy all one has.
But if you want funny, the short (which all of these films have) is actually worth watching a few times. It's something of an object-lesson in why Team Rocket should never leave Meowth in charge. Of anything. Period. And it's hysterical.
A few faults, nothing enough to warrant removing a star. One big one, though, is that we STILL don't get a widescreen version. C'mon, 4Kids...the CREDITS and the SHORT are at least in 16:9, why not the whole shebang!? Enough kids have seen 'proper' anime at this point so that they won't panic about the letterboxing on regular screens, and for those of us who dropped a wad of cash on the big ones, it would be NICE to see this in the proper aspect ratio, without cropping, especially since some of us can't afford to burn up major plastic on a ticket to Japan every time one of these comes out from now on.
But that's nitpicking compared to what we get here. This, folks, is as close as it gets to 'direct' from what I can tell, and while I'm sure there's been some editing to adapt this for the West, this time whatever's been done doesn't detract at all from the story, film, or even the soundtrack with the bilingual theme song at the end. That's right, a song with Japanese lyrics in a 4Kids-translated Pokmon film...what's the world coming to!?
Just buy it, OK? Even if you thought the first film was a mess (which it was, unless you have a copy of the final Japanese edit) and it made you swear off of these things, this one may convince you otherwise. It's quality.",1086220800,3,2978,4.589118198874297
2042193,5,B0001XAMIQ,"The sixth installment of the Pokemon film franchise, introduces the ""new"" characters from the Hoenn region from the Television Series, and of course the main character Ash and the supporting ""Pokemon"" cast.
This film's adeptation is done by Eric Stuart this time around, and noticable improvements are apparent right out of the gate:
1. This is literally a straight translation from the Japanese film of a similar name, including the opening ""Pokemon music"" used in the Japanese productions.  No cheesy ""boy-band"" material in this one folks!
2. Animation, in my assessment is a step down from the previous films, the music and the special features more than make up for this shortcoming which, in my inital assessment was minor.
3. Story, This is a story about friendship, and a young boy's (Max) bonding with this very jovial and playful Jirachi.  I particualary enjoyed how emphasis is focusing LESS on the primary character, Ash, and emphasis now has been placed on the secondary Characters, as we find out, that Max feels quite alone in the world, and finds happiness for these seven days through friendship and immediate bonding with Jirachi.  The writers, unsuccessfully integrate Jessie and James into the story, who are, as always, up their their usuall antics of attempting to procure Pikachu for the benefit of themselves and Team Rocket.  I did not see any relevence to their presence in the story at all, other then for the fact that they are primary (and often times) un-necessary characters in the series.  The plot is multi-layered, dealing with two very developed integrated subplots (Max and Jirach and Butler and Diane)that come full circle very nicely in the films short 81 minute duration.
4. Music - Miazaki once again pushes the envelope with these film, always striving for improvement, and hits the mark dead on with this production.  Music flows very nicely, and fits with all scenes in the film.  The films ending theme, ""Make A Wish"", in my assessment put the music in this film over the top.  A very powerful and riveting piece of music that marks the end to a piece of work, well deserving of praise and not merely ""entertainment for children"", as most of these films, tend to be seen in the eyes of the mass media.
5. Special Features:  a. ""Gotta Dance"" short - I enjoy the shorts, these potray the Pokemon in their more playful and relaxed natures, with some very unique twists.
b. Trivia Game: An entertaining way to test your Pokemon knowlege.
c. Director Yayama's commentary: 45 seconds of this esteemed directors time, doesn't do these films adequate justice.  He does, however, provide insight for the future of the film franchise.
d. ""Make a Wish"" music video: Worth the price of the DVD alone, in my assesment.  Done in a similar fashion to John Williams commentary on the past Star Wars DVD's, we see how much more thought, is put into Pokemon in Japan, than here in the United States, where Pokemon is thought to be just a ""strictly for children"" film.  A very nice and enjoyable addition to the disc.
e. Pokemon Characters: The Pokemon stars of the film.
f. Original Artwork: These segments are always a pleasure to view, because it gives the viewer a better understanding of the complexities involved in modern day animation.
Overall: This is a well-done production dealing with a young boy's quest for friendship and acceptance and a bitter scientist desire for retribution, and the consequences of such actions.  Eric Stuart did a phenomenal job with the adeptation on this film.  Couple that with Miazaki's beautifully scored music and enjoyable special features, I can easily overlook some of this film's shortcomings in the animation department.  Almost perfect!",1086220800,2,3709,4.940514469453376
2042194,5,B0001XAMIQ,"This 6th movie's gotta be the best of them all! I mean, Jirachi doesn't appear as often as most people would like...
  Anyway! This movie is in the Pokemon Advanced series, as in May takes Misty's place (I hate that!). Max is Jirachi new best friend! ^__^ It's so cute the way he fell asleep with Jirachi's big, crystal rock in his arms! And there's a small part that gives a small hint of Ash liking Misty!
  The mini movie is in the extras (Like always), and it's called ""Gotta Dance."" It's basically how Meowth gets this cool stick that can make Pokemon dance, but it's really cute! ^___^
  I highly recommend this to ANYone who's a huge fan of Pokemon, or has been into it for a very long time! And here's another thing... I think I was one of the first ones to get this DVD a week before it came out because a certain movie, DVD and CD store forgot not to put it on the shelves yet!

2042195,4,B0001XAMIQ,"Pokemon fans everywhere, it's that time again!  Another new Pokemon movie hits the market, and it's an Advance Adventure!  Jirachi Wish Maker is number 6, and is set in the land of Hoenn where Ash, Brock, May and Max find themselves at a travelling fair!  There they meet a magician called Butler, who has secret plans, involving a Pokemon who only wakes up once every 1000 years ...  And, you guessed it, the alarm clock is about to go off!
This DVD comes with extras, including ""Gotta Dance!"", involving Meowth and a magical wand that makes Pokemon dance to ""Polka O Dolka"" (Japanese name).  Can Pikachu and friends save the captured Whismur, and themselves at the same time?
Also, the DVD contains a music video of ""Make a Wish"", the ending song, which is sung by Asuca Hayashi.  She sang ""Chiisaki Mono"", which is the ending song for the Japanese version of ""Jirachi Wish Maker"".  I personally love the song, but we'll wait and see with ""Make A Wish"".
Having seen the Japanese movie, I can personally say I LOVE this movie!  It's darker than some of them, but can be slightly corny at times (I don't like May, and therefore don't like the fact she is ""pure"" enough to awaken Jirachi!  Sorry!).  So, I give it 4.5/5!",1084924800,5,1219,4.5504587155963305

Believe it or not, later into the movie, it resembles Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" quite closely!

2042218,5,B0001XAMIQ,"Lotad is going along a high branch in a tree, followed by Mudkip who's watching after it. But Lotad falls off, getting it's lilypad caught between a forked branch. It panics while Mudkip calls in Pikachu and Torchic to help. All three try to reach for Lotad, but in comes Treecko who slides down and bumps them all off straight down to Lotad. When they all land the branch acts like a giant trampoline, sending them all flying. They land smack dab into a rock, which breaks on the other side, and then the whole thing just topples down. After recovering from that whole bit, the troop walks on, and they see a weird building up against a cliff. The building was made of a bunch of really huge dice, all going from one to six. But they notice a familiar ""R"", maybe this is some Team Rocket place?

Just inside the building, Jesse, James and Meowth are planning out what looks like a party. Jesse and James are going out for a while, and they want Meowth to ready the ""big surprise"" for Giovanni. Meowth says he can handle the place easily, and everything will go perfectly. When Jesse and James go off, Meowth turns to a stage that's set up. In there is Cacnea, Seviper, Wobbuffet, and a trio of scared Whismur. Meowth starts to boss around the Whismur, telling them to get ready. The three whip out maracas and Meowth takes out a wand. He presses a button, a ball at the end opens up, and it starts up the Polka O Dolka music and dance to it.

Intro

Half the song is Meowth and the crew dancing to the song, the other half is showing Pokemon dancing from the settings of the previous Pikachu Shorts (with all the Pokemon who started in it).

After the song's done, Meowth says that that'll make Giovanni impressed enough. He thinks that it'll shove out that Persian from being #1 and Meowth will be back in business. So until then, Meowth locks up the Whismur in a cage at the basement. Just then Pikachu and co. found a way to the building, but just at a small window where the basement is. Lotad nudges a pebble that falls on a sleeping Loudred, just adjusting his position in reaction to the pebble. After Meowth and others leave, Pikachu spots the Whismur and decides to rescue them. Pikachu, Treecko, Torchic, and Mudkip all try to squeeze in the window at once, but suddenly Lotad makes a big sneeze shoving them all in. Everyone's a little miserable except Lotad, of course.

Pikachu finds the Whismur trio and talks with them, figuring out Meowth's little plan. But of course, the cage is locked. Then Pikachu has an idea. First Pikachu starts to zap the door, then Mudkip hoses it down (while Pikachu is still going), then Torchic sends a few Embers. Then the part of the cage blows up making a big hole. The commotion alerts Meowth and the others hurry to find someplace to hide. They hide inside barrels stacked along the wall. Meowth bursts in and sees that the Whismur escaped. He tells the others to hurry up and go search for them, but they all run Meowth over, making him fumble the wand he was using. It lands on Treecko... but it presses the switch to activate the song! Everyone starts to get into the song and they all start dancing. All of them except Treecko is enjoying themselves a little too much to see they're there. Treecko on the other hand has the wand in hand and is trying his hardest not to dance. And in the middle of it, the Loudred from before busts through the wall and starts dancing.

Finally Treecko tips over hitting the switch again on the wand causing all the music to stop. Meowth notices Pikachu and co. and they notice Meowth. Meowth tells Cacnea and Seviper to go after them, but Pikachu and co. escape in the nick of time. Meowth follows afterwards. The Loudred on the other hand just stares blankley.

Meowth comes across the patio, a large suspended wooden floor with a windmill on one edge. Meowth spots Pikachu on the top of the windmill and they try to scramble down, but Lotad falls! Treecko gets a catch at it with the wand, but presses the switch at the same time. Soon everyone but Treecko starts to dance to the music again. Loudred breaks through once more to join in the party, but this time a Ludicolo comes in. But the weight of everyone dancing starts to break the patio! Suddenly Wobbuffet swipes the wand from Treecko and Treecko gives into the music. But this time the tune changes into a waltz version and everyone partners up and waltzs towards the building. All the while the patio is falling right behind them. They all make it safely to the building's edge, and by then Wobbuffet tosses the wand, making it land on Meowth. Everything goes back to normal and the first thing they see is the deep gorge below. They all inch their way up against the wall before they notice each other again. Pikachu's group and Meowth's group all chase each other back inside leaving the Loudred and Ludicolo there.

Pikachu and co find their way to the party room, but Meowth is worried most about this room. While everyone attempting to ruin a cart dish here and there, Meowth is trying to rescue the place. But while Seviper chase Lotad and Mudkip, Torchic swings by on a ribbon. Then Cacnea drops on Seviper. Then came along Wobbuffet chasing Mudkip, and Meowth chasing Pikachu all on top of them. Cacnea gets ticked off and gets up, going trigger happy with his Pin Missile attack. Cacnea shoots up the decorations, the food, the glass, just about everything in the room!

Meowth and co now have practically nothing lose so they chase Pikachu's group to an unfinished part of the place. Everyone's chasing each other on different sections and before you know it, Meowth has the wand thwacked out of his hand, and it lands on a pile of sand at the bottom, but it breaks a little. It turns on, the music starts playing. Everyone starts to dance. Torchic and Lotad dance on a carefully balanced pipes hanging from a rope. Meowth drops into cement, going in and out of the mixer (the song is messed up, so this scene is ""repeating itself"") then a few tiles drop on Meowth. Loudred and Ludicolo join in the fun at an unfinished tower. Treecko on the other hand is still trying his best not to dance, but his foot is already getting the beat. Just like that Treecko gives in and joins in other others with the dancing.

The wand breaks even more, switching off to waltz, then normal, then it starts to speed up and up before it explodes. Everyone stops, but a few tiles drop on Loudred's head which really ticks him off. Loudred soon grabs a beam and then starts rampaging across the construction area. Both Meowth and Pikachu's group flee from the scene only to be cornered inside of a tower. Treecko tries to step up against the Loudred but Loudred whacks a support beam, causing the whole thing to collaspe! Pikachu and co starts to make a run for it, leaving Meowth's group behind. But the sudden collaspe forced Pikachu and co. along with Loudred and Ludicolo out on two boards. Pikachu's group flies high and then drops down, but they're going to land right into a small cliff! Everyone tries to back away, but then Lotad steps up and sprays a high power Water Gun to stop the board. The board simply drops, Pikachu's group is out alright!

As for Meowth, all that's left is the basement. It looks like Jesse and James aren't going to be very happy when they come back Meowth complains. Then the basement walls just drop.

At the end of the day Pikachu and co. say their goodbyes to the Whismur trio (who still have their maracas out.)",1344988800,,7493,4.481318681318681
2042229,3,B0001XAMIQ,"Pokemon Jirachi Wishmaker has it's ups and downs. It was good as far as Absol being in it, and plus the fact with the ending song is beautiful. But some things that I think disapointed a lot of pokemon fans was that there wasn't a real Groudon in the film like it says. It was merely a monster created from Jirachi's power in the shape of a Groudon.

It is fair enough to like for me since I'm a huge pokemon fan, but it isn't in my top favs. Although the short is cute, it is the only part in the entire DVD where you see Brock's Mudkip and Ash's Treeko. You only see May's Torchic in the main movie. Plus many people expected a big epic battle between Groudon and Kyogre, so that was a disapointment. Plus the film lacked on explaining things. There were a few loose ends.

On a scene when Ash and gang where trying to figure out why Absol was trying to protect Jirachi, it was first thought up they were friends, but Brock said it was unlikely since Jirachi was asleep for a thousand years and the topic was instantly abandoned. So it was left unknown. Jirachi is a cute pokemon, although really doesn't grant wishes. He just teleports things that people ask for. Another loose end was ""What was May's wish?"" . May had bought a Wishing Star and on the seventh night, her wish was to come true. But she didn't use it on the last night, so we never knew what it was.

Pokemon Jirachi Wish Maker laid out a lot of disapointments and lack of answers. The only reason I give it three stars in because it is cute enough for any true pokemon fan, plus it has a beautiful song on the ending credits and a cute short.",1317254400,,1611,4.207119741100324

2.) The Pikachu short ""Gotta Dance"", originally included with this movie is now absent.

2042235,3,B0001XAMIQ,"Pokemon: Jirachi Wish Maker centers around the Millennium Comet.  This comet appears in the night sky for seven nights once every 1,000 years (hence, its name).  The legendary Pokemon named Jirachi also awakens from its slumber when the comet comes in order to absorb the comet's energy.  A magician named Butler, along with his partner Diane, find the stone that encases Jirachi.  Ash and his friends become involved when Max is able to hear Jirachi from the stone during a performance put on by Butler and Diane.

Pokemon: Jirachi Wish Maker clocks in at 81 minutes, which is just the right length for the story being told in the film.  Like the other Pokemon films, some attempts were made to combine computer graphics with the 2D animation.  Unfortunately, the computer animated portions are still standing out too much from the 2D animation and calling attention to itself.

On this disc, the short ""Gotta Dance,"" which was shown before the film in Japanese theaters, is included as one of the special features.  In this short, Team Rocket has built a new base.  They have captured three Whismur to help provide entertainment when Giovanni (the leader of Team Rocket) arrives to see the base.  Meowth creates a special baton to make the Whismur cooperate.  Pikachu, as well as some of the Pokemon owned by Ash and his friends, find themselves at the base.  Much of the humor in the short is derived from the running gag of the baton being inadvertently turned on or off.

The next special feature is a trivia game.  This is exactly like the trivia games that appeared on Pokemon 4Ever and Pokemon Heroes.  The disc randomly chooses a set of seven questions, and the viewer uses the remote to answer them.

Next is ""Message from the Director, Mr. Yuyama.""  This 45-second feature is in Japanese with English subtitles.  The director thanks the audience for watching the movie, and he says he is location scouting for the next movie.

The ""Make a Wish"" music video is for the song that is used in the ending credits of the film.  The video, which runs for about six minutes, combines footage of the singer with footage from the film; most of the film footage used features Jirachi.  At the beginning, the video is labeled as ""Pokemon Edit""; I assume that means that this version of the video included footage from Pokemon: Jirachi Wish Maker.

The ""Pokemon Character Scrapbook"" is a series of still images that not only include pictures of most of the Pokemon shown in the film or the short, but also include the name, the height, weight, species, and abilities for each one.  The Pokemon included in this feature are: Absol, Flygon, Dusclops, Kirlia, Pikachu, Whismur, Torchic, Mudkip, Lotad, Ludicolo, Loudred, Seviper, Wobbuffet, Treecko, and Cacnea.  However, it should be noted that Meowth was not included in this feature.

The final extra on the disc is ""Jirachi Wish Maker Original Artwork,"" which is a series of still images.  The images included in this feature are stills from the movie, production art, and even a storyboard.

Pokemon: Jirachi Wish Maker is a good film.  The DVD extras are also a little better than what appeared on some of the earlier DVD releases of the Pokemon films.  If you're a fan of Pokemon, you should have this film in your DVD collection.",1258416000,2,3282,4.788256227758007

2042237,5,B0001XAMIQ,"The sixth movie in the Pokemon series is as good as the ones before it; max, little brother of May, is given a mysterious geode by ""The Great Butler"", a magician traveling with the Millennium Comet Carnival. Butler explains that the rock contains Jirachi, a Pokemon that only appears every thousand years when the Millennium Comet passes overhead. Ash, Brock, and May watch Max bond with Jirachi, becoming fast friends in the week before the comet passes overhead. Trouble ensues as Butler kidnaps Jirachi, plotting to use the innocent creature to fulfill his twisted dreams of revenge.
The story is filled with moments that teach good, solid values to kids; the results of Max's first (greedy) wish, what negative emotions like revenge can do to normally nice people, and (as always) the values of Teamwork and Friendship. There's exciting action, great Pokemon battle scenes, the usual splendid artwork and more than a few laughs in what this reviewer feels is a great family movie, one you'll want to watch with your smaller Pokemon fan(s)!",1226534400,2,1043,5.0
2042238,1,B0001XAMIQ,"This is part 7/10.  ""Jirachi Wish Maker"" was, in my opinion, the worst Pokemon movie.  Jirachi was so cute I wanted to get sick.  I think the plot line was too little for a movie.  The majority of the movie seemed to be made up of cutesy circus tricks and a fake Groudon waltzing about.  Not one I'd recommend for someone over the age of 2.",1200960000,,340,4.090909090909091

2042240,3,B0001XAMIQ,"This movie was okay.  It lack some of the action and intensity of the previous.  Another major draw back is like in Pokemon heroes the main members of team rocket.  Jesse, James and mewoth the main characters are barely evolved in this movie.  Personal  I think it was  a waste of time cast them for the last 2 sinc they where barely alive.  Like in all the other movie the main pokemon is physic caple of talking. How they  make shoot all these move show easy with the scenes with the physic and high special effects like the scene when as flies in Poke 4 ever  I never understand why such hard work is so under appreciated.

We have some new characters Mist and max to young kids from the Howin reason. Misty is abstience in this film.  Which annoyed me because may its more ditsy. Max is funny one the show he got  Misty personalty.

This movie introduces some new pokemon.  Jirachi who has the power to grant wish.

My favorite part was at the end when Butler creates the giant monster resemblinga  Grondon.  I have been a big fan of Godzilla  and enjoyed this monment.  The violence is mild copared to that of The first three.

Another weird signifancance is Jirchia and Pokemon heroes our Pokemon forever I can't remember which ones have the same introduction.

This film should be fine if your 7 our older.  I  recomend that  unlesh your chidren are adolesence our older you don't let them watch the very first Pokemon movie.

Which I think should have been PG rated not G.  Infact to be honest I think they over did they violence in the first four movies.

 Jirachi and Heroes should be fine for 7 and older you should wait till your 11 or older before letting then watch the others.",1110240000,2,1691,4.402597402597403

2042242,5,B0001XAMIQ,"Out of the 6 Pokemon films that have been released to the U.S so far, this one takes the cake. There wasn't an opening ""theme song and battle some random trainer"" segment, which I thought was a nice improvement, so the movie could get right into the story. The focus on the bond of friendship shared between Max (Masato) and Jirachi was a welcome change from having Ash (Satoshi) save the world over and over again. Also, the slight undertones of romance between Diane and Butler, and also the darker themes of losing a friend made this movie ""not just kids stuff."" Superb animation, original music (even the song May (Haruka) sang was the original Japanese track!), almost dead on translation (only a few dumb jokes sprinkled here and there) and even a combination of an English/Japanese ending theme! Now THIS, my fellow Pokemon loving fans, is how a movie should be done! Maybe for the seventh movie (entitled ""Destiny Deoxys"" being released in February here in the U.S), 4Kids will actually not tamper with the footage (Unedited?! My GOD, could it be so?! *dies*) and include a Japanese audio track along with the standard dub track. I'd KILL for that. This was a definite hit for me, even though I'm considered ""too old"" (high school) to like Pokemon anymore. It's a wonderfully heartwarming movie; it made me cry a little bit at the end even. Go out and buy it and you'll see what I mean!",1106265600,4,1394,4.647773279352227

2042245,5,B0001XAMIQ,"This 6th movie of the Pokemon Series really changes the flow of the Pokemon story. Not only do we see a secondary character come out to be the main focus of the movie, but it also shows the true power of friendship. While it still holds the other characters in the context around the ""main"" character Max, Ash, Brock, and May still had big roles in the movie. Ash being the guidance counceler for Max after he realizes he will only have Jirachi for 2 more days, Brock, still being up to his usual things (girls), and May being the big sister was kind of a countdown until Jirachi left to hibernate becuase of a charm she bought, but she was also like the mother figure for Max because of the journey that they were on. I think that when Ash was talking to Max about how Jirachi was always going to be with him forever, he shoould of mentioned at least 1 adventure he has in the previous 5 movies. The Pokemon short was a very funny short that features Treecko finally losing his composure and cutting it loose. The music on the movie is extraordinary in the fact that the director and main singers were giving 150%+. I would rate this 6 stars! A great buy for Child and Adult Pokemon Trainer alike!",1087171200,,1198,4.328888888888889
2042246,4,B0001XAMIQ,"Pokemon: Jirachi Wish Maker may have gone direct to video, but that doesn't mean it's not as good as previous installments. In fact, in some ways this entry could very well be the best Pokemon movie so far, especially in the way the franchise seems to have grown up with it's original fans.
The basic premise of the movie is that Ash and company attend a festival for the Millenium Comet, which only comes to earth once every thousand years. They meet a magician named Butler and his assistant Diane, who have found Jirachi deep in an isolated forest and convince Max to befriend it. However, Butler has dark motives and it's not long before he is found out and it's up to Max, Ash and the others to save Jirachi.
The story is actually quite good, considering this is a direct release. This time, Ash takes a back seat to May and Max, and we get to see their characters really develop. The themes of the movie, such as the relationship between brother and sister, and having to say goodbye to friends, are subtle at first, but by the end of the movie you realize they've been around all the time. We even get some foreshadowing for Season Seven of the tv series... the only thing that disappointed me was the lack of a theme song during the opening credits, but the Pokemon Advanced theme really wouldn't have fit the action on screen, so it was probably the right decision to exclude it.
One thing I would like to add... this is a film for the older Pokemon fans. Parents would be advised that the movie might be a bit intense for their littlest Poke-fans, especially the creature Butler creates near the end. I'm a college grad, and it creeped even ME out! The accompaning Pikachu short, however, is perfect for all ages.
If I liked the film so much, why only four stars? Well, Miramax and 4Kids have done better with this release than the previous two. There are no color tint errors this time around (ie, Pikachu doesn't appear green in some scenes) and the production values are quite high. But some of their decisions are still baffling. The movie end credits, the Pikachu short, the music video, even the DVD menus are all presented in widescreen, but the main feature is not. It just doesn't make sense why they could not present the main feature in widescreen as well. The ending song includes Japanese lyrics, the music video is completely Japanese, the director's message is Japanese, yet there is no Japanese language option for the main feature. It's just very frustrating and odd. Perhaps they're planning on releasing special widescreen versions of the films down the road...
At any rate, despite the shortcomings, Pokemon fans will really dig this entry. It definately competes with Pokemon 3 and Pokemon Heroes as the best entry in the series.",1086566400,17,2760,4.634693877551021
2042247,5,B0001XAMIQ,"This movie was so awesome!  I'll admit, it did start off rather slow,  but this movie is so different from all the others before it!!  The animation was beautiful and fluent, and so was the music!  Thank you Miramax for keeping the original Japanese music in this film too, although I wished that there was a Japanese audio too.  Maybe later I hope.  Some of the scenery in the movie was so breath-taking!!  The story was very exciting as it got going, especially at the end with the fake Groudon.  I loved the scene where Ash and Max are flying around on the Flygon and Butler is on Salamence.  The ending song ""Chiisaka Mono"" in Japanese, or ""Make a Wish"" in Enlish, is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  The Japanese singer puts so much emotion into her singing, its gorgeous and makes the music video one of the biggest reasons to buy this movie!  I also like the fact that there was some romance going on with the two new characters, Butler and Diane.  However the voice acting left a lot to be desired.  Some of it sounded like a tv dub, Diane's voice was great,  but Butler...well it was ok.  But it sort of took away from the film.  I was about ready to pound that Flygon, very annoying.  And the movie actually focuses on a character other than Ash!!  *gasp*  Thank God!  Max & Jirachi were the main focus, with Butler and Diane being secondary focuses.  Which made the movie very interesting and a lot more enjoyable than the old ""Ash saves the world from certain doom"" theme.  Not very much air time for Jessie, James and Meowth though,  which was a dissapointment.  The Pokemon short on this dvd, ""Gotta Dance"" is hilarious!!  The original song for this short was ""Polka wa Dolka"" and I prefer the Japanese singing to the English-its better on the ears.  >_<  Very cute song though, makes me wanna dance too.  ^_^  All in all, this is a movie that should definetally be on your favorite's list!!

2042249,5,B0001XAMIQ,"Pokemon is only for kids? Not really, if you don't believe this, watch Jirachi Wish Maker, it'll probably alter you view point on this series...
Anime romance? Yup, Pokemon 6th movie has it, Bulter and Diane's bond of love is more than enough to portray this aspect, although we won't see kissing and more mature contents in this movie, the idea of love is presented clear enough that even younger children will understand
Anime action? Plenty. The movie takes time over a 7-day period, as each day passes, the story gets more and more intense until a full explosion of action packed adventure on the 7th night. Flying, falling, fire breaths, beams, tentacles, evil energies are joining together to create the best graphical effect you won't find in the previous Pokemon movies
Themes? Unforgettable. As usual, friendship is emphasized in Pokemon films, but there's more: the film also shows how a person could change after a negative impact that destroys his/her confidence in life; how going against nature could create disasters and unwanted problems for not only humans, but other species living in the same world as humans do...
Graphics and sounds are similar to Pokemon Heroes, with improved cel-shading overall. One downside of this movie is that Characters' voices seem too loud, they don't blend in with the background music that well; but this shouldn't affect the atmosphere the movie creates.
A worth mentioning point in this movie is that the theme song Making a Wish is very catchy, and it alternates between English and Japanese, 4Kids finally begins to realize that keeping something original is more welcomed by anime fans than writing and composing new musics on their own. In addition, there's no intro theme for this movie, the story gets into its position right away, no more time wasted on some Pokemon battles with theme song playing in the background...
In general, Pokemon Jirachi Wish Maker is more than just a kid's show, older generations can watch it together with younger ones and understand the themes at a different level. The movie is worth the money and time!",1086480000,3,2094,4.968660968660969

This movie catches your attention by having a carnival festival first, then the main conflict that goes on. This conflict was really good and well thought, and in the movie, I really loved the lullaby.
The lullaby was by the orignal track from the jap version, and you'll see it if you ever purchase it. There's a music video from this japanese singer who sang it from the lullaby.
Then Gotta Dance, the Pikachu Short MOvie is funny. It's kind of like that dancing frog from WB. Once they hear music, they start dancing. Meowth narrarates the story about what happened.
