Trying his level best to let go of the past and move on, he takes help of a therapist whose daughter Manu (Rituparna) he marries at a later stage. During a visit to Sikkim, Rishi stumbles upon a female monk who reminds him of his first wife Savitri (Antara). There is an uncanny resemblance between the two. It not only baffles him but also sends his life spiralling out of control. After sharing his experience with Manu and telling her about the similarity, he decides to investigate the situation. What follows is an unpredictable journey where he revisits his past, confronts the present and questions his future.

What's hot: Palekar has succeeded in creating the right atmosphere for the subject. He deals with the intricacies between the three characters beautifully. Rishi's dilemma and the images conjured up in his mind are presented gracefully. Performances by Antara Mali and Rituparna Sengupta are sincere and heartfelt.

Strictly for those who follow Palekar's work, ...And Once Again fails to captivate you despite its hauntingly beautiful setup.",1300665600,,1186,5.0152284263959395
