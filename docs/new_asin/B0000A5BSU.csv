1903074,4,B0000A5BSU,"So most people didn't like this movie, huh? Too bad. I liked it. A lot. Of course it's not a great movie, but it's entertaining. Who would go to see this movie expecting a great lesson in filmmaking? Anyone who does that is wrong from the start. If you see the trailer, you know this is a movie to watch while eating popcorn and just putting your brain on pause. It's far-fetched, it can get unbelievable at times, but who cares?
If you've seen the trailer, you know what's this about. After a constant use and abuse of a sysmic underground weapon, the core of the earth gets damaged and it just stops spinning. This causes the atmosphere to become thinner and it's easier for the UV rays to hit the earth. Birds lose their sense of navigation and the constant EM pulses stop clocks and pacemakers. In one great sequence, a NASA shuttle re-entering the atmosphere deviates unintenionally and crashes in Los Angeles. And the worst is about to happen.
That's when Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) and his friend, the sweet, ever loyal Serge Leveque (Tchky Karyo) are called in by the military. In a mission that requires travelling into the center of the earth, formal Col. Bob Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) and tough-but-beautiful Major Rebecca Childs (Hilary Swank) are recruited to drive the vehicle of choice. Self-serving Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), the shy geek Ed Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo) and the freaky nerd computer-kid Rat (DJ Qualls) also join the team which is assigned with the mission of detonating several nukes in the core of the earth in order to create a flow of energy in the right direction that will put the core into a spinning mode once again. That's it, you get your mission, there are your characters, now just sit back and enjoy the ride. Mind you, it is an enjoyable one.
While the special effects are mostly good there are a few sequences which seem to be unfinished. Especially the scene where a lightning destroys a street in Rome or when the crew gets to a cave of cristals near the center of the earth. I am not into judging a movie by its special effects, since these are only mere tools designed to help the audience to believe that, what they're seeing, is real. Bad FX only remind you that this, indeed, is a movie. And I think that's the downside here. I don't know how many sequences use CGI, but there were sometimes when I felt I was looking at a videogame and when they're combined with actors or motion backgrounds, it just feels like a big B-movie. Being a fan of this type of movies allowed me to ignore all of this and just continue enjoying the film.
In the end, I felt it worked anyway. The movie did give me a feeling that I actually went to the center of the earth and came back. Before the end credits, I took a deep breath remembering all the odds the characters had to face and it was a nice feeling. It was really nice to see, for a change, that even though there was some flirting between two of the characters, it never leads to anything. There's not even a romance kiss before the big finale... although there is one but it's just out of pure happiness. There's not a marrying couple at the end, there's only a heavy sadness about unspoken heroes. After seeing movies like Pearl Harbor, in which a major history event is just used as a backrgound for a cheap love story, this sure was a breath of fresh air.
Acting is pretty good, especially Stanley Tucci, but the rest of the cast is great, so even when things seem a little far-fetched, the actors manage to give you a sense of reality, because their feelings seem to be pretty real. Scenes like Delroy Lindo breaking into tears out of frustration or Stanley Tucci suffering from a nervous breakdown were pretty much disturbing, in the way that you can relate to them and you can't blame because you know you'd possible act the same way if you were in that unreal situation. It's not that the destruction of the Golden Gate or Rome aren't impressive, but you can see that in every other movie. A fine cast such as this can make a smile or a tear way much heavier, emotionally, than a CGI destruction of a city. And that, I believe, is where the strenght of the film lies.
Critics love to tear this film apart but don't let them fool you. If you're into this type of movies, give it a try. It sure won't win any oscars and it sure won't make it to Cannes but hey, for about two and a half hours, you can have a nice time.",1048896000,59,4424,4.429447852760736
1903075,4,B0000A5BSU,"I enjoyed The Core.  In reality, traveling to the Earth's core is something that is almost certainly impossible, so criticizing this movie on scientific grounds is pointless.  It is an escapist fable, and on that level it succeeds well.  Or to put it another way, this is science fiction, not a documentary.
For me the pseudo-science was fun -- the laser that could vaporize stone, the super-strong metal the earth-craft ""Virgil"" was made of, the subterranean geology, and so on.  I thought the effects were interesting -- very colorful scenery as Virgil is passing through different layers, and the craft itself was pretty cool, like a hardened worm-drill.  The characters were all well cast, especially the two leads.  Hillary Swank was good as the pilot.  The lesser characters were somewhat stereotypical but also well played.  Stanley Tucci's self-centered star scientist Dr. Zimsky was sort of like this movie's Dr. Smith from Lost In Space.  Actually, Donald Pleasance in Fantastic Voyage is an even better comparison.  (The whole movie reminded me a little of Fantastic Voyage.)
This is a movie where suspension of disbelief is a must, especially for real scientists or science teachers.  But if you allow yourself to go along with the fantasy you should have fun.",1048809600,15,1272,5.0673076923076925
1903076,1,B0000A5BSU,"Giving it 1 star is giving it way to much credit.  This is a promising cannidate and possible winner of worst movie of the year, and is definatly one of the most painful movies I've ever sat through, and I watch everything.

1903077,2,B0000A5BSU,"Journeyman director Jon Amiel, who gave us COPYCAT and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE looks like he's gone for B-movie territory somewhere between cliche-ridden disaster movie and tounge-in-cheek action. The special effects do look impressive, and it could be one of those dumb but fun popcorn munching flicks. But with a no-name cast (Except for Hilary Swank) and non-existent plot, this is one of the few upcoming movies that could go both ways. Not that many people care though.",1047168000,7,478,4.9875

1903094,3,B0000A5BSU,"The Core is sort of like the Sharknado of travelling to the center of the Earth films.  It's so bad, it's actually quite entertaining at times.  I knew nothing of this film when I pressed play, other than it was a save the world, travel to the center of the Earth film.  I have to say I actually found the bizarre disasters pre going into the Earth scenes, a lot more entertaining than the rest of it.  The random people dropping dead, the pigeons dropping dead who suddenly developed the ability to smash through and break building windows with their corpses, and the shuttle landing in that LA drain from Terminator 2, Grease and other movies.  I tell you, you'll turn to those in the room and say, you knew there would be some stupid stuff in this sort of movie, but I bet you didn't a space shuttle crash landing in that LA drain!  Of course all of these scenes look totally fake, the CGI is very cheap and unfinished looking.  Then we have the actual vehicle they travel to the center of the Earth in.  This thing has no credibility at all.  Somehow it can also drop through big gaps in the Earth like you backed it on a trailer and tipped it off a cliff on the surface and the people inside don't get killed.  Somehow you can still communicate from a base on the surface this thing while it is underground too.

Hilary Swank's character is over the top  in a women can do anything role, she can tie her teammates tie, she can pilot a shuttle, she can do everything better than men. One tells her, that's you're weakness, you've never failed at anything.  Also has DJ Qualls probably best known from the film Roadtrip when this came out in 2003, but better known today as Citizen Z from Z Nation.  His character Rat in this one is pretty much exactly the same character.",1507939200,,1775,4.355623100303951

As far as disaster movies go, I loved it and considering my track record of late with old movies I thought were great, this one lived up to my memory of it.  A cast of witty characters and despite Hilary Swank (I don't see why everyone likes her so much, her acting is condescending and subpar...) and Bruce Greenwood's performances, it was a good adventure...loved it.

1903119,3,B0000A5BSU,"Released in early 2003 and directed by Jon Amiel, The Core is a sci-fi disaster flick starring Hilary Swank as a hotshot pilot who flies a giant drill into the core of the earth with a team of experts (Aaron Eckhart, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo & Bruce Greenwood). Why? The earth's magnetic fields have gone wild and the only answer is to journey to the center of the planet, plant a series of nuclear charges and get out, thereby restoring the proper magnetic fields. DJ Qualls and Alfre Woodard offer assistance topside.

The plot is a meshing of 1959s Journey to the Center of the Earth and 1998s Armageddon, but its not as entertaining as either. One problem is that it lacks star power for such a blockbuster. Dont get me wrong, the main cast members are stalwart in their roles, but none of them were top-drawer actors at the time; and only Swank went on to a fairly stellar film career, although Greenwood has done pretty well and Eckhart has done okay. Im just saying that they're a far cry from Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Michael Clarke Duncan (all from Armageddon).

Despite the incredible disaster scenario and the dubious science (I guess thats why they call it science-FICTION, huh?), the storys fairly engaging, occasionally thrilling and sometimes even wondrous in the manner of 1966s Fantastic Voyage and 1979s Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The main characters being stuck in and around an earth-burrowing ship also bring to mind movies like 1979s Alien and 1989s The Abyss. Yet The Core somehow comes across as second-rate to these hallmark films (not that Im a big fan of The Abyss, but its better than this).

Jon Amiel directed 1993s underrated Sommersby and 1999s Entrapment, but when The Core flopped at the box office (not majorly, but it still failed to make a profit) he left behind feature films for TV directing, which he didn't even do until two years after The Core. Still, its worth checking out if you like the cast and are in the mode for an earth-threatening disaster flick.

The film runs 135 minutes and was shot mainly in British Columbia, but with scenes from around the US and world (e.g. the Golden Gate Bridge, Rome, Paris and Trafalgar Square, England).

1903124,5,B0000A5BSU,"People always like to poke fun at the science behind The Core, as if that's its one defining factor, but this movie is solid for reasons BEYOND the hokey science. The acting is outstanding, and more importantly the philosophical meat of the story - the social science - is what sells it. There are plenty of ""oh no, the world might be ending if we don't save it"" movies out there, but The Core remains one of my favorites because it exposes more of the inner struggle, the common man worries, that ordinary heroes thrust into this situation might have. An older mentor just wondering if he'll be able to save his family. An ambitious young officer who has to learn how leading means being responsible for the losses as well as the wins. A good-natured scientist trying to shoulder the burden of leading a team to save 7 billion lives. The idea of sacrificing for the greater good.

1903174,4,B0000A5BSU,"A sucker for sci-fi, I stumbled on this film by accident on one of those evenings when you just feel like sitting down in front of something a bit mindless. I knew that it had been panned by the critics and flopped at the box office. The cast were all unknown to me, except Hilary Swank for whom I assumed it was an early career folly. To cut a long story short the critics and public were wrong this is a very entertaining film which  unlike most action films - stands a repeat viewing.

The tone is very tongue-in-cheek (as befitting the basic premise of sending a manned mission to the earths core). As for the allegations of poor science, well the science was worse in Danny Boyles po-faced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine/dp/B0013KTGAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine</a>&nbsp;(which didn't get half the stick over the science which this film got and was much less fun), and any film depicting faster-than-light travel or sound travelling in a vacuum (hello Star Trek, hello Star Wars). The basic science of the earths structure and the how and why of its magnetic fields appears sound to me (an interested non-scientist). True, lower gravity for Virgil's occupants nearer the Earth's core would have been a nice touch which is ignored.

The cast looked like they were having fun making this film: a good sign. Aaron Eckhart acts as if he consumed a lot of coffee before coming on set each day! Stanley Tucci is very comedic as Dr Zimsky, the celebrity scientist who takes himself far too seriously but comes good in the end. D J Qualls (whom I haven't seen in anything before or since) is well cast as a master computer hacker. Delroy Lindo turns in a nice performance as the Ed Brazzleton, the genius behind Virgil  a shame that he is set up for a Captain Oates moment as his character is the most sympathetic one in the film.

The director, Jon Amiel, cut his teeth at the BBC where he made the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singing-Detective-The/dp/B007RGB58G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singing Detective, The</a>&nbsp;(a 1980s TV classic perhaps unknown in the States), so not unsurprisingly there are a host of details which makes this film stand repeat viewings. Virgil is based on a subway train! Unobtanium is a scientists joke  not to be taken too seriously! There are nods to Fantastic Voyage, plus every other film ever made about drilling to the earths core. The screenplay has some great throwaway lines: its my kung fu and its powerful! its not a stupid ship, plus Zimskys closing soliloquy.

There are flaws. While the special effects are very good, the geode scene could have used some more detail  its a wasted opportunity to have done something truly spectacular - all we get is the comment ""it's a crystal Grand Canyon"", a sense of scale and distant twinkling. More seriously, the films plot starts to unravel somewhat as Virgil approaches the core itself. There are at least two mishaps too many at this point. While the Dr Zimsky character is doomed, poor Ed Brazzleton is set up for a Captain Oates moment on a design flaw which wouldnt have happened in real life, even if he only had three months to build the ship. Plus did they really need to boost the last bomb with the fuel rods? At least Virgil could have been allowed to use its laser on the return journey to the surface  steering its way through the earth's structure on impeller only was a stretch too far for this viewer! But at the end of the day it's only a superior B-movie not a masterpiece.

I wonder if this film was really just the victim of bad release timing. The Space Shuttle crashed in real life just before its release which must have made the opening scene appear insensitive. With the second Gulf War raging the film-going public in 2003 wanted other-worldly fantasy such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, or fluffy escapism such as My Big Fat Greek Wedding  not a global disaster epic with a the military establishment are up to something and cant be trusted subtext. Perhaps it would have done better 5  or better still 40 - years earlier!

This movie has been blasted for its scientific inaccuracies.

Clearly all too many people don't understand what the word FICTION stands for in SCIENCE FICTION.

(It means the story is going to be made up).

And THIS story is High Adventure in the Grand Style.

The stars (including Academy Award Winner Hilary Swank...who has come a long way since the early '90s when she used to advertise herself as ""Buffy's best friend"" which she was, in the movie...not the TV series) are all fantastic in their roles.

Okay, the digging machine they all ride down in wouldn't work...so what? Did you think the machine used in UNKNOWN WORLD (1951) would work? The ""Cyclotram"" (as it was called---meaning the drill in front (which was probably made from unobtanium) whirled around while the rest followed behind like a ""tram"") wouldn't have worked either. It was supposed to be under 2500 miles of water at one point, which would have crushed it and everyone on board).

But in 1951 nobody cared. It was good escapist entertainment and enjoyed as such.

Just as THE CORE can and should be.

If you want completely accurate science take a science course at a University (you won't get it there, either, but you'll at least get the current version of completely accurate science until new discoveries change it. I have lived through a 9 planet solar system vs. the current model of 8. I have watched the battle between Steady-State and the Big Bang Theories. I was 15 in 1965 when it finally became clear that the Big Bang Theory was going to win. And win it did.  And for a long time we understood that when a star collapses it forms a black hole, at the center of that is a core or ""singularity"" which MAY get hit by a boson from the Higgs field causing it to expand and creating a whole new universe!
Until Stephen Hawking revealed that Black Holes don't do that and that the ""Initial Singularity"" was NOT from a Black Hole after all. This initial singularity was a gravitational singularity of infinite density that contained all of the mass and spacetime of the universe until quantum fluctuations caused it to rapidly expand in the Big Bang* and subsequent inflation. (The universe is not heading for a ""Big Crunch"" as the previous model showed because it just keeps on expanding).

All of these ten dollar words probably mean something to Dr Hawking and his fellow boffins but I don't care. What I get from all this is that scientific accuracy is very much a ""work in progress"" and I am not going to let it ruin my enjoyment of a really action-packed and exciting movie.

And that is MY Kung-Fu!

* Actually, the term ""Big Bang"" is something of a misnomer. Firstly because what came from the Initial Singularity was basically a stream of hot gases what you had was more of a Big Pfffft and, secondly, even if it had been a Bang an external observer could not have heard it...no atmosphere for the energy waves to use to vibrate the observer's eardrum in order to create the electrical signal that would then travel to our hypothetical observer's ""hearing center"" in their brain and be registered as a ""bang.""
This is because everything, matter, energy, EVERYTHING  was IN the Singularity.
Secondly because there could not have been a hypothetical external observer for the same reason there could not have been a bang.

And, thirdly, yes...I am aware of the sound the body makes when it emits a stream of hot gases and, yes, this DOES mean that Stephen Hawking has turned the creation of everything into a Cosmic Fart Joke which millions of nerds (including the college professors who teach this stuff) giggle over as they watch STAR TREK reruns in their parents' basements after work,",1430006400,3,3727,4.651445966514459

In this case, the story concerns an egomaniacal scientist Zimsky (Stanley Tucci) who has collaborated with the military on a weapon called D.E.S.T.I.N.I. which they test, resulting in the earth's core slowing to a standstill.  Naturally, this error in judgment must be corrected before we all go the way of the dinosaurs.  So a crackpot team of experts is conscripted to make a trip to the center of the Earth.  Complications arise as they frantically race the clock to jump start the core again.  Will they make it in time!!!!!
Some will, most won't.

Of course it's a daffy premise.  It's just one excuse, among many, to place the planet in peril for our base amusement.  Something always goes awry and someone has to fix it.  That's what makes these types of movies such fun.  They're all pretty much the same but it's always a blast watching some national monument get destroyed (like Golden Gate Bridge or all of Rome).  I've always enjoyed disaster flicks because they're impossibly stupid and unrealistic.  If they were pure science they'd be boring.

I've watched this movie many times and will continue to watch it until the Earth stops spinning.  Nothing makes me happier than an end of the world scenario.  WE'RE DOOMED!

When I first heard of ""The Core"" I was excited to watch it.  It was something that sounded like a great idea and something that really had us wonder what they could do with this.  And it doesn't disappoint.  I love how this film is done.  The characters are great, the storyline is exciting, the adventure is amazing and fun, and nothing can ruin this film.

1903360,4,B0000A5BSU,"What I like about this one is that it's almost a throwback to those classic sci-fi films of the 50s and 60s that are almost entirely plot-driven, where the characters are like cogs in a clockwork moving predictably from one scene to the next.  I say ""almost"", because there is some character development in this film, and it's not really film footage wasted because of the actors' performances.  All of the actors in the film's major roles have all been nominated for some big awards, and there's one Oscar winner (Hillary Swank).  And as usual, Stanley Tucci is excellent, this time playing a Nobel-winning scientist with all the answers.

It's also a throwback in that if you pay too much attention to the ridiculous plot, you'll spend the whole film finding holes in it.  But if you just kick back and buy the (hopefully!) silly premise, it all kind of fits together in a 50s sci-fi kind of way.  The characters are very earnest in their belief that even a problem the size of the Earth's core can be fixed!  And maybe that's what made it work for me.  The actors' skills certainly had something to do with that.

But it's my belief that if you edited out the bulk of the character development, you'd end up with a film that feels a lot like Them or The Monolith Monsters, albeit on a much larger scale and with modern special effects.  If you watch movies like this only to pick at them, you won't enjoy this one very much I'm afraid.  But if you can get caught up in the premise and just play along, you'll be entertained, and along the way you just might be surprised and pleased by some fine performances, and some reasonably eye-popping special effects.

They really don't make them like this any more (and for good reason...  films like this are lucky to earn back what they cost to make!).

A quick word about the film's transfer on the Blu-ray disc...  it's excellent.  You won't be disappointed in that department.",1377216000,3,1926,4.539130434782609

1903448,2,B0000A5BSU,"There is no shortage of stupid movies in this world. Stroll down any aisle of your local blockbuster and you'll see tons and tons of movies based on really stupid ideas. Most of them are direct-to-video as they should be.
The Core is one of those ideas given an $85 million dollar budget (yes, they actually spent that much money on it). Aaron Eckhardt plays a geophysicist who discovers that the Earth's core has stopped spinning and soon the earth's magnetic field will disintegrate allowing deadly solar radiation to hit the earth's surface and kill off all life on the planet. In a series of contrivances too numerous to mention our boy Aaron finds himself attached to a top secret government project to get the core spinning again by going into the core with a special drilling ship and delivering a payload of a thousand megatons of nuclear weapons to get the core spinning again (I swear to God).
Here's a question for you: who's the bigger idiot, the guy who thought this up or the guy who greenlit it. This movie actually expects us to believe that a man made material can stand the pressure of molten iron 2600 miles deep. Well, according to the movie, the more pressure put on this special alloy the stronger it becomes. Yeah, okay.
Here are just a few examples of the many lapses in logic of this movie:

The entire outer core of the planet can stand still, but the outside keeps rotating allowing night and day.

Lightning can shatter massive stone columns.

The U.S. government can't stop one scientist with limited resources from discovering that the Earth's core has stalled, but it can keep the entire world from knowing 3 months later. I swear to god, at the end of this movie only the members of the secret project know what happened.

The long tube-like drilling ship goes straight down but the people inside of it can walk horizontally.
The good news is that the core is often side-splittingly funny. The sheer depths of stupidity that this movie attains had me doubled over with laughter, especially in the ""serious"" scenes. This is the type of movie that Mystery Science Theater 3000 was made for. The problem is that unintentional humor will only carry a movie so far.

Like another reviewer have said before, if you watch this film...try not to think too hard...just enjoy the ride and you'll like it!! It has good actors, an impossible plot, awesome special effects and lots of suspense.

As the earth is hit by a series of natural and non-conventional disasters due to the malfunction of the earth's electromagnetic field, a group of Geologist and Scientifics will have to build a ship that will be able to reach the core of the earth where a series of nuclear explosions will be used to restart the core's motion in order to restore the electromagnetic field...lol....Yes.. i know it sounds completely crazy but that's exactly why the film is good. The tone is serious, the entire planet will have to pray for this mission to succeed because if it doesn't, the whole planet will burn killing everyone and everything as fast as you can say ""hello""....

The acting is very good, Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank are 2 very talented actors but i think that Stanley Tucci's performance here is the best......you may not like him very much at the beginning but you'll realise  a bit later in the movie that he literally steals the show in most of the scenes. ......DJ Qualls also has  a very interesting character that should make you have a some good laughs. The cinematography was just right, i was hoping for nothing less. The picture quality in those types of movies is very important, it is suppose to make us believe all that stuff is true and i think Mr. John Lindley did a wonderful job here, all of those scenes where they're inside the planet making their way to the center of the earth were very well done. My favourite is when they're inside this huge Geode-like structure.....amazing stuff and beautiful colors!!!!

Overall this is a great movie to watch if you're looking for entertainment. Don't take it too seriously and have some fun.....you'll enjoy it I'm sure. It has lots of action and a few funny moments as well. Once again, all you'll need is a beer and a bag of chips and you'll be set!!

I am an engineer by education, a dedicated amateur astronomer, and a huge sci fi fan.  Almost 20% of my extensive home video library is catagorized as sci fi.  I don't watch sci fi movies for scientific accuracy; I watch them for entertaining creativity.  All sci fi movies take a kernal of scientific knowledge, add a little social spice, then creatively extrapolate the recipe to the ridiculous while presenting the theme as realistically plausible.  The Core is no different.  It is just a fun movie to watch. The cast worked well together with contrasting personalities.  The core seeking sub was creatively designed but unfortunately constructed out of a silly named material.

There is a scientific mistake almost every minute of the movie.  When you add bad acting, a bad script, and inane dialogue, you can't go wrong, ROFL all the way.  Yes, Hillary Swank appears in this film, but Olivier couldn't make anything serious out of this script, and Swank certainly doesn't show her Academy Award style here.  They also stick to the action adventure cliches quite closely, and that makes the overall plot completely predicatble and the characters are all one-dimensional.

1903460,2,B0000A5BSU,"The Core (Jon Amiel, 2003)

If there is one thing that Hollywood does very well, it's the big, stupid, action-laden fantasy-adventure flick (""fantasy"" in the sense that ""this could seriously never happen"" rather than ""dragons and swords""). Of course, I need to qualify that. When I say they do this kind of movie well, I mean they have the maximum number of explosions per minute audiences will take down to a science, and they know just who to cast for whichever stereotypes the movie needs, and they know that with a few seemingly-brave casting decisions, they'll catch a few critics off-guard and get some nice things said about the movie, enough to get it a decent opening week (after which receipts invariably plummet as the guys who wrote the more scathing reviews start getting quoted by people who finally got to see the film).It doesn't matter if the movie makes back its box office on the big screen, since video rentals will almost certainly top the budget. Besides, TBS and TNT have to do something when they're not showing Monk reruns, right?

If I sound a touch cynical about this, well, that's because I am. I am also, on a fairly regular basis, shocked by the sheer number of amazing actors who can get sucked into what is, essentially, a Schwarzenegger flick with some sort of pseudoscience layered over it to give it the semblance of intelligence (in fact, IMDB notes that the Earth and Ocean Science 310 course uses the film as a textbook in junk science). This is one of those times. Delroy Lindo? Hilary Swank? Tcheky Karyo? Alfre Woodard, for heaven's sake? Did you really need the money badley enough that you didn't flee screaming for the hills as soon as Deborah Aquila mentioned that Christopher Young (<em>Urban Legendi</em>, <em>Swordfish</em>, <em>Species</em>) was doing the soundtrack?

Plot: the earth has stopped spinning, and is in danger of going kaplooie unless the United States government ('cause no one else can do it!) can send a probe to the center of the earth to restart the core. So they start gathering folks who manage to be both expendable and good at what they do, either because they're fringe elements (Lindo as Ed Brazzleton, discoverer of ""Unobtainium"", which is a sci-fi in-joke; it's a derisive term used for ""and then a miracle happens"" in the sci-fi world), or because they messed up their last assignment (Swank, as Rebecca Childs, the pilot of the probe), or because their views aren't popular with the ruling class (Aaron Eckhart as Josh Keyes, the head of the team). I point this out as a nod to the film's subtlety and mastery of character, of course. Needless to say, they are racing against time, the odds against the project succeeding are about one in a million, and of course, everyone has to have deep, meaningful moments with other members of the team just before they croak.

No, there's nothing here you haven't seen a hundred times before, in movies that were either marginally better because they didn't take themselves so seriously (<em>Volcano</em) or just as crappy but had much bigger directors (<em>The Abyss</em>). But then, hey, <em>Armageddon</em> cleared, what, six hundred million and scored a Criterion release? (That is still one of the most improbable decisions in film history.) Why not pump out another barrage of big-budget action crap to see if wee can duplicate it? <em>The Core</em> did not. On the big screen, it made back a little over half its budget (not surprisingly, id made well over a third of its total big-screen receipts on opening weekend). But video rentals and TV showings made it a profit, and that's all that matters in Hollywood when you're on the level where you can actually budget sixty million dollars for a brainless action film. And as long as you're looking for a movie where stuff blows up a lot and you don't have to expend any brain power at all in service of the plot, you can do a lot worse than <em>The Core</em>. **",1307664000,,3937,4.793814432989691

Armageddon in that it's about a rag-tag group of people sent to save the Earth by going into an unknown place using experimental technology and using a nuclear explosion to help complete their task. Journey to the Center of The Earth in that it's about people going DEEP under the Earth. We haven't been more than 7 miles deep? Really? The Happening in that some of the actual disaster scenes are similar and it has a very cheesy vibe coming of it. So what are the results? A B-movie action flick that's well-done and quite enjoyable in the process.

The plot is about the Core of the Earth which is about to stop rotating, and creating a bunch of weird natural phenomenon in the process. A hole in the O-Zone layer or something melts The Golden Gate Bridge and half of San Francisco, Birds and a trout go haywire and inadvertently attack people, everybody with a pacemaker dies, and Rome is destroyed by static electricity and lightning. Yes, the film ignores science like it was of the Devil, but it's cheesy. It's supposed to be like that. Oh, did I mention the Shuttle landing sequence? Say what you want about this movie, but it has balls.

The result is an Armageddon-style trip to the Core of the Earth in an effort to restart it. Things so wrong, people die, people sacrifice themselves to save everybody else, they run into unexpected problems, they split up the ship, and the government isn't as nice as they seem. Sound familiar? Yes, it's clichd as all get-out, but it's a fun type of clichd. Part of this fun comes from the cast. Aaron Eckhart is likable/decent, Hillary Swank is serviceable, Stanley Tucchi is great, DJ Qualls is DJ Qualls, Delroy Lindo would have been better if he mentioned Sesame Cake, but hey, he's decent too. And last but not least, Bruce Greenwood is awesome as a wise leader/mentor. There's a French guy too, but he's French. You know he's not going to make to the end.

Another part of the entertainment is partially brought on by the environment. It's nice to see a spin of the Journey to the Center of the Earth tale. Granted, most of it looks like indistinguishable computer-generated stuff, but it's still serviceably original.

Overall, The Core is an appropriately fun and well-done take on familiar elements and story. It's not going to be Earth-stopping (See what I did there?), but it will most likely be entertaining if you are a non-Scientist.",1283817600,,2505,4.673469387755102

You have your 4 standard horseman of the earth disaster; nuclear war, space invaders, plagues (esp. those that create zombies), and meteors. Lately earth killing movies have gotten creative and lets face it stupid, global warming (The Day after Tomorrow), President George W Bush (Fahrenheit 911) and now The Core with it's well' I'm still not sure what broke.

The core of the earth stopped spinning (not the earth itself mind you) which is causing the electromagnetic field to dissipate. Okay, that sounds serious. So that would cause what exactly? Apparently the movie wasn't all that sure so we get scenes of some the lamest and implausible disasters ever. Let's put two under the scientific microphone shall we.

One involves birds going all Hitchcock in London due to their inability to navigate using the magnetic field. Okay that may effect the birds ability to fly south (Oh my god the pigeons they're going east!), but even the Mr. Magoo of the avian world wouldn't start flying into statues and buses.

In another of the all too short montages of disaster a lightning storm destroys the Roman Coliseum. I'm not sure which are more unlikely, lighting striking relatively short rock structure, or the granite exploding when it does. Lightning, last time I checked, was attracted to metal.

But what would you expect from a movie that puts a giant windshield in a rock-drilling machine (Made with that magic metal Unobtainium). Keep in mind I've only scratched the surface of the silliness.

Acting wise Stanley Tucci is a joy, Hillary Swank still kind of looks like a guy, and everyone else is forgettable. The Core is enjoyable in that bad 50's sci-fi kind of way.

An utterly terrible film about a bunch of astronauts and scientists who have to dive down to the core of the earth--which is in danger of ceasing to spin and thus destroying life as we know it through means that the audience never understands at all--The Core is awful on pretty much every level (writing, acting, sense-making, etc.) and is so stupid it almost (but not quite) comes around full circle and becomes smart again; however, the film manages to reach that fabled plateau of ""so bad they're good"" throughly enjoyable trash movies and you should definitely rent it if you want a laugh.

*Spoilers*

I tend to enjoy a good disaster movie, and I don't even mind the soft science that almost inevitably accompanies them - most truly exciting threats (like, say, the earth rapidly slowing its rotation) pretty much aren't plausible no matter how you slice it, so just make up some technobabble and I'll go with it.

""The Core"" is fun enough for a first viewing, but usually what will keep me coming back is the characters in a disaster movie. Fun, interesting, and amusing characters are good; cliched, annoying, irritating characters are not. Let's just get right down to the aspect that really turned me off to this movie, and that is Hillary Swank, or rather how this movie treats her. She starts off as a cliched Renaissance Woman who can do anything and everything (one character even asks her if there's anything she can't do and she replies that there's nothing she knows of), including land spacecraft by eyesight (and mad math skills) on narrow, improvised landing strips. As part of her ""character development"" (and I use the term loosely) she walks up to newly invented and malfunctioning things and jiggles wires and - viola - they work. I would find this annoying enough, but what *really* gets on my nerves is that the movie thinks this is a bad thing, and a huge amount of time is spent beating her about the head for thinking she knows too much. I hate to pull the 'sexism' card, but compared to all the actual jerks in the movie who *don't* get a dressing-down talk, it's just flat-out irritating.

The other major thing that turns me off to ""The Core"" is that the characters die off so predictably that it feels like they have numbers on the backs of their jerseys. I realize that the Alpha Nerd and the Obligatory Girl have to survive to the end (it's Hollywood Law), but would it be so much to ask that the other characters not line up and take a number on the movie wheel-of-death? One death in particular is so ridiculous and unnecessary that the only ""excuse"" offered is that the laughably bad ship design was due to the rushed building period, which is particularly funny because you'd think with *every Nobel prize winner ever* on the job, SOMEONE would have pointed out the rather glaring design flaw. Then again, maybe the problem is that pesky ""no Nobel prize for mathematicians"" thing - oh, the delicious irony.

In all seriousness, I liked the plot of ""The Core"" just fine, I just wish that there had been a bit more polish on the script and pacing. There are a lot of genuinely scary moments and a lot of really funny lines, and if they'd just shaken out the cliches and put a little more originality into the movie, I think it couldn't be very good - as it is, it's pretty much standard disaster movie fare with nothing to really stand out as unique or interesting.

1903493,3,B0000A5BSU,"The comparisons have been made before, but I'lll go ahead and make them again: this film is a lot like Armageddon, only the characters have to go into the Earth to rescue humanity, rather than into space.  Earth faces a number of catastrophic disasters (destruction of Rome & San Francisco),and humanity gathers a group of select people to save it.  They face perils on the way to, and at their destination, not the least of which is the people in mission control, who might end up hurting their mission.

With that being said, this is a pretty entertaining popcorn flick.  Although scientifically inaccurate, it is a pretty decent waste of time.  The characters are fairly stereotypical, but engaging on the surface level.  The special effects for the disaster scenes are pretty fun, and the plot was at least moderately entertaining.

This film starts promisingly:  there are mysterious catastrophes that are linked to man's messing with the Earth's core.  They have to fix it.  Unfortunately, what they come up with is what can only be called a magical technology:  a ray to cuts anything, and a material (for a tunneling device) that is more or less infinitely strong.  Once this magic is established, it has to succeed.

The characters are the strongest part, as the actors are really good.  Also, some of the underground locales are fun.  But this isn't good hard scifi.

1903501,4,B0000A5BSU,"The subject is interesting. The topic is fascinating. The treatment is quite reassuring. But the ideology is hateful. Imagine some natural, geological or cosmic catastrophe meaning the end of the earth, hence of humanity. The loss of the magnetic field of the earth is one possibility since it has been going down for a few decades and no one can explain. If such a phenomenon were truly happening, the normal reaction would be to bring all scientists around the world together to find a solution. There cannot be any moral and acceptable salvation for humanity, or even a little part of humanity if it does not mobilize everyone, every country, every nation. The film is unluckily hijacked by the military that imposes the vision of some aggressive attack from an enemy. They seem to listen to the scientists and politicians for a while, but at the same time they have their own Plan B ready which is purely military. That is why the military should have no power whatsoever and their finances should be scrutinized constantly, for them not to be able to have their own plans. That's why the finances of the military are supposed to be voted by Congress, but is what Congress votes always clear? Certainly not and that is true in every country. There are some blind or invisible lines hidden in some other budgets. That is revealing about a lack of democracy in our countries: the armed forces are not 100% open to public scrutiny and they do things they have never been allowed to do. The film though takes a clear stand against this and manages to defeat Plan B, thanks to a hacker in the place. We could of course wonder why they brought that hacker into the sanctuary. But for the film he was needed and was able to fulfill his promise. I must say I did not like his nose. Too visible, too outstanding. A hacker is supposed to be absolutely invisible, hence just plain normal, average, banal, in no way conspicuous. Then the treatment of the volunteers in that last chance mission is quite flat after all. A little bit of rage but a lot of positive tension. A situation in which one must sacrifice after the other should create a real tension that could be and become negative, including the absolute loss of all reactivity in an individual who knows there is no way out. But It was a pleasant film after all.

Anyway, it is puzzling why this film did not do better at the box office. It has most of the right elements:  Great acting--good casting (especially that cyber-nerd hacker (he was perfect!) and Hillary Swank (who is always good)--first-rate special effects--fantastic machines and gadgets--apparently a big budget--and an interesting plot (military vs academia, competing egos in the scientific world, saving the planet earth) with just enough twists to keep you engaged. The result is a very entertaining, engaging and highly imaginative science fiction gem.

The only thing missing (perhaps, depending on your point of view) is romance--there is no soap opera going on in the background--but who has time for romance when you are trying to save the world? There are, however, rivalries between the scientists and between military officers and subordinates to keep things interesting.

You've got: the young, hunky science professor (Aaron Eckhart); his romantic interest (Swank); the know-it-all, jerky antagonist practically begging for comeuppance (Stanley Tucci); the genius geek (DJ Qualls) who hacks government websites for fun and sport, and the poor, sympathetic but brilliant (a cast minority, of course) scientist (Delroy Lindo), who has been cheated out of all the rewards he deserves. How original. The plot is at least somewhat unusual, however. The earth's core has stopped rotating, which means the planet will be destroyed in a matter of months unless it can be ""restarted."" So, it is up to the group to burrow to the core so it can set off detonations that will jump start it. Their vehicle, which has all sorts of bells and whistles, is a marvel of technology that would be the envy of NASA or Boeing... and was built within three months no less! Along the way, the effects get more and more attractive, which is sufficient to hold our interest. Although it is all highly implausible, the filmmakers at least attempt to make most of it sound reasonable. Something that really defies explanation, however, is why Dr. Zimsky (Tucci) agrees to accompany the group on its mission to the core. Over the course of the film, it becomes clear his primary concern is self-preservation; therefore, why would he put himself at such high risk when he could stay in relative safety at the surface? Aside from Hilary Swank and the effects, the best thing I can say about this movie is it in no way involved Jerry Bruckheimer, who usually turns up to add his own special touch to every apocalypse movie (and that's not saying much for Bruckheimer).

She looks like Jolene Blalock - T'Pol from TV's Star Trek Enterprise, and it wasn't until the credits that I realized it was actually Swank and not Blalock in the movie.  Perhaps Swank was trying to camouflage herself.

The movie begins with a space shuttle landing in the LA River, which is interesting, but has nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie.  Next thing you know, the valiant pilot is recruited to some mission to drill to the center of the earth to restart the core, which got some spyware or something and stopped working.  As a result, the Coliseum and the Golden Gate Bridge get wiped out by lightning.  Don't ask.  The Feds then assemble a team to take a magic vehicle to the core, drop some nukes, and reboot the earth.

We learn some interesting things on the way, such as: Molten rock is completely clear.  There are really unconvincing sets with big fake crystals deep inside the earth.  And, if you're a jerk, you'll get killed by rolling nuclear weapons and then repent.

You can guess how it ends.  It's not great art, but it's dumb fun on a rainy day.",1148342400,8,1436,4.452107279693487

We never assumed, out of the many ufo and global warming disaster flicks, that the problem threatening the earth is earth itself. I find this premise particularly interesting.

1903541,2,B0000A5BSU,"This movie is billed as sci-fi and I'm surprised the editorial review says it is more realistic than Armageddon. What science? A fabric type suit that protects the wearer from 4000 degree temperatures and instantly pulverizing levels of pressure? I wonder how the suits were insulated to keep any inward wrinkle from doing the microwave effect on any part of the body it touched... AMAZING. For the characters to get out of the vehicle with a non-pressurized internal environment hundreds of miles below the surface of the earth, they would have to equalize for it and breathe a special air mix that is vastly helium to prevent too high an oxygen intake from causing oxygen toxicity. Next they would have to decompress to enter the vehicle again and at that depth, may as well figure on at least a couple of months of deco. However, no one has been able to use such an air mix below about 2000 feet yet, sooooooooooo, scratch that. That would mean the vehicle has to be pressurized so they can get in and out without all that. Too bad, won't work, still well beyond any depth they could breathe an air mix at. However, if they had taken this route in production, it would have been a great Chipmunks Save The World comedy listening to them talk. Also, if it was pressurized, that wild ride to the top at the end would have likely caused the vehicle to explode unless it could do some really rapid depressurizing. But even if it didn't, I'd hate to be the one taking the chamber ride to deco from that trip, which would have to be done inside the vehicle because it'd be impossible to transfer them to any other chamber than the vehicle itself while keeping them under pressure. And keep in mind that the first cases of decompression sickness, in this case ""the bends"", were recorded in the 1800s and thought to be some kind of disease. Those first cases were in miners and they were a lot shallower than several hundred miles.

A metal that gains strength as pressure gets higher, but aptly named unobtainium? Tell me how they made the craft with this metal when it can withstand the heat of the planetary core and applying pressure makes it tougher. The only way to form things is by applying some form of pressure. Maybe if they form it with a hammer and only strike it once in a while they might catch it unawares and can bend it here and there?

Armageddon is a scientific documentary next to this one. I read the reviews on it and saw where several shared the same gripes. Some were legit, some only highlighted that the science in the movie was of a higher level than their scientific acumen. And none that I saw pointed out the landing gears not shattering. Titanium or not, unless heated, they'd have splintered in such extremes of cold. But then again, being that the landing gear issue was never addressed in the movie, we don't know if they were heated or not.

The Core isn't an awful movie, but it also isn't very good. It's okay. It's better if you like science fantasy. It's just a bit disconcerting to see people say check your brain at the door before trying to rip a movie apart then make you wonder if they even just checked their brain.

We all know in this day and age of technology that if something of this magnitude would happen we would all burn up in a firey inferno. We can't maintain our computers much less build a giant centipede like machine to burrow to the center of the earth. Thats the beauty of this film and why i really enjoyed it. Basically it poses at ""what if"" we could do something about it kind of question, what would it be, and does it quite well i might ad. This movie has top notch special effects, much better than what ""The Day After Tomorrow"" could dish out, the acting is very good, yes these people actually ""cry"" and get very emotional when someone dies along the journey, they don't just shrug there shoulders and say oh well lets move on. Also the storyline is thin but very appealing, i like the way that they found each member of the crew and i also like the hacker that they found to use for there dirty work. So all in all this is what it says a ""SCI-FI"" movie that doesnt base anything on ok yeah we could sure do this or that, it just gets to the point and does it. And whoever is doing the science as i saw one reviewer say, has way to much time on there hands. Who really cares about whats the probability of the ship going there, or i don't think they'ed have enough air, or i don't think so. This is a fictional film folks, so watch it as such, and leave all your realistic interpretations of this film out of it. Enjoy.",1131494400,11,1557,4.193333333333333

Second, the plot is a joke.  Nothing to be said about it.

Third, the climax is ... is ... *sigh*  There really isn't one.  There could have been one if they had to explode their vehicle for the last over-the-top mega nuke thus making this a tragedy, but that would mean the writers could write.  They didn't and went for the sappy unbelieveable fizzing-out ending.

Don't buy this movie.  Don't rent it.  If you must see it, borrow it for free from your public library.  I did and I am so very glad I did.  If I had paid a penny to see it, I would have demanded my money back.

1903548,3,B0000A5BSU,"The end of the world is a concept that has been dealt with in movies several times, sometimes successfully, other times not so much.  The successes when they occur are generally huge box office blockbusters, such as; ""Armageddon"" and ""ID4: Independence Day"", unsuccessful examples would be the dismally boring films, ""Deep Impact"" and ""Battlefield Earth"".  Generally speaking, when Hollywood deems it time to do another end of the world disaster movie, the threat originates from somewhere in outer space, whether it be asteroids streaking towards Earth or aliens determined to annihilate us, space is where it all begins.  To shake things up Warner Brothers decided to do another end of the world disaster movie, but this time have the threat to civilization come from within Earth itself.

The story of ""The Core"" is the `what if?' tale of the Earth's core (or engine as it is referred to in this movie) no longer spinning.  This event causes numerous geological disasters to occur that will culminate with the complete destruction of the ozone layer, allowing the sun's rays to blast us into oblivion.  To prevent this disaster from occurring a team of scientific specialists are brought in to drill a hole into the Earth's crust down to it's core, using an experimental ship to get them there, and detonating a nuclear bomb that will in theory `kick-start' the Earth's core into spinning again.

With a hokey storyline pulled directly out of a B-movie science fiction film.  That borrows heavily from previous disaster films (""Armageddon"" for example), Warner Brothers looked as if they had a gigantic stinker on their hands.  But surprisingly Warner Brothers pulled off an entertaining, though predictable summer movie.  Good acting and dazzling special effects provide enough distraction from the flimsy storyline that feels way too much like ""Armageddon"", in the sense that the scientists must pilot an experimental ship into the Earth's core and detonate a nuclear device to prevent disaster.  That sounds an awful lot like a team of oil drillers and NASA scientists being sent into space to detonate a nuclear bomb that will split a huge asteroid in two pieces, averting disaster.

Complaints aside this was a well-acted film with a talented cast comprised of Delroy Lindo, Aaron Eckhart, and Hilary Swank.  Though I felt I had seen much of the movie before due to similarities, I still enjoyed the film for what it was, a good popcorn flick that is not intended to be thought provoking in any way at all.  If you are in the mood for a good disaster flick, or to just get away from it all for two hours then I recommend sitting down and watching ""The Core"".

1903550,4,B0000A5BSU,"One of this film's creators said in a documentary included on the disc that what they were trying to do with this film is capture the feel of the old-school sci movies where the brilliant scientists would save the world with techneological know-how. Anyone who loved the original War of theWorlds, the old The Time Machine, or the classic Forbidden Planet will know what he means. In those films there was more science and less crowd-pleasing idiocy. You cared about the characters not because they were good looking and wise-cracking, but because they seemed like real people who had noble and idealistic intentions. While some people may be glad that the golden age of sci-fi is gone, I for one long for it's return. Oh, and I think this movie is great!

In the past we have had Asteroids, Earthquakes, Alien Invasions, and recently even a new Ice Age. This time it's the earth's core. After some extremely exciting and attention-grabbing disasters (whole flocks of birds smashing into buildings and people, all the people in an area with pace-makers dropping dead instantly, and {my favorite} the space shuttle crashing in Los Angeles), we quickly find out from the frantic research of a brilliant scientist Keyes  (Aaron Eckhart) that the earth is in serious trouble. Because of military EM weapons testing, the core of the earth has destablized and stopped spinning. Since the spinning of the Earth's core is what created the magnetosphere shield that protects the planet from radiation and microwaves from outer space, this basically means that the whole planet is going to be cooked unless something is done soon.

And that's where some fun pseudo-science comes in. When our scientist explains to the government that there isn't anything anyone can do to stop the situation because going to the earth's core is impossible, my favorite line in the movie is spoken, ""Yes...but what if we COULD?"". From there on we have some science of the hyperdrive type (no such thing as hyperspace remember?), as a metal that becomes stronger the hotter it gets and the deeper the pressure is used by yet ANOTHER brilliant scientist (Delroy Lindo) is used to construct an inpeller-driven, rock shattering ship capable of taking four scientists (including the arogant fool who just may have caused the crisis {Stanley Tucci} and our main scientist's best friend {Tch&eacute;ky Karyo} who is an expert on scientific weapons manufacture yet has a heart of gold ) and two astronauts (somebody's got to drive the thing right?) all the way down to the earth's inner core (which is so far down it kind of boggles the mind) to detonate some nukes to jumpstart the thing.

Like all those summer blockbuster sci-fi flicks this movie has explosions, crashes, death and destruction. Unlike those other movies of recent manufacture there are characters that you actually care about, interesting dialog, and genuine ACTING to be found in this film.

Leading the excellent cast in the performance department is Hilary Swank, giving a wonderfully fresh and likable performance as an astronaut overachiever perfectionist optimist who longs for a chance to be in the driver's seat and lead. She plays well against our likeable, friendly scientist lead who predicts doom and gloom and loses his cool under pressure (and doesn't feel qualified for the burden thrust upon him) but keeps trying down to the end. His best friend is perhaps the most balanced of the crew, being a person who keeps his cool under fire and always manages to keep it real. The ship's designer is also a great character, as his pride, determination, and strong push to achieve the goal (rock solid nature) give his character a fatherly wise air.

The commander of the expedition (Bruce Greenwood) is a typical astronaut type, focused and confident but cautious. His character doesn't have much of a role though. The resident cynic (Tucci's character), who is so full of himself he wants to keep a running commentary on the entire voyage, is the ultimate naysayer know-it-all, the first to turn tail and try to run when things go bad, and arguably either the diva comic relief or the perfect stereotype of everything that can be irritating about scientists. There is also a hacker who calls himself ""Rat"" (DJ Qualls) and a couple of government people who either encourage, discourage, or push our heroes on the way to their goal. Mostly the movie is about Swank's character and our mild-mannered scientist though. And that's a good thing, as they are both very likable characters.

The pacing in this film is aggressive and snappy for the most part, keeping us watching attentively right till the end credits (good film editing is also aparent from the tight feel of the movie). The sound effects are great, and the music is appropriately rousing. Indeed, perhaps the only downside to this movie the fact that it looks like corners were cut on the special effects out of necessity. There are shots of the space shuttle in space in particular that look like something a student could render on his home computer.

I guess that's why I call this a B-movie (though a great one). It seems apparent that the makers of this film were running under a tighter budget than most blockbuster filmmakers. In the end though, what could have been a disaster instead is a real treat. There are movies that are silly because they were poorly made, and movies that have the feel of an old classic genre that makes you smile because of the tight direction and production involved. This is one of the those movies. Fans of 60's, 70's, and 80's sci-fi and fantasy movies will probably have a blast with this one if they approach it with an open mind.

1903553,3,B0000A5BSU,"There's no question that the science behind The Core is unconvincing and absurd. Of course, the outer core *could* conceivably stop spinning because of a device invented by a madly genius  and egotistical geophysicist, and this *could* cause a disruption in the electromagnetic field that protects us from the sun, but the manner in which it happened in the film is bizarre and unlikely. Also, the likelihood that the ""savior"" who built the machine and developed the hull of the ship that protected it under the tremendous and heat as they bored through the earth is, well, silly.

However, the science behind Star Wars is similarly unbelievable. Why is Star Wars exciting then? (And I'm not referring to the first two films, which aren't terribly good - the word is still out on Revenge of the Sith.) Because it presents a scenario that is exciting and edgy, replete with suspense.

In my humble opinion, I believe that The Core has received undue negativity because of the improbability of the science behind it. However, it's not the science that is the driving force of the film. As viewers, we need to do the same thing we did with films like Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: we need to suspend disbelief with regard to this quixotic undertaking . Once we successfully do that, we have a taut, engaging film with good performances, even if some of the dialogue is trite, and the interpersonal relationships rife with clich&eacute;s, as well as the actual characters themselves. What causes the film to rise above the scientific anomalies, the dialogue, and the relationships is the solid acting and the exciting race to the center of the earth.

Hilary Swank was criticized as being miscast for her role in this film, and upon watching it, I was puzzled as to why. Certainly, choosing her character to be second in command was perplexing, even if she did manage a seemingly unnavigable landing in the beginning of the film. Nevertheless, her acting was solid. She has been miscast in other roles, but not here. Her humane resiliency seemed ideal for her character.

One thing that I particularly enjoyed about The Core was that nobody was safe. At any given moment, anyone could die. This is a risky undertaking. Too many films have all of their heroes happy and fine at the end, but here there were no guarantees. High props for that.

I wasn't expecting much from the film, and was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed it. While I am writing what certainly comes off as a highly favorable review, I can't ignore the problems I mentioned above when coming up with a final rating.

But then all laws of physics are just completely, absolutely, ridiculously thrown out the window as we're asked to somehow suspend disbelief that a nuclear-powered subterranean torpedo is going to be able to withstand the heat, pressue, and general physical abuse to burrow to the center of the earth.

Still, it is good enough to qualify as an entertaining disaster film in the mold of ""Volcano"" and ""Asteroid"" that will keep you entertained for a couple hours.

I think it is most reminiscent of the 1967 epic ""Fantastic Voyage"" where a minituarized crew including Racquel Welch went around inside a guy's body in a little submarine, looking for some kind of physical ailment. The plot of this film came very close to ""Fantastic Voyage"" if you consider the Earth equivalent to the sick guy from three decades ago.

The cast is very good though. Aaron Eckart, Hilary Swank, Delroy Lindo, Stanley Tucci, Tcheky Karyo, Alfre Woodard and Bruce Greenwood are all excellent actors. But in this piece, it seems they signed up for the $ and the special effects blah, blah, not for the script. Forget the fact that this may or may not be possible. What ticked me off was the speed with which the ship capable of tunneling into the Earth's core is built-because it has to be, the swift nature of each member of the crews training-everyone is a genius and capable, the ease with which Rat, the internet hacker, manages to keep the situation a secret from the rest of the world-despite the fact that the Coliseum in Rome and much of Rome, the Golden Gate Bridge, and probably countless other cities and citizens are destroyed under a black and auroral sky....

The Core has no scope. Are the finest, most capable people all at the ready of the U.S. gov't? That narrow scope, which allows the story to plug along, aggitated me.

Eventually the film is just stupid, and great actors are wasted, as are their characters.

1903558,3,B0000A5BSU,"I've watched every big budget SciFi/Fantasy/Horror film that has come out since 1983. And although some have pleased me greatly (Lord of the Rings, The Ring, etc.), I have to say that The Core fell pretty flat.

One of my favorite genre-related films of late was K-Pax, starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Why? Because the CHARACTERS were paramount to the story, not any form of technology or science.

Here, in The Core, we have a bit of a mixture but most of the emphasis was placed on the science needed to get the characters TO the center of the earth. At least that's the way I saw it. The ship design, the lasers, crush depth pressures, etc. got a bit too much screen time for my liking. I would've liked to have learned more about these people, their lives, their families, why they're willing to risk everything and try and save the planet. We never really find this out (with the one exception being the butthead scientific advisor to the Pentagon who does it all for fame and fortune...in the beginning). So when several of them begin to die off in gruesome fashions, the emotional impact is negligible on the viewer.

Hollywood? Are you listening? Look back to the days of old! The Day the Earth Stood Still, for example. It's always GOT TO BE the characters that pull the story along; not the science.

Some might say that I'm anti-science. But I'm not. For science fiction films, that element has to be in there in some way (usually).

I will commend whoever wrote the dialogue. It wasn't forced and had some zing! to it:

Example, ""What will it take to make your ship in three months, Doctor?""

""Oh about 15 billion dollars.""

""Will you take a check?""

<other charcter chimes in with> ""I thought you'd go with a credit card for the frequent flyer miles.""

I was willing to go along with the story all the way to the middle of the film on entertainment value alone...then my brain fired up and I was dismayed.  The story is an apocalypse tale where the spinning core of the Earth has somehow stopped and needs to be jump-started with nuclear detonations.  Okay, I'm game!  Sounds fun!  The special effects are decent.  There is the usual array of characters from the geeky internet genius who's only sustenance throughout the film consists of Hot Pockets and grand latte's to the cocky scientist who's wealth has been obtained through stealing others ideas.  There is a love interest, of course, with the two most attractive actors slowly but inexorably attracting one another.  There is a pat Hollywood ending complete with applause...and I know if my brain hadn't started working out the details of the plotting I would have enjoyed this film much more.  As it stands, this film is closer to a 4 star rating than a 3 star rating, with most of the characters being more or less human with their flaws showing on their sleeves.

1903563,2,B0000A5BSU,"It seems like every summer, the world is about to be destroyed by a disaster of epic preportions and the plots seem to get more ridicilous every year. If you sat through Michael Bay's ""Armageddon"" in 1998 then you've probably seen this one before. This time, trade an asteroid the size of Texas for a whole bunch of solar storms that are being caused by a top-secret government project that has caused the planet's core to stop rotating. The Earth's only hope is a mixed bag of geophysiscists, astronauts, and other super-nerds who plan to drill into the Earth and restart the core with a bunch of nuclear weapons.

The script from ""Core"" seems like it was ripped right out of Michael Bay's recycle bin. We've got all these picture perfect know-it-alls who seem to be both smarter and more clever than their government counterparts. We've got countless CGI disaster sequences. Hell, they even shamelessly steal the ""drawing straws"" concept from ""Armageddon"" as well. Unfortunately, it never manages to ""borrow"" the most appealing aspect of a Bay film which is the over-the-top honky tonk melodrama. Jon Amiel uses his share of big special effects pieces but it all seems more for show than anything else. Maybe it's the fact that I've been treated to more apocalyptic disaster films than I can count on two hands but ""Core"" just seemed far too predictable. The sense of dread that comes with an ""end of the world"" event like this seems noticeably absent.

""The Core"" is more of the same generic junk food that Hollywood loves to recycle. If you still haven't had your fix of disaster movies with overqualified ensemble casts then by all means, give this one a whirl. It makes ""Armageddon"" and ""Volcano"" look like National Geographic specials in comparisson.",1096675200,,1757,4.8533333333333335
1903564,1,B0000A5BSU,"This movie is awful on every level.  Diologue, acting, special effects, direction, what else is there?  It isn't even suspensful.  I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen",1095292800,4,198,4.6
1903565,3,B0000A5BSU,"Every one knows all too well that far too often trailers for movies contain the best bits and that when you see the entire film it fails to live up to the expectations inspired by the aforementioned trailer.  That was hardly the case with the trailer for ""The Core,"" which was totally upfront with the fact that this 2003 film is about the end of the world as we know it coming about because the earth's core has stopped spinning...

You really cannot type anything after you make a declaration like that.  I can remember the first time I saw the trailer for ""The Core,"" hearing this premise and turning to my wife to request that she provide to me, free of charge, a respite from sexual intercourse (only not in those words).  Granted, I never took physics (or chemistry or biology) so my knowledge of rudimentary science is just about nil, but even I would think that not only would the core not stop spinning that if it did we would all be dead before we knew it had happened.  We have been waiting for large objects from outer space to strike the earth in movies from ""When Worlds Collide"" to ""Armageddon,"" but having global destruction come from the heavens we are now going the other way.

What stops you from totaly dismissing ""The Core"" is the cast.  You have Aaron Eckhart as Dr. Josh Keyes, the first scientist to put together what is happening; Tchky Karyo as Dr. Serge Leveque, the weapons expert who is not thinking about saving the entire planet but more his wife and kids; Delroy Lindo as Dr. Ed Brazzleton, who creates the technology that allows our merry little group to get to the center of the earth; Stanley Tucci as Dr. Conrad Zimsky, supposedly the smartest man on the planet (by his own admission);  Bruce Greenwood as Col. Robert Iverson, space shuttle pilot and commander of the group; Hilary Swank as Major Rebecca Childs, the hot-shot navigator who still has something to learn; DJ Qualls as ""Rat"" Finch, the greatest computer hacker on the planet; Richard Jenkins as Gen. Thomas Purcell, in charge of the emergency project; and Alfre Woodard as Talma Stickley, head of mission control.

That is a pretty solid cast with Woodard the only one who is really wasted and every one of them totally buys into their role.  They treat this stuff seriously and have these intense discussions as if they really were figuring out how to restart the core and save the planet, coming up with whatever plan in the alphabet is needed after each goes horribly wrong for some unsuspected reason.  In an interview Qualls talks about how the science in the film is understandable.  Not realistic or, say, scientific, but that you get what they are doing and why they are doing it as they go along.  That is true.  You can laugh at what this film comes up with for science, but you do understand what it is they think they are doing, even if you could not go out and explain it to somebody else two minutes later.

Director Jon Amiel (""Sommersby"") has a reputation for emphasizing character and story over special effects, and that is indeed the case here.  You can laugh at the story and what these characters are doing, especially when they are out wandering around outside their ship at the center of the earth, but I think you will find it difficult to laugh at the characters (well, okay, Tucci is asking for it throughout, but he is the film's ""heavy"").  However, we keep getting back to the story.

Clearly the makers of this film do not want to deal with the subject on a realistic level.  The first deleted scene on the DVD is a touching moment when Eckhart's Dr. Keyes informs his two lab assistants that they have had a crush on each for a long time, gives them his credit card, and tells them to check into a hotel and order a bottle of champagne.  He knows the word is going to end within 100 days and they run off, never seeing the tears in his eyes as he confronts the end of the world.  But that scene gets cut because there is little in the film that deals with the terror of the end of the world.  Instead we get guys quipping about funding emergency project to save the world should be done with a credit card rather than a check (you get mileage that way).  The change in the credit card point in this movie says it all.

I know that this is supposed to be a science fiction in the grand tradition of those films from the 1950s and 1960s when smart people figure out what is wrong and smart people figure out how to solve the problem (e.g., ""Them"").  I know that this is, on several levels, simply ""Fantastic Voyage"" for this generation, and yet another part of the genre that insists that no matter how dire the circumstances, human ingenuity can save the day (unless it is a planet rather than an asteroid that is going to crash into Earth, in which case we draw lots and save a couple dozen people).  I am also pretty convinced that all the science is purposefully absurd, but when I learned the nuclear devices had to be placed at the right spots within inches and exploded at the proper times within microsecond, my bubble of suspended disbelief popped.  Ironically, the fact that the actors are so earnest and so good in their roles just made the absurd science seem all that more absurd.  You can certainly enjoy ""The Core"" on some level, but it is probably safer to be prepared to be disappointed, even with the trailer giving fair warning.",1095206400,8,5375,4.4851282051282055
1903566,4,B0000A5BSU,"""The Core"" is a fun film to watch.  Like all films in this genre, it has an impending disaster with catastrophic results waiting in the wings unless a motley crew of scientists, military folks and nerds can get something together to put an end to the destruction of the world.  It has sensationalized gizmos, unbelievable heroics, and wonders out the wazoo.  But let's be honest, that's why people watch movies like this.  They're fun, sometimes moving, and a great way to kill a couple of hours without having to worry about the real world.

You could bunch this movie together with similar disaster flicks like ""Deep Impact,"" ""Armageddon,"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow.""  Heck, you can also throw in movies like ""Independence Day.""  On the other hand, ""The Core"" has something that these films don't, and that is good acting and a fairly decent script.  I actually felt for some of the characters in this flick.  Aaron Eckhart has one particularly moving scene with Hilary Swank's character after she is forced to make a decision that results in the death of a crew member.  In the typical scenes of this genre, where a character sacrifices themselves for the others and the good of mankind, the acting is so good that you forget how standard this type of scene is in a disaster film.  That's what sets ""The Core"" apart from the rest of the pack.  Throw in great comedy from D.J. Qualls as a hacker-supreme and the snooty air about Stanley Tucci's professor and you've got a fun film worth multiple views.

With a brilliant cast, good special effects, and a solid script for this genre, I highly recommend ""The Core"" for some rainy-day, popcorn-type fun.",1094083200,3,1655,4.744755244755245
1903567,2,B0000A5BSU,"""The Core"" has all the elements of one of those Hollywood blockbusters. You've got your fancy (cough, cough) CGI special effects. You've got a cast of well-known actors, at least a few anyway. You've got the requisite ""save the world"" theme. You've got the requisite moral quandaries. And you have the ""do or die"" dialogue necessary for an apocalyptic action film. With these components in full view, how could the movie do anything but succeed? Unfortunately, the mindless, mediocre plot with more holes in it than a pound of swiss cheese ultimately sinks ""The Core."" Perhaps Tinseltown can't help itself anymore; they are so desperate to bring in audiences that they'll heap more and more eye candy atop a shallow premise if they think people will buy into it. Movies like this one have finally convinced me that the airheads in Hollywood think most people are idiots. No wonder we have to put up with the political natterings of Babs Streisand, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, and Rob Reiner; these folks actually think everyone else is so stupid that what they say will sound like the learned musings of brilliant minds. The next time you see one of these ""celebrities"" on a political talk show belching out the latest far left dogma, remember that these are the people responsible for films like ""The Core.""

The plot is so simple a two year old could summarize it (and probably see through it, as well). At the start of the film, we see about thirty people keel over for no discernable reason. The military calls in a couple of big shot professors, one of them Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) from the University of Chicago, to ask them whether the fatalities were due to a terrorist attack. Nope, say the professors, and that's the end of it until a bunch of pigeons go nuts in London. Suspecting something is amiss, Keyes and a couple of his graduate students figure out that the earth's magnetic fields are going bonkers. Moreover, he concludes, with the help of arrogant government scientist Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), that the planet's core no longer turns as it should. If the problem is not corrected in a short period of time, the results will prove catastrophic: electrical storms of savage proportions and the solar wind will turn the globe into a blasted ball of dirt within a year or two. Fortunately, the government knows of a way to possibly avert such an unpleasant series of events. It won't be easy, not by a long shot, but it could be possible to send a crew of humanity's best to the center of the earth in order to restart the core, thus arresting impending destruction.

Conveniently for us peons, the smart people have a few tricks up their sleeves. First, there's Dr. Ed Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo) mucking around out in the desert with a laser contraption that will cut holes through solid rock in a matter of seconds. Too, this guy just happened to invent a substance that will withstand massive amounts of heat and pressure--called with a straight face ""unobtanium""--that will make for the perfect shell to any potential underground craft. Yippy! Now all the government has to do is bring on board hotshot space shuttle pilot Major Rebecca Childs (Hilary Swank), along with the best computer hacker in the world (D.J. Squalls), and the mission is a go. Everything's slapped together in a matter of months, amazingly enough, and the team sets out with a bunch of nuclear bombs to set matters aright. Predictably, all sorts of problems emerge that the team must deal with to complete the mission. Also predictably, most of the crew perishes in the attempt. There are even a few moral quandaries tossed in for good measure so we can learn how the various team members grow as a result of the difficulties encountered. Am I giving anything away when I say that the mission eventually succeeds? Nope.

I'm not saying this picture doesn't have its uses. ""The Core"" is fun in a so bad it's acceptable sort of way, although it cannot compare to the endlessly entertaining atrocities brought to us from Ed Wood, Jr. or Herschell Gordon Lewis. This picture relies on those immensely overused tried and true formulas straight from the stilted minds of La La Land. There's the evil government weapons project, the secretive military/industrial complex, rampant and ludicrous environmentalism, and fruitcake science all wrapped up with a pretty bow for your viewing pleasure. Overall, the movie does entertain if for no other reason than you can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing (and the lousy CGI effects). The one scene that arguably takes the cake is how the surviving crewmembers manage to steer the shattered remains of the vessel from the center of the earth to the surface without using the rock cutting lasers. I can't repeat the phrase I blared out repeatedly as I witnessed this inanity unfold. Oh brother!

Aside from the film, which runs an amazing two hours plus, the DVD comes with a bunch of extras. After watching ""The Core,"" you can listen to a commentary track with director Jon Amiel, view deleted/extended scenes, learn about the special effects seen in the movie, and watch a ""making of"" documentary. Trailers included on the disc are ""Timeline,"" ""Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,"" and a promo for the ""Indiana Jones"" boxed set. I can think of dozens of science fiction films worth watching instead of ""The Core."" But if you want to laugh out loud at antics wallowing in sheer absurdity, this one might well serve your purposes.",1093737600,3,5496,4.8126984126984125
1903568,3,B0000A5BSU,"My my my...what a stellar cast for such a bone-headed film. Yes, disaster flicks per se are not intended to be Shakespeare, and are known for predictability, but a good one is not flat-out stupid.

OK. So, the core of the earth has stopped, possibly due to something called ""Destiny"", which resides in a standard-issue, mysterious but rectangular, hiding-in -plain-sight Government desert hangar thingee.

It's time to burrow into the earth, blow stuff up with big bombs, and kick-start the earth's engine.

Since there's no way this could work without something happening along the way, the back up plan involves using this ""destiny"" thing.

Again.

That's kinda stupid.

Moving on, the actual coring through the earth was fun for the first part...crunching through the crust I guess you could say. Then it gets sort of psychedelic, like they're flying through some bad Peter Max LSD trip.

I thought of the film, ""Yellow Submarine.""

That's not complimentary to this film though.

Certain scientific plot devices seem to be skimmed over, as if the filmmakers feel too much thought in any one area is ""bad.""

There will always be a little of what I call ""Yeah right"" in any good disaster film. Any person with more than four functioning neurons will be able to point to a part in any end-of-the-world/city/state scenario, roll their eyes, and say, ""Yeah...riiiight.""

That's OK. That's part of the charm of big, dumb fun movies.

You just don't want to be thinking that too much or too often. Then ""dumb"" turns into ""stupid"".

On the other hand, the set of actors they have for this film is staggering! Had they focused on the crew and their interactions while in the drill-train-shuttle, we could have really had something here. They work wonders with what they're given.

And there ARE some genuinely exciting moments, as I forced myself to give in to this film. I love this sort of stuff; I just wanted it done a little better.

""Armageddon"", for all it's faults, is a big, dumb, fun film.

I've loved sci-fi films for years, and have seen nothing in the save-the-Earth genre for a long time that I've liked: mostly terrible movies, with patchwork scripts, and big stars brought in to make sure it sells to the unwary public.

This film has a great script, very good actors, well-rounded characters and a genuinely imaginative concept. Almost all of the usual Hollywood ''luffing'' is missing here. This is a smart film made by smart people---where the emphasis is on character and plot. Sci-fi mavens who complain about the science should go away and complain about the time-travel movies that abound out there, or Independence Day, or on and on. Sci-fi movies are not about giving you a science education, they are about using science in the service of fiction. By that standard this is a great movie: it knows its genre conventions, and wittily updates them. It is steeped in the save-the Earth flicks of the 50s, and understands its own relation to them.

This film gives you characters you can care about, and that you can believe in. Personally, I could have done without the whales---but they are a small blemish in a movie that does just about everything else right.

Stan Tucci is a very talented actor who plays his complex character very well, and even less established cast members do well, as this flick was well cast.  The biggest drawback in the film is the actual journey to the core.  Since there isn't too much to see there except a bubble with a bed of giant quartz crystals, the story presents a series of challenges and mishaps in which crew members must die.  The subplot with the hacker is a nice touch, and it is all too true to life that only an info leak spread by a computer geek could provide the real story about world events.  I would have liked for the story about ""Destiny"" to be developed more, as this seems to be what is most based on real science, as there is a real project in Alaska called HAARP that manipulates energy in the ionosphere and can be used defensively or offensively as a weapon.  There is also real science involving ""scalar"" wave electromagnetics that can create earthquakes.  Unfortunately, this movie is more about the special effects - disoriented birds crashing through thick glass and the Roman Collisseum shattering from an overload of electrical charge.

We are now in a ""decreasing"" mode.
It is true that cosmic rays will not be deflected by a weakened EM field but it will be nothing like a blowtorch hitting a peach (as described in the movie.) There might be more cancers and mutations over a period of centuries but absolutely nothing like what was shown in this movie.

1903580,4,B0000A5BSU,"I've noticed that a lot of people have blasted this DVD for lacking in scientific veracity.  Well, gosh, although I slept through Geology 101 in college, I'll bet there are little more than kernels of truth in what the story contends about the Earth's electromagnetic field.  However, I must ask the obvious $60,000 question to the vociferous critics of this movie:  WHAT did you expect, exactly?
If you want a natural disaster movie that isn't happy-go-lucky where everyone goes on a suicide mission and miracuously all come back, then this one is worth a look.  If you want a film with some eye-candy special effects, then look no further!
There have been a few movies /  cartoons in the past where an inventer would create a machine with a giant drill at the front end.  This contraption would take he and his crew to the center of the Earth, or at least far down.
In the present story the method of drilling is updated:  the ship uses lasers to blow its way through the Earth's mantle.  Is it believable?  Certainly not.  However, it is far more ""watchable"" than the giant drill-nose machine.
For myself, I did enjoy the allusion to Dante's DIVINE COMEDY.  The inventor of the ship names it the VIRGIL, after the Roman poet Publius Vergilius Maro. In the INFERNO it is the dead Virgil who leads Dante the Pilgrim through the lower depths of hell and up to the top of Mount Purgatory.  Nice touch.
The acting is decent, although I think they could have done better than the fellow they recruited to play the computer hacker nerd.  The highlight of the film is Hilary Swank.  She's certainly not hard on the eyes and also lends a nice feminine dynamic as the only non-male member of the crew.
All in all, this one is worth purchasing.  No, it's not scientifically accurate, but then again neither is Jules Verne's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (yet I don't hear people shooting that one down because of its lack of credible science).

Strange things begin happening and affecting living creatures seemingly at random.  If we didn't know the name of the movie we were watching, the possibilities could be limitless.  However, the story-line continues on in a challenging but somewhat believable evolving theory.  Top scientists and struggling scientists team together, analyze the problem, and go warp speed on creating a ""Fantastic Voyage"" on a global scale.  The special affects to this point are really fairly decent.  It's the voyage itself that taxes the imagination to bankrupcy.  I may have missed a scientific explanation or two but I could never figure out how the vehicle was actually able to sustain its' journey.  My 11 year old doesn't worry about such technicalities but I do.
The acting is fair to middling.  Everybody chosen for the journey seems to know each other which is, I guess, in keeping with the theme that it's a small world.  On the other hand, I shouldn't be too rough on a film that the whole family can watch together with at least some of them enjoying it.  If you have an 11 year old son who wants a DVD for his birthday, this is probably a reasonable choice.  After all, I could never get mine to watch ""Old Yeller"".",1079827200,2,1365,4.656903765690377

1903584,2,B0000A5BSU,"I love Sci fi movies and I truly appreciate how the digital and technological advances have served movie making in the last few years, helping to take the viewer to a level, that was in itself in the realm of science fiction..But one thing I love in a movie, is to forget that I am watching one, and be totally engaged in it regardless of the genre.
The Core, put simply, was unable to achieve this most basic requirement.
The problem with the film revolves mainly around two reasons,
The first are the digital effects.
Primarily their purpose is to take the viewer into a world of make believe,and dazzle and entertain him/her in the process. In the Core, I was constantly AWARE of these effects, time and time again, which tended to be overwhelming without being impressive. The ship looked like a cigar case, while the earth's insides looked like a computer generated goo.
Sci fi films of the past, and the first Star Wars is one very good example, became such hits by using comparatively speaking primitive effects (miniatures..), but their success was due to the fact that the viewer was so engaged in the film that he/she were either not aware of the technicalities of the sets/action or did not really care..This alas was absent from the Core.
The second reason behind The Core's failure in my opinion, was the emphasis on character. Let me explain..
If you watch the making of, the director and producer stress over and over again that their film is not merely effects but is character based as well,and much deeper than its genre would suggest.
I have a problem with that..Because on one hand there is nothing wrong with films (Sci fi/horror/action) who do not pretend to be deeper than they really are, but offer sheer escapist entertainment..There are countless excellent films that are actors based and are zillion years better.
On the other hand, watching the Core, and with lines like 'the world is destiny and the destiny is the world' you really wonder where on earth is this character based angle of the film? There are such similar lines in the film that gives you that nauseous feeling you have after eating too much cheese!
The actors who signed for the film are very good, especially Hilary Swank and Stanley Tucci(but his character came out more like a dandy bon vivant than the genius scientist he is supposed to be).
To be fair, and to give credit where credit is due, some of the effects, especially the crazed pigeons in Trafalgar Square were well done, but they seem so much like isolated scenes that do not make one whole movie.
The film could have been much better, with its simple story of a group of scientists trying to restart the rotation of earth electromagnetic field, and save the world, had digital effects been less in 'your face' and had the filmmakers not troubled themselves too much with their emphasis on characters,a nd taken themselves and their film less seriously ..but alas they did not, and as a result that Core is very shallow.",1078790400,2,2979,4.687022900763359

Unfortunately, it is too jokey and formulaic to generate much suspense, a necessary ingredient in this sub-genre.  What suspense is there when you have several hair-breadth escapes in which everyone escapes without a scratch?  And for all the director's emphasis on Characters, it is peopled with stereotypes.  The special effects are impressive but, being CGI, you don't see them interact with people (in the Rome sequence, for example, no one gets knocked down by flying debris; and why only one person on the Golden Gate bridge?) Though others have faulted the science, my problem is how they would be able to keep a lid on all this pre-apocalyptic destruction without anyone catching on (Art Bell anyone?).  My advice?  Dial your brain to LOW and enjoy.
The director's commentary is, by turns, awkward, boring, informative, and unintentionally hilarious.  A nice time-killer if you're bored, but no great insights here.
The MAKING OF documentary is only 11 minutes long, and also isn't very informative.
The VISUAL EFFECTS are also short, but I found them the most fascinating of all the special features.
The DELECTED SCENES are short (all about a minute or so each) and are all lumped together, apparently befitting their lack of importance.

The Core is a typical science fiction/action movie in that it is built off of some Hollywood formula that they have been using for years to make some quick and easy money off of the movie going public without, in fact, doing anything new or particularly interesting.  I wouldn't say that it is a bad movie, but neither would I say that it is particularly good.  I agree with some other reviewers in that the first part of the movie is quite good and raises your hopes that perhaps this movie is better than you thought and then they actually go on the mission to save the earth and it is cheeseball city down there.  It is way too easy to figure out who is going to die and how and figure out what is going to happen, which was disappointing, but that it why it is a 3 star movie and not anything higher!",1071187200,5,1610,4.515463917525773

The Earths core is no longer rotating and that means we are all going to fry unless some scientists can get together and develop a unit that can drill to the Earths core and launch a load of nukes to start the core spinning again.
Basically this is a B-MOVIE!.. and once you get that then it really does move along at a good pace. The story is character driven and the environments are pretty cool with lots of action along the way.

1903596,4,B0000A5BSU,"If you want to bring hard science to this party, you might as well stay home; The Core is just about the most unrealistic and unscientific Armageddon movie I've ever seen.  It is also riddled with all the clich&eacute;s you would expect to find in a movie of this sort.  Despite these faults, however, it can be an exciting ride if you decide to just go along with the storyline.  There is just something about this film that drew me in, although I am hard pressed to explain it.  Maybe it's the Jules Verne lover in my soul that enjoyed revisiting the center of the earth, although I hate to think what Verne would have thought of The Core.  Journey to the Center of the Earth is actually more believable than this special effects-laden thriller.
The opening scenes of this film are just fantastic, as the unusual camera perspectives we first see, when about three dozen people suddenly fall over dead in one localized area, instantly dip your toes into surreality; this scene doesn't even compare to the next one, though, as The Core goes Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds one better.  And then, in a scene that is robbed of a little of its power and spectacle by the very real loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, we witness the most spectacular emergency landing of all time.  These opening scenes really grab you by the collar and shake you a little bit.  Of course, it's all downhill from here, but in terms of entertainment value I still consider this to be a better than average end of the world story.  One great thing about The Core is the fact that the brilliant science guy who has to save the world is someone other than Jeff Goldblum for once.  Aaron Eckhart fills the role of Dr. Josh Keyes, humble science professor turned savior of the planet.  He figures out that the electromagnetic field around the planet has more than blown a fuse, and his discovery leads him to seek the counsel of Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci); Zimsky is your stereotypical great man of science who looks down on everyone around him, but he quickly comes to realize that Keyes is right: the earth's core has stopped spinning.  He also knows why, but that's classified information.  All life on earth will be gone within a year.  What can be done?  Luckily, the eccentric yet very likable Dr. Ed Brazelton has invented a machine that can tunnel through rock like it was melted butter.  In three months, the earth-digging ship (dubbed ""Virgil"") is built, a crew is put together (including space shuttle navigator Rebecca Childs, played by Hilary Swank), the world's biggest hacker nerd is called upon to keep the truth of the crisis away from the public (which is quite a job given some of the disastrous events that soon take place on earth), and we're off to the earth's core in order to kick-start the darned thing with the help of a few handy nuclear bombs.
Everything you expect to happen does in fact happen.  Some crew members do not make it home, those wacky scientists crack a number of stupid jokes or else criticize each other's work during crisis situations, everyone learns something about himself/herself, etc.  The dialogue serves to weaken the movie in a few places, but at least some of the clich&eacute;d moments are pulled off with at least a tinge of originality.  The special effects aren't that great once we get to the underground scenes where the ship is tunneling through rock, encountering empty space or mountains of crystal or diamonds, and luxuriating in the ultimate steam bath of liquid magma.  The underground effects pretty much had to rely on CGI, but I think some of the CGI effects could have been less obvious.
By and large, I really enjoyed watching The Core, but I am sure many people will not like it for all of the faults I was willing to accept in the interest of personal entertainment.  This movie runs well over two hours, so it can be a long haul for those who will react negatively to it.  It doesn't wait and pull the rug out from under you at the last minute, fortunately, as the implausibility of the whole thing comes through loud and clear early on; that's a good thing.  If those in doubt can lay their eyes on the trailer, I think that would do much to show prospective viewers whether they will be inclined to enjoy or merely scoff at the film.",1069718400,33,4286,4.588466579292267

With that said, The Core is not only full of movie logic, The Core is full of lame twists and turns that fall short of any enjoyable entertainment! While the special effects are fantastic, they cannot carry this film to quality movie status.

1903598,3,B0000A5BSU,"Some people rip this movie to pieces for various scientific implausibilities, I like to look at it as a two hour comic book, a good way to pass a rainy afternoon.
Yes, it is unlikely that a scientific loner working alone in the desert for 20 years on a shoestring budget could develop a miracle rock cutting laser drill and a miracle alloy(?) he calls Unobtainium, but it looked good on screen.
The silliest bits I saw in the whole plot were the three month construction time (three years would be super speedy),the crystal geode like cave miles down our heroes briefly get trapped in, the giant diamonds they collide with (in a flow of magma?, I 'd say the heat would destroy them)and that super X-Ray I guess they used to see their way to the core (three feet of lead from 50 feet away?, that kind of power in an X-Ray would kil anyone near it). That stuff still looked pretty good though and they were the worst of the effects.
I thought that the emergency shuttle landing in the L.A. river channel looked very good but hokey at the end, the disoriented birds in London scene looked real, the San Francisco and Rome scenes were good, Rome better.
I found the cause of the rotation failure to be interesting and as believable as anything in the movie (if stronger than likely reality). It turns out that there was an Us vs. Them(who were they?) arms race in which both sides built a planet damaging bomb, the other guys tested theirs first with disastrous results. I also liked the way Our leaders were going to save the day by setting their own bomb off, until the crew of the Virgil got word back to the staff hacker (who was supposed to hack the internet to keep the disaster secret)who then hacked into the bomb base and basically turned the lights off just in the nick of time.
Not a great movie, kind of like the old 50's stuff with better FX, and slow at times but I still say it's a good way to use up some spare time.",1068076800,3,1928,4.3434903047091415
1903599,2,B0000A5BSU,"A film by Jon Amiel
The Core stars Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Tcheky Karyo.  The previews made this movie look like Armageddon, only this time they go underground.  I wasn't too excited for it, but I started seeing reviews that said it was better than Armageddon (which despite the bad rap the movie later got, it was enjoyable the first time I saw it) and had more story and detail.  I thought that sounded okay and rented the movie.  It is just like Armageddon, and it wasn't better.
Even though I've already said that the movie is just like Armageddon, I'll give you the basic plot anyway.  Early in the movie strange things start happening: a bunch of people drop dead, the only connection is that they all had pace makers; animals start acting crazy, and the weather becomes erratic and unseasonal.  It turns out that the core of the planet has stopped spinning and the effects of this will be catastrophic.  I'll leave it the movie to explain the hows and whys of that.  What can be done?  The core must be restarted.  A character in the movie says that that is impossible because there is no machine/vehicle that can reach the Earth's core.  Oh, but there is.  The United States Government puts a team together to drill down to the Earth's core and try to restart it (unlike Armageddon, these men and women are actually scientists rather that oil riggers).
That's the movie in a nutshell.  The trip down to the Core plays eerily similar to Armageddon (up to and including a scene that looks exactly like the crash on the asteroid in Armageddon).  There is more scientific detail and explanation in the Core, and while I did appreciate that, the movie just became more and more unrealistic, and despite my acceptance of that fact, it made the movie hard to bear.  This is a disaster film, and with a disaster film you would imagine that the special effects would be impressive.  At least that would have helped the movie.  Unfortunately, the special effects were rather weak and in a couple of cases, a little cheesy.  Director Jon Amiel had some talented actors to work with, but unfortunately the movie was a failure.  It was not interesting, or visually striking, and was ultimately boring.  To borrow Roger Ebert's trademarked line: ""Thumbs way down.""",1068076800,,2263,4.681012658227848
1903600,3,B0000A5BSU,"Watches stop.  People with pacemakers drop dead.  Thousands of pigeons (and one fish) fly into things at Trafalgar Square.  All these things are symptoms of a greater problem.
One scientist consulted on one of these problems does a little data compilation and reaches a terrifying conclusion:  There is something wrong with the planet and we are all going to die.  He asks for help from a more public scientist (a back-stabbing plagiarist) and his fears are confirmed.  But military minds do not like defeat without a fight so they put every conceivable resource to bear on the problem.
We wind up with an expedition to the core of the planet for the purpose of setting off a pile of nukes in hope of getting the core to spin properly again.  Time is on the essence but gives way to billions of dollars and the expedition sets off.
We are then treated to some serious assaults on science as we find a geode the size of the Superdome, diamonds the size of Cape Cod (theorized to exist in planets the size of Jupiter), and a ship without power that somehow races to the surface.
The novelization was better as it did not suffer from the harsh editing.  For example, the film skips over the crucial problem that the instructions fro the nukes are in French and their Frenchman is dead.  The supposed change of heart in the plagiarist does not work when he says, ""Yes, this ship is yours, but I wish it could have been ours.""  It comes off as if he wanted credit for yet another discovery of someone else's.
All in all the movie is sort of like Armageddon with it's absurd science, but not quite as fun (space scenes a cooler than a shot of an uninteresting ship surrounded by red-orange whatever).

In this disaster film, a la Armageddon, scientists discover that the core of the earth has stopped spinning.  This will result in electromagnetic accidents that will eventually kill everyone and destroy the world.  The only way to fix it is to go 3000 miles into the center of the Earth and start the core spinning again.  How they were to accomplish making a ship that can accomplish this is less then three months will be a scientific unknown for years to come.  They only dedicated about 15 minutes of screen time to explaining it, so obviously the writers didn't seem to have an idea either.
I did enjoy this movie for it's action, special effects, and thrilling moments, but I can only suspend my disbelief so much.  It was all based on the fact that scientists appear to know exactly how the interior of the Earth works, which isn't necessarily true.  Also, scientific license was abused in this film as it was never adequately explained how the ship was made and how it was made so quickly.  Obviously that was secondary to the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge and the dig through the Mariana Trench.

Yep, it surely is...although I must admit, I do have a soft spot in my heart for this big budget flop-o-ramas, especially ones starring academy awards winning actors/actresses.  The caramel nougat center of this movie is the core of the Earth has stopped spinning, causing problems in the magnetic field that surrounds the Earth, keeping the dangerous microwave and other bits of space radiation at bay.  What caused the core of the Earth to stop spinning?  Who knows?  But I bet it was something we did...it's always something we did because if there is anything I've learned from Hollywood, it's that humans are a self destructive lot, and we're not happy unless we're cutting down trees, pollutin' the oceans, or tearing up the ozone.

Anyway, in a plot mostly lifted from a slightly less crummy movie (Armageddon), a special team of scientists is assembled to travel in a specialized ship, made of (get this) Unobtanium, to the center of the Earth and jump-start the now stalled core using nuclear weapons.  At a certain point in the movie (like five minutes in), you will have to turn the logical part of your brain off to be able to keep watching, as there are plot holes bigger than a house throughout the film.  I'm no geology whiz or an expert on physics as such, but I can tell when someone's trying to feed me a humungous, steaming pile of droppings, even if it's on a silver spoon, the silver spoon being all the high tech special effects, which looked good at first, but then became sort of cartoonish after awhile.

By about an hour into the movie, I was able to correctly guess who was going to live and who was going to die within the crew with such accuracy that I was tempted to go out and buy a lottery ticket.  Equally amazing was how I was able to almost predict the order and manner in which the deaths occurred.  After determining that I have no divine powers of prognostication, I aptly realized that the script was actually telegraphing all the information needed to come to the conclusions that I did.  If you are unable to discern who will bite it and who will survive, it's only because you've probably lost interest in the movie or are laughing so hard at all its' flaws and gaping holes that you missed said elements.  I mean really, the only way it could have been made more obvious was if a neon sign appeared next to the character saying, ""I'm going to die.""

So what happens?  Is the Earth saved?  Who survives?  Who dies?  Who cares...seriously, I felt all the actors did adequately well, but this turkey would have required nothing short of the hand of God for salvation.  My favorite scene, which isn't in the movie, was located in the Deleted Scenes section of the disc.  It involved the scientists witnessing a demonstration of a device that uses ultrasonic waves to pulverize rock.  The device, being rather small, made a pencil size hole in a rock, followed by a poof of smoke.  The one arrogant scientist then made a sarcastic statement about having to wear protective equipment for such a catastrophic event.  The character I liked the least was Rat, played by DJ Qualls.  He was the hacker supreme tasked with controlling all information regarding the catastrophic events caused by the loss of rotation of the Earths' core.  Your classical nerdy computer geek, he often referred to his skills as a hacker as his 'kung-fu', making such inane statements like, ""My kung-fu is strong.""  These attempts to make him an endearing character made me cringe, mostly because the movie offered little evidence that he was as good as he was supposed to be, creating programs and hacking sites and basically controlling information flow on the worldwide internet with relative ease.  A few keystrokes and he could access security of the highest levels.  If the Internet is as unsecured as it is in this movie, then we're all screwed.  Overall, while I understand these types of movies usually require a certain level of suspension of disbelief, this film asks way too much of its' viewers in that manner.  This movie is listed as a drama/sci-fi/action/thriller but really it's a fantasy.  If you keep that in mind going into this movie, you may derive more enjoyment out of it than I did, but I doubt it as it's derivate plot, clichs and total lack of scientific credibility are so painfully obvious and the whole thing is just so damn predictable.  The mantra in making this movie seems to have been 'If you can't intelligently work out a plot detail, just make something up'.

I do acknowledge that this film has the appearance of a more traditional movie, but seeing as how this is the 21st century, using certain methods used in the past to work through the plot doesn't hold water as it did in the past.  As our general knowledge increases through the myriad of outlets now available, we are generally more informed, and less likely to accept implausibilties as we were in the past in contemporary work such as this.",1067385600,16,5108,4.655518394648829

Yup, ""The Core"" is really that bad. So bad, that I was half expecting some stop action animated dinosaurs at the center of the earth as an explanation as to why the core had stopped rotating.

It's a great movie because it's what you want from a disaster movie, and has a tremendously talented cast.  Aaron Eckhart is marvelous as the heroic Joshua Keyes---not your typical matinee idol handsome, Eckhart has a masculine tenacity, a lot of sensitivity, and performs his role as if it were a Shakesperean oddyssey.  Eckhart is the heart of the film.  Stanley Tucci is appropriately snooty, self-serving and annoying, yet even he metamorphasizes into an almost hero.  It's to Tucci's credit that he pulls this one off so well.  D. J. Qualls as Rat is awesome in his nerdish role as the computer hacker supreme.  Alfre Woodard in a small role shows why she's such a good supporting actress.  Delroy Lindo is great as the shy, soft-spoken inventor who finally breaks loose in a dramatic scenario.  Hilary Swank doesn't posit the ""I'm an Oscar winner...let me steal this movie.""  She fills her role admirably and shows no signs of prima-donna hysterics.  Richard Jenkins and Bruce Greenwood fill out this cast.
I liked this movie a lot, as it reminded me of those great old disaster movies like ""Towering Inferno"" and ""Posiedon Adventure.""  The effects, particularly of the birds going wacky in Trafalgar Square, are great.  See if you can find the trout which was included as an inside joke by director Amiel.

I wasn't going to rent this one at all but I thought the special effects looked pretty good. I was very surprised by this movie, first of all I was right, the special effects are fantastic.
The story is simple, we (humans/Americans) figure out that there is something wrong with the Earth. There is an abnormal problem with the natural magnetic field of the planet and it's going to destroy us. After some running around, and scientist doing this and that as scientist do, they figure out that the planets core has stopped spinning. But why? Hmmmm...so they devise a plan to fix it or everyone dies. Delroy Lindo is great as a mad scientist who has been out in the desert for the past decade doing mad scientist things and now is called upon to save the world. The acting is good; the special effects are great. I believe if you are a fan of the global disaster films (Armageddon, Deep Impact) you will definitely enjoy this one. If not for the fact that it's a disaster film then the special effects will dazzle you! The story line is so-so half way believable but not really but I think the actors, the effects and cities blowing up make up for it!",1066262400,2,1280,4.359832635983263

Even the space shuttle has a problem.  They must suddenly touchdown in Los Angeles.  The Los Angeles River that is.  A space shuttle pilot and a professor and others in a probe-like craft must go inside the Earth and reach the core to fix the problem.  If the core should stop, the results would be horrific...death.  Total fantasy of couse, but might be fun to watch.  DVD includes deleted scenes and extended scenes.",1066176000,2,703,4.552

All over the world strange things are happening that apparently have no explanation.  A college professor, Dr. Joshua Keyes, discovers that the core of the Earth has stopped spinning causing numerous problems all over the world that will eventually destroy mankind.  The government puts together a team of experts to go down into the Earth's core with several megatons of nuclear weapons and shock the core into spinning again.  This is a pretty good movie if you can get past the fact that the story is utterly ridiculous.  The characters are all pretty well developed, the action scenes are very good, and it is fun to see a computer generated image of what the middle of the Earth looks like.  The story is very similar to Armageddon, some scenes are almost identical, but overall The Core is much better.
  The Core boasts an excellent ensemble cast that makes the movie much better overall.  Aaron Eckhart is very good as Dr. Joshua Keyes, the man who discovers what is going on.  Hilary Swank is okay as the copilot of the ship, but overall I found her character kind of annoying.  Delroy Lindo and Stanley Tucci are both excellent as battling scientists who have had a falling out in the past, but now must put aside their differences and work together.  The movie also stars Bruce Greenwood, Tcheky Karyo, and Alfre Woodward, all in good roles.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, commentary by the director, trailers, and 10 deleted/extended scenes, some of which are very good.

I could stop there, but I won't. Even if you make every reasonable concession of logic to the plotlines of The Core, you will be forced to do one of two things about an hour into this fantasy - turn off your brain or turn off the DVD player. Those are your choices; be prepared to pick one.
I went with option A and as it turns out, without worrying about air, heat, a fictitious compound called ""unobtanium,"" placing explosive pods to within an inch of a specified location in the middle of a swirling mass of magma, finding a volcanic current from the Earth's core to the ocean floor with no turns a 50-foot vessel couldn't make, and the general public's childlike acceptance of ten of the most catastrophic natural disasters in the planet's recorded history happening simultaneously as coincidence, The Core isn't really all that bad a flick.

1903637,2,B0000A5BSU,"How I looked forward to this movie!
A friend talked me out of seeing it in the theater, and because I couldn't find the time I didn't see it in the theater.
But, since I'm a huge fan of disaster movies I was waiting for it to be released on DVD, and what a disappointment it was.
When are we going to get more great disaster movies? I mean, for instance I love earthquake movies, but how many earthquake movies are made? I only know 2 great ones, and 2 made for tv.
And finally in the 90s the disaster-movie made a come-back, and what do we get? only 2 meteor-movies (armageddon/deep impact) and 2 volcano-movies (volcano/dante's peak).
And now this poor excuse for a disaster-movie.
The script was too corny, and unrealistic that the movie couldn't convince you; that along with the poor acting, resulted in making absolutely no convincing impression on anybody.
Where were the great disasters?? In the beginning a handfull of people just dropped dead for no apparent reason, well, way to go; a few minutes later birds flew against buildings; hardly a disaster either.
And then there's a whole lot of boring talk about the happenings, which is so corny and simple that it isn't very convincing, and gives you the idea that your watching a 50s SF-movie (although a lot of those 50s movies are way better than this one).
And then, after almost an hour, finally something 'big' happens again. Rome gets destoyed, by lightning. Well, better watch it in slow-motion because this scene is so short, you'll miss it if you blink.
You'll see some lightning hit a couple of buildings, a street is ripped apart by lightning, and suddenly the colloseum blows up; that's it, and then suddenly you'll see a wide-shot of Rome on the news, being levelled with the ground.
Hardly convincing, why didn't they show more of the explosions or destoyings? One street, 2 buildings, and the whole city is ground zero? very cheap.
Then they bore you 45 minutes with the so called heroes, going to the core of the earth, but besides the fact that this is really boring because it doesn't hold up by a long shot, the sfx are also poor. The view in the cockpit looks like a cheap computergame image.
After 45 minutes under ground, and 90 minutes in total of the movie, there's finally a scene right here back ON earth.
I was hoping this would make it up, but.....no.
A beam of light hits San Francisco making the bay-water boil, and then the beam hits the golden gate bridge.
You'll only see, 1 person sitting in his car, burning his arm which is hanging outside his window, then the bridge starts to melt, a steel wire hits the car with the person in it, and the bridge collapses. You'll see other cars, you hear people scream, but you just DON'T SEE ANYONE.
During that whole scene, you only see this one person is his car. Where are the people panicing and screaming? And again, don't blink, otherwise you'll miss it, this scene takes perhaps 30 seconds.
After that, you still have to see 40 minutes of saving the earth in a boring and amateuristic way, that really makes you hope the annoying characters don't make it.
As I already said, it was very unrealistic. Their ship that would travel to the earth by beaming away the earth-crust with lasers? oh, brother, gimme a break! The empty space within the earth, with the crystals? Hardly believable, I mean with the pressure of the thick crust surrounding it, I can hardly believe that there is an empty space within the earth.
And another thing that really annoyed me; what about reactions of the people here on earth?
Everything was hush-hush, about the core not rotating anymore, causing the ""disasters"" with the birds, Rome and Frisco.
But if the whole world doesn't know about this, don't they think it's a little bit odd, that a city is destroyed by lightning? Where are the people demanding for an explination?
The DVD is also lacking; you'll see some 3 minutes scenes of the making of the 3 disasters, well maybe it didn't take them much longer to create them, and where are the trailers?
cheap DVD,  cheap, boring, amateuristic, waste-of-time movie.
Stay away from it!
And Hollywood; when are you going to make a REAL disaster movie again? With lots of destroying, people and cities in panic etcetera? We don't care about the heroes saving the world, if we're going to a disaster-movie we wan't to see a disaster, and not a 145 minute-movie with in total 2 minutes of disasters happening in it. That is, if you can call these scenes disasters.

1903640,2,B0000A5BSU,"As I have said before, one key to a great thriller is to get the audience to suspend disbelief. After such a movie is over, you might think back on how illogical or improbably it all was. You might even watch it again to see how the filmmakers tricked you into buying the plot. Likewise, great action-adventure movies [especially those with great special effects] are such a thrill ride that you overlook or forgive ludicrous characters, inane dialog and comic script construction. For me, ""The Core"" failed as either a thriller or as escapist entertainment.
The movie's title refers to the earth's core - the vast cauldron of molten rock that lies a few miles underneath our planet's surface. As the film starts, random electromagnetic storms are happening all over the world. It turns out that the core is starting to stop spinning, and if man doesn't do something quickly, the planet is toast. As luck would have it, a scientist has invented a ship that can bore through to the core, and it's up to a stalwart [American, of course!] crew to get on board this craft and SAVE THE PLANET!
Admittedly, this story line is no dumber than that of ""Armageddon"" or ""Independence Day"", but here the special effects are, at best, cheesy and the actors seem especially embarrassed to have taken roles in which the pay checks, rather than the performances, are what's important. Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci and others completely waste their time and ours.

However, this type of ""the end of the world is coming so let's get a crew of scientists together to save the world"" film has been done many, many, many times before.
The story is mainly about how the earth is losing it's electromagnetic field due to the fact that the outer layer of the earth's core has stopped moving around the inner core (there is a lot of scientific jargon in the film that explains all of this). So a group of scientists go to the earth's core and try to jumpstart the outer core into moving again. Because of the wearing away of the electromagnetic field, the earth is prone to the radioactive particles, gases, etc. from space that will ultimately turn the earth into one big fireball.
There are many scenes of destruction and the obligatory widdling away of the crew due to various methods of death. Then there is the climactic scene where the surviving members achieve success and head home.
I'm not saying that ""The Core"" is a bad film, but it's something that we've all seen before and I can't say that it's that interesting that it's a must-see. Make the decision yourself. You could really love it or you could not think too much of it.",1064448000,,1328,4.424489795918367

If you have ever taken a science class at all seriously, or watched a Discovery channel special, you will be sorely disappointed in whomever was the scientific advisor for this film.
This movie was a huge disappointment, because watching it you could feel how much better the movie could have been if they chose to keep to the facts instead of trying to wow the audience with cheesy CGI horrors that seemed to only target landmarks and leave everything else alone.
Side note: humans can do many things despite pain if they are determined, but if a human being dies when its internal temperature hits around 120 degrees, and you have a fancy-schmancy suit that will protect you up to 4000 degrees, do you really think ANYONE could walk and think in an 8000 degree tunnel while said suit is melting off?

But, sadly, the Core fails to deliver on any level on which a movie-goer can attempt to find a foothold of enjoyment. It's best moments are pale imitiations of Bruckheimer's kinetic pacing (I'm not endorsing it, merely bringing it up for comparison) and Spielberg's technique du jour (both visually and in storytelling). Great. If you need a crutch, you could be relying upon some less talented (successful) folks. I'm thinking, we still might be able to cobble together a passable diversion here. Come on script, acting and directing, come on, I know you can hold steady there and deliver. I just know it.
So sorry! Nope! Not even remotely. Halfway through the movie, we were rooting for the core. Come on core, blow someone up. Come on core, roast that limp one-dimensional fruit cake alive. Come on core, defy the humans, pump out another sapien-hating geode and kill us all. My fiancee (who is far more 'movie-forgiving' than I) got up halfway through the Core and started to fold socks. She was arranging our undergarments as opposed to watching the Core! Stupendous! Damaging!
There are vague attempts at explaining what is happening to the earth's core, but they are half-hearted Cliff's Notes versions, using pseudo-science to explain pseudo-science. Not very satisfying. The characters have no dimension whatsoever (zero-dimensional?), the situations are completely outlandish, and the plot twists and devices are so opportunistic and played that you can see them a-bubbling long before they erupt on screen.
A for-instance of cinemeatic ineptitiude: the crack team of geologists and weapons experts (?) have landed on the militarily-controlled oil platform that houses the Core exploring ship thing. The evening is rainy and wet. The mission is to start the next morning. Upon exiting the helicopter, our crack team of misfits is standing upon 'top deck' of the platform, in the rain, bemoaning their chances, mourning the loss of old earth, blah blah blah. Question: where are the guards? The coordinators? How are our team (and Earth's last chance) to find their rooms? They are alone on top of a government run oil-derrick in a typhoon, with no guards, no coordinators, not even an intern with a clipboard to feebly offer a, ""This way, please."" Nope! Just five actors standing in the rain, offering up some shallow platitiudes. You know, if I were housing the world's last chance at salvation, I would at least make sure they didn't get colds. Not on my watch, buddy.
Unless you really want to stay on top of special effects, or really, really thought Twister was a great movie, stay away from the Core. Do not give the folks that made this stink-biscuit your money!

Firstly, I don't think that the technical aspects are so laughable.  Why wouldn't we be able to go to the Earth's core?  I am not a scientist by any means, but if we are determined to do something, what could stop us?  Besides, if you are focused on the technicalities during the entire movie, you might be watching it for the wrong reasons.
Although all of the actors are fabulous, Aaron Eckhart completely outshines the rest with his impeccable portrayal of Doctor Joshua Keyes, a witty college professor.
One of the really refreshing things about this movie is the fact that there is hardly any romance.  Some slight flirtation in the beginning, yes, but it never leads to anything significant.  I am a hopeless romantic, but sometimes even I get sick of romance in movies.  It's nice to see one with just action, suspense, and humor.
The DVD features are very good.  Special effects are broken down, deleted scenes are shown (great stuff), and there is a commentary from director Jon Amiel.
Once again, I have to say that this movie is depreciated far too much.  Watch it once and see how you like it.",1063411200,9,1376,4.672199170124482

There is never a point where you fear that the ""good guys"" might fail because everything happens their way.
It would be like watching Apollo 13 and, when the carbon dioxide levels are getting too high in the ship, Tom Hanks would pull a replacement filter out of his pocket that he just happened to bring along. Stupid doesn't even begin to describe the plot of this movie; I found myself wishing the planet WOULD explode just to end the storyline.

As good an introduction to this film as you're likely to get.  This science fiction/natural disaster movie was a very pleasant surprise!  It's about an intrepid group of super-scientists who take a fantastic voyage to the Earth's molten core, in order to prevent global catastrophe.  Y'see, it seems the lava inside the planet has stopped spinning for some reason, causing all of nature to go haywire, and threatens our very existence. Which is very bad.  So, the US government assembles a scrappy little Scooby team, and off they go, to die one-by-one and make heroic sacrifices as they meet their dates with Destiny.  This flick was pretty fun & funny in a complete-suspension-of-disbelief kinda way... It doesn't take itself too seriously, and thus never flounders by trying to make everything seem ""real."" In fact, the humor (which draws on some great, casual one-liners and fine performances all around, particularly the laconic, good-natured college professor, played by Aaron Eckhart) skillfully disarms us to the special effects sequences are all the more enjoyable.

1903661,4,B0000A5BSU,"Looking back on this year in movies, I have come to realize that most of the Hollywood Blockbusters, be it the Oscar Contenders or the plethora of multi-million dollar Summer films have gotten very......serious. Just look at the attitudes of some of the films this year. The comic-book movies have all taken their characters almost too tragic, be it Ang Lee's surprisingly good, yet serious look on the Hulk and Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil. The Matrix took a serious turn in the sequel. Even Finding Nemo was more serious in tone than any Pixar film in their history. Why is it that movies this year have gotten so serious all of a sudden compared to the summer of fun in 2002 (with the likes of Spider-Man and Star Wars Episode II). True, the quality is better this year than last, but they are less fun. Normally, I would ridicule a film like The Core for being an exercise in CGI brainlessness, but I realized something after watching it twice, at least it was fun. From an effective beginning that gets you hooked into what was to come next to a conclusion that gets more ludicrous the further down it goes, The Core is not so much about CG effects (mainly because you can't really imagine anything interesting about lava outside of what melts in it) but the characters going into the mouth of madness. Aaron Eckhart is an effective leading man, with eyes aglow at what he is seeing and doing. Hillary Swank does all she can with her character. But stand-outs in this film come from the least-seen characters; D.J. Qualls (whose character could fill a whole movie in himself) and Tchecky Kiaro, who has some of the best lines in the movie. Jon Amiel's signature is all over this, taking a ludicrous situation and making it fun all the same. This is a film that rightfully places itself in that long lost era of sci-fi disaster film tradition last best-seen in Independence Day and The Day the Earth Stood Still. And by all means makes my list of one of the Good-Time Movies of 2003.",1063152000,,1990,4.57703081232493
1903662,4,B0000A5BSU,"Make no mistake The Core isn't science fiction. In fact, the little bit of science it has in it is closer to fantasy than fact. The Core has more in common with Journey to the Center of the Earth than with The Posideon Adventure or Earthquake!. At its (pardon the pun)core is the spirit of adventure.
The planet's core has stopped rotating. That's bad news because the electromagnetic field generated by the spinning core protects us from harmful microwave radiation and temperatures that make those in the Sahara seem like a spa. Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) has discovered this due to a fluke. He passes along the information to a world famous scientist with an ego the size of the Titanic (and just as flawed I might add).
This scientist (deliciously played by the talented Stanley Tucci)is alarmed enough to contact the government agencies he works with. Suddenly Keyes is pulled in to work on a project to literally jump start the planet's magnetic core using nuclear devices. Otherwise, all life on Earth will be dead within a year leaving behind charred, burned desolate corpse of a world.
An inventor (well played with humor by Delroy Lindo)has come up with a new compound that actually increases its strength the more pressure it is exposed to. It can also withstand molten temperatures. A crew of 6 is selected to make this perilous journey with a very good chance that none of them will come back.
Certainly you have to suspend your disbelief. The Core stands in fine company as a theatrical roller coaster ride. The optical effects are generally outstanding. Director Jon Amiel indicated in interviews that he wanted to recreate the awe he felt when he saw films like War of the Worlds and Journey to the Center of the Earth. He manages to do so. This isn't Shakesphere but the entire cast plays their roles with humor and bring their respective characters to life.

1903684,5,B0000A5BSU,"And as the narrative stated, 'what if we could?'! I read so much about this movie before it was released, so much negative press and so many amusing articles about the stupid movie physics of the story, and finally when I took my wife to see it we both had a whale of a time! In the story, the Earth's core stops rotating and it seems the only way to restart it, to prevent natural disasters getting worse, is to drill down there using a special ship and a crew of 'terranauts', and don't forget that ultrasonic laser dril! In the crew are a NASA astronaut played by Hilary Swank who brings down a shuttle in spectacular fashion and is assigned to the VIRGIL(as this drilling ship is named), Dr Conrad Zimsky(played by Stanley Tucci who really hams it up well when Zimsky's character flips!), a nerdy computer hacker named Rat(DJ Qualls) who has to instigate a massive worldwide cover-up to prevent worldwide panic and main man Aaron Eckhart as Dr Joshua Keyes who warns the authorities of impending doom. They naturaly misunderstand at first, until they meet Ed Brazzleton(played by Delroy Lindo), a reclusive genius who designed the laser drill and the special ship. The SFX are what really makes this one worth watching - lots of variety of underground rock formations and plenty of lava, a magnetic storm destroying Rome in a scene which looked awesome on the big screen, pigeons attacking tourists in London, San Franscisco's Golden Gate Bridge collapsing, and a suspenseful little underwater segment! And the ending is not what you might expect. Less overblown than say, VOLCANO or ARMAGEDDON and with a story much more intent on diving straight into the action with the right amount of character development(Keyes and Zimsky most notably), no unnecessary romantic subplots getting in the way(thankfully) and a mixture of tongue-in-cheek fun and genuinely exciting moments, THE CORE definitely delivers the goods.

1903685,3,B0000A5BSU,"This movie has been resoundingly trashed by many observers. Still I thought the premise exciting, so I went, expecting that almost anything might come of it. One valid criticism is in the way that invalid science is invoked in in the premise and the plot's playing out. For example, the Earth's core could not suddenly stop rotating and then be started rotating suddenly again without conservation of angular momentum causing a marked change in the rotation of the rest of the Earth, giving the Earth's surface a cataclysmic jolt both times. Also solid diamonds, and especially geodes, almost certainly could not exist deep in the Earth's mantle. And the point at which travelers to the core re-emerge to the ocean floor is said to be at a tectonic plate boundary near Hawaii. But actually, Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific plate, not near a plate boundary. And the substance from which the craft is built, ostensibly capable of surviving conditions deep within the Earth all the way to the core, has its properties demonstrated when a mouse survives inside a box thereof, while laser beams destroy ordinary metal all around. But that gives no indication as to how the vehicle to built can have windows, but it does. Some say these problems don't matter, but really they should not be passed off as irrelevant. That is because the movie has the tone of serious science-fiction, and immerses its events into a good deal of talk based in real science. The film is not a sci-fi spoof like EVOLUTION or a fantasy like LORD OF THE RINGS or HARRY POTTER. Therefore the CORE should pay serious attention to how it grounds itself in some real science, and not let things degenerate from there into complete nonsense.
Nonetheless, I was postiively impressed by much of the adventure in this movie, so that its breaks with real science didn't completely undermine its entertainment value. Some of its performers were so surprisingly good compared to other recent roles as to help make the movie a pleasant surprise. Hilary Swank was so much better than in INSOMNIA, DJ Qualls was so much better than in THE NEW GUY, and Bruce Greenwood was so much better than in DOUBLE JEOPARDY. Not that their previous lackluster performances were particularly there own faults; perhaps those movies gave them relatively little to work with. Still, seeing them shine in THE CORE was a definitely a plus.
But perhaps the one biggest problem with THE CORE, and my reason for giving it only 3 rather than 4 stars, is the disappointing ending. Not to give away too much, but the film ends rather abruptly, leaving an ambiguity, about which perhaps we're expected to suppose an outcome. But I thought it needed to act out an ending more clearly. If you see it, you should know what I mean, but I'll give no more away.",1055808000,5,2793,4.748971193415638

Lots of boring cliches here, too -- nerdy kid computer genius (who has a remarkably ugly nose by the way), unethical scientist who knows something everybody else doesn't, fish-out-of-water good guy suddenly conscripted to save the day, good black guy who dies.  Plus, famous landmarks get destroyed!  The only part of the movie that worked for me was the opening scene, where pigeons go nuts because of some disturbance in the Earth's electromagnetic field and start crashing into everything.

1903687,3,B0000A5BSU,"""The Core"" is nothing but fun, I know, but as the cast is very  impressive and the company is Hollywood major studio Paramount Pictures (the one renowned for ""Star Trek"" series), I expected pretty much from the film.  This sci-fi film is not so bad as critics might find.  Only too familiar, that is the problem.
The opening part is very effectively spooky, thanks to the director Jon Amiel (""Copycat"").  Strange things start to happen all over the world -- one of them is re-enactment of Hitchcock nightmare -- and scientists are assembled to investigate the case.  The truth behind the disasters turns out something not very encouraging; the inner core of the earth has stopped moving, and the world as we know is to meet the end very soon.
So the story starts well, but soon becomes something very familiar, like the updated fashion of ""The Jorney to the Center of the World.""  The scientific theory is replaced by the uninspired ideas, and when the crew of the subterranean ship ""Virgil"" is gathered, we know that instead of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, we see such faces as Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Delroy Lindo, Tcheky Karyo, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Greenwood (whose previous film was most appropriately the submarime film ""Below"".)  Well, the cast is not bad, though.
Nevertheless, the film gradually shows the lack of any kind of  originality, and if you have seen ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact,"" you can predict every twist in the storyline.  Sure, somebody must go, and during the comparatively long running time of the film, some cities must go, too.  The underground scenes are realized pretty good CGIs, but you cannot deny the fact that those scenes also somehow betray the limits of our imagimation, while we are looking closely at them.  Because no one has ever seen the core of the earth, the visuals have to rely on our own creativity.  So, I thought, these images could have been much more surprising and even wilder, but strangely, the visuals look as if telling the film takes itself too seriously.
The main trouble with the film is not, however, those parts.  The cast, especially Swank and Eckhart both talented professionals, look miscast in the role they are playing.  They look neither enthusiastic nor cool as the hero and heroine of the film which requires the wit of Indie Jones or the dedication of Ripley.  Only Stanley Tucci convinces us as the pompous doctor, breathing life into cardboard character. And ""The Core"" uses some ideas that might make you sigh at some points, and some players are typecast.  See, for example, D.J. Qualls (the geeky guy in ""Road Trip"") cast as a computer wiz.  I guess he deserves much different types of roles, but the studio would probably listen.

I was ready to bail at this point, because it was just too ridiculous. The fact that the actors played it with poker faces made it even more absurd.  There is never any sense of danger because the lead actors take it all in stride as just another day at the office.

Although playing a bit of Motown might have solved the problem, it's decided to send a team of terranauts to the Earth's core in hopes of jumpstarting it with a series of nuclear bombs. Jon Amiel's entertaining flick is a bit light on the science (although more plausable than Journey to the Center of the Earth)but a nice update on the classic disaster/sci-fi flick that was standard fare during the 50's and early 60's. Playing like an entertaining cross between Fantastic Voyage and Journey, it has all the right elements for a light disaster flick.
The optical effects range from very good to astonishing (I was less impressed with the collapse of the Golden Gate Bridge than the destruction of Rome). Some of the science is accurate and works but there's enough credibility holes to drive a truck through.  I do have to disagree with Roland Zwick's review about the time spent in the confines of the ship as it burrows to the core; the confined, claustrophoic setting works in favor of the film. Also, Amiel has a ""b story"" that looks at the effects of the disaster on the surface of the Earth. The performances are quite good as well with Stanley Tucchi and Bruce Greenwood virtually stealing their scenes from the stars of the picture. Greenwood is a marvelous actor whose potential has not been realized by movie directors (with few exceptions). Tucchi plays the gloryhound physics professor and National Security Advisor role to the hilt; he also manages to invest some interesting character touches in what might otherwise have been a one dimensional role.
Amiel stated that his purpose was to do an update on films like Fantastic Voyage and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Those films managed to overcome many of their b-movie cliches through the strong performances and effects work in each film. Amiel has achieved his purpose with this entertaining (if overlong)and tongue-in-cheek disaster film. There are many that have attacked the film as contrived and cliched without realizing that Amiel is playing with those very conventions of the genre.
The Core entertains without stretching the scientific truth too much. Amiel has managed to breathe new life into a genre that sunk due to the bloated hyperdirection of films like Armageddon.

It is also one of the best earth-shattering thrillers since 1998's blockbuster, ""Armageddon""! On another note, ""The Core"" was supposed to come out on Nov. 1 of last year, but got pushed up to March 28 due to better special effects, and man, it was worth the wait! The special effects of ""The Core"" was outstanding from start to finish! Directed with sheer intensity by Jon Amiel (""Entrapment"", ""Copycat""), ""The Core"" stars the explosive talents of Aaron Eckhart (""Possession""), Hilary Swank (""Insomnia""), Delroy Lindo (""Get Shorty""), Stanley Tucci (""Maid in Manhattan""), D.J. Qualls (""The New Guy""), Tcheky Karyo (""Wing Commander""), Richard Jenkins (""Changing Lanes""), Bruce Greenwood (""Double Jeopardy""), and Alfre Woodard (""Star Trek: First Contact"") in their finest performances ever!
""The Core"" turns the attention to a geophysics professor named Josh Keyes (Eckhart), who is called by the government in order to investigate some strange goings-on in the Earth. And sure enough, the Earth's core has stopped spinning, causing, for example, birds to destroy a neighborhood in England, the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco and the Colosseum in Rome being destroyed, and the space shuttle 'Endeavour' being forced to make a crash landing. During the movie, Josh enlists the help of a Carl Sagan-like celebrity named Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Tucci) in order to find a solution for the problem. The solution: To go into the center of the Earth with some nuclear weapons and give the core a jumpstart...or everyone on earth is dead within a year. For the mission, a team is selected, including Josh, Dr. Zimsky, Major Rebecca ""Beck"" Childs (Swank), from the salvaged space shuttle, Dr. Serge Leveque (Karyo), French scientist and Josh's best friend, Commander Robert Iverson (Greenwood), Beck's mentor/shuttle commander, Taz ""Rat"" Finch (Qualls), a young computer hacker, and Dr. Edward ""Braz"" Brazzelton (Lindo), a reclusive scientist and Zimsky's former colleague. Brazzelton has developed a weapon that will cut a hole into a giant rock in a matter of seconds, etc. Much to the approval of everyone, the weapon is placed onto a ship that is designed to tunnel into the earth, etc. The lives of many will depend on a team of scientists and astronauts, dubbed ""terranauts"", as they take on the biggest challenge of their lives as they go on a white-knuckle voyage into...the core!
In conclusion, ""The Core"" has it all! An outstanding cast (hey, even Tucci's character is fun to hate!), powerful storytelling, action, suspense, and special effects that will keep you on the edge of your seat! 50% ""Armageddon"" + 50% ""Deep Impact"" = 100% pure excitement! ""The Core"" is not better than ""Armageddon"", but it is better than 1998's other blockbuster, ""Deep Impact""! Yet, ""The Core"" is just as effective as ""Armageddon"".

In an act of desperation, the United States government comes up with a plan to fund the building of a special vehicle that will be able to break through the thousands of miles of rock comprising the crust and the mantle in order to detonate some nuclear explosives in the hope of getting the core spinning again.
""The Core"" might have been a decently entertaining ""bad"" movie did it not suffer from one fatal structural flaw - which is that, once the capsule is ""launched,"" we are as trapped inside the plummeting vehicle as the hapless scientists chosen for the mission.  At least in ""Fantastic Voyage"" the microscopic crew got to meander through the human body.  There's at least a little variety in that domain.  But here in the center of the earth there's little else but rocks, rocks and more rocks (with a little molten lava thrown in for good measure) for the crew to keep plowing its way through.  This might not have been so bad did the film not drone on for 136 dreary minutes.  To fill up that time we are subjected to oodles of mind-numbing pseudo-scientific jargon, internecine squabbling among the characters, cartoon heroics, jejune philosophizing and cheesy special effects that look like a bad ""laserium"" show from the 1970's.  The best moment of unintentional hilarity comes early on in the film when science professor Dr. Josh Keyes, in a scene that looks as if it were pulled straight out of the war room sequence in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" gives a stoned-faced lesson in 6th grade science (explaining the four components of the earth's interior) to a roomful of astonished high level government officials. ...",1050105600,8,2285,4.901554404145077
1903706,5,B0000A5BSU,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Someone somewhere else said you'll either hate it or love it, and you can see by the reviews that's truly the case. This movie had just the right mix of sci-fi fantasy that required minimal thought, and there was no gratuitous sex, violence, foul language. It was your basic joy ride.  I personally don't want to spend all my time watching movies that require thought or reflection or serve as metaphors for cultural differences or make some type of political or artsy statement. This movie didn't try to be anything else but what it was - a good sci-fi flick. Yes, the cast is terrific - especially Stanley Tucci - and the concept was unrealistic - so what? - but the film was well-made, well-meaning, and well-done. I will definitely purchase this movie, just so I can escape reality once in a while and have some plain ol' fun.",1050019200,3,850,4.555555555555555
1903707,3,B0000A5BSU,"Let's make one thing absolutely clear here: you do not go to see a movie like ""The Core"" expecting to see high level film-making like ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane"".  Heck, you don't even go expecting to see something on the level of ""Enemy of the State"" or ""Crimson Tide"".  A movie like ""The Core"" falls firmly in that campy genre known as the 'disaster' film.  Hollywood became enamored with and perfected the formula for the disaster film in the early 1970's, with such movies like the ""Airport"" series, ""Poseidon Adventure"", ""The Swarm"", and just about any film involving George Kennedy.  The past decade has shown a resurgence in this genre with ""Twister"" in the 1996, the dueling 'volcano' movies in 1997, and the dueling 'asteroid hits the Earth' movies in 1998.  ""The Core"" is just the latest in a long line of movies to fill that genre.

""The Core"" comes complete with all the elements that make a disaster film work.  It has the hammy, over-the-top acting.  It has the cheesy, yet somewhat compelling, special effects.  It has the feeling of impending doom looming over a group of people (or the entire world) if a motley group of heroes can't achieve their goal.  Finally, it is entertaining.  As ""The Core"" possesses all of these characteristics, there are worse ways to spend two hours and a few bucks than on this movie.

The plot, such as it is, of ""The Core"" centers around the impending destruction of the Earth as a result of one of the military's nefarious experiments. It seems there is this project called ""Project Destiny"" which is designed to create earthquakes anywhere in the world at any time to destroy the U.S.'s enemies. Alas, the experimentation with this project has caused the Earth's core to stop rotating. As a result, the magnetic field around the planet that protects the us from the Sun's harmful rays is slowly disappearing, leading to the eventual 'roasting' of the entire planet. Of course, there's a desperate plan that can save the planet before the final disaster strikes. It seems that there is a reclusive scientist who has developed a material that withstand the pressures and heat of the interior of the Earth. The material is called, of course, ""Unobtanium"", which is a science-fiction parlance for any material that is needed to have magical properties that allow the plot to progress. In this case, a ship is built from this material with the goal of going to the center of the early and setting off nuclear bombs to 'restart' the core.

The plot sounds pretty preposterous, and it is. Also, don't try to develop an understanding of real science based on this movie. The motley group assigned to go on this mission is your typical band of stereotypical movie types. The actors chew scenery faster than the ship chews up earth. Yet, there is no denying the fact that this movie is fun to watch. No matter how ludicrous the premise, bad the acting or flimsy the plot, any film that you can come out of and say ""That was a fun movie"" is worthy of a recommendation. ""The Core"" is one of those kinds of movies.",1049932800,2,3058,4.6934579439252335
1903708,3,B0000A5BSU,"My partner loves disaster movies, so when we first saw the trailers for <em>The Core</em> I knew we were going to see it opening night.  If it's got a volcano, an earthquake, a killer asteroid, she's there.  Even better if it's named for one of these catastrophes.  She and I weren't disappointed.
The premise of <em>The Core</em> is that the natural engine that creates the Earth's EM field, the spinning liquid outer core of the earth, has stopped spinning.  As the EM field degrades the earth experiences escalating effects, from northern lights down south, to intense microwave bombardments, which will eventually toast the surface.  The challenge is to find a way to give the core a jumpstart, within less than a year.
Forgive the science of the movie, like you would that of Star Trek or a comic book.  Just accept it, and that some things work the way that they work because it makes a good, fun story.
Enjoy the characters that are just a hair beyond two-dimensions.  Revel in the somewhat predictable transofrmations and developments.
Feel the anticipation as the movie flirts with not making a Hollywood ending.
Don't expect great f/x or excellent camera work.  The first are decent, the second is more reminiscent of television.
Have fun.  <em>The Core</em> is good.",1049760000,2,1277,4.902325581395349

It was worth the wait!!
I loved it! It was funny, exciting, thrilling, and overall fun! Hillary Swank was perfect, and Aaron Eckhart was great, Stanley Tucci was also fun to hate. The special effects are amazing! Go see it and you will love it! You never take your eyes off the screen. Its totally riviting! I'm going to buy the DVD they day it comes. Go see it! Its entertaining and amazing!
It was written and directed style. The cast was so perfect.

I like all the movies but my favorite is Deep Impact and I thought The Core would be some what like that. However, The Core was ok it had nice special affects my husband really liked the movie and it did have it's moments sad moments. No movie isn't the same without that. Then there was this big bang disaster kind of thing. But it didn't have enough of it as it should have. I mean there were a few of them but just not enough. For a moment there were scene's that looked like it would be scary and it was but then at the same time it wasn't it was just lacking so much more it seemed to me. I believe that the people who made this movie should have put more thought into it. But it was ok. It wasn't boring it was interesting. Some parts in the movie made me a bit teary eyed but that was it. All I can say is if you like natural disaster movies like I do then by all means watch the movie. If not then don't waste your time or money at the movies just wait until it comes out on pay per view or on video to rent it. As I said before my husband liked the movie so I have a feeling that we might own it to add to our collection when it comes out on video.",1049068800,4,1272,3.8773946360153255

Yes, you have to suspend reality a little, but you have to do that for ALL movies, especially sci-fi action movies.  The dialog was humurous in places, no knee-slapping jokes, but chuckles were definitely had, and delighted chuckles at that!

The special effects showing the storms and destruction on the surface were good, but I thought that the effects below the surface were more interesting. The characters were real for the most part (there was one part where, instead of explaining or defending herself, Hillary Swank's character just stared) and made the story interesting.

All in all, this movie worked for me.  I'll be pre-ordering it on DVD as soon as I can.",1049068800,4,763,4.883720930232558

1903713,3,B0000A5BSU,"The advance reviews of Jon Amiel's CORE were terrible so I had rather low expectations that ranged from special effects, to dialogue, to plausibility.  I was pleasantly surprised that CORE delivered in the critical areas that a disaster movie is supposed to.  The opening scene of birds flying amuck brought back some twitching memories of Daphne Dumorier's THE BIRDS.  Other vignettes of geological and meteorological minor catastrophes well prepared me for the initial premise that would destroy the earth: that the spinning core of the planet's molten center had--well--stopped spinning, thus destabilizing the earth's magnetic fields and exposing humanity to the full force of incoming cosmic radiation.  Now, even though I had no previous awareness that the core rotates, I could accept that it might stop.  The so-called cheesy special effects were not cheesy at all.  The lightning bolts ripping apart the Colloseum in Rome looked real enough. Further, the images seen through the drill ship's camera of the earth's core reminded me in a wacky way of the sights and sounds experienced by James Mason and Pat Boone as they also headed down towards the center of the earth in the film of the same name.  Having a lovely female terranaut-scientist aboard brough back an image of Raquel Welch from FANTASTIC VOYAGE.  To carp over the unlikelihood of humanity's being able to build a drill ship in three months is to miss the point.  As the terranauts drilled their way down to the core to restart its rotation, I found that I actually cared about their collective fates.  The ability of the audience to do that is what separates impure dreck from its more pure cousin that CORE certainly is.  CORE is not a great movie, nor is it even a very good one, but is is good enough to be the latest update of a colorized 1950s B movie about the end of this world.",1048982400,7,1858,4.829652996845426
1903714,1,B0000A5BSU,"Was this film any good??  No.  Though starting off well enough, it was pretty bad as a whole.  Actually it was quite stupid, with ignorant science that was very unrealistic.  The movie had way too many conveniences in it, all explained away with ridiculous scientific stupidity that wouldn't fool a ten year old.  Credible, hardly! When being spoon fed dribble about indestructible materials called ""unobtanium""...yes, you read it correctly...that actually gets stronger under greater pressure and can transform energy to fuel (or something ridiculous like that), we are then expected to believe that this incredible new experimental ship gets fully completed and ready to go in three months!  How convenient, eh?  Just when the people of Earth just HAPPEN to need a device like this made from a material like this!  Perhaps it was divine intervention????
The lack of destruction scenes really annoyed me.  We got a few good shots of lightning striking all over Rome culminating in the destruction of the Coliseum, then it suddenly switches to an entirely destroyed city!  The same with California, the Golden Gate Bridge melts and suddenly it switches to a news report of all California being fried while showing scenes of an already destroyed city!  By the way, if the sun's harmful rays could melt a bridge like the Golden Gate, why did it not harm any of the cars or the people in them.  One man's arm got burned when he stuck it out the window.  That is it, nothing more!  The bird sequence early in the film was silly also.  Since when can crazed birds (the electro-magnetic field makes them go crazy and attack people???) actually bust windows?  Panes of glass are thick and birds smacking into them will not break them unless they (the birds) are literally made of stone or something!  What a cop out for a supposed disaster epic!
The special effects were mediocre at best.  The few destruction scenes we are treated to were handled adequately, but nothing nearly as impressive as disaster films of the past have presented us with.  I never got past the fact that the Space Shuttle was very computer generated looking, ruining any real sense of danger during the crash landing sequence.  The shuttle soaring over the city simply never looked RIGHT at all, though the actual crash was well executed.  The Earth's core was silly looking and may have WOWED me ten years ago, but not these days.  I expect more in the 21st century, but actually got MORE in the 20th century!

I would have almost forgiven the movie's shortcomings when it looked like all the main characters would have to die to save the planet.  But no, at the last minute they come up with a thoughtlessly mind numbing idea on how to get the surviving cast out of the Earth's core, in a fraction of the time it took them to get in to boot!  Can't a film ever have the courage to sacrifice everyone to save the planet?  I wanted the filmmakers behind DEEP IMPACT to have the courage to actually let the second comet strike the Earth, while mankind survived in the caves till the Earth was habitable again.  They did not have the courage to do that either, but rather saved the day at the last minute!  A bittersweet ending, would that shock me and make me respect the filmmaker??  Yes.  Did this movie (or any of the other disaster flicks for that matter) take the chance and actually DARE to do that?  Of course not!
The cast did a good job with what was given to them, but even their superior acting skills could not save this mess.  Every time a team member dies, there was intense emotion, followed minutes later by a casual ""OK, lets get on with the mission"" attitude.  Unbelievable to be sure, laughable definitely!  The complete lapses in logic completely ruined my enjoyment of this film.  Some may accept it as ""dumb fun"", but I refuse to be treated as a brainless movie-goer who doesn't deserve to be treated as though I have some intelligence.  Hollywood, I expect more, but you never seem to deliver anymore!  CGI whales, take me away!",1048982400,7,4018,4.680456490727532
1903715,3,B0000A5BSU,"When I first saw the trailers for this picture about a year ago, I thought: this is going to be such a dumb movie. However, after several weeks of not attending a cinema and with all the heavy conflict going on in the Middle East as I write this, I wanted to go see a big dumb movie.

THE CORE is a big dumb movie. Sure it has a fairly impressive cast of mostly unknowns (Hillary Swank and Stanley Tucci withstanding) who do a remarkable job given the poor dialogue and bullet-ridden script; some great scenes on disaster; and a very subtle lesson of morality. Nevertheless, it's still a big dumb movie.

For most of the story, the movie feels like a miniature POSEIDON ADVENTURE beneath the Earth, with characters dying left and right to save their comrades so that they can fulfill the mission and save humanity. Of course, then the audience is reminded that it doesn't really matter if everyone dies because in this film (like in ARMAGEDDON) the crew is out to save humanity and not themselves. Therefore, the movie is best described as a cross between THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and ARMAGEDDON.

As a sidenote, believe it or not, the movie did make me think about something. I found it interesting that two cities annihilated in the movie (I'm not giving anything away that the trailers don't) are Rome and San Francisco. Rome was once the city of decadence and San Francisco has become America's own Gomorra. Were the filmmakers trying to imply anything by that or was it just a calculated fluke?

Unless you're completely new to disaster films (or films in general, for that matter), you should know exactly how this one's going to go.  The Core is a mix of Armageddon and Deep Impact.
The casting is the best part about the Core.  The cast is brilliant, led by Aaron Eckart (Possession) and Hilary Swank (Insomnia).  But it's the supporting actors that steal the show in this one.  In that list would be Bruce Greenwood (Below), Delroy Lindo (Heist) and Stanley Tucci (Maid in Manhattan, Big Trouble), who really makes this one good.
