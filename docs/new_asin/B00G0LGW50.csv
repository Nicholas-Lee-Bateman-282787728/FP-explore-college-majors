6042405,4,B00G0LGW50,"This collection has all the Miyazaki films I knew of as well as several others I had never encountered. The picture quality is good, considering some of the films are older cartoons. If anything, I have two minor grievances. First, the films are in full screen only. Second, English dubs aren't available for all the films. While there are English subs for every film, it would be nice to have the option. Regardless, this is a wonderful box set and the price makes up for any issues when compared to the American releases.",1310083200,11,523,4.634408602150538
6042406,5,B00G0LGW50,"This is a real Studio Ghibli boxed set (not licensed, but copies of the originals). This is not for people who have high resolution players or TV's as they will come across VERY granular. For crisp and clear video, you will want to purchase official and licensed Ghibli DVD adn BluRays, but some of these titels are NOT available at this time.

I was wary when I ordered it, but I am extremely pleased with the product. It is a 4 DVD boxed set of many films that are lesser known (except to true fans) and some that may never see solo DVD status. If you are a fan of Hayao Miyazaki, this is a must have for your collection! Sold separately, these movies would fetch hundreds of dollars. Some you will never be able to find. This is a truly amazing set!

The review by Vin B has all the specific information you will need to know about the set in his WONDERFUL details. He is 100% correct about everything! This set is also from Animedia Entertainment, a known anime distributor, out of Kuala Lumpur.",1306108800,33,999,4.365591397849462
6042407,5,B00G0LGW50,"This is an imported collection not released in the US. The seal on it says official version approved by the Malaysian government.

There are no extras and the movies are not high def, but than some of these films have not been released in high def anywhere yet so that's not really an issue. They are standard DVD quality.

At least half the films have an English dub, the rest only have English subtitles, but that's basically because these are not the US versions of the films, they are the original without Disney remastering. It should be noted #17 is not a full length film, it is a musical video/short film from the same director.

Anyway, as long as you are paying under $100 (at the time I write this there are several sellers in the $100 to $200 range) than you are saving money. If you just bought the films individually that are available in the US you would be paying over $100 anyway, so if you can get them in one set along with the extra Asian only released films, than it's worth it.

If you like all the bonus material that Disney adds to their versions, skip this, but you will be paying at least double the price and you will have to wait a few years for several of these films are not scheduled for US release any time soon.

Someone else commented that he thinks this is a bootleg and I want to mention: Disney is the US licensed distributor for Studio Ghibli, but they are NOT always the distributor for the rest of the world, in Japan the films are released by Toho, in other countries this varies. The set I received was from Animedia (and I have several other good quality DVD imports from Animedia). So just because it is not from Disney does not make it bootleg. This is definitely an imported version and not the Disney release, but I don't think it's bootleg.

I adore it, it comes with the original audio, and the dub, all the subtitles we could hope for and every Ghibli movie I loved. Fabulous way to enjoy the perfect worlds Miyazaki created.

6042411,3,B00G0LGW50,"It is a bootleg, quite sadly as I put this on my birthday list not realizing it. When I saw a media company I didn't recognize I became suspicious, upon seeing Malaysia I knew they had struck again with watchable pirated anime. The only reason this gets 3 stars is because I know there are those who don't mind it being pirated and it makes it good for marathoning. Just really wish it was legit and that my mom's money hadn't gone to a Malaysian anime pirate.",1527984000,,460,4.2988505747126435
6042412,5,B00G0LGW50,"This collection is great. A bootleg but a good bootleg both audio and video are great. Not sure why reviews are all low. All discs work and have both Japanese and English audio as well as subtitles. The people complaining must be real A/V snobs. A person who just enjoys films will get hours of enjoyment out of this. I was on the fence because of the reviews, so glad I purchased this.",1527897600,,386,4.301369863013699

6042415,5,B00G0LGW50,My whole family loves these treasured movies and now I get to share them with my children! We also got this collection for the reason that it has the old dubbing for Totoro because the new dubbing just isn't what it should be.,1527638400,,226,4.27906976744186

Video has washed-out or water color look, where details are noticibly smeared, as if the lens had Vaseline smeared on different parts (if it were filmed).

6042431,5,B00G0LGW50,Super awesome! The box art is really nice and it came with 17 movies. The movies have their English sub/dub tracks and also their Japanese tracks. It also has English subtitles but it doesn't fully match up to the english tracks. The subtitles phrased things differently sometimes.,1524009600,4,281,5.0
6042432,2,B00G0LGW50,"For the price, it's really nice to have all these movies. That being said, the quality of video and audio IS NOT what I expected. I expected 720p from a DVD, but it seems to be around 360p. And the audio just seems faint. If it weren't for subtitles, I wouldn't be able to understand half of what was said. There are a lot of 5-star reviews, so maybe I'm just unlucky and got some bad copies, but it really takes away from the magic of these beautiful animations when you can hardly make out what the characters look like. Not to mention the setting that they are in. This set really doesn't do these movies any justice. Hope this review helps anyone considering buying this set.",1523923200,,679,4.354330708661418

6042435,1,B00G0LGW50,"Received as a gift years ago. It came in a plastic dvd case (the size for ONE movie) containing 6 discs that all looked the same, with different names on them. the case was broken to begin with, but broke more recently again when i wanted to lend it to a friend. ended up moving the 6 discs into a sims 2 case (the big bulky tall ones.)
theyre not in good quality at all, only have subtitles for the japanese audio track, and are very obviously a bootleg.
otherwise, i love having all the movies in one case i can easily lend to friends or watch them myself.",1522540800,,558,4.128440366972477
6042436,5,B00G0LGW50,"I'm a little surprised by the reviews since my set was great. Totoro has the normal dubbing from the fox family version from years and years ago. The Disney version is the fanning sisters and for nostalgia reasons.. doesn't sound right so I'm glad they have the fox version. The subtitles are off but the movie is dubbed in English sooooo.. not really a problem for me. Every single movie worked! Also, it's not HD but I like it to look more like the movies I grew up with then it looking more computerized like the newer anime movies. So all in all.. great buy.

6042441,2,B00G0LGW50,"This same box set can be purchased for a fifth of the price on Ebay. Buyer beware, it will work on a computer/laptop, but will not work on a standard DVD player. Mine is not Blu-Ray, but I assume it would not play on there as well. It is a bootleg. A very well put together bootleg as far as presentation goes, but a bootleg. Multiple films are on the save DVD so the video quality is poor. Subs are poor on some films, so avid sub watchers or hard of hearing people (such as myself) be in for a bit of guesswork or reference to what you remember (assuming you've seen it before). For 65 dollars? A complete and total ripoff. For the 14$ you can get it for on Ebay? A pretty good deal.

6042442,1,B00G0LGW50,"I purchased this year's ago for $100 when it was new from Hong Kong (which is notorious for ignoring copyright laws) and not all the movies were available on DVD in the US at the time...in addition to the fact I still had a 4:3 36"" Tube TV so I can honestly say that even on such a system over 10 years ago...it was crappy then and even worse now upconverted to 1080p & 4K, extremely pixalated, especially with all motion / movement, and having a base knowledge of Japanese plus having watched numerous Japanese films / series since 1991, I can say this is the 2nd worst subtitle translation I've ever seen second only to Negima live action when they finally release a version that was not the 3 boxes w no subtitles which currently run for @ 400 Euro each to get all 26 episodes of which the prerelease DV on had 25 missing a episode but calling it the complete series...but that's another review...

With the 2018 release of My Neighbors the Yamadas on BD all the movies in this set are now on DVD or BD / DVD combo pack, which many times the BD's are on sale for $15 USD. Yes it would be about $180 + Applicable Taxes & Shipping, but it's 100x better than this box set.

If you don't care about video quality nor subtitle accuracy nor disc menu issues...which bit be honest, bad dubs & subs ruin the context and intent of a movie/tv show, and want something cheap then this is a good buy...

If you care about quality and enjoying the films as intended by the Studio Ghibli creators then I would suggest spending the extra $$$ for the Blu-rays...or even the official US DVDs (even in my circle I know a number of friends who don't own a BD player in this day & age...)",1518307200,,1671,4.264984227129338

So far all of my movies play with no real problems, except for spirited away it is choppy and skips a few scenes, which is very irritating as it was the first studio ghibli film I had ever seen so its got a lot of sentimental value to me. There are no special features in case you are interested in that and some of the movies are a bit grainy. But it is a good deal for the amount of movies you get.",1510876800,,520,4.058252427184466

Packaging :
The disc set box was in perfect conditions and was professionally prepared. My only complain is that some of the disc were not treated carefully and you can see some scratches and blemishes on the back of the DVDs.
I played each disc and skipped through each movie to make sure they all worked fine.

First off yes, it is a bootleg but a well made one... in my opinion of course.

Pixelation issues only affect it if you have a oversized TV (Say 40 inch or higher as it plays fine on my 32) on the three movies i have watched. (Loputa, Spirited Away, and Grave of the Fireflies.)

Bad subtitles, a few of them are just in reverse order (Ex: ""We have to go to Loputa Sheeta! You promised we would!"" for the subtitles, where it was actually said ""Sheeta...! You promised we'd go together!"")

I still say it'd be better to get originals if you can, but this is a good alternative if you want every single one of the Studio Ghibli Movies from 2013 and I surely say it is worth a try!",1419552000,8,873,4.209580838323354

6042574,2,B00G0LGW50,"The quality is certainly not HD, but I'm not a picky person, so it only bothers me a little when I watch these on a 60"" screen and the action scenes or fast moving scenes are pixelized.  A few of the films are more pixelized than others and my theory is because they are cramming 2-3 long movies onto 1 disk in order to save space and money on packaging.  In order to do so, they must lower the quality of the films.  I think the ""best"" quality ones, on my disks, are Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away.  The worst quality ones on my disks are From Up On Poppy Hill and Nausicaa of The Valley of The Wind... Which is sad because Nausicaa is such a beautifully illustrated movie...  It feels bit of a waste to have it so pixelized.  On the positive side, the price you pay for 17 movies is a steal.  You do get the quality you pay for though... I personally am not unhappy, but I don't think most people would be happy with this product, especially if you have seen these films in their full glory.  *IF YOU ARE BUYING THESE TO WATCH FOR THE FIRST TIME, PLEASE DO YOURSELF THE FAVOR OF WATCHING THEM IN HD FIRST.*  Thank you for reading my long review",1417737600,23,1154,4.162162162162162

Several reviews indicated that the packaging looked homemade and that the DVD's themselves appeared to have been manufactured by illegal means but I could find nothing wrong with any of it.  It was very professional:  DVD's had professional imprinting not homemade.  It is not impossible that even though the movies were made by different companies (they all have Studio Ghibli in common) Ghibli could have arranged it so they could sell them as a package deal.  I am very pleased with my purchase and with the speed in which they delivered such an excellent product.
Lesser reviews seriously undermine the quality of the product and I do believe they may have a bad experience I also do not believe for one minute that what those few individuals went through is anywhere the norm for this company.",1408924800,3,883,4.707792207792208

Considering the killer price that you get for seventeen amazing movies, I would say that this is a must buy.

People complained about the video quality, I don't know why. I'm a snob about picture quality, I've got 1080p blu-ray all that and really these discs look phenomenal, also given the age of some of these films they hold up quite well and it gives them more charm knowing that their not enhanced in any way.  The casing for these kind of sucked, and I noticed some people dropped the stars for this reason which is just ridiculous.  Great Seller, Great Movies. The subtitles are a little off on all the movies, meaning what they are saying the text below doesn't always translate right, but I think it's kind of humorous to see the translation.",1406246400,,782,4.492957746478873

6042624,5,B00G0LGW50,"Just the movies, but every film is great and in good quality. I found it odd that the version of Kiki's Delivery Service is the older version I used to watch as a child. I have another DVD copy that was altered to be more like the Japanese version. Now, I own both versions. Strangely enough, Castle in the Sky in this collection was changed from the original version I used to watch. *edit* Now that I know this is not an official release, I can see why the versions are different. Had I looked and found this out, I wouldn't have bought it.

The English captions are only direct translations of the Japanese audio, which can be quite different from the English dub. As an example, in My Neighbor Totoro, in one version a character says something akin to, ""It's all her fault,"" while in the other version she says, ""It's all my fault.""

It came one week before the scheduled delivery date (nice little surprise) and the box came with all that was advertised, and all disks in one case. Each disk has about 3 movies on each one, but all they have are the movies... no special features provided except for the language and subtitle settings. So all in all you get what you asked for, just the actual films. There is no scene selection setting, but I don't think its that much of a problem since whenever I watch a Miyazaki film I watch the whole movie at once. The quality was better than what was provided with other reviews (Note: I had only played about the first five minutes of Spirited Away to check the quality) and it seemed to work perfectly, though very slightly less quality as a single dvd case would be. A good thing to know before you go buying this is to know I used this on a 90 inch Samsung television with a 2013 dvd player, so I was not sure if that effected the quality.

Since it's a large collection of discs, I didn't realize the problem was widespread until months after I purchased and it is now too late to return.

There is nothing more frustrating than a technical error in the middle of a movie you are enjoying!

Now to be clear: I work in film and video, and I'm accustomed to the shortcomings of DVDs. They can definitely have issues when they get scratched. But theses discs are brand new! First time out of the case, and I'm getting major playback issues. I also have many types of DVD/BluRay/Computer drives at hand to test discs in, so I'm pretty confident it's not a problem on my end: even just trying to make a copy of the disc to my computer has failed.

I can only think that this collection has been poorly authored. And judging from some of the other reviews, it seems likely this is a nice looking bootleg of these films. If you want these movies to be good quality (or play at all) I would avoid this collection.",1399248000,,1096,4.47

6042644,4,B00G0LGW50,I really like this set. The only problem is that a couple of the movies have some sound issues where the volume goes low after a few minutes into the movie but the movies are still watchable.,1398470400,,191,4.1891891891891895
6042645,5,B00G0LGW50,I'm glad I found this. I really enjoy the Studio Ghibli movies. I would highly recommend this to anyone. The quality is pretty good and the cost is fair.,1398124800,,153,4.310344827586207

6042651,5,B00G0LGW50,"This is one of the best deals on Amazon. 17 movies for $32.00 after shipping and tax?! You can't beat that! Some may say that I am not a loyal fan for buying this collection as it is not official, but are you really going to spend over $300 to buy all 17 movies individually? I love Studio Ghibli and have since I was younger when I first saw Kiki's Delivery Service as a child, however, I will not put a dent in my bank account for a movie collection. I agree with some other reviews that the quality is a little shotty, especially on a bigger flat screen tv, but all the movies I have watched so far work perfectly, with two audio and subtitle options. If you are a snob about watching dubbed movies, then never fear because the Japanese audio works fine. Then again, if you are that much of a snob, you probably wouldn't buy this in the first place. I would recommend this for sure!",1396483200,,885,4.211764705882353

This set contains a buttload of movies, and has all of my personal favorites. My only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner. Just lent it to my cousin who moved back from Japan :)",1396051200,,281,4.320754716981132
6042655,2,B00G0LGW50,"Just received this and started digging around in the DVDs... As others have complained, this is *not* a licensed Studio Ghibli product. In fact, it's not even a particularly good bootleg. The DVDs are amateurishly mastered; this means the DVDs internal labeling structure is screwed up, in some cases the wrong subtitles were included, language codes are often incorrect, etc. Worst of all, the original videos were ripped at reduced bitrate MPEG2 (the video codec used in DVDs) in order to make 2-3 videos fit on a single dual-layer DVD. Unlike modern MPEG4-based codecs, MPEG2 doesn't handle reduced bitrate gracefully at all, meaning there is a direct and noticeable impact on visual clarity. To put it plainly, the video quality is horrible. People saying the video quality is flawless either have very poor quality screens, eye problems, or are simply speaking out of ignorance. The raw audio was extracted from the original DVDs, however, so that at least is lossless and will sound exactly like the real licensed product. Which, by the way, you should be buying instead of this knockoff.

I realize this box set is much cheaper than buying all of the real Studio Ghibli videos one at a time, and there's some appeal there. But the difference in quality alone is worth it, not to mention the special features, and the fact that you're not buying pirated media. Don't kid yourself, that's exactly what this is.",1396051200,370,1415,4.920502092050209

After receiving the item I can honestly say that it is one of the best purchases I've made on amazon. The quality of the outer sleeve is impressive for a ""bootlegged"" DVD, and the DVD's themselves come exactly as advertised on the image. Each disk has a picture of the films on that disc. Note that the outer sleeve and movie images on the discs only come with the 17 movie collection. The quality of the films are great for the amount of movies your receiving, and the price. I've watched them on my 40"" TV and they look great for a pirated collection of films. My only complaint is that the DVD case was broken on the inside, so two discs were loose. Also the last disc which has ,Arriety and Poppy Hill, does experience some minor glitching in the early scenes. Lastly the quality of the audio in some films can become a little pitchy. Nothing too terrible or unbearable, and easily overlooked knowing the amount of films your getting and the price your paying. Highly recommended!",1394236800,3,1135,4.514563106796117

6042676,4,B00G0LGW50,"My kids (ages 4 and 7) loved the movie Ponyo and The Secret  World of Arrietty so much that we started looking for other movies by Miyazak, or that he made a contribution to. When I ran across this set, I figured we couldn't go wrong, especially for the price. I am not sure about it being a bootleg or not as other reviewers are complaining about. But from the description from the seller I bought it from, the Sarawak Media Corporation who produces the was licensed.

We haven't watched all of the titles on this yet, but for the most part the ones that have been watched are pretty good. I looked at the Titles on IMDB, and just about everyone of them has at least a 7 of 10 rating or even higher!

The one thing I wished they had was a description of each movie so we could get an idea of what they were about before we started watching them, So thanks to IMDB, I decided to make a title list with a brief summary of each movie.  All I did was copy and paste, so if there is something spelled wrong, or incorrect, I am not responsible.  Enjoy!

So far, I have watched Mononoke, Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, The Cat Returns, Spirited Away, and Ponyo (from discs 2,3,4, and 5). These have worked so far. I was watching Mononoke when it got stuck, but that was due to my bad TV/DVD player. It worked fine on my computer. The cover art is nice, the DVDs are in a compact DVD case, but are not too squished, and the video and audio play nicely. By no means are they blu-ray quality, but they are pretty high quality. Only thing is that you have to turn the subtitles off every time.

EDIT: A later extension to my original post: I just watched Arrietty on disc 6 and it pixelated some. Not severely enough to be completely unable to watch, but it did still glitch up at least 4 times. It was the very first time I even took the DVD out of its case to watch it. The DVD surface has visible scuffs on it. I have written a message back to the sellers and will see what they do.

6042709,3,B00G0LGW50,"I have almost all these movies on Disney DVD-s and Blu-Rays. I do not think it's an exagerration if I say the difference in video quality between these DVD-s and the ones released by Disney is as distant as the quality of Disney DVD-s compared to the Disney Blu-Rays. I believe the deciding factor will be the size of your TV: for small screens (I am refering to portable Car DVD players) these cartoons will look good. For 40-50 inch TV-s, you might get a headache: I watched these DVD-s and compared them to the Disney version, and it looks like movements (especially when there are a lot of them) are accompanied by additional pixelation, and/or short stops between the movements. If someone is walking in the picture, it is not a smooth walk (like in the Disney DVD), but a walk full of short stops (& flickers) - that make it harder to watch. Transitions are not smooth, and even image stills are in lower quality than the Disney versions. After all, this set of 17 movies on 6 DVD-s have at least 2 movies (in mpeg-2 format) per DVD, compared to just 1 for the individual Disney releases.",1390867200,3,1094,4.475

I originally had doubts about quality or the legitimacy of this product,

the movie quality is about equal to that of the normal DVD versions of each movie.
(not 1080p for sure but about 720p) I would say
I like the disc art, and the box sleeve

6042724,5,B00G0LGW50,"I bought these and watched every disk this weekend. The pictures were perfect, no issues with picture or sound at all. The disks are coded with art and looks very professional. If they are bootlegs, who cares they work-PERFECT. In my opinion Disney, who charges over $100 to go to their theme park and Fox, who airs the worst news crap on the planet can kiss my bootleg in the disk. I support the life of hard knocks, over worked, underpaid, and drowning the corporate army with my freedom to purchase from small business retailers.

I have separate copies of My Neighbor Toronto and Ponyo but I wanted the whole collection, however, the prices for one are just highway robbery for one disk. I was a bit skeptical upon purchase reading the other bad reviews, but every disk works great.  There is an option for subtitles in English or you can just put the language in English.

Very happy with this purchase, truly a gem, I will watch with my kids for years to come.",1389571200,6,966,4.508571428571429

6042730,4,B00G0LGW50,"My family loves all things Ghibli, so this box set was perfect. I had read all of the reviews posted about the collection before hand and had some reservations about buying it at first. Especially when I read the first couple of reviews saying not to buy because these had to be pirated versions because no one studio owns all the titles, but we found the over seas versions just as good as the ones released here in the States only without 15 minutes with of ads at the beginning of the movies. The only problem that we have come across is Howl's Moving Castle only plays to Chapter 18 then the disc is unable to be read on our Xbox, PS3 or a DVD player, but overall a great collection for the price.",1389139200,2,701,4.2388059701492535
6042731,4,B00G0LGW50,"So I read the reviews that these were pirated and at first decided to not purchase it. Studio Ghibli then had a 50% off sale on their blu-rays which I STILL couldn't afford, and only reinvigorated my desire to own the collection. That, and my girlfriend LOVES these movies even more than me. Whatever the case, the quality of these dvds is certainly not bad. I do have a couple of the blu-rays for comparison, and obviously there are differences in quality. This set costs like a tenth of the blu-ray collection, but the quality is closer to 60-70% rather than the 10% you might expect based on price. The subtitles are not ALWAYS perfect but if you just want a dose of Miyazaki Magic this is the best bang for your buck.",1388966400,3,721,4.428571428571429

An unusually sensitive perception of the natural world in the animation--you will identify the plants--they are not ""generic"".  A loving and sympathetically humorous appreciation of the various stages of childhood and an awareness of the challenges at each stage.  If you like one, you will likely like most of them.  Good at the quest/challenge/adventure material (but then, many can do this adequately).  What sets Studio Ghibli apart is the humane and grounded spirit that manages to be part of the adventure.

That being said the video quality isn't as good as the originals, I gave this box set to my nieces and nephews and they love it

During heavy action scenes you may notice slight pixilation, i tried it on different dvd players and I noticed a improvement when played on a expensive blueray player vs the $20 one in my bedroom. When played on my computer With good video playback software it filters all of that crap out and looks fine.

Its a very good deal for all the movies, I paid between $10 and $25 a piece for them, but like I said they aren't perfect copies. BUT for $20 some dollars it isn't bad, I watch allot of anime online so im used to mediocre video quality, but it did bug a few people I tried watching them with.

I will say this if you buy this and end up falling in love with it please buy legit copies, Piracy hurts the anime industry, especially in america. The anime industry in america needs all the support it can get",1388793600,37,1007,4.175257731958763

But I was concerned by claims by two reviewers that the dvds were pirated and defective. First, I do not think the contents are pirated, though I am not sure exactly where they come from. English dubbed versions seem to contain the Disney voice actors. But, at least for "" Kikki's Delivery Service,"" the set uses digital copies of the Japanese version of the film (distinguishable by Japanese characters on a sign). To me this is a bonus. Also a huge plus meriting six stars is the absence of ad tracks, copyright warnings, and other junk that hijacks the player and delays the start of the program. Second, I checked each film on each disk. They all seem ok except for ""Tales from Earthsea,"" which contains significant and prolonged episodes of pixilation when viewed on a standard DVD player. There was no problem when tested on an Apple laptop. My system and needs are pretty primitive, and I will keep the defective set because I am happy to have what I think are 16 trouble free films at a reasonable price.

Do you really think legally licensed Ghibli films that typically sell for around $20 individually would somehow legally sell 17 films for $30? Nope. Furthermore the official US licenses of various Ghibli films are owned by different companies (Fox Video, Disney...) and there's no way they would collaborate to such a fashion to sell such a compilation for so cheap. Even if you try to argue that they somehow have a legal Malaysian license, they don't. If you search for them all you'll get is a small set of results on sites they (illegaly) sell like Amazon; you won't get any results about Sarawak Media Corporation's own website...because they have none because they are a business that sells illegal bootlegs.

I noticed the audio cutting in and out and switching from 5.1 or stereo while watching it, this only happened a few times.  The quality seems to be normal for dvd's.

That said, I got this for like 30 bucks, and that is an amazing deal considering that these movies are sooo ridiculously overpriced individually.  The Blu Ray version of these movies go for 30-40+ dollars a piece, which is total BS in my opinion.  I definitely recommend this, but don't spend 1 or 200 bucks on this like some people are saying, there are plenty of 30ish dollar copies out there if you look.

6042795,4,B00G0LGW50,"This is a legit box set that has been approved for distribution by the Malaysian government. If you are wondering how they could fit 18 movies (it's really 17 since 'On your mark' is a short) in this set, it's because 3 of the discs are DVD-9 and the 4th disc is the only DVD-5 with the movie 'Ponyo'.You get all of studio ghibli's masterpieces (excluding 'My Neighbors the Yamadas' and 'Arriety' which has yet to be released in North America) all of which are instant classics and are some of THE BEST animated films ever created.

Quality:
I own some of the Disney remasterings and I played this on my ps3 so the images were upscaled. No question that the Disney dvds are on another level especially for the older movies in the collection, not such a noticeable difference on the newer movies probably because of the upscale. If the Disney dvds are an A+ then this set definitely a B/B+, the movies are watchable but they don't have the same pop as the Disney releases, Audio is great though.

If you are on the fence about picking up this set, I payed $60 for this set even though I own some of the Disney dvds! There is a lot of great work contained in this box set and almost all of the films have rewatch value. I would recommend this set to those who don't wanna spend a lot of money, but still wanna collect most of the Studio Ghibli films including those not released in North America. I would say get this if the price is around $30-$45, that being said I have no problem keeping this set in my collection and it saves space too!

It is important to note that this set does not include 'My Neighbors the Yamadas' which is actually my favourite Studio Ghibli film and it's a shame they couldn't fit it into this set because it is definitely a must watch.",1314230400,3,1763,4.336363636363636
6042796,2,B00G0LGW50,"A friend bought this and I am only basing this off of what I've seen.  The packaging has a little bit of a b-grade, bootleg feel to it overall.  I don't really care about that since I'm only interested in the actual movies but it kind of foreshadows what's inside.

Good -- a bunch of movies in, I think, their original Japanese, non-Disney basterdized version form.  I like that.  This has a lot of the movies you want to see from Ghibli that you may not otherwise see here on Amazon.  I think the subtitles can be a little rough around the edges at times but I think that's the way they come on the 'original' versions you get from Japan.

Bad -- quality is crap.  Granted I only watched Kiki's Delivery service but ouch!  It was pretty awful overall.  Visually it was very bad.  I watched the whole movie so was it really that bad or am I just a sucker for a good movie?  Well, it was bad.  Awful.  But it's still a great movie.  The audio dropped out completely for a few minutes at least two times.  Not something you expect from a brand new Amazon purchase.  After Kiki I put in an original DVD of Totoro a friend had brought from Japan.  The difference was night and day.

I doubt I will personally buy this.  I will probably have friends buy directly in Japan and send them as singles.  It's a major hassle but I think worth it.  If you are interested in buying this I would spend time reading the other reviews to help make a good decision for what you're getting.  There are some thoughtful comments that may help.",1313884800,7,1524,4.270175438596492
6042797,3,B00G0LGW50,"Okay this is a legit box, apparently this box set is issued only for use in the Malaysian/South East Asian market. It's not a bootleg product but it's not legally approved for sale in the United States either by Ghibli Studios. I bought this at $58 bucks + $3 shipping which is too much. My own fault for not researching the product before buying it as you can get the same thing from EBay or anywhere else for about half the price ($30).  The picture quality is in compressed MPEG-4 which is DVD quality but which may look horrible if you have a huge (40 inch) wide screen HDTV otherwise it looks decent enough if you play it on a laptop or small TV. If you use a Play Station 3 or DVD player with picture upscaling feature it might look a bit better (but not much). They pack a lot of content into each disc .. around 6 movies per disc and the 4th disc has Ponyo only (hence the subpar video quality). It's a good buy at $30 bucks as you get all 18 movies for dirt cheap. Also, note the movies are the original un-edited version, not the edited version produced by Disney. The product comes with multiple subtitles which some people says is better than Disney's. As for the product itself, I'm pleased with it. The DVD tray are kinda filmsy tho and the disc tends to pop out easily otherwise the case is neat with lot of illustrations of Totoro (which is a Studio Ghibli icon). However, I'm not pleased with the overpricing of the product by the seller (Electro Liquidation). Again, my own fault for not doing price research (it was late at night and I was tired). If you can get this for $30 bucks (I've seen them as low as $26 bucks) or less then it's a great buy.",1313452800,3,1668,4.261829652996846
6042798,3,B00G0LGW50,"I was really happy to get this, and am pleased because it's 18 of Miyazaki's movies for only $60. However, I was really disappointed because the art that was computer made looks terrible! It's very grainy and pixel-ly (EX: Howl's Moving Castle, etc). I mean, we can watch it, the quality is just so poor. But the ones that were actually drawn art - those look fine. It may be because I have an HDTV, but even on the Standard setting it looks like crap. But, for $60 you get what you pay for, I guess? I dunno...I just think that whole ""you get what you pay for"" thing is crap because it's not that hard to specify as a seller that the quality is best for the older model TVs and watching on a new TV won't really be all that great. Really, that's just an excuse for shady business. I'm not saying this seller is of shady business - they are fine.",1313107200,9,846,4.164634146341464

8619917,3,B00G0LGW50,"All the film's play and have both English and Japanese dubs with English subtitles but some of the subtitles are synched to the English dub so you get opening narration for ""Up on Poppy Hill"" that goes to the English language dub but no Japanese narration to go with it. Also it appears that the early film's are transferred from a VHS tapes based on artifacting and scanlines, the the transfer also appears to be from the English tapes or sources because it only lists the English actors. The films' that have had Disney releases have the Disney opening but none of the bonus features. The subtitles are similar to the Disney version but where they differ is the Disney subs are usually two lines where this cut uses one line so a few lines exceed the screen width and get cut off. Another odd quirk is that the English language subtitles are sometimes listed as ***. If you view the photos you will see subtitles cut off in Princess Mononoke, the weird *** subtitles listing in My Neighbors the Yamatas and the last two comparing the Disney two line subtitles to this versions one line.",1529625600,4,1088,4.5561224489795915
