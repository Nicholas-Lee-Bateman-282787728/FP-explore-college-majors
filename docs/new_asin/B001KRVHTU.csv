3669079,4,B001KRVHTU,"Real-life married couple Jean Simmons and Stewart Granger team up for this tight, compact little 1955 gaslit-era mystery, about the strange relationship between a murderous nobleman and his blackmailing parlour-maid.

Based on a story by W.W. Jacobs entitled ""The Interruption"", FOOTSTEPS IN THE FOG stars Stewart Granger as Stephen Lowry, a man who has successfully poisoned his wife, and thinks he's gotten away with the crime.  But parlour-maid Lily Watkins (Jean Simmons) discovers his deceptions and blackmails him, first for his wife's jewels and then for the coveted position of housekeeper.  Lily's silence comes cheap for Lowry, but in order to ensure that his crime remains under wraps, Lowry finds himself entangled in a growing web of deception, lies and murder...

FOOTSTEPS IN THE FOG is an outstanding gaslit-era costume thriller in the great tradition of ""Gaslight"", ""The Man with a Cloak"", and ""So Long at the Fair"", the latter also starring the luminous Jean Simmons.  Simmons is bewitching as Lily, the blackmailer we still end up cheering for, despite the dubious ways she ""earns"" the love of her master.  Likewise Stewart Granger walks a fine line in his performance as Lowry.  Neither character should be as ""likable"" as they appear; in all fairness these two monsters deserve each other.  It's to Simmons and Granger's credit that we do feel great empathy for them, despite the murderous web that they have created for themselves.

Co-starring Belinda Lee, Bill Travers, Ronald Squire, Finlay Currie, William Hartnell and Marjorie Rhodes.",1300320000,17,1561,5.262096774193548

3669108,4,B001KRVHTU,"Tidy little Victorian noir movie. There's not so much mystery about it as a straightforward crime, a bittersweet 'love' connection and a savage, tragic fatal fumble. It is played with grounded intensity between the two stars, Stewart Granger and Jean Simmons (married at the time, I believe). This is not a cat and mouse or kitchen cozy mystery. This is Gaslight atmospherics coupled with outright venality on everyone's part. It is competently and slickly done, and even if the outcome is foreordained, it is arrived at entertainingly. This would make for a particularly apt movie to watch on a damp --even foggy-- winter's night.",1433548800,2,631,5.076923076923077

3669125,3,B001KRVHTU,"I was strangely  bored by this film. It certainly wasn't the acting as Stewart Granger and Jean Simmons were excellent. I suppose the plot just didn't grab me.  These two devious characters, Stephen the nobleman and Lily the parlor maid, deserved eachother and yet the fact that Granger's character not only murdered his wife he tried to murder Lily, and murdered the wrong woman in a dense fog, is guilty of a far worse sin than blackmail. Lily, though scheming, was only guilty of blackmail. Lily continued to love her nobleman  but would you love a man who tried to kill you?  Lily is much smarter than her master Stephen, however, but both got  their comeuppance.

Footsteps just misses being a true noir film. I liked best the ambience scenes of Stephen's incredibly palacial Edwardian mansion. It's small wonder that Lily thirsted over being the chatelaine there with nobleman Stephen included. It's interesting that both Lily and Stephen, wicked as they were, make you like them. I guess that's good acting",1414108800,2,1013,4.894736842105263

3669132,5,B001KRVHTU,"This is a classic British thriller set in Victorian London, filmed in 1955 and directed by Arthur Lubin. The movie is based on a short story by W.W. Jacobs. Stephen Lowry (Stewart Grainger) is an English gentleman who has just buried his wife. Although she allegedly died of gastroenteritis, Lowry's house keeper, Lily Watkins (Jean Simmonds), knows that she was poisoned. She uses this information to try to blackmail her employer. So Lowry sets off on a foggy night to stalk and kill Watkins, but in the thick fog he kills the wrong girl - the wife of the local policeman Constable Matthew Burke. Lowry is subsequently identified by two men leaving a local pub and is brought to trial but gets off because Lily claims he was at home all evening with her. So her grip on Lowry is tightened.

Now Lowry wants to marry Elizabeth Travers (Belinda Lee), daughter of his business partner Alfred Travers (Ronald Squire). But she is also being pursued by barrister David Macdonald (Bill Travers), who acted for the defense when Lowry was on trial for the murder of Burke's wife. Lily is determined to rid the Lowry household of the other servants and to ensure that no other woman takes her place beside her beloved. In order to try to get rid of her, Lowry starts poisoning himself slowly but gets his dosage and timing wrong so kills himself instead. Lily's brother in law, Herbert Moresby, is played by William Hartnell - the very first incarnation of Dr. Who. A good film noir and the foggy Victorian setting is very authentic.",1371686400,,1525,4.690298507462686
3669133,4,B001KRVHTU,"This is a movie worth watching.  The ending is unexpected...so if you like the Hitchcock type thrillers, you will enjoy this one.  The other good ratings that I read before viewing this movie turned out to be true.",1363478400,2,214,4.605263157894737

3669135,5,B001KRVHTU,"This is an old movie that takes us back in time but is not dated. Acting is superb and intrigue is sustained throughout. It's a movie to take out again every few years, call a friend, cosy up by the fire, and get lost for a while.",1361923200,3,230,3.9148936170212765
3669136,5,B001KRVHTU,I have always liked this movie. It is hard to find movies with Jean Simmons and Stewart Granger or any other older movies for that matter. I was very happy with the movie. Thank You,1359244800,,181,4.2
3669137,5,B001KRVHTU,"This movie is worth having, I saw it years ago. Stewart Granger and Jean Simmons are outstanding in this cat and mouse thriller.  There are so many twists and turns, the plot is well planned out, it is well acted and well written.  If you are a fan of the kind of movies that make you wonder all the way through how it will all end?  this is for you. Movies like this make you wonder why some of the garbage today thinks it can pass for great cinema.  It arrived on time and was securely packaged.",1333152000,13,497,4.092783505154639
3669138,5,B001KRVHTU,"This is a great little Edwardian mystery film.  Putting married couple Jean Simmons and Stewart Granger together in this movie was a stroke of genius.  Not only is the acting superb in every way, there is a tension between the two pinciples that positively sizzles.  Bill Travers (Born Free) is also a great second-banana in one of his earlier roles as a London barrister.  You will love the twist at the climax.  Everything comes together in this film and that is a rarity -- sets, costumes, acting, writing, production values, etc., all make for a great, fun, and exciting viewing experience!",1332374400,5,594,4.841584158415841
3669139,5,B001KRVHTU,"FOOTSTEPS IN THE FOG:

Adapted from the short story ""The Interruption"" by W.W. Jacobs.

Classic thrillers such as Footsteps in the Fog, which depend upon intricate plots, are difficult to pull off on the Big Screen.  In this superbly crafted 1955 British thriller, the twists and turns slide neatly into place and in the masterful script by Lenore Coffee and Dorothy Davenport, the film avoids falling into the trap where the scenes appear staged and cliche.  The on-screen dynamics of real-life married couple Stewart Granger and Jean Simmons is superb and the chemistry between them cannot be denied, even as they seek to outwit one another in the cat-and-mouse battle that glues viewers to the seat. Jean Simmons (Lily Hawkins) who was one of the most under-rated stars of her time, delivers a splendid performance as one of the most sweet and yet deliciously conniving femme fatales in cinematic history--remnicent of a later Simmons role in ""Angel Face"" (1952).  Granger (Stephen Lowry) who on occasion landed roles that were clearly outside his range, plays the eloquent and evil cad to perfection.

Toss in some stellar support from Finlay Currie, Ronald Squire, Bill Travers and the result is a first-rate murder mystery in the grand tradition of the 1940's Victoria Melodadrama - Gaslight (1944) which starred Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman.",1323302400,4,1352,5.122727272727273
