2989592,5,B000WQWPSM,"Nothing lasts 12 years without having something going for it. In the case of Hawaii Five-O, it easy to dismiss it as a typically television crime drama that got lucky by finding its audience and keeping it. The same could be said for Law and Order. Except, in television years, luck usually runs out after two or three years. Gimmicks get old, the formula is figured out, and sharks are jumped so often they don't even complain.

But shows that last five years, much less 12, have to have something besides luck, gimmicks, and great scheduling. Hawaii Five-O had a number of things going for it. First of all, let's be honest. The setting was, and still is so lush and exotic that it is easily intoxicating. Hawaii is beautiful, and most people either live there or want to live there. Filming on location has always been a blessing when it's been done, and probably no more so than on this series.

Next, Jack Lord, playing Five-O chief Steve McGarrett, was one of a long line of no-nonsense law enforcement figures. The strength, integrity, and dedication of these kinds of characters cannot be overstated, and these characters will always have lots of fans rooting them on, not unlike Law and Order's Jack McCoy.

Finally, watching shows like this is always a treat because you see so many stars that were either big stars enjoying a working Hawaiian vacation, or lots of up and coming stars before they got their big break. Hawaii Five-O was a natural draw for both categories, and it's fun to watch them and remember when.

It's also fun to remember when you could look forward to hearing one of the best and most recognizable theme songs in television history. Not a small thing when you add it with the other factors. Hawaii Five-O had a lot going for it then, and it has a lot going for it now.",1194566400,46,1802,4.569659442724459
2989593,5,B000WQWPSM,"In order to move past the obvious----that this is one of the best cop shows of the 60's and 70's----I am instead commenting on the price. It seems that when a TV show, especially of this calibur, is presented to an obvious adoring public, the pricing becomes as heavy as the praise. While I am not against fair pricing, I am against the greed from the production companies that seems to slowly permeate the cost of such a boxed series. The corporates in charge catch on to the ""want"" of fans. Without even involving the Amazon discount, I am only discussing the original price of fifty dollars, which is quite steep, and which some otherwise loyal fans, cannot appreciate.

As a fan who appreciates the genre and era of this great cop show, which continues with the saga of McGarrett and his ace, crimefighting squad, I think I'll wait for a lesser price.

Peace!

Addendum: I thank ""J"" for catching my mistake!! This review should have been for season two, not season three, but I still feel that $35 is still too much, considering that there alot of seasons ahead of us, and that most shows are in the $20's price range. Have a good one! Aloha!",1194393600,6,1146,4.526570048309178

2989605,5,B000WQWPSM,"""Hawaii Five-O"" is one of the most entertaining and iconic detective shows in the history of television. Its third season continues to follow the exploits of Detective Captain Steve McGarrett, who serves as the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O. Jack Lord delivers a perennially outstanding performance portraying the unflappable and intrepid Captain Steve McGarrett, in his mission to vanquish the criminal element in Hawaii. Although ""Hawaii Five-O"" now comes across as being somewhat comical, because its initial episodes are almost fifty-years-old, most viewers still find it to be enjoyable, especially because of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. Therefore, I give ""Hawaii Five-O"" a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,,786,5.726495726495727

Jack Lord really inhabits his part and you can see his real life warmth towards the people and places of the island coming through.  The episodes come up fresh, with up-and-coming talent making guest appearances.  No real violence, but the pace and action move along with good plot twists.  We often know more than the police and it's fun to see them unravel the clues to catch up with the audience.  Lots of great locations.  FYI, after his death, Jack Lord's estate of $40 million went to Hawaiian charities.  Good on you Jack.",1469664000,2,698,4.672131147540983

2989702,4,B000WQWPSM,"""Hawaii Five-0 The Third Season"" originally aired on CBS during the 1970-71 TV season. This was the season the show firmly established itself as a hit, with millions of viewers tuning in each episode  to watch Steve McGarrett and his crack 5-0 team solve the crime of the week against the backdrop of beautiful Hawaiian beaches, forests, estates, and palm trees.

The Hawaiian setting helped the show stand out from the typical TV detective fare, usually set in New York or Los Angeles.  Perhaps more importantly, it was the use of Hawaii that allowed the show to firmly settle in the American  consciousness, and become a  pop culture touchstone that endures to this day. When the show went on the air in 1968, Hawaii had only been a state for nine years, and was still a fresh star on the American flag. If, by the late 1960s, the mainland had given up any claim to being a ""New Jerusalem,""  and was a society gone gray and curling up at the edges, the American Dream a victim of assassinations, racial unrest, bitter political divisions, a never--ending highly unpopular war, corruption, and pollution.  Viewers could tune in each week to ""Hawaii Five-0"" and see that the American Eden still existed, way out there in the Pacific, with the incorruptible indefatigable Steve McGarret standing guard at the gate, keeping the snakes and serpents at bay.

It also helped, of course, that Hawaii Five-0, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hawaii-Five-O-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000WQWPSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hawaii Five-O - The Complete Third Season</a>&nbsp;attests, was a well-produced weekly detective series. The acting, for the most part, was not great shakes. By this point the roles were pretty well defined. Jack Lord pretty much ran the show, the way McGarret ran the Five-0 unit, and mostly seemed to use the statue that appeared in the opening credits as his acting model. When he would occasionally crack a smile he seemed to put as much effort into it as Brando did in his scenes with Vivian Leigh  in ""Glass Menagerie."" Still, his performances, an original mixture of high-strung woodiness, did anchor the show and kept viewers tuning in.  James MacArthur, as Danny Williams, McGarrett's right-hand man, had adjusted himself to standing in Lord's shadow, and making the most of the scene or two each episode  that he got for himself.  Kam Fong and Zulu were just along for the ride, their roles pretty much reduced to performing street-level detective work (usually occurring off-screen), or serving as a mostly silent awed audience as McGarrett, usually in the third act, finally puts the pieces of the puzzle together and breaks the case wide-open.  The guest actors, for the most part, were standard performers who turned up with great frequency on TV shows in the 60s and 70s, such as Simon Oakland, Lloyd Bochner, Pernell Roberts, and Harry Guardino, who turn in performances like the pros they are.

If the acting was mostly typical of network prime time drama, the production values were usually well above what other shows at the time were offering.  The producers made full use of the show's Hawaiian location, setting a good portion of most episodes outside the studio walls.  As this season attests, at times the show would feature an extended chase or action sequence, such as a posse search on horseback (""Paniolo"") or a helicopter assault on a suspected enemy spy hide-out (""F.O.B. Honolulu Part One"") that come close to feature film quality.

The producers were resourceful and imaginative, making the most of the show's premise of a major crimes unit operating on a strategically important island in the Pacific. This format allowed it to feature episodes that ran the full spectrum of prime time action drama. Episodes in season three include general crime drama -- ""The Second Shot,"" ""The Gunrunner,"" espionage -- ""And Time to Die,"" kidnapping -- ""The Ransom,"" ""The Pay-Off,"" prison riots -- ""The Double Wall,"" psychotic killers -- ""Beautiful Screamer,"" drug smuggling -- ""Trouble in MInd,"" gangsters -- ""The Late John Louisiana,"" ""Ten Thousand Diamonds and a Heart,"" terrorism -- ""The Bomber and Mrs. Moroney,"" straight forward  murder mysteries - ""Force of Waves"" ""Time and Memories,"" ""Dear Enemy,""  human interest stories -- ""The Grandstand Play, Parts One and Two,"" and even the occasional light hearted caper story -- ""Over Fifty? Steal?"" Several episodes deal with issues of the time, such as environmental activism -- ""The Last Eden"" and Vietnam draft desertion -- ""To Kill or be Killed."" Wo Fat, as much a part of the ""Hawaii Five-0"" mystique as the other characters, turns up in the two-part ""F.O.B. Honolulu""

There's just one programming note. While Amazon promotes this as ""Hawaii Five-0 The Complete Third Season"" this DVD package is not the complete third season, which originally aired 25 episodes. This DVD package has 24 season three episodes, omitting episode 16, ""Bored, She Hung Herself."" This episode featured a key plot point of a counter-culture yoga instructor who's relaxation techniques included an act of non-fatal self-asphyxiation.  How some writer came up with this incredibly dumb idea I'll never know, but reportedly after this episode aired in  January 1971 a viewer tried to replicate the feat in their home, with predictable catastrophic results. Consequently CBS never aired the episode again in reruns and Paramount never included it for syndication.  To be sure, the phrase  ""Complete Third Season"" does not appear anywhere on the actual DVD packaging, so this is not a case of false advertising on the part of CBS Home Video. I'm not sure why Amazon promotes it as such.

As is the usual case with these CBS/Paramount DVD releases, the picture and sound quality are fine. And, as usual, there is very little in the way of special features, although, as with other ""Hawaii Five-0"" releases, episode promos for most of the episodes on these discs are included. About the only real complaint I have is that is that disc one contains close to ten minutes of ""previews"" for other series now available on home DVD, which I couldn't fast-forward through or ""Menu"" over. I found this most annoying, especially since I tend to watch episodes one night at a time. I feel like CBS/Paramount home video owes me 40 minutes of my life back.

""Hawaii Five-0 Season Three"" is highly recommended for Five-0 fans and completists, along with connoisseurs of classic TV crime drama.",1374105600,,6486,5.112582781456954

2989734,4,B000WQWPSM,"I have waited a long time to start collecting the 'Hawaii Five-O' series. One main reason was I was living in Hawaii for several years during the filming of the series. The other reason I am collecting is that I was a part of several episodes, getting paid for being an actor.  It was quite entertaining to see how a TV series was put together.  The series did cover alot of the Islands beautiful scenery (as did the ""Magnum, P.I."" series) and the production co. used many many Island people for background and bit parts.

To film a one hour TV show takes about 6-7 days a week, 15 hours a day. A TV series usually starts filming their season just after Memorial Day and 'wraps' up the filming just before Christmas time. Before the advent of satellite communications for broadcast TV,  All the shows that were shown on the US mainland for a specific week, would be put into film 'cans', and sent over to Hawaii. Those shows would then be televised One Week later thru out the Islands.  Those same shows were then shipped off to Alaska for broadcast, two weeks after they had been originally shown.",1266105600,,1098,4.49748743718593

Every episode is unique for filming on location using different: houses, buildings, exotic homes, and outdoor, beautiful, locations throughout Hawaii; often using people off the street.

Similar to ""Columbo"" as you see what the criminal did at the start, and watch McGarrett figure it out.

2989762,1,B000WQWPSM,"I love the series which is why I've been so disappointed with these early sets - for many reasons.  And I believe that Jack Lord, being the fastidious perfectionist he was, would not have approved.  Hopefully Paramount will do a better job with the remaining sets, but at this point it doesn't seem likely.

I've also noticed the grainy and unclear quality mentioned in these reviews.  Incredibly, it is very noticeable when compared to recordings of fairly recent Five-O TV broadcasts.  That's inexcusable.  I've noticed the same effect with much less popular/less expensive DVD collections such as my nephew's original series Speed Racer DVDs.  Since I only paid $9.99 - $11.99 for those, I didn't mind so much.  But price aside, for a show as spectacular as Hawaii Five-O, for which a DVD release was long delayed, one would expect much better quality; at least as good as the local TV broadcasts.

Considering these issues and such inappropriate decisions as omitting episodes thereby offering an INCOMPLETE COLLECTION, I don't see much reason to purchase these sets.  Especially when they OMIT EPISODES THAT ONLY AIRED ONCE as they themselves state; episodes that fans & collectors have been waiting ~40 years to see!  Add to that unspecified editing from the original broadcasts (as stated on the Season 2 & 3 boxes), the combination of which allowed Paramount (by design or not) to reduce costs by eliminating the 7th DVD, case, etc., and we might as well just watch/record them all - FREE - on our local UHF stations.  I wish I had known before I enthusiastically emptied my wallet.

Obviously these INCOMPLETE sets are not for collectors.  If you're a casual viewer with extra $$$ under the mattress who doesn't mind such shortcomings, maybe paying nearly $400 for a hastily compiled low quality incomplete collection is acceptable.  On the other hand, it may be well worth it to wait a few years for a better, remastered and complete boxed set, as we see every Christmas with even much less popular series.  And it will be much less expensive too (by $200 or so).  Of course they have to hold something back so they can give us reasons to buy that too when it comes out such as, ""high resolution digitally remastered"", ""previously unreleased episodes"", and ""un-edited original broadcasts"" . . . along with something like a Steve McGarrett replica badge.

2) Ep: ""A Bullet for McGarrett"" Scene: A police psychiatrist goes into further detail/demonstration in order to convince McGarrett that hypnosis certainly could be the weapon he faces.

2989765,5,B000WQWPSM,"One of McGarrett's trademark quotes - besides ""Book 'em, Danno!"" - is ""Go over it with a fine tooth comb,"" in reference to how he wants his crack team of investigators to go to work.  Well, the folks at CBS/Paramount really did that with the classic series, producing a compilation that not only looks better than it did almost three decades ago but sounds crystal clear.  One can only imagine how brilliant the show would look in high definition 'cause it sparkles in this release of the show's third season.

And what a season it is!!!

""Hawaii 5-0"" had its share of standard cops and robbers episodes but it also had some that were a cut above the norm, making commentary on the environment (""Paniolo"" and ""The Last Eden""), false imprisonment (""The Double Wall"" and ""Dear Enemy""), drug addiction (""Trouble in Mind""), and the horrors of war (""Force of Waves"" and ""To Kill or Be Killed"").

Jack Lord continues his fine performance as the always-in-charge Steve McGarrett, even being allowed to show his softer side as the character reminisces about a lovelost with the prime suspect being his ex-girlfriend.  Even ""Danno"" (James MacArthur) has a romantic interest, although it ends tragically (""Beautiful Screamer"").  Kam Fong (""Chin Ho"") and Zulu (""Kono"") are not just ""Hawaiian window dressing""; they are integral to each story and are perfect in their supporting roles.

The guest star roster reads like a who's who of character actors of the time, many repeat performers. Simon Oakland, Andrew Duggan, Harry Guardino, Ed Flanders, and Albert Paulsen are just a few examples of the fine talent that made its way, more than once, into the exciting stories of this landmark show.

Surprisingly, three of the best installments in the compilation feature brilliant performances from artists that rarely do television: Hume Cronyn (""Over Fifty? Steal""), Nancy Wilson, and Frank Silvera (in the aforementioned ""Trouble in Mind"" and ""Paniolo,"" respectively). Vera Miles, a staple of both movies and television, is remarkable as a troubled wife in ""Dear Enemy"" and Hope Summers (""Clara"" on the classic ""Andy Griffith Show"") sparkles on ""The Bomber and Mrs. Moroney.""

Viewers were also treated to a preview of actors that had yet to make their mark but would eventually become household names: Martin Sheen, Anne Archer, and Eric Braeden, to cite a few.

Great acting, superb storytelling, exciting musical scoring, and beautiful locations are what made the show a twelve-year institution, worthy of revisiting by fans and introducing to a whole new generation.",1204588800,22,2557,5.107913669064748
2989776,5,B000WQWPSM,"Growing up in the 60's and 70's I look back with some nostalgia at the culture,the lingo and the fashions :-) Sometimes when I see a television show from that time I ask myself ""wow, how could I have thought that was cool?"". Hawaii five-0 is definitely one of the exceptions. From the unforgettable theme song to the individual supporting characters like Danny, Chin Ho and Kono, and the complex bad guy, Wo Fat, it gets your attention and keeps it. You get the suspense you expect and occasional humor that Jack Lord could put into the gritty never-say-die character of Steve McGarrett.
When I got the first season, I  texted a picture of McGarrett to  my daughter who went to the University of Hawaii. She had no idea who it was, but I suggested she watch the show and see if she recognized any of the places. After that first show she was totally hooked! Now we both look forward to each new season and the only challenge is pacing ourselves so we don't watch one show after another :-)",1204243200,8,989,4.458563535911602

I was pleasantly surprised when season 2 surpassed seaon 1 (I actually hesitated before buying it), and now season 3 is better still--much better, I'd venture to say.  These episodes are so tightly written, carefully plotted, and well acted that they are just a joy to watch.  No season-long arcs and angst as with modern shows, just real police work--pounding the pavement, using phone books, Che Fong's CSI routine, it's all fantastic.  In the previous two seasons, I was enjoying the scenery, sets, and music as much as any other part of the show--but with seaons 3, I'm really becoming engrossed in the stories.  You usually know who the bad guy is, the fun is watching the Five-0 team put it all together and crack the case.  I'm a big Alias fan--I love the modern shows, but these old classics are a very, very welcome and engaging change of pace.",1203465600,9,936,4.608433734939759

2989784,5,B000WQWPSM,"Hawaii Five-O is one of my five favorite TV dramas of all time, the others being Star Trek the original series(is there any other?), Hill Street Blues, the original Law & Order and Homicide: Life on the Street. Five-O has always been sadly underrated; TV Guide didn't rank it in its top 50 shows of all time(a list that included Friends and The Oprah Winfrey Show, but neglected to include Star Trek or Homicide...either I have no taste or, well...), and some reviewers at other sources describe it as a standard '70's police drama. Five-O was anything but standard, in fact it had its own individual style, a combination of a slambang opening credits sequence(which begins with the visual motif of a threatening tidal wave and is set to the most exciting theme music ever), of gritty performances, outstanding music that was no small factor in setting the mood of the show, exemplary pacing, atmosphere(especially the bona fide Hawaiian scenery, alternating between lush vistas and seedy urban backdrops) and rock solid writing, which included some very ingenious and even bizarre storylines that ran the gamut from pulse-pounding international espionage to moving human drama. Five-O was a very quirky show, featuring a diverse cast of recurring character actors who represented all facets of Hawaiian life, and frequently investing as much time and emotion in the travails of the guest characters as on McGarrett and company. A fine example of this is the episode The Grandstand Play, in which the presentation of Five-O's investigation into the murder of a socialite at a ballpark is continually interrupted in order to focus on the life of the young man who witnessed the crime, a mentally challenged teen and son of a famous ballplayer, thus creating a special kind of empathy with this fully realized character.  Another frequent charge against the show, that McGarrett and his detectives were mere automatons, is totally baseless. Jack Lord, in particular, was expert at portraying all kinds of emotion, incredulity, indignation, disgust, anger, contempt, compassion, abject despair, although he was rarely overwrought, usually a strain in his voice or a pained twitch in his features was enough(watch the ending of Trouble in Mind) and in effect he functioned as the show's conscience, its moral barometer. McGarrett was a good cop who made no apologies for this, part idealist, part cynic, concerned about the environment, with a love for the islands and their people, a man who allowed the cases to get to him, but not to the point where they affected how he did his job. Viewers today might find that cheesy, but I think it's refreshing, and there is a huge difference between the straightlaced but very human McGarrett and the by the numbers to the point of being downright stiff Joe Friday. Finally, some people who compare Five-O to modern cop shows decry the lack of elaborate plotting, the ""twists"" if you will, but Five-O has twists, it just doesn't inundate the viewer with them the way contemporary shows do(my beloved Law & Order included), which makes for a more direct, perhaps more realistic, often more satisfying watching experience.

The first two seasons of Hawaii Five-O are excellent and well worth owning, but this is the year where it really comes together. The show is more consistently great this season, with more classic episodes than the previous years and fewer weak ones. My personal favorites include the gut-wrenching Trouble in Mind and To Kill Or Be Killed, the haunting Force of Waves and Paniolo, and the ingenious caper episodes Over Fifty? Steal and Ten Thousand Diamonds and a Heart. This season also includes a couple of great two-part episodes, F.O.B. Honolulu in which foreign agents, including the ubiquitous Wo Fat, bargain for plates that would allow them to create counterfeit twenty dollar bills, and the already mentioned The Grandstand Play, one of Five-O's most unique human dramas. I'm not wild about the episodes The Last Eden, Beautiful Screamer or Dear Enemy, but a mere three episodes out of twenty-four that I would classify as mediocre add up to odds I'll take any day of the week.

It's true that the extras are skimpy on these sets, but I'm not much of an extras person, I'm happy just having the episodes, especially when they're remastered to this degree. The picture quality is sharp, fantastic, the scenery is lovelier than ever...for the best evidence of this, check out the episode Paniolo, much of which takes place in the green mountains of Maui. Breathtaking!

People new to the series might consider starting with this season since it represents Five-O at its best, then going backwards and watching the first two, but really, all of the seasons so far are worth seeing, as are the next several.

My favorite of the season is the two part FOB Honolulu that could easily be a movie!

The debate over price point will ever go on.  Let us consider one thing.  We pay $20 for a new 'hot' film, but will not consider the value of the work and effort writers of the past have put into their craft.

This is the season where the show really hit its stride.  Virtually every episode in this season is a winner: solid, suspense-filled, action-packed mysteries with gorgeous scenery, great musical scores, a supremely talented cast and a nice group of guest stars, including Martin Sheen, John Vernon, Vera Miles, Pernell Roberts, Anne Archer, Eric Braeden, Gary Collins, Diana Muldaur, Hume Cronyn, Monte Markham, Sorrell Booke, Tim O' Connor and many more, including the return of Khigh Dhiegh as arch-villain Wo Fat, who appears in not 1 but 2 thrilling espionage adventures.

These episodes appear to be complete based on their 50-minute or more run times, despite CBS DVD's now-standard disclaimer that says ""some episodes may be edited from the original network versions"".  No music appears to be altered, either.
Every single episode from season 3 is included, and as a bonus the episodic promos are featured for most of them.  THese promos have not been shown in syndication and probably haven't been seen since their inclusion during the original network run.
The episodes appear to all be digitally remastered as with the previous seasons and have never looked more vibrant, along with animated menus, 6 discs each with 4 episodes and disc art, and a nice summary of each episode on the 3 slim cases housing the discs.

Stories include Wo Fat's attempt to steal counterfeit currency plates (a 2-part adventure); a baseball hero's son is on the run after witnessing a murder (another 2-parter); Kono getting caught by kidnapers while saving a young child, McGarrett's ex-fiancee is framed for murder; Dan runs the show after McGarrett is injured in a bomb blast; Dan is out for vengeance when his girlfriend is brutally murdered, thieves execute a clever diamond heist; a professional assassin falls in love with his intended victim and fakes her death from his boss; and a wily thief taunts McGarrett with Monopoly clues about his heists.  Plus many other fantastic episodes.  This season is where the show really hit its stride and became the slick, popular crime adventure everyone remembers.

3224089,5,B000WQWPSM,"Nothing lasts 12 years without having something going for it. In the case of Hawaii Five-O, it easy to dismiss it as a typically television crime drama that got lucky by finding its audience and keeping it. The same could be said for Law and Order. Except, in television years, luck usually runs out after two or three years. Gimmicks get old, the formula is figured out, and sharks are jumped so often they don't even complain.

But shows that last five years, much less 12, have to have something besides luck, gimmicks, and great scheduling. Hawaii Five-O had a number of things going for it. First of all, let's be honest. The setting was, and still is so lush and exotic that it is easily intoxicating. Hawaii is beautiful, and most people either live there or want to live there. Filming on location has always been a blessing when it's been done, and probably no more so than on this series.

Next, Jack Lord, playing Five-O chief Steve McGarrett, was one of a long line of no-nonsense law enforcement figures. The strength, integrity, and dedication of these kinds of characters cannot be overstated, and these characters will always have lots of fans rooting them on, not unlike Law and Order's Jack McCoy.

Finally, watching shows like this is always a treat because you see so many stars that were either big stars enjoying a working Hawaiian vacation, or lots of up and coming stars before they got their big break. Hawaii Five-O was a natural draw for both categories, and it's fun to watch them and remember when.

It's also fun to remember when you could look forward to hearing one of the best and most recognizable theme songs in television history. Not a small thing when you add it with the other factors. Hawaii Five-O had a lot going for it then, and it has a lot going for it now.",1194566400,46,1802,4.569659442724459
3224090,5,B000WQWPSM,"In order to move past the obvious----that this is one of the best cop shows of the 60's and 70's----I am instead commenting on the price. It seems that when a TV show, especially of this calibur, is presented to an obvious adoring public, the pricing becomes as heavy as the praise. While I am not against fair pricing, I am against the greed from the production companies that seems to slowly permeate the cost of such a boxed series. The corporates in charge catch on to the ""want"" of fans. Without even involving the Amazon discount, I am only discussing the original price of fifty dollars, which is quite steep, and which some otherwise loyal fans, cannot appreciate.

As a fan who appreciates the genre and era of this great cop show, which continues with the saga of McGarrett and his ace, crimefighting squad, I think I'll wait for a lesser price.

The episodes come up fresh, with up-and-coming talent making guest appearances.  No real violence, but the pace and action move along with good plot twists.  We often know more than the police and it's fun to see them unravel the clues to catch up with the audience.  Lots of great locations.

3224199,4,B000WQWPSM,"""Hawaii Five-0 The Third Season"" originally aired on CBS during the 1970-71 TV season. This was the season the show firmly established itself as a hit, with millions of viewers tuning in each episode  to watch Steve McGarrett and his crack 5-0 team solve the crime of the week against the backdrop of beautiful Hawaiian beaches, forests, estates, and palm trees.

The Hawaiian setting helped the show stand out from the typical TV detective fare, usually set in New York or Los Angeles.  Perhaps more importantly, it was the use of Hawaii that allowed the show to firmly settle in the American  consciousness, and become a  pop culture touchstone that endures to this day. When the show went on the air in 1968, Hawaii had only been a state for nine years, and was still a fresh star on the American flag. If, by the late 1960s, the mainland had given up any claim to being a ""New Jerusalem,""  and was a society gone gray and curling up at the edges, the American Dream a victim of assassinations, racial unrest, bitter political divisions, a never--ending highly unpopular war, corruption, and pollution.  Viewers could tune in each week to ""Hawaii Five-0"" and see that the American Eden still existed, way out there in the Pacific, with the incorruptible indefatigable Steve McGarret standing guard at the gate, keeping the snakes and serpents at bay.

It also helped, of course, that Hawaii Five-0, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hawaii-Five-O-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000WQWPSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hawaii Five-O - The Complete Third Season</a>&nbsp;attests, was a well-produced weekly detective series. The acting, for the most part, was not great shakes. By this point the roles were pretty well defined. Jack Lord pretty much ran the show, the way McGarret ran the Five-0 unit, and mostly seemed to use the statue that appeared in the opening credits as his acting model. When he would occasionally crack a smile he seemed to put as much effort into it as Brando did in his scenes with Vivian Leigh  in ""Glass Menagerie."" Still, his performances, an original mixture of high-strung woodiness, did anchor the show and kept viewers tuning in.  James MacArthur, as Danny Williams, McGarrett's right-hand man, had adjusted himself to standing in Lord's shadow, and making the most of the scene or two each episode  that he got for himself.  Kam Fong and Zulu were just along for the ride, their roles pretty much reduced to performing street-level detective work (usually occurring off-screen), or serving as a mostly silent awed audience as McGarrett, usually in the third act, finally puts the pieces of the puzzle together and breaks the case wide-open.  The guest actors, for the most part, were standard performers who turned up with great frequency on TV shows in the 60s and 70s, such as Simon Oakland, Lloyd Bochner, Pernell Roberts, and Harry Guardino, who turn in performances like the pros they are.

If the acting was mostly typical of network prime time drama, the production values were usually well above what other shows at the time were offering.  The producers made full use of the show's Hawaiian location, setting a good portion of most episodes outside the studio walls.  As this season attests, at times the show would feature an extended chase or action sequence, such as a posse search on horseback (""Paniolo"") or a helicopter assault on a suspected enemy spy hide-out (""F.O.B. Honolulu Part One"") that come close to feature film quality.

The producers were resourceful and imaginative, making the most of the show's premise of a major crimes unit operating on a strategically important island in the Pacific. This format allowed it to feature episodes that ran the full spectrum of prime time action drama. Episodes in season three include general crime drama -- ""The Second Shot,"" ""The Gunrunner,"" espionage -- ""And Time to Die,"" kidnapping -- ""The Ransom,"" ""The Pay-Off,"" prison riots -- ""The Double Wall,"" psychotic killers -- ""Beautiful Screamer,"" drug smuggling -- ""Trouble in MInd,"" gangsters -- ""The Late John Louisiana,"" ""Ten Thousand Diamonds and a Heart,"" terrorism -- ""The Bomber and Mrs. Moroney,"" straight forward  murder mysteries - ""Force of Waves"" ""Time and Memories,"" ""Dear Enemy,""  human interest stories -- ""The Grandstand Play, Parts One and Two,"" and even the occasional light hearted caper story -- ""Over Fifty? Steal?"" Several episodes deal with issues of the time, such as environmental activism -- ""The Last Eden"" and Vietnam draft desertion -- ""To Kill or be Killed."" Wo Fat, as much a part of the ""Hawaii Five-0"" mystique as the other characters, turns up in the two-part ""F.O.B. Honolulu""

There's just one programming note. While Amazon promotes this as ""Hawaii Five-0 The Complete Third Season"" this DVD package is not the complete third season, which originally aired 25 episodes. This DVD package has 24 season three episodes, omitting episode 16, ""Bored, She Hung Herself."" This episode featured a key plot point of a counter-culture yoga instructor who's relaxation techniques included an act of non-fatal self-asphyxiation.  How some writer came up with this incredibly dumb idea I'll never know, but reportedly after this episode aired in  January 1971 a viewer tried to replicate the feat in their home, with predictable catastrophic results. Consequently CBS never aired the episode again in reruns and Paramount never included it for syndication.  To be sure, the phrase  ""Complete Third Season"" does not appear anywhere on the actual DVD packaging, so this is not a case of false advertising on the part of CBS Home Video. I'm not sure why Amazon promotes it as such.

As is the usual case with these CBS/Paramount DVD releases, the picture and sound quality are fine. And, as usual, there is very little in the way of special features, although, as with other ""Hawaii Five-0"" releases, episode promos for most of the episodes on these discs are included. About the only real complaint I have is that is that disc one contains close to ten minutes of ""previews"" for other series now available on home DVD, which I couldn't fast-forward through or ""Menu"" over. I found this most annoying, especially since I tend to watch episodes one night at a time. I feel like CBS/Paramount home video owes me 40 minutes of my life back.

Sure, they seem a little slow compared to today's TV shows, but the stories are good, the Hawaiian locations are beautiful, and it's fun to see the old stars who were active in the 70's. One of the things I enjoy seeing, besides young Jack Lord, is the decor of the day. I was a kid in the 70's and remember the crazy, bright colors, teased hair, and the dial phones  in odd colors.
The quality of the picture is very good. I was surprised by it. The sound is good, too.
If you grew up in the 70's, or like the era and its cop shows, you will like Season 3 of Hawaii Five-0 classic.",1362960000,,645,4.078740157480315

The thing that makes this show cool (other than the theme music) is how angry Steve McGarrett gets.  If you compare him to other police cops of his time such as Joe Friday he certainly loses his cool more often.

3224231,4,B000WQWPSM,"I have waited a long time to start collecting the 'Hawaii Five-O' series. One main reason was I was living in Hawaii for several years during the filming of the series. The other reason I am collecting is that I was a part of several episodes, getting paid for being an actor.  It was quite entertaining to see how a TV series was put together.  The series did cover alot of the Islands beautiful scenery (as did the ""Magnum, P.I."" series) and the production co. used many many Island people for background and bit parts.

To film a one hour TV show takes about 6-7 days a week, 15 hours a day. A TV series usually starts filming their season just after Memorial Day and 'wraps' up the filming just before Christmas time. Before the advent of satellite communications for broadcast TV,  All the shows that were shown on the US mainland for a specific week, would be put into film 'cans', and sent over to Hawaii. Those shows would then be televised One Week later thru out the Islands.  Those same shows were then shipped off to Alaska for broadcast, two weeks after they had been originally shown.",1266105600,,1098,4.49748743718593

""The Ransom"" great episode for Kono fans)
""Reunion""(loved seeing Barry Atwater without Makeup)
""Over Fifty? Steal"" (hilarious episode with Hume Cronyn)

Clever scripts, still interesting today. Scripts written by a variety of writers. Co-producer, Jack Lord, was a perfectionist, and went over every script ahead of time making changes.

Every episode is unique for filming on location using different: houses, buildings, exotic homes, and outdoor, beautiful, locations throughout Hawaii; often using people off the street.

Similar to ""Columbo"" as you see what the criminal did at the start, and watch McGarrett figure it out. Likeable regular-cast, McGarrett, Danno, Chin-Ho, and Kono, and different criminals and victims in each episode.

Since we pay for these fine programs why do we have to waste our time watching these promos that we don't want to see every time you put a disc in? Seasons 1 & 2 were perfect, why ruin it? I still highly recommend these dvd's because of the Hawaii Five-O shows. This is tv at its best. The passion for perfection is evident in every performance from the superb cast in each episode. Anyone who was involved in the acting and production of Hawaii Five-O and are still alive should be proud of what they created. So many fans are out there who remember the show.

3224259,1,B000WQWPSM,"I love the series which is why I've been so disappointed with these early sets - for many reasons.  And I believe that Jack Lord, being the fastidious perfectionist he was, would not have approved.  Hopefully Paramount will do a better job with the remaining sets, but at this point it doesn't seem likely.

I've also noticed the grainy and unclear quality mentioned in these reviews.  Incredibly, it is very noticeable when compared to recordings of fairly recent Five-O TV broadcasts.  That's inexcusable.  I've noticed the same effect with much less popular/less expensive DVD collections such as my nephew's original series Speed Racer DVDs.  Since I only paid $9.99 - $11.99 for those, I didn't mind so much.  But price aside, for a show as spectacular as Hawaii Five-O, for which a DVD release was long delayed, one would expect much better quality; at least as good as the local TV broadcasts.

Considering these issues and such inappropriate decisions as omitting episodes thereby offering an INCOMPLETE COLLECTION, I don't see much reason to purchase these sets.  Especially when they OMIT EPISODES THAT ONLY AIRED ONCE as they themselves state; episodes that fans & collectors have been waiting ~40 years to see!  Add to that unspecified editing from the original broadcasts (as stated on the Season 2 & 3 boxes), the combination of which allowed Paramount (by design or not) to reduce costs by eliminating the 7th DVD, case, etc., and we might as well just watch/record them all - FREE - on our local UHF stations.  I wish I had known before I enthusiastically emptied my wallet.

Obviously these INCOMPLETE sets are not for collectors.  If you're a casual viewer with extra $$$ under the mattress who doesn't mind such shortcomings, maybe paying nearly $400 for a hastily compiled low quality incomplete collection is acceptable.  On the other hand, it may be well worth it to wait a few years for a better, remastered and complete boxed set, as we see every Christmas with even much less popular series.  And it will be much less expensive too (by $200 or so).  Of course they have to hold something back so they can give us reasons to buy that too when it comes out such as, ""high resolution digitally remastered"", ""previously unreleased episodes"", and ""un-edited original broadcasts"" . . . along with something like a Steve McGarrett replica badge.

******************************************************
* UPDATE 2/5/09 :: MISSING SCENES - THE EDITS INCLUDE CONTENT *
******************************************************
Paramount has told us they've further edited these.  So it hasn't been a surprise that I've noticed quite a bit throughout.  Just for examples I'll point out a few I noticed recently while watching 6 sequential episodes.  This is not intended to be a complete list or recount of details.

1) Ep: ""Forty Feet High and it Kills!"" Scene: A humorous back & forth between Wo Fat and the Quirky Professor in which Wo Fat confronts the professor regarding his deliberate attempts to foil ""Mr. Fat's"" machination in the on-going game of mental chess between the two.

2) Ep: ""A Bullet for McGarrett"" Scene: A police psychiatrist goes into further detail/demonstration in order to convince McGarrett that hypnosis certainly could be the weapon he faces.

3) Ep: ""The Singapore File"" Scene: McGarrett outruns Victor in a car chase, then tensely negotiates, without his ID/papers, for passage on a ship from Singapore.",1206748800,18,3446,5.0799289520426285
3224260,5,B000WQWPSM,I have been eagerly awaiting the third season.  Glad it finally came out.  The discs were well prepared.  Can't wait to see season 4.,1205539200,3,133,4.458333333333333
3224261,4,B000WQWPSM,"Another great series as Mc Garrett and Five-0 do what they are best at- solve crime. Great episodes like the Bomber and Mrs Maroney show the kinship between the officers as well as showcasing the lovely Hawaiian backdrop. Watch it and transport yourself back to a time when cops were cool and crooks got, ""BOOK EM"".",1205452800,6,315,4.642857142857143
3224262,5,B000WQWPSM,"One of McGarrett's trademark quotes - besides ""Book 'em, Danno!"" - is ""Go over it with a fine tooth comb,"" in reference to how he wants his crack team of investigators to go to work.  Well, the folks at CBS/Paramount really did that with the classic series, producing a compilation that not only looks better than it did almost three decades ago but sounds crystal clear.  One can only imagine how brilliant the show would look in high definition 'cause it sparkles in this release of the show's third season.

And what a season it is!!!

""Hawaii 5-0"" had its share of standard cops and robbers episodes but it also had some that were a cut above the norm, making commentary on the environment (""Paniolo"" and ""The Last Eden""), false imprisonment (""The Double Wall"" and ""Dear Enemy""), drug addiction (""Trouble in Mind""), and the horrors of war (""Force of Waves"" and ""To Kill or Be Killed"").

Jack Lord continues his fine performance as the always-in-charge Steve McGarrett, even being allowed to show his softer side as the character reminisces about a lovelost with the prime suspect being his ex-girlfriend.  Even ""Danno"" (James MacArthur) has a romantic interest, although it ends tragically (""Beautiful Screamer"").  Kam Fong (""Chin Ho"") and Zulu (""Kono"") are not just ""Hawaiian window dressing""; they are integral to each story and are perfect in their supporting roles.

The guest star roster reads like a who's who of character actors of the time, many repeat performers. Simon Oakland, Andrew Duggan, Harry Guardino, Ed Flanders, and Albert Paulsen are just a few examples of the fine talent that made its way, more than once, into the exciting stories of this landmark show.

Surprisingly, three of the best installments in the compilation feature brilliant performances from artists that rarely do television: Hume Cronyn (""Over Fifty? Steal""), Nancy Wilson, and Frank Silvera (in the aforementioned ""Trouble in Mind"" and ""Paniolo,"" respectively). Vera Miles, a staple of both movies and television, is remarkable as a troubled wife in ""Dear Enemy"" and Hope Summers (""Clara"" on the classic ""Andy Griffith Show"") sparkles on ""The Bomber and Mrs. Moroney.""

Viewers were also treated to a preview of actors that had yet to make their mark but would eventually become household names: Martin Sheen, Anne Archer, and Eric Braeden, to cite a few.

Great acting, superb storytelling, exciting musical scoring, and beautiful locations are what made the show a twelve-year institution, worthy of revisiting by fans and introducing to a whole new generation.",1204588800,22,2557,5.107913669064748
3224273,5,B000WQWPSM,"Growing up in the 60's and 70's I look back with some nostalgia at the culture,the lingo and the fashions :-) Sometimes when I see a television show from that time I ask myself ""wow, how could I have thought that was cool?"". Hawaii five-0 is definitely one of the exceptions. From the unforgettable theme song to the individual supporting characters like Danny, Chin Ho and Kono, and the complex bad guy, Wo Fat, it gets your attention and keeps it. You get the suspense you expect and occasional humor that Jack Lord could put into the gritty never-say-die character of Steve McGarrett.
When I got the first season, I  texted a picture of McGarrett to  my daughter who went to the University of Hawaii. She had no idea who it was, but I suggested she watch the show and see if she recognized any of the places. After that first show she was totally hooked! Now we both look forward to each new season and the only challenge is pacing ourselves so we don't watch one show after another :-)",1204243200,8,989,4.458563535911602

I was pleasantly surprised when season 2 surpassed seaon 1 (I actually hesitated before buying it), and now season 3 is better still--much better, I'd venture to say.  These episodes are so tightly written, carefully plotted, and well acted that they are just a joy to watch.  No season-long arcs and angst as with modern shows, just real police work--pounding the pavement, using phone books, Che Fong's CSI routine, it's all fantastic.  In the previous two seasons, I was enjoying the scenery, sets, and music as much as any other part of the show--but with seaons 3, I'm really becoming engrossed in the stories.  You usually know who the bad guy is, the fun is watching the Five-0 team put it all together and crack the case.  I'm a big Alias fan--I love the modern shows, but these old classics are a very, very welcome and engaging change of pace.",1203465600,9,936,4.608433734939759

3224281,5,B000WQWPSM,"Hawaii Five-O is one of my five favorite TV dramas of all time, the others being Star Trek the original series(is there any other?), Hill Street Blues, the original Law & Order and Homicide: Life on the Street. Five-O has always been sadly underrated; TV Guide didn't rank it in its top 50 shows of all time(a list that included Friends and The Oprah Winfrey Show, but neglected to include Star Trek or Homicide...either I have no taste or, well...), and some reviewers at other sources describe it as a standard '70's police drama. Five-O was anything but standard, in fact it had its own individual style, a combination of a slambang opening credits sequence(which begins with the visual motif of a threatening tidal wave and is set to the most exciting theme music ever), of gritty performances, outstanding music that was no small factor in setting the mood of the show, exemplary pacing, atmosphere(especially the bona fide Hawaiian scenery, alternating between lush vistas and seedy urban backdrops) and rock solid writing, which included some very ingenious and even bizarre storylines that ran the gamut from pulse-pounding international espionage to moving human drama. Five-O was a very quirky show, featuring a diverse cast of recurring character actors who represented all facets of Hawaiian life, and frequently investing as much time and emotion in the travails of the guest characters as on McGarrett and company. A fine example of this is the episode The Grandstand Play, in which the presentation of Five-O's investigation into the murder of a socialite at a ballpark is continually interrupted in order to focus on the life of the young man who witnessed the crime, a mentally challenged teen and son of a famous ballplayer, thus creating a special kind of empathy with this fully realized character.  Another frequent charge against the show, that McGarrett and his detectives were mere automatons, is totally baseless. Jack Lord, in particular, was expert at portraying all kinds of emotion, incredulity, indignation, disgust, anger, contempt, compassion, abject despair, although he was rarely overwrought, usually a strain in his voice or a pained twitch in his features was enough(watch the ending of Trouble in Mind) and in effect he functioned as the show's conscience, its moral barometer. McGarrett was a good cop who made no apologies for this, part idealist, part cynic, concerned about the environment, with a love for the islands and their people, a man who allowed the cases to get to him, but not to the point where they affected how he did his job. Viewers today might find that cheesy, but I think it's refreshing, and there is a huge difference between the straightlaced but very human McGarrett and the by the numbers to the point of being downright stiff Joe Friday. Finally, some people who compare Five-O to modern cop shows decry the lack of elaborate plotting, the ""twists"" if you will, but Five-O has twists, it just doesn't inundate the viewer with them the way contemporary shows do(my beloved Law & Order included), which makes for a more direct, perhaps more realistic, often more satisfying watching experience.

The first two seasons of Hawaii Five-O are excellent and well worth owning, but this is the year where it really comes together. The show is more consistently great this season, with more classic episodes than the previous years and fewer weak ones. My personal favorites include the gut-wrenching Trouble in Mind and To Kill Or Be Killed, the haunting Force of Waves and Paniolo, and the ingenious caper episodes Over Fifty? Steal and Ten Thousand Diamonds and a Heart. This season also includes a couple of great two-part episodes, F.O.B. Honolulu in which foreign agents, including the ubiquitous Wo Fat, bargain for plates that would allow them to create counterfeit twenty dollar bills, and the already mentioned The Grandstand Play, one of Five-O's most unique human dramas. I'm not wild about the episodes The Last Eden, Beautiful Screamer or Dear Enemy, but a mere three episodes out of twenty-four that I would classify as mediocre add up to odds I'll take any day of the week.

It's true that the extras are skimpy on these sets, but I'm not much of an extras person, I'm happy just having the episodes, especially when they're remastered to this degree. The picture quality is sharp, fantastic, the scenery is lovelier than ever...for the best evidence of this, check out the episode Paniolo, much of which takes place in the green mountains of Maui. Breathtaking!

People new to the series might consider starting with this season since it represents Five-O at its best, then going backwards and watching the first two, but really, all of the seasons so far are worth seeing, as are the next several. They can't release these things fast enough for me.",1202083200,15,4825,4.990062111801242

3224283,5,B000WQWPSM,"I was 5 when this show first aired and watched it until it ended. It reminds me of the old days,the cars,the clothes,it was a fun time! Now is fun too with technology and all(DVDs).Now I'm old enough to catch all the little quirks that I did not catch back then(Mcgarrett's car growing doors en route).That makes the show even more enjoyable. Back then we were so amazed just to have color TV and only the well to do had remote controls! I too wished they were released sooner and plan on buying them all as quick as they become available. I have visited Oahu and Kaui and of course I had to tour Iolani Palace. Everyone should go there at least once in their life,I will go back. Aloha!",1201824000,5,687,4.292307692307692
3224284,5,B000WQWPSM,"Paramount certainly is appreciated for releasing the series after 38 years but the ""packaging"" of the third season is insulting to true fans.  By that I meaan the front loaded advertisements for TV series currently on air or recently syndicated.  Paramount should preserve the classic programing and drop the 5 minutes of advertising on EACH disc. Nothing on air except L&O comes close to the essence of Five-O and should not be documented on the same media!",1201564800,4,458,4.935064935064935
3224285,5,B000WQWPSM,"The third season of Hawaii Five-O picks right up from season 2 and brings you 24 great episodes of exciting cop drama.
This show had so much going for it: great locale, exciting stories, good scripts and acting.
Jack Lord stands out as the swaggering McGarret.
The quality of this set is first-rate: great video transfer and audio/video quality.

3224287,5,B000WQWPSM,"WOW!!  What a fantastic show!!!  This season is way better than the second - the stories are just fantastic - tightly written, smartly acted, beautifully shot!  Every episode, every single one, features compelling characters and stories - not a dog in sight - and many of them have great music. Nancy Wilson shows how it's done - beautiful, talented actor and she sings circles around today's young manufactured stars. The last 5 minutes of To Kill or To Be Killed are story telling is its best - elegant, spare, powerful; I dare you to watch without getting at least choked up! Superb Danny episodes in Beautiful Screamer and Bomber and Mrs Moroney - Jim MacArthur delivers a totally gut-wrenching performance, whether he is raw and open or wound up tighter than a watch spring, in the first; and is wonderfully nuanced with tension and regrets in the second. My only complaint is that we had to wait so long for the release of this season.  Please, P'mount, can you please speed up the frequency of release?  Could you consider releasing the rest of the series all at once? I promise I'll buy it (and extra copies for my friends!)  Thank you so much and please keep 'em coming.  This is superb television!!!",1201219200,8,1209,4.6745283018867925
3224288,4,B000WQWPSM,"From the rolling waves the theme song rises with our memories of Hawaii Five O.  Familiar drum beats, percussion sections and cameos of stars and supporting players lead us into the Hawaiian sunset.  Out of the Islands, Steve McGarrett, Danno, and the entire 5-0 squad tackle crime with enthusiasm and zeal.

Containing 24 episodes on 3 discs and episodic promos, the set includes the return of Wo Fat in ""And Time To Die"", guest star Martin Sheen in ""Time And Memories"", Vera Miles in ""Dear Enemy"", and Nancy Wilson in ""Trouble in Mind.""  My favorite of the season is the two part FOB Honolulu that could easily be a movie!

The debate over price point will ever go on.  Let us consider one thing.  We pay $20 for a new 'hot' film, but will not consider the value of the work and effort writers of the past have put into their craft.

Forget reality TV, and pop in Five O, and take a trip to the Island.

3224289,5,B000WQWPSM,"Five-0 fans, cop show fans in general, and fans of classic television will thoroughly enjoy HAWAII FIVE-0: The Third Season, which I just received on DVD.
This is the season where the show really hit its stride.  Virtually every episode in this season is a winner: solid, suspense-filled, action-packed mysteries with gorgeous scenery, great musical scores, a supremely talented cast and a nice group of guest stars, including Martin Sheen, John Vernon, Vera Miles, Pernell Roberts, Anne Archer, Eric Braeden, Gary Collins, Diana Muldaur, Hume Cronyn, Monte Markham, Sorrell Booke, Tim O' Connor and many more, including the return of Khigh Dhiegh as arch-villain Wo Fat, who appears in not 1 but 2 thrilling espionage adventures.

These episodes appear to be complete based on their 50-minute or more run times, despite CBS DVD's now-standard disclaimer that says ""some episodes may be edited from the original network versions"".  No music appears to be altered, either.
Every single episode from season 3 is included, and as a bonus the episodic promos are featured for most of them.  THese promos have not been shown in syndication and probably haven't been seen since their inclusion during the original network run.
The episodes appear to all be digitally remastered as with the previous seasons and have never looked more vibrant, along with animated menus, 6 discs each with 4 episodes and disc art, and a nice summary of each episode on the 3 slim cases housing the discs.

Stories include Wo Fat's attempt to steal counterfeit currency plates (a 2-part adventure); a baseball hero's son is on the run after witnessing a murder (another 2-parter); Kono getting caught by kidnapers while saving a young child, McGarrett's ex-fiancee is framed for murder; Dan runs the show after McGarrett is injured in a bomb blast; Dan is out for vengeance when his girlfriend is brutally murdered, thieves execute a clever diamond heist; a professional assassin falls in love with his intended victim and fakes her death from his boss; and a wily thief taunts McGarrett with Monopoly clues about his heists.  Plus many other fantastic episodes.  This season is where the show really hit its stride and became the slick, popular crime adventure everyone remembers.

Magnum PI really never made it like Hawaii Five-O.  Sure, Hawaii Five-O and Magnum PI have something in common, they were both filmed in Hawaii.  However, what makes Hawaii Five-O so successful, it's the writers, the story line, the opening theme, and the actors including Jack Lord who made the show so successful.
