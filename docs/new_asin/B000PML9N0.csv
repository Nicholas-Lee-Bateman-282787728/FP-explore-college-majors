8192845,5,B000PML9N0,"I have seen some other Stephane Vanel's videos and he can perform magic and seeming miracles with cards.  I also have lots of different videos with card tricks. magic tricks, card manipulation and extreme card manipulation, but this DVD is the easiest of them all - even small children may learn how to do these card tricks.

Having a bunch of easy card tricks under your belt will boost your confidence and give you encouragement to proceed with more challenging card manipulation.

As Stephane says, he started learning magic tricks to overcome shyness.  Being able to perform some tricks helped him to break the ice when meeting people and in the process he has developed a great mastery of the sleight of hand, and so can you - have fun and entertain family and friends.",1249171200,2,774,4.711111111111111

8192847,5,B000PML9N0,I bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loved it so much that she hid it because she didn't want the rest of the family to know the secret of the card tricks.,1237420800,,187,4.194444444444445
8192848,4,B000PML9N0,I bought this for my 14yr old son and he has watched the magic tricks only once. He is able to watch and show our family a card trick after viewing it once. He loves it! I recommend. I meant to give this five stars.,1231718400,,215,3.8
8192849,3,B000PML9N0,"If you are a beginner to magic, skip to 2nd paragraph.

As a magician myself, I bought this product hoping I could learn something new and I didn't. If you already watched Michael Ammar's videos (I Highly recommend), then there is nothing to be accomplished. There are two forces that are in this video and they aren't the best way to do them. There are also about 8 - 10 tricks, all very easy to learn if you do not know them already. One of them being ""The Accordion"". If you know the riffle force, I suggest you skip this DVD as you would probably think all these tricks to be beginner level. For more advanced magicians, I give this 1 star.

This is a good dvd to start with, you learn a couple ways to force a card, and a few tricks to get you started. The last trick on the DVD is his best and it will probably take you 2 hours of practice to master. None of these tricks are too hard to learn, and I highly recommend you have a deck of cards in front of you to follow along with. For Beginners,  I give this 4 stars. I recommend Michael Ammar over Stephane Vanel.",1200528000,4,1070,4.110047846889952
8192850,5,B000PML9N0,"As a professional card magician, I consider this to be the best DVD in the market! ""Vanel"" is ten times better than Michael Ammar and others in the industry! The personality and magnetism of his lessons, routines, manipulations, mis-directions and explanations are the best in the magic world! Michael Ammar is over-rated and talks toooooo much, should take lessons from Stephane Vanel who is a true Magician and has the expertises of being the best card mechanic of our century!! Buy this DVD and you will be performing like a pro! It's well priced contrary to others who don't have a clue of what real card magic is all about!

8192851,5,B000PML9N0,"Stephane is amazing! (and not just his looks ;)  When you first see the tricks you think it will take years to be able to do them, but almost all of them only took minutes to learn and a little more time to get pretty good at. I purchased this DVD for my niece and couldn't stop watching it with her! We had a blast performing for our family who was totally blown away and insisted on knowing our magic secrets.  A fantastic product that we'll enjoy for years to come.",1182297600,9,468,4.131868131868132
8192852,5,B000PML9N0,"Sorry for being blunt, but that's what guys want to know!  I don't know of an easier way to break the ice than a magic trick, and the ones that Vanel teaches on this DVD are so frickin' easy to learn/master that they will NO DOUBT get you conversing with whomever you want while making you out to be a rockstar at the same time.  The rest is up to you, but how can you pass on an advantage like that?",1182211200,7,400,3.925925925925926
