From the start, this entire series has been a masterpiece that displayed a diverse array of character development and a story of exciting tension and gripping turns of events.  In addition there have also been wonderful moments of wild humour and warmth.

But all of that was merely a small portion of what twenty-six episodes of Infinite Ryvius has to offer.

Quirky moments aside, one could easily spend a month reflecting on the philosophical conflicts that broke out between the crew of the Ryvius on its quest of survival.  They did not remain rigidly static characters either, as their individual views and behaviour radically changed according to their circumstances and personal revelations.  Kouji's initial stoicism was pitted against Ikumi's emotional urgency to act.  Aires Blue's blunt dictatorship of fear could be compared to Stein's complicated and strict systematic control by hierarchical segregration and merit-based incentives.  All in all, this conflict was portrayed very well; offering the audience a mirror for which one could compare their own struggles within our real world societies.  Also, it cannot be left unsaid that the final episode of Infinite Ryvius was the perfect denoument to the series' climax; leaving the audience with both resolution and an sense that each character had undergone great personal change and evolution.

Overall, Infinite Ryvius is the perfect anime simply because it delivers what its title promises: a desire to keep revisiting the series long after it has been first watched...with each new viewing bringing out something new.  Thanks to Sunrise for bringing the manga to anime and thanks to the creators of Infinite Ryvius for a job well done.",1094342400,3,1801,5.306338028169014
