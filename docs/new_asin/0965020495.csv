Each DVD has a step by step guide for a Powerful Meditation. Each DVD allows for an individual to focus on a color sphere representing the Disciple and its' principle power. The chromatic visual is something to behold! The meditation is tricky but with practice one can master it. However, I've learned to hold the sphere in my mind's eye..... Now What? There has to be a part two to this....... When will it be available? This clip is a shortened version of approximately 20 minutes of video. Therefore the clip is a little choppy. But I hope you get a feel for the real product. This is something else.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twelve-Fold-Power-Soul/dp/0965020495/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twelve Fold Power Soul</a>
