2692080,5,B000KJU16E,"Comparison's with the new HELLBOY ANIMATED cartoon are inevitable for this release, but hands-down, HEAD is the winner. It's funny, in the Hellboy supplements, everyone falls all over themselves to stress that Mike Mignola did not want the artwork to look like his singular style. On the doc for HEAD, one the guys relates Mignola's mandate: ""Make it like the book"". Whatever the real story, HEAD succeeds where HELLBOY fails because it does stay true, not only to Mignola's visual style, but also his strange rhythms, sense of humor, and love of all things ""pulp"". HELLBOY fails, in mho, because they want to turn him into a cartoon superhero that will sell action figures. They just don't get it, do they? I'd LOVE a SCREW-ON HEAD figure!

I hope that the sales for this release will show Sci-Fi, or whomever is in charge of future episodes, that there are fans out there dying to see more. I'd be happy even if they were direct to video releases. I've watched my copy several times since Tuesday, and everyone I've shown it to (even people who'd never heard of Mignola, Hellboy, or anything from that universe) have come away loving it. The dvd is a great little package, and the price is right. Support this release so we can get more!",1170979200,3,1239,4.657534246575342
2692081,5,B000KJU16E,"I usually hate comic book adaptations. The animation never lives up to the art on the page. This adaptation is truly different. It is indeed the comic book come to life. I've never seen Mignola's style (or any other artist's, for that matter) so faithfully represented on the screen. If you are a fan of the book, or a fan of Mignola's, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection. It is dynamic, moody, dark, scary and whimsical all at the same time. It expands upon the comic without changing its smart and ridiculous tone.

If you have never heard of the comic but are a fan of ridiculous, offbeat humor, this is also for you! If you like Monty Python, Chris Elliot, Mr. Show, Adult Swim or consider yourself a fan of ""cult classics,"" you will really dig this. If you love the way anime looks, you'll love it. If your favorite sitcom is Friends, it might not be for you.

The performances are great. The art is great. The writing is smart and funny. I really can't say enough good things about it. I know I'm gushing, but something like this doesn't come around very often. Give it a chance and you'll understand what I mean.",1170806400,7,1124,4.399038461538462

I wish Sci-Fi would have picked it up, the pilot was brilliant--It's faithful to the comic but different enough in all the right ways. I'm a big Mignola fan and I loved it, as did my friends who haven't read the book. If you're a fan of zombies smoking professors in giant bongs... On that note, David Hyde Pierce's Emperor Zombie is masterful, it couldn't have been better. Five stars all the way!",1170806400,5,469,4.280898876404494

Set in the Civil War, Screw-On Head is a mechanical head that works for Abe Lincoln as a sort of Agent Mulder who hunts down supernatural threats against America. He has to fight the charasmiatic Emperor Zombie from resurrecting an ancient demi-god. Aside from the robot bodies that Head rides around in, other cool steam-tech includes a chamber that converts people into smoke.

I loved every second of it.
If I had to put it in just a few words I would say......brutally silly

If you like Hellboy (which was created by the same guy), Screw-on-head features a similar style of humor cranked up to eleven. It's sci-fi / mythology camp at its finest, and I definitely would have tuned in every week to see more of it. It's become somewhat of a cult favorite in my school's animation club, and since the DVD is only a few bucks your wallet won't hurt if you give it a try!",1305417600,,524,4.303030303030303

What's not to love about a maniacal zombie butler mastermind and his machine gun toting monkey? I couldn't get enough of the steampunk teleconferencing with Abraham Lincoln. Award-winning Writer and Artist Mike Mignola proves yet again that he doesn't need to resort to Big Red in order for his stories to be wildly entertaining.",1302480000,,473,5.076923076923077
2692094,4,B000KJU16E,"The first thing I have to mention for this video is that the price is rather high considering you get a 20 minute video and no much else.

I have never read the comics for Screw on Head, though I am a big Hellboy fan. And any other Hellboy fan will be right at home with the far out story, crazy characters, interesting alternate history and snappy dialog of this video. Which is fitting since it is writen by the creator of the Hellboy series.

The Amazing Screw On Head is based in the American Civil War era as a sort of precursoe to the BPRD of the modern Hellboy series. The characters are just at outlandish and the dialiog is very snappy and fun. While you will see some similarities between Mike's other comics you don't need to read of understand any of them to enjoy this film. The only problem I had aside from price is that is very short and there is only one. I'd love to see more animated features with Screw on Head. The character is funny and strangly believable for, well a screw on head. The alternate history has a pseudo steam punk film to it, in that it has many pieces (aside from a screw on head and robot boddies) that did not exiest in the 1860s time frame.

I enjoyed this very much. If you have enjoyed any of Mike Mignola's other comics or animated films then you will probably enjoy this video as well. Considering the price it might be a much better rental than purchase though.",1270080000,,1408,4.285714285714286
2692095,5,B000KJU16E,"Based on the one-shot comic of the same name by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellboy/dp/1593079109/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellboy</a>&nbsp;creator Mike Mignola, ""The Amazing Screw-on Head"" is an absolute masterpiece of droll, offbeat humor and, stylish low-rent animation.  It was created as a pilot for a possible series on the Sci-Fi channel, and it's one of cult entertainment's greatest travesties that it was not picked up.  It was, however awesome enough to warrant a full DVD release of the single 22-minute episode. Thank God for that.  Then ask him to smite the evil cable execs that killed this show. Smite them good! This could have easily been the best thing on television.

So how much wonderfulness can be crammed into 22 minutes?  Well how about vampire hotties, werewolves, robots in love, zombie supervillains, giant demon demigods, heroic stuffed dogs, Abraham Lincoln, evil zeppelins, smoking people in giant bongs to gain their knowledge, manservants named Mister Groin, machine-gun toting monkeys, and turnips with alternate universes inside of them?  Any of that float your boat?  Good Lord, this cartoon is gonzo.

The art is pretty minimalist and quite literally looks like Mignola's art just jumped onto your television and came to life.  Can't do better then that.  The dialogue is hysterically funny.  So much so that I'm tempted to cut and past entire scenes of dialogue here because it is so funny, but that doesn't make for a very interesting review does it?  Besides, the performances and timing are what really sell it. The cast are a dream team of straight-faced comedy including David Hyde-Pierce and Molly Shannon.

With only a 13-minute making-of featurette as a standout special feature, this DVD is pretty damn skimpy for a full-price release.  That said, I'm rating this based on how much fun I had during the very brief running time, which was tons.  Anybody looking for something very different and funny in the weirdest possible sense needs to give this one at least a rental.  It's pretty much laugh-a-minute stuff and did I mention vampires, werewolves, zombies, demons, robots, and goddamn machine-gun toting monkeys?  I suppose I did.  Well, then I suppose these last two paragraphs have just been a waste of both of our times.  Well, let me just wrap this up then with a quick ""thanks Queen B"" and let you get to hunting this show down.  THANKS QUEEN B!!!!",1247788800,2,2453,5.241025641025641
2692096,3,B000KJU16E,"Mike Mignola's The Amazing Screw-On Head had original illustrations, smart humor, and a cast of unique characters, Paul Giamatti did great on the voice work as did Molly Shannon and David Hyde Pierce, yet all of these things were not executed very well.
 I found myself lost many times, and the beginning of the short made absolutely no sense. I wouldn't mind giving it another shot if there were more episodes, but since there is only one pilot episode, you get lost and stay lost.",1243123200,2,482,4.670588235294118
2692097,4,B000KJU16E,"THE AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD is everything you could hope for and more; it's funny, creative, and excitingly original. Even if you are not an animation fan you may very well find yourself wishing that there were more than one episode of this show to enjoy, but alas there is not. Why no one has picked it up as a series remains a mystery to me.

The story concerns the titular character who is a top spy for President Abraham Lincoln. Although his body has been destroyed his brain was preserved in the aforementioned screw-on metallic head which can then be attached to whatever specially equipped robot body best serves his needs. He's aided by his manservant Mr. Groin and his faithful (though inanimate) dog Mr. Dog.

His assignment this time is to locate and stop the evil Emperor Zombie who is trying to gain control of a fabled jewel (or fruit) which house a Cthulhu-esque demon that will enable him to threaten all life on earth. Can our hero stop Zombie and his mistress, who was once Screw-on's own true love?

The story has some wonderful little twists and turns and laughs and surprises.  The voice talents are perfectly cast with David Hyde Pierce giving Emperor Zombie a delightfully droll reading and Paul Giamatti as Screw-on is constant state of excitement.  The animation itself  is just like reading a comic book, nearly static--but in this case that isn't a bad thing at all.

Check it out. You'll thank me.",1233532800,,1424,4.694779116465863
2692098,4,B000KJU16E,"When the world needs help against supernatural forces who answers the call, but The Amazing Screw-On Head. If you like Hellboy and just general weirdness
then you'll LOVE this movie! Screw-On Head (Paul Giamatti), hired by Abe Lincoln, to stop the evil Emperor Zombie (David Hyde Pierce) from achieving
an ancient artifact! Oh yeah, he'll probably take over the world with it.
A very short film, I would say get it for a really good price.

To sum it up.

Pros: Wonderful voice acting,
Superb animation,
Great story line,
Very funny writing.

Cons: Not as long as expected (like I said),
Can sometimes be confusing (if you came a couple minutes in).

But I would recommend this to people who love Hellboy or things like that.",1232582400,,725,4.73015873015873
2692108,5,B000KJU16E,"This cartoon pilot based on a single shot comic by Mike Mignola, the creator of Hellboy, is quite possibly the best work he has ever done.  It is all about a robotic head that protects the United States from supernatural threats.  If that sounds appealing just you wait, in this movie you will encounter Abe Lincoln, a monkey with a machine gun, a zombie voiced by David Hyde-Peirce, and a Demi-God that has been trapped in an onion for two thousand years.  It is certainly an entertaining romp through fictional Civil War America and the ending will leave you wanting more.  This item is any fanboy's dream, and I highly recommend it to everybody else.",1231891200,2,653,4.6521739130434785
2692109,5,B000KJU16E,"Wow - this is absolutely brilliant. I was wary of renting this, as I had no idea as to what kind of thing this was, other than animated. Was it primarily action? Adventure? Horror? Mystery? No clue, but I rented it anyway and it is absolutely weird and hilarious and amazing to look at. Very much like something you'd see on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim but light years better than 90% of that stuff. Great, funny script, really interesting style to the animation (faithfully adapting Mike Mignola's original art), and the voice work is amazing - Paul Giamatti, David Hyde Pierce and Molly Shannon are all so funny and really breath life into their roles. I didn't know this is essentially a pilot for the Sci-Fi Channel or that it is a mere 22 minutes long (with a couple of nice extra features tro round it out), so I hope someone else either picks it up as a series or that the DVD does well enough to justify a direct-to-DVD sequel of some kind, because I loved it.

This film took a bit for me to understand, but I was laughing myself silly by the end of it.  I won't describe the plot, because several others have explained it far better than I could.  It's intelligent, campy, and fun.  If I had seen the pilot on the SciFi channel, I would have voted to develop the series.",1193875200,,393,4.492957746478873
2692115,4,B000KJU16E,"For any Mignola fans you must see this.  For those of you that are not, this is a creepy little take on historical fiction. The animation works well for this and has that hellboy feel to it. This short is hysterically funny and witty and much to savvy and cutting edge for American audiences that really don't like too much that falls left of fart jokes and people falling down while their family member catches it on video.  This would make a great series if they could have found an audience.  Great voice over work and cast really made this one a keeper.  There is only one episode on this DVD but worth it if you're a fan of these types of works by people much more creative than you or I",1189468800,2,692,4.21969696969697
2692116,5,B000KJU16E,"Through-out the pages of picturesque fantasy, Mike Mignola has to be one of the most brilliant storytellers ever to put pen to paper. I say that because of his understanding of so many elements of what a story comprises; he has a handle on characterization, a mind that knows how to mingle mythos with a world people understand, and he has a style that people recognize and that has become a signature piece that people either love or dislike. People familiar with his work on Hellboy will immediately recognize this piece, and people familiar with Mignola's story The Screw-On Head will notice that this is simply it placed on a beautifully-conceived DVD. People who are not should know that Mignola likes to create something akin to a fairytale, add in dashes of Pulp icons and more pieces of this-and-that where to keep you on your toes and to make you laugh when you really don't expect it, and really earn the name he has been building for himself.

For anyone that has not heard of the concept on this short (notice the word short) piece, the character Screw-On Head is something of a National Security asset that keeps the States safe from things that would make a person go mad if they knew such things existed. Utilizing cutting edge technology in the time of Lincoln, Head does battle with monsters and former sidekicks and with beasts that want to enter the planes we know as sanity and introduce humanity to a world of... well, let's just say it isn't the world of plush puppies and Hello Kitty. The things encountered are rather odd, too...a black hole containing an ancient god contained within radish says a lot for what you encounter. The humor is absolutely brilliant there. The character is pretty funny, too, being a head that, well, screw on. You get the idea.

If you do not mind the length (you should know it is VERY short), see the art style and find it appealing, and just want something to entertain you because it is entertainment at its best then you should check it out. Fans of Hellboy (more the comic than the movie) should stop here for a taste and people who find articulate zombie butlers bent on killing every butler a person has afterwards as some kind of private payback joke funny should try it on as well. It really will surprise you if given a chance.",1177459200,5,2291,4.599022004889975

I'm happy to say, this animated version is equally as entertaining. The animation, unlike the Hellboy animated movie that came out recently, is Mike Mignola's artwork literally translated into animation. Absolutely fantastic. Panels are taken directly from the comic and basically the ""area's between"" are filled in seamlessly. All the humor, both the obvious and the subtle, are also present and will have you laughing out loud. The cast is all terrific, especially Paul Giamatti as Screw-On Head and David Hyde-Pierce as the dreaded Emperor Zombie. The bonus mini-documentary is really interesting as well, containing interviews with the creative team, including Mike Mignola.

The Tick, Greg the Bunny, Andy Richter Controls the Universe (shame on Fox), all met their demise after a single season.  Unfortunately for The Amazing Screw-on Head, and for the people who enjoyed it, the pilot is as far as it went.

The original concept created by Mike Mignola (Hellboy) is a lot of fun.  I won't go into the plot as it is more fun to watch than have explained to you but the robot, vampire, zombie love triangle is fantastic.  A relationship that spans nearly 200 years.  And to throw Lincoln in as the president is a so-cool-it's-perfect idea.  You've really never seen anything like this.  And thanks to the pilot not getting enough positive votes, this is your only chance.

The behind the scenes short doc on this is really informative and pains me even more that this series wasn't given a chance.  I think watching it drove home that the crew behind this really cared and were well suited for the job.  It's hard to imagine what could have been but I can imagine this series could have grown a decent sized cult following had more been made.

Overall, I liked it a lot and enjoy it as a short animation, but I guess I will have to search for The Amazing Screw-on Head on my next trip to the comic shop to satisfy my craving for more.  I can honestly say this is the first time I bought something that Amazon had recommended to me upon seeing it at the buy/use/trade store and I'm very happy I did.

The voice talent -- Paul Giamatti, David Hyde Pierce, Molly Shannon, and Patton Oswalt -- is a dream team, sufficiantly spooky, grandiose and stupid all at the same time.

2692123,5,B000KJU16E,"Mike Mignola doesn't invent your typical run-of-the-mill hero.  Nor does he set their adventures in the everyday world or even a world most readers accept as everyday.  Instead, he gifts his fans with side treks through strange and unknown places.

Most everyone knows about Hellboy, his premiere creation.  The comic has done well and continues, and has even spun off sequels.  The movie franchise is gearing up for a second movie.

THE AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD is a prequel of sorts to Hellboy.  Taking place in the 1860s, the story provides something of a history for the action in the pages of the Hellboy comics and movies.

The artwork of the 22-minute feature shows Mignola style.  Heavily inked, edgy characters, and with some of the color drained away to make the artwork look more severe and stark, THE AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD looks as though it exploded right out of the pages of a comic.

The dialogue is a hoot.  Fabulously twisted, anchored in today's world with tongue firmly in cheek, the characters speak and act in a mix of 19th and 21st century actions.  The strange machinations take root and spread across the screen, offering a visual treat at every turn.  A case in point is when President Lincoln refers to a man who was kidnapped by ""two old women and a monkey.""  Of course, one of those old women also turned out to be a werewolf.

Since there is only the 22-minute episode and special features that almost double the viewing time on the disc, THE AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD may seem pricy to some.  But Mignola fans and people who have heard about the show are going to step up and pay it anyway.

I had a blast with the episode.  So did my 9-year-old, who loved the jokes and repartee.  Buy this one out of love, not economics.  I promise, you'll watch it more than once.  And if you do, you've already doubled your return on your initial investment!",1172793600,3,1868,4.6

Mignola served as art director, which explains why the short film looks almost exactly like the comic.

THE AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD is the pilot that was made in hopes of a continuing television series (and I'm still hoping). THE AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD, based on Mike Mignola's one shot comic book effort of the same title, tells the exploits of Abraham Lincoln's robotic secret agent who unflaggingly combats the nation's occult evil. The titular character is pretty self-explanatory (but I'll explain anyway). Screw-On Head is basically a detached mechanical head with a threaded neck which can screw on any number of mechanical bodies.

The quick plot summary: The year is 1862 and Screw-On Head's undead nemesis and former manservant Emperor Zombie has ordered the Museum of Dangerous Books and Papers breached and its Expert on Ancient Evil Text kidnapped. Of course, the nasty plot involves an ancient manuscript, a vampire, a werewolf, and an entity of Lovecraftian proportions. It's up to the polybodied protagonist, his dog Mr. Dog, and his current manservant Mr. Groin to stop the fly-infested rotter and foil his scheme of world domination.

Apparently, Mike Mignola was fiddling around with a concept for a toy and arrived with Screw-On Head as the ideal action figure plaything, which then evolved into a comic book. He sure as shucks didn't expect to win the 2003 Eisner Award for Best Humor Publication. But the one shot Dark Horse comic book proved to be so popular that it spawned this television pilot, drawing a top notch voice cast and a dedicated group of artists and animators who all admired Screw-On Head and made this a labor of love. Speaking of the voice cast, the textured tones of Paul Giamatti and David Hyde Pierce are simply perfect and hilarious as, respectively, the earnest Screw-On Head and the evil-for-evil's sake Emperor Zombie. Both actors, with their mellifluous tones, contribute a certain dash of cultured quality to their lines. But, hell, even the evil demi-god sounded good.

Just a bit about the special features. Not too surprisingly, they're scanty: a pretty dull audio commentary by the Director and the Writer/Executive Producer (who here used up their lifetime quotas of shout-outs), ""From Comic to Cartoon"": the 13-minute-long making-of featurette, and a storyboard comparison. The dvd package also comes with a handbook of design sketches. You know, come to think of it, for a 22 minute feature, the extras aren't too shabby...

The animators strove to cling to Mike Mignola's style and pulled it off marvelously, I thought. In fact, there are scenes in the show that were pulled straight out from the pages of the comic book. But Mignola's fascination with shadows and gloomily baroque renderings are captured to a T here (unlike in HELLBOY: SWORD OF STORMS), making for a truly atmospheric episode. These 22 minutes are jam-packed with devastating humor and off-the-wall conceits (a turnip which holds a demi-god, a victim imprisoned in a giant hookah who is then smoked, a heavy artillery-toting simian, etc.). In its bizarre sensibilities, the closest thing I can think of to match THE AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD is Nick Pollotta's zany yet serious book BUREAU 13: DAMNED NATION, another Civil War-era, horror/adventure product with prominent cameos by our sixteenth president. But, admittedly, for outrageous originality, it's hard to top THE AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD as it's truly one of the most unique things I've seen on screen. Fully recommended!",1171152000,23,3653,5.093489148580968

I've already convinced a bunch of random nerds to watch it with me and everyone laughs. Paul Giamatti's awesome, the rest of the actors ace it, and seeing my favorite artist's art brought to life is surreal- I've wanted to see Mignola in animation form for so long now, and I had no idea! All the characters are hysterical, and my I'm way too optimistic but I might even watch it a third danged time someday.

8157370,5,B000KJU16E,"If, like me, you liked Hellboy largely because of Mignola's otherworldly drawing style and sense of humor, don't pass this up.

He illustrates every story in the book, and beautifully. While the tales themselves eschew the full apocalyptic gravitas of Mignola's main title, they do have the giddy fun and tight plotlines of the early Hellboy works, which I have to say are sadly lacking in the unending, bleak grind of the BPRD universe. Instead, where big plots unfold, they're sewn up nicely by the end of the tale, and though our heros' time on the stage is brief and comical, it still manages to be poignant without cheap sentimentality.

8157376,5,B000KJU16E,"When Abraham Lincoln needs help, he calls on his supernatural secret agent -- the Amazing Screw-On Head, his capable manservant Mr. Groin and his trusty stuffed Dog.

Half the people who read that sentence just left this page, and the other half are probably preparing to buy the DVD just based on that description. Half those people are wrong, because ""The Amazing Screw-On Head"" is a delightfully twisted little animated short, complete with a perky zombie supervillain, a Lovecraftian horror, a turnip and a steampunk automaton.

When the minions of Emperor Zombie (David Hyde Pierce) snatch Professor Fruen and the Kalakistan Fragment, Abraham Lincoln calls on Amazing Screw-On Head (Paul Giamatti) to stop his archenemy from unleashing untold evil on the world. Apparently the Fragment tells how to access the ancient temple of Gung and unleash ""the horror"" on America -- ""and by America, I mean the world!""

So while Emperor Zombie literally smokes Professor Fruen, Screw-On Head apprehends Zombie's vampire minion/girlfriend Prudence (Molly Shannon)... who also happens to be his ex-girlfriend as well. Can a patriotic head with countless bodies and severe trust issues triumph over Emperor Zombie and ""the horror"" hidden within Gung's temple? It's possible!

""The Amazing Screw-On Head"" was originally a pilot for the Sci-Fi Channel, back when it WAS the Sci-Fi Channel.  And it sums up everything I adore about Mike Mignola's graphic novels -- it has steampunk and Lovecraftian horror mixed up with insanely funny dialogue (""I think your forbidden evil is fresh as a daisy!"") and quirky characters.

Despite ""the horror,"" this is very much a comedy. Pretty much everything is played for laughs, and no character is handled seriously -- even the scene where Emperor Zombie cold-bloodedly murders a man is absolutely hilarious (think a giant hookah!). The story is a pretty short one, clocking in at only about twenty minutes, but almost every line is funny (""Free at last from my vegetable prison!"").

And of course, the characters are awesome as well -- Giamatti puts just the right amount of pompous patriotic enthusiasm into Screw-On Head, who has some serious trust issues. And Pierce is just a perfect Emperor Zombie: he's so incredibly perky and chatty about his evil plans, even talking to the Demigod about the proper way to spread ""horror"" across the world (""Also an army of the undead."" ""Ooh, I always wanted one of those...""). He's delightful.

""The Amazing Screw-On Head"" is every bit as fun as its title would imply -- the quirkiness is off the chart, with lots of dark comedy and enjoyable characters. It's just a shame it never went to series.",1363996800,,2666,5.08466819221968
