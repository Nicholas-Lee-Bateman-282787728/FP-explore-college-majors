XXXIV was one of the great Super Bowls of all time, to the point it actually has a nickname (""The Longest Yard""). So what do we get with this product? Yet another NFL Films documentary with the usual ""belly button view"" of just some of the plays, a forced narrative crafted by some writer to go with the assembled clips replacing actual game context), dramatic ""voice of God"" narration, and cheesy NFL Films music (to be fair, not as bad as that music once was back in the 1970s and before). When NFL Films first got started back in the mid-1960s with ""Football Follies"", the pitch was ""see the game a different way"". I get it. But only as a supplement to and NOT as a substitute for the actual game. This is like buying a major film such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" but opening the case and finding only the bonus disc with ""making of"" featurette, trailers, and some interviews, but not the actual film. As such, my reaction to this is about the same as would be my reaction to that.",1517356800,,1073,4.316831683168317

8549926,1,B00AC6HBPO,"I grew up in Los Angeles and so was a passive Rams fan who got active for their magical 1999 season at St. Louis. I bought the excellent Rams 1999 VHS (still available on Amazon) which is everything a season and superbowl review tape should be: extensive game-by-game highlights, preseason and postseason analysis and footage, plus special features focusing on the two biggest stars, Kurt Warner and Marshall Faulk. But VHSs have gone the way of cassette decks, and both my machine and my copy of this great tape are now useless. I kept thinking, surely the greatest one-season turnaround in NFL history and greatest Super Bowl finish of all time will be re-issued as a DVD. So when this disk became available, I ordered as soon as I saw it.

What a rip-off. Apparently, the NFL Network couldn't resist throwing just any excuse of a Rams 1999 season review together, to squeeze one last bit of cash out of hopeful fans like me. And what a disappointment that Kurt Warner, Dick Vermiel and D'Marco Farr let themselves be used in this way.  This DVD consists of interviews where you look at the handsome faces of the three hosts telling the story, with the barest minimum showing of it: highlights (and very few plays) from six or seven regular season games and then the playoffs and Super Bowl. The 1999 Rams were the most spectacular scoring machine the NFL had ever produced, but you won't see it here: you'll just have to take the word of the narrators.

The biggest sin in this DVD (among many) is effectively ignoring the single most important defensive play in Super Bowl history. Unheralded Rams linebacker Mike Jones' game-saving solo tackle on the last play of the game was a triumph of a veteran's instinctive reaction stopping a cunningly designed and disguised underneath slant pass to the Titan's slippery slot receiver Kevin Dyson. Rams lead 23-16, first and goal Titans at the Rams ten yard line, six seconds on the clock. A Titan TD will tie the game and force overtime. Titan QB Steve McNair passed complete to Dyson on the five yard line. Jones, initially fooled into covering a tight end who was lined up in front of the in-motion slot receiver at the instant the ball was snapped, intuitively broke off from the decoy at the goal line, and hustled back to nail Dyson on the one yard line as time expired. In an interview afterwards Jones stated that he never saw the pass but felt it, and that he knew Dyson had the ball because ""I saw his eyes get big."" How do I know so much about this play? Easy. It's extensively analyzed, as it should be, in NFL Films' 40 Year Super Bowl collection. But in this sorry NFL Network DVD, this once-in-history championship-defining tackle on the last play of the Super Bowl is barely shown, and not even minimally analyzed. Mike Jones' name is never mentioned. In contrast to NFL Films' detailed look at how the pick play was set up, run and foiled by Jones, what we get from this DVD is D'Marco Farr ignoring Jones' tackle and instead telling us how tired the defense was.

The list of unforgivable omissions and substitutions of verbal padding for substance goes on and on. The whole DVD is basically an exercise in making up for minimal actual football footage. Dear NFL Network: fans tune in to the NFL for the game action. Interviews can be interesting additions, but they should be a supplement to game footage and never a substitute for it.",1363392000,21,3401,4.635157545605307
