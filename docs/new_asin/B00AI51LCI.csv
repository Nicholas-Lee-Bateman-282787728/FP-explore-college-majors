8551855,4,B00AI51LCI,"The 1930 version of ALRAUNE has been considered a lost film for many years and generally inferior to the 1928 version...both of which starred Brigette Helm as Alraune. This DVDr copy has subtitles which I believe are in Afrikannes (sp?)...the title is listed as ""ALRUNE"" in the credits. The picture is soft and obviously from a second or third generation copy but still quite watchable with the complete sound track. If only Criterion or another film-angel could re-master and subtitle the two Helm versions of this story and release them as a package, I'd be a much happier man. Notice that the cover art is from the 1950s version of the story. I consider this to be well worth the price.",1371600000,2,689,4.702479338842975
