8508208,1,B0071BY1RO,"The write up says ""includes choreography for group veil dancing"" - it does not. It has a student group veil dance you can WATCH. Overall, I was underwhelmed by this video. There's a free YouTube video that is much more comprehensive, and did I mention free?

This video looks homemade and the lighting is horrible, making it extremely difficult to see detail. To add to that, the entire sequence is shown outdoors, with a blowing wind, so the veil is often thrown about, masking the moves and tangling it up in some instances. Some of the moves have aerial shots, which has, unfortunately, such bad camera shake that it makes you dizzy to watch it.

There are chapters for different moves with names such as Bullfight, Frames, Wrap, Sandwich. The only plus I can give is that Thacker occasionally gives some interesting combinations for using the veil, adding hip movements or steps to the veil movement. However, you have to sit through all the negatives outlined above to find the few gems, as not all of the movements go well with the veil, and in some instances her editing (voice) does not match the filmed movements.

Neither the artist's performance nor the student choreography make this video worth buying. The student choreography has half the students standing on the sidelines waving their veils as they watch the other half either dance (no veil) or stand waving the veil around. It's a great student piece for students. I'm not so sure it should be for sale for public consumption and actually advertised! If I'd discovered it as part of the video, it would have been fine, but to have it written up and then be such a disappointment was a bigger disappointment. To add insult to injury, I bought this video especially because I wanted the promised choreo. Even if it was included, I wouldn't use it, so it's a major bust.",1492732800,,1836,4.713395638629284
