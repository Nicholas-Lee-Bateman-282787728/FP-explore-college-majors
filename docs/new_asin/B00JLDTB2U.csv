6379878,5,B00JLDTB2U,"I am so thrilled that Season 2 is coming out this coming Tuesday (Aug. 26th)! I loved this show back in the mid-'80's when it 1st aired! I watched it every Wednesday night. It ran from '85 to '89, so I was 10 years old when it started & 14 when it ended. Even @ only 10, I was able to appriciate the plots, twists, & was able to see that it was a high-quality show, w/ top-notch acting from Woodward, & everyone else involved! I was also a fan of ""The Police"" @ a young age, so I loved that Drummer Stewart Copeland scored the series! When Season 1 was released in Feb of 2008, I was overjoyed! It was about time, I thought. But then the years passed & there were no more DVD Sets being put out. I was grateful to own Season 1, but I really wanted the subsequent Seasons, as well! Fast fwd. to earlier this year & I see that it's now a big-screen release starring Denzel Washington as Robert McCall. But the Film is taking some major liberties from the show's premise! In April, I saw here on amazon.com that Season 2 was slated for release this Summer. I thought if the only good that the Film does is get the Sutdios to release the DVD BoxSets for Seasons 2, 3, & 4, then that's great in & of itself! So I Pre-Ordered it & will have it (hopefully) on Tuesday. I chose the shipping that gets it delivered on it's release day. & I'm really looking forward to the last 2 Seasons to be released. This show is classic & I'm happy to see that it still has a following!",1408665600,4,1464,4.086805555555555

I MISS HIM VERY MUCH,  AS  A  ACTOR AND FRIEND, I HAVE THE FIRST SEASON,  AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEASON 2 ,  AND I AM SURE UNIVERSAL WILL RELEASE SEASON 3  AND 4  THE QUALITY AND SOUND,  IS GREAT AND WELL WORTH THE COST , AND AT LEAST,  UNIVERSAL IS  NOT BREAKING UP THE SETS LIKE  CBS/FOX  I ADIVISE ALL FANS AND COLLECTORS TO PURCHASE THIS FINE SERIES",1407715200,5,722,4.0359712230215825
6379880,5,B00JLDTB2U,"Who you gonna call, Why McCall of course.  The show itself, is dark yet gratifying in so many ways. In short McCall a man burdened by many demons of the past, uses his skills to help those whom the authorities cannot or will not help. His methods not necessarily bound by the laws that protect and serve the guilty, well he gets results. I love this show, and you will too, if you like to see the perverted, oppressive, masochist of the world get what they deserve.

6379905,2,B00JLDTB2U,"The first season was much better.  This season does not seem as polished and frankly the son is very irritating (plus the actor seems not very good).  Edward Woodward is a great actor but does not seem so here; thus I think it is the directing and the script writing.

Also, it's nice to see people who were just starting their careers, but have since become established. Edward Woodward is excellent as is most of the supporting cast, especially those who played Mickey and Jimmy. It was nice to capture some of my past by watching these still entertaining shows, If you like Person of Interest, as I do, it's nice to see one of the shows that inspired it.",1428883200,,480,4.528735632183908

I know some of the reviewers complained about the quality of the Season 2 DVDs, but we have watched 4 episodes and so far only the 1st episode was a bit lacking in picture quality. But there is a notice when you first insert the DVD that this might happen, so we were forewarned. At any rate, it did not bother us enough to keep us from enjoying watching it again.  But I guess if you are really unable to overlook a minor flaw, then you might not enjoy it.  However, we have no qualms about ordering Season 3 next.",1424563200,,607,4.17948717948718

6379943,3,B00JLDTB2U,"I already purchased and watched Season 1 of the Equalizer so I bought Season 2 as well.  Not the best transfer quality on this season 2 dvd set and the dvd does warn of that before the menu arrives.  There is no Close Captions as there was on season 1.  I could not play episode 3 of the show at all as it paused and stuttered too much before and after I cleaned the disc.  Other than episode 3 ( a Community of Civilized Men) all the other episodes played fine with a slight hitch here and there of no consequence or big deal.  Please do not pay more than $15 or $20 for the set as that price is the most I would pay now that I watched the whole season so I am trying to save you some $$$$$ if you listen.  Honestly, $15 or less is what I would gauge as I have seen this whole season and know the quality but that is just my informed opinion.  Good show and some fine episodes in here but don't pay more than you want.  Hope that helps someone!  UPDATE!!!!  I did manage to watch episode 3 (A Community of Civilized Men) on my blue ray player and it worked fine.  When I played it on my pop-up portable dvd player it played as I stated earlier in my review.  So now I can say I have seen the whole season 2 and still would only recommend it at $20 or less.

6379989,5,B00JLDTB2U,"Edward Woodward's portrayal of the Equalizer was one of a kind.  It had quite a few guest actors that went on to become super stars.  You can get episode synopses from other reviewers, however it was sad that this show was canceled without any series finale.  I'd like to think that his partner, Keith Szarabajka took over when the Equalizer was forced to retire.  I really enjoyed this show and fans of classic TV should check this out.  It was a solid show and the character Woodward portrayed; Robert McCall, had a depth that you don't see in contemporary TV shows.  As far as some of the changed music due to licencing issues, it does little to affect the actual quality of the episodes.  The quality of the transfer isn't perfect, but what do you expect with a show that's almost three decades old?  I'd rather see this show in some form than not at all.  I'd like to see seasons three and four.  It was a show that was canceled very abruptly by CBS. It was made at a time when TV shows didn't always get a finale show to show you what happened to the main character.",1410998400,2,1072,4.341708542713568
6379990,5,B00JLDTB2U,I love Edward Woodward in this series...he gets the job done!!,1410998400,,62,4.7272727272727275
6379991,4,B00JLDTB2U,"I have been waiting many, many years for this second season to arrive on DVD.  For a relatively low cost set (about $15-20), it's decent, but what sticks out to me is that these episodes must have been taken from original broadcast master tapes, not the original film negatives.  Season one looks a whole lot clearer and sharper than this, and other releases of old Universal TV shows like Knight Rider, Miami Vice, Quantum Leap, and even early Law & Order seasons look leaps and bounds better than the image quality on this release.  The video is very soft lacking detail and clarity.  Even lower cost releases from budget DVD distributor Mill Creek, like the 21 Jump Street spin-off Booker, look better than this set.

The best indicator of this is that the season one DVD included a bonus episode from season two, ""Beyond Control.""  The episode looks VASTLY superior on the season one set because that was clearly taken from the original film negative.  On the season two set, you can barely see any of the film grain because the image is so soft and taken from a lower resolution source, which the DVDs have a disclaimer about.  Even the iconic opening title sequence looks superior on the season one DVD release.

Apparently, there are no closed captions for those that care, and zero extras.  Plus, numerous original songs featured in the series have been replaced with cover songs.  Since I never saw the episodes outside of this set, it does not bother me.  The packaging is great, really following well in line with Universal's release of season one from several years ago, but in a slimmer keep case, which I'm fine with.  The episodes are great, and I will enjoy this season thoroughly.  However, a little more effort and money put into presenting a higher technical quality in video presentation would have been greatly appreciated.",1410739200,16,1844,4.7760252365930596
6379992,5,B00JLDTB2U,So enjoyed watching these episodes.  Hope they come out with Season 3 soon.,1410652800,,75,4.769230769230769
6379993,5,B00JLDTB2U,"I love this series, and I hope seasons 3 and 4 come out before I die.  At the rate the DVDs are coming, maybe not.  I find the series admirable for several reason.  The stories are generally well written, well acted and have a clear moral center.  In other words, it's obvious from the get-go who are the villains and who are the good guys.  This is also one of the last television shows to take religious faith seriously and not automatically assume that if you have faith you must either be a hypocrite, a nut case or a moron.

Edward Woodward was a curious choice for this role, I think, but he portrays with some skill the character of a man who has killed and done very evil things and is now facing the qualms of conscience he ignored for too long.  In facing those qualms he is now seeking redemption, using his particular skill set to help others in crisis. In one of the episodes in the 2nd season someone accuses McCall of not changing at all - he's still killing people, but he can now absolve himself by believing it's for a better reason.  This is a fundamental question at the center of the show and that's why I think it is ultimately, not a crime show, but a modern morality play. This is not a profound series philosophizing about right and wrong, but it does take a position about right and wrong and that is very rare in American television post 1970.",1410393600,4,1370,4.32421875

6379995,3,B00JLDTB2U,"This review is on this particular release of season 2 by VEI. The Equalizer was one of my favorite shows back in the 80's and it's release on DVD is long overdue.  I am disappointed there are NO extras or CC or other language options.  Looks like a good transfer to me but still disappointed that its such a barebones set.  The show itself is definitely a 4 or 5 star show, the barebones release drags it down to a 3 star.  Shame we have waited this long for the 2nd and 3rd and 4th seasons to be released and all we get is barebones.  Hopefully Seasons 3 and 4 come out soon. And this whole music rights on TV shows is ridiculous.  Once you agree to let someone use your song on the show it should be allowed on the following reproductions, ie DVD.",1409788800,5,749,4.13103448275862

8652156,1,B00JLDTB2U,"The show deserves five stars but this collection is shoddy.
The first season by Universal had great transfers. The episodes on Season 2 (by a different production company) have heavy artifacts apparent through all of ""Prelude"" and looks like was transferred from a print (and a VHS print at that). I can't say anything for the other episodes because none of the others would play. They either skipped wildly, froze or just crashed my player. Very disappointing because I was really looking forward to this and later seasons.
If Universal ever puts out seasons 2,3 and 4, I will gladly buy but I finally returned this season set. Just not worth it even at the low price.",1478304000,,669,4.726495726495727
