1481559,3,B00005JLZK,"This, movie, I've heard, was an unplanned sequel. Rather than continuing a story planned from the start, it was an afterthought after the first FINAL DESTINATION was an unexpectedly surprise success. That means an uphill battle to make a good movie, since there was no pre-existing inspiration for an ongoing story, just the need to invent something to fill the unexpected call for a sequel. Some movie series are well sustained by sequels providing what is largely ""more of the same"", but this time something profoundly new needed to happen. The premise of the first movie, and also of this, is that death has a plan, that death is a sentient being that stalks its victims, and it is difficult or imopssible for one to escape the plan. If death had an accident with your name on it, but you somehow escaped THAT accident, you've probably won only a brief reprieve. Death will be back, and SOON, to stalk you with even a greater vengeance. Your days are still VERY numbered, except in the unlikely event that someone discovers the very elusive holy grail of thwarting death's formidable plan. Consequently, the first film had a low survival rate for major characters, with a final apparent reprieve for only a minority. The first movie was done well enough to be a success even with that grim premise. And it is a very grim and heavy premise, even for a horror thriller. What this second movie needed was at least some progress toward a clearer hint as to what a more definitive ransom from the grim reaper's grisly plan might be. But don't expect too much. This movie suffers from being too much of the same. It starts off revealing that the seemingly lucky few survivors of the other movie weren't all so lucky after all. Then it goes on to drop in a promise of a more hopeful way out this time around. That new hint calls for something about ""new life"", which can, we're told, send death's machinations back to square one. So the array of characters in this movie follow a lead on a hopeful trail to that resolution. But don't expect too much to really be resolved.
Movie series with a high death rate of characters risk killing off too many of their more colorful ones and having not enough of the better cast left to be all that memorable. And thus it is with this series so far. One would hardly have suspected that Sean William Scott would be a player to lend an air of intelligence to a movie. But in a relative sense, at least, such he was in the first FINAL DESTINATION. By letting his character be among the casualities on that original, this sequel was deprived of one of the more colorful possible characters, and the new cast of this does little to take up the slack. And don't expect the sequel to be any less wreckless about killing off the more colorful characters remaining.
Still, I hope there will be a third entry in the series. To leave the tale in its present lurch would be a further disappointment. Hopefully any such third entry will have the wisdom to bring the saga to a markedly more definitive progress in the quest for the secret of foiling death's monstrous appetite.",1050969600,4,3099,4.565529622980251
1481560,2,B00005JLZK,"Where Final Destination 1 was amazingly surprising and original I feel this second part was way over the top and nowhere near as original as the first one. Sure, some turns of events in this second part were very well thought of but part 1 is far more thrilling than this one. The whole feel of part 1 is more intense than this 'let's do the dame trick again'part 2. But... whatmakes buying the DVD REALLY worth your money is NOT the movie itself but the many, many, many special features!

1481692,4,B00005JLZK,"I see a lot of four and five star reviews for this one.  If you read my review on the first movie I gave that one four stars.  Now I've seen the series as it's been released on cable, never wanting to go to the theater and pay ticket prices for any of these since they'rw all kind of schlocky fun.. ""popcorn movies"" .  Unfortunately most were kind of forgettable to me, I knew the premise and a few of the actors and quite a few of the ""deaths"" but I couldn't really sort them out without going to imbd - should the need ever arise.  Well my son just got into them.  He will only watch movies in sequence and he asked me what was my favorite.. I told him that other than the first and the fifth the rest were kind of a blur (not the best sign in film making)..

That being said, the acting was probably on par with the first movie, and it was nice to see the continuation of more than just the theme by bringing back Clear Rivers.  The gore ratio and variety was fine (about the same).. there were actually a couple of fairly original and tense scenes that surpassed similar films.

So I guess this one gets a four as well.. watching the first isn't necessary but might help if you're really trying to make solid movie night of it.",1491264000,,1231,4.121338912133891

1481754,5,B00005JLZK,"This ranks at the top of the Final Destination series.

I remember seeing this movie very vividly. I had driven my friends to the theater so we could all watch this. We got a great audience that reacted with gasps and shocks and screams. The intro premonition set the tone of what was to come, and boy did this set the tone. Never before had anyone seen a car pileup in such horrific, and believable detail. That set piece alone should've won more awards.

I don't think anyone who's never seen this before will be able to view this introduction without looking away at some points. That's how visceral it was the first time watching. The rest of the movie is fun because everyone tries to figure out what will eventually kill a character. Will it be a pencil, some spaghetti, a tree branch falling on their head perhaps? The fact that there is no actual killer but Death itself means people could die in *any* way under any circumstance. I think that's what makes this series so fun.

When the movie ended, you have no idea how much I didn't want to drive at that point. You can bet I was really darn careful driving my friends and myself back home safely. For a thrilling ride, give it a watch today. Recommended.",1474502400,,1215,4.439461883408072

That said, it is due to the pile-up scene in Final Destination 2 that I will never, ever want to drive near a logging truck. I have come across these too often on highways and interstates to where Ive done whatever I could to put a great distance between me and the truck.

1481836,1,B00005JLZK,"I loved the first movie so I gave this one a shot but how quickly downhill this movie has become. In the first film Alex (Devon Sawa) took the time to read and analyze his visions on death and what could possibly happen to the victim that was next on death's list and he tried saving their lives.

The main girl in this one Kimberly (A.J. Cook) is lousy at trying to analyze her visions and clues. Let's analyze these clues that this idiot failed to read correctly. When she's visions of pigeons, her and Det. Burke (Michael Landes) run towards the dentists office where Nora (Lynda Boyd) and her son Tim (James Kirk) are leaving the dentist and she's yelling pigeons out towards them. Tim wasn't even worried about the pigeons until Kim opened her mouth and caused him to die. Next when the rest of the victims on death's list meet up at Burke's house to discuss this Nora and Eugene (T.C. Carson) leave and get on an elevator with a creepy old man holding a basket of hooks and doll parts. Rory (Jonathan Cherry) sees a shadow of a man with hooks which causes Clear (Ali Larter) to run out of the house to save her while Burke calls her on the phone and the first words out of his mouth is ""A man with hooks is going to kill you!"" WTF?? Being a cop you think he would have worded that differently like watch out for a man with hooks, stay clear of a man with hooks in a calm voice and not so panic stricken which ended up getting Nora killed cause they didn't warn her properly.

Kim also gives the victims cell phones and tells them that she'll call them and give them a clue that death is coming. She gives an example and says she'll call one of them up and will say 'Subway'. Rory looks at her like WTH does that mean and she says that means go somewhere wear a train wouldn't go. Girl, you're saying subway, someone could take that as going to Subway and buying a sandwich or go hide in the subway from oncoming death. Another vision Kim gets is Dr. Kalarjian killing Isabella (Justina Machado) by choking her to death. Really?? A doctor in a hospital full of other doctors is gonna choke and kill a pregnant woman in a hospital. Kim isn't realizing that doctors do perform CPR.

Anyways my point is she didn't take the time to think her clues out, she just immediately jumped to a conclusion which caused the death of some of the characters. Devon Sawa's character was more of a thinker like when he saw vision of a bus and a train he didn't panic and tell the victims to not get on a train or a bus, he actually thought about what could happen. This movie was a huge letdown.",1431475200,,2583,4.2673469387755105

1482052,4,B00005JLZK,"This is not a stand-alone movie. You really need to watch the first one to understand the references made throughout the movie about the survivors (and subsequently, victims) of Flight 180 & the connections they have to those who are now involved. Plus, Ali Larter (Clear) returns for this installment.

--  A log-hauler truck causes the deadliest highway pileup in the state's history and Kimberly foresees it at the on-ramp. She blocks traffic from merging onto the highway, effectively saving the lives of several people.

  Like a Rube Goldberg machine, you watch the domino effect... waiting to see just what kills the victim, only to be pleasantly surprised by something altogether unrelated. I think you have to have a darker, more twisted sense of humor to truly appreciate the thought that is put into these elaborate death scenes and enjoy them for the entertainment it truly is. This is not my favorite movie in the franchise, but it does contain two of my top 5 ""Best Deaths"" from the franchise. Although a few of the deaths can be a bit brutal in nature, I view the franchise as horror-comedy.

  I subtracted one star for the fact that although ""death's design"" is clearly outlined during the movie, it falters and deviates for no reason, taking one person completely out-of-turn. My husband, kids & I all debated the victim's death for almost 20 minutes with no sound reason or conclusion as to ""why"" they opted to do that. Yeah, I'll nitpick over that all day, but that really was the only negative thing I can say about the movie.

1482123,3,B00005JLZK,"Kimberly's terrifying premonition prevents her and a handful of other motorists from dying in a horrible accident on the highway, but the worst has yet to come when Death returns to settle the score! FINAL DESTINATION 2 ups the ante when it comes to shockingly outlandish deaths and the completely contrived scenarios in which they occur. While the basic plotline follows closely in line with the original, it becomes all the more convoluted and jokingly unrealistic when Kimberly begins using precognition to unravel Death's plan rather than simply relying on her instincts as Alex had done in the past. Still, that does not take away from the sheer enjoyment and surprise that each new death provides along the way. This first sequel packs some of the greatest moments in the series thanks to the continued use of clever misdirection leading in to each kill and the amplified gore over the original.

1482127,2,B00005JLZK,"Back in the late 90's, early 00's, the Slasher genre was huge.  Everyone was looking for new and intriguing ways to spin a tired plot into something teenagers would blow their parents money to see in the theaters.  The original `Final Destination' was actually pretty unique in tone and construction and let to a pretty impressive take on the genre.

Sadly, this sequel just doesn't live up to the original.

Cheating death has become an art form and it's up to Clear Rivers (seriously) to teach a bunch of dumb kids how to do it.  Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook, back when she had a career) has a vision of a massive car wreck and then narrowly avoids death, saving herself and her friends and then, well, they all start to die.  Yes, Death cannot be cheated entirely.  So, Kimberly seeks out Clear, who is in an institution, in order to learn her secret to survival (she's the only remaining member of the original group) and so starts this rather lazy sequel to a rather intelligent original.

The deaths are interesting and graphic and will serve as torture porn for those entertained by this sort of thing, but at the end of the day there just isn't any substance here, no real story, and the film dissolves into yet another excuse to watch people die.  The fact that the majority of this film is played off for comedic effect is also disheartening since the original really worked to create that eerie feeling that made it rewarding in the end.  This isn't `Scary Movie'.  I didn't want to watch a spoof and yet at times it feels like this is far too concerned with being funny that scary.  At least with a film like `Scream', you got a very smart balance of the two.  Here, you have glossy death scenes and nonsensical plot points (when they appear).  The acting is also pretty much not there.

At the end of the day, this was a waste of time and an insult to the original.",1354752000,,1876,4.46041055718475
1482198,4,B00005JLZK,The movie is awesome because it is different than the other movies in this series. The others' plots are just repetitive of this one,1353715200,,132,4.541666666666667
1482199,4,B00005JLZK,"On the way to a fun weekend a young lady named Kimberly (A.J. Cook, TV's ""Criminal Minds"") is in a car with friends about to get onto a highway, when she has a vision of a violent and destructive multi-vehicle accident which ends with her and her friends being killed. Of course seeing this Kimberly begins to freak out, blocks the cars from coming onto the highway and gains the attention of a nearby sheriff named Thomas (Michaels Landes, ""11-11-11""), who wonders what is wrong with her as she seems to be talking crazy (well to anyone who didn't see the vision she did). The accident ends up happening, her friends end up killed by a speeding car and she's traumatized as expected.

So because Kimberly had this vision and prevented several people from dying she has interrupted death's design, now death is coming for her and everyone who was supposed to die in that accident. There's the typical amount of cardboard cutout characters, who all seem to either not buy into this idea of death coming for them or they are panicking like crazy (like who wouldn't right). Oh and there's also Clear Rivers (Ali Larter, TV's ""Heroes"") who was the sole survivor from the first film (after Devon Sawa's character was explained away having died after the events of the first film ended) and Mr. Bludworth (Tony Todd, ""Candyman"") the mortician also from the first movie.

In comparison to the first movie this one was played more for laughs at times, the deaths are still pretty inventive, gruesome and bloody. The plot tries to be creative and layered but is pretty simple and the ending is hokey but funny too, I do give props to the director for the fantstic opening death sequence on the freeway, it was very well put together. I do think the adding of Clear's character was a bit of a stretch, but its always nice to see Todd as a creepy, moody character (like that's hard for him to pull off).

Sure its not as good as the first flick, but I enjoyed this sequel, it cut a good pace, great death scenes and a couple of good looking women certainly help. *** out of 4 stars.",1347148800,,2071,4.532085561497326
1482200,1,B00005JLZK,"My family rented this out of curiosity.  It's another pathetic slasher even worse than Sorority Row.  Basically death is after the protagonists who have  escaped it a number of times (again).  So what happens?  people die disgusting gruesome deaths every five seconds. The final protagonist drives her car into the water drowns and dies for a  little while  before being revived by doctors.  Everything seems fine and people happily talk at a family barbeque. but it turns out  that Brian, (the family's son) since he avoided being hit by a car earlier in the film is on death's list as well . He  goes over to check on the grill and explodes.  His arm landing directly on to his mother's plate.  STUPID pointless.  If you like death after death after death with NO real plot whatsoever  this is for you.  Flat characters EXTREMELY  predictable plot and deaths. I  predicted how everyone was going to die and was right 99 percent of the time. No  joke. It's THAT predictable.  I'm honestly baffled as to why they keep making sequels to such an awful plot.",1344470400,,1055,4.666666666666667

1482202,4,B00005JLZK,"Would a sequel to the original Final Destination work, when viewers already pretty much know what's going to happen?  Heck yeah, as long as you have a great cast, great writing, and a talented director.  Great special effects are just the icing on the cake - and this franchise can always be counted on to deliver some of the gnarliest deaths imaginable, from the simple to the most elaborate and cinematic.  Watching this film, you can't help but reflect on the fact that there are a bazillion ways to meet your death every single day, no matter how careful you are.  It's a wonder we live as long as we do.

It has been exactly one year since Flight 180 blew up on takeoff - and all of those who accidentally survived began their twisted tangoes with Death, who doesn't like to have his plans altered by sudden premonition-based acts.  Only one of those survivors still lives - Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), secluded inside a padded cell.  Now another young person, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook), has a terrible premonition of her own while waiting to get on a crowded freeway.  Rather than being thankful, most of the people she saves with her actions complain about the whole experience and scoff at the obvious similarities of the events of last year.  Of course, these people soon begin dying in noticeably bizarre ways.  This time, though, Death seems to be working backwards - as if trying to find a way to cheat Death again wasn't enough, Kimberly and the others have to figure out what kind of game Death is playing this time around.  Kimberly seeks advice and assistance from Clear Rivers, the great Tony Todd ramps up the macabre atmosphere of the circumstances in a wonderful cameo, and the inevitable debate over free will vs. fate among the survivors becomes academic rather quickly.

There is a nice level of complexity to what could have been a pretty simple storyline.  Those who escaped the freeway pile-up at the start of this movie are not as random as they would appear, as there is a very special link that ties them all together.  This sequel also introduces a new survival plan for those on Death's overdue appointment list - you have to have hope, you know.  Anyway, Death and the filmmakers would seem to have spared no expense when it comes to delivering little cinematic masterpieces of destruction that manage to impress even when you see them coming.  With the exception of one rather cheesy demise, the film showcases a number of a gory, ingenious, and (if you're as sick and twisted as I am) darkly comical deaths.  This really is a great series of films that could have gone south in a hurry with the first sequel.  Instead, Final Destination 2 is every bit as good - if not better - than the original film.",1322956800,,2736,4.629399585921325
1482203,4,B00005JLZK,"FINAL DESTINATION 2 is the follow up to the first, original FINAL DESTINATION.  Sequels, especially in thrillers or horror movies, are often very subpar compared to the original.  Many critics weren't too thrilled with this sequel but I find that it far surpasses the original.  The acting is better, atmosphere and thrills are better and more importantly it serves a purpose.  We never actually find out why death needs to correct itself in this series but FD2 does contiue ther story from the first with fresher and more interesting faces.  As for the blu ray, the original was a diasppointment but here with FD2 blu ray is put to all its best use.  The video is crip and clear with vivid colors and a clarity that pulls the viewer in.  The clarity is what was strongly missing with the original on blu ray.  The audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and it will knock your socks off.  Dialogue is  strong and present throughout and all surround speakers are put to great use when the action kicks up.  Atmospheric music is creepy and the build up of each killing scene will have you at the edge of your seat.

The opening sequence is a car crash and the visual and audio presentation on blu ray is quite stunning.  And the bar is raised for the rest of the film due to its superb presentation.  I give it 4 rather than 5 stars for the video is a little dark but believe me it still hits all the right notes.  Watching this excellent film in blu ray will have you jumping out of your skin and being pulled into very entertaining thrills and chills.  This film shows why blu ray was made.

1482205,4,B00005JLZK,"I do like this film a lot but the entire aspect of the first film was brilliantly put together and this one felt the same way but I do believe that they could've done more with it!

Plot: After a devastating car crash massacre the remaining survivors think there safe but one of them saw the crash before it actually happened.... and now as before they are starting to be killed one by one and the only one who can stop it is the one who sees each death and the crash before it occurred.... Her name is Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook ""Night Skies"".) Who will survive at there Final Destination!

Review: This film was only slightly over decent! It is definitely better that parts 3 and 4 but it can't compare to the original in the originality concept.... In some aspects though the film is rather cheesy and the guy in the elevators Chewbacca scream isn't exactly the best acting I've seen out of this series! The deaths were good but the special effects were only decent! The soundtrack in my opinion was forgettable but this movie was far gorier than part one! It is definitely a Thriller/Chiller and some scenes will make the hairs on the back of your neck stick way up! I had a good time watching it and I bet you will to!

Acting: I didn't know that Chewbacca had a part in this movie.. Oh wait... it's just that guy in the elevator who is screaming because a woman has just been decapitated right in front of his eyes! Now that I have insulted that scene enough I must say that the film's acting isn't terrible but it could've been better especially the mothers reaction to her sons death at the end what can I say... I'm a cruel critic... but I do believe it could've been much more real!

Gore: a body chopped into three sections with a barbed wire fence, a decapitation, some burnt/burning bodies, a ladder impaled into someone's eye, a body crushed by a giant glass pane, a head impaled on a spike, a severed arm and some more! Wicked fun, wicked graphic, wicked wickedness!

Bottom Line: A good buttery popcorn flick! It does lack some much needed aspects majorly a more original plot and story... but in the end it works!

Rated: ""R"" for strong violent/gruesome accidents, language, drug content and some nudity

All and All it was a ok movie but there were certain things about the plot that contradicated with the film.. but before i get to that why the hell did they kill of Devon Sawa aka Alex Browning? and not only that he died of a falling brick? come on now doesnt he deserve a better way to die? look at the first one.. it does not make sense.. and why kill of Clear Rivers aka Ali Larter.. its so stupid how they kill the main stars.

The scene were Eugene and the others were in officer burkes apartment. and Eugene goes "" its my life, i decide when i die"" (or something along the lines of that) he then puts a gun to his head and pulls the trigger but the gun didn't fire, because it wasn't his time to die!  so basically death wanted to kill him.

A cop, Thomas Burke (Michael Landes), comes up to her and asks why she's blocking traffic. She says there's going to be a huge accident and, sure enough, events begin to unfold on Highway 180 . . . but without them in it unlike in her vision. The cop goes to alert other emergency personnel. An oncoming truck heads right for Kim's car. Kim escapes but her friends are killed. Yet others--who had died in the multiple wrecks in Kim's vision--also survive.

Soon, the survivors are all together. Except one by one Death comes for them, making things as they should be, restoring order and bringing his agenda of who dies and when back under his control.

To try and stop the cycle before it's too late, Kim seeks out a survivor from the first movie--Clear Rivers (Ali Larter)--and Clear takes command, explaining why people are dying and how to save themselves.

If they believe her.

Shock, gore and suspense are what this movie is all about.

I got to tell you, this movie had me biting my nails all the way through. After the *ahem* blood settled and we knew who the major players were, I was gripping my seat because very quickly they slowly begin to die. And not just, oh, they die slowly--but in that step-by-step, cause-and-effect way that is the Final Destination franchise's hallmark. These movies are very much about the Butterfly Effect, and the way the tension is created as you wait for someone to be a goner is pure gold.

I loved the creative ways folks died in the movie. No clear-cut, bang-you're-dead stuff here. Just pure strange ways of checking out. The most creative, I thought, was when that kid got squished by a falling sheet of glass. Didn't see that coming, and the way he folded in half is burned in my memory. Likewise when the barb-wired fence dices Rory (Jonathan Cherry) into pieces. Who comes up with this stuff?

The only thing that got under my skin was Clear's constantly talking about ""Death's design."" Okay. We get it. He has a design. Move on. I don't need to hear you using that phrase a thousand times in the movie.

This flick has a permanent place in my DVD collection.

1482348,4,B00005JLZK,"I think the only problem I have with Final Destination 2 is that the pacing of the storyline isn't as good as in the original.  I mean, all the scenes that are supposed to build to a dramatic tragic death because it's that persons time to leave this world according to death... these particular moments always felt rushed to me with not much of an interesting build up getting to them.  It's like the writers didn't feel like building to the suspenseful moments this time around.  Much lazier writing compared to the first Final Destination.

Besides that, the graphic visuals of the deaths themselves are probably better than in the first one because they look so dang cool and violent, and the movie as a whole is right in between the first and third Final Destination movies as far as enjoyment is concerned.  The original will always be the best one because it had great atmosphere and a somewhat original storyline.

Still, thinking aboug death and the big questions in life such as whether you are supposed to die at a certain time during your life will probably enter your mind as you watch Final Destination 2 and think about your own future.  I guess this is such a huge and mysterious question we can't help but wonder the answer to it.",1253923200,,1246,4.585585585585585

1482350,4,B00005JLZK,"At heart, all horror movies operate on the human response to mortality.  Your average horror fan gets a thrill from the films because they are a sort of spice for life, they are the seasoning that makes the mundane parts of life all the more richer.  Watch a bunch of people get sliced and diced by a monster or madman, and that adrenaline rush makes you feel as if, on some level, you yourself have cheated death.  For awhile or more, it's nice to be alive.

The FINAL DESTINATION films utilize the same premise, but instead of creating a defeatable or relatable villain, it makes the very act of dying the villain.  Watching the movies, it's very much like they decided that the force of Death, after a millenia of ending lives, has grown bored and has decided to put some spice into his job.  In all of the movies, Death awards a young soul with a premonition of a huge catastrophe, and when that soul saves him/herself (along with a handful of others), Death gleefully sets up cat-and-mouse games with the survivors and watches as they scream and skitter.  The question is never Will They Die?  It is How Long Can They Hold Out?

Because everyone dies, sooner or later, and it's rarely at the hands of a zombie or a Leatherface.  Car accidents are far more common.  Fires.  Mechanical failures.  The FD films make Death a snarky, sadistic force without ever showing his face.  Instead, Death operates basically through three cards -- wind, gravity, and passive human interference -- and with these three things, he orchestrates the deaths of dozens and dozens of characters.  These films are filled with pointless scenes of people screaming that they're in control of their lives, scoffing at the idea that Death lurks everywhere.  Then they die.

The real fun in these films lies in the complex machinations that Death sets in motion with the leak of a pipe or the flutter of a bird.  If you're expecting interesting plots, complex characters, or realistic dialogue, prepare to be HEAVILY disappointed.  In fact, these elements of the films get steadily more and more wooden and cartoonish, until by the fourth installment, they are laughably bad.  The makers know that what you're really waiting for is to watch Death do his thing, investing everything from quarters to fishsticks with a sinister menace.  To that end, I have provided here a summary of the only thing about each of these films that is worth watching: the death scenes.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/0780631684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)</a>:
In the first film, Death's premonition is visited upon a young student on a plane.  The ensuing plane accident (5/5) gave me nightmares for a week.  When the student leaves the plane along with others, he then experiences more premonitions (most of them cheesy reflections in windows) indicating that Death is now hunting them down.  Of all the movies, this one features the most personified version of Death.  A dark mist accompanies each death, and you can even see Death pursuing some characters, especially in a tense bathroom scene (4/5).  Some of the deaths feature complex sequences of domino-like chains (there is a catastrophic house fire (4/5) and a menacing electrical storm (4/5)).  Others are less creative (the bus and train accidents are both unimaginative throwaways (2/5)).  The final death (by sign) is a cheeky nod at the movie's premise (4/5).  Notable in this film: Death has a soundtrack, which turns out to feature, over and over again, ""Leaving on a Jet Plane.""

FINAL DESTINATION 2:
Death isn't so hung up on music this time around, but that's okay because he's a bit more creative.  This film's opening highway accident is by far the best beginning out of any of these films (5/5), and when the storyline later ties the survivor's lives to the events of the first film, it's actually interestingly done.  Not as interesting as the deaths, though.  You've got a tongue-in-cheek apartment fire (4/5), a crushing visit to the dentist (4/5), and an unusually persistent elevator (3/5).  In one case, the jaws of life have the opposite function (4/5), and in another case a flying fence executes a mortal ballet (5/5).  There are also three explosive deaths that are a little cheap (2/5).  The characters this time around all get premonitions (again, mostly just false reflections in windows), and they spend a lot of pointless time trying to cheat Death's plan (their ideas mostly centering around a ""new life"").  The final scene, just as in the first film, is an over-the-top nyuck-nyuck moment.  ""It's all in fun,"" Death seems to be saying.

This time around it's a roller coaster catastrophe (4/5).  The movie has a creative idea by putting the premonitions into poorly shot yearbook photos, and Death continues to get up in people's faces with ominous/ironic songs and smug little omens (before one death, characters at a drive-in watch as the word ""control"" disappears from the digital menu).  The first ""catch-up"" death in a tanning salon is perhaps the best of the film (5/5), although there's a nicely intricate set-up later in the film that involves a nail-gun (5/5).  A runaway truck and horse and a falling sign constitute some of the film's weaker executions (2/5, 3/5, and 2/5, respectively).  Elsewhere in the film, the movie's token ""I'm Gonna Live Forever!"" character battles death in a weight room (4/5).  The movie concludes with an intense subway scene that is kinda cool, but also sort of a rip off as far as endings go. (4/5)

The opener here is the weakest of the franchise.  It takes place at a racing track, and so all of the subtle connections and coincidences get lost in the sprawling chaos of the catastrophe (3/5).  The premonitions this time around are ridiculously aggressive hallucinations, and they forecast some rather uncreative demises.  One man is murdered by a tow truck in a way that almost makes sense (1/5).  Another character bites it at a hair salon in a rather unsatisfying fashion (2/5).  There's a clever little two-fer where two characters simultaneously battle watery deaths, although both are almost too cartoonish to be all that scary (4/5 - car wash; 3/5 - swimming pool).  The movie's real saving grace (aside from the 3D, which does its job without much fuss) is it's final theater/mall debacle, which is witty, self-referential, and fairly intense (5/5).  The close of the movie (and, ostensibly, the franchise) is an unceremonious vehicular accident that is only notable for the X-ray vision it is finally shot in.",1252972800,,6994,5.248424842484249

1482357,5,B00005JLZK,"The basic theme of the movie of the whole final destination franchise remains the same. The concept that death is an unstoppable force and inevitable law of nature, is well known to us but the final destination franchise brought to us in a big hollywood motion picture environment, the concept that if the plan of death is altered then death corrects itself by creating random and freakish circumstances to get those persons anyway who were doomed in the first place. All three final destination films play on the theme that if you mess with the plan of death then a very gruesome death is anyway inevitably in store for you. When it comes to final destination, it is more useful to compare all three movies in the franchise. In 2, the director is not the same as 1 and 3. But 2 is pretty dramatic of all the 3 movies but it lacks a strong and convincing ending. In all three films the plot idea is that there is a first act pivotal piece scene, where a permonition by a lead character saves the lives of people who were to meet certain death. Now these people who escaped death will now die in the exact order in which they would have died in the first place if Death's initial plan had not be altered. In 1 this pivotal scene was an airplane explosion, in  2 it is an amazing and very convincingly shot freeway pile up and in 3 it is a very realistic looking rollercoaster mishap. For the initial first act, of all three films I feel the freeway pileup in 2 was the most intense and convincing start out of all three films in the franchise. From a standpoint of gore, I would say number 3 had the most realistic looking bloodfest. From a standpoint of originality, 1 was the freshest being the first in the series. Final destination 2 had the basic weakness in its ending in trying to make the main characters survive, they came up with this unbelievable idea that new life cancels out the need for death to take life. This plot idea is inserted to give a good ending to 2. But the strongest movie of the franchise in terms of the original concept of final destination and which works is movie 3 because its gives the message we got in 1 that you cannot escape death. 3 has a number of set piece scene sequences. The roller coaster mishap, a festival fireworks display gone wrong and a final amazing metro train crash. In summing it up Movie 3 is better than movie 2 is better than movie 1. After 1, we all know the franchise plot, we know they will all die one by one, but the fun in the series is that given a set of props on the scene, we are kept guessing which freaky set of circumstance and permutations is going to mutate itself into creating a noose for one of our characters.

1482431,2,B00005JLZK,"Final Destination 2 (David R. Ellis, 2003)

The original Final Destination was a hackneyed, if clever, take on the slasher film-- what if the killer was Death itself? The surprise success of the movie, which gained an audience well beyond the usual slasher-film groupies, immediately had the studios hunting up ideas for a sequel. It should be no surprise by now that Hollywood + sequel = junk.

In this one, one year to the day after the explosion of Flight 180, Kimberley Corman (Tru Calling's A. J. Cook) is on the way to Daytona Beach with her friends when she has a vision of a horrible accident on the highway, and refuses to budge from the on-ramp. Needless to say, the accident happens, and everyone who got stuck behind her on the onramp is now set to be stalked by Death. Kimberley and her new love interest Burke (Hart's War's Michael Landes), the cop who was trying to figure out why she wasn't merging, try to figure out how to cheat death, enlisting the help of Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the sole survivor of Flight 180. (Yeah, that confused me, too. There's an Alien 3-style revelation about Devon Sawa's character about a quarter into the movie.) Clear gets our old pal Bludworth (Tony Todd) involved as well, and we're off to the races.

I have to admit, I give the movie grudging props for not going where I feared it was going to go (Tony Todd battling it out with Death in a steel cage match), but man. I can almost see the board meetings on this one. ""So we have all these ideas for how to kill people. Story? Who cares?"" And that's basically what you get. I also have to say that the final scene in the movie is worth the price of admission by itself. Which is good, because nothing else about the movie is. **",1198108800,,1733,4.4263322884012535

The whole convoluted business about the need for Death to balance its books whenever someone is saved from their predestined demise is preposterous, but the Rube Goldberg nature of some of the killings is kind of fun.",1197763200,,343,4.813559322033898
1482433,5,B00005JLZK,"2000's ""Final Destination"" was good, 2006's ""Final Destination 3: Cheating Death"" is great, but it's questionable whether anything they ever do with the series is going to quite match the second chapter, from 2003.  ""Final Destination 2"" is one of the most electrifying movies ever made, and the scariest of its trilogy.

  A similar 'premonition of mass death' to what set off the events in the first one occurs early, this time happening to a girl named Kimberly (A.J. Cook) as she and her friends are on the freeway.  Forseeing a mass car wreck (depicted terrifically onscreen with a gusto that probably outdoes any action movie car chase scene in history) she frantically tries to no avail to get a nearby police officer to close down the road, succeeding only in preventing her own group - and several cars angrily stuck behind her parked vehicle - from entering the traffic flow until after the disaster begins, as envisioned, moments later.

  In the Final Destination mythos, Death is an entity or force that seems to have detailed plans on who it's going to claim, and when and how - and it doesn't take kindly to when its plans get thwarted by these premonitions that occur periodically.  So those who would have died in this latest disaster are targeted with a vengeance, dying in what would first appear to be accidents, and then in increasingly improbable situations as Death ups the ante and plays more recklessly.  The vicious endings met by those on Death's hit list really up the ante in imaginative mayhem and rank high on the jolt scale; sometimes it's reminescent of the insane kinetic energy in ""Evil Dead 2"", but without the blackly comedic edge.  The 'targets' band together reluctantly - some skeptical and hostile at first - to figure out what's happening, and eventually seek out the sole survivor of the first movie, living self-committed in an psychiatric facility, who gets involved partly to help the new group and partly to try and avenge the victims from the first movie.  ""Final Destination 2"" puts together an ideal, diverse group of characters, with Cook making a great central protagonist.  It defines 'high impact' through most of its running time but is fully capable of being mysterious and even emotionally subtle. (See the ambiguous but intriguing ways the character relationships develop in the background of the movie, and of course the continuing question of whether Tony Todd's undertaker character is really just an unnerving guy knowledgable in occult theories, or something more)

  This is just done so well on every level - smartly written and directed, strong performances, outstanding special effects, high regard to production values, shot-perfect cinematography...  It's a memorable, multi-layered shocker of a movie that leaves one wanting more, and gets the highest possible rceommendation for horror fans.  A+",1189555200,,2866,5.048832271762208
1482434,3,B00005JLZK,"After forseeing a massive car wreck teenager Kimberly prevents the accident by blocking the cars from merging with her truck, causing Death to take revenge.

I enjoyed bits of the film. Not a big fan of teen scream films, but I thought Kimberly and the police officer character were entertaining and sympathetic characters. Also the scene at the dental office.... Yikes!

Overall, I'd give it a 3. I guess I've outgrown watching films where seeing characters die in various different ways is the primary theme. This film needed more suspense and plot to really entertain me.",1177372800,,574,4.96875
1482435,4,B00005JLZK,"The first Final Destination (I always found the title clunky but oh well) was a memorable entry in the teen horror genre since it wasn't self-referential and kind of dumb as the others. It relied on atmosphere and tension for their scenes whereas Scream or Urban Legend seemed to lack balls in their scenes. Of course the inevitable sequel comes out and this time it's packed with what the first one avoided slightly: gore. Strange as it may sound, this is gore done right. Yeah it's dumb, campy and little redeeming value but somehow you're just entertained by the whole thing.

Taking place a year after the Flight 180 disaster from the first one, we now instead follow Kimberly en route to a vacation when she has a premonition of a brutal multiple-car pileup on the freeway and prevents another group of cars from going down the freeway. The pileup happens and the remaining survivors, along with Kimberly find out what the first group had to deal with: Death is mad people lived and he's back, but he's gotten a little bit more creative, and way more gruesome.

In the film after this, Wendy (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) says ""can you feel how vicious it was?"" That pretty much sums up the approach this film and that one have with dispatching its characters. Unlike the first one which were more like freak accidents in a way, this almost seems like Death playing Mousetrap with that knocking over this which turns off that and makes this do that until splat, something happens. It's silly but for some reason, it's dementedly fun. You find it strange that you're getting such a kick out of seeing a guy ""Cube""d to death (it's a movie, check it out). The opening sequence with the massive pileup is probably one of the most tension-filled and exciting car crash scenes in recent memory, not to mention it's quite gory. But it's presented in a way that you'll turn very paranoid whenever a big trucker is on the road with you.

Is the acting any better? Well, no. The leads are usually the more better but nowhere near great acting. AJ Cook though does an admirable job as Kimberly and proves a good successor to the vision seer role Devon Sawa had in the first one. The rest? Very cookie cutter. The stoner to the impatient bi*ch with things to do to the brash, insensitive man, it's obvious they're just meant to be fodder for Death's viciousness. Returning is Clear Rivers (played by Ali Larter) who helps out Kimberly and her situation. She doesn't really make the film any better but can't go wrong with an additional hottie.

For those looking for a simple fun horror movie rather than a serious horror movie pretending it's fun, can't go wrong with this entire series. Yeah, FD2 is filled with a bunch of nonsense but where else can you get a kick out of this stuff for a change?",1176681600,,2798,4.59
1482436,3,B00005JLZK,"After the great success of the first Final Destination movie, the follow up was inevitable, and I suppose so was the third film in due course. Having seen them all I would say that Final Destination 2 is definitely the weakest.

The story sees a young girl called Kimberley have a premonition in which a motorway pile up kills dozens of people including her and her friends. When she wakes up she avoids the disaster along with a few other cars full of people that she stops from driving into the path of the accident. Of course the result is that once again, the spirit of Death stalks all the survivors to ensure no-one escapes.

The car crash that starts the film is pretty excitingly filmed although a road accident does not have quite the same white-knuckle factor as an aeroplane disaster. But what really drags the film down is the introduction of the Clear Rivers character who was a survivor of the first movie. Coming across as a broody, death obsessed know-it-all, Clear Rivers becomes the oracle to which all the cast turn for an explanation of what is happening and how they can fight it. Between the obligatory death scenes, the characters start to unravel the REALLY clumsy formula behind who's turn it is to die next and who might ultimately survive. It must have been an attempt to out-do the first film by introducing a new mythology behind Death's ultimate plan, but it doesn't help the film at all. The other annoying thing is that Kimberley keeps on having more visions before each death and tries to use this power to save their lives but can't really do it very efficiently, and this falls kind of flat too as a plot device because it really goes nowhere - Kimberley's having psychic powers is not investigated in the script and the manifestation of them is very throwaway.

What still works reasonably well are the surprise deaths although some of them are rather disappointing. The settings still work as toe-curlers, such as putting the potential victims in the dentists chair, in a hazardous dirty kitchen, or in an elevator, but eventually the spark of the film just sinks under the weight of it's confusing attempts to create a logical pattern for the deaths, and the ponderous revelations (usually delivered by the all-knowing and annoyingly smug Clear Rivers) sound too ridiculous. What also doesn't work is that the survivors handle each death as it comes along with such casualness - it's all me, me, me with no appearance of shock or regret about the loss of other people's lives. And being such a callous bunch does not endear them to the audience!

So I ended up feeling kind of let down. The crash is pretty good, but all the waffle is a turn off and it punctures the suspense. The use of a survivor from the first film might have worked if they had got Devon Sawa back as Alex, but this character has conveniently died (and implausibly too - wait until you hear how!) in between the two films. Mind you any sequel that brings back previous cast members is a sure sign of covering up for shortcomings in the film itself.

 The third film in the series drops the link to any previous characters and does a far better job of entertaining by reverting to a much more straightforward format.",1170806400,,3224,4.6276223776223775

A sequel to a modest hit from 2000 about Death mercilessly stalking a handful of high schoolers who escaped a plane crash that was supposed to kill them, the flick burns what feels like 10 boring introductory minutes by following several unidentified, unrelated drivers as they unknowingly barreling toward a fiery pileup on a freeway somewhere.

The carnage is played out in its entirety before it's revealed that the whole thing was a premonition. Kimberly (A.J. Cook), the picture's generic brunette cutie-pie heroine, envisions the bloodbath, then deliberately blocks an on-ramp in a panic, thus saving the lives of the half dozen people that director David R. Ellis had just featured in her vision being splattered, decapitated and burned alive.

With all the saved drivers in police custody for no legitimate reason after the accident -- which killed a bunch of other people instead, thanks to Kimberly -- the group comes to realize this day is the anniversary of the first movie's crash. Soon they begin to fear the same fate suffered by that disaster's survivors -- a series of subsequent ""accidental"" and fantastical deaths.

After a couple of them meet gruesome ends, this cross-section of sorry clichs bands together. The skeptical soul brother, the druggie, the low-life, the foxy power yuppie (who whines, ""Oh, this cannot be happening! My career it at a peak, I just met the perfect guy..."") all seek out the lone asylum-dwelling survivor from ""Final Destination"" (Ali Larter) for advice, and try to cheat their apparent fate, armed only with some cryptic crapola notion that ""only new life can defeat death.""

Repetitive scenes follow in which much screen time is burned setting the stage for horrible catastrophes that the characters then avoid by the skin of their teeth -- only to fall victim to another accident the movie only hinted at in the background of the same scene.

If screenwriters J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress had put half the effort into fixing the embarrassingly hackneyed dialogue as they put into Rube Goldberg killings, or if director Ellis had cared to do something about the terrible acting, ""Final Destination 2"" might have risen above the dregs of its bottom-scraping genre.

But they all willfully fail, in every way, to build a good horror movie around their perfectly viable and chilling concept of Death trying to prevent a domino effect of unintended saved lives. Instead they squander the movie's potential, abandoning it to tiredest of formulaic claptrap -- right down to the idiotically obligatory, sequel-baiting it's-not-over-yet finale.

She warns everyone in the car and tells an officer of what she saw.  The officer asks Kimberly to step out of the car.  Just then an automobile transporter comes whizzing by and hits the car Kimberly was in, killing all her friends.

He manages to get out just in time when the apartment explodes.  He steps down the ladder and slips.  He's on his back, and the ladder edge goes straight in his eye.

People are sliced up and killed by falling glass panels...about that glass panel. Wasn't the kid's death supposed to be ""delayed"" because someone intervened and safed his life while he was choking on that fish? Anyway, this is just one of the plot holes. The rest of the movie doesn't waste much time on things like character development either. Due to the bigger list, somebody's killed every 5 minutes, in rather disgusting ways.

The premonitions of the lead actress are also rather dull and don't make much sense. In the end you actually have to ask yourself if this was supposed to be a thrilling movie or a comedy.",1140393600,,1060,4.435897435897436
1482549,4,B00005JLZK,"I came to this film with no expectations - I hadn't seen the original installment. The way the opening builds to a creshendo of horror is spectacular. From then on, - and, once I'd gotten over the shock of the gruesome death of the first ""survivor"", I found myself both thoroughly entertained and impressed. Intellegent, well-crafted horror? Yes, it is possible!

Unlike other reviewers, I thought the acting was excellent by and large. The only truly irritating moments in the movie were provided by the black character who repeatedly refused to believe something spooky was going on in the face of increasingly overwhelming evidence - it's a stock device and it's so lame. But this had nothing to do with the guy's acting ability, which I thought was excellent given the limitations of his given character.

Otherwise, I was just totally impressed by the artistry of the team behind this shocker. The build-up of tension, the tease, that led towards each death was masterful.

I'm not big on horror as a genre but, if you're going to watch an odd horror or two, I can certainly recommend this.",1140307200,,1095,4.8138297872340425

1482552,4,B00005JLZK,"After watching ""Final Destination"" and hearing that New Line Cinema had plans to make a sequel, my first thought was that New Line was making the same old mistake that has plagued many studios.  The mistake is making a franchise out of a movie that stands alone perfectly, and does not require any further movies to continue its story.  So, needless to say when I saw the previews for ""Final Destination 2"", I thought it looked pretty much like the first movie, except for a different cast.  However, I am happy to say that I was wrong, not only was ""Final Destination 2"" a good movie, it cleverly built upon what was started in the first film.

""Final Destination 2"" focuses on Kimberly (A.J. Cook) who is taking a road trip with a group of friends when suddenly they are involved in a massive car accident on the highway that kills them all, but then Kimberly snaps out of her daydream and discovers they are all still safe and sound.  But, just like Alex (Devon Sawa's character in ""Final Destination""), Kimberly's dream quickly becomes reality.  Since, she saw how the crash developed, Kimberly avoids becoming involved in the accident and saves not only her and her friends, but several other motorists.  Though Kimberly is the hero of the hour, she quickly learns that her vision and quick actions come with a burden, she has now thrown a kink into Death's plan, and now Death is coming back for Kimberly and her friends.

As I said before, I didn't believe New Line Cinema had made a smart decision in making this sequel, however, after viewing the movie I realized that sometimes milking a subject matter can turn out alright when the studio is smart enough to keep the quality up to par with that of the original.  The cast, comprised of mostly unknowns, still does an excellent job, from the lighter tones of the movie, to the intense action/death scenes, this cast always shines.  Two returning cast members from the original also help out the proceedings, Ali Larter as Clear, and Tony Todd as the Mortician, give this sequel ties to its roots, but even if these characters hadn't returned the writers did a terrific job of linking ""Final Destination 2"" to the original film in a very interesting way, which I will not spoil for you.

Overall, this movie is a little more horror than its predecessor, but still maintains its supernatural elements, and leaves the audience very satisfied.

""Final Destination 2"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.",1135296000,,2475,4.716937354988399
1482553,1,B00005JLZK,"This movie is too contrived, the whole movie consisting of build-ups to a predictable climax. The first movie was better because any action taken by Death is portrayed as ambiguous, something that could have been an accident of Nature or a consequence of circumstances. Here in this movie, it is obviously Death out to get his guy or gal with longly drawn-out events happening that could not possibly occur naturally.

The first few scenes are pretty much the only good thing about the film. There on, it's a film you can skip for 10 minutes and rejoin because it's rather predictable. Besides being overdramatic in a wrong way, it seems like the ultimate film for movie watchers in their teens to go and watch at the theaters. It's not to be taken seriously as the music of the film would allow you to believe once you've seen it. I liked the scenes in which the Lotto Winner was killed mainly because I am a huge Incubus fan(they play ""Vitamin"" full length during it) Besides the above mentioned, the film is rather boring. It seems like that a video game with six characters all of whom are trying to save themselves from the unavoidable disaster in the form of death.

Watch this movie if you're a curious fan like me. Noone would ever watch this movie for a second time so there is absolutely no sense in purchasing the DVD.I still can't beleive some of my friends found this film scary. It's more yawn inducing.

1482598,4,B00005JLZK,"The FINAL DESTINATION films offer an ingenious twist on a well-worn horror subgenre.  The premise is that if you escape a situation in which you were ""meant"" to die, Death will continue stalking you until it succeeds in recouping its losses.  Essentially, they are slasher films without a slasher; instead, there is an unseen force that insures that anything that can go wrong does.

At the start of the second film, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook - THE VIRGIN SUICIDES) is leaving for vacation with some friends when she witnesses a spectacular highway disaster which she narrowly escapes.  But soon, other survivors begin dying and Kimberly remembers the case of Flight 180 a year earlier.  Like Alex Browning, one of the plane's survivors, she becomes convinced that Death is picking them off one by one.  She tracks down Clear Rivers (Ali Larter, reprising her role from the first film), the one Flight 180 passenger who is left alive, and the only one who might be able to help them escape their fates.

It helps if you accept the premise (I've always thought the first film might have been better as a psychological thriller in which it was unclear whether Death was really after these folks or it was just Alex's paranoia - but I digress) but it's not a requisite.  The fun is mainly in watching all the disparate elements come together and compound themselves until they result in a character's demise.  In most cases they're highly improbable, but curious coincidences happen in real life all the time; undoubtedly many of them go unnoticed or undocumented.  I didn't have any trouble suspending disbelief.  The point is that the events may be unlikely, but they aren't impossible.  There are even a few red herrings to keep you on your toes.

Oh, and the deaths are quite nice.  I only recall one particularly gory end in the first movie, but this one delivers the goods on all counts.

FINAL DESTINATION 2 is presented as one of New Line Cinema's ""Infinifilm"" DVDs, which is a fancy way of saying ""bonus features.""  If you watch the Infinifilm version of the movie (you should watch it uninterrupted first) options will appear periodically through which you can view extended and deleted scenes, screen tests, making-of segments, and more.  After the feature ends, you'll be dropped back into the film where you left off.  If you don't want to watch the entire movie again, your chapter buttons will take you to the next scene that contains an extra, or you can jump there from a menu.  You can watch the movie with a pop-up ""fact track,"" or listen to it with filmmaker commentary. Outside the film, there is featurette on near death experiences, and one in which three teenagers are hooked up to bio-monitors so that their reactions to certain key scenes can be examined.  There is a thirty-minute documentary that begins with a retrospective of splatter films and goes into the making of this film's effects.  There is considerable redundancy among the extras, but I suppose no one really watches them all.  There are two music videos, and trailers for both movies.  Finally, there is a stupid game called ""Choose Your Fate"" in which you pick a card and get either a pleasant fortune replete with bunny rabbits cavorting or a horrific death.

1482602,3,B00005JLZK,"I did rate the original 5 stars.  Final Destination II is not as good as the original.  This version isn't pure twisted slasher fun as was Final Destination.  They dulled this version with a human interest angle.

However:

Final Destinations are unique among slasher films.  There is no scary monster going to jump out and get you.  It's Death that sets off chains of events that lead to death.  (I wondered how Death could be the means and the end (death) in The Seventh Seal.  How odd that a lark of a slasher film would answer that question.)  Sometimes Death gets no one; and sometimes it gets someone else instead.

As each domino in an incident falls, you're led to believe that whoever is the current focus will die in a particular way.  For example:  A man shoots at a bird on the wing (Please miss!).  The bullet misses and hits a tree branch instead (Thank Heaven!).  The branch falls and breaks a power line that whips back and hits the man, who fries (That was weird!).  That is only a couple of sets of cause and effect.  Insert several sets of cause and effect between a first and last and you have each incident in Final Destinations.

The fun is in being misled by the clever twists that run through the chains of events that lead to death.  Final Destinations are not serious treatments about cheating death--they're not meant to be.

I'd like to see more Final Destinations, but without schmaltz.",1117929600,,1415,4.5396825396825395
1482603,3,B00005JLZK,"While watching Final Destination 2 (2003) this past weekend I got the feeling the makers of the film just really didn't respect the first film all that much.  It's hard to explain, but the film had a feel of not so much complimenting the original, but trying to one up itself as if to say `This is how it should have been done' fostered by the sense of someone taking the parts they thought worth saving, tweaking them (i.e. adding a lot more gore), and then making up the rest as they went along.  And that annoyed me a little as I thought the first film was an altogether relatively thoughtful little film with a good dose of originality and just a whole lot of fun...directed by stuntman turned director David R. Ellis (Cellular) and written by the team that also did The Butterfly Effect (2004), the film stars A.J. Cook as Kimberly Corman, a young woman with a strange gift (or curse, depending on your point of view).  Also appearing is Michael Landes (he played Jimmy Olsen in the television show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman), Terrence 'T.C.' Carson (U-571), Lynda Boyd (Bones), and Jonathan Cherry (House of the Dead).  Reprising their roles from the first film are Ali Larter (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and Tony Todd, who also played the title role in the Candyman films.

The story takes place about a year after the events that took place in the first film.  It turns out Kimberly (Cook), much like Devon Sawa's character of Alex from the original, is having premonitions about those around her, visions that foretell their impending demise which allows her to warn those doomed individuals allowing them to cheat death...but death doesn't give up, especially on those who escape its cold, bony grasp...in fact, those who manage to stay one step ahead with Kimberly's help invariably suffer an even worse fate than originally planned for them as death seems to hold a grudge against those who try to weasel out of their predetermined destinies.  Anyway, after saving a group of motorists from a fiery and twisted metal highway death, Kimberly tries to make sense out of what happened, but few are willing to believe her fantastic story and the relationship to the events of the past, specifically the freak accidents that killed nearly all the survivors of the flight 180 disaster a year ago...that is until they themselves begin getting picked off one by one in a series of events that would make Rube Goldberg proud.  This drives Kimberly to enlist the help of the one surviving member of the original group in that of Clear Rivers (Larter), who's currently a resident of the local mental institution, but that may not be enough as the Grim Reaper is a persistent, cunning little monkey who always gets the cheese...certainly aided a few times throughout the film by the compete stupidity of the intended victims (check out the character of Evan, the young man driving the Trans-Am...this Mensa candidate should have been drowned at birth).

If I've learned anything from Final Destination 2 it's that if it's your time to go, then you should go...if you try to cheat death, it will still get you in the end, and when it does the mode of your death will be much gruesome and horrible than the way you were originally intended to die...and I also learned Apple Computers must have supplied some dough for the production of the film as their product placement appears numerous times (gee, strange how all the computers in the film are of the Apple variety...I don't mind product placement in a film, but next time make it a little less obvious so I don't get the complete sense of sleazy pandering as I did here).  Did I enjoy the film?  For the most part, yes, but I did make the mistake of expecting there to be a true, continuing development of the original storyline rather than a half-hearted rehashing featuring over the top death scenes lavished with gory effects...truly, it seemed like the death sequences were immaculately designed, and then the story created later to fill in the spaces between those scenes not leading up to another spectacular macabre fatality.  In terms of the actors, well, there weren't really any memorable performances as not long into the film you realize most of them are there in the capacity of gristle awaiting the grind.  I will say I thought the director did a good job leading us down the path towards certain events (including numerous false starts), as I did feel tension welling up prior to various characters getting their comeuppance (deservedly so or not) and he really kept the pacing of the film quick, resulting in a 90 minute run time, sort of like a pleasant enough acquaintance that doesn't overstay their welcome.  Also, the death sequences were creative and elaborate, almost more so than in the first, so if that's where your interest lies, you will not be disappointed.  This film also featured one of the most spectacular multi-car crash sequences in a film I've seen in a long time.  As far as the story the links to the original seemed tenuous at best, and became kind of convoluted with the emergence of some sort of `ripple effect' theory that didn't really stick too well especially since one could make the argument that every person on the planet can be linked together through their associations.  The comedic elements are given more weight here, probably due to the lack of meaningful relationships between characters as was seen in the original.

New Line Home Entertainment gives this film their `Infinifilm' treatment, which means they pour on the extras.  The DVD features both the anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) along with the fullscreen version, and three, count them, three audio formats including English (DTS 6.1 ES), English (Dolby Digital 5.1 EX), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo).  Extras include a fact track, music videos, deleted/alternate scenes, a commentary track by director David R. Ellis, producer Craig Perry, and screenwriters J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, along with a couple of featurettes titled Cheating Death: Beyond and Back (18:10) and Bits and Pieces: Bringing Death Back to Life (14:00).  I think my favorite parts of the special features is when director Ellis talks about how much a role his assistant Tawny Ellis (notice they have the same last name?  Because she's his daughter) played in the creative process of the film, despite her general lack of experience.  Nepotism is certainly a fact of life, but I can't help but wonder if his regularly consulting with her on whether or not certain scenes work rubbed anyone (anyone not a part of the Ellis family) the wrong way.

1482604,5,B00005JLZK,"First off I'd like to say that 'Final Destination 2' was better than the first 'FD' film which was also great.

This film has a great cast full of mostly unknowns who all did a great job particularly A.J cook and Michael Landes who play the leads alongside Ali Larter returning as Clear Rivers from the first film playing the only survivor from the Flight 180 accident in this film, Ali also did a great job.

The opening to this film is one of the most memorable consisting of Kimberly Corman(A.J Cook), your average teenage girl whose going on a trip to Daytona Beach with some of her friends when she has a premonition of a fatal freeway Pileup which has some of the best graphics and is put together so well, the price of the DVD is worth it just for the pileup scene. Its really suspencful and its cool to see each person meet there fate in the pileup. Even the opening credits gives a sense of eeriness that makes you shiver.

Now after the pileup it turns out that Kimberly just had a crazy premonition telling her her future fate. She quickly takes action and blocks the section leading into the highway where the accident will take place. While Kimberly is being scolded by Officer Thomas Burke who also would have died in the pileup, the accident happens right in front of her and many others who would have been involved in the accident. Afterwards it just becomes a chase of survival against death and its design but theres a twist with the design but I won't get into that. All the deaths are unpredictable and your just sitting there thinking that the deaths about to happen when it doesn't and then when you least expect it Wham! It happens. Each death is pretty creative and gory for those blood lovers. The ending is pretty creative and theres a lot of twists and turns along the way. The direction adds to the style of the movie when the deaths occur.

Botton Line: I definetly recommend the DVD to those people who love getting scared, and love seeing those gorey deaths. The DVD special features are great as well, its a great DVD to add to your collection. Definetly recommended.",1114819200,3,2100,4.489528795811518

And I am not overdoing it now, this is serious -but I honestly wonder; Were they? Was it ment for this movie to turn into a comedy? If so, it wasn't funny at all! I mean; I don't even know what to call Final Destination 2.

It starts out interesting actually. The great traffic accident was the best part of the entire movie (the way it was filmed and arranged that is of course). It's ok the first 30 minutes or so, but then things begin to be boring. Let's just say; the movie is not scary, not creepy, not well acted, not visually appealing, not interesting, not much of anything actually but 90 minutes long. Though I'm not the biggest fan of the Scream-series, well, those movies are so much better. What else can I compare it to, hm... Wrong Turn! Different story, same quality -other than that Wrong Turn has a much higher entertainment-factor.

1482689,5,B00005JLZK,"The first ""Final Destination"" is an enjoyable experience. The film tells the sad story of Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a young kid who has a dream about an airplane explosion. He and his friends escape death due to his clairvoyant vision, but they soon learn that the grim reaper isn't about to throw in the towel. Alex and his buddies thwarted ""death's design,"" an apparently immutable scheme that says when it's your time to go, you go. Within a few weeks of the crash, the survivors begin to perish in extremely elaborate yet extraordinarily painful ways. One friend dies in the shower after slipping on water. Another pal meets her maker after making contact with a speeding bus. Nasty, nasty business. ""Final Destination"" works well as a film due to nice production values, believable acting, and an original premise. Although the movie borrows heavily from the slasher genre, the idea of replacing a maniac wearing a hockey mask with the unseen force of death is a nice touch. ""Final Destination 2"" retains that essential plot even as it ramps up the gore quotient, gives us a much higher body count, and throws in a few more twists and turns. The movie also presents us even more elaborate death sequences.

""Final Destination 2"" introduces us to Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook), a young lady with her whole life ahead of her. She's about ready to set out on an extended road trip with her friends as the film begins when the same thing that happened to Alex Browning in the first film happens to her. While waiting to pull on to a busy road, Corman experiences a waking dream in which her vehicle becomes one of many automobiles involved in a disastrous multi-car accident. This vision is so extraordinary in its details that Kimberly refuses to move her car one inch after coming back to reality. Dozens of cars stack up behind her, with horns blaring and drivers yelling, but she still adamantly insists on staying put. When Officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) arrives on the scene to get the mess unsnarled, Kimberly tries to tell him about the dream. Guess what? While attempting to tell her incredible tale, disaster unfolds on the highway. A real catastrophe, and one that occurs in the exact spot Kimberly dreamed about. Yikes. Now, just like in the first film, Kimberly, her friends, and many of the people behind her that would have died but didn't face the nightmare of trying to live through the restoration of death's design. The chances aren't good.

Kimberly and the drivers she held up in traffic--which just happens to be the same people she saw killed in her dream--meet up at the station house. Everyone hears about Corman's vision, and nearly everyone thinks it's a crock. If you believe someone dies soon after, give yourself an award. The first guy expires on what should be the best day of his life. He wins the lottery and goes out on a spending spree to celebrate. Unfortunately, he drops his new watch down the kitchen sink. While trying to retrieve the timepiece, a small fire breaks out in the apartment. Since his hand is stuck, he can only stand by helplessly as his abode goes up in flames. Finally, he frees his hand, flees down the fire escape, and rapidly moves on to the next plane of existence when the fire escape ladder plunges through his head. Imaginative, huh? Every other death builds on this one. A pane of glass smashes one of the survivors flat as a pancake. A head caught in an elevator door proves fatal for a female survivor. Airborne barbed wire slices and dices an unfortunate wretch. There's more, all of it over the top gruesome, but you get the idea. As people drop off one by one Conrad enlists the assistance of Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), who now rents a room at the local mental motel, to help discover a way out of this mess. Mortician William Bludworth (Tony Todd) once again turns up to offer a few sage nuggets of advice.

""Final Destination 2"" gets five stars from this reviewer. Because the performances are Oscar worthy? Nope. Because I appreciated Ali Larter's character shrieking something about ""death's design"" every five seconds? Nope again. Because I thought the stereotyped characters (the angry black guy, the stuck up snob, the stoner) were original in any way, shape, or form? Again, not a chance. I think ""Final Destination 2"" deserves the five star treatment because it seems like ages since I've seen gore like this in an American theatrical release. The gorehound inside me howled at the moon in pleasure after witnessing the grim atrocities unfolding with methodical precision in this film. That highway accident was nothing short of breathtaking, even if parts of it were heavy with CGI effects. Explosions, screams, cars and trucks flying through the air, and a huge piece of timber rocketing through a windshield make this series of scenes the feel good moment of the decade. You just don't see stuff like this nowadays. When you couple this opening sequence with the other gory kills in the movie, you get a film that is required viewing for sauce lovers the world over.

Check out the extras! Trailers, deleted scenes, commentary tracks, and plenty of documentary pieces will keep you busy long after the credits roll. One documentary talks about near death experiences (!), while another employs a scientist to hook up three viewers to a machine that monitors their reactions to the movie. Fun stuff. While I won't say ""Final Destination 2"" is a movie the whole family can enjoy, I liked it enough to watch again. And again. And again. Let's hope the third installment ramps up the gory special effects even higher.",1102550400,7,5603,4.77319587628866
1482690,2,B00005JLZK,"I didn't write this but I found it so funny and I agree whole-heartedly, couldn't have put it better myself

'We're all going to die, aren't we?' trembles Final Destination 2's heroine Kimberly Corman (AJ Cook). Oh yeah, baby! is inevitably the answer. But what makes this budding horror franchise stick in your mind is the outrageous variety of ways its characters pop their Nikes. Plot wise, it's a carbon copy of FD1 with double the body count - nervy teen has premonition of disaster (in this case, a motorway pileup) thus saving a random clutch of lives, only to find that by 'cheating death's design' she's severely narked off the forces of fate. Story, suspense and character development are all joyously tossed out the window to go squish on the sidewalk. What's left is a sadistically entertaining guessing game as to whether prosthetic hook, dental gas, chip pan, pigeon (or jolly combination of them all) is going to carry off fate's next victim. Best known for 30 years as a veteran stuntman, director David R Ellis' movie is definitely more smasher than slasher, so don't expect any subtlety: here, Death does not so much point his finger as hammer it through your face with a log.

1482691,3,B00005JLZK,"""Final Destination 2"" picks up one year after the original flick ended.  By now, all but one of the original survivors of Flight 180 have died in freak accidents.  The only survivor, Ali Larter's character, is safely tucked away in a padded cell.  The movie begins with, and I know this will shock you, a huge pile-up on the highway.  Instead of a young boy having a premonition, it's a young girl this time.  She attempts to stop the accident and, another shocker, she survives, as well as a small group of strangers who have nothing in common except for the fact that they were still breathing even though Death meant for them to be pushing up daisies.

What ensues is similar to the original.  The young girl seeks out the help of Larter and manages to gather all of the survivors from her premonition in an attempt to thwart Death.  One by one they are picked off in some rather original death scenes.  There are excessive buckets of blood, impalings, decapitations, and even a wicked fence.  The only twist in this flick is that the creepy undertaker from the original(the guy from ""Candyman"") leaks out that only new life can stop Death's cycle. Other than that, the victims attempt to determine who'll die next, look for warning signs, and try to stay safe.

If you enjoyed the first flick, you'll probably like this one.  In fact, I enjoyed this one more than the original because of the fancy and fiendishly funny ways that Death whoops up on his victims.  From pigeons to PVC, Death uses everything at his disposal to take out his prey.

Like I said, you'll like this if you liked the first one, just don't expect to be taken away by the acting, effects, etc.

Recommended to those who love gorefests and somewhat funny ""horror"" flicks(though there isn't anything too ""horror"" about this one).",1101168000,,1803,4.6257861635220126

The actors are good, but the storyline in FD2 can not be compare to FD1.  The idea was good, but not as exciting or suspense as the first.

1482773,4,B00005JLZK,"We have all read or heard the rule that sequels are supposed to be a little/lot worse than the movie that spawned it (and there have been PLENTY to back this up).  But rarely is there a movie that actually breaks this rule and beats the predecessor at its own game, and you can add Final Destination 2 to that list.

FD2 takes place virtually 1 year after the events of FD1, when a young woman sees a premonition of a hellacious pile-up on the highway that kills scores of people, including her (and some of the events that occur during this mega-crash are downright cringers, such as a man getting squashed by the motorcycle that he was riding).  She decides to stop the events of the crash by blocking the road with her car.  Only problem is that this little act of self-sacrifice leads to the pile-up actually occurring anyway and adding a slight new twist by her becoming one of the survivors.

Unfortunately, this little act doesn't sit well with the old Grim Reaper and activates a rift that sends Death on the hunt for each of the survivors (including the lone survivor from FD1, and no, I didn't mistype that since the Infinifilm version explains how one character didn't make it to FD2) and finishing what didn't get started on the highway, while the characters try to find a way to end the cycle of death that was activated on the highway.

FD2 takes the death scene of a horror film to an all-new level when you are seemingly given a real good hint as to how each character is going to bite the dust, then shown with such a stunning and innovative chain-reaction style that you sit and think ""Man, Death is one cold calculating SOB!"" while your friends nearby cower in terror and hide like wimps(Best kill: well...let's just say that I wouldn't think about messing around with pigeons, glass and heavy machinery)

Since the ending of the film sets a possible FD3 in motion, and the tagline (you can't cheat death twice) does tell that someone who did survive FD1 won't be living to be in FD3, something tells me that the 3rd time might definitely be the charm.",1094601600,,2071,4.506666666666667
1482774,3,B00005JLZK,"The first Final Destination movie was something of a low budget success story, with a host of mostly unknown actors, and contained some interesting and thrilling elements. This sequel however just reworks old ground, and the lack of surprises make it rather ordinary viewing. The premise for both movies is the same in that when it's your time to die, if you somehow ""cheat"" death, it stalks you in an unseen malevolent form until your number is up. The first 15 minutes of this picture portrays a horrific multiple car accident on the freeway in very graphic and gripping fashion, and promises much in the way of tension and intrigue, as our young heroin Kimberly (played by A J Cook)witnesses the events in a premonition, and prevents a handful of characters from a scheduled date with the Grim Reaper. Too many references to the previous film ensue, and the sole survivor we are told from the last story appears briefly in cameo, to help our troubled band in their quest for survival. After the opening eye candy the movie rapidly spirals into a formula driven sequence of mini subplots concerning each character, but doesn't hold the viewer enough to make you really care about what's going on. Doing a sequel is always difficult, but when one thinks about those that are succesful, they usually have a storyline independent to their predessessor, whereas this is virtually a carbon copy with just the names and locations changed. This is an OK flick, but not much more - there are a few scary moments, and the picture will probably appeal to the 18-25 demographic, who are represented in character throughout the movie. Not bad, but not as good as the first, and too few surprises to really make it work well.",1094083200,,1714,4.75503355704698

1482858,4,B00005JLZK,"The ""Final Destination"" film franchise has one purpose: To show a variety of attractive, self-absorbed, brainless young people get snuffed in a variety of very imaginative ways. And trust me, it doesn't get much more entertaining than this. Each movie consists of a succession of elaborately staged set pieces, each of which is designed to toy with the audience until one person's gruesome death finally takes place. These set pieces often have a delightfully ""Rube Goldberg"" quality which constantly fakes out and misdirects the viewer. And trust me, these people deserve what's coming to them. Show some guy tooling down the interstate in his Hummer, yakking away on his cell phone about what girl he plans to poke next, and you know that he is destined for a horrifying demise.

It's not. I got the Final Destination DVD, because I love that movie. It's cool, entertaining and scary - all of which the sequel ain't. Predictability isn't always bad in movies, but to FD2 it was a killer. I don't necessarily mean it was predictable how they were gonna die. Yet, where the first movie was startling and surprising, the sequel only proved a boring copy, with actors so unbelievably stereotype and unreal I regret having struggled not to fall asleep.
As another rewiever put it, I also hope they're not gonna make a third movie - because FD2's senselessness and stupidity can hardly be beaten.
If you're really into that kind of movies, you might like it just the same. But trust me - I'm one of those people who get easily taken with all kinds of movies, especially being a fan of thrill/horror. FD2 I despised. They shouldn't have made a sequel. Final Destination was too good for a sequel.

Forget being run over by a bus; forget being strangled in a bath. Those are old news. There's a lot more blood; the camera is focused more on the deaths, so you see what you least expect to see. I got the feeling that someone had been looking at those health & safety pictures, where you have to guess what the danger is in the picture, and then a light bulb went off above their heads. And boom, you have a film.
The first Final Destination threw you right into the action, and you didn't know what was happening. With a sequel, you know what's going to happen, so you sit back and say, ""bring it on"". It took a few minutes for the film to get started, recapping the events of the first film, and then you sit up, jaw dropping. With the deaths being more imaginative and very, very, very graphic, you didn't know what was going to happen. You just knew a lot of the cast wouldn't be appearing in the next sequel.
We find out in this film that Alex Browning (Devon Sawa - there's actually a very good lookalike in this!) has since died (a very mundane death) and left Clear (the brilliant Ali Larter) locked up voluntarily in a mental institution. Ali Larter is the only cast member left from the original and is up against a whole lot of unknowns, which most of the original cast were - and still are. It was great to see at least one original cast member back for more, rather than just start with a fresh new cast with no links to the previous film - but you'll have to watch the film for yourself to find out whether that's true or not.
The premonitions are more realistic this time, and not a brief glimpse in a window, which none of the audience watching catches. This time, you have longer dream sequences (think the plane crash dream at the beginning of the previous film), and more drawn out premonitions, where you feel like you're in the premonition. This time round, you're trying to work out exactly what's going to happen before it happens on screen.
This is your typical slasher movie, with a twist, and you'll find out how if you watch it - I thought this ""twist"" was great, and it made it all the more better. Ali Larter is a great actress, although . . . Nah, we won't go into that!
There are two things I'm worried about - that the directors might decide to make a trilogy, which might not be a good thing, although they could go all out and bring back Devon Sawa. And the fact that the production designer is Michael Bolton . . .",1072396800,2,3004,4.281195079086116

Not really true, but if your like me, and it'll just mess with your head to see two without seeing one, go ahead, get grossed out, watch one.  Read my review for one, first.  So it starts of with the dream, vision, what ever you wanna call it.  Nothing extreme about the car crash.  If the car crash scene scares you...TURN OFF THE MOVIE, if you can't stand the sight of watching a man burn and a guy being crushed by his motercycle, then your not gonna be able to stomach the rest of the movie. Back to real life, her friends are killed in the car crash, nothing really gorey about that.  Then the guy thats next on the list, sticks his hand down the sink which has a garbage disposal and theres electrical problems, so your trying to prepair yourself for seeing his hand cut off, but thats just the sicko directors trying to scare you.  So his apartment is burning, Blah blah blah. He esacpes, but long story short he ends up having the bottom of a fire escape go through his eye/head.  You also get to see his body later, once the lader is taking out.  This dude has nipple rings and in one of the deleted scenes, this one guy, pulls the ring out of his dead body, and the whole nipple comes with it. Charming.  The next on the list is this son and his mother. Really gross. The son gets crushed/liquified by a pane of glass that falls on him.  And the mother...I don't even want to remember this one.  Her hair gets caught and long story short, her head gets stuck in an elevator while the rest of her is outside. She gets beheaded and her blood is all over these other two chicks.  Then you have two back to back gross deaths, that happen suddenly, no time to even prepair yourself.  A lady gets this huge pole through her head and a guy gets chopped not in half, but in thirds.  Two people get burned alive, sizzling flesh again.  And just when you think its all over, that there can be no more gross deaths, this poor kid, whos a little slow, gets blown up as he is cooking on the bbq.  His burnt arm falls on his mothers plate. THE END. That's how they end the movie. I do have to admit, my dad and I were laughing at that point.  They took it to extremes.  The guy that got cut up, they showed his organs shooting out.  Once again, something that my undigonsed, mentaly ill, fellow high school students could have come up with.  Not a scary movie, Just extremely gorey.  If you were looking for a scary movie without a ton of gore...this is SO NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU.",1072396800,2,2600,4.158
1483020,4,B00005JLZK,"The original Final Destination was an interesting twist on the teen slasher flick:  instead of some standard masked killer picking off people one by one, it was Death itself doing the job, an invisible but definitely intelligent presence who is unbeatable because it cannot be directly battled.
As in the original movie, the sequel begins with a character having a premonition of a disaster and then avoiding it, saving her life and those of a few other people.  Death, however, will not be cheated, and starts picking off the reprieved.  Apparently, cause of death is important:  if you were meant to die in an accident, you will not die of natural causes.  Most of the movie is a series of killings and near-misses, with the cleverness coming in the way Death sets up the kills.  If Rube Goldberg had been a serial killer, the contraptions he developed would have fit right into this film.
Unlike the first movie, the characters are aware as to what is going on, having heard of the earlier story.  It doesn't really help; the only vague help they get points to cheating Death by having a new life that was unplanned for come into the world.  To me, the solution would be to have the male and female leads have a kid, but the film goes off in another direction.
For what is basically a slasher flick, the violence itself is rather tame.  The director seems to shy away from the gore, with the worst of the scenes almost flashing by.  Instead, the focus is on suspense...we know these people are going to die (except maybe the main characters), we just don't know how or when.  For fans of the first movie (which is the obvious audience of this film), this sequel should be an equally pleasing experience, and even if you have not seen the original, this one can be fun.  While not a classic, Final Destination 2 is clever and entertaining enough to rate four stars.",1072137600,,1867,4.573573573573573

Those people who give it 1 or 2 stars because the movie was ""not PERFECTLY acted"", it is too immoral, etc...well I gotta tell you, it is only a source of -->entertainment<--.

Though the movie is not perfect, I'm still glad to give 5 out of 5 stars.  The car accident scenes are just plainly awesome... Acting is not perfect, but good enough.

1483087,4,B00005JLZK,"Be warned, this movie is not remotely frightening. Whereas the first FD attempted to undercut the silliness of the whole concept with some genuinely creepy sequences, this hare brained sequel simply plays the whole thing for laughs, and gets them. In truth the whole film is really nothing more than an excuse to string together some pretty inventive and grisly deaths (its extremely gory for an R rated picture), but the same could be said of a lot of horror movies and it's refreshing to see one so totally lacking in both pretension and narrative logic. The set up is pretty much the same as before: someone experiences a vision of an imminent disaster, narrowly avoids dying and in the process prevents the certain death of several other characters. Death won't give up however, and a series of freak 'accidents' start bumping off the support players. And so we are treated to 90 minutes of splatstick, with death scenes that share the same kind of dramatic dynamic as The Three Stooges or Pink Panther movies, except that someone typically ends up mushed into a fine paste by the end. For sure, if you're squeamish then the sight of people being crushed by panes of glass, beheaded by elevators, segmented by barbed wire, burned alive, blown up, trepanned by fence posts and generally reduced to the consistency of yoghurt probably won't endear you too much to the movie, but hey - its just a gore flick for gore hounds. It has too much gallows humour and too much of a sense of it's own lowly intellectual stature to ever try and qualify as a serious chiller - witness Tony 'Candyman' Todds welcome return as the gravel voiced mortician in a scenery chewing turn, or the sidesplitting final sight gag just before the credits roll. People clearly had a lot of fun making the movie, and it's infectious. The plot is all over the place - we get an utterly surreal exchange of dialogue in which we learn that apparantly Death is working backwards through his victims this time for, well, no real reason - but it doesn't bother me. The filmmakers had their priorities right, paint the screen red and to hell with rhyme or reason. For those who question why people would want to watch movies like this: don't get all moral and judgemental. Humans have always enjoyed watching the simple, honest butchery of their own kind in vivid colour. It's entertaining. It can be highly amusing. Live with it. At least it's only simulated and not in the gladiatorial arena.
Watch this movie and have a GREAT time!",1066694400,12,2501,4.699316628701594
1483088,4,B00005JLZK,I watched this movie with the bias that it would be only a cheap rip-off of it's original.  I actually found out it may stand on equal ground with the original.  The storyline is well constructed and the acting is good.  The plot follows closely with that of the first movie and it does a good job of adding onto that storyline.  The accident scenes are excellent.  I would recommend this movie to any person that enjoyed the first Final Destination.,1066694400,,450,4.506172839506172
1483089,4,B00005JLZK,"The gore is all this film has going for it. Okay well the crash scene is very unsettling, because it's so real looking, and pile ups happen everyday, but then it goes downhill from there. The hilarious and mean spirited ending is also a plus. The film unfortunately packs one cliche after another. It's another slasher film, and what's funny about it, is that it is trying to scare you, and at that it fails miserably. Plot? Well if you've seen the first, this is exactly like it, except this one has more gore. If you haven't seen the first, then you have no business watching this one then. Remember sequels are just a cash in and not a movie of itself. Sorry Hollywood, visuals and gore only produce chuckles, and not screams. Mess with our mind, and don't put us to sleep.

1483090,5,B00005JLZK,"This is one INTENSE movie.  Whether it's totally credible or too gory, it packs a wallop.  Director David Ellis' choreography of the opening pileup is devastating.  I found myself cringing as each vehicle rammed into the other; the sound was incredibly realistic.  A damned good opening for a film that is far superior to its predecessor.  Why that works, at least for me, is that the deaths are staged so carefully, how one coincidence after the other, adds up to ironic fatalities.  Take for instance the scene where David Paetkau as the lottery winning Evan sets in stage his doom.  He almost falls over toys scattered in the hallway; he throws some old spaghetti out of his window; knocks a magnet into the remaining spaghetti; and it just goes on.  He gets his new Rolex stuck in the sink's garbage disposal; sets the place on fire, manages to get out the apartment on the fire escape...and then, well won't spoil what happens then.  The incident with the pigeons is likewise eerily staged.  At each point you expect something to happen, it doesn't, and when the final denouement occurs, you sit there with jaw agape, wondering how this could happen.  The cast while certainly not Oliviers or Streeps, is adequately embodied:  Ali Later returns as Clear River, the survivor from the first film; A.J. Cook is a strong lead as Kimberly--she uses her eyes very well; Jonathan Cherry as the cocaine addicted Rory is an affable, if somewhat of a loser; Lynda Boyd as Nora faces a grim scene in the elevator that is equally frightening in its tenacious grip on suspense; Keegan Connor Tracy as the somewhat dimwitted Kat finds out the hard way about airbags; and Michael Landes as the dashing young cop is effectively charming.  Although the ""Carrie-ish"" ending is predictable, it still packs an ""explosive"" finish.

Plus They SEVERELY over exaggerated the blood-shed.
The only cool parts of it were the accident in the begining.( But when I watched that part again it sucked.)And the other cool part with the same results when i watched that part the second time was the when the window fell on the kid and crushed him. 2 parts cool once and sucked the second time.",1065744000,,666,4.2936507936507935
1483171,4,B00005JLZK,"From the commercials, one could easily believe that Final Destination is simply a retelling of the first story.  In other words, a group of people cheat death and then are hunted down by death to set things right.  But that would be wrong.
At first it seems that this is true.  A young woman has a vision of a terrible highway accident and refuses to get on the highway.  The people stuck on the ramp behind her do not get caught in the accident.
Unlike the first movie, Death does not wait.  No one-month hiatus here.  Saved victims immediately begin to drop.  But again, this is not just more of the same.  These people share a secret that they don't know about.  A secret you will have to see the movie to find out.
Another difference is that there is more hope in this movie.  Two characters return from the first movie; the only survivor and the mortuary worker.  But there are more scenes of death not happening, of death happening in more unexpected ways and a little less of the Rube Goldberg style accidents (although I liked the pool ball and mousetrap).
Although the gore is a little more obvious (typical in a sequel) the plot is somewhat better due to the additional dimensions.  The main character is also a relief.  In the first movie, the hero sulked too much and never tried to explain things to the police.  This time we have a hero who really works at surviving and saving others.

I also think about people who have been in or lost someone from a horrible car crash and go into this movie totally oblivious to what they will see.  That can't be right!

1483177,4,B00005JLZK,"A film by David R Ellis
The movie opens by referencing the first film, Final Destination.  We learn that this is the one year anniversary of the explosion of Flight 180 (the big event that triggered the events of Final Destination).  A girl is sleeping in her room with the television on.  The program is a news broadcast covering the anniversary.  The guest on the show talks about how death has a design, a plan and if that plan is interrupted, people are more likely to die in strange ways just so that death's plan is not too messed up. This was also the plot of the first Final Destination movie and being a direct sequel, we know this will be a major part of Final Destination 2.
After the scene setting the stage for the movie, we move into the actual plotline of the movie.  Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) and 3 of her friends are taking a road trip.  They are stopped on an on-ramp to get onto the freeway.  We see Kimberly merge onto the road and keep driving, and there is a huge accident, visually impressive.  Even this multiple vehicle (and I do mean multiple) accident comes up with some creative way to kill folks.  Everyone dies.  The scene shifts and Kimberly is still on the on-ramp.  It was only a vision and it freaked her out.  She stops her van sideways on the on-ramp and nobody gets on the highway.  The officer trying to get Kimberly to calm down is a witness to a horrible accident that happens just as Kimberly said it would.  She saved the life of everyone on the on-ramp, except for her three friends who are still in the van as it gets run down by a semi.
Back at the police station, Kimberly is insisting that everyone who survived will die in a specific order and only the police officer on the scene believes her.  It isn't until the first survivor dies that people start believing.  To try to figure this out and find a way to beat it, Kimberly goes to get help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor from Flight 180, and the only survivor from the aftermath.  The rest of the movie follows Kimberly as she tries to save everyone from being randomly killed.  She continues to have visions and picks up on signs of what may be coming.
The real joy of this movie is in the creative and inventive death scenes.  Sure, some are a little gruesome and I cringed a couple of times, but they were so well thought out that I couldn't wait to see how the next person would be killed.  Final Destination 2 is not any different from the first movie, but because of the creativity of the deaths, I didn't mind at all.  I like how the movie teased me with one kind of death but turned it into something completely different but equally impressive.  Anytime I thought I figured out a death, the movie turned it to something else.  It kept me on edge waiting for the next kill and the movie had a perfect flow to it.  I'm not sure if the movie is better than the first, but it is just as good.  If you've seen the first movie, you know exactly what you are getting into.  If you haven't, this is a fun movie with a lot of creative kills.  The movie exceeds the quality of its subject matter and is actually a pretty good movie.",1064188800,,3154,4.292724196277495

1483208,3,B00005JLZK,"The surprising success of Final Destination, ensured that it was only a matter of time before a sequel hit the screens, and surely not to disappoint, there it is.
This success was interesting, because the film mixes your average blend of gore and thrills with the universal question of mortality: Can Death be inevitable? When the time comes, does it really mean just that and you can not escape it? (assuming the grumpy grim reaper has made too long a journey to go back empty handed!)
Well,I seem to be in a minorty here, but I really did not like this sequel much. Not because it is a bad movie, it surely has its moments, but because I found it very similar to the first! Final Destination 2 is a bland, bland movie. I believe the filmmakers concentrated more on how to make the next death scene more gruesome and gory than the previous one, in a style that will make Dario Argento proud, instead of working on developing and expanding the story more. Surely they might have thought if the formula of the first film brought in the dollars, why not use the same one for the sequel, but somehow I found the two films identical as a result.
Final Destination 2 is heavy without being intellectually challenging, and gruesome without being scary.
The acting is pretty average as well,the best performance given by Final Destination veteran Ali Larter.
On the other hand the Extras on the DVD are very good, exepct for the fact that there are '?' everywhere in the menu, which was very annoying! I mean did the studio assume that the viewer need all the help he/she can get in figuring out how to select the widescreen option??
So at the end..(I am afraid I can not avoid this 'end', no matter how I try to escape it)..Final Destination 2 is Final Destination with new faces and new deaths. Nothing less, nothing more..",1064016000,,1818,4.545731707317073

I rented it this past months and can say I was wrong on most accounts, FD2 delivers high thrills with more gore and a freeway car crash pile up that will leave you stunned and wondering how it was pulled off for film. On the other hand, I felt FD1 had a more solid ending to it, where as this one seemed tired and over pushed into the ""yes there will be a part 3"" category of endings. For all around performance Ali Larter still remains my favorite because she was carried over from the original as well as the ""Candyman"" actor who is back playing the sort of grim reaper death info guy.

1483212,4,B00005JLZK,"Thinking that this was something different from your usual horror flick, I decided to give it a try.  I think the title of my review sums up what this movie is all about very well.  Rube Goldberg was a cartoonist who conjured up complex ways to do very mudane things.  The process of accomplishing the various mundane things (from scraching your back to opening a can of beans) was then drawn up as a cartoon which wasn't meant to be taken seriously, only for laughs.
Each scene in this movie where someone is killed represents the end of a chain reaction of seemingly random events.  In order to stop the chain reaction or keep someone from getting killed, one must break the link in the chain.  One must know the chain of events before hand in order to do this however.  This is where the one psychic girl comes into the story.  After noticing a chain or random freak accidents, a group of people decide to band together and try to stop the strange deaths from happening under the guidance of the one psychic girl.",1062288000,,1016,4.45945945945946

It had better (or just less annoying) characters that you don't want to die (the first movie made the mistake of being populated with awful characters), more inventive death attacks and developed the idea of death having a design more interestingly.

Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is the only remaining survivor of flight 180 and has now willingly committed herself to a rubber room to escape death's shadow. But lets herself out into the world when learning of a new disaster. A teenager (AJ Cook) on a trip with her pals has a premonition of an incredibly violent freeway pile-up (so more inventive than a distant boom in the sky; the first movie's disaster) and stalls traffic in her lane. Sure enough the pile up happens and all the drivers who she stalled should be dead too. So death begins to stalk them. But no one has any time for the warnings Clear Rivers has to offer and so death offs them in increasing gory fashion.

It's cheesy and pure popcorn fun but you'll definitely enjoy it. If only the first one didn't exist then this would be more unique experience.

1483263,2,B00005JLZK,"FINAL DESTINATION 2

(USA - 2003)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

One year after events in the original FINAL DESTINATION (2000), a young girl (A.J. Cook) experiences a premonition which saves the lives of several people during a horrific traffic accident, but Death has no intentions of letting them go...

Whereas the first movie was a novelty item which turned the so-called 'slasher' format on its head, FINAL DESTINATION 2 bears all the hallmarks of an opportunistic rehash: Weak plotting, interchangeable characters, and a narrative which revolves around little more than a series of increasingly elaborate death scenes. The empty-headed script - co-written by J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress (respectively, director and co-writer of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT) - opens with an extraordinarily vivid traffic pile-up, followed by a series of equally bizarre set-pieces (watch out for that barbed wire fencing!) in which people are squashed, stabbed, burnt, broken and blasted into eternity, with various false scares designed to misdirect the audience by establishing a number of fatal possibilities before unleashing the GENUINE fireworks from left-field. Ali Larter's extended cameo provides the only cast link to the original film, but her irritating non-performance is typical of a primarily young (read 'cheap') cast who - no matter how talented and enthusiastic - are compromised by dialogue and direction which are focused almost entirely on crowd-pleasing scenes of death and destruction, to the exclusion of all else.

To be fair, the set-pieces ARE spectacular and the narrative moves along at a rapid clip, and while some of the computer-generated visual effects aren't entirely convincing, the movie is as sleek and streamlined as they come. But for all its gore, FINAL DESTINATION 2 isn't remotely scary, merely glossy and unpleasant, epitomized by a closing 'gag' which sets the cap on an entirely vacuous enterprise. Whereas the first movie understood that spectacle is worthless if not supported by a genuine emotional undertow, this uninspired sequel strips the franchise down to its basic components, trading complexity and intelligence for a cynical manipulation of audience expectations.

Followed by FINAL DESTINATION 3 (2006).",1060732800,,2289,5.488636363636363

Just when you think that someone is going to die a certain way, they don't. Then out of nowhere a death you never saw coming. It is shocking and fun and exciting, and I loved every minute of it.

A.J. Cook is our protagonist, this time, as she hunts down the only original survivor from the first film, Clear Rivers, and attempts to understand how to defeat death. Also back for the second go-around is Tony Todd as Death's mysterious messanger.
The return of Larter's character is uneccesarry, done more for the marquee value of the sequel than anything else. Hell, she doesn't even color her hair in this one.

I have to say that I was highly entertained, and I am looking forward to going back and watching the first movie. (Alas, I am breaking the rule of sequence, but see opening sentence for explaination.)
The biggest surprise to me was the level of twisted humor that I found in this gory story.  I was also entertained by the fact that I was never completely prepared for how people died or were killed. (Just one spoiler, be careful who you save, because you never know when flying barbwire will slice you into various thirds.)
It was interesting to hear that this movie followed the same formula as the first, because I do not usually enjoy seeing that type of predictability but there is always the exception to rules. (Again, see my opening paragraph.)
The delivery of this story was effective, if gruesome, and I enjoyed the performances that this cast provided.  Not to provide an spoiler, but I must say that the ending made me jump and groan at the same time.  (BBQ anybody?)
On to the extras, this is an Infinifilm Edition, and I have a personal bias for these productions.  They provide a TON of extra features, and I really enjoy using the Infini feature to see where deleted scenes came from in the film, discovering bits of trivia and hearing interview clips based on certain scenes, but I also like the fact that I have the choice to watch it interactively or seperately in its entirety. (I haven't finished watching all of them, but I like to prolong the experience over repeated viewings or days when I just need some short bursts of entertainment.)
Overall, I would say that the DVD deserves a ""B+"" for the film, and an ""A+"" for the disc and features. (I would also say that fans of the ""Scream"" triology or the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series would enjoy this film.)",1059609600,3,1900,4.495652173913044
1483331,4,B00005JLZK,"I enjoyed this movie for the pure and simple fact that it gave me a chance to laugh at something people are generally a little frightened of.  I think that's what we all liked about the original.
  But, with the possible exception of the challenge of producing more gore, I hardly saw the point for a sequel here.  Of course, there is always the basic reason of more money for the filmakers, but I mean with regards to offering the moviegoer something.  This one really offered me little to nothing.
  The opening scene is certainly not for the faint of heart, or for anyone who ever wants to be comfortable driving on a freeway again.  From this scene to the last gruesome, but woefully predictable one, the movie forges ahead with an obvious disregard for an intelligent or original plot, and really leaves the viewer guessing as to why this or that happened.  Many scenes are easy to spot as poorly planned out, or poorly timed.
Bottom Line - If you want a good laugh, and to forget how serious death really is for an hour and a half, this is certainly the one for you.  If you're looking for a movie that will leave you thinking, (about anything other than what just happened) you should probably skip this one.",1059436800,,1215,4.4818181818181815
1483332,2,B00005JLZK,"I rented Final Destination 2 several nights ago, and it turned out to be pretty disappointing. I generally don't like scary movies, but I must say I liked Final Destination pretty well, for a scary movie. It was well done and had a good feeling of tension throughout the whole movie, in my opinion.
The sequel however, felt like little more than a series of gross-out CG effects strung together by pieces of the story from the first one.
The story is basically identical to the first movie... A teenager foresees a tragic accident in graphic detail and then somehow saves a group of people from dying in that event. This changes death's plan however, which [ticks] him off so he goes after them one by one, killing them in the order in which they were originally destined to die. The difference is that in the first one, the teenager was a boy, now it's a girl. And instead of an airplane explosion, it's a massive pile-up on the interstate.
There is also one other difference from the first movie, in this one there is apparently a way to stop death completely from trying to carry out his master plan, which is made evident to the teenagers with the help of the creepy undertaker from the first movie. He gives them a cryptic answer of something like ""new life is the only way to defeat death"" which they first assume means that the baby of the pregnant lady that was supposed to die in the crash has to be born to end the cycle. However later in the movie they discover this isn't the case, and another type of sacrifice must be made to stop death.
But like I said, all of that is just an excuse to string together the very over the top and graphic death sequences of each cast member. Out of the maybe 10 people that are featured in the movie, all of them have died terribly gruesome deaths by the end of the movie except for 2 of them. One gets a fire escape ladder smashed through his head, another is decapitated by an elevator, another it sliced into 3 sections by a flying barbwire fence, etc. No matter the method in which they die, they all seem to somehow explode into blood and guts. One guy just has a piece of glass dropped on him, but somehow that causes his entire body to disentegrate into a shower of blood spread out in a thirty foot radius.

  The film starts out with A.J. Cook's character going on a road trip with her friends. She has a vision of a huge traffic accident, she then blocks traffic to save everyone on that roads life. Then of course since everyone on that road was supposed to die death starts to kill them one by one like in the first film.
  The death scenes are incredibly gory and detailed but also seemed like ways you would've seen Kenny die on South Park. They're silly and heartless at the same time. It's like the film is trying to make death out to be funny a lot of time. Sorry but I didn't find 2 different scenes where young boys die right in front of their mothers very funny.

1483337,4,B00005JLZK,"It's very rare when a sequel is just as good, or better, than the original film. Especially in the horror/thriller genre. This film, a sequel to the smash 2000 hit, improves on the first film by a wide margin. This entry in the series seems deadlier, colder, more intense, and more death-like. It features great special effects, and gory demises that will please any fan who is into that. What I like about this one is how it doesn't ignore the first film. There are connections to it throughout the entire film. Plus, Ali Larter returns as Clear Rivers, one of the first film's survivors. It's the one year anniversary of the flight 180 tragedy from the first film. Kimberly(A.J. Cook), an attractive teen, is preparing for a road trip to Daytona Beach with some friends. While on the highway, Kimberly begins having odd, prophetic visions. A horrible accident breaks out on the highway and it ends with a horrible pile up. These next few minutes are incredibly wicked. Intense, scary, and pulse pounding. An incredibly well executed scene. It turns out to of been an premonition, but things begin to turn out how she saw them. The pile up occurs, but she and a handful of others who were meant to die, survive. Now, just as in the first, they have caused a rift in death's design. Helped by Officer Thomas Burke(Michael Landes), Kimberly tries to find out what is going on and to try to save herself and the other people who are on death's hit list. To help, she turns to Clear Rivers, the only one who has been thru this before. The six other people include a mother and son, a business woman on the rise, a stoner, a kid who just won the lotto, and a motorcyclist named Eugene. The filmmakers here took what they did in the original and built on it. The effects are more top notch, the make-up and horror is even better, and the whole game is deadlier. Director David Ellis really delivers the chills and fun of the whole thing. He takes you inside the moment and makes you feel every chill that runs up your spine whenver disaster looms. Some of the direction into the suspense is clever and really brings you into the whole action. The script is solid and clever and fun. Not everyone is as good as the script wants them to be, but they all get the job done. The script has a nice dose of sense of humor that perfectly balances itself between when it should be humorous and when it shouldn't be. There have been many films in the post-""Scream"" era that have tried to mix the humor with the terror, and it hasn't worked. This one does. It just fits naturally. The actors are pretty solid, if not overly spectacular. Ali Larter looks great, but it seems like she was wasted too much. What a pity. A.J. Cook does better than her and she is a lovely looking thing to boot. People might remember Michael Landes as Jimmy Olson from the first season of ""Lois And Clark"", or the short lived series ""Special Unit 2"". Tony Todd(""Candyman""), makes a return cameo as the creepy mortician as well. This isn't Oscar type stuff, but it is what it is and it definitley delivers the goods in full force. It's incredibly fun and entertaining. One thing is for sure tho. It will definitley have you on the alert once it's over.",1059264000,,3214,4.477001703577513
1483398,2,B00005JLZK,"Being a huge fan of the first film I was looking forward to watching the sequel.  The premise of the original placed a clever tone on the horror genre, however Final Destination 2 failed to capture, much less exceed the its predecessor.  A good sequel should take the story farther than the original.  This movie placed more focus on finding inventive ways to off the characters rather than develop and enganging and suspensful story.  Don't get me wrong, some of the deaths were inventive but the film for lack of a better word lacked gusto.  The first film took time in displaying the death's design, the sequel on the other hand showed the design early on (and it was predictable), so the only thing you had to look forward to was not who was going to die/of if they could find a way to escape, but rather how they were going to die (or how horribly they were going to die). Gore has its place, but alone it makes a movie rather empty.

Of course when you basis of comparison are to revisionist films like ""Halloween 2"" and ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" along with films that have no conception of what worked in the original like ""The Exorcist II: The Heretic"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,"" the bar is set pretty low.  The sequel to ""The Blair Witch Project"" had a good idea, but botched what to do with it.  The makers of ""Final Destination 2"" had enough sense to take what worked in the original and give it a slight twist.
On the first anniversary of Flight 180 there is the most horrible chain of highway accidents in the history of movies.  Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) is the last to die and then suddenly realizes it was all an instantaneous premonition.  Like the hero of the first film she is able to find confirmation that she has a glimpse of what is about to happen within arm's reach.  She takes direct action to spare the lives she had just seen lost and round two of this particular dance with death is underway.
On the one hand all you really need to know is that if you liked the original ""Final Destination"" you will not be grossly disappointed by the sequel.  Once again you have Death coming after the people on his list by channeling the spirit of Rube Goldberg.  This sequel plays with its audience by constantly making you think you know exactly how the next victim is going to kick the bucket and then pulling a last second switch.  The other difference of substance has to do with the relationship between this final and the original, which turns out to be something more than the return of Clear Rivers (Ali Larter).  However, the biggest difference is that this time around the characters are hip to the constant foreshadowing that presages each gruesome demise (Death is apparently a frustrated movie director).
You could say this is going too far in changing the rules of the game and off the top of my head I do not remember if there was as much foreshadowing as in the original.  A return visit to the creepy guy at the morgue reveals a new bit of information that comes under the ""Something I would have liked to have known earlier"" (like in the first film) category.  But if the alternative is rehashing the original film with a new set of exercises in creative killing, then these new wrinkles are acceptable twists.  ""Final Destination 2"" is not as much fun as the original, which is par for the course, but it is not an insult to the audience that liked the first film either.  You also have all the fun Infinifilm options on the DVD so that you can understand the meaning of every name in the film (e.g., Kimberly CORMAN as in Roger Corman, director of ""Dementia 13"" and other classic cheapo exploitation splatter flicks).
Final Note: ""Final Destination 2"" meets my definition of gratuitous nudity, which is when the half-naked person is not one of the main characters but somebody who shows up just to provide the nudity (compare this with ""Laurel Canyon"" as an example of non-gratuitous flashing).",1059091200,,3144,4.5711743772241995
1483400,4,B00005JLZK,"I kept trying to figure out WHY I enjoyed this movie so much, and it finally hit me...I liked, understood and identified with all these people.  A clever and ironic script mixed with some strong performances, particulary from A.J. Cook, Lynda Boyd and Jonathan Cherry make this a ""must have"" for every horror buff.
These characters aren't some loser teens waiting to see who dies first, they are fully fleshed out and scared to death as creepy ""accidents"" snuff them out.  The opening freeway scene still takes my breath away, even after seeing the ""tricks"" through Infinifilm.  The characters react to each other just like you'd expect vulnerable, scared people thrown together to act. Excellent effort, holds up well to repeat viewings.
By the way, Infinifilm is AWESOME!!!  New Line has scored a home run with this feature.  The pop ups are sweet!!  Just when I'm thinking ""How'd they do that?"", I can find out by automatically pausing the movie at the exact scene.  Home Run!
So why not 5 stars?  Two reasons: First the conversation scene on the way to the hospital linking the movie to FD1.  It's not needed and far too ""Zen"".  Secondly, the final scene of the movie.  It seems silly and sophmoric, and out of place with the overall tone of the film.
Solid effort, better than expected acting and INCREDIBLE FX make this one heck of a destination to reach!",1059091200,,1361,4.72457627118644
1483401,5,B00005JLZK,"I have a confession to make. I am ashamed to admit it, but I did not hate ""Final Destination 2"". In fact, I liked it. A lot. And not only that (and here is the really sad part) but it creeped me out. A lot.
Okay, now that I've confessed my guilt over this little pleasure of a movie, I'm going to tell you why I liked it. I enjoyed the first ""Final Destination"", because it was original and creepy. The vision that the main character, Alex, had in the beginning of the movie (where the plane exploded) made my fear of flying 100 times worse, mainly because of how graphic it was. The scene was filmed wonderfully, and really showed you what it must look like inside the plane when it explodes. But as terrifying as his vision was, it pales in comparison to the one had by the young woman in the sequel. Kimberly (played by A.J. Cook) is driving to Daytona with her friends when she has a vision of a pile-up on the highway, in which she and her friends, and a half a dozen other people, die gruesome deaths. She, like Alex, panics and uses her SUV to block traffic, so that she can prevent the accident from happening. Everyone in her vision is blocked in back of her, but the accident happens anyway - only not with the same people in her vision. Now, of course, since they all cheated death, death is coming to cheat every one of them out of life. Everything from then on plays out similarly to the first film.
However, while there are a lot of similarities to the first one (it even contains the soul surviving character from the first one, Clear Rivers, played by Ali Larter), ""Final Destination 2"" adds a new twist to the story, so that it's not the same movie. Like the first one, the beginning of the movie is the best part, but the rest of it certainly doesn't lack in the suspense department. I will admit my heart rate was accelerated a few times during the whole hour and a half. I was tempted to give the movie four stars, mainly because there are a few really silly parts and inconsistencies and little things that were overlooked in the editing room. And the ending was, well, kinda stupid. However, the acting was pretty good (for a slasher film), the suspense was suspensful, it was humorous where it was supposed to be, and the gory death sequences were fun to watch, even though some didn't have to be as gory as they were. If you liked the first ""Final Destination"", I think it's safe to say you'll like this one too. In fact, I actually think I liked this one better. It's not top-of-the-line horror, and it won't see any Academy Awards. But it may accomplish at least one thing: I'm pretty sure that any one who sees this movie will try to pay more attention to the road when they're driving. No one wants to end up in Kimberly's vision.",1059004800,2,2758,4.326254826254826
1483402,3,B00005JLZK,"The idea of cheating death was done quite well in the first film, which offered moviegoers a chilling, authentic recreation of an actual plane crash. In the sequel, we get an equally exciting highway crash that is superbly created and edited by the filmmakers. This film is also pretty adept at some horrifying deaths that cry ""Hit the rewind button."" All in all the film is definately worth a peek. It's also a lot better than some of the garbage that has been hitting movie screens this summer.",1059004800,,496,4.6477272727272725
1483403,2,B00005JLZK,"Writer/director James Wong (The One) helped make the first Final Destination, with its far-stretching premise and myriad of coincidences, work with a clear internal logic.  More important, the first film was able to create characters you cared about, so that their impending doom made for some great nail-biting moments.
Final Destination 2 goes to show that the concept in the hands of lesser talents pretty much falls apart under its own weight.  The scripting is just ridiculous, especially in the last 20 minutes when everything seems to happen with no orchestration whatsoever.  Characters make up conclusions that make no sense, and director David R. Ellis is so preoccupied with designing cool-looking visuals that fully three quarters of the cast look like they came straight out of their first week of acting school.  Lead actress A.J. Cook may be pretty -- she looks like a young Kimberly Williams -- but she spends so much of the film whimpering and crying that the character remains a blank, with none of her actions generating either character growth or catharsis.  Ali Larter brings some spark reprising her role as Clear Rivers, but the character is also a flatline after her first 10 minutes.  I'm not surprised that director Ellis' C.V. is filled with stunt credits.  Most of the stunts in this film do look pretty good, but without any character sympathy to speak of, there is no emotional stake to all the violence.  You see a lot of explicit gore (impaled heads -- two of them; a Robocop-style human pancake; incineration in a close-up; a human tri-section with intestines showing), but you never feel much threat because these aren't people you care about.
But I did derive some diabolical pleasure out of seeing these screaming, whining, cardboard-cutout characters chopped to pieces.  This film is so bad at times that you just have to laugh at the blatant incompetences and corniness.  If the filmmakers' intentions was for the audience to laugh *at* them rather than *with* them, then they've succeeded in spades.  ""You did it...you defeated death""...that's got to be the most ridiculous moment I've seen in a major studio release in years.
Two stars for the wild stunts, the bad yet amusing humour, and Ali Larter.  Treat this movie with the contempt it deserves, and I think you'll be able to have some fun watching it.  Got to be one of the dumbest films ever made, though.",1059004800,6,2401,4.92803970223325

(for those that thought this movie was too gory, or over done, then they have never worked in the medical field or around death to know this is reality, ...)

An elaborate and complicated car crash that involved people connected to the first movie's victims was a bit farcical. Barbecues never tasted so good. Pancakes have a new meaning. I always run through pigeons so they don't make a mess on my car. That's all I have to say about that.",1058745600,,531,4.6
1483479,2,B00005JLZK,"I must say that when I saw Final Destination I was shocked.  Never a movie had scared me so much when and after seeing it. I was traumatized and it awoke a certain paranoia in me ;P It is one of my favorite horror movies.
Then one day I saw there was a sequel.  I had no expectations but I saw it anyway.  God!! It was bad!! Such a good storyline destroyed by bad filmmakers.  First of all, it had logic leaps and I don't know if people noticed this:  The year starts off one year after the 180 tragedy.  HELLO!! The first movie ended one year after the 180 tragedy, with the survivors in Paris celebrating (and dying!) and you tell me that Claire (Ali LArter) had the time to go back to the U.S. and reclude herself in a mental hospital that same day?!? The other thing, when that certain kid gets super crushed by that crystal why would you get the body out in a body bag if there's only squashed pieces??
Second, I had never seen such bad acting in my life...you know, I know scary movies don't usually have good acting but the first final destination had really good ones especially from ALi Larter, Devon and Kerr Smith. The only stand-out: A.J. Cook...
Third, A.J.'s premonitions. In the first movie Devon saw clues that he then sorted out and desciphered. But nooooooo, here A.J. has visions...and really simple ones...practically telling the viewer what exactly is going to happen.  Besides, now you see like an actual representation of death, a somewhat physical form.  Where's the fun in that?  There's also the pacing, too many deaths are frequent...they should've been more apart from each other.  It's like they ran out of time and decided to kill most of the cast in one short uncreative, dull, cliche, predicatble scene.
Fourth, storyline was not that good, it was very weak and the character held no closeness or bonds like in the first one. Just a bunch of strangers hanging together before they die.
Fifth, the movie is way too gory, unnecessarily gory...God, that much gore is for sick people.  Hey folks, Death was less messier and more creative in the first one.
Sixth, the ending [was very bad]!! Come on, if it is predictable do it stylish not fakish!!
Then you say, why two stars?? I have to admit that the first scene (with the car accident) is great.  That scene stays in your mind and haunts you, besides it leaves you shocked.  Also the death of the kid was really cool....though the logic leap aforementioned...and Ali Larter is what gave the movie more meaning and more familiarity.

1483481,3,B00005JLZK,"Surprise!  ""Final Destination 2"" is, unlike dreadful ""Hidden 2"" or ""Spieces 2,"" better than you might expect.  But the thing is, you know, how much do you expect from the sequel to the surprise hit a few years ago?
Well, anyway, though some say rightly that this is more like a remake of the original than a sequel, the plot itself requires some knowledge about the first one (which I hope you have already seen).  The same premise is seen again.  At the entrace to the hightway, a young woman Kimberly (A.J. Cook, aptly recruited from one of the girls of ""Virgin Suicides"") ""sees"" a terrible car accident.  Prompted (or scared) by her own premonition, she blocks the ramp.  And as you know, Kimberley actually witnesses a big pile-up which should have killed her and several other drivers.
But Destiny (or call it Death) doesn't like this kind of intervention, so it steps in among the lives of the survived people, killing them one by one in the strangest fashion.  Kimberley has to fight back (against Death?), with an assistance from one of the survivors of the original (Ali Larter), fending off the shing blade of the Grim Reaper.  But can she?  Can anyone?
Well, the point is NOT that ""can she?"" part -- it's about more violent, and more bizarre (some call ridiculous) way of death.  It's a gore-fest, you might say, and right, as far as you want that, you will be satisfied.  The most impressive part of ""FD2"" is its well-crafted, chillingly realistic car accident scene.  That is not a surprise after all, because the director is David R. Ellis, second unit director (action sequence) for ""Matrix Reloaded.""
Frankly, I don't still get the logics of the film about the order of the casulalities.  I don't know whether or not people really get killed in the way depicted.  But anyway it's just a movie which doesn't aspire to be Academy winner; it's just fun though still things often look too contrived.  And some ""deaths"" resemble those found in other films -- see ""Down"" featuring Naomi Watts if you have a chance.
More gory, more violent, even with the unexpected ending that might make you giggle (I mean it), ""Final Destination"" is surprisingly good for a sequel.  But I cannot help thinking that the whole rules about death are getting annoyingly complex, and I found them very hard to understand.  The film is OK, but its premise which was interesting at first now seems well used up.
By the way, Japanese title of the film is ""Dead Coaster.""",1057881600,,2457,4.676744186046512

1483483,4,B00005JLZK,"<spoilers> The original Final Destination virtually redefined the teenage horror genre.  Instead of the cliche man in a mask killer, death itself is responsible for the teens who are elaborately killed off one by one.
  Final Destination improves upon everything the original set the groundwork for.  There is only one returning character, (and one or two of the survivors from the first film have been killed in the time between the two movies) but the story isn't this film's strong point.
  The death sequences have been significantly pumped-up since the first one.  These are the most elaborate death scenes ever put to film, and while the movie isn't genuinely creepy (there are one or two jump out of your seat thrills) it will make you afraid to drive on the freeway the way Jaws made you afraid to swim in the ocean.  You'll see what I mean if you check this film out.  Ignore most of the story, and enjoy the ride.

Like Final Destination before it, this is a more creative horror film. It's not a hack and slash, but more a dark comedy of sorts. The fun of this film comes not from the events leading to death, but death itself. Luckily there's a large cast and the inbetween time is quite enjoyable.
The scene that puts this movie over the top however, comes right at the start. Just like FD's plane explosion, it sets the pace for the entire movie. FD2's highway scene is simply an amazing event. It's jaw dropping, it's gruesome, and it's fun.
They thankfully went for a strong R rating, and didn't shy away from getting really gruesome. They also threw in biker babe who briefly flashes early in the film, which probably should have been left out. Otherwise though, the suspense to gore ratio is just about right.
