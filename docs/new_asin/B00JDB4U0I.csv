6355242,2,B00JDB4U0I,"Other reviewers seem to love this movie, which plays as a documentary of a child's birthday party, and I'm glad they enjoyed it so much. I don't get it. The couple who are throwing the party for their little girl spend much of their time bickering and don't seem very loving. Only in a few short scenes do we get to see any affection and tenderness.

The movie seems to be all over the place. There's a heartfelt scene with one of the mothers that will bring you to tears. That is probably the only scene with real depth. The rest is a jumble of scenes and people and a clown who dies immediately. Too much is going on and none of it seems to be go anywhere.

None of the characters are particularly likeable or memorable. They're just there. And this movie is the same. It's just there, without much purpose or direction.",1408233600,4,822,4.3311688311688314
6355243,5,B00JDB4U0I,"This is a sweet, very VERY funny, quirky gem of a movie.  It has some bizarre, yet oddly believable, twists.  We've all lived through those events we plan so well and expect to be picture perfect and then life gets in the way.  The cast is perfect.  There is some of the funniest comedy I've ever seen.  I watched it with my teens (a boy and a girl) and we all loved it.  We all laughed at some different spots more than others - which is cool.  It affects different people differently but it affects people. We all loved the music choices too!!!!  The end was the bow that tied it all together.  It is really just a lovely, funny, quirky, story and worth watching.  Well done!  (I am going to watch it again today!  :)",1406851200,2,719,4.205882352941177

6355247,5,B00JDB4U0I,"First off, let me set the record straight: I HATE ""heartwarming, charming"" crap.  Hate it.  I am NOT a Hallmark/Lifetime-type fan AT ALL.  So it's with great surprise  if not great pleasure  that I recommend this movie.  Which I didn't expect to like, if for no other reason than everyone said, ""Oh, you're gonna love this!""  Which, to me, conjures up 'Nam flashbacks to that time I was talked into seeing THE YA YA SISTERHOOD of the AMERICAN QUILT or whatever the hell it was.  But I digress.  The truth is, I really enjoyed this movie.  It's got just the right amount of sarcasm and clever wit to off-set the tear-jerking aspects, yet it's meaty and emotional enough to walk away from it feeling like you ingested more than five pounds of candy corn.  I won't get into describing the plot, but I will say the sequence with Jane Badler made me feel like someone had intimate access to my every want and need and put it on screen.  I'm not even joking.  THAT part could be a whole entire movie in and of itself.  But honestly, I guess my point is, I hate movies that try too hard to be emotional because they think they've got an easy audience of Kleenex-grasping tear junkies, and this one really sneaks up on you in a really uncomplicated, ingenuous way that, quite frankly, I wish more movies were like.  I dunno.  It's a good one.  Check it out.",1404000000,5,1349,4.41869918699187

6355250,1,B00JDB4U0I,This Birthday Cake was stale!  I was so disappointed in this movie.  The description of it sounded really good so I thought it would be worth buying.  But after I received it and started watching it I was so disappointed.  I shut it off after the scene with the mother having a reconciliation with the son.  It was just too overwrought and drawn out to watch.  And came across totally insincere. The acting was amateurish at best.  I wish I  could send it back for a refund!,1463529600,,474,4.367816091954023

6355252,5,B00JDB4U0I,It is hilarious and also sends a message about accepting gay in your family. It teaches you to love and accept people for who they are.  I watch it over and over because each time you get another lesson from it.,1461715200,,211,4.146341463414634
6355253,5,B00JDB4U0I,I have watched this movie several times and I think it is the funniest gay movie I have ever seen! The part about the black baby cake was hilarious and yes I am black and I was not offended it was dam funny. The acting was superb by all.,1461024000,,237,3.857142857142857
6355254,1,B00JDB4U0I,A horrible mess.  They tried to pack way too many stereotypes into an already muddled story and ended up with something that never made any sense.,1459209600,,146,4.615384615384615

6355259,5,B00JDB4U0I,"I meant to write this review a long time ago... better late than never! A friend of mine a while back had posted a link on social media for a short mockumentary film he's in called Groom's Cake... I fell in love with it and became an instant Chad Darnell fan - he's brilliant. When I heard there would be a feature length sequel to Groom's Cake called Birthday Cake, I followed along with the production on social media and impatiently waited for its release. My friend, who is also in Birthday Cake, let me know the film would be screening at the 2013 Qfilms Festival in Long Beach California and I didn't hesitate to go. I loved Birthday Cake even more than I thought I would. It tugs at every emotion... I smiled, got a little mad, cried some and laughed a lot. The story moves and never drags, the chemistry and balance of the relationships between the characters is just right. You really can't ask for much more than that for an enjoyable film. I was honored when my friend introduced me to Chad Darnell after the screening and I was able to tell him face to face how much I enjoyed it. Granted, not everybody ""gets"" mockumentaries, but if you do, I highly recommend it!",1431820800,,1176,4.39908256880734
6355260,4,B00JDB4U0I,"Just finished watching ""birthdaycake"" released by Aritztical.
Written and directed by Chad Darnell, ""birthdaycake,"" is the rather brilliant followup to Darnell's short film ""Grooms Cake;"" which is also included in this DVD.
Both ""Grooms Cake"" and ""birthdaycake"" are true to life looks at what makes two people get married and want to have children and build, and hopefully unite their dysfunctional families that I could relate to on many levels - especailly since both Jeff H. and Zack once did give some thought to putting a prescribed sedative [that the doctor gave me after Dad and Mom passed away] in a glass of Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi so that I would get some sleep.
""birthdaycake"" is a brillant character comedy that show viewers why Daniel and Steven are a believable as two people in love who support each other when they get thrown curves.
Chad Darnell paints a vivid potrait and also takes risks as an actor that few would dare.  I am looking forward to his next movie.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
 I would have given this movie five stars; but for some reason Chad decided to potray the Tea Party in a bad light, which detracted a bit from the movie; and I don't reward anything that delibrately misrepresents political views.  [Yes, Jeff H., Zack, and I are Conservative Republicans.]

6355263,1,B00JDB4U0I,"After reading all of the positive reviews for this film, I went back and tried watching it a second time...but again, I got about 30 minutes into it, then turned it off.  I have to agree with reviewer D. Ahlander: Why was this film even made?  It was disjointed, hard-to-follow, and not even mildly entertaining.  This past weekend, I also viewed the films Eighteen and Funkytown.  In all fairness, neither of those films were comedies (which, I believe, this one was supposed to be), but they both provided a movie-watching experience that was light years beyond what I got from Birthday Cake.  Believe me, I LOVE silly, screwball comedies (Airplane, Scary Movie, & Police Squad! are some of my all-time favorite films), but Birthday Cake?  Uh, not so much...",1417996800,2,760,4.852713178294573

6355265,3,B00JDB4U0I,"It is o.k., but only o.k. The script and the visual images rely on a cadre of too-familiar cliches and situations. Dead clowns? We got them!  Sexy hunks? We got those too.  Effeminate stereotype? We got that covered in spades.",1417392000,,226,4.625

8649884,5,B00JDB4U0I,"I started to hate this movie. it started out most offensively with the protagonists horrified at the arrival of their adopted child being female and the possibility that it might be black (even though it is clearly indistinguishable from white). But, as I watched a few more minutes of it, I realized that this is a collection of truly obnoxious people bouncing off each other at celebratory child's party. The acting, script and direction are terrific and the story is, after-all, heartwarming and funny. Apparently the offensive stuff was limited to the first five minutes. The rest is great.",1467244800,,594,5.01010101010101
