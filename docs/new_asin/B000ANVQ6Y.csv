  When i first watched those programs i was astonished. The detail explanations of events and people really can make a person wonder.

In general this collection will proof a worthy buy, i recommend this for teachers, students and anyone interested in world history, you really CAN learn much by watching this, and as for me it will be of great help for my academic purposes.

If you get it you will NOT regret it!!",1193961600,40,532,4.453608247422681
2390128,4,B000ANVQ6Y,"I've been reviewing areas of history that I don't usually cover to balance out my general knowledge.  No video can compress into a couple of hours the libraries that have been written on these subjects, but I watched them with a pad nearby and started searching names and topics for further study.  Then I added books on those areas to my wish list here on Amazon.

All in all, each disc is a great review if you're rusty or a place to start if you're moving into new areas of history.",1173398400,45,485,4.3076923076923075
2390129,5,B000ANVQ6Y,"I was very impressed with this series.  I learned very much, escpecailly about the Medici's.  If you enjoy history/documentaries you'll love this collection.  I was so impressed I've ordered other Empire series.  Props to PBS on this one!",1167868800,34,238,5.184210526315789
2390130,5,B000ANVQ6Y,A fantastic variety of history documentaries from the Empires series. My favorite is the Japan disc.,1480636800,,100,5.3125

2390133,4,B000ANVQ6Y,"Good series of PBS documentaries on different historical periods.  Includes ancient Greeks, Ancient Egypt, 1st Century Rome, the development of  Shogun Japan and Renaissance Italy.  The styles of each are a bit different, my favorite being the one on Japan.",1455667200,,257,5.375
2390134,5,B000ANVQ6Y,So much to learn! Understanding our past is key to understanding the present! Thank you PBS for brilliant work.,1455494400,,111,4.894736842105263
2390135,4,B000ANVQ6Y,It's a great educational piece of work. I enjoyed all of them and have loaned it out to my children already. I really liked  Egypt and the Medici volumes I realized how little knew about those periods.,1441843200,,201,4.4324324324324325

2390137,5,B000ANVQ6Y,Probably the best set of DVD's on ancient history I've seen.  The Greek one was especially well done.,1420675200,,101,4.611111111111111
2390138,5,B000ANVQ6Y,I had seen most of the episodes at one time or another and in one form or another. It's great to have the entire collection together as a unit and the production values are superb. Historically they are probably the most accurate and least contrived representations of all the periods covered. The price is fantastic and I highly recommend the series to any and everyone with the slightest interest in the history of perhaps the most influential cultures that shaped our way of thinking today.,1420416000,,493,4.811764705882353

2390145,5,B000ANVQ6Y,"This is a documentary, not movies - so if you don't like documentaries i would advise not to get this. The price was reasonable and i have so far watched ROME - very detailed.

I am enjoying this collection.",1392595200,,207,4.3076923076923075
2390146,5,B000ANVQ6Y,Very prompt!  Got it just before I needed it.  I teach Humanities and it holds their attention while they learn!,1392422400,,112,4.55
2390147,5,B000ANVQ6Y,These are very good and informative documentaries. I really enjoyed every one of them. I would highly recommend these to others.,1386460800,,128,5.142857142857143
2390148,5,B000ANVQ6Y,"If you like history, get this.  A very good collect.  Loved them all.  I was a little disappointed in Rome however. It wasn't bad. It was just a very different and soft approach to a very full subject.  I have definitely seen better on Rome.

Egypt and Greece were wonderful!  Japan was all new to me so that was great.  I particularly loved the Medici,  I think they did an outstanding job with this particular subject.  Really one of the best things out there for a good overall history of the Medici and the Renaissance and time leading to the Reformation.",1374105600,2,559,4.455445544554456
2390149,5,B000ANVQ6Y,"Even though the Roman DVD deals only with the first half of the Roman Empire (Republic Period), it is divided into chapters that are helpful.  The Greeks has some fantastic reenactments explaining the Battles of Marathon & Salamis, the trial of Socrates, how the first democracy works and many tidbits of Greek culture and architecture.  It explains the downfall of Athens. Egypt, as usual, has its chapters on important pharaohs. But the one my students really love is: The Medici, Godfathers of the Renaissance.  It is divided up into 4 lengthy Chapters. First with Cosimo de' Medici and how he made the dynasty; second is about the Life of Lorenzo the Magnificent - having sections on Botticelli, the botched assassination plot by the Pazzi family, his wife and children, and how he spent the fortune, mentioning Savonarola & the Bonfire of the Vanities.  The third chapter is devoted to Lorenzo's influence with many artists including Michelangelo & Leonardo da Vinci. It tells you how the 2 Medici sons became Popes and even about the Reform happening in Germany during Pope Leo X's rule.  I haven't looked at the DVD on Japan - that is for spare time.  It is well done, pretty accurate and it holds the students interest.  Worthwhile to add to your collection.",1373068800,7,1266,4.8604651162790695

2390151,5,B000ANVQ6Y,"These dvd's were fun to watch and great family /educational shows that are more history than drama reenactment, although the history itself is rather dramatic! I would recommend them to friends. Since I bought these I've probably watched each show 2 or 3 times, they are absorbing.",1357344000,2,281,5.0
2390152,4,B000ANVQ6Y,Very enjoyable and informative.  DVDs are well made and told.  Makes one think and question which is a good thing.,1356739200,,114,4.65
2390153,5,B000ANVQ6Y,What a great collection of History elements. I would like to have them online so I could see them on my PC . Great video well done. PBS Rocks,1353110400,2,141,3.896551724137931
2390154,3,B000ANVQ6Y,"If you are an educated historical buff I think you will prefer a different collection.  For instance, The Roman Empire's movie surrounds one 'king' and barely mentions other contributing leaders. Another description might state that this book is an enticement for an indepth study.  The acting is minimal.  A newbie could enjoy this series.",1346284800,16,340,5.2592592592592595
2390155,5,B000ANVQ6Y,"My dad and stepmother just LOVE this collection.  Side note: they both really like history stuff.  Every time I speak to him he mentions this.  They have been watching this a little bit at a time for 2 months now.  He wants to hurry and finish it so he can let me watch it, but is taking his time so its not done too quickly....  Guess I will be waiting to see it :)  Great recommendation for a gift Amazon!!!",1327708800,3,409,4.05
2390156,4,B000ANVQ6Y,"I bought the entire collection and have just started working with ""The Roman Empire in the First Century"" in my classroom. The information is good and my kids seem interested in the material, but the DVDs are hard to work with. There is no information or scene list provided with the DVDs. You have to work with the menu on the disc itself which gives you nothing but a series of cryptic titles. For example,I want to review the Christianity section just before Christmas, but I have to watch through the DVD to find the specific parts I need. The title of one section is ""Blessed are the Meek"" which helps, but that's all there is. Even the online lessons PBS offers have no time or scene-based correlation to the DVD. They offer specific portions of the episode to download, but don't tell you where they are if you already have the disc. These pieces would be much more useful in the classroom with just a little more help from PBS.",1323820800,16,935,4.473684210526316
2390157,5,B000ANVQ6Y,"The PBS Empires series of Documentaries is among my favorite of all time. Each of the 2-3 hours long titles brings individual episodes of human history to life in an as much as entertaining as educational fashion through original images of locations and objects, re-enactments as well as great original music. I have not seen a PBS Empires title that wasn't great and only regret that they made too few of them over the years. This DVD collections provides access to this great series at a bargain price. Almost 1,000 minutes of great content for less than $70. You almost cannot beat that.

Next to the titles in this collection; I can also recommend the following ones:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-Martin-Luther/dp/B00078XGPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires - Martin Luther</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-The-Kingdom-of-David-The-Saga-of-the-Israelites/dp/B00078XGQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires - The Kingdom of David - The Saga of the Israelites</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-Napoleon/dp/B000GG4Y5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires - Napoleon</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-Queen-Victoria-s-Empire/dp/B000EOTELI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires: Queen Victoria's Empire</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-Holy-Warriors-Richard-the-Lionheart-Saladin/dp/B000ADWCX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires - Holy Warriors: Richard the Lionheart & Saladin</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-Islam-Empire-of-Faith/dp/B00078XGP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires - Islam: Empire of Faith</a>; and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empires-Peter-Paul-and-the-Christian-Revolution/dp/B00078XGPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empires - Peter & Paul and the Christian Revolution</a>.",1300147200,23,2027,10.324022346368714
2390158,2,B000ANVQ6Y,"I had hoped for better from this collection.  The ""documentaries"" are little more than highly costumed re-enactments that shed little light on their purported subjects. These are typical drivel, in that they show the same re-enacted scene repeatedly with non-informative voice-over unrelated to the ridiculous scene.  There is no analysis, no real information beyond the most basic, lots of fighting and blood, lots of slo-mo and overacting, lots of camera ""techniques"", lots of costumes, lots of tense scoring. There's also lots of ridiculous dramatic set-up.  For example, the Medici story tries to build up tension regarding the radical design of the Florence cathedral dome.  Will it be built?  Will it work?  Is the architect mad?  Is Cosimo Medici going to survive politically?  It's ludicrous--we all know that the dome was built and that Cosimo survived (hence the Medici dynasty).  It would have been way more interesting and informative to look at the challenges of the dome's construction with some illustrative models or animations, to hear some real analysis of the political situation in Florence.  The ""talking head"" segments offer slightly more insight, but there's really not much to this collection.  If you like actual documentaries, this will not satisfy.",1220313600,50,1275,5.35678391959799
2390159,5,B000ANVQ6Y,"This PBS series was way ahead of it's time for documentaries and taking it to the next level.  I'm a big history buff and have enjoyed countless documentaries on these subjects, but the lavish productions, thorough scripts and thoughtful viewpoints are brought together in this great set.  If you or someone you know is a history buff, get this series!",1200096000,9,352,4.85

however the japan dvd was very disappointing.
What could have been told in 30 minutes went far too long.
The same theme was continually repeated,
However I would recommend this DVD for the other four stories as they were
very entertaining and informative.",1517356800,,313,5.1568627450980395
8078967,4,B000ANVQ6Y,"Four of these dvds are wonderful.  The Egyptians, the Japanese, the Greeks, and the Romans.  They go to their subject with with a spirit of openness and wonder.  They want to tell the stories of these cultures without bias.  Then we come to the Medici and the Italian Renaissance, and we get something completely different.  Gone is the balanced in telling of the stories.  Suddenly, the narrator, the cinematography, and the like are all sinister, as if the Medici are somehow to be subtly condemned while the others, as treacherous and violent as the Medici ever were, are given a pass.  I found that irritating.  It's filled with the kind of modernist self-hatred, a condemnation of western civilization, as if whatever we are must be wicked if it's not perfect.  Hubris much? The condemnation of the Middle Ages is palpable, just because it was the age of Christian faith.  Most contemporary scholars agree that the Middle Ages was nothing like that.  We modern people are the children of the Middle Ages, and not of the Greeks and the Romans.  Our love of technology and science began then.  Our beliefs in freedom and equality began then.  And yet we get the same tired ignorance of our own past.",1501977600,4,1202,4.743961352657005
