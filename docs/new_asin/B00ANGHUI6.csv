8554671,5,B00ANGHUI6,"Barney: Barney Loves You is now available on DVD from Lionsgate and Hit Entertainment. Barney is one of my daughters new favorite shows because she just saw it for the first time a few months ago and has been hooked ever since. She was so excited to get not one but three DVDs together!

I loved all three of these DVDs and their awesome messages! We Love Our Family, I Love My Friends and You Can Be Anything are all invaluable lessons. My daughter said her favorite was I Love My Friends. At three years old friends are becoming a really important part of her life. She has always been my social butterfly and loves to be around people. This DVD covers things like the importance of keeping promises to our friends, making up for the mistakes we inevitably make and why its important to be a great friend.

I personally liked We Love Our Family the most because of course my family is the most important thing in the world to me so I like anything that focuses on that. I want my children to see how other families work and how they are different from ours in some ways and the same in others.

You Can Be Anything is an amazing lesson to start teaching kids at a young age so what better presentation than Barney! My kids love to play dress up and dream about what they will be when they grow up. After watching this my son wanted to dress up in his Fireman costume and told me he wants to be one when he grows up! I love that this got him thinking about something so significant.

Barney: Barney Loves You is such a great value getting three discs together. The most important value though is the lessons Barney teaches with his fun friends.",1361318400,4,1645,4.313915857605178
