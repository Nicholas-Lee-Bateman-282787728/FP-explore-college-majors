7751917,5,B01FW3NFXI,"This documentary is on par with the greatest political documentary of all time, The War Room. Excellent, in depth. Great insight to the modern political process. It unfolds like a car wreck. It's hard to watch but you can't look away. A sad end to what otherwise could have been an impactful and fruitful political career.",1469664000,,322,4.767857142857143
7751918,4,B01FW3NFXI,"""Weiner"" (2016 release; 96 min.) is a documentary about disgraced New York politician Anthony Weiner (pronounced: ""wiener"", not ""whiner""). As the movie opens, we have Weiner in an interview chair, talking to the documentary makers. We then go back to 2011, when we get a thumbnail overview of how a sexting scandal led to his resignation from US Congress. We then shift to ""May 13, 2013, two years after his resignation"". Weiner is about to enter the race for New York Mayor, and along the way decided to give unlimited access to these documentary makers during his campaign. By then you are already nailed to your seat as you watch what is unfolding.

Couple of comments: this is the first full-length documentary for co-writer and directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg. While the comeback attempt in and of itself would've made for riveting viewing, can you imagine how they felt when smack in the middle of the unfolding campaign, another controversy explodes? It doesn't get any better than this for documentaries (on the same level as ""The Armstrong Lie"" about Lance Armstrong and ""I Am Trying To Break Your Heart"" about Wilco). There are so many fine moments in this documentary, and I certainly don't want to spoil your viewing experience, but allow me to just point out two scenes: there is a very clever montage of Weiner's campaign taking a foothold and gaining track (to the point of leading the polls), set to the ""Theme of S.W.A.T."", and it works beautifully. Even better is the scene between Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin when the second controversy explodes. Ah yes, the wife. Normal people like you and me immediately think: why on earth does she decide to stick by her man, time and again, humiliation upon humiliation? Then it dawns on me: these are not 'normal' people like you and me. Huma stays with Weiner the same reason Hillary stayed with Bill: it's all about the power! These career politicians know one thing, and one thing only: get the power, and stay in power, whatever means necessary, whatever personal sacrifice is needed along the way. When the final curtain comes down (Weiner obviously did not win the mayoral election), one of the directors asks Weiner ""why did you let me film all this?"". You'll just have to see for yourself how Weiner responds to this... Bottom line: if you like documentaries, you will absolutely love this riveting look at a disgraced politician whose narcissistic personality disorder is fully exposed here.

""Weiner"" made a splash when it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and I couldn't wait to see it. It finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati in early June. The Saturday matin&eacute;e screening where I saw this at was attended poorly, to my surprise. Maybe strong word-of-mouth (which this movie surely generates) will lead to wider exposure down the road through VOD and/or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. Meanwhile, ""Weiner"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

*UPDATE* Sept '14 I just heard on NPR the other day that Huma filed for divorce from Wiener. Good for her!",1468454400,9,3074,4.907692307692308

7751924,4,B01FW3NFXI,"Directors and producers Elyse Steinberg and Josh Kriegman take us on a ride with political firebrand Anthony Weiner, who crashed and burned in the New York Citys mayoral race of 2013.  Weiner was a long time U. S. Congressman who seemed to enjoy battling his Republican opponents on the floor of the House or anywhere else for that matter.  When a photo he took with his phone showing his bulging underwear became public, he was forced to resign.

Conciliatory and seemingly forthcoming of what he calls the event or situation, he decides to get in the race for mayor.  All with his wife, Huma Abedins blessing.  On top of the expected marital conflict, Abedin is also a close aide of Hillary Clinton who was contemplating a run for the presidency at the time.  With Weiners permission, the filmmakers ride along throughout the campaign supposedly as a fly on the wall.  They occasionally ask questions, which seems to annoy Weiner.  But a lot of things annoy Weiner.

Weiner was leading in the polls when additional photos and conversations leaked in the middle of the campaign.  We get a first-hand look at the implosion.  We get an unusual look at Weiners ego driven campaign.  One based on his New York toughness.  New Yorkers don't quit he continually states.  Some like it but he was doomed.  Still he stuck it out finishing with a paltry 5% of the vote.  It seemingly didn't matter that we were watching his marriage appear to disintegrate at the same time.

The documentary has plenty of humor, some unintended and shows the subject, warts and all.  A promising politician, his callowness regarding his phone usage would seem to be his continual downfall.  Recommended.",1483574400,2,1677,4.821052631578947
7751925,5,B01FW3NFXI,"Great film that shows the inside of a doomed campaign. Weiner actually comes off as a likeable person despite him clearly self-sabotaging the campaign and his political career.

This movie delves deep into his personal life and makes you feel pity for his wife and child.

7751934,4,B01FW3NFXI,"The 2016 documentary WEINER follows politician Anthony Weiner's 2013 run for Mayor of New York City.  It is two years after private photos of himself he sent via an online social networking service made the news, derailing his career as a United States Congressman, though I can't be the only person asking why an incident that does not affect an elected official's service to the public should matter.  Come to think of it, why would knowledge of a date with a prostitute cost a New York governor his political career but get a U.S. Senator representing Louisiana a round of applause from his colleagues and re-elected by his constituents?

This film itself moves along nicely and shows us what makes Anthony Weiner the kind of candidate for whom you'd vote.  You have to admire the man for putting himself back out there, knowing America's junk news media would cover his personal life more than the issues.  But the people understand, WEINER reminds us, something a vocal woman from the Bronx articulates as she expresses her support for his run for mayor.  Huma Abedin, Weiner's wife, appears reluctant to put up with all of it again and while you feel for the woman, the fact that she would go on to be vice chairwoman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for President proves a hint as to why she soldiers on.  Power is hard to resist.

And, speaking of the hard to resist, it has not been documented that Anthony Weiner actually met any woman with whom he exchanged messages and photos on-line.  We've all known those all-talk, no-action types, haven't we?

WEINER shows a man who is breaking no laws and not having sex with anyone other than his wife.  But in the surveillance state of America, getting caught flirting with such an idea subjects you to consequences?

He was a rising star who definitely had it all- charisma, a beautiful family, and devoted supporters, and then he makes horrid decisions and makes a complete mess of his personal AND his political life.  Truly an amazing documentary unlike any I have seen before. It is very well filmed and takes you right into the thick of things as Weiner goes from political star to hated pervert.  This is Anthony Weiner, up close and personal, from the beginning of his rise (no pun intended) to his crushing descent.

7751946,5,B01FW3NFXI,"Weiner refers to Anthony Wiener, a young New York Congressman destined to be a star of the Democratic Party until a 2011 sexting scandal forced his humiliating resignation. Two years later, he ran for mayor of New York City, hoping his ideas would overshadow his past lack of judgment. Weiner is a captivating look inside his attempt at a political comeback, which derailed when new sexting allegations were made public. Granted total access to the candidate and his campaign, directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Sternberg follow Weiner from his surge to the top of the polls to his desperate attempt to forge ahead despite the medias incessant coverage of the new, damaging news.

The documentary plays almost like a Greek tragedy, with Weiner destroyed by his own flaw. Though it is an accurate account of Weiners downfall, it sometimes feels like a mockumentary by Christopher Guest with Weiner a nearly farcical character initially denying sexting, then confessing, resigning, apologizing to his constituents and taking therapy to repair his marriage to Huma Abedin, a Hillary Clinton aide. Weiners personal tragedy unfolds as the cameras unflinchingly record his embarrassment and despair, even as he tries to keep an optimistic point of view.

Weiner is not your typical talking heads documentary. The film has a driving energy and a palpable sense of suspense as we wonder how  or if  Weiner can extricate himself from a political quagmire of his own making. There are no bonus features on the DVD release.",1471824000,2,1511,5.105263157894737
7751947,4,B01FW3NFXI,"There are a lot of connections between this fly on the wall documentary on Anthony Weiner who served as New York State Congressman for 3 terms before he was caught sexting. He then decided to run for Mayor of New York City and permitted the filmmakers to follow along for the ride. But he tripped up again and was caught sexting again (!). No matter what he said, it came back to haunt him. Just as similar misspoken comments are coming from Donald Trump (another New Yorker) in his campaign for President of the US.

The title of the 96-minute film is Weiner and you might think at first it is about Anthony Weiner but its just as much about his wife (married in 2010)  Huma Abedin  who was(and still is) a chief advisor to Hilary Clinton.  Im not sure that SHE knew what would happen after her husband gave permission to film, but you find yourself looking at her expressions and hearing her comments even more than listening to Weiner. There is a lot of graphic language and he becomes unhinged many times but the camera never sways.

Watching this film is not unlike picking up a copy of the National Inquirer or other scandal paper that youve found left on a bench. Often you say to yourself: Is this guy really that stupid to think he can win?

It was fun to watch but not essential viewing. There are no bonus features on the DVD iother than the theatrical trailer.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7751948,5,B01FW3NFXI,"Throughout Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg's insightful, entertaining documentary Weiner you'll be asking one question: Why would Anthony Weiner subject himself to this level of scrutiny? Well, you're not alone; he wonders the same thing right in the film's opening moments. By the end of the film the audience has come to some kind of answer to that riddle, but the answers are obvious if you've been paying attention to the clown car that is our current political climate. Weiner is the perfect film for this campaign season, and maybe the best political horror ever. Have there been others?

Liberals loved Anthony Weiner. He was a vocal, fiery, compassionate member of Congress who never met a camera he didn't want to mug in front of. But for all of his showboating, he was a powerful voice for those who didn't have a voice in this country. Then the sexting scandal hit, he was humiliated (his last name didn't help) enough that he dropped out of office, and that was supposed to be it. The film takes place during his attempted comeback during the 2013 race for New York City mayor. That's what this was supposed to be; Weiner's comeback story. But then more pics of Weiners weiner hit Twitter right in the middle of the campaign, and let's just say his chances of winning were pretty limp thereafter.

Weiner is a fascinating look at one man's absolute addiction to the media spotlight, and how that addiction led to his downfall. But it's also about how our media loves to kick someone when they're down. They could care less about what the man stood for, unless it's in the context of destroying him.  What's interesting about Weiner is that he seems to recognize this, and yet still plays into their hands. He talks constantly about getting ""out of a defensive crouch' and fighting back against the negative headlines, the biased reporting, and jokes at his expense. But nobody cares if he fights back. In one telling scene, Weiner unleashes double barrels on MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell, who asks the ridiculous question, ""What's wrong with you, Anthony?"" The result? Weiner looked like a madman, never mind that O'Donnell was deliberately being a prick.

Did that stop Weiner from leaping headlong into more lopsided coverage from obvious media enemies? Of course not. He can't help himself, much to the chagrin of poised and clearly embarrassed wife, Huma Abedin. The Hillary Clinton confidante stands by her husband publicly, but privately she's in Hell, or as she puts it one morning, ""it's like living a nightmare"".  While Weiner always comes off as a bit shady, and definitely like a glory hound, you can't help but feel for Huma as she's paraded in front of cameras to stand by her husband time and time again, looking like a deer in headlights.  The worst comes when Weiner's opportunistic sexting partner Sidney Leathers comes trolling around their campaign headquarters, with Huma trapped inside so as to avoid a public confrontation. It's all political theater, in a way, but on a personal level it must be humiliating.

Weiner's situation only looks more ridiculous when compared to the ascendancy of Donald Trump. Weiner's ""crime"" was sending lewd photos to consenting adults. If he had just admitted to it right away perhaps he could have ridden the storm out. But Trump, a misogynistic pig who has berated and degraded women publicly for years, now stands a decent chance of becoming President of the United States. The media eats it up. So why does he get a pass when Weiner didn't? Easy; there's nothing to be learned from exposing Trump. His depths are public knowledge. But there's great copy in destroying an otherwise decent man over something so private, especially when he gives you all of the ammunition with which to do it.",1470182400,13,3764,4.862714508580344

8761614,5,B01FW3NFXI,"Wow this far surpassed my expectations. The documentary cameras were in his face through good times and bad. Huma is only shown as a composed, if deflating, champion for him. The cameras probably gave them some space during what I'm sure had to be some tearful moments, but she maintained dignity throughout this documentary. More interesting though is Anthony's resilience and fervor to defend his cause in light of his own stupid mistakes. He insists he's done little wrong and actually became a sympathetic character, somewhat. Especially when he starts to crack under the scrutiny. But then in the next scene he'll be smiling while reviewing a disastrous interview which is upsetting to Huma. And then he'll speak openly to the camera operator about the effects of his actions that Huma has had to endure. ""Everything great that makes her, *her,* well I'm the opposite of her greatness."" (Paraphrased.) The cameraman asks, ""Is that why she loves you?"" Weiner: ""No, I think she loved me in spite of me.""

Somehow, they managed to end this on a high note, though it ended before the underage allegations came forward. Still it was a humanizing treatment of a man and family who could have had so much more but Anthony threw his own career away on a carnal whim.

The fact that later on Huma's involvement with him was a factor in the 2016 election (when her laptop was seized shortly before the election and so much fuss was about Hillary's emails) just breaks my heart. She's been embarrassed so many times by Weiner's scandals. Shakespeare would have loved this kind of modern-day tragedy.",1503705600,,1593,4.852941176470588
