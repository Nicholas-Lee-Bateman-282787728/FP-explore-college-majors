6355336,5,B00JDV4OYU,"I first saw this movie approximately 15 years ago on Turner Classic Movies.  I absolutely loved it!  It's the typical Cinderella story, if you will, but it's delightfully cast and charmingly told.  It was nominated for an Oscar for Writing (Original Story).

Directed by William Wyler, Frances Dee stars as a young girl who unexpectedly wins a $5000 lottery, an extraordinary amount of money in 1935.  Tired of her expected and ordinary life in a dull job and even duller town, she decides to flee to New York for a month of living a dream.  She stays at an exclusive hotel, buys a new wardrobe, and tries to assimilate into high society.  Meanwhile, Francis Lederer stars as a mischievous foreign prince hiding out as a bell-boy in the hotel.  He's constantly getting fired as a result of his high jinx, but always manages to land on his feet and get his job back, thanks to his optimistic attitude and some interceding by an official of his country.

It's a fun, entertaining, lovely movie that I thoroughly enjoyed those many years ago.  I had been searching for the movie via every avenue I could think of.  I even wrote to TCM (never heard a word back from anyone).  As I couldn't remember the exact title of the movie (by the way, it's also known as ""April Folly"") or the exact names of the cast members, I was never successful in locating the movie for purchase or rent.  I had thought of the movie many, many times over the years, hoping to run across it somehow.  The other day I was perusing TCM's website and  miraculously found the movie.  After searching on Amazon, I decided to buy it here since it was the same price as on TCM and with my Prime membership I received the movie in 2 days and got free shipping.  Thanks, Amazon Prime!  I should also mention I always order via smile.amazon so I can contribute to my favorite charity - the Wounded Warrior Project.  Thanks, Amazon!

Anyway, if you enjoy those happy, lovely, funny, and charming movies of the 1930s (my favorite era of movies!), you will enjoy this one.  If you just want to see a sweet adaptation of boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl, you will enjoy this movie.  If  you just appreciate a romantic-comedy from any era, you will like this movie!  I highly recommend it and I'm so glad I found it again after all these years.",1406419200,5,2314,4.574209245742092
6355337,5,B00JDV4OYU,"This is a gem of a little movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the classic romantic comedies. Unfortunately, it's never been released on DVD or VHS before. I once read something about how there were problems archiving the movie, so that's why it faded into relative obscurity. But who knows. What I do know is that if you like old, feel good romantic comedies, you'll love this film. You should buy it... even though it's, sadly, unavailable. I'm not sure who owns the rights to the film, but they should release it! :(",1342224000,7,536,4.536082474226804
8650059,5,B00JDV4OYU,"A screwball Cinderella tale that succeeds as charming, escapist entertainment. The script is nothing special but William Wyler keeps the action moving along. It's a small movie that slowly opens up to a surprisingly grand scale. The two leads grew on me.  Francis Lederer is an unusual leading man, a little bit unctuous in his continental charm but he also has a kind of Robin Hood charisma that is disarming and a bit anarchic. Frances Dee feels a bit slight as a leading lady but Wyler brings us into her emotional state with some very touching solitary moments.",1529798400,,565,4.76530612244898

8650061,5,B00JDV4OYU,"Young William Wyler made this very short but nonroutine romcom immediately after the wonderful rags-to-riches GOOD FAIRY with Margaret Sullavan and Herbert Marshall. That was a sweetly fey Buda-Pesth comedy, with a Ferenc Molnar stage pedigree; here, with Jesse Lasky producing at Fox, Wyler takes the same romantic Cinderella-story tropes to Manhattan's Hotel ""Walsdorf"" and a terrific original screenplay by Stephen Avery and Don Hartman (Samson Raphaelson also contributed, so there are deliciously suggestive Lubitsch/Wilder elements here too). Frances meets Francis and very cutely indeed: Ms. Dee, a typist drone, has won $5000 as a casaba queen (don't ask; it's a Depression Era promo thing) and is determined to live larger, just once, by blowing the winnings on a luxe Walsdorf spree. Mr. Lederer is Ruritanian Prince Sandro, incognito in tight breeches as the hotel's impertinent Bellboy 14 (he's also an undercover promo guy, nobly pushing Ruritanian tourism).

It's the slightest of silly and overfamiliar premises--this is not progressive screwball--but played very lightly (remember, this is early non-epic Wyler), and the principals and supporting cast are completely in key and on form. Dee and Lederer are both believable, very funny and very beautiful, and Wyler coaxes naturalistic performances from these neglected but not forgotten stars, discreetly backed with nonintrusive turns by Benita Hume, Alan Mowbray, Lennox Pawle, Akim Tamiroff and Lionel Stander. This romance is benignly ordained, the casaba queen must become the bellhop prince's consort, and it can all be accomplished with 76 minutes, Mirabel's $5000 and no Wyleresque grandiosity. Still the film has a chic Moderne look, since Wyler uses the Walsdorf foyer, corridor and ballroom sets as though they were grandish Samuel Goldwyn interiors from the more ambitious DODSWORTH or COME AND GET IT.

Frances Dee carries her Jean Arthuresque role with real personality, convincing navet and melon-royalty pluck, and charmingly she was also carrying Jody McCrea (later Roger Corman's beach-movie bozo) during the filming. The project was provisionally called APRIL FOLLY, and this was Dee's best leading-role film, in a truncated filmography, before Jacques Tourneur's astonishingly beautiful I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE. The top-billed matinee idol/Praha boulevardier Lederer (a Slavic Chevalier, with a more seductive accent) is splendidly nonchalant in his bellboy drag, and he like Dee went on to later cult keepers (RETURN OF DRACULA, MARACAIBO) after his important work with Pabst, Leisen and Renoir (PANDORA'S BOX, MIDNIGHT, DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID). Dee's melon-queen Mirabel yearns to live large--the best revenge--and gets her wish, and it's worth noting that Mr. Lederer lived to the large, melon-ripe age of 100, Miss Dee nearly as long and fruitfully. GAY DECEPTION is a unique highlight in the resums of Lederer and Dee, and viewers may think more fondly of the overhyped Wyler after watching this little operetta arabesque. Lederer was supposed to croon a song (with Preston Sturges lyrics), but Lasky and Wyler contained the film at its ideal short runtime, tactfully not tempted to gild the lily or grease the casaba.",1481932800,,3208,5.491902834008097
8650062,4,B00JDV4OYU,"Light, happy romantic comedy of the old school. Lederer is great, he should have done more of them.",1472342400,,99,4.555555555555555
8650063,5,B00JDV4OYU,"This movie shows William Wyler's gift for comedy and his practicality as a problem solver. Frances Dee was married to Joel McCrea and expecting a child, so Wyler shot more closeups of her face than usual. The result is a certain intimacy that adds to the movie's charm. As for the performances, Francis Lederer is so irrepressible and charming, and Frances Dee is so lovely and appealing, that I don't see how you can watch the two of them together without rooting for them. The last scene is pure Wyler, telling a whole story in one gesture.",1466812800,3,542,4.597938144329897
