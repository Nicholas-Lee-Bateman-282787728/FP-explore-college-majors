8307666,5,B001H1K1VO,"Don't let the ""British"" format stop you from this flick. Get ""dvd decrypter"" it's a TOTALLY FREE program on the net for download and YES it works, I was successful. I also have Nero which you will need (or equivalent) to burn to DVD after you decrypt the ""original"" DVD. Without ""parroting"" what has already been said, you can't miss on this one. I don't recall a rating but a PG-13 would be the highest.

If you buy it on amazon uk the cost for the flick is VERY cheap. I am not sure about shipping but you can stay under $20.00.",1261872000,3,530,4.196078431372549
8307667,5,B001H1K1VO,"OMG, this movie cracks me up.  Please, please, please release it on Region 1 DVD so us Americans can enjoy the zaniness of Damian Lewis as (Milo) a wayard hitman looking for a change of pace who ends up hiding out in this great little Welsh village.  The villagers are amazingly real and I particularly enjoyed the two guys competing over ""yard of the year"" complete with gnome whacking and tulip termination - it is freaking wonderful fun.

Poor Damian never turns out to be much of a baker, but he does find love in this farcical tale - like a version of The Quiet Man on LSD, complete with exploding, flying sheep's heads and sword fighting.  The comedic breaks are fun without being dumb and if this is the Lewis brothers at play.....what a true adventure growing up in their house must have been.

Again - please release a Region 1 version for us poor Americans starved for adult humor.  All we get are SNL skit remakes, frat boy films and fart jokes.  Take pity on us and release The Baker in the US.  It's a real fun romp. Reminds me of Bringing Up Baby, which I've seen 100's of times and can watch over and over and still enjoy",1248566400,,1136,4.350710900473934
