7562732,3,B01948X1PY,"Items came as 4 loose blu-rays taped together.  Films are great, but what I got was a boxless boxed set.  Caveat Emptor.",1458432000,6,120,4.409090909090909

8743892,5,B01948X1PY,I always wanted to upgrade these wonderful movies from DVD to Blu-ray.,1534204800,,70,4.916666666666667
8743893,3,B01948X1PY,"No box. Just 4 Blue Ray movies. PX was good, but not as good as it could be. Lots of noise in the background. Sound was only 2 channel, meaning you can only get sound out of the front speakers of a Home Entertainment Center. If you get sound out of the TV, you won't care. If you already have these movies in DVD format and play them on a blue ray player that will upscale the px, don't bother buying these. If you have never seen them, it is a definite buy.
Agatha Christie stories are pretty much the same....you will never guess who done it until the end. Then the main character (Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot) will reveal all and it becomes so easy. Why didn't you think of that! Three of these movies are Hercule Poirot, one is Miss Marple.  I have played the DVD versions on my backyard theater and my friends loved them.
I love these movies, but was disappointed after waiting for years for Blue Ray version.....No problem playing on US player.",1513987200,4,952,4.318435754189944

8743896,3,B01948X1PY,"I also received a boxless box set, just 4 discs strapped together BUT what stunner three out of the four are. Color and details explode on the screen with this transfer.  DEATH ON THE NILE,  THE MIRROR CRACK D, and  EVIL UNDER THE SUN now have a range of depth they never had before. Now planning an Agatha Christie movie and dinner party for Friday nights.",1507939200,2,357,4.378787878787879
8743897,4,B01948X1PY,"Like some other customers commented, I did not get a boxed set as seen in the advertisement pic.

Murder On The Midnight Express image is a poor quality transfer for Blu-ray. Disappointing

Otherwise really enjoying this collection, especially Evil Under The Sun.",1497744000,2,263,5.238095238095238

8743899,5,B01948X1PY,"These four films dating from 1974 (Orient Express) to the mid 80's, have for many years enjoyed something of a cult status. The Orient Express and Nile (1978) films were the first to be issued and are of a quality of casting and setting that makes their status very difficult to match let alone replace. The following two films may not be of quite that exalted level but are more than acceptable when presented in a box such as this and at an attractive bulk price.

However, this review is not intended to discuss the actual films as by now they will have both their supporters and detractors. Entering into those conflicts is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of these films which are now entering historical status.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of these films, and especially the initial two, the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray option offers an improvement technically sufficient to justify the additional expense of DVD replacement.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The upgrades offers a clear advance on both image and audio quality with the imaging being a marked improvement. The colours are firmer and there is an increase to the perceived depth of the imaging. The films simply become more 'real.' The films, which are so concerned with close characterisation, benefit considerably from this enhancement of reality.

The degree of improvement experienced from these BDs will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual signals before they leave to both the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio, not so critical in the case, delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance as one would expect from a musician. Its precision is equally revealing of film scores.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

These discs offers purchasers with suitable replay equipment a substantial improvement over the previous DVDs

In summary these BDs offer good transfers from good quality film stock and have responded well to the upgrades and are well worth considering.",1474070400,12,2672,5.110091743119266
8743900,5,B01948X1PY,"These are four of my favorite mysteries on film, all done by the same production team and starring wonderful actors.  I have owned many different versions of all 4, and am so happy to now have these Blu-rays, which bring back what they originally looked like.  Enjoy!",1467504000,,267,4.659574468085107
