7067227,1,B00UQW1GFU,"I was living in the building where the final scenes of this movie were filmed.  That's about the only reason we watched more than the first ten minutes.  This was one of the worst versions of an over-played theme I've ever seen.  The characters flat, the dialogue uninteresting, the directing terrible.  Brodie gives a great performance as usual, but his character is such the whiny little weasel, it's not enough to carry the movie.  And the accents are all wrong.  People in New Orleans don't talk like that.  There is a great accent to the people of this city, and ya'll didn't even come close.

I remember coming home from work, the trauma center where real people had been shot with real bullets and victims as well as perpetrators of real crime lingered in ICU beds, and sidestepping lighting equipment and cables, and that ridiculous rain gear on my way home to my apartment.  I remember hoping that this movie would not be just another idiotic glorification of the ""thug life"".  Well, I was wrong in that this movie did it even more horribly than I could have imagined, in a senseless, artless, tasteless way.  I'm sorry I paid even a couple bucks to help reimburse the cost of production.  Brodie, you disappoint me.  Christensen, you were never that good to begin with.",1440460800,5,1279,4.681614349775785

7067229,3,B00UQW1GFU,"It was always me and you against the world. Frankie (Brody) has just gotten out of jail. While in there his former crime partner, and brother, James (Christensen) has gotten his life straightened out. With no money or home Frankie convinces James to help him pull off one last heist in order to help them both. This is not a bad movie at all and I did enjoy it. I was entertained and was not bored at all. On the other hand the movie is pretty generic and if it wasn't for the acting by Brody it may have been much worse than it was. I do like heist movies a lot but in order to set itself apart the movies must have some other element to them. This one used overused elements and did nothing to make them different. Again though, this isn't a bad movie and it worth seeing. Overall, a decent heist movie that is a good watch, but a little too generic to be all that special. I give this a B-.",1438387200,2,893,4.079545454545454

7067231,1,B00UQW1GFU,"Overacted and underwritten this generic and emotionally flat drama/heist movie winds up being as dull as it's title (American this that and the other ran it's course after American Pie).

Two dumb brothers poorly portrayed by Adrien Brody and Hayden Christensen meet some bad boy rappers who wanted to be in a movie containing scenes like an extended music video.  Brody is especially terrible here so overplaying his role he must have thought he was in a gangster satire.  Christensen is his normal, dull uninspired self but this time with an accent (when he remembers it).

What else can you expect?  A few ridiculously banal rap songs that would appeal to 12 year old boys and direction that sometimes attempts to be stylish but simply doesn't work.

Poorly paced and not worth your time... This is anything but clever and not even moderately entertaining.",1436486400,9,859,4.930555555555555

7067236,1,B00UQW1GFU,"I've watched several good Adrien Brody movies like ""The Pianist"", but was very disappointed with ""American Heist"".
After ca. 62 minutes of a very slow build up the heist finally starts, but nothing new happens that we haven't already seen in many similar bank robbing movies before.
It's amazing that garbage like this finds enough producers/companies who finance cheap flicks.
90% less foul language (the f word is used ad nauseum) sure would have contributed to a better movie.

Don't waste your time. Rather watch ""The Next Three Days"" (Russel Crowe) or ""Tell No One"" (Franois Cluzet), if you want to watch something suspenseful that's worthwhile.",1509753600,,650,5.132075471698113

7067239,3,B00UQW1GFU,"Watchable, but nothing special.  No likeable characters in the movie, even the younger brother who does some pretty reprehensible stuff at the end. Characters make some dumb decisions.  From meeting your brother's former inmates and when they ask to go for a drive not figuring out you might want to say, hey if we're committing a crime, this car I've been working on for months, I don't want to lose it, let's steal something else.  Plus what does ditching the car have to do with anything, wouldn't the thing be registered under his name if someone had seen the number plate?  The police at the end do some stupid things that you'd think they'd be trained not to, especially a helicopter pilot.  The love interest for the younger brother, the older brother had told his mates all about her, yet the younger brother didn't even know she'd returned to New Orleans before she turns up at the customer counter to get her car looked at where he's working?  Do civilians who work in police stations in New Orleans really wear dark blue shirts with badge icons on them on the chest? Do they have a big screen TV on the wall distracting them from their important job?  I doubt it.  Let alone every significant call to the center was picked up by one character.

It has its faults but it is watchable if you've got an hour and a half to kill.  Not something you'd bother with a second time.",1500681600,,1383,4.496

7067242,3,B00UQW1GFU,"In truth, it is not the worst film in the world but it isn't ground breaking by any means. If you came here to watch powerful dramatic performances or a brilliant piece of cinema then you will be disappointed. That being said, Adrien Brody has a couple of scene stealing scenes or two during the film and Hayden Christiansen (?) does an okay job as well with the material he's given. The story is not particularly inspiring - 2 brothers dragged into a bank heist but the production value is good and some of the action sequences are fair, particularly, the last one. There is a nice romantic interest involved as well for those who like their romance. However, most of the characters feel out of place and lack depth. Or at least, not enough depth to have us care for them except for Frankie and James. I would recommend this movie if you want to watch eat some pop corn, drink a beer and not have high expectations.",1491264000,,916,4.42603550295858

7067253,5,B00UQW1GFU,"I saw this movie although it received a lot of bad reviews. I went in open minded and it turned out to be a really good film. The caliber of ""Heat"" would be impossible for almost any movie. I think if people didn't already go in disliking any of the actors and just watched it for what it was, maybe not so many bad reviews. At least it was different. Ordinary people caught up in bad decisions. No flash, just a simple story. Everything does not have to be over the top and Hayden Christensen keeps getting hits about his acting. Please leave the Star Wars movies in the Sci Fi realm. And even for all the bad dialog (which is not an actor's fault-nor is it on the actor when he/she brings up an alternative approach and gets shut down by the director), Return of the Sith is one of the best in that franchise. Anyway, I would recommend this movie, everyone did a great job. At least see it for yourself and do not be swayed by all the negative reviews. You may like it and you may not, but at least you made up your own mind.",1468454400,,1027,4.14

7067257,3,B00UQW1GFU,"It isn't fair and it isn't right, but in the minds of many moviegoers, certain performers will always be associated with their most memorable roles. For me, Hayden Christensen will always be Anakin Skywalker, and it's strange to see him in anything but a Science Fiction film, but that doesn't mean he's not capable of playing anything else, as he shows in American Heist. Christensen plays James Kelly, an man who became an ex-con, for simply looking up to and trying to help his older brother, Frankie (Adrien Brody). As James is getting his life on track, Frankie is being released from prison and is of course looking for one big score. Now, James has to decide what's more important, keeping his new life on track or saving his older brother. Hayden Christensen gives an admirable performance, once you get passed the initial shock of Anakin cursing and covered in tattoos, but it's Adrien Brody who steals the show. Brody isn't an Academy Award winner for nothing, as his character pulls at the heart strings and has you running the gambit of emotions. Everyone knows someone like Frankie and wonders which way they'll turn out. In this case, there is also the added incentive of finding out if he'll drag his brother along with him, either way. American Heist isn't the best film out there, the story has been done, and at times, it's a little dull. This film is more about the characters and their values more than anything else. There's a fair share of language and guns, but unlike many other thrillers, that's not really the focus here, which in the end, is appreciated.",1457481600,,1581,4.731884057971015
7067258,3,B00UQW1GFU,"I didn't think this movie was as bad as some of the reviews make it sound. Brody and Christensen both play interesting characters. While the storyline is a little lax, I found the portrayal of two less educated white men who grew up in poverty in a mixed race New Orleans to be fairly accurate. Brody wasn't ""overacting"", his character, Frankie, was melodramatic. He had a moment of brilliance at the end.",1454716800,,405,4.638888888888889

7067262,3,B00UQW1GFU,"I am going to go okay with this one. Nothing really different about this ""heist"" movie than any other, it is all right but nothing spectacular. What was is more proof that Hayden Christensen can really act, I have been saying it forever and he can. That whole Star Wars thing was a fluke. Watch him in anything else and he is wonderful. The plot? His brother, Adrien Brody, gets out of jail and brings his baby brother into the thick of a heist. He tricked him into it (nice brother) The gang is typical, no type of different character. Things go south real quick, most of these crooks are pretty inept. Except for Christian, you pretty much hate the rest even his brother for being a moron. Do I recommend? Hard to say. I say it is okay for a view if you get it cheap.",1447977600,2,769,4.238095238095238

7067266,1,B00UQW1GFU,"With actors like Adrien Brody (The Pianist), Hayden Christensen (Star Wars) and Jordana Brewster (Fast & Furious) you might think you're in for a good movie, but American Heist suffers from a bad script and even worse direction.

This is a B action movie, short on action and long on story. The first hour of the movie is about the difficult, codependent relationship between two brothers (Frankie and James) and the rekindling of a long lost love (James and Emily). The title of the movie should have been called 'Trapped' or 'Payback' because the 'Heist' is really Frankie's way of paying off his debt to the gangsters that kept him safe in prison and James' way of paying off the debt he feels he owes his brother.

The script takes too long setting up the back story and becomes boring and frustrating. By the time the Heist (Bank Robbery) actually occurs your so disinterested in the movie that you're hoping everyone just gets killed off already and this thing is over.

The bank robbery is so ill planed that is doomed to fail and of course the robbers don''t have an escape plan and just take to the streets shooting rounds and rounds of ammunition at the cops and anything else in their sight. The street shooting scene is filmed like a first person shooter video game and it''s so unbelievable it''s annoying. Meanwhile back at the bank, Frankie and his brother James lament about their lives hiding in some office while they think of a way out and do the hostages get up and run out of the bank while no one is watching them ... no they just lie on the floor and wait, and wait and wait (yeah right).

There are so many ways they could have ended this movie which would have left you with some feeling of redemption for watching it but the way it ends is so implausible that it leaves you dumbfounded.

The only thing stolen in this Heist is the money you paid to watch it!",1444003200,,1884,4.465116279069767
