At the time of this writing this listing for ""The Duke"" is a pre-order for $7.99. You can get the same film (originally released as a Disney Channel Original Movie in 1999) for $4.99 on DVD which has been out on Amazon for years:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duke/dp/B000089772/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duke</a>

Don't be fooled by the sparkly new cover that is unrelated to this fourteen-year-old movie. The Duke does NOT have an Australian Shepherd puppy in it, as shown on this cover art. (No Yorkshire Terriers or Chihuahuas either.) The dog star in The Duke is really a Black and Tan Coonhound, along with a co-starring Bassett Hound and Standard Poodle.

It's a cute film that younger kids and dog-loving older kids who don't take themselves too seriously will enjoy. So nothing against the movie itself. Just make sure you know what you're getting before hitting that But It Now button!",1366502400,,1024,5.3875

822515,5,6304277415,"This is a rare opportunity to see John Wayne in a setting he wanted all his life - aboard ship at sea.  Movies and stills taken of him, his friends and family are put togethar in an honest, fact filled presentation.

As far as I know, there was  only one mis-spoken and unrepresented part of his life.  This was when director Raoul Walsh offered Wayne the starring role in ""The Long Trail"" whhich led to seven years of John Ford having nothing at all to do with Wayne.

I definitely recommend this to all John Wayne fans.",1363824000,,521,4.329896907216495
822516,5,6304277415,"This is an awesome movie for families looking for good clean laughs.
The plot is hilarious, the romance is sweet, and the Dukedom goes to the dogs in this hilarious movie.
My family and I all enjoy watching this movie and we all give it a thumbs up!",1317600000,4,249,4.208333333333333
822517,5,6304277415,"The Duke is a very cute movie that features a live bloodhound and basset hound.  Children (and adults) who are dog lovers will enjoy this movie. The story is a little predictable with a happy ending, but that's the way it should be with a movie so adorable!  I highly recommend giving The Duke a turn in your DVD player.",1202428800,,320,4.316666666666666
822518,3,6304277415,"Meet Hubert, a lovable dog in the tradition of all lovable dogs.  Hubert has a reasonably good life.  He lives with his master, the Duke of Dingwall (John Neville, ""Urban Legend"" and ""The Fifth Element""), and is generally cared for by Clive Chives (James Doohan in his next to last movie) and his niece Charlotte Chives (Courtnee Draper).  Everyone is generally happy until the Duke passes away.

The trouble begins during the reading of the Duke's will.  The Duke's sleazy nephew believes he will be the heir of Dingwall, which includes a fortune in jewels, art and various antiques.  The Duke of Dingwall has left a surprise for everyone; the Duke left his estate to Hubert and specified that Charlotte should be Hubert's guardian.

The Duke's nephew is furious and does his best to take control of Dingwall.  With his wife's help, he reminds everyone that a ball must be held.  He hopes that the ball will be a disaster and that the Queen of England will refuse to recognize the Duke as the inheritor of the title.  Next, he tries to get the Duke to marry a poodle, hoping to control the estate through his ownership of the poodle.  A viewer will have to see how this movie ends!

Much of this movie is derivative, and apparently so derivative that the movie went direct to video.  Though the movie was low budget with only modest originality, I enjoyed it.  This movie is a light comedy and much of the comedy works.  There are several places where I laughed out loud.

There are places where this movie is corny, and at least a couple of places where the movie is so corny that it is almost unwatchable.  The formal ball is unbelievable, but there was enough humor in the ball and it was in the spirit of the theme so I got through that part.  However, the marriage between the two dogs was too incredible and there was not enough humor to hold my interest.  If the marriage scene had been replaced with some other scene I would have rated this movie four stars.

I think that if you enjoy funny dog movies you will find this movie worthy of watching at least once.  Even better, all members of the family can watch this movie.  Just be ready to explain that dogs can not be married in real life.",1169856000,2,2201,4.4636591478696745
