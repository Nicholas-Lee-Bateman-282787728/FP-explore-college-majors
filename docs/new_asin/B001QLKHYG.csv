3765622,3,B001QLKHYG,"This is a good small town movie, most of which was shot in Edenton, NC.  The main reason I like it is because I live in Edenton.  It's also a good mystery.",1244160000,,155,3.8125

3765624,5,B001QLKHYG,"Finally a great Christian Thriller!  And very much a Twilight Zone type of movie. Will Patton does a great job as Eli Cottonmouth. Found this great review and wanted to share:

Movieguide has called the film, ""One of the best cutting edge movies to probe the human condition.""  Ted Baehr praises it as ""reminiscent of Ray Bradbury.""

3765625,5,B001QLKHYG,"I was blessed with the opportunity to see this gem of a movie in the theater when it first came out.  ""Wow,"" what a great film!  The direction is top notch and the acting is superb.  Will Patton shows us why he is one if the best character actors working today.  Don't take my word for it - check it out for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.",1233360000,,345,4.08955223880597
3765626,5,B001QLKHYG,This was a very engaging movie with a great cast. I am looking forward to seeing it again and owning my own copy. I loved the small town setting as well as the intricate plot. It was well written and brilliantly directed - very much worth owning.,1233360000,,246,4.25531914893617
3765627,5,B001QLKHYG,"This movie is extremely moving!  You will experience highs and lows in emotion.  Finally a movie with values, real purpose and a strong moral of the story!  Loved it!  This is a perfect gift idea!",1233273600,,196,4.514285714285714
3765628,5,B001QLKHYG,I got to see this film a couple of times already and I have been looking forward to owning it!!! It is definitely a MUST SEE!!! Powerful film with a great Director (Mark Freiberger) and cast!!,1233273600,,192,4.361111111111111
3765629,5,B001QLKHYG,"I was fortunate to be able to attend the premier...what a wonderful film!  Filled with mystery and emotion, this is a must-see for all ages.  Will Patton really nailed the role of ""Eli Cottonmouth""....I believe it was his best performance ever!  The two small boys as his ""sidekicks"" were great, really touching my heart.  Richard Herd (from the Seinfeld series)as the town's mayor was a perfect pick.  The ending was a complete surprise and very emotional...many tears in the theater!",1233273600,,485,5.0125
3765630,5,B001QLKHYG,"Truly a wonderful coming of age drama/mystery with a bit of a Southern Gothic quality to it.  The cast is outstanding and Will Patton as the mysterious drifter ""Eli Cottonmouth"" has one of the most unique and memorable roles of his career in this Film.  It wasn't rated when I saw it in theaters, but I'm guessing it will be rated at about a PG.",1233273600,2,345,4.292307692307692

8335994,5,B001QLKHYG,"The video was delivered quickly and in very nice condition. The movie itself had some weird elements to it. The title misleads you into thinking it's a pleasant summer movie, but there is more to it than that.",1362960000,,209,4.526315789473684
8335995,2,B001QLKHYG,"Movie was not great. It was slow getting to the point and was a downer when it got there. I bought this movie for the great footage because it was filmed in Edenton, NC and I was there in the park the day the 4th of July scene was filmed, and myself, my son, and many friends are shown in the film as extras. I expected it to be an uplifting story about a great summer in the beautiful NC coast...it was not.
It was dark and dreary. booo",1303776000,,437,3.9213483146067416
8335996,4,B001QLKHYG,"I became aware of this little known film as a result of seeing
and purchasing ""Canvas"", a 2006 film starring Joe Pantoliano and
Marcia Gay Harden, and a then 11 year old boy, Devon Gearhart.  The
film dealt with a family coming to terms with the mother's mental
illness, as seen through the eyes of the son.  I was so impressed
with Devon's performance, I went on IMDB and discovered his next
movie was ""Dog Days of Summmer"".  It wasn't available until 2009
but I purchased it then, and while it isn't as good as ""Canvas"",
it is worth seeing.  It ultimately has a religious theme,
but that is not the essence of the movie.  It is about a strange
man (Wil Patton) who comes to town one summer (Filmed in Edenton
North Carolina), and changes the lives of the people and the
town.  It is told in flashback style, with narration by the
adult who in the flashbacks is played by Devon Gearhart.  The
film is done in a whimsical style, but with a kind of sinister
underpinning, and is ultimately darker than it seems at first.
It reminded me of ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" in mood and
style (A Ray Bradbury Story).  The film also stars Colin Ford
as Devon's best friend, and he is very good too.  This is Mark
Freiburger's first directorial effort, and he shows great promise.
I have purchased a few copies over the year to give to friends
and relatives, who would otherwise never know about this little
arthouse gem that had almost no theatrical exposure.",1283644800,2,1455,4.481060606060606
8335997,1,B001QLKHYG,This was supposedly a family movie. It was awful! Yuck! The idea seemed to be that everyone has a dark side but there's no redemption for that darkness. There was no resolution to all the badness and there were no likeable characters. The only attempt at resolution was when the lead character returned to his hometown and had a weird psychological experience. He basically had to accept that life sucks and learn not to hate in spite of that. Apparently he was helped in accepting the darkness of life by believing in a B grade monster. It was really dumb. I was disappointed that the Dove foundation put their label on it. I hope no one else wastes their time watching it.,1282348800,4,674,4.532786885245901
8335998,5,B001QLKHYG,I was so pleased this video was available and especially pleased at the price!  I received the video promptly and even though it was not new it was in perfect condition as promised.,1259712000,,181,4.484848484848484
8335999,4,B001QLKHYG,movie was good. had a special interest in it as it was edited by a cousin.,1250726400,,74,3.6875
8336000,3,B001QLKHYG,"The movie Dog Days of Summer is a diamond in the rough.

I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Will Patton's work. While he's been in some really bad movies, he's rarely given a bad performance. So, after reading several good reviews, I decided to buy this DVD. It's a good movie that could have been better.

The main problem is the script. The writing is very uneven, the plot confusing and the character development weak. Which is a shame, because the acting by Devon Gearhart and Colin Ford, as the two young friends Phil and Jackson, is very good.

The script is confusing because I don't think the writers knew what they wanted the story to be. Another reviewer mentioned how similar this movie is to an episode of the Twilight Zone called A Stop at Willoughby. In it, a business man laments his life in the modern world and longs for something simpler.

Is the movie trying to be a coming of age story ? Is it supposed to be a Christian allegory ? Is it supposed to be a supernatural suspense like the Twilight Zone ? It's never quite clear what the message is supposed to be.

That being said, the story is about an adult returning to the town, where he grew up, for one last look. It begins in the present and there are flashbacks to the past. When the past is is unclear. It could be the 70s or even the 80s.

When Philip remembers the town, it's idyllic, a paradise just like Eden and one summer, into Eden comes Eli Cottonmouth. Is he a snake as his name suggests ? Eli Cottonmouth arrives in this Eden with a proposition i.e. to create a model of the town for their 250th anniversary. If you listen to Philip's narrative thoughts of Eli, he is the music man. He's dangerous. Which is what attracts Philip and his friend to him. The town folk are suspicious. Yes, they want him to build a model of their town, but they are wary of his presence. Thus he recruits the two boys to take photos of the town, its buildings and its people for him.

What they learn when taking the photos is that their idyllic town isn't so idyllic. At first, everything seems like Mayberry, but in the end it's more like Peyton Place.

And this is where the story is muddled. The subplots and their characters, which are supposed to support the main plot, aren't developed properly. If the writers had taken more time to flesh out those characters and how they relate to the main characters, this would have been a much better movie.

As it is, it is still a good movie. Will Patton is marvelous as Eli Cottonmouth. His soft Southern voice can be soothing and sinister at the same time. His uses that voice to great effect here. Also wonderful is Richard Herd as the mayor. Both are noted character actors and their acting experience shows.

Even though this movie is flawed, I still enjoyed watching it. If you are a fan of Will Patton's, this is one of his best performances. Also, if folks are interested in seeing a wonderful film with the Christian theme of redemption at its center, please see the Spitfire Grill. It's marvelous.",1249862400,11,3027,4.418312387791741
8336001,1,B001QLKHYG,"This is a TERRIBLE movie!  I find it highly suspect that most of the great 5-star reviews came at the same time ~ January 30th & 31st of 2009, and then they were dripping with praise!  This movie had no point and no story whatsoever!  The movie was poorly written and badly acted.  I would place bets that the rave reviews came from promotional agents and actors representatives to garner business!  This movie was full of violence, wierdness and scary images.  And who ever said it was a christian thriller? PSHAW!  There was nothing christian about this movie, so please, don't go misleading someone who actually cares about what their family watches!  This is not a christian film to show to a christian family!  There is never reference to God or the bible.  This is not a film for children at all.  And the adults and teenagers that I watched this with feel the same!  It was a complete waste of time.  One scene shows a man being beaten by a baseball bat.  Another a boy drowning to his death.  There is drinking and smoking throughout.  A man in a pitiful woe-is-me rage throwing books and yelling.  Overall the violence was overboard and I cannot recommend this movie at all.  It was a waste of a lot of money they spent making it!  Dont waste your money buying it!  Dont waste your time watching it!",1249344000,8,1308,4.485106382978723
