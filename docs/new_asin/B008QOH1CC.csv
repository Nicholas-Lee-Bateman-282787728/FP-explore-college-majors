8529632,4,B008QOH1CC,"As a screenplay writer for Vimeo/Youtube director Frank Stamm, Im judging this film by the same standards Id grade a low-budget project I was involved in.

The cons:

The films writing is dense  at least for its type (horror/slasher film) -- and demands your constant attention. The complex aspect of the plot involves a secretive group spying on a group of high schoolers. Their spying is by way of a recording device implanted in one of the high schoolers eyes. Things get weirder as the film continues, to the point they become confusing.

The pros:

This film is almost a textbook example of how to make a great film on a very limited budget:

1) The filmmakers use creative editing. The opening scene is of a car racing thru the woods and crashing. If you take a look at the individual shots, theres nothing a teenager with a home video camera couldn't shoot, but the combination of shots makes the sequence feel like a driving, exciting state-of-the-art opening to the film.

2) The filmmakers use innovative cinematography. They have a hip way of composing shots, which makes the introduction of the main characters at the start of the film come across with a quirky, almost Napoleon Dynamite-esque feel (I refer specifically to shots of the garage band, and the boy being tortured in the locker room).

3) The script is well written, both in terms of the dialog being sharp, and funny at times, as well as in the plot developing in weird and unexpected ways. Its only at a point about halfway through the film that  as already mentioned  the film becomes confusing.

Although this film is marketed as a horror/slasher film, and it is that, the film shifts gears a number of times. As already mentioned, an early part of the film evokes a Napoleon Dynamite comparison. Very interesting.

The actors  almost all unknowns -- come across well. I don't know if this is because of the various actors abilities, but my guess is  as its a low budget film, and they are usually short of capable acting talent  my guess is the actors coming across well has something to do with the director. He most likely limited the amount of dialog for the least talented actors, and knew how to push his better actors.",1482883200,2,2204,4.658914728682171
