6791679,5,B00PB4696O,"Endearing movie.  I just REALLY wanted to support the young people who so wanted the freedom to not just do whatever harmless thing they wanted to do, but to deeply express themselves.  The actors are all wonderful.  The little college student girl is an amazing dancer, wish there were more shots of her.  I am buying this film for my home collection.",1437177600,2,352,4.629032258064516
6791680,4,B00PB4696O,"A good story, but lacking details and umph! I liked it though. So happy he got a chance to dance",1437177600,,96,3.85
6791681,3,B00PB4696O,"""Desert Dancer"" (2014 release from the UK; 100 min.) brings the story of Afshin, a dancer wanna-be in modern Iran (where dancing is forbidden), and his friends. As the movie opens, we are reminded that the movie is ""based on a true story"", as we see someone being pushed and kicked around. We then go back ""ten years earlier"", where we see a young Alshin get his hands on a ""Dirty Dancing"" DVD. After getting busted at school for dancing, a friendly teacher leads him to the Saba Arts School, a secret school where dancing and performing arts are encouraged. The young Afshin watches with fascination footage of Rudolph Nureyev. We then are transported to ""Iran, 2009"", and Afshin arrives at the University of Teheran, in the run-up to the presidential elections. Afshin quickly makes friends with a handful of other like-minded students, including a young woman named Elaheh. They decide to form an underground dance group. At this point we are maybe 15-20 min, into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: the is the directing debut of Richard Raymond, who also produced. The movie is really several parallel stories at once: how Afshin and his friends take chances in starting a dance group; how they and Iran in general saw the 2009 elections as a chance to change society, and the potential romance between Afshin and Elaheh. Of these three story lines, the first one is by far the more effective. The movie features tons of dancing sequences (and great music along with it). That said, the movie falters badly when it ventures into the political side of things, in particular as this of course will be compared to another recent movie that focuses on those 2009 presidential election, the John Stewart-directed ""Rosewater"". Further undermining the movie are the often stilted, even wooden, performances of the actors. You can almost see and feel the director yell out ""and... action!"" and the actors start performing. It's too bad, as the movie is well intended, but it all comes across superficially and without the least of tension (when in fact there should be plenty of tension).

""Desert Dancer"" opened this weekend without any pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati. I thought the premise looked intriguing so I went to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was not well attended, I'm afraid to say. Even though the premise was promising, in the end I felt disappointed by this movie. It just doesn't match up very well as compared to ""Rosewater"", despite the pleasant dancing sequences. If you have a chance to see ""Desert Dancer"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I encourage you to check it out and draw your own conclusion.",1430524800,6,2853,4.820408163265306

6791683,5,B00PB4696O,"Excellent, eye opening film about repression in Iran!  While one might not consider dancing a very effective form of protest -- and it really isn't!!! -- the film shows that people will always seek the freedom to express themselves.  The film is based on a true story, and succeeds in arousing sympathy for the oppressed people of Iran.",1425427200,3,336,4.775862068965517

6791685,4,B00PB4696O,"I thought the movie helped to show the Iranian government 's prohibition on dancing and the arts in general, and the lengths that some had to take to express their passion amid fear of death.",1472169600,,191,4.485714285714286

6791711,4,B00PB4696O,"Very good movie portraying the denial of civil liberties Iran citizens are deprived of in current government, where dancing is a crime. (among other simple things)
Freida Selena Pinto (slum dog millionaire) and the rest of supporting cast were good with their roles and there are many parts in this film where it make you mad that this kind of injustice although not one of the worst that exists in this world, the simple fact they look at it as an injustice to just dance, is criminal and wants you want to crawl into the screen and choke their so ""call secret police"".
The dancing choreography was great on its own and speaks for itself without even having to say a world. I strongly recommend this picture specially to those people not familiar with things like this in other countries we take for granted. The story and specially the ending will leave you feeling very satisfied about having watch this movie. It is true when they say ""Freedom Take Courage""",1447027200,3,961,4.658823529411765
6791712,5,B00PB4696O,"If you like dance movies, this is for you. It's comparable to the best true-story dance movies like 'Mao's Last Dancer', 'Dancing Across Borders', and so on. If you liked those movies, you will love this.

It's well cast, well acted, well danced, and very interesting and
dramatic. I loved it!

Highly recommended for dance-movie fans.

The lead character is especially well cast, and he dances marvelously,
with passion and beauty and skill, while also being an excellent actor.",1445817600,7,479,5.037974683544304

6791716,4,B00PB4696O,"A beautiful movie.  The only thing I brought it down for is that to create the political religious climate of the movie, they have some violent scenes, and some of the characterization was unnecessary (trying to save a drug addict).",1444176000,,232,4.8
6791717,5,B00PB4696O,"Don't mind those nasty critics reviews, the people liked it and that's what counts!  I personally liked it better than Rose Water (the other non Iranian movie about the green revolution) . The story is more interesting and it is more visually stunning due the strikingingly beautiful actors and dancing. I can't usually take interpretive dance seriously, but this had me entranced (especially the scene in the desert). If your a fan of dancing or freedom of expression or Iran or just want to see a decent movie that is about something meaningful and important, spend the 5 bucks and see Desert Dancer!",1443744000,2,602,4.844660194174757

6791719,5,B00PB4696O,Desert Dancer is an excellent story of artistic repression without being too maudlin. It can go too long on some scenes and cut away too quickly on others but in general it is a very good treatment of a true story.,1442016000,3,214,4.2439024390243905
