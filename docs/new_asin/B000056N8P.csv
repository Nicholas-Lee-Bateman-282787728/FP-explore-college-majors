7932627,4,B000056N8P,"This program was a great tribute to a wonderful actress. All of Lucy's best and funniest moments are shown here Vitametavegemin, candy factory, grape stomping etc. It was also nice to see all the big stars at the time paying tribute to Lucy. It makes me sad to see how many we have lost over the years. This DVD should have had a lot more of Lucy in it. She is only on at the very end of the DVD to accept a plaque. You would think that since this was a tribute to her, she would have been in it a lot more.",1110412800,3,507,3.8846153846153846
7932628,1,B000056N8P,"CBS RUSHED THIS TV SPECIAL OUT BACK IN '76 TO MASSAGE THE EGO OF ITS' BIGGEST PRIME TIME MONEY MAKER OF ALL TIME. SHE WAS IN SEMI-RETIREMENT WHEN THIS TV SPECIAL AIRED. CLAD IN A WIG, UGLY GOWN AND DRAG QUEEN LIKE MAKE-UP, LUCY'S ACCEPTS A JIVE PLAQUE FROM JAMES STEWART AT THE END OF THIS TIRED MONTAGE OF HER TV WORK. SHE SEEMED JUST HAPPY TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO. BACKGAMMON,BOOZE AND CIGARETTES WAS WHAT SHE PASSED TIME WITH IN HER LONELY BEVERLY HILLS MANSION. HER HUSBAND, GARRY MORTON WAS PLAYING TENNIS AND SLEEPING AROUND.

7932629,5,B000056N8P,I THINK THAT IS GREAT THAT THEY MADE THIS ONE FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT LUCILLE BALL WAS CAPABLE OF. THEY SHOW A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF SHE DID DURING HER CARRER. I THINK SHE WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST FEMALE COMEDIAN THAT EVER LIVED.,996105600,5,234,4.222222222222222
7932630,5,B000056N8P,"Let me first say that as far as picture quality goes on this DVD, I would rate that with 4 stars.  However, the content of this DVD  makes up for the picture quality.  Not that the picture is bad, I just feel that during remastering some of the clips could have been a lot clearer.  With that aside, let me say that this is a super DVD to have in your collection.  As of right now it is the only place you can find anything of ""I Love Lucy"" available on DVD, and this is the only place any clips of ""Here's Lucy"" can be found.  If you want to relive many of your favorite Lucy moments from the past, this is the place to go.  Here you can find some of the classics like the famous Vitameatavegamin, or the candy factory, or even the time when Lucy and Vivian (on ""The Lucy Show"") installed the shower and got stuck in it while it kept filling with more and more water.  The great thing about this DVD is that it helps remind the viewer why Lucille Ball was/is as important as she has remained, and probably will be, to the television and entertainment world.
I hope that the people at Paul Brownstein Productions start to release more rare Lucille Ball shows, such as her 1977 special ""Lucy Calls the President"" that reunited her with many of her costars like Gale Gordon and Vivian Vance.  I think that we as fans need to let the companies that hold the rights to these shows know that there is a demand for them, and pass on the simple message that it's ""Time To Open The Vaults!""",990403200,22,1482,4.208480565371024
