5545354,5,B00B1DV59A,"I'm a big Ellen Barrett fan and have several of her DVDs. I did feel like I got a great cardio workout. What I like best: you use arm weights for the entire series (but that's optional) no crunches, no pushups, and yet a really good arm and core workout. This is already one of my favorites.",1361491200,5,291,4.12280701754386
5545355,5,B00B1DV59A,This is a deceptively hard workout.  Ellen Barrett delivered again.  Great workout--this will for sure be in my DVD rotation for a long time.,1361404800,,141,4.833333333333333
5545356,5,B00B1DV59A,"I just love all of Ellen Barrett's workouts.  This workout goes so fast it is over before you know it!  There were several movements I really loved in this workout but my favorite movement is the ""namaste plie"".  This move worked so many parts of your body, this may even be my favorite move out of all her dvds!  This workout will make your thighs burn from all the lunge related work.  The burn is what makes your body stronger.  I do wish this workout was longer as I prefer a longer workout but it is an express workout meaning a faster workout.  And as another stated there is no resting times in this dvd it is constant hard workout the whole way through.  This is a great workout dvd for those days you don't got alot of time.  I love using this workout when I'm crunched for time.  I highly recommend this workout to anyone, this is for all fitness levels and is great when you need a faster workout.",1361145600,6,908,4.257309941520468
5545357,5,B00B1DV59A,"I absolutely love this workout. I was wondering how this one would be in comparison to her standard studio workout since it is shorter. It is definatley different but different in this case is good. The 45 minute workouts feels more relaxed while this workout really keeps you on your toes (literally too, alot of relevees) combining alot of different movement at once. Afterwards I feel envigorated and ready to go. I love this new series and can't wait until the release of the two to come in spring

5545358,5,B00B1DV59A,"I'm so glad that Ellen did another sculpting workout using weights although everything she does is unique, bold and invigorating. Even though I'm no stranger to using weights, I am going to have to build up to using 3 pound weights all the way through Sleek Sculpt Express--I can't get through the ""rib cage reach"" moves right now, but I love mastering something difficult. Also, the tip toe moves are great for balance and working the calf muscles. This dvd is really a fun balance of yoga, strength building and fat burning. Thanks Ellen!",1359936000,12,540,4.75531914893617
5545359,5,B00B1DV59A,"I Love this new workout from Ellen Barrett!  I have almost all of her other workouts so obviously I like her style. If you have ever done one of her dvd's this is similar in style but you use weights literally from start to finish, it is quicker paced (no wasted time at all) and the music is more upbeat and lively.(loved it) You will get a solid yet peaceful workout with this workout. I appreciate that she leads you in a workout where you can work your whole body and not come away injured and totally exhausted and miserable.  I loved it. Can't wait for her other workouts to come out!",1359676800,11,590,4.258928571428571
5545360,5,B00B1DV59A,"Ellen Barrett is my absolute favorite fitness instructor.  I own several of her videos and was thrilled to see she finally put out a 30 minute workout video but wondered if it would feel as effective as her typical 45-50 minute workouts.  This video did not disappoint.  I think I was sweating just as much at the end of this workout as I do her full length workouts.  She does a fantastic job of incorporating flowing, large ranges of movement forcing all of your muscles to work at the same time.  I was also surprised to notice some sore muscles the next day!!  Her cues are terrific as always, the music is great and the 30 minutes go by quickly.  I have yet to be disappointed by any workout video Ellen puts out.  She is truly amazing.",1359331200,7,741,4.357664233576642
5545361,5,B00B1DV59A,"Ive done a lot of exercise DVDs (I own 300+), and Ellen Barrett is one of my favorite instructors.  She is very consistent. Cues well, you always know what you are doing, yet she never bores me.  I have nearly all her studs (all her Crunch workouts, all her Self workouts, and all her Live series, plus a few more) and I think this may become a favorite.
I love the length (30 minutes, shorter than the 45 min of earlier ""live"" workouts)sometimes you just have 30 minutes!  This is very time efficient. No wasted minutes, and you are holding your light weights from warm up to cool down.  Lots of relieves (which I love).  No planks (which I also love!)--this workoit is all standing,though you will engage your core throughout.
Like her previous workout, this is small space friendly--if you have room for a yoga Matt, you have room for this.
Totally recommended!",1359158400,54,864,4.584415584415584
5545382,5,B00B1DV59A,"Love the fact that Ellen Barret emphasizes long smooth movements, yet you still end up sweating up a storm and have toned muscles without any bulk. I have many of her videos and would probably buy more.",1453161600,,202,4.486486486486487

5545385,5,B00B1DV59A,"Ellen is my favorite dvd instructor! I did this workout today and was a little behind on the pace since it was new to me. I think I will really like this once I get used to the moves. Like other reviewers, I agree 1lb weights are plenty to start with, I chose 1lb weighted fitness gloves and love the ease of use! I am so happy to have found a 30 min workout, just  right for busy mornings. It is very good aerobic exercise, I am an intermediate level of fitness. I like that there is no jumping around, just repetitive solid yoga type flowing movements. This helps learn the moves too. If you are considering this dvd, get it.

30 days later and this is my fav workout, its quick and is great for travel. You won't need much room to do this one, you stay on the mat. I have increased to 2lb weights and have noticed a difference. I def get a bit sweaty and think this one is great for most ay fitness level. I love the repetitive routine, you build up to it and its so easy to follow along! Get it!!!",1449532800,2,1001,4.05050505050505
5545386,5,B00B1DV59A,"Ellen Barrett does it right in this amazing workout. It's challenging but not discouraging, tough but not impossible. She's encouraging without turning into a robotic cheerleader, and her genuine energy comes through in every part of the workout. I consider myself to be fairly fit, and this video made me break a sweat in the first five minutes! Thanks, Ellen, for another great workout that motivates me to stay moving.",1444176000,,421,5.0285714285714285
5545387,5,B00B1DV59A,This is the second DVD of Ellen's that I have ordered.  Complete overall body workout that you will definitely feel it the next day.  Love that the movements are fluid with no jarring on the joints.,1444003200,,198,4.472222222222222

5545390,5,B00B1DV59A,This is a great tape. good work out. I am 56 yrs. old and in pretty good shape and I did not have any problem doing it. She is a great instructor,1439424000,,145,3.5625
5545391,3,B00B1DV59A,This was much easier than I thought it would be- I burned under 200 calories according to my heart rate monitor.  I may work it into my schedule as an early morning workout before going to work and then do a run on those days after work.  But it is definitely not a stand alone workout for someone looking to burn calories.,1439164800,4,323,4.193548387096774

5545416,5,B00B1DV59A,"I really like this workout. The time goes by quickly and leaves me feeling energized. I doubted I would see results as I had been doing more challenging yoga workouts as well as regularly using Jillian Michaels prior to using this video, but I bought 3 Ellen videos at once and have been alternating them 4-6 days a week for the last 4 weeks and see results. I am down about 3lbs (couldn't lose any despite working out 6 days/week for 4 months), and feel slimmer. Easy to follow but fun as well.",1434672000,2,495,4.333333333333333

5545419,5,B00B1DV59A,I had borrowed this from my sister before purchasing.  I really like it!  I like to treadmill but don't want to jump around too much with a video.  This uses the whole body and you have the weights all the time but it I do feel stronger and invigorated after doing it.  It's not way hard core but it also because of that it isn't discouraging and it keeps me coming back.  Great addition to a workout schedule!  The 30 minutes go by pretty quickly so the kids actually let me do the whole thing!  My 4 year old even likes to join me sometimes.  :),1426550400,,547,4.09433962264151

5545425,5,B00B1DV59A,"This short (30 minute) workout is moderately tough. Using weights, it's quite different from Ellen's other workouts I do. But, it is nice to have a mix and Ellen Barrett is a great instructor. I'm a 70 year old guy in fairly good condition.  I think whether you use 1, 2, 3 or 4 pound weights you will get a good workout. I used my 4 pound hand weights and had trouble finishing several exercises. During the workout Ellen says she is using 3 pound weights. One odd thing about the presentation is the sound at the beginning and the end. I guess it's music but someone groans and moans during the ""music"", giving the impression he is in distress. Fortunately, it only goes on for a couple of minutes.",1421971200,3,700,4.384615384615385

While my arms did get worked with 3-5 pound weights, I would not recommend this to a seasoned athlete.  This is geared to a novice or beginner to the world of exercise.",1411948800,,265,4.36734693877551
5545428,5,B00B1DV59A,Ellen is the best. I have developed nice muscles around my arms and back with this video. Works the waist good too. So glad I got this workout and will add more of Ellen's dvd's to my collection.,1410825600,4,195,4.157894736842105
5545429,5,B00B1DV59A,This is a quick workout (only 30 minutes) but I was definitely feeling it the next day! Not horribly sore...just could tell I'd been working muscles that don't usually get worked. I love Ellen Barrett's videos. This is my 3rd video of hers and I plan on ordering more.  My favorite is Crunch - Fat Burning Pilates for a bit longer workout (45 minutes) but this is my 2nd favorite.,1408233600,3,380,4.428571428571429
5545430,5,B00B1DV59A,"Oh, man, I love this workout!!  I have several Ellen Barrett workout DVDs, but the express ones are my favorite.  I am a busy mother of four, and sometimes I just don't have that extra twenty minutes (in her regular-length workouts).  Thirty minutes is exactly what I need.  This is a complete workout.  Head to toe feels worked but energized.  I think I'm in fairly good shape, I exercise 5-7 times a week.  But this still works everything so well.  The key to getting the most out of Barrett's workouts is really focusing on form and the muscles you're using.  It's truly mind-body fitness.

I so badly wish there were more of these! I would buy them all!!",1408060800,5,658,4.5
5545431,5,B00B1DV59A,"This was just what I was looking for! I wanted a low-impact workout that was 30 minutes but still felt like a good workout. I love this one!  Even though you do this barefoot (which I love), don't be fooled -- this really will get your heart rate up. By the end, you feel energized, stretched, toned, and fabulous!

Ellen is very upbeat & motivating, and is careful to give good cueing such as how to protect your low back. She also has someone in the background doing modifications of the moves.

I love her style, and I am going to try her other workouts too.",1407974400,3,561,4.273584905660377

5545444,4,B00B1DV59A,"This is an efficient, time saving workout with some light cardio benefit. It has an all around nice flow and although you do not directly work your abdominals you do work them with proper form in the workout. I gave this dvd 4 stars as it is possible to injure your shoulder/arm area. I advise going lighter on the weights then you may think, this workout is more about form vs. heavy weight for best results. I like doing this workout with 2-3 pounds (4-5 lbs just for the area that works the biceps). I often follow this with a mat yoga routine. This is a fun one when you have a busy weekend planned, but wanted to feel like you worked out!",1404086400,5,643,4.235772357723577

5545447,4,B00B1DV59A,"Upper body intensity in that the weights are NEVER eliminated.  I use 2 lb weights and that is plenty challenging enough for me!  The beauty of this workout is in the intensity and limited time frame.  I guess anyone can do just about anything for 30 minutes. I prefer EB's 30 minute ""Super Fast Body Blast"" - it's just more - fun but I would recommend this workout.",1403395200,4,366,4.352941176470588
5545448,5,B00B1DV59A,"My first time going through this dvd, I found it ""express"" like.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and wasn't counting down the minutes for this workout to be finished.  Ellen has 2 background exercisers with her;  and they are all beautiful women.  The music is upbeat and lively with a fun aspect.  I used 2 pound weights and it was definitely tough on my deltoids.  There is no lying down on the floor exercises. This is not a hard core build big muscles heart pounding workout but it did get my heart rate up and I broke out in a light sweat.  I whole heartedly recommend this to anyone needing an express 30 minute workout if you like Ellen's style of teaching.  She leaves me feeling graceful and at peace.",1402617600,6,703,4.395348837209302
5545449,5,B00B1DV59A,I first saw Ellen Barrett on Fit TV and decided to buy a few of her videos.  She is an excellent trainer and knows the body and how to work the body with her movements.  She fits in a power packed session in a half hour without a lot of props.  She doesn't overwork without stretching at the end of her session.  A great find if you want to get a good workout at home,1402531200,2,367,3.8533333333333335

5545453,5,B00B1DV59A,I have a handful of Ellen Barrett's workouts and really like them all.

5545454,5,B00B1DV59A,"I absolutely love Sleek Sculpt Express. It's the first Ellen Barrett DVD I've seen, and she's excellent -- good cuing, motivating and supportive without being super-perky and annoying, she seems really genuine and friendly and just basically like a nice person to spend 30 minutes listening to. The music is a great fit -- it's nice and keeps you going (kind of new age-y with a beat), but it also fades into the background enough that you don't get sick of it. The workout itself is great. I sweat and my heart rate gets up, and my muscles get a real workout too (I feel it the next day!). I've been doing it maybe 2-3 times a week for a month or so, and I can already feel a difference in my strength and endurance (and can handle heavier hand weights than when I started). I love the 30 minute length, because it keeps me from the ""waah-I-don't-have-time"" excuse. Totally efficient use of time: nonstop, flowing movements. LOVE it.

I was a runner for the past 10 years, and now with kids (and frankly, just tired of running) getting in my usual runs became impossible.  I turned to videos for a quick exercise fix.  In the past I would get bored with any video almost instantly.  But Ellen keeps me coming back for more.  I really look forward to all of her workouts!",1383350400,,446,4.5125
5545508,5,B00B1DV59A,"I have been a fan of Ellen Barrett for about 2 years now and have all her DVDs that she produced plus some others. I love her personality, instruction and cueing but I'm NOT a huge fan of ALL of her DVDs so I'm not that loved up.

I am however a big fan of & love her sculpting DVDs which all use light hand weights. This one plus Slim Sculpt and Skinny Sculpt. Ellen also leads CRUNCH: Burn & Firm Pilates (which also uses weights and is pretty good).

Sleek Sculpt Express is a 30 minute workout which combines Ellen's usual strength, stretch and some cardio for a gentle yet effective workout. I am a fan of how she works you out but doesn't leave you feeling like you've done something super hectic and therefore need to go meditate to bring back some calmness. Because of this and her excellent cueing, you are always able to keep up with her and not injure yourself as you rush to keep up (as has happened to me using another well known instructor's DVDs).

Not a fan of the music in this one at first - the chanting sounded rather mournful but after awhile I am able to drown out/ignore the music and concentrate on form. I like to pair this DVD with either cardio (interval speeds on the treadmill) or another 30 minute DVD (i.e. doing Super Fast Body Blast first then Sleek Sculpt Express I really felt it in the glutes the next day - awesome!)

Ellen's DVDs are for those who want a peaceful/centred vibe after their workouts - if you're an energiser bunny (or hard core athlete) into the crazy stuff like insanity (no pun intended) then Ellen's not for you. Slow and steady does win the race and I've changed and toned my entire body thanks to Ellen's workouts.",1381104000,,1672,4.3493589743589745
5545509,5,B00B1DV59A,"LOVE this!  Ellen is always great, but this is so good when you are short on time.  I swear her shorter workouts make up for the 15 minutes less by adding intensity - but still very manageable.  Some tough segments, but after just a few times, I feel strong enough and am getting stronger each time.",1380672000,,299,4.303571428571429

She does work with weights in her hands the entire time, so for my 1st time I only held the weights for part of the workout. For my second time I used weighted gloves, those worked really well for me. For as easy as I thought this routine was I will tell you I was extremely sore the next day, that surprised me since I didn't feel I was working that hard. So I do believe that this will be one of my regular workout DVD's.",1379462400,,601,3.894308943089431
5545523,5,B00B1DV59A,I have been working out with ellen and Debbie Siebers  advanced slim n six for almost a year now and have to say that I am very impressed and have seen great results even though the workouts are not high impact. Her workouts are more polished and thoughtful and because of the yoga pilate influence you feel a calming effect as well as toning and getting your heart rate up. This is only 30 minutes but you get your heart rate up and it is quite strenuous. I have been working out for over thirty years so this did not make me sore but it made me tired the next day and slightly achy. I felt the moves were great and the music funky and quite different from her usual. Ellen of course is great and pays great attention to detail. I recommend this highly and you will get a great short workout that really puts you thru your paces. Along with eating right and watching your calories this will give you a sculpted look like a dancer and not a bulky look. I am 63 inches tall and a assize 2 to 3 at 47 so I most assuredly do not want a bulky look but prefer sleek and sculpted and this will give you this look.,1378598400,6,1107,4.077981651376147

5545527,5,B00B1DV59A,Ellen Barrett has a way of taking you through a workout without you realizing that you have just exercised every muscle in your body....but you'll know it the next day! Very low impact - lots of balance challenges - and a very fluid routine. Just what a balance challenged older woman needs! I now have 5 DVD's by Ellen and I love them all.,1374192000,3,340,4.328125

This is perfect...burned 250 calories in 30 minutes and was dripping with sweat. I also felt stretched.

This DVD is a continuous 30 minutes and you use light weights for the entire workout.  The workout includes a short warm-up and ends with a cool down stretch.  Ellen is good at using combination movements that both give you a strength impact and keep your heart rate up.  I think this is a solid intermediate workout--there are lots of reps of movements and I found it challenging, but do-able.  Ellen is calm and encouraging.  This is this a relaxing and invigorating workout.",1367625600,,601,4.721153846153846

It is part of her Live series and follows the same pattern as her last two workouts except that there are only two background exercisers.  I like this because it's easier to see (and follow) one person.  I really like this DVD because it just flows for me.  Yes, you do all the moves on one side and then repeat them, something I usually don't like.  But, because of the shorter time frame of the workout (30 minutes), it didn't drag for me like previous workouts that had this pattern.  To me, the moves just flow and I get into the groove with them and feel graceful and centered and (yet) worked out.",1367193600,,841,4.238993710691824
5545563,4,B00B1DV59A,"I am enjoying this workout.  I like using handweights, and the moves are very doable, unlike some of her other workouts that leave you struggling for balance more than working out.  I sometimes wonder about Ellen Barrett's choice of back-up performers; there always seems to be one that does the exercises with strikingly poor form. While I'm glad to see these people suffering just like I am, at the same time, it's irritating to have someone leading your workout badly.  Besides that, Sleek Sculpt Express is a fun way to get a weight-bearing workout with a nice touch of cardio.",1367020800,,581,4.79

I also have Ellen Barrett Skinny Sculpt, which is about 45 minutes, and is also a great workout.  I can use 3 pound weights with Skinny Sculpt.  I would recommend this workout to all because you can use more or less weight (or no weight) to make it as challenging as you like.  It flows very nicely and even though it is only 1/2 hour it seems to work every muscle group.",1365206400,2,496,4.125

5545583,5,B00B1DV59A,"I have been so slack lately with my workouts, that I've lost all my tone and condition and am just starting back again.  Even though I've done tougher workouts than this, this is a great way to either begin again, or just begin.  It's tougher than it looks and each movement is fluid and easy.  You are never stopping throughout the entire workout and so your heart rate also gets up there quite a bit.  It's just under 30 minutes, and it incorporates a small warm up and cool down in that time.  Ellen is a good, clear instructor and she's encouraging too without being annoying.  The other two exercisers on the DVD are smiley and one is even showing that the same workout can be done without weights.
I suggest light dumbbells to start with because you really are continuously moving your arms and so you don't want to be too fatigued too soon.  As you do this more often, you'll be able to increase the weight.  At the end of the DVD, she says that your energy level will be on high for quite some time after you're done, and she's not wrong.  I do this workout on days where I've only gone for a 20 minute walk and I find that doing that little bit of cardio plus this 30 minute routine, is enough for busy days.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1363996800,19,1247,4.268085106382979
5545584,5,B00B1DV59A,I tried this for the first time today and it was great.  30 minute workouts really fit in to my super busy day and I am a huge Ellen fan so this was perfect.  I have tried other dvds and I always find my self returning to Ellen.  Her workouts leave me feeling energized and they really work when it comes to wanting to drop a few pounds.  I tried this one with 4 pound weights and could really feel the burn during certain moves.  Thanks Ellen for another great workout.,1363824000,5,470,4.1208791208791204

5545587,5,B00B1DV59A,"I have a large collection of Ellen workouts, but I think she has done her best work with this 30-minute DVD.  I feel I worked as hard or harder in 30 minutes than I did with the previous longer workouts.  Although this is primarily a sculpting workout, I felt my heart rate really rise during the segment where you have to plie and touch your dumbbells to the ground repeatedly.  I would rate this as a solid intermediate with no time wasted; a lot of great compound movements.  Ellen does all one side in the first 15 minutes and then you switch sides for the last 15 minutes.  You get the same pleasant, airy set as her previous Live workouts with two background exercisers; one shows easier modifications.  I used three-pound dumbbells throughout and I would not have wanted to go any higher for intensity or safety purposes for these mostly long-lever movements.

There is no dedicated warm-up, but since this workout only uses light weights, I really didn't feel it was necessary.  As an all-standing workout that emphasizes time efficiency, there is only a short cool-down and a few active stretches.  However, when you are doing a 30-minute routine, something has to give.

The music is better than a lot of Ellen's previous offerings and the sound volume is excellent.  Ms. Barrett, as usual, is very polished and motivating.",1362441600,72,1333,4.752173913043478

I have never been injured before doing an exercise dvd, but I ended up hurting my back/shoulder blade really badly after doing this dvd.  I don't have any preexisting back problems  and I am afraid to do this dvd again even without the weights. I am in fairly good shape and in my early 30s. I liked that this was an express workout, but I wonder if it was too rushed and whether it should have included more back or arm stretches? I wanted to put this review in to caution people to be extra careful if you do this dvd. I didn't feel it until the next day when I tried to lift my 2 year old and almost passed out from the pain.

It actually feels sybaritic and relaxing to do this fluid, well-cued workout, which also has great production values and soothing, pleasant music.  I even like the warm wood floors in the studio -- the aesthetic here is much more welcoming and pleasant than that of most other fitness videos.  Ellen's slightly New Age sensibility infuses this workout (and the others in this series) -- I think this was a personal best for her.",1488672000,,540,4.723404255319149
8560638,4,B00B1DV59A,"This DVD is mostly for an advanced level and needs to be worked up to slowly if you are beginning or novice, even early intermediate level.  Very useful for gaining strength, stamina and a strong defined upper body!  My advice if you  want to try and challenge yourself is to 1)  Don't do as many reps as Ellen--If she does 12 reps, do 6 or 4, then work your way up from there.  2) don't make the arm and leg movements with as large a range as Ellen does.  I often keep my arm movements and squatting movements with my legs much smaller as I follow along. There is no way I could hang with the whole DVD straight through going 100%, if I didn't utilize these modifications.  The woman behind Ellen with the weights looks like she about ready to pass out after 20 minutes.
Pace yourself, climb steady and you'll reap the rewards.  I would give this 5 stars but Ellen does ""rush"" it in a few places, and doesn't give enough warning to be careful with your lower back-- that's the only negative for me.",1479772800,,999,4.276595744680851

8560640,4,B00B1DV59A,I like this routine! I enjoy the offbeat music - something a little different.  Some parts of the routine a little boring. but overall it is a good dvd,1472342400,,151,4.206896551724138
8560641,5,B00B1DV59A,I love almost ALL of Ellen's DVDs.  This one I appreciate for packing a work out in to 30 minutes.,1470700800,,98,3.9
8560642,4,B00B1DV59A,"Reasonably short, fairly vigorous work out that does seem to include most muscle groups.",1466640000,,88,5.357142857142857
8560643,5,B00B1DV59A,In Ellen's unique style she will whoop your butt! Loved the flow and unconventional moves,1463270400,,89,5.0
8560644,5,B00B1DV59A,"I have several other Ellen workouts, so I purchased this already knowing I like her style.  The thing that makes this dvd particularly useful to me is that she uses light weights when her workouts are usually unweighted, and she packs a lot into an efficient 30 minute workout. It works the arms more than usual, the core as well as she always does (which is excellent and unique, if you don't already know that), and there is enough cardio in there to make me feel like I've done a well-rounded workout.  It's well worth adding to my regular rotation.

I found that my 5 pound weights were too heavy and my 2 pound weights were too light.  She recommends 3 pounds, which seems about right, but I do think I'm going to work up to the 5 pounders.

One other thing: my calves really, really feel this workout.  Make sure you stretch them out thoroughly afterward.",1456963200,,861,4.452229299363057
8560645,5,B00B1DV59A,"I saw this routine on an exercise channel, so I thought I should purchase it before the show disappeared.  Can to with or without sneakers.  So that is good for cooler weather and when the sun shines (I try not to use my air), kick those shoes off and do it right.  By and by I am 65 years.",1454803200,,290,3.8813559322033897
