Now if someone other than bootleggers would release the two seasons of Harry O I be in heaven the great 70's PI show with the late David Jansen. I wish I wish lol. BTW I just pre order Kojak to nite to boot too.

5062828,5,B0077T5SG8,"From the opening episode, I already knew that Kojak still was the man. Because when you kidnap the niece of the best detective in NYC at that time, expect Kojak to take no prisoners. I mean no matter how you try to rattle this character, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK!!! So there you have it, short and sweet. The quality is outstanding, considering how old this series is. From the appearances of Richard Gere to Christopher Walken, you will not be disappointed by Season 4. After all, who else could win the Golden Globe nearly every season this show was on the air? Exactly! So stop reading this review and hurry up and buy the DVD. Then after you see for yourself, just think ""Who loves ya, baby?!!""",1337644800,4,694,4.47244094488189

8512153,5,B0077T5SG8,"I love these, so ended up getting all seasons and movies. Almost gave it a 4 star because of presentation but each episode plays as should. Each season was/is packaged and labeled differently, which can look odd in a DVD collection if you're a touch OCD. Otherwise, so far all discs have played just fine.... I haven't watched them all yet, but so far so good. They are DVD quality with menus and some discs have special features. The features are as originally aired. They don't appear to be digitally remastered or reformatted, so standard definition and not wide screen... but that's fine with me, that's how it was filmed. Not George Lucas magic here, just good ole Kojak and his shiny bald head, lollipops, snazzy threads.... and Crocker!",1454371200,,743,4.767441860465116
