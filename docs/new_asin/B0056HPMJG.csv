It is though, for the inclusion of the Documentary ""Great American West"" which features Western greats John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and Jimmy Stewart swapping stories and revealing some fond memories of film-making with the great one... John ""Pappy"" Ford. Made in the early 70's, the stars get up close, personal, and a bit sentimental with their mentor, from the sets and gorgeous locations, of films like ""Stagecoach"", ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""The Searchers"", ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", and ""My Darling Clementine"" among many others.

The admiration and respect these greats of Hollywood have for this wonderful director, exudes onto the screen, and I smiled through the entire hour. This is a must have for fans. The moments are priceless. Even Andy Devine makes a ""quick"" appearance. This makes this volume more than worth the price of admission.

The other films included are:

""Bells Of San Angelo""..From 1947 directed by William Witney, this is a corny but fun film, starring Roy Rogers, Trigger(Yes, Trigger gets top billing), Dale Evans and Andy Devine. There's trouble amiss in the local silver mine that borders Mexico. Can Roy save the day and still have time to get in a few tunes, you bet! It's a modern western, but Roy and the boys still ride horses and carry 6 shooters, while everyone else takes the bus! ....4 stars

""Kentucky Rifle""..1955/Color directed by Carl Hittleman. This has some great character actors to spend some time with. Chill Wills, Sterling Holloway, Henry Hull, Lance Fuller and Cathy Downs. Don't expect too much though, in the way of plot or cinematography. A wagon load of Kentucky Rifles, must be protected at all costs, including any passengers who may be along, from the Comanche(who get a pretty bad rap in this one). 3 stars

""White Comanche""...1967/Color. . Even a die hard oater lover like me had a hard time with this one. I thought with Joseph Cotton and William Shatner, I would find some redeeming value, but alas I did not.

Twin brothers who are half white and half Comanche(both played by Shatner, and I forgive him for this), have conflicts between them and with their identities as well. Might be worth the view for a few good laughs. 2 stars

5 stars for the John Ford Documentary and just have some fun with the others.
