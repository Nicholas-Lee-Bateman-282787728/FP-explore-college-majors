7795595,5,0971156700,"I have recently reviewed and evaluated a tobacco use prevention video that I would like to tell you about, ""The Truth about Tobacco,"" which features Patrick Reynolds. He is a grandson of RJ Reynolds, and a renowned tobacco prevention speaker at schools throughout the nation.
This video, which shows a live talk to high school students by Mr. Reynolds, is a compelling and honest overview of the health problems caused by tobacco. The video is an excellent fit with our high school unit on tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. It meets all of our factual information objectives on tobacco use.
It is the best and most up-to-date video on the topic of teen and adult tobacco use. It has no weaknesses! In my opinion, after viewing many similar videos, it is the best video available.
As a result of our review and evaluation, we are purchasing this video for all of our high schools. We are also thinking of bringing Patrick Reynolds in to speak to our students 'live' and are now exploring getting sponsorship through the local County health department and/or our local hospitals. Evidently hospitals like cosponsoring, because he gets good local media coverage, which builds goodwill for them. I feel so positive about this program that I wanted to share this information with you.
