5074810,3,B007C3TVEY,"Tilda Swinton is stripped of her exotic androgyny as the guilt-ridden mother,Eva, who gloried in her formerly independent state of freewheeling travel and love of Franklin her husband. The book and film dealt with a taboo: what if a mother doesn't like her son or can't bond with him?Debate centred upon maternal ambivalence and bad parenting. What if a child felt unwanted, would his lack of love be turned into a weapon of manipulative psychopathy?Pregnancy doesn't kickstart the milk of human kindness. The parents are dishonest in their dealings with Kevin's bad behaviour,lack of empathy and subtle malevolence. Eva puts up with his negative behavoiur and never really confronts him,even though she knows she should. Franklin(JC Reilly) buries his head in the sand,pretends everything is hunky-dory,overcompensating for Eva's lack of affection for Kevin. Kevin levers himself between the two of them and exposes their weakness. Kevin is no Damien:he's both arrogant and cruel to mother and sister,disrespects but loves his dad,but he's also vulnerable, though he's the context of vast cunning and manipulative evil. Kevin has picked up from a very young age he is the cause of his mother's loss of freedom,so he is perfectly capable of talking but she thinks he intentionally holds back on his language development out of spite as he doesn't want to please her. Similarly, she thinks he is perfectly capable of bowel control and toilet training, but until the age of 6 he is still in nappies, making her life intentionally as awkward as possible.

Of course due to the problems of running time and the slashing of the budget,Ramsay has had to concertina the story in a flashback structure(we leave out the epistolary nature of the novel)stripping down the literary conceit,giving us a delayed reveal through net curtains veiling the worst of Kevin's misdemeanours. We get the splintering of time,the symbolism of imagery with the colour red, tomatoes,paint,soup cans,to immerse you in the tormented, fragmented memories of the woman who is depicted as the victim,nailed teeth-grindingly and reluctantly to motherhood,and the monstrous nature of her evolving son. Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller are brilliant younger and older Kevins. This is not treated as an issue film,we are given the subjective view of Eva looking back and asking what went wrong from Kevin's conception to his murders,in the story of her family. Eva instantly feels a connection with her daughter in a way she never did for Kevin. Whether that makes him jealous or whatever, he always uses her to torment Eva further. Once her daughter loses her eye (because of Kevin or not, who knows) then Kevin constantly picks on her about it. Swinton plays her part superbly well,one of anxiety,coldness and tension. The cinematography and sound design are beautiful as is the editing, just excellent. However where the film falls down is perhaps in the plot and execution of story. We're left almost wondering what the entire purpose of the film was,it's an impressionistic rendition of a mother's experience and the nature of her unconditional love for a confused, complex,damaged and disturbed child. Brave but ultimately flawed.",1332288000,2,3197,5.195736434108527
5074811,3,B007C3TVEY,"What is it that we always hear? Not just from friends, but especially in movies and TV shows about parenting. It's that there's ""no guidebook"" to being a parent. You just have to do your best and learn as you go. That assumes a level of parental instinct exists on even the most basic level, but what if there isn't? What if you hate your child? What if your child hates you and everything else just as much?

In We Need to Talk About Kevin, that emotional deficit leads to nightmarish consequences, the kind that would leave any rational parent breaking out in a drenching cold sweat. When we first meet Eva(Tilda Swinton), she seems adrift in this world. For unknown reasons she's hated and ridiculed by the people she meets on the street. In the heavily used flashbacks we see her during a happier time, spirited and in lust's grip with Franklin(John C. Reilly), the new man in her life. A particularly blissful evening leads to an unexpected pregnancy, marriage, and a fresh start in the suburbs.

From there it's immediately downhill, as their son, Kevin, is a handful from the start. Eva can't stop him from crying, to the point where she takes walks near construction sites just to drown him out. He doesn't listen to her, going out of his way to do the opposite of what she wants. She has no connection with the boy, and as he gets older nothing seems to change. The bond isn't there. She's not built for it, and even if she was, Kevin wouldn't want it. In time he only grows more violent and hateful, especially towards her. The dynamic changes as a little sister enters the family, with Kevin having someone completely defenseless to terrorize. Franklin, a clueless schmo of a husband thinks it's no big deal and that it'll pass. He has no idea how wrong he is, about as wrong as a parent can be about anything.

Marking the long awaited return of Lynne Ramsay as director and based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, the film poses an interesting nature vs. nurture question wrapped in a real life horror story . Was it Eva's lack of maternal guidance that leads Kevin down his murderous path? Or was he just a bad seed destined to go off on a killing spree? No answers are forthcoming, and that never really seems to be the point.

Ramsay, who has been away from the camera for nearly a decade, goes a little too far trying to leave a signature fingerprint on the film's look, bathing it in off-putting colors, specifically heavy reds to foreshadow the upcoming violence. The use of flashbacks and time jumping are overdone and add little to the story's impact.  Ramsay's artistic flourishes, including some of the more dreamlike elements as we flash through Eva's memories, feel tacked on and unnecessary.

As many of Tilda Swinton's films tend to be, their success rests solely on her considerable acting talents. Here she is mesmerizing as Eva, a conflicted woman tortured by her own failings, appalled by her hatred for her own son. These are the types of roles Swinton excels at, the ones no other actress would dare to undertake. No one else could play this role and be as believable and haunting as Swinton is. Ezra Miller is woefully miscast as Kevin, however. A likable actor who has done good things before(he's great in City Island), he seems to be fighting to stay on Swinton's level, but ends up snarling and smirking like a bad comic book villain.

We Need to Talk About Kevin is a tough film to endure, not because it's bad but because Swinton's performance is so uncomfortably raw. If there's a reason to see this movie, it's for her.",1332288000,109,3559,4.586477987421383
5074812,5,B007C3TVEY,"Could you stand to have the entire course of your life defined by one horrific act? If so, imagine said act being committed by someone else. In fact, not just someone else, but your own son.

  The film opens on a dream sequence that I struggle to see the relevance of even now and, when it ends, we are introduced to a waking Eva Katchadourian (played by Tilda Swinton). Eva is living in a run-down house that has recently been vandalized along with her car. Rather than report it, Eva (Swinton) merely cleans the windshield and departs on a search for employment. She was once a successful travel writer but has experienced great difficulty finding work since her son Kevin (played by Ezra Miller) took it upon himself to carry out a massacre in his high school. Kevin was a difficult child from infancy, crying incessantly at all hours while Eva's husband Franklin (played by John C. Reilly) is out of the house working. As Kevin grows older, the difficulties only increase. He doesn't speak or appear to understand when others do as a toddler. When he finally does speak, he refuses to be toilet trained. This frustrates Eva till she throws Kevin against a wall, breaking his arm. It wasn't clear, at least to me, whether it was intentional or not, but Kevin claims he fell and returns home willing and able to use the toilet. Franklin (Reilly) is amazed and delighted while Eva is consumed by guilt. When their second child is born, things only get worse.

  Swinton's character is far from perfect, but on some level, the audience sympathizes with her. Both as a mother whose son is clearly more disturbed than her husband is capable of realizing and as the widow being harassed on a nearly constant basis for a crime she didn't commit. Reilly's character is infuriating, but only viewing the problem from Eva's eyes makes it a lot easier to see than it would be for someone spending most of the day outside the home. Prior to watching this film, my only knowledge of Miller's acting was when he guest-starred as the precocious son of a wealthy, absentee father with substance abuse issues on the USA Network show Royal Pains. That character was highly likeable in addition to being entertaining and the total opposite of Kevin which he plays perfectly.",1332115200,2,2259,4.691919191919192
5074813,4,B007C3TVEY,"I just watched this film and it sort of touched me in many ways. It struck a positive note with me for its camera/video/audio/narrative style which was nothing short of simply outstanding. At the same time, however, the film had a truly disturbing, upsetting, revolting and petrifying effect on me with its emotionally and psychologically overwhelming and, I'd even go as far as to say, ""vein slashing"" subject that keeps you both physically and mentally captivated, engrossed, mesmerised and, most of all, simply put, shocked.
It has been the second most unpleasant movie script and subject matter to swallow and digest in my entire film loving experience after the notorious Irreversible (2002). Yet it has also climbed up the ladder to the top of my preference and recommendation list for the quality of its presentation.
Up until today I was having great difficulty understanding, never mind explaining, the concept and meaning of the word ""ART"". From now on if someone asks me for a definition of that word I will just point out this film as one of the most precise, elaborate yet bearably succinct medium towards its comprehension. Certainly not everyone's cup of tea, especially not for the faint hearted. It is, nonetheless, a MUST WATCH !!!",1328572800,3,1249,5.009615384615385
5074814,1,B007C3TVEY,"This is a film in the ""monster baby"" genre. These films typically provide a means by which people can express politically incorrect attitudes toward children and parenthood in a situation contrived to allow it. The film stacks the deck about as far as it can by making the child (Kevin) an irredeemable monster on a path toward monsterhood from birth. The greater his monsterhood, the greater the contrived excessess of his mother the film can wallow in.

The fatal problem of the film is that it mixes a whole kitchen sink of general psychological baggage about parenting up with the problems of having been the parent of a child who has committed a horrible act. Doing either one of these subjects in isolation would have been good. Doing them both together is not so good. And not so good in particular because the one (his being a monster) allows the other (the psychological aspect) to go off without any bounds at all. Of course ultimately horror makes money and serious films dont.

The film is also full of rather heavy handed symbolism. Subtile it is not. Red. Red. Red. Red....

The film is about as nihilist as them come. Guilt and shame in fatal doses covers everything. No shades of grey anywhere. There is also more than a bit of rather mindless man-hatred lurking in the background. Its difficult to know how to look at some of this. Are her memories a real view of what happened or are they the product of revisionism based on guilt?

In the end, its all so emotionally overheated and manipulative that its difficult to take anything serious away from it. It seems mostly an excuse to drown the viewer in negative emotions for a couple hours.",1328140800,13,1658,4.648464163822526
5074815,4,B007C3TVEY,"Lionel Shriver, the authoress of the book on which this movie is based has expressed her total satisfaction with this movie adaptaton. I was glad to have first read the book since imho it encompassed more comprehensively the mental anguish of the mother in conflict with her maternal instincts, or lack of them and the understanding and horror that her son had a twisted side, seemingly only apparent to herself.  Irrespective the movie can stand on its own merits since Tilda Swinton is indeed brilliant in the role of the disturbed, indeed devastated, mother trying to come to terms with her first born's hideous deed. Ezra Miller does well in the role of the psycopathic teenager : nice looking (but so was Ted Bundy) silent, menacing, up-yours attitude. We all hope for the children that we can be proud of but the reality is in birthing them we throw one of life's greatest dices.",1328054400,3,885,4.746753246753247
5074816,5,B007C3TVEY,"I actually watched it three times in a week.

Tilda Swinton as the mother and Ezra Miller as Kevin were absolutely fantastic!! John C. Reilly as the naive father is just ok.

The movie is about the aftermath of Kevin's killing rampage at his high school. The past is interwoven with the present as the mother thinks back on her life and relationship with Kevin. That sentence makes it seem boring but it is anything but. This movie had me on the edge of my seat, all three times that I saw it.

Excellent, chilling, disturbing, haunting, powerful.

5074817,4,B007C3TVEY,"This is a disturbing story of a mother coping with her psychotic son.  From birth, this child was different.  He cried and screamed all the time.  He was mean to everyone and as he grew, his cruelty expanded.  His mother, brilliantly played by Tilda Swinton, does her best to cope.  But she meets one disappointing challenge after another and as the child grows up, he gets worse and worse, demonstrating the epitome of cruelty to all around him, including his little sister.  The father, played by John C. Reilly, refuses to accept his son's dysfunction and even buys him a real bow and arrows.  Ezra Miller plays the role of the son as an adolescent and his performance is nothing less than outstanding and horrifically scary.

The story is told in flashback through the eyes of the mother, and Tilda Swinton's eyes portray all her horror and sorrow as she tries to cope with it all.  She gives an outstanding performance and the sorrow she lives with is like a live and living thing which flows though the film and keeps it melancholy and sad.  From the beginning the audience understands that the child is damaged and that only horror can come from him.

The film is created as an art form.  Much of it is understated and details are never explicit.  This makes it even more upsetting and I left the theater with a feeling of absolute revulsion.  For that reason I stop short of recommending it.  Despite its artistic value, life is too short to let ourselves be so depressed by a film.",1326758400,3,1490,4.569811320754717
5074818,5,B007C3TVEY,"The director has taken a very unusual course here.  One that should be applauded.  Instead of trying to film the best selling book, which is also a five star effort, the screenplay recreates the book as a visual form of expression and storytelling.  It is one of the most visual films I've ever seen.  This also would have been a very hard novel to convert to film if you were going to follow it verbatim as it was entirely a series of letters from the wife to the husband after their son Kevin kills a bunch of kids at his high school. Letters are not used at all in the movie.

Tilda Swinton as the mother has the lead role by a wide, wide margin here.  The others had a bit wider roles in the book but that's ok.  Swinton does an outstanding job and I am sure come Oscar time she will at the very least be a nominee for lead actress. One aspect conveyed in both the book and the film is that the mother and Kevin not only do not bond when he is young, but the mother also has a major case of untreated post partum depression for a very long time following his birth.

Let's face it, when one of these mass murders happens in a school and the murderer is another kid, we all want to find something wrong with the parents to explain it. So do the people in this exclusive suburb and the mother is a pariah post murders. She gets her face slapped on the street, her house spray painted red, and her groceries ruined in the market, as just a sampling of daily life.  Prior to this, she was a wealthy world adventurer and author but you'd never know it afterwards. I'd say it was unbelievable she didn't change her name and move but the remarkable thing is that the parents in the real life cases do tend to stay put.  Both the Harrises and Klebolds are still in Littleton, Colorado, under the same names, for example.

At the very least, one must admit that Kevin is strange. Not everyone can see it, of course, and certainly his father can't at all. Not to put too fine a point on it, he is a pretty disgusting child with absolutely horrendous habits. Many of us would need to be saints in order to parent Kevin. I couldn't do it. Faced with the doting father and this awful kid, I would just get a divorce and gladly give my husband sole custody of Kevin, which he would be only too glad to accept. Although they start moving in that direction when Kevin is in high school, I would have been moving in that direction when he was 3-5 instead.

One odd point is that an extremely good looking young man, Ezra Miller, was hired to play Kevin as a teen. I'm not entirely sure that someone this beautiful could ever be easily be reviled by anyone.  History is replete with great beauty seducing the multitudes.  I've seen Miller before on series tv.  I'm always struck by his exquisite alabaster skin, beautiful bone structure, gorgeous hair and eyes.  It is a bit jarring to jump from the creepy little Kevins to Kevin the gorgeous teen. He also has a wonderful voice  No one else seems to notice this extreme attractiveness.  He was as creepy as a teen as he was as a child in the novel, by contrast. Fortunately, he is a good enough actor to convince you something inside is wrong after you get over the initial jarring effect of seeing him.  Ezra Miller is an excellent enough actor  to convince one over the long haul that he is twisted inside despite the beautiful exterior. I think he is a young actor to watch for the future.",1323561600,31,3429,4.286821705426356
5074819,4,B007C3TVEY,"Kevin is evil.  His mother knows it.  He is not the darling child his father thinks he is.  Kevin  is manipulative. Kevin is a liar.  Kevin is a monster.  Kevin commits a heinous crime against other people's children.  The townspeople do not forgive.  They do not forget.  They punish Kevin's mother.  They throw paint on her house.  Red paint.  They throw red paint on the windshield of her car.  A townswoman punches her in the face as she walks down the street.  Another woman smashes her egg carton in her shopping cart as she is shopping.  Some townspeople throw a brick through her window and throw eggs and garbage in her house on Halloween Night.

one thing i still wonder about: the young children who play such disturbed roles. are these children somewhat, somehow, traumatized through the roles they play? i can not help, but think, that they must be affected! i've tried to place myself in the role of such an Ultimately disturbed character,

Mass school shootings are becoming an epidemic in our country. So much so, all of them don't even make the front pages of newspapers or headlines. Scary, terrifying movie, that will haunt you.

This film certainly raises some questions about whether parenting, or environment can really make a difference.  I don't think it does.

5074869,3,B007C3TVEY,"This movie is a moderately thought-provoking piece about the potential difficulties and ramifications of raising a troubled child.  I didn't know anything about this movie before watching it, and didn't realize that it was based on a book until after viewing it.  As some reviews have stated, the movie tends to jump back and forth in time throughout the movie.  Although I prefer a linear story, this perspective isn't completely bad since it doesn't prevent the movie from making its point.

After watching it for a few minutes, I began to wonder if it was going to be one of those abstract movies which serves no real purpose.  This movie certainly isn't that.  It has a purpose, and it explores a topic which most drama fans may find interesting.  If you enjoy drama, and are a patient audience member, then you'll likely find value in this movie.

If you don't like spoilers, then this is where you should stop reading this review since the rest of it will focus on my frustrations with watching this movie.  I can't talk about these frustrations without mentioning key moments in the movie.

My take, after watching this movie, is that these parents may be partially responsible for what took place at the end of the movie.  What frustrated me most is the fact that Kevin was never disciplined.  He would talk back to his parents, and they merely accepted it.  He would disrespect them, and they accepted it.  He would manipulate them, and they accepted it.  The only time his mother ever did anything in retaliation to his unacceptable behavior, is when she threw him across the room after he willfully crapped his pants.  She shouldn't have thrown him across the room, but she was right to react.  However, even after doing so, she apologized to the child, as if she's the only one who did anything wrong.  I can't help but wonder if the whole tragedy could have been avoided by use of adequate discipline and the right spanking at the right time.

The goal of this movie isn't to shed light on the importance of proper parenting.  Rather, it seems to focus on the notion that some people are born psychopaths.  However, I could have been more challenged, as a viewer, if these parents had at least simply spanked this kid when he needed it.

I do like the fact that Kevin used a bow, in order to kill his victims, rather than a gun.  It allows this movie to focus more on the attacker, rather than the means of attack.  I believe this is where the focus, of such a topic, should remain.  Ironically, earlier in the movie, Kevin reveals that some of his motivation is to gain attention.  So that, too, is thought-provoking -- To seek a solution may be to perpetuate the cause of the problem.",1508889600,,2699,4.594142259414226
5074870,3,B007C3TVEY,Meh. Tilda is flawless like always but the idea of this happening is ridiculious. What are we in the 1500's?,1507766400,,108,4.45

5074872,5,B007C3TVEY,Great movie!,1501545600,,12,5.5
5074873,3,B007C3TVEY,"Kevin is based on a fictional book. However, psychopathology in children is a fact and one that now commands the need for entire facilities dedicated to them. The movie is told in artsy flashbacks which maintains dramatic tension. We have a pretty good idea what will happen but dread seeing how it will go down. The use of the color red in various ways foreshadows the emotional and literal breakdown of the family. However some of the scenes are too vague and disjointed, especially when it comes to why everyone hates the mother so much. The jumping around coupled with the ""folksy"" guitar and vocal country music sound track gets very annoying in parts. The songs were apparently picked for their words, completely ignoring the fact that these were not ""down home"" country music people but a fairly sophisticated urban couple. His occupation is unclear but she is a writer. Tilda even sports a Led Zeppelin T-shirt at one point and the movie starts with a scene suggesting she was a ""hippie"".

 Aside from those issues, it gives a very good picture of the kind of manipulative behavior that someone completely lacking in empathy can engage in.  The spouses quickly find themselves at odds over what is really going on, while at the same time competing to win Kevin's affection. Kevin's ability to triangulate to maintain control of the household and manipulate the truth makes reaching out for professional help too dangerous. We live in a society that is way more likely to snatch a child then question its sanity. The concept that a problematic child is the ""identified victim/ scapegoat"" of a dysfunctional family is firmly entrenched in Social Work texts. In cases like this we end up with families being held hostage.

 I didn't read the book so I can't comment on how well it portrays those characters. It was recommended to me after I shared an article on a facility for these children with a friend. Since I had already been studying the topic, it led me to wonder even more about where these children come from and how the world we live in can accommodate them. There are many professions today that require turning a blind eye to immorality; banking, politics, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, big oil, the military? As long as they don't openly kill anyone in an illegal way...there is plenty of room in American Society for one who has at least minimal self control. And I wonder.... is this a physical brain disorder or a spiritual disorder? If you believe in reincarnation you might ask, is this what takes our place when we decide the Earth is no longer an emotionally viable planet?",1495065600,7,2608,4.786666666666667

5074877,5,B007C3TVEY,"Right after watching this movie, all I can say is that I was silent, for like ten or fifteen minutes. Seriously. I could not manage to entire form any words, or any way of how I felt, because I didn't completely know how I felt. I have a few things to talk about, but otherwise I would recommend you just go into the movie only knowing that it switches from past to present, just so you don't get confused. What is said in the synopsis, doesn't really actually happen until the end of the movie, so just go into it blindly. The beginning is a bit confusing, but don't give up on it is my best advice, it will leave you speechless.

First of all, I think we should mention the beginning. So, I would highly recommend you come back here after you are don't watching the movie, because there will be spoilers.

The beginning was pretty confusing, because everything had to get going and piece itself together. It alternated between past and present, and it took me like two or three scenes to figure that out, but by the time I hadn't missed anything mandatory. This is my only flaw from the movie. It feels like you are just thrown in, but you will get adjusted.

There is so much to say about this movie, but I will try to keep it short and simple.
I have so many questions, so much to think about. Like, was the boy born a psychopath, or was the Mom (Tilda Swinton) partly to blame? I thought it was a very interesting topic that doesn't, in my opinion, get brought up very much in movies or in books for that matter, and a lot of the subject matter in this movie is heavy subject matter. No, nobody literally gets their heads chopped off or anything, and no, you don't actually witness anything like that, just to be clear, it is more psychological, if you get what I mean. It makes you think, and it does toy with your emotions. I think the movie did ask a lot of interesting questions, and I will be thinking about them for a long time. I haven't seen a movie like this or read a book quite like this in a while where I think about it long after I am done, and after just finishing the movie, I think I will be thinking about it for a long time. I wasn't expecting horror, suspense, or any entertainment like that, but rather a psychological outlook on the situation of which is portrayed in the movie.

Overall, the movie definitely made me feel a lot, there was a lot of symbolism, which, is actually quite rare in a lot of the movies I watch. I hope you enjoy this movie, It'll hopefully make you think. Good day and God bless.",1489190400,,2533,4.24896265560166

5074888,4,B007C3TVEY,"Americans are fascinated with criminals, and most films about them either focus on the criminal or on the people who are trying to catch them. With the recent uptake in school shootings, the one element that is often overlooked is the parents and what, if any, their role is in all of this. That is the focus of award winning film, We Need To Talk About Kevin. Kevin (Ezra Miller) has always been an angry, troubled kid, brought up by an upper middle class family. Kevin had a loving family, everything he could ever want, but still orchestrated a horrific mass shooting at his school. Despite all evidence to the contrary, his mother (Tilda Swinton) can't help but think that somehow everything is her fault, and by and large the community agrees. This is far and away one of the strongest performances I've ever seen Tilda Swinton give, and that's saying a lot, because she has always been terrific. Watching this was almost difficult, as one could actually feel her pain and see in her eyes the emotional toll everything had taken on her. She did nothing wrong, but everyone from the press to the owner of the local grocery store, blames her for the actions of her son. The film flashes between before, during, and after the event to show the differences in the lives and personalities of the characters, in a way that I've never seen before, it was really ingenious. This film delves deeper into the heart of darkness and into the eyes of the unseen victims in one of the most powerful films I've seen in years. We Need To Talk About Kevin may even be too emotionally overwhelming for some, but by in large it is one of the hardest hitting and most realistic dramas you may ever find.",1478563200,,1688,4.555921052631579

I wanted an ending where the mother was vindicated and the father destroyed over his inability to trust his wife with regards to the troubling behavior of their son.

It seemed like major plot points were glossed over (such as the eye incident) and you don't really get a feel for Eva or Franklin's individual personalities. (Spoiler Alert!)

  To start with, the scenes were disjointed in a way that made it difficult to follow; it lacked the smooth transitions between the current narration and past events the author successfully created by ""letters"" from the main character.
  The film seemed to be directed by a tourist visiting a strange and foreign country with no grasp of its customs. This approach showed the film's themes  Ramsey so masterfully explored in the book were either ignored or simplified.  Did someone think the audience wouldn't ""get it""?
  The film goes way over the top with imagery; scenery dark and grimy, children trick or treating Halloween night  menacing, co-workers crass, and neighbors hostile.

Both the novel and the movie, which provide a unique study of the causes of personality development, portray Eva as a mother who is struggling to determine the degree to which she is responsible for her teenaged son's actions. The book and film raise questions about how a mother's feelings for her child affect the developing personality, beginning with how she feels about the child before he or she is born.

Obviously with any film, they can really only scratch the surface of any written story or the movies would be 5 hours long.  I enjoyed the book much more and recommend it if you watched the film but felt the story lacked something.  I'm not one to add spoilers so I will say the book provides SO MUCH more details into the strained relationship and just how rotten Kevin was growing up.  This film glosses over a few topics but I felt that it comes across more that the underlying issue is a bout of postpartum depression that interferes with the initial bonding of mother and son.  In the book you get more details that while this was a problem, there were MANY other factors such as a mother's apprehension at even wanting children, her giving up a lucrative career from her own company that she started from the ground up and the fact that young Kevin proved devious and manipulative from his toddler years with much more than a squirt gun.  I adore Tilda Swinton's acting and she portrayed the zombie like aftermath of a woman destroyed by her own creation perfectly. Ezra Miller's role in the movie was also good but along with Swinton-they both have much more talent than this film allowed them to display.  While I recommend the movie, I definitely recommend the book more!  It's a riveting story that gives a look into those who suffer along with the victims families of mass shootings.  We always read the stories about the victims but what about the mother's of these ""monsters""?  Surely their lives have been destroyed as well yet they have the ""luxury"" of stumbling their way through the rest of their lives as the ""mother of the monster"".  Read the book!!!",1466553600,23,1753,4.550955414012739
5074907,4,B007C3TVEY,"It's not your fault. So many folks judge the parenting of others by thinking and saying how they could do it better. I used to be one of them. But mothers know when something isn't right. When your child laughs and twirls the carcass of the beloved family pet over her head at six years old, or at nine jumps on the bed squealing with glee on learning a childhood friend has dropped dead from an aneurysm, you know.  I am the woman in this film. My socio-child is an adult now, a line always on the horizon I finally pulled her over with such relief. There are a lot of films out there about tragic events in our society told through the eyes of the sociopath, or perhaps the police. This is the only one I am aware of that tells the devastating story of the mother.

5074909,5,B007C3TVEY,"EXTREMELY tense! I kept the remote in my hand at all times for parts of the movie which were unbearable. Fellini-esque flashbacks. 100% unsympathetic antagonist.
I did observe a kid like that once. It was a day-care center near my job. Mind you, he was probably 2 or 3. And I've known adult psychopaths.  Recently there is the story about the man thwarted by 3 women after he put a date-rape drug in his ""very best-friend's"" drink. Psychopaths can fool many people with a certain brand of charm, otherworldliness and indifference  or just their Mask of Sanity. It would take a VERY gifted psychologist to penetrate that armor. They have a kid like this on YouTube being interviewed by Dr. Phil that'll give you the chills!!

I think that this mattered for this writer, the novelist--and affected the screenplay, the direction. Cliched filmaking. Red signifying impending doom and murder. So boring. A kid who is either born without a soul, or turned into a monster by a mother who can't give him affection takes his hate out on the world. Blaming the mother is passe and cliched. There is no plot. The evil doer son is a one note cliche. The kind hearted father is a cliche. We all ask where were the parents when a Columbine happens? Why didn't they see their child was the devil incarnate or dangerously murderously troubled? Someone will write that story. This isn't it. Waste of decent and even exceptional actors. Lots of staring. Lots of static shots. No tension. Disrupted timeline to add interest. Everything flows backwards and disjointed. Old trick when there's no plot, no story, no character development.

5074916,2,B007C3TVEY,"I just recently finished the book and was blown away by it. It was a compelling story, and I could not put it down. Part of what made this book so great was Eva's letters to her husband Franklin, which of course were left out of the movie.
The movie didn't even touch on the personalities of the characters. It made Eva seem flat and boring when she is anything but. It made Kevin like a model child when he is anything but. Franklin's character was simply glossed over like an afterthought. Celia did not come across as a sweet, simple, but generally frightened child. She just seemed normal, which she definitely wasn't. And her ""accident""? In the book, I gasped aloud while reading. In the movie, I thought to myself, ""that's it?""
How about the scene from the restaurant when Eva dares to try to bond with her son? To me, that was a very important part of the book. The movie didn't even touch on the best parts of that entire scene.
I realize that not all of the detail from the book could have gone into the movie (such is the case with every screen adaptation), but there really was too much missing for this to be a good movie. As I stated, the letters, Eva's words, are what made this book so spellbinding. The book was an exciting ride, from start to finish. The movie? I nearly fell asleep.

On the surface, both this family and Kevin seemed ""normal.""

5074936,4,B007C3TVEY,"This film is wonderful!!  And no, that does not mean you will get an emotional high from this.  It is dark and unsettling,, and I was on edge throughout much of it, just constantly a bit afraid of what was about to unfold in the next phase of this story.

This film explores what many of us who read or watch news stories have wondered from time to time: Those people you read about who do terrible, horrific things...they are someone's son/brother/daughter/sister/mother/father.  What would YOU do if you suspected that a close family member - your CHILD even - was a psychopath, someone who completely lacked some of the very things that make us human - compassion, remorse and a conscious of any kind.  This film, an adaptation of a novel of the same name by Lionel Shriver , tackles that scenario.

I have to admit that the first 20 minutes or so of this film had me scratching my head.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it, but I really wasn't entirely sure of what was going on.  Stick with it though, and all threads will soon begin to come together.

The film tells the story of Eva Katchadourian (Tilda Swinton) as she goes about a typical day in her hometown after something horrible has happened.  There are plenty of flashbacks all over the place, and again, after a while you'll figure out what you are seeing.  An unexpected pregnancy with the very kind, well-meaning (and not so bright) Franklin (John C. Reilly) produces a son, Kevin.  We get to see the growing relationship between mother and son, and though it is not quite ""Family Matters"" Perfect at first, it seems normal.  And then as Kevin grows, things don't seem to be quite right.

I have not read the book, so I can't compare it to that.  I am sure, as is almost ALWAYS the case, the book is better.  Writers just set a scene and delve into the minds and motives and subtle actions of characters in a way that a film just cannot.  And that's the way it is.  However, I felt that this film is both an artistic expression of a novel AND a mind picking, thinking film.  We all know that if you cross a deranged person with another deranged person (or even cross a deranged person with a normal person), you have a higher chance of producing a Bad Seed, someone who may be prone to bad, extremely narcissistic thoughts, and therefore actions, right out of the womb.  But we've heard about the ultimate Parental Horror Story:  two normal, well-meaning parents produce a person who is Evil Incarnate.  Sometimes the answers can still be found in their upbringing, hidden by the child...or the parents.  Sometimes not.  You will find yourself searching this unfortunate family's history painstakingly, searching for a reason.  Will you find a reason?  Maybe, maybe not.  I think, like a lot of real life situations, it's just not that black-and-white.  But that's my opinion.  You may disagree.

This film was very engaging.  Tilda Swinton does an amazing job as Eva, a once-free-spirited woman who reluctantly settles into suburban family tranquility only to have it slowly morph into the All-American Nightmare.  The film was beautifully shot and intelligently written.  There is a lot of complexity in this story.  Eva is by all means an intelligent, independent, strong and likeable woman.  However, like many of us, for all of her strengths, she is not PTA-Approved Mother of the Year.  You will ask yourself if it would have mattered if she was.

If you are looking for a thought-provoking film on a haunting and unsettling (but seemingly all too common) subject, please check out this film.",1456012800,5,3572,4.675762439807384

First, he is truly an evil and manipulative entity whose only glee comes from tormenting his already semi- ambivalent and ill - prepared mother.  The harder she tries to connect,  the harder he makes it for her. Secondly, in his tv interview he says, pretty much,  that he wants to be famous /infamous.  In doing so and leaving only his mother alive he issues the final never ending blow to the only person he truly hates. The torment she feels after the crime and the pathetic obligation she feels towards him make you stop and think about how you would ever be able to handle her situation.

5074957,1,B007C3TVEY,"Haunting. Absolutely haunting. Like a ghost story or the wind passing through the dead trees. Equally as unimaginative, however, and the plot suffers under the delusion that good acting and jarring screenplay can rescue an utterly unbelievable story.

School shooting. That much you know. And with the hundreds that occur nationally every year, you would think some tenuous connection to reality would be possible -- even if by pure chance. But no, we are left with a SPAWN OF SATAN type of story. One that has never happened, nor anything close to any of the hundreds of stories of school shootings. Read the newspapers. Hell, read wikipedia. You will find that nothing in this film is rooted in even the most bizarre fact, and remember that a homosexual serial killer once dressed as a clown. Perhaps reality is stranger than fiction, but Kevin is not strange, he is silly.

Kevin's purpose seems to exclusively be to torture his engaging mother directly under the nose of his engaging, albeit naive, father. Even the almighty act appears to be literally directed at his mother. It is simply a remarkable story because it is nonsense. Never, ever, ever has such a human existed, and I imagine the prospect would be frightening, if it weren't so utterly ridiculous in its premise. You will finish the movie knowing as much about what motivates Kevin as you do in the first fifteen minutes. Any second rate psychologist or psychiatrist will inform you that no human operates in this manner. And even assuming they do, what is the point of a film that appears to be a character study of a character you can't understand. To some extent, that desire to understand is the point (because the character study arguably examines Kevin's mother). Spoiler alert: she is sad and wants to know why he did it. Sorry to say that could be a character study of all the kids at the school, all of their parents, all of the administration, and really the entire town. Except that a person of that level of direct insight would know what motivated Kevin, except (of course) Kevin's mother, because this story, it simply cannot be believed and you cannot believe it and we will fill seats because you cannot believe it.

I understand that acting is important, and so is shaky screenplay that keeps you guessing as to the timing. Simultaneously confused and feeling smart because you said ""before"" or ""after"" at the right time. I suppose you can keep a large audience engaged simply by flashing blood and murder in their face and stringing them along with literally the slowest, most meager provision of actual fact or development of story imaginable, all because they must experience the blood. Not an audience that I am a part of though. And then, at the very end, you discover that not one scene of the film was difficult to produce. At no point does the director make an effort to display emotion except by following a brilliant actor from defeaningly silent shots. Who is expressing the emotion in that case? Who wants to watch a movie where the director can't tell heads or tails of the story?",1454025600,2,3079,4.751401869158879

5074971,5,B007C3TVEY,"If the Babadook is a supernatural horror film about a mother with difficult feelings about a difficult child, We Need to Talk About Kevin is its unsupernatural twin. ***mild spoiler warning***

At the center of the film is Eva, her name immediately evoking the eternal questions of blame, original sin, nature and nurture. And Eva is no great shakes as the mother of a difficult - from birth - child, about whom she was ambivalent even during her pregnancy. When we meet her at the opening of the movie, she is clearly a person in great pain. And from the beginning of the movie, Eva is awash in red - Lady Macbeth red, red-faced shame, blood on her hands, emergency red. And we learn within moments that the people around her blame her every bit as much as she blames herself for what we find out during the course of the film.

And that next hour and forty minutes, give or take, just piles on the dread and red and sorrow and shame. And more dread. We need to Talk About Kevin does a stellar job of making you feel attracted and repulsed, hopeful and fearful, certain about what's to come but clinging to the possibility that you're wrong. Tilda Swinton disappears into Eva. SHe's why I decided to watch the movie, and by 5 minutes in, I'd forgotten it was her. Evan Miller is a preternaturally beautiful young man, as are the children who play the younger versions of Kevin. John C. Reilly always inhabits the nice guys and delivers reliably here. Of course Eva loves Franklin. Who wouldn't? And of course he is a doting dad.

In terms of story, we see clearly the moments on which the grieving and the guilty would look back. Every potential missed opportunity to change the outcome. And it's just devastating. Especially so, if you are a parent, but you don't have to have any kids for this movie to terrify you.",1452384000,8,1818,4.503030303030303
5074972,2,B007C3TVEY,"For those who have read the book I'll state the obvious, it was a monumental task to turn the novel into a film. Lionel Shriver's story was complex with layers upon layers for each of the main characters and their relationships, but also it was an analysis of our complicated society. In its raw and in your face style it also had subtlety and suspense.

So, yeah, a monumental task. But I wonder why the director and screenplay writer made many of their decisions. Their was little of the subtlety from the book - how much red do we need to see? We get it. We got it before the film started - this is about a high school killer and his mother's doubt and guilt. She has proverbial blood on her hands. No need to splash me in the face with it. The character of Eva came across as much stronger in the book. Tilda Swinton is luminescent as always even in the aftermath but she wasn't allowed to exhibit the power and anger of Eva, only her angst.

Franklin seemed to be an afterthought but the novel was centered around Eva's letters to him as she contemplated their relationship, their parental experience, and Kevin's behavior and acts of violence and hate. He was barely on the screen and with little impact on the story.

Ezra Miller as teen Kevin was toe-to-toe with Swinton. Pretty impressive.

And the choice of bluegrass for soundtrack didn't at all jive with the storyline and the characters.

The book was a revelation. Powerful writing and thought provoking. The movie gave it a good shot but if you've read the book skip the movie. If you're interested in the topic and story read the book!",1451865600,,1601,4.487972508591065

5074976,5,B007C3TVEY,"I read quite a bit of reviews before I even watch movies on here. I am hypercritical of movies because I do not like to waste my time on something that will disappoint me before the end is even reached. That being said, tonight was the night where I decided to watch this little number. I've read both positive and negative reviews concerning this movie.

Let's start off with the negative review concerning the multiple timelines. I'll agree that, that was a bit distracting. At about the thirty minute mark I was considering turning this off because of how disjointed it felt. From what I understand, the book is the exact same way, so at the very least the director has kept to the source material. After having watched this til the end I feel that telling this story chronologically would make it less impacting. If you can stick with it, you'll piece things together and be less likely to be confused.

As for the disgruntled review from (presumably) a teacher, do tell us the combination needed to produce teenager killers. I'm a little confused on how formulaic you think the human mind functions. People kill for different reasons. People are pushed into killing for different reasons. By trying to play psychologist you muddy the film and what it portrays by dismissing what caused this individual to rampage. People aren't special snowflakes but neither are they all the same. Kevin was affected most by his mother as shown in scenes from the past.

It's hard to give love to someone when you understand that you are nothing but a nuisance to them. What should be understood was that Eva lacked the ability to bond with her son. It was apparent from a young age that Kevin wasn't wanted by her. Her frustrations and temperament were taken out on him since he was a toddler. It's no wonder that when he was a teenager she couldn't connect with him. By then it was too late. They had spent his whole life in this tangled weave where both would antagonize the other.

Eva suffers in the present. Scared and alone, she is trying to piece together a life that's broke. Her mundane daily activities makes the realism effective. She is as much a victim as any of the other parents (you know what she lost) but she is treated with scorn. It seems that others hold her accountable as if she was the one locking the doors of the school. Her whole life is left in disarray and she doesn't have a reason for it. Her son couldn't even answer her at the end because whatever the reason was at the time, it is no longer important.

A teenager's scope of understanding is narrow because their life experience is less than that of an adult. What they perceive is a certain length of distance and any obstacle seems to be mountainous. Given time they will understand that there is more beyond what they see and feel. Everything hurts more when we're young. Pain is relative. Why else would teenagers kill themselves? They've barely lived life and they're already ending it.

All Eva has left is her life (that she is trying to repair) and Kevin. Even after what he does she still visits him. She makes a room in her house for him. She endeavors to reach out and attempt to connect with him. In her own way, she loves him in spite of what he has done. Labeling him a monster doesn't feel right. Monster by definition is an inhumanly cruel or wicked person. Perhaps I empathize too much with Kevin to see him as purely black or white. However, his actions are monstrous by definition. Ezra Miller truly makes Kevin a complex, manipulative, and dangerous character. Tilda is haunting with her portrayal of Eva's suffering. There's a reason she won two separate awards for best actress.

This film isn't a hollow exploitation of school shootings. It shows one individual life's build up to it and it shows the damaging repercussions after it. When the credits appeared I was left with my emotions in a bundle and a desire to defend this film. Those who say this film is horrible or a waste of time, did you even watch it?",1451692800,25,4009,4.567454798331015
5074977,2,B007C3TVEY,"This movie is frustrating to watch. There are four timelines (and in some parts of the film, even more) playing simultaneously throughout the film, making the plot overly difficult to follow. From the opening of the film, the viewer is expected to keep track of multiple periods of the main character's life (played by Tilda Swinton), as there are abrupt switches between present and past moments. What's worse is that the entire film is done like this. Because of this, the progression of the son's bad behavior from childhood to teen years is hard to understand. It would have been much better if the events went in chronological order, with maybe just a few bits of timeline switches, so that we could see how the son's personality developed over time. I also didn't like that there was very little dialogue-- just long shots of people's faces, scenery, and everyday objects with music playing in the background. For a movie about an evil son, this was actually pretty boring.",1451260800,,979,4.833333333333333

The events that enfold are horrific and the toll on the mother excellently played by Swinton paints such devastation that I feel may have some basis in reality.  The acting by all is terrific and you get pulled into the story.  At times it looks like the mother-son relationship is growing deeper and filled with the beginning of true love but only to be let down by reality.

There are plenty of categorically ""depressing"" movies that still manage to entertain. While watching this movie, and even now (a few days later), I'm still mulling over unsatisfying it was. I think I was supposed to walk away from it with a lingering sense of ambiguity about who was being victimized and also a lot of philosophical questions/concerns about parenthood in general, but I really only walked away from it feeling SO GLAD IT WAS OVER.

To be as concise as possible: this movie made me feel horrible. I didn't enjoy any artistic aspect of it (narrative, acting, etc.) enough to justify how awful I felt by the time it was over.

The makers of this movie don't just show you this woman's despair; they make you experience it, which is probably why this movie won so many awards. You literally experience her disconnectedness from the world around her, the abysmal emptiness, the hopelessness that comes with the finality of death, and the apathy that follows when there's nothing to look forward to. She is truly depressed and deeply traumatized, such that she can neither cry nor fight. But she keeps putting one foot in front of the other, going through the motions seemingly out of some deep-seated sense of obligation rather than a genuine desire to live. The phrase ""shell shocked"" comes to mind, but she couldn't keep going if she wasn't strong and resilient. I guess there's a place for hope. That a woman in her situation could heal someday.

5075112,5,B007C3TVEY,"Brilliant. With so much mindless Hollywood crapola in theaters and on TV screens (and don't get me wrong, I love entertainment but how many simpleminded superhero movies a year  can you take) , this one actually makes you think. Makes you wonder why some conflicted dysfunctional families manage to raise children who in the face of adversity possess kindness and are willing to overcome their own misfortunes; why seemingly ""normal"" families at times produce monsters responsible for so many atrocities in our world. How far can you damage a child when you attempt to create not an individual, but a tiny copy of yourself, - which a lot of parents do,  - and when that fails, abandon him emotionally ; how much pain can being unwanted cause and what conseqences can follow; can good parenting change a child that lacks empathy to begin with ; how do we  turn out if left to our own devices, how much tryng is too much, is love the only thing that's necessary to raise a humane, sympathetic individual; these are questions all of us should be thinking of, because very often and for many parenting ends with childbirth.

Acting is great as usual with Tilda Swinton. It's a very tragic and depressing story, but not everything should be cheesy and cheery, folks. Strangely, the kid looks so much like one of Tzarnaev brothers, one of the terrorists involved in Boston marathon bombing, that it added to the realistic and creepy factor of the film for me (as if it needed it).",1441324800,3,1474,4.7015503875969

Riley was a clueless, enabling dad who was not supportive of his wife and what made it more interesting was he was consistent. Tilda Swinton tried to make her son appear normal and at times did what a parent should do but was never successful. The son was a master manipulator and clearly a psychopath.

This was despite the fact that I had read the book in 2009 and participated in a lively book club discussion.  Once I had focused in on the fact that the time periods were differentiated by Tilda Swintons hair style, I was better able to follow the action and the suspense escalated very quickly.

Tilda Swinton gives a good performance and I found that the movie script seemed to depict the mother as a more sympathetic character than did the book.  The story centers around the question of nature versus nurture.  Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller, who play Kevin at different ages, both give chilling performances.

5075150,1,B007C3TVEY,"This is probably the second ""hipster"" movie I've seen.  What exactly is a hipster movie?  Well, it has certain elements in common.  First, there's the preoccupation with ""how things look"" over an intelligent plot or good dialogue.  Every shot in this movie calls attention to itself, whether it's necessary or not - dunk Tilda Swinton in a sea of tomatoes, show her staring wordlessly into the camera, focus on a fan blowing the edge of a poster, show a bunch of broken eggs in an egg carton, capture the ""look"" of raindrops reflecting traffic lights.

Do any of these shots reveal anything about the characters, give us any real insight to a character's mind?  No.  It's just a young director showing off, a presumably privileged youngster who lacks experience in the ""real world"" and is trying desperately to prove that, despite his MFA-buffeted life, he has ""suffered"" and can convey that ""suffering.""

The other sign of a hipster movie is the deliberate use of relentlessly cheery, vintage music to underscore a few serious scenes in an ""ironic"" manner.  It's a device that's so obvious and self-important I kept cringing.

If you're looking for a meaningful movie about what motivates kids and parents and explores the complexities of a dysfunctional family, skip this.  The ""edgy"" plot is just an excuse for the director to play with his camera.  The real test of a good movie is to walk out for ten minutes, come back, and see if you missed anything important. I walked away for 30 minutes, came back, and didn't miss anything.",1439683200,,1534,4.812977099236641

The movie relies on anticipation and suspense although the viewer has a pretty good idea what everything is leading up to by the time it actually occurs. I am not sure what the twist is that was referred to in the summary since at the ending the viewer should not be very surprised. The viewer is asked to wait for the last 15 minutes of the film while nothing in particular interesting happens all the while making the ending more and more predictable. This is coming from someone who is usually clueless as to where suspenseful movies are leading. Basically, there is no satisfying payoff for watching 1 hour and 45 minutes of a sociopath's childhood and development and the aftermath which a mother is left to deal with.",1438905600,,841,4.644295302013423

From screaming baby to bloody marksman his sociopathic, apathetic, deviant behavior increases in intensity. Why five stars? Because it went back and forth between the past and the present struggle of ""living with it"", because he was a bane to his Mom's existence only acting like a typical boy when Dad was around, because Eva's life started out happy and adventurous and ended up as being Kevin's final target, because it's well written, has an excellent cast, and -though predictable- it's plot keeps you mentally on edge as you impatiently await what you think happens next.

Multiply that dumbfoundedness feeling by about 5000 and that's how I felt watching this movie. I couldn't keep up I no matter what I tried. I watched it three times and could not make sense of  it.

He seemed to have no concern over the exhaustion of the mom trying to care for their child. She didn't seem to be a part of them as a couple during any portion of the movie except when hubby wanted her for sex. If this is how new movies will be made in the future (esp.

In a hundred little ways, she does penance for her son's actions, and continues to ask the unanswerable question: why? The film doesn't provide an answer to that question, but it certainly makes you ponder whether it is nature or nurture that produces a monster.

First - this is one of the best examples of The Book Is Better that I've ever come across.  If you are one of those poor folks who didn't read the book, and just tossed almost 2 hours of your life away trying to follow the plot of this movie - I'm so sorry.  Read the book - it's worth it.

Second - having read the book, I can't really put into words how disappointed I was with this movie.  I'm relieved that I watched it alone, so I didn't have to constantly explain what the hell is going on to a companion.  I think this movie would be likely unwatchable for someone who didn't already know the story.  Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller deliver solid performances - hence the 2 stars - but they can't save the bouncing storyline - some of the scenes are incredibly short and totally pointless.  And the casting of John Reilly as Franklin is truly bizarre - when he came on screen, my honest thought was ""are they KIDDING????""

5075360,4,B007C3TVEY,"Not every adaptation of a novel is worse than the source material. We Need To Talk About Kevin is one of my very favorite novels of all time, however, and since the entire novel is done in the style of written letters, any director would have a challenge in bringing it, and it's many layers, to the screen. Though I was initially very disappointed in this film, I am a fan of Lynne Raymsy, who also directed one of my all time favorites MORVERN CALLAR, as well as RATCATCHER, which is also great. Her style is intentionally fragmented here, as was the novel, it jumps around in time, interweaving the past and present, that the controlled messy structure may cause whiplash for some. I highly urge any prospective viewer to read the novel first, as if I had not read it many of the events in the film could have been a bit confusing, and would have raised more questions than answers. Even if you do read it before watching, you'll still have questions, as it certainly leaves a lot to the readers/viewers interpretation. The film has indeed grown on me, and I accept it as a solid companion piece to the brilliant novel. Tilda Swinton is as great as ever here, and Ezra Miller is striking as the troubled, to say the least, Kevin. It may leave out many of my favorite moments from the novel, and John C. Reilly is miscast, but this is still an original, psychologically stirring, horror-drama about a mother dealing with the aftermath of her sons horrific actions.

5075368,3,B007C3TVEY,"First, it didn't surprise me even a little, you could tell from the beginning that Kevin was disturbed and that he was going to do something terrible to his family as well as others! Second, though the idea for the film was good, the way they did the film was not! I have always liked Tilda Swinton in movies, even liked most of the movies she's been in that I have seen, but this one, not so much! This movie is way too slow paced, with very little dialogue, especially in the present day parts of the movie! Possible (Spoilers) And realistically I can't imagine any sane person/mother continuing to have any contact with their child after they have hurt other members of their family like her son did, especially seeing as when he treated her so badly from the moment he was born! Oh sure when he was a baby and can argue he didn't know what he was doing, but later on, has even a toddler you could tell he knew what he was doing! My thing is, I have watched many independent movies, and have found some really great movies, but this is not one of them! Some of these indie movies try way too hard to be artsy, which usually makes them slow, with hardly no dialogue and in the end rather boring! I mostly gave this 3 stars because the point of the movie was okay, and I enjoyed the part with the two Jehovah Witness guys, I plan to use that myself next time they or any other people like them ask me that question! Anyway, other then that I can't say I enjoyed this movie, and I can say for sure I won't watch it again or recommend it to anyone! The only good part in it, other then the Jehovah Witness guys, is that they showed that you can kill on mass with more then just guns, that a bow and arrows can be used too! Like many indie films it had allot of potential, but blew it, by trying to be artsy too, just dragged down the whole film, for me!",1430352000,,1852,4.147222222222222

Instead, the things he did as he was a boy and getting older just made u want to spank him if anything. It should have been more stuff that made you say ""I can't believe what I just saw"" or ""Kevin is a monster."" I just bought this at Zia records after the hype from a preview I saw. It costs 22.99 which is outrageous for what I just watched. It should have had me on the edge of my seat and been full of twists and turns. This seemed very careful.

5075459,5,B007C3TVEY,"Nine Things About the Film ""We Need to Talk About Kevin""

1. This nihilistic gut-punch was one of the best films of 2012.

2. It's hard to categorize this movie. You could classify it as horror, in which case this is the best of the ""bad seed"" sub-genre, about a Boy With Problems. But that's not really the focus of the film. I would call it a ""domestic tragedy thriller"".

3. Tilda Swinton gives one of the best best performances of her life as Eva, a mother struggling with the consequences of a terrible event (we are not told at the beginning what that event is), and who blames herself for it.

4. The film is brilliantly told from Eva's point of view. She is so traumatized that her mind jumps between the present moment, fractured memories of past events, and a dreamy depression which presents the worst elements of her horror in lurid symbols.

5. One of the things that sets this movie far above others of this genre is the script. It's so sparse that there are entire scenes where nobody talks. You get everything from facial expressions and body language.

6. Improbably, the ugly nature of the story is actually emphasized by the beautiful cinematography. Almost every scene is a piece of art. Even the bad parts.

7. This movie is not recommended for women who are pregnant or who hope to become pregnant. The movie is excruciating to watch at times, but not because it's bad. It's because it's too painful to watch a mother try to find an explanation for what has been happening to her - or to find hope that her life is not just a black hole of cruel pointlessness.

8. Ezra Miller is a crazygood (yes, crazygood) actor, well known on the indie scene. He was 17 when he made this film, playing the teenage version of the title character. I don't know what allowed him to reach the parts of himself necessary to make this movie, but he got there, and he burned himself into my brain. I know he's broken into the mainstream now, playing The Flash in Batman v Superman and the following Justice League movies; but to me, he will probably always be Kevin.

9. This is a soul-crushing perspective on realistic events. The movie shows you real horror, frustration, guilt, helplessness, and shame. You may need time to recover after watching this one.",1428019200,3,2261,4.535626535626536

Whatever it was - or wasn't - between mother and son, I couldn't stop watching.

I have to wonder why that kid wasn't taken to counseling early on. He clearly had some kind of oppositional defiance disorder. And the dad was so naive. ""That's how boys are,"" just isn't the way to support your wife!

5075479,5,B007C3TVEY,"Eva (Tilda Swinton) is initially ambivalent about motherhood, but once past the infancy of this difficult child, she puts her all into it - albeit one could make the argument that a little more parental authority would have been wise in dealing with this child, instead of portraying her as always acquiescing to the child in hopes of establishing a bond between herself and her son, which never occurs.

The father (John C. Reilly) is not only dismissive of Eva's apparent difficulties, but begins to intimate these difficulties are her fault, as if she is not patient and understanding enough of Kevin.  Not only has Eva's life been turned around 180-degrees since the birth of Kevin, but the father insists on moving from the city (which Eva loves) to the 'burbs, where she is not pleased to be, but she adapts.  He then constantly rebuffs her complaints about the difficulties with Kevin.

He also initially buys Kevin the equipment for Kevin's hobby, which any parent with any brains would not do (in this case you need to watch the movie), and the result is as expected.  Again, Dad says the result of this hobby was an ""accident,"" and Kevin is not to be blamed.

Toward the end of their marriage, it appears father makes the decision to divorce and suggests (without apparently discussing it with Eva) that custody is already obviously decided.

Eva has given and given to the wishes of her husband and danced on her head for her son.

The problem is, this is NOT a normal child.  I know this film generates a lot of discussion of nature/nurture and seems to point the finger at Eva, but for anyone who has dealt with a psychopath/sociopath (a term not used in the DSM V or earlier), it is obvious that this is a loose screw and a bad seed, lacking empathy.  Indeed, psychiatry seems to be leaning toward a genetic component in this, though that is not entirely settled.  For more information on psychopathy, see Hervey M. Cleckley during the 1940s, and more recently, the seminal work of Robert D. Hare, who developed the PCL-R Psychopathy Checklist, which is used across the United States, and I believe in the United Kingdom and other places.  Then ask how Kevin would do.  (You can find some of the questions on the internet).

As far as the ending of the movie, I feel it sets Eva up for being murdered in the future.  If she lacks maternal feelings, the ending belies that fact by the way her son suckers her back into his sphere, implying the mother/son connection is at last made.

Excellent film.  Excellent casting.  Excellent photography.  A seamless piece well worth watching.",1427414400,,2595,4.688741721854305

Fast forwarding would've only made the movie better. The parents were sad (as in unresponsive to the son's out of touch with reality behaviour) and the father was especially blind.  I'm going to have to read the book, as one person suggested, in order to redeem myself from watching this film of torture. It really didn't make too much sense to me as to why the mother would allow him to return (Spoiler sorry but then again...) and oh well, I'll just read the book and then maybe I can get better clarification about it like I did with ""Gone Girl.""

She knew what was going to happen and knew he would keep her alive because it would hurt her more, yet she's completely helpless to stop it without becoming the same monster her son is.  They are all doomed the minute he's born.  And they look to her....hold her responsible for his rejection of all social normalcy including his obvious hate for her, the total blindness of the father, the torture of the daughter.  The dread is present from the birth....the hopeless, fear-induced dread....she sleepwalks through the nightmare that her life has become, trying to get help but without telling her real fear....she cannot accept or verbalize what she feels, knows and when she tries, she is poo-pooped, patted on the head, told to try harder, love more, be more understanding.  She already understands more than a mother should ever have to.

I found this story absolutely terrifying and mesmerizing in that there are too many monsters let loose on the world.  Monsters that may, or may not be recognized by one or both parents.  This kid knew that, though she knew him, feared his capability for cruelty, that she would never abandon him....No matter what.  Dysfunctional?  What a term.

The most honest reaction she had landed him at the emergency room and her on the abusive parent list....a cringing apology that made me yelp.  Was this thing a scathing statement against the parental practices of today?  Kind of like the A-bomb horror movies of the 50's?  Let the little monster develop with his own agenda at the risk of, well, anyone?

I don't know who was the worst, the mother that didn't drown him, or the kid who tortured, mutilated, and killed?  Or, am I the monster?  Just how do you spell ""monster"", according to this movie?  Spell me,""depressed and terrified"".",1425254400,,1838,4.950980392156863

5075641,5,B007C3TVEY,"I didn't kniw what I was getting into when I started watching this. In some ways, it's in the same story space as other films with demonically possessed children. Damien Omen comes to mind. One difference here is that it's not all about the child and the evil things he does. It's really about the mother and her journey from a happy love affair that becomes a happy marriage and turns into a nightmare as she deals with this baby boy who is never happy with her. No magical supernatural powers here, just brilliant deceit. The child grows more and more savvy in how he manipulates others and disguises the traps his mother falls into of over and over. Smiling around his dad, he presents another face to his mother. Unlike many of other similar stories, there is no tidy end. The boy is not destroyed in a final battle between good and evil. The mother is not killed in a spectacular explosion. They both live on through the events that occur. She still tries to reach him as he refuses to respond in kind. I enjoyed this less than happy film for the efficiency that the mother shows in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. She often looks like a victim, but slowly reveals a hidden strength. Very well written, directed and acted. Well worth watching, when you are ready for a not-happy family film.",1425081600,,1312,4.563559322033898

The book was a bit dragged out and did not show Kevin's perspective as well as the movie did, but the book handled the portrayal of Kevin's character better. The movie made him an evil ""character type"" rather than a believable person.
I read the book and watched the movie because I wanted to better understand what made people that did these sorts of things do what they did. And I was curious to know if the parents were truly missing signs that things weren't well with their child, simply too wrapped up in their own lives and unaware, or if these types of people could behave so differently at home that the parents would be unaware.
I didn't really gain the insight I was looking for, but I did come to believe that perhaps when you are in such a situation what you perceive as normal becomes very warped.",1425081600,,908,4.410714285714286

5075685,4,B007C3TVEY,"This movie was disturbing and heartbreaking on so many levels. The ending was a foregone conclusion, but I was still shocked. Even though there was essentially no optimism or hope in the story, I was still held in suspense as the story unfolded in a sequence of flashbacks and present tense scenes. As the movie moved toward its inevitable outcome, I was riveted by Eva's emotional turmoil leading up to the horror to come, and then her stony, single minded existence in the aftermath. The tender quiet love she enjoyed with her husband, contrasted stunningly against the mercurial relationship with her sociopath son. Kevin's escalating acts of violence, explained away, or outright denied by his father, were taken as a personal sign of failure of maternal love on Eva's part. If she could love Kevin better maybe she could somehow reverse the tide that was carrying herself and her family inexorably toward tragedy.

5075760,5,B007C3TVEY,"If you are the sort of person who enjoys a literal, linear or loquacious movie, I imagine this film is not for you.

Of these points, the first is the most salient for me. Like many great films, there are multiple stories being told here in various forms, and only the most vacuous will be observable if viewed in a literal fashion. Yes, this is partially the story of a profoundly disturbed individual whose predilection for macabre forms of manipulation moves all the characters forward towards a mind-shattering act of evil...  but there is so much more happening under the surface. Unfortunately most of the reviews I've read fail to notice any deeper subtext, and are content to accept the absurd notion of a PURELY EVIL PERSON (!!!) as the crux of the film. If ""Kevin is Evil!"" is all you glean from this film, please let me let you in on a little secret: The world is a great deal more complex than that. The susceptibility of people to pathologize the fearsome otherness of those who are not psychonormative tends to say more about the person passing judgment than the object of their accusations.

In my estimation, Kevin is not an evil person, but the archetype of evil itself. He is the dark reflection of Eva's (his mother's) psyche, her Animus. If you'll forgive an over-simplified explanation, nobody in the world is purely good or evil. Everyone has within them the capacity for both nurturing, constructive, empathetic action as well as neglectful, destructive, hateful action. I think this is a figurative story of an emotionally sheltered person who was forced to confront the darkness within herself. As Nietzsche said, if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss will gaze back. This dichotomy is illustrated frequently throughout the film, often simply be placing Eva and Kevin opposite one another, staring silently but knowingly at one another.

That is hardly the totality of the story though. There are many motifs that beg for interpretation. For instance, the unsettling staring between Eva and Kevin is juxtaposed to the dull glaring of ignorant outsiders. The color red is deeply tied to Eva's trauma, and is finally washed from her home and car the day she finds a moment of something like catharsis to her pain. Her car is the same color of yellow as the locks Kevin uses later in the film--perhaps to communicate her inability to escape the consequences of Kevin's willpower? A poster extolling the virtues of PRIDE and FOCUS hang on the door to the gym, ironically the place Kevin's superior pride and focus compel him into a heinous act.

These are only a few of the elements I noticed upon my first time watching this movie, and I'm sure there is a good deal more to be observed. We Need to Talk About Kevin may not stand on a pedestal quite as high as films by someone like Kubrick, but if you enjoy film analysis or have a penchant for Jungian psychology, then I would say this movie has quite a lot to offer you.",1423785600,3,2944,4.6976744186046515

Young Kevin (Jasper Newell) learns at an early age how to manipulate his mother, and any situation hes in. John C. Reilly gives an excellent portrayal of Evas oblivious husband, Franklin.
Director and writer, Lynne Ramsay, continually bombards moviegoers with thought provoking situations. While taking a walk with Kevin, Eva stops amid the chaos of New York City, preferring the drowning sounds of a jackhammer to the cry of her baby.
By age 5, Kevin enjoys tormenting his mother by not allowing himself to be potty trained.  After having his diaper changed, Kevin stands and immediately defecates again.  At her wits end, Eva throws him against the changing table, breaking his arm.  She is distraught with guilt while waiting for the doctor to cast Kevins arm. To add to her agony, the nurse at the hospital praises Eva for having such a wonderful son.
Evas relationship with Kevin continues to strain after the birth of her daughter, Celia, played by Ashley Gerasimovich. Kevin seems excited to have another person in his life to torture.  Although its never directly shared with the viewer, one can come to the conclusion that Kevin disposed of Celias beloved hamster in the garbage disposal.  Eva perpetuates their dysfunctional relationship by not confronting him about this situation.  Instead she feeds her daughter a fairy tale about her pet living freely in the garden.
Franklin chooses to blind himself to the reality of the situation.  He continually excuses Kevins behavior as simply, being a boy (2011).  Franklin introduces Kevin to archery, which seems to give Eva some relief from her sons constant aggression toward her.  Neither Franklin nor Eva could have imagined the horror that would come from his skill.
As difficult as it is to watch unfold, this psychological thriller is an excellent example of the age-old question of Nature vs. Nurture.  Ramsey does an excellent job of letting the viewer come to his own conclusions of why Kevin is so uncomfortable in his own skin.",1423267200,,2246,5.04054054054054

5075769,2,B007C3TVEY,"Spoilers: They never talked about Kevin. They never talked about anything.

This movie irritated me because I couldn't relate to the mother at all. That's not how you interact with children. You hold a baby close, you talk to it. You talk too much. You talk until you are blue in the face. She never talked to him. You tell them NO! when they do something wrong. She never punished him, she just eventually loses her temper. I also feel these children acted too young for their age. I think they were trying to make her and all the mothers of children who end up going on a rampage like this seem like victims, and to some extent I did feel that for her.  I did find this to be an interesting and unique perspective for a movie. Over all this movie was poorly delivered.

5075772,2,B007C3TVEY,"Considering how amazingly dysfunctional this kid was from day one, there could have been some reflection of real world activity surrounding him, other than Mother's exasperation. But that would make it a more relevant movie about its sadly topical subject, mental illness in youth.

It doesn't take long though to figure out the writer and director were not interested in anything but showcasing Tilda Swinton, and the atmospheric background of a PTSD life in dreamscapes, nightmares, and flashbacks. Tilda's okay, but she wasn't given a script that asked her to do anything but look shell shocked the whole time. Her face on the promo picture is what you get for two hours. It wasn't her fault. The material wasn't there. Ezra Miller, as Kevin, had more of a stretch, but again, mostly in facial expression.

Three different screenwriters, including Lynn Ramsay, the Director, were apparently determined to keep dialogue at bare minimum for the sake of their concept of atmosphere first. I say its lazy writing, boring, and frustrating. Get some chops, people, and write some damn profile development based on characters actually talking about things beyond a sentence or two.

Kevin is, at first, a psychological study of violent dysfunction in youth, and the parental casualties that follow in its wake. I wish it examined, or at least acknowledged, in some way beyond a few brushing glances, the huge questions of causes, treatments, and consequences of these sad lives. It didn't, and that reduces the film to a formulaic retread of yet another bad seed story.

I suppose for what it was, it was done competently, with a fair measure of tight suspense, and shiver inducing direction of this really messed up kid's character, but that's all there really was.

Something in me trusts Swinton will have seen something substantive. I don't know why I believe that, but it feels true. That said...
This is a creepy film. Dubbed: Psychological Thriller, it fails on the thrill part. I was not in suspense. It was rather like watching something one knows is going to be horrible but can't turn away.

Perhaps the intrigue is how Swinton's character deals with, or doesn't, her insane son who appears to hide his nature from everyone but her. Half the story is told in reverse as we watch a woman try to put her life back together after some unknown catastrophe. The other half  is told through flash backs that start at the beginning. Two timelines that inevitably collide. I kept wondering why she not only didn't talk about Kevin but why she wasn't screaming about Kevin, and that's where Tilda earns her title as an actress, not in words but in expression and action. The only semi-surprise is what  Kevin does that brings everything to a screeching halt.  It will hold your attention even when you don't want it to.
Kevin played by Ezra Miller does a good job at creepy maybe too good. John C Reilly, a well-known character actor, plays the oblivious husband; one wonders how he could be so oblivious.",1421625600,,1407,4.5936254980079685

Nature vs nurture... from whence rises the psychopath?

5075797,4,B007C3TVEY,"This is an heroic attempt to address the unpleasant topic of poor parenting and juvenile antisocial behavior; the sort that leads to tragic news headliners.

Unfortunately it's too full a plate and nothing is properly addressed.
It's too easy to say the father is ""clueless""; in my mind both he and his wife are mired in a self  imposed bubble of denial; partially because of the child's age (he'll grow out of it sort of thing) in addition to the relentless pressure they're both under because they simply don't know how to cope.
We also are witnessing the mother dealing with the consequences of her sons crimes years down the road.

We are not given to any coherent explanation as to the child's behavior (other than mental illness), but perhaps this is too simplistic.
It brings back nightmarish memories of HS students gunning down the classmates or turning to terrorist activities.

we need to talk about Kevin but we also need to address a myriad of other factors that contribute to the nurturing of a damaged personality that is either unable (incomprehensible/inability to recognize the importance of conscience, the concept of right vs wrong) or unwilling (willful disregard for but with full understanding of moral standards) to accept and be guided by socially acceptable attitudes.

This is far too complicated a task for any one psychologist or film maker to take on with an appreciable degree of insight and accuracy to reach a satisfactory and conclusion.

While I applaud the directors bravery and the finesse of the actors this was far too ambitious a project; however having said that, I am especially grateful to the actors for their extraordinary skill in navigating such difficult material.

It is obvious that this woman has downsized - but why not just move to another town or back home where she clearly has a mother?  Well apparently she is punishing herself and the movie punishes you (the viewer) too.  If you have seen any indie movies, you already know what type of film-making to expect.

5075938,5,B007C3TVEY,"This was a very difficult film to watch but I persevered and in the end it was well worth it.  I have become an ardent fan of Tilda Swinton and this film just set that in stone.  Her performance here is perfect--exactly what it needs to be.  I was tormented by the two main characters, the mother and her son and how their interactions played out over the years and why they behaved as they did.

The opening scene was quite out of place and disturbing though it seemed innocent enough.  It seemed to be such a strange place to begin this story.  I struggled at first with the frequent time shifts.  About half way through the movie I realized that the mother's hair style was the key to the period in her life that was being shown.  So here's a tip for you:  long hair is when she was a young free spirit; short hair is when she was a new mother; and shoulder length hair represents her as an older mom up to the present day.  I think the time shifts were done in a jerk/yank style to disturb the viewer and it works very effectively.  You are always a bit on edge--as you are meant to be.

The father seems clueless to what is going on though it is hard to believe that over the sixteen or seventeen years depicted in the film that he could have been so blind, so very out of touch with the reality of his family's life.  He remained ever the optimist and the incredibly  clueless.

I watched this movie at least six times and I can't stop talking about it to anyone who will listen.  I highly recommend it if you are a true movie lover with a thoughtful mind and appreciate truly sterling performances by the cast.",1419897600,,1617,4.2182410423452765

Was it because of her alienation that he became a mass murderer?  Nurture then - or did she see something evil from the start that suggested origins in nature?  Considering the title of the movie, neither parent EVER did talk about Kevin - the ONE time she suggested he had blinded the daughter, it led to HER needing help...

5075979,4,B007C3TVEY,"Upfront: this is not a feel-good movie. There is no lesson to be learned, and very little redemption.

There are, however, fantastic performances from Tilda Swinton, John C. Reilly and the boys who play Kevin as he grows up.  The first section of the movie is a bit abstract, with fragments of memories from the past interrupting the current experiences of Swinton's character.  If you're paying attention, you will be able to discern the movie's ending (at least the broadest events) during this section.  The story soon crystallizes into a more coherent narrative, and the memories and flashbacks start to build a clear picture of an imperfect mother's relationship with her troubled son.

Lynne Ramsay's direction puts us squarely inside the mother's head as she tries to create some normalcy in her life. We see her day to day routine and how her memories color her efforts. Certain images and sounds repeat seemingly without reason, but all is made clear by the end.",1419638400,,971,4.932515337423313

The fact that you actually have to watch her hair in order to know the chronology kept me out of the flow of the story. Wait, there was no flow.

What really struck me as off-base was how the protagonist was so abused by the community in which she lived when she was a victim, too.  Even in a backwater town (and this is Connecticut people, there IS no backwater....hello!), hard to buy that people would treat the mother of a killer as though she were the one who pulled the trigger herself.  And if that were that case, why wouldn't she move? Also, why would she stick by her evil child after all of it?  I really wanted to smack her, smack her husband, smack the idiot residents of the town who acted like 5 year-olds.  Honestly, there was not one character in this movie I cared about (well, maybe the little girl...)

I don't think the filmmaker had a very clear idea of what she was trying to say here, and I felt like I wasted my time and energy watching it.  I'm a huge Tilda fan, but can't figure out why the hell she agreed to be in this film.  Nor why it received any accolades at all.",1419292800,5,1039,4.26530612244898

5076093,5,B007C3TVEY,"This powerful story speaks greatly to the question of nature or nurture.  To my mind, there is no pat answer  both nature & nurture play primary roles in a childs emotional development.  In this story, we see a lethal combination of psyches  There is the son who, IMO, has antisocial leanings from birth  which, unfettered, in time, cascade into increasingly sociopathic behavior w/ his mother as his (first) prey.  There is the mother who, psychologically fragile, lacks sufficient self-esteem & parenting, indeed, people skills, to, literally, stand up to her precociously manipulative young son.  Nor has she the capacity to assert her distress to her husband or other providers (e.g. doctors) re: her sons disturbing behavior  All whom she, albeit timidly, attempts to relate her experiences w/ her son to are dismissive, invariably dubious & offer no support.  Theres the father as well who is   by all intents and purposes - oblivious to the torments his wife is experiencing w/ their son  He, too, lacks confidence in his spouses reporting of her sons behavior as he, too, is manipulated by their son.

No disaster nor tragic event occurs in a vacuum. There are always many factors involved which all transect at a finite moment in time  It is then that we public, having a myopic view of the event & persons involved, often jump to woefully uninformed conclusions about persons who, until that time, we had no in depth, if any, knowledge of their existence much less their circumstances.

The acting, by all, in this film is phenomenal.  Tilda Swinton in particular - is, by far, one of the bravest & most talented actors I am aware of.  I have a great deal of respect for her professionalism & talent. She doesnt shy away from demanding roles like this one.

People are always gonna be born with an pre - disposition to violence, or whatever the case may be... and people will always find a way to murder other people... it's just life.

The actors do a splendid job of each role the family plays in the before and after of trying to raise such a child and live with the aftermath and judgment of the community around you.

5076225,3,B007C3TVEY,"WNTTAK for short is a story that is close to the heart of many parents and family and friends who with have been involved with rasing or in a friendship/knew with troubled children or sadly been a victim of one. This story is about Eva (Tilda Swinton) who knew from infancy that her son Kevin (Ezra Miller) was ill. She tried to convince her husband Franklin (John C. Reilly) and her sons doctors that something was wrong with him, but everyone was either in denial or never spent enough time with this very bright, but deceptive boy to notice his mental state of mind.
The story jumps around quite a bit between various time frames of the story and for me really didn't start making a whole lot of sense until about 30 minutes in the story. Then things start to make some sense, but I didn't really like the method the director and writer used to tell their story. I got the mothers sense of being &$^# and )@%*!#&&#$&& ( I don't want to give her feeling away and spoil it for you) from the tone of the movie. I just am not a big fan of this style of story telling.
The acting is very good by the core of lead characters and particularly from Swinton, Miller and Newell and Duer (Kevin at 6 to 8 and as a toddler ). Thses young actors did a great job at all three stages of Kevin's life.
You may or may not like this method of story telling, but it will most likely of left you with some idea of how a mother of one of these  children (never mind what she could have or should have done) must feel after such a horrific turn of events. Swinton displays the full range of emotions throughout the movie in plain sight for all to witness as she tries to go on with her life.
The movie has some mild violence, cursing including the Fword and a couple of sex scenes with partial nudity and child abuse in one scene, (not shown) but the after effecs are shown.
This type of story first rocked this country after the Columbine tragedy and the media blitz that followed. This by no neans was the first time this had happened, but it was the first time that the media overwhelmed us with its coverage.
I would have rated this 4 stars for the subject matter, but the way the story is told it looses a star for its first 30 +- minutes of viewing.",1418342400,,2236,4.212121212121212
5076226,4,B007C3TVEY,"I can see how the book must be gripping - despite recommendations to the contrary, I watched this prior to reading the book.  I liked the way this movie was filmed.  It reminded me of a Chuck Palahniuk book in that you're not sure if you like any of the characters, but the storyline is so intriguing that you keep following them just to see what happens next, with a perverse curiosity.

The only thing I didn't like was that everyone was so mean to the mom, when in reality I think people would be much more compassionate.  I mean, they weren't the only ones who lost loved ones.  I didn't understand why Eva was treated so harshly by the community and I really wanted the movie to tie that up.  Maybe the book has the answer to that.",1418256000,2,736,4.258992805755396

5076310,3,B007C3TVEY,"The film was well-cast and produced, and the story is standard fair. Mixing up the timeline in a movie, with a by-the-numbers story, has become a bit of a gimmick that extends the mystery artificially. ""Kevin"" has an ambience to it, and parents of young innocent kids will have the appropriate heartstrings tugged. I found the rags to riches aesthetic as the result of timeline distortion, and overall art direction of the film more interesting than its overall premise.

There is a point in this film where the plot, more or less completely unfolds, maybe halfway through. We need no further explanation as to the nature of Kevin, or what is going to transpire, but it seems as though we get an extra 45 minutes of it. The asynchronous unfolding of events, at that point, becomes an unnecessary nuisance. There were a couple of roles, both the professional but oblivious to the point of incompetence father, and wicked from the womb kid, that are archetypal to the point of cartoonish, but they were performed well enough.

***vague spoiler alert***

As for the climax itself, I have a hard time believing he could pull that off, so to speak.
The last line of the movie created one of the better endings I've seen in a while---always the manipulator. Was the kid intended to be of exotic origin (possibly following events around the tomatofest) to imply additional guilt for an extramarital pregnancy? He looks that way.",1417824000,,1421,4.815573770491803

5076349,4,B007C3TVEY,"The movie is shown largely in flashbacks which are not shown completely chronologically and therefore at first seem disjointed. I did not care for this style to start with, for about the first twenty minutes it was hard to figure out what was happening because it was jumping around so much with no real explanation. However in the end it does seem to be the appropriate way of telling this story because it is the story of a psychopath and his mother. The jumping around in the storytelling gives the movie a bit if psychotic feel which in the end helps set the mood for the overall story.

I should point out here that the movie itself never calls Kevin a psychopath, in fact since he is under 18 throughout the movie I do not believe such a diagnosis would be clinically appropriate despite his behavior. Furthermore during the movie, up until ""the incident,"" only his mother seems to think there is anything wrong with Kevin, his father is in complete denial. After ""the incident"" it seems that everybody (including his mother) blames his mother.

Indirectly this movie addresses several topics, most notably a mother's love for her son, a mother's responsibility for her son's actions and a mother's feelings of guilt for her son's action.

Ezra Miller was incredibility believable as the psychopathic Kevin, and Tilda Swinton was excellent as the mother who saw the problems and struggled with it even as her husband refused to believe anything was wrong. I was also struck with how much Ezra and Tilda looked like they could be mother and child, the casting director did an excellent job casting these two for the parts.

The Blu-ray, which is the format I purchased, has several extras. The one I found most relevant was the twenty-seven minute ""Behind the Scenes of Kevin."" In this feature the actors, director, director of photography and producers discuss the movie and the making of the movie. The most relevant part of this feature in my opinion was that the actors, directors, etc. may have been trying to place more of the blame on Kevin's mother due to her not wanting a child to start with. I did get that she seemed unenthusiastic about the pregnancy but did not see that as a major factor in Kevin's problems.  I have not read the book, perhaps the book made more of this issue, but I do not see it as a problem for the movie that this did not come across as they intended.",1413590400,3,2392,4.632075471698113

5076366,3,B007C3TVEY,"After reading the book I immediately wanted to watch the film.  I'm used to slow, drawn-out films and honestly find them the most compelling.  The movie was good, but I wish it had more daring scenes in it to really draw the point home.  Kevin, played in three stages of his life, is a very disturbed child.  Eva, his mother, tends to deal with it in a mild, head-down manner.  Kevin's father thinks he's the greatest and smartest boy in the world and Eva feels like she's fighting an up-hill battle.

The movie leaves a lot of things open-ended where the book doesn't.  I think that, of course as all things in life, the book is better.  However the movie is a very strong film and it is worth watching at least once.  That being said, I don't think I would watch it again.  Tilda Swinton played her roll amazingly well.  Her character was so well cast that it is haunting.  Ezra Miller (also well cast) is a great actor, after seeing ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and then this, his skills are so beyond what he gets credit for.

I gave 4 stars because I kept wanting Tilda's character to take that baby to the doctor to see if something was wrong WHY was he screaming so much ?....And then as a toddler and little boy...so hateful. But she didn't seek help from a pediatrician or from a counselor for herself......Why ?
This movie almost immediately had me thinking of the 1956 movie Bad Seed.....
Altho' in Bad Seed we learn that the evilness has only come from 2 generations previous to the very young killer in that......
So I will plug ""Bad Seed"" here.

5076382,5,B007C3TVEY,"This is the story about a mother who ""wants to talk about her son Kevin"" but ends up talking exclusively about herself. As in the book, the movie focuses on the mothers's viewpoint. What she feels, what she endures, what she did or did not do etc. What the kid needs or feels is never evoked.
This is a sad story when no one talks to anyone else in reality. The two parents seemed to be blind to the people around them, even their own children. Taken by their own lives, their own problems surely.
This is a story where love does not seem to be very present, or regarded as bothersome at best.

It is a shame, because Kevin is a very sensitive little boy and loves her mother madly. She is his universe. Like all little children, he is craving for endless cuddles, kisses and joyful games with her. Instead of being a real mother, she plays the teacher with him. She forces him to count, to throw the ball, to say Mummy. When all he is asking with his look is ""take me in your arms"". But she never touches him, never embraces him, never smiles at him and tell him she loves him. She just stares at him with her terrible, cold and puzzled look.
Hatred is a wound that became infected they say. How true.

At the end of the movie, long after the tragedy has occurred, mother and son finally start to talk at last. She asks him why he did all this. He reveals he likes a wound on his forearm, he likes the memory of her breaking his arm in a fit of anger such a long time ago - because that was the only time she was a mother to him, acknowledging him, touching him. They finally embrace each other in a very emotion-charged scene. End of movie.

Of course, not all love-starved kids will turn into mass-murderers (that would definitively solve our demographic time-bomb), but just in case, I engage all parents to rush to their kids now, give them a good cuddle, and tell them how beautiful they are and how much they love them.

5076391,3,B007C3TVEY,"**Spoiler alert**

Ultimately, I was disappointed in this movie, because of the lack of resolution. I understand what was driving at - ""sometimes there is no why"" - but it didn't fulfill me.

Tilda Swinton is Eva, the titular Kevin's mother, who is trying to come to terms with her son's crimes. Through a series of flashbacks, we see her meeting Kevin's father, having a job she enjoys and then eventually giving birth to Kevin - who is a difficult child. Mother and son have difficulty bonding, although there is nothing overtly wrong. A daughter follows, and this deepens the divide between mother and son. Interspersed with this build up, we see Eva visiting her now grown up son in prison, and treated badly by the townspeople for her son's undescribed crime.

And this where the movie falls down.

In the  final reveal, we see that Kevin has killed his father and sister, and then set about massacring his classmates with a bow and arrow. This in itself, isn't my issue. My issue is this; Eva finally confronts her son, as he is about to be moved from juvenile to adult prison. Kevin tells her that he used to know why he did it... but now he's not so sure.

And that's it.

I know that this movie is based on Lionel Shriver's We Need to Talk About Kevin, but it felt like it was borrowing heavily from Stephen King's ""Rage"" (when he was writing as Richard Bachman) - where a student takes his class hostage for reasons that cannot be articulated. I wanted more from this movie - is Kevin mentally ill? Has his relationship with his mother pushed him to this? Is he just evil?

5076396,5,B007C3TVEY,"The first time I watched this movie it was before I'd read the book (same title). To be honest, I was lost for the first 10-15 minutes of this flick (the opening scenes were especially confusing) -- but holy cow, am I glad I hung there. I love me a good dark-and-twisted flick that is packed with intensity, character-development, and superb acting, and if you feel the same way then this movie definitely fits the bill. But if you're looking for lighthearted entertainment or a feel-good drama, then you should pass.

Okay...with that disclaimer out of the way, allow me to further ""wax poetic"" on the virtues of this film.

Kevin (superbly acted by Ezra Miller) is a deeply, DEEPLY, D*E*E*P*L*Y (did I say deeply?) disturbed youth. His mother (played equally superbly by Tilda Swinton) is a highly successful travel book writer who struggles to understand/accept/love her son in what proves to be an increasingly difficult endeavor as he grows on film from newborn to toddler to adolescent to teen. (And by the way, the child actor they cast as the young Kevin is a drop-dead ringer for the teen Kevin and is so evil and menacing in the scenes with mom Tilda that it gave me goosebumps -- truly evoked the feel of ""Damien"" in ""The Omen"" but sooooo much more effectively).

One of the challenges of the film is its structure -- frequent and unannounced flashbacks (covering 2 time periods) and flash-forwards to the present can be a bit confusing (especially if you haven't read the book). But here's a tip: watch for the mom's (Tilda Swinton's) hair length -- when it's long, that's a flashback to the distant past (her early courtship/marriage to Kevin's father -- played by John C. Reilly -- who got mixed reviews for his role in this but I thought he was EXCELLENT). When her hair is super-short, that's a flashback to the more recent past (including her pregnancy with Kevin, which she feels ambivalent about, and her mothering of Kevin from infant to teenager). When her hair is mid-length, that's the present-tense for the movie (it serves as the ""after"" for the movie, but I can't go into more details about the ""after-what"" without including movie spoilers).

Kevin's dad (John C. Reilly) remains blissfully unaware of any problems or issues regarding his son Kevin, despite his wife's (Tilda Swinton) increasingly urgent feeling that something is very, very wrong with their son.

The movie swirls around the classic ""nature or nurture?"" argument given when youth go awry, and it is a very compelling drama that will leave you guessing until the end.

After I read the book (by Lionel Shriver, which was also excellent), I watched the movie again and enjoyed it even more the second time around.

This is not a movie for children and it is not a movie for the faint-of-heart. But if you appreciate chilling dramas with Oscar-calibur acting then this film will stick with you long after you watch it the first time and you'll probably want to watch it a 2nd (or even 3rd) time.

5076400,3,B007C3TVEY,"This is a film with excellent acting, well done. The mother and the son are especially good. If taken as a horror film it works very well.

The idea of the 'bad' child, 'born bad' etc. is really just a way to protect us from being fully aware of the existence of child abuse and neglect, and it's consequences. To ask 'nature or nurture' in light of the clear connections between abuse/neglect and the creation of sociopaths is like wrapping a blindfold around our eyes because what we see is too painful and frightening. It is also part of protecting ourselves from recognizing the amount and scope of horrors that chidlren endure and have historically endured, and to protect us from awareness of our own unresolved painful/traumatizing experiences from childhood etc. To protect the idea of the 'good Mother'. The child who isn't loved always thinks that she is 'bad' and it is 'her fault'. When parents divorce, the child thinks it's their fault, or if a parent dies, the same.

Warning spoilers ahead:

But it does show great progress in that, in this movie, while the son is shown as almost comically evil, there is an ambivalence. The Mother is not shown as being 'good' to the degree we saw in 'The Bad Seed', for instasnce, and the son is shown to have a somewhat 'normal' relationship with his Dad. The Mother is more ambivelent.  And at the end, we see that the son is also mystified by his actions-ONLY however, AFTER he has been 'punished' so that we are relieved of our own inner sense of needing to be 'punished' for being 'bad' i.e. threatening to the Mother/Father in some way. A reenactment of our orginal traumas etc.

Still, c'mon, the son who KILLS his Dad and sister???? Just because he was 'born that way'???? A LOT of psychological projections and emotional material in this film. Let's face it, the boy who kills his classmates is someone who was bullied mercilessly, or, even when we cannot find the exact reason, it is almost certainly due to abuse/neglect trauma etc, whether by parents or others.",1393977600,,2025,4.676966292134831

We need to remember the parents of those who suffer the horrific deeds of their offspring. We need to be reminded that our children are but a step away from a moment of unadulterated insanity. We need to be reminded that close investigation of a troubled child is not a crime.

5076414,5,B007C3TVEY,"I loved this movie.  I just finished watching it via Amazon instant video.

This is a deep, dark drama that has a slowly gathering plot conflict. It is not for everyone.  Many parents, particularly mothers, may have a hard time with Eva's (Swinton) lack of ability to bond with her son. Are maternal feelings a part of the natural order? Is this why her son Kevin ""has no personality"" and for all purposes is portrayed as a sociopath? Eva eventually has the ability to connect with her daughter who is about eight-years younger than Kevin.

So, the film asks questions about the nature of evil, or evil actions. Nature versus nurture. It provides the answer for you a few times in such quotes by Kevin's character as ""there is no point,"" and not recalling if there was any impetus for his horrible criminal incident.  Eva goes about her lonely life after the incident in routine fashion caring about the mundane in a losing battle against entropy as if the only point for her is waiting for her natural death.

There is beautiful religious and spiritual imagery throughout the film.  The opening scene has Eva being lifted Christ-like bathed in red while on one of her many travels abroad; a baptism of of free spirit which will be tethered with the arrival of her firstborn. The color red and water imagery is prevalent; possible representing sacrifice and redemption (or change). Without giving away any major plot details - pay attention to one of the final scenes after Eva arrives home from the incident.  She hears the sprinklers on, which are heard frequently during the film in memory and flashbacks, and there are three (3) non-automatic fan sprinklers on.  Three is sacred number in many religions, and might be homage to the Holy Trinity here.

The performances from all are stellar.  Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller are amazing and convincing. It is worth watching just to see them maneuver through such ferocious chemistry.

The single thing that bothered me was the reaction of the townspeople.  While I do believe that it would be human nature for a few individuals to treat Eva as horribly as she was treated in the film, I believe that we live in a world where most people would not place the blame on the parent and attack them so viciously.

If you are an action or a comedy buff, or need big special effects, this is not your movie.  It will leave you talking and thinking about it for a while after.  I will watch again to pick up details I missed before.  It is the literary critic in me.",1388620800,,2508,4.625282167042889

Perhaps that was not a goal of the movie but I was left feeling very sad and hopeless for this family and with all the school shootings these days I needed to see some gain on this epidemic.

The actors were all tremendous and I truly lost myself in the movie.  It truly hit home that mental illness is serious and the family truly suffers however this film shows that there are many more victims than the patient and their family.",1387756800,,624,4.408695652173913

I watched it 2 times in one sitting as I was mesmerized by the story line and the acting. Tilda plays Eva, a highly reluctant mother with a challenging new born. Eva's husband played by John C. Reilly just wants a life in the suburbs without reality.

This family is living an unfulfilled life in a home that they appear to never fully move into, except for Eva who decorates her room with memories and maps of her life before marriage and children.
The story touches on many taboo's in society and is never clear if the core issue is Kevin, his mother  and father or the mix and nature at its worst.",1387670400,,729,4.352941176470588

I should have gone with my original instinct 20 minutes in to scrap it. But I kept waiting for it to improve. It didn't. The never-ending stream of flashback is so badly done that if the lead actress didn't slightly alter her hairdo, one wouldn't know what was going on.  The film is disjointed, the pacing off-kilter, the lead actress's performance painfully flat, and the story overwrought. It's hard to sympathize with the female protagonist. She is either terribly stupid or mentally ill herself.  The only thing worth seeing is the performance of the male lead - that kid is great. The write-up suggests Kevin is evil? No, just emotionally neglected and abused by a self-centered, cold, not-very-intelligent excuse of a mother. Oh.. and you'll have to mute through the incredibly annoying soundtrack. I'm giving two stars for effort - I've certainly seen worse. But this was a serious waste of time.",1384128000,,1064,4.867403314917127

Love is #1 and a child can sense rejection, inadequacy, and aloofness without us saying a word. Its sensed strongly and Kevin obviously feels that animosity and it leads to a lost,  cold, vengeful young man. Ezra and Tilda are amazing in their roles.

They are far more terrifying than Uma Thurman's feet. Thank God Quentin Tarantino didn't direct this, because there would have been way too many close-ups of Tilda's feet for me to handle. I'm sensing a tomato theme here with lots of tomato symbolism dipped in tomato juice. If I had produced this movie, I would have called it ""We Need to Talk About Tomatoes.""

However, something about watching it play out and seeing the extreme emotion displayed by Tildas character...It made me sick to my stomach. She is sooo good at her craft and the new actor who plays Kevin was equally impressive. It was very difficult to tear my eyes away even though I was trying to multitask and get some work done while watching it. I knew the story yet it was like reliving it all again but on a much deeper level. I felt deeply for Tildas character. It haunted me for days afterwards which the book didn't do as much I suppose it is because we can buffer out minds in a way from what we are reading in a book and imagine it as we want. but the movie doesn't let us do that. It forces us to see the story in a raw way. The only complain I have about the movie is the god awful soundtrack. I understand the person who selected the music, likely the directory, was probably trying to use such simple, old fashioned, creepy ass annoying music to put us into the moms...or kevins head a little better so we felt just as out of control and confused as they did. but I found myself having to mute the movie and turn on CC to keep watching.

The way the movie played out in flashbacks and recurring themes made it visually very interesting.  Even though you know what's coming, my jaw still dropped when it happened.

Reilly are in an indie vehicle--hardly destined for blockbuster status.)  except perhaps her understated performance is a modesty that is meant to highlight the subject matter rather than her acting ability.  The topic unfolds as a family drama should with no more to say about it here than a teenage tragedy is revealed.  Director Lynne Ramsey's adapted screenplay, and, especially, her directing (as well as Joe Bini's editing) play as much front and center as the title character by giving us a story and a scattered time-frame, which isn't just present an artsy, random hodge-podge, but a real medium of unveiling a dreadful situation.

As you are watching it, you will probably find yourself frustrated, which I believe is part of the director's construct to make you have an almost visceral sense of the main character's (Eva) frustration. Then as the story unfolds, and your understanding of what is happening or has happened increases, your frustration turns to anger and fear, and finally to sympathy and empathy for Eva and even Kevin. You will be left with an epiphany or reinforcement of the fact that there are no easy answers because we don't even know all the questions.

How can actors bring such extreme characters to life without changing themselves forever?  The short answer is that you cannot.  Miller has said in interviews that he suffered nightmares throughout the filming of ""Kevin"" and still gets confused, when very tired, about whether or not he has actually massacred people.

The fundamental problem of ""Kevin"" is the script (a trail of culpability which I suppose would lead back to the book; I haven't read it).  Kevin is so completely evil from the moment of inception that he has no moments of humanness, no glimpses of tenderness, despair or doubt, nothing that could possibly allow us to understand or sympathize with the character.  He's not a boy so much as an incredibly malevolent automaton.  ""We need to talk about Kevin"" is a bit like saying ""we need to talk about Satan,"" but the son of the morning, at least, used to be an angel and offered some useful ideas about keeping human beings in line.

5076493,3,B007C3TVEY,"SPOILERS.........

I don't know if I ""liked"" this film. It, and the actors, particularly Tilda Swinton, succeeded in portraying the possible reality of everyone living in such a situation, the rejected love, the maturation of evil, the agony and pure terror, the pain. Those are all very uncomfortable emotions, and so again, I wouldn't say I liked it. I found the editing technique to be pretty chaotic, when each scene is of a different place and time. Sometimes I wasn't quite sure where or when.

I do not agree with the premise of the film and also those of a number of reviewers, that the ""problem"" with Kevin was due to his mother's failings as a parent. First off, it seems to be a common thing that the ""instant bonding"" doesn't always take place instantly. Secondly, the other side of the bonding has to come from the baby, and with Kevin, it never did. Kevin's problems were not caused by ""no one loving him,"" because his mother did love him, in her way. She was there, talking to him, rolling the ball to him, reading to him, visiting him at the prison. He rejected her until he was old enough to start being deliberately malicious. She was the only one who saw it, since Kevin put on a good show for his ""loving"" BLIND father. What I wanted her to do was to leave them, and see how long Kevin put on the show for his father, when he had no one else to torment, and maybe that would have opened the father's eyes to Kevin's reality.

  It was clear that something was wrong with Kevin early on, but no one except his mother could see it. Why did his father and the drs think there was nothing wrong with a boy who wasn't talking or still not toilet trained at age six or so? In regard to the abuse scene, it felt odd. I am sure any mother would be VERY tired of changing diapers on a boy far too old to still be wearing them, with no disability noted, but I didn't get why she would become angry that he had dirtied his diaper, when he was still wearing them? It wasn't like he was using the toilet, so what else would he do? Also, since she threw him against the wall, where did that mark/scar come from? His blackmailing was just chilling.

It seems to me that Kevin was clearly born without the empathy gene, or was the definition of a sociopath,and nothing his mother could have done could change that. What I don't get, is how, since Kevin's mother knew that he was capable of evil, they ever thought it was a good idea to give him a deadly weapon, but this scenario has been played out in one school shooting after another. Everyone would know that the boy wasn't ""right,"" yet gave him access to guns. I also wouldn't have brought a new child anywhere near him. She was lucky she lived as long as she did, even though she had already lost an eye. How is it that she still felt loving and safe with her brother after he blinded her? I am glad though that the film didn't show what he did with the hamster. I had visions of it being pinned to the target, since we heard Kevin shooting while they were looking for it. Also, how would those plastic locks have kept Kevin out of the cupboard where the Drano was? Even the daughter was old enough to open them. I got a different impression with the scene where Kevin was sick. I didn't think that he was being nice to his mother because she was reading about shooting the arrows, I thought it was because he was sick and needed her. I
could be mistaken.

The couple of things I had real issues with was how Kevin killed a bunch of kids with arrows. It didn't show the actual shootings or how  many kids or what room they were in, but I find it hard to believe that they all were equally as helpless, to hide, to try to disable or disarm Kevin as if he was shooting them with an assault rifle, or that he was able to achieve maximum fatalities with one arrow each. That was really stretching credibility. Also, at the end, when Kevin was going to be transferred to an adult prison, he acted scared, and unsure. Those are normal emotional responses. A real sociopath wouldn't feel them.",1366934400,,4046,4.300524934383202

5076496,4,B007C3TVEY,"DON'T, whatever you do, read any summaries of this movie's plot. Beware of spoilers: I feel sorry for whoever reads any outline before seeing this film.

It's made to be seen free of such summaries, as a whodunit where you're clueless and stay that way for its first half hour, possibly longer, while trying to piece together what's going on. Half the joy's in this gradualism, with the clues nicely laid out via a well-chosen collection of odd, sometimes near-incoherent scenes. Despite that mental fog, the direction also manages to get across quite clearly that it will dissipate, as well as that this is no surreal plot but a set of bizarre circumstances warranting the befuddlement, since it fits the plot perfectly.

Much about this film is also cringe-worthy, yet it's never a tawdry emotional grab. A horror movie as much as a psychological thriller, it raises issues about nature vs nurture, and whether something beyond parental incapacity makes us tick. No simple answer emerges, so the unfolding is the nub.

Tilda Swinton's acting is top-rate, her androgyny perfectly fitting this particular part: in several scenes it compounds the requisite discomfort. She was reportedly nervous about playing a mother without being one. Yet even her way of holding the infant alone speaks volumes, contributing to the visceral impact. Everyone else in the cast is also at least good, albeit never on her level.

Ezra Miller, as Kevin, is clearly dealt the weakest hand: scant dialogue and just growling try to pass for character. Surely better could have been scripted for this part, and the director might have considered something subtle, for balance. John C. Reilly, as Swinton's go-with-the-flow husband, is the movie's second weakness. His laconic character verges on absence, and one teeters between considering such obtuseness possible, however implausible, and outright disbelief.

Together with Swinton, most aspects of the direction and photography/art direction call for special mention, with the techniques to unravel the plot being especially intriguing. One of those rare films that may send you back to the source novel (by Lionel Shriver) to fill in the lost detail and for another look at the artefact in its original form. It got a Palme d'Or nomination for best film at Cannes, and Tilda Swinton was up for a best actress Golden Globe award. Both were well deserved.

The problem with the film is it is very serious and this may work for some while for others it won't. There is not much hope in the film but there are slight delightful drama bits here and then if you would bother to notice.

Kevin is the worst kid in the world who doesnt listen to his mother and hates everything about her from early birth. He doesn't have a learning disability and is never able to comprehend why he hates her so much. She is a helpless mother lost between being loving and strict, but she can't help herself. She lets go off everything in life for him while the father plays neutral.

What makes it watchable is very emphatic direction and screenplay.
What makes it unwatchable is how much scenes will make you cringe.

Eventually the film could leave you in either despair or feeling like something has been gained, it left me more so with the former feeling.

I also have to spare a moment to say that I just didn't like John C. Reilly in this movie he just sucks the life out of any scene he is in he is a great actor when he can find a movie to fit his talents but he misses the bulls eye big time with this one

These are somewhat minor quibbles with the casting on my part the uphill fight that both the book and the movie but particularly the movie never deal with are the actions on the part of Eva Khatchadourian or rather the lack of action on the part of Eva Khatchadourian.  I think we can safely assume that the family is at least comfortably upper middle class therefore any rational person would be curious if you have a child that you feel is just a ""bad seed"" from the beginning why do you not take advantage of an entire branch of human psychology study and take the child to a mental health professional of some kind?  You can't just say that ""Oh Kevin is really good at manipulating people"" because even that over a sustained period of time would raise red flags in the real world suspension of disbelief only goes so far.  While The overwhelming majority of the blame for Kevin's behavior pattern has to be with the mother that would disregard how Kevin's mother is treated in the end quite unfairly not just once or twice but almost constantly by probably 95% of the people that she meets.  I really find myself coming down on her side here Kevin is responsible for Kevin's actions not his mother.  Why doesn't she report the actions of the vandals to the police?  Why does she not have some manner of police protection?  Why does she put up with casual assaults on the street?  Why doesn't she just move?  I guess we are supposed to think she allows all of those things to happen because she feels guilty for giving birth to a monster but that is really the problem right there by the end you feel bad enough for this woman you don't need more reasons to sympathize with her every two minutes after awhile they just feel manufactured.

5076507,5,B007C3TVEY,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this at first, as the film jumps around a bit, but one quickly realizes that the director is ""showing, not telling"" the present-day life of a stunned, numbed and traumatized mother, played by Tilda Swinton, using vignettes of her and her family's past to show why she is how she is now, how she got to this place in her life. It doesn't take long to get the feel for the storytelling style, and once I was comfortable with that, within 15 minutes I was absolutely riveted. By 30 minutes, I was already thinking to myself this might be one of the most well-acted and -directed films I have ever seen. The cinematography is adept. What a sleeper... If you like cerebral, suspenseful, psychological thriller-esque, deep, and yes even dark movies, this is for you. It was perfect for watching alone, undistracted,on a quiet day, and I am sure will have me thinking about it for a long time. I immediately went online to see if Lynne Ramsay has directed anything else I might be able to watch and there are a couple films, so I put them in my queues; I like her style. I've always loved Tilda Swinton and John C.

I think it's important to note: I was unaware that this was an adaptation of a best-selling novel by Lionel Shriver, am inspired to read said book, AND ***I am glad in this case that I did not have any preconceived notions about what to expect, had no idea what was coming next*** as I sat down to watch.

5076509,2,B007C3TVEY,"There's no question that this movie is brilliantly made: great to look at and superbly acted, qualities which made it the 15th most mentioned movie in 2011 critics' Top 10 lists. But does it make an ounce of sense in terms of actual human psychology? Fact: there are no children like Kevin, who as an infant behaves like a psychopath when he's with his mother but normally with everyone else, especially his father (which prevents anyone from believing that he's a monster). Fact: the film emphasizes that Eva had severe trouble bonding with Kevin before his psychopathy emerged, strongly suggesting a causal relationship, but that's complete nonsense. Psychopathy is a neurological defect that has nothing to do with the quality of parenting, and to even suggest that it does is a reversion to the days when autism and schizophrenia were blamed on bad mothering. Fact: while there's reason to believe that Eric Harris of Columbine and Andrew Golden (Jonesboro, 1998) were psychopaths, they represent a distinct minority of school shooters, and both recruited accomplices; so the notion of a psychopathic lone school shooter is at best a stretch. Fact: the parents of school shooters have never been ostracized or persecuted by their community (as happens here, and it's a major plot point).

So what we have here is a film that *given a sufficient knowledge of psychology* (which clearly is not the case for many critics and fans of critically acclaimed movies) is no more realistic or credible than The Omen. And yet it purports to cast an insightful light on the troubling phenomenon of school shootings. What it's actually doing is exploiting school shootings while portraying them in a thoroughly misleading light. In terms of story, it's cheap horror posing as art.",1362528000,3,1771,5.044368600682594

The story is presented nonlinearly but not in a gimmicky way, focusing on five phases of the protagonist, Eva's (Tilda Swinton) life.  It abandons the typical escalating-events-that-crescendo-into-a-specific-climax type storytelling; one that traditionally would spoil the movie after the first viewing or reading about the ending.

The movie is based off of a book which goes into detail on how Kevin's mother, while pregnant with him, was completely apathetic to the idea of being a parent, something that may or may not have affected how Kevin turned out.

After every movie, I ask myself, ""what are the redeeming points of this movie?"". The only one I could think of was, when Kevin was talking to his mother (in jail) about ""that people wouldn't be watching him (on TV) if he got a straight A grade in geometry"".

5076526,3,B007C3TVEY,"Excerpt:

 Lynne Ramsay's We Need to Talk about Kevin (2011), her first feature in nine years and an adaptation of the novel by Lionel Shriver is, to put it simply, spectacularly messed up.

The story follows the life of one Eva Katchadourian (Tilda Swinton) as she gives birth to her son Kevin (played at various ages by Rocky Duer, Jasper Newell, and Ezra Miller as the child, youth, and teenaged Kevin respectively), struggles to raise him to doubtful young adulthood and, much later, live a life made lonely by ostracization from the entire community--though not necessarily in that order. Ramsey shuffles the time order, her way of echoing the novel's structure (a series of letters written by Eva to her husband that look back on her life), leaving clues along the way of something terrible that happens--will happen--later in the film, possibly the reason for her isolated status.

Like an itch you can't scratch, Kevin is out of reach of the viewer - and the throttling he deserves cannot be delivered.  Perhaps this is why the film appeals to some - a celebration of impotence or some other Freudian concept.  As for me, the one positive in it was that I saw it for free.  Of course, like ""Funny Games"", after it was over, I felt the filmmaker owed me for my time.

5076533,4,B007C3TVEY,"Every time some deranged individual goes on a mass killing spree, we rightly focus our attention and concern on the victims and the devastated loved ones they leave behind. But who thinks about the impact such events have on the family of the killer?  Well, the makers of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" certainly have, and the result is both heartbreaking and blood-curdling to witness.

This grimly fascinating indie drama focuses on Eva (Tilda Swinton in a bravura performance), the mother of a troubled teen who slaughters a number of his fellow classmates in a high school assembly.  The multi-tiered screenplay by Rory Kinnear and director Lynne Ramsay looks at Eva's life both after the massacre and in the years leading up to it (Kevin is played  by three different actors  at various stages of life).

From the beginning, Kevin is clearly a problem child, a ""bad seed"" as it were, for lack of a better term (think of Damian sans the supernatural powers and Satanic bloodline).  Perpetually frustrated and exhausted, filled with self-loathing and doubt, Eva spends every waking moment struggling to be a decent mother to her child, but nothing she does or says can break through the emotional barrier the sociopathic Kevin has set up between himself and the world.  Eva is further isolated by the fact that Kevin even has his own father (John C. Reilly) deluded into believing that the problem does indeed lie with Eva, in her weaknesses and inadequacies as a mother - almost to the point where even Eva, at some level, begins to believe it herself.

Swinton breaks our hearts every step of the way as she wages a constant, solitary battle against a force she has no hope of ever understanding or controlling - for all the parents around her seem to have no such problems raising their own, much more reasonable and malleable children.  It leads us to the broader question of what happens when that most basic of all human bonds - that between a parent and a child - is irrevocably broken.  And how is a parent to love a child who steadfastly refuses to love her back?

And life is certainly no better for Eva after the killings, for now she is forced to live out the rest of her life as a pariah in a community that blames her in large part for the tragic loss it has suffered, a community that has no interest in reaching out to her for understanding or healing. Her fate, then, is to struggle on alone, devoid of sympathy, compassion and any chance at reparation.

""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" may be one of the bleakest and most despairing portraits of parenthood and childrearing ever committed to film, but it makes for a haunting and unnerving experience that you will find very hard to shake.",1359763200,,2707,4.638075313807532

5076542,5,B007C3TVEY,"Eva Khatchadourian's life has completely changed since the incident involving her son Kevin at his school. She used to be a successful travel writer and now she took any job that would have her (in this case a clerk in a travel agency). She used to have a family in a large luxurious house, but now lives alone in a small squalid house. The people of her town are largely hostile towards her, splashing her house with red paint and even attacking her in the street. Kevin nears eighteen and she regularly visits him in jail despite not having much to talk about. Eva reflects upin her strained  relationship with Kevin and his complacent father who dismissed all of her concerns as she struggles to put some semblance of a life back together in the face of depression and the judgment of the people around her.

I am really impressed with this film. It examines this fictional situation that has been seen countless times in the news over the years and simply presents pieces of the story as the film goes along, allowing the viewer to come up with their own rationalizations and judgments. There aren't any clear answers about anything because there are none in real life. It makes for a thought provoking and depressing film that has stayed with me. A major theme in the film is the lack of communication in the whole situation. Despite the title of the film, no one actually talks about Kevin. Every attempt Eva made to voice concern about him was dismissed by medical professionals and her husband. After her concerns went unheard, she stopped trying to voice them. This lack of communications permeates all aspects of Eva's life. She never really talks to the people who were devastated by Kevin's actions (which may have made her feel less alone and ostracized) or to her husband about her doubts about being a mother and wanting to travel more (which may have made their relationship and marriage better) or even to Kevin. It's actually quite sad how a healthy dose of communication could have helped a lot of the situations here.

I loved Tilda Swinton's portrayal of Eva. She comes off as a sympathetic and human character. It seems as if she didn't really want to be a mother right from the beginning. She seemed detached from the other mothers in the pregnancy classes, abhors her constantly crying infant son, and even tells him that every day she wakes up she wishes she was in France. Unfortunately, society still considers it a taboo when a woman doesn't like being a mother or doesn't want children, so this portrayal is rarely seen. Many would see Eva as a terrible person, but motherhood really isn't for everyone. I'm sure there are many women out there that regret having children because our society puts forth that all women should want or like children and have a maternal instinct. Eva made some mistakes along the way, but she really loved Kevin and tried to do her best even when he was at his worst. Over time, she grew scared of him and knew that anything she said against him would be dismissed and would make her look irrational or cruel. In the aftermath of the incident, Eva takes a lot of grief and violence from the parents of Kevin's school mates. Instead of protesting this or even talking to them, she quietly takes the abuse and moves on. She believes Kevin's actions to be her fault and accepts the vitriol of others because she believes she deserves it. Eva is a flawed person, but is simply human and undeserving of such punishment.

Kevin is a frightening character. Through the course of the film, he grew from a difficult infant to a sociopathic  teenager. Talented at manipulation, he uses the people to his advantage at every opportunity even at a young age. His relationships with Eva is complex and interesting. She is the only person who sees him for who he truly is, but he punishes her at every turn because he knows no one will believe her. His violent act is designed to hurt his mother in the deepest possible way, even going so far as to reference the children's book she read him when he was sick. The reason why Kevin ended up as he did is an obvious question and doesn't have a clear answer.

The way the film is presented is disorienting at first. It starts after the incident but then constantly flashes back to life before from Kevin's birth to the incident in a fairly linear order. I would recommend watching the film at least twice because it makes much more sense the second time and more nuanced things can be recognized when not hindered by trying to figure out where every scene fits into the story timeline. The cinematography is striking. The color red is used in much of the film as a constant reminder of the blood and violence that Kevin caused.

We Need to Talk About Kevin provides a different perspective on a story we have seen time and time again in the news. It provides some insight into how the people might feel in this situation and how something like this might happen without resorting to stereotypical smokescreens as other films have. I would recommend this highly disturbing and powerful film.",1358294400,,5081,4.626385809312638
5076543,4,B007C3TVEY,"This is a difficult movie -- the difficulty in the content makes it difficult to construct a surpassingly successful film.  It's certainly a valiant effort by the film makers, who produced a thoughtful, provocative, disturbingly touching film.  Ultimately, they had to make a film about very specific characters, but any American watching will find it hard not to think about other facts, other families.  My only concern is that there's a whiff of a suggestion that Kevin's mom's ambivalence about getting pregnant when she did is at the root of his behavior.  If I could, I'd give Swinson ten stars for her betrayal of Kevin's mom.  That said, this isn't four stars because her performance is raising up a three-star movie; I think it's four stars on its own.  Also:  Based on prior reviews I was really afraid there'd be gore or something that would give me a sudden scare.  That was needless worry.  You don't need to sit on the edge of your seat, there is nothing that will make your heart pound.  It's not that kind of movie.",1358208000,,1031,4.677777777777778

This is about mental illness and how parents can wear the cloak of deniability so easily while trying to go on with their lives and missing what is happening in front of their faces.  Don't watch this before bed, you will dream about it all night.  It probably would have won Oscars if the subject matter weren't so tough to think about let alone begin a conversation about it.

I would not call this an entertaining movie, because it is not.  It's a heavy duty drama that focuses on a subject that few people wish to examine in depth.  It's not a ""weepy"" or ""melodramatic"" drama. It's not a love story, its a chronicle of tragedy.  It tends to put the viewer more in a state of horrific wonder as they watch the screen. There are no light moments.

The movie is disturbing and bleak, but then again it's about a part of life that very few people have to deal with or even attempt to justify; let alone witness it up close and personal.  The movie is so realistic that its like watching a case study in which a family unravels; and hits its zenith when a violent act of rage is committed by the teenage son.  The devil did not make him do it, his rage did.  There is no forgiveness displayed in this film by anyone... it is a brutal.

Well, it's a five Star movie, that's for sure.  If you are empathetic or very sensitive, it is disturbing. Just keep telling yourself ""its only a movie"" or don't watch it. I was expecting a drama, but frankly I wasn't expecting this.",1358035200,,1225,4.278260869565218

5076548,4,B007C3TVEY,"In light of the tragic shootings in Colorado and Connecticut, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is particularly relevant and disturbing.
Director Lynne Ramsay pilots an uncompromising film without assigning or denying blame.  Some times the non-linear structure is disarming but by the movie's end, all the pieces fall together.
Watching KEVIN is often uncomfortable as we soon realize a happy ending is not in the cards.  KEVIN poses the time-honored debate involving nurture vs. nature:  is Kevin born bad or has his parents lack of proper guidance and alleged abuse created a monster?  This question remains a viewer's perception.  I tend to feel it's a combination of both.
Tilda Swinton is deservedly a Golden Globe nominee for her devastating portrayal as Kevin's mom.  John C. Reilly offers an understated performance as the passive father.  Ezra Miller and the two younger Kevins are frighteningly chilling.

The movie also missed a lot of the parts that made the book great; I know they can't fit everything in but the book was about so much more than what is presented in the movie.

5076553,2,B007C3TVEY,"Tilda Swinton plays an isolated, depressed woman with painful memories.  Her son, Kevin, was a hostile, difficult child from birth  She was somewhat ambivalent about motherhood, and Kevin's constant, angry crying as a baby and cruel nature as a boy make it even harder for her to bond with him.  Her husband is blissfully ignorant, in part because Kevin is skillful in showing his dad a more pleasant side.  Mother and father also have a later-in-late baby, an affectionate little girl who is nothing like her older brother.

Kevin's calculating hostility culminates in a horrifying event that is slowly revealed in flashbacks.

We never get an explanation of why Kevin is so hateful, and the parents never really try to get help (in fact, the dad denies anything is wrong).  Perhaps that was the intended point - that sometimes there is no explanation, sometimes people are just born bad.  However, the film hints that maybe it's because the mother didn't immediately bond with baby Kevin even though she tried (an offensive and insidious message - and Kevin's dad doting on him doesn't make him a nicer person).  It's unclear if we're supposed to blame her, or if the mom is simply blaming herself.

The acting was great, but I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of this film.  It was a hopeless little slice of hell. If it was meant to be thought-provoking, it doesn't even try to explore any of the options Kevin's parents may have had to figure out what was going on with him.

I also question the method of carrying out the ""big event.""  I didn't find it realistic and I wondered if they steered clear of the obvious and most frequently-used instrument in such events to avoid offending certain groups. I'm being cryptic to avoid spoilers, I know, and maybe the movie was simply being true to the book - but it seemed far-fetched.",1356825600,,1843,4.686335403726708

5076574,5,B007C3TVEY,"This film is an extraordinary portrait of a mother (nicely played by Tilda Swinton, a truly great actress) struggling with a psychopathic* child -- although this viewer was stunned by the amazing performance of Ezra Miller as the teenaged son, which dominates the second half of the film.  The director begins with disjointed moments from mom's life in true (and perhaps slightly clichd) Indie Film style, but this technique works as it should here to disorient us and fill us with a sense of dread and impending doom.  We know something terrible is going to happen.  Nothing, however, prepared me for the powerful work of young Ezra Miller.  He can summon a coiled intensity like a cobra preparing to strike.  Several of his scenes are quite simply unforgettable for their preternatural stillness and menace.

The director wisely opts not to show us the deaths of the students Kevin murders -- only the aftermath (seen early on in the film).  What we see instead is a long shot of Kevin shooting arrows in every direction, a sequence less distasteful than shots of the actual carnage would have been.  I think we have been desensitized to violence by countless dozens of movies, so the director's decision here is very wise, and the result more chilling than the alternative.  Equally memorable is the scene early in the film when the mother visits her son in prison, when all we see of him is the row of fingernails he has bitten off and carefully lined up on the table between them.  The huge gulf between mother and son here becomes palpable.

There are also some fine bits of irony in the screenplay:  The kid is always sucking up to his dad, who teaches him to shoot a bow and arrow -- the same weapon later used to kill dad.  The finest scene of all may be at the end of the film when mom visits Kevin in prison for the last time:  His spirit seems to be broken (clearly prison has been hard on him), and he finally becomes the sweet son she always wanted.  Here Ezra Miller is superb -- almost unrecognizable as the same boy we have come to know.  This sort of thing is the very definition of great acting.  The music score reflects some irony as well, consisting rather surprisingly of country songs that provide a deft counterpoint and commentary to the mood of the film.

This film is not recommended for expectant mothers, but urgently recommended for everyone else, both for the fine work of director Lynne Ramsay and the superb performances by the actors.

Unfortunately this movie was a miss - there was too much time spent watching Eva wash red paint and not enough time building the unsuspecting yet highly intelligent mind behind Kevin, Eva's brilliant career as an author and love of traveling, and the extent of extreme differences (such as cultural) between Eva and her husband, their fierce arguemnts, and how this added to her suffering (they seemed too loving and understanding). There was so much more horror that was missed such as conflicting stories of what really happened to Kevin's sister's eye, the intricacy behind Kevin's final plan, the conversation at that morning's breakfast table, his reign and arrogance at juvie-hall, manipulation of the legal system, his sister's glass eye.  All this would connect when Kevin realized that his bullying tactics would become ineffective when it was time to go to jail as an adult. But most disappointing was when Kevin should have said ""I'm sorry"" to his mother at the end when she hugged him -this would have brought everything to a full cirle showing Kevin really loved his mother, and felt remorse for taking away her husband and daughter.

5076593,2,B007C3TVEY,"Art films often require that a chance be taken on the part of the audience. I think that this is why audiences sometimes avoid them; when you buy a ticket to The Amazing Spider-Man, you more or less know what you're getting. When you buy a ticket to The Tree of Life, you're taking a chance on something that reaches farther and may, as a result reward you more. I took such a chance recently with We Need to Talk about Kevin, and unfortunately, the chance was punishing.

We Need to Talk about Kevin stars Tilda Swinton as Eva, at the bottom of a downward spiral. She's living alone, overmedicated, drunken, her community hates her, and her son Kevin is in prison. Through flashbacks, we see how she got here. Kevin was conceived through a passionate commencement of what was most likely destined to be an affair. Her husband Franklin is played by John C. Reilly, and we see fragments of her life with Kevin, as he is a baby, again when he's 6, and then when he's 16. We see the signs of a tragedy on the horizon, and I won't spoil what that is for you; you can figure it out pretty easily.

There is ample material here for a powerful drama, but We Need to Talk about Kevin squanders its potential. The first mistake that the movie makes is that it lacks any semblance of conflict. Little Kevin is evil. No, I mean REALLY evil. As a baby, he cries constantly, but only at Eva. As a 6-year-old, he refuses to communicate with her and provokes her into breaking his arm (trust me on this one). As a teenager, he's openly hostile. There's a single scene that seems to suggest that they will finally get along, but the movie suddenly resumes its unending stream of cruelty to Eva.

While this does stretch plausibility, the bigger problem is that it makes the movie completely predictable. We Need to Talk about Kevin may not be intended as psychologically realistic, but any kind of fiction needs a possibility that its events will turn out more than one way. Here, we see the ending coming a mile away because there's nothing to suggest anything else will happen. The third act of the film holds a fair amount of power as is, but because it's inevitable, it doesn't matter.

The second problem is the movie's style. I know, I know, art films need to be bold, but were We Need to Talk about Kevin a mainstream horror film, the crushingly obvious choice of soundtrack and endlessly recurrent use of the color red would be criticized as amateurish. Shots draw attention to themselves, like when Eva, pregnant, walks down a hallway as a group of young ballerinas run past her. We get it.

The praise I can laud upon the film is hampered by these last two points. Tilda Swinton is a magnificent actress, and she's as good here as she is anywhere else. John C. Reilly and Ezra Miller are also effective. And the style, while annoying, is basically technically competent. But a movie needs more than good performances; it needs a world that we can believe in, and that's where We Need to Talk about Kevin fails. If you want to see Tilda doing great work in a better movie, check out Julia.",1352764800,10,3082,4.476868327402135

5076599,5,B007C3TVEY,"Lynne Ramsay writes this screenplay from the novel of the same name by Lionel Shriver, then turns to directing ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"".  I was held astounded and mortified throughout this very dark and disturbingly brave portrait of unbridled evil.  At the movie's time of 49:18, I found it necessary to pause it just to catch a breath as my emotions were running wild for this mother; empathy, fear, suspicion, bewilderment ...

Tilda Swinton (Eva) pours-out a brilliant, emotionally exhausting portrayal of a mother who, in my estimation, never had a chance with the force that drove her son Kevin (Ezra Miller).  She relentlessly tries everything that a mother can possibly do.  I could find neither fault nor blame in her character while I constantly scrutinized this play out for a point, or situation, that it could have turned for the better.

This work is done amazingly well with its metaphoric red symbolism carried throughout. It may be visually tiring, although I thought that it was meant to carry this breathless pacing. It starts shockingly at the beginning and continues to the point of losing any possible hope for its conclusion; the point you no longer see red.  This fragmented and flashback style, especially in the first half, is well shown through the cinematography of Seamus McGarvey.

The soundtrack (Jonny Greenwood's Original Score) may come under fire for some 'odd' or 'unusual' song choices, mainly in the beginning. Although, for myself, it made a lot of sense as the story went forward.  Its beginning is in the time when Eva is flashing back to all that has happened and is living on sort of an autopilot; completely drained and traumatized. The folk-song type selections concerning a mother's love, add to the total confusion of what Kevin is doing to Eva.  I found it a little off, at first, then correctly confusing and thematically dichotomous. It mockingly lends to the question; What the heck is going on?

Eva and husband Franklin (John C. Reilly) present two different relationships with their son, starting from birth then to the younger-age Kevin (an astounding Jasper Newell).  Franklin keeps trying to support his wife although never sees with his own eyes any peculiar behavior from his son, only hears everything that is wrong with Kevin from Eva.  Kevin remains manipulative and conniving in his actions toward Eva and is obviously enjoying her reactions of pain and utter bewilderment.  Eva is silently screaming ""help me"" throughout this while going unnoticed by her husband, although, it is obviously picked-up and run-away with by Kevin.

Once Kevin is in the teen years, Ezra Miller (""Another Happy Day"", ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") takes over and does a tour-de-force of extremes in a cruel and bizarre manner towards his mother.  With Miller's facial expressions and mannerisms which are so wickedly ominous it is obvious, once again, just how much he is enjoying this ... her pain.

One understands, from the outset, that nothing good will come of this. Noticing the clock on the bedside table change from 12:00 to 12:01, we are forebode with the idea of what could transpire in just one minute ... and does.  As Kevin takes his final bow, everything comes full circle in the horrific unraveling of a family.",1352160000,4,3278,4.950729927007299
5076600,5,B007C3TVEY,"I do need to say up front that I'm a big Tilda Swinton fan, and tend to enjoy just about anything she is in. Like so many of her films, We Need to Talk about Kevin challenges viewers to enter difficult places. I think this film works well on several levels--psychological drama, horror (comparisons with Rosemary's Baby are right on, I think), cultural/social critique. It examines questions of Motherhood and Family and the ways that social expectations can potentially exasperate personality tendencies to end in tragic ways. It is perhaps on this level--the level of ideological critique--that I found myself most engaged, but I was equally impressed with the acting, and the way the individual characters are developed in meaningful and complex ways. I think the adaptation from the novel was pretty brilliant, liked the pacing and cinematography, and look forward to seeing more of Ramsay's films. Very haunting, perhaps at times a bit lurid, but a different kind of horror film, building through suspense and avoiding the cliches of a slasher film.",1352073600,,1054,5.098265895953757

Is it at least worth seeing for the performances?  No.  I like Tilda Swinton and I like Ezra Miller, but they're not featured well here in these silly shallow parts.  The best acting here is actually done by the young kid playing the evil boy at ages 6 - 8.  He's just a kid; he's not SUPPOSED to be subtle, unless anyone told him to be, so he has an excuse.

5076605,4,B007C3TVEY,"As parent of two boys and based off some of the reviews of this movie I was very unsure whether I should watch We Need to Talk about Kevin. While it does focus on Kevin, the son who is troubled, disturbed, depressed and at times violent, this films main character is the mother Eva, Played by Tilda Swinton. The cast was perfectly chosen and the multiple children who played Kevin were ideal to play one another at different ages as they look so much alike. And the older Kevin, played by Ezra Miller greatly resembles Tilda Swinton and is very believable as her son.

I watched this movie the other night and I cannot get it out of my mind. It is very intense, there is a lot of symbolism and there are little things which happen and you must put the pieces together as the movie is all over the place and events are not presented in order. It is disturbing at times and makes you uncomfortable at others, yet you cannot wait to unravel the secret of the film. To start off you know something drastic happened, yet it is a very slow transformation to reveal what event happened.

While a movie like this would usually leave a person depressed, I was surprisingly not so. I enjoyed the film and each level of sophistication and art style that I almost instantly wanted to watch it again.

So given that obvious fact from the opening scene is it really necessary to SHOW HER WASHING, SCRUBBING, WIPING, ETC... red substances (including hamster blood) off her hands throughout the entire film!?!

5076618,4,B007C3TVEY,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is full of subtleties, uncertainties, and improbabilities. We are told very little about the characters, and what we are shown is often marginal. Examples: I wanted to know more about the family's background, Kevin's condition (antisocial personality disorder or what?), how he interacts (or doesn't) with the other kids at his school, and most importantly, how he manages to commit this improbable crime. Yet, having said this I have to ask, ""What difference would all that have made?"" As Kevin himself states, ""That's the point: There is no point."" Although the minimalism works in the end, fans of traditional film narrative may find this one a bit frustrating. Having seen it, I'm glad I did, but it's not the sort of thing I want to see again any time soon.

The whole mood is, as you can imagine, very bleak, and, for lack of a better term, semi-surreal. The dialogue is especially important: e.g., Kevin: ""You can be kind of harsh sometimes""; Eva (his mother): ""You're a fine one to talk."" The physical traits Kevin and Eva share, while Kevin's father and sister share fairer traits, serve to symbolize how Eva is blamed so cruelly for Kevin's crime and the guilt she feels over same. What ""WNTAK"" shows and does not show leaves room for all kinds of interpretations, but I think it shows very effectively how society is cruel to everyone, and everyone learns, often in the hardest possible ways, from it.

The first hour or so is erratic and often confusing with all the jumping back and forth in time, but everything comes into sharper focus during the second half of ""WNTAK."" The fine, fine acting by Swinton, Reilly, and all three actors who play Kevin during various stages of his life is an indispensable strength here: Weaker or merely competent acting would have made this film quite forgettable.",1348963200,,1841,4.804416403785489

5076620,5,B007C3TVEY,"Eva (Tilda Swinton) is a wife and mother who has just experienced the last in a series of shattering incidents. In flashbacks, we see her happy life change forever with the birth of her unusual son. From that first day, she never feels any bond with him while he seems equally detached from and even hateful toward her.

This is an incredibly intense and heartbreaking film, dealing with the problem of alienation, the nature of familial love, and unspeakable violence.  All of the actors are excellent and I'm surprised they and the movie didn't get some Oscar nominations.  Swinton is utterly convincing as the emotionally-drained mother; she kept me on the edge of my seat every second.  John C. Reilly is very likable as the nave, loving husband.  The three young actors who play the son are remarkable; their performances are so intense I could barely watch them, yet couldn't look away.  The flashback format is sometimes confusing but helps to convey the chaotic, emotional, roller coaster that is Eva's life.

5076621,5,B007C3TVEY,"What's it like to be a free spirit, a hippy in the day, a willy-nilly wisp of a woman who is impregnated during her first encounter with the father? What's it like to have that baby who immediately takes a sharp dislike of his mother? Is that possible? Is it possible that a severely twisted bond forms between mother and son, one that tests everything known and unknown about the maternal relationship?

Such is the story in, first, the powerful novel, then its film adaptation. ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a highly charged, provocative, powerful film about the evolution of a born sociopath and his defiance of all that is normal.

Why can the reader believe Eva, this reluctant mother? In the book her story is completely believable, but the movie offers another perspective. The casting made this viewer sharply cognizant of the its power. Goldie Hawn would have made a completely different mother, as would Angelina Jolie. But the pinch-faced, intense Tilda Swindon presents that high strung, totally free spirit who is shocked and dismayed at a baby who seemingly cannot stand her. This baby cries constantly from the time the father leaves in the morning until the father returns in the evening. As he grows into a toddler, this same hate/love behavior towards his parents continues.

On paper such a controlling child seems totally sociopathic; on film he perhaps reacts to the apparent loveless attitude of his mother.

""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a disturbing film, to say the least. Hatefulness, spite, revenge, such emotions to attribute to a child, but it's there. The audience knows this child exists and must watch his hateful acts.

Kevin horrifies the world with his acts of violence toward the end, but, beware, Viewer, that is not the worst of his behavior. As his mother often told the father (in various words): ""We need to talk about Kevin."" Would it have helped if he had listened and talked? Such is a discussion for our violent culture.

Because of this my husband hated ""We Need to Talk About Kevin."" I on the other hand, thought the ""film"" approach made things unnerving and uncomfortable for the viewer..... which is EXACTLY how you need to feel watching the material you are watching. The content of the movie is intensely disturbing so the combined effect is genious.

The bouncing back and forth with flashbacks, screaming child - then quiet seemingly evil child, violent and raw behaviors, lack of communication between the parents - it is all meant to leave you with frayed nerves so that you can't swallow what is happening to Tilda Swinton's character any more than she can. It builds you up climactically too as you discover the horror of what Kevin does - while seeing that no one did anything to stop it, and debating with yourself if there was anything that could ever have been done.

After the movie was over, I felt uncomfortable and disturbed. My normal life and everything around me felt so quiet and slow - after what I had just seen : quick flashes/auditory assault/jarring content all jumbled together. The effect was tangible.  I didn't like feeling that way....... but I have to admit that the directors and Tilda Swinton did an astounding job to have left me with such a lasting impression and effect.

In the Film, ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" it was very difficult not to think about the book because a lot of important plot points and dialogue were left out.

Having read the actual book by Lionel Shiver, I found the movie translation rather disjointed and bland. I know it's impossible to add every detail of a book into a film, but a lot of the scenes were wasted on images of home improvement projects gone awry.

This should have been a better movie for the simple fact that the subject matter of a school killing is chilling, controversial and timely. It almost felt like the director depended on that so much that the actual story got lost in the almost two hours of blurry, nonlinear images.

What really bothered me is that the description of the movie promised a ""chilling ""ending. Like the book, it is quite clear how this is story is going to end from the very beginning.  What was truly chilling about the book, were the last few chapters that outlined the plotting and planning and what really happened on that ""day.""

5076638,3,B007C3TVEY,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" may fascinate you, but not in the way you want it. Some may call it a horror, but definitely not a usual kind of horror. Not many horror movies would employ narrative strategies that are ferociously disorienting like this. The film is about a former travel writer Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) and her son Kevin, whose increasing malicious behavior torments his mother.

Told in the chronologically jumbled order (with fragmented images, some of which could be results of the heroine's own imagination), ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" asks us to pick up the pieces and put them into the right places in the storyline. The task interests us at first, but as we come to see the whole picture, we notice that the film does not have much to say.

The mother-son relationship that went awry is one of the film's main themes, and the filmmakers should be thankful for the cast especially Tilda Swinton, without whose excellent performances as Kevin's mother the film would have been an unwatchable mess. In fact, whatever you feel about her character, Tilda Swinton (who eerily resembles Ezra Miller as teenage Kevin) is the reason you should see the film.

This is the third feature film from Lynne Ramsay, who directed ""Ratcatcher"" (1999) and ""Morvern"" (2002). I wasn't impressed with any of them though I admit she is quite good at creating atmospheric and surreal images that are both comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time. After her unsuccessful attempt to adapt ""The Lovely Bones"" (which Peter Jackson took over), Lynne Ramsay comes back. And she has not changed, for better or worse.

Watch for Tilda Swinton, whose great performances barely covers the fact that the film actually lacks depth with its unconvincing characters. It's a beautifully crafted faade that looks disturbing, but has little inside.",1344470400,,1849,4.97411003236246

4. This story is told as a series of flashbacks in the mind of the mother of the family (it is not clear what has happened to the rest of her family until the end of the film). It's also apparent from present circumstances that something has been done that has ruined this woman's name in the town.
5. As an adolescent, the boy's behavior becomes increasingly.......weird and uncomfortable. Everyone seems to see this except the father.
6. Finally, the boy has his ""big moment."" That involves killing a couple of members of his family and several high school students.

The biggest problems are that the suspense is drawn out too long (and we ultimately get no clear view of the killing) and the plot suffers from too many plausibility problems.

Plausibility problems: 1. I know that parents are the last ones to know that their children have problems. But could any two people miss *that* many problems and that many warning signals? 2. Clumsy foreshadowing. Tomato sauce everywhere. Red jelly everywhere. Other red food objects everywhere. Um, ok. We get it. (Talk about symbolism overkill.) 3. After all that went down in that town, the mother still stayed there and didn't move on and change her name? And someone was still willing to hire her and put their business on the line after all that? 4. One person with a bow and arrow could take out that many people before being overpowered? 5. A 5 year old could *run* a house like that and his parents couldn't control him? 6. A mother would come and visit her son in jail after he killed her husband and daughter and all those people?

Tilda Swinton is a great actress, and she did the best she could with a role that just wasn't all that believable. I didn't pay for this movie, and I'm glad. I won't be watching it again.",1344297600,2,2056,4.50402144772118

a. That this woman would be with this man, give up her lifestyle to become a suburbanite.
b. That this woman didn't tell her husband what the son was doing. Like not telling her husband about what she found in the kitchen sink.
c. That she never sought professional help for Kevin--or herself.
d. That townspeople would treat her the way they did, or that she'd stay in the same town.
e. The bows n arrows massacre??? Puh-leeze.

5076644,4,B007C3TVEY,"This film is actually a 3.5 star rating. However, I found somewhat creative in a different aspect of most films, giving it the extra 1/2 star. The symbolism of the color ""red"" was slightly overdone. This is a story (I didn't read the book) which could lead to several controversial subjects. From the beginning it's apparent a major tragedy has occurred in the mother's ""Eva"" (Swinton) family/life.  The movie changes scenes from the present to past events.  This may be a ""SPOILER,"" however I believe most know early on Eva's son was involved and her husband and dtg were victims. Eva has a son, ""Kevin."" Early, it's apparent Kevin isn't ordinary. He's highly intelligent. Is he a sociopath, a child needing strict discipline, or just evil? IMO, this is where the film goes too far. Even if he had no conscience, a 4-5 yr. old child can't rationalize a ""plan"" to fool a father who's a M.D., a published mother, albeit very unsure of herself. I found the main question to be, how far does a mother's love extend? The acting is very good. I want to read the book. As this is a movie of complex emotions and undertones I find would be nearly impossible for a viewer to understand what the writer intended. Personally, one comment from Kevin in prison made an impact. Telling his mother the majority end up ""watching TV at night. It's progressed to half of the people inside the TV are watching TV. What are they watching? Someone like me."" Definitely, ""food for thought."" Overall, the movie was avg to good. However, when the finale scene occurred, I felt somewhat cheated. However, the movie really isn't about the finale.  It's about what/why events leading to the finale occurred. Questions concerning nature/nurture vs. environment, unconditional love, etc. It was dark.

It is a mystery in which everyone knows what has happened except the audience. Kevin is smart, mean, and cynical. He seems to represent a generation raised on too much TV and computers, although we don't see him over indulging in either.

5076653,2,B007C3TVEY,"It had the potential to be a great film about an anti-social child, a negligent father, a mother who is trying to work with a child she cannot bond with, and the carnage the child brings into their lives. Unfortunately, it takes an Oliver Stone turn for the worse. It starts out with the mother covered in what seems like bloody jello and brains rolling in some hippie orgy. It is filmed in flashbacks/flash forwards/flash sideways. It is extremely disjointed and unsettling.

 It isn't until toward the end of the movie that it levels out and becomes a semi-recognizable story. It is a total train wreck the viewer cannot take their eyes off of. If the director could have taken some ADD medicine, it might have made a great movie. Tilda Swinton carries this disaster as best she can. John C Riley was a surprise. Known for his Will Ferrell movies, it was a shock to see him. He plays a father blind to his son's evil. His character is never truly explored. He just comes across as wanting to be his son's buddy, regardless of the child's behavior. He constantly makes his wife out to be the villain.

 When Kevin is approximately between five and seven years old. He refuses to potty train and likes to torment his mother by pooping on himself. No matter how hard she works with him, his dead eyes and soul are impenetrable. She loses it, and he exploits her guilt.

 She finally has a child who is loving and kind which they give the impression makes Kevin physically ill. The interesting dynamic of this film (and where it could have been explored further) is when Kevin is sick and cuddles his mom and rejects the dad. He shows the audience a clue that he knows who truly loves him (tries to love him) and who is a huge part of the problem (the dad).

  When Kevin hurts the little sister, all the viewer can ask is was why is this kid not in a psych ward??? Ezra Miller plays fifteen year old Kevin. He could have been good, but his character is poorly developed. Granted the story is from the mother's perspective, but there needed to be more between teen Kevin and his mother for one to fully comprehend what the heck is going on. The killing spree is glossed over. The end is sloppy. All the audience can think of is, ""thank God it's over, but now there are a bunch of unanswered questions!""

Imagine what it must be like to be the mother of one of the Columbine shooters, imagine the guilt, this film deals how a woman lives with the sins of her son after he commits a heinous act.  We know from science that psychopaths are born not made and good decent parents can raise a psychopathic child but this woman, played brilliantly by Tilda Swinton, blames herself because she never liked her son, she didn't want him from the beginning.  The character blames herself because she knew all along that there was something wrong with her boy.  She goes on to punish herself by remaining in the town where everyone knows her story, taking a job that's beneath her and even eating her son's favorite sandwich ( strawberry jelly on white bread).  By the time this film ends you'll be exhausted by the weight of this woman's guilt, you'll feel the pressure of her anxiety and soul crushing loss.  Its not a terrifying film, its subtle and nuanced drawing a profile of the mother's existence and her choices.  Only Tilda Swinton could have tackled this role.  The child is depicted a pure evil and its impossible to have any sympathy or empathy for him except at the very end of the film when you realize he doesn't understand himself and didn't understand the motivations of his own actions.  Its only at the end do you question whether the child is really a psychopath or just a boy he reacted to the knowledge that he was never loved by his own mother.  The final scene brings up a lot of doubt as to whether he was really evil or behaving so because he knew his mother thought that of him.  Every action on his part seems designed to hurt his mother which is why he makes sure she's left alive to live with his actions.

*****SPOILER ALERT*****

Working in the mental health field makes it hard to enjoy psychological thrillers because so often, the writers don't do their research. They create characters that don't exist in nature. Kevin was one such character. His behavior didn't match any diagnosis, so I could only conclude that he was born evil. That makes this a horror movie, not a psychological thriller. That also meant that he didn't have to have any reason for his decisions. It was totally random, which is emotionally unsatisfactory. I just spent 2 hours trying to get to know these people. I don't want to feel like everything happened, ""just because.""

Kevin's method for doing what he did (trying not to totally spoil it) is inexplicable. I do what he does. He didn't have the appropriate equipment to complete the task. His ""efforts"" weren't lethal. He could have easily been taken down if there were a lot of people in the gym. He would not have been unscathed or the only one standing. Again, poor research or incomplete information (or the film didn't show enough to overcome these observations).

The plot advances largely from thoughts inside Mommer's head. Unfortunately, it takes a while to catch on that you are inside Mommer's head, so it just feels like the action is randomly jumping forward and back. I was 30-40 minutes into the film before I had any idea what was going on. Even then, it was only a vague understanding of the story. I get that sometimes things don't come together for a while, but since this movie really didn't make it there, in retrospect, I feel like I should have used that first 30 minutes as a clue to to give up and move on.

It feels like someone said, ""Wow, we've got some great raw material to work with and show off all my artistic creativity."" Unfortunately, all the artsy tricks can't make up for lack of research, poor writing, and just not filling in the blanks.  This movie doesn't answer the question of what happened to Kevin? What was his motivation? Why was the community so hateful to the MOM? What did SHE do? You don't get any sense of who the victims were or why they were chosen. Without that information, it all just seems senseless. While I am not heartless, my reaction is, ""So what?"" There was nothing here to make me care about any of these people.",1341100800,12,2578,4.617903930131004
5076665,5,B007C3TVEY,"I wrote a well-received review about Lionel Shriver's book for GoodReads.com.  ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" was one of the best books I'd read in years, and was looking forward to seeing how it might be adapted to film.  My hopes were not high (I've seen too many made-for-film adaptations for optimism in this regard), but I was more than pleasantly surprised.  All of the elements that made the story work on paper translated well onto film (great character development, the complex relationships, the multi-faceted characters, Kevin's ""other-ness"", among others).  What surprised me was how compelling I found the film version of Kevin.  In the book, Kevin was far creepier, and strange in a more unattractive way; in the movie, he was smarter, more provocative, and (dare I say it?) alluring, even.  There were even subtle hints of it visible in the 6- to 8-year-old Kevin [paging Dr. Freud...].  In any event, there was something dangerously and menacingly attractive about teenage Kevin that I didn't catch in the book...but I did here.

Tilda Swenton was perfect as fragile, disillusioned, and cosmically disappointed Eva, and John Reilly was the quintessential supportive husband/dad in denial.  Great job, all around.

While not a movie for everyone (the book wasn't for everyone, either), it was right up MY alley, and I'll be thinking of this one for a long time to come.",1340496000,,1383,5.0
5076666,1,B007C3TVEY,"In a reckless moment free-spirited Eva has unprotected sex with her spouse/boyfriend/whatever, causing a pregnancy for which she feels increasingly unprepared. Soon enough Kevin emerges from her womb with an inexplicably preternatural awareness of his mother's prenatal reluctance/indifference/whatever towards him and proceeds to make her life hell for much of the film until his sinister grudge culminates in an atrocity.

That is the plot in a nutshell, although the film progresses in a non-linear fashion, no doubt in an attempt to unsettle the viewer so that one feels as bewildered as Eva through these events. The atrocity is referred to obliquely at the film's beginning but it's not difficult to figure out what happened from the barrage of speechless images. From there the first thirty minutes are an unnerving slog. However, once Eva throws Kevin against a wall--does anyone ultimately blame her?!--the film takes a bizarrely comic turn. The father becomes impossibly doting and oblivious as Kevin gets noticeably creepier. And in spite of her paranoia--conveyed, I suppose, by Tilda Swinton's relentless blinking at Kevin's foul-mouthed replies to her every solicitation--Eva reacts with equal indulgence.

The film's score constantly wavers between the strumming of a mandarin guitar (which is annoying as hell) or haunted house music or (more aggravating still) various uplifting songs which clash spectacularly with the dreary subject matter.

5076667,3,B007C3TVEY,"OK, so let's talk.  Critically this film by Lynne Ramsay (director/co-writer) explores the development of a serial killer from birth to adolescence.  From the beginning Eva (a superb Tilda Swinton) wasn't sure she wanted to give up her career as a travel journalist but her husband (John C. Reilly) thinks it's time to start a family.

The first born, Kevin (Jasper Newell at 8 and creepy Ezra Miller as a teen) never connected with his Eva.  He seemed to gravitate to Franklin (Reilly) and hate his mother.  Eva's exasperation with Kevin leads to clear psychological trauma.  The film jumps around all over the place with no real place-setters, so about the time we figure out what's what, it's time to jump again.

While Swinton and Miller give memorable performances, you have to ask yourself why this movie had to be made.  It is unsettling, disturbing and over-stylized.  As expected, we never get the answer to Eva's question to her son.  Why?  Indeed, why?

The Blu ray disc looks excellent with the transfer in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The color palet is excellent and the detail exemplary.

5076672,2,B007C3TVEY,"First, this nature vs. nurture thing is hogwash!!!  Was THAT the point of this movie?!?!  I agree with at least one of the other reviewers who wrote that MANY children have much more difficult childhoods, and NEVER end up killing another living creature.  What about parent(s) who are gone all the time for whatever reason(s)?  How can a child bond with a parent that is physically not even living with them?  I guess that means children who live in an environment like that will become psychopaths as well.  Ugh.  Whatever...

It's a random thing, plan and simple.  The mother simply does not know how to handle the situation, and receives no support whatsoever in trying to identify and/or address her son's behaviors.

All that being said, the most significant thought I had after the movie, during the movie, etc. was that there was just something MISSING.  I don't know what it was.  Maybe a lack of dialogue, maybe it was the HUGE jump in time from when he was about 7 or 8 to being a teenager.  Or the time jump from when the girl was born until she was, um, 5 or 6.  It just seems there were BIG gaps during those times.  Were Kevin's behaviors really supposed to be as sporadic as the movie showed them to be???

Before watching the movie, I thought his behaviors were supposed to be more IMPULSIVE, in other words, with no thought - that his actions and behaviors just ""happened"" almost without his control.  (Not the best choice of words, but all I can come up with right now.)  Anyway, during and after the movie, (to me) he seemed very cold, very calculated, very PLANNED and intentional.  And with the gaps in time, it made me think that he would go years without doing anything.... almost as if he was waiting for the ""right"" moment to hatch and execute his next plan.

I don't know, maybe I'm thinking about it too much...",1339459200,3,1838,4.512121212121212

The movie creates an attachment between the viewer and characters immediately, combined with outstanding performances by the actors.

5076674,4,B007C3TVEY,"Lynne Ramsay's WE NEED TO TALL ABOUT KEVIN is a very unique film experience, and not just in how unsettling the film is, but because of its deft storytelling, terrific directorial style and a tremendous performace by the great Tilda Swinton. Basically, the film is a disjointed and disorienting narrative about Eva (Swinton), the mother of Kevin (who is seen as a young child and then as a teen played by a mesmerizing Ezra Miller) and her husband (a too-paternal John C. Reilly) and the events that tear them all apart in the most horrific way possible. As the film opens, we see Eva in the middle of a massive tomato festival where tomatoes are being hurled around and bathing each person in the crowd in red. Next we see Eva awaking some years later to more red. Her small dumpy house and car have both been vandalized with red paint. This is a visual motif that continues throughout the film and is used to great advantage that Eva is constantly bathed in red, whether surrounded by or lighted by the color.

We go back and forth in time to see Eva with her new husband Franklin, a burly and jocular man throughout. They're happy in each other and in their wealth, and then they have their first child Kevin. We see a moment just after the delivery when Francis is cradling and cuddling the newborn, and Eva sits there motionless and expressionless. This is a key moment in the film of things to come between what ultimately dominates the story, which is that of the relationship between Eva and Kevin. As a baby, she seems to resent his presence. As he grows, she seems to resent him more and grow increasingly frustrated with him, and there is a moment of shocking physical abuse, which while being partially an accident, remains abuse nonetheless, but Kevin lies to hide his mother's culpability in this. These moments are interspersed with more glimpses of the future to come of tears and pain, and also Eva's present, which is seeing her older and obviously much more worn down by life. She is also a pariah. In an early scene, she is assaulted in broad daylight by another woman and when a witness of this assault comes to her aid, Eva denies any help, claiming that it was her fault, and in some ways, she's right.

What we as the audience are manuvered through here in this film is a mystery. What exactly happened to bring this attractive, wealthy and intelligent woman down to a woman who seems to be devoid of anything resembling happiness, wealth and why is she so hated in this community? When we first see her with Kevin, we see a woman who feels none of the natural maternal bond that one is supposed to feel with their child. We also see a child who is either responding to that lack of a bond, or a child who is already set on the road to becoming a psychopath. The mystery is in the unraveling of the events that lead to an emotionally terrifying climax, but smartly Ramsay keeps the more visceral parts to a minimum.

The idea of Eva being drenched in red throughout the film, whether from the paint, the lights outside a hotel window, the blinking of a digital clock or hiding in a grocery store against shelves of tomato sauce is obviously very deliberate since we are looking at a woman who sees her own hands as that of a modern Lady MacBeth; she has, from her own anger and disappointment and displeasure for her son, forged someone lethal and unable to form any real human emotions potentially because of the disconnect between them.

From a performance standpoint, Swinton is flawless as Eva. She always keeps the audience on their toes as to how to feel about her. It's a very complex character and our judgments about her are equally complex from the way that she plays it. Is she somehow as monstrous as he is? Since we only really see hints of her other relationships, most of her moments as far as with the family are with Kevin, and there is a resentment and a perhaps an absence of any connection with her son almost immediately; does Kevin somehow feed off of that and learn from their dynamic? Ezra Miller plays Kevin as a somewhat classical ""textbook"" psychopath; he has an air of superiority about himself, particularly with Eva. All of his emotional reactions seem to play somewhat falsely to her, if not immediately. But still there's an intensity of purpose in his glare and his constantly cocked head as if he's looking to understand what other's are feeling and see if he can duplicate it. Reilly honestly doesn't have much to do here other than be the nay-sayer who explains away all of Eva's concerns about Kevin as if there's nothing to worry about. This is a shame, because Reilly can be a pretty extraordinary dramatic actor and not just as a comic tool, as seen in some of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, and most recently in Roman Polanski's CARNAGE.

Lynne Ramsay has a wonderful sense of style to her direction, and she wisely uses her palette and she wisely works more with implication than outright observation. Knowing the novel from Lionel Shriver, she has taken something that would have been controversial simply for its subject matter and instead of playing at that angle, she pulls us into the film for the way in which it handles the characters. A lesser director would not have done the same.

The main reason I don't think this deserves a perfect review is while I understand that there is a good deal of unreality in the situations of this film, I find certain things and certain reactions difficult to believe. The film is highly stylized in a sort of hyper-realism, and perhaps I'm not seeing it for how it was created and more what I felt belonged.

Still, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is bound to affect people for years to come, and thanks to Ramsay's direction and the performances of Swinton and Miller, it's certainly one of the most unsettling films I've seen in years.",1339113600,4,5841,4.567748091603053
5076675,4,B007C3TVEY,"Trying to depict the state of mind of someone who is both emotionally and mentally unstable and suffering from the after effects of a tragic event is very difficult to achieve in a cinematic language but I think Lynne Ramsay has succeeded well here. From the disjointed and fractured chronological order to the arty and surreal tone of the main character's flashbacks and visions, you get a good sense of what it is perhaps this poor mother is going through. Her mind must be all over the place, burdened by guilt and the memories of her horrid time as the mother of her nasty son. The colour red is very prevalent throughout and is something she cannot escape, from the red paint that she is forever scrubbing from her house, hands and car windscreen to the bloodbath she has to bear witness to at the end and which she will forever blame herself. The guilt and living hell will be inescapable.

There is always a danger in these kinds of films (and books) that they may not be wholly psychologically accurate and raise more questions than they answer. This film, and I understand the book also, doesn't really attempt to answer the nature vs nurture question in any serious balanced way - and how could we expect it to, that is a realm for science and psychology and something which may take decades before they are able to arrive at a more definitive answer. But art has been this way for millennia, it rarely if ever provides answers to big questions but is more about offering up one's own assumptions or take on these issues and inspiring debate.

There is a hint of a suggestion in the film that the mother wasn't quite ecstatic at the idea of being a mother (the scene in the antenatal class where she doesn't seem particularly enthusiastic) but there is never really a suggestion that once the child is born that she is anything but a good mother. The film leans far more towards the suggestion that the child was born bad and there was absolutely nothing the mother could have done about it. We see her trying hard from an early age to bond with Kevin but he seems to somehow despise her and manipulate her emotions even from a very young age - and this is where I question the psychological accuracy? Is it possible for a young toddler under two years old to despise anything and understand how to manipulate emotions in a callous way?

And in this respect, we could see the film as simply a story about the fears of parenthood from the viewpoint from someone who is not yet a parent, i.e. what happens if I have a naturally bad child who I cannot control and have a positive effect on...? And so a psychologically accurate definitive account of the nature vs nurture is beside the point but rather a story that tries to represent these fears, however irrational and they may be, is what we are engaging with.",1339113600,,2820,4.514677103718199

We Need to Talk About Kevin is an enganging thriller about an interesting topic I was always curious about, parents raising a clinical psychopath. However We Need to Talk About Kevin is lauded as 'disturbing' when really it's just manipulative, similar to another recent horror film The Woman (where all white males are violent rapists). The start of the film is engaging, as I couldn't really tell why Tilda Swanston was being treated like s*** but as the film feeds you more and more info it becomes more apparent what happened. ALSO similar to the Woman, it gets more blatantly stupid and manipulative as it progresses.

Basically Kevin is a clinical sociopath from the start, the symptoms are there but in order for the script to work he has to be allowed to walk all over everyone in order to get away with it, new age parents must be eating this movie up. No one but Tilda Swanston picks up on his behaviors, even from birth Kevin is smart enough only to piss Tilda off and no one else. Even if he was so psychopathic that he was beyond help through meds and therapy the parents could've at least tried those options, but no, Kevin is a brilliant mastermind taking advantage of all the dummies in his life because that level of unrealism is 'disturbing' to some. So let's go over each character in the family and see why they're all wrong, stupid, and poorly written.

The Father- Played by John C. Reily (nice to see him doing drama again), the father is an oblivious Fred Flinstone-esque idiot that wants a friend more than a son. He doesn't notice any wrong behaviors about his son who can manipulate him 24/7 for 16 years, and doesn't believe his wife or even address her concerns about Kevin being a sociopath. Also when the daughter goes to the hospital for bleach that was obviously poured into her eye (she wasn't using eyedrops then) he was more concerned about Kevin not feeling guilty than anything else. Bad parenting + poor writing = disturbing.

Kevin- Kevin is a super-smart super-manipulative baby genius that has the ability to trick virtually everyone in the world except for his mother. Many times when he's with his dad he'll give an evil glance to Tilda, for no other reason than to show the audience that he's evil. If he was such a manipulative mastermind he wouldn't even need the spiteful glances, he was already doing a good job about ruining his mother's life. The writer/director must envy Kevin a bit since they clearly try to manipulate the audience and are getting away with it. He wasn't such a terribly written character though if you apply his sociopathy to him, however in a work of fiction Kevin is so manipulative/smart that he started from birth.

The Mom- And mother of the year Tilda Swanson, who wouldn't know discipline if it hit her like a truck. In multiple, MULTIPLE scenes Kevin will test his mom, talking back to her or breaking something she loves and she just stares at him and goes 'yes dear'. When Kevin goes into her map-room and destroys everything in there, she knows that he did it to spite her, but what does she do? She takes it out on the paint gun in front of him, not slapping the little brat and giving him no dinner that night. Then later in the film after he poured bleach in his sister's eye instead of daddy doofus wondering if Kevin feels guilty, they both should've had him checked out by a psychologist, mabye look into why blood was coming out of the garbage disposal which was around the same time Snuggles the gerbil went missing.

So many warning signs are blaring in the parent's faces and yet they take the worst possible decisions regarding their son, both ignoring his problem in their own way. So in that regard, I feel absolutely no sympathy for John C. Reily's fate, nor the hell that Tilda Swanston lived in after everything because she could've prevented it and had her son locked up or medicated years ago, or where she's living at she can just move. The only real victim in the family was the young daughter who was born into a family where the son's a psychopath and the parents are oblivious imbeciles.

So yeah, the production values are excellent, the acting is phenominal, the music is strange and eerie, but the decisions the characters made are just downright stupid. It's like watching a family stuck in a room with water filling up, and the door is right behind them to get out but they just ignore that door the whole time, making this movie an overall frustrating experience. Many people have noted that there's no point to this movie, and I'm inclined to agree with them, unless you want to see a movie lightly skim the surface of how a parent copes with dealing with a psychopath for a son. If you want to see a maternal horror movie, watch Rosemary's Baby, if you want a more realistic and less stupid portrayl of psychopaths, look into Snowtown, and if you want to see this overall story done better, watch The Omen.",1339027200,7,4938,4.579185520361991

The acting was actually pretty good, but WHY would ANYONE want to watch something so very depressing.  My husband and I agree completely with the prior reviewer who said ""we need to talk about getting our money back"".  Positively horrid movie.",1338854400,4,338,4.87719298245614
5076680,3,B007C3TVEY,"Although I was surprised at what the son ends up doing at school, it wasn't enough for me to give this movie more than 3 stars.  It is just an OK movie.  Things that kill the movie (no pun intended) are most definitely the soundtrack and the jump editing.  The lyrical content of the music is quite appropriate but the music itself is horrendously distracting and does not fit the mood of the movie nor any of the characters.  The editing style is nothing new, been there done that and I was glad that near the middle and end, they toned it down a bit and allowed each scene to somewhat breathe.  Another thing was, I kept waiting for this mother or this father to be real.  What mother would let a young child act the way this one does without ever once raising her voice or spanking or anyway in the least bit disciplining him.  Except for the one time she breaks his arm ""by accident"", she never once does any real parenting.  It's like watching someone act out one of these looney tunes liberal psychologist ""time out, don't hurt the kids"" BS methods of raising children.  In fact, if this were anything close to real life, when the kid starts to do somewhat right after she breaks his arm, that should have been a signal to mom and dad, that Kevin needs some constant attention by way of several ass whippings in order to make him behave.  Anyway, this movie is a bit boring, but it does have some redeeming value and is a decent enough flick to hold your attention if there is nothing else available to watch.  Otherwise, if you just have to watch a movie about evil children, The Good Son is a much better choice.",1338768000,2,1620,4.348837209302325
5076681,2,B007C3TVEY,"We Need To Talk About Kevin was one of the most disturbingly fascinating books I've ever read. I finally got to see it on DVD and was left terribly disappointed.

To be fair, I don't believe anyone could have done a film version justice. The book told the story entirely from inside Eva's head, and the reader viewed Kevin with the same confusion as she did. We wondered along with her, was Eva a horrible mother? Or was Kevin just ""born bad""? Each incident could be viewed from both sides of the equation as Eva turned it over in her mind, struggling to comprehend what led up to the school massacre.

We can't get inside Eva's head in a film, and can only witness her interactions with her son as outsiders. The complexity of their relationship is lost. We see Kevin as a bratty child and a sullen teenager, but honestly not all that different from a lot of other kids. It's therefore harder to empathize with Eva, and she comes off as a one-dimensional, resentful woman who didn't want a child and doesn't like the one she got. No wonder Kevin is so cold to her, and gravitates towards his father! The book showed far more depth to both characters' personalities.

The epistolary format of the book was something that could not have been easily translated to the screen, but it was a big part of what made the book so breathtaking, particularly at the end, when we realize why Eva is now estranged from her husband. The portrayal of Franklin, by the way, is one of the few things the film improved on. John C. Reilly made Eva's husband far more likable than the clueless dolt he was in the book, refusing to believe that his darling son could do wrong. I can not say the same for Tilda Swinton as Eva. I'm surprised at the rave reviews she received - I found her completely bland and emotionless.

Finally, I was disappointed by the glossing over of the actual massacre in the school gym. Not that I was looking forward to the gore, but Kevin's meticulous, finely-detailed planning of the ""big event"" in the book added to the horror and showed us what a twisted soul he really was.

The novel was a five star read. It really should have been left alone.",1338681600,12,2156,4.4481012658227845

5076683,5,B007C3TVEY,"A powerful and disquieting film, ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" jumps back and forth in time as it gradually tells the story of a family with a sociopathic son Kevin, the impact of his actions has on the survivor and in the wake of a horrible tragedy. The cast is marvelous with strong performances from Tilda Swindon as Eva Kevin's mother who never truly bonds with her son and John C. Reilly as Kevin's father who can only see the good in his son.

I will admit, of course, that I'm a bit biased when it regards this material with a family member who suffers from much of the same disorder as Kevin does although the outcome was not as tragic.

Director/co-writer Lynne Ramsey does a marvelous job with realizing the characters from Lionel Shriver's novel and helping her cast create realistic and tragic characters.

The Blu-ray receives an exceptionally good transfer nicely capturing the natural looking cinematography  handled by Seamus McGarvey. Detail and color remains strong throughout the presentation of the film. If you just want to watch the film in standard DVD I don't think it'll suffer but the Blu has superior depth, detail and color reproduction.

Audio has a nice, subtle surround mix that gradual envelopes the listener but keep in mind that this is a dialogue driven movie.

The special features a featurette ""Behind the Scenes of Kevin"" where the cast and crew get a chance to discuss the material and their approach to it. We also get some additional footage from the opening sequence at the tomato festival in Spain as well as an interview with actress Swindow from Telluride.

A disturbing but powerful drama driven by a number of great performances including Erza Miller as the teenage Kevin (although to all the actors who portray him--to their credit they are all great in their performances)and Tilda Swindon as his mother, ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" isn't a feel good movie but sometimes we need films like this to remind us of tragedy that sometimes embraces our lives without ever letting go.",1338595200,5,2028,4.793696275071634

As adapted for the screen by director Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear this story becomes a terrifyingly realistic exploration of the subject of inherent evil and the manner in which we deal with it. The film is particularly timely as we read almost daily of youngsters killing classmates in schools across the country. But first the story:

Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) is trying to piece together her life following the ""incident"". Once a successful travel writer, she is forced to take whatever job comes her way, which of late is as a clerk in a travel agency. She lives a solitary life as people who know about her situation openly shun her, even to the point of violent actions toward her. She, in turn, fosters that solitary life because of the incident, the aftermath of which has turned her into a meek and scared woman. That incident involved her son Kevin Khatchadourian (Ezra Miller as a teenager and Jasper Newell as a 6 year old and Rock Duer as a toddler), who is now approaching his eighteenth birthday. Eva and Kevin have always had a troubled relationship, even when he was an infant. Whatever troubles he saw, Franklin (John C. Reilly), Eva's complacent husband, just attributed it to Kevin being a typical boy. The incident may be seen by both Kevin and Eva as his ultimate act in defiance against his mother.

Ramsay tells her story in bits and pieces of a collage of moments from the birth of Kevin to his incarceration. For some this kind of non-linear story telling may be disconcerting, but for this viewer it seems like a close examination of the mind of a mother who simply cannot believe she has birthed and is raising a child who is the epitome of evil. The fact that we are aware of something hideous that has happened from the beginning does not get in the way of watching the slow maturation of Kevin - first as a constantly screaming infant to a maliciously bad little boy to a viciously cruel and evil teenager with whom his mother cannot connect except for one very telling instance when she reads the young Kevin `Robin Hood' and his arrows, at which point Kevin shows a degree of affection for Eva. That moment proves in retrospect to be the nidus for the horror that lies ahead. Yet to say more about the story wound diminish the impact one the viewer. Tilda Swinton is extraordinary in her role as is Ezra Miller. The film. At least, for this viewer, is a powerfully disturbing one and a very fine insight into how evil deeds can happen.

5076687,4,B007C3TVEY,"Movies about violent teenagers are a dime a dozen; very few have any real depth to them.  They tend to seek answers, or revel in the rebelliousness, or simply aim to shock.  Lynne Ramsay's WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, initial appearances notwithstanding, does not fit into this mold.  It is dark, yes--some of the imagery is disturbing, some of the cuts are hectic, but the intent/result is psychological, not visceral.  And the story is told in a nonlinear fashion; we don't even find out what Kevin did until the film's end, though we know it isn't good.  The technique, on behalf of screenwriter/director Ramsay, is effectively jarring: this is not an easy film to watch.

The story focuses on Eva (a haunting Tilda Swinton, giving an award-worthy performance), following her inner turmoil as she copes with the fact that she doesn't feel comfortable around her son (the maternal instinct is a target here, which adds to the element of discomfort).  Eva is human; this means she's not an entirely sympathetic character (in fact, I'll admit to absolutely loathing her in spots, which was the filmmakers' intent).  In fact, there are no truly sympathetic characters here: John. C. Reilly, as Kevin's father, does his nice guy thing, but with an edge: after all, he encourages some of his son's more violent behaviors.  The three actors playing Kevin at different ages (Rock Duer, Jaspar Newell, and Ezra Miller) are all fantastic, conveying Kevin as an almost despicable character.  (If the film has one major flaw, it's that younger Kevin comes across almost as preternaturally evil; while this is indeed left up in the air, there are several attempts to suggest that Kevin's actions are a result of his parenting, but this only really comes across--in the character anyways--with Miller's performance of a teenaged Kevin.)

This film will raise a few eyebrows and offend a few viewers; it proposes a lot of questions, presents several possible answers, and then steps back and says, ""Does the answer really matter after the fact?""  It doesn't judge (though it seems to in the first 30 minutes or so); it inhabits a firmly gray area, placing the final verdict in the viewers' hands.  It's certainly not a conventional film; in the ""making of"" doc, one individual describes it as a ""psychological horror"" film, and that term hits the mark, but doesn't quite cover it.  It may be up to each individual viewer to determine what genre WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN falls into, but there's no denying that is a powerful, disturbing film.",1338422400,,2532,4.885514018691588
5076688,4,B007C3TVEY,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a 2011 British-American drama directed by Lynne Ramsay.  It follows Eva, played by Tida Swinton, as she struggles against the current that is her impassive and morbidly troubled son, Kevin.  Sharply wrought, I've not seen a film this striking in long while.

I read the novel late last year and appreciated the idea but became disenchanted with the author by the book's end.  Her expansive vocabulary and scathingly written protagonist were initially addictive but I never quite was able to step out of the author and into her story - she reads as a bit pretentious and I wasn't entirely convinced that this was a character design.  Thus, it was occasionally tiring but I stuck it out and felt rewarded for doing so.  Fat trimmed, Shriver's story is uniquely disturbing and houses a startling conclusion that screamed to be stamped forever on celluloid.  Thankfully, the director's translation is exceptional.  I'm not familiar with Ramsay's work but I plan to be.  She cooked the novel down to its most fundamental elements and then handed it back in better shape than she found it.  The dialogue is minimal, the camerawork gorgeous, and the soundtrack is oddly brilliant.

Call it a thriller.  I'm in.

First and foremost, Eva was cast exceptionally well.  The part called for a woman worn and skeletal Tida Swinton's bulbous fish pupils bored through the role as if the character was written for her specifically.  Eva birthed a monster and Swinton exemplified the weight of this load beautifully.  They couldn't have found a more haunting actress; she absolutely made this film.

I was also impressed with Ezra Miller as Kevin.  There were two children cast to play Kevin in his younger years and they stared as menacingly as needed, but it was Ezra that brought a chilled and convincing depth to the character.  His involvement here was a treat and I'll be watching for his future roles.

The one actor I wasn't particularly impressed with, however, was John C. Reilly as Franklin.  I understand that he was drafted to play the naive' husband and father, but he just felt dopey and unbelievable to me.  I realize that they wanted to pull in a main name for the role, but I think he hurt the film by detracting from its focal point.  Someone with a lesser name, in my opinion, would have been a better fit.  Reilly's inclusion is my sole reason for not giving this film 5 stars.

Still, if you're considering the purchase and are interested in the content, just do it.  This film's genre, often built clumsily around its little sociopaths, is dominated largely by blatant characters and flagrantly repetitive themes.  And it's getting old.  ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a step in a more admirable direction.  Without giving the story away, I'll advise that the subject matter is relevant and certainly worth your time.  I would warn you, however, that the synopsis attached doesn't quite convey how unsettling the content actually is.  The violence is subtle and tastefully executed but there are a few graphic scenes, so you're aware.  If you're hoping only for a poignant drama, proceed with caution.

But I do highly recommend watching this movie - its message is sensational.

Thank you for your time.

Not like some, I do not blame the mother, she tried to bond with him but was unable to because his genetic makeup was just that way. I had the feeling though when Kevin was affectionate with his father it was just a facade, he did not like his father either, or sister, or anyone.

5076690,5,B007C3TVEY,"I took this movie to be about the budding and full night-blooming of a psychopath, and how the presence of such an individual affects a family. From infancy on, Kevin has an instinct for inflicting an endless series of sadisms, aimed particularly at his mother. This movie shows the ominous growth of his malignancy.

But this movie is more subtle and realistic than other shockers about ""The Good Son"" who is really oh-so-bad. This film portrays an animus that I felt really could exist in the heart of a warped individual. This becomes a fascinating study in how family dynamics get defined by the most perverse member of that family.

After the shocking inflictions of Kevin though, this DVD gave me another, perhaps even more unsettling shock when I listened to the interview bonus features on it. The majority of people involved with the making of this movie put the blame for Kevin's maladjustment directly on his mother, played with such stark effect by Tilda Swinton! Producer, director, and Swinton herself, generally seemed to be saying that Kevin's predations were caused by his mother's initial reluctance about her pregnancy, and then her subsequent ""lack of authenticity"" as a parent. What?!

This attitude among presumably modern people is a throwback to the days when mothers (usually mothers) were blamed for children's autism, schizophrenia, or Tourette 's syndrome. The mothers were accused of being overbearing, or alternately, too indulgent. I felt strongly that it was no failure in parenting that planted the bad seed in the heart of Kevin. In this sense, the producer/director's harsh judgment on the mother reflect the same  ill-informed, almost lynch-mob-like blame that the film shows the townspeople casting on Swinton's character as a result of her son's ultimate actions. All this adds to the weight the mother in this film, and beleaguered mothers everywhere, still must bear.

It's true that Swinton is shown looking bleak and at a loss directly after Kevin's birth. In the early silences of the film, we see the mother harkening back to her glamorous days apparently as an acclaimed writer and a globe-trotter - reveling in places such as the annual tomato-throwing festival in Bunol, Spain. (The film's symbolism and premonition is a little obvious here, opening as it does on Swinton being splattered by, drowning in, the blood-red tomato puree of the festival.)

But really, a mother's being ambivalent about a pregnancy and having some, perhaps transient, sense of a descending bleakness, hardly gives rise to a psychopath!

In addition to being about something other than what its producers think it's about, this film seemed to me to perhaps make a few cinematic missteps. After that over-the-top obviousness of the tomato festival, Swinton is shown in a series of overly arty shots, sterilized, pinioned against exaggerated backdrops, such as a Warhol-like grocery shelf full of red soup cans. The psychology of Kevin's malevolence also seems off. PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT! Kevin's bedwetting, general incontinence, cruelty to animals, and calculated sadisms are generally more predictive of someone becoming a serial killer rather than committing the kind of horror Kevin ends up committing. END OF SPOILER.

For me though, the film overall succeeds brilliantly at portraying the development of a child who, for some unfathomable reason, embodies the heart of darkness - and the clenched suffering his family must bear as a result.",1338422400,,3469,5.193202146690519
5076691,5,B007C3TVEY,"You will not forget this movie. It is one of the best works of fiction s well as cinematography I have ever seen. It tackles social issues that are rarely touched because too taboo, such as the complexity of motherhood, including NOT liking a child -- an entirely possible and human feeling which is inadmissible and unspeakable in the current culture of idealized and sanctified supermothers--  and the true disconnect between spouses who cannot see their child in the same way. The titular Kevin, whom the parents fail to talk about, represents what Hannah Arendt would call the banality of evil. Evil just because. A force that cannot be explained, and is born to regular people who love each other every day.
This is a brutal movie, yet full of understanding about the human condition, in all its many nuances. The very understanding that psychiatry tries to capture and explain, yet always misses.

5076694,3,B007C3TVEY,"This is, no doubt, a beautifully filmed movie with a couple of actors that carry their parts to the moon. Tilda Swinton has more than proved herself in other movies and moves herself up the ladder here. Ezra Miller, the young man who so menacingly plays the teenage son was brilliant. Undoubtedly, we will see much more of him.

The back and forth in timelines was seamless and not a bit confusing. Lynne Ramsay, who years ago, brought us the imagery of 'The Ratcatcher', uses what almost feels like a thematic montage with only a unity of the color red as film gets going. But, soon the message of motherhood vs. troubled child is underway. Foreshadowing in the color red is heavy handed, yet balanced with fact that there is no graphic violence. Interesting. Artsy. Hhhmmmm... I felt like I was standing back, studying a work by an artist that had just about, almost...got it.

Unfortunately, people have come away from this expounding age old discourses and dissertations for or against 'Nature/Nurture'. Useless! This film keeps this question quite neutral, in my opinion. And, I think that is a good thing. This film should be judged by it's form, it's beauty, and even the emotion it has or has not engendered. Instead, reviewers are skipping to issues of science and heart.

Please don't believe I haven't an opinion about Nature/Nurture. I do! But, a movie review is not the place.  3 1/2",1338163200,4,1396,4.756198347107438
5076695,5,B007C3TVEY,"Please don't read any spoilers for this film -- the way it unfolds, it's like a mystery and you slowly get the picture of what happened.  It's a story about true, real-life evil in the world. After watching this movie, I was so shaken up I couldn't get up off the couch to turn it off and sat through the entire credits...I was just numb.

I consider this a horror movie, but there is no gore and no demons or supernatural monsters.  Just evil manifesting itself through the years...showing signs it's developing...and then finally erupting.

I can't remember the last movie that was so thought-provoking.  Tilda Swinton should have won all the acting awards for this one -- and the young boy who plays her son (not the teenager, but the younger version of him), was phenomenal.  If you remember The Omen and how creepy that kid playing Damien was in the original 1970s version...this boy is even more creepy. You just know something is wrong with him, and I found myself almost screaming at the TV for someone to see the signs and stop him before something awful happened.

I've always wondered what happens to the parents of evil people after they've been caught -- what are their lives like in the aftermath? The newspapers never tell you that.  This movie sheds some light on it, and it's truly a new circle of Hell.

I highly recommend that you do not watch this movie if you need to wake up early and go to work in the morning. The movie will leave you numb, horrified, and maybe a little depressed. It is not a fun date night movie. The kind of horror this is is not the Scream or Friday the 13th variety...it is somber, sober, and plays out slowly...building to the horrible conclusion you know is coming.  It's the kind of movie that you either watch alone or with someone who you know you can have a good discussion with when it's over.  It is not a movie to watch with a bunch of friends at a party.

I bet I won't be able to watch this again for another 10 years. I also won't be able to ever read anything about any sort of tragedy without thinking of this movie...and what happens to the families of the people who caused the tragedy.

Don't be afraid of blood and gore because there is none -- but please be cautioned that this is seriously deep emotional stuff and the depiction of growing evil in this movie is unsettling, terrifying, and gut-wrenching.",1338163200,31,2370,4.458333333333333

5076697,5,B007C3TVEY,"We Need to Talk About Kevin, based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, is more startling and horrifying than any modern horror film from any recent year, despite being categorized as a drama. I hope I'm not spoiling anything by saying that the story shares narrow similarities with another 2011 drama called Beautiful Boy, a film that showed parents dealing with grief and guilt after their son massacres his school. I expected the two films to be similar, but all similarities stop there. While Beautiful Boy was a gentle, powerful film, it doesn't hold a candle to the psychological trauma delivered by this; it's less glossy and almost immediately more affecting. This is the third film by Scottish film director Lynne Ramsay, who has met with acclaim for her previous films but has never made a film with this much impact on critics and audiences. We Need to Talk About Kevin is still far from being widely seen, but you'll gather from the reviews that those who have seen it have struggled to shake it from their mind. This is not an easy film to watch, but it's unforgettable once you have.

Promotional materials, reviews, and synopses have made no secret that Kevin will ultimately commit a massacre at his school, yet this still feels like a minor spoiler. Even if you're aware of this, you won't be prepared for exactly what happens and I urge you to avoid anything that fully discloses the details. The film unfolds with a fragmented timeline, all over the place in terms of chronology. When we first meet Eva (Tilda Swinton), her home and car have been vandalized with red paint. Her neighbors and nearly everyone she encounters are cold to her, if not outright vitriolic. She's assaulted by a random woman on the street only minutes after getting a job at a small travel agency. As she tries to cope, we see her life in flashbacks, beginning with when she met Franklin (John C. Reilly) and became pregnant unexpectedly. When Kevin is born, there's a strong implication that Eva didn't want him and was indifferent to his birth. There's also the implication that Kevin may have been born evil, crying incessantly as a baby and exhibiting sociopathic tendencies and a distinct detachment from his mother as he grows older. Eva is disturbed by this, but unable to find someone to relate as Franklin is oblivious to Kevin's ways.

Kevin is portrayed as a toddler, a young child, and a teenager by three different actors with the former two giving some of the best onscreen performances by a child I can readily recall. Rock Duer has little dialogue as the toddler Kevin, but his evil stare gives the film one of its most chilling moments. It's difficult for a child actor to give such a vacant stare without seeming laughable, but Duer just seethes evil in this scene. Jasper Newell as the younger Kevin has more screen time and makes Ezra Miller's eventual transition to teenager Kevin more easily believable. Both Duer and Newell deserve special recognition for how memorably creepy they inhabit these roles, making Kevin one of the most sinister children ever portrayed onscreen. More effective yet is that they're playing a human, where the typical sinister child of filmdom ends up being the antichrist or a victim of Satanic possession. We'll get to Ezra Miller later.

Where Beautiful Boy was more linear, dealing with the parents more than the child in a more accessible fashion, We Need to Talk About Kevin is the more thought-provoking, haunting, and ultimately profound film in the way it deals with Eva and Kevin's relationship, tapping deeper into the psychology of both characters. In typical indie-fashion, it doesn't spoon-feed anything and the psychological nature is kept sufficiently ambiguous to provoke discussion. One of the most revealing conversations in the film comes when Eva tells Kevin that she's expecting another child. ""You'll like it,"" she assures him. ""What if I don't like it?"" he asks. ""You'll get used to it."" ""Getting used to it doesn't mean you'll like it. You're used to me."" This is heavy dialogue for such a young actor to deliver and Newell's naturalism makes it one of the most powerful moments in the film.

Ezra Miller gives a powerful, genuinely scary performance as the teenaged Kevin. A relative newcomer with gorgeously sculpted features and piercing eyes, he'll be a household name if he continues choosing notable roles. This performance isn't filled with teenage angst, but pure apathy and evil, an uncommonly scary and pitch-perfect performance, especially for such a new actor. He deserves Academy recognition, as he makes Kevin one of the best onscreen psychopaths since Hannibal Lecter. Reilly takes a backseat to Swinton and Miller, but he's more potent than he was in Carnage, his other dramatic role of note in 2011. As for Swinton, they should've handed her the Academy Award as I didn't personally see a better performance by an actress last year. It's a soul-baring, yet understated and remarkably nuanced performance that covers a lot of emotional ground and provides us a thorough rendering of an emotionally complicated character. Swinton is already an Oscar winner (for Michael Clayton), but this blows that performance out of the water. There is no flamboyant ""acting moment"" that allows her to go for maximum emotional effect and get people to take notice. She handles this role with complete subtlety and grace, yet it's earth-shattering.

Ramsay has a firm grasp on the film's tone. Along with Jonny Greenwood serving as the composer of the score, Ramsay incorporates some very innocent-sounding songs into a frightening context, a move which parallels the character of Kevin. This is only one of the impressive creative flourishes, with the color red serving as a nightmarish motif that's just as ambiguous as some of the motives of the characters. Ramsay pulls no punches as a filmmaker and We Need to Talk About Kevin is a harsh film that avoids sugarcoating or sensationalizing the subject matter. It also doesn't make it easy for us to choose a place to invest our empathy. It naturally draws our attention to the inherent evil within Kevin and thoroughly shows his lack of empathy from a young age, meanwhile showing Eva as a woman doing her best raising him despite not having strong maternal feelings. At the same time, the film forces us to consider that Kevin is a child and Eva is a rather selfish parent. The aftermath that she deals with evokes empathy certainly, but the film poses a lot of moral questions for the audience. Was Kevin born evil? Or did his mother's indifference towards his life cause him to develop an indifference towards the lives of others? Why is she the one who is ultimately punished, yet spared by Kevin?

It's profoundly thought-provoking, going more in-depth showing possible scenarios that lead to the ultimate tragedy without giving a definitive answer that can't possibly exist. The final scene is a cinematic stranglehold that does the best job of any film on this subject illustrating the lack of conclusion anyone is able to come to about why this massacre occurred. It's this moment that really nails down what other films have tried and failed to explore; that ultimately, nothing can be said about it. It has more finality than the ambiguous way Gus San Sant tried to make this same statement in Elephant, but I think it ultimately leaves more questions for us.

We Need to Talk About Kevin is a dark, absorbing film that is poetic, violent, moving, and horrifying. Ramsay is a brave director, able to provoke emotion by showing very little and then rocking our emotions when she chooses to show a little more. The entire massacre scene unfolds in a staggering way that is frightening and unexpected, but never exploitative. It's a difficult film, but it's one of the best, most memorable of 2011. Films don't get more powerful than this.

5076698,5,B007C3TVEY,"This film is so amazing .
Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller were so  invested in their roles it was impossible to take your eyes off of them. It felt like a time bomb that you knew was going to go off but you never knew when, how or how big of a bang it would be.

The character of Kevin 'Ezra Miller' was one of the most chilling characters I have seen in a film in years and the fact that he was basically a kid made it all the more freaky.

The story played out in three different time frames going back and forth from one to the other. Some people felt put out by this but I like this type of film  in the vein of Pulp Fiction.
You basically know the majority of what is going to happen at the climax but then again I wasn't ready for all of it.

It's a very tense ,taunt thriller that will keep your interest and on the edge of your seat.

There are several seemingly simple scenes that made me cry which was genius on the part of the director such subtle touches but so effective. I give this the ultimate thumbs up..",1337817600,3,1019,3.9705882352941178
5076699,5,B007C3TVEY,"Spoiler alert: While I've left out the pivotal events in this film, the details I've included may seem like spoilers so read this one at your own risk. I'd certainly welcome feedback about whether I gave too much away in this review. You might want to read it after seeing the film and answer some of the questions brought up in this review.

This is the kind of movie that is not only highly controversial but likely to split viewers into the ""love it"" or ""absolutely hate it"" camp. Those who hate it are likely to find it beyond disturbing and actually loathsome.

But  I was very eager to see this movie. If you've already viewed the film you might well wonder why.  The major reason was because I'd read the book on which this film is based and it haunted me.

The movie is a very dark tale of one family and the way a difficult child can divide husband and wife as well as derail one mother's life. But is she to blame? I don't think so. Others may disagree. Instead, I think the film explores the age old question of nature versus nurture and how that affects moral development.

From the outset, it is clear that Kevin and his mother, played by Tilda Swinton, seem to be at odds with each other. Why this is the case is less clear although some reviewers have felt that Kevin's mother is to blame for his chillingly cold heart.

A crucial part of the movie resides in the last few sentences spoken by Kevin, shortly before the fiilm credits roll. If there is any hopeful note (and that is subject to interpretation) it is at that point in the movie.

I wish I could write those words here but that would rob potential viewers of a riveting moment, what I consider the key to the theme of the movie. Listen to Kevin and you might even feel some sympathy for him, some sense of a person who may be as lost to himself as to his family.

Not  all lives are sunny and there are not always pat endings as films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabbit-Hole/dp/B004AE3QYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabbit Hole</a>&nbsp;and others which explore painful family events make clear. In Rabbit Hole, Nicole Kidman did a stellar job showing how one woman dealth with the loss of a child.

In We Need to Talk About Kevin, Tilda Swinton mines the depths of pain just as Kidman did in Rabbit Hole - although the family dynamics are far different. Swinton shows a woman who starts out with hope, giddily falls in love, gets pregnant and then goes on to have a life far different than she could possibly imagine. It could happen to many of us. Perhaps that also adds to the difficulty in sitting through this film. It made me squirm uncomfortably in my chair but it also made me want to know more about the mother and son at the heart of the movie.

Swinton's character forced me to face the fact that even as we deny the reality, the truth is that our lives can change drastically in one moment and that horrific moment can change our lives for years - if not for the rest of our lives. .

The lives portrayed here seemed very real. I could imagine a family where one child remained a mystery. It is hard to see this one and not wonder if the conscience is formed even before birth or whether parents have much impact on that. In short, is it genes or environment that affects personality most - a question that has been asked for years.

I was awestruck by the imagery and camera work in We Need to Talk About Kevin. Many scenes are stunners simply because of a particular angle and some of the close-ups seem like artistic works, often ominous but portraying shocking events without graphic detail (although there are exceptions). Some of the most violent events have to be reconstructed in the viewers' imaginations.

For those who believe Kevin's mother is at the root of his problems consider these questions:

1. Why is the mother able to conceive, bear and nurture  a loving daughter?

2. Could a difficult pregnancy and uncomfortable feelings actually be a foreboding of things to come or was there a true mismatch between mother and son? Or did mother turn against Kevin when her infant turned out to be exhausting and overwhelmed her? For that matter, did she ever turn against him or just grow disheartened as her attempts to reach him  seemed doomed.

3. How and why are husband and wife so split in their feelings about Kevin? Are they both in denial or do they each have a truly different relationship with their son?

4. Could anything have changed the outcome? Was there anything Kevin's mother could have done differently to change her son for the better? Or was the outcome fated almost from the day Kevin was born?",1337731200,7,4669,4.574340527577938

In this case, the director's heavy-handed use of cutaways and jumbled chronology drag down an otherwise brilliant film. (I was reminded, both in methodology and in the use of symbolism, of Lars Von Trier's Antichrist, though mercifully without all the gore.) Tilda Swinton is pitch-perfect as the mother of a young sociopath, and the film wisely refrains from pat judgments or tidy explanations as to whether or not her chilly attitude toward her firstborn affects his descent into evil. For a movie about such horrific events, very little violence is shown on-screen, which makes the climax of the film much more terrifying and effective than a simple bloodbath could have done. All these wisely thought-out decisions make the cumbersome stylistic elements yet more frustrating. This could have been, and should have been, a five star film.",1337731200,,990,5.272151898734177

The movie attempts to create psychologically thrilling scenes, but what it really amounts to is pulling some ideas from a psychology case study and piecing them together to make a movie. For instance, Kevin is not a very believable character. He does things and the viewer is left with no idea why other than some text book snippets thrown into the movie at random.

5076709,4,B007C3TVEY,"The film begins with a strange, slow-motion pan of the La Tomatina (tomato) festival in Spain. As you look closely it reveals a certain amount of social anarchy: violence, public sex, etc. Or a hint of them, anyway. And towards the end of the scene we see Swinton reveling in it all, embracing it wholeheartedly. A look of supreme bliss on her face. This is the only glimpse we get of her character as the ""famed world adventurer"" she is supposed to be. Immediately afterwards she finds herself pregnant and extremely resentful of that fact.

This movie attempts to delve into the ""nature vs. nurture"" argument of what makes a child grow up to become a cold-hearted killer. It is obvious from the beginning that Swinton's character hates the restrictions that being pregnant and then a new mother has placed on her. She is no longer able to follow her heart's desire and travel the world on a whim. When the child is born she resents him to such an extent that she is unable to bond with her baby and it is left to the father (John C. Reilly) to give the child all of the affection and love he will ever receive. As the little boy grows up we see the anger and resentment toward his mother grow day by day, sowing the seeds for psychopathy. In my opinion, it is not a case of one or the other. Not nature vs. nurture, but a combination of the two. A perfect storm, if you will, of circumstance and genetics that creates a child capable of murder.

Swinton gives a finely nuanced performance as the reluctant mother who resents her child and despises herself for it. As the years go by we see her painful, awkward attempts to connect with her son only to be rebuffed by the child who becomes increasingly angry and disturbed. John C. Reilly is good as the father with blinders on. Ezra  Miller gives a solid performance as the anti-social teenaged son. But it is newcomer Jasper Newell who gives a standout performance as Kevin in his early years. The animosity he feels as Kevin toward his mother is palpable and comes across as very real.",1337472000,4,2039,4.475806451612903
5076710,4,B007C3TVEY,"First off, I love Tilda Swinton. She always fully and intensely inhabits her roles, and she did so again in this film, which in turn stays very true to the book of the same name. As is almost always the case, the book goes into much greater depth, but the film still does a good job of capturing the essence of the story. It is shot in an extremely fragmented manner, both visually and chronologically speaking, but since I was already familiar with the story, I could be a little off in my assessment that this constant back and forth still makes sense as the film progresses, although even I was beginning to tire of it about a third of the way into the film. However, I recognized that Kevin's mother could not escape from her shattered existence, so I understood the need for this disorienting (and effective) camerawork/editing. While they never do completely abandon this format--still flashing forward in time and back again occasionally--the film does settle down a bit towards the middle and spares us the constant freneticism of the jump cuts that marks its start. Another reviewer also rightly pointed out the overt symbolism that occurs throughout the film from its very start: smashed tomatoes; oozing red jam; spattering red paint: we get it.

The film, as did the book, will definitely spark conversations regarding nature versus nurture. I tend to think that both factors are at work, both in this story and in real life, and again, both film and book do a good job of depicting that, although since it is my understanding that film & book are works of fiction, I tend to wonder if the depiction of Kevin isn't a little TOO evil, right from the start. When I read the book (and the film carries this over), I almost felt like it provided the kind of pat answer we all want to hear about the whys of what motivates the kids who show up to school and mow their classmates down one day: because they're bad seeds from the outset. I kind of think it may be a little bit more complicated than that. It might be even scarier for us to think that they were in any way normal, ever. Watching this movie, any of us can watch Kevin and see immediately that there's something wrong with him. It's the fact that we can't predict who might be the next killer that scares us.",1337385600,7,2277,4.513317191283293
5076711,5,B007C3TVEY,"A mother copes with a son who is a sociopath in the making. In infancy he's colicky, as a toddler he is unresponsive and torpid, as a child he is manipulative and conniving, as a teenager he is sadistic and dangerous.

The movie is deftly plotted via present day encounters, dream states and flashbacks. The cinematography is sinuous and vicerally symbolic; and instead of being sinister and foreboding, the soundtrack is often quirky and purposefully inappropriate.  It's told completely from the mother's point of view. We are in her head, not Kevin's, which is probably the scarier place to be. As the Mother Tilda Swinton is front and center in every scene and her portrayl is quietly tragic and nothing short of flawless. Ezra Miller is chilling as Kevin. This all makes for a pitch perfect psychological drama like none other.

The film opens in a dream state with the mother in a place that looks like hell. In reality that's exactly where she is. Her life is never-ending game of cat and mouse, of which her son  always has the upper hand. He's smart beyond his years, and he's always one step ahead.  Any signs of being loving, happy or normal are carefully calculated by Kevin. He knows how to use a toilet, but won't. Wearing a diaper way beyond diaper years and crapping his pants during playtime with Mommy is a psychological weapon. He speaks only in biting laconic outbusts. He spits on the lunch Mom made him, and paintballs Mom's ""special room."" Mom may be cold. She tries. But she has a child who cannot be bargained with using straight talk nor nurtured with patience and understanding. He exists simply to torment.

The father is rarely around and chooses to ignore that his son is deeply disturbed. ""He's a child, boys will be boys,"" his wife ""should get help."" Kevin knows this and uses it to his advantage. He has no problem turning on the charm with Dad, because Mom is the real target. Dad buys son an archery set to ""bond"". Kevin practices and hones his skill. His  targets of choice multiply and he hits them with tragic precision.

Present day revolves around the aftermath of a catastrophic event orchestrated by Kevin. As the movie stays in Mom's point of view, we don't see the tragic event as it happened. There are no over the top bloody images, nor screaming people pleading for their lives, and few corpses. It's only by seeing how the Mom is ostracized in her community that we understand the magnitude of what Kevin did. While she is slapped across the face, cursed at and vandalized, her son escapes exposure and is devoid of shame. In serial killer fashion, he's happy to claim rockstar status in his notoriety.  He's a minor and he used a `Prozac made me do it' defense. And if he really is an unrepenting sociopath, either born or bred, regret and a rationale will never come to be. So it's Mom who really suffers the consequences and shoulders the blame out in society and in her own being. Once again she is the ultimate target. Once again, the son has won.",1337385600,2,3000,4.613508442776736
5076712,5,B007C3TVEY,"Like others have mentioned, the warning about how disturbing this film is cannot be underestimated.

But I rated it 5 stars because, unlike so many films about spree killers, it takes no moral stand. It simply shows the potential effects of such psychoses on everyone, but particularly on the immediate, surviving family.

I will disagree with the other reviewers here about feelings of holding the mother partially responsible. I believe this film shows the very real probability that the mother merely reacts to the obviously errant development of the child who becomes a psychotic killer. She does, indeed, seek help. Only to be rebuffed by doctors and experts; labeled as an hysterical mother.

As a student of neuropsychology, and a long-term ponderer of the psychology of those who kill, I have come to believe that the biology of the brain of these kinds of killers is congenital. Genetic? Maybe. Maybe not.  But inborn? Positively.

And this film explores that possibility. Tilda Swinton plays the hapless mother of the congenitally disturbed Kevin and does so brilliantly. Her character's growing fear of the title character, who plays her against her husband's life of denial (Reilly, played perfectly), is palpable. This grittily realistic woman makes you ponder how you would handle such a difficult reality.

Of course, that is exactly the point, in my opinion. My heart breaks for her, as she lives out the consequences of ignorance in the public, who blame her for her son's evil acts. Personally, my opinion is that no matter how lurid the childhood of killers, it is nature (in the formation of the physical brain), not nurture (in the rearing), that creates a killer such as Kevin.

Too many children have been raised with horrors far beyond those this title character endures; yet they do not kill. It seems to me this film points out that Kevin was born with no capacity for empathy, and, worse, with a keen appetite for torture.  Particularly satisfying to him is the torture of his mother. It is disturbing in the extreme to see how well he ultimately conquers her completely.  And in stealing from her a peaceful life, he condemns her to a fate worse than his own in prison.

In the end, it asks us to ponder how we would feel if it happened to us. Which causes much discomfort, because of the protective mechanism in our minds that leads us to find reasons it could not happen to us. But maybe it can.",1337385600,31,2425,4.8076923076923075
5076713,5,B007C3TVEY,"Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher, Morvern Callar) directs We Need to Talk about Kevin, an obsessive little film that explores the darker psychological side of motherhood. Anxieties about the developing relationship between mother and child, natural love and obligation, burgeoning personhood (read here daemonhood), gender and the culture of violence are fully realized in this maternal nightmare.

The film is fractured, image-driven, and every frame feels Composed. The color red is always prominent. Elements and concepts repeat: slivers of bitten nails, laid out on a table are, later, eggshells pulled from the mouth and placed on a bowl's edge. Visual symbolism is heavy (the aforementioned shells begin as an entire carton of maliciously crushed eggs, which are none-the-less scrambled and eaten), and it helps if you like that sort of thing. Also worth mentioning are the darkly funny moments scattered throughout Kevin, which are visual and discreet, or owing to the stellar, unexpected soundtrack.

The performances alone are enough reason to see We Need to Talk about Kevin, especially if you are a fan of the ""bad seed"" genre, or thrillers in general--Tilda Swinton is at turns radiant and haggard, empathetic and pitiable; Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller are cold and gorgeous monsters; John C. Reilly is so subtle he disappears in the role--but ""enjoying"" it requires the viewer's surrender to the emotional landscape, which is somewhat bleak. I held my daughter close after this one; I told her she was an angel, and that she'd never done a wrong thing.",1337299200,3,1558,5.253012048192771
5076714,5,B007C3TVEY,"Ok I keep stopping and restarting and erasing what I wrote. This movie is as stated very disturbing, not in graphic images, but in implied emotions, and happenings.

The movie starts out really slow and disjointed, much like the review I am trying to get out. When it starts it has that artsy European feel to it. It goes back and forth and is somewhat confusing - stick it out, it gets better. This is very disturbing subject matter, and I wouldn't recommend anyone under 13 watch it for sure, and maybe older.
Potential spoilers below.

I think the movie eloquently shows the horror of what a Mother goes through in the after math of a huge tragedy. Unlike many movies that show you what is to be the obvious victim people care about - this takes on (very well) the less easy to identify with Mother of the Mass Murderer. What she goes through as she knows there is something wrong with her child, and the aftermath of the tragedy.

The casting of Kevin was perfect in all the ages. It was heartbreaking to watch. I think this is a movie where 10 people can see it and have completely different views on it. Some will think it was the mothers fault, others will think Kevin was completely at fault, others will see it as no one caught it. The interesting thing is not everyone will be able to come to the same conclusion.

So my review is I hated this movie because it was so real. But I loved this movie for making me think and be better able to empathize as a human. I kind of thought the Mom was always a weirdo, but the more I think on it the more I think there is so much that happened that was not shown. I kind of thought Mom should have taken the kid to psychiatrist, curious to know what others felt. The one thing I don't doubt is that you will feel something.

Why 5 stars?  It isn't often a movie haunts me like this one did, and I appreciate having a different way to look at things.",1337299200,8,1898,4.2292817679558015

5076716,3,B007C3TVEY,"Getting around to watching ""We Need to Talk ABout Kevin"" I didn't hear many people talking about this one.  To watch it finally it definetly will chill you to the bone and upset many viewers with how one child could cause so much havoc to his mother and manipulate his way around his behavior.  The character of Kevin is the classic socipath from the moment of birth.  He has his father wrapped around his finger and many of his tactics tends to go undisciplined by his father.  Kevin even goes as far to harm his own little sister at times.  The movie definetly isn't over-the-top with the violence in the sense of you won't see an epic blood bath like many thrillers/horrors films to give many viewers what they want.  I will also say if you are one for dialogue, WNTTAK is far and between, it's almost close to being a silent picture.  Overall I found the picture to be worth the watch, whether slow paced.  You will definetly feel pain for the mother you see her handle life past and present and towards the end you will also feel for Kevin(even though he does deserve every ounce his punishment).

5076717,5,B007C3TVEY,"Emotionally devastating, and featuring the female performance of 2011 in Tilda Swinton, who opens a side to her that I had never seen before. Working off a script that's largely dialogue sparse, heavy on dramatic symbolism and non-linear in its story, the movie becomes a fever dream of real-life, domestic horror. The dramatic arc is inevitable from the beginning, but still manages to pack a surprising punch. Not recommended for would-be or soon-to-be parents, though! Or maybe it should be?",1335484800,4,494,5.1875
5076718,5,B007C3TVEY,"True artistry and deeply felt acting propel the quiet drama of WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, a film about a boy who goes on a killing spree at his school. The son of Eva, a successful travel writer, and Franklin, a rather dopey and ineffectual husband, Kevin (played masterfully by three different young men, most notably the teen, Ezra Miller) is cold and intransigent. Even as a baby, he screams so relentlessly that Eva pauses by men working jack hammers just to get away from the noise of her son.

The film is a menagerie of flashbacks, hazy images, and even segments that play very much like music videos. The tale jumps back and forth between Eva's current life as an ostracized (and often attacked) woman who can barely find a job (she wakes up to find her house covered in slashes of red paint, a color that is totemic for the film), and her previous life as a well-to-do mother and wife. As Eva struggles to live as a social pariah, she recounts the steps that led to Kevin's unthinkable behavior.

The film is a pastiche of explanations and questions. It shows Eva experiencing not-so-motherly bursts of resentment toward her infant son. It also shows that son as being preternaturally smart and malicious. Eva is haunted constantly by the fear that she is not doing enough as a mother, but also that there is nothing she can do. The idea of Nature vs. Nurture is talked about a lot in connection with this movie, and for good reason, but it doesn't really seem like much of a debate in the film. Kevin, it seems, is clearly evil from the get-go.

The real power of the film lies in Swinton's fascinating portrayal of the harried and horrified Eva. The boys who play Kevin in his various incarnations are all equally good, although -- as the one with the most screen time and lines -- Ezra Miller also shines. The complexity of Eva's relationship with her son is riveting, especially the parts of that relationship that manifest themselves after Kevin reveals his true nature to the world. Even knowing about and anticipating Kevin's murderous future does not diminish the impact of that moment of the film. I, for one, had my mouth hanging open. Even so, after that moment, Eva refuses to tear herself away from Kevin, and we finally see that the real message of the film isn't about what would cause a son to behave like Kevin, but what choices a parent has when faced with such horrendous offspring.

Many viewers might be turned off by the film's slow pace, its often art-fogged cinematography, and its shattered-window structure. The movie requires a patient viewer, and one who is fascinated by truly resonant (if not downright ugly) characters. The movie is about a massacre, but don't expect a lot of blood and gore. Instead, the real horror can be found in Eva and Kevin's eyes, a mix of despair and coldness that left this viewer trembling in his seat.",1335312000,10,2872,4.625490196078432

The beginning intercuts between scenes of her pregnancy, dealing with the boy, getting a new job, and dealing with harassment by neighbors. The film then begins to utilize more of a linear storyline to tell the story of a child who terrorizes his mother while manipulating the father. This behavior culminates in a violent outburst that causes the mother to be targeted by other neighborhood parents, who hold her responsible. This is a very powerful film that realistically portrays the difficulty she has with dealing with a boy that she truly loves, but who only cares about himself.

5076721,4,B007C3TVEY,"Going into ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" (110 min.), I knew very generally what the theme of the movie was (Kevin is a troubled kid and he is going to do something horrible) but purposefully I did not know any of the plot details as I wanted to movie to surprise me. Boy, did the movie surprise me!

The first 20-25 min. of the movie are absolutely transfixing, as there is hardly any conversation, and there are miltiple story lines going on at the same time. The picture that eventually emerges is one where Eva (Kevin's mom) is dealing with the traumas of whatever Kevin has done (we don't know until much later in the movie what that is), and also, in flashbacks, reflecting on how Kevin grew up (and why he turned out the way he did, and of course where there was anything she could've done better or differently). The acting in the movie is mostly outstanding, with Tilda Swinton as Eva, but the 3 actors who portray Kevin are equally effective, none more so in my opition than Jasper Newell as six to eight year old Kevin.

This is a chilly and devastating movie, but oh-so-good. I was literally frozen into my chair as I watched this movie unfold. Given the general premise of the movie, and the fact that there really isn't a single uplifting moment in it, it is amazing that this movie even got made at all (and not so amazing that a good part of the funding came from BBC Films, apparently). Also a special mention that the music score was done by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. In all, if you like off-center movies that are not your typical Hollywood main fare with happy ending, by all means, check this movie out.

5076722,5,B007C3TVEY,"""He's just a boy, he's a sweet little boy. That's what boys do."" Eva (Swinton) is a new mother who is concerned with her new son. He seems off to her and becomes increasingly vicious in his actions and words. When Kevin does the unthinkable she is left to live her life in shame and solidarity with constant reminders by the people of the town she lives in. This is one of the most difficult experiences I have ever had watching a movie. Much like ""American History X"" this movie makes you feel contradicting feelings throughout and the end leaves you wondering why. Not since the ""Passion Of The Christ"" has a movie had such an effect on me that I hard a hard time talking when it was over. I really cannot explain this movie in words that will do it justice to the way that I felt about it but this is a movie that made me feel sick to my stomach, angry as hell and utterly helpless all at once. One of the most important movies of the year, but one that I don't think I could ever watch again. If you can handle it you should do whatever you can to see this. A movie you want to tell everyone to watch but at the same time are afraid to. Disturbingly haunting and emotionally draining as well as being the most powerful movie I have seen mabye ever.

I consider the family should take care of  Kevin""s behaviors since he was born, even though one doctor told the mother that he hasn't AUTISM, she should consult for a second opinion. This is an excellent film where society can learn how parents deal with the emotional distress raising a child with a mental illness.( Even though the mother didn't know )
Early intervention is the best for children in any level of misbehavior . Is the parents don't do anything, how they can spectate not to have legal issues with their children in the future?
