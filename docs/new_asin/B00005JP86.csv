1603451,5,B00005JP86,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie but became reluctant after reading the rather mediocre reviews it received from the so-called ""experts"". I decided to ahead and, as usual, the ""experts"" got it all wrong. FLYBOYS not only met my expectations, but also exceeded them.

I'm a big history buff and am usually very disappointed with Hollywood's rendition of historical events. For me, it really detracts from a movie when I see things like Sea Sparrow missile launchers on the deck of a destroyer in Pearl Harbor, or when William Wallace supposedly has a torrid affair with a Princess who was, in reality, only three years old at the time of his death, and I expected to find similar fault with this movie. I found no such errors here. The true life story was most accurate, including such details as the lion which served as the mascot for the Escadrille LaFayette, the dented bullets which the flying aces had to sort through before each flight, and the fact that over one million allied soldiers lost their lives at Verdun.

Hollywood movie critics have a difficult time with true stories. True life, especially when accurately presented, doesn't always have the same flair as fictionalized accounts, and critics have given rather harsh reviews of the plot, totally missing so many details surrounding such things as camaraderie, respect and traumatic real life emotions. And no, in real life, people don't always live happily ever after and the hero doesn't always ride off into the sunset with his sweetheart.

Beyond the historical accuracy portrayed here, the film has sensational filming, particularly in the air battle scenes. The aerial views depict the miles of devastation of French countryside surrounding the trenches. The casting is more than adequate with particular mention going to Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault. James Franco also gives a superb portrayal of American Ace Blaine Rawlings.

If you are a history lover, and particularly interested, as I am, in the Great War, I urge you to go and watch this movie. You will find it historically accurate and yet able to bridge the gap into being an entertaining movie. Remember that this is not some Hollywood enhanced idea of war, but rather an accurate depiction of the real life events that surrounded the American pilots who became the Escadrille LaFayette. The critics got this one all wrong. Surprise, surprise.

1603452,4,B00005JP86,"This is a lavish, big-budget look at the LaFayette Escadrille - the American fighter pilots who volunteered for France before their country entered World War One. The locales, the sets, the costumes, the equipment, and, of course, the airplanes - what a pageant! There is an engaging mix of characters: the down-on-his-luck cowboy, the expatriate black prizefighter, the spoiled Harvard drop-out, the Bible-thumper, the wet-behind-the-ears youngster, the suspected spy, the cynical veteran ace, the French farmgirl, and the cruel and unscrupulous Black Falcon. The two young romantic leads are attractive enough, but let's face it - the real reason for seeing this movie is provided by the dogfights. And director Tony Bill does not disappoint: the sequences of aerial combat are as thrilling as any military action ever recreated on film. They are easy to follow because all the planes have very visible personal insigniae clearly identifying who's who. The only negative I have to say is that the musical soundtrack sounds like a rip-off of the Mel Gibson film The Patriot.",1158969600,3,1075,5.255813953488372

1603578,5,B00005JP86,"This film was surprisingly good in every way. It's a very traditional action/adventure film that emulates earlier films of its type and adds up-to-date special effects which make the flying combat scenes much more involving and exciting than in the past. It's well-acted by a relatively young cast. Cowboy character Blaine Rawlings and boxer Eugene Skinner were based on actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille. It also has excellent cinematography that captures the beauty of the scenery from the air. The story is nothing exceptional but simply what one would expect from a film of this type. It's not so much about fighting as it is about bravery, sacrifice and camaraderie in the face of danger. A romantic subplot seems tacked on to some people but it was a traditional part of the genre and adds an extra dimension to the characters.

The movie was almost totally overlooked in the fall of 2006 when it came out and, since no studio would back it, was a major financial loss to its producer Dean Deviln and executive producer David Ellison who put up most of the 60-million budget themselves (the film grossed 18 million worldwide). Ellison also appeared in the film as Eddie Beagle, a supporting character who provides many of the comic moments of the film.(He made his money back co-producing World War Z). America has a rather detached attitude toward the First World War which seems rather distant and faraway, unlike the Second, so the interest just wasn't there. How many big films from each war can you think of? They're almost all of the Second. Also, the movie scene was really changing in the early 2000's. This was when traditional genres like dramas and romantic comedies started a steep decline in favor of big special effects extravaganzas. Most of the big films of 2006 are fantasies of some sort: Pirates of the Caribbean, Night at the Museum, X-Men Last Stand, Da Vinci Code, etc. This movie was big, but too traditional and free of fantasy elements.

It even got picked on for historical inaccuracies. We all know lots of people like to find these faults in films. It makes them look smarter than the film makers and admittedly can be a fun game. In the biggest case among many, WWI afficionados piled on about the German tri-planes (Fokker DR) which were not used until the end of the war after late 1917, when the film is set in 1916. In the first place if you are going to movies to study history you're way off base. Movies are entertainment, not accurate history lessons. They exist to entertain and so have a different agenda and are allowed to take liberties as long as they don't go overboard (like having Germany win the war). The tri-planes look cool and dangerous and the audience can easily tell who is who in the combat sequences which is what is important to the film.

The movie is a bit too long. It could have easily ended twenty to thirty minutes before it did, but they decided to add one more big scene. This is okay and the scene does work but wasn't really necessary except in a screen writer's sense of resolving things in a certain traditional way. The movie manages to keep you involved enough so it all works.",1496534400,6,3162,4.673249551166966

The message here is the human cost of combat.  What it costs to be a warrior.  What they have to live with after the firefight, the battle, the war, is over. Those that have never been in a war, never seen a close brother-in-arms killed or watched one reduced to an incoherent, broken human in the fetal position that just hours ago was a fearless fighter, have no idea what war costs.  How it feels to realize you've killed a human.  How it feels to see a human killed. You know yourself and everyone else much better after days and weeks and months of killing and dying day and night; it grinds everyone down to who they really are.  You realize things about yourself you didn't know, and if you survive, you have to live with what you've done, or didn't do. It finds the bravest, the weakest, the foolish, the most determined, the coolest under fire, the cowards, then exposes them.  That's what this film is about.  The brotherhood of those that have been in the fire and tempered by it, the loss of those same brothers, those that failed in the crucible of combat and how profoundly a warrior understands the price of war.",1491436800,41,1280,4.463519313304721

You usually see WWII movies that are based more on American soldiers etc which is nothing bad but it was nice to see how the French army (the air force) was struggling in winning the war. Although it was a hard adjustment for the American flyers at first, I'm glad that both nations (Americans & French) got along. Although the sad part was that James Franco's character never got to see the girl again after the war was won. I loved the plot and historical facts in the movie.

1604296,3,B00005JP86,"FLYBOYS has a lot of daring do in this WWI aviation story. Somehow, it all seems a bit superficial. I am not so concerned here with historical accuracy, but rather it is the filmmaking that is lacking. The film's approach, it's character development, drama, its plot all seem surreptitiously weaving in and out of reality and comic book realism. Yet, I have to give director Tony Bill a lot of credit bringing the story of Lafayette Escadrille to the screen once more. When I think of Tony Bill, I will always remember him as Frank Sinatra's kid brother in COME BLOW YOUR HORN and his role as the green Lt. Walker in ICE STATION ZEBRA. FLYBOYS is a good effort to capture younger audiences. But director William A. Wellman's 1958 film LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLE handled this particular story of US flyers in WWI much better and director John Guillermin's 1966 film THE BLUE MAX brought the WWI aviation war to a degree of realism with chivalry and all .

Jean Reno's talents seemed wasted and trivialized as French Capt. Thenault.",1415836800,,1024,4.720670391061453

This is based on a true story and like all such movies has to combine real people into single fictional characters and have a little license with the story but that only enhances the movie experience.

I would have liked more info about the individual fliers, but may be hard to do without over extending the movie beyond most peoples interest. Confusing which fliers were losing their lives.  In their planes with their leather headgear all looked similar. Also dissapointed that absolutely no mention of Billy Mitchell, the US Officer who also flew early in WWI, advocated our modern Air Force, invented tactical air combat, predicted WWII, the bombing of Pearl Harbor almost to the minute 22 yrs prior and much more.",1409270400,,578,4.958762886597938
1604433,5,B00005JP86,"For an air war history buff this is a very good story, well set and cast, but overlooked by nearly everyone for one reason or another.

Being a retired USAF pilot and missile crew member I have a pilot's understanding of the inherent dangers of just flying these little biplanes in those days.  That task alone sans any other mission was huge, but this film doesn't clearly mention the fragile nature of the machines, the massive control difficulties during takeoff and landings, nor the inadequate design functions these brave men (boys) managed to overcome.  A bit of study prior to viewing this great little film will add tons of appreciation for the viewer for the skill, daring, and courage of all the soldiers who flew and fought in these little 'kites' in WWI.

In closing I will cite one example.  The Fokker DR1 Triplane is portrayed as agile, which it was, easy to takeoff and land, which it wasn't, and strong in all maneuvers, which it absolutely was not. Just one of its fatal flaws was the top wing was know to rip off hits struts taking the ailerons with it if given enough stress during a maneuver.  Another danger was the to small rudder which allowed the wind, as low as 10mph, to deflect it in ways that could 'ground loop' the plane on takeoff or in combat fail to deflect the craft sufficiently to avoid loosing control altogether.  Lastly, the DR1 was powered by a rotary radial engine, (look it up) which rotated the entire engine along with the propeller creating a massive torque moment as power was applied.  This made control at low airspeed near impossible.  This feature was a problem in many designs on both sides aircraft with such engines.",1409270400,,1671,4.656462585034014

What I can say, is it was a thrilling movie with loads of interesting little subplots - like the love story between Rawlings and Lucienne, or why Beagle changed his name, or why Cassidy goes back up after seeing his squadron safely to the ground.

I found the sky fights absolutely thrilling, and I really don't care that the CGI allowed the planes to do maneuvers that was impossible for the real planes of that era.  The scenes kept me glued to my seat and yelling out loud when ""our guys"" scored a hit - which startled my Collies a few times. *grins*  I enjoyed this movie and thought all of the actors did a wonderful job.",1409184000,,731,4.2

Aspiring plots come from the four corner of the Earth to fight in the European Theater during World War I.

Character Development

There is only a slight range of development, but growth is predictable. Much of the focus is place on the unrealistic difference placed on the new flyboy. Their backgrounds are so different, only the working a Hollywood script could master. This creates conflict which can only be overlooked if the viewer can suspend their level of disbelief.

 Acting

Good acting all around. Tries to be serious, but end up better a little cartoonish around the edges.

Overview

Overall this is an enjoyable picture. There were some problems with the level of realism where certain artistic liberties were taken, but a lot of good work can be found here. It is possibly not worth the purchase price for repeat viewing. Once around the block should be enough.",1406419200,,882,4.87248322147651

1605280,4,B00005JP86,"To begin with Ill state that I found this film to be highly enjoyable.  I know it bombed at the box office and was rated poorly by many critics but I cant help it, this is a good film.  There are a couple of ways to evaluate this film and Ill list them below.

1. Historic perspective:  As many reviewers have indicated in previous reviews this film suffers from many inaccuracies.  For true history and war film buffs this may ruin the film for them.  Myself, I knew very little of the details, other than the German planes were not colored correctly, and so the story line kept me interested.  In fact, this film sparked such an interest in the story of the Lafayette Escadrille that I did a lot of research reading on the topic.  I would encourage people to read up on the actual events and people.

2. Film locations & special effects:  I thought the costume design, set locations, props, flying sequences, and special effects were extremely well done.  I was completely sold on the time period and setting in which this film takes place.  No doubt the film relied on CG animation for some of the fight scenes.  These effects were so well done that there is no jarring juxtaposition from real life to animation that the viewer is momentarily distracted from the films story.

3. Story:  I found the story to be very good.  Not overly complex but that does not mean it is a simple color by number type story.  The supporting characters are given enough attention and screen time, some more than others, that the viewer is emotionally connected to their fates.

Lastly, I would say that the main reason this film works for me is that Im drawn into the story.  The writing was good, the acting was good, and the story was believable.  Special Effects, good sets, and costume design don't make a good film, think PEARL HARBOR (2001).  The story is the thing that links all these other things together and this film links them together pretty well.",1404172800,,1947,4.537356321839081

Violence- You see several pilots die, some get shot up, some burn up, one shots himself, one losses a hand. Several people in the movie get shot in war scenes.

1605404,3,B00005JP86,The aerial scenes are the defining moment in this movie. The sub plot of our hero meeting a French farm girl is trite. The pilot having a lion as a pet is a bit ridiculous. How the French officers in charge of these recruits can be snubbed and disrespected is beyond military protocol. I would say if you just concentrate on the aerial action you can get through this movie.,1403222400,,374,4.357142857142857

1605464,5,B00005JP86,"Much has been written about the ground and trench warfare horrors of WW I. The air war was a competitively small part of the war. The Lafayette Es quadrille was the name given to a group of young American men who volunteered to fight the Germans under the flag of France. Its vague title belies a well-told story, told from the point-of-view of a volunteer, of what exactly these young men did in the service of France, during this long and ghastly war. Battle scenes in the air provided a clear understanding of what it meant to fly military, in those early days. There were no parachutes: pilots were issued revolvers to destroy themselves if their plane could no longer fly, or land. The movie shows very well how the few pilots who survived for more than one or two missions. Morale was not high: French officers beyond their immediate command structure ignored them. Despite this, examples of their heroism fill this picture. Yet, only a few went home and made flying their postwar career. If you love flying be sure to see this.",1403049600,,1034,4.625

1605558,2,B00005JP86,"The period sets, costumes, and live cinematography were delightful. That's pretty much it.

As an experience, it failed in whole. Thing is, you cannot make a decent movie with single competent actor (the French Commander), a few helmets worth of greasy grimaces, and an endless stream of cartoon-like dogfights. Franco stinks as the lead hero. The screenplay no doubt was written by a poorly read, prepubescent author. Every major twist in the plot was perfectly predictable, and the smaller ones just got in the way. This film might best be enjoyed disassembled into 100 still photographs pasted into a scrapbook while one sips a little port. If you refrain from adding captions to the photos, the power of the pictures would jump off the page. As a film.....Ugh! In lieu of watching this uninspiring portrayal, spend your time on the web checking out an aviation museum. You'll have something to show for your time.",1402531200,2,917,4.954545454545454

1605874,2,B00005JP86,"I got bored about an hour into the movie. I am no expert on WWI or on aviation but the scene in no-man's land completely lost me. The German-American guy flips his plane when he crashes in no-man's land. Only he cannot get away from his hand because his hand is pinned underneath the plane. How in the hell did the hand get there in the first place? As one of our American heroes is uselessly jerking around, I am wondering why doesn't he just use his other hand to dig a hole and free his smashed hand? What is this jerking around stuff? Then James Franco appears in no-mans land to his friend's rescue. This scene just gets stranger and stranger by the second. Where did Franco land his plane? Wouldn't his airplane be wiped out by an artillery barrage? We see Franco running and dodging bullets and at this point, I am thinking a good artillery blast from the Germans ought to do the job here. Fire in the general area of James Franco. But that is not what happens because Hollywood is too cheap to have any artillery. Two French heroes risk their lives trying to save Franco and his friend. Franco arrives and tugs and jerks on his friend's hand and finally grabs an entrenching tool. I am thinking now this ridiculous scene begins to make sense, right? Dig the hand out, for crying out loud! But no. Instead Franco uses the entrenching tool as a lever but he cannot budge the plane so HE CHOPS HIS FRIEND'S HAND OFF! Without wrapping anything to stop the arterial spraying and the loss of blood he and his friend who must be undergoing extensive shock and screaming his head off escape to the French trench in one of the most amazing and ridiculous scenes I have ever seen!

A little later in the film, as Franco races off to evacuate his girlfriend, Captain Jean Reno comes out to tell Franco that these aircraft are not for his personal use. What the hell does Reno think Franco has been using his aircraft for  this entire movie? Is hitting on a girl a professional use of the plane?

A very nicely put together film without undue flash that made you feel you could understand the period.  Well worth the time for a rainy afternoon.,1400716800,,446,4.802631578947368

The sets were authentic and story with the French girl and her family flowed well, even if the ""air rescue"" was an the edge of credibility but the landing on the battlefield was just too much.

1606019,3,B00005JP86,"The story of the Lafayette Escadrille is very interesting in and of itself, but coupled with the fact that they were some of the world's first fighter pilots, it is a unique story.  This movie, while a reasonably entertaining popcorn flick, is a little too loose with the facts, and it's a little too feel-good.  This movie should have been more like Band of Brothers.  Instead, it was too much like a lower-budget, poorly scripted version of Pearl Harbor.",1400198400,,456,4.746835443037975

I am a student of history in particular, the Civil War, WWI, and WWII. Like most men over the age of two, aviation movies are near the top of my list. This very well done film has a mix of humor, life and death action, even a little romance. The cinematography is EXCELLENT. I have likely seen the movie at least 7 or 8 times. . . .on purpose!

It is well worth seeing. . .I promise you, you will not be disappointed!! Even a great date movie. . .

Thought not completely historically accurate regarding the machines of the time, it none the less conveys how the war in the air was fought.  While the acting is fine, the dialog at times seems a bit cliched.  There are few World War I films.  While this is no Dawn Patrol or All Quiet on the Western Front, it is entertaining and enlightening regarding that era.",1400112000,,456,4.580246913580247

1606082,4,B00005JP86,"I saw this film when it came out in 2006 and recently watched it again in a little higher definition.  I really enjoyed this film back then and loved it when I saw it again.  If you like any of the themes: WWI, history, flight ... watch it!

Pros:
- I feel this film has an authentic feel to the film itself.  The planes, outfits, locations.  All awesome.
- The dogfights are amazing.  CGI and angles in the plane cockpits are all very well done.
- Fun storyline.
- Jennifer Decker.

Cons:
- The acting is wooden at times.  Not from everyone all the time, but just, awkward.
- The storyline, while fun as I stated above, is not well developed.  The only character who was properly developed was Cassidy.  Franco's character isn't bad but is a bit inconsistent.  You won't feel much connection to the characters that die.

I've read a few places that Franco did not like the film, which is unfortunate if true, because this is a fun film despite it's inconsistencies.",1399939200,,966,4.457142857142857
1606083,3,B00005JP86,I liked this movie. The character were enjoyable and the actors did a fine job. It was not a very deep movie but it was entertaining. The love story was cheesy and some of the character were typical but over all it was a good movie.,1399852800,,232,4.065217391304348
1606084,3,B00005JP86,"Overall I really enjoyed the movie, the only problem is that the ""HD"" is not really HD. I have a new HD television and the picture quality kept going in and out, at times it was very blurry and other times it was really sharp. I doubt it is my connection or my TV as I have watched other HD quality shows and movies with no problems.",1399852800,,333,3.985074626865672

1606137,4,B00005JP86,"I like war movies and heroism et. al., so I may be a little biased; besides this is a real story and not entirely fiction. This is good entertainment. Fast paced action movie with all the right components; love, humor, good aerial fights in their planes (Cessna type aircraft). In-fact when I watch war movies where the focus is on the air-force, I prefer to watch the dog fights in older planes, because its easier to see the tactics used in these smaller planes when there were less gadgets and it was the man behind the machine that was clearly evident. 4 stars, no doubt. Please do watch this movie, I liked it!",1399593600,,615,4.451327433628318

1606183,4,B00005JP86,"I thought the movie did a good job in portraying some of the difficulties of the war. It still amazes me that men flew in combat with those flimsy aircraft and nothing to protect them, do or die. It kept a good pace and story line was believable, even though I am not sure how accurate. I enjoyed the characters and the scenery. Worth watching.",1399420800,,344,4.3076923076923075
1606184,4,B00005JP86,"This was an enjoyable flicker, but the combat scenes were adversely shaded by overuse of computer graphics.

Underacted by Franco (probably on purpose, but it doesn't work). Some of the dogfights were quite good, except for the cutaways to the actors ... especially when one would give the slightest nod of the chin to let the other guy know he ""understood"" .... from 100 yards away at 150mph, while someone was shooting at them. It's paying attention to detail that makes a good movie. This didn't have it. The only reason it got 2 stars from me was for the actors that played the American Ace and the French commander.

1606353,1,B00005JP86,"Another reviewer -- who obviously knows nothing at all about WWI, biplanes in general, or the Lafayette Escadrille in particular -- claimed that this movie was a historically accurate portrayal of their exploits.

Well, it's not. Period.

In fact, it's so full of historical, scientific, military, and logical inaccuracies that it's almost laughable. I won't even bother to list them all, although there is one particular inaccuracy that I *must* point out, because it is stunningly, mind-bogglingly asinine: More than once in the movie, several of the protagonists are flying in formation, and they shout across to one another -- and on one occasion, they even have a  moderately lengthy conversation in this manner.

Well, I have flown in an open-cockpit biplane, so I can assure you from personal experience that such a conversation is absolutely, completely and totally *impossible*. I flew as a passenger in a two-seater, with a friend squeezed into the front cockpit beside me (with his brother, the pilot, behind us), and we *tried* to converse by shouting at the top of our lungs -- literally, *directly* into each other's ears, from a distance of less than an inch -- and neither of us could hear a single damned word.

Even if you  haven't had the experience, it's really quite easy to understand. When you are sitting in an open-cockpit biplane, the wind is roaring past you at somewhere between 150-200mph, and there is a tremendous, screaming engine right in front of you. You can't hear *anything* but that engine. That's why in the Real World -- the historically accurate one, as opposed to the idiotic Hollywood caricature of it -- *REAL* WWI pilots communicated solely by hand signals or the occasional flare gun.

So every time this movie shows you pilots shouting across to each other, it is insulting your intelligence. The only way it could have been *more* absurd is if they were having these shouted fighter-to-fighter conversations in the vacuum of outer space.

To that kind of idiocy, add ham-handed direction, acting that swings from utterly lifeless to inexplicably melodramatic with no apparent connection to whatever is transpiring, and a contrived and imbecilic story full of plot holes bigger than the Death Star / Zeppelin featured in the big climactic fight scene (in which innumerable laws of physics were violated).

The result is garbage. Insufferable, ridiculous garbage.

There are very good reasons that this movie did so horribly in the theaters -- and the blatant historical inaccuracies were the *least* of them.",1398988800,3,2555,5.076372315035799
1606354,5,B00005JP86,"This movie, though ""Hollywood-ized"",  gives you a real feel for what it must have been like to fly in this new media of 'air-warfare'.  Though bloody and ruthless there was still some modicum of honor between these turn of the century Knights.  The few ""real"" aircraft in the movie are beautifully restored.  The computer animated footage is quite good.  (Historical fact; There is NO real movie footage of a WW I dog fight)  If you're a lover of adventure you'll probably enjoy this movie.

1606394,5,B00005JP86,"I must have seen a different movie than the one lambasted so harshly on this site. I think FLYBOYS is excellent throughout, with nary a false step along the way. Okay, I'll grant that some of the aerial CGI is unconvincing, but the great majority of it adds exciting action - - and who really cares if a physicist might find fault? Staging is brilliant, treating us to plenty of period detail, and the story is taut, with lots of intriguing characters about whom I truly care. I do not find FLYBOYS excessively clich&eacute;d. Indeed, the screenwriters (Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward) quite often back off from easy stereotypes. If anything, the fine cast UNDERacts, which is a refreshing change from other films in this genre. Particular praise goes to James Franco as Blaine Rawlings, Jean Reno as a believable Captain Georges Thenault, and Jennifer Decker as a sweet French girl named Lucienne. The love bypath within this film demonstrates how sensitive the writers are to avoiding the typical Hollywood gimmick of throwing in a boy-girl relationship that eventually overpowers the essential plot line (PEARL HARBOR, TITANIC). Here, the characters of Blaine and Lucienne are treated honestly, with the respect they deserve, and not flung into the sack after knowing each other for five minutes. I'm sorry that this film was not successful at the box office, for director Tony Bill and his massive crew do a fabulous job of storytelling, and I am proud and unashamed to add it among my favorite war movies of all time. Please ignore the pseudo-intellectual posturing of the professional and amateur critics, and give FLYBOYS a chance. It is wonderful from beginning to end.",1398816000,,1692,4.940350877192983

1606877,4,B00005JP86,If you like dog fights and acrobatic flying this is the movie to watch. I especially liked seeing the and hearing the biplanes and triplanes from that era again. Good acting and writing made this even better than I expected.,1398038400,,224,4.625

1606879,5,B00005JP86,"The movie was well-produced and directed, no doubt.  All elements were perfect, in my opinion.  They really show you what it was like - no parachutes, even. These men joined the French forces, which were recruiting anyone as if they were a basketball team - to ward off many Germans, who allied with Austria-Hungary. (The leader of Austria was assassinated, along with his wife, by Serbs, which is what caused the war; and WW2 no doubt, stemmed from that) Their technique was the only thing that saved them in the air.  The movie shows all this.  Anyone who wants to see how it really went down back then - watch this.  And you see the human-side of all the men, too.  Heroism back then was almost a dime a dozen, since they had to be constantly alert and watch out for eachother.  There were a total of Thirty million casualties. Ten million of whom died.",1398038400,,856,4.483870967741935

A good story line, some very good graphics (and some that are maybe not so good) make it a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.",1398038400,,307,4.049180327868853
1606933,4,B00005JP86,"Every character in ""Flyboys"" has a tragic background story to bring to the narrative. Each one is dealing with some kind of loss or rejection that shows up in the dynamics of the group relationships. The rejected son of a top one per center has to live with the son of a slave in his squad. This gives one of the best lines in the film when the rich kid finally recognizes his racism and asks Skinner what his father had thought about something. Skinner's response put the deep personal differences of the characters in true relief. The flight scenes are surpassed only by ""Wings"". Bravado and liquor are the most common defense against the absurdity of life as a pilot whose sole purpose has become killing more of the enemy each day before the enemy kills them. James Franco is entirely believable as Rawlings with his deeply held convictions of right and wrong that frequently put him at odds with those around him. ""Flyboys"" is well done and well worth watching again.",1398038400,,972,4.624277456647399

1606937,5,B00005JP86,I had never heard of this film before running across it on Amazon Prime.  It turned out to be a great film about the Lafayette Escadrille air corp.  The film was really well done in relation to the flying scenes.  Every thing appeared to be actual flights.  I'm sure there was a lot of computer animation but you could not tell from watching the film.  I thought the acting was great and costumes were very well done in relation the the time frame.  If you like aerial combat you will really enjoy this film.  You actually feel like you are in the cockpit of a WW I biplane.  I highly recommend the film.,1397952000,,604,4.283185840707965

The men of those days were incredibly courageous.
One thing I did not like is the way the I had to keep changing the volume  because the voices were soft and the action noise was so much louder.",1397865600,,313,4.305084745762712
1606997,5,B00005JP86,"Excellent film, acting by Franco, and realistic air fighting sequences, but loses the mark on period of the piece. Doesn't ""feel"", look, like WWI.
The director could have taken some tips from James Salter and his great book, ""The Hunters"" (recommended for those of you who are interested in Fighter aircraft action) That aside, the film is a nice microcosm of the time, the circumstances, and the courage of the American airmen
who volunterred to fight prior to The US's entry into the war. The interwoven love story between Franco and a young French girl is poignant and realistic, but sad in its inevitable outcome.",1397865600,,617,4.885714285714286

1607001,5,B00005JP86,"Take a peek into the American men who went to France to become pilots and fight the German bid for world domination.  We follow one man, how he became an Ace, the man who helped him, and the leadership style used to motivate men to face death everyday from various means.  Of particular note is why each pilot was given a hammer and a pistol.  Both were to be used in a crisis moment and the movie explains how.

I think this movie showed me how ordinary people became extraordinary people, not once, but several times over.  For that alone, I would recommend this movie  The beautiful aerial footage was awe inspiring, as if I were there to experience the first thrill of flying and the joy and peace it brings.  But, of course there is a war to fight, but in a Zen-like way, there is a harsh beauty in that too. If, by the time two crashed pilots are saved in a French whore house hasn't touched your heart, I give up.  You can't be reached.",1397779200,,943,4.258426966292135

There is some blood, but not that much.  It is a war ""true story"" based film with some dramatic scenes.  The story they tell is really good.

1607236,5,B00005JP86,"I enjoyed this movie mainly because of the depiction of flight, dog fights and ""realism"".  I put realism in quotes because I am not really sure how scientifically or historically realistic it was.  Even if they were able to talk to or read journals from people who were actually in this squadron. the ""realism"" could be clouded memories or interpretations from  sensationalized writings.  No matter, I want to believe it was realistic.  Little things like when they take off as a squadron they jump in their planes and all take off across a field  together, no formation flying, and their options if their plane was disabled going down and they were still alive - parachutes had not been invented.

What I enjoyed so much were the flying sequences.  Amazing CGI mixed with the personal aspects of facial expressions shared between the pilots both friends and enemies.  Even though I did notice some things that defied structural mechanics and the physics of flight, I chocked it up to entertainment and gave them license to play with the natural laws.

And yes there was a decent plot, heros, hazing, a little romance with a damsel and children in distress and a pet lion(?).

Overall an enjoyable movie that I would recommend for anyone who enjoys a ""Star-Wars"" type of movie - good and evil fighting in 3 dimensional space with the aid of CGI - loosely based on history of how flying machines were brought into warfare.",1397347200,,1421,4.759183673469388

The story was fun and exciting, the reality of the historical aspects were very well portrayed including the dog-fights and the esprit d' corps that each flyer had in both armies. James Franco was a natural for this part and did his character justice. I believed his portrayal of the character to the point of forgetting that he was acting a role. Very well scripted movie as was the cinematography and directing skills. Just to mention that the acting of all the characters was superbly first class and I would have been remiss if I were not to have mentioned it. The movie was excellent.

Usually the thought is the estimated 37 million killed. Many that died were sick with diseases like Spanish flu, others were civilians. This movie is based on a true story of young men who learned to fly and fight in the war. Very few made it home.

Truly a beautiful film too, with moving characters and situations -- you might need some kleenex. James Franco anchors the film, and his quiet, man-of-few words cowboy character is perfect. Every single other person in the film is also perfect, right down to the minor characters. I don't know why it works so well as a film, it just does.  Maybe like Wings, the first film to win an Oscar, these small planes are just incredibly exciting to watch on film. Enjoy!",1397001600,,602,4.463636363636364

The special effects were pretty good. Once in a while an airplane would be to ""stiff"", but other times, the fx were amazing. Real aircraft were used as well, so it was a good mixture. I thought James Franco was good in this movie, it suited him well. The writers avoided a happy ending so to speak, and instead, ended it with a more realistic final take.

I will be watching this movie again, and might even get the DVD.",1396915200,,587,4.336363636363636

The airborne photography is top-notch.  The viewer nearly has the feeling of being in the cockpit with the flyers.

The movie plotline follows James Franco as a young, hotshot pilot from Texas, and his experience as a newbie in the L.E. You see some of the historical challenges the French faced, as the German triplanes had a technological advantage, and some of the struggles of men who lost comrades almost daily. Historically, these scenes were fairly interesting and educational. There is also a subplot with a mysterious French woman who is destined to get away, but it was not very interesting.",1396569600,,739,5.107438016528926

1607716,1,B00005JP86,"I was looking forward to this film as I had heard good things about it. Unfortunately the good things came from ill-informed people. This film did little but anger me. It certainly did not entertain.
I am a sucker for airplane movies. I like James Franco and Jean Reno as actors. So I stayed with it and the longer I did the more upset I got.
First and foremost are the blatant historical and factual inaccuracies. Yes, the Lafayette Escadrille existed and was manned by American volunteers. NO, they did not train in their operational unit. The French had an entirely separate, not entirely logical system for training new pilots. Worse, they used Nieuport 17s, which had rotary engines NOT radial engines. The entire mass of a rotary rotates around its crankshaft, greatly affecting maneuvarability, while a radial - although they cylinders are arranged in similar fashion - sits still in the aircraft while the crank rotates. There are a number of close-up scenes in which the nose of the plane is prominent and in all the engine sits still.
This alone had my teeth grinding. Then there is the story-telling.
There are several scenes in which Franco takes of on a usually love interest-driven mission that shows him in the air. Cut to him walking from the plane in some sort of rough, plowed field. Gimme a break. How does one make the jump from being in the air to walking away from an impossible landing?
I can go on and on but this is already taking more effort than the film is worth. This should have been an homage to the brave men who flew for France before America entered the Great War. Instead it is a farce. Don't even get me started on how the producers and director wasted Jean Reno. I am certain he was blushing as he cashed his check and \paid his French taxes.
To be sure, the CGI stuff is awesome and worth watching on a streaming service. This film is not worth, however, spending a centime of your own money.",1396483200,,1930,4.5488505747126435

The personal evolution of these ""Flyboys"" is touched on, but, not I feel really made the focus the focus of the film.

1608039,4,B00005JP86,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. The only thing that keeps me from giving a five-star rating is that the script was mediocre. With such a story, a great cast, and wonderful CGI, I would think they could have produced an equally great script. What a shame. Nothing snappy, witty or fun about the dialogue, and that's really too bad. However, get beyond the lame script, and enjoy this movie for the fabulous aerial combat sequences. Wow. Suspenseful, dramatic, amazing. In addition, it was very interesting to see the different kinds of aircraft that were flown at that time--some of which I previously did not know existed. How different aviation was then: very immediate, close, exposed. Yes, there is a love story, of sorts. Nearing the end of the movie I was afraid they were going to make it sappy, but thank goodness they resisted that temptation. For those who are history buffs, WWI buffs, who want to see some really great aerial combat, or who just like James Franco's fabulous smile, I heartily recommend. I will be watching this movie again.",1396224000,,1066,4.798913043478261

1608078,2,B00005JP86,"Great production values, and it was cool to see this view of World War One aviation combat since there really aren't any others.

However, it's a predictable, stale war movie with stereotypical characters. I won't go into a rant that would be full of spoilers, but if you've seen any 3-4 good war movies you can add them up and divide them by poor writing and end up with this result. It feels extremely forced and hits its marks with difficulty, just clocking in to get the point across and then clocking out after another overplayed war scene half-done. If you've seen the friendly and sometimes jealous inter-squadron camaraderie of Top Gun, the war-time disillusionment of Full Metal Jacket and the cowboy do-the-right-thing-forget-about-regulations antics of William Shatner's OR Chris Pine's James Kirk, then you've seen this movie several times. It switches back and forth sporadically between taking itself very seriously and then making a flippant mockery of military life and wartime conditions.

1608497,4,B00005JP86,Enjoyed the dog fights from a pilots perspective. Inter-racial issues were brought out in a good way with positive results.,1395705600,,123,5.2
1608498,2,B00005JP86,The rest of the story was amateurish and clich. A Patton or Saving Private Ryan it's not.  The old movie Blue Max more entertaining about WW1 Dogfighting.,1395705600,,154,4.703703703703703
1608499,4,B00005JP86,Interesting story line. Beautiful cinematography. Appropriate for the entire family. I never knew about the aviator training in the war.,1395705600,,136,5.85
1608500,3,B00005JP86,"While ""Flyboys"" is about a squad that has to learn to fly, fight and get along together, the film itself is not about ensemble acting but on Franco's character.  James Franco is a talented guy and an actor I respect, but his smiling jauntiness seems too light weight for the movie. On the other hand, Martin Henderson's Reed Cassidy is outstanding.

The real treat are the aerial scenes that are terrifying and majestic at the same time.",1395705600,,437,4.662337662337662
1608501,1,B00005JP86,"Good special effects, weak in dialogue, character development and stereotypes. I just couldn't care about this predictable story and account of what it must have been like to fly in that time period under the conditions that must have existed.

I would recommend this to those that like special effects.",1395705600,,303,5.06

1608503,5,B00005JP86,set in WWI before the US gets involved - a few good men sign up with the French air fighters...  it's action - it's thrilling - it's romance - it's people!  Loved it and would watch it again!,1395705600,,191,4.0
1608504,4,B00005JP86,Way too many Red Triplanes.  As far as I know only the Red Baron flew a Fokker Dr1 red Triplane.  Aside from that I enjoyed it.,1395705600,,127,3.8461538461538463
1608505,5,B00005JP86,"I enjoy a good true story, this movie kept Me captivated. the history of how planes were introduced into war was also intriguing.

1608581,4,B00005JP86,"I thought this flick was put together pretty well, and displayed reality as much as most war-time movies I've viewed.  The photography was not bad.  The love affair between Franco and the French girl was very touching.  I was hoping they would meet up again after the war, but...I enjoyed it.",1395705600,,292,4.686274509803922
1608582,5,B00005JP86,This is a super movie...It is based on a true story and you see some of the things these brave men had to endure and overcome. It has it's light moments and overall it kept my total attention...,1395705600,,194,4.131578947368421

1608584,3,B00005JP86,"Interesting film and an opportunity to learn about a bit of history that intrigued me. The characters personalities could have been explored a bit more, and I would have been very interested to learn more about the difficulties of flying those early aircraft and the dangers the pilots faced.  James Franco is VERY cute ... that makes up for a good bit. Not classic film material ... but not a complete dog, either.",1395705600,,415,4.684931506849315

I thought it was going to be more of a drama then it turned out to be.  It was sort of corney at times almost.  It kept my attention for the most part but lost my husband about half way through.",1395705600,,308,4.186440677966102
1608653,5,B00005JP86,I really enjoyed Flyboys. There wasn't any bad language and the characters were interesting. It's based on a true story about Americans going to France to learn how to fly and fight.,1395705600,,182,4.71875
1608654,3,B00005JP86,A little cheesy at times but it was well paced.  It was entertainment and not the meaning of life.  I you are looking for that its the wrong movie for you.  The aerial dogfights were exciting and fun to watch.  I never got invested in the characters the development was shallow at best.  If you want to kill a couple hours with some historical-fiction then you won't regret watching this or having it on as background noise.,1395705600,,424,4.454545454545454
1608655,2,B00005JP86,"Don't bother watching this yawner. Formula driven and utterly void of interest. Of course it has interesting computer generated fight scenes with the open cockpit pilots grinning like they just ate briars. Implausible scene where our hero, with plane and his body shot up, manages to shoot the dastardly German Ace with a service revolver, while flying his damaged plane 100 feet from the enemy plane.  Just try to shoot a pistol from 100 feet and make TWO headshot kills while in a moving vehicle. Stoooooooppppiiidddd!

1608708,1,B00005JP86,Way too long!  It is amazing that it is so long and still lacks good character development.  Not worth the time.,1395705600,,112,4.285714285714286

1608710,5,B00005JP86,"Seems the subject of WW I air battles is always going to be a favorite subject for film. Starting with the first ""Wings""a favorite silent film of mine. In the case of ""Flyboys"" the fliming was excellent, a bit more graphic than earlier films of this type, but that is expected these days. I am a fan of Franco's acting style in particualr and he was his usual best in this production.",1395705600,,384,4.347222222222222

1608715,3,B00005JP86,"It never really grabbed me. The scenery was good and good dogfight scenes with some of the first planes to fly in the sky. However, I was hoping for more. I was hoping for a movie of the Seabiscuit caliber. A movie that would leave me thinking about life during the times of WWI or what it may have been like to be one of the first pilots to fly in the sky. It did neither of these for me.",1395619200,,389,3.875

1608768,3,B00005JP86,James Franco is a wonderful actor and he tried to make this script and story based on fact work.  But the story seemed a bit rushed to me.  The Lafayette Escadrille were a group of brave Americans who joined the French air force before America entered World War I.  This was to be their story but it seemed to focus more on Franco than the others.  it's rare to find a film about World War I....perhaps the greatest war that should never have been fought.  But I prefer the silent film Wings over Flyboys.,1395532800,,505,4.329787234042553

1608775,4,B00005JP86,"How many Americans have heard of the Lafayette Escadrille? This movie gives honor to those early American flyers who joined the French Air Force a year before the US entered the war. Also, some of the terrors faced by early pilots, like burning alive in a flaming aircraft, or falling to your death gives us some idea of what risks these men faced. I think that the few technical inaccuracies and a few over dramatization can be excused as the movie gets across the main idea of these brave American pilots venturing into an unknown warfare method and making a legendary name for their country.",1395446400,,594,4.666666666666667

I kind of reminded me an early movie of Richard Gere.. JANKS... but more light and cool.

1608978,2,B00005JP86,I thought the overall photography was too computerized.  Cheap budget.  Some of the story of the Lafayette Escadrill was O.K. but definitely glamorized for the movie.,1395360000,,166,5.346153846153846
1608979,4,B00005JP86,"Being a retired pilot, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the old-time flying.  They showed the many personalities of people in combat--heroism, cowardice, loyalty, etc.  A good balance between action, story and romance.",1395360000,,215,5.903225806451613
1608980,5,B00005JP86,"My wife and I enjoyed this movie, it had a lot of dog fight action, a good story with some romance and not a lot of gore.
I'm not a big James Franco fan but he was very good in this one, plus a fairly good supporting cast.  it was a little long at
 2hrs and 20 minutes but it didn't ""feel"" long. I would recommend it.",1395360000,,317,3.716417910447761

1609035,3,B00005JP86,"Three stars may sound harsh, but Amazon defines it as ""it's okay,"" and that's exactly what Flyboys was to me. I watched it years ago when it came out, and I re-watched part of it recently. I still seemed like what I remembered from years ago: nothing to write home about. It's a fun little thing; alright to fill a slow evening or rainy day, but it's nothing I'd go out and pay to see in theaters.",1395273600,,397,4.1688311688311686

1609037,4,B00005JP86,This movie held my attention. The story line was captivating. The move is based on a true story. I highly recommend this movie. My only complaint is that the highlights in James Franco's hair look really dumb.,1395273600,,209,4.675675675675675
1609038,5,B00005JP86,"What a terrific movie!  If you miss this one you will regret it.  Ok, we all know they used CG for the film and I really don't care that the landing gear might not be able to tear off a wing without being destroyed.  It's a great story about courage.  You will love it!",1395273600,,269,3.925925925925926
1609039,5,B00005JP86,"I'm a 900 hour pilot and writer. I pass up very few chances to see aviation flicks. I didn't realize that I had seen this before, years ago, but was delighted with watching it again. Wow! This movie feels real and the HD made the visual and sound effects believable. There are only so many ways that one can staff a pilots ready room, but if you liked Piece of Cake or Battle of Britain, you'll love this too, and find it very fresh and electric. The set reminded me of the Lafayette Escadrille exhibit at the Smithsonian's Air & Space Museumwhich had suddenly come alive. The central fact of a pilots' ready room in a desperate situation is the tension produced by the knowledge that one is watching a revolving cast of men who must suck it up and go out there and do their job at the almost-certain peril of their life. As a former Marine and lover of history, I find this movie an apt monument to the flyboy contingent who participated in this most concentrated, grisly, meat-grinding war, which is well-documented. Also a good drama for your milder companions. My wife loved it.",1395273600,,1082,4.49746192893401

It is a combination of a heroic war film, a sad romantic tale and a marvelous display of combat in Bi-planes over Europe.",1395273600,,279,4.431372549019608
1609041,4,B00005JP86,"I enjoyed the different story lines each character brought to this movie. The aerial action sequences were authentic and really showed just how dangerous flying during WW I really was.  The movie keeps moving and key characters are lost, keeping in touch with the grim reality of any war!",1395273600,,288,4.877551020408164

1609092,5,B00005JP86,"Who doesn't love a good flying action movie? James Franco certainly does. Set in WWI France with Germany advancing and America still on the fence about entering this first world war, the flyers, mostly American, join the French to see history's first aces and first dogfighting ensure.

1609097,3,B00005JP86,"but many parts of the story were improbable. Plot lines sort of wander off and suddenly the movie ends. Like someone woke and realized we are running long. Gotta go.

1609101,2,B00005JP86,This movie was written with a second grader's knowledge of World War 1. Not every German plane was a red tri-dekker.,1395273600,,116,4.571428571428571
1609112,1,B00005JP86,"I was so excited to see this movie and then so let down in seeing it. It is impossible to cover all of the inaccuracies not to mention anachronisms throughout the movie. At any moment during training I expected Franco to pull out a droid and start texting. And the lack of respect shown by the American trainees to the battle hardened French officer was just so out of character for men in that time period its ridiculous. Not only were men much more classy in their public behavior back then but they would never have disrespected an officer like that, particularly the French. They'd have all been doing their flying from the brig. .The yelling ""yahoo!"" from an airplane, and shouting to each other as they flew by, I mean, ...come on. You can't hear anything over the roar of those rotary engines and a hundred mph wind in your face. It was laughable. Never once did I get the feel of climbing into the cockpit first person, like you did in the Blue Max when Stachel first flies a combat patrol in the Pfalz. Even though the cockpit shots weren't as good as ""Hells Angels"" looking at the actors (which used real pilots for actors who were filmed actually flying their planes) the shots from inside the cockpits were still were from real cockpits so you got the experience of taking off in a WWI plane. And the scene of the German gunning down the young dumb pilot (why would you run in a straight line in front of an airplane, ....did he think he could out run it? Just run into the woods dummy) is just garbage. There is a famous story that many WWI movies took liberties with about a pilot saluting another pilot who's guns jammed, but the story is true. It was a German Ace, Ernst Udet who spared Georges Gunymeyer when Gunymeyers guns jammed by waving and flying off.  And it was the allies who broke the treaty against incendiary ammunition and started lighting up the fuel tanks of German planes with fiery bullets. The German pilots actually flew with chivalry and honor for the most part from all accounts, so to do something so cheap as that scene just makes you hate the movie even more.  That and the only German plane you get to see other than the Gotha are the Fokker Triplanes and they weren't even on the battlefield yet and when they were finally on the battlefield they weren't the only planes in the air as they made just over 200 of them that actually saw combat duty. Where were the Pfalz's, Halberstadts, and more importantly the Albatrosses?  I mean if you're going to paint it in CGI then you can make anything you want. They should have had SPADS, and they shouldn't have given them Nieuport 17s as they weren't out yet. If they were flying Nieuports it would have been 11's (with a single Lewis on the top wing). Stupdest WWI movie ever made. They should have called it ""Flyboyz"".",1395187200,2,2808,4.469785575048733

It's hard to believe the aircraft developed so fast from the Right brothers flyer to the dog fighting craft of WWI. Also it's sad how the aircraft changed warfare forever.

Realism was tossed out from the beginning.  In this movie, one can get shot multiple times and fully function.  One can land a plane anywhere at any time, even in uneven ground of no-man's land to stage a rescue.

Also, the German pilots were made to appear as bad characters, smiling like evil devils when they had the upper hand momentarily.

It's not the type of movie I'd recommend nor the type to walk away from immediately thanks to good actors and technical people.",1395014400,,579,4.683168316831683

1609345,5,B00005JP86,I really enjoyed this movie.  The movie springs from the true story of young Americans volunteering in the French Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps who wanted to fly and fight during the war years of 1914-1917 and before America entered the full fighting in 1918.  A lot of the true story was stretched to make a very entertaining and enjoyable movie.  The French Nieuports planes and German Fokkers planes were colorful and interesting and the aerial dog fights and huge Zeppelin airships battles were great.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a war film with additional details on the pilots and others and their personal lives.  Great color and sound and scenery throughout.  You will not be disappointed in this movie.,1395014400,,749,5.0

1609370,4,B00005JP86,I think James Franco is such a great actor.  There was some what of a love story behind it but most of the movie is about the war and flying.,1395014400,,141,3.7

While I do like military movies in general I have never been a big fan of WWI movies until this one. I could've watched another 2 hours of this movie without fatigue. James Franco did a good job in the lead roll and Jean Reno turned in his usual excellent performance. Jennifer Decker would certainly make me want to fight for France!

Flyboys has full rich character development and a lush look to its cinematography but most visually stunning are the flight sequences. They are CGI motion control and you can tell but it doesn't distract from how stunning they are. (Vertigo sufferers take note.

Also, it's based on a true story.

Based on true story...lot of historical info was brought to the viewer:  such as why the war, America's role, the paintings on the plane, the importance of planes and the future, honor of pilots, and more.

If you're not then it can be slow going since real life can be that way especially during wartime and it's not always fast paced and exciting as portrayed in the most movies, and that's probably why it got so many bad reviews when it came out, but the special effects might still interest you.
Will be helpful if you know French because even with captions turned on it doesn't tell you what the French girl is saying.
Then again makes it more realistic I guess. I know when I was in the military and went overseas I still fell in love with a foreign girl even though she didn't speak english and we also struggled at first to communicate but it is possible.",1394928000,,852,4.298136645962733

1609536,4,B00005JP86,"I read a few of the reviews of this movie and didn't quite understand the amount of negativity.  Granted, this movie has some historical inaccuracies (e.g. type of plane portrayed not in service at time, etc) but, personally, I choose not to get too hung up on that sort of thing unless it is just completely outrageous.  I found the film to be very entertaining.  Perfect CG or not, the dogfight sequences were outstanding and there were plenty of them.  I did appreciate the love story, but appreciated more that it did not take the central focus in the film.  It was just enough to show some more humanity.  So, the balance there was good.  Now the plot is quite simple...There is a German nemesis that has to be dealt with by someone...I don't want to include spoilers.  Negative reviews point out just how simple and contrived such a plot line is.  However, I base my judgement based on the entertainment factor.  Did I find myself wanting to see the Nemesis go down?  Yes.  Did I route for the good guys?  Specifically, did I identify with some of the characters (albeit not perfectly developed) and want to see them vindicated?  Yes.  In short, despite the lack of character development, somewhat predictable plot, and not quite perfect CGI, I found the film to be very entertaining.  On top of that, I appreciated the story.  We do not see a lot of WWI movies made.  Given the importance of that war in our world's history, it is nice to see a story dealing with it, even though the film has flaws in a number of areas.",1394841600,,1527,4.510948905109489
1609587,4,B00005JP86,James Franco was a favorite of mine in his early career as a high school punk.

What brought the characters closer to each other is that they all wanted to learn how to be a airplane fighter. Well I have to go now but yes I give it a five star rating because I believe it was a real story and it dealt with the real issues of that time...

There are some great movies available as part of prime membership, but after the first few dozen obvious choices, it takes more digging to find them.  The free movies are still a great feature and makes the membership fee (going up to $100 this year) more like a bargain than a major decision, at least for me.  This movie has the sets and production value of a major Hollywood feature.  The story is based on true events and the movie does a good job of transporting the viewer to World War I France.  The place where it could have been improved is in the acting, particularly the lead character.  The loner with an attitude is actually hard to pull off, because the tough attitude can make it difficult for the audience to connect and to like the main character (think Waterworld, but not that bad).  It could just be me, since brooding is not my favorite character trait.

The young American men who volunteered to help France in the the air war before America joined the Allies in the European war, were brave young lions, anxious to learn about flying planes that were no more than bits of wood and canvas held together with nails and wire.  If they were shot down, they had no parachutes.  They were often reduced to firing pistols at enemy pilots when their machine guns didn't work which was often.  The death rate was astronomical.  But these young brave men with the bit
between their teeth were the vanguard in the importance of fighter planes and fearless pilots that played a major role in WWII.  The action is nonstop and the air battles dizzying.

1609819,4,B00005JP86,"I read one of the reviews here about this film,it was well written and it lowered my expectations. I watched it despite the reviewers warning that it was all cliche. Well if this was cliche then so was High Noon. That is not a comparison of the two films. However to say everything in this film has been done before so it is all cliche is like saying every western has men on horseback, a sheriff facing a bad guy and his gang, towns people afraid to help and they all have guns strapped to their waist. Yes they fly biplanes in this movie, yes there are good guys and bad guys, ya sorta have to to make a story. So yes we have seen these things before, but not like this. The planes flying through debris of exploded planes may, as the other reviewer put it, have been there for the 3D effect but I would not have thought of that if he hadn't said it. I thought the debris whizzing by was new, they didn't do that in the past! Those scenes, I thought the cg was fine, really helped make it feel as dangerous as it must have been to those pilots back in the day. The love story the human drama the loss and the elation of survival made this a film to be watched. Director Tony Bill knows how to get the best from his actors and put it on film, this he did here time and again. He is also a great story teller which is one reason I chose to watch this film despite the review I read. You get to know and care deeply about each and every character regardless of the screen time they get. Although we only see the German Ace a couple of times and never hear him speak, Bill caught this mans essence in those few frames. I WAS NO WHERE NEAR DISAPPOINTED.  You won't be either.

1609927,2,B00005JP86,"I picked this movie for two reasons. Firstly, I have always loved biplanes and biplane warfare and, as usual, this title looked sad and lonely on Amazon Instant Watch and in need of a review. So here we are.

The only really positive thing I can find to say about this movie is that it happens to be about a fascinating period of history. If you think about it flying around in a rickety wooden plane is a pretty daring thing to do even if people aren't shooting at you. That and the inevitable thoughts of Snoopy and his Snoopwith Camel make WWI aviation a very attractive topic.

No, the problem comes in right about the time the movie starts. If there's a standard war movie cliche line or shot that is laying about to be redone this movie redoes it. Often. And badly. You've got the wistful French girl looking to the sky as planes fly overhead. You've got the cockpit to cockpit waves goodbye as one pilot's plane goes down in flames. Everything that you've seen in every war movie before, you see here again. I guess you can look at this as a good retrospective of other cheesy war films if you really wanted to stretch it.

Also, a note on special effects. Considering when this movie was made, the CGI in this sucker are pretty abominable. Leave aside for a moment the completely bogus dogfights with dozens of fliers in undisturbed tight formation while anti-aircraft fire belches into the sky around them. Leave aside the numerical failure as 20 planes go out, 5 planes come back and somehow only 3 pilots were lost. As if that was not enough, the whole thing is littered with those special effects that make you think, ""Hmm. They put that in just so it would look 3D in the theatre version of the film."" It's a lot of visual drama just for the sake of visual drama.

In summary, totally unwatchable and beyond my ability to tolerate for more than an hour. I had such high hopes but sadly every single one of them was utterly disappointed by this film. Bah.

* based on a true story

* actors became their part
* shooting locations and cinematography
* special effects (just the right amount)

I'm glad I got the collector's edition, since I also enjoyed the DVD bonus features (for a list of the bonus features, see the Amazon description under ""Special Features"").  I look forward to watching this movie again in the future.

1609998,1,B00005JP86,"This movie sucks in a very big way.  Watch ANY movie about WWI made in the 1930's or before and you will see why this movie sucks so much.  The planes simply do not fly like real planes; it is just a freaking cartoon (which is what CGI is; ""CGI"" is ""Computer Generated Imagery"", or in other words, a cartoon made with a computer).  The people who did this are complete idiots, and the story sucks as well.  Really, this is about as worthless as films get.  There is no redeeming virtue to it.  If you decide to watch an old movie (anything made before WWII) about WWI, you will see them using real WWI planes, and consequently, they fly like real WWI planes.  Sure, some old movies from the 1930's and before often are dated and have silly, overblown acting, but the planes are real and consequently those films are vastly better than this worthless piece of garbage.

But for me, the piece de resistance was that single-seat biplanes could function as Vietnam-era helicopters, as our hero uses one to hop  into a farmer's field (at night) to rescue his love interest and the children.  I thought that was a great addition to our collective knowledge of World War I.

You know what would have been great?  Since they already had the CGI servers working overtime to make what is essentially an elaborate cartoon, they could have put in some scenes where the American pilots have to parachute into Rome and fight their way to freedom as gladiators in the company of Russell Crowe, perhaps also battling German tribesman screaming ""Zulu!"" over and over again.  They could have picked up some more pretty actors during the escape and hijacked the capacious U-571 and sailed it to England, where they would all fight in the Battle of Britain before being transferred to Hawaii in time for the Japanese sneak attack, which would itself be foiled by the arrival of a US nuclear carrier via a time portal.

1610097,3,B00005JP86,"On Dec 17, 1903, Orville Wright made history by flying the Kitty Hawk about ten feet above the ground.  The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered less than 200 feet.  He was moving at a speed of just 7 miles per hour!  Within a dozen years or so, technology had proceeded to the point where planes could fly over 100 MPH, with ceilings up to 20,000 feet.  Mount a machine gun and voila!  You have a new dimension in modern warfare: aerial combat.

Flyboys tells the story of a ragtag group of Americans who flew for France in World War I, before the United States officially entered the war.  The plot is fairly predictable for this genre, even cliche at points, but the movie still works thanks to some amazing CGI that gives photo realistic images of the aerial combat.  The cinematography is well done all around.

The acting was passable.  The performance of French actress Jennifer Decker was memorable, despite limited screen time.

The blu-ray transfer is outstanding--one of the best I have seen.  Amazing detail; rich colors; little or no film grain, even in nighttime shots.  Because of the gorgeous cinematography and CGI effects, this is a film where you want the best possible clarity, and this blu-ray delivers.  The sound is also very good.  The battle noises are effective, and the epic soundtrack plays great.

Parental Advisory: Flyboys features realistic wartime violence, mild language, drinking (but not drunkenness), and a couple of scenes in a brothel (but very tame by modern standards).  Also, a couple kiss in one scene.  The PG-13 rating is for the violence.  Apart from that, it would have been a mild PG.  This is a throwback to an older style of movie making.

I recommend this movie.  While fairly predictable, it nevertheless has some patriotic spirit and is beautiful to watch.  The three-star rating is for the movie.  If I were rating the blu-ray transfer only, I would give it a full five stars.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, do it.  You will not be sorry.",1354492800,17,2006,4.72543352601156

The aerial scenes are outstanding and it's actually good to know they could be done without injuries or crashes like some of the first World War I movies (Dawn Patrol comes to mind). The movie also pulls no punches about there being no glory in dogfights: if you were shot down, if the enemy's bullets didn't kill you the fall and crash most likely would.

The transfer is exceptional and the surround sound depth puts your system through its paces.

Historical accuracy aside concerning the planes, the movie is more about the people in the squadron than the flying. I generally like to watch a movie first, then watch the special features.  Not with this one.  Because it is based upon true events, watch the special features first, especially the section that details the history of the squadron and the people in the Lafayette Escadrilles.  Reviewers have mentioned that the characters are folks you don't care about.  You will care more if you watch the historical section first and learn about the true characters written into the film.

1610133,4,B00005JP86,"This is a story based on true events, about American volunteers who came to fight in France before their country entered the war and who became fighter pilots in the, now legendary, Escadrille Lafayette. I am a little surprised by the very poor reviews this movie is getting, because I rather liked it, although I am the first to recognise that it could be much, much better.

The strong point of this movie are the computer generated planes and air fights. WW I dogfights were a great movie material, because of their short range personal character - in fact, strangely enough, they remind me a little the STAR WARS fights between X-Wings and TIE fighters. Here the planes look really like real ones and the effect is great for any fan of aviation: Nieuport and Fokker fighters, Handley-Page and Gotha bombers and the gigantic L32 Zeppelin, they all give a great show. The movie is quite realistic and stresses well the incredibly idiotic decision of allied high command to NOT provide pilots with parachutes (Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians and even Turks had them, from the beginning of the war) on the incredible assumption, that pilots will jump from their planes at the first occasion!! That explains why the casualty rates in French, British, Italian and later American aviation were so high.

There are some very weak spots. Relations between pilots and especially all the conflicts are too pinky easy and sweet, which takes away most of the realism. The main hero accomplishes alone all the most incredible things, the rest of the unit being mostly his sidekicks. The ending is a little too previsible. The love story is going nowhere and we do not even know why. There is only one really bad guy in the movie and of course he is German, etc., etc.;

Jean Reno indeed is not very much used but this is a nice effort from Hollywood to hire a French to play a French officer, rather than just use an American and make him speak with a French accent... On this point, let's stress that this movie is a welcome pause in French bashing, which seems to be a kind of national sport in Hollywood this last years....

But all those weak points notwithstanding, I forgive to this movie a lot, for the scenes, when the Escadrille Lafayette takes off and is flying over the beautiful French landscapes, together with a flight of cranes... And then there is this unique scene, when a whole horde of red painted Fokkers emerges from the sunlight to butcher the unsuspecting American rookies, with the Black Falcon in the lead (yes, you guessed right, the Black Falcon is the plane of the BAD GUY).

There is also some good humor in ""Flyboys"" - a mascot lion named Whiskey, an American pilot who simply can not shoot straight no matters how much he tries, until.... well, no, no hints here, you will see by yourself. And the decorations of the planes, with my favorite being a seriously deranged woodpecker... This is a nice war movie, and a must if you are a fan of aviation and can simply not resist the sight of a flight of Fokkers going after some heavy Handley-Page bombers....",1338940800,,3075,4.666051660516605
1610134,3,B00005JP86,"A decent storyline and acceptable acting. The characters all tend to be stereotypes, but that doesn't detract too much. The limited sequences with real aircraft mainly serve to highlight the lack of realism in the CGI flying sequences. But then film makers have yet to produce realistic flying sequences with CGI. I'm just about convinced it can't be done.

Take any movie with CGI air combat sequences and compare those sequences to ones in movies like ""The Battle of Britain"" and ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and you'll realize just how pitiful CGI truly is. And CGI explosions (of anything) pale in comparison to movies where they really blow stuff up.

As an ex-AF pilot and military aviation historian (who has also written a WW I historical novel about air combat, 'Once a Knight'), I can't help but cringe whenever I watch CGI aircraft scenes. This movie was no exception.

Despite all of that, I did enjoy the movie. Overall, it was fun, and that's what movies are all about in the end.

One caution: I bought this DVD without noticing that there are two versions -- a 1-disc and a 2-disc. I ended up with the 1-disc with essentially no special features. I really wanted those special features (more than the actual movie). So be warned...and spend the extra couple of bucks for the 2-disc version!",1338336000,,1297,4.751111111111111
1610135,3,B00005JP86,"This movie could have been very good. The acting is for the most part believable - Martin Henderson in particular gives an excellent portrayal as the embittered, war-weary squadron commander, and is by far the standout performance. James Franco as always does well with what he has been given. The historical background of certain aspects of the Lafayette Escadrille is given screen time as well as World War 1 pilot training tactics - that's nice to see.

What destroys the film are the ridiculous aerial combat sequences. There are a few decent scenes but the bad far outweighs the good. Firstly, practically every German fighter is a DR-1 mocked up in the colours of Richtofen's Flying Circus - why sacrifice authenticity for a cliche? Then the directors felt the need to have an evil 'Enemy-Ace' who goes around strafing downed allied pilots as the central German antagonist. Instances like this did happen, but this is just another tired cliche that comes across as dismal. The worst offence however is the depiction of dogfighting. The idiotic manoeuvres and speeds portayed are totally unrealistic. Why do these film directors constantly feel the need to do this? It's as if the normal capabilities of the aircraft aren't enough for them (think Pearl Harbour vs. Dark Blue World or Independance Day vs. Top Gun - the difference is dramatic.) Then they'll throw in some gung-ho victory cry or cornball line to cap it off...

Rough Synopsis (without spoilers):-
The movie was inspired by a true story.

American cowboy joins the French Aerial squadron as a volunteer during WWI.

Rises through the ranks.

Along the way, the viewer is introduced to other air force volunteers, all with quirky personalities (and rituals like pre-match soccer superstars) and personal reasons for enlisting.

Includes a romantic plot when the cowboy meets a nice French girl.

Things get personal when the cowboy's fellow buddies are killed by a German Ace.

All of which builds up to a dramatic showdown in the air, ala ""High Noon"" in the skies.

Be sure to get your pop-corn ready before you press play! :)

I have heard many people say that it is not very accurate, but I have done extensive research into WWI air combat and the Lafayette Escadrille in particular, and I thought the movie was very well done. The only real anachronism I saw was that all the German planes in the movie were painted like the Red Baron, but in truth, the planes from both sides, looked so much alike that on a movie screen, it would be hard to tell who was shooting who, so I think it was a liberty that needed to be taken so as not to confuse the viewer.

The plot centers around a group of American mercenary pilots in France during World War I, prior to the U.S.' entry into the war.  They all come from different backgrounds and they all have different hopes and dreams.  And before the movies ends you'll find yourself really liking every one of them.  James Franco portrays the leader of the group and he comes across as likeable.  Perhaps a little not quite Texan enough looking, but likeable nonetheless.  And the love story between him and an orphaned French girl is a very sweet one.  The main flaw I found in the  movie is that the dialogue was unusually soft while the background music is unusually loud.

1610223,3,B00005JP86,"I think people rag on this movie a little too much. If it's not as good as the reigning classic of World War One dogfight films, 1966's The Blue Max, then at least it was a notch above most of what sat beside it in the multiplex in the fortnight it was out. (How many reviewers, seeking originality, headlined their write-ups ""Bombs Away""? More than a few.) Movies about the First World War are almost nonexistent today and I salute the courage it took to go out on a limb to tell a forgotten story.

All that said, yes, the technical inaccuracies, which I won't list here, did irk sensibilities a time or ten, and one couldn't help but feel the plot was something that got in the way of the special effects, which were often little short of spectacular, but the funny thing is I've found that the very points which instigated the greatest number of complaints about this film turned out to be those things which actually were based on the historical reality of the Escadrille de Lafayette, its experiences and its members. Go figure.

Flyboys isn't going to be a classic but what is? I personally think we're residing in the age of the anti-classic. Flyboys is watchable, has some good parts, and means well even when it comes up short. I admire the effort to produce this kind of low-appeal movie in the age of ""a blockbuster or else"" film making and am glad I own this title.

They freely admit that they took artistic licence with certain things for the sake of entertainment, which is fair enough. Unlike the makers of The Red Baron, whose producer/director claim with amazing straigh-faces that their movie is historically accurate, which is totally false.

The flight scenes from Flyboys were great, the characters were enjoyable and the aircraft were a joy to see in action. Once you get over the fact that the Germans are all flying red  Fokker triplanes, except of course, the EEEEEEVIL German, who naturally flies a black one, the combat scenes are worth the cost of the dvd alone. There is some genuine comedy in the movie, you can empathise with the characters and the photography was first rate. I can thoroughly recommend this movie for what it is.

Great entertainment!",1270252800,,1045,5.028901734104046

 Seriously though, the fighting sequences are great to watch, especially when you see the bullets flying through the air. If they would come out with more movies like this one, with the same technology, that would be great. Maybe less romance, and more flying action. the flying sequences were too short in my opinion.

NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either.

Partial power was achieved by intermittent blipping of the ignition kill switch and the inertia of the rotating engine mass keep them from stalling.

They had chocks on the wheels and the ground crew spun the prop. They usually took off from where they were parked and they taxied in blipping away to their parking place. If The Black Falcon propped his own airplane in the middle of the field, I can guarantee that his own prop would slice him up like a deli salami!

The story line was very simple, there was a sweet little tragic love story easily comprehended by a 9 year old, and some walloping good special effects of bi-planes flying and shooting each other. The effects are what one should watch this movie for, as they are able to induce suspended disbelief in even the most jaded viewer. One is left with a sense of respect for the men who did fly these planes back when there were no parachutes.

The complaints about the poor script, one-dimensional characters, uneven pacing, flat acting, unbelievable CGI effects, almost total lack of historical accuracy, etc. are all justified. The producers, director and screenwriters really hit  the mark with this one!

1610295,5,B00005JP86,"'Flyboys' is one of the best films I have ever seen, period. I was a skeptic of the movie at first, there have been so many good war movies made already, what could this one do to top any of them? While watching however, I was pleasantly surprised by not only the acting and storyline, but the soundtrack by Trevor Rabin put this one over the top.

Also, 'Flyboys' is based on the real life adventures of the Escadrille Lafayette, created during the early years of WWI by the French to allow volunteer American pilots to fight even though the U.S. had not entered the war. The fact that every character in this film was real makes it hit home. You really become attached to each of the main characters as they struggle to live and fight honorably in a war with very little purpose behind it.

'Flyboys' is the first 'modern' era film to attempt a portrayal of this particular story, and it does an AMAZING job. The effects, particularly the dogfights, are epic, and as mentioned, Trevor Rabin's soundtrack compliments the movie perfectly. The film summarizes itself succinctly  during the opening titles...

""Though the airplane was only recently invented, it was quickly adapted for war. The young men who flew them became the first fighter pilots, and a new kind of hero was born...""

1610300,5,B00005JP86,"Flyboys is a 2006 American drama film set during World War I, starring James Franco, Martin Henderson, Jean Reno, Jennifer Decker, David Ellison, Abdul Salis, Philip Winchester and Tyler Labine. It was directed by Tony Bill, a pilot and aviation enthusiast.[1] Screenplay was written by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans and David S. Ward with the screen story by Blake T. Evans.

The film follows the enlistment, training and combat experiences of a group of young Americans who volunteer to become fighter pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille, the 124th air squadron formed by the French in 1916. The squadron consisted entirely of American volunteers who wanted to fly and fight in World War I during the main years of the conflict, 1914-1917, before the United States later joined the war against the Central Powers. A group of young Americans go to France, for different personal reasons, and volunteer to fight in the French Air Service, L'Aronautique militaire, during World War I prior to America's entrance into the war. One of the main characters, Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) faced with the foreclosure of his family ranch in Texas, decides to enlist after seeing a newsreel of aerial combat in France. Dilettante Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) joins because of his overbearing father. African-American boxer Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), who had been accepted as an athlete in France, was motivated to ""pay back"" his adopted country. These American recruits were under the command of French Captain Georges Thenault (Jean Reno), while the veteran fighter ace Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson), a fellow American, takes over as their mentor.

During their training, the film mainly deals with the struggles each pilot has with the demanding flying; later, the focus shifts to the aerial dogfights that dominate the front line missions. Themes of camaraderie, racial prejudice, revenge and love are also explored. The film ends with an epilogue that relates each film character to the real-life Lafayette Escadrille figures on which the movie was based.[2] One charming touch in this film is that the hero is given a small bear, which he carries as a good luck charm. This is an obvious reference to the small bear carried as a good luck charm by a pilot in ""Wings,"" a silent film about the Lafayette Escadrille, which, in 1927, was the first film ever to win the Academy Award for best picture.",1237248000,,2393,5.055696202531646
1610301,5,B00005JP86,"I am a history teacher (10th grade) and I use this for about 20 mins.  The part when they are in air combat, no-man's land, and the Zepellion scene are good.",1233619200,,157,4.064516129032258
1610302,3,B00005JP86,"There's something both romantic and intimidating about the mechanized slaughter that plagued Europe at the beginning of the 20th century during what that generation called 'the GREAT War' and we call World War One. While French and Germans were slaughtering each other on the ground by the millions with the help of first generation tanks, early model machine guns and clouds of mustard gas, some privileged few were confronting their enemies in the air, riding on small, fragile, underpowered but deadly airplanes, trying to obliterate opponents riding the same or protecting/attacking bomb-carrying larger, motorized flying machines or giant, bloated, terror-inspiring airships.

It's a historical fact that a handful of American took sides in this battle at a time their own country, the United States, was officially neutral. They decided to help the French side by forming their own Escadrille Lafayette of flying knights. The Escadrille, famous for its bravery AND its partying while off duty, distinguished itself at Verdun and many of its members were recognized as Aces, some receiving valuable French medals for bravery.

The movie attempts to follow, to the extent that a fiction movie can, the historical record. We see the initial members as they make their decision to fight for France, we watch them train and then we watch them fight the Germans. It's fighter vs. fighter, fighter attacking the enemy's bombers, fighter protecting their own bombers, fighter attacking the Zeppelin and fighter strafing the enemy air base and, on several occasions, we watch air duels between Aces on either side. In addition, there is some romance, a tiny bit of racial tension and we watch some personal problems as they are dealt with by the squad's members.

This is a very visual, CGI enhanced to the point of almost cartoonish-looking movie when it comes to the numerous dogfight scenes and its most attractive feature is the air battles. The scruffy and fragile-looking French fighters, the intimidating, red-colored German Fokkers, the bombers, the Zeppelin, they all look spectacular in ways that only today's video enhancement technologies can produce. One may conclude that, maybe there's too much fighting and too little character development but this is not a psychological drama. It's about aerial fighting and this is what we get to see in a movie that comes pretty close to being a WW1 documentary. All the little conflicts between the squad's members or between them and the French military or the other American volunteers are insignificant when viewed within the context of the war against the Germans.

The movie is good at what it attempts to deliver - in this case, the dogfights -  but, after a while, the fighting gets repetitive and the movie seems to be stretching a bit too long. This is as close to a pure dogfight action movie as it gets.

Recommended as a rental or even as a keeper for any lover of war action videos.

P.S. While many of the details are fictionalized enhancements or pure inventions, it is historically true that the squadron had lions as pets. The movie shows us one. In fact, they had TWO lion cubs named Whiskey and Soda.",1232755200,,3170,5.038167938931298
1610303,2,B00005JP86,"Flyboys is rather a disappointment even if you're not expecting much. The Lafayette Escadrille - a French squadron of American pilots who fought in the First World War before the USA entered the conflict - is a great subject for a film, but somehow keeps on falling short. William Wellman's semi-autobiographical Lafayette Escadrille was so brutally re-edited by the studio that he never made another film, yet Tony Bill's film feels like it could have done with a firmer hand somewhere down the line. Rather than a gritty, brutally realistic war movie it harks back to silent cinema and WW2 flagwavers, concentrating on often-cartoonish heroics by one-dimensional characters unmemorably played by a bland cast. With a charismatic star in the lead this might not have been an insurmountable problem, but with only Jean Reno as their commander providing any star quality the film is often as flat as the ill-advised digital photography that makes much of the film look like a Turner TV movie at times. Even on the small screen its lack of detail, depth and limited colour range are distractingly problematic. It doesn't make particularly good use of its 138-minute running time and there's surprisingly little sense of time or place either. The characters' attitudes are often more late than early-20th century while its attitude to accuracy is schizophrenic: it gets a lot of pertinent small details right while larger ones slip by unchecked if they look cool enough (if the film is to be believed, the German air force consisted almost entirely of red triplanes).

As vanity projects go (the film was allegedly largely financed by co-star David Ellison's billionaire father), it's certainly not as disastrous as Gunbus/Sky Bandits, but like that forgotten box-office fiasco it suffers from trying to make an old-fashioned gung ho adventure set in the one war in which such comic book heroics have never seemed at home. Using the industrial killing fields of the first modern war as a backdrop for an action movie seems almost like setting The Great Escape in Auschwitz. But even ignoring that, it fails to work on its own terms as a simple adventure story. There's far too much unconvincing melodrama, be it James Franco carrying out an unlikely rescue of a pilot crashed in No Man's Land or an even more unlikely rescue of his sweetheart and her siblings from behind German lines. However, even these cannot prepare you for the absurdity of the way he finally takes on the dastardly homicidal Hun in the underwhelming finale: all that's missing is Franco saying ""Sayonara, sucker!"" It's not that such things couldn't or didn't happen as that the film fails to sell them in a more cynical age.

But the biggest problem is the aerial scenes, primarily dependent on Cgi. You may not always be able to see the joins, but it's often curiously unconvincing as weightless planes defy the laws of aerodynamics for a cool shot, with the mayhem often cut short because computer-rendering time is so expensive. The camera may be able to get right in the thick of the action, but you never once feel like you're flying with the characters and it's never as impressive as the kind of footage the likes of Skeets Kelly and Johnny Jordan were able to get in the The Blue Max and Aces High, let alone earlier classics like Wings and The Dawn Patrol. And there's the problem that when you know it's just pixels rather than real people in real planes, all sense of danger and peril is gone. CGI may be easier and safer, but who says it SHOULD be easier? The choreography of the dogfights isn't that impressive either - for the first half of the film adequate seems to be the aim, with only a sequence where the pilots take on German planes strafing refugee columns really catching fire and living up to its potential. Even an attack on a Zeppelin seems more okay than inspired. Certainly there's nothing in the film to compare to the dazzling but brief Hell's Angels scenes in The Aviator. Adding to the general lack of inspiration is Trevor Rabin's score, which wears the film's temp track proudly on its sleeve - parts of it follow The Patriot so closely that you wonder why they didn't just give John Williams a screen credit of his own.

It's watchable enough if you're in an undemanding mood, and Jennifer Decker makes an appealing leading lady, but it's hard to shake the feeling that the material would have worked better as a weekly TV series - though, if it were anything like this film, one that would probably be cancelled after a handful of episodes.",1232496000,8,4546,4.795918367346939
1610304,2,B00005JP86,"The film starts with a view of the heavens. The recently invented flying machine was adopted by armies as an observation platform that was better than the earlier tethered balloon. In September 1914 an observation airplane saw the German flanking attack, they were able to stop it at the first Battle of the Marne using the taxis of Paris (fast mechanized deployment). The way to stop observation airplanes was to shoot them down with another armed airplane. First rifles, then machine guns. The way to stop an armed fighter was with another armed fighter. Bombing was another development, as well as anti-aircraft guns. Trench warfare prevented the maneuvers used by generals of the past. A stalemate followed.

A young man in Texas wants to get out of town. Another leaves Nebraska for ""The War to End War"". An American boxer joins the Lafayette Escadrille. So too a dropout from Harvard. The men meet their mascot ""Whiskey"" and the issue of racism. The men undergo elementary training in flying and tactics. The average life of a pilot was six weeks. The German Air Force predominated in 1916. Fighters will accompany Handley-Page bombers to attack German supplies. No parachutes for pilots. ""Beware of the Hun in the sun!"" There is a dogfight, some are shot down. One flyer seeks love. There is a pleasant scene. Then they are scrambled to pursue German bombers. Another dogfight with wins and losses.

One flyer returns to see a girlfriend. There is a drama in the history of one flyer. Why did he miss his target? A flight of Fokkers attacked a town, the Lafayette Escadrille comes to the rescue. One pilot lands in No Man's Land, and is rescued in an incredible manner. Was the war meaningless? Who will win? Can one flyer rescue his girlfriend? [Did anyone fly at night then?] It was a dramatic rescue. ""Don't ever do that again!"" Next they attack a Zeppelin. [These bombed London at night.] The film shows the effects of machine gun fire on the pilots and airplanes. The hospital is being evacuated. Will they meet again? There is another mission to attack Jametz. This time it will be a flanking attack to surprise the enemy with escorted bombers. There is another dogfight to let the bombers get through. There is a last dogfight between the fighter airplanes. Will the good guy survive? The last scenes tell about the flyer's future.

This is a good film in spite of the story. This film uses CGI to recreate the known past. A better story makes a better film. You may find a book about this subject educational. Hollywood provides entertainment, not history. [""They Fought for the Sky"" by Quentin Reynolds.]",1232150400,,2620,4.792035398230088

What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife.  The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.

1610338,1,B00005JP86,"How can I sum up this movie: Low budget CGI, terrible acting, terrible lines, Clich storyline, mediocre action, cheesy revolting love story, and untrue to life.  I would have to say the best actor in the movie probably was the lion.  Yes, there is a lion in a WWI movie, can you believe it?

I found the dramatic dog fighting scenes actually quite comical.  Once you realize the planes are CGI, the dogfights are almost as enjoyable as watching a PS3 game.  The true horror of the film is watching the star of the show (Spiderman's best friend) try to woo a (almost retarded) French girl that likes to visit a local brothel for recreation.  I had to vomit several times during their less than bearable dialogue.  In one part of the movie, the leading character flies to her house to give her a joy ride in his plane. Yeah, I'm sure that happened all the time during a little war like WWI.  Also, I swear the movie's soundtrack was used in about every other major blockbuster movie of the past, in an attempt to make the movie seem of a higher quality.  I was actually relieved when the scratched blu-ray I rented locked up during the ending of the movie, so I wouldn't have to sit through much more of this pathetic excuse for a war movie.

Questions to ask:
Why was a French girl bandaging up injured war pilots in a brothel?
How does a guy land a plane 100 yards next to his girlfriend's house with German guards all around without anyone noticing?
How come they give a guy a medal rather than shooting him on site for stealing a squadron plane to save his retarded girlfriend?
How do you chop off someone's hand with a dull field shovel?
How is it that new pilots are suddenly artistic enough to paint professional looking logos on their planes?
How can you shout commands at each other over the plane engines and wind noise during a dogfight?
Why would you stand and wave your arms in open enemy territory after being shot down during a dogfight?
Why would you do a solo suicide mission against a dozen nazi fighters, so you could revenge your friends?
How do you do -3 G jet fighter maneuvers in a 65 Horsepower WWI plane?
What was Bubba Gump's little brother doing in this movie?

The acting, by mostly unknowns, is okay and there is little cursing and no nudity.  The period costuming and sets are very well done.  The battle scenes are not gory nor grotesque.

1610384,5,B00005JP86,"Here is a story about some of the very first military aviators the world has ever seen.  While hot air balloons were used during the Civil War to survey battlefields, WWI was the first conflict in which military aviation made a huge impact on the outcome.

Long before flight simulators, ejection seats and pilot training schools (which take years & years to complete), the world saw pilots who flew by the seat-of-their pants and took just a few months to become qualified to take to the skies.  They used incredibly primitive flight simulators to learn what they could on the ground, and there was little rm to develop bad habits as they were pushed straight into conflict as soon as they were able to control their aircraft.

James Franco is an up & coming actor who has his chance as a sort Errol Flynn role, and he pulls it off nicely.  His character is a Texan who finds himself @ the end of his rope.  So, he sets off for France during WWI and becomes a fighter pilot.  Along the way, he meets up with several other Americans doing the same thing.  While they may have fudged some details, all of the major characters in the film depict historical people.

It's unfortunate that this movie didn't do all that great at the box office.  World War One doesn't generate a lot of interest these days, and that's a shame.  Up until WWII, it was the most important war the world had ever seen.  Sadly, its mantra as the ""War to end all wars"" has long since become an obsolete concept.  Nevertheless, it is a vitally important war for us to understand as its a war our great grandparents fought in.

Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner.  In execution, it is a disappointment.  They ruined a potentially good story.  Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.

Not all German planes were red, not all German planes were Fokker Triplanes (only around 300 made) they had a short run because of manufacturing problems, wings would come apart in a dive. The real airplanes of that time could not do half of the aerobatics that they show in the movie, they also would self destruct from G forces. They were mainly wood and fabric. They had 2 lions (whiskey & soda) not just one. There was a black pilot, but he came in late in the war and only had 1 and possibly 2 confirmed kills. I am now waiting for the new movie ""The Red Baron"" that was made in Germany and will be released on May 10th in Europe. It at least looks very accurate compared to the garbage that they put into The Flyboys. The movie is fair, but I would not go out of my way to purchase it if I new of all the historical mistakes in it.

There are a lot of similarities in the film -- both feature American boys going off to France in World War I as aerial aces; both films have lengthy romantic interludes; and both feature pretty good air action scenes in dogfights with Germans.

Yet it is, ironically, the older film that is more authentic, more fun, has better flying scenes, and has better music than its newer mate. ""Wings"", which was among Gary Cooper's first films, is more naive in its ""script"" (it's a silent film) but far more realistic and exciting in its all-important aerial scenes.

What ""Flyboys"" does with aerial excitement is pretty typical and bland by 21st century standards. Most of the scenes are computer-generated and feature things that could not possibly happen mixed with a perfection that obviously wasn't the case in 1918, when the United States officially entered the war.

In one instance, an American flyboy -- being tailed by a German -- lets off the throttle, the plane goes backward, and his stationary wheels rip through the upper fuselage of the German plane, knocking it out of air. Sure, that could happen, uh huh.

Both films features lengthy and boring love scenes but, again, the older movie has the better stuff. The love scenes between Buddy Rogers and his female star in ""Wings"" is more authentic, more interesting and, frankly, more realistic than the nonsense that goes on being American flyboys and French girls that don't even speak the same language.

Still, this movie is good for an evening's entertainment but people around here giving it five stars and saying it's great apparently have never seen another film. This movie has long, long boring sequences between the action and it goes on far too long. At almost 130 minutes, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long. It could have been edited compactly to fit a 95-minute span that would have left viewers fresh and involved. As it is, it overstays its welcome by at least a half-hour.

If you are thinking of renting or buying ""Flyboys"", do yourself a favor and watch ""Wings"" from 1927 instead. That movie has the best World War I air sequences ever filmed and, by comparison with ""Flyboys"", is still exceptionally relevant in 2008.",1208563200,,2450,5.14321608040201

I love the early years of aviation, the old style dog fighting in bi-planes and the like, so I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to go see Flyboys on the big screen.  While not the greatest film, it was worth the price of admission and was filled with enough aircraft acrobatics to be great fun.

Thankfully this disc comes with some interesting extras in the special features that help raise the value when considering a purchase.

The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.

Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.

1610455,1,B00005JP86,"As someone with a great interest in WWI, I had high hopes for ""Flyboys"" but found it to be a rather excruciating experience watching one-dimensional cardboard cutouts religiously follow every single last cliche' in the Hollywood playbook. A movie about a group of Americans who violated their nation's neutrality laws to fight for a foreign power in a senseless, fratricidal war, I was going to give it 2 stars for the impressive dogfighting scenes, thinking at least some of it was performed by actual pilot reenactors, until I found out that it was all CGI-generated and technologically anachronistic to boot. In any case, all the action in the world couldn't save a movie with such a predictable story and such generically boring characters.

A professor once told me that a quick test of the quality of a novel or movie's characterization is whether you remember the characters' names. This movie was so mind-numbing, I was lucky to remember my own name by the end, never mind the protagonist's! I don't know if these were bad actors or they just had bad material to work with, but my family and I certainly didn't remember anyone's names, and were forced to refer to the characters by their physical attributes. Unfortunately, only a few of them- Blackie, Fatty and Spiderman-guy- had any kind of unique features, while the rest seemed as undistinguishable as snowflakes. We were glad when one of them got his hand cut off, because he then gained an identity as ""Hookhand"", and we were hoping the others would similarly discover their individuality- i.e. Burnedface, Lack-nose, One-eye - but we were disappointed.

As terrible as the characters were- and I can't describe to you the interminable horror of watching a monolingual American try to woo a retarded French girl- the plot was even more disgraceful. If you've ever seen any sports movie, you've seen this one: A motley group of American misfits initially get their clocks cleaned by big, bad German bullies, led by the ""Black Falcon."" Our scrappy Yanks get their act together and start to hold their own against the German B-team. When the Black Falcon knocks out our ace, the young hero vows revenge, which he dramatically achieves with the unexpected help of a character previously thought to be useless.

1610457,3,B00005JP86,"In ""Flyboys"" we enter the world of brave, daring fighter pilots during World War I. It is based on real events, namely ""the Lafayette Escadrille,"" the squadron formed largely by American volunteers who joined in the French Air Service before America entered the war. This is an intriguing episode that should be remembered, and ""Flyboys"" lives up to our expectations as far as its great aerial sequences are concerned.

James Franco (""Spider-Man"") appears as Blaine Rawlings, Texan rancher who becomes one of the American volunteers after seeing a news reel in theater (and punching a banker off-screen). It's not a bad start, but still his character could have been more three dimensional with a better script and direction. Actually, he and other members of the Lafayette Escadrill are not given many chances to shine, especially on the ground.

In fact, the back stories of the volunteers sometimes look clichd and Blaine's sub-plot involving a French farm girl drags a bit. Jean Reno plays a French captain who has to train the new recruits patiently, but like ""The Da Vinci Code,"" somehow the director missed the opportunity to use Reno's unique persona effectively.

Still, all these flaws would be forgotten once the film starts showing the dogfights, which, I think, are mostly done with CGIs, but still impressive and thrilling. The great flying sequences would bring us back to the day of good, old-fashioned action films.",1196294400,3,1432,5.085106382978723
1610458,1,B00005JP86,"For starters, the plot of Flyboys is predictable from start to finish.  Hot-shot American pilot joins French Escadrille, defies French veterans, romances local girl, becomes hero.  Although the plot is completely unoriginal, the movie loses all credibility as soon as the action starts.

There are plenty of reviews that tell how flawed this movie is from a historical perspective, so I won't get into that.

The special effects that some reviewers called ""spectacular"" were cheap, tacky, unrealistic, and downright laughable.  The most glaring example is during dogfights when the aircraft guns are fired.  The smoke from the guns was shown traveling ahead of the aircraft, all the way to the enemy aircraft in fact.  Smoke coming out of an aircraft flying at any speed would dissipate immediately to the rear.  Even if there were tracer rounds back then (which there weren't), they wouldn't emit thick black smoke.

Some storyline points were simply ridiculous.

When one of the pilots crash lands, the hero lands his plane in crossfire of a trench battle on rocky, cratered ground littered with jagged pieces of metal to save him.  This is ridiculous by itself.  Then when he finds his buddy's hand trapped under the plane, he amputates it with one swing of a lightweight field shovel instead of simply lifting the plane off his hand (which he easily could have done with a cloth-covered aircraft).

The hero repeatedly borrows his plane from the squadron to visit the local girl, without even a reprimand from the squadron commander.  In one scene, German soldiers occupy the house with the woman and the children inside.  At least one soldier is standing guard outside.  The hero lands his plane a couple of hundred yards away, walks to the house, and rescues them, undetected by the Germans.  Then when he starts his engine to leave, every head turns, alert to the engine sound.  But of course they're too late to catch him.

In one scene, just after the squadron lands from a dogfight, the hero decides to take off again by himself.  Seconds later he is seen singlehandedly shooting up a line of German fighter planes, neatly parked in a row at an undefended airfield.

I'm a small plane pilot, so I could go on about cloth-covered planes with 80-horsepower engines doing vertical climbs and jet-fighter maneuvers.  But sadly, the realism was much worse in other ways.

The aerial-battle scenes might be the best-ever shown on film but with today's ever-improving cameras, techniques, special-effects with computer knowledge, it's no surprise the flying scenes looked so good. (Think what we'll see on screen in 10 years!) The fight scenes are not overdone, either.

Most of the movie centers more on the drama and romantic side than that of action. The romance only involves one of the fliers and it's nicely, tastefully done...and very touching. The actress who plays the part, Jennifer Decker (""Lucienne""), is just beautiful and a wholesome-looking lady. You can see why the flier ""Blaine Rawlings (James Frano) fell for her right away, even though neither could speak the other's language.

Anyway, the main story is all about all the fighters and some of the missions they flew. This is based on fact and that means it's not always a happy ending for everyone. In some respects, World War I might be the most brutal war ever fought.

Overall, this a nice, old-fashioned epic-type story told without much profanity so I would it would suitable for most of the family.",1189296000,3,1884,4.94620253164557
1610515,4,B00005JP86,Flyboys does a very good job portraying the action and emotion of the first world war. The movie has plenty of opportunity to drag but skillfully aviods this downfall. It is an excellent job of editing and directing. The special effects are used to improve the visual story but are not allowed to run away with the film.,1188864000,2,320,4.5344827586206895
1610516,2,B00005JP86,"I went into this movie with very few expectations. I was looking to showcase a new Blu-ray player on my 60"" Sony XBR, and as I am a big fan of most military movies, I thought I'd give it a shot.

Boy, I really wish I had spent my money elsewhere. The acting was incredibly poor across the board - I'm usually a fan of Jean Reno, but lets face it - he has his genre (Ronin as an example), and this is most definitely not it. The script seemed almost amateur at times, and throughout the whole film I found myself wishing I could find a way to attach myself to atleast one of the characters so as to better enjoy it... alas, no such luck. There seemed to be very little character development, and what little there was, felt rushed. The romance was poorly executed, and as beautiful as Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) is, I'm afraid it couldn't save me from wishing that I were somewhere else throughout the whole film.

The film's one saving grace was on the technical side. The transfer was very good to excellent, with crisp, bright colors, and deep blacks throughout, and the audio - while not great by any respect, certainly wasn't terrible either. Unfortunately, most of the CGI was right about what you'd expect from a B-grade movie, and it was readily aparent in some scenes that the planes were... well, not actually planes.

In short, unless you are a die-hard aviation buff, and are willing to overlook the film's many faults, I would suggest passing on this one - it might make for a decent rental but little more.",1187654400,3,1519,4.456834532374101

1610518,1,B00005JP86,"I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This clich-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead.",1185753600,3,961,4.83030303030303
1610519,4,B00005JP86,"This is the story in WW1 of Americans that became pilots in a French unit before the USA entered the war. It shows how they came for many reasons adventure, to escape, idealism etc. How accurate is it, I suspect a fair  bit although I did not like the way the Germans are shown as evil in this film. Something I don't think warranted by their behaviour in WW1.

The acting is below average. When they showed the daily lives of the people and the pilots in no scenes could I say they grabbed me. Often I found them boring even scenes that were suppose to be gripping. Partly I suspect because the lives of the people were not interesting, real life often is not gripping and partly because I did not think much of their acting.

However it is different with the action scenes. They were terrific. Imagine being is such a plane, which in today's terms is junk without a parachute. Dangerous to just fly and these guys were fighting one another up there. If anything goes wrong with the plane you are dead. They must have been extremely brave men. You could feel what it must have been like.

The filming is good.

It is worth a look if you like air force movies.",1184889600,3,1160,4.3271889400921655
1610520,4,B00005JP86,"When I saw the shorts for ""Flyboys"", I had to wonder if it were another rehashed version of the abominable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pearl-Harbor-Two-Disc-60th-Anniversary-Commemorative-Edition/dp/B00003CXTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pearl Harbor (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition)</a>, about which I still have the occasional nightmare. I won't be having nightmares about ""Flyboys"".

Set in the First World War, it follows the journey of a group of young Americans who decide, for various reasons of their own, to enlist with the French forces to fly against the Germans. They did this before the USA entered the war. Learning to fly canvas and wood planes, they soon find out the realities of air warfare and the skills of their enemies.

The acting is fairly average and most of the dogfighting and aerial shots are CGI images. However, that is understandable considering there are not many of the aeroplanes left, and anyone who has built a replica would be naturally possessive and protective. That said, I thought the CGI had been well done, indeed, and was far superior to a lot that shows up in war movies. The quality was very good.

For the historical inaccuracies that some have mentioned, you would have to be very knowledgable in the field of First World War aviation to pick them up, except the most obvious ones. For the average viewer, these concerns will not take away from the overall plot or enjoyment of the movie. The one point I thought was a bit rich was Rawlings landing his plane and running into No Man's Land to rescue a downed pilot. The fact that some of the best machine gunners in the world at that time could not hit him was a glaring oversight.

The concession made to the performance of the aeroplanes themselves is also understandable in my own opinion. For the sheer spectacle of combat, I can see why they ""enhanced"" the performance of the planes themselves. The real thing would not have been able to do vertically climb as they did in the movie, (true), or do such snappy moves, (true), but that would have been less than exciting if the makers had stuck strictly to the reality.

For sheer spectacle, this movie more than makes up for its short-comings. It is visually gripping and very much an action drama. Considering it is the first movie about First World War fliers in some decades that I know of, it was a refreshing and pleasant movie to see. I really enjoyed it.",1184803200,4,2476,5.029268292682927

1610522,5,B00005JP86,"This is a very good movie. Being an aviation buff for many years, I am so glad that movie making technology has reached the state it has today when aircaft have a chance to be represented at least CLOSE to what they actually looked like. Just look at some of the previous movies where enemy aircraft have been represented by aircraft which they did not even closely resemble: P-51 Mustangs painted gray to represent Me-109 German aircraft in WWII movies or AT-6 aircraft marked with Japanese insignia. The reason: they were not available anywhere either in flying condition or even for display on a flying field. Maybe the aircraft in ""Flyboys"" weren't completely historically correct in markings or the combat scenes weren't what you would expect but how many of the reviewers of this movie are historical experts or have ever seen a Neuiport 17? Maybe the computer folks who made this movie needed to do a little more research on markings and such before they released this movie but at least their techniques are a start. Give them credit for that. As far as the story line goes, Hollywood will ALWAYS be Hollywood and action and love stories sell.

1610552,4,B00005JP86,"I hadn't heard much about this movie and I hadn't heard of any of the actors before so I was reluctant to watch it, but it's a great medium-budget movie! I love all war/historical movies that are based on real people. This movie follows about 7 military pilots in WWI that are based on real Americans or on composite characters. It's not as dramatic and over-the-top as a big-budget war movie, but that makes it a lighter form of entertainment. I'm going to buy the DVD so I can watch it again and share it with other people, whereas I couldn't stomach re-watching Private Ryan. If you've ever enjoyed an airshow, you'll love the old-time planes in the movie. The pilots are exposed to the elements, sticking out of small paper-wing airplanes with prop engines that need to be started by hand, and glide to a stop in open fields. One of the characters says ""planes were only invented 10 years ago!"" All the pilots had interesting life stories, one an aristocrat, one the son of a slave.. there is also a love story with the James Franco/Blaine character which I liked (he's quite handsome!).",1183766400,,1091,4.6

I came back with another new distinction about life.,1183680000,,297,4.321428571428571
1610555,1,B00005JP86,Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad movie. The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior. For those who are willing to put up with a mess just to look at recreations of old airplanes its probably worth buying but be prepared for alot of dissapointment if you are looking for a good movie.,1183334400,15,635,4.578947368421052

So, the movie...and spoiling it.  WW1 was before me, but the Flyboys movie wasn't.  I loved the scene where someone lost a hand but not their life.  The star is amazing at fighting in the air, leading in the air, leading on the ground, and just being centered.  He falls in love in France where they are stationed (he is enlisted as a U.S. help towards France before U.S. enters the war).  He saves her and her dead brother's 3 children at the last moment.

The end:  The movie ends with a ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" written ending, one where each character has their life play out.  Our hero, played by James Franco, never finds 1 of:  his love, or his farm, or his mind, or his gun, or his plane, or his partner, or his pants...find out in THE MOVIE!",1183334400,,983,4.232432432432432

1610558,2,B00005JP86,"I confess I was entertained by the movie -in those moments when I wasn't screaming at the TV. Some of the historical inaccuracies were so glaring that even for a work of fiction it was hard to swallow. At the beginning the movie states that 9 million would eventually die in WWI - soliders perhaps. That total is nowhere complete if you add in the civillian dead. A good number of which would have come from the area in which the characters were fighting. The Verdun front was a wasteland for miles - towns were obliterated from the shelling - the area around the fronts were ruined for not years but decades. No cheery farmhouse with well-fed children, no trees or plowed fields visible from the air, nothing but death and destruction for miles and miles. Trench warfare was not confined to a thin sliver. Though the front itself moved only yards the shelling and death reigned over an extended area. There are villages in the area that never returned and if you drive over the battlefield even now 90 years later as I did, you can still see the craters and hills caused by the shelling. The aviators were above the day to day merciless killing field but they were not untouched by it. My biggest problem with the film was the complete santization of WWI. The northern part of France and southern Belgium were devasted far more thoroughly than even Germany in WWII. It was truely hell on earth. Other reviewers have addresed the inaccuracies in the planes used - do not get me started on the mechanized land transportation. Tanks were only beginning to be developed and would not have been used as shown - also correct me if I am wrong but the Germans had already crossed the Meuse River much earlier in the War. At this point in time they would have been drive back - probably by Black Jack Pershing. The producers could have spent a bit more money on some historical research and less on their computer graphics. They did not get their money's worth there either. As it was, I could never tell who was who during the arial combat sequences. I would have sworn one fellow was dead only to have him reappear later in the movie.

Tony Bill somehow directed this could-have-been-a-TV-movie-or-mini-series onto the big screen for an approximate $13 million box office take. After DVD sales I suppose the $$$ intake will be better than TV so what the heck do I know.

But the acting and story execution are such that you'd think it was made for TV. The action scenes are really fun, but questionably believable as the aces chat with each other over their flying machines in mid air and hoot and holler like they're in a rodeo.

The ground scenes are mostly tough too watch. One ground battle scene is so outrageously unbelievable that the credibility meter flat-lines for a few minutes there at that point in the movie. And then there's the underlying love story that is so poorly done and unnecessary that cutting it completely would not have taken away one iota of the true story of a group of the first WWI fighter pilots.

This could easily have been a 90-minute movie, but Hollywood for whatever reason has decided not to release a film under the 120 minute mark anymore. In Flyboys you'll find yourself hooting and hollering for more dogfight action as the ground scenes roll on.

Overall...I didn't not like the movie. I was entertained. But, given a second chance, I'd wait to see this where it was meant to be: on TV (or cable).

1610691,3,B00005JP86,"The real actors?

Well, there's poor James Franco, a fine young actor, who must be cursing his bad luck in getting to play the leading man only in movies plagued by rotten screenplays and supporting casts, and also in losing the leading man role (and then having to play second fiddle) to some wimp in that blockbuster series of all time, Spider-man...

And then there's Jean Reno, Hollywood's favorite token Frenchman (even though he was born in Morocco to Spanish parents, as Juan Moreno), once again playing the earnest, understanding wise man with the funny French accent........ gosh, if only all French people could be just like him! ......especially those nasty waiters and shopkeepers in Paris, and those anti-American French politicians......

This movie had so many clich&eacute;d scenes in it that I began to realize that the filmmakers must have thought that they could get away with it because the younger movie-going generation wouldn't recognize these as clich&eacute;s, since most are from an older generation of movies.  It must save money to just recycle the old classic scenes, instead of hiring better, more original screenwriters.

There's the obligatory sendoff at the train station with the girlfriend running alongside the train (I winced during this scene, half expecting the girl to run splat into a signpost.........ooops, wrong movie, that was from one of the ""Hot Shots"" series);  the obligatory first fight at the bar amongst the airmen;  the obligatory hero's death with kamikaze swan dive into the mission target;  the obligatory hero saves girl - hero loses girl plot;  the obligatory devout Christian, who might as well have also been carrying a sign saying ""I'LL BE DEAD MEAT SOON"" along with his Bible.

So what about the non-actors?

Chief among them has to be David Ellison,  son of billionaire Larry Ellison of Oracle Software.  Daddy helped finance a good chunk of the $60 million budget of this movie which meant that, despite a complete lack of any acting ability, on a scale similar to the fiasco that was Jake Lloyd (little Anakin - Stars Wars, Phantom Menace), and despite an intensely annoying screen presence equivalent to that of Jar Jar Binks from that same movie, David Ellison gets huge amounts of screen time, including a constant series of brief cutaway shots focused on him, designed to subliminally remind the viewer that he's in this movie........OOOOOFFTA........can you spell N-A-R-C-I-S-S-I-S-T ?

Another near non-actor, Jennifer Decker - the girl who plays James Franco's love interest Lucienne.  OK, she's sort of cute, but who told her that the way to play a French girl who doesn't speak English is to act like a deaf-mute?  How the heck did SHE get this role?  We used to come to the answer to that question quite easily, but unfortunately, it is no longer politically correct to say such things in public.

Historically, a number of things are not quite right.  The Nieuport 17s that the airmen are supposedly flying had rotary engines, not the radial engines depicted.  NONE of the fighters of WWI had radial engines in fact, since air cooling technology had not developed fully to allow for fixed cylinder heads (in the rotary engines, the cylinder heads of the engine spun around together with the propeller, thus providing superior air cooling).  In any case, the Lafayette Escadrille would quickly lose the Nieuport 17s and mostly fly SPADs (which had inline engines) for much of the war.

And those bullet holes!  Come on!  The planes were made of fabric and wood, and had absolutely NO ARMOR!  If bullets hit all around the cockpit, the pilot is DEAD!  How the heck could James Franco's plane be so riddled with bullets in that last dogfight, and he only gets hit ONCE!?

That's just my two bits on the historical inaccuracies - there are a great many in this movie which have been pointed out by other reviewers already.

However, in spite of all its flaws, this was a moderately entertaining movie.  I watched it as a $2 rental, on my 23"" widescreen computer monitor, so that I could surf the Internet whenever the movie got too inane.  It's the only way to watch this movie, as far as I'm concerned.  Whenever Jar Jar..., I mean, David Ellison,... appeared onscreen, I would Google something about him or his billionaire father - these multi-tasking distractions helped to get me through those scenes, and reminded me also that money has its privileges.

I give the movie one star for James Franco's earnest performance, one star for the CGI flying sequences, and one star for trying to tell some of the history of WWI, even if the details got mangled",1177459200,10,4627,4.907455012853471
1610692,3,B00005JP86,"As a drama, this film lacks a lot.  The characters almost have depth, almost.  The romance almost has depth, almost.  The film almost has facts, almost.  There is a lot of almost in this film, which is this movie's primary problem.

The story is quite straightforward.  A group of hot-blooded young lads head for France during The Great War to fly airplanes against Germany.  One of the future pilots takes the Aquitania to Europe, which had to have been a bit of a challenge since the Aquitania was not in civilian service at the time.

Once in France, the excitement builds as the young pilots fly against Fokker Triplanes, even though those planes did not enter the war until later, and then only in small numbers.  The Fokker was notorious for being slow and occasionally falling apart because of a variety of problems.  However, the Fokker had an excellent climb rate and was maneuverable.  Baron Von Richthofen's plane was one of the few painted completely red.  I understand that the choice of red was made to help tell the good guys from the bad guys.

Skipping past all the historical inaccuracies, which this film boasts in abundance, the movie finally gets into two stories.  There is a shallow love story and the dog fights.  The love story is shallow because our two love birds have to develop this love story in between dog fights and the love story seemed to me to be a distraction to the rest of the story.

The real heart of this movie is the dog fights.  Boasting hundreds of CGI effects, this movie is a video game.  Planes roar and fly with awesome-looking bullet effects.  The zeppelin is a masterpiece, and one of the scenes on the zeppelin is a reprise of a similar scene used at least once, in the movie ""The Rocketeer.""  I do not have sufficient knowledge of the aircraft used in World War I to know whether they could turn as well as the aircraft shown in this movie, but the turns did seem too tight to me, especially for the Fokker with its wing structural issues.

So we get to see a series of scenes where the good guys and the bad guys fight each other in the skies over France.  The good guys lose pilots and shoot down the bad guys, and the good guys are on the side of right and eventually they must have to gain some kind of moral victory.

The biggest problem with this movie is lack of story.  The backgrounds of the various characters and the nominal love story are merely doorways to get these characters into dogfights.  I have seen this movie compared to ""Top Gun,"" but though that movie had its own issues, the dogfight scenes were secondary to the conflicted character that Tom Cruise played.  In this movie the dogfights are the entire reason for the movie, and everything else is secondary.

On the other hand, the dogfight scenes are a blast to watch.  If you have ever liked video games, especially flight simulator type games or war games, this movie brings those games to life.  The special effects used to show the planes are phenomenal.  The special effects provide the redeeming qualities of this movie and save it from being a two-star movie.

Other reviews of this movie are quite polarized.  However, the reason for the polarization is obvious.  If you expect even a nominal attempt at accuracy, then this movie will likely be disappointing for you to watch.  If you want to watch a movie about that is vaguely inspired by World War I dogfights and can wait for the movie to start showing them, then you will likely enjoy this movie.

But don't let this fool you, this was a good movie, fun to watch and engaging the entire way.  The movie begins by showing how the various Americans joined the war before their own country.  The movie then progresses to show their training, and troubles both in and out of the cockpit.  Finally comes the dogfights, of which there are several.  One dogfight occurs around a zeppelin, another occurs over a trench battlefield, and another occurs over fields and forests.  The dogfights themselves were very realistic, and the only miss of detail is that all the pilots landed looking just as good as when they took of, even though they sat in open air cockpits.  It seems hair gel was standard treatment for WWI pilots.

For a war movie, it has all the generic subplots; the romance between a local girl and the group's brooding conscious, the doomed hero, the silent villian, the spoiled rich kid who does good, and the over eager chap who losses his nerve, only to gain it back at the end.

I digress.)

As mentioned, I am someone whose interest in seeing a movie is largely based on the impression I get from the trailer, plus a look at the story synopsis.  I was a little disappointed that this movie did not stay at theaters long, and just figured (not surprisingly) that this kind of movie, which was once very popular, does not have the same wide audience base in a time when movies like Jackass 2 and Borat can bring in the ticketbuyers.

I took a look for myself.  The movie has some great dogfighting scenes with outstanding CGFX, which was what I rented it for.  However, it made the same mistake Pearl Harbor did (trying to have a romantic film and a war film and a buddy film all tied together).  As a result, the pacing was a little slower than I would have liked, and it probably was a factor in why the film did not do well at the box office (the war aspect may have turned off many potential female fans who might have been interested in the romantic story; though it does have a beautiful girl as the romantic interest: actress Jennifer Decker).  Another factor in its disappointing revenues may be that in a time of high-tech aerial warfare marvels (I was even an aircrew member in a couple of them), there seems to be little appreciation or interest in the saga of cloth & wood & wire aircraft, which is ironic since the level of morbid interest and excitement (higher fatality rates) would be better represented by World War 1 aircraft.  In fact, one of the things that the film did not really address was the danger and unpredictability of early airplanes, especially in combat, let alone just during landings and other ""routine"" operations.

The character development was brief but sufficient, since more of it would have only slowed the pacing further without adding much in the way of interest.

In the days before reliable combat aircraft, no parachutes, no aircraft radios, and next to no instruments, flying by ""the seat of one's pants"" was the norm.

1610791,3,B00005JP86,"How is it that Hollywood can take a naturally exciting real-life story, and ruin it?  Such it is with Flyboys.  Young American fighter pilots learning to fly and fighting for France in WWI before America joined the war - stuff of legends and a bottomless pit of real-life action adventure.  All you have to do is tell the story with some reasonable acting, fly a few dogfights and a movie practically makes itself, right?  After all, the movie is based on truth (inspired by...). But Hollywood has to push the Mission Implausible limits and add their own twists to the story that turn the average viewer with a brain into a head-shaking critic of their check on the realms of reality.  The only thing unpredictable about this movie was the extent of implausibility they sometimes went to.

  Case in point - and take note this is a spoiler for one chapter of the story but this sums up the comic-book nature they pushed with this movie:  A pilot gets shot down and crash-lands in the rugged and inhospitable small strip of no-man's land between the French and German sides who are actively shooting at each other.  The hero of the story flies down low to check out his wingman (somehow avoiding getting shot down by the German ground troops himself).  He sees the plane has flipped over and that his friend is trapped underneath.  Next thing you know, the hero has landed his own plane (somewhere?) and is running between the flying bullets to rescue his wingman.  Turns out the wingman's hand is trapped under the trailing edge of his plane's wing.  The suspended reality keeps getting deeper as the intrepid rescuer (even with the help of a heroic French soldier) can not move the fragile aircraft (the tail of which one could easily lift with one hand - trust me I know).  The hero, amid a hail of bullets, finds a trenching shovel and instead of breaking the fragile wood and fabric wing trapping his wingman's hand, he - well, you can probably guess the amazing bit of surgery he performs...  So you get the idea.

 To be fair, if that kind of reality suspension doesn't bother you in a movie that is not meant to be likened to The Matrix, then you might enjoy it.  The flight physics of the dogfights is actually depicted rather well (considering it's done by Hollywood) though it goes far beyond the performance capability of the planes at the time.  There is not much real flying going on and the use of computer generated graphics is rather evident.  I am an experienced fighter pilot and somewhat enjoyed the dogfights.  Too bad they couldn't follow history enough to use the correct planes for the timeframe of the war but that's typical for Hollywood (and allows you to keep track of the good guys and bad guys more easily).  The acting is not stellar but carries the story OK.  The required French-girl love interest is attractive and believable.

 This movie could have done quite well if only they had put a check on their typical Hollywood push to go over the edge in action and suspense, thereby losing credibility and the viewer in the process.",1174348800,8,3062,4.624074074074074
1610792,5,B00005JP86,"This is an excellent film. It captures much of the ordinary heroic reality of men's lives in the air during the first world war. The acting is excellent, but people used to the over-the-top emotionalism of most acting these days are probably not going to appreciate it. There is no self-pity and no tantrums.

They captured the historical reality of air missions during the first world war as well as anyone ever has. And the CGI, despite its limitations visually, allowed them to recreate a richer variety of aircraft in battle than previous live-action films were able to show. With some notible exceptions, many past WWI air films ended up in the air being dogfights between a small set of fighters. This is different.

The film has a strong male point of view to it which is almost never seen these days. Rather than drunk supermen with a gun in one hand and a woman in the other ready, rather than prettyboys (Top Gun), rather than crybabies, you get ordinary guys with motivations that most people can understand.

Unfortunately the lead, James Franco gives a wooden performance as the squadron leader. The supporting cast of pilots all give credible performances, but the film doesn't gain acclaimed status because of the acting.  I never felt emotionally connected to the lead characters and the romantic storyline did nothing to enhance the drama the director so desperately wanted to achieve.  The most immprobable scene involves Franco's rescue of his French girlfriend. While a dozen or so German troops invade the girl's home, she slips away and hides nearby; that is believable.  What is preposterous is when Franco flies his plane to a nearby field without any of the German soldiers seeing or hearing it.  Of course Franco and the French girl escape under a hail of German gunfire.  The characterizations of the other pilots are well crafted.  The Black pilot who at first is not readily welcomed, the rich, cultured pilot who is seeking his father's approval, the religious pilot who accepts his duty, the unemotional ace, the suspected ""spy"", and the small town hero who doubts his courage all contribute to the on screen cammaraderie.

1610794,5,B00005JP86,"Flyboys is the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, an elite group of flyers during WWI that US citizens were allowed to join before America had formally entered the war. Much like the French Foreign Legion, it was made up of men who, for the most part, were running away from something or were out for adventure. One man in particular from Texas, Blaine Rawlings - played engagingly by James Franco (James Dean, Spiderman) - is particularly laid back about the whole affair, until he finds himself in his first dogfight. Then reality sets in and he realizes why the average life expectancy for these flyers is three to six weeks.

Director Tony Bill (The Sting - producer) gives his film a traditional epic look with gorgeous cinematography, sweeping locations and authentic details, while also using CGI technology to good effect in the flying sequences. This film far surpasses The Aviator, which did little more than prepare the way for this more masterful handling of early military aviation and the dogfight sequences in particular. There are also some exciting rescue missions that have us on the edge of our seats, as well as the downing of a zeppelin that has set out to bomb Paris.

Besides the action in the air and on the ground, there is a sweet love story between Franco's character, Rawlings, and a French country girl named Laura, played winsomely by Ruth Bradley. There are also some well-developed character studies among the rest of the pilots:  a black boxer-turned-pilot, played by Abdul Salis; a Bible-reading Christian, played by Michael Jibson, who sings ""Onward Christian Soldiers"" as he goes in for a kill; a suspected spy, played by David Ellison; etc. Jean Reno does a terrific job as Captain Thenault, their instructor and commanding officer, as does Tyler Labine as head flyer Briggs, who keeps a lion as a pet.

If there were one word I would use to describe the story and relationships in this film it would be ""grace."" There are a lot of screw-ups along the way, but there always seems to be an attitude of grace among the participants. This brings the men together as a family, and gives the film a very godly quality. WWI fighter pilots had a harrowing job to do. If their planes caught fire, they had only three options:  burn to death, jump and hope for the best (there were no parachutes) or kill themselves with a pistol. So, they were heroes of the first order. Giving the story plenty of grace helps to make it human and raise it above the typical action-adventure film.

Though the film is rated PG-13 for war violence, it is handled with surprising good taste, and there is also a refreshing absence of sex and profanity, though there is a small amount of the latter. The DVD is almost absent of extra features, which is a shame. People who like reality, history, aviation and a good story will like this film. Those who want to escape reality into an artificial world of sensory overload, won't.

1610818,5,B00005JP86,"I highly recommend this film especially to those military aviation fans. It is about a story of the famed ""Lafayette Escadrille"" of the French Airforce in World War I. It was like a foreign legion of the air. It shows American volunteers who joined the glorius escadrille to fight against their German foes. The film also shows that there were both good and bad, like the German pilot of the red, crossed swords marked, red colored Fokker D-VII Triplane, a good man, who spares his American nemesis realizing his machine gun was jammed. But then there was the Black Fokker pilot,also depicting the drawing of a black falcon who was a heartless butcher.

This film shows the famed escadrille in action, the way it was, which is now only remembered on connoseur or expert circles. The film also demonstrates a pilot's courage in those days, lest we forget that the parachute had not been invented yet or was at least in the drawing boards, so if your aircraft was hit or disabled you could not bail out thus the pilots were given guns, so that they could shoot themselves rather than be incinerated alive. The acting was great and credible. This film is based on a true action story. Do not miss it.",1173830400,7,1197,4.619718309859155

1610820,4,B00005JP86,"Contrary to many critics out there, I actually enjoyed this movie.  In case you haven't heard anything about the movie, it is about some gutsy American pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille fighting for the French during WWI prior to America's entry into the war.  Some good news for all of you married guys out there...my wife can't stand war flicks (yes, I dragged her in anyway LOL), but she really enjoyed this one. There is enough romance in the movie to keep the women happy, but not so much as to make their male counterparts gag.  The dogfighting scenes are amazing.  It is the first time I've seen a movie where the digital effects and standard film are seemless.  I really couldn't tell the difference!  The extras are worth the purchase.  They explain the true story of the pilots, which were just as crazy as the characters portrayed by the actors.  These guys flew planes that broke up in hard maneuvers without parachutes, and one other thing...pet lions.  Yeah, I said pet lions.  These guys really were crazy!

The only reason that I gave this movie four stars instead of five is because of some historical faux-pas any aero dilettante would notice, and James Franco's metro-blond highlights in a early 20th century setting.  Other than that, sit down and enjoy the ride!",1173657600,2,1284,4.7342342342342345

While hopelessly historically inaccurate in way to many aspects I thoroughly enjoyed the movie because of its wonderful ability to depict what it really was like in the skies above France. The love story was well controlled (compared to pearl harbor) and the basic storyline was rather good. All in all, I've enjoyed watching this movie thoroughly, and suggest it, despite its flaws.

1610824,5,B00005JP86,This was a very enjoyable movie.  I think the reason it did not receive better reviews when it was on the big screen is because it lacks foul language and sexual content and doesn't move at the rapid pace so many of the movies do now.

1610868,5,B00005JP86,"I for one loved this movie, my family loved it. Even my 64 year old war-veteran father who is very, very picky loved it. I for one am getting sick of all the critics dumping on it. The only other places I've seen aerial action this exciting and dynamic is in the ""Star Wars"" film series, ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" and the 1995 TV series ""Space: Above and Beyond"". What makes this film special over those is that it's not in an abstract retro-futuristic fantasy world. It's a recreation of real WWI dogfights and they look so damn real. I'm an expert at spotting FX but there where many times when I really couldn't tell when they switched from real plane, to CGI model and then to scale model.

Now as for being historically inaccurate. Most of what I heard was anal-pretentious nitpicking and thus wasn't nearly as severe as some would have you believe. Most of those naysayers are just quoting some garbage some other know-it-all idiot said verbatim. Not to mention if you want precise history at such a nit-picky level as those guys insist on, go read a book. Now I wouldn't call this film a truly serious war film like ""Flags of Our Fathers"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". It's more in the vein of the war films of the 30s and the 40s, just with new state-of-the-art visual effects. Even the love story could easily been written for a 1940s film.

In many ways it reminds of the WWI episodes of ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" - In fact if you want a great companion piece to ""Flyboys"" check out the Young Indy film ""Attack of the Hawkmen"" which deals with the Lafayette escadrille as well. However keep in mind that a 2007 feature film budget can do way more then a TV movie from 1995. However they both have that old Saturday matin&eacute;e type feel.

I guess that's why so many people call it clich&eacute;. I call it a good old fashion seat-of-your-pants thrill ride and a good way to introduce any young lad to the history of that time.

Oh and the bonus disc of the DVD set is above average with it's highlight being a terrific documentary on the real Lafayette escadrille pilots and explanations on who each of the films characters where inspired by. It's where most of these self-proclaimed war historians got there information I suspect since everything i here them say about who each character is based on, is covered by the documentary.

Now one major beef is with the stupid MPAA (Trey Parker and Matt Stone are so right about them.) They rated ""Flyboys"" PG-13 for ""War Action (which is fine) and Sexual Content"" What Sexual content they're talking about I have no clue whatsoever.

The love story is sweet, innocent and old fashion and as G-rated as they come.

Now there are a couple scenes in a brothel but the women are completely clothed and nothing sexual is discussed There's not even any cleavage or garters showing. If this film was made in the golden age of Hollywood I doubt even the Hayes Commission Production Code of the 40s and 50s could have found much to object to except maybe the use of the word prostitute.

However this is 2007 and Anna Nicole's half-naked body is splashed all over ever news program and we have TV commercials that would have been considered soft-core porn 50 years ago so I don't see show that could be it. Heck I wouldn't be surprised if this is reason so many movie-goers and (mostly) critics didn't like this movie. They saw the ""Sexual Content"" and were geared up for some style steamy love scenes ;in the style the WWI semi-classic ""The Blue Max"".

Now that I think of it I don't think I ever saw a major film critic criticize a heavily sexualized love story for being clich&eacute;'. Go figure. Not that I have anything against sex. I just don't need it to be in every TV show and movie.

Lastly what I really find idiotic is the fact that most the critics who dumped on ""Flyboys"" for being clich&eacute;d and historically inaccurate gave glowing reviews to the WWII submarine turd-fest ""U-571"" with it's ridiculously well-lit, dry and roomy submarines, it's driftwood-like performance by Matthew McConaughey in the lead (While he's no Marlon Brando I'd James Franco in ""Flyboys"" over nude-bongo boy any day.)

Not to mention if you want to talk historical inaccuracies, ""U-571"" completely re-writes history having Americans, rather then the British, find the first Enigma machine and decode it.

Now ""Flyboys"" having planes a couple years too early or slightly the wrong color is no comparison for that level of deliberate  falsification. However at RottenTomatoes.com ""U-571"" gets a whopping 67% ""FRESH"" with a consensus ""Excellent cinematography and an interesting plot accompanied by a talented cast and crew make U-571 a tense thriller."" While ""Flyboys"" gets a 33% ROTTEN with a consensus ""Poorly scripted with mediocre acting and unconvincing battle scenes.""

Not to mention when it comes to historical inaccuracies don't even get me started on ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Titanic"" or Frank Miller's ""300"" (Which will be a huge hit despite the fact it bares little resemblance to the true story.)

Now finally I know why Hollywood makes so much trash. When they made a good clean old-fashion staurday afternoon action movie critics dump on it and movie-goers end up avoiding it like the plague. Darn Shame.",1173571200,2,5278,4.727965179542982

1610871,3,B00005JP86,"I purchased this dvd after finding it got a very limited release at the cinemas here in australia (one session a day at major cimemas in it's first week of release here is not what I would call a good sign) and failed to see it on the big screen.

My first thought watching it was that this is the sort of movie that you need to see on the big screen. It is something that I still plan on doing. Despite it's very limited cinema release here, I know of a few old cinema venues around town that show movies months after their initial runs have ended. I plan on visiting one to see Flyboys to see it how it should be seen, on the big screen.

That all said, the first big dogfight scene of the movie had me screaming in frustration. A few other reviewers have talked about the historical accuracy of the film being refreshing. My question to that is how do they explain then seeing a whole squadron (or the equivilent of the time) of Fokker Triplanes diving in to attack?? Knowing that only a few ever made it to the front, and the ones that did make it there, never lasted long in service due to a slight problem of wings breaking off in flight??!! Yes, I am being perdantic, and we are talking hollywood here I know. But to go to all the detail with the amazing looking CGI, I would have liked them to go with a little bit of research and realism as well.

The whole 'Black Falcon' character is just an insult to the original red baron, especially the scene of where an american flyer is gunned down on the ground (this is not a world war II movie chaps). But this, along with the typical and banal love story, is what left a bitter taste in my mouth about this film. It just follows the cliche`s so terribly with the plot and story. No insight to the characters, no developed empathy for them and what they must have gone through. Pretty pictures and awe-inspiring dogfight sequences for sure, but no substance.

I guess it was my mistake expecting something like the blue max and das boot, which this film surely isn't. Disappointing, and a shame. I'll be seeing 'letters from iwo jima' on sunday, wishing that 'flyboys' could have had the same emotional impact. Chances lost.",1173398400,4,2178,4.343980343980344
1610872,5,B00005JP86,"Impressive is the realistic romance that was portrayed for that time in history with our hero the cowboy (James Franco) and the french girl (Jennifer Decker).  This reminded me of a book i read by Vera Brittain the ""Testament of Youth"" of how innocent and cavalier this generation was at that time. Her most intimate memory of a man she loved was the warmth of his hand she felt through her gloved hand was similar to the courtship in this movie.  For the sake of being a pilot and doing flight simulation with aircraft i'll never get to fly this is a time period movie i enjoyed as much since the film ""The Blue Max"" for the romance of flying has been a real treat to see the souls that pioneered in the Great War with aircraft that are agile as a ballerina but fragile as a butterfly when handled.  This being maneovers that involve piroettes because of the slower speeds compared to jets that generally use a 5 mile turning radius. Jet fighters that are built to handle at least 10 times the weight in horizontal or vertical turns the World War I fighter could easily rip apart it's canvas fabric or wooden structure is shown in the flying sequences. The french Nieuport is very pleasing to the eye as the fine figure for a woman.  The vertical tail looks as if the french flag was hung off the end with the corners edges rounded off just as also the german Fokker's horizontal tail is shaped like a falcon's is a treasure trove to visualize in this film. I greatly appreciation that the director took to explain and portray these men and flying machines during this era how they were both utilized.

I further enjoyed replaying the movie with the full length commentary by the director and the producer turned on. I found it fascinating.  The DVD set includes the Flyboys WWI combat simulator but requires a more powerful computer than I have so I wasn't able to try that. Combat flight simulator fans with a good gaming computer should enjoy it. It had enough human interest for my wife to enjoy it and certainly enough spectacular action for me.

The dogfight and bombing scenes are spectacular and convey the perils of early fighter plane flying. The touch of romanticism is subtle and makes the picture more appealing to a wider audience who might be put off thinking it is just a war movie.

True, the terrors of war weren't driven home as in Saving Private Ryan, but this just isn't that kind of movie. Fortunately, as it was my 9-year-old son's interest in WWI planes that motivated the purchase. He was able to watch it without too many disturbing scenes (although the scene in the trenches was pretty intense).

I flew a wood and fabric biplane, a replica Bucker Jungmeister, for 15 years, and was once in a dogfight, sans guns, with a Fokker Tripe, so I feel a kinship of sorts with the pilots of that era.

1610916,4,B00005JP86,"Set against the backdrop of what is pretty much the forgotten war of the 20th century, Flyboys depicts the Americans of the Lafayette Escadrille struggling to combat not only the German foe but also a seemingly endless wave of anachronisms.  It is doubtful whether the Huns had that many Fokker triplanes in 1918, much less a year earlier.  Along the way, the viewer is also asked to accept a romantic subplot that is thrown in for -- well, why was it thrown in?  To influence female viewers?  To flesh the protagonist out?  Who can tell?

Regardless, the aerial scenes are breathtaking, and more than overcome whatever limitations there are in the plot.  In a world where fighter ""jocks"" can kill or be killed from 40 miles away, it is awesome to trace the roots and see a time when men flew in machines made of wood and canvas, and could look one another in the eye.",1173312000,,868,4.5256410256410255

Shallow characters and impossible arial combat scenes combined to make me give up on this mess about half-way through, but I watched it through to the end anyway.

Once you've seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch The Blue Max, or watch the silent classic Wings from 1927, the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.",1172793600,6,689,4.540322580645161
1610968,4,B00005JP86,"I have to say that I agree with pretty much everyone - ratings 1 through 5 stars!  All of its warts are real, but the bottom line is that if you just remember that it's NOT a documentary (although the film did make a nod to the fact that there was a WWI, and a Lafayette Escadrille, which had American volunteer pilots, and they fought the Germans!) and simply sit back and enjoy, I thought that it was a fun couple of hours.  It absolutely does have the Hollywood hokum GENEROUSLY spread throughout.

There are a couple of things specifically (and I'm not sure why these inaccuracies bothered me more than the many others!) that historically ""stuck in my craw,"" though, and they have to do with the aircraft and the computer graphics.  The Allied aircraft, supposedly Nieuport (yes, the ""i"" is correct) 17's (introduced into service in March, 1916 as the successor to the 11) had a ROTARY engine, but it's portrayed as a RADIAL.  What's the diff?  Both have the cylinders arrayed like the spokes of a wheel, but a ROTARY engine actually turns around itself, unlike a radial (of extensive WWII fame, particularly), which has stationary cylinders.  If you look at the Flyboy engines, they don't move!  I guess that the producers either didn't know the difference, or it's too difficult to make the engine turn in the computer program (??).  There's one fleeting scene showing some mechanics working on an engine in the hangar, and IT DOES ROTATE, so someone knew something.  Sorry, this little tidbit just bugged me!  By the way, the rotary was one reason why pilots usually had greasy faces after a flight - the rotary had to have its lubricating oil mixed with the fuel (it was castor oil, which doesn't mix with gasoline) - so along with the exaust, unburned oil flew back in the slipstream and over the pilot.  Likewise, some of the machines have ""V"" shaped upper planes.  Nieuports had straight wings.  At least they got it right that they were sesquiplanes (lower wing smaller than upper).  The wing differences are hard to understand in a computer generated film.  In older movies, when they used real aircraft, it's easy to see why there were differences (look at Blue Max) - there just simply aren't enough biplanes that remotely resemble WWI aircraft still flying, so ""look-(something)alikes"" had to be used.  If you're building all of the aircraft in a computer, why not make it as accurate as possible?

However, I'm forgetting that this was simply entertainment.  If you leave it at that, again, it's not that bad.  I, for one, despite its problems, do plan to pick up a copy for fun.  Enjoy!",1172620800,10,2604,4.704194260485651

The dog fight footage is brilliant! The airplane had only recently been invented when it was introduced to the war effort, so the faith and bravery it took to get into these early planes had to be incredible. Jean Reno is outstanding as the captain of the young pilots who don't have a long life expectancy. In fact, all the acting and action scenes were outstanding and the digital sequences masterfully done. I really could not tell the real planes from the digital ones and I watched the film carefully three times.

1610970,4,B00005JP86,"Flyboys has some historical inaccuracies, but so did a lot of movies that were made about WWII.  In this case, it is about WWI and it is based off of the Lafayette Escadrille, which was basically the French Air Force (then called French Air Service) during that time.  There were a number of American men who joined this service to help fight for the French but also to learn to fly and become a part of history.  The airplane had been invented not very long before, so for these men they really were being a part of history in more ways than one:  They were the first combat pilots in a war.  I wanted to talk about the Collector's edition disc first.  I see a lot of people exploding at the mouth, ears, nose and overall body cavity when railing on this film.  Many of the comments are that the flight scenes are not realistic because of CG and impossible capabilities of the airplane.  I find this funny because in the special edition it shows how they had stunt pilots do these very things and have it all recorded.  The construction of the Zeppelin was also interesting and yet debunks another myth that it was a 100% CG creation.  Last but not least they do show a history of the real Escadrille and amazingly despite all the exploding heads, I found that it seemed to be far more accurate than some people are claiming when accusing it of being false.

Overall the story is good for representing dog fights and training exercises, and although I didn't feel moved by every character's story, I still feel it had enough different things going on to make it good.  The romance was a nice touch and when Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) is hiding from the Germans in the house it was very scary, especially thinking moments like that really happened back then.  I also really liked the fact that they showed some ground battle and portrayed the trenches and the soldiers who fought in them.  Many don't realize how many fought and died right there in the trenches, because if a bullet or bayonet did not get you, the mustard gas did.  The team of men do start out somewhat as misfits and spoiled brats but then are shown to come together in their training and off base hanging out time to become a team.  It is not the greatest portrayal of WWI nor is it the most accurate, but the story I thought was very moving and it is close enough to representing some of the men that I liked it.  Eugene Skinner was one of my favorite people and Abdul Salis did a great job playing this role.  James Franco and Jean Reno also are great in their roles.  Franco is not everyone's favorite male actor but he seems much better than if they were to put Colin Farrel in there.",1172620800,5,2658,4.398773006134969
1610971,4,B00005JP86,"What Flyboys is not is a documentary.  I can see that pains a lot of people reviewing it, because they didn't have those planes that year, or they didn't fire that ammo that year, or the planes are the wrong color, or zeppelins didn't bomb in the daytime. What. Ever.  Go rent a documentary or read a history book if that's what you seek.  This movie was BASED on a true story, and did not claim to be factual in every way.

Flyboys was a story about people with nothing to lose.  For the most part, they came from various trials in life back in the States that seemed hopeless for them, and they were committed to making a meaningful contribution in the great war, regardless of the risk to their own lives.  (just like the fine men and women in our military today). They must overcome cultural, racial and national prejudices to do so.

This is the first movie I've watched in some time which cast the French in a positive light.  It reminded me that they were once a brave nation that stood to fight against those that would overrun them.  I thoroughly enjoyed Jean Reno as French Capt. Thenault of the Lafayette Escadrille.  Although the script nods to the French disdain for Americans, it's not long before we see Thenault's compassion, love and admiration for the yankee expats who have come to die for his country and cause.

This film both condemns and glamorizes war.  We see front-line battle, the death of civilians, the destruction of beautiful historical buildings, the struggle with killing, the admiration of a skilled enemy and both honor and disgrace in battle.  There are also the thrills of victory, however small, bitterness of loss and defeat, and hope for the future.

It is laced with a love story made to feel genuine by the lack of common language.  That love goes surprisingly unfulfilled at the end, as was surely the case uncountable times in the Euro wars (or any for that matter).

There are no big name actors to suck the air from the film, so it is an opportunity to enjoy some fresh faces and performances.  One of my favorites was Michael Jibson as Porter, flying into battle singing ""Onward Christian Soldiers"".  It was funny because the Germans could hear him as he was doing battle with them.  Jennifer Decker as Lucienne was WOW good-looking.  And when she was injured, she was made to look so, instead of glam wounded.  Gunnar Winbergh played the evil German ace Black Falcon, and without a word of dialog he makes us hate every molecule of his being.

Bottom line, this was a fun flick.  I watched it twice in one weekend.  If you're so into WW1 artifacts and minutia re-creationism that it means everything, I feel sorry for you that you would let it spoil your enjoyment of Flyboys.",1172620800,7,2724,4.580578512396694

This is life bigger and better than you live it. And if there is a bit of smaltz or a touch of cheese, let the critics sort it out.

What you have here is a perfect popcorn movie. The girl is pretty, the guy is heroic and the bad guy is...well, bad.

Even better the writer and director of this film let the story do its job and didn't try to make it a bio-flick or a dramedy. Sure the Fokker tripe was the most feared aircraft of World War I and the only flock of Fokkers with the blood red bodies belonged to The Red Baron and his brothers but why retell a story that has been told before.

There is a nice nod to Von Richtofen, the first celebrity warrior and in most accounts a real knight of the air. The Germans aren't Hun devils killing on sight and the real dirty work at the crossroads is left to a guy who doens't play well with others, even on his own side.

1611017,1,B00005JP86,"Looking through the past reviews of this film / DVD I am  forced to wonder what film some other reviewers were watching. I cannot imagine anybody above the age of 20 finding this film either entertaining or convincing. I find it impossible to recommend anything about ""Flyboys"", except perhaps a couple of good performances to lighten up the absolute failure of its execution.

Like the majority of people who chose to watch this film, I approached it because a) It was a war film and b) it was a film about air combat.

However, neither of these parameters was satisfied, even minimally.

Regarding its depiction of war, well you can forget it. Besides some truly strange ""history"" involving mythical German advances, none of the actual nods to WWI make any impact whatsoever. I was NEVER once convinced that the film makers had a clue about the period in which their story was set. There is no real sense of worry or despair throughout the film that accompanied the WWI pilots of real life. The Pretty boys of the Lafayette Escadrille don't share the same sense of ""not coming back"" as the RFC (Royal Flying Corps) pilots of ""Aces High"" or the Jasta pilots of ""The Blue Max"". I know the pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille were volunteers, but there is no doubt or cynicism regarding the war or a sense of nervousness or apprehension. In fact all the pilots seem somewhat happy to be there. They obviously weren't aware of the average lifespan of a WWI pilot or the fact that none of the major combatants allowed their pilots to use parachutes until the Germans introduced the practice in 1917. Being issued a pistol to shoot yourself in the head instead of being burned alive should have caused some raised eyebrows.

The aerial sequences, which should have been the star of this film, are in a word `terrible'. There are more convincing effects, physics and graphics in most computer games these days than there are in ""Flyboys"". It's really a shame that the producers didn't get some physicians on board to point out that WWI aircraft were subject to real life limitations.

...and of course, every German aircraft was a Fokker DR1 triplane....and painted red.

""Flyboys"" also includes some of the usual clichs of modern Hollywood war movies. There is the obligatory love interest and the obligatory black sacrifice, this time in the shape of Jennifer Decker and Abdul Salis.

As the unlikely love of James Franco's lead character, Decker is just irritating. Their scenes are obviously there as a clumsy filler in between the flying scenes and they are a complete waste of time.

Salis's character, presumably based on real life pilot Eugene Bullard (the only black pilot of WWI), is also extremely annoying. The idea of introducing a black pilot into the film should have been a good one (even if a little forced), but in ""Flyboys"" one gets the feeling that he is reduced to the level filling the ranks of the ""good guys"" simply as a PC device. I don't think there's anything mentioned regarding the difficulty Bullard faced in real life, or that he was barred from entry to a US squadron on racial grounds. It's very misleading and it's hard not to be cynical about it. A movie about Eugene Bullard proper would have been a great idea, but I doubt that will ever happen.

The bottom line about ""Flyboys"" comes down to this, if you want to watch a colour film about flying in WWI, then watch ""The Blue Max"", ""Aces High"" or Roger Corman's ""Von Richthofen and Brown"". Even with the errors those films incorporate, they are still far, far ahead of the fiasco that is ""Flyboys"".",1172016000,15,3579,4.712
1611018,1,B00005JP86,"I have just had an interesting time perusing the 101 previous reviews.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me there's a wide range of opinion out there.  How often do we find headlines running from one-starred ""Save your money"" to three-starred ""Good enough"" to five-starred ""Best movie of 2006 - also best kept secret""?  And all three comments in consecutive reviews on a single Amazon ""page""?

[For the enlightenment of any cynics out there, I read the reviews and the attached comments as well as the headlines.]

The main objection to ""Flyboys"" seemed to arise from the innumerable errors found on the screen.  They ranged from the airplanes that did not exist at the time of the film, to the super-abundance of Red Barons infesting the skies above France, to the breathtaking indifference to the laws of physics, to the positively giddy misapprehensions about what actually took place in the First World War (aka The Great War aka The War to End All Wars ... ahem.)  Now you may think that these historical boners, these intellectual clunkers are characteristic of video game-addled, Star Wars-bedazzled, comic book-educated lunkheads and lamebrains rather than of responsible adults given control over the millions and millions of dollars required to make a motion picture--but I say to err is human and to provide reason for selling all that overpriced popcorn is near-divine (at least for the theater owners.)

A smaller group of naysayers held forth that the plot of the movie made no sense and that the people on the screen masquerading as actors displayed no slightest hint of talent.  I heartily dispute the latter.  The always excellent Jean Reno, who portrayed the French commandant of the flyboy squadron, was right up there on the screen to show what a competent actor looks like.  For several minutes, at least.

Enough negativity.  Most reviewers clearly loved this picture.  Many of them took up such stirring war cries as, ""Never listen to the CRITICS!  This is one of the BEST!!!!"", ""Never mind the critics"" and ""The critics don't get it,""--not to mention the immortal, ""Don't listen to the `experts.'""  And the reasons they gave to turn off your mind and just drool in your seat were ... uh, and ....  Oh, yes, here's one, and by far the best of the bunch: ""I took my 4-year old to see it, and he loved it.""  Yes! Absolutely!!  Take that you hyper-critical snobs!!!

As for myself , I shall venture just one small criticism: not one minute, not one second, not one frame of the flying sequences looked convincing.  ""Flyboys"" is the most compelling argument I have ever seen against using CGI on a motion picture screen.  ""Cheesy,"" ""unreal"" and unintentionally hilarious"" don't even come close to expressing the way I feel about this visual train wreck.

Take the vaunted Zeppelin sequence: the animation in ""Wallace and Grommet"" was more convincing.  Much more.  Now look at the Zeppelin sequence in Howard Hughes' 1930 blockbuster, ""Hell's Angels.""  Both are special effects sequences.  The 21st century version just lies down and dies, leaving a bad taste in your mouth.  Its 76 year-old predecessor (in color, mind you!) pins you back in your seat.  When the Zep crashes, if I hadn't known the date of ""Hell's Angels"" I'd have  believed that Hughes had intercut some lost color film of the Hindenberg tragedy.

DVD STUFF: In my journey through the earlier reviews, I noticed that some critics looked askance at comments addressed solely to the film and not to the DVD.  With that in mind I hasten to inform everyone that ""Flyboys"" appears on one or more plastic disks, and that in some editions it is accompanied by other stuff of no discernible significance.

A FINAL WISTFUL THOUGHT: Wouldn't it be nice if somebody, somewhere, someday made a movie about the Lafayette Escadrille?",1171843200,31,3813,4.880248833592535

Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.

Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous:  aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film.  More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.

Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr. I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!)  Come on!

1611055,3,B00005JP86,"This is an awfully good looking movie put together by some very gifted veteran film makers.  Unfortunately, it seems not to have occurred to any of them to consult even a rudimentary history of World War I before embarking on this.

""Flyboys"" is supposedly set against the backdrop of that war but in fact it is not.  It takes place in an alternate universe where things are very different.

Okay, a good movie has dramatic needs.  But usually its fictions are things that ""could have happened"" within the context of a larger historical backdrop.  Consider...

(1) The actual war opened with a German drive on Paris in 1914 which stalled out at the Marne.  Both sides dug in there, and each extended their flanks until parallel trench lines ran uninterrupted for 475 miles from the Swiss border to the sea. And there they sat...

This was the notorious ""trench deadlock"" that gripped the western front from late 1914 through early 1918.  The film supposedly takes place during this period but...

(2) ""Flyboys"" forgets the trenches and strangely posits an imaginary German drive on Paris around 1916.  Airmen of the Escadrille try to thwart it by escorting bombers to attack German supply depots.  What is even more odd is that when this raid fails, they simply lose interest in the threat to Paris and turn to other missions.

(3) The only major German offensive in this period was actually at Verdun.  It was a bloody struggle that lasted months and accomplished little, but cost over a million  lives.  The Escadrille is based at Verdun in the movie so its airmen should be in the middle of this crisis.  Yet they seem blissfully unaware something is amiss.

(4) There is mention of ""sending children to England"" for safety.  A touching cinematic moment, but there was no need to flee France in World War I.  If necessary, you simply moved farther away from the front.

(5) Around mid-film the surprising announcement is made that ""the Germans have moved across the Meuse"" -- and indeed we see soldiers marching across open fields.

But again, as with the drive on Paris, how did these troops get past the Allied trenches?

A massive breech of the Allied line would be needed, with follow up forces penetrating deep into open country in the rear. Such a staggering event would have shaken France to the core.

But here it merely provides the hero an opportunity to fly to the rescue of his sweetheart and evacuate her by air to safety.  After that bit of personal drama the film once again simply loses interest in the situation.

(6) The Zeppelin daylight suicide raid on Paris seems like another fanciful concoction.  Zeppelins raided England at night but were never very effective.  Here we are given a lovely cinematic death ride that makes no sense.

(7) Toward the end of the film the Germans renew that strange drive on Paris.  This time it triggers an evacuation of the French capital, apparently to create a poignant background against which the romance between the airman and French girl plays out.

Germany was incapable of such an attempt until the collapse of Russia in 1917, which allowed transfer of a million troops from the east.  Then came the great German offensives of 1918, but none were aimed at Paris and there was no evacuation.

Bottom line:

""Flyboys"" routinely destroys any remote possibility of understanding this important event with its huge and impossible distortions for the most casual and fleeting of purposes. There is more than enough exceptional material in the history of this war to meet any dramatic requirements of film makers. They seem not to have bothered to even look at it.

It is strange to see young student reviewers call this film ""a good way to learn about WW I.""

Look, I'm no historian.  These remarks are from memory based on having read a few books on this war some years back.  That's not much, but it was enough to bedevil sincere efforts on my part to get some sort of handle on the peculiar world of ""Flyboys.""

When I was a boy, ""The Blue Max"" came out and we spent our out of class time discussing how cool it was.

'Knights of the Air' is the romantic view many of us have held since then about WW1 fighter pilots, much as the original volunteers thought as they went into service.

This film, in my opinion is the best representaion of that ideal tempered by the reality of the brutality of war.

I expected less and enjoyed it more for doing so.

The details were great ( costumes, set, details of training. )

The story was so ripe for cheesyness but was cut to perfection.

The 'heroes' were not allowed to overplay their cliches.

They were simply portraied as the types of young men we all know now as the types of young men who go to war.

Neither were the villians. ( One with honor, one without.)Only viewed as they went about their business of killing.

This, I really appreciated.

I used to work on biplanes and I really enjoyed all of the flying scenes.

I never saw a plane do what it couldn't.

And the decision to make each flying scene show that the Americans had learned more about how to survive a dogfight was a great touch, something i have never seen in a war movie before.

The plot plan to aim the final fight between the young american and the seasoned german ace-hole was very well done.

The cgi was, in my opinion, just fine. I watched the movie again with the commentary on and was surprised at many of the revelations about what was real and what wasn't.

I do disagree with everyone in Hollywood who thinks that a war movie needs a love story to be successful.

I don't care if the box office agrees with them.

It has everything, action packed scenes, Americans volunteering to go in harm's way - once again in France.  The Lafayette Escadrille was a volunteer group of American aviators, similar to the Flying Tigers in WW2 - the AVG (American Volunteer Group).  This is WWI, and it follows their adventures and combat, they are trained by the French, and fly their planes into the teeth of combat with Germany's best.  I was amazed at the accuracy of many details, like the German infantry's uniforms, and correct rifles, and the use of the lozenge camoflage on the German bombers - all correct.

The characters were solid, well developed and believable.  The sets and settings were on the money.  Unique historical details (like use of landing gear in combat) were accurate (with two big intentional exceptations).  The arial dog fights were fantastic.

Special effects were on par if not better than those in 'Pearl Harbor'.  Motion Capture of actual arial stunts made a huge difference.

The combat in this movie show what real air combat is like, especially in the World War I era, and what these amazing (now primitive) machines could do.

A lot of reviewers missed the accuracy of the aerial combat in this movie. Yes, it was ""slow"" but instead of ""Making it into an exciting Hollywood fight or combat scene"" the producers of this movie allowed what actually would take place to stand on it's own.

I am glad that there are Hollywood directors and producers who care about historical accuracy and won't sell out to make something that is already breath taking and exciting, over improvised and over done with the standard Hollywood effects and making it look good.

My only criticism of this movie is that it was long in certain parts and some of the characterization could have been shortened.

This movie gets 4 stars because of the historical accuracy and for not turning into another ""What can we do with out fancy Hollywood Special Effects?"" It also gets the stars for the excellent backstory of the heroes involved. True, it's not as exciting as other Hollywood movies, but then again most lives of heroes aren't that exciting.

Which is a shame, because all of the elements were there to make the best WWI aviation movie in history, and instead, they made this crud.  Who was the historical advisor on this one?  Paris Hilton maybe?  No, wait, she could've done better.

Where to start?  Fokker triplanes at the end of 1916?  Nope, that was later.  Five thousand Fokker triplanes, all painted brilliant red, with crosses all over them, even on the upper surfaces of the lower wings?  Nope.  A zeppelin raid in broad daylight with a triplane escort?  Nope.  Close up views of the smallish looking Neuports that show the brakes on the backs of the wheels? That's plain stupid.  Brits, Frenchies, and Americans all operating off the same airfield and sharing airplanes no less?  Nope.  Enough time between missions for pilots to apparently take week long vacations through the countryside?  Nope and stupid.  A German aerodrome occupied apparently only by one pilot and one little guy to salute him?  Wierd and dopey.  One lion, not two?  What happened to ""Soda""?

That's the short list, there's much, much more.  This movie's about as historically accurate as Pearl Harbor was a few years back, where Ben Afflack single-handedly won WWII.  They even have a wonderful CG'd version of the Aquitania bringing the Americans over to France, but dash it all, the Aquitania was serving as a hospital/troop ship at that time.

Add to all this a very poor and pointless love story with an illiterate French woman.  What was the point of that?  Again, all the ingredients were here to make an outstanding movie, and these guys made something so mind-numbingly poor that any military history buff is going to be disgusted with the missed opportunity.  It's got some great visual effects, but so did Independence Day, and in the end, Independence Day was more believable than Flyboys.

This movie is just painfully stupid.  Will there never be a movie capable of matching THE BLUE MAX as the best WWI flying movie ever made?

It is the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, among the very first fighter pilots, as they take on the Germans.  There is lots of action, great cinematography, a good plot, and a love story as well.

I am also often disappointed when ""historic"" movies totally fumble historic facts.  But I've given up on trying to get 100% accurate history from dramatic movies.  I've got plenty of books that can give me that.  I read some of the reviews here of those who know WWI better than me.  I ABSOLUTELY respect them, but I can't help but feel that if these movies were made with the accuracy they demanded, a lot of the audience would be lost.  I think the people who made this film care about history, but they can't afford to lose money.  ""Gods and Generals,"" a huge box office flop, was a good example of real accuracy losing its audience.

Three things I really appreciated about ""Flyboys:""

The role of Eugene Skinner, based on the real Euguene Jacques Bullard (who was from my father's hometown of Columbus, GA).  Bullard was not technically in the Lafayette Escadrille, but it is so important to have him in the movie to communicate his story.  Like the producers said, a lot of people will think he was a ""PC"" Hollywood creation.  I hope the day comes soon when people will stop assuming these things.

The role of Lyle Porter, or the cliche ""religious one.""  I don't know if he was based on one of the real pilots, but I'm glad they treated his Christianity with dignity and respect.

And I really liked the scene where the pilots trained.  When I watch it, I feel like I'm watching the birth of United States aviation as it happened back then.  I feel like I'm watching history even if the participants don't realize the impact of what they were doing.  Some of the bravest military men are the ones who sign up to go into battle with new, untried weapons.

TOP GUN rip off with extended volleyball scenes? What? American men vacationing in France? For the record. I didn't see one volleyball in the film. In fact, I didn't see one guy without his shirt or a shower scene. Don't listen to bogus reviews. Please, don't listen to these comments, because you will be missing a marvelous, sharp, beautiful and BASED ON A TRUE STORY World War I picture that blew me away.

The extent that the filmmakers went to make this a realistic, poigniant and time capturing homage to the FLYBOYS of World War I who went over to France BEFORE America joined the war, is stunning. After watching this film, I couldn't believe that this film hasn't received more accolades.

It's a little one dimensional, but that was the way life was for the pilots of World War I who were volunteering to fly war planes only years after the plane was even invented. They arrived in France, they trained for three weeks and they were flying missions that had claimed thousands of lives and had a less than 5% return rate.

In between missions, their lives were dull and simple. Parked in the middle of a French country side, they would frequent a single pub and drink to the men who didn't return that day.

FLYBOYS is based on real stories from journals of the real men the movie portrays. The lives they left behind to become pilot gods. The loves they lost and left behind. The people they met and the amazing world changing missions they embarked on.

James Franco plays Blaine Rawlings, a young man who was about to lose his ranch and be arrested, motivating him to enter World War I as a fighter pilot before the American government joined the fight. He meets a beautiful french women named Lucienne (newcomer Jennifer Decker) who speaks little english, but their bond is realistic and beauiful portrayed.

The most breathtaking part of FLYBOYS is the battle scenes themselves. The planes circle and dart between the clouds, streaming their clouds of bullets across the sky. The rudementry targeting system and the flaws in their guns. Everything is captured.

Bottom line. FLYBOYS is breath-taking. A wonderful film and exactly the kind of movie that Howard Hughes wanted to make. Today's technology allows it to happen in glorious fashion.",1170547200,10,2393,4.724220623501199

The bond between the men as they battle together works well. The romance though is the key here for me. We have two people that speak different languages and they fall in love.

Yes, it has its flaws in technical lines, but it has a strong, committed cast and a storyline that flows seamlessly to the end.

Tony Bill uses his resources from his countless cinematic experiences in adapting a story by Blake T. Evans (screenplay by Phil Sears, David S. Ward, and Evans) to recreate the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, a disparate group of young Americans who volunteered for the French military to become the country's first fighter pilots before the USA entered World War I.  He manages to find the world atmosphere during the Great War, a time when young American boys who had no chance for significance in the tough times USA to go 'over there' to fight the Germans.  He begins with the lad Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) who has just lost his family's farm to the bank, with William Jensen (Philip Winchester) who must live up to his family's fame as heroes, with Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) whose father sees him as a complete loss to his wealthy gentrified family, with Eddie Beagle (David Ellison) who leaves for war with his sweetheart's picture against his breast, with frustrated black fighter Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis) - a crew of boys who become bonded through the efforts of the French Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and the loner flyer Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson).

Planes are designed, the boys are rigorously trained, and off they go to missions never before flown, missions that waste some, and make heroes of others.  Along the way Rawlings meets Lucienne (Jennifer Decker), a French girl who speaks no English but whose heart emboldens Rawlings to feats of heroism.

The fighting scenes are terrific to watch as they seem to be done with toys, so light are the aircraft that started flying fighters.  Yes, there are problems in depicting these missions because there are no stunt men who would dare fly such machines even for a movie.  But Tony Bill keeps our attnetion with his direction and with the aerial cinematography of Henry Braham.  The costumes are excellent and the musical score by Trevor Rabin recalls the period well. James Franco and his fellow actors offer solid performances.

To make matters worse, the special effects showed curly smoke trails following each bullet as they were fired.  The bullet impacts in the fabric covering of the airplanes didn't make round holes with the edges curved inwards, but rather made triangular and squarish shaped holes that blew through from the inside out.

Some of the heroes die and as mentioned in the movie WWI flyers had a horrible life expectancy. Part of the reason was the fact that the planes were flimsy and parachutes by and large were not used. To those who complained that real airplanes were not used, you only have to follow aviation and note the number of ""warbirds"" flown by enthusiasts that have crashed with quite a few fatalities - even when flown by experts -- and these are much safer World War II and post-war planes.

1611198,2,B00005JP86,"""Flyboys"" is amazing. It manages to be a dull movie about a fascinating subject, the Lafayette Escadrille, a dull love story, and a dull movie about Great War dog fighting, which this reviewer did not believe possible.

Although the film is trying and makes an effort at historical detail and dramatic content it falls flat. The viewer doesn't get chance to know any of the characters ably played by some new faces as well as the venerable Jean Reno. (Reno must have a bell that rings in his agent's office every time an American script calls for a French character.) But no amount of acting can pull this lack luster script from the trenches of tedium.

The missing piece in ""Flyboys,"" other than the absence of Von Richthofen, is the near complete lack of any actual aerial photography. ""Top Gun"" is a mediocre film at best but has phenomenal aerial photography which is exciting and engaging. In ""Flyboys"" we have only CGI which is sterile. The performers don't have close ups of their faces against sub-zero wind (for which they are woefully underdressed) which detracts from the danger and excitement of a film about Great War pilots. It is obvious they are against a green screen in Vancouver. If ""Flyboys"" had gone the extra mile and had at least one dog fight done for ""real"" it would have saved the film. Granted, there aren't may flying bi and tri planes in the world but if massive trebuchets can be built for ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and Fort William Henry can be rebuilt for ""Last of the Mohicans,"" and fiberglass tanks can be built for ""A Bridge Too Far,"" and a working Tiger can be found for ""Saving Pvt. Ryan,"" then  I'm sure the producers of this film could have found a way to bring some excitement to ""Flyboys.""

The historical purists will cry foul at the historical inaccuracies, but for the most part, those inaccuracies were intentional---in order to make the film a little more accessible for viewers who haven't spent years studying WWI aviation.  I spotted several ""ooh, that's not right!"" moments, but in the end, they didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film.

The CGI dogfights are well-done, in my opinion.  Would it have been better if they had used real planes?  You bet!  Would using real planes have been a realistic objective?  NO!  Those old planes were dangerous as heck when they were brand new, and even modern reproduction methods haven't done much to reduce the risk.  Put 40 or 50 planes in the air at once and try to choreograph a dogfight---someone's gonna die. And not all of those original pilots died in combat. There were shockingly high numbers of men killed due to engine failure and other mechanical failures.  If you use CGI, you can eliminate most of the risk, plus you can get more realistic with crates catching fire, breaking up in mid-air,crashing, etc.

The surprisingly great acting from a cast largely comprised of unknowns? The amazing flying sequences and special effects?
Really, the movie ""Flyboys"" is a monumental achievement and an effort of which everyone involved in it can take pride.
Prior to the United States entry into World War I a number of American men traveled to Europe lured by a fascination with the relatively new ability to fly (many people had never seen an airplane at this time). They joined a squadron known as the Lafayette Escadrille (named after the French general who aided America during the Revolutionary War).
Airflight was incredibly dangerous at this time and even more so when flying into a combat zone. Aerial dog-fighting was also a close quarters affair with mere feet between opposing pilots. Indeed the life expectancy for WWI pilots was also extremely short. As one character comments of another's hard edged nature ""Bet he doesn't make friends easily."" The always excellent Jean Reno interjects with ""All of his friends are dead!""
So into this backdrop comes ""Flyboys"" which follows the stories of a group of mismatched new arrivals to the squadron.  We have, among others, a Texas rancher faced with the repossession of his land, a young aristocrat seeking the approval of his father, an African American prize fighter eager to repay the kindness shown to him by the French and a young man seeking to follow in his families military heritage.
Together they forge a friendship and from stumbling beginnings an effective fighting force.
It's an engaging drama and one that I have already ewatched three times. It is nicely complemented on this DVD release by an impressive number of special features the prize of which, for me at least, is the documentary on the inspirations for the characters and historical research and a second one on the real-life Lafayette Escadrille. There is of course a very engaging commentary track which also highlights the great amount of detail that went into the making of the movie.
When it was released the movie was criticized by some rather ignorant reviewers who railed against some of the details in the movie. They complained for example about the gunman atop a zeppelin shooting at the fighters buzzing around him. This, however, as the producer Dean Devlin explains, was based on historical fact when Devlin came across a picture of one such gunman in a history book of WWI.
Yes, ""Flyboys"" is an impressive achievement and well worth your time and money.",1170201600,15,2651,5.011337868480726
1611242,1,B00005JP86,"I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals. She told me it is based on the box office record of the film. She had 2 Flyboys. One would have been plenty.

The story was sappy. The acting just so so. The aerial sequences were much like a video game. Try ""Flight Simulator"". WWI biplanes hanging on their props??? Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered ""no man's land"" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??

There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights. I was hoping for something on the order of ""The Blue Max"". ""Flyboys"" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!",1170201600,7,914,4.370588235294117
1611243,5,B00005JP86,"James Franco stars in this exciting movie based on the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a group of American pilots flying for the French in the early days of World war I.

Franco portrays Blaine Rawlings, a young rancher from Texas who's family ranch has just been repossessed.  While watching a movie at the local moviehouse, he sees a newsreel about pilots fighting in Europe.  He decides to enlist with the French Lafayette Escadrille and battle the Germans.  Soon, Rawlings and fellow pilots William Jensen (Philip Winchester), Lyle Porter (Michael Jibson), Eddie Beagle (David Ellison), Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), and Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) are on their way to France.  All have come from different backgrounds and circumstances, but they all share one common goal; to fight and defeat the Germans.

Upon arriving in France, they are met by Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno).  It's Thenault's job to train the American pilots proper tactics in order to battle the Germans.  There are already some American pilots in France.  One is Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson).  He has become one of the best pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille, already having shot down over twenty German aircraft.  The lead pilot for the Germans is the menacing Black Falcon (Gunnar Winbergh) and his group of skilled pilots.  All of the Germans fly the famed Fokker triplane, painted blood-red.  All except the Falcon's, who's is jet black.

After completing their training, the Americans are finally ready to take to the skies and do battle with the Germans.  During the course of the movie, there are several thrilling aerial combat sequences between the Americans and Germans, especially the sequence where the Germans send a zeppelin to bomb Paris.  Relationships develop among the pilots as well.  Rawlings becomes the de facto leader of the group, and many of the other pilots look to him for support and advice.  Rawlings has also developed a relationship with a local French girl named Lucienne (Jennifer Decker).  She bandaged Rawlings' leg after a flying accident, and he became attracted to her.  However, she can't speak English and he can't speak French.  But the language barrier can't hide the feelings between the two.

The missions become more and more dangerous for the Americans, and soon, some of the pilots are lost in combat.  But the Americans keep going up to fight it out with the Germans despite their lack of experience.  Their will to fight and courage is unquestioned as these heroic men continue to do battle with the enemy.

This is an outstanding movie.  The story of the famed Lafayette Escadrille is told with complete historical accuracy.  The acting, especially by James Franco and Jean Reno, is excellent.  The plot is well-conceived, and the amazing aerial combat sequences are the highlight of the film.  The romance between Rawlings and Lucienne his handled wonderfully.  It does not become so out of control as to take over the movie.  Rather, it is allowed to grow at a slower pace that holds the viewer's interest.

I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  History fans will enjoy it for its great combat sequences and attention to detail.  Laypersons will enjoy the romance between Rawlings and Lucienne.  Watch ""Flyboys"" and see how a group of inexperienced American pilots became one of the most feared squadrons of World War I.",1170201600,6,3371,5.0234657039711195
1611244,5,B00005JP86,"Let me say this...I will never...and I mean NEVER listen to the critics again...EVER!!!!!!!! I remember when FLYBOYS was about to be released into the theater and I was very excited, but then I read the reviews and my excitement waned and I never saw it. Then I saw the DVD was coming out and so I read the REAL reviews, the ones from the actual fans.

And they were mostly positive!

So I watched FLYBOYS and I was so moved and excited while watching this movie!!! WOW! I cannot express how great this movie was. It was not predictable. The dog fights were great and if you are afraid this is just going to be PEARL HARBOR you are wrong. By the way, I did like Pearl Harbor. It just took time getting used to, but not with FLYBOYS!!!

The music, the story, the excitement, the scenery. This is a beautiful movie and I am so upset I never got to see this on the big screen. Please do not make the mistake I did and listen to the critics. I don't know what movie they saw, but I am telling you, this is a great epic war movie and one that I am very proud to own!",1170201600,5,1061,4.0669856459330145
1611245,5,B00005JP86,"Let's say it clear. This is not only a remarkable gaze around those epic times where to fly a plane was a true invitation to a secure death; far beyond the different approaches or motivations of a crowd of people who decided to enlist in this air-force; extraordinary well supported by visual effects, that tell us about the courage, bravery and epic spirit of a bunch of men without name but with enormous wishes of winning an absurd war.

Although the dramatic construction has told so many times before, there are moments of undeniable tenderness when the love appears by mere casualty. The racial prejudices, the coveted revenge of a spiritually man wounded for having lost his old partners, the spiritual growing up of another one and the heroic disinterestedness of a Texan boy who have nothing to lose in this conflict because he has no family, a loser from of his own country who finds a motive to demonstrate himself and his country he is much more a simple inheritor of a farm, vanished by legal reasons.

But the highlight of this movie are undeniably, the spectacular aerial sequences, plenty of adrenaline and mercurial vitality. The camerawork is overwhelming and so the two climax final sequences that obviously will run for you once you rent or acquire it.",1169769600,13,1272,4.80365296803653
1611246,4,B00005JP86,"Eugene Bullard, the black flying ace, was not the first black air mail carrier.  He was the grandson of a slave and left his native Columbus, Georgia when he was only eight years old.  He made his way to France and made his way doing odd jobs.  Gene eventually became a boxer and was one France's finest before joining the Lafayette Escradrille.  He had a storied success with the French Foreign Legion before becomming a pilot.  Gene was decorated heavily for his bravery with the Legion and during and after WWI.  He later married and had three children ( one son did not survive ).  Gene was heavily involved with the French Resistance during the WWII and received many accolades from his adopted country.  When he and his two daughters returned to the U.S., he found work as a elevator operator ( not a airmail carrier ).  The U.S. refused to even allow him to fly with them during WWI.  When Gen. DeGaulle made a state visit to New York in the 1950s, Gene went to his hotel.  DeGaulle personally came downstairs to pay a visit to his old friend.  Over fifteen medals and certificates were given to this man ( from France ). I really hope that Hollywood will stay true to the ""real"" story in the future.",1169596800,15,1207,4.461187214611872
1611247,3,B00005JP86,"Flyboys is a decent adventure film, but with apologies to reviewer Monty Rainey, it can hardly be praised for its historical accuracy.  The computer-generated planes zip around more like jet fighters than WW1 planes, making snap-rolls & vertical climbs rather than Immelman turns & the slower, more gradual maneuvers the real planes were capable of. The Nieuports the Escadrille fly were obsolete & replaced by Spads by late 1916/early 1917 (when the movie takes place--they mention the USA entering the war which was April, 1917), and the Fokker Triplane didn't enter service until the winter of 1917 & never in great numbers (very few were red by the way). These quibbles aside, what really destroys the believabilty of the movie is when one of the Flyboys gets shot down & crashes in no-man's land (at a point where the German & French lines seem to be about 50 yards apart when a half mile is about the closest they ever actually got).  Though he's in the cockpit when it crashes, the pilot somehow gets his hand trapped between the ground & the upper wing (which miraculously didn't collapse when the plane flipped upside down). And he can't get it out! His friend has to land (apparently also in no-man's land), run THRU no-man's land perpendicular to all the Germans shooting at him, & help his friend get his hand out. (I won't spoil it by saying how.) WW1 fighters weighed roughly 1000 lbs, with the engine & guns comprising over half the total weight.  The top wing his hand was trapped under would have weighed about 100 lbs total.  If your hand was trapped under one side, you'd simply lift it off with your free hand.  Also the trailing edge of the Nieuport was made up of a pine-wood stringer which was one inch square. He could have cut your way thru it with a penknife.  OR, since his hand was trapped between the wing & the GROUND, he could have simply dug the earth away underneath it.

  Other blatant inaccuracies: the Germans invade with tanks of British design a year before the tank was invented; they've made a massive breakthrough within a few miles of the airfield & the pilots (& the hero's French girlfriend living in the war zone) are completely unaware of it; the hero takes off at night, lands (where? in a field, in the dark?) by his girl friend's house, & none of the thousands of German soldiers in the area hear the plane. . .

For all that, it's not a bad action movie, but as far as being realistic?  They should have just made the movie about the real Escadrille pilots. Raoul Lufbery's true exploits would have been much more exciting. (To anyone interested in the true story of the Escadrille, I heartily recommend Jeff Shaara's novel about WW1, TO THE LAST MAN. And for a movie that gets to the heart of what flying in WW1 was really like, try THE DAWN PATROL with Errol Flynn (coming out in March on dvd).",1168646400,160,2847,4.5627450980392155

1611249,4,B00005JP86,"Flyboys didn't last long in theaters upon its release, but don't let that scare you away, it's an above average WWI period drama.  During World War I, a group of American pilots joined the fighting in Europe before the United States entered the war in 1918.  Flying for the French, they were named the Lafayette Escadrille.  The movie follows five or six freshly arrived pilots, most notably James Franco as Texan Blaine Rawlings, as they train and learn how to fly and ultimately join the war as they take on German fighters, most notably the Black Falcon, a German pilot who doesn't follow the ""rules of war.""  All in all, this was a pretty good movie.  It's by no means a great movie, but it kept me entertained for the full 140 minute running time.  The added love story isn't as bad as I thought it'd be, but the movie didn't need that storyline.  It would have been better if the storyline focused primarily on the pilots and the dogfights, which are the high points of the movie.  Go see this movie for the dogfights, especially the zeppelin attack on Paris and the final showdown between Rawlings and the Black Falcon!

  One of the complaints of the movie was that it is too cliched, and this is partly true, but for me it felt like the actors did the best they could with what they have.  James Franco gets top billing as Texan Blaine Rawlings, a young rancher who joins the war after his ranch went under.  Along with flying with the Escadrille, he falls in love with a French girl, Lucien (French beauty Jennifer Decker), who can't speak English.  My favorite character is Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson), the veteran pilot who slowly opens up to the new pilots.  The rest of the young pilots who arrive with Rawlings include Phillip Winchester as William Jensen, the golden boy who knows he'll become a hero, Tyler Labine as Briggs Lowry, a young man from a rich family who is trying to prove himself to his father, Abdul Salis as Eugene Skinner, the lone African-American pilot in the group who must prove himself while also dealing with some racism, and David Ellison as Eddie Beagle, the struggling pilot who may or may not have a suspicious background.  Jean Reno is excellent in a small part as the captain of the squadron, Capt. Thenault, but it's too bad he couldn't have been used more.

  The soon to be released two-disc DVD, Jan. 30, 2007, will offer a boatload of special features which I'm definitely looking forward to watching.  There will be several making of featurettes, some history about the real Lafayette Escadrille, an audio commentary with director Tony Bill and producer Dean Devlin, deleted scenes, trailers, and a Flyboys Squadron DVD-rom game.  So for a movie with some excellent dogfights and aerial sequences, a pretty good ensemble cast, and a not so bad love story, look for the two-disc DVD of Flyboys in January!",1167091200,61,2859,4.666666666666667

Fly Boys sticks more closely to the air combat theme, while still allowing for a human side to the story, and those combat scenes! They are great.

Not wishing to give the story line away to anyone lucky enough to still be looking forward to seeing this film for the first time, I won't go into any details, but you will not be disappointed.

In particular, the always good Jean Reno as Captain Thenault, Jennifer Decker as Lucienne, and James Franco as Blaine Rawlings were outstanding. My feeling is that this is Jean Reno's best fit in a role since Ronin. And he has been plenty good in several films since then.",1166400000,9,767,4.394366197183099
1611283,3,B00005JP86,"Not a horribly bad movie. It did have real good aspects but i felt it needed a little more.

The good things:

-The love story. Not too common, the language barrier was an interesting aspect and no happy ending like most.

-Realistic. Its not like those movies where everyone survives. Theres realistic deaths and only a couple of the characters make it to the end.

-Variety. The different nationalities of the characters is good. Of course, it is World War I, so it was expected, but interesting nonetheless.

The bad things:

-Nothing very concrete. I'm still undecided about this being good or bad. You get only a tiny bit of information on the characters. Theres really no indication of their strengths and weaknesses. Probably because there are so many characters that they don't focus on but one or two.

-Repeated plot. Its not a thorough war movie that concentrates on one incidence or place. Its just about them going up in the air several times, taking them down and coming back.

-No climax. Its not really a movie in which it builds up to anything. The plot is just continuous, so theres really no high point.

Overall, its an ok movie. Its good for someone that doesnt like concentration on main characters and a war plot that doesnt narrow in on one incident.",1166054400,10,1274,4.677130044843049

First off, the special effects, out of this world, it really does put you in the cockpit and you really feel what these pilots must have felt, that is it real, not some Top Gun kind of feeling like it's some video game but the real deal. Also, the storyline with James Franco and that French woman was done VERY well, I figured going in that that part would be a really sappy and corny, just a way to fill the in between plane fighting scenes but I really enjoyed those scenes, they were funny and very emotional. The interaction between the pilots and their own storylines was also very well written and exectued.

If you were to dive as steeply as they did in that film for as long as they did in a Nieuport 17 you would rip the lower wing clean off.  Probably the same with the Fokkers.  If you want more realistic combat scenes I would recomend The Blue Max but this movie will still keep you on the edge of your seat.  One think I didn't like was the fact that they made the Germans look really bad.  I've read many accounts of German pilots who really went out of their way to be humane and a many stories of allied pilots who were downright cruel (Mannock).  WWI was a war where niether side was better than the other, and it was a war that shouldn't have happened.  Entangling alliances are an itch.",1165622400,4,831,4.118012422360248
1611287,4,B00005JP86,"The movie captured the excitement one would expect in such a film, but I found the historical innacuracies concerning the pilots to be annoying.  When America entered the war, they dissovled and absorbed this squadron.  The black pilot was not allowed to fly because he was black.  England was his adopted country and after the war he retired to Harlem where he died in poverty and relative obscurity.  It is a tragic story.  Also, if the ""hero"" really loved that girl, wouldn't he try to find her after the war?  If you're going to make up a love story because you think it is required in a war movie, then at least give it a satisfying ending.  Finally, in the beginning, when they are going to destroy the munitions factory, they are not escorting any bombers.  How were they going to destroy it?  In the end, when they went back, they were escorting bombers.

I am not as schooled in planes as some other reviewers, but I do not think that bombers could automatically drop bombs at this point in the war.  I believe they were still throwing them over the side of the plane.  I could be wrong, but I found the technology featured in the movie to be a little advanced for the time period.

Still, the dogfights and all aerial scenes were beautifully filmed and very exciting.  I was enthralled in the story.

If you do some research, you can tell which movie pilot was meant to represent which real pilot.  There was a real pilot who memorized the eye chart so he would pass the test and be able to fly, and he was also partially deaf.  The pilot in the movie who loses his hand represents him.  The leader, who was a French-born American and who spoke with a French accent was represented by the brooding, dark-haired leader of the movie.  The real stories of these men are actually more interesting than the movie version, but they fictionalized the stories of the pilots so they could combine some personalities and so they could give all of them that lived until the end of the movie a happy ending.  Are Americans really that shallow that they would rather have a happy ending than know the truth?  I don't think so.  I think the movie would have been better had they told the real story of these pilots.

My criticisms are why I only gave it four stars.  I did enjoy it and the theater was full of old people like me so there was not one cell phone open or going off any time during the movie and no children running up and down the aisles.  That was a nice change.",1164153600,4,2473,4.382417582417583
1611288,3,B00005JP86,"Flyboys is a film about American volunteer aviators during the first World War before America declared war on Germany in April 1917.  The movie is action packed and exciting as far as the special effects.  Hollywood is long over do for a Good WWI aviation film and this is an area where I would like to see more movies about considering WWI Aviation is my hobby.

Hollywood does a descent job with historical accuracy however I did find some errors in it.  But if you are looking for a good film to watch for excitement and adventure then this is a good pick.  If you don't care about historical accuracies, stopreading now. :-)

Some of the historical inaccuracies I found were: 1) The French Neuport 17 biplanes had rotory engines, not radial engines.  Rotory engines were round like radials but spun on the camshaft with the propeller. I believe the Neuports used a 80 horse power Le Rhone engine.  The rotory engines in early and mid WWI had two speeds, on and off.  2) The German Fokker DR1 triplanes did not enter the war until August of 1917 when the Flyboys would have been flying SPAD VII.  The movie should have depicted either Halberstadt DII or Albatros DII and DIII.  Fokker Eindeckers (monoplanes) were near the end of thier life span in mid to late 1916 when this story is depicted.  3) Maneuvers pulled by the fragile Neuports depicted in the film would have ripped the upper wings off which was a weakness of the Neuport series, especially pulling out of deep dives.  4) Not every German Fokker DR1 was all red.  Manfred von Richtofen, the Red Baron flew an all red fokker DR1 and was killed in one but even the Red Baron fly non-all red triplanes from time to time.  Although squadrons usually keep to the squadrons markings some German pilots of certain rank and/or number of kills could mark their planes with their own personal markings.  5) The straight (latin) cross on the German Fokkers did not come to being until March 1918, long after the dis-banning of the Lafayette Escadrille.  6) Where is there mention of Raoul Lufbery and William Thaw two of America's first aces and early members of the Escadrille?  7) From my research I have not found where the Lafayette Escadrille brought down a German Zepplin....I'll keep researching.

But again as a film to watch for action, Flyboys meets the bill.  And as mentioned in other reviews Hollywood did get some things right histoical.",1163203200,5,2406,4.669833729216152
1611330,5,B00005JP86,"Like many have said before, this was a film I waited months to see as well. That kind of anticipation can swing both ways, setting one up for either a great film viewing experience of a real let-down. Flyboys kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. If you are concerned with the technical details of aircraft, insignia and flying techniques, then just relax, please! This is a entertainment, not a didactic examination of aerial combat. There was one comment about ""physics"" and aviation here. One must remember that Bill needs to appeal to the audience of 2006, most of whom who have seen airships move through space and time in the blink of an eye cinematically, and who have traveled on commercial aircraft, if not experienced ski-jets, ninja bikes and ultra-fast rollercoater rides. So, how do you make aircraft that travel along at barely over 100 mph look exciting on the screeen. Perhaps a little poetic license is to be permitted, no? If the acting was less then stellar, I didn't seem to notice. I cared about the characters. I wanted them to succeed and survive. Sure, there were cliches in abundance, but I didn't mind. There are cliches in just about every action film I've seen in the last decade.

And the love story was touching and kept the film from being a stringing together of combat sequences (which, incidently, were stunning).

I came to this picture with a bit of a bias as I love reading and learning about combat aircraft of the two world wars. Flyboys was exactly the type of film I was looking forward to seeing. It embraces a time when air combat was still almost hand to hand, and could be face to face.

There is a certain existentialism about the short lives these men led and yet they wouldn't have made their choices differently.

I am grateful to the producers and all involved in making a film that is the noble aspects of human beings, as opposed to making entertainment about people doing ""dumb"" things or mountains of ironic statements.",1161475200,9,1982,4.638176638176638

1611334,5,B00005JP86,"I am a huge fan of war movies, particularly air war movies, but unfortunately Hollywood releases few movies in this genre.  When they do release a war movie it is usually poorly rendered, such as ""Pearl Harbor.""  They do not seem to understand that war is a human endeavor, probably the most serious endeavor in which humans are involved.  They also do not understand that movies are about story telling and war stories need to be told.  Adding to the difficulty is the expense of filming a war saga (all those tanks and planes and ships are expensive to render on the big screen).  Computer generated images (CGI) should have done a lot to mitigate the cost of producing war movies but such releases are still few and far between.

When a new war film is released it often does not rise to meet expectations.  I waited months for ""Pearl Harbor"" to be released and was sorely disappointed when it was.  It should have been spectacular but only perhaps fifteen minutes of it were worth the money.  There was an excellent Battle of Britain sequence at the beginning, a few first rate shots of the Pearl Harbor attack in the middle and some really good flight scenes of the Doolittle Raid.  The story was horrible, the acting was miserable and I was left thinking that someone should have made a movie about the Battle of Britain, the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid.

There are many war subjects which scream for attention but Hollywood seems to have a problem making movies which illustrate heroism, valor and self-sacrifice.  One particular subject which has never been portrayed on the big screen is the story of the pilots of Torpedo Squadron 8 who flew into the Battle of Midway during World War II.  Flying from Midway Island and the U.S.S. Hornet, a few Americans fought a fight to the finish against overwhelming odds when everything hung in the balance. If there is an American ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" this was it.  Attacking a fleet of four Japanese aircraft carriers, these pilots were all shot down without ever hitting a Japanese ship.  Their sacrifice, however, allowed the American dive-bombers to reach their targets and sink most of the Japanese fleet in what was the greatest U.S. Naval victory of all time.  Yet, Hollywood has never seen fit to depict this story on the big screen (however, the attack by Luke Skywalker on the first Deathstar could have been based on the story of Torpedo 8).

With all this in mind, I looked forward to seeing ""Flyboys"" with not a little trepidation.  The lead up to the movie was not encouraging.  There was little advertising and I had to go online to see the trailer.  It was as if Hollywood was saying: ""Oh yeah, and we have this war film, too.""

When ""Flyboys"" was finally released, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a fictionalized account of the Lafayette Escadrille, a squadron of American pilots who fought for the French before the U.S. entered World War I.  I think that the real story would have been just as good (someone should do a movie on Raoul Lufbery or Frank Luke) but the movie is close enough to the truth that even an amateur historian can enjoy it.  Historical fiction, when done well, such as in the books of Michael or Jeff Shaara, can accurately depict real events and the makers of ""Flyboys"" succeeded in doing so.

The flight scenes were spectacular and excellently rendered.  The planes were accurate depictions of the aircraft used during the period, the characters were representative of those who actually flew in the Escadrille and the actors performed in a manner which did justice to the unit.  Particularly exciting were the attacks by the Escadrille on the German bombers.  There were some historical inaccuracies but those were not glaring.  Most of the tactics used by the pilots in the movie were believable and I could think of an example of each from the reading I have done on the pilots of that era .  Some did stretch the rules of physics somewhat but did not detract from the movie (I don't think bi-planes could fly upside down for long as the fuel systems relied on gravity but I am no expert).

Not wanting to spoil movie surprises, I will attempt to explain a few things that will only make sense within the context of the movie.  The fear of fire was such that some pilots did carry pistols with which to end their lives rather than burn to death as parachutes were not yet commonly used.  Attacks on balloons and on Zeppelins were particularly dangerous.  Early in the war, when airplanes were used merely for reconnaissance, pilots carried firearms with which to shoot at enemy pilots and some actually did.  Chivalry between pilots during the war did exist up to a point. Pilots did crash land in no-man's land and were forced to run for their lives. Some pilots did machine-gun enemy pilots who had crashed landed (though this was not common). The mascot of the Lafayette Escadrille was the same kind as that shown in the movie. Finally, if a man was born a slave in, say, 1855, and he had a son in, say, 1899 at the age of 44, that son could have flown for the Lafayette Escadrille at the age of 18.

The movie depicted a romance of sorts between the main character and a French woman but it was of the type common during the war.  It added to the movie rather than detracted from it (the ""Pearl Harbor"" romance, destroyed that film, leaving the movie with no sympathetic characters).  I am no real judge of ""chick flicks"" but my wife and daughters saw ""Flyboys"" and all want to see it again.

The soundtrack from ""Flyboys,"" written by Trevor Rabin, really added to whole movie experience.  I am a true John Williams fan and Rabin's music is right up there with Williams.  The first thing I did when I reached my computer after seeing the movie was to check Amazon.com to see if the soundtrack had been released (it will be available 10 October).

Maybe only once every ten years is a good war movie released and this one should not be missed.  I suggest that you see it at the theater if possible (on the biggest screen available).  I suggest you hurry as it was only at my theater for two weeks but I managed to see it three times.  It is also number one on my ""must buy"" list of DVD's.

Now I can only hope that the upcoming movie ""Flags of our Fathers,"" based on the excellent book by James Bradley and Ron Powers, is as good as this movie was.",1160179200,15,6377,4.554385964912281
1611335,1,B00005JP86,"""The first WWI aviation film in 40 years"", so director Tony Bill reported gloats in a recent interview.  Actually, ""30"" would present a more accurate figure, considering the 1976 release of the JAck Gold's ""Aces High"", but no bother.  I needn't fret about Bill's lack of affinity for cinematic history; his readily apparent ineptitude in both the historical and technical departments is bad enough.

Talk about ineptitude (among other things), this supposed homage to an actual WWI squadron perpetuates just about every conceivable clich imaginable, furthermore effectively stealing elements from nearly every aviation flick ever devised, including Blue Max, the Dawn Patrol, Dark Blue World, the Tuskegee Airmen, and even that age-old silent flick from 1927, WINGS. Furtherome, the battle scenes themselves reflect the most cheesy elements of propaganda war flicks, culminating in the endless ranks of snarling villains, the cheering crowds on the ground below as our heroes intercept the strafing Huns to save the day, and even a veritable race against the proverbial clock to destroy a German airship before it supposedly ""obliterates"" the entirety of Paris.

And as of the various manners in which this film blatantly exhibits its readily apparent lack of prowess for historical and technical accuracies, let me count the ways.

For starters, let's consider the countless manners in which the on-screen aircraft repeatedly defy the laws physics. Admittedly, some reviewers have pointed out Tony Bill's part-time profession as an aerobatic pilot, which in essence appears to compromised his interpretations of World War I combat, as he seems to have derived his perception of first world war fighters from having logged too many hours in Pitts Special as opposed to having derived genuine insight into the performance capabilities and limitations of such elaborate contusions of fabric and wood. For one thing, the aircraft exhibit speeds twice in excess that of the actual performance capabilities of World War I aircraft, culminating in a host of physical implausibilities as overly efficient climbing characteristics as if instigated in the absence of a stall barrier, low-level maneuvers that would have invariably either stalled the aircraft or resulted in considerable wing shear, not to mention that these biplanes and Triplanes exhibit phenomenal roll-rates which no multi-winged aircraft on the planet could possibly emulate. Evidently, Tony Bill exhibits an accurate conception of three dimensional space, but not of the actual performance characteristics of First World War-era fighters.

Furthermore, the movie's glaring affinity for historical inaccuracy reflects the presence of numerous aircraft that never existed during the Escardrille's 1916 escapades, including the SE.5, Handley Page 400, Gotha IV, and of course the Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane, which brings me to another issue that drives me out of my mind, culminating in one of the most trivial misinterpretations about World War I aviation. Bottom line, the above depiction stems from a trivial and widespread popular misconception that by default associates World War One German aircraft with countless formations of red-coated Triplanes, as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen, to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers, culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.

In fact, the Lafayette Escabdrille fought the majority of its pitched-battles against outmoded Fokker E.III Eindeckers and two-seat Albatross and Aviatik observation scouts, the superior equipment of the Amercans frequently offset by their readily apparent lack of experience.

And another thing, the average life expectancy of a World War I pilot is actually confined to the space of a single week, unlike the film's more optimistic projection of 3 to 6. Furthermore, somebody should remind the screenwriters never to emphasizes the virtues of German aircraft by citing the presence of all powerful engines, as the rates of horsepower which the Germans managed to conceive lagged considerably behind that of their allied counterparts.

Furthermore, pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias, considering that, unlike World War II, rarely were aircrew assigned individual aircraft, often dispersing their ranks among the types available in a manner that typically resulted sharing planes out amongst each other. Furthermore, as blatantly misrepresnted by the  closing scene, there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish, as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length, scattering miles away from each other, thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.

Reverting to the film's one and only redeeming feature, the various aspects in which the Flyboys attempts to model battle damage in conjunction with the various behaviors of shedding wings and burning engines bear a more accurate depiction than the remainder of the film. However, given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of, as one reviewer stated ""playing a really cool video game"" as opposed to providing a genuine ""in the cockpit"" sensation for the expreiences of piloting such frail machinations.

Most offensive, however, is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour, all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.

In all fairness, perhaps I should lend Tony Bill an additional bone by citing the best moment of the entire movie, in which the guts of that blabbering Christian fanatic splatters the entirety of his instrument panel (the only moment in the entire film in which I cheered).

Ultimately, the inclusion of a photograph of the actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille seems like a cruel joke, as if the preceding spectacle of cartoonish escapism somehow culminates in an authentic tribute to the squadron in question.

Considering the shear sparsity of world war one related aviation flicks, it doesn't take a genius to brand this endeavor as by far the worst ever conceived.

For more informative and productive viewing, I can recommend virtually every other aviation flick on the market, from the veritable classics like ""Blue Max"" and ""Aces High"" , to some of the more lukewarm efforts of ""Ace of Aces"" and ""Von Richtofen and Brown"".",1160179200,10,6745,5.4340344168260035

This ranks in the top 5 war movies I have ever seen and I have seen them all. WWI is the forgotten war and brave American expatriots who volunteered to fight with the French were not only ahead of their countrymen. they were ahead of their time. Airplanes were only 12 years old when they were adapted for combat use. The characters were strong and believeable. Their evolution from civilian to warrior is timeless while the bonds forged in combat are never reproduced under any other circumstances. The special effects were stunning. It wins on every level.

1611338,3,B00005JP86,"MOVIE: Flyboys is a strange thing to dissect. It's a movie you really want to like, but you just can't help but face the fact that it's so cliched and poorly written. The story is centered around Blaine Rawlings, a young man who leaves his past to go fly planes in France. Each of the young men has a story behind them. Some do it for glory, some because they are forced to, some trying to make better lives for themselves, or some escaping their troubles. The film tells the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a fleet of young Americans who flew planes for the French in WWI before the U.S entered the war. The entire film is schmaltzy with some lame dialogue and weak acting, but it's entertaining. The dogfights, even though the CGI seems unpolished, are quick paced and really great. The story does a good job of building the characters, but since the characters are very flat we really don't care when they get shot down and die. Every formulaic cliche is followed and the movie itself can be followed like a map, there is no surprise as to where it builds and leads to. The audience can pretty much stay one step ahead of the characters, and that is due to the poorly written story. Decent cinematography and set design enhance the atmosphere of the movie, and the dogfights are intense and entertaining to watch. The movie just doesn't exceed in any area to make it memorable. The narrative is greatly enhanced by Trevor Rabins score. Rabin flexes his orchestral muscles and delivers one of his best scores ever. All in all the movie was a good experience, but it's just so cliched.

ACTING: The moment after I saw the trailer I asked myself why couldn't they have spent some money on a good cast. James Franco seems to play the same person in every movie. In his previous outing, The Great Raid, he played pretty much the same person. At least The Great Raid had Joseph Fiennes and Marton Csokas. The only credible actor here is Jean Reno who is always great even though the only reason he got the role was because he's French. Martin Henderson never lands good roles and I really don't like him. He tries to pull off a tough guy with a troubled past here, but you just want to flick his nose and laugh every time he gets all up in James Franco's face. A better cast could have helped with the lack of a quality script, it sure did with The Great Raid.

BOTTOM LINE: Amazing dogfights that should be seen on the big screen, but poor acting and a weak contrived script hinders this film from being anything extraordinary.",1159142400,6,2528,4.46969696969697

1611391,5,B00005JP86,"'Flyboys' is a great epic movie.  It zeros in on a group of American World War I flying aces, volunteering before President Wilson reluctantly brought U.S. involvement into the war.  Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) is the main protagonist.  Born and bred as a cowboy in Texas, he volunteers for the bravado of adventure.  He is joined by a wealthy American; an African-American who has expatriated to Paris as a boxer (and volunteered to fight wanting to escape both boxing and America); a pure-bred Bible Christian with a mission; a failed ex-con, fleeing the country; and an American trying to keep the family military lineage going.  They join up with a French flying unit and are under the wing of an arrogant and wary American pilot residing at a mansion sized estate and their French commander, Capt. Thenault.  Their mission proves to be more daunting than their initial cockiness calls them to be, but they soon learn and develop pilot and combat skills.

The movie contains some dizzying airborne scenes that surpass post-modern expectations.  (If this movie isn't playing at the I-Max, then it should be.  Afterall, it would be a missed opportunity on the part of both the purveyor and the audience.)  Besides a compelling plot (which is based on a true story, afterall) there's good comraderie and a romance added well to the mix.  The former provides some well-developed complications and entertainment.  For the romance, the innocent balcony-type scenes couldn't possibly offend anyone.  If there seems to be a distance between Rawlings and his French girl, Lucianne (Jennifer Decker), it's because of a language barrier (something quite natural, for crying out loud!)  But if love is a language, then there is a connection that surpasses the lack of dialogue.  There aren't going to be any prizes awarded for the acting, but Franco is likable enough as the swaggering Rawlings, and the rest of the cast provide engaging performances, nevertheless.  The tension and resentment based on class, experience, arrogance, and race is certainly given a believable treatment.  How they can cover all of the bases, clock in without becoming tedious, mix it all up without becoming jarring, and provide an uplifting experience amongst the war and strife is a major achievement.

Not to be too reactionary, but there's something to be said about the criticism of 'Flyboys'.  To some it will seem like a cornball adventure.  First, one must divide the worthy corn from the shmaltzy.  This film works.  (To be fair, critics do honor corny movies, but no one dies in 'Hoosiers' or 'Field of Dreams'.)  Perhaps this movie makes some people uncomfortable because it does honor bravery in battle, chivalry, and comraderie.  ('Flyboys' does contain some inspiring, but dated little pep talks that may inspire the ""cliche'"" label.)  It may glorify the war experience, but it certainly doesn't hedge about the horrors.  Wisely, almost expertly, they glide over the atrocities of war in a way that is both unvarnished, but not enough to entirely gross out the audience.  Nothing is swept under the rug.  As the new volunteers pass by casualties on a train platform, they find plenty of war's realities.  (And, so does the audience.)  I also believe that there may be less enthusiasm for 'Flyboys' because the German army presented has almost a generation remaining before they become Nazis (even if the enemy is certainly presented with enough menace).  I prefer movies that promote peace over war.  But if there is to be war, movies like 'Flyboys' are inspiring works which showcase four flying aces that show courage, heart, and chivalry.  'Flyboys' is a great war movie that soars!",1159056000,4,3675,5.041459369817579
1611392,4,B00005JP86,"For some reason, critics generally don't get this type of movie. Maybe they're too young. Maybe they have no affection for (or perhaps knowledge of) the genre war movies of the 40s. They want these movies to be ""meaningful"". They want them to ""resonate"".

But movies like this are just fun, like the old Errol Flynn/Clark Gable/John Wayne movies. They are Saturday afternoon popcorn movies, and there aren't nearly enough of them. I didn't care how ""accurate"" the movie was. I had fun. I loved it. And the romance (no sex) occupied only a small part of it, as it should (unlike Pearl Harbor, which sank under the weight of it).

4 stars out of 5 due to its being somewhat overlong. But it definitely should be seen at least once on the big screen.

1611393,3,B00005JP86,"You know, in this day of CG animation, there is absolutely no excuse for the problems with this film!  As for it being 'based on a true story,' the only things 'true' about it could be counted on one hand.  Yes, there WAS a Lafayette Escadrille; yes, they DID have a lion as a mascot named 'Whiskey;' yes, there WAS a black pilot in the squadron; yes, Vanderbilt DID rent a chateau for them to use as a barracks, and yes, they did fly Nieuports for a while.  As for the rest of the story, it is either rubbish, or was composed of a number of incidents actually attributable to a large number of pilots from other squadrons.  But even that didn't bother me so much as the PLANES used in this movie!  I can't understand it!  They got so many of the other details correct (motorcycles, the aerodrome, cars, etc, etc.), how could they screw up the planes so badly, when almost all of them and almost all of the flying scenes were CG??  Is there ANYONE who does not know that the famous Red Baron Von Richtofen was the ONLY German to fly an all-red triplane?  As far as I am aware, he was the ONLY German to fly an all-red airplane, period.  So why are there entire squadrons of all-red triplanes flying around in this movie?  This is an idiotic mistake that could only have happened because the stupid CG animators simply copied the red triplanes out of some stupid video game (probably along with the rest of the planes as well).  Blue, green, yellow, checkerboard, just about any OTHER color or color combination could have worked!  Also, why did the two-seater (called a Sopwith 1 1/2 strutter, for those that care) not have FRENCH markings, since it belonged to the squadron as their training plane (it was in British markings throughout the movie)?  As this was a real aircraft (along with one of the Nieuports, an SE-5, a Bristol, and perhaps one of the Fokker Triplanes, the rest were all CG), my guess is the real owners didn't want their nice British paint job screwed up, but the CG animators could easily have made the changes after filming.  Continuity!!  And considering the film-makers were in close contact with all the owners and fliers of the real aircraft, all of whom may be considered experts on WW1 aircraft and markings, why is it none of these issues were ever dealt with?  All of these things were acceptable when WW1 flying movies were filmed in the '20's and 30's, because the technology was simply not available to make the movies truly accurate.  And I know there are a lot of people out there that think I am being too fussy, but dammit!  Think about the movie 'Top Gun,' and imagine it filmed with Cessnas instead of F14's, and perhaps you might get the idea.

Pilots were actually required to join the French Foreign Legion first, but it's another minor point for the story (stories). Several stories going on and I enjoyed them all.

It's a good thing that the movie remained a War Movie, not a Love Story.

Here are a few historical inaccuracies.  The tri-planes were not common in 1916.  They were really hard to manipulate.  But I understand that the director put them in the film for extra visual stimulation, because they do look menacing.
