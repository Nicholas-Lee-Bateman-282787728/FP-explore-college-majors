2296287,2,B0009K8L4S,"There appear to be 3 versions of this currently available.  I own two of them.  Of the two I own, the CHEEZY FLICKS disc is preferred over the TRINITY disc for the following reasons:

1) Though image quality of the CHEEZY FLICKS disc is not great, it is clearer than the TRINITY disc.
2) The CHEEZY FLICKS disc includes extras (vintage intermission ads and trailers for other movies), while the TRINTIY does not.
3) The TRINITY disc cuts-off a tiny bit more of the image on the sides of the frame than the CHEEZY FLICKS disc does.

That said, the TRINITY disc does have two things going for it:

1) The color on the TRINITY disc is richer on the CHEEZY FLICKS disc.
2) The CHEEZY FLICKS disc cuts-off more image on the top and bottom than the TRINITY disc does (and the amount of loss is greater than the amount of side-to-side loss that one gets with the TRINITY disc.",1273276800,3,869,4.372670807453416

2296290,1,B0009K8L4S,This was a surprisingly terrible movie. You would think with Richard Pryor and Fred Williamson it would be a decent movie but this was the total opposite. It made no sense and the acting was terrible! I wanted to give it 0 stars but the system wouldn't allow me to! Stay away!,1233014400,,276,4.326923076923077
2296291,2,B0009K8L4S,"Kind of grainy on picture. I guess expected due to the time period. Richard Pyror at his funniest though to me did not mix well with The Hammer's tough guy image. Good funny western to pass away the time. Good collection piece for 70""s collectors like myself.",1205971200,,259,4.531914893617022
2296292,1,B0009K8L4S,"Dreadful DVD presentation by 905 Entertainment/Trinity Entertainment. Opening credits are ""squeezed"" (tall and skinny people), then switches to pan and scan mode for the remainder of the film. Actors are often off-screen, out of focus, cut in half, etc. Don't bother.",1196812800,5,267,5.536585365853658
2296293,1,B0009K8L4S,"The DVD is completely un-viewable. Zero Star. It should not have been sold at all.

The picture is always in zoom mode. As a result, I could see only the faces of the actors when they're fighting or shooting! The picture is blurry. The sound is noisy. I could hardly hear them talking.

I felt I was cheated.",1194307200,7,308,4.293103448275862

2296307,1,B0009K8L4S,"I only heard of this movie a couple days ago & after watching it I can see why. The movie was just TERRIBLE! I like almost all of Richard Pryor's movies except for a few so I at least expected to like him in this but he was just not funny & so was the movie. I had a real hard time sitting through it all but somehow I did. The best thing I can say about Adios Amigo is that I got to watch it for free. I said it before & I'll say it again, This movie was TERRIBLE!",1432080000,,465,3.613861386138614

2296335,3,B0009K8L4S,I like Richard Pryor movies. He was a funny actor. This is a western and I  don't like all westerns but it helps if there is some comedy to them.,1397692800,,145,3.8333333333333335
2296336,5,B0009K8L4S,Pretty good older western starring Richard Pryor.  I laughed through the entire movie and I will more than likely watch it again.,1381881600,,129,4.863636363636363

2296339,5,B0009K8L4S,I enjoyed this western. Pryor is funny as hell especially at the campsite watching the two women and so mesmerized by them that he accidentally feed his nose a spoon of food. Classic Pryor in this movie. Get it and watch it pronto.,1352851200,,231,4.395348837209302
2296340,4,B0009K8L4S,"I have heard about this movie for some years, but did not have the opportunity to see it until now. Both Fred Williamson and Richard Prior gave brilliant performances, but i think that Prior stole the show.  The movies was hilarious. More comedy than action, but overall: it was worth my time.
The delivery was timely and the condition was as the seller described.  I will be happy to purchase from Moviemars again.  Thanks.",1338422400,,424,4.702702702702703
2296341,5,B0009K8L4S,"ADIOS AMIGO is an independent film I would call
A Nostalgia Fantasy. It didn't have to be marketed as a movie with any sexual or violent content. Nor did it need such an influence of sexual desire in the story line. Because that's not even the focus.

There's a bit of a folklore feel to this movie with the paintings used as transitions in this film. The names, places, and characters in this film are not new, but unique in a way which also gives it a folklore feeling.

Adios Amigo wasn't meant to be a big budget movie for its time, but it is a movie that has influenced the characters in the movie ""Life"" played by Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence. Possibly due to Martin Lawrence's and Eddie Murphy's interest in Richard Pryor.

I'm surprised no one has made a remake of Adios Amigo on a bigger budget.",1335139200,,808,4.373333333333333
2296342,1,B0009K8L4S,"This movie looked a lot like bootleg. The picture quality is poor, and it is definitely not formatted to fit a TV screen.",1294531200,,121,4.304347826086956

8062357,1,B0009K8L4S,"""Adios Amigo"" (1976) was Richard Pryor's consolation prize for not playing Black Bart in Mel Brooks' 1974 classic ""Blazing Saddles."" Instead of Gene Wilder, the comic legend teams up with blaxploitation icon (and low-budget auteur) Fred Williamson for this amateurish Western romp. Their amiable chemistry does little to redeem a cocktail-napkin script and meager production values. Director Williamson gave Pryor free improvisational reign, but the comedian mostly fires blanks. Though ""Adios Amigo"" made a fast buck, it now exists as a public-domain curiosity.
