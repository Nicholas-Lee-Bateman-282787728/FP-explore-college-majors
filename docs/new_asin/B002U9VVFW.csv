8381160,5,B002U9VVFW,"We worked through a couple of beginner DVDs on waltz and took a beginning ballroom dance class at a community college.  But once you've learned the basic patterns they usually teach in these classes, it's hard to get all the way through a song without getting bored.  We needed to learn some new patterns.

If you've worked through the typical beginner level stuff and are looking for something with more patterns, I'd highly recommend this one.  Though I'll note it may not be for those who want to dance competitively, if you're a social dancer this is a good choice.",1259884800,2,569,4.66
