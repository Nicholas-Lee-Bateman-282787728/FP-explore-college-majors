8640831,5,B00IC9KDSU,"I had seen this film in its theatrical release , 47 years ago. I was always a fan of YVES MONTAND. Regarless of the role, I found it compelling to watch him up close. He became his character. In this film, he plays a rather callous runaround, for he is married to a beautiful and wonderful woman. When he meetsCandice Bergen, he turns on his charm and, once again, engages in a torrid affair. Only this time, he finds reason to pause and realize that his wife is who he, at long las, really wants. He visits a club, sits at a table for one and watches her dance with the new men in her life. She appears to be supremely happy. She has grown to pass him by. He watches as long as he can, brokenhearted now. He puts on his snow-coat and, giving her a long glance which she doe not return and approaches his snow-covered car. I'll stop the spoilers at this point, except to say that if you enjoyed the ending of FALLING IN LOVE, this is more subtle and shall pierce your heart. We romantic fools can best be understood by other romantic fools. See it and you'll thank me for the memories.",1407110400,6,1085,4.221153846153846
