Having followed the advice of this film to the letter, and being still alive today, I wonder sometimes what would have come had I not been enlightened.  And now, the Rapture is upon us again.  On December 21, 2012, we face the same imminent crisis, and there is no better a time to review the vital survival points outlined in this invaluable program.  I have already begun to stock up on trash cans for toilet water, but remember, DO NOT use plastic bags for your toilet.  JUST DON'T, okay?!

Thank you, Leonard Nimoy and company, for not only ensuring my survival eleven years ago, but again next year when Michele Bachmann is elected President of the United States.",1315699200,5,784,4.60431654676259

Now that society has essentially broken down, the advice in this video is a must have. I deducted two stars because Nimoy didn't wear Spock ears. I would have taken it much more seriously, as Spock never engaged in hyperbole. Also, without the Spock ears, Nimoy was unable to calculate probabilities with any substantive accuracy. Had Nimoy engaged in such shoddy work aboard the Enterprise, Kirk would have been dead early in the series, and there would have been no one available to gallavant through space kissing alien women while speaking in halting dramatic speech.",1017014400,23,721,4.918032786885246
7887047,5,6305300224,this is one of the best videos on y2k that I have seen. It is informative yet not alarmest. The explanations of the various problems that y2k can cause are easy to understand as well as the kinds of preparations that can  be made. This is a very good video for the whole family to watch. Leonard  Nimoy is the perfect narrator and this is coming from someone who never was  a Star Trek fan!,920505600,3,390,4.173333333333333
