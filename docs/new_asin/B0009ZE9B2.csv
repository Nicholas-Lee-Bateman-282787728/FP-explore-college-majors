8070887,3,B0009ZE9B2,"Director Ebrahim Hatamikia seems to specialize in war films and thrillers, or a mixture of the two.  I've seen one other of his 16 or so films, the 1999 ""Glass Agency"", about the social problems and crime brought on by the Iran-Iraq war.  I saw it at a film festival and neither it nor any of his other films apart from this one seem to be commercially available, which is too bad as our understanding of Iranian cinema in the USA comes almost entirely through meditative dramas, documentaries and comedies that tend to involve children.  Of course there are many restrictions in the Iranian cinema - nearly as many involving violence as those restricting sex - but Hatamikia is one director who has managed to deal with violence and ""tough"" stories over and over, and it would be nice to be able to get a clearer look at his work.

I found ""The Glass Agency"" pretty riveting throughout and so had high hopes for this film, which alas were only partially fulfilled.  Previous reviewer Brian Erland has done a good job recounting the plot so I won't go into great detail here; I found the beginning, which is a bit deliberately muddled and confusing, pretty compelling - it takes a while before we're sure what exactly is going on, what will happen when Ghassem gets on the plane, what role his wife Nargess (Iranian star Leila Hatami) will play.  It's a pretty obvious bit of irony that Ghassem is concerned with independence for himself, with breaking what he sees as the bonds of an oppressive government - but is perfectly willing to have not just his own wife but other members of his family submit to his will.  For a while the tension in the family, and the back-and-forth in Ghassem's own goals, is rather compelling.  There's also a Jewish couple on board and it's nice to see the way the various characters deal with this fact; I've seen few Iranian films that deal with overt racism and I was pleased at the nuanced view of the subject here.

Unfortunately, it just goes on a bit long for what is really a fairly simple plotline.  It's rare that I'll say that a film is too long, particularly an intense thriller with political and social relevance like this, but there's just a little bit too much of the shouting and crying and wondering who will get the gun, whose personality will ultimately dominate, all in a tightly restricted space with no respite.  In the last few minutes matters improve, as the tension finally overpowers the shouting and arguing, and we have a rather strange, mystical and not wholly comprehensible finale that really left me wondering.  I suspect the end won't work for a lot of people, but if you're a fan of open-ended or inconclusive films, it might be for you.  I think there may be some religious elements here too that could help explain what I didn't get; in any case, I found this last part quite fascinating and that's all I can say without spoiling it.

In sum, an interesting but not wholly compelling example of the Iranian crime/thriller genre.  If you can find a way to see the director's earlier ""Glass Agency"" I'd certainly recommend that, and I think Rafi Pitts' recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hunter-2010/dp/B0080OAFN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hunter (2010)</a>&nbsp;is an even better example of what inventive Iranian filmmakers can do in telling an intense story given the limitations imposed by the state.  Still this is worth a look for those interested in Iranian cinema generally or fans of the great actress Leila Hatami, and the IRMovies disc looks better than some of their others, though the obviously low budget of the film is quite apparent.",1379721600,2,3672,4.8512
8070888,4,B0009ZE9B2,"A miraculously entertaining representation of the suffocating nature of modern Iran, Low Heights follows the story of one disillusioned  family who is  absolutely determined to leave their homeland behind any cost necessary. Although it is at times a tense thriller, the heart of the movie lies in the humorous quirks and loving connections between each family-member.
I certainly recommend this movie to anyone who lives for great dialogue and character development.",1337558400,2,467,5.563380281690141
8070889,1,B0009ZE9B2,This an incredible story.  The acting is highly exaggerated & superficial. What happens & how it ends has a lot to do with the suffocating atmosphere in Iran.  This film is entirely worthless & watching it is a total waste of time.,1298332800,,231,4.476190476190476

Synopsis: A distraught Iranian named Ghassem (Hamid Farokhnezhad) hopes to discover a new life for his pregnant wife Nargess (Leila Hatami), son and himself by leaving his native Iran and escaping to the West. He perceives his only way out is by hijacking a plane and seeking asylum in Dubai. In order to lessen the odds of being overtaken by fellow passengers he invites a large number of family and friends to come along under the pretext of having new jobs at a British oil company arranged for everyone.

However the fun and excitement turns deadly when Ghassem makes his intentions known when he overpowers the security guard onboard and begins waving his gun around. Is Ghassem alone in his dream to escape to a better life or will the other passengers re-evaluate the lives they lead in Iran and decide to join in on the escape?

Critique: I was initially attracted to the '02 Iranian film `Low Heights' for one simple reason, its co-star is the enchanting Leila Hatami. I really didn't expect much from this low budget production but I must say I was quite surprised by the end. The story begins rather slowly and has the feel of a rather silly comedy, but once the hijacking is in progress the mood and tempo change drastically and the viewer finds himself/herself involved in a taunt, dramatic and complicated tale of competing hopes and dreams, familial relationships, cultural beliefs and political ideologies.

There are also a number of unexpected twists and turns that keep you wondering what's going to happen until the very end. In fact the ending turns out to be quite surreal and ambiguous, so you still may be unsure as to how things turned out. I think that was director Ebrahim Hatamikia's intention.",1207612800,10,1787,4.830065359477124
8070891,5,B0009ZE9B2,"Please pardon my review, I could not include last part of my review for Leila Hatami's other film called Leila.

Here it is:

------

A couple of suggestions and thumps ups about some issues discussed in the film:

1) True love waits. Both man and woman can love each other. Mutual love is possible. Life is not about sex, the director did not NEED to show any scene with the truly&passionately-in-love couple having sex. Yes, maybe it is not allowed in the country to have such a film, but he showed the audience that we do NOT need to see them having sex to confirm that they have a passionate relationship.

2) Mother-in-laws can be very influencing. Still, the wife listens to her mother-in-law. I really felt bad about Leila being deeply influenced and left struggling with the idea of accepting a second wife in the house.

3) The beautiful women named Leila (with a beautiful name meaning ""night"") showing such incredible patience until she sees the second women in her house. Then, she runs away from the fact that now there is her, husband, and new wife. It is truly unacceptable to have two women in the same house, in today's world. But, do not forget to look back and read what was it like for a man to marry more than one women. Please, do not rely on one source of information. Bring three different viewpoints to your own conclusion. Regulations change relative to the period of time.

4) The religion of Islam was embedded in the sequence of actions in the film. However, the director did not choose to let us hear ""the athan (call of the prayer)"" in the film. Still, we had a chance to witness the women praying in many scenes. ""The willing of God"" was well explained in the film.

5) 129 minutes for a film is not short, but may be long. However, you do not feel like it. I wanted to watch more although it was the end when Leila had finally seen his husband's daughter from his second wife whom he divorced (by mutual agreement) after the birth of the child.

6) And last, the Turkish coffee, or Arabic coffee (or even Greek coffee:) Yes, in the film there are a couple of scenes where Leila and Reza are reading the grounds of the coffee (Turkish coffee cup reading, or fortune telling). Although it is not highly recommended to base your life on mystery, still it is different flavor in life, like a break from reality, and rely on some strong imagination. Yes, even listening to the other person reading and interpreting the symbols on your coffee ground is exciting and thought-provoking. Won't you like someone to read about how you feel now and what might happen in your future without giving that person any clue other than the coffee you just drank and turned over to let the coffee grounds dry.

7-a) OK, one more:) I liked the marriage ceremony (well, the first one, because the second one was heart-breaking for Leila. The cars were honking and following the car of the bride and the groom.

7-b) The idea of service. The incredible acknowledgment of endless serving food and drinks to your guests.

7-c) Kebab in the country side. Very lovely, relaxing, enjoying.

7-d) Every religion has its characteristics. Islam is a religion of peace and faith. This film clearly articulates the faith and peace components well.

This film is full of culture. And this is my first review:) I tried to raise some questions from some of the scenes in the film. Thanks for your time.",1174262400,2,3399,4.569078947368421
