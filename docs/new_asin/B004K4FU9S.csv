4392619,4,B004K4FU9S,"Family friendly, beautiful setting, with some Christian values on display, tried and true veteran support actors make for an overall good, clean show.

The story: long separated parents come together in Texas to fight for custody of daughter.  Business driven Mom lives in the big city with daughter; Dad remained in the simpler, gorgeous, horse country of  Texas.  The judge(Catherine Hicks) wants them to all spend time together while awaiting the final determination.  Mom and daughter stay at easy going, wise grandpa's (Tom Skerritt) place, visit with gentle, counselor/pastor(John Schneider), and interact with varying results with the dad(Brad Rowe) who still pines for his family.

There's mild and sometimes amusing tension between the parents and the dad's potential love interest.  Most everyone wants them to get back together, but will the two blind, ex-lovebirds realize it for themselves?

When I first watched this film: the 2 fighting leads really annoyed me. I felt better about them, watching it again.  The writing was a bit forced, and they came across selfish, petulant, overplayed or smarmy.  I didn't find their interaction that humorous. Perhaps, it was meant to be that way, and then as they mature around each other and see the bigger picture, they become more likeable.

The tried and true veterans, who have important but much smaller roles, like, Fred Willard, as the mom's boss- who pretty much acts in the whole movie via the phone- along with Skerritt and Schneider are quite easy to watch.  Their acting comes across so natural and real.  I would say the same for the actor playing the daughter- who does a terrific job conveying all the emotions involved in a broken family.

Overall, a pleasant film if not totally stirring or new. I think it's meant to be more comedic and love felt than dramatic.  And of course, all's well that ends well, as expected with this genre.  3-4 stars depending on your tolerance for predictablity and sentimentality, 4 stars to encourage further efforts at good family films.",1302825600,30,2042,5.050746268656717

4392660,3,B004K4FU9S,"This was a really good movie. However, the music is louder than the talking! You can barely hear what the actors are saying because the music is so loud! This was very poorly produced. Which is very unfortunate because without all the technical issues this movie is very good!",1469664000,,276,4.653061224489796
4392671,1,B004K4FU9S,"First the technical issues: The music was very good. It was well produced and set the mood to good effect. Cinematography was also good. Scenes were well composed visually, and establishing shots were convincing. Finally the acting was very good. A few characters were weak, but I think that had more to do with weaknesses in the script, which was sub-par.

The problem I had with this movie was that it was labeled as having Christian family values, but the ending was pure political correctness.

Our female protagonist spends most of the movie showing what a selfish wife, and rotten (but very loving?) mother she is. We're supposed to believe that she's loving because she keeps telling her daughter how much she loves her, while breaking every promise she makes and consistently putting her daughter's needs behind her own career. ""Mommy loves you, but mommy needs a promotion, and you'll just have to make do.""

(spoilers from here on)

As the movie progresses we see her begin to doubt her decision to leave her husband and go to New York City. We see her enjoying county life more, and partaking of the folk wisdom surrounding her. Until at the climax, she stands up in court and says what a rotten person she has been, and finally decides to do openly what she's been deceiving herself about all along; to give her daughter to her husband and put her carrier truly first in her life.

At this point the male protagonist admits what we had discovered in the previous scene; That he's bankrupt, and about to lose his ranch so he couldn't take care of the kid in the first place when he dragged the wife into court in Texas. (They should have just said it was California since they didn't shoot in Texas anyway, and it shows.)  So we have one parent to whom the daughter is an afterthought, and another who weaponizes her. But they're both really nice about it, and sincere, and they keep talking about how much they love their daughter, so they must be nice people. Except that at no point in the movie do either of them sacrifice anything for the little girl.

So in the end they both get rewarded for their misdeeds. She gets a promotion, and a live-in babysitter to further stroke her prideful ego, and he gets to keep his ranch in return for being a live-in babysitter. This is not family values, nor is it even remotely Christian.

Where does the Christian come from? Well, some characters wear crosses, and there's a church with a big gold cross on the alter. There's a scene where people talk about having been baptized. There's also Bo Duke playing a pastor with permanent five-o-clock shadow, who spouts such biblical wisdom as ""marriage is about communication."" Sorry folks, but marriage is about unconditional love. Everything else follows from that. You are to love your spouse and your children unconditionally as God loves you. Even when you don't want to, or when the spouse doesn't deserve it, (and none of us does deserve it.) or when he's being a jerk or she's being a wench.

Which brings me to the most serious problem I had with this movie; It's a poison pill. It was dressed up in family values with the right code words, and emotional triggers, but at it's core lies the subtly twisted poison of cultural Marxism. It's a package designed to shoot past your filters before you've had time to think about the irrationality of it all, and accept things which are the opposite of family values.

On the other hand, if you are a member of a political correct church, there's a good chance that you will find this a sweet movie with a positive message.",1469145600,,3576,4.61732283464567

4392742,2,B004K4FU9S,"I wanted to love it. I really, and truly, did. I tried very hard to care about the characters and their lives, battles with emotions, and each other. I just honestly didn't feel that way when I had finished more than half the movie, and it's only saving grace was the non-traditional ending (spoilers to explain to come).

*may contain spoilers- but I will try not to give away the whole story*
Elisa Donovan plays Laura, a country girl who married a country boy, Dylan (played by Brad Rowe). Dylan and Laura have a daughter together, Kelsey. Laura is a single working mother. The typical type that is in many movies. This bothered me from the start, she seemed to have this fake ""I'm a strong woman"" persona about her when really she was a mess inside. I'd rather see a confident woman, perhaps a single mother, who seeks to enrich her life...not a Band-Aid fix for her past regrets.
Kelsey's father sues Laura for joint custody, leaving Laura no choice but to return to her hometown in Texas. Laura and Dylan parted ways on not so good terms. Dylan enjoys his simple life in a small town while Laura wanted more, goodness forbid, a career.
After  non-conventional court hearing with the judge, Laura and Dylan must take the time to get to know each other again so that perhaps they can come together to do what is best for their daughter Kelsey. Along the way, Laura and Dylan re-discover what they loved about each other and confront the idea of being a family once more.
The story was bumpy from start to finish. I love Elisa Donovan, but her acting in this was so unnatural feeling. It was forced, especially in highly emotional scenes with the young girl playing her daughter Kelsey. There was a lot of heavy sighing, long pauses, and ineffective emotional scenes that felt trite. The writers tried to use a new love interest for Dylan as a way to force Laura to examine her feelings for Dylan and instead of creating a revelation for Laura it just made the character come off a ""I don't want you, but I don't want anyone else to want you either"" type of personality, which really grated on my nerves. There really was no chemistry between Laura and Dylan. Nothing to really make me think they truly had anything other than a slight comfortable antagonistic relationship between them.
I truly found myself half way through- completely bored with the story and not really caring if they worked it out or not. That's not what I want from a Hallmark feel good love story!
The one thing about this movie that made me happy was the ending. In most Hallmark movies you see the heroine giving up her job, her town, her life, her everything to go scampering after the man. *She* is the one that gives up what she's worked for because according to most of these movies, a woman is just not ""complete and content and truly in her rightful place"" without sacrificing the most. Don't get me wrong here, I *do* love a fanciful romance....but lately I've seen many of these where it's a one sided sacrifice.
This movie's ending differed in that Dylan decided to give up his ranch, and move to the big city to be with Laura and Kelsey. *He* was the one that made the sacrifice and that was something I rarely if *ever* see in a movie like this. It was nice, very unconventional and I loved that.

The great ending, however, could not save the poorly acted moments that ruined this hallmark movie for me to truly enjoy.

The other thing that annoyed me (and does so in many movies ""set in Texas"") is the deliberate use of stereotypical ""Cowboy"" settings- boots, hats, dirt roads, and horses. I get it, Dylan had a ranch, so did Laura's dad.....they rode horses and many people here in Texas do, indeed, have horses...however, not all of us sport western wear 24/7 as if it's mandatory dress code. The second Laura steps back into her hometown the boots and hats emerged and it was just so silly. I wish just once, in a movie set in Texas, we could be shown as the normal people we are....wearing regular jeans, regular shoes...even flip flops!, and the occasional cowboy here and there...which is actually what it's *really* like.",1407628800,,4120,4.556005398110662

4392758,4,B004K4FU9S,"The movie was a good family movie, but they really missed an amazing opportunity to share what God says about marriage.  The entire ""Sunday Church Service"" was only a few minutes long with no worship, prayer, or even truth from God's Word and they didn't even film it in a way where you could imagine that those things took place off camera.  What the Pastor had to say about marriage was just a quick feel-good statement that I found quite lame.  What a shame that they did not take this opportunity to share God's heart for marriage in a biblical way.",1398211200,,553,4.455445544554456
4392759,3,B004K4FU9S,"I really do.  With actors like Tom Skerritt, Elisa Donovan, John Schneider, and Catherine Bach, the movie should have been better.  Why can't these screenwriters, producers, and directors give them lines that are believable?  Why can't they come up with stories that have more substance?  And while they're at it, if they choose to set a movie in Centerville, Texas, (the name of a real Texas town), why can't it look more like the area in which it's supposed to be set?  (There are no mountains in the real Centerville - the movie was filmed in California.)
While the story is a show about ""good family values"" and Christian faith, the plot is predictable, most of the dialogue is stilted and shallow (and completely unrealistic at times), and the relationships between the some of the characters are unclear at best - and often downright muddy.  I believe those values and faith deserve better than just an ""ok"" film that's not a bad ""one-time rental.""
I realize that not every movie has to leave viewers feeling uplifted and hopeful, but a movie like this should make the viewer feel good at the end.  All I felt was irritated that the talented actors and important message were watered down by the other inferior elements of the film.  I gave it 3 stars because of its potential, but overall I'd have to say it didn't live up to it.",1397433600,4,1336,4.63135593220339

Female judge cast as having done a good job of mediating the reunion.
This movie was about subtly influencing followers of biblical morality to embrace para-christian values that endorse swapping natural gender roles and leaving everyone to their own devices, regardless of virtue or value or commitment.

She just lights up the screen, and she is very believable with each of her characters.  She has exceptional comic timing, which makes her a good choice for a light-hearted romantic comedy.  In this movie, Elisa is a single mother who chose to leave her unsupportive husband many years ago to take on a career in the city, and just became too busy to get around to filing for that little thing called a divorce.  When the husband files for joint custody of their daughter, Elisa must take time off from work (something she rarely does) to move back to her little country town while she takes care of this mess.  But as she starts spending more time with her daughter, and less time at work, she starts to realize what's really important.  She also begins to see her husband in a brand new light, and realizes he's not the same man he use to be, because he also knows what's important in life, and isn't afraid to fight for it.  And what he's fighting for is to get his wife and daughter back.

The movie provides a serious side, some humor, great background scenery, a few minor surprises and all in good, clean taste.  Rather than rent it, I bought it, as I'm sure I'll want to view it again in the future.

4392786,4,B004K4FU9S,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Your Love Never Fails was really quite clean. There was a few utterances of mild crude language; drinking of alcohol; mild cleavage and tension/arguing between a husband and wife.  It is rated G and the Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.

I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and then bought the DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  I wouldn't say it is my favorite, mostly because of the wife.  She is kind of selfish.  She first left her husband and father in Texas and moved to New York with her daughter, because she wanted a better life/job and he wouldn't go with them because he wanted to stay on his family's ranch.  (You would think that she wouldn't have married him if she didn't want to run the ranch/stables with him).  She is then angry that after many years he files for joint custody of their daughter.  (Even though it was her that just ""never got around"" to getting the divorce).  She then still upset with her husband throughout almost the entire show that he just can't see that he should completely relinquish custody.  (Even though she is finding that she still loves him).
in spite of all of this, you do get past it (and so does she) and when she finds that he is about to lose everything, she realizes that he needs his daughter as much as she and his daughter need him.  The final odd thing was that she didn't end up staying in Texas even though she found that she was enjoying the simple life she left, but rather he moved to New York with her.  Oh well...as I said I am grateful for when I can find a clean movie and the story and characters were enjoyable.  It deals with family values, making difficult decisions, forgiveness, and includes a fine though brief sermon from the local pastor, Pastor Frank, played nicely by John Schneider. The pastor makes a nice comment which is, ""The goal of God's command is love.""

Overall, I enjoyed this movie and will watch it again.",1369785600,,2230,4.402439024390244

The American southwest country ranch, music, and chivalry of behatted gentlemen made me nostalgic for Texas, and I appreciate the female lead giving her Christian man his due dignity.
