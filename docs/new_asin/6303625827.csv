It looks like they are improving the sets with each release.  For international customers, sets are labelled Zone 0-6 (Amazon please get this right) Much better than anything on TV today. I would reccomend continuining with the set. This is an excellent buy for those that wish to have the first 3 seasons.",1067990400,34,432,4.5256410256410255

698420,5,6303625827,"If you see only one Little House episode in your life, see this one!!!... It has been my favorite for years. It's really about forgiving, understanding, and loving your family through hard times. With all the things going on in the world, this is what it all boils down to, and this is what TV should be. This is just a beautiful movie with excellent family values, outstanding acting (Michael Landon's performance is one to remember), and a strong feel-good tone brought together to create a story you can appreciate and characters you can admire.
I definitely recommend this. And if you're new to ""Little House,"" I would also recommend the others in the series. Check out some really good ones like ""Remember Me,"" ""Premiere Movie,"" ""Craftsman,"" and many more. This is a show that will never lose its flavor.",1029196800,5,809,4.785714285714286
698421,5,6303625827,"What a beautiful and touching movie. I have recently become a huge Little House fan, thanks to my mom who got me hooked on the TV series =) This is one of the most powerful episodes I have ever seen--it's so REAL and therefore incredibly effective. What I like so much about the Little House videos is that they have such strong family morals. This is a family that loves each other so much, you just want to cry because it is so touching. In ""The Lord is my Shepherd,"" the spirited young Laura Ingalls gets nervous when a baby boy is born into their family. She sees her Pa with his new son and worries that the baby will take her place in her father's heart. Laura's jealousy is so thick that she refuses to pray for her brother when he comes down with an illness that threatens to take his life. But, as it turns out, Laura ends up being the most devastated one in her family when the baby dies. She feels that the baby's death is her fault, and she feels overwhelmingly guilty because she actually believes that her father wants a son more than he wants her. Lost in her own emotions, Laura runs away to the mountains and, through the grace of God, meets a kindhearted old hermit named Jonathan who befriends Laura and gradually counsels her through gentle advice and a sense of understanding. It is Jonathan who will help Laura come to the realization that nobody could possibly love and need her the way her Pa does (and if you watch some more videos in the series, you will immediately see how much he really loves and cherishes Laura). It is a truly beautiful story that moved me so deeply. Both Laura and Pa learn valuable lessons about unconditional family love. The Ingalls family paints a clear picture of what family is all about. The acting here is strong, solid, and consistent. Melissa Gilbert is heart-melting and sincere as little Laura, and Michael Landon is absolutely incredible in his role. To me, he IS Charles ""Pa"" Ingalls, and the only one I can imagine fit for the part. He may very well be one of the most masterful actors I have ever seen. He plays the role to the max, and he becomes the character both inside and out. His acting is so strong--in fact, all of the acting in ""Little House on the Prairie"" is amazing. Sorry if I ended up writing too much--but when it comes to movies like this, there aren't enough words in the world to describe how good they are. ""The Lord is My Shepherd"" is a beautiful, beautiful story with all the morality, love, and sensitivity that you could ask for in a movie. Blended in with the hardships of pioneer life and a vision of the courageous individuals who lived through it, it makes a pretty impressive movie that you can watch with your entire family. Don't wait any longer to watch these shows--I truly do hope that you will buy some of them, because I'm sure you will be very moved and inspired by the message that they have to share. (sorry again for making this too long!!!)",1018051200,10,2946,4.417279411764706
698422,5,6303625827,"Hands down, I gotta say that this was the most wonderful ""Little House"" episode that I have ever seen!!! =) When the Ingalls family is blessed with a baby boy named Charles Ingalls Jr. after his father, young Laura is the only one who doesn't share in the joy. She is worried that this child will ultimately rob her of her father's love. She refuses to pray for the baby when he gets sick, and she stays away from him as often as possible. When the unhealthy infant dies, Laura runs away to the mountains with the belief that the baby's death is her fault. Atop a high mountain, she encounters a strange old man named Jonathan. Jonathan is undoubtedly a kind and loving soul, but it is primarily his incredible faith in Jesus that attracts Laura. Meanwhile, Laura's Pa and a family friend named Mr. Edwards go on a frantic search for her. Over the course of the movie, both Laura and her father learn some immense lessons on unconditional love and forgiveness. Melissa Gilbert is wonderful as the heartwarming Laura Ingalls, and Michael Landon makes Charles ""Pa"" Ingalls an altogether unforgettable character. Superb acting intertwined with a beautiful story on faith, love, and courage make this a wonderful movie for all ages. It's a great addition to the ""Little House"" collection. Buy it now! =)",1009411200,5,1299,4.726872246696035
698423,5,6303625827,I like this video because of it's family values it has. The sence of family unity. I just love shows that are wholesome and that I can watch with my children. And Little House has that. They don't have any bad words or naughty senes in it. And still it lasts through time. That proves that wholesome entertainment lasts the test of time and people truely like that best.,1007510400,2,370,4.3768115942028984
698424,4,6303625827,"In this classic two-hour episode, the Ingalls family eagerly awaits the arrival of a new addition! All is bliss (despite Harriet Oleson's ability to turn even a new baby into an opportunity to insult Caroline) until Dr. Baker notices that Charles Ingalls Junior, the long-awaited son, is not gaining weight. Ma asks the girls to say a special prayer for their brother, but a jealous Laura refuses. The baby's condition worsens and he eventually dies, leaving Laura with overwhelming feelings of guilt for her ""mean thoughts."" Convinced that she can make it right by giving her life to God in exchange for the infant's, Laura runs away to the mountains. As Charles and Isaiah Edwards search frantically for Laura, a mysterious old man named Jonathan (Ernest Borgnine) cares for her. The finale is heart-warming, if predictable, and vaults ""The Lord is My Shepherd"" to the rank of Classic Little House.",998611200,7,900,5.006666666666667
698425,5,6303625827,This episode of little House On The Prairie is one of the best i have ever seen. When i was growing up this was one of my favorite shows and i am proud to say it still is. I have bought this episode along with the rest in  hopes that one day when i have children they can appreciate this show as  much as i do. Not to mention Laura Ingalls and i share the same  name.

The sincerity in their apology was evident.  I received it very quickly, within 2-3 days, unlike most outside vendors that can take over a week.  This is a special season.  Burl Ives and Johnny Crawford are guests.  And the episodes are great.  I will orde again from this vendor and was very satisfied with the service.",1371340800,,476,4.453488372093023

698585,5,6303625827,"My purchase of Little House on the Prarie Seasons 1 to 3 on DVD made for great viewing, considering the show is over 30 years old the video transfer was very good on the DVDs. I have really

enjoyed watching how the Ingalls Family lived in Pioneer days with my youger cousins and my own family. I highly recommend these DVDs.",1112054400,,325,4.327868852459017
698666,4,6303625827,"This show didn't interest me when it originally aired but my wife convinced me to buy the DVDs and watch them with her and now I really enjoy it. In fact, we've bought every season that has been released and I've even started reading the books.

My one complaint isn't with the series itself but with the DVD transfer, which is awful. Yes, the picture quality is mediocre, but what's really problematic is the audio. I noticed that another previous reviewer wrote that he'd like closed captioning on this because he's deaf. Well, sir (or madame), if it's any consolation to you, the rest of us aren't able to understand much more of what's said than you are, and that only when the volume is cranked up loud enough to wake Laura Ingalls Wilder, who I understand is deceased and buried several states away.",1111795200,,805,4.590277777777778
698667,5,6303625827,"I remember when I first saw LHOTP on DVD at Target. I heard of the show, and I know I watched some of it in syndication when I was very little, but I still didn't really know or remember much about the show. So there I was at Target, wondering whether or not I should buy this and not being sure if I would like it. I took a chance, and I really enjoyed it. That first season box set, especially the first episode, had a special feel to it when I watched it for the first time. It is such a wonderful show. It has substance to it and you don't find that in very many shows. It is about a family who has a strong faith in the Lord and a deep love for not only each other, but for their fellow man. It is this faith and love that gives them the strength to endure every trial and tribulation that they will face. This show will help you to escape to a simpler time. In this day and age, it is like a breath of fresh air. I now own the first six seasons and it keeps getting better unlike other shows. Lastly, Michael Landon was the heart of this show. LHOTP wouldn't have been what it was if it weren't for him. I liked him on Bonanza, but this is where you get to see how talented he really was. He wrote and directed many episodes. I've never seen his other series Highway to Heaven (or I may have when I was very little), but I will say that we are blessed to have had him in the entertainment industry. He left such a legacy. I am glad we have a wonderful show like this, and that we had it for nine seasons.",1108166400,2,1510,3.9218241042345277
698668,5,6303625827,"What I love about these first 3 DVD sets is the uncut footage that wasn't shown on TV.  This is great for diehard fans.  Also the sound and picture quality are pretty good.  Unfortunately, seasons 4 and beyond seem to be rushed to DVD and have little uncut footage (very little in season 4, none in 5 and beyond) and there are quite a few abruptly cut scenes.  Yet as a devoted fan of the series, I will be the proud owner of all 9 seasons when they are all out on DVD.",1106179200,5,469,4.010752688172043
698669,5,6303625827,"I didn't think that the quality of the dvds was as bad as some of the reviewers are saying granted it wasn't great but I'm sure some of the problems just weren't able to be fixed.  I am glad that I will finally be able to own every episode on dvd so that when I have kids they can enjoy it too.  Buying it this way was also cheaper than buying them individually by like 40 bucks so it is money well spent if you like the show.  I can't wait for all the seasons to come out the next one is season 7 which comes out on February 15, 2005.  Don't forget to pick up the Pilot Episode it is not included with the season 1 set.",1099267200,7,620,3.8203125

Some have written about the quality etc. It's not true. Considering this series is over 30 years old the condition is better than I would have expected.

I enjoyed it as it was. I would not hesitate buying more DVDs from this series.",1098316800,14,353,4.253731343283582

Not that we are experts, but none of us have noticed any problems with the cinematography as previously mentioned.  It is great to see the example of a family that is NOT disfunctional -- it is something we need more of.  I find these shows vastly superior to the majority of shows currently on TV and I highly recommend them.",1095724800,14,419,4.402597402597403
698672,1,6303625827,"What was this studio thinking?  The digital transfer quality on Seasons 1 & 2 is good overall.  However, Season 3 is another story.  It stinks!  Many of the episodes are bleached (color-wise) and blurred.  Looks like they confiscated some used video-tapes and did a transfer using a consumer-end VCR with no digital enhancement other than adding chapters (one thing that was nicer than Seasons 1 & 2).  And even the transition on some chapters is noticeablely chopped (almost like some one stopped the playback while still recording).  My guess is that the studio's greed set in and they decided to accelerate the production timeline for Season 3 and get these out on the market at the sacrifice of quality so they bring in those $$$ faster.  For such a wonderful series as this is, it is a crying shame to see such a low quality transfer to DVD as Season 3 is.  I purchased Seasons 4 & 5 which I have not yet viewed.  Hopefully they are not as pitiful quality as Season 3.",1091145600,9,973,4.540229885057471

7852370,5,6303625827,"Little House on the Prairie - Seasons 1-3

The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience.

These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her life savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was the highest rated series during most of its nine years.
