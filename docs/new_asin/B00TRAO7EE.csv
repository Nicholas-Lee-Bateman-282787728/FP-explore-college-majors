It is still one of my favorite of all of the Divine Miss Midlers movies I don't buy many of Criterion's Blu rays but with this I will make the exception just ordered it can't wait for it to arrive",1428624000,2,594,4.0
7020739,5,B00TRAO7EE,"I received Mt Blu-Ray copy of the Rose.
When it came out.
And I have to say.
First  of all having had Fox's disappointing 2003 DVD release
This BD release from Criterion Knock's Fox's  2003 DVD out of the park.
There are three new interviews on this disc.
Along with two commentaries.
The picture is excellent. Retaining a nice film grain structure.
Something that any movie fan should appreciate.
And the DTS HD master Audio is also excellent
Also packaging is very nice too. Good sturdy case with nice cover art.
And a Beautiful Booklet inside
Well done Criterion.!!!!
the Rose finally done right on Ray",1426896000,3,605,4.69811320754717
7020740,5,B00TRAO7EE,I know every line.  Watching THE ROSE is always like visiting an old friend.,1426118400,9,76,4.428571428571429
7020741,5,B00TRAO7EE,"By 1979, fans of 'The Divine Miss M' thought that, as a performer, Bette Midler could do anything, sing anything, BE anyone. She'd more than proven herself onstage in her live concert extravaganzas, and wowed us with her TV appearances and vinyl offerings.  She could be raucous, outrageous, heartbreaking, bawdy, sing her heart out with an inimitable belting style, or croon with sweet seductiveness, so when word got out that she would be making her film debut playing a fictionalized Janis Joplin-esque character, frankly, we expected the moon.....with the stars thrown in for good measure!

Of course, until the actual release of 'THE ROSE', even her most ardent fans didn't know for sure if this larger-than-life stage performer would be accepted in such a dramatic role and be able to carry a major film on her tiny shoulders--even though those shoulders were strong enough to carry the weight from her legendary 'over the shoulder boulder holders'.  Sure, beginning in the early 1970's she'd managed to introduce the pre-Disco pop music world to gems from the 1940's, quirky torch songs, art-house rock songs, many with gay/camp sensibilities, but could she also bring depth, vulnerability and believability portraying a ballsy blues-rocker on the big screen?  We were hoping......waiting.

I was still in college when 'THE ROSE' opened in November, 1979, and a friend and I took a chance and actually got tickets to attend the premiere at the Century City theater in Los Angeles.  The movie's NYC premiere, with Midler in attendance, had been the evening before L.A.'s, and reviews were mixed but favorable.....especially for Bette.  At the L.A. premiere we stood in the theater lobby as the VIP's arrived, and when Midler finally walked in on the arm of her then-beau, Peter Riegert, she was a dazzling sight for sure--peroxided to within an inch of her life, and dressed all in white in a shimmery satin gown and fur stole worthy of Miss Monroe herself.  Up to that moment, I'd only seen her on the small screen, and everyone appears bigger--larger-than-life--in a film version somehow.  Here, just a few feet away, she was beautiful, but so tiny.......fragile almost, and she seemed thoroughly weary from all the exposure.  Of course she smiled for the cameras, but it may have been the first time I truly considered how much of a toll fame, notoriety and massive expectations must take on an artist.

As we sat in the audience that evening, we were treated to a wondrous film on many levels--from the acting by a topnotch cast, to the wrenching drama of the story, to the full-on, gutsy musical sequences--with much credit due director Mark Rydell.  But as I watched, I couldn't shake the feeling I had witnessing Bette's arrival at the theater earlier in the evening, and wondering what must have been going through her mind, waiting for the critics and 'the suits' to render their verdicts.

Quite honestly, as good as the film seemed to us that night, looking at it some 35 years later my appreciation for Midler's performance has grown immensely.  No more wondering, no more comparisons.  She IS a massive talent, and she's proven it again and again.  I'm left considering who of this current crop of pop 'Divas' could even come CLOSE to delivering a performance as soul-stirring as Miss M's?  And now, FINALLY, Criterion gives us the opportunity to see the film again in this beautifully restored and re-mastered version that does 'THE ROSE' (and, of course BETTE) justice!  I can't wait to put in the Blu-ray, sit back, and watch and listen to the powerful story and dynamic music all over again!",1425686400,35,3614,4.935643564356436
7020742,5,B00TRAO7EE,"Even though it clocks in at two hours and fifteen minutes, I wish ""The Rose"" went on longer with the complete musical numbers that appear on the soundtrack album. The story and acting are great in themselves, but when Bette gets onstage as Rose, it's electric! It's almost easy to forget she's playing a fictional character (though based on Joplin), Midler's performance is so committed and raw. You can see she's giving everything she's got.

So many great scenes in this from Rose being humiliated by the hillbillies to the rousing performance at the gay bar (look for the late Sylvester as Diana Ross and late Michael Greer as the MC/Baby Jane Hudson) and Rose's homecoming in the dive bar where she got her start. Alan Bates' performance as the driving, unsympathetic manager will make you despise him and Frederic Forrest is likeable as the chauffeur/AWOL Army Sergeant who enters Rose's life just when she needed it most.

An awesome film that still holds up and FINALLY receiving the Blu-Ray treatment it deserves. Some nice bonuses too although what I REALLY would have loved to see is deleted extended footage of the concert scenes!

FIVE STARS.",1425427200,28,1154,4.877551020408164
7020743,5,B00TRAO7EE,"I love this movie. Bette Midler's performance was flawless and Frederic Forrest did a fantastic job as her chauffer and lover in this movie.  Harry Dean Stanton was very good as a country singer.  Alan Bates was phenomenal as her manager and David Keith was just a baby in this movie.  The Rose made me a Bette Midler fan.

It's a rockin' movie with a deep soul that cuts to the bone and I think any true movie buff would be remiss to not watch this film over and over again.",1492646400,,364,4.367647058823529

7020753,4,B00TRAO7EE,I liked the movie a lot. Very good Rock N Roll film. Some of the scenes and music performances drag on too long. The film feels too long at 135 minutes.  The music isn't too bad for being the 1970s. I'd say the music is more upbeat and faster than you would think. Bette Midler gives Sid and Nancy a run for their money.  I got this movie ordered at the library and am glad I did. I just liked the cover and the fact it had something to do with Rock N Roll.  Highly recommended if you like good Seventies films or music films.,1479600000,,526,3.9904761904761905

7020762,3,B00TRAO7EE,"The Rose, 1979 film

This drama was inspired by the life of Janis Joplin, whose career was cut short by liquor and drugs (like other show business performers). She seemed more like a screamer than a singer, but some liked her. The use of drugs and whiskey are a lethal combination especially when self-administered. She traded in all her tomorrows for just one yesterday. They show an argument because of her schedule, she cant take time out. Not having regular hours can interfere with sleep patterns, then its pills and stimulants to compensate. The other danger is just being on tour. Hank Williams, Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, Eddie Cochrane, Otis Redding and others died on tour. Then there are the irregular meals. How many popular singers are still on tour (or popular) after they pass forty? The drop in popularity led to a longer life for Jerry Lee Lewis and others.

I don't know how accurate this story is, drama is needed for an entertaining popular movie. Some singers are popular because they speak for what many feel but cant express. But there can be a danger in that. Barry McGuire sang The Eve of Destruction and saw his career stifled by an Establishment who didn't appreciate the lyrics. In an earlier age Joe Hill paid a heavy price for his parodies of popular songs. The career of Chuck Berry was also squelched. Or popular tastes change; the Beach Boys were eclipsed by The Beatles and other bands (who had a new sound for a fickle public). Some popular singers from the late 1960s are still played on classic rock stations. Just enjoy this story about a singer who burned out before her time.

Drugs, sex, and rock and roll are not a formula for a healthy life; theres always a price tag. Can the problems of being a popular singer be avoided? Only in so far as their work resembles a regular job. Touring is necessary to sell records or albums to fans who want a souvenir of their attendance at a performance. When sales increase others will follow, like peer pressure from advertising. The scenes tell about the business of popular singing. Is it still that way? Would you want a relative or friend to live that kind of life? Burning the candle at both ends? You could point to Hendrix or Morrison as examples. Know of more recent examples? Rose and her driver have trouble at a diner. We don't serve hippies here. I never eat them.

The late 1960s showed political conflicts that didn't occur in earlier decades (as far as I know). Rose seems to be searching for popular approval of fame. Is this a wise choice? If you do the right thing you shouldnt worry about popular approval since many people will criticize you no matter what. The basic measure is still the bottom line, however measured. Is it better to be rich or famous? You may not be able to have both (or either). At times the movie runs on too long. Roses promoter finally decides he had enough of her misconduct and fires her; she is quite upset by this rejection. Rose decides to go to Mexico, they visit a bar. The ending shows Rose performing before a huge audience. Then she collapses on stage! Its lights out for her.

This movie has a lesson about the personality defects of a popular singer. What will you learn from it?",1464825600,,3218,4.570190641247834

7020796,5,B00TRAO7EE,"The Criterion Collection Blu-Ray transfer has a wonderfully textured quality that preserves its filmic look while showcasing its vibrant colors, especially during the concert scenes.

There is an audio commentary by director Mark Rydell that was recorded in 2003. He covers a variety of topics including casting of not just the actors but the band that backs Midlers character throughout the film. The director talks about the changes made to the screenplay when it no longer was about Joplin and recalls the logistics of shooting the concert sequences.

There is a wonderfully candid interview with Bette Midler who doesnt shy away from voicing her opinions about the shortcomings of early drafts of the script or how she didn't care for Paul Rothschilds rehearsal methods. She also recalls working with Rydell and the cast, including her backing band.

Rydell is also interviewed and discusses how he got involved in the project as well as getting Midler on board while also dealing with her difficult manager. Some of the material covered on his commentary track is repeated, including the challenges of shooting the concert scenes in front of 6,000 people.

Cinematographers John Bailey and Vilmos Zsigmond, the latter of which worked on The Rose, talks about Midlers performance as well as delving into technical aspects, like the lighting that was used, the color scheme that was adopted and the composition of specific scenes.

There is an excerpt from NBCs Today show that featured Tom Brokaw interviewing Midler and Rydell during filming.

Finally, there is a 1979 interview with Midler by film critic Gene Shalit. She talks about her character and is her usual charming self.",1434585600,6,1685,5.153846153846154

8702906,5,B00TRAO7EE,"My experience with ordering Blu-Ray editions of older movies has been mixed. Most movies older than 20 years don't really look all that different in HD than on traditional DVD. ""The Rose"", however, is one of the rare exceptions to that rule. I was stunned by the HD quality of this Blu-Ray edition. The difference between this and my DVD copy (which I've watched about 20 times in the last 10 years since I bought it) is like night and day. Both picture and sound are crisper, cleaner and sharper. This film looks and sounds as if it was just released last year. It was well worth the extra bucks, and, of course, Bette Midler's performance is simply amazing. This is a definite must-have for any movie lover's collection!",1504915200,2,722,4.604651162790698
