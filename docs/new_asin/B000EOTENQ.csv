2525984,5,B000EOTENQ,"The Story of 1 is a terrific hybrid of history and mathematical concepts.  While both my wife and I are educators, my field is history and hers is math, and we both feel that this entertaining documentary would work exceptionally for middle-school students right on through college age, and in both of our respective disciplines.

Terry Jones, enjoyable as always, traces the number one through its pre-historic beginnings to its current applications in computer binary code and reveals how numbers and concepts transformed civilizations in the time between.  Matters presented include the progress of one with other numbers and how civilizations were allowed to grow as a result; the inefficiency of Roman numerals over Arabic (Indian!) numerals and the latter's capitalist conquest; and finally with Leibniz's assertion that only one and zero are necessary for any mathematical problem.  Also, most interestingly, he shows the Australian aboriginal culture whose native counting system never moved beyond the number one.  He does this, of course, in his usual humorous way with the assistance of modern experts and actors in period clothing.  He also travels to many of the sites to show first-hand the evidence for that which he is explaining.

Mr. Jones, like me, is clearly not an expert in mathematical concepts - he is more comfortable with the historical details - but the viewer learns alongside him in clearly illustrated sequences where imaginative animations have been added for good measure.  Likewise, it offers an historical appreciation and understanding for those who are more numerically minded - like my wife - for the mathematical systems we often take for granted.

It is highly informative and short enough to be easily utilized in the classroom setting.",1201132800,23,1776,5.2695035460992905
2525985,5,B000EOTENQ,This is a funny and very informative DVD.  I had seen The Story of One on PBS and sought out the DVD.  The Story of One is sort of the Monty Python version of math history.,1170892800,6,172,3.75
2525986,5,B000EOTENQ,"I saw this program on a PBS station and loved it! As a college professor teaching in a basic skills 'Learning Community' of Math and Reading, I found this DVD gave students a framework to understand and see the progression of the very concepts they were using in basic math classes.  Much class discussion ensued because of the humor and the presentation provided.  I agree with another reviewer.  This program is effective for students from grades 6 up to and including college.  What a fun way to learn! I purchased my own DVD but also ordered a copy for our college library.",1162166400,54,577,4.627450980392157
2525987,5,B000EOTENQ,I loved this program. I just finished college and can say it would be great in any classroom-any age. It has humor as well as great facts. I can definetely see this being used for math or history. My friend-who hates non-fiction programing wouldn't take her eyes off of the television! Great Program!!!,1146182400,5,302,4.716981132075472
2525988,5,B000EOTENQ,I watched this when it was shown on PBS one night.  It is a fantastic blend of humor and math history.  Being a math teacher I immediately found myself figuring out how to work this movie into my lesson plans. Any one that has an appreciation for math and history will love this film.,1146182400,41,284,4.2407407407407405

2526007,5,B000EOTENQ,Kids enjoyed this video just as much as adults.  Very good intro to history of numbers & very supportive of the Montessori 5th Great Lesson - will be using to supplement at school.,1356825600,,180,4.454545454545454
2526008,2,B000EOTENQ,"While this documentary has great educational value and could probably hold the attention of a high school class it has one crippling flaw that is a deal breaker. There is a fleeting shot of a topless African native. While this is done tastefully, similarly to a Nat Geo documentary, the political realities of education make this incredibly problematic as some parents are sensitive to the very idea and would label it as a teacher showing ""pornography.""",1354665600,6,454,4.9868421052631575
2526019,5,B000EOTENQ,"This is a very entertaining story of numbers, from their humble beginnings to how we use them today.  It is very informative and I have used it in my classroom (6th-8th grades).  It always gets them interested in binary!",1353974400,,220,4.615384615384615
2526020,4,B000EOTENQ,"This DVD provides an informative and entertaining way of teaching the history of math.  I just don't understand why the view of the topless native woman was included.  Yes, it is culturally appropirate.  Still, this scene could have been eliminated and the story would have been just as complete.  As it is, I'm still in the process of trying to get this approved for viewing at my highschool.",1352678400,4,393,4.735294117647059
2526021,1,B000EOTENQ,"First, there wasn't that much information in this that we didn't already know.  Second, the animations (numbers dancing around) and humor seemed juvenile.  There are references to evolution, a quick shot of a topless female (the kind you might have seen in a Nat'l Geo magazine growing up)- which some audiences might not like. I think if you are interested in this I would rent instead of purchase.  Check to see if it is at the library-- but even then, I'd suggest doing something else with your time.",1350432000,4,503,4.693181818181818
2526022,5,B000EOTENQ,"For a math video, actually for any type of video, I rate this with an A+. My students were engaged by the explanations. They got a liberal dose of history, along with the math explanations. Often, they found out how words were derived. Plus, it is funny, and the really witty student hears and understands the word play.

This would be perfect for a math teacher's emergency sub plan. Make questions to go with the video. Leave a copy of the video and copies of the questions. Then, on that day when you you are so sick that you can't pull  your head off of your pillow, you have plans!",1334793600,3,586,4.318181818181818
2526023,5,B000EOTENQ,"The Story of ONE is a fascinating exploration of how civilizations figured out how to represent quantities with symbols.  With entertaining dramatizations and wry insights, Terry Jones explains how our present numerical system evolved.

How did the Egyptians build their pyramids?  They came up with their own measuring stick and issued one to each laborer.  Why is it our ""Arabic"" numbers that, in fact, came from India replaced Roman numerals?  Why was there resistance to these Arabic numbers that were clearly superior?  Terry Jones delves into history and makes math come ALIVE.

Too often math is presented in the most mundane way in our schools.  It is time to reverse this approach (too often focused on drill and kill) and intrigue children with the beauty and history of math.  Our goal should be to instill in all children a love of numbers and fascination with math.  The Story of One will do that.

As a children's math book writer, I highly recommended The Story of One!  This DVD is my gift to nieces and nephews this Christmas.

2526025,2,B000EOTENQ,"This dvd was more elementary than I thought it was going to be.  Good for maybe elementary or middle school students, but not high school.",1275350400,10,138,4.52
2526026,5,B000EOTENQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Story of One--it is intelligent, informative, witty and well, fun. I had to laugh at the rather negative review citing Jones' failure to talk about the exclusion of Mayan numbering systems and then made an error in saying Jones didn't mention who ""invented"" zero. He did--and it was quite funny. It makes me think that the reviewer didn't watch the video, at all.

My 11 year old son loved The Story of One and took it to school where the math teacher has shown it numerous times--we have just purchased one for the classroom. It isn't meant to be used to help pass college exams, those of you who are looking for such--it's meant to be just what it is--fun and a tease to those who want to find out more.",1267920000,7,730,4.407407407407407

2526039,3,B000EOTENQ,"Excellent, enjoyable story of ONE.
The only item that disappointed me was that it is not close captioned, which is important to me and is somewhat unfathomable to me why and educational product would not be.  So for content I rate it as a 5, but because of not captioning, I rate it as a 3.",1239408000,9,290,4.178571428571429

2526041,3,B000EOTENQ,"I came across with this DVD when I was searching resources for more spiritual information. The title seemed interesting as the ""1"" ment to me the single source of all visdom. But when I read the reviews, I realized that it was really about the story of the ""1"" we know as a number. No second meaning. But still I ordered the dvd as I am also highly interested in science history. After watching the dvd, my first thoughts are as follows:
1. Producers wanted give information in an entertaining way. But to my taste, the ""entertaining"" part was pushed a bit too much.
2. The language of the dvd is quite simple and easy to follow word by word but if you want to grasp the overall meaning, it's difficult to grasp. i.e. too many things are said and you can hear them but in the end, you find difficult to summarize what you have learned.
3. In the dvd, when they mentioned about ""1"" in fact, I think they ment ""unit"". Which I believe different than each other. Maybe this is the source of confusion I wanted to explain in item 2 of my review.
4. In the dvd, there is an attempt to track the history of numbers from different parts of the world, rather than sticking to western resources only. And I appreciate that. But given that the dvd is only 60 min long, it's inevitable that other possible resources of ""1"" are just touched, rather than analysed.
5. The animations in the dvd are not contributing to better understanding of the subject, but rather diluting the seriousness of the study.
As a result, it's an entertaining dvd in which you can find some interesting pieces of information to contribute to your general knowledge. A bit of a luxury I would say.",1235347200,7,1661,4.431372549019608
2526042,3,B000EOTENQ,"As a middle school teacher, I purchased this DVD with the intentions of showing it to supplement my lessons during what I call ""Math Week"".

Overall I believe that the film has merits in that it has comical overtones, is generally fast paced, and offers interesting math history. Educators should be forewarned that one early scene displays a topless Aborigine.

I did find it curious that the ancient Hebrew Civilization and their use of numbers is totally ignored. For example In Hebrew, there is a correlation between the symbols for numbers and the ones for letters. To begin with, the first letter, Aleph, has the value 1. The next letter, Bet, has the value 2, and so on up to Yud=10. After that, each letter is an increment of ten, so that Kaf=20 and so on, until Qof (usually pronounced like ""cough"")=100. The last three letters increase in value by 100, so Resh = 200, Shin = 300, and Tav = 400.

To ignore this important historical is in my opinion very bias. I recommend a thorough reading of Numbers; written by Moses nearly 3400 years ago.

I still am happy with my acquisition as it is difficult to find compelling math visuals. I also recommend some of the Charles and Ray Eames films.",1230768000,9,1200,4.593457943925234
2526043,1,B000EOTENQ,"i owe an oppology for the producers, there is nothing wrong with that DVD from information wise or presntation, it's just the expecation was high and the delivery was quite basic barely suitable for kids or any body who did not hear about the number system.
but then all that can be gained for free from the wikipedia.
the rating stays the same, and my opinion is the same, this DVD is worthless for any body beyond KG or at most the primay school.",1228521600,3,448,4.345238095238095
2526044,5,B000EOTENQ,"The Story of 1 is an awesome video.  I got it for my wife who is a math teacher to show in class.

2526045,5,B000EOTENQ,"Besides The Film ""Stand and Deliver"" there are very few films that can be used in a Math Classroom with any chance of being useful. This however is a HUGE EXCEPTION to the rule. Mr. Jones is to be commended for taking a subject that could be seen as boring by most students and making it fun & interesting for the majority of my students. Thanks!!!!",1214006400,4,349,4.303030303030303
2526046,4,B000EOTENQ,"This was a really fun documentary to watch, regardless of how elementary it was overall.  However, the documentary is only about an hour long so you can't really recount the history of civilization (which goes with math) in that short period of time.  This documentary does give the viewer a clearly defined impression that the number one is far more complex in history than most people might have thought.  Granted there are assuredly more numbers than just one, the friends 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do make a cameo appearance every now and again, but as the DVD points out... they're all made up of units of one when broken down!  That is until the rise of zero comes into play.

Math and history are probably two of my most favored subjects and I've been getting into documentaries as of late, so to combine the two in one setting was a great find!  All this and to top it off with having it narrated by Terry Jones from Monty Python fame.  With that kind of a narrator I was expecting a fair degree of silliness throughout the documentary.  Granted it's not nearly as off the wall as we get in Monty Python skits (unfortunately there are no silly walks), but it did have its humorous moments.  I suppose the concept derived from the fact that most people find math boring or cumbersome so they wanted to lighten the mood.  Most of this silliness is generated via computer graphics with representations of numbers getting into mischief and so forth.  Terry Jones certainly has his witty quips thrown in to make it entertaining as well.  I must reference what he said the Egyptians liked to do for those who have seen this already.

This documentary goes over how essential mathematics was for building civilization even in ancient times dating back to Sumer.  It goes over some of the most major breakthroughs in mathematics in history and how those affected the world we know today.  One part I found particularly fascinating was when they were going over the Roman system and how cumbersome it was to use to make even some of the most simplistic calculations, especially if you wanted to deal with large numbers!  The effects would hamper the rise of Europe's civilization for generations until the numerals from India were eventually introduced via the Arab nations who refined them a little.  Eventually the documentary brings us into the digital and goes over binary, don't worry you don't really have to know how to read the binary system to really get what's going on at the end.

If you did pick this up to show to a class then I'm sort of torn on this topic.  Some of the information is probably too complex for younger students, but also might be too silly for those in high school.  Lets admit it, not all high school students find mathematics all that riveting and to see dancing numbers on the screen just might not grab their interest.  A junior high level class may be more acceptable, but still there might be some subjects touched upon that few will truly grasp and understand, depending on their schooling level at that age.  Just some thoughts for teachers who may decide to purchase this.

Amidst all this it really is an excellent brief overview.  So if you have a general interest in history and you want to see how math really made our civilization possible then this is definitely something worth watching.  On the flip side if you're into math and you want to see how math influenced society and civilization in history then this is also a must see!  If you already have a decent handle on both subjects don't plan on finding any new information here, because this really is a brief overview, kind of plants the seeds of curiosity for more in depth research, if you will.  However brief this is, it is fun to watch and even if you know the history and have a decent math background like myself, then I have to say I spent an hour being entertained by subjects I already love with a very smart script to pull it all together.",1213747200,12,3954,4.555869872701556

8112398,4,B000EOTENQ,"This is really a history of arithmetic. Relates how counting started with Sumerians, went west to Egypt, absorbed by the Greeks, used by the Romans, improved in India, refined by Moslems, borrowed by the Italians, changed to binary by Leibniz and rules today's computers.

Terry Jones makes his usual effort to add humor and human interest. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of history is included. I enjoyed the connection between counting and culture. Sumerian need to organize cities. Egyptian goal to collect taxes. Greek desire for an abstract understanding of the cosmos. Roman will to conquer. Indian interest in infinite. Moslem addition of algebra. Italian focus on business. Leibniz desire for new language. This background provides insight that numbers are a international - really a supranational - effort. Each group added something vital.

Demonstrates several contrasts. One was the difference between using abacus and calculating on paper. About the same duration, but abacus was not as precise. Therefore, business went with paper. However, explains that it was outlawed for a while, since it seemed 'weird'. Excellent explanation of the superiority of Indian numbers over Roman numerals. Outstanding presentation of how binary math works. Easy to follow.

I did not know that the Indians had measured the size of the earth correctly, before the Greeks. Shows the place in India where this was done. Facinating!

Spends some time on the introduction of the numeral ""0"". Shows how this Indian invention is a key to modern mathematics. Records the invention of the cubit in Egypt and how important a standard ""ruler"" was for thier building projects. Much more detail than seems at first viewing. The reinactments of history with period clothes and buildings, etc. provides the sense of time. This also adds interest and learning.

Easy to follow. I plan to rewatch with my grandson and to catch more detail in the future.
