8391286,3,B0038FBTK4,"These narrated stories, part of the ""Stories To Remember"" series on DVD, advertise themselves as ""Fully Animated"" on the covers, but they're actually iconographic (still pictures with intermittent animation).  That said, these stories are perfectly acceptable, and faithful adaptions of both ""Pegasus: The Flying Horse"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The stories are narrated by Mia Farrow, who is somewhat limited as a storyteller, bringing little characterization to the reading, but speaking in a fine clear voice. The animation for the two stories appear to be by two different animation studios, with ""Pegasus"" looking like poor-quality Japanese Anime, and ""Beauty and the Beast"" from an Eastern European tradition.  Along with each 25-minute-long story, there is an additional featurette for each program, ""What Is A Good Story"" which features extended clips of each story and educational analysis.  These programs will have appeal to younger audiences, but the poor animation quality limits their value.",1291075200,2,1008,5.6118421052631575
