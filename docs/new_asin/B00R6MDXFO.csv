8694300,5,B00R6MDXFO,"Umbria, Italy. The year 1401. A woman peers out of her window. She feels great anxiety in her heart and disquiet in her soul. Something is wrong, very wrong. Her husband hasn't returned home and it is getting late. What has happened to him?

This ominous scene opens this excellent documentary on the life of Margarita Lotti Mancini, who would later come to be revered as the Saint of the Impossible and desperate cases, St. Rita of Cascia. This documentary leaves no stone unturned to bring about the most authentic retelling of her life . It goes to great lengths to separate the facts from the legends that have sprung up in the life of this great Saint; it gives the viewer and in depth look at every aspect that was and is associated with her life.

This documentary is divided in to several sections and sub-sections based on content and not on chapter/scene selections, which this DVD doesn't have.

1. Roccaporena 1371.
- The birth and early life of Margarita.
- The town of Cascia: Its strategic, economic, historic and spiritual importance.
- Roccaporena: Its per-Christian history and legends.
- The 'Miracle of the bees': its symbolism.

2. Marriage of Margarita Lotti to Paolo Mancini
- Nature and true character of the latter.
- The wedding site (especially interesting as the church still survives and contains a very precious relic!)
- her home, daily activities, family life and her character as a mother and wife.
- detailed dissection of the legends that grew around her.

3. The  history and politics of the time.
- The passing of Paolo Mancini and the circumstances surrounding his death.
- Prudence and maternal solicitude of Margarita to her children.
- Her Christian attitude in her dealings with everyone.

4. Entering the Convent and Conventual life.
- Obstacles and divine intervention.
- From Margarita Mancini to Sister Rita.
- Obedience, prayer life, mystical experiences and union with the crucified Christ.
-  Mortifications and humiliations.
5. May 22nd 1447 - Death: Signs and Miracles
6. July 16th 1628 - Beatification process
7. May 24th 1900 - Canonization

As can be deduced, this is indeed a very detailed documentary on the life of this Saint, brimming over with information and I have refrained as much as possible from revealing too much and still provide a fair overview of what to expect. It is so exhaustive that the viewer will indeed learn A LOT!
This show also successfully tries to be a visual pilgrimage by taking the viewer to the places frequented by our saint. What is amazing is that we get up close and personal with Saint Rita of Cascia as we are shown many pictures of her incorrupt body as well as her beautiful shrine basilica.

Lending their expertise and knowledge to this documentary are Mario Polia (Anthropologist), Fr. Alipio Vincenti ( Augustinian Convent of Cascia) and Fiorella Giacolane (Anthropologist, University of Perugia). Coupled with dramatic recreations, this makes for a fascinating feature presentation on this remarkable woman and will not disappoint. Devotees of St. Rita will find this film particularly edifying as they would learn many facts that have been little known.

After watching this one can add another title to St. Rita, and that is Patron of Vocations, for she lived her vocation, as daughter, wife, mother and religious with utter dedication to the will of God. Therefore every person will be able to relate to this great Saint in some way.

One caveat though. This film was made in Italy and though for most part the English is perfect, the word veneration ( as in 'veneration of St. Rita) is substituted for worship. Worship is given to God alone. This point has to be made very clear.

This documentary is one hour long in English. Interviews with the experts are in Italian with English Subtitles. There are no special features on this disc.",1421712000,10,3841,4.881720430107527
