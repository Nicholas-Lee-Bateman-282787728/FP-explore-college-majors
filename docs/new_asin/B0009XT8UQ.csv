2336231,1,B0009XT8UQ,"Slow paced, dull, and unimaginative. This film features terrible acting, laughable special effects, and an absolutely dreadful script. It spends more time on the uninteresting marital problems of the two leads than on the story, and is filled with every imaginable horror-sci fi cliche, including:

1)an evil general, played in an embarassing performance by Jeff Fahey (Is work hard to find these days, Jeff?). We know he's evil because he describes himself as ""a patriot."" 2)a ""brilliant and beautiful scientist"", played by a Cameron Diaz wannabe with even more modest acting skills than Cameron, and 3)dialog we have heard in a million other dreadful films, such as, after the sharks attack two maintenance workers: Scientist #1: ""It's over"" Scientist #2 : ""No, it's just begun."" There is little action and surprisingly little gore. The real question is: How do wholly derivative and excrementally bad films like this get made? The answer is: Chumps like us rent them. Apparently even a trained monkey can make a movie today.",1143417600,,1027,5.149700598802395

2336233,3,B0009XT8UQ,"There have been so many shark thrillers since JAWS, it's easy to lose track of them.  BLUE DEMON is an entertaining take on killer sharks, buoyed by a humorous script and tongue in cheek performances.  Randall Batinkoff and DeDee Pfeiffer play estranged scientists whose Blue Demon project involves genetically engineered sharks for the purpose of protecting our coasts from invaders.  However, the sharks develop plans of their own  and that's when the bloodletting begins.  It's all been done before and better, but BLUE DEMON entertains and features a campy performance from Jeff Fahey as a general with his own agenda.  You could do worse (e.g. HAMMERHEAD).",1131235200,,661,5.188679245283019
2336234,1,B0009XT8UQ,"I'm a sucker for a good shark movie. Heck, I'm a sucker for a semi-decent shark movie. JAWS obviously set the bar pretty high, but there have been some close runners up in OPEN WATER and even DEEP BLUE SEA. So, having said that, I hope that you can understand how much it pains me to say that I couldn't find a single redeeming thing about BLUE DEMON. What's so bad about it? Well, despite the fact that the shark fins are all clearly tied on to a scuba diver's head, the main problem is that BLUE DEMON flounders around in a shallow pond known as: The un-scary, un-funny PG-13 Sci-Fi Channel horror-comedy.

I wish someone would explain the recent trend behind PG-13 horror movies that are intentionally goofy to me. Like Carmen Electra's MONSTER ISLAND or even BOA VS. PYTHON. It's as if there's a whole generation of people that were brought up on Sci-Fi Original movies and R.L. Stine books. Who is the intended audience for these things? No one over the age of ten would find these movies remotely scary, and it seems like the filmmakers know that, so they make the movies intentionally quirky and self-effacing for the thirty-somethings. But the inside jokes and the sarcasm would go right over the head of the few ten year olds that were actually watching the movie to get scared. And then, just to confuse the audience even more, they have these semi-dramatic scenes where people are crying over lost friends or trying to mend their shattered marriage. The end result is a movie that's not scary, not funny and not dramatic. It's like a stew where none of the flavors work well together.

It's impossible to critique anything individually in this latest addition to the intentionally goofy wanna-be scary movie genre - the whole thing stinks. The CG sharks, the acting, the dialog... especially the music, which sounds like it came directly from Ron Jeremy's personal collection of porn scores. In defense of the actors, they all seem to know that they're in DEEP BLUE SEA LITE, and they act appropriately. In other words, they mug for the camera, they make ridiculous faces and stomp around. The only thing missing is a few fart noises. Come to think of it, maybe they should have added some, it might have made the movie better.",1128297600,6,2238,4.663291139240506
2336235,1,B0009XT8UQ,"If you are reading this review to sort out if you might want to rent this or buy it - this may help:  DON'T!!!  It is not scary, nor is it (intentionally) funny.  The plot is boring, the acting poor, and the CGI sharks are laughably bad.  This is a simple review for a simple movie... I hope it helps...",1128124800,22,303,4.0
2336236,1,B0009XT8UQ,"I happen to have a chance to see 'Blue Demon' which has been already released in Japan on DVD.  I was not surprised ro see another film is made about sharks attacking humans -- and I was fairly entertained seeing 'Deep Blue Sea' -- but I never expected that this film could be so awful.

First, you cannot call 'Blue Demon' a thriller.  The fact is, it tries to be many things at the same time.  Though it certainly is about the deadly sharks (6 of them) that attack the hapless people in the sea, there are 'comic' elements that are not particularly funny.  Look at the 'names' of the sharks (yes, they have names), which are Grucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo, and Gummo.  Whoever thought of the idea calling killer sharks with the names of the Marx Brothers, must know that he is not making a thriller.  It's like calling a deadly shark Pee-wee or something.  And the sixth shark?  Sorry I forgot its name, being shocked to hear my favorite comedians' names.

Oh, and the story.  Some institute is doing a government-finaced research about the possibility of training sharks to be the official guards protecting the coasts of USA from the invasion of terrorists.  I'm serious.  Moreover, for the reasons you don't care, the six sharks run away from the cage, and the scientists try to stop the inevitable consequences.  Now, you know what you see in this film by producer-turned- director Daniel Grodnik.  It's not 'Jaws'; it's not even 'Deep Blue Sea.'  It's more like a clone of 'Lake Placid' with less violence and actions.

But the film's real problem is not its silly story.  It is the feeble direction that knows nothing about making thrilling scenes, doing funny spoofs, or giving us witty or at least decent dialogues.  When you see the heroine (and one of the researchers who should be very intelligent) just slips (like on banana peels) and tumbles into the sea, and the sharks swarm around her, you don't know how to react to this incredible stupidity.  You will be wondering 'Is this serious, or some joke?'

To be fair, most of the actors are not bad (and most probably they are not taking the film seriously).  The researcher team comprise Dedee Pfeiffer (Michelle's sister), Randall Batinkoff, Danny Woodburn, and Josh Hammond.  Jeff Fahey appears as pompous General holding a big cigar.

There are not enough actions either, and if there are, they are not done well, mostly thrill-less and humor-less, and have no originality.  I like watching so-called B-actions, and always try to find good things about them, but here it was very hard for me to do that.",1125187200,,2568,4.7040358744394615
2336237,5,B0009XT8UQ,"This film is a little gem. Quirky, suprising, romantic. I'm used to the shark pictures with stock footage shot on a shoestring. Blue Demon creates a world of thrills with very little blood and characters one can care about. I had fun -- the music is large and the

8069975,1,B0009XT8UQ,"Wow is this movie terrible.  Blue Demon has that noticeable and irritating made-for-TV feeling about it, and the quality of the storytelling certainly does nothing to change the viewers mind.

What had the potential to be a frightening movie involving deadly monster sharks attacking people was actually so bad it hurt.

ALL the characters acting skills were horrible, music would constantly appear at all the inappropriate moments giving off the feeling I was watching a comedy film at times, the storytelling had completely missed the mark, the sharks didn't pose as much of a threat as they should have, and did I mention the characters were horrible?  Every time they introduced someone, there was no telling if they would stick around or not.

The only part of the movie I liked was when the young daughter was going fishing with her father.  Everything else -including the terrible relationship between the two people working together that involved the woman taking the ring off her hand at one point early on- was terrible.

A very bad attempt at a shark movie.",1248134400,3,1068,4.932960893854749

8069977,1,B0009XT8UQ,"swim so slowly almost EVERYONE they attack has no problem getting away from them. The scientist warns (at the beginning and end of the film) that they did something terrible in creating these sharks. I agree. If such sharks ever bred, the world's shark population would starve, as these things were completely unable to catch anything. (If you can't catch a floundering human, how are you supposed to catch a creature adapted to swimming.)",1185408000,3,439,4.945945945945946
8069978,3,B0009XT8UQ,"I think the reviews on this film are the least representative batch I've ever seen on Amazon. ""Blue Demon"" is a tongue in cheek film about a military research program that genetically alters sharks so they fight and defeat terrorists. If you can't see the humor in that premise, something's wrong.

As you can imagine -- and, if you've been reading along, you see -- that things vary quite a bit from this premise right away. Something goes badly wrong with the sharks' computer program, they break out of their containment hatch, swim around in California waterways, eat some people, and more.

The film has no real stars; DeDee Pfeiffer, a ringer for Cameron Diaz that has appeared in ""CSI New York"", is the main charcater with Randall Batinkoff, who plays her husband and fellow researcher; ""Seinfeld"" short person star Danny Woodburn, who plays their boss; and veteran character actor Jeff Fahey, who plays the military general behind the doublecross. None of these actors enhanced their careers with this movie but I'm sure they'd all agree it was fun to make.

That's becuase it's fun to watch. I agree with the other critics that say it's inane; that's what makes it fun. And while the computer-generated sharks would never be confused with real animals...well, this is a movie, right? Did someone out there confuse this for a documentary? The sharks aren't any worse than other computer-generated fish I've seen in other recent films.

My capsule summary is this: don't go into this thinking you're going to see one of the great action-horror films of recent years. But you can expect to be entertained by a fast moving flick that has a lot of humor and whose actors participate in the tongue in cheek format right from the first scene.",1176768000,6,1744,4.822742474916388
8069979,2,B0009XT8UQ,"Okay, this was a terrible movie done on a very small budget.  The plot was stupid, the acting bad, and the special effects were anything but special.. Could easily be a movie that gets one star with a disclaimer that it only gets one star because we can't give it less.  HOWEVER...Jeff Fahey plays a ""patriotic"" American general, and he is so over the top, so into hamming it up that I think the movie is worth seeing just for his performance.  It's a bad performance, but you have to believe he knew it was bad while performing it.  You have to be pretty bored to watch this one, but hey...I made it throuh the whole thing.  Barely.",1157760000,5,633,4.330508474576271
8069980,4,B0009XT8UQ,"Okay, for those of you who HAVE seen this movie and are reading this, and even for those who haven't, let's get one thing straight right now: I am NOT giving this movie four stars based on it's artistic merits.  This movie is not great.  This movie is not good.  This movie is not even bad.  It is horrible, horrendous, and otherwise ridiculous.  So why am I giving it four stars?  Because I haven't had this much fun watching a movie since I don't know when.

First things first: the plot.  The plot is simple enough; scientists create bigger, meaner, and faster sharks that they can control so that they can stop terrorists.  Of course, this would be entirely useless unless the terrorists swam to America, but you get the point.  But wait, something's gone wrong!  The sharks have escaped!  Who ever would have thought THAT would happen?  Anyway, the sharks wreak havoc, attack people, yadda yadda yadda... but here's the thing: a grand total of five people die in this movie.  A kid at the beginning, two repair people, a surfer, and one more person who it would be a spoiler to reveal.  Five.  There are six sharks in this movie, people!  Anywho, the two main characters, a supposedley divorced couple of scientists, try to stop the sharks, warn the coast guard, etc.  There's even a mean military guy who may have insidious plans of his own (hint hint).  You may find yourself wondering like I did how they managed to strech this out for ninety minutes.

So, now that that's out of the way, lets' talk about the bad parts of this movie.  Oh boy, where to start?  The CGI is laughably bad- in fact, it's almost as bad as the abysmally bad acting (Deedee obviously didn't inherit her sister's acting abilities).  The plot is also so ridiculous as to border on the insane.  For example, in the movie, the main badguy is stopped when Deedee's character throws a life preserver on him.  Why couldn't he just lift up his arms and take it off?  Also, the shark called Red Dog is always said to be the biggest, fastest, and meanest.  So, if he's the fastest, then why is he always the last in the sequences that show all of the sharks?  However, the worst part, for me anyway, was when a couple was being attacked by the sharks, and a man comes out of nowhere with a harpoon... and kills the shark.  The camera then zooms in on his face, and he just shakes his head.  He is later described as an ""overzealous fisherman.""  Oh, and let's not forget the scene where someone is killed at the beach, and the bystanders are all pointing in different directions!  This movie is filled with little tidbits like that.  Filled.  As in, the WHOLE ENTIRE MOVIE is like that.  Oh, and by the way, I hope you're not offended by movies that make fun of little people.  'Cause that's all over the place here, too.

So, you say, what are the good things?  If you're giving this a four, it must have some redeeming qualities, right?  Well, not so much.  You see, there is one reason and one reason only why I gave this movie four out of five stars: it is, as my title suggests, hilarious.  If you're the kind of person that loves to laugh at bad movies, then you cannot live without this little treasure.  My entire family was laughing out loud the entire time; so much so that we had to pause it frequently so as not to miss upwards of five minutes of the movie (although I get the impression that I could have left halfway through and come back thirty minutes later and still known exactly what was going on).  It's just that funny.  And the sad part is, I'm pretty sure it wasn't done on purpose.  (Mind you, some of it is.  The main character references Kafka and the guard next him tells him not to swear.  Huh? Was the reaction that both we as the audience and the character had.)

Now, of course, I couldn't give this movie a five, just out of sheer principle.  But if you love laughing at bad movies, this is a must have.",1153353600,3,3909,4.39245810055866
8069981,1,B0009XT8UQ,"When I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but write down some of the more ridiculous scenes that this film's masterminds constructed. It was a long, long list.

One of my favorites was right in the beginning of the film. The two doctors in charge of a rather ridiculous and, at this stage of our scientific development, quite impossible, repeatedly refer to each other as ""ex"". Truth is, they're still married, and the still wear their rings.

Some drama is made about the wife's ring, and she runs out of the rather large science facility to a remote dock where the sharks swim to get soap so that she can get the ring off.

Now come on. In this entire science building, there isn't a single bar of soap anywhere? And it's safer for to leave said building and venture into the shark's den (even if they are, supposedly, well controlled)?

Nah.

And we know what happens. The ring falls off. She bends to pick up the ring and falls face first into the water. By some strange fortune, she finds herself floating on her back (a neat trick, considering that she was unconscious), and she's rescued by her husband - er, ex-husband, I think - and their assistant.

This example fairly well sets the tone of illogic that follows the film from beginning to end.

I only watched this because it was on cable (OnDemand), and free. And I thought it would be funny to see how absolutely horrid it was.

And I wasn't disappointed. It was horrid.

Unless you enjoy laughing at stupid movies because they're so ridiculously stupid (although I have to say that the only way you could really be laughing is if you were doing what I was doing - compiling notes to write a review), this might be for you. But I would say probably not.",1151193600,,1721,4.472843450479234
