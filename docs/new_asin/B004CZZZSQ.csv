8424546,5,B004CZZZSQ,"Nothing dull (or dated) about this brilliant adaptation of one of Murdoch''s finest novels ( way before she got long-winded), a witty perceptive look at lovers' fantasies and arrangements; while very funny, there is real psychological insight on display. You may look at yourself differently, after. The story is quite engaging (with one scene NOT in the novel) and the acting,as you'd expect from these stars, superb. Clarie Bloom alone, unforgettable  as "" the Phallic Woman"" is well worth the price of admission. One of those films, like for example ""Seconds"",  you wonder ""why isn't this better known?"" Oh, and the era technicolor is beautiful to watch.",1417219200,2,657,5.130841121495327
8424547,4,B004CZZZSQ,"[A SEVERED HEAD - (1971) - Fullscreen Presentation - Directed by Dick Clement] An odd black comedy concerning a handful of Britain's upper crust characters who play sexual musical chairs throughout the film as we witness aspects of their inner characters emerge and evaporate as they simultaneously and chronically unveil and cloak the underhanded details of what I can best call the 'trickledown effect' of the late 60's sexual revolution. Their version of this liberation is decidedly twisted and more perverse than anything the hippie revolutionaries had in mind, yet at the same time, they being well-bred Brits, are incredibly polite, civil and courteous as they backstabbed one another for the duration of the film.

Nothing exiting ever actually happens, so after thirty minutes you'll either become intrigued or fatigued by the characters and their amorous though not-quite-lewd behaviors, inviting you to either continue along with the ride to its not-altogether-predictable outcome, or shutting it down due to lack of interest entirely. The sexual revolution was a worldwide phenomenon and struck all classes of people, but not necessarily the same way, and that's what's paraded here. It's either interesting and amusing to you or it's dreadfully dull and dated. I'm in the former camp, so I enjoyed the developments and characters by the film's end. You may need to suss this aspect out for yourself before purchasing, as these Columbia Pictures Limited Edition DVD-R's aren't cheap.

As far as the cast goes, it's golden, with Lee Remick brilliantly annoying and somewhat despicable as the female lead, Ian Holm as the sublime limey who chronically gets short-sticked by all until he can take it no more, Richard Attenborough as the self-righteous, self-serving psychiatrist attempting to control everyone's behavior for his own shifty benefit, Claire Bloom as the thin-lipped, rarely-speaking and slightly menacing femme fatale, and Clive Revill and Jennie Linden as additional playthings who end up wild cards in a deck full of jokers.

Not unlike a good scotch, this one's an acquired taste; if you're not savvy to the Brits and their inherent eccentricities, especially at the tail end of the (literally) swinging 60's, you're likely to pass on this without fear of regret, but I found it amusing - well, as amusing as 'A Severed Head' can be... 4 stars for me. All else, approach with caution.",1337126400,8,2411,5.208762886597938
