I bought this series used on dvd and it is excellent, although since it is an older production, there is not much in the way of bonus features.",1527206400,,295,4.103448275862069
8459647,5,B0056I5LYG,"Cadfael is a well acted mystery series that takes place in Anglo Saxon England during the 12th Century when the country was in a civil war between King Stephen and Queen Matilda.  The storyline, costumes and scenes transport you into this rich and often violent past. And it gives the audience a sense of the church's role during the Middle Ages.  The series is worth collecting and watching.",1455580800,2,392,4.75
