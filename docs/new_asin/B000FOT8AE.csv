8125064,5,B000FOT8AE,"I am very happy with Adam Ford's Swiss Ball Upper Body DVD. I bought it along with his Basics DVD and I'm glad I did, because using them together gives me about an hour's long workout, whereas this one would just give me 10 minutes and the Basics just 30 minutes.

The Upper Body DVD has 3 10 minute workouts of increasing difficulty. I will admit that although I have had the DVD for a few months now, I still have not so much as peeked at Phases 2 and 3. I've started at the bottom in terms of arm strength and am slowly but surely working my way up. I do mean 'surely' though--I have visibly more tone and noticeably more strength in my arms. I'm waiting until I'm comfortable with Phase 1 before I go on to the more advanced phases, otherwise I might get too discouraged! :-)

The quality of the DVD is great. Ford starts with some basic warm up and then goes straight into it. The instruction is by voice-over which means that while he is actually doing the exercises, he isn't distracted by talking and can demonstrate exactly the proper form. He also does not give any annoying motivational talk, and everything he says is valuable, for the purpose of explaining the exercise, and nothing more. The camera work is also good, showing everything from different angles.

What I like most about this DVD is the pace. Sometimes when things are very difficult, instructors will go too slowly, or start talking about 'what a great job you're doing,' and in that case it gives me time to think about how much it hurts or how hard it is, and that discourages me. Here, Ford does a few reps of one exercise before immediately moving on to the next. There's no time to dwell on things, and so it keeps the motivation up, along with the heart rate.

Hopefully I'll be moving on to Phase 2 soon. I'm aiming for no shaking while doing a ball push-up, and then I can advance! Wish me luck :-)",1253145600,3,1884,4.358974358974359
8125065,3,B000FOT8AE,"The exersizes look great but I do have a problem.

I am already in shape, I ordered this to add another dynamic to my workout, these workouts are challenging enough but the problem that I found is that when doing the workouts, it felt like my exercise ball was going to burst from my weight. Now I only weigh 180 pounds. Before buying this DVD, decide whether you think a exercise ball will support you doing a one armed push up on it. (thats one of the first exercises).",1245715200,,471,4.292134831460674
8125066,5,B000FOT8AE,"He does things with the ball I would never have thought of. There is quite a bit of pushups and balancing on your hands with the ball under your feet. He uses 2 balls in exercise 2, but you can do it with one. I think it's a great workout and I hope I get results.",1204329600,,264,3.732142857142857
8125067,4,B000FOT8AE,"this dvd is very good,it has good exercises that will help you to keep a good body",1189296000,,82,3.8823529411764706
8125068,3,B000FOT8AE,"I favor stability ball exercises because they challenge core balance. The consistent reviews about this product convinced me to buy this. I haven't used this DVD yet since I scanned what's in it. After all the hype and Adam Ford'ripped abs, I'm still waiting to strengthen my core so I can do the moves in his program. It doesn't look exciting but the being on the ball keeps me hanging on to this dvd.

I am giving in 3 stars because of the pricing (at 19.95)and the instruction is a lifeless voice over. I guess he has to do voice over to focus on the work out.

8125069,4,B000FOT8AE,"I bought all 3 of Adam Ford's DVD's and was amazed at all one can do with the Swiss Ball.  I struggle each time because at 5ft 11, I think I maybe should have purchased the large ball, not the medium. I am in fairly good shape, but these videos are a real challenge for me. I sometimes have trouble doing the beginning exercises. and on the lower body one, I have the greatest challenge. Adam knows His stuff, but I wish he would take a bit more time to explain the positions. I tend to lack behind. He has a great physique, but toast has more of a personality. He is one bland dude.",1177027200,5,583,4.069565217391304
8125070,5,B000FOT8AE,"I have been using other advanced balance ball workouts for a few years now, but was humbled during Phase I, the least difficult routine.  I am now able to complete all the exercises and improve a little each time I do the workout.  Phase I will continue to challenge me just by adjusting my position on or near the ball.  I don't see how anyone could outgrow this DVD.  Adam is just amazing in Phase 2 and 3.  As with his other DVDs, I love that Adam provides form pointers but doesn't chatter endlessly throughout the routine.  I also appreciate that he doesn't count every rep.",1176508800,5,579,4.415094339622642
8125071,5,B000FOT8AE,"Once again, Adam Ford amazes me with his skills and knowledge with the swiss ball. If you purchased any of his other workout DVDs, you will not be disappointed with this volume. Once again, he breaks the workout in three levels. Trust me, start with the easiest level and work your way up to the hardest. His exercises are extremely difficult to do, but the payoff is amazing. You will gain functional strength and stabilty control like you wouldn't believe. I've been workout for years, using different modality, (e.g. bands, free weights, calisthetics, cable machines, medicine balls, BOSU, stability balls) and I thought I could manage the hardest level...NOT!!! I tried one of the harder exercises and almost fell on my face. Take my word for it, this will make a great addition to anyone's workout library and for anyone who might be bored with their current workouts and want to change things up alittle.",1173312000,7,910,4.877419354838709
