1176032,1,B00000214T,"I got to see a free preview of this garbage, and it wasn't worth it being free.  Ed Nortons friends in the movie pull off their parts well.  But this movie is horrible and uncreative.  There are direct lines and scenes taken from other Ed Norton movies, and their not done as well.  When Ed is talking to his Russian friend he tends to say ""I don't understand you, I can't talk to you"" exact words taken from American History X, they try to shock you by insulting many nationalities and groups in a few scenes, yet you don't care, nor is it believable as it is in American History X.  There's a beat me up scene at the end with Ed Norton, and this is done w/ out sound for drama, and showing the faces of his friends. Can I say Fight Club when he beats up Angel?  Yet not done well again.  I love every movie Ed Norton is in, yet the  whole movie story line was so bad that I can't care for him in this movie.  There are random scenes of New York and the Trade Center buildings, and yet Spike manages to make me not care.  The scenes are not relevant to the movie, and they don't have anything to do with the movie. Ok Spike, you show us they're gone, we've now established when the movies set, after 9/11, great, end it there.  I've never seen a Spike Lee movie, and I won't ever again.  He tried to provoke controversial images and dialogue, but he just tried to throw it in your face, not make you think about it, and he even failed at that.  Not worth a penny to see.",1042070400,5,1471,4.083623693379791
1176033,3,B00000214T,"No one can ever say that Spike Lee's films aren't at the very least interesting or at best, brilliant. ""25th Hour,"" his newest film is in the former category.
""25th Hour"" tells the story of Monty Brogan who has approx 24 hours until he must report to prison for a term of 7 years for selling drugs. We are privy to what is going on in Monty's (named after Montgomery Clift...nice touch) mind as well what is actually happening in his physical world: his relationship with his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), his father (Brian Cox) and his two close friends Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jakob (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).
""25th Hour"" was written by David Benioff; adapted from his novel. What is missing from the screenplay and the film is motivation: why does Monty sell drugs? It is obvious from where he lives and what he drives that drug dealing has been profitable for him, but why does an obviously intelligent, well-spoken man go down that particular path? Is it for the thrill, is he just lazy, does he like what the money buys? We never know for sure. As viewers we can fill in some of the gaps from the evidence presented onscreen, but there are too many gaps in ""25th Hour"" and not enough stuff with which to fill them.
Edward Norton tries his best to make us care and in a way we do, for Norton can, like almost no other actor working today, elicit a positive response: he is stalwart and tough and yet extremely sensitive but ultimately self-absorbed as Monty and we can't help but empathize with him.
There are several half-hearted attempts to tie in the 9/11 tragedy with Monty's plight: Frank and Jakob having a conversation while viewing the devastation for one.  Lee is obviously grief stricken over 9/11, as we all are, but these scenes feel tacked-on and more to the point since Monty is mostly only interested in Monty this stab at universality feels false and gratuitous.
The physical production is gorgeous, though from Rodrigo Prieto's images of NYC and Brooklyn to Terence Blanchard's evocative music.
Spike Lee has given us several of the most accomplished and wonderful films ever committed to celluloid: think ""Malcolm X"" or ""Do the Right Thing."" But ""25th Hour"" lacks Lee's cohesive, corrosive and incendiary wit and intelligence and therefore fails to ignite our passion or our hearts.",1040256000,18,2316,4.775561097256858
1176034,1,B00000214T,this is not the war movie.this is a religous video.this should be made clear.the review i read sounded like the hard to find video (the 25th. hour)staring anthony quinn.reading this will stop returns.thank-you,1024617600,8,209,5.363636363636363
1176035,5,B00000214T,"Some clarification is necessary here.  I am writing about a movie entitled, ""The 25th Hour"" starring Anthony Quinn;  this was aired on TV many, many, years ago and is now very difficult but not impossible to come by; I was able to order a copy through A Million And One World Wide Videos, which I found on the WWW.  For two reasons I am leaving this review here, even though I was later made aware that this is not the T.D. Jakes movie - 1. The titles are so hair-splittingly similar, and -  2. The juxtaposition of real human people vs. decision making leaders comes through loud and clear here; and we need to be aware that in so many places, and in so many ways, this gaping chasm remains today, as wide and as ghastly as it was more than half a century ago.  Here begins my original review:  This is a'must see' video - if one is interested in how different life in other parts of the world can be - have been. On a continent (Europe) where, if one drives too fast, he/she will find him/herself at a border crossing of an adjoining country, what happens when a World War bulldozes itself through the lives of the ordinary citizen? What really happens to people, when borders change, countries get chopped up into sectors, and virtually cease to exist as their former selves?  How many of us can imagine ourselves as a ""Displaced Person"" referred to as DPs in DP camps?  All of this really did happen to ordinary human beings. Do see this video if you're interested in the many facets of the human condition:  any of these characters could have been any of us;  nobody ever knows if they're going to find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Hindsight often shows us that the direction we think we're headed in is far different from our actual destination.",990921600,3,1772,4.438271604938271

1176046,2,B00000214T,"I watched this movie when it first came out in 2002.  And then I watched it again tonight when I learned that David Benioff, show runner for Game of Thrones, wrote the novel and screenplay.  I am happy that Benioff was able to leverage his writing talent into creating one of the most popular episodic television shows of all time.  And now I'm going to rant against Spike Lee.  First of all, the acting talent in this film is epic:  Edward Norton, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Anna Paquin, etc. are always great to watch.  The problem is that Spike Lee cannot tell a story in a way that is remotely entertaining.  One of the problems is pacing.  The movie starts with slow opening credits set against uninspiring and cliche cityscapes and with a drowsy soundtrack.  It feels like the opening of a 1970s made-for-TV show.  Why do you need to know who is responsible for wardrobe 10 minutes into the film?  The other problem is that the narrative and flow of the story is broken up with a self-conscious, disjointed rant by Norton's character against various ethnic groups that annoy him in New York City.  This out-of-place rant makes the production feel like a student film - not even a cool indie film, but an actual student film because it self-consciously tries to be edgy (and fails).  It's pretty terrible.  And the ending is similarly disjointed and energy-sapping.  It's like Spike Lee didn't know how to end the film, so he decided to end it with a long, overly sentimental monologue.  And finally, Spike Lee's secondary characters are all one-dimensional.  The Russian gangsters and the corrupt cops that come into Norton's apartment are all caricatures.  Is this the way Spike Lee views the world?  He is incapable of nuance.  Even Philip Seymour Hoffman's repressed college professor role is something that filmgoers have all seen before.  I have watched several Spike Lee films throughout my life.  He's definitely not a mainstream commercial director.  And that's fine.  But the biggest problem with Spike Lee is that he doesn't know how to tell a story.  When I watch his films, I feel like I am reading an essay and not watching a film.  A great film transports you into a different time and place.  But Spike Lee's films always bring attention to themselves, as if the director wants the audience to know that he's the one behind it all - a man who thinks he's a brilliant creative with an important message to share.  The film industry and audiences have left Spike Lee in the dustbin of history.  Good riddance.",1464566400,,2539,4.732876712328767

1176051,5,B00000214T,I wasn't sure I was going to like this one but I'm happy to say I was wrong. The way they use Edward Norton's characters fall from grace with what happened on 9/11. How his life in the singular term is falling apart and how at that time so soon after a lot of people felt like this country was in many ways falling or going to fall apart. I really have to admit Edward Norton is so underrated as an actor he can be really serious but make something funny or be funny without the serious and do both well.

1176078,2,B00000214T,"I give this movie 2.5 stars. Like someone else said, Spike Lee usually (disappointingly) puts social message above just making a good movie. He keeps that to a minimum here, which is good, but this movie still fails to pop, or jump up off the page. I hate to say it, but Ed Norton's kind of ho-hum tone may have killed the momentum in this movie, and gave it a reluctant tone. Norton is a really intelligent guy, but that may actually be the problem. He seems a little too cerebral and learned to really be a gangster/thug drug dealer. His preppy roots show, and he just doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would do all of this illegal stuff. Norton in the right role could be absolutely brilliant, but for some reason, one of the preppiest guys in Hollywood has been pigeonholed playing a major roughneck in movies like ""American History X."" Just a weird wild shot here, but he would be great in a Cold War thriller, where he was a chess grandmaster who was also a spy. He needs to do intelligent stuff like that: this seedy underworld tough guy genre really doesn't fit him. His Yale educated roots show, and he also does something that is kind of an epidemic amongst some in Hollywood-he really seems like he is phoning it in during many of his performances. Hollywood and acting are pretty filled with preppies, and actors who can play blue collar rough necks are few and far between. However, a few preppies who could pull it off include Oscar Isaac (as he did in ""Drive""), and Jeremy Renner (as in ""The Town"").

The stars that I subtracted really came from the areas where this movie failed to capitalize, and not because this movie was really terrible (and there are movies that really ARE that terrible). The movie builds nicely towards a climax and the rising dramatic question(s): ""Who turned Monty in?"" and ""Will he actually go to jail?"" So, at least the movie doesn't get jumbled and lost in its plot. However, like I said, it failed to pop, and the movie did that thing again that I really don't get in recent years: the main character is a racist and really doesn't repent. That made him and the tone of the movie rather unlikable. There are a couple of things that the main character does that seem somewhat anti-racist, like having a Puerto Rican girlfriend, and connecting with a little black boy at the end of the movie, but his racism seems to be more heavy-duty and vitriolic than his anti-racist attitudes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman does an admirable job, but nothing that stands out, as he plays a kind of unlikable character faced with a pretty inappropriate choice in front of him. Barry Pepper is good, but shows his limitations. Rosario Dawson is ok, but is mainly in there in order to look cute. On the whole, this movie just had a little too much of a weepy, remorseful tone, and felt like it was right out of the 1970s about the hard street life in the city. It just really didn't rise up above normal. I save three star reviews for movies that I liked more than I disliked, so I really have to give this one 2.5 stars.",1433721600,2,3048,4.462365591397849

It's an interesting concept to have a film about the last 25 hours of someone's life before they go to prison for 7 years. Although, at some point you realize that time goes by faster and faster until it learns how to fly and 7 years doesn't seem so dramatic to me as say, 20 years. Anyhoo, that's neither here nor there.

1176086,3,B00000214T,"Nice film score. Fantastic acting by Edward Norton and others. A bit slow-moving, in my opinion.

Mostly, this is a character study -- both of the main character (played by Ed Norton) and of his girlfriend and cronies. Norton knows he must pay for his sins, and regrets that he lost his way in life. But, others in his life also have moral dilemmas to face. His girlfriend knew of his drug dealing and benefited from it, his Wall Street friend is a ""cowboy"" when it comes to risking his employer's money. His other best friend, a teacher, is contemplating crossing the line toward having an affair with his underage high school student. His mafia/drug-dealing buddy is a no-goodnik with his own issues of betrayal when it suits him.

I did not like the ""look-at-me"" editing (which was repeated throughout the film) whereby a small scene of 5 seconds or so would be spliced together using 3 different camera angles to repeat the small action being depicted in rapid fire. (For example, going in for a hug, repeating the hug action 3 different times from different angles.) This sort of editing seems too precious, to me. The fact that 9/11 had taken place recently gave some good background scenery for inclusion -- but, it really wasn't part of the story and could have been left out. Overall, a worthwhile film with the understanding that you are watching a character study.",1429574400,,1375,4.725

It's a great character study, morality tale, all-in-one-day narrative and a notable New York movie in the tradition of Scorsese and Lumet.

""He Got Game"" is a beautiful father-son drama about the love of basketball, without really showing much of the game itself. It's also about the unfair pressure a young prodigy may face when they're being tempted by rags-to-riches promises. Lee's use of Aaron Copland american frontier music against the atmosphere of Coney Island and basketball courts is as genius as Kubrick setting a waltz by Strauss to space travel.",1406592000,5,734,5.016393442622951

The 25th hour is an often overlooked film that gave the cast enough room to shine throughout; the story takes a unique approach to the subject at hand as it focuses on the events leading up to the big day. The blu ray quality is a great improvement from the original dvd. The special features are the same as dvd but adds new commentary.  He Got Game is well written and directed masterpiece of a sports drama that stands on its own in that genre. The blu ray quality is a definitive upgrade from the dated dvd. New audio commentary is attached, unfortunately no other extras which is a shame for a blu ray release in 2014 of an older film.

1176128,3,B00000214T,By the time Spike Lee made this film he really knew a lot about how to make a film. It is very cinema-graphic. but the plot is stupid and the characters don't relate to each other. Some of the worst acting you will ever see Phillipe Seymour Hoffman do. He never figures out his character or thew characters take on the world.,1404172800,2,325,4.258064516129032
1176129,1,B00000214T,"I was excited to watch this movie.  I love Ed Norton and there was a great cast, all with fine acting creds.  Unfortunately, this movie was boring and disjointed.  The dialogue was awkwardly scripted and awkwardly acted.  The characters, for the most part, were generally unlikable in a way that prevented me from caring at all what happened to them.  There were random references to 9/11 that had absolutely no purpose in the movie.  There was a weird scene where Norton's character's mirror image goes on a lengthy racist diatribe, also for no reason.  There was another scene as an homage to NYC, which had nothing to do with the plot.  Using flashbacks made no senseit would have been much better just running the timeline straight.  The ending was long, strange and disappointing.  The only thing good about the movie was the dog, Doyle, who was very cute.

Overall, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  Spike Lee always puts pushing an ideological agenda ahead of filming a good story.  There's nothing wrong with using film to spread an idea.  But it's only effective if the film itself is good and the ideology actually fits in with the plot.  His style just didn't work for this movie at all.",1403308800,9,1199,4.697115384615385

1176131,2,B00000214T,"25th Hour, directed by Spike Lee (2002), is a poignant and engaging drama.  It tells about the last 24 hours of freedom that a character named Montgomery Brogan spends with his family and friends before he goes to prison.  Montgomery must serve a sentence for selling drugs.

One subject frequently discussed in this movie is the certainty that Montgomery will be raped.  He is young and handsome.  So he especially will be raped repeatedly, brutally, continually.

In his anguish Montgomery searches his thoughts for whom to blame for the pain in his life, for the pain he knows is coming.  In one scene, as he observes a sequence of New York Citys diverse ethnic groups, his thoughts scream anger at each group.  Jews, blacks, Koreans, and more.  His feelings shout hatred at them all.  Later when he has some time alone with his reflections, he blames himself.  Very painfully he confesses to himself that he messed up.

But the story line lets the principal villain off the hook, in my view.  None of the characters in the movie blames the government.  But it seems clear to me that the government is far and away the biggest criminal in any such story.  Montgomery is a good citizen, in my assessment.  He is loved by his family and friends.  He has mostly warm and positive relations with all with whom he deals, including both suppliers and customers from his drug trading days.  Montgomery has no enemies; we see no one who would step forward and say that he had been wronged by Montgomery.  Montgomery has not committed anything which a libertarian would consider to be a crime.  Indeed it appears to me that he has lived a productive and supportive life.  He should not be subject to punishment.  Yet the government is going to destroy his life and bring pain into the lives of all who love Montgomery.

Further, even if a person has committed a crime, to send an inmate into an environment where he will surely be raped is itself a huge crime.  But in the environment where government has taken a monopoly for itself in enforcement of law, this crime against humanity, far worse than anything Montgomery is alleged to have done, will go forever unpunished.

The pain we see in 25th Hour should be blamed, unless I am mistaken, upon an error in the constitution of a democratic state.  It is simply wrong to empower a majority to impose their whims upon a minority.  I hope that I am in no part a cause of the pain which the government in the US inflicts upon so many people.  I believe it would be a sin for me to participate in a process through which my mere preferences might be forced upon other people",1402963200,3,2617,4.56989247311828

I'm watching movies I missed for performances by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.  So the heroin dealer theme both attracted and repulsed.  Ed Norton scowls through his hipness again as the dealer who's spending his last night out before heading to prison.  Hoffman, in one of his rare tepid performances, is Norton's nerdish high school history teacher friend.  Barry Pepper, in a role that brings some much-needed energy to the film, is his soulmate buddy.  The lovely Rosario Dawson is his girlfriend.

1176151,5,B00000214T,"This movie made 2 hours and 15 minutes fly by... for a 22 year-old male, like myself, I found this movie to have all the right elements.  Here's a quick summary of the whole thing: Monty (Edward Norton) is a drug dealer who has been sentenced to seven years in prison after being cornered by the DEA.  He spends his last day of freedom talking to his father (Brian Cox) and setting up a shindig so that he can see his girlfriend Naturelle (the very sexy Rosario Dawson), and his two best friends Jacob and Frank (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper) one last time.  As a celebration he has all of them meet at a nightclub that he used to regularly attend so that they can enjoy his final night as a free man.

What I loved about it:
 Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman - the movie is at it's best when these two are on-screen.  Not only are their characters both hilarious, but I love how their personalities offset each other.  The character Monty is much more believable thanks to these two.
 Edward Norton's rant in the mirror about his disgust for the people of New York, including himself.
 The entire night club scene - especially the gliding effect Spike Lee uses with Anna Paquin and Philip Seymour Hoffman & the surreal, psychedelic feeling that it creates.  Seriously, this is probably one of my favorite scenes of any movie.
 The ending (which I don't think could have been done any better) leaves it all open for interpretation.

There is little else to the plot, other than his school teacher friend's sexual attraction to his under-age student, a subplot that is not developed; like the main plot, it discloses his anguish very well, but little else. If the presentation of brooding and anguish is the film's goal, the film is very successful.

Spike Lee peddles in stereotypes - ethnic, gender, and class - and no one cares about or becomes invested in a paper-thin stereotype. The depictions of women were also sophomoric and annoying - Spike should just avoid pictures with female characters because he has no clue.

Set right after the September 11th attack, with a gaping hole in the middle of New York, we see what real criminals do.  The film's main character is a New York drug dealer Montgomery Brogran (Edward Nortan) who is a convicted drug dealer but not a mean man or a man that kills.  The film shows the 24 hours he savors and ties loose ends before he goes to prison for seven long years.  Monty was once king of Manhattan, and now he has to say good-by to friends, family and lover as he reviews his past choices and what might have been.  Monty is basically a good man, has a good heart, he saves an injured dog and names him ""Doyle"", he is kind to his father, and helps others.  One of his childhood friends, Frank Slattery (Barry Pepper) voices the unseen victims of drug dealing.  He is constantly mumbling how drugs hurt other people's lives, but never confronted Monty as they are growing up and making life's decisions.  This may or may not have changed Monty's course in life, but the conflict of choice is shown throughout the film.

Monty's last day is capped by a good-by party at a posh nightclub, where his friends Frank Slattery, Jakob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a high school teacher, and his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) meet him for a farewell hosted by the Russian mob.  A high school student (Anna Paquin) shows up for another sub-plot on decisions and what is right and wrong.

The movie moves in the steady direction of Monty's fear of incarceration with hardened criminals.  Norton plays Monty perfectly as scared, confused, and knowing after seven years so much will change with his relationships.  Monty's father (Brian Cox) is heartbroken and blames himself for Monty's problems.

The movie is full of life, yet haunting and sad.  It grabs your attention from the first scenes and keeps pace with beautiful cinematography and a fantastic ensemble cast.",1270425600,,2085,4.686813186813187

Lots of guilt, sorry, melancholy - very little entertainment. I must admit I find nothing interesting in a New York drug dealer as a movie subject - in fact I find nothing interesting in big city life or drug dealers, respectively. So the drama goes out the window with that. And there's nothing left really to keep you entertained.

1176173,5,B00000214T,"Monty Brogan is about to start his last day of freedom before turning himself into the authorities and serving a seven-year term for drug dealing. He's a charming young man who had always dreamed of being a fireman, following in the working-class footsteps of his father, who has had to put up his bar in Queens as bond so that his son can stay out of jail until his sentence begins. Monty, named for Montgomery Clift, does not know how he managed to get himself into this predicament. It was easy money and it carried so many perks, and you'll feel more than a little sympathy for this young man who has managed to kill his own dream for courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. But before he goes to prison, Monty wants to have one last night out on the town with his two best friends. Frank Slattery is a bond trader, one of the best and most successful risk takers in a very risky business. The other is Jakob Elinsky, an English teacher who envies his friends' lifestyles but who has no intention of ever giving up his job for the easy money, despite the disillusionment of teaching high school students in a tough school. The three young men enjoy the night into the early morning as they eat, drink, and visit the hottest spots in town. A shocking ending, brilliant and disturbing story.

1176175,4,B00000214T,"Spike Lee is a director that it took me a while to watch. Call it the prejudices of growing up in a southern right wing Christian family, but I always got the impression that he was a racist black man blaming all the black race's social ailments on the white man. Having been raised by members of both races, I'm not fond of that type of mentality. Finally, I decided to educate myself on Lee's films, and started with the amazing social commentary of Do the Right Thing. Boy, was I wrong. Since then I've watched a few Spike Lee joints and never got the impression that he was a racist, but that he was highly aware of the racial and social tensions that came with living in the big city, and you see a little bit of that in 25th Hour.

In 25th Hour, we meet Montgomery Brogan, a former heroine dealer for the Russian mob recently pinched and spending his last day as a free man with his family and closest friends before spending the next 7 years behind bars. Among his friends he has: Jacob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a high school English teacher coming to terms with his crush on one of his students (Anna Paquin); Frank Slaugherty (Barry Pepper), Monty's oldest friend who's dealing with the fact that his best friend is a drug dealer and he never tried to stop him; Naturelle Riviera (Rosario Dawson), his girlfriend who may or may not have sold him; and his dad, James Brogan (Brian Cox), who would rather see his son run far away and never come back than go to prison.

25th Hour is more of a character study than anything else. The movie surrounds a party where each member of Monty's entourage comes to term with what's going on in this life. While featuring what's going on in the present, we also see flashbacks that help flesh out the history of some of our more notable characters as Lee expounds on the whodunit of selling out Monty. Lee still approaches the racial and social tensions as Monty fights with his subconscious in an effort to remember that he screwed up his own life. Lee does a great job at presenting the struggles of life in a big city, and as always in a Lee movie the big city is a living breathing character in and of itself.

The acting pedigree in this movie is nothing to sneeze at either. Featuring Golden Globe and Oscar nominated talent such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin, and Brian Cox, as well as other notable actors like Rosario Dawson and Barry Pepper you expect nothing but the best. The movie completely belongs to the tortured performance of Edward Norton. This performance recalls his work in American History X, while delving into different areas of guilt, depression, and owning your situation. I would argue that Norton even goes deeper into the character, giving a more nuanced performance that is less preachy than he did in the aforementioned movie.

The one main fault I would have to pin on this movie is pacing. For the most part the movie flows perfectly, but the flashbacks, while serving to build up the characters, don't help the narrative flow properly. If you were to ask if this movie is an enjoyable movie and worth watching, I would have to answer with an enthusiastic yes.

1176179,4,B00000214T,"The 25th Hour (DVD)

While much focus under reviews of the movie has been on Spike Lee's involvement in the film of the book and use of the post 11/9 setting, this in large part overlooks that the movie started with the great asset of a well written novel with a unique and timely story. In addition the using of the author David Beniofff to also write the screenplay seems to have ensured that much of the book's strengths were not lost in the transition to the screen.

Despite the few sops made from the book to Hollywood story lines (an over emphasis on did the girlfriend betray the lead character now destined for 7 years in jail and the resultant conversion of the ending), there is much to admire in the movie especially in tracking the story mix of the course of the lead actor Ed Norton's last day of freedom and the flashbacks needed to explain why matters have turned out as they have.

While the film's main emphasis is inevitably on Norton, what is more interesting is how he pales (relatively) against the ensemble of other support roles from the spot on Wall Street financial trader aggression of Barry Pepper; the adrift personna of introverted academic Philip Seymour Hoffman; the confused Puerto Rican girlfriend of Rosario Dawson and the pained widowed father of Brian Cox. The film makes great use of long set up fixed shots where the book's core themes of friendships and personal loyalties under pressure are endlesssly explored, with most dramatic effect in two scenes from an apartment overlooking the cleared World Trade Centre site and in a bar scene before the party moves on to a dance club.

While Spike Lee deserves full credit for evoking the NY story and setting, this is definitely a production that is the sum of its many great parts (and the audio commentary from Lee and Benioff included as a DVD extra reconfirms this).",1221955200,2,1857,4.669724770642202

1176181,4,B00000214T,"I saw 25th Hour, starring Edward Norton, last week, and I sooooo enjoyed it. In this movie, Norton plays Montgomery, a drug dealer who gets pinched by the DEA. The movie catalogues his final day of freedom before he goes to jail for 7 years on drug charges. He re-visits his old school, has dinner with his father (a wonderful turn by Brian Cox), and goes out one last time with his two best friends (played beautifully by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper) and his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson).

It seems ordinary enough, but every interaction is imbued with meaning because all involved realize what's on the other side of the evening - 7 long, horrible years in prison. Norton is marvelous in this. There is also an achingly quiet scene between Pepper and Hoffman, overlooking the hole that was Ground Zero, that I will remember for a long time.

The only complaint I have is an early scene, played between Norton and his reflection in the mirror, that I thought was too preachy and overwrought. The script circled back around to it later in the film, which redeemed the sequence somewhat, but mostly I felt that this could have been cut without detriment to the story.

Warning - there's alot of language here. But for a movie about a drug dealer, I can understand it. Watch this movie for the performances.",1217116800,,1316,4.663793103448276

Norton together with a fine cast (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brian Cox, Barry Pepper and the luscious Rosario Dawson)plus a very good screenplay by David Benihoff (Troy) help to make this one of Spike's best films.

There is something about the genuineness of the dialogues which are very compelling.  This is true of all of his films, but particularly this one where Edward Norton's character is distressed about being sent to prison.  The whole story revolves around this one character.  The conversations he has with others, himself and the side conversations about his situation is very moving and thought provoking.

The film is all about the decisions we make and how those decisions can lead to painful ramifications for not only the person making them but to his friends and love ones as well.",1214265600,2,723,4.698412698412699

1176185,5,B00000214T,"As 'A Spike Lee Joint,' 25th hour is part of the ongoing Lee paradigm, filled with his typical style, directorial vigour, and cinematic gloss. A flowing, feature length music video, containing a story that is coherent, topical and, above all, strongly analytical in its approach to the characters, 25th Hour is the story of mid level drug dealer (Monty Brogan - Ed Norton) whom, on his last day before being incarcerated for his illicit trade, must make peace with his family and friends, answer to his Red Mafiya/Vory v zakone  suppliers, say farewell to the city he so obviously loves and, ultimately, accept that he is now in receipt of justified dues.

With a post 9/11 setting in NYC, the script deviates from the book (which was written pre-9/11) only slightly in order to encompass the destruction, yet the atmosphere is set with the opening credits and a slice of dialogue during the first quarter (followed by some beautifully filmed cutaways of a sodium lit night-time clean-up crew, working in Ground Zero) which leaves the audience with no alternative but to associate the main characters' desperate tableau with plight of the city in the aftermath of tragedy. Lee - love him or loathe him for it - is known for his preaching and, right or wrong, seems to be suggesting that perhaps the terrible events of 9/11 have some twisted, if unjustified, reason. Lee later strongly denied this was his intention, in an enigmatic yet vague interview, and if he's criticised for it, has only himself to blame.

This could perhaps beg the question: What was so bad about how Monty made his living to warrant the end of his life (in effect) in the 25th Hour?

This is a question answered before it's asked, with the first scene after the opening credits showing an exchange between Monty and a dishevelled wreck of a man who is quite clearly one of his customers. It's further reinforced in a later flashback to Monty's earlier days as a dealer when the same man approaches Monty dressed in business attire. The destruction of others for personal gain is something that will not - and quite rightly so - go unchallenged.

Relying somewhat on symbolism and hidden meanings, there are a number of subtexts, as well as ample opportunities to read into the narrative more than is intended, but the overall message is clear: culpability is in the hands of the bearer, and with his last 24 hours of freedom sifting away and the eponymous 25th Hour quickly approaching Monty must see that blame can only lie with himself.

25th Hour's greatest achievement is in relaying a subtle, but highly relevant parable in a manner of storytelling that is both enjoyable and compelling. Very few words are wasted and the dialogue remains taught and muscular throughout. The editing, acting, score, direction and cinematography are all of the very highest standard. Whether or not you agree Lee's intention was to illustrate a larger picture - that maybe The US was in receipt of ineluctable retribution - is another story.",1205020800,4,3003,4.832684824902723
1176186,3,B00000214T,"I understand the film tries to portray the fact that many people in their everday life commit crimes. Also I guess the movie came after sept 11 so it makes a reference to ground zero. There is a section  where Edward Norton rants against the system, against the asians, sikhs, arabs and whites. Throught out the film I was trying to make sense of where the movie was heading. Dont get me wrong it was a  very different movie and did not try to do the same thing as the steorotypical hollywood film but still the disperate story threads which did not have much connection to one other kind of threw me off.  Edward Norton plays the drug peddler who gets caught with illegal cash, mops over it and then intends to party with this very close friends and enjoy his last night before going to jail. Phillip Seymore plays one of the friends who is a school teacher who has a crush on his 17 year student. The other friend is a risky stock gambler on wall street. Edward Norton suspects his girl friend of blowing the whistle on him, spends time with his friends as they bring out the skeletons in their cupboard, asks his friends to rough him up so that he does not look too neat when he enters prison, and then gets an offer from his dad to become a volunatry fugitive and lead a new life. At the ends I did not quite get what the film added upto and what Spike Lee is trying to convey in this story. There are seperate story lines which portray the immoral acts of some of the characters. Sure it talks of mistrust, suspiciouns and our own personal immoral crimes. But it doesn't compare to selling drugs, that can't be condoned. And so what was this film about. What was the message...?

1176187,5,B00000214T,"Spike Lee masterfully delivers to us `25th Hour', a film so rich with character development and emotion that we are drawn in to each passing frame.  In fact I can't say that Lee has ever been this graceful, this articulate or this brilliant before.  If any film should have landed him an Oscar it would have to be this film, but sadly `25th Hour' was utterly ignored by Oscar, which is a shame since it truly is one of the best films of the given year.  `25th Hour' is such a richly fulfilled film, a feature so complete in every category that it's hard to believe it was snubbed so extremely.  From the script to the actors to the masterful direction `25th Hour' is in a word `flawless'.

The story revolves around drug dealer Monty Brogan who was just busted and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  On his last night of freedom he purposes to find the person that set him up, the person who called in that anonymous tip that started his spiral of bad luck.

Was it his best friend Frank?

Was it his shy and reclusive friend Jacob?

Was it his beautiful girlfriend Naturelle?

While the film revolves around one night, the said night is so full of rich development that we are never bored, never stagnant and never rushed.  The night beautifully captures the feeling of panic, the feeling of impending disaster but never lets loose of his relaxed pace and delivery.  The lighting, the mood, the atmosphere is all magnificently captured by Spike Lee and company.

And what an impressive company he has.  Edward Norton; one of the greatest working actors, is utterly amazing here.  Yet another Oscar caliber performance (how is it that he is nominated for everything he does?).  As Monty he fleshes out the very soul of this man, the rough exterior that melts away to reveal the vulnerable and frail fear within his heart.  You have two aspects to this man and he breathes life to each side.  You have his breathtaking monologue in the mirror and his heartbreaking final scene with co-star Barry Pepper.  Speaking of Pepper, he nails his performance as Frank; the aggressive arrogance and almost snooty air that only masks his apparent loyalty and devotion.  Philip Seymour Hoffman has always been a great supporting player but this is one of his finest performances in my opinion.  It's not as showy as his more recent and beloved work and I think that plays to his interests here.  He is reserved and subtle and thus endearing and memorable.  His scene with Anna Paquin at the club is devastatingly real.  Anna Paquin is also effortlessly captivating here as Mary, the flirtatious student for whom Jacob pines.  Rosario Dawson and Brian Cox are also great here, not as standout as the four I've mentioned but definitely not lacking in any area.

Spike Lee though is the star of this film.  Taking Benioff's script (which he adapted from his novel of the same name) and turning it loose on us in such a visually stimulating form Spike was able to pulverize me with one of the most effortlessly mesmerizing films I've seen in a long time.

Sure it's just one night, but it's one night you'll never forget.",1200960000,2,3102,4.621572212065813
1176188,4,B00000214T,"Hmmm! This one caught me by surprise. It's an un-Spike Lee-esque joint. His usual cast of characters (Denzel Washington, Giancarlo Esposito, John Turturro, etc) are nowhere to be found. No moving sidewalks that I can remember. No pumping hip-hop soundtrack.

Having said that ...

This was a very good movie! There is no real plot but that's not a problem. Spike likes his movies to be character driven (a la Do the Right Thing) and this flick certainly fits the bill. Edward Norton is extremely compelling as Montgomery Brogan, a drug dealer who has been outed as such and is now spending his final day of freedom looking back on his life and the mistakes he's made.

Since there is no plot I don't want to give any of the movie away, but I must say there are very strong supporting performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Berry Pepper, Rosario Dawson, Brian Cox, and former NFL superstar Tony Siragusa who is almost unrecognizable via a thick and believable Russian accent. If I could have given the movie 4.5 stars I would have. Monty's rescuing of and eventual relationship with his pet dog Doyle would be the 1/2 star added - very touching.

1176190,5,B00000214T,"This was one of those movies that has been on my ""like to watch it, someday"" list forever. Once I finally got a chance to watch it, I was blown away by how amazing this movie is. Over the years there have been tons of movies about the existential crises of men who were dying, growing up, going to war, etc. The main character's crisis is different - Monty (played by Edward Norton) is going to prison for 7 years for dealing drugs. In this case, the main character is not dying or going to war or growing up - he is going to a place where most likely, all three will happen (he will definitely have to grow up, he will most certainly end up ""at war"" with other inmates, and more than one man has experienced the death of his soul, or at least his dreams, in prison, if they don't actually lose their life). It's a new twist on the time-honored ""man vs. himself"" theme.
There are some great moments in this movie but the subplot that struck me the most was the friendship between Monty and his old school pals Jacob (played by the very talented Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Frank (played by Barry Pepper, a criminally underrated and underemployed actor). Three guys who have gone down very different paths in life but are still linked by the strong ties of friendship they forged in school. Frank's character, as played by Pepper, in particular has a lot of depth and provokes both thought and emotion. As the movie plays out, you can see his character struggling with his own feelings about his best friend's fate. Does Monty deserve to be going to prison, as he tells Jacob in his apartment, or do he and Monty's other friends bear some responsibility for tacitly accepting Monty's drug dealing over the years, never telling him to stop, as he tells Naturelle (Monty's girlfriend, played by Rosario Dawson)? Will Monty's prison term end their friendship (as Frank tells Jacob) or will Frank be ""waiting at the gate at Otisville in seven years"" when Monty gets out, as Frank tells Naturelle? You can watch Pepper's internal turmoil as his character weighs out the options in his head, and watch the calculating investment banker fight with the Irish guy from the neighborhood that Frank used to be. Particularly in the scene in the park, you can see that true friendship is a lot more difficult and messy than sitcoms portray. Some friendships survive the test of time and bind people together long after they cease to have anything in common besides their shared past experiences. You can love your friends without loving their choices, and when their bad choices catch up to them, it's more important to stand by them and offer strength than to say ""I told you so."" The enduring nature of friendship was one of the themes of the movie that I felt was more compelling than the romantic subplot between Monty and Naturelle, or Monty's conflict with the Russian drug dealers.

Monty's relationship with his dad (played by Brian Cox) is also compelling and Cox's monologue, which ends the movie, is incredibly sad, because it represents a father's hopes and dreams for his son that will now come to nothing.

This is a brilliantly understated movie about the ties that bind people together - father/son, friendship, romance, trust, teacher-student - and how those ties can stretch to the breaking point but still not break. Monty, on his last day before a 7-year prison term, still believes that his girlfriend Naturelle is the one who sold him out to the DEA, yet he doesn't accuse her, throw her out of his apartment, etc. If there's one overarching theme in this movie, it's that life is never as simple as you think. I don't usually enjoy Spike Lee movies, but I loved this one. For such a simple premise, there's a power in this movie that is undeniable.",1191196800,3,3757,4.622754491017964

Ed Norton is the star here as a yuppie who has messed his life up.  Norton's yuppie is the sort of ordinary guy who most folks can identify with.  Norton's character has reached a crossroads where he has three choices:  Go on the lam, commit suicide or go to prison where his good looks ensure that he will be subjected to homosexual rape.

I also hated the ""multiple cuts"" in the film that showed different angles of the same scene.  These cuts didn't appear to be spliced together properly.  It was simply aggravating.  I am not aware of the proper technical terms for ""multiple cuts"" nor the ""mirror image"" mentioned below (sorry).

The way films were scened were also annoying.  The scene at the brokerage firm had a ""mirror image"" of some characters talking to Barry Pepper's role.  It took away from the scene.  I am not sure why that ""mirroring"" was there since there wasn't a glass partition there.

Interesting scenes: Barry Pepper at the firm, Norton and his dad in the car, and Norton looking in the mirror with his character lambasting everyone

The way the film was presented, I thought a high school student put this together.  Again, the acting was very good.  The story had a good premise and interesting characters, but the execution was lacking.

This film was in need of focus and direction.",1172534400,4,1211,4.7
1176195,5,B00000214T,"Spike Lee has some great gifts as a film maker.  One is his ability to create chracters the audience can identify with and the other is to make the setting a character unto itself.  25th Hour was one of the first films shot in post 9/11 New York.  Lee makes full use of this, showing how one city can play a big role in people's lives.

But 25th Hour is not about 9/11.  25th Hour is about friendship.  It is about redemption.  It is about uncertainty in the future.  The film stars Edward Norton as a generally good man who unfortunately engaged in illegal activity and got caught.  The film takes place on the final day before he is to serve his sentence and flashes back to the moments that led to his fate.  We find him accepting of his fate, only questioning who and what led him to this moment.  There is a brilliantly directed, much discussed scene where Norton is cursing the people of NYC, his friends, then finally himself as he stares at a reflection in a mirror.  This is one of the single greatest scenes that define a character within a film.

This film has a brilliant script that focuses heavily not only on Norton, but two of his contrasting friends, played brilliantly by Barry Pepper and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Pepper is a sly Wall Street man who tries to be slick and even has an equation for his likelihood of success with women.  Hoffman, in an untypically subtle understated performance, plays a shy seemingly shameful teacher.  He serves as a counterbalance to Pepper.  The way these two characters discuss themselves and their friend help define 25th Hour as a beautiful character piece.

This film's defining theme of an uncertain future is emphasized by the post 9/11 backdrop.  One telling scene involves Hoffman and Pepper talking about Norton's possible future while we stare out Ground Zero in a window behind them.  An uncertain future indeed...",1168128000,2,1880,4.656534954407295
1176196,5,B00000214T,"`25th Hour' is truly one of the greatest films to surface in 2002, a year that up until this week I rendered as the year the movies died.  That's for another discussion, maybe I'll make a ""So you'd like to know"" list to discuss that one.  Anyways, having just seen this film I am still on a high sort-of-speak, still reeling off of the energy produced with each passing frame.  Supported strongly by powerful performances by the entire cast, `25th Hour' delivers a unique premise and a thought provoking script glossed up nicely by Spike Lee's brilliant direction.

The brilliant Edward Norton delivers yet another award worthy performance as drug dealer Monty Brogan.  Monty has just hit a strode of bad luck for a tip to the police has landed him an eight year stint in prison, and now, on his last night of freedom he endeavors to find the one responsible.  Among the few he suspects is his stunning girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), one of the only people who knew where he hid his drugs.  At his aid are his best friend's Frank (Barry Pepper) and teacher Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is battling his own demons as he pines over his underage student Mary (Anna Paquin).

Its one night, but so much can happen in that one night.  What makes this film so brilliant is its rich character development.  Each main character has their own baity scene as it could be called, a scene that defines their role in the film and showcases their own plights.  Edward Norton's scene comes early on, his ""F*** you"" monologue in the bathroom which is delivered in a way only Norton could deliver it.  Hoffman's comes next, in the club, where he goes against his own better judgment and makes a pass at Anna.  As he walks away from her his face reads all kinds of controlled emotions.  Lastly, and most effective, comes Barry's defining moment, a scene towards the end of the film where he reluctantly carries out Monty's last request of him.  Just watch out for it, it threw me for a loop.

Flawlessly orchestrated, `25th Hour' is a prime example of how a movie can be done right.  From the moment Monty stumbles upon the `Bull Pitt' to the scene where he's driving towards the prison with his father James (Brian Cox) we are completely intoxicated with this well spun and brilliantly crafted drama.  Adapted the screenplay from his own novel, David Benioff breathes life into his characters, giving them rich dialog to work with and delivering a fantastic script that these actors take and execute magnificently.  Edward Norton has always been one of my favorite actors, a an who can take any role and make it memorable, and Monty Brogan is no exception.",1165536000,4,2653,4.666666666666667
1176197,5,B00000214T,"I  realize from the outset that Spike Lee did not in fact write this film, but, this is easily his smartest and most watchable films since Mo' Better or School Daze (Do The Right Thing was too heavy handed IMHO). A true character study, this film is smart and doesnt pander, while allowing you, the viewer, to simply learn and enjoy on your own. Edward Norton, as usual, shines in his role, bringing a depth of feeling to the role that few could, while Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Papper add to the film by showing their own characters depth....but not detracting from the main story. If you're looking for a smart film, that tries to be more than an network TV series with curse words and sex...and succeeds, then you cant go wrong with this film.",1161820800,2,754,4.5036496350364965
1176198,5,B00000214T,"Kudos to Spike Lee whose deft directorial touch and aided by stellar acting performances created a poignant ode to a criminal Monty Brogan possessed with a large measure of sensitivity.  Brogan played by the intensely talented Edward Norton is a drug dealer caught by the feds with a major stash and sentenced to seven years of prison.

""25th Hour"" chronicles Monty's last day of freedom before he must surrender to start serving his sentence.  Accompanied by his best friends Frank played by Barry Pepper and Jacob played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and his gorgeous and caring girlfriend Naturelle played by the alluring Rosario Dawson, they spend one last night together.  Norton is forced to re-examine his life through his friendship and relationships.  He must relinquish the privileges that his illicit lifestyle had afforded him.  He reconnects with his father played by Brian Cox, who although distant throughout Monty's life demonstrates his love for his son.

Norton and Hoffman, whose reputations have already been firmly established, did not disappoint with their portrayals.  Barry Pepper, however was especially terrific in his role as Frank Slaughtery, a Wall Street trading cowboy with close brotherly bonds to his long time friend Monty.  Tony Siragusa playing Monty's bodyguard Kostya, with a ridiculous Russian accent should stick to his day job, football.

Spike Lee concludes his film with a really brilliant ending that leaves you wondering.",1159488000,4,1462,5.317391304347826
1176199,2,B00000214T,"I guess I'm in the minority here - but I really didn't care for this movie. The irony was pretty striking...in parts of the movie, you are reminded of the post 9-11 climate and the sacrifices others have made for our freedom.  Then you have a lead character like Monty that is completely unlikeable and undeserving of the breaks he has received.  It was hard to feel any empathy for him (even saving the dog wasn't enough for me).  Here is somebody who has made poor choices and is now getting punished for it.  But what does the movie do? 99% of the supporting characters feel sorry for Monty and whine about how it isn't right that he is going away. He never acknowledges what he did was wrong, he seems to feel bad that he got caught, that's all.

To me, it looks like Spike Lee wanted to support his hometown after 9-11 and rushed this movie into production.  Even though the parts were well acted by all, they were still unrealistic, unlikeable characters with a fragmented, slow plot.  I enjoyed Lee's films ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Bamboozled"" much more.",1151452800,8,1062,4.5

I'm not a Spike Lee fan, but this was definitely an improvement for him. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper were perfectly cast for their roles and Rosario Dawson did a superb job as supporting actress. I was disappointed that Brian Cox didn't have a bigger role, but he played the father part well as usual. There are a lot of underlying issues in the film that you are caught during a second viewing. Overall, great movie. If nothing else, watch it to see Ed Norton in a ""riverting"" performance.",1150070400,4,662,4.571428571428571
1176201,5,B00000214T,"With the release of 25th Hour, Spike Lee has been blamed for `going middle of the road'; for `going white', for `going Hollywood'. The film has also been accused of being too slow, too atmospheric, too indulgent, with no plot. Of course, it was only two years before that Lee's previous creation, `Bamboozled', was blamed for being too provocative, too racially focused, too in-your-face, and with too many contrived plot turns. It seems he just can't win these days; it seems quite obvious to me that these two films, very different though they are, are his best creations in a long time - since 1992's `Malcolm X' at least - and both are fantastic and original films, among my favorites.

It's true that there is very little going on in `25th Hour', but a lot is happening beneath the surface; while it raises none of the racial issues we may somehow expect from Lee, it's a very powerful - if subtle - social commentary, about post-9/11 New York City. Other than being the first major piece of fiction to refer to the disaster from a personal viewpoint, and that much can be seen from the beautiful montage of footage from the WTC monument that follows the moody opening scene. Lee's approach to this difficult and provocative subject is very real and very personal, and it's clearly from the viewpoint of a real New-Yorker. And although Ground Zero at WTC serves mainly as a backdrop and the attack is referred to directly only once in the film, it's hard not to see the important connection between the story of New York's disaster, and the personal disaster of New Yorker Monty Brogan.

25th Hour is as much an achievement for Spike Lee as it is for lead actor Edward Norton; and I consider it the final piece in a trilogy of fantastic films that clearly based Norton as one of the leading actors of his generation, a rise that began four years earlier with American History X and Fight Club (sadly, Norton has not again fulfilled his potential since 25th Hour, but I'm still waiting to see what he has to offer). Norton's portrayal of Monty Brogan is moving and complex; Brogan is a drug dealer, but he's not necessarily a bad guy - he's a man who made some bad decisions, and is now paying for them. And even though Norton is supported by a fantastic, first rate cast - one that includes Brian Cox, Rosario Dawson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper and Anna Paquin - it's clearly his show, and he makes the most of it. Norton brings Monty to life as a classic anti-hero, and he's as fascinating a protagonist as the characters he played in Fight Club and American History X. 25th Hour is an atmospheric and intense character study, and Norton's performance makes it perfect.

That can be seen most clearly in the infamous mirror monologue, which was attacked most vigorously by the film's critics, and hailed most enthusiastically by its supporters. That scene harks back to a very similar scene that Lee did many years before in his celebrated masterpiece `Do The Right Thing', but it provokes a very different meaning. Like the scene in `Do The Right Thing', the mirror scene is a perfect example of one of the things I love most about Lee as a director, and one that constantly angers his critics, is his uncompromising approach for provocation and straightforwardness; Lee never felt any need to be too subtle or to dodge artfully around painful subjects like racism, and in this scene he tackles the problems of post-9/11 head on, and with no fear of stirring things up. It's a powerful and difficult scene, one of the boldest made in recent years, and by itself it makes the film memorable.

25th Hour is poetry; if it sometimes seems slow, it's because the important action is all below the surface, in the soul of Monty Brogan, and in all the lost souls of New York City. It's probably the most atmospheric piece Lee has pulled, but it's a beautiful work, and is well recommended for fans of Lee's and Norton's both. It's an unnerving and unsettling experience, but well worth the admission.",1146787200,5,4010,4.651622002820875

1176203,2,B00000214T,"I just can't believe how bad of a director this guy is. Someone needs to sit him down and have a little conversation with him as to what it takes to direct a movie, and then explain to him why it's only now he's being told this.

Why does Spike Lee still not understand the concept of pacing in a movie? How can he not know this? He's been making movies for quite awhile now, how can something so fundamental still escape him? WTF! The least you can expect from a movie is to not want to cause violence towards the director after seeing it, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel like that.

The script itself is fine, and in the hands of a competent director, probably would've been an above average movie, if not great. But since this was made by Spike Lee, of course the movie plods along like a snail taking a sight-seeing tour in the grass, and you wanna just smash him over the head and tell him to move it already. The thread of the story is not crisp or focused, it just so happens to have Edward Norton in the scenes, but there's no other connecting factor. As an example, someone please tell me the purpose of the teacher and his little deal with Anna Paquin and her annoying character. Why even introduce that into the story if you're not GOING ANYWHERE WITH IT! Spike Lee's the master of the unfinished subplot!

This movie has very bad pacing, as there's no point or sense of purpose to the story they're trying to tell you. I can't compare this with movies with bad story lines (which this doesn't have actually), because at least in those cases, the movie moved along and made progress, had an agenda, and accomplished it, 1,2,3. This movie just kinda stopped at 1 and hung around until the credits were rolling.

And I didn't even know he made this...all I did was rent it for Edward Norton, one of the best actors of the decade. Well, Spike Lee did a very nice job in this movie. 5 star worthy..maybe..but the effort is there to boost it.

The cast is definitely a positive sign in this movie with Edward Norton and Philip Seymour Hoffman playing their roles perfectly.

The movie's about Monty, a guy living in New York with a beautiful girlfriend, nice friends and a sweet dog. The opening sequence shows Monty saving this dog's life in a touching moment. But Monty also sells drugs. He makes money off it but lately has been stopping. One thing that I trully appreciate about this movie is that there is no drug usage whatsoever. Nada! It's all about that but unlike most movies, this movie only shows what's necessary and that is something very rare and I trully appreciate it.

Monty is caught though and is sentenced to 7 years in prison. He basically lives out his last 25 hours for a long time as a free man. The audience is one of his friends too..we follow him around town as he is about to be caged up. It's a very sad movie and very powerful movie. The part where he talks to himself in the mirror is one of the most powerful sequences that I have ever seen.

Everyone plays their role perfectly and the realism of the movie is stunning. The visuals are perfect and the story development is continuous. The ending is touching and this movie remains as one of the most powerful of the last 20 or so years.

It's a movie that everyone should see because it has an inner message and is a wonderful critique of our society.

Edward Norton once again takes a rough role and is stunning. He trully is one of the best actors to watch.

The movie is about the day before Monty goes to jail.  He goes through alot mentally in this apprehension of his dramatic life change only a few hours away.  Who turned me in? Does she really love me? Will she be around when I get out?  Who are my real friends? Who can I trust?  Why didn't I just stop when I had the money to move and start a clean life somewhere else?  How bad is prison really going to be?  So much more than just this though.

All the characters are so rich.  Through Monty's memories we see detail of characters.  And through their dialogue with each other we see their own internal conflicts.  Even the few minutes spent on the top Russian Mobster shows him with a history and understanding on the world and prison.

They're all going through something you don't really want to go through, but you're sure to identify with one of them.  As far as what would you do in this situation?

Apparently some people had some issues with the fantasy bit at the end of the movie.  I think this is just another thing that is bound to go through your head if you were in Monty's position, or his father's.  Should I just go?  Just go away, change my name...etc.  All that at the very last minute.  The fear of having to report to prison for a 7 year sentence when you could just as easily ""say the word"" and your pop will take the George Washington Bridge and drive off to the west.
No, face the consequences.  Be a man.  Own up to what you've done.
These are the natural thoughts anybody would have in this situation and I commend Benioff for being this real.

I must commend Spike Lee for presenting this so beautifully, and the remarkable, tasteful use of Ground Zero as a backdrop done in a way that only a New Yorker could.  This really might be the best film Lee has made.

1176216,5,B00000214T,"All of the things Lee is criticized and raked over the coals for is precisely what makes The 25th Hour such a masterful film.

 When a director of obvious intellect develop his own highly personal and obvious style it bothers people. However, being bashed in the head isn't such a bad thing when it's done with such artistic expression and style. You have to want it, otherwise the ""Leeisms"" will become enough of an annoyance that one simply cannot enjoy the film. Park your prejudice and Lee frustrations at the door, however, and you're in for a noble, enlightening film that you cannot help being moved by.

 I don't understand all the complaints about the ""race rant"" in the men's room. Some complain that it has nothing to do with the story - or it's poorly placed in the picture. I can't think of a better place for it and feel the scene is placed there to do exactly what it does (for those who get it): shock and disturb - a jolting dose of reality and Norton's delivery of this monologue is as pungent as a Shakespearean soliloquy. This was the first scene I felt the tears welling up in my eyes as I recognized myself - and everyone else in the world (yes, you over there).

 The entire cast felt as though they'd been performing their roles onstage 8 shows a week, so perfect was the ensemble unity.

 Lee touches on so many issues in the microcosm that is New York, but that microcosm becomes universal.

 The penultimate scene is visionary, all dressed in white, and bathed in dreamlike light leading into the sobering reality of the finale. Lee makes the inevitable ending not only bearable, but believable and Norton's unusual protagonist becomes honorable.

1176217,5,B00000214T,"Spike Lee's film of Michael Benioff's novel 25th Hour is one of the strongest of the neo-noir films of the last few years, and one of the few films to address the corruption of dealing drugs and the breakdown of culture symbolized by the WTC site. Edward Norton plays Montgomery Brogan, a heroin dealer who must report to the Otisville Federal Prison in the morning.  Monty's life until this point has been a dream; he lives with a beautiful woman, drives a cool car, and gets into all the clubs, but financing this life is heroin and the Russian Mafia.

Edward Norton gives a typical strong performance - I'd love to see him and Johnny Depp in a film - making Monty a rich character who understands his own self-delusions. Barry Pepper and the ever wonderful Phillip Hoffman play Monty's more conventional friends, Slattery and Alinsky, the former a Wall-Street cowboy, and the latter a repressed English teacher in love with one of his students. Rosanna Dawson plays Monty's woman with understated power and sorrow.

Monty's final day of freedom plays out in clubs, parks, bars, and his memories, which Spike Lee weaves seamlessly in and out of the narrative, sparing us a moralistic explanation for Monty, a nice boy, ending up becoming a drug dealer, but showing us instead the parts of Monty's life that mean something to him: finding an abused pit bull, meeting Naturale, getting busted and interrogated by arrogant DEA agents.

The rant that Monty gives to his reflection is right out of David Benioff's book, nearly word-for-word, so stop blaming Spike Lee, and besides it's a great set piece, expressing Monty's self-loathing at the city which will go on despite him. Lee follows up this tour-de-force with all the people Monty cursed waving good-bye to him as he leaves New York, one of the most wonderful cinematic poems I've seen.

Monty is himself the City, broken, confused, and angry; beautiful, Monty wants to make himself ugly to protect himself from gang rape in prison, and he calls on his friends Slattery and Alinsky to beat him, horrifying them both.

Again, the flight of fantasy at the end of the film is right out of Benioff's book and not something Spike Lee made up, although Lee often extends the ends of his films (see Mo' Better Blues and Clockers), so Benioff's novel was right in keeping with Lee's style.

This is one of Spike Lee's best films, and it was totally disregarded at the box office, probably people want to pigeonhole Lee. But like all great artists, Spike Lee can transcend himself.  I believe 25th Hour will be remembered as a great American film in the years to come.

Note: I would recommend you read David Benioff's novel, but the film is taken right from the book with few amendations, and those small changes - emphasizing 9/11, making Monty's father a fireman - improve Benioff's book.",1091664000,68,2838,4.775510204081633

Spike Lee could to elevate the rank of this simply tale making a glorious art direction through unforgettable sequences without falling in the soap melodram .

Lee is very smart director but his approach to tell us a story employing skillyfully all the european taste and sublime expressiveness meant for him one of his most recognized works .

1176219,4,B00000214T,"After reading other opinions of what Norton's rant scene at his father's bar symbolized, I was compelled to share my perspective, since it is diametrically opposite.  I don't think this scene is racially motivated or much of an introspection.  I think that this is an individual that is venting his frustration on the city (and its inhabitants), his family, friends, and himself.  Everything that he knows in life has become disdainful to him (including religion).  This is a man that is staring at an abyss that constitutes seven years in a maximum security prison and is dealing with it in this scene by verbally lashing out.

Overall, I think that Norton's character was well developed, with the usual good performance one would expect from a quality actor.  However, I would have liked to gained more insight to some of the supporting roles, especially his girlfriend (Dawson) and his two best friends (Hoffman and Pepper).  The cinematography was quintessential Spike Lee, with some of his trademark shots (such as what is ostensibly a still shot of an individual with a fading background, indicating that this person is moving forward).  If you are a Spike Lee fan (which I am) or interested in New York culture, you will find this movie enjoyable.

I don't know what it is like in America, but if you were sentenced to jail for being a drug dealer in Australia, you would be kept in custody beforehand for weeks.
I have to admit it was difficult to feel compassion for Norton since his character is that of a drug dealer. Perhaps if he was being sentenced for something different, it might have helped gain my compassion.

This fact, along with the above Amazon review above, only go to show how completely the movies critics and funders missed the essential point of the work.  It's not a eulogy, not a touching portrait of New York as it once was, this is clearly the most political movie that Spike Lee has ever produced. If you don't scratch the surface, the movie makes little sense.  Ed Norton plays a drug dealer who gets caught and must decide if he will go to jail. The movie is really an allegory for the choice America must face: return to its idealistic roots, or enter a police state of violence and retribution. It's not surprising that everyone misses the point. The vocabulary of film does not employ allegory often, but in this instance, the allegory works precisely as a one-to-one correspondence between the characters in the film, and current events.  Once you have the key, this movie makes far more sense, and it's clear what about this movie makes you sad, and also clear that Spike Lee has produced the most powerful work about our current choice between Empire and Republic, and what to my mind is the best art about 9-11 made to date.",1080172800,10,1225,4.5590909090909095
1176226,4,B00000214T,"A sad, somber, comtemplative film about wasted lives and the end of life as we know it, set against the backdrop of post 9/11 New York City. There isn't that much of a plot, because the ending has already been established - Monty Brogan (Norton) has been convicted of dealing dope and is going to prison for 7 years. Nothing will change that, not even discovering who ratted him out. He spends his last night of freedom with his two best buddies - Jakob, an ineffectual English teacher (Hoffman) who's struggling with desire for one of his students, and Frank (Pepper), a cocky bond trader who's a ticking timebomb.
The film is right on the money in its exploration of powerlessness. A pair of soliloquys express the dual nature of this feeling - 1) Monty's foul-mouthed rant, while looking in a mirror, against pretty much everyone in New York and, ultimately, himself, and 2) Monty's father (Cox) daydreaming about how easy it would be for Monty to escape and begin a new life. Monty's chums, meanwhile, question their own roles in letting their friend go down the wrong path in life - and their own life paths aren't much wiser. The confusion and frustration never ceases, which is why the characters make conflicting statements, and yet they aren't being duplicitous. The characters aren't sure what to feel, what to do, or what to say to their convicted felon of a friend.
25th Hour is some of Spike Lee's best work - smoothly filmed, deliberately paced, seamless in it's transitions from past to present, and the bursts of anger, violence, and pure emotion in the film nearly leap off the screen. Good performances all around, particularly Norton's Monty - a good-spirited guy who's going down nonetheless - and Hoffman's pathetic Jakob. And Terrence Blanchard's score is as good as any I've heard in a film in years. How he didn't get any attention at Oscar time is beyond me.
There is no redemption for the characters in this film, only some release of anxieties and a gripping, pervasive sense of loss. I was stunned at how sad this film made me feel.",1079740800,3,2060,4.7091412742382275

But this Ed Norton is unique, and he chooses scripts that tell an important story. He is, in my view, one of the finest young actors to come along since Sidney Portier.
He doesn't push it, but is laid back and lets the action come to him. Norton is having his last night out before heading to prison. His lovely lady (the seductive Rosario Dawson)loves him and so do his buddies. He wants to do the right thing, but like Al Pacino in ""Godfather 3"" they keep trying to ""pull him back in."" Although this movie is tight from beginning to end, it is the flashback at movie's end which endears you to the lead character. Norton knows how to use facial expressions to fill up entire scenes, and has the smarts to know when to pull back from a scene and let the environment do the talking.
Great movies are difficult to describe because they transcend words. This movie, in being as unique as it is, falls within that category. Rent it and watch it. You might learn something about yourself.",1078099200,5,1131,4.416267942583732
1176229,3,B00000214T,"Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) is supposed to be a lovable drug dealer with whom we can sympathize.  In a series of flashbacks, we find out how he adopted his dog; how he met his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson); his long-standing friendships with Wall Streeter Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman); oh, and by the way, how he got busted with mega-dealer quantities of smack and cash.
But the story's foundation, it's reason for being, is the tale of Monty's last day of freedom before reporting to prison.  Grappling with issues like: who gave him up to the DEA and stressing about meeting the Russian mob boss who's demanded to see him before he leaves for the can.  The trouble is, despite Spike Lee's best efforts and the talented Mr. Norton, we just don't care.
The story could have been compelling, but there are too many things that don't work.  Barry Pepper is supposed to be Monty's best friend but is a completely hateful person. Philip Seymour Hoffman's considerable talents are put to no use here, playing a teacher that has all the charisma of a road sign.  NFL'er Tony Siragusa (Kostya) is not a professional actor and is out of his depth.  Rosaria Dawson is beautiful and talented -- but the story lets us not care about her whatsoever.
The best thing about the flick -- and truly, the only things worth watching -- are two solliloquies:  Norton's R-rated rant on New York while facing himself in the mirror... and his Father's beautiful, fictionalized account of now Monty could escape his fate.  Those two vignettes, occupying maybe five minutes of screen time total, made the movie for me.
In the end, it all just doesn't compute.  I think they should have called this flick ""Amnesia"".  You'll have forgotten the entire story by the next day.",1078012800,,1782,4.7752442996742674

I myself had some trouble with it for the first 15 minutes, it seemed to ramble, but I stayed with it because I admire Spike Lee's work.  I was also mesmerized by Terence Blanchard's score.  And it proved to be worth the hang.  First consider that it was adapted from a pre-9/11 novel that is New York City to its core.  Then consider that it's set in a post-9/11 New York City. Finally, consider that Benioff took his original story and adapted it to post-9/11 and then look beneath the surface of the story for the real story that is actually being told from this framework.  (The song over the closing credits should make it clear to the viewer, if it wasn't already.)  Benioff has written some sequences that made me hold my breath - the man is one of the best writers and slam poets out there.  The cinematography is all New York, both gritty and gorgeous, light and more light, and the key characters are all well-defined.  Edward Norton gives an underrated award-winning performance, and Brian Cox's supporting work was just as good.  Then Spike Lee takes all of this, with his some very good editors, and makes this joint unforgettable.  In 25 years, this movie will be regarded as a 9/11-era classic, and one of the finest memorials to a wounded and healing city that any movie director could make.  And, yes, go back and look at the rambling beginning and some of the other slower-paced portions of the film on a second screening, as I did, and you, too, will probably understand that they are actually there for a very good reason.
I love Spike Lee's Joints, and this is my favorite so far.  Don't expect an escapist good time, this is a thinking film, but, if you're a movie buff like me, it will make you think and feel things about New York and 9/11 that you maybe didn't realize you thought or felt.

""black people playing basketball and running 6 or 7 steps without dribbling the ball, orientals selling stacks of over-priced fruit....."" wow, controversial stuff there. this should have been a really good movie, but spike lee directed it. the usual scenes with bad music blaring way too loud, characters that are never developed, and speeches that go on and on but say....nothing.",1074902400,3,1397,4.796680497925311

It is done by Edward Nortons character of Monty, and in it he says something bad about probally every religion, race,and type of person that there is to make fun of. It was so powerfully moving, and it uses the f word a strong number of times. But the cursing doesn't matter because during the segment you can feel for the character of Monty, because I'm sure that everybody has had a comment to at least one of the people that Monty says something about.
The movie stars Edward Norton, Barry Pepper, Brian Cox, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Edward Norton plays Monty Brogon, who is a drug dealer that decided that he was going to be legit, but he was too late, as the cops discovered drugs in the padding of his couch. He decides to spend his last night of freedom with his two best friends Jacob and Frank, as well as his girlfriend Naturelle Riviera. Monty is not the only one going through problems. Jacob is a teacher who have a crush on one of his students Mary D' Annunzio, who enjoys flirting with him. Frank is an investing banker, who can't believe that Monty and Naturelle allowed the police to find the drugs. Monty starts off his evening by having dinner with his father, played by Brian Cox. He then goes to a nightclub with his friends, and he also meets his drug lord boss Uncle Nikolai. As the night grows old, Monty begins to wonder who is the one who turned him in to the cops, and he begins to get to the fact that he cannot rust anybody, not his friends, not his girlfriend, nobody that he knows, because any of them could be a traitor.
At the end of ""25th Hour"" you do find out who is the person that turned Monty in, and I was surprised. I am trying not to reveal anything that could ruin the movie, but the person who turned him in is the last person that I suspected. But as the night wore on and it was almost time for his to go to jail, I was interested. This movie was a seris of conversations between people. There was ten minute long conversations, five minute long conversations. But its through these conversations that you could determine who may have or may have not turned Monty in. I saw ""25th Hour"" about a year ago, and I loved it so much, that I remembered it to include it on my Top 10 List of 2003. See ""25th Hour"" and just listen to what the character's say. It's a brilliant film that I recommend.
Also see this movie for the preformances. I love Edward Norton as an actor, and thought his preformance in ""Death to Smoochy,"" showed that he could do comedy as well as hard drama like this. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great in this as he is in everything. ""Punch Drunk Love,"" ""Along Came Polly,"" ""Almost Famous,"" and many other titles stand under his name. He is a brilliant actor that should get more respect, especially in this movie. Edward Norton should have won Best Actor during the Oscars last year for this. The is a classic film. A+!

Spike Lee uses Edward Norton as a vehicle to push his usual politics and vent his many frustrations. The most obvious example of this is the monologue in front of the mirror. His outburst seemed totally unprovoked and out of character. I found it hard to care about Norton's character, and at times I even forgot about him.

There's a beautifully acted bathroom scene, a soliloquy  in which Monty pours out his heart to his own image in the mirror - that alone might garner as Oscar nomination.

But, much more than that, ""25th hour"" is a sensible movie about feelings of loss and impotence. Action is practically non-existent, and it should be that way. What makes it great is the dialogue between the interesting and different characters, always dense, tense and moody.
On top of that, Spike Lee created an ""open"" movie, instead of his previous and most famous movies dealing with close subjects, which, for me, was a great development. And he took his time to make the movie. All characters have lots of time on screen, creating very well-developed relationship situations.

1176239,5,B00000214T,"This is probably Spike Lee's best movie, and that is saying something. The direction is amazazing, but the acting!!! The acting in this movie defies description, it is that good. Lee has taken it to another level with this movie, no preaching, just the truth. Hey, I even agreed with the preaching in Spike Lee's earlier movies, but I just felt that with this movie he had made a huge leap, this movie is deep, it will haunt you long after you finish watching it. It stays with you. This movie is depressing and upsetting, the characters are so well drawn that they seem like real people. Monty is sympahtic, but lets rememer he was not selling pot, LSD, or even coke. He was selling herion, which is the worst drug behind Crystal Meth and Crack. No one holds the moral highground in this movie, deeply flawed but lovable characters interact in scenes that are so realistic it is scary. Barry Pepper, we need to see more of you!! Everything you are in you are great, the sniper in Saving Private Ryan, etc. WOW!!!! Pepper's acting in this movie might even be better than Norton's. He plays a trader?/broker?/investor? for an investment bank on wall street. It does not really matter what his job title is, he is a professional gambler walking on a tightrope with no safety net in the chaos of the free market at its worst. In this movie he basically play Gorden Gecho's heir apparent. He is likeable but arrogant. He has a mean streak but he also has a big heart that hides under his shark persona, like Monty he is complex, but unlike Monty he never sold death. His job is certanily not moral, but neither is it downright evil. The only charcter in the film who could be described as moral is Philip C. Hoffman who plays Monty's childhood friend that has now become a school teacher. Hoffman is a bumbling clutz, but he is also intelligent and insightful, with a more balanced view of life than either Monty or Pepper's character has. Hoffman's character is understated, he has a crush on one of his students. So even he has his dark side. Monty's father was some sort of degenerate gambler who got into debt to a mobster, part of the reason Monty sold herion was to get him out of that debt. Monty's father bears responsiblity for what happens and he knows it, the guilt is eating him alive. Dawson plays Monty's Peurto Rican girlfriend who he suspects sold him out to the cops. She is one of Lee's favorite actors and demonstrates why in this movie, she went along with the easy drug money because it was convienent, she too bears partial responsiblity for what occured. Tony Saragusa plays a russian mobster and suprise, he can actually act!!! That is the set up of the characters, on to the plot. Monty has been busted for dealing herion, the cops come to his door and search his home, although they knew where to look, for the drugs. They find a kilo of herion. Monty is going to have to go to prison for seven years. Who betryaed him? That is a question that runs throughout the movie, but it is eventually answered. But that is just a subplot. The focus of this film is on the relationships between Monty and his two childhood friends, Pepper and Hoffman. They spend Monty's last day of freedom together waiting for the ax to fall. The supsense is suffacoting as the tension steadily builds. There is no escape, after the night is over Monty must go to prison. This movie is very, very, very, intense. Monty and his two friends try to go out and have a good time but that is impossible. What can you say to make Monty feel better? Nothing. Althoug these three might all be friends only Monty is going to prison in the morning, Pepper and Hoffman will go back to their lives. That is an unbridgeable gulf between them, an abyss that widens more and more as the night goes on. Monty is doomed, they are not, what chance does friendship have in those circumstances. NONE!!! They are little more than mourners at Monty's funeral. This movie feels so REAL, the fear begins to eminate of Monty is sickening waves, it is like he is waiting to be executed, but really it is almost worse. It is not living in a cell or getting beat up in prison that Monty truly fears, it is getting raped. It is inveitable, he is small and white, he will be raped, reapeatadly, probably every day, for the entire seven years, if he lasts that long. If that is not cruel and unusual punishment I don't know what is. Monty deseves to be punished, but no one deserves that!!! The fact that Monty is soon going to be gang raped by convicts understandably casts a pall on the evening. Monty does not deserve it, but as Clint Eastwood said ""deserves got nothing to do with it."" Really Monty just choose the wrong hustle, Pepper is a legal hustler and that is why he will not go to prison. This movie is painful to watch, you will wonder about Monty's fate for weeks after you have wathced the movie, even though you know he is a fictional character. This is the most powerful movie I have seen in a while, it takes a serious emotional toll on the viewer. This movie is a throwback to older movies from the 60s and 70s where chacters and acting made movies, not special effects. This movie also contains one of the best monalouges in movie history the f$$k this city and everyone in it speech into the bathroom mirror, if you are not from NYC that speech might to make sense to you but if you are from NYC, you will get it because he will articulate some of your private, repressed prejudices. Since I am Irish like Monty he did not offend me, but I am sure he offended everone else. This is one of the best movies of recent years, although if you are depressed or get depressed easily I would not recomend it.",1069718400,5,5686,4.426526717557252
1176240,3,B00000214T,"Spike Lee's self concious stylishness always seems at cross purposes with his subject matter. Here, irritating colour filters, jump cuts, floating actors, etc. One poignant discussion between two friends looking down at some building works has it's dialogue drowned by strings climaxing with a chorus of mother superior having an epileptic fit in her bathtub. This artifice will always drag his work down into superficiality. Pity.
According to the special features this is about the 9/11. Must have missed that. Since Norton was delivering an acidic diatribe against New Yorkers, wouldn't he say ""and all you grief junkies with your maudlin shrines, a couple of buildings fell down, get over yourselves!"" Rather than have a go at Bin Laden? Not like Spike to duck controversy. Norton needs to do something a little less Nortony, too.
There's a scene in a toilet between a college professor and his student that I just couldn't watch for squirming. There's some forced melodrama towards the end. Don't get me wrong, this is better than Summer Of Sam by a long chalk.",1068163200,3,1066,5.028248587570621
1176241,5,B00000214T,"When the movie first started I was very emotional to see the two lights replacing the Twin Towers - automatically I was sent back to 9/11's tragedy. I had to cry........ I thought I've seen the helpless victims again waving white clothes to indicate to helpless viewers that Help is needed. Gosh..... We will remember 9/11 but its difficult to go back there. It's just too sad. Anyways, the movie didn't turn up to be what I've expected. I got so confused and very bored by unneccesary long scenes. What I liked the most about the movie was when Monty had the dialogue with himself in front of the mirror. It's true there were FU's but there is a powerful message in those swearings I believe.
""When in Rome do as Romans do (and I'll add this myself) and love Romans too"". In 25-th hour Romans are Americans! and...(un)fortunetaly Monty's accusations were right!!! And if people come up with thoughts that ""Monty is a racist"" then they should think again ""Who is a racist?!?"" Monty or themselves! because -
IF you're gonna chose U.S.A. as your country then you must love, work and protect U.S.A's interests by all means. If you're only after U.S. dollars then go to your own country as there'll be more ways you can make them. Yeah, simple as that.
Appreciation, that's what is needed from people Monty is mad at.
So appreciate U.S.A., learn English, think American and behave CIVILISED so then you can avoid getting offended in movies such as 25-th hour.
After all 25-th hour is a long movie and rather ""boring"" but it's worth watching it.",1067904000,2,1540,4.624087591240876
1176242,3,B00000214T,"The 25th Hour is really two movies awkwardly pasted together: one is a gritty street fable about trust and loyalty, the other is a sensitive portrait of post-9/11 New York. It is a weird combination of subject matter; it almost seems like Spike Lee felt obligated to throw an NYC tribute into his film at the last minute, and this makes the story uneven and unclear.
Luckily, everyone in the cast has enough skill to make up for the aspects that Lee abandoned. Edward Norton gives depth to even the most poorly developed characters, and his Monty is no exception. Apparently Monty is arrested for selling drugs, and must report to prison in 24 hours, and that is the extent to which his life of crime is revealed. His girlfriend Naturelle, played by Rosario Dawson, is a sweet Puerto Rican girl whom Monty's friends blame for his arrest. His best friends are as confused and uncertain as he is, and so Monty's father ends up being his true confidant and savior.
One of Monty's friends, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is a clumsy high school English teacher with a crush on one of his students. This is a potentially interesting storyline that doesn't really go anywhere. Anna Paquin does a great job of portraying an aggressively flirtacious teenager, but her prescence is never quite defined. The scenes where Monty curses the people of New York and where his father gives him advice on starting over, could have been brilliant but seem out of place and preachy.
This is the first Spike Lee film I have ever seen, but already I feel like he gives his agenda more screen time than his characters. I know that there is racism in New York, but it does not seem necessary to go through every ethnic stereotype that exists in the five bouroughs. I guess the fact that Naturelle was immediately distrusted reflects prejudice toward Hispanic people, but this is only a small facet of the story. It's not a movie about racism. Then again, I don't really know what this movie is supposed to be about. Had Spike Lee spent more time on the plot and less time on expressing his principles, I'm sure this would have been a better film.",1067904000,,2126,4.626984126984127

It's just a great spike lee movie and you have to apprecaite the way he does this, bringing in the footage of ground zero in new york. Norton and Barry Pepper give the best performances in here, especially when Norton wants Pepper to beat him up before he goes into the prison for 7 years, and that scene is filled with so much power and emotion I thought it was the powerfulest moment in the picture. a must see for anyone who likes any of the people in the movie and its on my top 20 favorite",1065052800,2,765,4.072847682119205

This is the situation for me.  I rented the 25th Hour intrigued at the thought of a movie based on a man's last day before he went to jail.  While I didn't expect a movie that would play a dilema out like this with a upbeat and positive lets-have-the-night-of-our-lives attitude, I also did not expect the languid, morbid pace of the movie.
There were touching moments in the movie.  Edward Norton's connection to his best friends is strong, and the last moments that they share together prove not to be moments where your friend can fill you with thoughtful speeches, but moments of pain, where friends honestly don't know what more they can do for you.
But altogether the movie made a horrible impression to me.  The scenes dragged on unusually long, and the score for the movie didn't fit well with it at all.  Edward Norton, an unusully supurb actor who can fill characters with depth, found himself with a character that was not complete.  Monty lacked a real conscience. His struggle against time and right-and-wrong really seemed rather shallow because the character had no conviction.
All in all, I don't recommend you taking the time to watch this movie...",1064620800,6,1388,4.710743801652892

1176246,2,B00000214T,"Overall, a mixed bag. I didn't know a lot about about the movie before watching the DVD, but based on the film critics' blurbs on the jacket, it looked promising. There are definitely things I liked about the movie, the acting being the main part. Ed Norton gives a great performance as Monty, a drug dealer who has only 24 hours of freedom before going to prison, and is easily the best thing in this movie. Most of the supporting cast give good performances as well, especially Anna Paquin whose role is unlike any other one she has done. However, her character doesn't really advance the story, which is the main problem with this movie.
The script tends to meander, with plot lines that seem to have little to do with the main story. One example of this is the scene in a bathroom mirror where a pseudo Monty unleashes a tirade against minorities. Well acted by Norton, but excuse me, what does this have to do with the plot? It comes out of nowhere and nothing in the movie suggests that race was the reason why Monty is in trouble. So the scene, although interesting, seems badly out of place (it would've worked great in ""American History X"").
Another aspect that bothered me were the references to Ground Zero. Yes, 9/11 touched all our lives and it's part of the fabric of NYC, but to include gratuitous shots of Ground Zero just because a character happens to live right next door to it was frankly, in my opinion, exploitive. Except for this character and Monty's father, a former fire fighter who now owns a bar, there were no other apparent connections with any of the other characters, including the main character Monty, to the events of 9/11. Yet when Spike Lee opens the film with shots of the NYC skyline, with the twin beams of light shining into the night, the viewer might think that the events of 9/11 would somehow factor into the plot. But it doesn't and to see multiple shots of Ground Zero that have absolutely nothing to do with the story was completely unnecessary.
I really wanted to like this movie, but because of a plot that doesn't seem to go anywhere, I can't recommend this movie.",1063756800,3,2115,4.539267015706806
1176247,4,B00000214T,"Spike Lee's latest, ""25th Hour,"" is his best movie in years, but like every movie he's ever made, it's a mixed bag that's often brilliant but occasionally frustrating.
  ""25th Hour"" tells the story of Monty Brogan (Edward Norton), an upscale heroin dealer who's been busted and has one day of freedom left before he's off to serve a seven-year prison sentence. While the clock ticks, Monty gets together with his friends and family and tries to brace himself.
 The story is set against the backdrop of New York not long after 9/11, a setting that makes the tale far more resonant but also threatens to diminish Monty's plight. Who do we feel more sympathy for: Monty, a pampered criminal whose good times have dried up, or his best friend, a law-abiding citizen whose apartment windows look directly down onto the cold grim wound of Ground Zero?
  Spike Lee is one of the best directors working today and parts of ""25th Hour"" are astounding: a stunning opening credits sequence depicting the ghostly Tower Lights Memorial; a sad and funny scene in which a man saves the life of an injured dog; an angry rant against New York that turns into a detailed love letter to the city and its people; mesmerizing shots in which two actors appear to levitate across a barroom. These and many of the movie's other ingredients are further proof of Lee's genius as a filmmaker.
  On the other hand, there are a lot of things in ""25th Hour"" that don't work. As always, Lee's ambition sabotages him; he tries to tell too much story and as a result, some of the characters and their subplots get shortchanged. Terrence Blanchard's score is haunting and powerful, but is occasionally too big and bombastic for the scenes. And a long, strange
""is-this-real-or-is-it-a-dream?"" finale feels like bootlegged John Steinbeck and doesn't really work.
  But there's no denying the movie's strengths. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (""Amores Perros,"" ""8 Mile"") is dark and beautiful and the film looks like it's been submerged in India ink and then hastily rinsed off (that's a compliment).
  Norton, as always, turns in a smart performance and there are inspired supporting turns by Anna Paquin, Barry Pepper, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brian Cox and a fine debut by former Baltimore Ravens defensive nose tackle Tony Siragusa as Norton's Ukranian sidekick.
  But mostly, ""25th Hour"" succeeds as a New Yorker's portrait of his wounded hometown not long after it suffered unspeakable hardships. Lee's storytelling skills may fail him from time to time, but his eye - which captures faces and flags and rubble and skylines and shrines to fallen firefighters with heartbreaking precision - always sees true.
  The DVD includes two reserved but insightful commentaries by Spike Lee and by David Benioff (who wrote the screenplay, based on his novel); ""Evolution of an American Filmmaker,"" a detailed documentary about Lee's career; ""Ground Zero,"" a collection of clinical first- and second-unit shots of the World Trade Center site; and several deleted scenes, many of which -- particularly ""Sway"" are quite good and would've added to the final cut.",1063065600,12,3123,5.001930501930502

I think this is, in many respects, a beautiful movie. There are many flaws in it. I think some of the more un-emotional parts are over-dramatized and vice versa. Also, the movie does go to long. I say it weighs 50/50... the things I like and don't like. The things I do like are really good. And I think it's worth watching. Once. Norton is good in it.

1176249,5,B00000214T,"This Spike Lee film is a hard-edged story of a convicted drug dealer on the last day before he has to serve a 7-year prison sentence.  Edward Norton stars in this role and brings all his excellent acting talents to the task of taking a long last look at the New York City he loves as well as the important people in his life.  There's his girlfriend, played by Rosario Dawson, who just might be the person who betrayed him to the cops. There's his father, played by Brian Cox, who blames himself for his son going astray.  There are his two best friends, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper, who know that their friend will never be the same again.  Add a couple of Russian gangsters to this mix, as well as a precocious teenager, played by Anna Paquin, whose seductiveness tempts Philip Seymour Hoffman into making an unwise decision, and the scene is set for an intriguing, fast-paced film.
I liked the theme, which was about being responsible for the consequences of your actions, and I liked Spike Lee's interpretation of it.  I especially liked some of his film techniques.  Sometimes the colors are altered to show the main characters bathed in blue.  And, during the sequences that get inside Norton's mind, the colors are glaring neon.  This adds to the interest and the edginess of the film.
The story is easy to relate to.  The characters are real.  The acting is the finest that the film industry has to offer.  And there's a director who has his own personal style of bringing it all to life. You can't go wrong with that combination.

1176250,4,B00000214T,"A Film by Spike Lee
Montgomery Brogan (Edward Norton) is facing a seven year jail term after being caught by the DEA for dealing drugs.  This movie is his last 24 hours of freedom before he has to go to prison (for some reason he gets to bring himself to prison when the day ends).  He contacts his two friends: Jacob Elinski (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a teacher with an unhealthy interest in his student Mary (Anna Paquin); and Frank Slaughtery (Barry Pepper), a stock broker who thinks too much of his abilities and too little of the money of his clients.  The three of them will get together later that night along with Monty's girlfriend, Naturelle Riviera (Rosario Dawson).
The film spends its time examing who Monty is.  He's a man who rescues a dog that was abused and left for dead, but he is also a drug dealer with no pity for someone whom he helped become a junkie.  We see how he relates to his girlfriend on his last day of freedom, as well as what his relationships are like with his best friends, and what they think of him.  Throughout the movie, Monty is re-evaluating his life and what he has done in his life (many bad things).  He has to decide how he wants to spend the rest of his life and what kind of man he wants to be.  Spike Lee does not give us an answer on whether or not Monty is a good man (or if we should think that he is), but rather leaves the question for us to answer if Monty is doing the right thing throughout the movie.  25th Hour offers condemnation without judgment, if such a thing really is possible.
This movie also is the first one that I have seen that addresses a post-September 11th New York.  The opening credit montage has some fairly mournful music that both sets the tone for the movie as well as touching upon the terrorist attacks.  The blue lights that we see are the spotlights that shine in the New York skyline in place of the towers.  There are also small touches throughout the movie about post 9/11 New York.  One of the best sequences in the movie is one where Monty is cursing all of New York, going down a list of stereotypes and realities before he gets to other things that he hates (including Osama Bin Laden) and concluding with himself.  It is a beautifully written, if vulgar, speech.  It is the money shot of the movie.
This is an excellent movie (excellence in filmmaking), but it is not a great one.  I don't know quite what the distinction is, but that as much as I like the movie, 25th Hour did not move me.  I would recommend this movie to fans of Spike Lee and drama, in general, but I would not recommend this movie without reservations.",1061769600,2,2616,4.327868852459017

I actually watched it all the way through with the directors commentary on, which I have never done after watching a movie once. In this movie about drug dealers, russian gangsters, police raids, and murder, there is not one chase scene, and not one murder.  This is an emotion film relying on the intelligence of the watcher to bring it together.  You really feel for Monty (Norton) in this film, knowing that he's got 24 hours left before surrendering to 7 years in prison.  The film is not constructed as a ""yepee for drug dealers"" flick, but you feel for him in that he knows that he messed up, and the show of regret in his face is very powerful.  Anyone who has ever done anything they regreted (everyone) will really feel this.  Watch the deleted scenes.

The movie focuses on Monty's last night before going to prison for seven years.  It explores how his going up affects the lives of his two best friends, his father, and his girlfriend.  The movie reminded me a great deal of Meet Joe Black.  The two movies have vastly different topics, but each one has rich, fully realized scenes.  Norton and Hopkins take each scene and wring every emotional shred from it.  Their facial expressions and body language leave you feeling the dread that they are burdened with.  Monty's impending imprisonment becomes overpowering by the end of the movie and I was close to tears from pity for him.
The film quality of the DVD is a little spotty.  Some scenes looked really grainy with a lot of noise in them.  The audio however is among the best I have ever heard.  There is a scene in which the group is at a posh nightclub, and the pounding bass heavy music such places typify is expertly captured on this disc.

He keeps things reasonably low-key, letting the power of the story speak for itself until the inevitable Spike Lee Moment--Monty's infamous love/hate letter to NYC, still far more effective than it should be thanks to Norton's delivery--and largely avoiding his favorite themes. Even the determinedly post-9/11 scenes and dialogue are tastefully done, and serve as a metanarrative that is constantly played against Monty's story to remind us of the personal Ground Zeroes that we all have to face sometime.
Norton is one of the strongest conflicted-wimp leads out there right now, and he manages to hold our attention in every frame in the same mysterious way that he usually does. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper play off of each nicely as Norton's no-longer-compatible best friends, and lovely Rosario Dawson breaks our hearts several times over as the did-she-or-didn't-she girlfriend. Anna Paquin is the same little tart that she has been all of her career--not that there's anything wrong with that.
The ending, taken almost directly from the book, is especially powerful and will be on your mind for days. This is a very effective film, and easily one of the best of 2002.",1060214400,,1261,5.096618357487923

1176257,5,B00000214T,"25th Hour is a true poem about America and New York after the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001.  It's not gung-ho, as the country was in attacking Afghanistan and Iraq.  And it's not very mourning, either.  It's almost this centuries equivalent of the city symphonies of the tens and twenties.
But all that 9/11 stuff tends to bog me down in political and sociological discussions that I have come to abhor.  Throw all of that aside, and this is a great movie.  Every performance, minus that of the wasted Rosario Dawson, is incredible.  Brian Cox cemented himself in my mind as one of the finest actors in the world.
Spike Lee is up to his usual camera tricks, and its great when you recognize them--I broke onto Spike (not TV) Lee about three years ago, after hating him for the first decade and a half of my life.  On a side note, you should check out bamboozled, another fabulous societal movie, which recieved about the same welcome as this film.

The film stands out in the way of sheer craftsmanship even without the 9/11 symbolism; by now, Spike Lee knows how to work his style to the fullest, and even if this is a low-key, non-political film (by his standards), it's still powerful.  The editing and acting are second to none, with honourable mentions going out to Norton, Barry Pepper, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and a special mention for Brian Cox, who's always great.

So, he walks his dog, tries to piece together who turned him in, and he rants and philosophizes with those around him.  The destruction of 9/11 seems to be a theme, albeit a disjointed one, and I think I'm supposed to sympatize with Monty by the end of the movie as he heads off to the big house.  However, I didn't sympathize or feel much for any of the characters.  They forgot a few things -- a plot, for one.  Edward Norton's talent can't save a bad script, unfortunately.  The attempts to add interest by repeating the scene with a half a second delay every once and a while doesn't work and is annoying.  Through the entire movie, there's a sense that they're trying to recreate the ""Royal with Cheese"" moment from Pulp Fiction, but it never materializes.

1176263,4,B00000214T,"Being of huge fan of Spike Lee's, ""Do The Right Thing"" I picked up this movie the other day b/c it was a movie I wanted to see, but never took the time to go see it in the theater.  My friends saw it and had mixed feelings, but I wanted to judge it for myself.  And I got what I expected.  Well, mostly.
The characters in the story are the best part of the movie, as each actor/actress handles their roles with true abandon.  But Barry Pepper definately overshadows any of the other actor's performance.  This guy is great and where I was disappointed with ""Knock-Around Guys"" (mainly because of pace), this movie finally depicted the true talents and lead-quality that Barry Pepper has had all along.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was great as well, although I felt that Spike Lee forgot to continue on with his development about two-thirds into the movie.  And Edward Norton always delivers.  Always.
Even with that out-of-place monologue that took me by suprise  (This is the segue into all my criticisms). I just got the impression that Spike Lee was trying too hard.  It was a nifty idea, but the timing seemed off.  The actors carried themselves, but it was the editing of this movie that brought it down.  In the beginning, there is an unbelievable amount of discontinuity.  I could see how there could be a point to doing this, as to express the discontinuity of New York after 9/11....but if this was the case...it was poorly executed.  The beginning is discontinuous...the middle of the movie is normal...and the end of the movie starts with the discontinuity again....it's baffling!  And I don't think that by doing this, any meaning was expressed except ""bad editing"".  At least that's what I first thought.  I swear I was having deja vu about 20 times in the movie.
Despite all this and some bad overdubbing (the apartment scene, Edward Norton's voice is off with his mouth when he tells the cop to sit down)...this movie was overall enjoyable.  But I suggest you watch another Spike Lee movie before renting this...to get a flavor of his style and modes of expression.  But if you are an Edward Norton, Barry Pepper, or Philip Seymour Hoffman fan, I think it's safe to recommend this to you.",1057795200,,2199,4.650259067357513
1176264,5,B00000214T,"Spike Lee's latest, 25th Hour is a 5-star winner. Focusing on drug dealer Monty's last day of freedom before going to prison, the film carefully weaves in background stories from his past and that of his girlfriend and two best guy friends from childhood. It's a post-9/11 saga of New York, full of sadness and helplessness - and rage. There's a beautifully acted bathroom scene, a soliloquy  in which Monty pours out his heart to his own image in the mirror - that alone might garner as Oscar nomination. For me, the mark of a good movie is one in which every character undergoes some significant, if small, change - and 25th Hour scores A+
Terrific in every way.",1057276800,,664,4.579831932773109
1176265,5,B00000214T,"""The 25th Hour"" has all the elements of an excellent film, and it doesn't let them go to waste. It deals with a simple yet difficult question that not many of us are ever faced with; how would you spend your last 24 hours of freedom? This is a question that Monty Brogan is unlucky enough to be faced with.
The story follows Monty on his last day of freedom, as he says his last good byes to his father, his best friends, his business associates, and his girlfriend. After being busted for dealing heroine, Monty is sentenced to 7 long, painful years in prison. He spends his last day with the people who mean the most to him. He meets his 2 best friends, Jacob and Frank (portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper), and his girlfriend Naturelle (portrayed by Rosario Dawson), at a night club in NYC, where he is also supposed to meet his boss for one last time.
As many reviewers have pointed out, the film is set in a post 9/11 New York City. This part of the film worried me at first because I was afraid that it would take center stage over the story, but the 9/11 aspect isn't overly prominent in the plot and doesn't interfere with the other parts of the movie. I thought that director Spike Lee did a good jod of giving the attention to this subject that it deserved (particularly in the scene in Franks apartment that overlooks ground zero), but without allowing it to over shadow the story.
This film features excellent performances from all cast members, especially Norton. His portrayal of Monty is absolutely stunning. Norton portrays the character as a man who is being sent to his own personal hell within just a few hours. You can see Monty's guilt about what he's done, but you can also see his anger towards the circumstances that lead him to his decisions. This is shown most clearly in the ""F**k You"" monologue in the bathroom of his father's bar, where Monty proceeds to attack anyone and everyone who he feels are in some way responsible for the situation he is in, but in the end, he blames himself.
Philip Seymour Hoffman also gives a stellar performance as Monty's friend Jacob. Jacob is a high school English teacher who has an interest in one of his students (Anna Paquin) that is slightly more than educational. Hoffman does a wonderful job at showing Jacob's inner conflict. On one hand, Jacob has this attraction to his student, while on the other he has his career and his reputation for being relatively straight laced.
Rosario Dawson also turns in a great performance as Monty's girlfriend Naturelle. She feels guilty about never making Monty give up his criminal life, but she also feels that it was his life and he had to make his own choices. Frank feels much the same way about this. He feels that he should've done something to stop Monty and deals with the same guilt that Naturelle has, all though he also feels more hostility towards Monty than any other character, shown in the scene in his apartment where he tells Jacob that Monty got what he deserved. It doesn't seem like any other character in the movie thinks that Monty has really even done anything wrong. Illegal, yes, but not neccessarily wrong. Monty provided a service to people who wanted it, and as Frank says, he might have made a profit off the potential suffering of others, but no more than a clerk at a convenience store profits off cigarette sales that give people cancer. I thought that the film did an excellent job at showing this without glorifying drug dealing.
The direction from Lee is also remarkable. The camera work is good, especially considering that he worked with a different director of photography on this film than he normally does (I think). He seems to understand Monty's inner conflict and shows it very well. The editing is also very good in this film. Some may say that it's too long, but I didn't really think so, all though I do prefer longer movies anyway.
All things considered, this is a very interesting movie. It deals with choice in a different way than any other movie I've seen. It shows the perks of the choices that Monty makes, but ultimately shows the consequences. I highly reccomend it.",1056844800,3,4146,4.5889487870619945
1176266,4,B00000214T,"I loved Spike Lee's ""The 25th Hour"" and consider it to be one of his finest films - which says a lot. Truthfully, Mr. Lee has never made a film which I did not like, and would rank ""The 25th Hour"" just a few notches below ""Do the Right Thing,"" ""Malcolm X"" and ""Clockers."" But it's still a brilliant, at times innovative, work blessed with superb protrayals, an electric eye for NY locale and heartbreaking angst.
I doubt Spike Lee will ever make a true box office hit - he's just not in to postcards or happy endings. There's always a slight hint of rage beneath the surface, explosive in nature, waiting to break out. Vent, baby vent.
Norton's rap during the bathroom scene has been done before in previous Lee films, but in the wake of 9-11, it's perhaps more relevant than ever. The multiple scenes of improvisation also ring a familiar chord, but as a viewer we are witnessing the creative process on screen. I understand why some viewers would consider these scenes ""lazy,"" since it goes against the grain of Hollywood formula filmmaking. But there's an uncomfortable reality to these scenes, developing personality and providing clues to the ultimate rage the characters suffer from.
The performances are uniformly superb. Edward Norton, in a largely passive role, has 24 hours of freedom remaining before taking the long trip to prison for dope dealing. He gathers his circle of childhood friends, among them a Wall Street trader (Barry Pepper) and a sexually frustrated school teacher (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), for one final night of camaraderie at a NY nightclub. During the evening, each character will reveal their frustrations, their lives defined by lost dreams and disappointments. Uncomfortably resting within the missing shadows of the World Trade Center, their angst is seemingly rooted in opportunities lost. These moments ring with emotional truth, equally haunting and heartbreaking.
I found the scenes with the Russian Mafia to be far too cliched, where shadowed criminals spout passages of pseudo street wisdom to cheer up Norton's doomed character. I expected Marlon Brando to make an appearance adorned in tuxedo, with a mouth full of kleenex.
""The 25th Hour"" has so much to do with regret and loss. In some way, each character has exploited freedoms which exist in our unique American society. In some way, they have abused the ideal. Following the terrorist bombings of NY, there are now emotional debts which must be paid. Like Edward Norton's character at the end of ""The 25th Hour,"" we are battered and bruised. Our crimes perhaps rooted in having taken our utopia for granted.",1056844800,2,2607,4.967963386727689
1176267,5,B00000214T,"I watched this not expecting much and was left with my jaw hanging. This is everything a movie should be. A perfect cast, a simple story bringing out complex emotions, both in the characters and the viewers, originality, creativity, a gem of a scenario and the right tone throughout. It left me with a sense of completeness as if everything had been said that needed to be said.  I cannot believe it went virtually unnoticed by critics and viewers alike. Such simple, crafted work deserves Oscar attention. The antidote to Hollywood's excess.",1056672000,2,542,4.891304347826087
1176268,5,B00000214T,"I went to see this movie at the theatre originally purely because it had Edward Norton in it, but by the time I'd left it had become my favourite movie of the year.  The basic premise seems simple enough - repentant former drug dealer Monty (Norton) has 24 hours left before he's hauled back into prison after the police raid his apartment - but it's the small nuances in the plot, the performances, direction and look of the film that make it so worthwhile.  This isn't simply another hug-and-be-happy movie where Monty merely realises his wrongs and accepts his punishment; this is a hard abrasive picture that makes you remember in equal measures why you can both love and detest life at the same time.
Edward Norton gives his best performance since his tour de force in American History X, which will surely come as a relief to fans who saw him so underused in box office success Red Dragon.  He really makes you believe that he is a man with emotional scars, a dealer whose life has caught up with him and he realises it instinctively before it's there.  There's also a spotlight-grabbing performance from Josie and the Pussycats actress Rosario Dawson, who proves that she's more than capable of transforming herself from child to adult actor.  Coincidentally, there's another actress who's done just that, Anna Paquin, who also appears as a student of Monty's best friend (played by the ubiquitous Phillip Seymour Hoffman).  This is a much more exuberant role than her restrained yet still equally impressive performance as Rogue in the X-Men movies.
A lot has been made of the fact that The 25th Hour is the first movie to really deal with a New York post-September 11th.  This worried me significantly prior to seeing it mainly due to a concern that it may handle a sensitive subject in a fashion that may offend it audience.  However, the film mostly seems to have a kind of quiet melancholy personified in Monty as the camera pans over the wasteland of Ground Zero.  In many ways this is a hauntingly beautiful look at an America that seems all but broken, where any glimmers of hope seem unrealistic and fragile.  The 25th Hour always has anger bubbling under its surface, that explodes fairly early in the movie with Monty's diatribe against minority groups, an assault that is actually aimed at himself and something that deserves a piece of classic movie history.  Understandably this is a controversial movie and it's easy to see why given its subject, but it's also dazzlingly brilliant in places and even now remains my favourite film of the year.",1055548800,2,2565,4.767494356659142
1176269,4,B00000214T,"No one can argue that the two most prolific directors in American movies today are Woody Allen and Spike Lee. But while Allen has spent the past 30 years making the same movie over and over (and over) again, Lee continues to try new things and explore new ideas. Lee may occasionally stumble, but no filmmaker today tackles social issues and human conflict, and the dynamic between the two better than Lee. He is the best director working in America right now, and he's the best filmmaker of his generation. The fact that he is more famous for being a Knick fan than for his film work is a crime, but it doesn't seem to discourage Lee at all.
Take, for example, 25th Hour. Lee is incorrectly reviled by many for being a race baiter. But if he is, would he be making a movie where a black cop harasses a white drug dealer? 25th Hour explores the saga of Monty (Edward Norton) not through some sort of Al Sharpton-colored lens. Instead, it's a carefully woven tale of one man's life and friendships dissolving in a post-9/11 New York that is coming apart itself. The feeling of sadness, anger, rage, and helplessness all felt after 9/11 echo in Monty's anger at both himself and others for his predicament. The celebration that is supposed to be Monty's last night as a free man all too realistically becomes the final cutting of relationship threads that had been slowly fraying for years. Norton's performance displays both anger and ambivalence, particularly in his notorious bathroom rant. Rather than show Monty's tirade as nothing but pure ugliness, Lee turns it into a moment of catharsis before Monty takes responsibility for his own actions. It's natural to lash out at others before finally turning the microscope on yourself, and Monty does it in a private moment designed to provoke himself and no one else. It's a fascinating sequence, and worth seeing 25th Hour for by itself.
But there are other reasons - Barry Pepper, in particular. Pepper, who should have gotten an Oscar nomination, gives a pitch-perfect performance as a hardened young man who's not as indestructible as he thinks he is, even when he's assaulting another man in a gut-wrenching final sequence. As we see Pepper's shell erode, he becomes more recognizable, more human. And he ends up earning our empathy, which seems impossible in the beginning of the movie.
Lee also films New York City better than anyone in the movies today. This is a New York movie - exploring every nuance in the city with 9/11 still, sometimes literally, in the backdrop. Even when the story meanders, Lee always gives you something to look at.
If the end of 25th Hour feels like a copout, it's because it is one of those films, like Cast Away, that condemns itself to an ending that won't please everyone. But even in that moment there is a glimmer of hope that Lee wants to take away from the bleakness of both Monty's life and New York City. As Jimmy Breslin said in Summer of Sam, New York City is a town that you ""both love and hate equally"". Spike Lee seems to feel the exact same way, and it's that idea - along with its personification in Monty - that makes 25th Hour so compelling.",1055462400,7,3147,4.631484794275492
1176270,5,B00000214T,"This movie, Spike Lee's latest offering, is essentially his offering to New York as a parting gift. If you allow yourself to be immersed in the movie then you'll find yourself overtaken by it. The colours, the characters, the story, the pace, the music - all are brilliantly balanced by the director to make this one of the best movies to come out of 2002.
The characters that Lee (and the writer of the screenplay, whose name I've forgotten) presents are complex and human. Just like in real life, nobody here is clear-cut, everyone has greater depths than are first seen and it's hard to determine who you sympathize with and who to blame. The performances are all, without exception, excellent.
The story, simply put, is a character-based drama. It's about Monty (Ed Norton) and his way of dealing with the fact that he's about to go to prison for 7 years and there's a whole bunch of people and things that he's never going to see again. The movie is about how this affects him, his friends, his business partners (he deals drugs) and his girlfriend.
The DVD's special features include some deleted scenes (most of which were appropriately deleted, in my opinion), a montage of Ground Zero (about 8 minutes long), a short biography of Spike Lee which is informative and to the point (22 minutes long) and commentary tracks by Spike Lee and the writer of the book and the screenplay (I haven't listened to these yet so I can't tell you what I think of them).
It's a really worthwhile movie and one that, if you enjoy it, you'll want to watch again in a month or two as there are definitely scenes that stand out more once you're not obliged to follow the plot too closely.
Highly recommended; but don't plan on being in a particularly jovial mood afterwards.",1055289600,7,1761,4.611464968152866
1176271,5,B00000214T,"25th Hour
Cast: Edward Norton, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Rosario Dawson
Plot Summary: If you had 24 hours left before you had to say goodbye to everyone you knew, your family, your friends, your life, how would you spend those 24 hours? What would you say, how would you feel, what would you do? This movie tries to answer all these questions for one man...but there's a twist (of COURSE there's a twist, this IS a Spike Lee film, after all). Manty Brogan is a 31-year-old drug dealer from New York who's set to go to prison for a 7 year term after someone tipped the cops to his activities. Now, he has 24 hours to spend with his friends, his girlfriend, and his father. He doesn't know who tipped the cops, and so he's suspicious of everyone. And those around him have plenty of problems of their own. His girlfriend doesn't know how she will handle life without him. His father owed money to some dangerous people--that's why Monty started selling drugs in the first place. One of his friends is a neurotic stock broker and the other is an uptight high school teacher who has a ""thing"" for one of his female students. All of these stories play off each other as the film builds to its ambiguous climax.
Review: Spike Lee films are a mixed bag. They have interesting stories, but are bogged down by too much preachiness. Not so with this one. For those who are familiar with the ""Hate"" monologues of Lee's film ""Do the Right Thing"" (one character or multiple characters spout off at the camera about how they hate various other minorities), that scene is played out here, but with urprising results. Hating others because you're pissed off about your lot in life inevitable leads to the conclusion that your problems, however they may be connected to others, are still YOUR problems, and hating others won't get you any closer to solving those problems. All of his films have this message in some way, but his subtlty is improving with time.
Norton does a great job of portraying this character as a nice guy with some flaws. Monty's not a bad guy. The opening scene of this film shows him rescuing a wounded dog, whom he later adopts. He clearly loves his girlfriend, and he wants to start a family with her--though now he doesn't know if he can trust her, since she may have been the one who ratted on him. He also loves his father, and he'd do anything to help him. But he's not totally sympathetic--he may have started selling drugs to help his father, but he surely took advantage of the lifestyle that the money afforded him. The film doesn't make any value judgements on his character--he is who he is, and this is how he's spending his last 24 hours of freedom.
Rosario Dawson is also great as Monty's girlfriend, Naturel. She's worried about how Monty's acting, yet still ambiguous enough that we suspect she might have something to do with his arrest.
Barry Pepper is Monty's neurotic Stock Broker friend Francis. He too seems to have two personalities: He pledges to always be there for Monty, but talks behind his back about how Monty deserves what he gets, and once Monty goes to prison, the friendship is over. He's very ""friendly"" toward Naturel, yet he blames her for taking advantage of the money Monty's lifestyle provided even though they all knew it was dangerous for him. It's always unclear which of these people is the ""true"" Francis. Perhaps he doesn't even know himself.
Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent (isn't he always? as the uptight high school teacher with amarous feelings for his 17 year old student, Mary (Anna Paquin). He's fighting these feelings, sorting through his feelings about Monty, and stumbling uncomfortably through the movie, always looking unsure of what to do next. But what will happen when Mary shows up at the club where Monty is having his going away party...?
Monty is trying to figure out who turned him in, but that is far from the only thing on his mind. he knows that these 24 hours are important--how will he say goodbye to this part of his life?--but what is more important is that the rest of his life will be determined by what happens in that 25th hour. The first impression that he makes in prison will determine whether he will survive his sentance. After all, Monty's a good-looking guy, and good looking guys often have a hard time in prison...
Reflections: 25th Hour is about the little things in life that determine the big things. One small moment between Hoffman's character and his student will affect the future of his entire career. Monty's good looks could endanger the rest of his life. The importance of little things is underscored when Monty asks Hoffman's character to take care of his dog. He says saving the dog is ""one of the best things I've ever done...every day he has for the rest of his life is because of me.""
At the end of the film, everything is resolved and yet nothing is resolved (kinda like life, isn't it?) Chance and choice work together to determine destiny, and how you act and react even in small situations will affect the rest of your life. As the film's final line says, ""It all came so close to not happening..."" But this movie isn't about the rest of your life. It's about now. We don't know what will happen in Manty's 25th hour, but from viewing these 24, whether we like the character or not, we at least CARE what happens. That is the genius of this film, and why it is well worth seeing.",1055289600,8,5413,4.587203302373581

1176273,5,B00000214T,"Spike Lee hasn't quite gotten the recognition he deserves.  25th Hour is one of the best films of 2002 yet it was somewhat underrated and overlooked.  It is moody, powerful, and thoughtful.  It is not a plot-driven film as it follows a retired drug dealer during his last day before a 7-year prison sentence.  As the first film made in New York after September 11, the destruction and mourning caused by the attacks is very present in the film.  25th Hour has a powerful voice that speaks to everyone.  One particular scene in which Edward Norton talks cynically to himself may seem slightly offensive to some, but that's not the point.  The cast gives great performances with characters the audience can relate to.  Rosario Dawson gives a mature and believable performance as Norton's girlfriend.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a conflicted and mild-mannered school teacher, and Barry Pepper is an egotistical stock broker.  This film will make you reflect on your own life and the world we live in.  Our struggles, the decisions we must make, the prejudices and false judgements we have - they all come to life on screen through a character who realizes the mistakes he's made are going to change his life.",1055116800,,1204,4.824390243902439
1176274,5,B00000214T,"Shot a couple of months after 9/11, Spike Lee's ""25th Hour"" focuses on Montgomery Brogan's last night of freedom before he goes to jail for 7 years for dealing drugs. Brogan, played by Norton, intends to spend his last night with his girlfriend (Dawson) & two childhood friends (Pepper & Hoffman) at a NYC club where he will have to face the gangsters he has been connected with that believe he may have ratted them out to the police.
""25th Hour"" has an intriguing premise, and is executed in an expert, evocative fashion by Lee. This is actually two strong movies in one - a person's last night of freedom before going to jail, but also, a study of a community living with the aftermath of having their home attacked by terrorists. Montgomery Brogan is scared of going to jail, but he also needs to find out who set him up, fearing, that it may have been his girlfriend. The score by Terrance Blanchard is one of the best I've ever heard in a movie - simply beautiful and brutally powerful. This is an emotionally charged movie that is suspenseful, humorous, and beautiful -- qualities that rarely come together quite as well as they do in Spike Lee movies. It is unfortuate that this movie didn't seem to be seen by as many as it should have - I recommend it to everyone I know.
If you're a fan of the movie, the DVD is a must: two commentaries (director; screenwriter), several deleted scenes, a 22 minute special on Lee, and a tasteful, powerful Ground Zero montage.",1055116800,10,1470,4.50936329588015
1176275,5,B00000214T,"Though often branded and criticized for outrageuously stupid reasons, Spike Lee has once again demonstrated that he is top notch director, sort of the African American version of Standley Kubrick in that it perhaps takes more than what the standard moviegoer is willing to do to understand what he or she is seeing, the story that is unfolding and be interested in the characters enough to keep on watching that screen. There are some points in which the film tends to lag, however the dialog is crisp and smartly written. Seemingly focusing on the depth of Monty's ordeal and the challenge that he must face, that on some level we all must face which is change and taking responsibility for every action whether good, bad or committed in the face of having no other option but to go. This movie I think deals more with reality, though I question a little about what I would do if I were in Monty's place. Telling his friend to make him ""ugly"" for prison was bit much, though I can see what Spike was trying to say. I don't want to give too much away, I suggest that you rent this film first since like Kubrick, Lee is an accquired taste.",1054944000,3,1138,4.475961538461538
1176276,5,B00000214T,"It's a funny thing about Spike Lee, but he often seems to do a better job directing white actors, rather than people of color.  I dunno why that is, exactly -- maybe be feels obliged somehow to make his African-American protagonists live up to certain ideals, or espouse certain viewpoints, as opposed to just being, well, just themselves.  For whatever reason, his white characters are less stagey and agit-prop, more believable and less like cardboard cutouts.  That's certainly true of Edward Norton's character, a mid-level street dealer named Monty Brogan, an Irish tough guy who works selling heroin for some greasy Russian mobsters.  Monty recently got busted, though, and today's his last day in New York before he has to turn himself in for a mandatory seven-year prison sentence.  The plot revolves around Monty's rapproachments with his old childhood friends, and his frustration at not knowing who, among his associates, turned him in to the cops.  It's a subtle, low-key performance, with Norton doing a panicked slow burn as a guy who thought he had it all wired and cool, but realizes that heading to the Big House may be something he can't handle.  Character actor Philip Seymour Hoffman is typically great as his nerdy old pal, while Barry Pepper is a little too abrasive as his former best buddy, a soulless stockbroker who secretly holds Monty in contempt for his sleazy lowlife lifestyle.  The movie unfolds slowly, unhurried, and taken as a whole, may be Spike Lee's best-directed effort to date.  I dug it.",1054944000,4,1528,4.96078431372549
1176277,5,B00000214T,"The 25th Hour is the best movie I've seen all year. I'm sure you're at least familiar with the plot, so I'll talk about the performances. Edward Norton, one of the most talented young actors of our day, gives a performance that should be remembered as one of his two best to date (the other being American History X). He plays Monty Brogan, convicted as a drug dealer and sentenced to seven years. The movie is his last day of freedom. It shows his fruitless attempts to relax and enjoy his last night of freedom with his friends. He is one of the most tragic characters in recent years. Tragic in the true sense of the word, because all tragic characters make some attempts to redeem themselves, and failing that, ultimately accept the consequences of their actions. Although we never see Monty arrive at the prison, we can see his vacant stare at the last highway exit before the jail, as he passes it.
Every character plays their part to perfection, Philip Seymour Hoffman in particular. He is fast becoming one of my favorites, and is perfect as the very socially inept high school teacher. Barry Pepper, another favorite actor of mine since 'Saving Private Ryan', is amazing. But the true star here is Edward Norton. Words alone cannot describe Edward Norton's abilities. His Monty Brogan is plagued with the struggle to determine who turned him in and whether or not to report to prison. You can see, in every moment Monty has to himself, the internal debate as to whether he should go willingly to jail or run. It is probably Norton's most confilcted character yet, and maybe his most difficult. He even starts lashing out at his friends because he's trying to make his leaving easier by alienating his only friends, and it is heartrending to see.

I would have never guessed that I'd be writing a movie review tonight -- let alone one like this.  But I'm left with the reality that this is the best film I've ever seen... better than ""Casablanca""; better than ""Life Is Beautiful.""  The script itself may lose out to ""China Town"", but it is the story that serves as the foundation, the enabler, for such a wonderful film.  Granted, the acting is extraordinary.  Truly extraordinary.  But it is the whole package here that will not let this film leave your mind.  ""Wow.""  That's what I keep saying to myself.  ""Wow.""
In the interest of full disclosure, I'm a big Spike Lee fan.  But this is his best BY FAR... by far.  It vastly exceeds his other two best -- ""Malcom X"" and ""Four Little Girls"".  SEE THIS FILM.  YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY YOU DID.",1054857600,,906,4.247058823529412
1176279,3,B00000214T,"Pity, real pity that Spike Lee fails to bring out the potential of this film. But, keeping in mind, that this is based on a book, i doubt he could actually do much more with the story when the story is so full of holes in its original version.
  First of all, for the European audience there`s one thing that makes no sense from the get-go: we have this guy who gets busted with a sofa practically stuffed with weed and cash. He gets taken downtown for interrogation (mind you, by the DEA not just the cops) but, miraculously, he is given one last day of freedom before he can go on to serve 7 years in maximum security.
  Hmm...I don't know, but this is a possibility in the States, wouldnt at least half (if not 90%) of those given that ""last day"" option run off to Mexico or to Brasil???
  Even if that is really how things work out in the States , Spike Lee makes no effort to explain that to non-Americans so i, for example, was left with the feeling that i`m watching a plot that`s totally unconvincing from minute 1.
  Then there`s again this last day thingie: I mean, you have a last day before you for 2.555 days in jail and you spend it in a totally cheap way like the main character did? That would be believable if that main character was himself cheap, but he isn`t, au contraire, he`s portrayed as a very intelligent guy with a very human side. This very guy is shown going to some meaningless party where he can drink his brains out and then ""go in""...Sorry but that just won't cut it.
  Shame then, because this film offers some truly great performances, namely, Edward Norton delivering in his usual superb style, and everybody else in the film following that suit in close distance.
  I was also left wondering what all the 9-11 themes were doing in this film. What was the connection??? In the end, this came through as yet another annoying ""feature"" of the film.
  Bottom line: with so many good assets this film fails, it fails on the plot, fails on the pace, fails on its individual components and their coherence. I blame Spike.",1054684800,,2051,4.391534391534392

This movie reveals some of the nice aspects of the life, as it's value is immeasurable for a man who is about to lose it. We see old friends meeting after a long time; we see the trust. We're reminded of things like family relations, love, and money. Perhaps they are the most common parts of our lives, but we never think over them.

1176281,4,B00000214T,"Spike Lee's films have always been very hit or miss for me, I loved ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""He Got Game"", but found ""Summer of Sam"" absolutely abysmal. This film finds him departing from the typical ""big"" issues that he normally confronts in his films and centering more closely on the problems and struggles of mostly one person. 25th Hour was a return to form for Lee in my eyes because he resists the urge to go over the top with the material, which is often a flaw in his other films. Instead, he presents us with much more personal issues in 25th Hour, issues of missed opportunity, regret, and the way each choice we make or don't make in life can lead to vastly different outcomes. The result is a surprisingly touching and sympathetic view of the mistakes of one life.
Set against the backdrop of post 9/11 New York City, 25th Hour follows Monty Brogan on the last day before he is to be incarcerated for drug possession. The inclusion of post 9/11 images did not seem forced or out of place to me, but instead aided the film in its presentation of themes of regret, melancholy and longing for the past.
The ensemble cast do a great job showing the ways, both large and small, directly and indirectly, that they are affected by the events in Monty's life, and how we are all in some way or another interconnected, whether we realize it or not.
25th Hour also features a very noticeable and moody musical score which really conveys the themes and feelings that are presented throughout.
In the end, we are offered a hopeful glimpse at what Monty's life could have been like, underscoring the effect that even our smallest decisions can have. This was a crucial moment in the film for me, where the urge to present a sugar coated, Hollywood ending must have been strong. Nevertheless, without giving anything away, I think you will find the film passes this final test of good storytelling with flying colors.",1054425600,,1917,4.575581395348837

1176283,3,B00000214T,"Like many of Spike Lee's films, 25th Hour is at times powerful and original and in parts overstated and pretentious. Edward Norton gives a fine performance as Monty, a drug dealer planning to serve a seven year sentence. This is primarily a character-driven tale; we are taken through Monty's last day as a free man  and his attempt to discover who betrayed him (the cops who arrested him knew exactly where his drugs and money were hidden). Monty is suspicious of his girlfriend (played by Rosario Dawson) and not sure who among his friends he can trust. Some of the dialogue in 25th Hour, including the opening scene in which Monty rescues an injured dog, could have been lifted straight from a Quentin Tarantino film. Another problem is the way the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center is exploited as a backdrop. This has nothing to do with the story, but seems to have been used as a device to give the movie more emotional punch. There is, for example, a scene in which two of Monty's friends (played by Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who are also excellent) look down from a high rise apartment at an eerie nighttime scene of the Trade Center site. This image has an undeniable power, but, again, has no direct relevance. There is also a wholly gratuitous and silly scene where Monty, facing a mirror, gives a long angry monologue, expressing rage against the various ethnic groups that comprise New York City. This is very similar to a scene in Spike Lee's earlier (and probably best) film, Do The Right Thing. Lee obviously loves and is fascinated with New York City and its ethnic issues, but he should resist the temptation to throw in irrelevant and overwrought material like this. The movie is 135 minutes, and would have been improved by cutting at least fifteen of those minutes. That said, 25th Hour works very well on some levels. Monty's character is perfectly drawn; he is neither the kind of swaggering gangster cliche found in many crime dramas nor a victim of circumstances meant to illicit our pity. He is sympathetic, but also clearly responsible for his own predicament. The relationship he has with his two best friends, one a cocky stockbroker (Pepper), the other a nerdy teacher (Hoffman) with a crush on one of his students is interesting and complex. The film also maintains a compelling tone and we are kept wondering until the very end what Monty's fate will be. 25th Hour showcases both Lee's considerable talents and foibles as a director.",1054339200,2,2484,4.75
1176284,3,B00000214T,"""25th Hour"" is a decent movie but could've been so much more.  After hearing all the rave reviews and finding that a lot of great actors appeared in this film, I had some high hopes.  That could've been the problem from the start.  I was expecting a great movie.  Well, it's a good movie, but nowhere near great.  There are even times where I find that the movie has more cons than pros.
Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the movie.  I didn't dislike it.  I thought it was a decent movie, but it had the chance to be much more than it was.  The basic storyline behind ""25th Hour"" centers around a man named Monty.  After being busted by the Feds, Monty has 24 hours to live his life before he goes away to prison.  In that time, Monty spends time with his friends, tries to patch things up with his father, and tries to find out if his girlfriend was the one who ratted him out to the Feds.  The only thing that is certain is the fact that Monty is having a hard time saying goodbye, and does not know if he'll settle for prison.
Now, that all sounds like a great idea and a great concept for a movie.  However, it's the EXECUTION of it all that gives the film flaws.  When I was watching this movie it felt like I was watching two, three, or even four films all at once.  Some of the scenes drag on longer than they really need to, most of the conversations that take place aren't very interesting and even get away from the story, and I get the impression that the movie didn't know how it was going to end.  And I felt that the film had no idea on where it was going and what kind of message it was trying to establish.
The film is in no way a failure.  Not at all.  The performances are great.  Edward Norton does a great job in the movie, although it is nothing we haven't seen in the past.  And there are other players in the film you will also recognize as well.  All pretty good for the most part.  And the movie has some interesting moments as well.  It just would've been nicer to have more of them.
The DVD has some neat extra features.  The picture and sound quality is really good, although the picture looks a bit gritty at times (on purpose, of course).  Some of the extras included are commentaries, a tribute to Ground Zero, and a featurette on Spike Lee.
""25th Hour"" is a good movie; good, but not great.  I don't know if it deserves all the critical praise it's been getting, but that's not for me to decide.  This is my first Spike Lee film, but I'm willing to bet that he has better films than this one.  I liked the movie, but not as much as I like most.  It's nothing I could see myself watching over and over again, but I'm sure it's something I'd watch every now and then.

1176285,3,B00000214T,"Montgomery ""Monty"" Brogan (Edward Norton) has just 24 hours to live as a free man before he will be incarcerated for 7 years for selling illicit drugs. He spends his last free day with his friends and family, examining his past and the reasons that he took the path that he did, trying not to think too deeply about his impending fate. Monty's two best friends from high school, Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman), whose lives took different paths, spend their time talking about what they think of Monty and of each other.  The day culminates in a going away party which everyone attends. In the morning, Monty can no longer put off thinking about the abrupt end his life is going to suffer and what he must do to cope with this fact.

""25th Hour"" is based on a book by David Benioff, who also wrote the film's screenplay. The film was directed by Spike Lee. The story and characters are interesting. The cast is top-notch. The performances are good. But the directing style, instead of elucidating these things, gets in the way of the story and the character development. Blue filters and bizarre lighting might be ok if they weren't so overdone. Spike Lee's habit of showing multiple shots of the same image is just plain grating. The film's score isn't so much bad as it is deliberately in-your-face, which makes it seem bad. And there is a lot of irrelevant material in the film. ""25th Hour"" suffers from a serious case of technique over substance. And that is a disaster if you are making a character study. In this case, there is actually some substance there. It is just buried beneath a heavy-handed and inappropriate directing style.

Some fine actors give admirable performances in ""25th Hour"". Edward Norton does a  good job, but his fans won't be missing anything if they skip this one. Monty closely resembles characters that Norton played in ""Fight Club"" and ""American History X"", which are better movies. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a great talent. I used to look forward to seeing him in anything. But he needs to get away from these lumpy socially inept characters. He's becoming a cliche. Barry Pepper is especially good as Frank, an obnoxious Wall Street shark who cares more about his friend than he would like to admit. Former Baltimore Raven Tony Siragusa is thoroughly convincing in a small role as a Russian mobster.

I give ""25th Hour"" a marginal recommendation because there is some interesting and thought-provoking material in it, if you can get past its self-conscious artiness. When Spike Lee renounces self-indulgence in favor of competent craftsmanship, he might be able to make a good movie.",1053907200,4,2644,4.802197802197802
1176286,4,B00000214T,"25th hour is a fantastic meld of a fictional but realistic story set amidst a background of factual events.
Following drug dealer Montgomery Brogan (Edward Norton) on his last day before starting a seven-year prison term, the film takes place in New York during the aftermath of 9-11, a place and time where it was constantly on the thoughts of every person there. Though some have criticized the inclusion of 9-11 as not having anything to do with the plot, I strongly disagree. In other films released in 2002, (such as Spiderman), the filmmakers have tried to put in something patriotic to pay homage to the event, but in doing so created a scene that seemed out of place with the film, but in 25th Hour, the aftermath of the events of 9-11, and they way people are paying for something that?s already done serves as an analogy to Montgomery dealing with his past crimes, and how he now has to pay for what he's done.
The cast here is fantastic. Edward Norton is his usual brilliant self, with Brian Cox, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin, Rosario Dawson and Berry Pepper filling out supporting roles of people close to Montgomery. There's a fantastic chemistry here that helps to propel the story forward without feeling like the characters are forcing it along. The music is another great accompaniment, telling of the sadness of the characters and city at this time without being too forceful of a presence. Nothing is overdone here, but wonderfully realistic and absorbing.
25th Hour gets a high recommendation from me. Director Spike Lee turned out a powerful story that simultaneously deals with the sorrow of a city and the troubles of a small group of friends.",1053734400,,1674,4.795847750865052
1176287,5,B00000214T,"After reading many of the reviews and sharing a wary feeling about Spike Lee's frequent sledgehammer approach to subject matter I was genuinely touched by 25th Hour. The acting is superb with Norton and cast running with the script and to his credit Spike Lee helping to get these three dimensional performances.
All the ballyhoo over 9.11 and it's unnecessary backdrop misses the point. Those that think it detracts from 25th Hour say there is no point to adding the footage but as a counterpoint to several segments of the film the idea works without getting too heavy handed. There are a few moments of United States nationalism which may not play well to some but it's heartfelt, not manipulative.
The other critiques about Edward Norton being run through similar situations from Fight Club and American History X ring hollow. The narrative for one of the comparisons is very similar to the book, that Norton did a similar monolog as a different character in another film is blaming the film for how the adaptation of the book was made. Perhaps a fair critisim but within this story in this film the critisim speaks more of some viewer's dislike for the director. In this case blame it on the author/screenwriter if you must. The motivations are different and what the audience gets from the scene has no similarity. In the scene compared to Fight Club, again, there are different motivations and meanings. The comparison isn't valid.
As a fairly jaded urban dweller 25th hour, a film that doesn't have much of a linear story, is still gripping with it's portraits of people who make decisions and the effects they have upon themselves and others. As a character study 25th Hour is a success. The closing scene is both heartbreaking and reflective.

1176292,4,B00000214T,"A strange and disquieting film more than an interesting one. It tries too much to demonstrate something and that something is just as unreal as the mind who thought it over, if over at all. A drug lord in New York is supposed to go spend seven years in prison. He must have been convicted and sentenced by a court. So what is he doing free outside the prison he is supposed to go to by his own means tomorrow? What's more on the very day before this move to the prison his apartment is raided by the police with a proper search warrant and money and drugs are found in his own couch, apparently on some information given to the police by some fink. And he is not arrested on the spot. So the whole film is a dream, the dream about the last day before going to prison during which the ex-drug-lord is meeting with his two childhood or teenage school buddies, one being a high school teacher and the other a stock exchange trader. Plus the father who is summoned into the film before that big event. The film thus starts with a beaten up dog the hero saves in some abandoned lot in New York and ends with this hero completely banged up by his own trading friend for him to be ""ugly"" and not to attract too much attention from his prison inmates to come on the following day, with details about how many teeth would get broken out of his mouth for his biting to be harmless, and a few other gritty details like this one. And just before this last picture of the banged-up hero in the passenger's seat of his father's car being driven by his own father to his prison, the dream of an escape, like in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"": go west, disappear, change identity, bring your girl friend and raise a family. Martin Scorsese revisited. But what comes out of the film? Are we supposed to cry for a drug-lord who has sold poison on the street of New York? Are we supposed to cry for his fink of a friend who just played his own game and lost? Are we supposed to cry for a girl friend who enjoyed easy money and luxury for years and is going to lose it all, if she does? Are we supposed to cry for the high school teacher who kisses his 17 year old student in a night club? Are we supposed to cry for the trader who gets redressed by his own boss because he is overspending and gambling more than trading? What is the object of the film, if any other than voyeuristic pathetic grossness? So in fine it is more disappointing even than disquieting, or disquieting about Spike Lee's movie making.

His friends, critical of Monty, imperfect themselves but rich characters anyway gives the whole last night a tone of debate and self-examination.

1176296,4,B00000214T,"Spike Lee's ""The 25 Hour"" is the story of a New York drug dealer's long last night of freedom before a seven-year prison stint. It is a sad movie for a bunch of reasons, but most notably for the way the Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) wastes his final night in a deafening, public night club, with childhood friends he no longer really knows, and a girlfriend he no longer trusts. By the following morning, Monty knows some things that might have changed that final night for the better, but then Monty's whole life has played out that way, learning things after the fact. It's why he's going to prison.
 Edward Norton is entrenched in this kind of character -- a smart, quick-talking brooder, aware of his risks, but willing to roll the dice. But much like Norton's torn characters of ""Fight Club"" and ""American History X,"" Monty senses something lacking about his masculinity; it isn't the length of time in jail that worries him, it's the first night. He rubs his pretty boy face, pretty certain he'll be raped or killed. His Russian mobster boss tells him to beat someone up, and bad, or else. ""The only thing I learned about prison,"" the mobster says, ""is that I don't like prison.""
  Monty gathers two old friends, one a Jewish literature teacher, Jacob, (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the other a hopped-up stockbroker, Francis, (Barry Pepper) for a night of reconciliation, celebration. The girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), comes along, although she and Monty aren't speaking much, since Monty believes it was Naturelle who turned him into the DEA.
 Did she? The movie argues for both possibilities and then reveals the answer. Dawson is not a great actor, but she finds her mark with Naturelle, a young, Latin beauty who loves Monty but keeps her distance; she's sad and kind, but she's also the hottest thing on the block, and not particularly subject to loyalty laws once Monty's gone.
The friends fight their own demons. Jacob, the English teacher, is more intrigued by a student (Anna Paquin) who joins Monty's party at the club. Stockbroker Francis fights a movie-long battle on whether to lust after Naturelle, or berate her. There is also Monty's father (Brian Cox), a semi-reformed alcoholic bartender who blames his poor example for his son's fate.
 ""The 25th Hour"" is, then, a jack-of-all-trades lament, set against the World Trade Center cleanup of 9/11, which Lee displays prominently throughout the film. It creates a deliberate pall over the film, as does the loud, melodramatic score that plays during many scenes. The terrorist attacks play a central role in a lengthy rant that Norton delivers straight to the camera -- the centerpiece of the film, it's a angry treatise on the disgust of New York that also doubles as its charms; like most New Yorkers, Monty has a tough love for his city, but it's a deep love nonetheless. Bottle this scene up and you've got a perfect movie.
  Lee wanders a bit -- the screenplay isn't quite good enough to justify such emphasis on Jacob's storyline -- but ""The 25th Hour"" ends on a provocative note that explores a choice that has been in front of Monty all along. It's farfetched, intentionally so, and the kind of wish we'd all like to have when we're faced with steep consequence. The scene only works if we think Monty, through his remorse, has earned the right to dream it. And Norton sells it, in one of his best performances.",1050537600,15,3395,4.793162393162393

1176301,4,B00000214T,"A superb cast (and brilliant performances) greatly benefit ""25th Hour,"" Spike Lee's latest directorial effort. Fascinating and frustrating, this is the story of the last twenty four hours Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) gets to spend with his two best friends, Frank (Barry Pepper), a bonds trader, and Jakob (Phillip Seymour Hoffman in another brilliant performance), a high school English teacher, and his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), before he goes to prison for seven years for pushing heroin, as they party the night away in New York City one last time. Monty spends most of his last day tying up loose ends. There's his dog, a mangy mongrel he rescued after it was burned and left for dead, who needs a new home. There's peace to be made with his father (Brian Cox), who runs a fine Irish bar catering to firefighters. There's a final meeting with his Russian bosses, who play hard and rough. And there's the nagging question: Who ratted him out? Was it, as Jacob and Francis believe, his live-in girlfriend, Naturelle, whose street smarts and supple beauty hint at betrayal?
Adapted by screenwriter David Benioff from his novel that was written before 9/11, the film brilliantly uses this transition in Monty's life as a powerful metaphor for the changes we all went through after that terrible Tuesday in September. Shades of September 11 are everywhere, including the memorable scene in Frank's apartment where we get a clear view of the trgedy's aftermath. There is also the brilliant sequence where Monty looks in the mirror of a restroom and spits out a litany of hate for every group he can think of in New York--every economic, ethnic, sexual and age group gets the f-word, until finally he sees himself in the mirror and includes himself. This scene seems so typical of Spike Lee (it's like an extension of a sequence in ""Do the Right Thing"") that it's a surprise to find it's in the original novel--but then Benioff's novel may have been inspired by Lee's earlier film.
The film is unusual for not having a plot or a payoff. It is about the end of this stage of Monty's life, so there is no goal he is striving for--unless it is closure with Naturelle and his father. He may not see them again; certainly not like this. Perhaps the film's main flaw is that it goes on a good 20 minutes too long, but it manages to pack a wallop nonetheless, for a truly memorable experience.",1044230400,8,2398,4.739234449760765
1176302,4,B00000214T,"The plot of 25th Hour is simple and wonderful. Monty Brogan is trying to tie up lose ends in his last 24 hours as a free man before he goes to prision for selling drugs. Basically this encompasses saying good by to his father (Brian Cox), his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson), and his two best friends (Phillip Seymor Hoffman and Barry Pepper). This is what happens, but this film is about so much more.
Monty is a drug dealer, but he isn't sorry for dealing drugs. At least he doesn't give that impression. He's sorry he got caught. He's sorry he got greedy. He's sorry he has to give up a life he likes. His close friends don't seem to care that he sold drugs either. They think he got a bum deal as well. His father blames his own alcholism and the death of his mother for Monty's choice to sell drugs. The funny thing is, is that Monty doesn't seem like a bad guy. In fact he isn't. 25th Hour makes a serious point out of this. This role has been a long time in the making. The film is attacking our drug laws. So what if Monty sells drugs to [individuals], they don't have to buy them. And at least they know what they are buying. The argument is there, and it is poignant.
The performances and the diection of this film are teriffic. Norton, always strong, is even stronger. Norton gives Monty life that a lesser actor couldn't. In one particular scene, Monty enters a bathroom and sees [a message] written on the mirror. He then falls into a powerful monologue where he precedes to rip every ethnic or religious group in the city before finally arriving at himself. Barry Pepper and Phillip Seymor Hoffman are both outstanding in their roles. Pepper completely embodies the Wall Street trader persona that eventually becomes overcome at the loss of his friend. Lee's always made strong films, but this film didn't remind me of his other work. Never afraid to take chances with the camera, the film looks great. He really got down with these actors because they don't miss a beat.
One last note, the opening credit sequence of this film is one of the most haunting images I have ever seen. Using a combination of lights, time-elapse photography, and Terence Blanchard's score, Lee directly acknowledges the 9/11 attack on our nation, and the absence of the Trade Centers that once loomed over New York City. Honestly, I'm not sure what it has to do with the rest of the film, but it is the first time I have seen a filmmaker make it a point. I must admit that at times the film seems to wander, but I didn't care because it was a good kind of wandering. David Benioff delivered a great script and Spike Lee and crew delivered a great film.

1176304,4,B00000214T,"What I mean is, watching this film almost put me in the shoes of your average New Yorker and seeing the life they have lived with over the past couple of years.  Sharing the emotions of 9/11 that you really can't avoid.  Anger, depression, sadness, frustration....Edward Norton's character goes through it all in this.  Blaming others for the mess that New York is in...I felt right there next to him.
This surprises me b/c it took away focus from the main plot of the movie at times.  Although this movie doesn't have much of a plot.  It's a guy's last day before going to jail for several years for drugs.  He learns who his true friends are and who isn't.  It's a simple plot but frankly it's a very well made film that addresses 9/11 in a wonderful way - the way that it made me feel as I described earlier.  That's why I rated this so high even though not much went on.
Acting is wonderful.  The characters are easy to believe and understand.  The shots are well composed with a great score.  It's worth watching I think if you don't live in NY and want to understand what life is like for them.
All in all, another solid film for Norton you need to add to your Ed Norton library.",1043452800,,1185,4.292792792792793
1176305,3,B00000214T,"Monty's 'mirror soliloquy' is saying that he has ultimately himself to blame for the way his life has turned out. Spike spends a lot of time on the aftermath of 9/11 in New York, showing montages of the then-clean-up of the wreckage, the now-gone 'Tribute in Lights' from various angles for the opening credits, and including several shots of patriotic posters and signs. I have to wonder then if, is Lee showing, by extension, that Americans have themselves for--or at least must share in a great deal of--the blame for the 9/11/01 catastrophe?
Monty's 'last night of freedom' has a residual impact on his friends, who feel the need to tie up loose ends as well. Or maybe it's also a suggestion that in New York, where its residents watched firsthand as the whole world fell down on their heads, there is a true sense that life is indeed temporal. By the morning Monty realizes that maybe life and freedom are synonymous. He's thrown away something he should have cherished.
Through this story, one thing should come on strong, and that is that freedom is not a thing to be taken lightly. It's not something someone else gets you, but something that you earn through your own life.",1043366400,,1182,4.6875

Lee does it in such a way that anxiety and stress is unavoidable, which certainly gets the audience's attention on what is at stake and why it is at stake.  Apprehension is not only depicted through Monty, but also with those around him who seek and avoid it.  There is no way to get away from this lingering apprehension and it is already too late to turn back.  At the end, Lee will make the audience see what he wants them to see while leaving everything to our imagination with brilliant touch.",1043107200,,757,4.544117647058823

1176308,3,B00000214T,"25th Hour (Spike Lee, 2002)
Spike Lee made three of the defining films of the 1980s, She's Gotta Have It, School Daze, and Do the Right Thing. Then his career seemed to jump the shark; the politics got in the way of the art (a line he treaded in the last two of the abovementioned films, to be sure, but without crossing it), and the downward slide began, culminating in the overblown, thoroughly unwatchable Summer of Sam. Given the decline of Lee's career, having him pitted against the finest actor in America today, Ed Norton, filled me with something akin to dread. Norton is a brilliant actor, turning everything he touches at least to fool's gold; three of the last four films he's made, he's been the only thing about them worth watching. I'll see anything Ed Norton is in, and seeing that the redoubtable Jon Kilik (Before Night Falls) was listed as producer on this gave me some hope that Spike Lee was going to return to the good old days, when the art was for art's sake, the politics were kept in check and grew out of the characters rather than vice versa, and the best actors of the generation turned in the best performances of their careers for the man working the magic behind the camera.
Did he make it? Hard to say. This is easily Spike Lee's best film since 1989. That, however, is not saying much.
Montgomery Brogan (Norton) is an ex-narcotics dealer on his last day before going to prison for seven years after the police were tipped off to where he hides the drugs and money. Figuring out who tipped him off becomes the mystery subplot, but the basic premise of the movie is that two of his childhood friends, wall-street shark Frank (Barry Pepper of The Green Mile and-erk-Battlefield Earth) and English teacher Jakob (Philip Seymour Hoffman, from RedDragon), are taking Brogan out for their last night on the town for a very long time. The other main subplot going through the film is Jakob's obsession with one of his students, Mary d'Annunzio (Anna Paquin, sporting some of the most finely-adorned stomach muscles on the planet throughout the movie), whom the three of them meet by chance during their evening. Other characters move through the film at times, including Brogan's wife (Men in Black II's Rosario Dawson) and father (Brian Cox, the finest casting move made in the film-did anyone else catch the irony there?).
The film is chock full of beautiful scenes. Those with Norton and Cox are probably the best in the film; Cox, when he's on his game, can tear a viewer's heart out with his plaintiveness, and he does so here in a role that has the potential to land him his first, and long overdue, Oscar nomination. Other great pieces of dialogue float throughout. Many of them involve Barry Pepper, whose character flits through personality traits like Wall Street move shares; one moment he's offering Norton a shoulder to cry on, the next he's excoriating Norton while talking to Hoffman from his penthouse apartment overlooking ground zero.
And here we come to the film's biggest failing, and the one upon which the minor ones rest. Much of the movie's screen time makes it seem like Lee's main goal here was to spend as much time as possible showing his viewers scenes of New York recovering from 9/11, from the painfully sappy opening credits montage to the minutes after the aforementioned scene between Pepper and Hoffman occurs, as Hoffman stares out the window at cranes removing I-beams from the wreckage of the twin towers.
All of this time could have been spent in character development and filling in missing pieces. And very well should have been. There are a whole lot of fine performances in this movie, but they don't add up to much; we're handed episodic pieces of a puzzle, but what makes them connect is missing from the box. For example, Jakob's obsession with Mary; we know it exists, there's some buildup to the climax of that particular plot thread, the climax occurs. It's obvious there's much more to that story to be told, but it drops from the film, never to be mentioned again. Also, when the narc's identity is finally revealed, the only way to make it work logically is because you can piece together the red herrings; unlike most herring-filled mysteries, the clues as to the narc's identity are absent from the first three quarters of the film. Non-mystery-fans will probably let this pass uncommented, but for those of us who outgrew the Agatha Christie ""here's who the killer is... and I'll tell you why"" method of mystery ending long ago, there's going to be a sour taste in the mouth.
That said, it's not a reason to stay away. There isn't a single bad performance in the film. If you can get past the calculated smarminess of the New York City cinematography and concentrate on the acting, there's much to be relished here. Terence Blanchard's haunting score may be his finest since 1994's The Inkwell, and those who loved Do the Right Thing will have fond memories raised by a certain hate-filled misanthropic monologue Norton's reflection addresses to him in one of the film's most memorable scenes; unlike the vitriolic rapid-fire racist delivery of the 1989 scene, however, Norton's rant is almost poetic in its dissection of many of New York City's stereotypes. (One of the final scenes in the film recalls this rant, and it is a powerful piece of filmmaking, to be sure.) Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman have long been neglected by the Hollywood machine, despite showing awe-inspiring talent on a fairly regular basis; their performances here will hopefully change that. Be prepared to be unsatisfied by some loose ends, but the performances herein are well worth the trouble. *** ",1042761600,3,5669,4.772912423625255
1176309,5,B00000214T,"Spike Lee's ""25th Hour"" is a monumental accomplishment that catapults the filmmaker right back into the pantheon of outstanding American directors.  With his past few films, Lee - who seemed so cutting edge and promising a filmmaker a decade or so back - had started to make us wonder if, perhaps, we hadn't overestimated some of his talent.  But with ""25th Hour,"" the master has returned to form, fashioning a brilliant and thought-provoking character study out of David Benioff's novel, a chronicle of how a convicted drug dealer spends his last 24 hours of freedom before heading off to prison to serve a seven-year term.
Montgomery Brogan is a good looking, generally pleasant-natured fellow who's made a lot of bad choices in his life and now finds himself having to pay the piper.  Although Monty is terrified of going to prison, he harbors no illusions about the fairness of the verdict.  He knows he screwed up and he feels no compulsion to squirm out of his punishment or to look for fall guys to take the blame for him.  Monty's offense is, indeed, a serious one - selling drugs to schoolchildren - and, much to their credit, Benioff and Lee do not ask us to shed tears for Monty's fate.  We are asked to care about Monty as a person, it's true, but not to approve of his actions.  Monty has chosen to spend this last day of freedom in the company of his lifelong buddies, Frank and Jakob, the former a high stakes player on Wall Street and the latter a high school English teacher.  Both men, who have taken widely differing paths in their own lives, still retain a spark of affection for Monty and even blame themselves to some extent for somehow letting Monty down at a time when they might still have been able to successfully intervene to help prevent the outcome they are all now facing.  In fact, much of the film is spent on self-recrimination, with various characters coming to terms with the painful reality of a situation that seems to have gone beyond anyone's ability to affect or control it.  The fourth member of the party is Monty's girlfriend, Naturelle, a woman deeply in love with the condemned man, who wishes he had gone straight before all this happened, yet who, during all the time she was with him, was not averse to enjoying what Monty's ill-gotten gains were able to buy for her.  All the characters, in fact, struggle with having to find that moral and ethical line over which they will not cross.  As the most ""noble"" person of the group, even Jakob, the schoolteacher, is confronted with having to make that choice and take that stand.
A lesser filmmaker would have used this plot setup as an excuse to fill up the screen with cheap melodramatics, screeching car chases, and endless dumb action sequences.  Lee, being an actual film artist, does none of that.  Instead, he allows the scenes to play themselves out in a totally naturalistic manner so that we really come to know and understand these various characters, with all their unhappiness and sorrow.  It is a remarkably melancholy film, sad to the core, and Lee's beautifully controlled direction brings out that sadness.  His style perfectly complements the mood he is endeavoring to create.  The minimal cutting he employs within each individual scene allows the actors to establish connections with one another that would not be possible using a more razzle dazzle editing style.  The dialogue is so rich and evocative that Lee doesn't feel the need to intervene at every moment to remind us he is there.  The result is that the film never feels the slightest bit phony, not even for a moment.  In fact, ""25th Hour"" is one of the most ""honest"" films to have come down the pike in a long long time.  Of course, adding to that sense of sadness is the fact that the events of 9/11 seem to forever hover in the air around the characters and their city.  There is a particularly remarkable scene in which Jakob and Frank discuss Monty's fate while sitting in front of Frank's apartment window - which just so happens to look directly down onto the rubble of Ground Zero.  It is a stunning moment in a film filled with stunning moments.
Adding to the elegiac tone are Terence Blanchard's moody score and Rodrigo Prieto and Joe Williams' marvelously rich and beautiful cinematography, both of which reflect the contemplative nature of the characters on screen.  There is some question as to the aptness of the fantasy coda Lee attaches to the end of the film.  It isn't so much that we object to the point it is trying to make but rather that the excessive length of it makes it feel somehow redundant and robs us of the sense of emotional fulfillment we need to experience at the film's conclusion.  That is, however, a minor quibble in a film as towering in effect and achievement as this one.  And besides, Lee's angry young man tirades, though they still rear their heads from time to time, are kept to a bare minimum in this work.
Lee has gathered a brilliant ensemble cast to help flesh out his very real, very complex characters.  The superb Edward Norton demonstrates once again why he is in the forefront of the world's great film actors.  As Monty, he is, literally, incapable of hitting a single false note.  Norton conveys the innate goodness and charm of a man who is about to embark on a phase of his life for which he alone bears responsibility.  We can sense the regret, sadness and fear he is feeling in his every word, gesture and glance.  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper do stand-up work as Monty's faithful pals, and Rosario Dawson shines with confident dignity as Monty's stalwart true love.  All four contribute immensely to the verisimilitude of the piece.
""25 Hours"" shows Spike Lee at the very peak of his form, a true master of his medium.  This latest work is not merely one of the very best films of 2002, but one of the very best works this gifted artist has yet provided us.  Welcome back!",1042416000,21,5921,4.633492822966507

Spike Lee does what no one else in Hollywood has had the nerve to do since 9/11. Constantly connected throughout the film are snippets of the devastation left behind. Scenes of the World Trade Towers light tribute appears at the beginning and the political voyage continues from there.
