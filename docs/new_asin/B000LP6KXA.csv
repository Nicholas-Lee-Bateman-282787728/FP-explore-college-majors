8163012,2,B000LP6KXA,"If you were to ask me if the Scottish and the French have much in common, I would say no.  However, this work uses the terms ""Gallic"" and ""Celtic"" interchangeably.  I wanted to see this work because I have heard little about Rome against the French whereas I've seen several docs on Romans against the Brits.  This was a British production with British scholars interviewed.  Thus, the work suggests that all the events described are relevant to Scottish history.  If the Spanish word for Wales is Gales, you can see how close the word looks to Gaul.
It's also easy to assume that ancient Romans were always victorious until their fall around 487.  This work contradicts that image.  It says the Gauls defeated the Romans previously and the doc somewhat traces the development in which the Romans could become victorious against that group.
I usually hate cheesy reenactments.  However, given the low budgets of most documentaries, I must admit the period pieces here were ornate, the cast was sizeable, and even the dwellings they should took some effort to make.  The actor playing Vercingetorix is beefy and burly.  He has thick chest and back hair.  For those who love men called ""bears"" nowadays, their tongues will drop to the ground.
Perhaps this documentary was made in the 1980s because the scholars wore HUGE eyeglasses that were only sold then and would be deemed tacky nowadays.
There was just something kinda dull about this work.  However, it did make me think of the French comic strip ""Asterix.""",1244160000,,1511,4.859375
