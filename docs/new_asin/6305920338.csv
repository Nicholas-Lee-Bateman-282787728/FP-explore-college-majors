The attention to detail, the common sense approach, the serene exposition and visual clarification makes it a winner. Finally, a video that focuses on the CEREMONY itself, as opposed to the whole shebang of pre-wedding and post-wedding ceremonies (which I find droll).
It gave me that feeling I had when I finally realized I could spell SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS.  A feeling of confidence, serenity (and a little cockiness).
