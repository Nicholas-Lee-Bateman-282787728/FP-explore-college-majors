8754660,2,B01D1VJ83O,"Cowboy is a Western about a cattle drive based on memoirs by Frank Harris.

The first thing wrong with this 1958 release is the serious miscasting of the two leads. Glenn Ford can be a tough guy, but never a mean one as this role requires.  If one remembers his ruthless anti-heroes from Champion, The Bad And The Beautiful and Ace In The Hole, Kirk Douglas would have been a better choice, As for Jack Lemmon, he is simply in the wrong movie. Later he would be on target as the  goofy warlock in Bell, Book & Candle.

Since the film is based on memoirs, theres very little plot so were stuck with an episodic epic that grows tiresome as it plods along. Also, the role reversal between the two men is quite predictable and not all together believable. Another thing, in most Westerns the landscape and the photography are usually enough to get one to sit even through the weakest of the lot. In this instance, the landscape is boring and the Technicolor quite garish. On top of that, the Copland-esque musical score is completely inadequate. To this viewer this type of material would seem to require a guitar and a harmonica, not a Hollywood Bowl Symphonic rendition of a Fanfare For The Common Cowhand. The gorgeous Anna Kashfi is completely wasted in a role that comes off as an afterthought, and some sequences that don't add anything to the plot, like the episode involving hens, are quite unpleasant to watch.

If you want a similarly themed, but far superior Western, I would suggest Howard Hawks Red River where Wayne and Clift provide the kind of sparks that are sorely missing in this sad outing. To witness Glenn Ford at his pinnacle, take a look at 3:10 To Yuma and in the case of Jack Lemmon check out any of his early comedies with Judy Holliday, or the aforementioned witch delight with Kim Novak. As to director Delmer Daves,go for his Broken Arrow or his other Glenn Ford outing (Yuma). Those two really rock with tension. The only nice thing I can say about this over priced Twilight Time Blu-Ray, is that the image is very sharp.",1509840000,,2048,4.554347826086956
