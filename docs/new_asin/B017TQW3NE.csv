7534017,2,B017TQW3NE,"Yikes. And that's all I can say is YIKES! WOW! So I grew up loving The Lion King, and even its sequel Simba's Pride. I've loved The Lion King since I was 3 years old. And WOW! This...yikes.

So I won't lie, originally I actually thought I would like this. Mainly due to the fact that sneak peek with Kion roaring and the lion clouds appearing was very epic.

I actually got chills. But, when I finally watched it, I was highly disgusted.

Animation:
WHAT the heck happened?! The animation is so cheap in this. The lions look weird, Simba's eyebrows look beyond strange and they almost like Chibi like. Also, if you pay attention, when the lions walk, they don't even bend their paws. It just looks like a walking action figure. Its really bad when a movie from the 1980s has better graphics/animation than today.

Characters:
Dear God...what happened? Simba and Kiara are both extremely out of character. And these new characters...eh. Kion's the only cool one, but the other members of the Lion Guard are not that impressive. The honey badger is extremely annoying, and the others don't have any character development other than being the ""Fastest, strongest, keenist of sight""

Story:
Extremely lame, and just not all that interesting. Basically Simba wants Kion to assemble the new Lion Guard to protect the pridelands, but honestly most of this is just Kion goofing off with his friends. Nothing about this is taken seriously. It's filled with fart jokes, extremely cringing 'sayings' and just boring.

Music:
Pretty boring, forgetful and bland. Its hard to believe this is from the same creators as The Lion King

Another huge problem I have, is Kion getting that mark on his shoulder of a lion roaring. I'm sorry...when did this become My Little Pony? Kion basically got a Cutie Mark. Come on, this is just awful. And Kion randomly gives his friends their own 'cutie marks'

So...basically magic is in The Lion King now? A series about the Circle of Life? Just about the life of African animals, nothing else. Magic isn't allowed, it doesn't make sense or fit in.

What the heck? This isn't Cinderella, this is The Lion King! I just couldn't stop cringing through this. Its nothing but fart jokes, badly written characters, forgettable music, and a lazy story.

Look creators, every Lion King fan knows that if we ever wanted a 'remake' or 'sequel' we would want something about Mufasa and Scar's past/cubhood. Now THAT would be worth seeing. Not this. This is just cringing.

Is it the WORST thing? No, but its really bad. Especially when comparing to the original movie.",1450396800,24,2578,4.783783783783784

She lovingly calls this the ""Lion Garden,"" but it is so cute that I don't want to correct her.  I highly recommend this series for any child, all ages.  My 9 yr old son doesn't even mind sitting with his little sister to watch this show.  I think one of the best episodes is ""The Lost Gorillas,"" which is full of whimsy, fun songs and great opportunities for the older children in your home to learn about the forests of Africa.  Every episode offers insight into biology and helps kids learn about new and exciting animals. I can't thank Disney enough for bringing this story back to life with the ""Lion Guard.""",1487116800,,734,4.321167883211679

7534092,4,B017TQW3NE,"I was a lion king kid so I was excited that they decided to revive the series when I had kids. The tv movie its self doesn't exactly fit into the actual movie series (there's this little plot hole of missing characters especially Kion in Simba's Pride, and the Lion Guard itself) but if you ignore that part or just watch it on its own its not bad. Its a movie to start off a kids television show and I cannot complain. The series is adorable and my children love it and the stories it tells.

So if your looking for an ACTUAL addition to the Lion King series this isn't really it, but if you just want to see your favorite characters and then some this will fill in those holes for you. (Remember this is the opening to a tv series currently on Disney and Disney Jr., so for the rest of the story you will have to tune in or buy the series once it goes to DVD/Blu Ray)",1463011200,2,869,4.0523255813953485

7534108,1,B017TQW3NE,"I was looking forward to this movie as I'd grown up with the Lion King and figured I couldn't go wrong. Oh how wrong I was.
I tore it from the packaging after purchasing it locally. Soon after the opening, I realized this title did not lead up to my expectations in any way. The animation completely lacks the intricacy and delight of the Lion King, 1-2; it is flat and overly cartoonish, like the programs on Cartoon Network. With all of the technology available today, particularly in the art field, I could not believe the poorly presented art reminiscent of a sub-par children's book from the dollar store come to life. The voices of the characters were no better than the animation; they grated my nerves to no end. And to my great dismay, the hyenas were an absolute disgrace to the unique and hilarious characters they once were.
I'm sure a child may be able to sit through this garbage the new Disney has spun, but as a 20-something, I found it a shame to the original Lion King. I pity the parents of children who will demand to watch this repeatedly when I couldn't even finish it.",1461110400,3,1091,4.46

It was fun to see the relationships build, but also experience the humor, music, and more in every episode. The writing in the series was strong and the characters that are developed are strong. In every episode there are specific messages being shared as well and as a parent I can say that the messages I saw were ones that I want my daughters to be hearing. The animation was of high-quality and you can see and experience the passion of the animators and writers in how well both mesh together to create a wonderful series your whole family will enjoy!

While I was a little bit older teen when it came out, my niece and nephew made this their most watched movie of choice. I had it all memorized and can sing the lyrics to all the songs! Can you feel the love tonight? Yes, yes I can!

The follow up movie The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar is about Kion, Simba and Nala's second cub. He becomes the leader of ""the Lion Guard"" and must prove he is worthy of the title and the responsibility.

As usual, there is a lovable cast of quirky characters full of humor and wit. I don't always love follow up movies to huge hits because it's so hard to live up to the expectation. However, this one actually captivated me! It has a story all on it's own but tied in to the original. We even get a cameo appearance from Mufasa!

This definitely lives up to the spirit of the Lion King but with it's own qualities to love.

I really enjoyed the music on this one as well. It's catchy and heart warming and true to the Disney spirit. I love that The Lion Guard will be one my kids grow up on!",1457740800,,1167,3.995708154506438

The timeline is off and the characters you know and love look the same, but have different personalities because the focus is not on them. It's on Kion, the second born of Simba and Nala.

The movie is just under an hour long so it is a quick family movie. We have watched these movie numerous times and I love that we have it on DVD now because it is no longer on television.

7534154,5,B017TQW3NE,"Looking forward to the new Lion Guard Television Movie coming to DVD.  A new chapter in the Lion King Saga.
The picture is sure to be flawless and the sound remarkable.  I will update my review of this once it comes in, but for the time I
am giving this item 5 stars because it is part of a franchise that is making its way back to audiences who cherished it back in 1994.

The songs are great and the animation is very fluid and much better than that of a Saturday morning cartoon.
Our family loves everything about the Lion Guard .  Kion , Simba's 2nd cub after daughter Kiara who will one day rule the pride lands ; is marked with an old symbol and a rare gift of being able to have a mighty roar that calls upon the great leaders of the lion guard from the past.

We learn that the roar was thought to be ended because Mufassa's brother Scar, who was the last leader of the lion guard had abused its power and tried to kill the other members of the guard.  The roar returns when Kion takes a step up into bravery and must choose the bravest, the fastest , the keenest of sight, the strongest, and the most fierce.

7534161,5,B017TQW3NE,"People comparing to the original are nostalgic idiots. This is a great way to relaunch Lion King for a new generation. The plot is fairly simple but keep in mind this is not a full length animated feature. It's a launch for a new series that sets the stage for the episodes to come. It moves quickly enough. Characters are dynamic and cute. Music is fantastic.

If you go back and watch the original, yes it's good but it also really drags in places (between music numbers) and is really heavy for some age groups. The original is not as good as I remember it as a kid. Disney has done a great job of keeping a steady pace and integrating appeal for the chaperoning adults in the newer releases.

All three of my boys (ages 8, 4, and just turned 2) love the lion guard and my 2 year old especially is so enthusiastic about the music, particularly the title song, that he's having a Lion Guard birthday this weekend.",1453939200,,915,4.345029239766082

7534170,4,B017TQW3NE,"Okay. No, it's not as good as the original movie. There's no way it could have been. And I don't love it as much as Lion King 2. But you know what? It beats Lion King 1 1/2 by MILES.

This series is very clearly marketed towards the adults that grew up with The Lion King who are now having kids of their own, and there's no shame in that. Given the general quality of the animation and music, it's fine for something capitalizing on that. Parents are going to enjoy watching this with their kids, plain and simple. Yes, if you were a deep, DEEP fan, you're probably going to complain about series plot holes, but this is the series that spent YEARS giving us merch with a firstborn male child, even giving him a NAME (Kopa), and then completely retconning him in movie 2 for firstborn Kiara. There were going to be retcons, and fanatics like me were going to be a bit miffed, but, getting past that, it's fine as entertainment.

Of course, the quality of the show proper is still unknown, but this gives me hope. I'm certainly going to be buying the season once episode one is out. And, with any luck, I'll get to enjoy lots of the Lion Guard for several seasons to come.",1452124800,7,1172,4.298642533936651

The sings are easy to get stuck in your head. To try and compare it to the original is unfair. The lion king is iconic, and this is only an introduction to the Disney junior show that begins in February. Considering the fact that it is Disney junior, you must understand that it is for the younger age group so the plot line must be simple for them to follow. Bottom line, we love it. I'm just not liking the current price point for a 45 minute movie. But we will more than likely buy it because the kids keep asking for it.",1451174400,15,698,4.028776978417266
7534173,1,B017TQW3NE,"I loved the Lion King when it came out, but I've never lost sight of the simple fact that its story is extremely biased and human-centric: lions good, hyenas bad. This is purely based on human views of the two animals and not at all on their behavior or society. In the wild, hyenas have a complex pack culture dominated by females where, in hard times, they still look after the young first. They are not just scavengers but alpha predators; however, because of their appearance and sound, we revile them. Lions, on the other hand, can be pretty cowardly and callous, and in hard times have been known to kill their cubs to survive, yet are held up as grand and noble beasts based purely on their appearance.

So here we are again with more of the same. Pretty, 'fun' animals good: check. The heroes are a lion, a honey badger, a cheetah, a hippo, and some variety of insect-eating bird. Never mind that hippos are notoriously aggressive and rather disgusting animals, and one of the most feared creatures in Africa.

Ugly animals bad: check. So far the antagonists we have seen include the hyenas, a vulture, and a crocodile. At least in the original movie we had a bad lion and a good warthog (and Poombah is still around, but I think he falls on the side of 'gross is funny').

Also, the Lion Guard consists of five members, only one of which is female, and the leader is naturally male even though it is a female character, his sister, being groomed for leadership. Well, okay, at least his sister is being groomed for leadership, but another female lion cub acted like a stereotypical girl, whining over a broken claw, bugs, and every other little thing, and the sister just had to hurt herself and be rescued.

Oh, and we get casual racism. Simba chastises his son for even thinking of bring non-lions into his Lion Guard. Though the son's decision is eventually vindicated and upheld, this was a very disappointing thing to see from Simba, a character who should know better after his long associating with a certain warthog and meerkat duo.

There's also a lot of music, at least in the pilot. We get a song that is clearly meant to be a successor to Hakuna Matata without really explaining much, and a lot of other songs featuring quite a few trite lyrics that go well with the trite dialogue when they're not singing.  The songs and dialogue both seem to rely a lot on repetition to make their points. There's also the frequent scattering of catch phrases throughout; each character seems to have their own African, or perhaps pseudo-African, catchphrase or phrases, which they use with great regularity.

Ultimately, I am unimpressed. This show goes to great lengths to hit all of the old clich&eacute;s. I could practically just run down a checklist of them. In fact, I believe I just did.",1451001600,16,2802,4.625754527162978
