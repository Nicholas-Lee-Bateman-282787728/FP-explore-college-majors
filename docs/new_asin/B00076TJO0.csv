8324860,1,B00076TJO0,"If anyone out there is like me and has some knowledge of card counting and understands the basic concepts of how it works, do not purchase this CD. It explores the surface of counting and not much else, you will definately not learn any new information. If you already own a book on the basics of card counting you will find this purchase very unsatisfying and not worth the cash.",1125964800,11,380,4.442857142857143

For $30 it's not much of a risk.  From the first time I watched the DVD I was pretty impressed by the quality of the production.  Everything is pretty much covered, from the basics of playing blackjack to the techniques of card counting.  Everything is explained in pretty simple terms, so it's eaasy to follow, although I did have to rewind a few times.  I really like the extras on the DVD, especially where you can practice your counting interactively.  I was very slow at first, but I am defninitely improving!  About the only complaint I would have about this DVD is that it somehow makes card counting look too easy!  Like I said before,  it is very easy to follow, especially with all the nice graphics, etc., but that can give you a false sense of security.  I've checked some technical stuff they talk about and everything they say is correct.  I would recommend watching this DVD (especially the parts on counting) over and over again and practicing.  Overall I was impressed by this DVD and was satisfied with my purchase.  It's cleared up some confusing/conflicting info that I've read in other books/websites and will go ahead and buy the whole training course.  Good luck!!",1114387200,6,1389,4.639344262295082

This DVD is what I've been waiting for.  I've tried a lot of different approaches to blackjack, but with no success.  I'm confident those days are over. The MIT Blackjack Team shows you how to play the right way.  This DVD does a great job of breaking down and teaching you the fundamentals of

card counting.  If you're a frustrated blackjack player looking for answers I highly recommend this DVD.",1110672000,5,409,4.611111111111111
8324864,5,B00076TJO0,"I am a novice when it comes to blackjack but I have always been interested in the game. I have picked up a blackjack book from time to time, but have never been able to finish one. The material always seemed either a little intimidating and difficult to understand, or at times simply boring. I would liken the experience to trying to learn a computer language for the first time by reading a book - a tough task without the interactive experience of a classroom setting. This is why this DVD is invaluable for someone like me. Not only did this DVD teach me in easy-to-understand steps how to play blackjack and count cards, but more importantly it did so in a way that kept me interested the whole way through. The visual demonstrations and exercises in the DVD are really effective. I was also impresssed by the MIT guys in this DVD. They come across as very credible and genuine guys. I highly recommend 60 Minutes to Winning Blackjack.  For those interested in learning how to win at blackjack, it's money well spent.",1108598400,6,1022,4.554347826086956
8324865,2,B00076TJO0,"Good for beginners or someone that has never played before, but I was looking for something more advanced coming from the MIT team. It doesn't go into any detail of any advanced techniques that I'm sure they used.  You would be better off buying a book for a lot less money. I felt I got ripped off.",1105574400,5,299,4.245614035087719
