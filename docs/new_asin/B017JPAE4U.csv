7507382,5,B017JPAE4U,"I had no intention of watching this show.  I detest reality TV & mistakenly thought this was just another reality TV show.  Anyway, the show happened to come on one night when I was busy in the kitchen & I did not have time to change the channel to something else.  Thank goodness for that because this is now one of my all night favorite shows.  It shows very complex characters who do really bad things at times, but you can still relate to the characters.  Overall, I found the show to be extremely funny because the characters were so true to life.  Just flawed human beings which meant that some of the characters were rather tragic also.  I really have to start checking out shows before I just dismiss them.  ""Breaking Bad"" was another show that I kept resisting watching because the plot just did not sound like it would appeal to me.  I was wrong about that show also.  It is now one of my all time favorite shows.",1455235200,3,923,4.345029239766082
7507383,5,B017JPAE4U,"At first I did not want to watch it. I am not a fan of reality shows and certainly not the bachelor. I find them boring and always the same. The women are always the same. The men are always the same. The situation is repetitive. So when I was watching another show and this show the first episode played right after on demand. I wasn't ready to grab the remote and said screw it why not. I started to watch and saw that it was exactly like those shows mentioned above in every way. Boring & repetitive. But then I continue watching. I started to like the unusual female characters. The unexpected occurred. They showed normal people. Normal woman, Normal men. Normal situation I could even relate to myself. It show behind the scenes of what happens behind the shows. The more I watched and actually saw the personality of the girls. The more I like it. It shows humanity. It showed the exact things that the reality shows are lacking. Normalcy. It has a beautiful buck tooth woman. A single mom looking for love who ends up being a little psycho. It shows the drama behind the camera. It shows life and death. The more I watched it the more I really liked it and started to actually route for people. So, now it is on it's second season and I can honestly say they did a hell of a job catching someone who hates shows like this and I would even add this to my favorites list. Top three at the least. I highly suggest this show if you are like me. You won't be disappointed. I wasn't.",1454198400,8,1485,4.288256227758007
7507384,5,B017JPAE4U,My favorite new show in years. A wicked look behind the scenes of a reality tv show. Constance Zimmer and Shiri Appleby brilliantly play two of the most complex and interesting women in the history of television.,1454025600,7,212,4.756756756756757
7507385,4,B017JPAE4U,"The first season of UnREAL comprises 10 episodes and follows a Bachelor-style reality show in which a group of women vie for the affections of an attractive Englishman. But the focus of the season is on the producers and crew of the show as they manipulate the guests, cross just about every moral barrier, engage in a variety of sexual liaisons, and use all manner of backstabbing in their attempts to gain power in Hollywood.

The primary focus of the show is Rachel Goldberg (portrayed wonderfully by Shiri Appleby), a producer with a knack for getting people to do things they don't want to do. Throughout the episodes, Rachel tries to atone for her past (alluded to frequently--she seems to have caused substantial problems on a previous season of Everlasting, the ersatz reality show in the series) and come to grips with her relationships with others. Appleby alone is probably reason enough to watch the show.

The women vying for the bachelor's affections include a lawyer whose father dies during filming, a bipolar mother who must stay on her medications, a closeted lesbian, and a savvy Latina who seems more aware than others of the unreality of the entire situation. Other characters come and go, but the focus really is on the show's producers.

Don't expect a behind-the-scenes expos&eacute; here. The focus is not on showing the machinations behind the scenes of a reality show or even on parodying such shows (see the wonderful Joe Schmo series for the latter) but on the activities of Everlasting's creative team. And since the members of the team seem to have extremely low morals, this show won't be for everyone. But for those who do not demand a perfect character to root for, UnREAL should be enjoyable.

(It's worth noting that one of the creative minds behind the series is Marti Noxon, whose previous credits include Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Point Pleasant, Glee, Mad Men, and Code Black.)",1453852800,10,1924,4.892638036809816

7507391,5,B017JPAE4U,"I haven't re-watched Season One yet, but I'm looking forward to it with great eagerness.  Although I've never watched The Bachelor/ette, I have no doubt that UnREAL is not too far from the truth of how the Reality TV Sausage is made.  UnREAL almost makes me want to watch The Bachelor/ette... almost.  It's an amazing show, and the casting is perfect.",1465776000,,351,4.721311475409836
7507392,5,B017JPAE4U,"Watched the first season on TV.  Wanted to share with a couple of friends who are total reality show freaks, especially when it comes to the Bachelor and Bachelorette franchises.  They were able to watch a couple of episodes, but the rest of the season just disappeared.  Bought this for them.  It's all a matter of taste, but I think it's an incredible parody of the aforementioned reality shows, really well-written, completely enjoyable, funny and dramatic at the same time, and regardless of what Chris what's-his-name, the host of the Bachelor says, nothing can convince me Unreal doesn't depict the 'reality' of those shows.",1463875200,5,630,5.028846153846154

7507395,1,B017JPAE4U,"The usual mass consumption media distribution of personalities, racial stereotypes (and typing by others), faux sexuality, obscenities as a substitute for reasonably intelligent dialogue for TV junkies that most likely find this fantasy more interesting than their own lives.
The usual conflict pair of a self centered egoist with ratings (i.e. money) as her primary reinforcer vs. her foil; a plain but likable cohort.
Series is good for those who rate high on most every decent person's ""wish I didn't know"" list thus now being able to laugh at made-up characters who would rate even higher.",1456876800,,593,5.1875
8739536,5,B017JPAE4U,"Truly one of the best, most riveting shows of all time. Constance Zimmer and Shiri Appleby absolutely knock it out of the park. I would have liked more special features, but perhaps in future seasons they will include some!",1530835200,,223,4.743589743589744
