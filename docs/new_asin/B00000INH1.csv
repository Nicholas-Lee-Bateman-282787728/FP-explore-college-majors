7910920,5,B00000INH1,"I used this as a class video to introduce the 6thy graders to how mining occurs in the US. This particular mining experience shows the use of micrsocopic techniques to recover gold. This is a great video for showing how small particles of a metal cen be found, mined, and profitably recovered. An additional tie in to the class is that we will be visiting a closed zinc mine in Ogdensburg, New Jersey as a field trip (The Sterling Hill Mining Museum). There, we will be able to see some 90 species of fluorescent minerals found in one location (New Jersey's own ""goldmine"").",1392854400,,574,4.58252427184466
