2669586,5,B000JBXP2A,"As always, this Diego dvd is great.  My son loves Diego and Dora.  This is his newest dvd and it is no disappointment.  He gets simply mesmerized by it and I don't mind it either.  He's starting to remember the sounds that different animals make and copies Diego when he makes the sounds during the movie.  It's great to see him having fun and learning something at the same time.",1215302400,2,380,4.371428571428571
2669587,5,B000JBXP2A,"I bought this dvd for my 2 yr. old son a few weeks ago, and he absolutely loves it!!! He has watched it more times than I can count. I don't mind him watching it either because it is very educational and he respondes to the questions that Diego asks. So it is a valuable learning tool!! I am sure to buy many more Diego movies!!!",1214697600,,329,4.0
2669588,5,B000JBXP2A,"...and educational, as well.  My daughter learns about animals, working together, and a foreign language.  I recommend this 100% to anyone with young children.",1187740800,,159,5.583333333333333
2669589,5,B000JBXP2A,"It is highly educational with lots of interesting facts about the animals and their habitat. The way the facts were presented in this DVD makes learning easy and memorable.

My 3YO daughter could remember the number of toes a jaguar have, the types of animals who sleep in the day and the features of a macaw, by  just after watching the DVD once!

This show is a good extension to Dora. Now i'm convinced that i should get the whole series of Go Diego Go!",1178668800,7,456,4.341176470588235
2669590,4,B000JBXP2A,"Both of my kids, [..], enjoy watching this video.  It has cute stories and they learn a little about animals and there habitat while watching. The DVD has entertainment and some educational value.",1178409600,2,196,4.9393939393939394
2669591,5,B000JBXP2A,So I have Diego fans.  All 3 of my kids love this movie.  I actually don't mind watching this movie with them.  The great thing about this video is it has a few different episodes on it.  We own quite a few Diego items.  Great expansion of Dora which my kids love as well.  Definitely recommend this DVD.,1172016000,8,304,4.155172413793103
2669592,5,B000JBXP2A,"Ok, I'm sure I'm not the only parent whose kid is nuts for that Spanish kid who is always screaming and hugging Extreemly dangerous animals. Yes, I love my kid learning these valuable lessons as well. However, Diego helps with bed time. The DVD has a nice feature where you can basically loop the episodes all night long so if your kid does wake up in the middle of the night, Diego is there. By the way, my kid has a tv in her room and we have difficulties getting our daughter to NOT sleep in our bed so I'm sure you'll have diff needs from me. It's a fun DVD to watch and play with your kid. Nice buy.",1350345600,,604,4.041666666666667
2669593,5,B000JBXP2A,My daughter watches Dora and Diego cartoons on tv in the morning and likes them. I got this and other educational dvd's to use during the afternoons when trashy cartoons come on so my daughter won't learn bad words and manners from them.  Avoid or pay attention really closely to afternoon cartoons for your little ones!,1335916800,,320,4.714285714285714
2669594,5,B000JBXP2A,Too much advertising of other episodes but my daughter loves this dvd and i find the picture to be clear the sound perfect and the dvd is worth every money,1322179200,,155,4.2

2669596,5,B000JBXP2A,Great entertainment for the little one and enjoyable for the adult also!!  I've seen the DVD countless times and it still is cute.  Diego and baby Jaguar are real winners.  Perfect for a 3-year old boy.,1291680000,,202,4.555555555555555
2669597,5,B000JBXP2A,"my son loves the episodes on the disc,he watches it a lot,sometime i think too much. but they are good and he makes the jaguar noise now when watching animal planet.

thanks",1287273600,,173,4.40625
2669598,4,B000JBXP2A,Excellent at keeping my 2 year old son occupied in the car.  He loves to sing along and growl with baby jaguar!,1284854400,,111,4.045454545454546
2669599,1,B000JBXP2A,"It irks me when random magic is thrown into kids' cartoons.  We're all expecting animals and adventures, not sorcery.  TV cartoons for older kids are already saturated with the magic and fighting-against-evil themes.  Really irks me.",1282867200,10,233,5.416666666666667
2669600,5,B000JBXP2A,"The Dora and Diego series are interactive and allows your children to respond to questions that are asked. it is much better than just sitting your child in front of a bunch of fast, kick butt, violent animated cartoons that are so much the norm these days. But please do not use these videos as your ""babysitters."" watch and learn with them!",1269475200,,342,4.532258064516129
2669601,1,B000JBXP2A,"Our family loves Diego and Dora but we've found you have to carefully review each episode now before showing the kids (ages 2 and 4).  in the Jaguar episode his voice gets trapped in a magic bottle and Diego is able to find and open the bottle and you see the animal's voice come out of the bottle and float back into the jaguar's body.  Maybe not enough to keep most parents away but we are not going to introduce our kids to witchcraft and magic just for the sake of showing them the Diego movies they like.

I hope in the future Diego and Dora stick to innocent children's themes!! Animal rescue is a great idea. Stay with it.",1216944000,25,629,4.225
