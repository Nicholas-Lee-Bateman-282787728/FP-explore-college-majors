8510219,4,B0074V61MO,"These two documentaries cover everything from live birth to prostitution to (a very gory) hair transplant surgery in swingin' 1960's London. The films show a lot of pleasant things to look at (burlesque dancers, nude posing, go-go dancing) but then it throws in some gruesome images (a slaughterhouse, a corn being removed from a foot, the bloody hair transplant). Lots of sexy girls, strange ""secret"" places and nighttime activities are shown in these two films. This is a version of London that only the locals knew about and it's a fun ride. If you're a fan of retro fashion and lifestyles, these movies are a blast! I saw them in HD and the picture quality was mind-blowing considering how old they were.",1389571200,,708,4.811475409836065
