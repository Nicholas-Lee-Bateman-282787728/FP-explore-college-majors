8215524,5,B000UX6O5C,"When I first popped the DVD in, the production and quality seemed a little low budget and iffy. My fears were quickly allayed, however, when I began watching the interviews. I can't speak for older or long time fans (I was too young to see GNR in their heyday) but these are very good interviews that provide an excellent look into the band and the release of Use Your Illusion I/II. The people interviewed are Axl, Slash, Duff (and Lenny Kravitz), and Dizzy. There's also footage of a signing where you can see all the original members (Axl, Slash, Duff, Izzy, and Steve) though unfortunately there are no interviews with Izzy or Steve. There's also some news footage and interview with Axl about his getting arrested for getting into a fight with his drunk neighbour. Finally, there's court footage  from the dispute between Steve and the band over royalties, though it is unfortunately cut short.

All in all, this is a must have for any GNR fan. I enjoyed watching every minute.",1261872000,3,982,4.703488372093023
8215525,3,B000UX6O5C,This was a very interesting look back at Guns N'Roses. There is plenty of interveiws with each of the guys and Lenny Kravitz but two of the interveiws get cut before they are finish. There is the interveiw with the original band members at a press signing that is cut short and there is the trial where Steven Adler sued for his share of the royalties after he was kicked out of the band. But the trial is cut short we never see the end of it. They cut it right in the middle. It is a good dvd but a little disappointing because of how they cut some interveiws int he middle.,1249603200,4,575,4.097345132743363
