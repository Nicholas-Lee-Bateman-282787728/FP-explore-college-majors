8192930,4,B000PQLJ4A,"I enjoyed the series, although it got a bit sentimental at times, and made Douglas Jardine into such a villain that I half expected to see scenes of him kicking puppies and pulling the wings off butterflies.  Not surprisingly, this Australian production is pretty slanted towards one side, although it's hard to argue that the Australians weren't the wronged party in this Ashes series.

I'll bet this miniseries got quite the reception back in 1984, when quite a number of the participants were still alive.  It isn't commercially available, but it is possible still to find this online at various sites, and cricket fans should greatly enjoy this production.",1437264000,,660,5.036697247706422
8192931,4,B000PQLJ4A,"I liked ""Bodyline"" because it first went into some of the history of both the British Commonwealth and of some of the main protaginists, without being too long-winded about it. I would imagine all Australians have at least heard of the infamous ""Bodyline Test"", But it was so long ago that many people have forgotten what it was all about. I very much like Gary Sweet as Don Bradman, and Hugo Weaving with his ability to put on a haughty nature as Douglas Jardine was also perfect.

All in all a thoroughly enjoyable movie.",1430611200,,523,4.5638297872340425
8192932,5,B000PQLJ4A,"I remember seeing this years ago and it was a true nostalgic journey of three amazing people, and based on true events. Brilliantly directed, acted and presented. be aware that it's an Aussie version, and will only work on a region free DVD player.",1405209600,,248,4.659090909090909

8192934,5,B000PQLJ4A,"First Class rendition, dramatization, cast etc.
Brings to life the extreme competitiveness that was part of the series of cricket matches between England and Australia.
Win at all costs!
Brilliantly done including the minor bits where Jardine is portrayed as slightly sensitive - when he gets Harold Larwood a new pair of cricket shoes because Larwood can't afford his own.
Fantastic and a must have for any cricket fan or serious collector of first class TV Shows!",1206662400,2,465,5.0519480519480515
