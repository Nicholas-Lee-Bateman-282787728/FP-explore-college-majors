8326117,1,B0015R8XAG,"My opinion is that this is the worst Sturgis DVD I have ever seen. It is advertised as 2007, but seems generic to any year at Sturgis. The narrator seems to me to be monotone and NEGATIVE in the presentation.  I was AT Sturgis 2007 (and a LOT of other years).  I sent it back to get a refund. I think there are much better and more upbeat videos to buy.",1226620800,,353,3.9577464788732395
