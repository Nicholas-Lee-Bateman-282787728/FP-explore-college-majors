8291973,4,B001D6XMFU,"I have a mess-o'-Man'lin Instruction books, dvd's, CD's, and books with the tabulature in it, and I had to try to follow when I have been playing the guitars, and Bass for 30+ years, and believe me, I have these in spades, so I share them as I do anything else, as not everyone is set up for the great and final (I hope, Blu-Ray)~!
  I was so tired of buying record players, and then tapes, Cassettes, but I am sure glad that I waited for the DVD and CD to finally take their proper spot before I drop dead w.o. learning my ""MAN-LIN"" as Bert Casey says ""Mandolin""..he chops the ""do"" off, and so did I after playing along with the CD, DVD, and I bought a bevy of VHS tapes, (NO BETAs though)!
 These are just as good, easily rewound to the last lesson, and it has whatever the DVD and other disks have, so why throw the VCR's out??
This is one more way to get your friends in on a fad that is quickly growing in our vast country, and country or bluegrass just never leaves us, does it?
 So, I have and I buy more, as most of my friends and I are musicians, and we are not yet with ""sound-rooms"" with 1000 watts of power....(yet).
 So, while my wife was watching TV on the Front-room TV, I put in my VHS tape in my bedroom TV with two VCR's that I just re-purchased, as I stupidly threw them out.
 But, have you ever thought of how many folks still have VCR's of the VHS type???
 All of my friends have them plus the Blu-Rays!! So I am learning very fast with my VHS while ""wifey"", Barbara watches her GEMS shows in the sitting room.
 This is one great set up!
 So I may not have given a 10 to this review, but, I do NOT give them out too easily anyway, and this is a ten (10) thought!
 Keep your VCR's as there are hundreds of thousands of these hanging around, and seeing that I sell on Amazon, I am not greedy and I like music and I am happy to spread these around for a minor cost, and $2.00 to ship...what else can a learner-player want??
 I have my ""SLAP-BASS"" VHS tape and I am finally using the thumb and pluck method to jazz up my basses too.
 So, I will give this a higher mark than I had thought of giving it, as we cannot afford to get rid of working media. N~E~V~E~R~!~!~!
