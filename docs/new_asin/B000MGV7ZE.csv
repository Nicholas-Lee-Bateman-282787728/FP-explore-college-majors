8617199,5,B000MGV7ZE,"Unknown in the United States Les Dawson
was one of the funniest comics in 1970s and '80s Britain.  His humor is quite drole.  He will do anything for a laugh like sing the song Feelings out of key.  His humor has been described as norhern referring to the part of the country he's from-- wicked, biting and very funny.  His humor, though, might not click with everyone and some may not get his accent. A joke by Dawson runs like -- I'm not saying my wife is ugly but she uses her lower lip as a bathing cap.",1379030400,,507,4.142857142857143
