991237,5,6305214522,"This is an excellent western film.  You should consider watching it for Ben Johnson's role, alone.  Mr. Johnson is a great western film actor, and his role as ""Uncle Jack"" is superb.  If you enjoy western genre, I suggest you consider adding this film to your collection.  The team of Tom Selleck, Sam Elliott, and Jeff Osterhage is an excellent mix.  I hope Hollywood will take advantage of this talented team and put these guys together again soon.  Buy the DVD; you won't be disappointed.",1156982400,11,491,4.7176470588235295
991238,4,6305214522,"The day of John Wayne, James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Henry Fonda, and the rest is gone. They made Westerns when there were still people alive who knew what the old west was really like and gave them pointers. When Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot made a few Westerns several years ago, they may not be quite up to the standards of classics like the ""Magnificent Seven"", ""High Noon"", and ""Hondo"" but I personally think they are excellent and a far cry better than any other Westerns made in the last 20 years. The cast even includes a few old timers from the classic Westerns like Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. which is a real treat since they have still got what it takes to create a great character. With the upcoming release of ""The Sacketts"" you have all the more reason to view it and this as they go together like a set. I recommend purchasing them both and ""The Last Stand at Saber River"", ""Crossfire Trail"", and ""Conagher"". All excellent modern Westerns with Tom Selleck and/or Sam Elliot.",1148256000,19,991,4.511111111111111
991239,4,6305214522,"While away fighting the Civil War (Tom Sellick for the Union and Sam Elliot for the Confederacy), Sam's wife (Catherine Ross) and family are kidnapped by Confederate Raiders intent on selling them in Mexico to finance their ongoing war. Tom & Sam are reunited and off to the rescue! Good, above average western with some funny scenes, some drama, and lots of good old fashioned shooting the bad guys!",1129161600,3,400,4.811594202898551
991240,1,6305214522,"I'm a Selleck fan and hold Elliot to be a close second in the realm of movie and TV cowboys.  And I think that Ross is about as sweet as eye candy can get.  But, try as they all might, they just can't get this horse to go.

The plot is ludicrous, the pace is incredibily uneven, the bad guys are caricatures, and, worst of all, this viewer just didn't care if any of the characters lived or died.  Actually, if they had died, the whole thing would have sooner come to a merciful end.

Selleck is OK, Elliot scowls a lot, and (forgive me) Ross does the worst acting of a commendable career.

As others have said -- see Monte Walsh or Riders of the Purple Sage.  Just shoot his horse.",1103932800,16,682,4.121212121212121
991241,5,6305214522,"""The Shadow Riders"" has all the grit, matter-of-fact speech, incredible landscapes and action of a great Louis L'Amour book. Tom Selleck, Sam Elliot and Jeff Osterhage also starred in ""The Sacketts"" in 1979, and do just as fine a job in this movie as that one.
The part that will surprise you is how strong the female lead role is. Katharine Ross does an excellent job as the fiesty Kate Connery, the love interest of Dal Travern (Sam Elliot). She had as good a character and as much screen time as many of today's heriones -- a highly unusual circumstance in the early 80s and certainly unusual for the genre.
""The Shadow Riders"" has a great mix of romance, action, humor and good old fashioned Western elements. This mix makes the film appealing to a much wider audience than just Western fans or Louis L'Amour fans -- although they will come away thrilled.",1065830400,81,859,4.620915032679738
991242,5,6305214522,"This movie is based on the book by Louis L'Amour by the same name.  It doesn't follow the book too closely (which usually bothers me, but they did this very well) but still came up with a very entertaining movie that hangs well together.  The story is about 3 brothers and two sisters.  Two of the brothers fought on opposite sides of the Civil War, but meet up just as the war has ended when renegades are about to hang one of them.  They go home to discover that more renegades have stolen the third brother and both little sisters.  This movie has some great actors in it and it's just a good all-around entertainment movie.",1059436800,41,627,4.370689655172414

The two of them made a number of Louis L'Amour novels into TV Movies both together and separately. These movies celebrated, as did L'Amour's novels, the tall iconic figures that also usually populate Randolph Scott/ Budd Boetticher westerns.
Code and family feature prominently in this tales. Entertaining to watch and fun to recognize the additional group of famed character actors that work in them. War and Peace? Absolutely not, and proud of it.",1504051200,2,607,4.79047619047619

Also, the humor comes across better and more natural between the actors. On the other hand, the acting of everybody not named Selleck, Johnson and Elliot, was stilted and forced. Poor Ms. Ross had to perform an interminably long scene on the beach that was poorly staged and completely telegraphed. johnson was 80% wasted in his role as Uncle Jack, and the scene where they bust him out of prison is absurd. I get the feeling that the idea was to make a some what light hearted western that evoked the serials of the 40's and 50's. Sadly, it doesn't come close because it takes itself way too seriously while also being filled with trite dialogue and poor pacing. i bought it because the price was super cheap, but the 90 minutes of my life I won't get back were worth more than the $5.",1481241600,,893,4.385542168674699

992472,4,6305214522,"I first saw this film years ago on TV. I remembered liking it back then, so I decided to give it another try recently. It still holds together pretty well. Sam Elliot does a good job. Tom Selleck also puts on a good performance. But Ben Johnson is the most comfortable in the role of a western. He pretty much steals the show once his character comes on the scene. And that's all well and good.

But the main appeal of this movie, is how it can be enjoyed by people who aren't avid western fans. Granted the film might feel a bit dated now. But it still manages to insert enough humor, drama and action to satisfy most. And that's saying a lot, considering this film came out in 1982.

The plot is decent. Two ex civil war brothers chasing down their kidnapped sisters and Sam Elliot's love interest...only to find out that the ladies are on their way to Mexico to be sold as slave labor. A side plot of bitter Confederate Soldiers, trying to rekindle the Civil War, sits in the background. And Elliot has a hard time expressing his true feelings. Put all that together and you get PG western, that can be watched by the whole family.

If you like westerns, with a light touch to them, you should enjoy this film. It still tells a decent story, to be worth your time.",1471737600,,1267,4.315126050420168

992558,5,6305214522,I think when you combine Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott it is automatically five stars. This movie is a classic western that is fantastic for people who love this genre. My father recommended it to me and I rented it the same day. It's full of chivalry and family loyalty. I love examples of how big brothers take care of little sisters. This is definitely two thumbs up for me.,1471046400,2,375,4.371428571428571

992685,2,6305214522,"I read L'Amour''s book and thought this might be a pretty good movie. But It was a real disappointment. They took a few details from what was a good read, rewrote it into a bad movie. Sticking pretty much to the book would have made a good movie but this isn't it. They also seemed ignorant of Texas geography. The brothers supposedly start in Big Spring and ride to the Gulf coast which is upwards of 600 miles, not just a few days ride on horseback. Then the train backtracks to Chihuahua which is again hundreds of miles. The book had none of this, L'Amour knew the state and kept the action and distances believable. If you've read the book or know Texas, avoid this film.",1465257600,,676,4.373015873015873

992982,5,6305214522,"I love Louis L'Amour, Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot.  Throw them together and you get a great movie.
Westerns, when written by the likes of Louis L'Amour, are a wonderful read.  I started reading his books when I was a little kid living with my grandparents in Oklahoma.  We were country people and our culture was so similar to what L'Amour described that it was easy for me to place myself in his stories.
The few that have been made in to movies don't disappoint (except one, but not for bad writing-just choice of actors).  This particular book (movie) is about the chaos that ensued when the Civil War ended.  Two brothers return home to Texas to find their sisters as well as one of the brothers' finance have been kidnapped for sale to Mexican slavers.  They promptly go in search of the girls to rescue them.
Louis L'Amour's heroes are somewhat predictable, but the stories are always good and add two of the best looking TV Cowboys (Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot) in and one is in for some great entertainment.  And (and this is important) no sex, cussing, and virtually no blood/guts.
Great movie even for kids.",1454112000,9,1115,4.57286432160804

993579,3,6305214522,"Okay, as much as I love Sam Elliott and Tom Selleck in westerns, I have to say, this movie was definitely somewhere between 3-4 stars.  It was more like a B movie, not on a par with many of their other western greats like El Dorado, Nevada Smith, True Grit, etc.  It is not well scripted or directed.  The concept of the brothers returning from the Civil War and finding the women in their town kidnapped by confederates who want to keep the war going by raising money by selling the women folk in Mexico, was a very different concept from many other westerns, but it just seemed choppy the way it went from one scene to the next, the story not developing well, as they pick up others who can help them to go to Mexico to rescue the women.  I'm glad I saw it, adding to my collection of western movies, but it is just not on a par with many of the more classic ones.",1421971200,,866,4.136904761904762

993654,4,6305214522,"1982's Television movie ""The Shadow Riders"" pairs Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot as brothers Mac and Dal Traven, returning to Texas at the end of the Civil War, only to find a band of renegade soldiers has kidnapped their brother and two sisters, and Dal's fiance.  The two brothers set out in pursuit, along the way springing from jail their wayward Uncle Jack (Ben Johnson) for assistance.  The trail leads all the way to a remote camp in Mexico and a face-off with former Confederate soldiers and Mexican bandits.

There is plenty of drama, but the delivery is often tongue in cheek. Selleck and Elliot are entirely believable, and fun, as brothers.  Katherine Ross is excellent as Kate, Dal's feisty once and future fiance.  Jeff Osterhage has a good role as the younger brother.  The plot, based on a Louis L'Amour novel, should hold everyone's interest, especially the action scenes aboard a train.  Recommended as good entertainment.",1420934400,8,936,4.923566878980892

Sam Elliot and Tom Selleck both are great actors and bring so much to the western as a genre. all of the supporting cast is likable but easily disposable, which is what brought this film down I believe. were it not for the 2 leads, it may have suffered more. The action starts the film off with a bang, as in any good western, and every time a moment comes for a character to be serious, it is following immediately with comedy, action, or both, leaving you glued to the screen the entire film.

The book was pure Western drama, while the film is tongue in cheek humor.

One of the best characters in the book is no where to be found in the move, that being Kate's uncle. He is incredibly interesting in the book, and is the reason the girls never are taken from the shore as they are in the movie.
Kate's character is strong in the movie, but much stronger and more plausible in the book. Lastly, Uncle Jack is made into a scalawag in the movie, while in the book is much more a true uncle.

Riding on together, they reach their family's ranch to learn that, only a few days earlier, a band of unsurrendered Rebels raided the place and kidnapped their younger brother Jesse (Jeffrey Osterhage) and sisters Cissy and Heather (Dominique Dunn, Natalie May)--along with visiting Kate Connery (Katharine Ross), whom Dal has been more or less expecting to marry ever since they were youngsters together.  Sheriff Miles Gillette (R. G. Armstrong) tells them that theirs wasn't the only place hit.  They set off at once to follow the fugitives and get their own back, and manage to rescue Kate and Jesse, but find that the girls have been taken on to Mexico by the Reb leader, Maj. Cooper Ashbury (Geoffrey Lewis), and the notorious gunrunner and Comanchero Holiday Hammond (Gene Evans).  Needing some specialized help, they break their uncle, Black Jack Traven (Ben Johnson), out of jail and resume their pursuit--with a posse from home panting up their horses' tails.

The acting by Selleck, Elliot, and the venerable Ben Johnson--was stilted and put on. At the end it struck me that I had been watching an extended version of Dukes of Hazzard, but without cars.

Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot are not expected to act in the movie, just be. Elliot is supposed to bowl over the women by his mere presence and phony, deeply-intoned half-hillbilly voice.  Selleck is like a walking Gentleman's Quarterly cover. This is one of those productions made to give certain actors a format to be seen rather than a format in which to labor to give the audience something of enduring value. The plot is credible but the execution of the story-line is for morons. For example, Selleck and Elliot sneaking up on alert sentries from behind; breaking Ben Johnson out of jail and the guards arriving just a moment too late to intervene. This is drivel for imbeciles.

994342,3,6305214522,"Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and Katherine Ross starred in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" in 1969.  They seemed to fit together, and there was chemistry.  You have to get a feel for that kind of dynamic cast working together, and if you really don't like one of those main characters, well let's just say it's stupid to buy that DVD.
""The Shadow Riders"" stars Tom Selleck, Sam Elliot, Katharine Ross, Dominique Dunne, Ben Johnson, Geoffrey Lewis, Jeff Osterhage, Gene Evans, R.G. Armstrong, Harry Carey Jr., Natalie May, and Jane Greer.  The story is basic, a lunatic Confederate Major & his gang of Confederate lunatic guerilla- style soldiers kidnap young women and young men to be sold in Mexico in exchange for rifles and ammunition (the Civil War is over; but not for them just yet).  The girls will be sold into prostitution; the men into the silver mines as slaves.  It's up to Tom Selleck, Sam Elliot and Ben Johnson to see their family members aren't included.  There's going to be some killin' by rifle and pistol, and more than likely some thievin' that might have to be done along the way.
Rumor has it that I need to watch ""The Sacketts"" that also stars Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott, to get a rounded out feel for whether or not I like those two in the same western.  At present, I feel like I watched two lead horses yoked together on the same single plow.  The trivia that applies here is that those two guys along with Jeff Osterhage starred in ""The Sacketts,"" then contacted Louis L'Amour and asked him to author another western they could all star in again (so he did).
The DVD movie being reviewed here (rated PG) was released in 1982, and filmed in Columbia State Historic Park, California; Santa Cruz, California; Sonora, California - all in the USA.  Without a doubt this film was intended for adolescent audiences, and unless you really love westerns you're not going to appreciate my noticing how many bullets the guns seem to have, how the good guys almost never miss and the bad guys always do no matter what.  Sort of like all the popular westerns made in the 1950's.
The western I wanted to see would have starred Tom Selleck, Sam Elliott, Clint Eastwood, Jack Palance, Charles Bronson, Slim Pickens, David Caradine, Danny Glover, Stacy Keach, Terrence Hill, Henry Fonda, and Lee Marvin - all part of a posse chasing down one man, who manages to kill them all and escape.  Who could do that?  Chuck Norris.  Oh well.  For now I guess I'll go see if I can find more westerns Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott were together in, which is about like casting John Wayne and James Stewart together (""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance;"" & ""The Shootist"").",1320278400,2,2674,4.6257928118393234

Despite being made for TV the production values are excellent and the casting first rate (any western with Elliott and Selleck is well cast). The plot is straightforward - our two heroes have to save their sisters and others from being sold to a brothel in Mexico by renegade Confederates. There are a few complications along the way: the Confederates are double crossed, the heroes have to spring their uncle out of jail, etc. Everything is resolved in a satisfying happy ending.

A lot of people don't like their films without the slightest trace of tragedy for the protagonists. I can watch them all day long. The film does lack depth but that's expected with just over an hour and a half running time. This one's worth it for the cast alone.",1244851200,2,930,4.497041420118343

994601,2,6305214522,"First off, I love westerns, whether on film or paper. Plus I'm a great fan of Louis L'Amour. So I was disappointed with this adaptation of one of his best stories. Although the basic plot starts off somewhat close to the book, by the middle of the movie it's strayed off so far as to not be recognizable. So hampered by that, I found The Shadow Riders to be lacking not only as a adaptation but as a western as well.

With a strong cast, inluding Tom Selleck, Sam Elliott, Katherine Ross, Ben Johnson, and R. G. Armstrong, to name a few, this could have been so much better. But being a ""Made for TV"" movie it was watered down from the start. Parts that should have been intense became almost tongue-in-cheek, the villians were almost comical in their characterizations, and the plot suffered because of it. At times it was almost like you were watching a comedy instead of what should have been a dark and intense film about a family trying to rescue their children before they're sold off into slavery in Mexico.

And that is where the problems lies. The film makers NEVER took the plot seriously and it shows in the acting, especially with Selleck. Watching him here all I can see is Magnum PI on a horse. When you see him in later westerns, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monte-Walsh/dp/B00009N1WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monte Walsh</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Stand-At-Saber-River/dp/B0007OY2OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Stand At Saber River</a>, or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quigley-Down-Under/dp/B00005LOL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quigley Down Under</a>&nbsp;you see performances that make you forget who is playing the role.

The Shadow Riders  is based on the book by that name by my favorite western author, Louis L'Amour and stars my two favorite western stars, Sam Elliott and Tom Selleck, how could you miss?  The movie is a hit with me.

Highly recommended for Louis L'Amour fans and western fans.

994608,2,6305214522,"This review is not regarding the actual film itself, but rather the poor quality of this DVD release.

The transfer used on this ""25th Anniversary Edition"" DVD is of VHS quality. The colors are extremely dull and washed out, and it's clear that the print did not come from a film source.

This is quite surprising considering the transfer used on the Trimark DVD released way back in 1998 did come from a good looking film print! That is still the version to get if you're seeking the best looking transfer available on DVD.

The 5.1 audio mix used is also quite generic. It has no extra depth over the original 2.0 mix, and even sounds ""tinny"" in a fake sort of way.

They've also shoved all of the bonus material onto a single-layer disc, and thus compression artifacts are often very noticeable.

The bonus features on the disc are interesting, but nothing to scream home about. And you can find all of these features on the previous ""Collector's Edition"" that this same DVD studio released in 2005.",1194134400,46,1002,4.606741573033708
994609,5,6305214522,"This movie was made in 1982 and based on Louis L'Amour's novel by the same name. It is now 25 years later and still excellent entertainment. This western is done much like those great ones we loved so much starring John Wayne. It has a good,fast moving storyline with a teriffic cast portraying strong characters. It is a straight forward saga ,stays focused and the viewer has only one thing to do---just sit back and enjoy it. Where this western is quite different is that it takes place at the very end of the Civil War when soldiers are returning home. This was a particularly difficult time because circumstances often set brother against brother,and relative against relative. You can't get more personal than this, where one brother wears the Gray and the other the Blue as they get together to make things right after others try to carry out revenge after the war.",1170892800,5,872,4.705882352941177
994610,2,6305214522,"Howdy,

After I read the book ""The Shadow Riders"" from Louis L'Amour I had to have this movie.

But what a disappointment!

Only about 30% of the movie content follows the book.

I will never understand how these movie makers destroy good stories.

I love watching western movies and I collect them (have abt. 100 now).

In this movie most of the characters act like they are having fun with

everything. Not once did I see the real concern about those kidnapped

people. The whole thing just looks to clean and like a Sunday picnic.

Why the hell did they have to bust out Happy Jack Traven (Black Jack) of

jail? Instead of adding dubios action scenes, they should have just stuck

with the book and we would be able to see a 5 star movie. Too bad!!!

I gave two stars, because I love Ben Johnson and Tom Selleck.
