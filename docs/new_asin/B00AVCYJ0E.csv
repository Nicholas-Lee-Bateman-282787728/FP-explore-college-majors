8558034,3,B00AVCYJ0E,"""Don Ricardo Returns"" is a B-picture, and a rather-poor swashbuckler at that.  Isabelita is fairly-bad and the fellow who plays the friar kind of stinks and Fred Coby is just okay.  In other words, the acting isn't going to win any awards.  Neither is the editing.  The direction is pretty poor too.  So what does ""Don Ricardo"" have going for it?  It has some fine fencing, a serviceable story, and humor.  Just the same, if you haven't the means or willingness to do some home-editing, I don't recommend ""Don Ricardo Returns"" unless you're a completest swashbuckler-collector.  As for me, I've put ""Don Ricardo"" through the Corel Video Studio Pro treatment, removing stupid bits, paring-down overlong scenes, and trimming the entire film by almost ten-minutes.  This effort has taken a D+ movie and made it a C+, and I've had lots of fun in the process!",1428710400,,854,4.834482758620689
