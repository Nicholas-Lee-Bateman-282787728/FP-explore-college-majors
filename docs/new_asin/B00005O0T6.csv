1638276,4,B00005O0T6,I thought the story was very good and loved the actors.  Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon when you are through with all your chores,1383350400,,136,4.230769230769231
1638277,1,B00005O0T6,"Movies like this are the reason I don't watch most movies written by whites that try their pathetic attempt at displaying the kinds of racist terrorism that American Indians and Africans living in America have to endure. White Americans should not write about these kinds of subjects unless they actually have the proper knowledge to write about them. Jesse's character was stereotypical! All he did was steal from people then he ends up going to jail. While his white friends try to teach him about morals that he lacks. And of course he's coveting the luxurious blondes which is suppose to be every brave and blacks mans dream ha ha ha!

RIGHT! Such a racist dumb stereotype!

This movie is soooooo racist. And European Americans have the nerve to talk to American Indians And Afro Americans about Us being reverse racist when they our still pumping out cinema racist trash like this movie.

And the director could have at least used a real American Indian because the guy that plays Jesse in the movie's real name is Douglas Spain and he is not Indian at all! He's Latin and looks Latin he does not look American Indian at all!

And in the end like every good ol boy racist Euro American movie that fakes and acts like they our on the side of the noble savage ends "" Of Course Jesse ""the good Indian"" Dies! "" Why does Jesse get killed you might ask???? Well the a white man kills him of course because Jesse ""the good Indian"" has eyes for his wife one of the blondes!

This movie is a racist stereotypical joke yet again! ; one of millions to add to the cesspool of Hollywood's pity the ethnic's flick's

FYI we don't need you're pity!",1373414400,,1638,4.498316498316498
1638278,5,B00005O0T6,"I thought ricochet river, was very good, it may start out slow but then it really picked up and turned out to be a great movie. Just give it a chance an you would say the same.",1342569600,,176,3.7837837837837838
1638279,1,B00005O0T6,"Film distributors are either incompetent idiots or lazy slobs, because they release a film in its original theatrical aspect ratio to cable TV, but they release the same movie only in the fullscreen (pan & scan) format on DVD?

WTF?

Thanks a lot, LionsGate.",1319155200,,258,4.840909090909091

1638281,1,B00005O0T6,The fine book by Robin Cody was turned into a pathetic cartoon by this poorly executed disaster.  It was simply a shame to behold.  Get the book and treasure it.  Burn the film.,1230422400,4,177,4.303030303030303
7948150,1,B00005O0T6,Started watching it on Prime. Was unable to finish it. Went back the next day to watch it and message stated it was no longer available for  viewing or purchase. Maybe I should be giving one star to Amazon instead.,1472774400,,214,4.35
7948151,4,B00005O0T6,"Good movie. Not an edge-of-your-seat movie, but definitely watchable. Actors were good and story was good.",1462492800,,106,5.6875
7948152,2,B00005O0T6,Bad language used too much in the film and was really not needed and spoiled the film.,1455753600,,86,4.117647058823529
7948153,1,B00005O0T6,movie for teen age girls.,1453161600,,25,4.2
7948154,4,B00005O0T6,"The movie was slow to start, but once it got going it was pretty good. It really portrayed the how Native Americans were treated in the 80s and 90s and some are still treated this way. It's a shame that Jessie died the way he did.  Some poeple are so filled with hate that they can't see past it. That is partly what got him killed. I hope people are not rating this movie poorly because they don't like movies like this. It was a decent movie about three teens discovering who they really are and what they want out of life.",1452729600,,525,4.147058823529412

7948159,4,B00005O0T6,A delightful story about young people trying to find their way in life.  The young Indian boy was very mixed up and came to a very sad ending.  I enjoyed it.  Kate,1428710400,,163,4.03125
