First you get Easy Eight's & Pershings in the Korean War, followed by stateside wargames involving halftracks, flame Shermans, M46's & M47's.  Then you watch the 2nd Armored Division deploy to Germany with it's Patton tanks & halftracks.  The show ends with the Army showing off it's state of the art new battle tank, the M48.

The video picture itself is dark, so hopefully you will have a TV which will have brightness controls that can compensate.",1204156800,,602,4.75
