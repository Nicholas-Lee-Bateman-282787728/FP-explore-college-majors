4641495,2,B005AU4QUA,"This instant video only contains half of what's on the DVD if you purchase it.  The DVD also includes the Hero Factory 2.0 episode ""Ordeal of Fire"".  My kids were very disappointed that this was not included.  The description does not indicate this and the cover looks exactly like the DVD.",1321401600,13,290,4.647058823529412
4641496,3,B005AU4QUA,"David Johnson, DVD Verdict --What is the LEGO Hero Factory? It's a top-secret construction facility, tasked with building super soldiers to police the galaxy. Yes, it may be slightly fascist, but who cares when the heroes look this awesome?!

Forty-five minutes of this for your child who might fancy himself too old and too cool for normal LEGOs. But if those LEGOs can be used to fashion crazy space warriors with huge claws and swords, GAME ON! That's clearly what's going on here, as LEGO Hero Factory: Savage Planet is quite obviously geared towards an older crowd. The subject matter is a bit edgier than ""Mr. LEGO guy goes for a ride in a fire truck"" and there's enough bombast and mild cartoonish violence to keep it in a demographic north of the first grade.

And I have to admit: They'll eat it up. Sure the plot is derivative and it's all very noisy and tumultuous, but what modern kids cartoon isn't? The most important thing is there's a ton of eye candy on the screen, the LEGO Heroes look cool, and the CGI animation is legitimately good (especially for a straight-to-DVD production). I count that as a win.

The DVD: 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen, 5.1 surround, and the bonus episode ""Ordeal of Fire.""

4641529,5,B005AU4QUA,"My son is very into legos, he has yet to master these smaller legos, but his older cousin play with them and so he is very interested and is able to play with them. He is even more interested because of this cartoon. I am not sure if there are more, but I hope so, as he has watched this one several times. I am a bit bummed out that the show sometimes pauses because of loading issues.

4641534,4,B005AU4QUA,My kids have been waiting to see this for a while now.  They both (boys 6 and 11)  say it was worth the wait!,1378771200,,109,3.5
4641535,4,B005AU4QUA,"I've never watched this series before( Hero Factory) but compared to other Lego shows I thought the colors were pretty muted. My eight year old son enjoyed it though and since he was the one who requested it, I can't complain.

4641539,5,B005AU4QUA,My 10 year old LEGO fanatic and avid builder loves all things Lego.  This video has inspired him to take apart and build all new characters of Hero guys and vilains!  He spends more time building and less time gaming.  He can't seem to get enough of it...Lego needs to create/produce more of videos of this kind.,1376524800,,312,4.43859649122807
4641540,3,B005AU4QUA,"To me, this is nothing more than a Transformer rip-off advertisement for Lego products.  Then again, I am not the target audience.  The target audience is my son who is three years old and loves this program.",1376006400,,208,4.594594594594595

It's always great when they have the legos to go with the shows.
We are waiting for another one to come out.",1374451200,,134,4.1923076923076925
4641545,1,B005AU4QUA,"We have been Lego fans for YEARS; yet we've held off on the Hero Factory line just b/c some of them looked creepy in the extreme.  However, when we found ""Hero Factory: Rise of the Rookies"" on Amazon Prime we watched it last weekend.  It was pretty fun (altho I'd say we prefer Clutch Powers and Ninjago from the Lego universe).  So we watched about 20 minutes of ""Savage Planet"" before turning it off.  There were darker elements, including a kind of witch-doctor-ish character, that kind of ruined the show for us.",1374364800,,516,4.576086956521739
4641546,4,B005AU4QUA,My 7 year old loved the show and has watched it several times. I would recommend it as a good show for young children who like legos.,1373760000,,133,3.962962962962963
4641547,4,B005AU4QUA,Good entertainment for the children. Need more of it available. It would be great to have more of it so that the children can be entertained much more. :0),1371945600,,155,4.379310344827586
4641548,5,B005AU4QUA,"Great movie, my son loves to play with LEGO all day long and every onze in a while he just wants to sit and relax and watch his friends come alive!!",1366761600,,148,3.806451612903226
4641549,5,B005AU4QUA,To show how much he liked this....he wanted two copies just in case he misplaced one.  That definitely says he likes it.,1365120000,,120,4.454545454545454
4641550,5,B005AU4QUA,"I got this at the library and was not expecting much at all but it turned out to be surprisingly good.
My kid loved it.
One of the reviews here said there was no bonus episode but the back cover shown here on Amazon shows in the red area that
it is.  The bonus episode is actually surprisingly long and good too.

So if your kids likes Lego Heroes it is worth them watching.",1363651200,,374,4.04054054054054
4641551,5,B005AU4QUA,Kids love it and watch it over and over again. Very good story and not something you have to worry about young ones watching,1363219200,2,124,4.208333333333333
4641552,5,B005AU4QUA,Hero Factory is a great movie! My kids have watched it over and over and so have their friends. Then they go to build Heros and start the battles to copy what the movie showed them. We wish Lego would release another movie. We only know of two and this is not enough! We want more Hero movies please!!,1331510400,,301,4.11864406779661
4641553,5,B005AU4QUA,"It does not include ''Ordeal of fire'' and not all characters will be from ''the rise of the rookies'', but else it was interesting to watch.",1329264000,,141,4.461538461538462
4641554,5,B005AU4QUA,My 6 yr old son loves the Lego Hero Factory toys. He can put them together mostly by himself by following the instructions/blueprints and they are actually durable enough to stay together while he plays with them which is something I definitely can't say about most of the other Lego toys.(I'm looking at you Star War Lego toys). We have both Lego Hero Factory DVD's and he loves to watch them and play with the toys at the same time...and then make up stories for them once the show is over. I highly recommend any of the Lego Hero Factory products...very creative and well made toys.,1325462400,3,585,4.528301886792453
4641555,4,B005AU4QUA,"As the title says...great DVD.
Wish it was on Bluray...but good enough.
Only strange thing is the main movie is the first selection, then the extra bonus movie is prior to the first on the timeline.
No big deal...just a heads up.
Enjoy.
ps: fantastic that the seller ships overseas. Finally, someone willing to make a global buck.
Cheers.",1325030400,,338,4.745762711864407
