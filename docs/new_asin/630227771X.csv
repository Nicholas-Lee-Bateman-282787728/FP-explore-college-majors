7823489,4,630227771X,"This is the movie that compliments the Unitarian Universalist RE class (around 3rd and 4th grade) 'Jesus and His Kingdom of Equals'.

I couldn't find it in DVD so it looks like VHS is the only way to get one.

The tape shows what the landscape and location of the area looked like where Jesus would have spent time. It talks about the people and traditions of the time.

It plays like you think a Readers Digest type documentary would play (slow, educational, mildly interesting). The really interesting thing is that our 3rd and 4th grade UUs just love this movie. They ask for it to be played.",1328832000,4,595,4.4907407407407405
