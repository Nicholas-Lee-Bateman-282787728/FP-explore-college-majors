7860854,5,6304087926,"This is one of my favorite shows and I am heartbroken that we cannot currently get seasons 4 and 5 in the US.  I own 1-3 now, so why won't the BBC release the rest of the shows on DVD?  Not enough profit?  Please, BBC, have a heart!",1223510400,,232,3.7916666666666665
7860855,5,6304087926,"Waiting for God is yet another example of the BBC and BBC-America dragging their feet on DVD releases! I can't for the life of me understand why they are producing them sooooo slooowly. This is a great show - especially the first few seasons. Very fresh - deeply dark and humorous - very well developed and presented by the writers and actors. You will laugh out loud and relish the wit and story lines. The BBC should get this series (including the pilot and specials) into a full boxed set for American viewers as soon as possible. [While you are it, could you please get the Tom Baker Dr. Who episodes out! At the rate you are releasing them, it will take you another 20 years to get them all on DVD!]",1123286400,7,704,4.340909090909091
7860856,5,6304087926,"What makes this series work is that you can care about the characters. They are all approachable. Their daffiness draws us into a world that  many of us are afraid to discuss: namely what's going to happen to me when it's my turn to move to a retirement home. Will there be a Harvey Baines making my life miserable for a few dollars? Tom and Dianna confront these issues with courage and dignity and manage to draw us into their virtual world where everything makes perfect sense and we can laugh with them. We don't objectify them and laugh at them. We share their trials and resolutions with them and enjoy the outcomes with them.

This is marvelous, restrained British humor at its very best. I can only say thank you to Stephanie and Graham, whereever they are.",1109203200,5,765,4.536231884057971
7860857,5,6304087926,"That's my comment and I'm stickin' to it.  :-)  As others have said, it is a very funny, witty, intelligently written show.",1103068800,6,123,4.545454545454546
7860858,5,6304087926,"Waiting For God is one of the funniest series ever made.  Diana Trent (played by Stephanie Cole) cannot abide being old and forced to live in a retirement home.  (Ironically, Cole was only 49 when the first of the series was filmed--the show ran in England for several years.)  Her rebellious antics with Tom Ballard as her main conspirator and foil and Harvey Bains, the ultimate smarmy person, as her main victim, are continuously hilarious.  If one has any appreciation of English humor, this one is sure to satisfy.  (It is much different from, but in my view even better than Absolutely Fabulous or Fawlty Towers--both of which I also adore.)  The series has run on PBS in Nor. Calif. (on two or three different stations) probably six months of each year since the time it was first released--so I imagine that there is a considerable pent-up demand for a release of the entire series.  I have managed to record many of the 50 odd programs on VHS, but not in order (and I also have the two VHS tapes which were released many years ago).  So I thirst for a complete collection on DVD.  I cannot tell from the Amazon listing on which I am writing this whether a DVD is coming out.  It lists it as VHS but it refers to DVD in its technical specification.  Perhaps it is an indication that maybe there will be a DVD release in the near future.

One viewer commented that the ""Bayview"" retirement home is supposed to be in Bournemouth (on the coast) but the credits refer to Oxfordshire.  The location (for exterior shots) is a real retirement home about 5 miles west of the city of Oxford (just north of Cumnor) and can be seen easily from the road and one can even drive up to it.",1101600000,7,1682,4.4397394136807815
7860859,5,6304087926,"Don't be put off by the title -  this is one of the best Britcoms to hit the US Shores. This show is totally unique - set in the British retirement community of Bayview, and it's inmates...er, residents are taking steps to NOT gracefully fade away!

I have never laughed aloud so much at a series as I have at the adventures of Stephanie Cole's Diana Trent (spinster & proud of it) and Graham Crowden's Tom (part-time bullfighter on the moon, when he wasn't digging out of Colditz with ""Dickie and Johnny""), and their battles against Daniel Hill's ""The Idiot Baines"" and Janine Duvitski's love-starved Jane.  Together with sex-fiend Basil and other inmates, and constantly thwarting the efforts of Tom's revolting family to control them, the antics are pricelss.
I have been hunting for all 47 episodes of the show, which form a total story, with a beginning (Tom's arrival), a middle (the Scandal!), and an end (call it two weddings and a funeral - not the one released).
FINALLY six episodes from the first series (season) were released on video; the premiere was not among them.  The two sets of episodes available are IT so far.  Grab 'em while you can - and let's see if we can get BBC to release the whole thing (including a second Christmas special episode never shown in the US) on DVD!
Once you visit Bayview, you'll want to go back, and six times won't be enough!",1088208000,14,1373,4.610655737704918
7860860,5,6304087926,"I watch the show Saturdays on my PBS station.  I contributed money during another one of their pledges, and gave me this volume as a thank you.  Set in Bournemouth, in Southern England, even though the credits say Oxfordshire.  Tom and Diana are the UK's answer to the Odd Couple.",981763200,4,280,4.56
7860861,5,6304087926,"Stephanie Cole is great fun as Diana Trent; here's a lady who speaks her mind and then some! The series benefits from well-written scripts, beautiful photography (and scenery) but above all, it is Diana Trent who keeps me watching. An amazingly refreshing natural actress, Cole has impeccable delivery and timing yet she never goes over the edge in her well-crafted performances. This hilarious show benefits immensely from the pairing of the two leads; it's obvious they adore each-other yet their livlihood comes from being crusty towards each-other (boy, can I relate to like relationships I have witnessed throughout my life!) I think Stephanie rather looks like a prettier middle-aged version of Daphne DuMaurier.",961977600,5,718,5.3628318584070795
