8183948,4,B000O785UQ,"Amazon needs to fix the Editorial Review - It's listing the remake of Ellen Barkin's ""Switch"", you know the one with Jennifer Aniston and Bateman.

Not big on review writing, but it bugs me when the wrong Synopsis is attached.

As for the TV movie, not the product or package because I'm not buying it it's better than average.

I like both of the the main characters and their actors. I am also a fan of open discussion of ""assisted"" or ""un-assisted"" suicide in general.",1417564800,2,471,4.517647058823529
