6413731,5,B00KBROZX0,"This movie features wonderful visual effects including an eel in a faucet, shoes that walk themselves, a piano that makes cocktails according to the notes played, bird DJs, and a see-through car. There's a birthday party for a dog and a woman who gets fed up with Sartre and burns all his books. My only gripe is that the trope of the dying woman (if you pardon my pun) has been done to death.

6413733,3,B00KBROZX0,Stylistic film kept me from really relating to the characters. I understand that the French book used literary idioms and twisted them to be literal so the film tried to project that as visual reality.

Anyone who has been around terminal illness, or had loved ones with depression, knows this invisible oppression that is insufferable at times. I think they did a lovely job of showing the darkness of a terminal illness.

6413747,2,B00KBROZX0,"TO ILLUSTRATE MY POINT, THIS IS AN ACTUAL SCENE FROM THE MOVIE-
*brings fishbowl into dressing room* *water casts fishy reflections all over*
Lead: (looking at bridesmaids getting dressed) You look lovely. You should bring the reflections with you.
Bridesmaid: Can we wear them?
Lead: Oh yes, they're coming, Colin convinced them.
*shot pans to mouse-sized man dressed in a mouse costume*
(to man in mouse costume): And you, go and see what the boys are doing instead of staring.
(to bridesmaids): We don't even know if it's a boy or girl.
*man in mouse costume climbs into mouse-sized car with tail hanging out and drives off on a track through the train compartment-shaped house  which sits defying gravity on an elevated train rail above the city*
*In another room, Groom is lying on a table with groomsman hammering his tie knot into place as if it were a nail*
*Groom's chef/houseboy is in a hole in the wall counting up a currency called ""doublezoons"" and putting it in a suitcase*
Groom: Make sure you bring the transparent ones.
SOOO... As you can see, nothing about this movie makes any sense- not the dialogue, which references the not-connected-to-actual-reality constant features present in every scene. Unless you are fluent in French, good luck reading said dialogue at the rapid-fire pace of the subtitles while following the illogical visuals and simultaneously putting the pieces of the word puzzle together. Things randomly sprout out of the walls, disappear into the ceiling and floor, the dining table runs off by itself on roller skates, and people's legs extend Gumby-style while dancing as if they are sitting in mid-air. Basically, this is two hours of trying to understand the world as seen by toddlers. Somewhere in there is supposedly a love plot involving two grown adults, but good luck deciphering it. As far as I can tell, the entire team of writers, producers, and directors were all on a giant acid trip when they made this movie.",1469836800,3,1963,4.912650602409639

6413750,4,B00KBROZX0,"This is definitely not your typical Hollywood romantic movie, so don't bother watching if you're looking for something along semi-traditional lines, otherwise you'll feel compelled to give a 1 star review. It is a romantic themed movie that has the always very easy to love Audrey Tautou. More an art house movie showcasing imagination, and stunningly creative visuals at every turn. Sure I didn't care for the eventually story arc, but appreciated the imagery and emotions involved in the journey, which will not be so easily be forgotten. In the end, I even watched the credits, not that I cared who was in them, but just to spend a few more minutes with the strangely quirky characters I grew attached to over the course of ninety minutes.",1469145600,2,742,4.850393700787402

6413756,3,B00KBROZX0,"It began as an engaging giggly romp, with lots of droll sly cultural and artistic references in the visual humor and props he used, which I quite enjoyed, actually, but then it rather ended up as though a mosquito bit Lars von Trier, then flew over to France and bit Michael Gondry, infecting him with some of his grim and depressing conceptions of romantic relelationships and what (he thinks) they do to people if they become ""overinvested"" (although I'd be the first to admit there are genuine problems with overinvested relationships, von Triers' relentless negativity is either truly nihilistic, cynically contrived or just burnt - I've never been able to decide which). Visually it came across a bit as though Gondry had dropped acid, followed that with repeated hits of nitrous, but then slid into a bad trip after losing the nitrous, while having a dream he was von Triers. I hope Gondry doesn't slide any further in this direction: that's a slippery slope that leads to a steep drop into nihilism - a philosophy only attractive to other nihilists - or masochists.",1463356800,,1072,4.863387978142076

6413762,5,B00KBROZX0,"Mood Indigo is a very lovely movie. When I started watching it, I found it very surreal, almost offensively so. The strange wordplay, the almost too-sweet love story in the beginning between Chloe (Tautou) and Colin (Duris), and the over-quirkiness seemed a bit stifling. It does, however, have a lot of imagery, a lot of allusion to disillusion, awkwardness, anxiety, and life in general. I personally found that the story takes a deeper turn when it took a darker turn nearing the end. SPOILER ALERT: With the impending death of Chloe, Colin's increasingly dire financial situation, the ""death"" of his wonderful house, the departing of Nicolas, Analise' murder of Partre and Chick, the film poignantly demonstrates that the same things that make life worth living can also be our downfall and our doom.

I appreciate and enjoy the beauty of this movie the change that takes place in the environment to mimic that of the characters is really amazing.  If you did enjoy this movie watch ""Love me if you dare"" also know as ""Jeux d'enfants"" it is also incredibly unique and beautiful.  Love stories should be fantastic things to watch.

6413789,5,B00KBROZX0,"It's clear from the reviews that this movie doesn't appeal to everyone. There were moments in the film when the surrealism seemed to be nothing more than a gimmick. There were moments when it seemed that the film was trying to imitate Amelie. Overall, though, I think that the movie benefits from the surrealism --- the story might have been less interesting without it. Certainly, it adds an element of unpredictability.
I might have given the film 4 stars, had it not been for Audrey Tautou. It is impossible for me to be objective about her. My favorite movie star.
The subtitles are terrible. They are white, and frequently displayed on a white background, Often, you are only able to see the top half of the letters. It's hard to imagine that someone in production decided to release the movie this way. The film should be presented in widescreen
format, with the subtitles below on the black.
My purchase included an extended edition of the movie. I watched it last night and began to read the book, and I appreciate the movie more, now. I'm more convinced that the movie is worthy of the five stars. I think that my mind was better prepared for the unusual presentation,
and, thus, more open to the story. Maybe love is a little surreal. I have seen a few of these actors in other movies with Audrey Tautou,
and I enjoyed their performances here. My criticism of the subtitles still stands, but I will add that the soundtrack is really nice, and adds
a lot to the movie.",1439769600,,1477,4.577358490566038

6413801,2,B00KBROZX0,"Michel Gondry has directed one of my Top Three favorite films of all time; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Im starting to feel like Gondry is a one-hit wonder.  I haven't seen The Science of Sleep, although the reviews left me cold and I never felt drawn to it.  I did see Be Kind Rewind, which wasinteresting.  It was fun, but it also felt forgettable.  The Green Hornet had some sharp moments, but overall it was a thankless film.  I never even knew The We and the I was made, so I guess Ill need to check that one out (or will I?), and then we have Mood Indigo, a film that didn't get very good reviews but managed to snag my attention with the visual look of the film.

So I was excited to see Gondry excite me again.

He didnt.

While Mood Indigo is a stunning visual treat (albeit purposefully tacky in some spots), the film itself is the wrong kind of whimsy and winds up being a completely forgettable (and somewhat draining) experience.  It took a near forty minutes for me to even begin to care about this film.  The first twenty minutes or so was so intendedly bizarre and pointless that I found myself literally checking out.  I didn't care.  It was quirky without purpose and so, in the end, was just silly.

The prose is one that I actually found endearing.  I love adult fairytales and I love bizarre, and Gondry had such success with a whimsical adult fairytale before (like, that really is what Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is) and so I thought the idea of a woman with a flower growing in her lungs and the desperate attempt by her lover to find a cure sounded sofresh and exciting.  Visually, the film is.  The sets, the cinematography, the colors and lighting and the musical accompaniments are so excitingbut the movie itself is just a chore.

Romain Duris is pretty awful here, Audrey Tautou (who I loved that one timeyou know the time) was just kind of there (shes so pretty, but you have to give me more than that) and Omar Sy is just kind of hard to watch (awkward), but really, I blame Gondry for doing everything wrong with this premise.  The screenplay is just plain bad.

And this is where Im seeing a trend in Gondrys missteps.  His Oscar winning masterpiece was written by the brilliant Charlie Kaufman (Gondry had story ideas, but Kaufman penned the screenplay).  Gondry penned The Science of Sleep, Be Kind Rewind, The We and the I and he adapted Mood Indigo.  Maybe Gondrys problem is that he has great ideas and no idea how to craft them in a clever and profound way.  His films apart from Kaufman lack a feeling of depth of importance.  They lack real substance.  They are just there, and when they're not there, they're gone.

They don't linger.",1435795200,,2699,4.455102040816326

Starring Audrey tatou and Romain duris. This is love story that will twist the realms of reality and science fiction.  Based on the famous novel by boris. Vlan. This film from michel. Gordy is a instant cult classic. Audrey tatou is radiant and beautiful and on top with her great acting skills in this well done love story. And she is paired up with Romain. Duris.

Anyone who is tired of CGI and loves the old practical special effects of the 1970's and 80's will consider this essential viewing.  Imagine ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"" mixed with ""Beetlejuice.""  However, the last half loses much of the warmth, fun, and adventure it started out with.  Why are the French so obsessed with disease, dysfunction, death, clutter, chaos, and generally grimy unclean looking environments?  Is this an allegory for the slow descent of romantic relationships in general?  Perhaps I should have thought less about it's ""messages"" and just enjoyed the wildly original images at surface value.  But I can't help but feel a stronger story would have elevated their significance.  Definitely watch ""The Science of Sleep"" first to decide if this style is your cup of tea.",1429488000,,858,5.122302158273381

The wonderful novel on which it is based encompasses science fiction, jazz, romance, and tragedy, so get ready for a wild ride that refuses any single-genre categorization.

Spoiler alert: I give away the ending a bit if you read all the way through...

I thought it was a little silly, or loosely strung together, after about 20 minutes. Perhaps a lot of Gondry-tricks with not much plot to hold them together. Then I kept watching. Who doesn't love staring at these actors, after all? Sometime around 50 minutes I fell inside and it all became lyrical. I found it touched each string of the fears in my cello heart and left them all vibrating within me.  Gondry the puer aeternus illustrating existential angsts and anxieties. Thanatos is present in a way that reminded me of Synecdoche, New York.  More expectedly, how many times I wanted to pause the scene, relish the props/metaphor/details/allusions/lines/soundtrack. Gondry himself has a cool part as a doctor. At the (spoiler) funeral I thought for a second it might be a trite scene with grief stricken earth-clutching pathos. It was not. And yet I wept freely not moments later, like no movie has made me weep in ages. Funny that at first I thought the movie was too pedantic. I haven't read the novel by Vian. But perhaps Gondry (who is, after all, French) is the perfect artist to realize all the contrasts of whimsical fantasy, pure child-like love, witty satire, and cold heartbreaking loss.",1425513600,17,1676,4.829268292682927
6413917,5,B00KBROZX0,"I enjoyed it. Yes it's surrealist and kind of nutty, but It invokes a lot of emotion. Love Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou, so glad to see them together, but then add the fact that this is based on a Boris Vian novel (And imagination!).... so exciting! Add in the director here, and ya. It was undoubtedly going to be a crazy psychedelic dreamy film, but also, it's really interesting. The whimsical beginning and then the tragic distopia type of end really helped with the emotional ambiance. I liked it. Would love to see more Vian adaptations (M ZGodry does an awesome job and fits Vian's style as well), and of course who doesn't love Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou together...

In fact, I watched it specifically because I had read Boris Vian's L'Ecume des Jours while an exchange student in France. As some folks study Heart of Darkness for an entire semester, such was my plight with this book. It was, without a doubt, the hardest thing that I ever read in my studies - and that includes some pretty wicked material in grad school. The entire book is written in double-speak, and the euphemisms are pretty heavy. If you are enchanted by the actors, and who wouldn't be, I'd say go ahead, but bring the tissues. The beginning of the film is a little kooky, but fun. As the film progresses, I definitely think you lose some context. I would strongly suggest a quick Googling of L'Ecume des Jours. For one thing, you'll appreciate the movie a little better. For another, you can pretend to be all 60's French arty - grab a hunk of cheese and some wine, and get to it!",1425254400,2,1060,4.554973821989528

6413957,5,B00KBROZX0,"This is a marvelous film, something completely out of the ordinary and unique, as opposed to much of what passes for ""film"" any more - formulaic pieces that follow a predictable arc, are designed to please everyone, yet remain unsatisfying because of their ordinariness. Knowing a bit about surrealism and existentialism, as well as speaking a bit of French, would give a viewer some context with which to better appreciate Gondry's work. Knowing that the French title, ""L'Ecume des Jours"" translates as ""The Foam (or Froth) of Days"" might also help you understand this movie better. Like a cloud on a sunny day, it can be whimsical - is it a bird, an elephant, a giraffe? - and like a cloud on a rainy day, it can dampen even the brightest of spirits. Some clues to help you appreciate elements of the film: Jean Sol Partre is, of course, a reference to Jean-Paul Sartre (a friend and contemporary of the author Boris Vian, upon whose work the film is based); the bird-headed creatures are a reference to Magritte, one of the more popular surrealist artists; and the cloud that they ride in is a reference to the title (because clouds are nothing if not ""foamy"" or ""frothy""). Some reviewers have noted that the movie starts out happy - whimsical is a good word - and then becomes dark; I didn't see any reviews that noted that the colors at the beginning are so vivid that they are almost overwhelming but, by the end of the movie, everything has been ""reduced"" to black and white. This is an important aspect of Gondry's work, as are the ""vines"" that eventually obstruct the windows in Colin's ""apartment."" This is Gondry's way of conveying the idea of entropy - that everything decays over time, even for the wealthy (Colin is rich at the beginning of the film, but so poor at the end that the Catholic priest he visits to arrange a funeral can't give Chloe a ""proper"" burial) and even when two people are in love.

This is a French film, not an American film, and without some of this background it's hard to understand what it is that Gondry is trying to accomplish. There is satire, there are puns (which aren't translated, unfortunately), and the film blends the existentialism of Sartre with the surrealism of Dali and Bunuel. It is easy to see how someone coming to this film without an understanding and appreciation for these elements would be confused and disappointed, especially if they watched the truncated 94-minute version instead of the full film. But, all of that notwithstanding, Gondry has created a visually stunning epic that is as compelling as it is unusual. And, in the twenty-first century, when studios are more concerned about ticket sales than ""art,"" that's quite an accomplishment.",1423353600,17,2713,4.747881355932203

I was disappointed, however, that they left out the last scene in the book with the mouse, and I think they could have done a better job showing the gory nature of the world they lived in while they were falling in love. That said, I think this is a quirky love story, and if you give in to the scenery and suspend reality, you get a feel for the dreamlike world of Mood Indigo - both whimsical and dark.

I was hoping for an ending which brought it all together, rewarding my willingness to endure the second half. There was an attempt at something along this line, but, for me, the final execution (of the drawings) was so abrupt and disconnected from the characters that I regretted not shutting off the video and cutting my losses forty minutes earlier. (It might not have been that long, but it seemed like hours).

If you like a movie with depth, this is a fantastic viewing experience. If you like good visuals to go with a good story, you will love this movie.

Then watch it again (after taking some time to process it). In true theater-of-the-absurd style, the surrealism is a vehicle that explains so much about what makes up the spectrum of human experience.
