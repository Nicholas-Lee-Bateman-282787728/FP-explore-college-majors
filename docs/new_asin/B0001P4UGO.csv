8073798,5,B0001P4UGO,"This VHS tape contains two AATC episodes: The Chipmunk Story which tells how the three talking baby chipmunks and Dave became a family and The Chipmunk Reunion which is about the chipmunks search for their birth mother. Both episodes are adorable and must-sees for any AATC fan. The Chipmunk Story is only available on VHS, so I'm happy that I still have a VCR player.",1408406400,2,368,4.676923076923077
8073799,2,B0001P4UGO,"I am a bit of a fan of the chipmunks and I was glad that I could see episodes that where not on DVD yet. Sadly the video quality was poor on the video I got, my guess is because how old the video is. The good news is that I think one of the episodes is now on DVD and the other one will come out the end of this month. I would not recommend this purchase, just wait for the DVDs.",1268265600,,379,3.5783132530120483
