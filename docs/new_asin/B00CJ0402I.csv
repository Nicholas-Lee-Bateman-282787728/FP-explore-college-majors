5723095,5,B00CJ0402I,"This was one of my favorite shows, even though I was twenty-something when it first aired.  One of my favorite aspects of this show is how we get to travel around the world with Eliza and her family, experiencing different cultures, customs and sometimes languages.  I think I'd have loved this show even without the fascinating 'talking to animals' thing.

This is a great series for getting people interested in other parts of our world.  I also deeply appreciate the way it makes you care about animals/the environment, not in a preachy sort of way, but YOU care because ELIZA and her family care, to the point of being willing to risk their lives.

There is also an awesome movie you absolutely cannot miss out on-it's a whole lot less expensive than the series, and is a good starting point if you want to try a bit of the series before jumping in the water.  You won't be sorry!",1306800000,,884,4.528301886792453

5723097,5,B00CJ0402I,Thank you for bringing seasons 2 and 3 back! :D It looks like you decided to put them on single volume season dvds instead of 3 volumes. Just wanted to say thanks. Now i can finish my collection of the Wild Thornberrys! Now all you need to do is bring Hey Arnold season 3 back ;),1296777600,,279,4.0
5723098,5,B00CJ0402I,"I have been buying each season of the wild thornberrys each week, but when I reached season 3, Amazon had it ""currently unavailable & they don't know when it or if it will be available!"". Now, what the ""darnation"" does this mean? Does it mean that season3 have already been sold out? Not to mention that season 3 comes in 3 dvd sets costing $40.00 each! Can someone please answer this question? I would want my wild thornberry dvd collection to be complete & not have to go on ebay & see it for $60.00 each. Amazon, we have a problem so please bring that season back for purchase! Thank you.",1295568000,2,591,4.333333333333333
