My idea of a ""perfect relationship"" was partly based on what I would watch in movies or TV shows.  Little did I know those ""perfect relationships"" were made for movies or TV shows -- only.  With this workshop, I've learned it's so much deeper than saying the perfect line or whatever crap it is that I watched, and that it starts with none other than working on myself.

After watching these DVDs, I knew I had to attend the actual workshop.  The DVDs are great, but sharing my own stories/experiences with other people and learning about their stories and struggles in a safe environment is where the gears start churning.  Check out their website and attend the workshop, if you want to take your relationships to the next level: [...]",1385856000,2,914,4.576687116564417

This DVD covers a wide array of subjects within the dating world, but can also apply to plutonic relationship. I've NEVER come across such a wonderful, thoroughly laid out plan for how to have a wonderful relationship with friends, but also laying the ground work for a marriage I would love to have someday. The principles laid out are not ones that are taught in the world. It gave me an enhanced view of the world around me, but also of myself. The lessons are truly an inspiration, revealing that having a great marriage is attainable.",1385856000,3,640,4.432203389830509
