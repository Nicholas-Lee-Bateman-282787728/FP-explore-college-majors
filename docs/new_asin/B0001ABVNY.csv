8009170,5,B0001ABVNY,"I was at this concert.  Men at Work played the Greek Theater, which is on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley October 7 & 8, 1983.  In the video, right at the beginning of the song the Longest Night, Collin Hay says ""Thank you very much San Francisco."" It was part of Men At Work's Cargo tour.  I was at the concert on the 8th.  I also remember, probably a year later, HBO showed the concert.  Since then, I've been looking for the concert.  Great to see it out now.  Hopefully it will be on DVD soon.  I give it 5 starts because it took me back to when I was actually at the concert.",1446336000,,601,4.076923076923077
8009171,5,B0001ABVNY,"This is a really great find on Amazon...the concert has many of Men at Work's hits and some of their better album tracks...done to perfection by the original lineup before 1985's Two Hearts cd...which saw Men at Work start to break up.  Gladly, Colin Hay pursued a solo career that has lasted for years...too bad Greg Ham didn't do the same, as he was a top notch songwriter and singer also.  Get a copy and put it on dvd!",1414368000,,422,4.329113924050633
8009172,5,B0001ABVNY,"This is a very good concert. If your a ""Men at work"" fan, this is the one to get. To bad it does not seem to come on dvd, in any case you will be happier to get this one on vhs over the ""Men at work, live in San Bernadino"" on dvd anytime. The sound and video was also very good, at least on the not worn out used copy I bought.",1331596800,,327,3.493150684931507
8009173,5,B0001ABVNY,"I had been looking out for more on this great group for years until I found this VHS. While the format is obsolete, I still had the means to digitalize it to DVD. The stereo sound on this concert is great, and to finally watch a concert from one of my favorite rock groups is a great experience for me. Too bad I couln'd do much about the image or color but considering the years that have passed by it, the recording on the VHS tape was extremely acceptable. I would reccomend any fan to buy this tape and digitalize it, you won't be dissappointed. In this unique set they perform all their hits plus songs like ""Make it through the night"" which you can rarely hear in compilations the way it was played at concerts. Don't expect extras or special setups though. Finally, I wish CBS FOX or whomever has the rights to release it on DVD ( We waited more than 20 years for Styx's ""Caught in the Act"" concert"").",1265414400,,908,4.284883720930233
8009174,5,B0001ABVNY,"There's no words to describe this live performance. Certainty, it's one of the best shows of The Eighties taking into account the group with its original formation playing its greatest songs in the moment they were considered the best new artist of the world.",1127779200,,259,4.909090909090909
