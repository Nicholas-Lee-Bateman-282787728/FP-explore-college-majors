4253777,1,B0043988N0,"After watching a few episodes of this I have come to the conclusion that this was made with little detail to the actual story line presented in the game. All of the characters back stories are changed and dulled down. The English dub is pretty bad, they mispronounce half of the names. The actual story of the anime is so far different form the games that if you changed the characters names its would be a different show. Overall the only thing good about this was the animation Production IG is a great animation studio, however this feels like a cheap cash in or a badly thought out marketing campaign to hype the game.

So, if you are a fan of the game don't watch this, you will be disappointed. If you have never played the game I suggest putting on the Japanese dub and watching it because Funamation dubs are very hit or miss and this is a miss.",1311811200,6,853,4.33125
4253778,3,B0043988N0,"Animation and characters are geared to little kids but plot motivation is founded on viewer understanding why she seeks to end the world.  Until you have lost someone near and dear you want really understand the motivation, if you have then the animation is geared to a younger crowd...  A bit like your computer manual coming in crayon as another parallel.

Reminds me a lot of when I went to see Marlie and Me with some relatives.  The kids did not really have and emotional base to tie the movie to so they thought the ending was corny.  Those of us old enough to have put down the family pet once or twice put it on the short list of acceptable movies for a guy to shed a tear in.",1309305600,,684,4.230769230769231
4253779,4,B0043988N0,"In a world where the beastmen is king and humans are second rate, Morte is a teenage girl in possession of the Destruct Code, an orb with the power to destroy the world. Therefore, she has been dubbed the ""World Destruction Committee"" and is now on the run from the ""World Salvation Committee"". She unintentionally picks up some more committee members in Kyrie, a good natured guy who seems pretty useless, and Taupy, a but-kicking bounty-hunter bear. The committee complete, they set out to destroy the world! With a noted lack of enthusiasm from Kyrie and Taupy.....

I found myself liking this series much more than I had expected. I knew it was based on a video game, which I have yet to decide is a good or bad thing. But it was cheap and only 13 episodes and ANN gave it a decent review, so I figured it would be worth it to give it a try. To my surprise, not only was it a fun journey of randomness and general pointlessness, but the ending was satisfyingly done. I liked Kyrie and Taupy, and Morte was only slightly unbearable (Her desire to destroy the world is annoying and illogical, but essentially unimportant). The sand world was interesting and creative. The plot is episodic until the last two or three. The short stories aren't very interesting, but the overall plot was fun.

This show has some holes in it. It has holes and illogical things and you need to suspend disbelief while watching it. But it is short and sweet and a little yellow teddy bear beats up bad guys. You should watch it!",1308528000,3,1509,4.5036496350364965

4253782,5,B0043988N0,"This show plays out like a classic movie title and like One Piece of Inu Yasha. The reason it's better than those two shows i because it's more dynamic. The fantasy side is more fantasy and the action is better action, and the characters are more unique. Some people might be turned off by the cartoony-sts of the animal characters but it's not much worst than a Final Fantasy/Kingdom Hearts video game. Also the story line is a simple and the story is a complex but not confusing. The story line is more similar to One Piece in that it is almost linear. And the characters remind me of Inu Yasha chracters but darker.",1267920000,,618,4.4298245614035086
4253783,3,B0043988N0,"Sands of Destruction is based off the recent Nintendo DS game by the same name. Having played the game first I found myself really enjoying the series because of seeing some charming characters from the game in full animated glory.

The plot follows Morte, Kyrie, and Taupy (best Teddy bear ever!) as they travel their world in search of a way to destroy the world all while being chased by the ""World Salvation Committee"" (with smooth Naja and sexy psycho Lia being the members.)

The story is simple and similar to one you'd find in a 90s anime but what makes the show work are the excellent characters who are very lively and fun.

The art/animation/soundtrack while nothing spectacular are pretty well done and the English language track is great.

Worth owning if you enjoyed the game and worth renting if you haven't. Either way you'll at least be entertained for a few hours.",1266969600,,882,4.707792207792208
4253784,3,B0043988N0,"In the Summer of 2008, ""Sands of Destruction"" (aka ""World Destruction ~Michibikareshi Ishi~"") was a TV series shown on television in Japan.  The 13-episode series and manga series was created to coincide and promote the Nintendo DS Role-playing game video game developed by Imageepoch, Inc. and released by Sega.

The series was directed by Shunsuke Tada (""Prince of Tennis"", ""Hatsumei Boy Kanipan"") and a screenplay by Masahiro Yokotani (""Sgt. Frog"", ""Himawari!"", Nodame Cantabile"").  Character designs are by Keita Matsumoto (""Bungaku Shoujo"") and music by Yoshihiro Ike (""SD Gundam Force"", ""Kamichu!"", ""Ergo Proxy"", ""Blood: The Last Vampire"").  Anime production is by Production I.G. (""Blood"", ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Eyeshield 21', ""Sorcerer Hunters"") and backgrounds by Studio Biho (""Magical Girl Pretty Sammy"", ""Patlabor WXIII"", ""Street Fighter Alpha"").

""Sands of Destruction"" is an anime series that takes place in a world where the seas are all sand and the world is dominated by beasts (aka Ferals).  Humans and human-like animals are the primary beings on the planet with the humans being the life that are seen as lower and are oppressed.  With death and destruction for humans, a female warrior named Morte Ashera carries with her a large blade weapon and also a self-destruct device.  Her goal, to find the activation code and destroy the world.

She is accompanied by Kyrie Illunis, a guy who has been pretending to live amongst the animals with fake ears and is a fairly weak individual.  With Kyrie outed as a human, he decides to go along with Morte in hopes to dissuade her from destroying the world.  Also, joining the two is Toppy, a small one-eyed bear who is a true warrior.  And because the two have accompanied Morte, they are dubbed the World Destruction Committee.

Hoping to stop them before they get the activation code are the World Salvation Committee consisting of Naja Gref (half human and half wolf feral) and Lia Dragunel, a female dragon feral and the last of her surviving race (who suddenly takes a liking towards Kyrie).

With each village the World Annihilation Front visits, the more that people want them for reward money.  But can these three be stopped?  Or will Kyrie and Toppy find a way to dissuade Morte from destroying the world.

""Sands of Destruction - The Complete Series"" features a total of 13 episodes on two DVD's.
VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Sands of Destruction - The Complete Series"" is presented in 16:9.  The series doesn't feature complex animation but for the most part, the animation works as a series targeted towards a younger demographic.  Artistic backgrounds are nicely done and shading for the characters are done well.

Audio is presented in English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and Japanese Stereo.  The voice acting are done well for both the English and Japanese audio tracks.  The acting is done well but I have to admit that hearing Toppy continually saying ""kuma"" (which means ""bear"" in Japanese) gets a bit too overdone at times.  But overall, voice acting is done well for both soundtracks.  As for the audio, the series does have a share of action scenes but I found the soundtrack to be primarily center and front channel-driven.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

My first introduction to ""Sands of Destruction - The Complete Series"" was from the band AAA (who sings the opening theme song ""ZER"") and I felt that the anime and video game tie-in looked pretty to cool at the time and wondered if both would ever receive a US release.

Fortunately, Sega is releasing the game in the US on Nintendo DS and the anime series is now here courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

The series is primarily targeted towards a younger demographic.  In fact, the video game was intended to be much darker as humans were food for the Feral's but was changed by the creators realizing that the rating system may be too restrictive and thus decided to make the storyline appeal to a more broader demographic, including your players.  And thus the anime series reflects that.

Despite the big blade that the main character Morte carries, the act of violence is never shown.  We usually get cut scenes where it shows the battle but then cuts to another character trying to escape or change the tide of battle to their side and then a cut back where we see the opponent typically knocked out.  So, for the most part, the series is quite safe.  Because of the dialogue, it's not exactly for children as they probably will not understand the reasoning of why Morte wants to destroy the world and probably may find more appeal to her anger issues, Poppy the bear's cuteness/fighting abilities and the humor in Kyrie's cowardice.

In a way, the anime series is like ""Slayers"" Lite.  No magical destruction or anything like that but the concept of warriors going village to village.  While these travelers are not searching for a way to be paid, they are going around in order to find the destruction device.

As for the DVD, it was cool to see find out that there is about a 25-minute's worth of special features included.  Voice acting on both Japanese and English soundtracks are well-done for this television series.  For the most part, I'm quite happy to know that the creators didn't drag this series  on for 26-episodes because most of the episodes are stand-alone.  With the exception of the first episode and possibly episodes where the World Destruction Committee confronts the World Salvation Committee and get into a battle with each other, it's the final four episodes where the more dramatic moments starts to emerge.

Overall, ""Sands of Destruction - The Complete Series"" is an average adventure-based anime series.  The series has quite a bit of adventure and humor elements but if you're looking for a series that is fun, but nothing too serious and lighthearted and a Japanese RPG lover who intends to pickup the ""Sands of Destruction"" Nintendo DS video game, then this anime series is definitely for you!",1265328000,,6853,4.915505226480836
4253785,5,B0043988N0,"Well, I suppose the age-old lesson of never judging a book based on its cover applies to anime as well.  In this case, my advice would be not to judge the show based on its cover, previews, or video game incarnations.  Well, I take that back, maybe you can judge it however you choose, so long as what you're basing the comparison on is incredible as well.  To clear the air, I've never played the Sega role-playing game for the Nintendo DS on which this series is based, nor am I partial to anime shows with one of their lead characters looking adorable enough to make Pikachu green with envy and yet here we are.  I can honestly state that this is one of the finer series I've had the pleasure of enjoying in a long time!

Released across two discs, Sands of Destruction comes packaged as a pair of thin packs within an outer cardboard slipcase and consists of episodes 1-13. The show comes in at a total runtime of 325 minutes and wears an appropriate if slightly conservative TV 14 rating due to a bit of animated violence.

Language options are standard sub & dub with both an English dub and original Japanese soundtrack (either in Dolby 5.1 Digital Surround) & the choice of English subtitled if so inclined to turn them on.

Extras include English subtitled character interviews (Japanese cast), textless opening and closing songs, and a host of fresh Funimation trailers on the second disc.

The anime adaptation of the 2008 game was produced by Production I.G and began airing on July 8, 2008 in Japan.  FUNimation wasted no time in securing the rights and releasing a solid dub to the North American market.

The story is set in a fantasy world, which consists mostly of vast expanses of sand.  Rather like humanity's development of vessels capable of conquering our liquid oceans, so too have the inhabitants of this sand world built ships, subs and liners to traverse the seas of sand.

The viewer follows along with a cowardly young man named Kyrie and his unlikely companion Morte; a young fairly depressed woman who was labeled by the fanatical World Salvation Committee as a member of the taboo ""World Destruction Committee.""  While not denying the fact that she wishes the world (including her own tattered existence) would in fact come to an end, Morte is targeted mainly because she is believed to have possession of the Destruct Code; a small black orb doomsday device.

In her travels she ends up teaming up with the fellow human Kyrie and a small bounty hunter/ living yellow teddy bear (complete with pirate-inspired bandanna and eye patch) named Taupy.

Pursued endlessly from port town to port town, the small band of humans is forced to don disguises to appear as human/ beastman hybrids.  See it turns out that in this world human beings are the oppressed minority to the beastmen: large animal-based sentient beings who possess unsurpassed intelligence, strength, and cunning.

On the surface, viewers can expect clean, crisp visuals and a thoroughly enjoyable adventure romp and for many fans, this will suffice.  However, dig a little deeper and one begins to unravel layers of symbolism integrated into the prose.  There are themes of racism, segregation, tyranny, the power of positive thinking, even the debate of sentience in robotics integrated here.

In essence, the show is capable of appealing to a very wide range of viewers.  The superficial contains all the correct elements of visual appeal, fantastic vocal work, cute characters, and a unique world to keep the masses solidly entertained.  Take a look beyond the surface and there's a fantastic political/ social commentary lurking.  It's rare to encounter a series that presents humanity as the minority in a beast-ruled world.  Rarer still to accurately depict how stereotypes lead to racism, fear and misunderstanding.  In one particular segment, the humans find themselves in a primarily beastman run town and the beastmen themselves are clearly filled with terror of the humans due to what they had always been told rather than judging based on the obvious bond, the common goals shared, or the fact that the humans had a beastman cohort in their company.  It's subtle, but quite brilliantly done.

Another great story arc centers on a beastman scientist, dressed in Revolutionary War garb, who cannot come to terms with why, despite 108 unique laws to guide them, his own loyal robots can be made to serve his enemies.  Again, it's the small things here that really have impact.

The dub work is very, very strong.  FUNimation just continues to raise the bar with their efforts.  There was a time when I wouldn't even think of recommending anything other than listening in the original Japanese dialog on this type of show, and yet here I may go as far as to say the dub is the superior of the two options on account of the stellar delivery.

In all, I have to admit that I went into this series with very low expectations.  Being quite unfamiliar with the video game and less than enthusiastic after catching some trailers, it goes without saying that I came away from Sands of Destruction very pleasantly surprised.  The 13-episode length is just the proverbial icing on the cake as the show manages to weave its tale without ever becoming too bogged down in the middle (a very common trait in anime of all genres).

I definitely recommend this show to anime fans of just about any genre, as there's something here that will surely appeal to nearly everyone.",1264291200,52,5460,4.815648445873526

4253838,2,B0043988N0,"I've been cruising through the S.A.V.E. animes looking for cheap gems and titles that shouldn't be there because they've been overlooked by the U.S. crowds.  ""Sands of Destruction"" has found an appropriate home on S.A.V.E.  I've never played the video game so I can't comment on its worth to players of said game, but I can comment on its worth as a standalone anime.

Sands of Destruction starts off with a unique storyline, interesting world, and solid animation.  The world they live in is primarily ruled by beastmen, and humans play the role of the disenfranchised minority.  The main character has a mission to destroy the world and carries a black sphere with the power to do it.  She just doesn't know how it works.  A plucky, confused cook joins her and a rough and tumble pirate bear makes it a trio.

After three episodes the show plummets into mediocrity and loses in all the categories it has thus far championed.  The girl with the epic death wish wanders aimlessly and has some remarkably juvenile reasons for wanting oblivion.  She loses credibility as a dark antihero.  If it happened slowly throughout the series I could see it working, but they defanged her way too quickly.  The cook doesn't get tougher for the company he keeps and stays shrugging and stumbling throughout the story.  The bear speaks the proud language of his people which, regrettably for the viewer, involves him ending every sentence with ""kuma.""  Every single one.  Imagine someone saying ""period"" after every utterance.  It's a neat idea that is painful to behold.

The animation also dives to head shaking levels.  Three frame movements and combat choreography gimmicks steal the action.

All in all, this starts off with a lot of promise and then sinks quickly to a run of the mill cheap anime title with nothing new offered and nothing new gained.  It's a better ride than most S.A.V.E. titles, but that's not saying much.  There might be something special here for fans of the game, but for your average anime viewer, there are only characters as dry as sand, and pacing that makes you yearn for destruction.

Good S.A.V.E.'s so far:

- Jyu Oh Sei: Planet of the Beast King
- Corpse Princess
- Black Blood Brothers

4253849,5,B0043988N0,this is a great one season tv show.  i enjoyed it quite a lot XD it can be funny and the animation is pretty good.,1362614400,,114,3.56
4253850,5,B0043988N0,"First of all, I'll say this, the anime has a different intake on the world than the game. As a result, the anime ends up being a lighter version of the game while still keeping the tone. This means many things are different.

First of all, the anime focuses more on the power of friendship and is very optimistic compared to the game that is rather pessimistic and dark despite the cute graphics. The action scenes in the anime are kept to a bare minion and it's about building the friendship and looking at the different views of different people. So while the anime does touch on racism, tyranny, segregation and questioning if the world is worth being destroyed or not, it manages to keep a happier feeling and as a result, the anime ends up being very satisfying when it ends.

Here are some obvious things that changed in the anime beside the characters.

Many of the beast lords are less villainous or the more evil ones are left out in the anime. The ones left in the anime are there for comic relief and the more dangerous ones are only shown at the end. Ironically Felix who is helpful in the game and nice to Rhia is the villain of the first episode.

The idea of destroying the world is different. Instead of Morte having Kyrie along just because she thinks he can destroy the world is now switched with an item called the Destruct Code in the form of a bomb. She thinks that if she takes Kyrie with her to the end of the world, then it will activate and destroy everything. Better than going around and going on a killing spree just because Morte feels like it.

Kyrie overall is different in the anime compared to his game counterpart. He is utterly incompetent in terms of fighting but serves as a peace maker (but when that fails, he's the first to run and hide). It's bad for a protagonist like him who was at least the fragile speedster in the game. He's mainly there to be the one to set Morte and Toppi straight if things get out of hand.

Morte has the biggest chance though. Instead of being a crazy psychopath who just wants to destroy the world for the heck of it, her reason now is motivated by guilt and revenge for being powerless against those that wronged her. As a result, Morte is a far more likable character. Given the anime goes for the lighter approach of the situation, Kyrie can easily get her to change her mind compared to her video game counterpart.

Toppi isn't as much of an ass as he was in the game where he's willing to sell his friends out for money. He tags along because of being association by accident and the fact that he looks after Kyrie. He actually gets more episodes to himself then the other two and serves as the main fighter when Morte fails to win a battle.

Agan was demoted to extra no longer being Morte's childhood friend and is just a smuggler for cash. He supports the group every now and then but is also willing to give away their location for cash. He like Kyrie no longer fights either and is just an observer.

Rhia and Naja are demoted to extra as well but suffer as the goldish poop gang. Rhia's personality is 180 now. Instead of being the calm, pleasant dragon girl, she's now a short tempered, insane dragon girl that loses it with little provoking. I found this change horrifying given how sweet and kind she is in the game (and in the anime, she does have a sweet personality toward Kyrie after she develops feelings for him). Naja doesn't suffer from the racism that he does in the game and as a result is often put in charge of capturing the World Destruction Committee. More times than not, he lets them get away or seems to be tricked easily (which is shocking given how smart he is).

Overall, you don't need to play the game to enjoy the anime. In fact, it's better to watch the anime before the game because the change in personality and tone is jarring. Overall I liked this anime. It's simple and has a good moral at the end of the series.",1361491200,5,3925,4.357045143638851
4253851,5,B0043988N0,"The story has a slow start as you learn the characters and what the heck is going on.  As the story continues the characters grow and the story forms.  The story comes with a twist.

4253856,5,B0043988N0,"This anime reminded me of ""Trigun"" in the look and feel, and the surprise character revelations at the end. We have a band of adventurers (The World Destruction League) traveling across the seasonally named continents. Two humans: Morte, the typically gorgeous anime babe has the ""Destruct Code"", a device that can ""reset"" the planet. Kyrie is a drifter, a teenage guy that has no apparent goals in life.  Finally is Taupy, an overly-cute Dwarf Bear, who is both a hero and a warrior. Both the babe and bear have almost super-human strength. Now, since the populace really does not want the world reset, a special group is formed: The World Salvation League.  Through most of the episodes, we only see the two key field agents -  Naja and Rhi'a.

I was really hoping that Kyrie and Rhi'a would hook up. There was an unexplored possibility there I would have liked to see develop, but with only 13 episodes there was not enough time.

This is really an excellent series, with fantastic voice-over, great animation and a unique plot. If you liked Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, or Gungrave, this is for you!",1355270400,,1096,4.747368421052632
4253857,3,B0043988N0,"Sands of Destruction is a fun anime about a young girl on a quest to destroy the world who ends up with a well mannered boy and a hero bear as a companion.  While that sounds somewhat dark (except for the bear part, kuma) the show is actually a traveling or road trip adventure story.  The unlikely trio of heroes.. who want to destroy the world share in a number of amusing adventures that's sure to entertain.

Story wise the show isn't groundbreaking.  You'll enjoy what's there but you're not going to remember this in years to come.  But it's good enough to bring a smile to your face and you do feel for the central characters.

Animation and art style is fairly solid.  It's not as fluid or vibrant as an A title anime but it's not cheap in it's appearance either.

Audio and music is a fairly standard affair, nothing really stands out as either positive or negative.

I would rate this anime 3.5/5 stars if I could but 3/5 will have to suffice.  It's a fun story, plenty of humor, a little action and a little drama to tug at your heartstrings if generic sob stories get to you.",1352160000,2,1087,4.336633663366337

This anime had some good characters, but it was way short. There wasn't enough time to get attached to the characters or explore their backgrounds and develop their depth very well. The quality of this anime is pretty good, but like most video game based animes; it lacked depth.

She unintentionally picks up some more committee members in Kyrie, a good natured guy who seems pretty useless, and Taupy, a butt-kicking bounty-hunter bear.

I found myself liking this series much more than I had expected. I knew it was based on a video game, which I have yet to decide is a good or bad thing. But it was cheap (and this set even cheaper), only 13 episodes, and ANN gave it a decent review, so I figured it would be worth it to give it a try. To my surprise, not only was it a fun journey of randomness and general pointlessness, but the ending was satisfyingly done. I liked Kyrie and Taupy, and Morte was only slightly unbearable (Her desire to destroy the world is annoying and illogical, but essentially unimportant). The sand world was interesting and creative. The plot is episodic until the last two or three. The short stories aren't very interesting, but the overall plot was fun.

4253865,4,B0043988N0,"I admit, I avoided this one for a long time because I knew it was based on a videogame, but when it became available on Netflix streaming I said, okay, I'll bite.  I watched a few episodes and was quickly hooked.  It has reasonably good action, and makes for a good ""road-movie"" buddy-story, or trio of friends in this particular instance.  Good voice acting props to Todd Haberkorn, Luci Christian, and especially Rob McCollum who plays Toppy the pirate teddy-bear with a straight face kuma.
(no that was not a typo kuma). ;-  Also enjoyed Trina Nishimura as Lia Dragunel; Trina often plays hyper, very intense young women and Lia is a shining example (see also Trina's performance in Rideback)...Morte (Luci) is a distraught, grief-stricken woman who has lost her brother to a brutal Civil war between humans and beast-men...she is so consumed by her grief she wants to destroy the evil, corrupt world that caused her brother to die, which sets in motion the rest of what happens in the show.

This is a story about a journey; a journey of many miles but also a journey of souls in search of peace and redemption and freedom.  It is a story of budding friendships reaching full bloom.  It is a story of people willing to risk everything for the people they love and care about.  It is well told, well paced, with plenty of action but also plenty of comedy and playful banter.
