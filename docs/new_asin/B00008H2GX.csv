Not much on suspense but endless fun, and just erotic enough to make the weak special effects ignoreable.  A don't miss night of film fun!

7984086,4,B00008H2GX,"This is a collection of obscure drive-in flicks that's complete with loads of extras.  The films vary in quality and explicitness; some are very explicit while a couple are tame. You get 4 individually packaged DVDs, but one of the DVDs is a massive collection of trailers of other films available from Something Weird Video.  I don't think that any of these films will appeal to most mainstream horror fans,

THE BEAST THAT KILLED WOMEN
This is an extremely low budget 60s nudie film about a gorilla(it's nothing more than a guy literally wearing a cheap Halloween ape costume) attacking nude women at a 60s nude resort.  There's a lot of nudity that's limited to topless and rear scenes, and the film has no gore and a low body count. Some of the films scenery is pretty good, and the movie isn't action packed. It lacks suspense and is nice and easy to follow. With the exception of some parts, the tone of the film is usually somewhat relaxing because of the films locations. I thought the directing was OK, but the film drags in parts.  However, the film is short; It's over with quickly, and I like these drive-in trash films, so I wasn't that bored. The DVD quality on the film is great.

MONSTER OF CAMP SUNSHINE
This is a black-and-white movie about a guy becoming a madman when he drinks a toxic chemical.  There's no gore, and it has a low body count. There's nudity, but it's limited to topless and rear scenes.  This film is well directed, and it moves at a decent pace. I'm not a fan of black-and-white horror, but I thought this one was entertaining.  The film is really low budget, and the DVD quality is very good

NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES
This is a really trashy gore flick from the 70s.  The body count is pretty good, and the graphic and cheap HG Lewis type gore should please most gore fans; and they also threw in some scenes of open heart surgery that are supposed to be real.  There's some good nude scenes in this one, the film moves at a decent pace, and the directing is decent.  The silly but fun story about a heart transplant that transforms a guy into a mad ape man is entertaining.  The main reason to see this film is for the very graphic gore; if you're not a fan of low budget extreme gore films, you probably won't like it.  The DVD quality is excellent.

FEAST OF FLESH
This is an obscure black-and-white film about a masked maniac who kills with needles. It has some very brief bits of topless nudity, and there's only a very minimal amount of blood in the film. The film is a little slow in parts and very tame by todays standards, but I suppose it might be fairly explicit for the time it was made. The film bored me the first time I saw it. However, it got better with another viewing. The film has some good atmosphere, and the scenery is pretty good at times. The directing is OK, but the film would've been better with a faster pace and more atmosphere. The maniac and some of the music is pretty creepy, but the body count is low. If you're a fan of a lot of black-and-white horror films, you might like it more than me because I'm not a big fan of most black-and-white movies. The DVD quality is very good.

MIGHTY GORGA
This is a tame but really fun film.  There's no gore or nudity, but the directing and scenery is good.  It's about a circus owner who needs a big attraction to save his circus, so he tries to capture a giant King Kong ape monster; it's a cheap film, so it's a guy wearing an ape costume.  This film is slow moving;  It gets talky at times, and there are people just wandering around in the jungle. Most of the film is supposed to take place in Africa, but they obviously didn't film it in the jungle; the film is cheap, so they couldn't afford to actually film it there.  I liked the cheap and phony scene when the gorilla battles the dinosaur, and there's also a funny scene where the guy throws a big prehistoric egg at the dinosaur. Watch it at night or when you're tired and don't want to see something that's too loud and action packed; the film does have some action, but most of it isn't until much later on in the film. Aside from some parts, the film usually concentrates on providing a nice relaxing type tone. The DVD quality is very nice.

ONE MILLION AC/DC
This is an obscure sexploitation flick with elements of horror tossed in.  Sometimes it plays seriously, while at other times it's campy.  This film is very explicit with plentiful full nudity, and I thought the directing was OK.  There isn't any over the top gore, but there's some blood.  It's simply about a cave of sex crazed cave men and women who are menaced by a man eating dinosaur.  Aside from the dinosaur, they are also nuts and attack each other.  The pace is very fast, and it's simple to follow because it has hardly any plot; it's just a cheap and trashy exploitation flick.  This film is only recommended if you just want cheap and exploitive trash. The DVD quality is very good.",1353715200,3,4932,4.3702081051478645
7984087,5,B00008H2GX,"The top reviewer is spot on, this set is a fantastic deal, insane amount of 60's camp and skin, gobs of extras, I think it clocks in at around 11hours of content for $25, I'm watching One Million AC/DC again right now, good stuff) But of course these are drive in type movies from the 60's, mindless titillation fare, least anyone is looking for serious cinema, look elsewhere.",1330300800,3,377,4.5588235294117645
7984088,5,B00008H2GX,"I just wanted to say, These movies are all great, and others like them. I must own about 150 movies of this type. A Lot of people that leave reviews for these types of movies always seem to use the words ""So bad They are Good"". I have never felt that way. To me these movies are so good because they ARE good! ""Something Weird Video Company"" is probably THE BEST distributor of this stuff. And they make the movies even more enjoyable with all their extras they add to the discs, stuff you probably just wouldn't see anywhere else. When you think of all the work the filmmakers of these movies put into creating them, because they did most of the work themselves, you begin to appreciate their efforts. I like that these movies are what they are. An art form within themselves. Nowadays they are extra fun cause you get to see all those old classic cars when they were all new. And the shots of old grocery items, or the shots of the old style gas stations. Fun is the best way to describe these movies. Great Stuff.",1329264000,4,1016,4.324607329842932

Can you stand the excitement? Want more? Then check out FEAST OF FLESH (aka ""Blood Feast""), the first-ever splatter movie from the genre's legendary creator, Herschell Gordon Lewis! Filmed in Miami in 1963 for a buck-and-a-half, this is the nightmarish tale of a homicidal Egyptian caterer who dismembers his victims, using their body parts to reanimate a long-dead goddess.

THE MIGHTY GORGA is the film's writer/director David L. Hewitt in a cheap gorilla costume. Surprisingly OK cast quickly sinks into an ad-libbed miasma. The subtitle of THE MONSTER OF CAMP SUNSHINE was obviously influenced by Dr. Strangelove-- any similarity ends there, however. In this one, a nudist camp's gardener drinks water tainted with toxic waste and transforms into a ghastly creature that attacks the unclothed campers.

The ""highlight"" of the Mexican-made NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES is probably footage of actual open heart surgery. A mad scientist tries curing his son's leukemia by giving him the heart of an ape (pronounced ""gore-EEE-yah""). The boy predictably turns into a gnarly monkeyman and goes on a bloody rampage. ONE MILLION AC/DC was scripted by Ed Wood! (Big deal...) The movie's tagline says it all: ""See...Vala, the voluptuous cave babe! See...Mota, the mighty war-lard! See...Dino, the plastic-eating dinosaur!""
