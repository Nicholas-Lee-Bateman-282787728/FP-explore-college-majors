2647774,4,B000HXDQME,"""Carson Country"" is an entertaining collection of classic ""Tonight Show"" material  most of it previously unreleased. Running more than 70 minutes, the DVD includes memorable appearances by Dwight Yoakam and Buck Owens, The Judds, and Johnny Cash (who performs ""Ring of Fire"" in a rare kinescope). Comedy highlights range from Johnny's job interview with Jay ""Tonto"" Silverheels to a wild barroom brawl featuring Doug McClure, James Drury and stuntman Hal Needham. Docked one star for omitting Carson's hilarious 1976 rendition of ""Rhinestone Cowboy,"" which he sang while mounted on a Shetland pony.",1174608000,6,598,5.5

2647776,3,B000HXDQME,"I'm a big fan of Johnny Carson but the producers of these highlight dvds are putting out a lot of his less interesting stuff.  In this most recent dvd of ""Carson Country"" we are promised new great musical performances that have never been released before.  Unfortunately, this makes up a small fraction of what's actually on the dvd, which was a problem on his prior releases on the Ultimate Collection.  Although all of the material is new and never seen since it was aired, a lot of the stuff is quite boring. Unfortunately, on one of the few musical performances that we do see with Dwight Yokam and Buck Owens, the quality looks its from a bootleg almost. The picture is blurry and the sound is tinny sounding. The only good quality peformace is with the Judds. We see a lot of no name guests interviewed on the dvd that are not very interesting at all. Although Johnny does a great job of keeping it funny, celebrites are very much lacking on this dvd with few exceptions such as Michael Langdon and the Judds.  Whoever is selecting the material for these releases should be fired. Johnny Carson had a lot more interesting content in his vast archive but each release has been very disappointing. Although this dvd is disappointing I would still recommend this dvd to Carson fans because it's all we have left from him..",1163635200,14,1325,4.601694915254237
2647777,5,B000HXDQME,"This is an interesting glimpse back into the huge variety of guests Johnny had on The Tonight Show.  This single disc features a wide variety of ""Country-Themed"" guests that range from country comics and musical stars (there are really interesting early appearances by The Judds, and a terrific really early appearance by Johnny Cash), to cowboy stars (John Wayne does a funny walk on appearance), to real people like the country's oldest farmer. It's good clean fun.

8142084,3,B000HXDQME,This is a pretty good dvd.  It is clips from Johnny Carson's tonight show.  Featuring country artists.  Which for me the highlight is The Judds doing Grandpa.  There are also sketches.  Like James Drury and Doug McClure in a bar room brawl.  It just isn't something you want to watch everyday.,1504224000,,293,4.647058823529412
8142085,5,B000HXDQME,"Johnny Carson:Carson Country is a fun DVD ! Best segements to me are Michael Landon, playing a joke on Johnny, a 97 year old farmer being interviewed by Johnny, Brett Butller's first comic appearance, The Judds making an early appearance singing Grandpa,Tell Me About The Good Old Days, and a wonderful clip of Johnny Cash in 1964 doing his hit Ring Of Fire.
