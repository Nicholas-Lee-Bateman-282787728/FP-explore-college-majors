8751918,5,B01BXVE3RK,"Mary had us in stitches the whole time! I had read negative comments about this but we agree it looked like it was actually pretty well made. You can tell her pal over at United Artists, Charlie Chaplin, had been coaching her with the hilarious slapstick. Sure she uses an obvious fake French accent. So what? It adds to the comedy and we found her once again just plain cute. Wife and I have been great Mary Pickford fans for some time. We've seen most of her films except this one. I had heard about Kiki and wanted to see it. But it simply wasn't available until now. The print isn't that bad, we've seen worse. Enjoyed it slightly enhanced through our UHD equipment and just had to reduce the brightness a tad and up the contrast. Hopefully the Mary Pickford Foundation will restore it further like the 4k version of Little Annie Rooney. As it is we're glad we now have Kiki in our collection. We'll be sure to return to it again soon!",1491004800,2,939,4.371428571428571
8751919,2,B01BXVE3RK,"I don't know where Alpha gets the prints they sell. this one looks like a 16 mm. There is a lot of unwanted noise in the background of the soundtrack which  makes it very hard to understand also the track has a very bad flutter all the way thru. The print is very fuzzy and washed out.  this seems to be the only print there is. the musical number is directed by Busby Berkley and Alfred Newman did the music.  Margaret Livingston, the girl from the city(Sunrise) is the other woman. If you can watch it  all the way thru some parts are very funny.",1461628800,10,548,4.190476190476191
