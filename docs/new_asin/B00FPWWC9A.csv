How can this product be of ANY USE whatsoever, to ANYONE? ..>  ALL PAN & SCAN; > LOOKS LIKE THESE 'TRANSFERS CAME FROM HORRIBLE BEAT UP 16MM PRINTS; > AND TOPPING ALL CRITIQUE-- BY QUICK CHECK, IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY ONE OF THEM IS OUT OF FOCUS! >THIS IS A TOTAL RIP-OFF AND A TOTAL WASTE OF ANBODY'S TIME. >JUST AWFUL. Are there any other COMBOS of this kind of cinema out there that are WORTH buying/having?! < I bought it mainly because it includes one of ALAN LADD's last and rarest titles : ""DUEL OF CHAMPIONS"" and it was an AWFUL experience to try to watch--so I just listened to it. Seriously!  And it's ALL THAT BAD!  HOW CAN THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT SELLING THIS CRUD?",1498521600,,689,4.244274809160306
8617872,1,B00FPWWC9A,Very bad. Video quality really sucks except for 1st movie.,1495411200,3,58,4.9
8617873,3,B00FPWWC9A,I have not watched all of these yet.  I have most of the movies on other sets or single.  But there was a couple of them I wanted and didn't have.  Everything was fine with the quality.,1487030400,,185,3.945945945945946

8617877,3,B00FPWWC9A,A good collection of movies. Video quality could be better on some of the movies,1450569600,4,80,4.4
8617878,4,B00FPWWC9A,This DVD with many classic adventure movies and a good one from 2005 with Christopher Lambert (Day of wrath) is also being selled with the titile Legion of Warriors. Please read the review of this Dvd for the names of the other movies to not make the same mistake I almost did : buy the same 20 movies twice! But it is an okay Dvd with many movies from the classic sword/jungle or heroes era (50-60s). Good relaxation from the violent ones of today.,1404259200,11,449,4.357142857142857
