1197320,3,B000009DTN,"First, don't be deceived by the illustration for this short. The illustration is from an entirely different episode - ""Three Little Pirates,"" I believe - with the classic ""Maha"" - ""Aha"" routine. This episode also involves a Middle Eastern theme though a very different one. The Larry-as-restaurant-cook scene is classic Stooges - and one of those moments when Larry is more than just a prop for Moe's anger or Shemp's klutziness. (Yes. In spite of the illustration, Curly does not appear in this episode.)

This isn't one of the Stooges' best shorts. Or even one of their best with Shemp. But it offers enough of their trademark slapstick to satisfy most die-hard fans. And, well, you may never look at hot dogs quite the same way again Woof!",1461110400,,742,4.796875

1197334,3,B000009DTN,It is a 3 Stooges short so I don't expect logical continuity.

1197336,4,B000009DTN,"The Three Knuckleheads, oops I mean The Three Stoogies, have their own brand, style, fashion of doing their own comedies as they perform in this short, silly, absurd comedy.

No one like the Three Stoogies. They are tough to imitate. Only the cartoons like the Simpson's itchy and Scratchy come close to duplicating the art of comedy performed by the trio. This one, Malice in the Palace, is with Shemp, no Curly, but Moe and Larry are still there. Shemp is a good substitute for Curly. Instead of substitute I should say a punching, patsy, gag bag. He's a good fall guy for Moe's outrageous, funny anger outbursts.

It's tough to top this trio for slapstick, and ridiculous, humor. There's a gag every second. Nonetheless, the trio are inventives. They have a new kind of humor up their sleeves all the time. Usually involving smacking, slapping, or shaking.

Also, they play on false identity or identity misinterpretation like they do in this short film. In one gag, Larry goes into the kitchen with a cat. Meows and screeching are heard. Then Larry returns to the dining room and grabs the dog. Barking and screeching are heard. Soon enough hot dogs are on the table.

The diners then mistaken, misinterpreted, misunderstand what they had heard for what they see on their table: hot dogs A laugh a second.

What makes the trio so hilarious are gags by clowns dressed up as normal, everyday people. As clowns they are hysterically funny yet they don't wear the customs of clowns: big shoes, cone-shaped hats, red noses. They work best when the viewers see them as dunces, clowns, pure Knuckleheads but dressed up normally.

Nonetheless, what the Three Stoogies do is so unlike the performances by other comedians. There is simply no one like them. They were absolutely originals. Unfortunately, however they were also difficult to imitate. Except for cartoons, where they were often imitated.

As the saying goes, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. And a lot of animated humor is based on The Three Stoogies.

If there is one fault I find with their humor, sometimes they are too silly, too comical, too absurd. In watching them for years, I have found many either like or hate them. There's no middle ground when it comes to the Three Stoogies. Personally, I like them; I like their style of humor.",1445212800,,2315,4.784461152882206

1197475,4,B000009DTN,"Like another reviewer mentioned -- perhaps in a different ""short"" -- this movie brings back memories to me of watching 3 Stooges on TV in the 1960s and laughing myself silly during the shows. Some times my sitter Joanie would let me watch a show, and would make popcorn for all hands (including my brother and herself.) This short really brings back some of those 1960s memories. This also brings back memories from my days as a trainee computer programmer in my very first shop. One of the experienced ""old hands"" was a big 3 Stooges fan: his desk had 3 Stooges posters and punched cards all about. He would avidly write down information about the 3 Stooges and he did tell me that one of them had fallen sick. Working with that person and learning more about the Stooges made my work life there more challenging and more interesting.

I rated this 4 out of 5 stars because it doesn't have closed captioning and as a deaf person, I would really like to know the dialogue.",1390348800,,972,4.491525423728813

1197497,5,B000009DTN,"Without doubt, the best collection of Moe, Larry and Shemp short films. Volume 5 is marred by the year 1946 and the weakness of the ""sick"" era Curly films. Volume 7 has the ""Shemp recycle"" films holding it back, but here there are no such problems. The Shemp era stooges are at the height of their powers, long before the encroachment of television, one day shooting schedules and stock footage would become the pox on their short film careers.

Maybe the best short of the entire collection is the hilarious ""Scrambled Brains"" directed by Jules White, who seems to get knocked by a lot of stooge fans, but I think he was a terrific director and most of his Shemp output is classic stuff to me. ""Scrambled"" has the plot of a mentally ill Shemp Howard who hallucinates that a homely (to put it mildly) hospital nurse is actually a shapely blonde dish who he intends to marry. Among Shemp's other hallucinations is that he has an extra pair of hands when he's playing at the piano. Also, watch for that hilarious phone booth scene when all 3 stooges are crammed in there with great stooge foil Vernon Dent. Laugh out loud hilarity.

Also included on this set are greats such as ""Who Done It?"", ""Fuelin' Around"", ""Malice in the Palace"", and the great remake ""Pest Man Wins"" which almost tops the original Curly classic ""Ants in the Pantry"".

1197503,5,B000009DTN,"Aaah, the ""Shemp / Curly"" debate. I was addicted to Three Stooges shorts on TV as a kid, and I loved them all, but Shemp was always my personal favorite. He seemed like the ultimate ""mutt,"" the guy that was NEVER going to get an even break, no matter what. Shemp, A.K.A. Samuel Horwitz (March 4, 1895 - November 22, 1955), had more than a few ""golden moments""...just like Moe, Larry and Curly...and you'll find them on this set.

Other Amazon reviewers have been kind enough to post the complete episode list, so I won't repeat it in my review. I just want to point to two shorts that, in my humble opinion, are ""career-best"" performances by the Stooges.

First, ""Dunked In The Deep""...microfilm hidden in salami, intrigue on the high seas, all of the slapstick tomfoolery you've come to know and love.

The #1 spot, though, goes to ""Hula La La,"" and before I go any further I have to warn you about a brief spoiler (stop reading here if you want to skip it)...

...Moe, Larry and Shemp face headhunters on the island of ""Rarabonga."" In one of the funniest lines of the entire series, the witch doctor ""Varanu"" (series regular Kenneth MacDonald) points to Shemp and says ""You...the BEAUTIFUL one.""

I know, I know...you had to be there. And I was.

I believe there are three kinds of Three Stooges fans:

1). Those who ""don't get it"" and aren't really fans at all

2). Those who have decided between Shemp and Curly

3). True fans, who may have a preference, but love the whole series.

These remastered DVD sets are LONG overdue. Fans who have seen inferior VHS / DVD sets can attest to that, especially of the shorts that fell into ""public domain"" status. To be able to pick up the whole series, in chronological order, is a real treat. I confess that I plan to get the Shemp episodes first and add the Curly episodes later, but over a half-century after these classics were originally filmed, they've neither been topped nor equaled.

If you are the wealthy Mrs. Caster, you have big plans to expand your fledgling bakery business, and, what better way to drum up business than to invite the Restaurant Owner's Association over for a formal dinner buffet featuring your cakes and pies . . . .

Happily, you have a good turn-out, everything is going fine but you regret your choice of footwear.  Your maid helps you hobble upstairs to switch shoes.  Unexpectedly she finds moths in your closet, you find a mouse in your shoe, and somehow you have ants down your back!  The restaurateurs will never buy your pastries if they find out . . . .

Fortunately, men from ""Lightning Pest Control"" show up at the front door.  You tell them not to let-on to your guests that they are exterminators.  You have the butler dress them in tuxes.  But quickly things go south: a mouse flies through the air and a cluster of cats come screeching out of your upright piano!  The party is going to be a catastrophe unless . . . .

You manage to get the head of the association in another room for a quiet presentation; he seems amenable.  As you escort him back to the buffet room, you scarcely notice the commotion there as you continue to make your pitch with, ""I just know you are going to love my pies!"" and, suddenly, you find yourself - adorned with pie makeup . . . .

The second best comic bit in this collection is in ""Malice in the Palace"":  Two restaurant patrons worry that Larry is serving them cat and dog!

It's a matter of taste, I suppose.  Curly was the jolliest stooge.  Shemp was something of a sad Stooge, the victim of inanimate objects as well as his impatient brother Moe.  And therein lies the lack of appreciation for Shemp's comedic talents.  Comparing Shemp and Curly is like comparing apples and oranges--or cream pies and oranges.

While some think these episodes of Stoogedom are rehashes and pale versions of Curly's work, I see them as Shemp reinterpretations.  Let's let Shemp be Shemp.

So sit back and enjoy slapstick comedy the way it was meant to be, an escape from the filthy and talentless ""comedians"" of today.  Keep an open mind, and delight in Shemp Howard:  the unappreciated Stooge.",1290211200,,919,4.858064516129033

1197510,5,B000009DTN,"This is a review of ""The Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 6:
1949-1951,"" a collection of 24 of their later day Columbia Pictures
shorts remastered and released on DVDs by Sony.

By the time we join the mayhem- prone trio, Shemp has become just like
the original Stooge that he always was.  This, after all, is show biz
and in biz there's not much room for sentiment unless you can profit from
it. And Curly, who languished in forced retirement because of ill health
until his death in 1951, would as it turned out, always be remembered as
the primo Stooge.

But in 1951 I doubt that this was much considered, after all, the audience
for things like comedy short subjects, newreels, cartoons and travelogues
was rapidly dwindling as television took over the entertainment landscape
and a night out at the movies was beginning to look more like a hassle
than a treat. It seemed much easier to settle for what was on TV than
going out to sit with sometimes annoying strangers to watch something that
may or may not have been much good.

But at Columbia Pictures, the Three Stooges kept rolling along, turning
out some pretty funny stuff. Maybe a little short on the inventive spark
that marked some of their earlier efforts, but still fairly funny and Shemp
had more than a litle to do with that.

Take a look at the short entitled  ""Self Made Maids,"" in which the boys
wind up playing themselves, as usual, plus their fiancees and eventually
their infants. Maybe they weren't Brando but that's my kind of method
acting.

And speaking of methods, catch the improv throughout ""Don't Throw That
Knife,"" in which the Stooges improvise in a room full of kitchen utensils.
Taking virtualy nothing and giving us one laugh after another apparently
unscripted is both the acme of comedy genius and arrogance, but if
anyone could pull it off it was The Stooges.

So I give ""The Three Stooges Collection Vol. 6: 1949-1951"" my highest
recommendation not just because of the difficulties they had to overcome
or any of the circumstances surrounding the making of these comedy short
subjects, but because of the fact that these films are just plain funny.

Even after all these years, The Three Stooges still had it and it
was begining to look like the germ of comedy genius would never
desert them.  Five Stars, flat out.",1278547200,,2304,4.694789081885856
1197511,3,B000009DTN,"Here we are on Volume Six of The Three Stooges Collection from Sony,giving us their shorts ranging from Feb/49 to Dec/51. It is a mixed bag to say the least,hit and miss all the way;the misses becoming more frequent than the hits. Cost cutting measures were the order of the day at Columbia now and their best gag men were gone. The boys would start habitually borrowing from many old well worn routines and Columbia,to stretch the bottom line,would reuse the dickens out of stock footage from previous shorts. And it would just get worse as the years progressed. Also Jules White himself was starting to take the directing helm more often than not and he didn't have the timing sense of the previous directors.
Footage from The Ghost Talks would be used later in the Feb/56 short Creeps. Vagabond Loafers is a remake of the short A Plumbing we Will Go with Curly. This time Shemp is the one getting stuck in the pipe maze in the bathroom but it just never comes off as funny as his younger brothers effort. Stock footage from Half Wits Holiday was used in Vagabond Loafers and this entire short would be re-used almost intact in the Oct/56 short Scheming Schemers. Don't Throw That Knife has alot of their older short 'No Census no Feeling' in it. Merry Mavericks has footage from Phoney Express in it. The final entry The Pest Man is a remake of Ants in the Pantry with stock footage from(again)Half Wits Holiday.
Helping the proceedings along are a couple of new faces,one being Gene Roth who would be used as another heavy,seen in Dunked in the Deep. One fellow who appeared in one short in the previous set is seen in a couple in this one. Jacques or Jock Mahoney,while you may not know the name,is memorable for his appearances in the Stooges cannon as a kind of a Dudley Do-Right character. Tall,blond and good looking he is usually the boyfriend of Christine McIntrye's character. He's dumb as a fence post and he will usually say something like:""Well,I'm-a riddin'"".He turns and falls right over a chair. His next words will be""It didn't hurt much"".Then as he turns to go out the door he will hit the wall instead. He appeared in a scant few shorts but as I say they are all memorable to say the least and he could do physical comedy(brilliant falls) to a tee. Also on hand to help the Stooges out here is now-regular Emil Sitka with his googly eyed expressions and takems.
I will let the readers decide their favourite shorts but I will mention two of note,for different reasons. One is Self Made Maids and here the boys play themselves along with their sweethearts and their children. Appearing in drag goes back to the oldest traditions of theater and of film and the brothers Howard and Fine play them wonderfully. The Tooth Will Out is a miss that starts out promisingly but fades unexpectedly. They learn dentistry in two weeks and upon their graduation they have to make a set of dentures. Shemp's is not only the best but it sings and talks! Great stuff until they run out of the room,leaving the now-animated dentures behind and onto the rest of the film. It was an opportunity sadly missed out on.
Speaking of singing if you hadn't noticed by now the Stooges do sing in some of their shorts and their harmony is well done at that. It really adds to the overall feeling of the shorts not to mention the on screen camaraderie of the Stooges themselves. However what detracts from the proceedings(an getting worse)is the hitting and slapping. What could be generally funny in shorts gone by is now slowly but surely becoming vulgar at times. Moe and the boys are visibly older now and Moe's physical attacks on his cohorts seem more like the act of a disgruntled old man,which takes the laughs totally out of the comedy equation. This kind of humour has always walked a very fine line and the Stooges were really never able to maintain a consistent mark on the straight and narrow. On top of this their direction by White was less than stellar and I'm sure with nothing else to think of he would tell them to throw it in just for filler.
As usual this set has been transferred wonderfully onto DVD and in Hi Def at that. They look simply great.
In conclusion while Shemp is now fully ensconced as Curly's supplanter,his films with Moe and Larry are giving with as many,if not more,misses as hits. The use and re-use of stock footage is being ramped up as are the old routines. These shorts are symptomatic of things to come,unfortunately. Let's go on to Volume Seven to see what transpires from 1952 through to 1954.",1277596800,,4532,4.575645756457565

This Collection covers 1949 to 1951, and has two or three losers, (""Self Made Maids"", being one, where the boys play themselves, their wives, and children), but the laugh content is pretty high in most, especially in the excellent ""Studio Stoops""; also the remake of ""Ants In The Pantry"" called ""Pest Man Wins"", with a particularly great supporting cast. Another winner is ""Punchy Cowpunchers"", featuring a terrific comic performnace by loose-limbed, straight-faced Jock Mahoney, surely an under-appreciated star; and by Chrisdtine McIntyre, who always excels at satire: here she plays the defenseless sweetheart of the ""hero"" (Mahoney), though she's far from defenseless. They're so good, one must wonder why the studio didn't create a stand-alone series for them!
Christine McIntyre, Vernon Dent, Emil Sitka, Symona Boniface, are always fine - too bad they had to endure some gruesome stuff: seems that Producer Jules White was obsessed with blows to the head, with hammers, knives, planes; whatever blunt or chiseled objects which just happen to be lying around.
However, some of the best comedy dialogue ever presented is found right here on this DVD set, particularly by Edward Bernds.
Sad that the reported second Curly cameo reportedly was cut in '48 or '49 from ""Malice In The Palace"", one of their best. Research shows that his reluctant Chef part would have been essential for continuity (and for the delight of his fans - though it seems that he was heavily disguised in his role).
A mention of this intriquing piece of film history would have been wonderful - though there are *no* historical notes, no essay. What a shame.

After indulging in strong whiskey,the boys nap and Shemp awakes with his feet implanted in a tub of dried cement. In SELF-MADE MAIDS,there are no supporting actors. Moe,Larry and Shemp play multiple roles. In THREE HAMS ON RYE,the boys as theatre actors about to be fired,are in pursuit of a heckling critic.

1197530,5,B000009DTN,"From what I can tell there are only two things missing from these 24 newly remastered shorts. One is the debris, grain, dirt and sound hissing that used to plague these wonderful shorts when they aired on television and the second is bonus material. This wonderful set contains all 24 shorts from 1949-1951 on two single sided discs packaged in slim cases. The disc artwork and packaging is fantastic to say the least, making this set even more attractive and highly collectible for any Knucklehead to own.

Thanks to Sony Studios ""Three Stooges"" Fans have 24 more reasons to celebrate with the recently released Three Stooges Collection, Vol. 6: 1949-1951. The 24 newly restored & remastered shorts from Sony Pictures are once again presented in chronological order completely uncut and politically incorrect and presented in Beautiful Black & White. Hip Hip Hooray!

Once again Sony Pictures have done an incredible job with the video & sound remastering and restoration with Volume six and fans should be very pleased with what they see & hear. In my opinion Stooge fans are in for a real treat with both the number of shorts included in volume six and the overall quality of the shorts themselves. In my opinion Shemp Howard is simply hilarious! It should be noted that 15 of the shorts found in this set have never been released on DVD and after viewing this set I can honestly say I don't remember seeing some of them. Sony Pictures should definitely be commended for their ongoing efforts and for finally giving ""Three Stooges"" fans the best possible quality shorts ever released.

The 24 digitally remastered & restored video transfers found in Volume six are simply amazing; no longer do these shorts look like they were made over 60 years ago and the newly restored soundtrack is the best I've ever heard these shorts sound. Poor Video & Sound quality from low budget DVD companies releasing ""Three Stooges"" material in the public domain was always a major concern for me and I wasn't sure what to expect from Sony pictures when they set out to remaster all 190 stooge shorts and put them in chronological order. I can honestly say that the poor picture & sound quality is a thing of the past and no longer a concern.  The newly remastered soundtrack has breathed new life into these amazing shorts for me and I have heard words and sound effects that I never heard before. Volume six is an absolute treat and I'm glad I own it!

Volume Six Shorts Include:

(1949)
The Ghost Talks
Who Done It?
Hokus Pokus
Fuelin' Around
Malice in the Palace
Vagabond Loafers
Dunked in the Deep

Sony Pictures has failed to include bonus material of any kind in these newly remastered sets so far and that's a big disappointment for me. I can only hope that loads of Bonus material will be included in the final installment after all 190 ""Three Stooges"" shorts have been completely restored & remastered.",1247097600,,3200,4.772151898734177

My young daughters and I have laughed the most from this 1949-1951 set. Almost every single short in this set is hilarious with great comedic timing. ""Baby Sitter Jitters"" with Shemp standing on his head and making the soap soup-hilarious!

I was very excited about this set being released, as I have only found this particular episode on VHS. Notice when Shemp gets seasick. His face (makeup) gets whiter and whiter. Then suddenly he makes a gag sound and spills a bucket of water on Moe, who believes that he had just been thrown-up on. Hilarious...only the Stooges.",1245283200,,587,4.6
1197536,5,B000009DTN,"So says Larry Fine to one of the otherworldy attendants at the end of director Ed Bernd's hilarious short ""Three Arabian Nuts!""

Recently, I have been faced with an increasingly difficult dilemma when planning my late-night video viewing: will it be ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Baby-Sitter's Jitters""?; ""Casablanca"" or ""Scrambled Brains?"" Decisions...decisions....

Here is a stooge lover's Nirvana--- ALL SHEMP and ALL (or mostly) outrageously funny.  To cite three of the best examples from this set, ""Fuelin' Around"" (my candidate for Shemp's best short, with Larry Fine at his comedic best), ""Scrambled Brains""(""Goodbye, old mackerel!"") and ""3 Arabian Nuts"", each a comic gem featuring something rather rare in these films---a genuinely funny and satisfying ENDING.

This set represents the high-point of Shemp's tenure with the Stooges, and thus the last real opportunity to see the trio in top form.  Note that the films directed (and sometimes written) by Ed Bernds have a special sense of comic legitimacy to them, an extra bit of ""class"" that almost elevates the Stooge's work to a higher level than they are generally given credit for.  Jules White, always capable of turning out genuinely funny stuff (and ""Scrambled Brains"" is one of the absolute funniest shorts the Stooges EVER made), would ultimately begin to churn out crude and careless films, as the studio's budgets continued to decline.

But none of this really matters when you're howling along with these shorts, each containing hilarious moments too numerous to mention. I will even go so far as to say (and I realize this borders on sacriledge) that ""Pest Man Wins""--featuring a terrific pie fight--is a better film than the Curly original ""Ants in the Pantry"" (""Which one of you put those cats in the piano!?""...).

From Bernds' stylish Western send-ups to Jules White's low-brow insanity, these shorts are filled with that special brand of lunacy that resulted when Shemp Howard re-joined the team.  What a relief that the Columbia executives have finally given these films their due by preserving them in such excellent transfers.  As Larry Fine would have advised them----""IT'S YOUR DUTY TO POSTERIOR!""

And while we're at it:

""I'm Brown from the Sun....Oh, that's too bad; are ya' peelin'?""
""Well there's the door, Man!""
""Give me dat Fillum!""
""Don't you understand Ingels?!""
""Somebody's roasting a ham!""
""I don't know...a fly went in mine, too!""
""That's open to conjecture....Thanks, I'll button mine..!""
""So long Mr. Bradley, and thanks for the lamp!""
""Ohhh...now I can carry it like a toothpick!""
""How do ya like that? He gave me the drippins!""
""Powdered Bacon; what'll they think of next?!""
""MAKE MINE FRIED!""
""Hey, hey--one of you guys is FLAT!""
""I'm dancin' from a Trombone part!""
""Show him, Tex...... YOU'RE Tex!""
""Wykoff.....""A little irritation in the throat, ma'am.""
""SHE'LL CALL ME STUMPY, I KNOW IT!!""

LAUGH YOURSELF SILLY!",1245283200,,2906,5.197002141327623
1197537,5,B000009DTN,"As the Stooges adapted to the new centerpiece of Shemp (who, technically, was the original centerpiece back in their 20's vaudeville days), the team forged ahead into the 50's. I remember such delightful Stooges shorts as ""Malice In The Palace"", ""Self-Made Maids"", & ""Merry Mavericks"", where Shemp deftly applied his years of skill as a salty-faced comic. ""Maids"", in particular, was a noble attempt to do something different as the boys donned drag--not an original concept in the Stooge shorts--but with pleasing results.
It's unfortunate that Columbia began reducing budgets for their short subjects department later on, which showed in the recycling of stories & production values on screen. Particularly painful (and bizarre) was when Columbia--even after Shemp's death--decided to ""fulfill"" his contract by making shorts with old stock footage of Shemp's face inserted & action shots of Moe & Larry running around with Shemp body doubles (some fans call these ""the fake Shemps"").

These six shorts are EASILY among the best the Stooges ever made.

On the other hand, I have to say that I do have all of the previous sets in this series. I can't name all of the titles. What I can do is remember when and where I watched the Stooges for the first time.

I walked home from elementary school everyday in the early 60's. Since our yard was adjacent to my grandparent's yard, Mom would have me stop there so my grandmother's housekeeper could watch me until Mom picked me up.

Some days I would run almost all of the way home so I wouldn't miss any of the Stooges. Cora Mae would pop popcorn and sneak me a forbidden Coca-Cola. She and I would sit on the living room floor and laugh to the point that I would almost pee myself. She would laugh at me laughing.

I almost believed those memories were just fantasy until these collections were released. Now I get to relive those days with my seven-year old daughter. She chooses the Stooges over Sponge Bob and laughs just as hard as I did/do.

It doesn't matter which are the best shorts. They are all great in there own right. I enjoy returning to a time where we could laugh till we were gasping to breathe. I am grateful that I can share this with my daughter.",1240531200,,1292,4.235772357723577

1197544,5,B000009DTN,Im very happy volume 6 is coming so quickly and I am also extremely thrilled 15 out of 24 of these shorts have never been released on DVD before. On another note I was looking at the remaining 8 years I don't think sony will release volume 9 (58-59) which would have only 8 shorts. So the question is do they break their 3 year cycle (probably) or give us a break and cram everything into 2 sets. If Volume 7 is 52 through 1st half of 55 (26 shorts) and volume 8 2nd half of 55-59 (28 shorts) its not so unreasonable. However I think sony will probably figure out a way to break this thing into 3 sets and really go nuts on the years. Id be curious what you guys think on this please leave a comment for me thanks.,1239926400,,714,4.0

I love Shemp and I cannot wait for the other sets or this one for that matter! Long live The Six Stooges (Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp, Joe,and Curly Joe)!",1239408000,,289,4.178571428571429
1197546,5,B000009DTN,"Anyone who thinks Shemp was not a fine comedian in his own right is probably basing this on the weaker Shemp comedies of 1954 & 1955 (Cuckoo On A Choo Choo).  And if they were not weak new stories, they were re-issuing an old short with a few minutes of new footage.

But this set will contain Shemps best work.  The writers as well as the Stooges were ready to keep the series going with Shemp's different comic abilities.  What really makes these work is that Shemp did not try to be Curly (like some of the other third stooge replacements), Shemp was allowed to be himself.  And he added a new set of signature routines.  How many of us would do a fake snore with the ""Bee Bee Bee Bee"" sound at the end.  That was a Shemp thing, not Curly.

And since Shemp was the original third Stooge in the Ted Healy days, we are really looking at the original Three Stooges act!

I do find it interesting watching these in original release order, it is obvious that Columbia put some on the shelf while releasing others.  For example: 1950's DOPEY DICKS & LOVE AT FIRST BIGHT clearly have title styles pre-dating 1949's VAGABOND LOAFERS as well as having 1949 copyright notices.  They were obviously held back while VAGABOND LOAFERS, DUNKED IN THE DEEP, PUNCHY COWPUNCHERS & HUGS AND MUGS got released.

Holding back releases was not unusual and it got more common in the later 1950's.  Consider that Shemp died in 1955, but his shorts continued to be released in 1956 (not counting the shorts that Joe Palma impersonated Shemp in long shots).",1239235200,,1534,4.5144927536231885
1197547,5,B000009DTN,"Sony has been doing The Three Stooges proud in its continuing series of restored and remastered DVD editions. Volume 6 is highly recommended for comedy fans and a must for Stoogeheads. Many of the 1949-51 films benefit from witty scripts and direction, and are exceptionally funny.

The best shorts here were produced by Hugh McCollum and directed by Edward Bernds, who soft-pedaled the gratuitous roughhouse and allowed Shemp, Larry, and Moe to improvise freely. This brings new freshness to the standard slapstick format, and shows how professional and resourceful Howard, Fine, and Howard were. (You'll see many amusing instances when a scene is supposed to be over, but Bernds keeps the camera rolling to see what the Stooges will do.) The films also benefit from Columbia's resident stock company of the late 1940s: the lovely Christine McIntyre and Jean Willes, both equally adept at playing sincere heroines and crafty schemers; the suave Kenneth MacDonald, a definitive villain; the versatile Emil Sitka, appearing here in any number of guises; veteran comic Vernon Dent, playing the Stooges' foil with his usual authority; expressive comedian Dudley Dickerson (""This house has sho' goan crazy!""), and the superlative stuntman Jock Mahoney. It isn't easy to steal an entire film from the Stooges, but watch Mahoney in the clever PUNCHY COWPUNCHERS; you'll roar as he indulges in some athletic and hilariously clumsy slapstick.

Many of the Stooges' best-remembered scenes are included in this set: the pie fight, the spooky old houses inhabited by gangsters or mad scientists, the ""plumbers"" routine, ""the window ledge,"" ""the cats in the piano,"" ""the talking suit of armor,"" ""the feathers in the cake,"" the Santa Claus masquerade, the ""dance instructors,"" the trio singing at least two variations of ""Just Plain Jane,"" the Stooges playing themselves AND their own girlfriends... and the gags just keep on coming! There is so much quality material in these films that producer-director Jules White consulted them frequently in the 1950s, borrowing entire sequences and sometimes the complete storylines for later Stooge shorts.

Be advised that a few of the shorts will stop at nothing for a cheap laugh, thanks to the heavy hand of director Jules White. MALICE IN THE PALACE has some unfortunate stereotypical humor and a tasteless gag involving a meat cleaver. In BABY SITTERS' JITTERS White shows a toddler endangered by both the Stooges and by a loaded gun. But such lapses are rare in this set; most of the material is a joy for Stooge fans.

This DVD set should surpass Columbia's former VHS releases, which weren't as comprehensive, and occasionally were technically inferior (at least three titles derived from 16mm prints). The recent DVD volumes have been sparkling, and Volume 6 should be no exception.",1239148800,,2820,5.204845814977974

These shorts are from the era when the Stooges were comprised of Larry, Moe, and Shemp. These are the probably the last of the great Stooges shorts. With television encroaching upon the motion picture industry, cost cutting measures were soon underway. One such measure taken at Columbia that had already impacted MGM and other studios was the decrease in scope of the short-subject department in 1952. Stooge short veterans producer Hugh McCollum and director Edward Bernds were casualties of this action, and this left only Jules White behind as a person in the short subject department with a feel for what made the Stooges special. Shooting schedules were shortened, old Stooge shorts were cut up and recycled into sparse new material, and fans were not fooled by all of this.

Do be aware that the first six volumes of the Three Stooges will be available in June on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges-Collection-Volumes-1-6-Bundle/dp/B0024ML0GU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges Collection, Volumes 1-6 Bundle</a>. This really is not a great buy, but is pretty much on par with what you pay for all six volumes when they are on sale. This might be the way to go if you don't have any of the volumes yet.",1238803200,,1716,5.225454545454546
1197553,4,B000009DTN,"""Disorder in the Court"" is a good early Stooges comedy.  It's also one of the best ""Curlys.""  The boys, working as musicians, are called as witnesses in a murder trial.  The Three Stooges make short  work of the courtroom's stuffy respectability.  The ""Curly on the  witness stand"" segment rivals anything in classic comedy films, from  the Marx Brothers down.  After the bailiff has trouble getting Curly to  understand the oath, the judge tries to explain, ""He asked if you  swear...""  Curly interrupts and replies, ""No, but I know all the  woids!""  Curly's testimony includes so much jive-talking musician  language that the defense attorney instructs him to ""drop the  vernacular.""  The perplexed Curly, looking at the hat he is holding,  says, ""Vernacular?  That's a derby!""  To get around these  problems of semantics, the guys suggest they ""act out"" their  testimony.  Incredibly, the judge agrees, and complete pandemonium  ensues.
The Three Stooges are arguably the greatest representatives of  low comedy in the history of film.  Moe, with his trademark sugar bowl  haircut and his usual cranky demeanor, is the master of the eye-poke and  the face-slap.  Larry, his explosion-in-a-matress-factory hairstyle and his  handog attitude, is mainly caught in the middle between Moe and Curly.  The  rotund Curly, his familiar ""dirty tennis ball"" crewcut, his  ""woo woo"" expressions, and his ""nyuk nyuk"" laugh, has  an otherworldly quality that defies written description.  Curly Howard (a  real example of a clown who laughed through his tears) could very well be  given the ""most under-rated comic genius of the 20th century""  award.
This little video also includes ""Malice in the  Palace,"" a ""Shemp"" episode.  The boys go after the  Rootin'-Tootin' treasure stolen by ""Omigosh, Emir of Shmoe.""  Generally, the Shemp comedies are less effective than the Curly episodes,  but that is admittedly a personal preference issue.  At least Larry has  more to do in the Shemp episodes.  This video can serve as a basic  introduction to the Stooges for anyone visiting from another planet.  It's  also a good place to start the next generation of viewers in the zany world  of Stooge mania.  Even if you have seen these comedies countless times  before, watch the video for a few minutes when you feel tired and cranky,  and enjoy the absolute nonsense.",956016000,,2350,5.1306666666666665
1197554,5,B000009DTN,"""Disorder in the Court"" is the most outrageous court scene you'll ever see. If you have a heart problem, don't forget to have some NTG on hand. The belly laughs could get dangerous. The other three include  perhaps the funniest that Shemp ever did. ""Malice in the Palace""  is one of my favorites, in spite of being without Curly. ""Sing a Song  of Six Pants"" includes a fight scene that is an all time classic -  whirling pants hangers (with real thugs wearing them) that sometimes strike  the good guys, as well as the bad guys. ""The Brideless Groom"" is  the weakest of the four episodes, but the phone booth scene with Shemp and  Moe hopelessly entangled in miles of phone wire is worth seeing.",924393600,,695,4.512
