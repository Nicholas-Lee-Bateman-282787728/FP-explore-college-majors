2672610,3,B000JJRYDS,"This is one disturbing movie. The whole movie isn't that way, but when the lions kill, that's when the chills and thrills come out full throttle. The very first kill was the most unsetteling to me. It came almost out of no where but it was all set up to happen.

A stepmother, two bratty children, and a guide go on a safarri expedition while the father is at work. Since this movie is about the survival of the family, it should be no surprise that the guide is the first person to face his mortality... and it truly is a shame. Simply put, he died so a kid could go #2. And his death sequence was beyond mortifying to me. It seriously had me freaking out... as it was HIGHLY intense.

After his death, the stepmother and the kids are stranded and hopeful that the husband will come out in search of them while they stay in the car. Unfortunately, that is the only smart thing they do through the movie... as tension between the kids and their new stepmother boils over at the most inopprotune of moments. The lions are freaky... but when they are taken out by various ""would be rescuers"" it is so obviously fake (which... is ok cause I wouldn't want real lions to die for a campy film like this) and the action to be seen is when the lions are stalking.

Although intense, this film is sadly bogged downward by the poor acting. Only two people offered intersting characters... and wouldn't you know it... their fates are pretty much sealed from the get go. All of the main characters are either overplaying it or just phoning it in. But... do not despair... this is not a film that is meant to impress with solid acting chops. This is one for the survival film buffs... mother nature takes a lethal swipe at mankind in this thriller. It isn't unique or fresh... but it is pretty thrilling.",1170115200,4,1791,4.38855421686747

2672644,5,B000JJRYDS,"I took a chance with this movie in spite of the bad reviews, mostly because those reviews seemed more over the top than the movie itself could possibly be. Also, there were good reviews. In my experience, a movie with good reviews alongside scathing ones is generally a good bet. You can toss out the scathing ones. I mean, if some people hate a movie so much, it must have something going for it that they don't like. ""Prey"" is a prime example of this, and after seeing the film I'm disgusted by the bad reviews. Ridiculous, really. I shake my head. What is wrong with these folks? Goes to show, you absolutely cannot depend on user reviews. Read the synopsis and technical specs instead.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will watch it again many times I'm sure. And believe me, I can be very critical of ""bombs."" But as stated, this is not a bomb. It's a buried gem, taking into consideration that it isn't a Hollywood blockbuster Academy Award candidate; nor, I'm sure, was it ever intended to be. It's just good entertainment.

I'd like to counter some of the irrational criticisms in the bad reviews gathered here.

First of all, the acting is good across the board. Specifically, the young actor referred to by one negatively biased reviewer as ""some boy"" was by no means ""awful."" In fact, he was pretty good at portraying a modern day tween caught up in an exciting, though admittedly terrifying, experience. I give him 4/5 stars. The rest of the actors were also quite adequate in their parts, even good at times. 'Nuf said about the acting.

The story is well written if you're not looking for Citizen Kane, or more to the point, Cujo. The directing? I don't know, that's hard to tell sometimes. In any event, it wasn't noticeable, which I guess is a compliment, given that bad directing can be obvious and ruin an otherwise good flick. The story here flows smoothly and held my attention without complaint.

The tension between the new wife and the husband's teen daughter was *not* overdone. The daughter was *not* unnaturally annoying, and did *not* need to be fed to the lions as some have suggested. The trapped women did *not* scream too much. The boy did *not* ask for water and food too much (actually, only a few times). The new wife, when she got the keys, in fact drove wildly into the bush and crashed the Range Rover, but she was obviously too panicked and disoriented to be making calm, rational, thoughtful decisions at the time.

Bottom line: I liked the family. They can visit me anytime.

I have no idea how real lions would behave, and in the case of this movie I really don't care. Others can nitpick about that and other details. They looked real enough and dangerous enough to me. And speaking of lions (and scenery), the color photography is beautiful, especially in Blu-ray. There admittedly is more gore than necessary. The movie is listed as NOT RATED, but I imagine because of all the blood it would be rated PG or PG13 depending on who rated it. I would probably rate it PG11, or maybe PG10 but up to the discretion of the parents. Feminists will love the wife's heroism. She screamed, but when the chips were down she snapped out of it, even though there was no one there to slap her silly.

his share of dangerous mistakes such as exchanging
rifles without testing the one he took. What makes all the difference in the quality of this drama is how the script handles these terrific mistakes.

competent woman such as the radio ranger (played so well by a white Zimbabwean actress,) the movie
would have become a classic. Just like Ghost And The Darkness or Jurassic Park.",1308528000,,682,4.930434782608696

2672686,3,B000JJRYDS,"Hoping to form a bond between his two young children and his new bride, engineer Tom Newman (Peter Weller) takes his kids - teenage daughter Jessica (Carly Schroeder) and young son David (Connor Dowds) - and his new bride Amy (Bridget Moynahan) on an African safari.  While off-roading with the tour guide in a zebra-painted safari truck, the bumpy terrain dislodges some of the warthog from the previous night's meal causing David's IBS to flair up.  The tour guide decides it's a good decision to let 65lb David drop a deuce in the bush nearly 50 yards from the truck in the middle of lion country.  Yeah, because lions don't single out the weak for their prey.  Either it's the tour guide's first day or he's retarded, but things don't go as he plans.  What follows is nothing more than Cujo on steroids, as Jessica and the kids struggle to survive, with predictable and boring step-mamma-drama, while Tom employs the help of a local hunter, Crawford (Jamie Bartlett).

First and foremost, if you're looking for a man vs. lion movie, it's called The Ghost and the Darkness.  That is not up for debate.

Since this probably falls in the horror genre, I suppose we should get the following out of the way: cell phones don't work, moronic choices abound, no nudity, and Jessica can't drive...but that's mainly because women can't drive.  I digress.  Suffice to say, the movie loses incredible steam because the tension between step-mother and daughter is tedious, the little boy nearly gets heat stroke after one wittle day in the hot sun, and the only interesting characters get little screen time (except when Crawford is massaging and smelling a clump of lion scat in his left hand for an obscene amount of time).

It's not a bad film, but there aren't a lot of aspects that standout.  The few that did are Lion-Vision(tm), the lion-kebab, and the ""African Picnic.""

As far as movies about lions killing humans, it's second best.  Out of two movies.  And it's not close.

2672689,4,B000JJRYDS,"Don't expect a quality suspense with this one.  Just... don't, haha.

Expect one of the most predictable storylines you can imagine.  Two kids and their stepmom are trapped inside a car somewhere in Africa because three lions just will NOT leave them alone.

Every time they try to leave the car the lions are waiting in the weeds for them.  Do lions *really* treat people this way?  I don't think so.  I think in real life they don't even care about humans unless they feel like they're being threatened.

The poor little boy had to spend two whole nights without getting the chance to use the bathroom!  Feel for him.

In one spot, the driver of the car actually took his keys with him while taking the little boy to the bathroom, so an unnecessary search for the keys had to take place after the driver was killed graphically.  D'oh!

I can't remember why the father didn't tag along for the ride, but it doesn't matter.

The three people trapped in the car try the most predictable means of chasing away the lions, but none of them work.  What a clumsy driver the stepmom is too.  VERY clumsy.  Silly girl.  You're not supposed to drive between trees and over cliffs- you're supposed to stay on the dirt road.  We even have dirt roads in America!  She should have known what dirt roads look like.

Anyway, the stepmom and the daughter HATE each other.  The daughter constantly finds ways to criticize anything she doesn't like about the woman.  She really needed to grow up though.  Seriously, we all act that way towards our step parents (even *I* do it sometimes -as an adult- and feel embarrassed about it later) but this girl was *really* hard on her stepmom.  She was just trying her best to please and protect the kids.  Completely unfair.

I don't think she was technically a stepmom- more like the girls father's girlfriend by that point.

Anyway, the father eventually finds an Australian man who doesn't even WANT to help the poor guy find his family.  He changes his mind when there's talk of giving him anything he wants though.  That always helps.

Predictable storyline, and a surprising amount of blood.  That's what this film is all about.  A good rental.",1267747200,2,2175,4.597911227154047

Peter Weller (Robocop!) is an engineer in Africa, he takes his new wife and kids to Africa, and lets them go on a Safari to see wild animals, the youngest one, the Boy needs to take a dump, so the tour guide stops and allows to boy to take a Sh...t.  Then some lions come out of the field, they freak-out, and basically get their tour guide killed.  And they are safe in their car.  After seeing him get violently killed, they whine about really stupid unrelated stuff (Unless all three of them are complete sociopaths, How can they kid around about being hungry after seeing another human being violently killed right in front of them ""When we get back I want a triple hamburger!"" only minutes after the blood bath)

They get keys, of course the lion tries to get them. They drive around, crash their car, and the lions are at it again.  They get out of their car to look around, when they are nearly killed by a lion, but the feline is shot dead by two African hunters.  The hunter help them get water.  One of the hunters is killed by a lion, the other runs off.

Later, the other hunter comes back, he is killed.

Robocop hires a tracker to find them,  They eventually locate the idiot family.  Which the tracker is violently killed. Then the lion comes after robocop, robocop hides under the car, the kids and robocop get away, hide in a tree, while the mother turns the car into a big Molotov cocktail, killing the lion.  Thee end!

2672693,3,B000JJRYDS,"Tom Newman (Peter Weller) brings his two children and his new, younger wife, Amy (Bridget Moynahan) to Africa to spend some time with them while he's working on an African dam project.  His daughter, Jessica (Carly Schroeder), is upset about her parents' divorce, and wants nothing to do with Amy.  Hoping to form a bond between them, Newman suggests that his daughter and new wife, along with his son, David (Connor Dowds), take a ride through a game reserve on their way to the lodge where they will spend the rest of their vacation while he finishes up on some work.

While touring the reserve, young David needs to use the bathroom.  The guide and David leave the safety of the SUV they are riding in so that David can do a little ""paper work"" in the bush.  With the tour guide protecting him with a rifle, David commences to relieve himself.  Unfortunately for the group, though, David's moving problem has them stopped in the middle of a group of starving lions.  The lions make an attempt on catching David, but the guide manages to hold them off long enough for the young boy to make it back to the truck.  The guide isn't so lucky and is violently killed by the beasts.  This leaves Amy, Jessica, and David alone to swelter in the African heat and do their best in order to survive until someone can find them.

Meanwhile, Tom has made it to the lodge and immediately tries to start a search and rescue mission.  Unfortunately the rangers at the lodge can't assist him until daylight.  He's put into contact with a local hunter/tracker named Crawford (Jamie Bartlett) who refuses to help Tom at first, but eventually gives in when a payment is offered for his services.

From here, the film bounces from extremely tense (and well-played) moments where the lions attempt to get their paws on the Newman clan to long and drawn out moments of dialogue primarily between Amy and Jessica.  In an attempt to keep the story interesting, the three primary players are put into situations ranging from trying to make an escape in the vehicle once they find the keys to making friends with poachers.

The film struggled to hold my interest during its run.  It quickly became a victim of its own devices.  There have been many better films made where the bulk of the action centers on a small group of individuals in an isolated situation as is the case in ""Prey.""  ""The Descent"" and ""Jaws"" immediately come to mind.  However, in ""Prey,"" having the group pinned down in a vehicle and making a number of risky and, in at least one situation, ridiculous choices does nothing to keep the story interesting.

The primary subplot of the film, the friction between Amy and Jessica, is instantly predictable and offers nothing to add to the film.

The cast doesn't do a terrible job.  Moynahan is sufficient as the stepmother who takes on the task of being a hero while stranded in the bush.  Weller doesn't have much to do in this film except become angry for a bit and then desperate to save his family.  The children are okay, but both of them visit the overacting department a bit too often for my tastes.  If I had to pick out one shining star in the film, I'd have to say it was Jamie Bartlett.  His character is about the most interesting thing in the film, and adds a bit of much needed humor to the story as well.

The special effects are dodgy at times.  The CGI blood is ridiculous, and fails to rise above similar effects that can be found on SyFy on Saturday nights.

In summary, ""Prey"" has some wonderful moments that almost make it better than it really is.  In the end, however, it is nothing more than a B-movie that doesn't even fall into the ""so terrible it's funny"" category.  Recommended to fans of SyFy channel flicks or films such as ""Open Water.""",1252540800,7,3761,4.535608308605341
2672694,3,B000JJRYDS,"""Prey"" is a horror film that runs straight down the middle.  It borrows elements from other films, doesn't take any chances, but delivers some solid suspense, violence, and scares.  Horror veterans won't see anything they haven't seen before done better, but I think casual fans looking for a thrill will find it here.  This may not be saying much, but it's the second best killer lion flick I've ever seen.

The story is this: two kids go on a safari with their new stepmom, guide goes offroad, kid has to go to the bathroom, lions eat the incompetent guide, guide had the keys to the landrover, now they're screwed.  But isn't that similar to an episode of ""The Simpsons""?  Yes.  Yes it is.  Thanks for noticing.  And isn't being trapped in a vehicle with kids in an isolated area with no supplies and a murderous beast stalking you the plot to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cujo/dp/B000T5O48U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cujo</a>?  Mmm-hmmm.  And after<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ghost-and-the-Darkness/dp/6305181926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ghost and the Darkness</a>&nbsp;don't you think they've pretty much done what they can do with a movie about killer lions?  I'd say so.  But then again, originality has never really been the hallmark of the horror genre.  In fact the lack of new material is the only really large complaint I can level against ""Prey"".  Then again, it is tagged with the annoying ""based on true events"" tag so I guess you can overlook the similarities to other films if you want to.  It's very competently directed and only real lions were used and they were used effectively.  No CG to draw attention to itself or phony puppets to laugh at.  Well done.

Now I have a few minor complaints to log in as well.  First, haven't we seen enough stories about stepmothers bonding with the teenage stepdaughters who hate them?  Also, if I see one more survival horror film where they get the vehicle working and then immediately crash it after they are scot-free I'm going to freak.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eden-Lake/dp/B001G9CNI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eden Lake</a>&nbsp;got away with it, but it still bugs the hell out of me and I'm drawing the line now: NO MORE!  Stupidity is a tenet of horror protagonists for some reason, but I think that particular element has run it's course.  This one pushes it pretty far.  Other then that, I think this flick was pretty realistically done.  I'd also like to thank the director for not having a subplot about not being able to get the cellphones to work.  Seems like every modern survival horror film has to make a huge show of how the cell-phones aren't charged or have them checking for a signal and giving constant reports about having ""no bars"".  It's a movie, I will happily accept that this is a cell-phone free alternate universe if it will save 15 minutes of screen time spent playing with cell phones.  Again, thanks.

Violence, suspense, harrowing horror, stupid protagonists; yup, this is a by-the-numbers fright flick.  But it's worth a look if you have a fear of lions -which admittedly are one of the most intimidating creatures on God's green Earth- or are just looking for something to kill an hour and a half of your time.  If you haven't seen it all, this will likely be a very effective thriller.  It's definitely no ""Ghost and the Darkness"", but it's not half bad for such a low-profile film.  Give it a try.",1249257600,3,3543,5.203180212014134
2672695,1,B000JJRYDS,"OK, I stole the title from a book of the exact same name, which is a great read by a former safari guide, btw, available here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whatever-You-Do-Don-t-Run-True-Tales-of-a-Botswana-Safari-Guide/dp/0762745657/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whatever You Do, Don't Run: True Tales of a Botswana Safari Guide</a>&nbsp;on Amazon.com (both author and vendor are welcome for the free plug), but *ahem*, on with it.

That the stage is set by a boy who doesn't want to crap his pants is ironic in oh so many ways, but, then you have:  Angry step-daughter, stoopid safari guide, frustrated-but-wants-to-be-liked new step-mom, rogue guide (think Jaws' Robert Shaw), millionaire dad.  Evil poachers who only find Bridget Moynihan attractive before she throws on an over sized shirt, after which they lose all interest.  Man-eating apparently lions so sick of the carbon footprint the safari guides leave, they actually stalk the peoplespam jeep as it careens through the brush.

As a dollar-nite movie, the movie is fine as a time-killer.  Lots to make fun of, the requisite amount of blood, and some medium-rate cinemaphotography.  Of course the idea that lions would just keep returning to the jeep after digesting the last throw-away actor is laughable, as is a tour company that can't get a search going from the air.  Seriously, these people would not have been that hard to find.  Trust me on that one.

Alot of lions, and they're hungry!

I found this movie a little too hokey and the violence level somewhat underplayed down to the lion attacks full of CGI sprayed blood and victim shots showing them laying down dead to being dragged off screen by ""something"" each time. Sure, the shots of the wild and the lions themselves look mighty impressive, but I couldn't help that I seen this movie before just with another title.

I have always liked watching these animal gone crazy type films, I don't know what it is about them maybe it's because this stuff really does happen or something, I don't know. But these films have always fascinated me, and even if the film isn't all that great I still give it a chance. This film looks like a great film if you go by cover alone, plus it states that it is inspired by true events which boost interest. Those two things alone have my attention, but it all so hypes the film up. When watched with an open mind it still leaves you with mixed feelings.

Director Darrell Roodt who also co wrote this film with Jeff Wadlow, and Beau Bauman creates a cool little tension filled [at times] movie that is an over all enjoyable film. The story is all about a family and a guide who are attacked by a pack of lions and are stuck off road in a jeep. Of course from here we have a film full of pretty realistic kills and some pretty good thrills. The writers, director, and producers of this film obviously went into this trying to make a really good movie, and on some levels they have truly succeeded. The only real faults within this movie are some of the characters.

Carly Schroeder plays her role very well but it is her character that truly hurts this movie. She plays Jessica Newman who is the most annoying character I think I have ever seen in a film ever. You may be reading that and think that I am exaggerating, but I promise you I am not. You really will be wishing for this teenage girl to literally be thrown to the lions, as bad as that sounds it would have elevated this film to classic status in my mind. Conner Dowds's character is quite the opposite, but the problem here is in the performance. I realize he is just a kid, so to that extent it isn't horrible but other kids have done much better. Bridget Moynahan on the other hand as the step mother of the kids is great in her role, I particularly like when she finally gets on to Carly's character. She plays the role brilliantly and like others have said she does look a little like Sandra Bullock. Peter Weller is just as good as the father who can not be there to help his family. In fact everyone else in the film is very believable [see Jamie] and do a great job with this film.

This film would be perfect for a day you have just laying around the house. I recommend this film to anybody looking for a movie for just a day like that. Good film over all, check it out.",1219795200,,2459,4.225531914893617
2672700,5,B000JJRYDS,"Based on 'actual events' in the 'wild of Africa,' PREY stays true, fast, fun and scary (movies like this are simply made for these reasons alone, and that's O.K. because no one 'preyed upon' was seeking an Academy Award nomination for their performance)...
Though this low-budget thriller lacks a much-needed/memorable score to chase, pace and grace all its action, the film's sweeping and sometimes stunning cinematography compensates and delivers in major ways...
Far more disturbing than JAWS and JURASSIC PARK put together!!! Why??? Because the children are too young to cope with such graphic horror. The family is basically terrorized by the 'Kings of the Jungle' for an hour-and-a-half, with no end in sight - a vaguely similar scenario that played out well for mutants in THE HILLS HAVE EYES...
THE 3 PROS:
1) DRAMA -- Cutie key actress Bridget Moynahan (I, Robot) brings much-needed cohesion to a family of two, fairly well-acted, snot-nosed kids enduring coming-of-age-woes with their father's divorce (a familiar undercurrent, considering how ""close to home"" the real notion hits)...
2) INTENSITY -- 'Slasheresque,' bloody and out-of-no-where lion feasts. I've become bored with the 'old-fashioned' man vs. nature flick plots - Why not have starving lions eating people??? If I was a lion, I'd be mad as hell about poachers and the persistent decimation of my native African land...
3) THRILLS -- From start to finish the plot's truly disturbing. Even though the kids are bratty, watching them witness gruesome violence, at such a blistering pace, hurts and is darn harsh!!! Frankly though, the biggest draw is that the incident happened (I'm not exactly sure when or where, so I'm now forced to conduct research on my own). But this idea immediately gets in your gut, or under your skin, and stays there... In other words, you can walk away from JAWS, JURASSIC PARK, or worse, CUJO, and say, ""Oh, that's a decent piece of fiction."" But you leave stumbling from PREY and you ask yourself, ""My goodness, that happened??? They should have had a Hummer..."" or ""I know I'll think twice before I head out on a Lion Country Safari after absorbing PREY. I don't want to be prey for anything or anybody...""
THE 1 CON:
1) SCORING -- PREY desperately needs a more supportive and suspenseful score overall to carry the tiny moments that may lag and the fragile/tender moments that may drag...
Regardless, see PREY and while you're at it, throw away your CUJO DVD, because PREY is pretty grrrrrrrreat!!!",1191283200,6,2502,5.016826923076923

The ending had to be the worst ending ever!!  They shot one lion, and burned the other one along with the car they were in.  After both lions were killed, the family hugs each other, then start walking.  The dad says ""Come on, let's go home"".  Ok, so even though those two lions are dead, aren't there other lions in the jungle???

This movie is a remake of that one. This movie was not as good, but worth keeping. I actually wanted to give it a 2.5 and rounded down, as it did not deserve to be rounded up. There were several good scenes , but several good scenes cannot make a good movie. Carly Schroeder was good as an angry teen;too good, as a matter of fact. There were not enough lions., even if they did not all attack. There was never a direct attack on person that we saw. The attcks were implied. We either saw the lions or the people in the attacks.
