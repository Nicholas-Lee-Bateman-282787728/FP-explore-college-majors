8576471,1,B00C2BG1B2,DVD is very boring and numbers do not play continuously.  You must select each individual number and each number plays less than a minute.  Very poor.....do not waste your money on this DVD!,1469577600,,190,4.7272727272727275

8576476,5,B00C2BG1B2,I have used this before. After more than 2 years of constant use my originals were worn out. Reordered and even more enjoyable since Heidi added color and counting 10 frames to her program. My young students enjoy the DVD very much and I use it is a good low impact for bad weather days as well.,1389225600,2,295,4.192982456140351
