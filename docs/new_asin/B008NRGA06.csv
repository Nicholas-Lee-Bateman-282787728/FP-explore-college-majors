8529270,1,B008NRGA06,"The subject is good: to try to give more of an insider look behind the real reasons for he collapse of the USSR. As an avid reader of history and especially of political European history of the 20th Century, I bought this aiming to find a complement to my books on these subjects.

Sadly, my books are more visually interesting. Yes, hundreds and hundreds of pages with letters are less extenuating on the eyes than a documentary in video. A film documentary will never be able to cover the same ground and in the same depth as a book, but it has the advantage of adding visual elements to tell a story in a visually informing way. The director of this film doesn't have one idea what makes film, well, film. Proper historicalimages are few and far between, what we get instead is a bunch of old guys talking and talking and talking in very close close-ups in front of the screen about their views on the collapse of the USSR. No energy, no visual elements to attract attention, only men talking and presenting their views without almost any single visual support to make this different from a written set of interviews.

This could well have been a short book if the producer had published all the interviews and it would probably have been more interesting that way (not that the interviewees discover anything new anyway), but as a VISUAL documentary shot for documentary fans, it's a complete disaster. I wasted 20 dollars that I could have used to buy one or two books.

8529271,5,B008NRGA06,"Several key former and/or associated-with American government officials testify in this documentary of the ongoing efforts to revive the communist program across both Russia and the former Soviet republics. These men are backed up by the testimony of former Communist Bloc officials whose deep knowledge of what was (and is) happening inside the so-called ""former"" Communist empire makes one shudder.

Sensationalism and shock value are completely avoided in this documentary. I.E. there are no statements of Russian war plans, statements about secret documents smuggled out of the Eastern Bloc regarding new technologies, et al. There is simply a sober-minded analysis that the Communist Party and Bloc publicly abandoned the longheld ideological roots of Marx and Lenin (again, that is publicly) in favor of a longterm strategic program to put the West to sleep so that it would lower its guard, and that, behind the scenes, the Communist Bloc might make a resurgence over the course of many years.

Further, the notion that the whole collapse of Communism in 1991 was part of that same strategic deception is analyzed.

This whole idea does in fact seem hard to believe. However, the further research and testimony of former mid and high-level Communist officials appears to back up the statements of men like Vladimir Bukovsky, the late Petr Cibulka, Oleg Gordievsky, and others.

This documentary is worth a serious view - several times - backed up by further independent research on the viewer's end. What it has to say about the real strategic state of the world may be shocking for most, but could help draw the West - and America in particular - out of its complaceny regarding the continuing movements toward creating a new union that may be, ultimately, designed to take the place of the old Soviet one.",1365465600,2,1814,5.077181208053691
