8707928,5,B00URMQCKS,"I watched this series when I was younger and thought my 4 yr old granddaughter might enjoy it as she was becoming interested in super heroes and especially Wonder Woman. Not only did she enjoy it, but the whole family enjoyed watching it as well.",1520208000,,246,4.488888888888889
8707929,1,B00URMQCKS,"Do not purchase these unless you want to buy glasses afterward.  This edition is a horrible transfer.  Go with the previous releases, not this one with SKU 883929586943.  This watered down crap should never have been released.  You definitely get what you pay for.  Again, THIS VERSION IS HORRIBLE.

*This review is solely for the disc quality, not the show.  Five stars for the show.",1519776000,,384,4.815384615384615

8707931,1,B00URMQCKS,I bought these DVDs on Ebay and the picture quality of the DVDs is awful. The first four episodes from the first season are included in one DVD including additional features. I don't recommend these DVDs if you're looking for picture quality.,1499040000,3,242,4.785714285714286
