6818583,2,B00PMCYZ1G,To make simple the movie was poor. When I saw the preview it seemed it was a thriller also action. To understand the movie it took a long time in the middle of the film I had an idea.,1421193600,,183,3.717948717948718
6818584,1,B00PMCYZ1G,So horrible.  Obviously this was a cheap nods to 50 Shades which is fine but it is slow to develop and also leads nowhere.  We see plenty of boobs but no passion or sizzle and it just left me feeling like I watched an accomplished woman turned into an object and not in any sexy way.,1421020800,10,283,4.035714285714286
6818585,3,B00PMCYZ1G,"This movie is such a sham, an attempted rip-off of the ""50 Shades of Grey"" movie. I hope ""50 Shades"" is much better than this movie, I'm looking forward to 50 this February.",1421020800,2,173,4.2727272727272725

6818608,1,B00PMCYZ1G,"One of the most boring/hokey movies ever! If there is a rating lower than B movie...then that's what it should be. If it wasn't for the attractiveness of the two of them...I wouldn't have even watched it past 5 minutes, in hindsight. I actually felt uncomfortable watching it because it seemed so stiff and uncomfortable on her part. It had nothing to do with the content (bdsm)...but whoever wrote this should never admit it and I think the actors realized it. One of a few movies ever that's been so awful that I had to shut it off before I even got anywhere near the end. She must be so embarrassed. At least when I've had to do things out of desperation for money it's not recorded in history for all to watch (beside the pawnshop camera...haha).",1529193600,,750,4.481751824817518

6818611,3,B00PMCYZ1G,"Only  3 stars because of Charisma. She is so beautiful and a great actress. I agree with others that the story line is weak and it was a bit boring. Charisma and the Baldwin brother are mainly the only 2 actors in this movie that can act. The actor that plays ""Ryan"" (the Dominant) can not act, he was nice to look at but even that at times wasn't enough. He made everything awkward and his lines sounded cheesy, lifeless. Only giving it 3 stars because I kept watching for Charisma and the little plot twist on how ""Ryan"" messes with Charisma character's life.",1528934400,2,561,4.394230769230769

But... I can't. I didn't get very far but it just seemed like nothing but softcore porn to me. That's great and all, but not what I was looking for. The story didn't capture my interest. Maybe it gets better, but this seems like a waste of her talent.",1528416000,,304,4.241379310344827

It doesn't belong on Amazon where my kids can watch it. I couldn't watch it all the way through, but it's discusting fetish. A guy meets a girl, doesn't know her at all, and proceeds to kiss her everywhere but the lips. Then moves into sex, and tells her who she is. It's not about a woman being set free and gaining control. It's about a man finding her attractive and seducing her and breaking down who she is. This would never make a woman feel better about herself and who she is as a person.

6818630,5,B00PMCYZ1G,"""Can I Spank You?"" -- just hearing those four words spoken in a low sexy voice by the always-hot Charisma Carpenter is enough to set many a man's pulse -- and more than a few women's -- faster.  It certainly did mine.  She plays a Milfy fortyish mother who is a daughter of a once powerful real estate investor played by a harassed-looking Daniel Baldwin, who is now just looking to sell the firm.  She disagrees and tries to keep it alive, but is distracted by a young man, play by an underfed Bryce Draper, whose character, Ryan Black, is viewed by many in the LA BDSM community in the movie as a predator.

What I like.  I like some of the plot twists.  I like the movie's positive attitude toward the SSC BDSM Community.  I like Morgan Obenreder, who plays the daughter.  I like everything about Ms. Carpenter.

What I do not like.  Production values.  Get Mr. Baldwin a suit that fits, and a haircut befitting an investment executive.  Acting: Bryce Draper, show some charisma (pun intended) and look like you're having fun.  He looks like he's just been voted off the island.  I mean getting to tie up women, and spanking Ms. Carpenter's adorably tushy.  I'd be having such a blast they couldn't wipe the grin off my face, but then I'm a writer who is addicted to spanking, not an actor who is getting paid to pretend he's into spanking, BDSM, and dominating women.

Still, those are quibbles.  For anyone who enjoys Erotica Romance that involves spanking and BDSM this movie will reward you.  As for me I do not know what I liked more -- seeing Ms. Carpenter's delightful tush spanked, or watching her wearing a bustier and wielding a riding crop against a bound man in a BDSM Club.",1528243200,2,1689,4.5

Not very likely that she'd have been in the business position she was in, considering her weak character to begin with.

From the outset, we see a woman who is sexually in need of an appropriate partner. After having sex with someone she obviously just picked up, she requires a vibrator to fulfill and complete the job. Later, when her daughter comes home from school she asks what's for dinner. Mom hasn't cooked anything and so they go out to an upscale restaurant.  Mind you, CC lives in a most opulent home that is absolutely palatial (8 figures worth at least) and yet has absolutely no domestic help that we are aware of in the entire movie. This of course gives the frustrated CC an opportunity to be observed by Ryan Black (played by the handsome Bryce Draper; NB: his last name) who finds a way to make contact and then lure CC into a number of sexual encounters.  His unorthodox approach (i.e., BDSM) is just what the Dr. called for. Unfortunately, her new found sexual satisfaction interferes with her business acumen and brings on a serious rebuke from her father. How to deal with both worlds is now a major problem totally involving both sides of her persona. As she sinks deeper and deeper into the abyss of BDSM, the disorientation it creates becomes a highly negative factor. Will painful sexual pleasure win out over common sense and intellectual business savy or will some kind of compromise be achieved?  These are key questions. Meanwhile, Mr. Black has managed to make himself quite annoying to anyone he meets and inserts himself into places he does not belong. After awhile, when the newfound sexual activity begins to lose some of its initial impact, CC begins to do some research online regarding the activity of a dominatrix.  She also buys new appropriate clothing and visits a ""dominatrix brothel"" in order to gain some pointers. CC asks RB if he would be willing to be submissive and would he be willing to be spanked (he did that to her earlier).  His response was absolutely not! (The writer(s) and director may have missed a golden opportunity here to introduce a new erotic twist to the mix and bring this film above the ""vanilla level"" - just a thought.)  In any event, as things progress, CC comes upon an incident which becomes a game changer (NO Spoilers here).  From then on, she gains in personal confidence and a sense of empowerment she never knew she had. This self discovery enables her to reach new heights in her personal and professional life all of which leads to a MOST SATISFYING conclusion.  (A final couple of observations: How come CC wasn't able to find out more about RB on her own with all the resources at her disposal?  How come RB always seems to be wearing the same clothes (a far cry from Mr. Grey)?  How come RB appears to be living in a one-room brick enclosed structure without so much as a kitchen or bathroom?  What does CC's father live in (his domicile is never seen)? And, once again, how is it that one can live in a splendiferous mansion without so much as a cook, butler, or someone to answer the door? And why am I asking these silly questions.  After all, it is only a movie.  Hey, be careful with that whip!)  F-Bomb, mild nudity, and various levels of ""soft core"" BDSM. No animals were hurt in the making of this film",1437091200,7,3500,4.5792

6818835,3,B00PMCYZ1G,"Okay this one is hard to rate for me. Why, because even though it won't win any acting or writing awards. I wanted to like this film because of Charisma Carpenter. The ex Buffy star.
 The movie was just okay,nothing special. But I'm still going to say that I liked it okay and overall for the Amazon price. I'm happy enough with the purchase and if you just wan't to see Charisma you get your money's worth. I say that not because of the nudity in the film,but because she is in almost all the scenes in the movie. Yes she is nude in a few scenes but nothing to graphic and that is probably the biggest reason. I'm only rating this a 3 star. No I did not expect any adult scenes in the movie or much nudity. But if you are a fan of this type of kink, you might feel like you're missing something in this movie. The scenes were a bit short and quick without the proper setup. I just thought it was missing something.
Adult fans I might recommend ""The Seduction of Emma Marx"" with Penny Pax, yes it's for Adult audiences. But it does this aspect much better and the acting is probably much better,thank's to Penny Pax",1433289600,,1115,4.210280373831775

I know nothing about the life-style,

Still don't.

Hoped to get a sense of what what she experienced when engaged in this sort of sexual play back in her day.

Still don't have much of a sense of what she went through, but I don't care anymore.

But have a hard time imagining my friend behaving that naughty.

I will say of the atress who plays the female protagonist: has a wonderful pair of breasts...as does my female friend as well. And I think her, the actress' character is believable. Both her and her body have charisma.

The actor playing the male antagonist does a fairly decent job, interesting at least. Wonder if there are guys like him out there. Imagine there is. For sure I am not one.

6818853,2,B00PMCYZ1G,"Oh my...I recently stumbled upon this film...and I almost can't believe it. It is very sad to see that Charisma Carpenter's career has come to this. I've been a fan of her's since the Buffy & Angel days, and while her onscreen career has never exactly taken her to the Hollywood heights of fame and fortune, this is just depressing. This film is genuinely just a step or two away from a softcore porn flick...well, maybe only one step. Charisma is way better than this. At 44 she is still a stunner, and while she's obviously had some work done(boob job...possibly not the first one), she really shouldn't have to resort to this type of role this late in her career...should she? Or maybe, in that vile town known as Hollywood, this was inevitable.  Too bad. And it isn't just the nudity that is problematic(Carpenter has posed nude before after all), but it's how it is portrayed. She looks, for the most part, painfully uncomfortable in the sex scenes(which given Charisma's ample charms really aren't very sexy) to be honest - the focus is also rather gratuitously on Carpenter's enhanced breasts, and little else, for the most part. If you are going to take a role like this, at least make it worthwhile - use all that sex-appeal and don't hold back. Though to be fair, that responsibility is ultimately on the writer, director, etc. as well.

As others have made clear, this is merely a blatant attempt to capitalize on the ""50-Shades"" fad, and one that, despite it being no mean feat, is actually worse than the actual 50-Shades evidently was! This is late-night Playboy Channel or similar fare at best.

In an ideal world this would be a mini-series then it wouldn't be so rushed which could allow the story to develop naturally because that's the BIG flaw with this. The timescale is too compressed which makes 'Michelle's' 180 degree changes of emotion and attitudes unbelievable. What happens, happens too quickly; FARGO and BREAKING BAD both perfectly showed how people can become someone else which is the point of this story. Trying to do this in just 90 minutes is a tad silly and neither does it allow for any humour, which we is also lacking.
After investing 90 minutes watching this you don't feel you have wasted your time, just a little frustrated because it is easy to see that this could have been so much better. Danny Baldwin seemingly was just passing the studio when someone asked him if he'd mind reading a few lines and sitting at a big table. The characters of the ex and the daughter could be explored but they're left one dimensional. Charisma Carpenter has to carry the whole movie herself and as good as she is, it's an impossible task. Because you are actually entertained and drawn into this absurd story is testament to Charisma Carpenter's good acting, personality and let's not deny it, her stunningly gorgeous looks so let's hope she gets the better roles she deserves soon.",1424563200,,1447,4.723320158102767

It's not even as erotic as most late night cable shows and the acting was a real disappointment.  I think most people are watching only to see Charisma Carpenter nude and if so it's only for a few quick minutes.  To put the story in a nutshell,  Michelle has a bad bdsm experience with a guy who turns out to be a real jerk and predator who then goes after her teenage daughter.  She gets her revenge against him and uses her new found powers to become a superhero mistress and turn her families real estate business around.

The story ultimately boils down to Charisma Carpenter's character becoming a strong and confident woman through discovering bondage.  However the writing was so bad, and her chemistry with Bryce Draper so nonexistent even the sex scenes did not end up steamy.  Seeing Carpenter (who is in pretty phenomenal shape for being in her upper 40s) nude is really the best part of it.  Of course what can you expect from a movie that co-stars Daniel Baldwin and gives Terrel Owens more than one line?

The sad part is anyone who has ever watched Buffy or Angel knows that Carpenter has some acting chops, and although she has aged is still gorgeous.

He is into bondage and Michelle becomes ""bound"" to him and sex. Hence the clever title. She also has a daughter (Morgan Obenreder) who is ready for college.

This is a great film for fans of soft core porno and Charisma Carpenter. The plot was stagnant and the action centered around sex. The acting and dialogue were soft core quality, i.e. not good.

I wouldn't call it ""porn"" - it's about sex, after all - that's kind of a big part of the story.  The story is a nice idea - woman conquers her fears in the bedroom during an exploration of some kinky stuff, and therefore learns something about her own power.  As someone who experienced something kind of similar, I totally get that.  This isn't a film about sex at all really (so people who are shrieking that it wasn't sexy enough need to just stop). It was about dealing with the difficult parts in life - like other people pushing you around and not quite knowing how to confront that - both in yourself (why do you allow it?) and in them. As a professional writer and editor, I liked the story. It was a bit simplistic, but it worked.  It's a B-movie, a bit amateurish.
