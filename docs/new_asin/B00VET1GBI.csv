Pretty much the only redeeming factor is the naked chicks, and there are plenty of them to keep your interest, but then again, if you only want that, get a porno.  The gore/violence/horror element is almost non-existent.  Not worth a purchase.",1432771200,6,272,4.869565217391305
7087835,4,B00VET1GBI,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Director Jess Francos VAMPYROS LESBOS has been dubbed by some as the Holy Grail of cult cinema.  I had heard of the film several times over the years, but I never found a copy to give a look.  When I heard Severin Films was remastering the film and releasing it on Blu-ray, I immediately put it on my To Find list.  Thankfully, the fine folks at Severin saw fit to grace me with a review copy, and Im so glad they did.  This film epitomizes Francos legacy of exploitation and Eurotrash flicks.  If you are a fan of these genres, then this film is a must-have for your collection.

Before I continue, I have to confirm the title:  yes, it is translated as Lesbian Vampires.  Not very controversial by todays standards, but look at the time period in which the film was made.  Homosexuality was not as accepted back then as it is today, therefore the title alone was enough to send people into a fury about this film.

VAMPYROS LESBOS is shot fairly well, however you almost have to be an existing fan of Francos work to enjoy much of it.  I say this because the film is Francos first venture into his own style of cinematography.  There are many odd shots of abstract things which (if you look closely) do fit with the film.  Theres even some symbolism in regard to what he shows onscreen.

With that being said, this is not really a horror flick.  Its meant to be (I think), but theres no scares and, if Im being honest, the blood looks horrible, like someone popped a ketchup packet somewhere.  Still, the film is very entertaining and held my attention the entire time.

The acting in VAMPYROS LESBOS is so-so, but people don't generally watch exploitation flicks like this for the performances.  The beautiful and sensuous Soledad Miranda is always welcome onscreen, and she revels in this portrayal of Draculas lover.  Ewa Stromberg and the rest of the cast do ok for the most part, however their cardboard characters are part of what makes the film so fun.

VAMPYROS LESBOS is a win for me, and I recommend ithowever it won't be a film for everyone.  Connoisseurs of Francos work will definitely want to snatch this version up; the HD transfer for the Blu-ray looks amazing, and the sound quality is great as well.  In addition to the high quality picture and sound, this two-disc Special Limited Collectors Edition includes a variety of Special Features. This film hits store shelves next Tuesday, so make a note.",1431043200,32,2492,4.563063063063063

7087838,5,B00VET1GBI,"You want more Jess Franco on Blu Ray? Well the fine folks at Severin Films have got you covered. One of the best known and most adored films from Mr. Franco, Vampyros Lesbos is a film I have wanted to check out for a long time but never got around to it. I had even bought a copy of one of the older DVD's that, due to the busy life of a procrastinator, I never got around to watching. So when the new Blu Ray came out I finally made it a point to check this film out. And, as with any Franco film, I made the right choice.

Vampyros Lesbos stars Franco regular Ewa Strmberg as Linda Westinghouse, a woman who works at a law firm. She is sent to a remote island inhabited by Countess Nadine Corody (the inimitable Soledad Miranda, billed again as Susann Korda) regarding an inheritance left to the Countess by some dude named Count something or other. Oh yeah, Dracula. Anyway, when Linda arrives, she recognizes the Countess as a woman that has been plaguing her erotic dreams. Things get steamy, the Countess drinks Linda's blood and then Linda blacks out and ends up in a nuthouse, which is run by vampire expert Dr. Seward (Dennis Price). Will Linda, her boyfriend Omar and Seward be able to break the Countess's spell over Linda?

Vampyros Lesbos is another classic Jess Franco film, chock full of nudity, blood and insanity. Just when the film starts to feel like a regular film (plot wise), the whole thing turns on its head and goes a completely different direction. This gives Vampyros Lesbos the feeling of a fever dream, which is something Franco seems to excel at. Strange images, imaginative camerawork and loads of eroticism no doubt give this film the cult following it so rightfully deserves. Not to mention a great, funky soundtrack from Manfred Hbler and Siegfried Schwab, from which the song The Lions and the Cucumber from this film was even used in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown. Much stranger and cerebral than She Killed in Ecstasy, but no less brilliant, Vampyros Lesbos is a must for exploitation and weird film lovers. Severin's new Blu Ray/DVD combo features a crystal clear transfer and some great bonus features (including a ""bootleg"" Spanish cut of the film titled Las Vampiras). Here are a full list of bonus features:

Disc 1 (Blu-Ray):

7087840,5,B00VET1GBI,"Vampyros Lesbos is the Citizen Kane of lesbian vampire films. Jess Franco's surreal and unique take on Bram Stoker's Dracula is nothing short of a masterpiece. Franco dispenses with gothic trappings like rotting castles and graveyards and films most of it in a ultra schmancy modern villa alongside what I assume to be the Mediterranean Sea. Franco trains his eye on the surroundings as often as the cast and prefers daylight to darkness. The vampire here is the incredibly stunning beauty Soledad Miranda. Franco's camera worships Soledad and you will too after viewing this film. Certain vampire conventions are thrown out the window. Obviously lesbian vampires can't frolic naked on the beach if they can't go in the sun. Oh and the soundtrack by Manfred Hbler and Siegfried Schwab is also the perfect Sleazy Listening experience. Kudos to Severin Films for doing such an exceptional job. Not only does the film look better than ever but there is a virtual smorgasbord of super awesome bonus features including an interview with director Jess Franco himself, an interview with Amy Brown who runs the awesome Soledad Miranda memorial site and an interview with film historian and musician Stephen Thrower (Coil). I cannot recommend this release enough to fans of Jess Franco, Eurosleaze or exploitation films in general.",1443571200,6,1322,5.153488372093023

7087842,5,B00VET1GBI,Being a fan of this movie for years I was excited for this release. I first saw the movie when I was super young about 13 or 14 years old. I owned a copy of the dvd which was amazing. I ordered this dvd expecting the same with some special features and I was taken by surprise when I got it. First the dvd part in this is crap they released what the bootlegged version looked like on a normal dvd with the blue ray version having the full HD movie on it. I never thought that this movie could get any better but I was wrong the transfer and remastering of this was phenomenal and the special features was so in depth I don't want to give much away but don't hesitate to add to your collection,1439942400,3,692,4.021739130434782
7087843,4,B00VET1GBI,"This movie has alluring visuals and is very sexy and beautifully shot. The film included in the Blue Ray is the one that you want to see as it is truly the one called Vampyros Lesbos. The music, the blood, the nudity is all there. Don't bother watching the dvd included on this package because its of very bad quality. Its a highly edited version of the film called ""Las Vampiras"" and it has none of the blood, nudity and awesome music that you love about Vampyros Lesobs, the dvd looks like a bootleg, horrible quality. The Blue Ray on the other hand is as awesome as they come, Vampyros Lesbos looks better than ever. I also recommend watching Daughters of Darkness, and equaling artsy fartsy and alluring lesbian vampire film.",1436918400,7,729,4.572519083969466

8709860,4,B00VET1GBI,"Vampyros Lesbos is a product of its time, so attempting to view it through a 21st century lens can be difficult when sober. You will not gasp at how realistic the blood looks, so let's clear that up straight away. This motion picture was intended as an abstract presentation nearly a half-century ago, so as you can guess, it's even more true now.
Vampyros Lesbos has been called many things, but minus the music I rather liked it.

PROs
 This Blu-ray provides a sharp, 1080p transfer in an aspect ratio of 1.66:1. Despite the encoding not being optimized, you don't want to see the alternative.
 Soledad Miranda, of course. This movie was filmed in the summer of 1970 directly prior to her death by car at the age of 27. As the story goes, she had just been offered a multi-year contract and would have become an international star had it not been for the untimely accident (honestly, is there ever a good time to die horribly from a car crash?) She was extremely photogenic, which is plain for anyone to see in Vampyros Lesbos... stunning is an appropriate word. Before working with Jess Franco, Soledad was more or less typecast in Spanish films as someone you wouldn't expect to see star in Franco's dark films, although from an early age she did show diversity in her talent.
 Can't quite put my finger on it, but I felt compelled to keep watching... no, not because of Soledad's apparent distaste for wearing garments, although that surely wasn't a disincentive. The urge certainly wasn't due to a fondness for 1970 (yucky haircuts, yucky wardrobes, ad infinitum), so it must have been the cohesive weirdness?
 Soledad's character (Condesa Oskudar, aka Countess Nadine Carody) was related to Dracula... now that's some legit credentials! If you watch the Stephen Thrower featurette that comes on the disc, you'll learn of parallels between Vampyros Lesbos and Bram Stoker's Dracula you never would have guessed otherwise.
 Due mostly to the vintage nature of Vampyros Lesbos, there is now a chance to laugh where the director did not intend for us to find humor. Yet Jess Franco was not without a sense of humor; for example, the early scene of Linda at her psychiatrist's. He also makes a cameo in the film as a slimy psychopath, which is both creepy and jocular if you know it's him.

CONs
 A soundtrack that has been described elsewhere as ""excruciating"" (I could not agree more), yet is revered by others. It's almost unfathomable that people at some point in time found this music acceptable for any purpose, but whatever floats your boat, I guess.
 While Vampyros Lesbos intuitively feels likes a series of visions that should be ocularly consumed while intoxicated on some kind of psychedelic substance, it also seems like you might have a horrible time if you attempted that.
 There's no shortage of aspects from the film that people seem to dislike. Just don't get the idea that because Soledad does most of her acting in this one without words that she is not a good actor. Soledad is solid, and you'll find this to be true simply by her screen presence.

Extras, bonus/special features (all in 1080p, although the movie clips are of variable quality).
 Interview with writer/director Franco.
 Stephen Thrower (a Franco expert) on mostly Vampyros Lesbos; a bit academic but also entertaining.
 Sublime Soledad: Amy Brown on Soledad (and a little on Franco, since the two worked together). This is a super-informative interview about how amazing Soledad Miranda was, very glad to have watched it despite the unhappy ending.
 Jess Is Yoda: I won't spoil this for you!
