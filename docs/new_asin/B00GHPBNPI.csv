8623319,4,B00GHPBNPI,"Great movies.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

Harold LLoyd's best movies by far are ""The Freshmen"" and ""Safety Last"". The print quality on those movies are excellent. Enjoyable to watch them with the commentary turned on.

8623326,4,B00GHPBNPI,"Nice and decent set of early Lloyd.  The prints are pretty good too. Story lines are hit and miss, but still it's interesting watching the development of a screen legend.

As an added benefit, a few of the films have Snub Pollard who later in teh 20's went on to his own series and then virtually disappeared as an extra in largely westerns before passing away in the early 60's.",1426723200,2,379,4.4
