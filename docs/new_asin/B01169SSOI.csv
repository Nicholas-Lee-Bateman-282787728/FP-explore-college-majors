7328195,5,B01169SSOI,"after reading roepers critical review,i was even more curious to see this film.i find critics see so many films that they get bored easily and do not always get the full grasp of the story so their opinions are limited. found this flick outstanding-a story of an aging mogul who has attained prosperity,while dismissing the real value of fatherhood. learning he has 6 mos to live,he willingly experiments with a scientific method called shedding(being able to put your brainwaves into a younger morphed body so as to extend ones life).upon doing so he re-emerges as a young man as leads a life of gratuitous immoral pleasures.a side effect of his meds is that if not taken in time,he has hallucanitive flashbacks that greatly disturb him.these change his life-course.i do not want to spoil the story for you,except to say that while there's a bit of redemption,the film also addresses what society doesn't want to accept-science,for all it's wondrous achievements, also has an evil side when the so-called intellects want to play god,the sickness of science did not end with the holocaust but is still prevalent today. man must know his limitations. see this film for it shows how those in priviledge often abuse the under-priviledged for selfish desires-thus the title SELFLESS fits the story.",1437868800,50,1294,5.0514018691588785
7328196,4,B01169SSOI,"I strongly suspect Self/less will be criticized more for what it is not than what it is.

As the film begins, icy real-estate magnate Damian (Ben Kingsley) is diagnosed with cancer and facing the end of his life, beset by fear and regret.  Out of desperation, he agrees to a highly expensive and unlawful medical procedure developed by an enigmatic scientist (Matthew Goode, exuding very British malevolence).  The treatment involves the transfer of his mind into a youthful and reportedly laboratory-grown new body (Ryan Reynolds).  At first, Damian enjoys his extended lease on life and renewed vigor, but disorienting, opaque memories he cannot identify lead him to investigate the true origin of his new form.

To be honest, this film does not cover much ground as a piece of cerebral and/or psychedelic speculative fiction, a fact which may dispirit viewers since it is by Tarsem Singh, a music-video veteran and the director of such stylish cult favorites as The Cell and The Fall.  The first-act cognitive switch is utilized as a plot-inciting device,  la the wrong-man dubiety in North by Northwest or amnesia in The Bourne Identity, rather than an invitation to travel inside the human mind and explore its contradictory, ever-shifting complexity.  And though both are in fine form, Kingsley (featured only briefly) and Reynolds do almost nothing to emulate one another, not even in the early scenes in which Damian undergoes physical therapy to become comfortable inside his just-purchased figure.  No trace of the elder English actor's fierce, guarded, stern turn can be found in Reynolds' instantly more charismatic and relaxed performance.

However, its shortcomings as science fiction notwithstanding, Self/less is a very well-executed action film.  A certain one-man-against-a-deadly-conspiracy tension builds at a steady and involving pace, and twists and turns are well-placed throughout.  The plentiful sequences of chasing and fighting are staged with spacial clarity and laced with a modest-but-still-recognizable amount of Singh's characteristic visual whimsy.  One key scene, for instance, unfolds in an out-of-the-way industrial field of discarded, decaying Mardi Gras floats and props.  There is also a grounded and low-key charm to the film's set pieces, perhaps because it is a comparatively inexpensive studio release, particularly at this time of year.  It entirely eschews ultra-over-the-top, physics-defying computer-generated wizardry.

So, Self/less may bend one's mind only slightly, but it does raise the pulse and warmly satisfy as an escapist summertime jaunt.",1436486400,12,2596,5.534177215189874

7328233,3,B01169SSOI,"Just a mediocre Ryan Reynolds movie that, really, Id only recommend to serious Ryan Reynolds fans unless you're looking for a fun, kinda bad movie.

Ben Kingsley plays a billionaire terminally ill with lung cancer who buys more time in the form of a lab-generated body.  Not since Bloodrayne (2005) has Kingsley seemed so disengaged from the camera. It's as if he actively hates playing this role more than his character hates that he his dying.  Every effort is made to display his lush lifestyle including his home, which looks like an oil Sheik's penthouse from Furious 7 (2015) complete with indoor fountains.  Who has an indoor fountain!?!?!  It's pretty ridiculous.

The body he buys is that of Ryan Reynolds (The Change-Up, Mississippi Grind, Deadpool, The Voices, The Captive, Life).  At first it seems that some effort was made to have Reynolds speak like Kingsley, but as quickly as he adapts to his new body he likewise adapts to speaking just like the Ryan Reynolds we've all known from his last ten movies.

Remember how cool it was in Face/Off (1997) to see Nic Cage and feel like we were watching John Travolta?  Or how in Like Father, Like Son (1987) it was so obvious to us (the audience) that a prestigious and pretentious doctor (Dudley Moore) was inhabiting the body of his high school son (Kirk Cameron)?  Yeah, there's not of that here.  And I'm not sure who to blame.  After all, Reynolds has almost always played some recognizably snarky iteration of himselfalthough in the recent Woman in Gold (2015) he truly shocked me with his abilities to play a more soft-spoken and tender character.  Not as impressive but still noteworthy were his performances in Buried (2010) and Mississippi Grind (2015).  Both had more than just a glimpse of the Reynolds we all know, but they forced him outside his comfort zone a bit and it worked.

So, when a Kingsley-inhabited Reynolds talks like a thirty-something Reynolds instead of a calculatingly patient, intellectual business mogul, I have to wonder if it's his fault, the director's (Tarsem Singh; The Fall, The Cell, Immortals), the writer's, everybody???

Needless to say, this is not a strong recommendation. Its fine as a hangover movie. It will liven up a boring Sunday afternoon. And, for Reynolds-completists like me, youll get some of that classic Reynolds flavor weve come to love.  But what we won't find is a good film.",1496793600,,2395,4.874074074074074

7328273,3,B01169SSOI,"Ben Kingsley is a dying real estate developer who finds that for 250 million dollars a shadowy company will put his mind into a young, healthy body.  He's told the body is grown in a lab but things aren't as they initially seem and the company and process turn out to have sinister implications.  Cinephiles will recognize the premise as being similar to the 1966 John Frankenheimer film Seconds, which offered probably Rock Hudson's finest performance.  Unfortunately, Self/less is neither as smart or as strange as that older cult film.

Self/less is fairly entertaining but suffers from a serious Ryan Reynolds problem.  Ryan Reynolds has exactly one mode where he is effective--glib.  That's great for Deadpool but not so much for anything else.  Ryan Reynolds as a serious dramatic actor has never worked for me.  He tries his best to be soulful and display emotional depth but I don't think he has that type of acting in him.  He also doesn't do anything to make it seem like he's Ben Kingsley in a new body--not a gesture, not a mannerism, not a vocal tic--there's basically nothing to sell the fact that Reynolds is playing the same person as Kingsley in the earlier scenes.

Ryan Reynolds has his fans--I am definitely not one.  Outside of Deadpool I've pretty much hated him in everything I've ever seen him in with the exception of Buried--and I suspect the reason I liked that one was because watching Ryan Reynolds slowly and painfully die over the course of a film was something I had always hoped to see.  I'm pointing this out because I have a very strong prejudice against Ryan Reynolds that I can't shake--he just always comes across as too smug and self-satisfied to me--so people who actually find Ryan Reynolds tolerable as a dramatic actor will likely enjoy this quite a bit more than I did.

Self'/less is a slick and stylish B-movie that is reasonably entertaining, even if it never quite lives up to the promise of its ideas.  Ultimately the movie is a bit dumber and more action oriented than it likely should have been.  Then there's the Ryan Reynolds problem, at least for me.  But even with my strong aversion to Reynolds I found this to be surprisingly watchable--just not something I would ever sit through again.",1483488000,,2244,4.744845360824742

I had originally seen a trailer for this in the theatre and had thought wow - what a great premise!  It seemed like something PKD would do.  And, with Ben Kingsley surely it'd be a great film!

Sadly, Kingsley is in the film for maybe the first fifteen minutes.  And, sadly, nothing at all is done with this amazing premise.  Instead it becomes a self-righteous film about how immoral it is to take a body (but that it's perfectly ok to kill - I lost count of the number of people the protagonist kills).

I won't say anything more in case you want to go ahead and watch this.  If you're looking for a treacly formulaic action flick with lots of explosions and a high body count this is for you.  If you're looking for an intelligent SciFi film that really takes this extremely interesting premise and does something with it - well, this isn't it.",1482796800,4,984,4.386740331491713
7328283,5,B01169SSOI,"The movie Self/less has a lot of the typical mainstream plot devices --- evil scientists, way too many faceless bodyguards with powerful weapons, and the usual high speed car chases... but, that said, it burns through these marketable plot devices to tell a real story about who we are, how much relationships mean to us, and what we would sacrifice for another. Bottom line, it tells the right story the right way, and Ryan Reynolds doesn't skip a beat as the lead. He connects effortlessly at the deepest human levels, and is able to create (two) characters that you care about. As Reynolds' characterization evolves, it gets really, really interesting, and I think the story will stay with you long after your screen has gone dark. Most current science fiction isn't really about what an alternative future might look like --- or feel like. That is, genres such as action, battle and horror are passed off as scifi, but actually aren't. Despite a few gaps in the setup, this movie ultimately succeeds. It makes you think and it makes you feel. One of the better recent science fiction movies. Recommended. I really like this one a lot.",1482796800,,1138,4.781725888324873

7328288,3,B01169SSOI,"Hmmmm, Self/less had all the potential to be brilliant based on a good science fiction story, but it somehow misses the mark for me.  I think it's because the character development and storytelling in the beginning is really dry and the characters themselves are never particularly memorable either.

The story is that Ben Kingsley's character develops cancer.  He knows that he's dying so he decides to get a procedure called shedding that involves taking his mind and applying it to a new body.  And guess where his mind goes?  To Ryan Reynolds body!  Lucky guy.  He gets to be younger, faster and hit on the ladies again.  I'm sure there's a joke someone could make about these two blending together but I can't think of one.

Perhaps the movie should have gone for a more joyous scenario building into Ben's cancer.  Seriously when he discusses his expensive plans with his business partner (Victor Garber's character) nothing remotely interesting happens until Ben spits up blood and guts revealing the cancer.  Something odd happens after his fellow employees call the ambulance.  An unusual group of men who are in charge of the medical procedure shedding take him away.  But... in the next scene he's safe and sound in bed at his mansion.  Huh?  I might not be remembering these events in the right order, but either way he's in bed afterwards which is strange.

As the younger and healthy Ryan Reynolds, he owns a mansion and can do whatever he likes.  Same mansion or different mansion?  Who knows.  He can take the car for a ride, play pool, or he can play with the curtains.  Whatever you wanna do Ryan!  Instead he leaves and walks to the basketball court to have a conversation with Derek Luke's character.  Yeah... not what I would've done when in control of a mansion but whatever.  Derek quickly becomes friends with Ryan (or rather *tries* to become friends with Ryan).

Ryan gradually gets strange images and memories in his head of a hilltop somewhere in the country lands of Saint Louis Missouri.  He sees a little girl and her mother.  Bothered heavily by these images he travels there, and this is when the story really gets going.  While on this Missouri farm he breaks and enters a house (bad idea man, really!) and... turns out Ryan's wife is here (Natalie Martinez).  She's in tears with happiness and confusion upon seeing him.  She thought he died!  She doesn't realize this is actually another man (Ben Kingley) disguised to look like her husband.

The next part of the movie is my favorite moment.  The doctor in charge of the shedding (Matthew Williams Goode), Derek Luke and another man show up.  How odd for them to show up in the middle of nowhere!  Obviously they followed Ryan.  Hey Derek, we're friends aren't we?  Not anymore!  They're here to trap Natalie so she doesn't discover the truth, and of course arrest/kill Ryan.  We can't have this new procedure of taking someone's mind and putting it in someone else's body get out now can we!  No we can't.

LOL!  I have to mention this SPOILER.  When Ryan hides under the front porch, he shoots Derek in the knee and he falls down, and the guy with the flamethrower turns due to the surprise and burns Derek to death by mistake!  Then Ryan kills that guy!  We then see Ryan and Natalie run over a hill to avoid being detected by the firefighters who are driving towards the house.  Imagine what the firefighters were thinking when they showed up and saw a man burned to death by a flamethrower, shot in the knee, the guy with the flamethrower lying there dead, all in front of a swing set out in the country?  Not just another ordinary day on the job I bet!

Anyway as you can guess, Ryan tries to convince Natalie they have to run which eventually results in them settling down at a nearby gas station to discuss what's going on and who he really is.  This occurs after the little girl they have, Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen, is picked up from school.  She's a sweetie and curious- she asks if daddy's sick in one scene, because they're going to the hospital.  ""Of course not sweetie!""  She's really happy to see who she thinks is daddy again.  Natalie's too confused to be happy.

The movie remains good when Ryan and Natalie settle into a fancy hotel but low and behold, more thugs related to Matthew's crew show up to try and take out Ryan again.  Good suspense when Jaynee gets curious and wanders into a nearby playroom.  Ryan and Natalie have trouble finding her at first which teases a potential kidnapping.

Unfortunately the movie falls apart after they escape.  Ryan tries to have a discussion with Victor Garber to prove he is actually Ben Kingsley.  Victor thinks he's a stranger at first but soon it works, he can convince Victor after Ben reveals something only the two of them would know, but soon after this, unfortunately the story goes for a bland action-packed change.  I was getting quite confused what was going on during all this action too.  Is Victor behind it all?  We see him in the shadows watching Ryan drive away.  To mention a TV show Victor once starred in, the film goes in a very Alias-like direction during these final 30 minutes.  While I loved Alias, Self/less should have taken a different course.  The movie was fine up to this point.

This movie does a lot of things right.  The action in the first 90 minutes is really good, but generic and confusing towards the end when it just becomes a cluttered mess of bad guys that Ryan has to fight off.  There's some suspense throughout the movie, but there's also times it falls apart and feels tacky.  The story starts off *really* bad with no interesting characters to speak of.  Ben Kingley, Victor Garber and Ben's daughter are all bland at first, and in fact they never really get better.  In the case of Ben's daughter, she isn't written into the story nearly enough.  The high points are when Ryan travels to Saint Louis to figure out what's going on with the images in his head.  The story should have focused on this aspect instead of having bland action scenes.  Plus Jaynee herself is a great actress.  She might just be a kid but she nailed this role.  I recommend the movie and enjoy it for the most part, but it's not consistently appealing.",1482105600,,6220,4.612785388127854

7328306,5,B01169SSOI,"I haven't seen any Sci-Fi film this good for a long long time.
Not because there is dazzling special effect or millions of budget or well known super star or anything.
It's all about small visual story telling, great script, heart warming acting.

This movie was made by Tarsem Singh who also made <THE CELL> and since I saw that movie before I was all into this movie.
It was so sad that this movie was not a major hit at the boxoffice.
After finishing experimenting through films like <THE CELL><THE FALL>, he made films like <IMMORTALS><MIRROR MIRROR> and this one.
This film has a meaning since it' some kind of completion storywise, visual+ script combination wise.

People are saying that the film is a combination of <FACE/ OFF> and <LIMITLESS> I say it's far from them.
It has way more depth and beyond.

The story is simple an old man who has disease about to die has power to use other body to re-born.
But the thing is someone has to be sacrifise. OF course they pay a lot of money but they should die for that.
Also once they transferred into the new body they should keep take pills otherwise they go crazy becaue of the previous people's memory and fantasy.

When this old guy begins to live a new life he got this image of a beautiful hispanic woman and a beautiful girl perhaps his daghter.
He finally notices that someone have had died because of his money.

He searched them and finally meets them.
Then in the instance, he falls in love.
Always the love is the reason.
Then the sacrifice again to the family.

This is an incredible story about technology, music video like shots, and most of all love and forgiveness reunion of the family.

One movie you should never miss this year.",1473379200,,1702,4.488673139158576

In return, Ryan Reynolds gave up his entire future by surrendering his body for the process of re-habitation which allows for somebody else to inhabit his body.

I thought the characters, dilemmas, and filming was all expertly done. Definitely one of  Ryan Reynolds best. Plenty of twists that may have been a bit excessive but they all fit. Doesn't really get onto all the moral question side of it, or why this character needed to keep living.

7328418,3,B01169SSOI,"I respect everyone's opinion, but this was a good not great movie. The premise is incredible. And there is a lot of plot lines that can branch out of it. And instead of a performance that unleashed Ryan Reynolds and allowed him to go thru a range of emotions, this turned into a mostly bland action movie. I will say the scene in the mansion with the child is incredible in showing another aspect to this procedure and its uses. The main antagonist has a twist that I saw coming, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I wish this movie was a little less focused on the action and pushing plot lines when it could have taken moments to slow down and explore the less heroic side of Ben Kingsley's character (Inside Ryan Reynolds character). Before we see Kingsley's character transferred to Reynolds body, he shows a very aggressive and selfish side. I will say that I still think this a good movie. This movie spent too much time on action when the best parts of it could have been the acting. Worth a watch once, but didn't live up to its potential.",1455408000,3,1046,4.453125

7328420,5,B01169SSOI,"An amazing look at where science could be taking us and the consequences. Ben Kingsley is, as always, right on target with his portrayal of the rich guy who can buy anything, and does. The kicker is, he finally has to look directly in the face of those he has hurt, and the ways in which they are hurt, In essence, he actually becomes THE victim of his own greed and selfishness; and, metaphorically, he also becomes all of the victims he has stepped on or over during his life.

7328441,3,B01169SSOI,"a wealthy man in his late 60s and terminally ill buys a highly expensive chance at a second bite of the apple from a suspicious company and finds that, no surprise, the company doesn't exactly deliver what it promises. the company's presentation is so shady I wouldn't have gone near them if I were a wealthy dying person, so when the Ben Kingsley character does so, I roll my eyes, even though the film tries to mitigate his actions by showing that his failing health pushes him toward rashness. I also disliked the set design, specifically the Ben Kingsley penthouse was just over the top decked out in gold. There may be wealthy people in modern New York who have penthouses that look like that, but I thought the design too heavy handed, especially as the Ben Kingsley character carries his power relatively lightly, I thought, not excessively overbearingly (except with his daughter). He behaves as you'd expect a man who's had power for decades. He'd not need flash, he'd be understated. If he was a younger man and new to power, I could've better understood the gold on gold on gold. But his manner, his behavior had me doubt he'd have gold on gold on gold (furnishings, wallpaper, etc.) as the film represents and I thought it out of sync with the way Ben Kingsley played him. My main problem with the story is that I didn't accept that the character would be so stupid as to buy what was advertised, even with him being at death's door. I know many people would probably not be happy to die at 68, but as a 56 year old person with health issues, and reading about the death and destruction in our world, I just feel a worldly sophisticated person who understands that death is part of life, would not allow himself to be fleeced by a company he's not vetted, out of desperation to live longer. The story opens with him putting a younger, sneaky whipper snapper in place, that's how the film establishes him. He's a businessman and highly successful. He's dealing with another business and yet seems to have lost all the skill he's acquired dealing with businesses over the decades simply because he's ill. That's poor writing. Yes he's terminally ill, but he's functioning. We see him out to lunch with his friend, we see him visiting his daughter's organization, we see him working and active, even though he's sick, so it's out of character in my opinion for him to take a leap of faith as he does with the company, especially as the company who cheats him presents itself so shadily. The company rep's behavior basically screams ""con,"" and Ben Kingsley's character is supposed to be a master player. He wouldn't lose his intelligence just because he has cancer. He knew he was dying. As a master of the game, a man who was a major player in building New York, he'd know that there are many people who will cheat you, and he'd know that by placing himself in the hands of a company he hadn't properly vetted, he'd stand a good chance of being cheated, and be without recourse as everything was done in secrecy. A major player would know people. He'd know that the company didn't pass the the sniff test (if it smells, it's probably rotten). At the very least he'd have had someone do some digging for him, hired an expert security/background checking company, anything to vet these guys, but he didn't. We see him doing a few computer searches, that's it, and that's not enough. His actions are inconsistent with what his character is supposed to be, which is poor writing. The company he decides to trust does kill him. Just before he dies they tell him they're about to stop his heart, and they do. He is agitated, obviously they didn't go through the process with him, explain to him in enough detail what was to happen. I just really disliked the first act where he basically hands over his life to an organization he knows nothing about. It doesn't fit with the persona the film tries to establish for him. I also disliked that after the Ryan Reynolds character merges with him that he's suddenly a fighting machine. Story did a very poor job setting up his new skill set, and I was like, what, how is he suddenly taking out 5 guys singlehandedly. Worth a watch, the acting is good, but the story's poorly executed. 2 and a half stars. P.S. How they could've fixed it: (1) have the Ben Kingsley character successfully vet the company but have the person who vouches for them be a shill. Show the audience this. At least we won't think he's a moron for blindly handing his life over to people he didn't know. If the audience questions the intelligence of the character, you've lost your audience; (2) have the company not be presented shadily; (3) If the Ben Kingsley character is going to get skills from the person whose body he buys, give the audience that information before he becomes a fighting machine. It doesn't have to be that the Ryan Reynolds' character was a competent fighter, some other skill that the Ben Kingsley character gets, so that the audience understands there is a transfer of information/skills, etc. that's hardwired, so much part of the body that Ben Kingsley suddenly acquires skills he doesn't know he has. Could've been done using humor, in the lovemaking scenes, any number of places, just so audience gets that information before the character is fighting for his life. Giving it to us without set up makes us view the skills as convenient when he suddenly displays them, which means we don't believe them, which means we're out of the story. Film could've been much stronger had it been constructed more solidly.",1454284800,,5561,4.629554655870446

7328457,3,B01169SSOI,"Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is a super-rich business tycoon.  One of those who is chauffeured around Manhattan in a Maybach followed by an armored-up black SUV with a couple bodyguards following him wherever he goes.  Hes not yet 60 and seemingly at the top of his game.  One problem.  He has cancer and only a few months to live.  He gets a tip that a company called Phoenix Biogenics can fix him up with a process called ""shedding.""  After being pushed away by his estranged daughter (Michelle Dockery), he figures what does he have to lose.  Well, $250K for one thing but a small price for a bit more life.  So heres the deal.  Phoenix Biogenics, a company run by a guy named Albright (Matthew Goode) has perfected a process that transfers the consciousness of one person into the inanimate but alive body of another.  In this case its the body of Ryan Reynolds.  So good choice.

 Neither Damian nor the audience get much of an explanation as to where this guy comes from.  Or how many of these sheddings have occurred.  I guess if your desperate, sometimes you just have to say what the f**k.  (Note:  I just watched Risky Business a couple days ago.)  After weeks of conditioning and acclimation to the new body, Damien is given a weeks supply of red pills which help him along the way.  When he misses the pill popping hour, Damien becomes very ill and hallucinates.  Images of people and places appear, none of which are familiar.  After finally getting tired of pickup basketball games in New Orleans with his new best friend (Derek Luke) and nightly sexual conquests, Albright suggests Damien further recuperate a bit longer in Hawaii.  But Damien, haunted by the visual images heads for metropolitan St. Louis instead.

Tarsem Singh, the director of The Cell and The Fall has created movies that are long on style if a bit short of reality.  In this film he has neither.  Up to this point the film had an interesting if not totally original premise and one that was being developed deliberately.  Then suddenly, Singh felt like he needed to put his foot on the accelerator and switch to an action film.

It seems now that Phoenix Biogenics has much to hide, specifically where do all those hunky dude bodies come fromduh.  And they don't want Damien going to Missouri and poking around.  And it appears that the ripped Damien has other secret skills he didn't even know about.  The story devolves into a traditional action movie leaving its sci-fi investigative thriller beginnings behind.  Too bad, it could have been a contender.

The Blu ray disc comes in a 1080p video resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The movie looks great.  Shot digitally, it maintains excellent detail and contrast.  The close ups are well done and the movie works in both nighttime sequences, action scenes and colorful daytime shots.  I could detect no anomalies.  Well done.  The audio comes courtesy of a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is excellent as well.  There is plenty to work with in the film including some gun battles, a solid musical score, environmental elements and of course, the ever-present flame thrower.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include a 3 making of style pieces (Inside Self/less, On the Run: The Action of Self/Less and Shedding) all with comments from various actors and crew.  Singh provides a commentary track and there are a handful of trailers.",1453680000,,3413,4.7542662116040955

Lots of twists and turns and even thought the movie was about 2 hours enjoyed it all very much.  The ending has a nice twist!  See it. You like it!,1451865600,,412,3.9036144578313254
7328502,5,B01169SSOI,A great mind twisting thriller. Highly recommend!,1451692800,,49,6.142857142857143
7328503,4,B01169SSOI,"This idea, contrary to some opinions is an old one.  This one is exactly John Scalzis, Old Mans War series idea but Ol John Perry had no idea what he was in for.  In this outing of the idea Damien Hale did know at least as much as the crippled Jake Sully in Avatar knew.  Figure the dates..., and Avatar was probably influenced by Old Mans War.  But it is a great idea, and folks can do a lot with it.  This one is a tried and true character quest plot which explaining creeps into the spoiler category if you don't already know what it is.  If you do, you know those are usually great stories.

To me it was predictable.  Not the movie's fault that Ive read a lot.  The plot has a couple ways to go.  The way this one went is probably the most popular and well liked.  I was a little surprised it wasn't more.  I think I just was not feeling the crash, bang, boom going on.  I would have liked a little more getting in touch with the past training.  I think that would have sold me on the crash, bang, boom more convincingly.

Dont misunderstand, it is a good movie.  Ben Kingsley can do no wrong by me.  Ryan Reynolds is working on getting there himself, and I have a spot in my heart for Natalie Martinez from the Under the Dome days.  Sprinkle in some Victor Garber and you have a set of actors almost always worth watching.  I enjoyed a couple of surprising plot point twists that I didn't see coming.  Movie might be worth watching for those alone.  It is great when a story surprises and that isn't an easy thing to sell to well conditioned entertainment consumers.

To me this is a solid 4 stars.  First review, from elsewhere, I looked at before watching the movie had me feeling like I was out in the desert looking into the night sky there were so many stars.  Its worth watching.  Then you decide.",1451606400,,1809,4.204081632653061

7328510,5,B01169SSOI,"Prepare yourself for the first  Science Fiction, Thriller, Adventure, Action, Mystery you will ever see that is sweet in nature and happy in  ending.

There is a  first of its kind remarkable, effective, and mature moral center in S/L.

The bad guy scientist (BGS) ( is played by Matthew Goode--of all names!) only acts with  both  good intentions and for better ends.  But he still errs:  sorry Victor F--so it goes once again.

Even his evil minions revere the BGS and aren't into evil for the bucks; so they are kinda likable and you are going to end up thinking well of them even though their actions wouldn't qualify for merit badges. (They don't earn any stinking... )

The two older guys (co-lead and supporting actor)  who play temporary hero (before transplant) and his BFF are tricked into an act that is wrong but they have been deceived; so again, they are essentially and impossibly virtuous even in light of their shady profession.

I mean they are real estate developers or contractors or  high rise builders; so the basic level of reasonable doubt and loathing most adults might carry in viewing them is smashed aside by their parts played by Ben Kingsley and Victor Garber. Both actors pack credits for being decent fellas that border on the  peerless and they behave well here; so again we like ...

As for Ryan Reynolds, here is another tough role he plays perfectly.  Stick him in a casket--he bangs it out of the parK (Buried). Put him opposite Jeff Bridges (R. I. P.D.) and he comes off a good ghost.  Place him in the general presence of Helen Mirren (Woman in Gold) and he  makes  our country proud.  Place him in a nude scene with  Sandra Bullock and he is a gentleman and a fine hand at rom-com even when you hit the stop button to check out Sandra.  Van Wilder is long ago and the vehicles he has chosen since are near or solidly four stars and sometimes fives (as is the case here).

As for the capacity of this movie to make us suspend disbelief,  all the good stuff is there.  Special effects, set decoration (what an art director did with plastic sheeting might merit a nod come the Oscars), photography, editing (the pacing is particularly effective but there are always somethings more dazzling) ; so masterpieces go unrecognized or picking up what
ever might follow a bronze  The director also did fine work which means if S/L makes enough money he'll get another project.

Reynolds did a pretty good job, though he's done better in some of his previous films. He actually doesn't get as much credit as he should regarding his acting chops.

7328545,3,B01169SSOI,"One of the reasons, I decided to watch this was the interesting premise of the science fiction storyline.  Unfortunately, this movie tends to stray from the science fiction aspect of the story and evolves into more of your standard fare action film.  As an action film, this is entertaining to watch but lacks a bit of depth that I was hoping for.  Even though I am a fan of the actors in this, the acting seems a bit flat at times and I think suffers from the story more than the acting itself.  I think the movie fails to fully explore the aspects of the main characters two lives and other aspects of the mind among other things this movie could have delved into.  Unfortunately, the story goes from its ambitious start to more of a predictable neatly packaged ending.  This isn't a bad ending by any means as it is an entertaining watch but it really could have been so much more ambitious and a little less predictable.

7328598,4,B01169SSOI,"Spanish brothers David and Alex Pastor wrote the story and produced the screenplay for Indian director Tarsem Singh of this a bit off the wall story of shedding  or transfer of consciousness into another body. The idea is fine and the acting is very fine but somehow the telling of the story gets sidetracked into a bit too much back-story to make the film flow smoothly.

The brief synopsis (without all the paraphernalia imposed on it during the telling) is a dying real estate mogul Damien (Ben Kingsley) transfers his consciousness into a healthy young body of an ex-soldier Mark (Ryan Reynolds), but soon finds that neither the procedure nor the company that performed it are quite what they seem. The head of the company is one Albright (Matthew Goode) and imparts a sense of sci-fi feeling that dilutes the plot. As the story unfolds we discover that Mark has a wife (Natalie Martinez) and child for whom he sold his body to Albrights company for funds to aid his ill daughter to use in the act of shedding for Damien. We are able to watch the process of consciousness transfer and the new life that Damien (in Marks body) and that is well done. But as Albright says to the questioning Damien the younger aka Mark, as you slip away, do you feel immortal? We offer humanity's greatest minds more time to fulfill their potential. Designed to offer you the very best of the human experience.
Were it not for Ryan Reynolds ability to carry off this intellectually absurd role the film would likely fail. He is supported by a fine cast that includes (besides Kingsley, Goode, and Martinez) Victor Garber, Derek Luke, and Michelle Dockery.

Definitely a film for sci-fi fans, but it raises questions about brain manipulation that give us pause to think. Grady Harp, November 15",1448582400,,1778,4.7290322580645165

I watched this movie with no expectations as my family and I often enjoy a lot of movies in our home theater. After a while, you tend to run out of the extremely good stuff & buy movies to stay current & hope for the best.

Well, I can say that this was truly an egaging movie. It had a lot of surprise twist & turns, but nothing that went so far over your head that you were left sitting there going, ""what just happened""? The movie was a lot of fun to watch. Also, even though it didn't get the media attention that some movies get, I'll remind you that the movies that get all of the press, more often than not, leave you feeling rather ""unimpressed"".

This movie was easy to watch. It's not a kids movie but there was no nudity & very mild profanity, if any. Instead, the movie focused on and stayed true to the storyline without veering off too far to mon essential sub plots.

I'm not a professional movie critic. I'm  just a regular person who appreciates a good flick that's worth my full price dollar. It's refreshing to say that is movie fits the bill. I don't lnow abpit you, but I get tired of paying $22-$25 dollars for blu rays that are overhyped just so that Hollywood can overpay it's favorite actors.

Sure he's not a Daniel Day Lewis with easy access to as many oscars as he desires... No, but Ryan can play the funny guy when called upon or the badass/serious person when needed. The latter was chosen for this film and it works well for Ryan. Its not really a spoiler, as it is revealed early, but Kingsley's character doesn't have much screen time. As the trailer suggest, Kingsley's character's mind is transported into the body of Ryan Reynolds's character. Ryan does a great job conveying that we are still dealing with Kingsley even though he is no where near the screen. I believed that Kingsley was really inside going along for the ride. That's good acting folks!

The story is new... I dare someone to find something similar. But it could be improved upon in areas. However, overall, this film is somewhat compelling from the beginning to the end. I did feel a little bit like ""really?"" at the end. Not saying that it was bad... But I'll let you decide. Definitely check this out if you want to see something different.

It's only scifi in the sense that it steals riffs from previous scifi movies (Face/Off, Seconds and several others), and in that you have to suspend an awful lot of disbelief to go along with it. Kingsley is only in it briefly, doing an accent that sounds like he's from Brooklyn, Ontario. The bulk of the movie is Ryan Reynolds doing, well, Ryan Reynolds.

allow himself to live on in conciousness within a different body.
'Mark' (Ryan Reynolds) had walked away from his life to save his young daughter, he's sold his very being to do so.
After the procedure though proclaimed dead, the 68 year old businessman gradually becomes aware of his new and
youthful appearance though it will take time to adapt.
'Damien' must keep taking a prescribed drug at regular intervals, without he will almost certainly lose his identity all
together.
There is a problem however, he keeps getting flash-backs of the life his new body once knew so much so he has to
investigate to find out where he had come from and who the people he keeps seeing are.
Back in 'Brighton County' he finds 'Madeline' (Natalie Martinez) who is surprised to see her husband 'Mark' alive, along
with a young and healthy 'Anna' (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen) who calls him 'Daddy'
Trouble is there are those that cannot except him back in town because of why he'd faked his death, it will become a kill
or be killed situation.
'Damien' knows he must take 'Madeline' and 'Anna' to a safe place before he can continue or discover his future, however
it seems that those that had helped create the new 'Damien' are less than happy that he appears to be caught between the
two realities, he'll need to convince an associate and friend that he is consciously his dead friend to get the help he needs
to secure the well being of 'Mark's' wife and Daughter.
There is more trouble yet to come for the confused donor............which reality will he end up choosing.
Though not an entirely new-idea this is a well constructed Sci-Fi movie that will almost certainly hold your attention, the film
has several good car-chase and action sequences along the way.....well worth a viewing

The best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of ""Hauser's Memory.""  Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.

Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say ""Hauser's Memory"" but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.

This, with a different topic, speaks just as clearly.

The problem isn't it moving a human consciousness from body to another - plenty to quibble about there, if you're so minded, but I'll allow a movie three impossible things to get started. This comes in way under budget.

The problem, instead is money - who has it and doesn't need it, who needs it and doesn't have it, and the shady dealings that sometimes connect the two. It takes a rapacious, amoral kind of mentality to complete some of these deals. Some of the people with buckets of money got it that way. And, however little it represents reality, the same stereotype sometimes attaches to scientists. (Maybe vivisection is long gone, in its goriest form, but its reputation lives on even as technologies it might use move on.)

But people are still people, and human values still matter. I think that's the hopeful note here. Desperate people with grasp at anything , and desperate people will grasp at more, and maybe turn a blind eye to the details. But, however rich someone might be, their eyes can open. And, however high the cost might be, the moral sense that binds us together can come through.

7328743,3,B01169SSOI,"What does it say that Tarsem Singh, a director best known for his dazzling visual flair, is becoming just another standard, everyday filmmaker? Whatever one had to say about The Cell, The Fall, or Immortals, they at least looked great even if the narratives were sketchy. His last film, Mirror Mirror, a colorful fairy tale reimagining, was like Singh straddling the bridge between his adventurous early style and the generic approach he takes to Self/Less, a body-swapping thriller with enough twists and turns to overcome its disappointing lack of ambition.

Self/Less is a film that stands solidly on the shoulders of John Frankenheimer's 1966 film, Seconds, in exploring themes of identity and transhumanism. However, the screenplay crafted by David and Alex Pastor only superficially approaches these issues in order to keep the momentum at a high pace and star Ryan Reynolds showing why he was once considered a top action star. Basically, don't expect the film to get as deep as it likely could have. In the double-identity genre think of it less like Looper and more like Face/Off.

So how in the world can Ben Kingsley and Ryan Reynolds ever be the same guy? What twisted reality is this? Kingsley, sporting an overdone New Yawk accent, is heart/less (sorry, it's a habit) billionaire real estate magnate Damian Hale, who lives in a luxuriant high-rise apartment in New York City. Like King Midas the interior of the place is covered in gold, and also like Midas all of that wealth hasn't made Damian happy. He's estranged from his daughter (Michelle Dockery) who rejects his opulent lifestyle, but worse is that he's been diagnosed with terminal cancer. With only a short time to live, Damian grows desperate, and since he's rich he can afford to be part of a crazy experiment run by the silky smooth and mysterious Albright (Matthew Goode). Without going too deep into it, Damian's mind will be transferred into a younger, healthier, more physically-fit body (which looks a lot like Ryan Reynolds because it is) so he can start over again. He'll have his money and a new lease on life with which to do whatever he wants.

But, as Albright casually warns, Death has some side effects. Those turn out to be that Damian, now known as Edward, is having agonizing flashbacks of memories that clearly aren't his. Turns out his new body has some wear on the tires, having belonged to a former soldier with a wife named Madeline (Natalie Martinez) and daughter. That puts a serious crimp in Edward's new life as a rich New Orleans philanderer, so Albright puts him on a regiment of pills that will make the body's old personality fade away.

Short of a brief, searing montage of Edward's high-roller lifestyle of hot sex, gambling, and liquor, Self/Less could have been directed by just about anybody. Singh acquits himself well to the rest of the material but it lacks the stylistic fingerprint we're accustomed to. For the most part the rest of the movie plays out like standard action fare, as Damian/Edward begins to have second thoughts about the procedure, especially when he meets Edward's family who are understandably confused by the situation. Meanwhile, Albright isn't willing to let him run around and screw things up, so he sends an army of body-swapping goons to kill Damian/Edward once and for all. Those aspects of the story are pretty silly (hey, let's keep a low profile but torch the guy's house!), but the internal conflict within Edward/Damian is where the film succeeds. For Damian, he must decide finally come to grips with the terrible man he used to be, and decide if he's strong enough to live up to the courageous man whose body he now occupies. The jumbled emotional conflicts between Damian and Madeline also produce some interesting dilemmas, although they are too often interrupted by gunfights and car chases to be dealt with in any depth.

Showing the charm and chiseled physicality that has carried him well through much lesser films, Reynolds finally seems to be moving beyond the disasters that derailed his career. But for Singh, Self/Less could be sign that he's ready to just fit in to the Hollywood landscape, and that would be disappointing.",1439078400,,4185,4.905367231638418

An ageing billionaire is given the chance to cheat death by having his mind transferred into a younger body. When his curiosity threatens the secrecy of the project he must cheat death again and again and again.

What did I think?

Its like the creators of this film were experimenting with teleportation. Their clever brain-swap sci-fi script climbed into the machine, but they didn't notice a gross little nineties action film buzz in at the last moment.

When the smoke clears youve got a vaguely interesting tale (brightened up by some artsy editing) that starts to digest itself with dull car chases and lots of uninspired gun fights. I never looked at my watch, but I did forget Id seen it the following day.",1438041600,,731,4.732283464566929
7328745,3,B01169SSOI,"Saw it in a theater and came out disappointed. The initial plot is very good, though a variation on a theme that has been SciFi'ed many a time. An extremely rich man is about to die. A mysterious scientist offers him another chance, to transfer his personality into a new, healthy, and young body. You guessed right. Damian agrees, even though he has to divorce himself from all he knew, including his neglected social and green activist daughter (who, obviously, hates him for being rich and successful. Surprise?). When he learns to live in his new body, he finds out that missing his medication gives him terrible day- and nightmares. To make a long story short, he becomes a mix of the two personalities, the old and the new. Then he discovers that his rebirth required death of the host. He also discovers that his new body has a wife (widow?) and a child (orphan?). He decides his loyalty belongs to the wife and child of the new body and puts his own safety at the mercy of the murderous scientific body-renewal enterprise. From there it is the usual cops vs. robbers, good guys vs. bad guys, cowboys and Indians, shootouts with hand guns that carry more bullets than a regiment of Seals...You could guess again. Car chases galore! In a word, the same action movie you've been watching for the last twenty years again and again.
What was missed was a chance to make a really interesting movie investigating science, morality, ethics, religion. Some moviemakers took this chance, in the new Solaris, in Starman, in The Blade Runner, in The Twelve Monkeys, even in Alien and Ghostbusters. Some took this chance without giving up the action and the suspense. But not here. Hence a timid three star score for reasonably entertaining and unreasonably unintelligent action movie.
While Ben Kingsley gives a great cameo performance, Ryan Reynolds is correct and l'ukewarm, while Natalie Martinez is plainly not good, partly because the director and the script-writer want her to fall in love again with somebody who isn't her husband.' A real woman would have started screaming from the time her dead hubby had re-appeared until the end of the movie, too long anyway.",1437955200,4,2167,4.827956989247312

8723661,4,B01169SSOI,"Overall, worth watching. However, there are a few glaring problems.

The story is not wholly original. It borrows from older movies like Face-Off. Not offensively, but enough to leave a mark.

All Ryan Reynolds movies have a weirdness to them. He plays that kind of role well. Ben Kingsley is impeccable as an actor but has only a brief appearance in this flick.

There are a few scenes which seemed disjointed. This along with the complex storyline made for a very choppy feel overall. It is slow moving with a touch of action here and there. Some well-choreographed fights, gunplay, and a car chase.

This is NOT a huge budget movie. However, the exterior and interior settings are often quite compelling.

My biggest gripe was that I had to not only suspend belief around the science fiction elements but also around some of the poorly conceived story elements. Not enough background information was given so I felt like I was GUESSING why things were happening.

Also, emotions didn't seem real in a lot of scenes. People were very angry when they should have been confused and bewildered. Then, in the next scene, the anger is gone and they are playful and curious. I am referencing the interactions between the Reynolds character and the girl's mother early on. When actors display emotions that raise questions and then those questions are never answered, I feel that it was just poor acting/directing. Weird or off-kilter emotions disrupt the storyline and add to that choppy feel. It takes the viewer out of the story.

And then there are those little ""divine interventions"" (as they were called in ancient Greek theater) in which, for instance, the hero needs a pill in order to survive and this pill is a proprietary secret pertaining to the central medical procedure. No one but the head scientist knows that this pill is, but the friend of Ben Kingsley character just so happens to have had it ""reverse engineered"" in the nick of time. Really?

There should have been, in my humble opinion, a lot more development of the mother and young girl so as to make the end scene more satisfying. It is good, but like the rest of the movie, it is somewhat lessened by the lack of set-up.

I don't want to have someone tell me an incredibly far-fetched tale and then just expect me to believe it without suspicion!",1529884800,,2317,4.729528535980148
8723662,5,B01169SSOI,So so so good. Ryan Reynolds is incredible in this. It's very sci-fi and it gets emotional. The action sequences are great and the resolution is perfect.,1529884800,,153,4.703703703703703
