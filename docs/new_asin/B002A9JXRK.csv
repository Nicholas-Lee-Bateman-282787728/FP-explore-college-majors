8359113,2,B002A9JXRK,"nothing what I was looking for, focused mostly on the Geysers & Geyser history
seemed outdated...I wanted a tour of the entire park, hi-lighting all the parts, maybe advice on when to see what
hints, tips, etc....nothing like that.
Waste of my money!",1391731200,,250,4.837209302325581
8359114,4,B002A9JXRK,It was very good. I used it along with a creative writing assignment so that the students could get a visual fellof Yellowstone as none have ever been there.,1367193600,,157,4.448275862068965
8359115,3,B002A9JXRK,"Great video; but buy the audio version instead.
the video and audio editing is choppy. This video uses the Audio from Way point tours audio tour of the same name; but has many parts missing from the original. Some places the editor cuts off narration mid sentence. The video adds to the sound-but leaves out key elements from the original sound track.",1365465600,2,351,4.67741935483871
8359116,4,B002A9JXRK,"I bought the video because I was going to Yellowstone National Park.  I was looking forward to seeing the beautiful scenery and wild animals, especially the bison.  Video came in with a very good, clear picture.  This video helped me plan my trip because I could decide what attractions I wanted to see and those I'd skip.  Yellowstone is a huge park and planning one's time is the key to a great trip. I recommend this video for anyone planning on traveling to Yellowstone.",1363046400,8,474,4.607142857142857
