8456881,3,B0054QHHYM,"I bought this movie for Sudden Fury.  The funny thing is that on the jacket it uses that name, on the DVD it uses the title A Family Torn Apart.  It's the same movie, but it's confusing when trying to play Sudden Fury!  I like made for TV movies, based a true life, and this was one of several I wanted to see again.

The other two movies are okay, but not great.",1420761600,,363,3.9315068493150687
8456882,5,B0054QHHYM,"such different movies:sudden fury is about a boy who kills his parents and the movie tells you why.
  ; Out of control is about a teenage who is the bad rebel who parents can't control him so they send him into a mental home and things aren't what they seem
  :Stranger in the family is about a young man who gets into are car accident and really has to start over learning to read write talk etc . All these movie are excellent and I totally recommend them.",1391126400,,458,4.170454545454546
