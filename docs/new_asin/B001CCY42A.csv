3508564,4,B001CCY42A,"I love Stanley!  It's a kind of Death Wish with snakes(and without Charles Bronson)  Tim is a Native American recently back from Vietnam.  He lives alone out in the Everglades, refusing most contact with the human world, even his own tribe.  Tim loves snakes more than humans, and keeps MANY of them around his shack, but the apple of Tim's eye is a rattlesnake named Stanley.
Tim seems to be heading down that road to the laughing academy, and a visit by a racist and murderous group of thugs puts Tim and Stanley into action.  Tim goes on a revenge fueled killing spree using Stanley and a mess of other rattlesnakes as weapons.  When an exotic dancer betrays Tim-by biting the heads off the snakes he lends her for use in her dancing act at the whim of her jerk-0 boyfriend/manager-he goes after her as well.  The film ends in an act where Tim kidnaps the daughter of the mafia type dude he killed earlier.  Seems Tim needs a little human companionship after all and decides to show her his pet trouser snake.  This relationship throws everything into turmoil and it all comes to a head in the end.
Needless to say, Stanley is a fun bit of drive-in style late night fun.  Not overly violent or gory(though some of the animal cruelty is unpleasant), the film originally was released with a PG rating back in the 70s.  This DVD is the uncut version, which isn't a bloodbath or anything, but does jack it up past the PG level a bit.
Definitely a must see for exploitation and grindhouse fans.",1269820800,2,1492,4.488888888888889

8286756,5,B001CCY42A,"STANLEY (1972) is the story of Tim Ochopee (Chris Robinson), a Seminole gent who lives in the Everglades. Tim loves animals, especially snakes! Rattlesnakes in particular! In fact, his best pals are rattlers. They stay in his home / shack, along w/ his other thousand or so snakes. Basically, Tim lives in what looks like the snake-house at the zoo. His human friends worry about him. They think he may have slipped a few gears. Tim ignores their pleas to return to his village. He'd much rather wear his rattlesnakes around his neck, in the woods. Enter capitalist pig w/ enormous sideburns, Richard Thompkins (Alex Rocco) and his neanderthal / Joe Namath hybrid henchman, Crail Denning (Steve Alaimo). Thompkins wants Tim to catch snakes for him, so he can turn them into belts. If only he could see that they make much better neck-wear! Stanley is Tim's favorite reptile / necktie. They sleep together too. One evening, Tim and Stanley go to town, where Tim keeps the local snake-dancer supplied w/ her slithery partners. We realize very soon that this town is mostly populated by idiots. Uh oh! Tim gets into big trouble w/ Thompkins and his cranially crippled cronies! They refuse to see the beauty of snake love. After hiring Marty ""Psycho"" Simpson, a drug-addled lunatic, who cackles, raves, and dresses like Wavy Gravy, they start killing Stanley's cousins. WARNING: Animal cruelty ensues. Meanwhile, Gloria -the snake dancer- is forced by her repulsive husband to use a new gimmick in her act. A gimmick that will drive Tim -even more- bananas! Yep, it's payback time! The rest is an astonishing display of death-by-serpents! That is, until the abduction sequence, complete w/ drippy theme song, when Tim sails off his rocker for good! Alas, more unnecessary animal cruelty occurs. BEST SCENES: #1- Any scene w/ ""Psycho"" in it! #2- Tim's matching canopy beds for Stanley and his bride! #3- Thompkins' final jump into his pool! A must for the early 70's horror film fanatic!...",1522454400,2,1985,4.946107784431137
8286757,4,B001CCY42A,"This isn't along the lines of something like WILLARD or BEN. Unlike those films, there isn't hordes and hordes of snakes attacking and killing. The story just involves a loner who lives isolated around a swamp who has a collection of pet rattlesnakes. Later, he gets revenge on some people with his snakes and also with the help of some quicksand in one scene. He carry's and transports the snakes to some people he wants to kill. It isn't one of those movies when you see hundreds or thousands of snakes or rats rampaging all over the place; it might disappoint some who are expecting that type of movie. The film has no nudity, and it also has an unfortunate and real scene at the end when the snake guy just loses it and pounds the crap out of his snakes; he just grabs and swings them against the floor, smacking the hell out of them. During the interview on the DVD, it's told that some of the snakes were already dead; however, some live ones were obviously hurt or killed. The film also has no gore. I guess the bloodiest scene in the movie is when some guy kills some of his snakes. If you want lots of action you'll be disappointed because it's slow getting started and makes you wait. The scenery with the swampy place is excellent, and I like the really good nostalgic type atmosphere. Most of the film concentrates on these two things as well as character development instead of action and violence. Because of this and some of the old soundtracks, it will seem like a dated and tedious movie to some. I thought it's really good to watch on a rainy day or at night.

The DVD extras are nice. I thought the DVD quality was good overall, but I was a little disappointed. It needs to be somewhat brighter with a little better contrast and color. Because the entire thing has nice scenery, a little better transfer would've helped. Nevertheless, it still looks good. I've got the BCI DVD, which has a nice menu screen, and the DVD case has a slip cover. The quality on the Code Red DVD is supposed to be the same from what I've read.",1474502400,2,2041,4.3994708994708995

a rodential fright film that's best remembered for Michael Jackson's hit theme song ""Ben,"" a tribute to a rat.

This one's star, West Palm Beach native Chris Robinson, portrays Seminole Indian Tim Ochopee. Disenchanted with all humanity, the returned 'Nam vet builds a shack on a remote Everglades hammock and gathers about him a surrogate family of rattlesnakes, copperheads and water moccasins. Chief among these is his constant companion, a fairly large rattler named Stanley.

One day Tim's reverie is disturbed by a visit from his former employer, Mr. Thomkins (Alex Rocco), owner of a ladies wear factory. Tim's dad, who died under mysterious circumstances, also worked for Thomkins, who's now handing Tim money to trap snakes that will be used for clothing accessories. Tim suspects Thomkins was somehow involved in his father's death plus the work he's been offered repels him, so he disdainfully tosses the cash in the swamp. Thomkins hotly says that the two goons accompanying him will soon return to hunt snakes. This is when Tim tells the three men to get off his island.

Later, a violent confrontation between Tim and the thugs leaves him badly beaten. During this fracas one of them admits they killed his father on Thomkins' orders. The balance of the story is divided between Tim's revenge on Thomkins, with snakes as the weapon, and his abortive romancing at the snake-filled hovel of the man's daughter. She saw how her dad died, knows Tim is responsible, and just wants to escape from him.

I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders!"") One of Rocco's henchmen is Miami-born Steve Alaimo, a blue-eyed soul singer with some chart success in the '60s who also produced hits for other artists.

Don't see STANLEY if you're terrified of snakes. Or, if you love scary movies AND are afraid of snakes, DO see STANLEY.

POSTSCRIPT--
Skin from Stanley the snake was eventually made into a wallet that William Grefe, the film's director, still owns.",1395273600,3,2434,5.691460055096419
8286762,5,B001CCY42A,"Throughout the ages, the serpent has been both venerated and feared, equated with 'evil' and divinity, making a potent totem as well. A lesson can be taken from the serpent, with a select few already inherently exhibiting these traits. Stealthy and deadly, they will only strike to defend themselves, their nest, or to feed. I Am reminded of a sign spotted once upon a constitutional which reads:

""Snakes may be found in this area. They are important members of the natural community. They will not attack, but if disturbed or cornered, they will defend themselves. Give them distance and respect.""

Vietnam Veteran Tim Ochopee is a misanthropic Seminole Indian living in the everglades, and just wants to be left alone with his friends - a legion of snakes, whom he pretty much considers his family. He makes a modest living supplying the local clinic with venom for antidotes. He returns home to find that his father had been killed in an accident, later to be revealed that it was actually a couple of these rotten poachers who actually did it, boasted about during a fight, which Stanley amusingly puts an 'end' to.

Even when members of his tribe attempt to convince him to return to the village to preserve the declining occupants; and even when visited by a couple other vets who offer him quite a bit of money to poach snake hides, he understandably refuses,  not to mention that His best buddy is a rattle snake by the name of Stanley.

One day Tim brings Stanley a mate he names Hazel, even acquiring two makeshift beds for them*, complete with dinner - two nice fat mice for their repast. Unfortunately, those two rotten poachers enlist the help of a boozing pill-popping psychotic hippie aptly named ""Psycho Simpson"", who unconscionably destroys the matrimonial arrangement inclusive of newborn 'squiggles' with the butt of his rifle. Upon the discovery of this travesty, Stanley and Tim see an instant end to him - right in the jugular! Then he quite literally goes up the river. Sadly, they are given a respectful resting place in the side yard. Tim realizes that the source of his troubles derive from the boss poacher, and takes care of him good, while taking his nubile daughter back to the house, which results in a bit of solipsism.

Notable scenes include the justified punishments dished out via ""Lex Serpentis"", as it were, from a stripper gone wrong incorporating biting the heads off of snakes as a gimmick with her formerly sultry routine {she and her greasy husband are bitten to death in their beds}, to the boss of the poaching ring meeting his demise in the pool, but probably the most remarkable vengeance occurred as a two-fold revenge - death by quicksand upon his father's murderers with Stanley slithering by to make sure they go under while Tim oversees.

Eventually, Tim goes a bit mad in the end, taking out some of his frustrations even on some of the snakes, who concludes as a recipient of his own beloved creatures.

Also enjoyable are the vistas of natural environment replete through the movie, which Tim enjoys going about to and fro from his cabin about the river and swamps, interacting with the various inhabitants therein. A thrill for ophiophiliacs and ophiophobes alike.

8286764,3,B001CCY42A,"I saw this in the theater in 1972 and had not seen it in the 39 years since 'til I recently rented the DVD.  Although not as ""good"" on the small screen as it was on the big screen back in the day, it was fun to see again.  Let's just say if you're afraid of snakes, there's a lot of them in this movie so you may want to proceed with caution - it could give you nightmares. Not a great movie by any stretch - the acting is only fair at best and it contains cheesy early 70's music at the beginning & end of the film during the credits. This might be considered a drive-in classic though and, double-featured with ""Frogs"" (that came out the same year), you can have a fun & slithery Saturday night late show. Aside from the film itself, one of my favorite features on the DVD is when you insert & load it into your player, this cool animated view from the perspective from a car's driver's seat comes on and your car winds into the drive-in cinema, you see other cars in there and those big drive-in speakers, and then the up on the outdoor screen is the DVD's menu!",1301961600,3,1065,4.090909090909091
8286765,3,B001CCY42A,"Disclaimer: The version of the film that I watched is included on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gorehouse-Greats-Collection/dp/B002DHACSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gorehouse Greats Collection</a>, so I cannot comment on the quality or the extras included in the package offered on this product page.  My review addresses the entertainment value of the film itself - However, since Navarre has gone out of business, and this title is out of print, the only reasonably priced version that may be available for some time is those included in Mill Creek's multi-pack.

The tagline for this film is 'Stanley will make your skin crawl!', and I have to give the film props for following through with that goal.  Of course, it's going to depend on how you feel about snakes - I feel I have a rather normal aversion to them, and watching a writhing mass of rattlesnakes, pythons, and water moccasins does indeed make my skin crawl.  In fact, I thought I was going to have unpleasant dreams after watching this snake-fest.

A young Seminole Indian named Tim (Chris Robinson, or Dr. Rick Weber of General Hospital fame) has recently returned from Vietnam, and sick of humanity, has holed up in his swamp cabin with the only friends he's capable of making - his snakes.  Of these, his closest companion is Stanley, a six-foot-long rattler that spends most of his time draped around Tim's neck.  The two of them share an almost psychic connection - or at least Stanley has developed a dog-like ability to understand Tim, to the point that when Tim is finally pushed too far by the exploiters of nature who invade his swamp, he and Stanley take revenge as a team.  That is, until even Tim crosses the boundary between right and wrong, and Stanley has to follow his own nature.

Alex Rocco is always showing up in these Crown International Pictures, and here he teams up with the star of 'Wild Rebels', Steve Alaimo - as a snakeskin belt manufacturer and a trapper, respectively.  Obviously Tim isn't going to go along with their plans to hunt and kill snakes in the swamp - and add to that an aging exotic dancer for whom Tim provides snakes and who embarks on a new act of biting the heads off her dancing partners - and you have a recipe for revenge.  But what sends him totally over the edge is a violent scene where one of the trapper's buddies, high on coke and pills, sneaks into Tim's cabin and kills Stanley's mate and their brood.  It's on then, and one by one, Tim and Stanley meet out 'justice'.

This is one of the few films on the Gorehouse Greats Collection that I would think of as 'Grindhouse' or exploitation (along with 'Trip for Teacher').  Those films are still gritty and affecting today (as well as goofy), and there are elements in the script that no modern filmmaker in his right mind would even think about touching.  One thing about '70's cinema is a shocking lack of PC sensibility - it is simply amazing to me what filmmakers and filmgoers found acceptable, especially after all the years of self-censoring we've done as a society since then.

Make no mistake about it though - that doesn't make 'Stanley' a 'good' film by most standards, and probably not even by exploitation fans' standards.  It's too PG for those who enjoy more extreme scenes, and too kooky for those who like realism.  It reminds me a bit of the 'Billy Jack' films, with its resistance against organized and conservative elements of society - except 'Stanley' uses snakes to focus our sympathies instead of a bunch of orphans, and that's a big leap for me.  There is also a scene where one of the hunters clubs several snakes to death - it sure looked authentic to me - and scenes of snakes feeding on live mice, so it's probably best that all PETA members stay away.  But for those who search out obscure cinema like this because they appreciate the occasional blast of quirky insensitivity completely absent from mainstream films, or simply because they are fascinated by snakes, 'Stanley' might be perfect.

This special edition offers some extras that are not available on the 'Gorehouse Greats' collection, primarily the commentaries and a making of featurette.  I'd like to hear the commentaries someday, as there are some scenes I'd be interested in knowing how they were filmed, but as long as the OOP price is jacked up to exorbitant levels, I'm satisfied with the Mill Creek multi-pack.  Netflix may also be an option, at least until it gets another release.

Favorite B-movie '70's moment:  The trappers hire a pill-popping psycho to help them in case Tim tries to stop them.  He shows up looking as if he'd killed and skinned a striped mattress and was wearing its hide for pants.  Fashion!",1288483200,2,4742,4.829419035846724
