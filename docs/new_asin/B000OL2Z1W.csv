8185533,4,B000OL2Z1W,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. He appears in a cameo for this film. It is enjoyable to see him in the few scenes he was in. The storyline in the film is interesting and worth watching. There is fighting and some violence, but it won't be anything out of the ordinary for those who have seen many of Shah Rukh Khan's earlier films.",1334880000,3,356,4.028169014084507
