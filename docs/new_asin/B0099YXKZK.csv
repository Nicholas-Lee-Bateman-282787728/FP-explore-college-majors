Film based on the novel of the same name by Franois Mauriac. Written by Franju and Franois Mauriac and Claude Mauriac, it stars Emmanuelle Riva and Philippe Noiret. Riva won the Volpi Cup for best actress at the Venice Film Festival and the Silver Goddess Award at the Mexican Cinema Journalists for her performance.

Thrse is living in a provincial town, unhappily married to Bernard, a dull, pompous man whose only interest is preserving his family name and property. They live in an isolated country mansion surrounded by servants. Early in her marriage her only comforts are her fondness for Bernard's pine-tree forest, which was her primary reason for marrying him, and her love for her sister-in-law and Bernard's half-sister, Anne. On Thrse's honeymoon, she slipped away from Bernard's bed to throw away a letter from Anne in which Anne expressed her love for Jean, a Jewish student. Later, when Jean leaves Anne, Thrse feels a sense of satisfaction and relief. However, Anne soon leaves.

Desperately lonely and trapped, Thrse accidentally learns that an increase in Bernard's medication makes him ill. While Anne nurses Thrse's unwanted baby, Thrse begins to experiment, taking advantage of his hypochondria and forgetfulness. Eventually she tries to poison him with arsenic, but the dose isn't fatal. Thrse's forged prescriptions are then discovered. Thrse is arrested, but Bernard refuses to press charges. She is acquitted when Bernard perjures himself for her at the trial and her politically influential father bribes a court official. On the way back to the country estate, she tries to think of an explanation to offer to Bernard.

Unable to give Bernard a proper explanation, she allows Bernard to place her in a prison of his own devising. He locks her in a bedroom and allows her only cigarettes and wine, as she slowly wastes away. Much later, he frees her for a party at which the family gathers to meet Anne's new husband, and their friends are shocked at her sickly appearance and deterioration. Bernard then moves her to Paris. Still hoping to learn the motives for her crime, he listens to further explanations, but he cannot understand. The movie recounts in flashback the circumstances that led to her being charged with poisoning her husband.

To find a French film friendly to people living in the countryside is about as difficult as to find a film which does not ridicule the police: They seem not to exist. The permanent fear in the Landes that there could be a forest fire in what is the largest maritime-pine forest in Europe is bordering
collective obsession, and that people hardly talk to each other, preferring to communicate via common silence, seems also common. Well, that's pretty much the degree to which on can understand the thinking and motivation of the natives. Were it not for the solid script, the good photography and the perfect acting - still, giving it three points (out of five) is about as much as it can carry...
