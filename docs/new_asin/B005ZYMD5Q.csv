8490066,3,B005ZYMD5Q,The story starts off slow and very predictable. It is not till the end that it gets interesting and the outcome takes a twist.,1393804800,,126,4.291666666666667
8490067,5,B005ZYMD5Q,"Called ""Super Judge Di Renjie"" in Chinese, this drama is the 4th serial made by the director and the main actors. There are two separate stories, both well written and produced. Not sure if these are original, or based on any previous Lord Di stories. By the way, Di here is pronounced Dee, per pinyin rules.  The whole name sounds like Dee Rern-je(t).
The stories take place in the 7th century but it's easy to pick up the many modern references in the show, probably a deliberate move by the show's makers and often to humorous effects. You get Cantonese and Mandarin on the audio tracks, and Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English on the subtitles.

A truly enjoyable show.  I'd watched the previous three serials (called ""Super Detective Di Renjie"" 1, 2 & 3) from these guys and this is the best one our of the four. Too bad the director and the Di actor had a fallout fight a couple years ago and they'll no longer work together on more TV works.",1376438400,,964,4.528735632183908
8490068,5,B005ZYMD5Q,"Historically correct , excellently executed easy to follow for english speaking folks due to english subtitels , done in the spirit of Van - Gulick's novels .",1368403200,2,158,4.888888888888889
8490069,4,B005ZYMD5Q,"Well, as I read it is one part of a larger series, and the pattern I meet here repeats itself in the others too. But since I saw it the first time I was not bored. The concept of smaller crimes coming together to fit a larger pattern, the matter turning into a large-scale conspiracy that threatens the whole kingdom, was quite enthralling. Jugde Dee is portrayed in his later role as the prime minister, his magistrate days over, and in favour with empress Wu, who is portrayed positively. Of course this is where evil courtly cabal can set in, incriminating the minister. He is forced to flee the capital and travels the provinces in disguise, hoping to solve the crime.
There we meet him in his role as an ingenious detective again, a part i liked a lot. For comic relief an obnoxios spoiled princess on the run is thrown in, who flees her appointed marriage to a foreign khan, and makes a niusance of herself again and again. She is a model of what the Chinese must dislike about their past nobility which can do whatever it pleases. My favourite character is Jugde Dee's niece, an accomplished kung fu fighter. Well, expect jumps and walking in the air too obviously helped along by strings-well, alright. A matter of taste. Too often, for this taste of mine also, the ingenious judge walks slowly along, explaining his thoughts, and his friends and helpers walk behind, listening in awe and obedience, merely allowed to ask. Ah, bah!
Another shortcoming is the matter of the loose ends-I suspect the original series knotted them up.
So learn Chinese those who can-this version still was a lot of fun, and I hope to get more eventually!",1361923200,2,1641,4.623287671232877
8490070,3,B005ZYMD5Q,"Having worked thru the series it is an excellent (but not outstanding) video series.  Based on the Van Gulik series of books, Detective Di is in his 60s, and a senior imperial minister (as was the truth for the real life person this was based on).  For the dedicted fans of the books, there is a bit to much wire-fu, but remember this was made for the mainland chinese audience.

Overall quite enjoyable, with excellent examples of his detective skills being demonstrated on disks 4 & 5.  However don't skip the rest as the entire convaluted tale plays out over the length of all 6 disks. Good triumphs, but has to work for it. A few story line loose ends ... but that may have been tied up on the full Chinese versions.",1343692800,2,720,4.390977443609023
