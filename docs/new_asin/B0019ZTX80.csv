3444757,5,B0019ZTX80,"I have been walking with Leslie for a little more than two years.  I first walked the ""Walk Strong"" segment as part of Leslie's on-line walk club.  As part of it you can view a different walk video online each month. You get a 2 mile walk with intervals of walking and strength training. I was sad when a new month came do did a new video as I absolutely love the Walk Strong. So I decided to purchase my own copy.

I also enjoy the 30 minute walk segment with is straight walking and if I am up for it and have the time I will also add the Muscle Mile (a shorter interval workout with weights)to it for a really well rounded workout.",1245456000,5,634,4.056

8275689,1,B0019ZTX80,"Supposed to be three sessions on the DVD and there are only two.  The one that is missing ""30 Minute Walk"" is the one I need.
The two on the tape are too strenuous for me.

8275690,5,B0019ZTX80,Three really good selections on this DVD. The 30 minute walk is an old one that I loved but no longer used because it was VHS. So happy to find it here!  I love Leslie and she is at her best here. Thanks for this great DVD!,1435536000,,223,3.74468085106383

8275692,5,B0019ZTX80,"I LOVE this DVD!  The use of weights is fabulous.  As usual Leslie's personality and enthusiasm shine through.  I also love the ""real"" people on Leslie's workouts.  Not everyone weighs 90 pounds!  I have tried just about every method of exercise, including purchasing multiple pieces of exercise equipment and nothing has kept me as engaged as Leslie and her workouts.  I actually look forward to working out.  I will definitely be purchasing more of her workouts.  I am telling everyone I know about Leslie and her Walk Away the Pounds!",1427846400,4,537,4.888888888888889
8275693,5,B0019ZTX80,"I purchased this DVD to replace a ""Muscle Mile One"" VCR tape that I had had for many years that eventually that broke.  The DVD has three different exercise routines, all very good.  My favorite is ""Walk Strong"" which combines strength training exercise with brisk walking.  This DVD actually makes it easier for me to want to exercise.  Ms. Sansone has an engaging personality and the other walkers on the video are real people who are easy to relate to.",1397952000,6,455,4.65
