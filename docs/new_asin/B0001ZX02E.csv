8019130,5,B0001ZX02E,"I'm a huge Fred Sokolow fan.  I have a few of his Fredboard Roadmaps books (the original, Jazz & Slide - all of which are excellent) and a couple of his other jazz books.

His books are always very well laid out and he gives clear, concise explanations of things, and generally his books are geared toward intermediate guitarists. I find that his explanations fill in a lot of the gaps left by more comprehensive - but less user-friendly - books.

I've been trying to learn Travis picking for ages, and it's one of those guitar techniques that feels totally foreign.  Essentially it's like learning hand independence with piano.  The point here is liberating your picking fingers from your thumb.

While I've not yet become an expert Travis picker, this video is one of the best instructional tools on the subject that I've found.  I'm not sure what the negative review is talking about - this video gives ample time to explanations, slowed down passages and practice tips, and the camera work is excellent. (plus you get a tab booklet).

For example, in the 16+ minute chapter on the first song (yes, 16 minutes for a simple song - how is that not sufficient instruction?) Fred lays it out.  He basically says that Travis picking just requires repetition of the various syncopated picking combinations until muscle memory takes over and things click.  That pretty much says it all, and when you break down the songs on this video into little bits and pieces you then get the exercises needed to learn this difficult style.  I'm not an expert yet, but I can feel it starting to click - though I don't get to practice as much as I'd like, so it's been a long process.

Fred is a great teacher, and this video is top notch.",1374451200,3,1721,4.588235294117647
8019131,5,B0001ZX02E,"Again I can only ask what was the first reviewer thinking. I've been playing 15yrs and been using Sokolows stuff for the last year, its life changing material the man is so chilled out, it feels like a magician showing you all the secrets to various acts! I'm now using alt thumb and playing melody, it takes time but I don't play patterns and thats thanks to fred. I recommend all his material, you'll learn music theory that makes sense with tonnes of short cuts that work and are based on history. In this dvd he gets you picking in a fashion that is free and leaves you with the ability to concentrate on melody and forget about your alt thumb, that becomes second nature. Great series - great tution, and very laid back and relaxing.

PS I'm an electric player switching to acoustic, to play some ole timey stuff, hence purchasing this dvd",1273363200,5,844,4.48051948051948
8019132,5,B0001ZX02E,"I can't imagine what the previous reviewer of this product was thinking about giving this video one star. He must be a total beginner who bought a video that was too advanced for him. That is a frustrating experience. I have ALL of Fred Sokolow's instruction videos and find him to be the most explicit and specific instructor teaching guitar in this fashion. I'd go so far as to say that none of Fred's videos are actually designed for the rank beginner, however. They're designed for intermediate to advanced to skilled players and are pretty well labeled as to their level. The video in question is designed for competent rhythm guitarists who want to learn ""Travis"" style fingerpicking. This is generic ""Travis picking."" That is, what's called Travis picking on the street. It is not and frankly has nothing to do with the manner in which Merle Travis actually played the guitar. There are a few videos out that address his very sophistocated style of thumb and one finger guitar playing. This video is devoted to a three finger style of playing very popular among ""folk"" musicians of the 60s like Joan Baez, Peter Paul and Mary, Judy Colins and many other players. This video concentrates on right hand technique. If you don't know basic chord forms you'll find yourself frustrated like the previous reviewer. Anyone who can strum ""Louie, Louie"" can probably learn the techniques on this video. If you can't do that however, you probably need a more basic instructional video. In that case you may want to look at Happy Traum's ""Yes You Can Play Guitar"" or any number of absolute beginner videos Traum has available. Sokolow's video is very well organized to do what it does: teach pick players a basic form of fingerpicking. Fred is an expert fingerstyle player and has many more comprehensive videos on fingerstyle technique.",1140739200,7,1832,4.856230031948882
8019133,1,B0001ZX02E,"This is a demonstration of the style but not really organized or presented as something to learn from. And where the presenter starts to sing along its good for a few laughs. The material is not organized or broken down as anything to follow, the viewer just watches him play at full speed and you really cant learn that way. The long explanation of what the style is gets pretty boring after the first 20 minutes and the demos don't give you anything to work from.  Save your money.",1107043200,8,483,4.426966292134831
