1419702,5,B00005B1YH,"This is a great little documentary about an important part of WW II, the Italian campaign, that is too often over looked. Some of the footage is a bit out of focus but other sections have some great footage. The 57 FS ""The First in the Blue"" documented in the film was the first US air group engaged in the war fighting all the way from Palestine and across North Africa. I can't imagine there are many better $5 deals out there.",1092009600,61,429,4.2439024390243905
1419703,4,B00005B1YH,"Along with ""Memphis Belle"" this fine film stands up there with the best documentary features of the era. Using wartime film equipment, (no fancy Hollywood gear!) William Wyler (Ben-Hur) did his part for the war effort, with style and class (and a little humor!). A combination of propaganda and straight up honest filmmaking, 'Thunderbolt' is a film worth buying.
Shot on 16mm Kodachrome, You won't see ultrafine images or glorious sound. The color and contrast are sometimes harsh. But this was War, and filmmaking in a combat zone isn't easy, under harsh conditions Wyler's film survived to become the true classic it is today.
Enjoy!",1055289600,76,636,5.066666666666666
1419704,2,B00005B1YH,"The only good thing about this DVD is the price! It looks like the worst kind of home-made 8 mm film shot in the forties. The color is very far from what we are used to nowadays, the focus is blurry, and generaly the picture is fuzzy, unstable and very far in quality from many other documentaries shot at the same time. The commentary is tolerable, although bombastic and tedious, but that was the trend at the time. All in all - a disappointment.",1054944000,3,448,4.345238095238095
1419705,4,B00005B1YH,"This DVD has been taken from a early-forties era documentary film made with Stateside audiences in mind.  It was probably shown in theaters before the main shows during the war years.  One of the big pluses is that the film is in color, and that the color is strikingly good for a combat film.  Directed by Academy Award winner William Wyler (best known for 'Ben-Hur' and the original documentary of 'The Memphis Belle'), the film depicts life--and death--in a P-47 Thunderbolt squadron based in Italy.  It gives the viewer a good look at Italy, not just the base itself.  The strafing runs are excellent, taken by a camera mounted in the planes on actual missions.  For a wartime propaganda film, it is quite honest and deals with the suffering of noncombatants, showing bombed-out buildings, children playing near a burned corpse, and haggard, war-weary men and women.  The aerial footage is excellent, the dialogue is good, and the quality of the picture is also good.  The film also shows the tragic results of a Thunderbolt crash quite graphically, as if to remind the viewer that war is a dangerous game and that there is never any guarantee that the pilots will return from their missions. This color film runs around 45 minutes.  It is well worth the price.",995673600,201,1265,4.792626728110599

1419785,5,B00005B1YH,"I found this film quite by accident, or by serendipity. And I had no idea that a cousin of mine, Maj. Richard O. Hunziker, was one of the featured pilots. I knew he had flown the P47s and was well aware of his war record as a superb fighter pilot. There is another William Wyler film from the war that, again, featured, our cousin when he was based in Tunis. From there they made raids into Nazi-held Italy. He made an Air Force career of it as well, retiring  as a Lt. General. To say the least, I became an instant fan of ""Thunderbolt.""
As a side story to this film, the man who would become my godfather after the war (through marriage to my mother's best friend), was a company commander during the fight at Anzio. Pinned down by the Nazis, it was a bloody mess. What I now firmly believe is, our cousin was part of the attack squadron that attacked those German positions raining hell on our soldiers there.
Years after the war, both my cousin and godfather, who had not known each other during the war, would convene at our house for dinner parties and it was there that I noticed the two of them chatting quietly with each other. I must presume my godfather and cousin were talking about those horrific times as one fought from the beach while the other fought in support from the air.
Thus, I will treasure this film for the rest of my days and I am now 70 years old.",1419292800,,1375,4.268199233716475

It is especially very well done considering that it was done using the technology available during the mid 1940s.

The quality of the film is grainy, typical of 70-75 year old WW2 vintage film.

The 56th Fighter Group which exclusively flew the P-47 recorded more air to air victories in the 8th Air Force than any other fighter group. The P-47 also produced more than its fair share of aces. The 9th Air Force used the P-47 as a fighter bomber very effectively.

The combat scene take place over Italy but the action is set in the little French island of Corsica that was the first liberated part of France in 44.

Once liberated, the island was literally invaded by the Air Force that built there many bases for bombers and figther wings. So many that the island was eventually nicknamed USS Corsica, the biggest carrier of the US Navy. From there, our war machine supported both the liberation of France and invasion and liberation of Italy.
Corsica is a big high rock towering over the seas and was easy to spot and reach by returning airplanes (10,000feet high). Its coastal bases and the sea also provided somewhat safer crash landing sites for damaged airplanes.

The combat footage is from cameras mounted on various P-47 Thunderbolts that took part in the operations described. We not only see the actual combat footage filmed from the P-47 cameras but get a view of the life of the pilot and their crew when at the airfield.

The commanding general, General Carl Spotz, does the narration and does an excellent job in explaining what is not only obvious but the thoughts that most of the pilots had at the time of a particular portion of the mission you are viewing. His narration does not convey the stress and boredom that waiting for actual combat entails. Though alluded to in earlier deployments in passing and the emphasis that what we are seeing is considered a resort to the pilots after the North African Campaign.

The film though obviously edited for the American public and does explaining and show how what a pilot sees from the air is the countryside and not the ramifications of the war on the people involved on the ground.

Somebody is lying here. Since this film is a WWII army backed film
and it took years for Catch 22 to be recognized, I think it is the writer
of the narration here. If you know anything about fighter airplanes
of WWII, you know that the B24 and the P47 were like the liberty ships,
a lot of them were made and not very well to a design that was
pretty flawed. The Mustang was the fighter that America could be proud,
but the P47 just fell out of the air for no apparent reason
even when maintained well. The P47 weren't meant to be bombers
and had no real bombsight, so they wasted a lot of bombs
when they could have been used better.
The men who flew endless missions and just weren't given any real leave
by the army air force is the true history not written by the overpowering victors with stars on their shoulders who are willing
to get other men killed for their glory.

7936220,4,B00005B1YH,This movie is a documentary filmed in 1944 following a fighter squadron using the Thunderbolt fighter bombers based in Corsica. The mission was to strangle the supply routes to the Germans in Italy. Cameras mounted in all parts of the planes were used to shoot the footage. This film is a fascinating look at the day-to-day lives of the airmen and their maintenance crews at the base and also the action during the missions they flew. This is an interesting film well worth watching.,1511049600,,483,4.761904761904762
