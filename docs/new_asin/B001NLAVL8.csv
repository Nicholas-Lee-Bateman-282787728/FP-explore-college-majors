3719451,4,B001NLAVL8,"Killer At Large is a very good documentary that explores the obesity epidemic and the major causes of obesity along with the politics, social issues and even the health problems caused by obesity. The film progresses at a very good pace and I was never bored; the people interviewed gave insightful comments that were very relevant and we get both sides of the story although admittedly the film focuses on the people who support the viewpoints of the filmmakers. The quality of the print is very good, too.

We see practically everything on this topic; this film is well done indeed. For example, the footage of former US Surgeon General Richard Carmona shows him telling audiences that ""obesity is the terror within; and unless we do something about it, the magnitude of the dilemma will dwarf 9/11 or any other terrorist event you can point out to me."" Wow, what a statement! But the facts are there to support his claims: we are inundated with medical statistics and testimony from people from all walks of life that obesity is a fantastically serious problem that merits our immediate attention. Indeed, the film begins with us meeting a twelve year old girl, Brooke Bates, who has not been able to control her weight. Her parents willingly sign her up for liposuction despite her tender age! Yes, the liposuction procedure and an additional tummy tuck work wonders for her while she exercises--until, that is, she regains the weight that she lost; and by the end of the film we learn that she's going with her parents for an even more invasive procedure even though she's still only thirteen!

And it isn't just Brooke Bates. Bill Clinton goes on record as saying that obesity is a killer; and he's right. We get great comments from Dr. Linda Kinsinger who is the Director of The VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention that ""71% of our veterans are overweight or obese;"" and people like Ralph Nader and Neil LaBute (film director and author of the book entitled ""Fat Pig"") all share their stories about the horrors of people practically eating their way into the grave. Meme Roth of National Action Against Obesity also has plenty to say on this topic and the issues surrounding it.

But there's so much more in this film. The film show how junk food companies kiss up to members of Congress and others to get their vending machines distributed practically everywhere we look; this means that we can't go too far without seeing a cue that we should be eating or drinking some very calorie-rich food. Companies like Frito Lay and McDonalds can buy their ways into everyone's home; their commercials are designed to look like regular Saturday morning cartoons and this takes advantage of the fact that very young kids under the age of eight typically cannot distinguish between commercials and regular television programming. The commercials lead young kids to believe that if they eat at McDonalds everything they will live happily ever after! In addition, I love the part in the film when one mother complains to a panel of representatives from fast food companies that their commercials are undermining her ability to teach her children to eat healthy food and to stay away from junk food. We also get comments by a school lunch worker who says that the quality of lunches is so poor because of the way the federal government reimburses schools for their lunch programs--the school must give a certain minimum of calories to each student; and if they gave a healthy lunch they wouldn't meet the calorie minimum requirement and thus they would lose their lunch program funding!

There's actually much more in this film so if you think I've given it all away and spoiled it for you I can happily assure you that this is not the case. The DVD also comes with extras; I liked the deleted scenes in particular. There is even an abridged version for educational purposes in the classroom; but hopefully teachers can show the complete version to school kids as soon as they're able to follow along.

The only thing I didn't care for is that the film doesn't focus enough on the incredible self-discipline that it really, really takes to lose weight. In many cases (but certainly not all) there simply isn't any excuse or alternative for losing weight--you need to exercise more and eat smaller amounts of food that is very healthy for you. In the past whenever I have been overweight, as I am now, this has been the only method I ever tried that worked for me when I wanted to become thinner. In addition, they show George W. Bush encouraging exercise but they do it in a way that seems to mock him and belittle his sincerity. While I was not sorry to see Mr. Bush leave office several months ago, I don't see why they should mock him for encouraging people to exercise. Otherwise this is a very good film.

Killer at Large does a fine job of exploring the serious epidemic of obesity and the terrible health problems that result from many, many people being way too overweight. I recommend this film for people studying the obesity epidemic; this film should be mandatory viewing for school kids once they are old enough to learn from it. Moreover, people who are overweight like me should watch this film and perhaps gain enough strength from it to be brave and do something constructive about losing weight.",1255651200,74,5334,4.748651564185545

But more than a scare tactic, this film educates showing food companies and marketing agencies that also contribute to the problem by clever marketing to children to consume high calorie foods.  Additional interest and humor is provided by people like Stephen Colbert that show the hypocrisy of using characters like Shrek to encourage kids to exercise while also using that same character to sell junk food.

3719469,3,B001NLAVL8,"""Killer at Large"" is the scariest documentary I've ever had the pleasure to view. Knowing that obesity is a killer is frightening enough but knowing you could also lose an arm or leg if you keep eating wrong and get diabetes is even more troubling. This movie shows how we are drinking sugar and eating highly processed foods that have very little nutritional value. Having vending machines in schools is one of the big problems discussed.

So what has caused the obesity epidemic? Is the solution really as simple as eating less and exercising more? Well not really. The real problem is that we are all stressed out either by living in a dysfunctional family or working for companies that are stressful by nature. From what the people promoting this film say, stress causes us to eat more and not burn fat that is in storage. Also listening to stressful news causes us to become fearful of life itself. So in the back of our minds we are constantly on edge, expecting the next disaster to hit.

What does disturb me a bit is how people try to always blame the government for our mistakes and for our wrong food choices. I read plenty of helpful health books that have taught me many good ways to eat. I don't rely on what the government tells me to eat.

One thing that this movie did promote was healthy exercise. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush talked about healthier ways to live with Bush demonstrating bike riding and running as good options. He felt that we all make priorities and should keep exercise near the top of our priority list.

As far as advertisements aimed at babies and small children - these things can be controlled by parents who simply don't leave their child stuck in front of a TV all day long. But beyond say age 8 children should be being taught good food choices. Parents have the control over what kids eat at this point although more TV commercials will try to influence behavior and will make children nag for what they want. So there is a battle between healthy choices and junk food choices. Hopefully a parent can explain why certain food choices are better. Already there are plenty of books that teach parents to put vegetables in regular foods.

It was a pleasure to see the school in this movie where kids are being fed an all organic whole food diet. This gave me hope to know there are things that can be done almost immediately.

Really, parents and children have to gain an understanding of what to eat and what not to eat. Some foods we may turn our noses up at may eventually be worked into the diet. Like kale salad is pretty good and you can even buy it in premade bags at your local grocery store. So exploring how we can eat more fruits and vegetables might help us to lose weight. Like apples are good with peanut butter and that can be a good snack. You can also make bean dips to eat with organic chips. Instead of always going for the premade junk food there are many great options.

So this DVD will give you an overview and then you have to do the research yourself. Here are a few books I enjoyed recently:

3719470,5,B001NLAVL8,"This is a very informative video, presenting the sad facts about American's failing health. Among people interviewed in this video is former president Bill Clinton and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. (I am mentioning these two names so you won't think the video is made by Bill Clinton.)

The facts are scary, but the thing even more scary is that nobody is doing a thing about it. I mean the society. You can ask yourself: what do your kids eat at school? Is the food promoting their health? What do you eat at lunch time at work? Maybe we can't wait for the authorities to shut down fast food restaurants, maybe we need to take actions ourselves, educate ourselves, make changes in eating habits in our families. Maybe we need to stop eating meat, eggs, dairy, soy, gluten and sugar, as well as food industry made frozen dinners, canned food and dry food, all leading to diseases. Maybe we need to adopt raw vegan foods, juice veggies, make veggie smoothies, grow sprouts on our kitchen counter or windowsill, eat more salads, veggie soups, fermented foods (sauerkraut and other fermented veggies), fresh fruits, substitute sugar with Truvia or Stevia, make food at home from scratch so we know what's in it, substitute acidic forming soda drinks and alcohol beverages with alkaline water and home made veggie juices made from organic produce. Maybe we need to grown our won veggies or join a local CSA. Maybe we simply need to take the matter into our own hands. After all it is our health, our life, our business. And we will pay the price sooner or later. We can pay for the more expensive organic produce now or the gigantic doctors and hospital bills later. It's our choice.",1360454400,,1699,4.759322033898305
3719471,3,B001NLAVL8,"The film opens with the media firestorm over the fact that a twelve year old girl named Brooke Bates, who weighed over 200 pounds, was allowed by her parents to have liposuction. After the surgery, she is shown vamping it up- extolling her newfound popularity, but then the film shows that less than a year after her surgery she has gained the weight back. The interesting thing is that the film shows that the fault is it is part nurture (Brooke eats obsessively to combat psycho-emotional problems) and part nature (her parents are not obese and the fat goes to parts of her body unaffected by the surgery). A quick Google search shows that, in the years since the film was made, Bates has become obsessed with plastic surgery and looking like a Barbie doll, but that's the subject for another documentary and review.",1359676800,3,819,4.694444444444445

3719475,4,B001NLAVL8,I found this documentary very informative.  The rising trend in obesity is going to continue well into the future and we have a responsibility to learn all that we can about the issues and how to change current legislation regarding food production and consumption.  This documentary discusses school lunches and the extreme difference between what people deem as healthy and what the USDA deems acceptable for a school lunch program.  Is the calorie count worth the added health risks?  The documentary also sheds light on the political aspect of food consumption and the attempts of the government to improve the health of all people.

The Federal government en-total has responsibility and the Department of Education should be abolished and allow local communities to govern their schools.  My child was in the school system it the 80's and 90's and took his own lunch. It is appalling what the schools are serving and offering for children to buy according to this film.  Major problems with food in America is big business, farm subsidies, government that is too big, lack of eating food in its purest form, family structure, and earth that has been overworked and laden with chemicals. Anything that is processed or in a can should be generally regarded as a ""cadaver in a can""...dead food.",1319673600,3,835,5.087591240875913

It shows how the government is involved in making big dollars at the cost of our health.  Yes, we have choices...but not in school lunches for our children. Especially in poorer communities. I'm infuriated at our greedy government.  Another documentary to watch is Burynski. It deals with cancer remedies and the big government dollar involvement. How they refuse to enable one man to get the big dollars when they could ALL 'share' in the cash cow. Its a long one but well worth the time.",1318204800,3,563,4.73469387755102
3719480,5,B001NLAVL8,"This movie hits our food supply issues from the political/social perspective.  Gov. subsidizes corn, much of the corn is used for sweeteners, this corn may be genetically engineered, this corn helps create food-like-products, these FLPs are then marketed to young people, the young people are drawn to the FLPs, they essentially become addicted due to the fructose content (fructose is metabolized in the body differently than glucose), increased fructose in the diet leads to metabolic syndrome, and now we are looking at potentially generations of very sick people.  The adult population is also in harm's way but this movie focuses more on the youth in this country.

Sadly, even if people have studied this subject like I have, they may still partake in the demand for these FLPs.  Wait until you see the scene where parents protest Sesame Street when the show begins promoting vegetables instead of cookies.  The ignorance is very disturbing.

This obesity problem is multi-faceted in that it involves personal choice, culture, ignorance, cost, politics, corporate profits, etc.  This movie provides a different perspective on the issue than Food, Inc. and King Corn (also excellent movies).  If you care about your children and do not know much about this subject, buy this movie and change your family's eating habits.  Knowledge is power...do not be a pawn to the ""food"" manufacturers.  Know what food is and what FLPs are (brocolli vs. cheese nips, alaskan wild salmon vs. fast food fish sandwich, etc.) As a marketing major AND nursing major, I understand these issues.  Watch the scene where the clever advertisers use Shrek to sell FLPs to children.  This is why I exited marketing...I could not, in good conscience, lie to people just so I could fatten my wallet.  However, some of these advertisers do not realize what they are doing.

It will be interesting to see how the country will pay for the coming onslaught of sick people.  What will happen to medicare and medicaid?  Healthcare costs and insurance will increase.  The CDC has said 1 in 3 americans will have diabetes within the next 15 years at the rate we are going.  Wow.  I could go on and on.  Buy this movie and begin to understand the issues.  If you are a pawn and refuse to change then save your money...you will need it to pay for healthcare and prescriptions as you slowly kill yourself with the western diet.",1302393600,10,2393,4.902985074626866
3719481,5,B001NLAVL8,"Killer at Large, is a very real documentary that attempts to place into perspective the plight of our country's future (through its youth) as it relates to health and nutrition.  While many have noted that it's especially important for people in dietitics to view this documentary, I actually think it's more important for those not in the field to view it.  It presents some very real problems that health professionals cannot attempt to tackle or begin to resolve without the knowledge and cooperation of the general public.  Obesity is real and the threat it poses is life threatening - changes, even on small levels, need to be made and watching this documentary and others like may initiate that spark toward real action.",1299715200,,726,4.934426229508197

3719483,4,B001NLAVL8,"Does quality of life matter?  Is it significant that the Centers for Disease Control are predicting that one of three children born today will come down with Type 2 diabetes, or that the average life span of our children will actually go down compared to their parents?

Does it bother you that billions of dollars are being made by corporations devoted to getting your children (and you) to eat high calorie, low nutrient density foods, and that your government seems happy to tell you, ""No worries... just exercise it off.""

If you answer ""yes"" to these questions, then you'll probably find Killer at Large both interesting and disturbing.  There is an obesity CRISIS.  The cause is multifaceted, but there can be no doubt that our diet plays an obvious and significant part.

Calories in, calories out.  And this dynamic interplay is affected by food availability, exercise, stress, genetics, motivation, and many other factors.  But never, never weigh (pun intended) any factor more than that initial issue of what (and how often) you put the wrong items into your mouth.

Killer at Large is a documentary.  You'll get a disturbing glimpse of 12 year old,  210+ pound Brooke Bates undergoing liposuction and regaining her weight mere months later.  George W Bush tells ""us"" repeatedly that the problem is that we need to get off the couch and exercise.  Those companies producing Twinkies and sodas are not to blame.  And his Secretary of HSS, Mike Leavitt?  I was left feeling embarrassed for my nation, that our official answer to the obesity crisis was public service announcements featuring the imaginary character Shrek imploring kids to play for an hour a day outside.  This is the same Shrek that the marketing gurus use to actually SELL obesity-inducing foods to kids!

There are some heros featured in this documentary.  Bill Clinton tells of his struggles with weight.  Arnold Schwarzenegger initiates a ban on junk food in California's schools.  Michael Pollan discusses our corn-based food system.  Senator Tom Harkin slays misleading and harmful advertising.  And many nutrition policy reform advocates get a chance to point their fingers.  Calories in, calories out.

I would have left out the sections on faith gurus having a say, and I didn't understand the initial emphasis on stress as a root cause of obesity (this didn't really appear later on in the film).

Former Surgeon General Richard Carmona stated ""Obesity is a terror within. It is destroying our society... .""

Killer at Large is meant to get you interested in the issue.  There are other books and movies that will give you a better insight into solutions.  Killer at Large is a call to arms, to combat the terror within ourselves and in society, a health crisis that IS killing more people than any outside terrorist activities.

SO... As Michael Pollan states in one of his books,  ""Eat food.  Not too much.  Mostly plants.""  Add to this the resolve to move your body.  Walk 10,000 steps a day, and measure this with a quality pedometer.  Finally, take control by turning off television commercials, most of which focus on getting you to eat unhealthy foods.

Take control, and battle the Killer at Large.",1288742400,6,3191,4.943502824858757

About a year ago, a friend of mine and I were talking about how expensive it is to eat healthy. At the time, he read a statistic that it costs 18 dollars a day to eat healthy and 6 dollars a day to eat unhealthy (on average, I don't know what the numbers are now but I can't imagine they're too much different). There is a more in-depth explanation in this video as to how that came to be.

Of course, there is also some not-too-surprising information on how the government has helped this to happen. Actually, some of it will downright disgust you.

3719485,3,B001NLAVL8,"While I've definitely seen much better documentaries about the subjects of nutrition, obesity and diabetes, Killer at Large would be a good starting point for someone who is less familiar with the topics. The use of multiple authors and the titles of their related books would be a great place for the newly interested to start a reading list. The graphic video of the 12 year old girl getting liposuction should make an impact on people who may be innured to the standard screenshots of overweight people wattling around unidentified cities. The documentary also does a good job of touching on the multiple factors wrapped up in the debate about obesity/diabetes and clearly demonstrates why the answer is far less simple than it appears at a glance. That said, it wasn't well edited and is very much an introduction documentary rather than a serious investigation or source of really informative material. I'm glad I watched it, but it won't be going on my ""need to own"" list.",1277942400,10,978,4.862275449101796
3719486,5,B001NLAVL8,"This not only discusses the urgency about health issues related to obesity, but explains the entrenched systems that perpetuate these problems.  We must not only deal with out personal choices, but those problems created by forces beyond our immediate control - the industries promoting unhealthy eating.  Obesity->insulin resistance->metabolic syndrome->diabetes are the preventable demons that substantially inflate our health care costs and will sink our nation's economy.  This presentation explains all the players which are pushing American health down a dangerous slope.",1270252800,,577,6.098765432098766
3719487,5,B001NLAVL8,"This is a well-researched analysis of how the food industry is the key culprit in making Americans obese and unhealthy.  We have been hearing about the government's concern over obesity for a few years now.  Sometimes a study would hit a news cycle, and we would hear about it for a few days.  When the attention dies down, then we forget about it.  This film's extensive use of news clips and C-SPAN hearings ensures that at least some reports and studies from the 2000s about the harm of obesity won't be buried and forgotten.

It also does a good job at showing the federal government and the USDA caught red-handed at being influenced and corrupted by the food industry.  There is a particularly effective segment in the film that addresses the federal government's ""false"" efforts to tackle the obesity problem.  In the segment, Dreamworks collaborates with the USDA and President Bush to launch a campaign to get kids outside and moving instead of sitting on the couch with the television.  Shrek is the character used in the public service announcement.  The documentary then shows how Shrek is the mascot of junk food as well.  Shrek promotes Twinkies, Skittles, and all sorts of other junk food products.  This means that the USDA and President Bush are effectively promoting the junk food as well.  Shrek is associated with ""health"" from the public service announcement about getting up and moving.  Once children have made that association, and sees Shrek on Twinkies, then Twinkies will be associated with ""health"" as well.

The film really does a good job at spelling out each argument it is trying to make.  The clean, no-narration style makes it a stronger film.",1268006400,6,1677,4.876325088339223
3719488,4,B001NLAVL8,"Great movie on the obvious problem in America, we eat too much and move too little.  Hilarious segments on the government's attempts to address the problem.  Also, a great reminder on the power the food industry has over politicians.  The story of the young girl going through countless bariatric surgeries is heartbreaking.  Overall very entertaining.",1266019200,6,352,5.345454545454546
3719489,4,B001NLAVL8,"I just watched this via NetFlix streaming/instant video (sorry Amazon...).

  Initially I was very disappointed by the poor production quality, narration (or lack of) and editing of ""Killer at Large"". It looked like a loosely constructed montage of news/video footage interspersed with interviews/original material of varying quality. It seemed more like the result of a college term project (much lower caliber than Kings of Corn) than a professional documentary. That impression remains (sorry producers... keep in mind I have no real knowledge/authority here... just viewer opinion)!

  Fortunately, some of the video content makes up for the poor production quality/editing. While I believe that exercise and diet are part of taking personal responsibility, the extent to which the food industry lobbyists, FDA and Congress sabotage this effort is disgusting. While many documentaries of this genre point this out (many suggesting conspiracy), this video has some particularly slimy footage of Washington's efforts to dilute health information and silence dissent. The marketing of a new 'healthy' message via Shrek is classic. I have always found marketing crap food to kids particularly objectionable.

 While I doubt any conspiracy exists, it is clear that the agricultural (corn) industry, oil industry by extension (fertilizers), fast food and huge food manufacturers have a common interest in maximizing profits in a way that is destructive to our collective health as a country. The healthcare industry has a huge monetary incentive to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, etc rather than prevent it. Washington's interests speak for themselves. While it is incumbent upon individuals to take action and responsibility for their own health and not make excuses, it is clear that a lot of money & effort is being spent to make sure that they make the wrong decisions... as this documentary points out.

  The documentary did seem to have a slight liberal/Democratic bias (in particular towards popular targets like the George W. Bush administration). This didn't appear to overly detract from its objectivity. No, I'm not a big fan of the Bush Administration... see a reason for both NPR and Fox News to coexist in a free country. I just don't like 'documentaries' from either liberal/conservative camps where a clear agenda overrides the presentation/subject matter. Just flame my lack of buy-in.

  I honesty don't know if I'd buy a copy of this DVD... but I think some of the content is important enough to warrant a rental (streaming from Amazon?!)...",1263081600,3,2574,5.370646766169155
3719490,3,B001NLAVL8,"Americans are overweight because they eat a diet far too high in refined carbohydrates like sugar, flour, rice and potatoes. The human body converts refined carbohydrates into body fat quickly and easily. For example, most people get hungry about an hour or two after eating a low-fat, low-protein Chinese food meal. I was disappointed to find that this documentary completely misses the boat on this important problem. Try reading Gary Taubes' ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" for a far better take on the issue.",1262908800,6,510,5.156626506024097
3719491,4,B001NLAVL8,"Killer at Large is an insightful, thorough look at America's obesity crisis. Viewers who watch this film will come away with a good understanding of the depth of this problem. The film also does a good job of explaining the corporate and political interests that oppose efforts to change the way we eat.

Killer at Large is at its best when it discusses the impact of obesity on America's children. The film details the appalling steps taken by corporate America to sell kids junk food; the film also explains the rapidly kids' declining health. Killer at Large shows Brooke Bates, a 218-pound 12-year-old undergoing liposuction in an effort to slim down - and gain acceptance from her peers at school. Bates' story tugs at the viewer's heartstrings.

The film also explains some of the efforts to fight obesity. The viewer hears about the effort to ban snack foods in schools. (Amazingly, when California institutes such a ban, there is massive resistance both from students and their parents). We also hear of a Massachusetts town that has implemented plans to improve public health by encouraging exercise and by imploring its restaurants to serve healthier food. The overall tone of Killer at Large, however, is despairing.

If I had to be critical of Killer at Large I would say that the filmmakers' thinking is questionable at times. Killer at Large contains snickers at the Bush administration's promotion of exercise and personal responsibility and its use of public service announcements as means of fighting obesity (as opposed to asking Americans to change their diets). That the filmmakers rely on criticisms from Stephen Colbert, Bill Maher, and Ralph Nader provides some clue as to the politics of Killer at Large.

For what it's worth, I think that Bush did a poor job of responding to the obesity crisis and that the filmmakers are correct in stating that we must change our diets. I also think, however, that the filmmakers' politics cause them to dismiss without apparent reflection the potential good that can come from some of the current anti-obesity programs. After the Surgeon General's 1964 statement on the ills of smoking, it took multiple programs administered over decades for many Americans to stop using tobacco; sadly, I suspect that it may take at least that long for many of us to adopt healthier diets.

Despite my quibbles, I highly recommend Killer at Large. This film will make you think.",1261353600,3,2425,4.977777777777778
3719492,5,B001NLAVL8,"Bar none, an eye opening look, shocking really, at what are youth are up against. Thankfully we can help though. We can control our destiny by making better food choice for our children.

Please watch this movie, rent it, buy it, borrow it.

You will help change the course of our present future.
