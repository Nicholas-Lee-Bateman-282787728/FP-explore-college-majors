8219452,5,B000VN76IA,"I have been researching the events surrounding the second Iraq War for several months now, and the name ""Ray McGovern"" is a name that comes up often.  Regardless of your opinions on the war in Iraq or the Bush administration, Mr. McGovern is an entertaining speaker, without being too boring or tangential (given that this is essentially a one hour long interview where he speaks off the cuff and no questions are asked).

I noticed that this documentary had a few 1 or 2 star reviews, but when I read those reviews... the low reviews were given due to the viewer not liking Mr. McGovern personally, or disagreeing with his political viewpoint, rather than actually commenting on the merit of this film.  Much like the 1 or 2 star reviews given to items simply because they arrived late or were not in stock... I think these low reviews are heavily and intentionally misleading.  Whether you are someone who knows nothing of the events leading up to the war, or someone who knows much of the untold (behind-closed-doors) story... McGovern offers a quick-paced but dense narrative, peppered with personal vignettes that illustrate his conclusions or opinions regarding persons within the Bush administration.  More than that... I found it refreshing that McGovern often speaks in terms of morality, right-and-wrong, and integrity, rather than just in terms of dry numbers or simply regurgitating the official propaganda.  When discussing a controversial war that cost thousands of lives, and when the official story (that the war was about WMD and Al-Qaeda)  vs the unofficial story (that the war was about oil) are so wildly divergent and contradictory... discussing the war without discussing the moral implications of our political decisions is almost willfully ignorant and offensive to the memory of those who lost their lives, on all sides.",1382745600,4,1845,5.089403973509934
8219453,2,B000VN76IA,I saw this man speak and confronted him for retiring from the CIA instead of standing up back in the sixties due to the CIA and their horrific activities. He told the audience their are two CIAs and he wasn't aware of what the other CIA was doing! How sad all he has to do is stand up and take responsibility for his actions. Mr. McGovern could then apologize and pursue his second career without  hypocrisy making amends though good deeds with honesty. Some of us did take a stand.....and still do with a clear conscience.

8219454,5,B000VN76IA,"McGovern was a CIA analyst for 27 years. The information he supplies here has been confirmed by many people in a position to know what happened. McGovern tells us about the lies from 3 US administrations. He discloses the truth about the Eisenhower administration, which sent the Dulles brothers to Iran to create a disturbance on the streets of Teheran to oust an old man who had just been elected president and replace him with the Shah. Many Americans don't understand why the Iranians hate us, but they should.
Next came Richard Nixon, Eisenhower's Vice President, who convinced the Chilean air force to bomb the Presidential Palace and kill the recently elected Salvador Allende, who was replaced by General Pinochet, who killed many young people and buried them in unmarked graves. These were the ""disappeared"" whose mothers marched on the streets of the capital in a desperate effort to find their murdered children.
Then there was the Reagan administration, which sold weapons to Iran and used the cash to hire the mercenaries known as the contras who failed to remove the Sandinistas from Nicaragua (they are still there).
Finally, there was the George Bush/Dick Cheney administration that lied about nuclear weapons in Iraq which did not exist.
Do you see a pattern here?
NOTE: McGovern did not supply all the details mentioned above, but indirectly alluded to some of them. Several incidents were not dealt with in the DVD, such as the mysterious explosions on airplanes carrying the presidents of Panama and Ecuador in the same time frame. Most experts believe that the CIA planted the bombs which brought the planes down.",1368230400,2,1634,5.011029411764706
8219455,1,B000VN76IA,"The video starts out neutral enough, but that is only because Mr. McGovern is relating agency history.

Factual problems start occurring in the ""Why the Hate Us"" segment. I give him credit for trying to blame only the right-wing political parties of Israel for being the source of much of the Palestinian people's problems. Most critics drop all pretense of fairness and tend to criticize the entire nation. Unfortunately, the Islamic terrorists do not make any such distinction -- they just blame all the Jews for their problems. Not Israelis -- Jews. Often it's Jews everywhere in the world. Mr. McGovern doesn't mention that.

""Killing Jews is worship that draws us close to Allah"" - Hamas music video

Mr. McGovern also regales the viewer with a story of how an Israeli bulldozer operator deliberately backed his bulldozer over the American activist and Hamas poster child, Rachel Corrie, in Gaza. Mr. McGovern claims she was standing in its path to prevent it from demolishing a Palestinian home. He lists this as another reason why they hate us (viz. the bulldozer was made in America).

The video takes a mawkish turn when he shows the viewer a green rubber band he wears on his wrist in her memory. It's disappointing to see a former intelligence analyst readily accept such a story without any measure of skepticism or criticism. Maybe it's just me, but were I a bulldozer operator, I wouldn't run down someone deliberately -- even if I was having a frustrating day -- because the attendant paperwork wouldn't be worth the trouble.

On August 28, 2012, five years after this video was recorded, a judge ruled that the death was an accident for which the victim was responsible, and absolved the IDF of any wrongdoing. The judge also stated that the IDF's mission that day did not include, in any way, the demolition of homes.

The judge said, ""I rule unequivocally that the claim that the deceased was intentionally hit by the bulldozer is totally baseless. This was an extremely unfortunate accident. I reached the conclusion that there was no negligence on the part of the bulldozer driver. [...] She [the victim] did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done. She consciously put herself in harm's way.""

The real reason why they hate us is no secret. In an al-Qaeda videotape released in October 2001, in which the lives of millions of Americans were threatened, four demands were made:

* raise a hand against the Jews in Palestine; not the Israelis -- the Jews
* lift the embargo against the Iraqi people
* leave the Arabian Peninsula
* stop supporting Hindus against Muslims in Kashmir

See? It's not all about the Jews, despite what Mr. McGovern says. Ironically, Mr. McGovern spends the last half of the video complaining how unprincipled and dishonest his colleagues in the CIA and the government were. I'm not saying Mr. McGovern is like those colleagues, but I can't shake the nagging suspicion that I'm being taken for the proverbial ride vis-&agrave;-vis his take on Israel and the true motives of Islamic terrorists.

I would have liked for him to explain the Madrid, 3/11/2004, train bombings. Spain, a country with:

* a pro-Palestinian stance
* a paucity of Jews
* a history of providing diplomatic cover for the Palestinian cause in the UN

Despite a history of being squarely in the pro-Palestinian camp, it could not inoculate itself from a bus bombing by Islamic terrorists.

Mr. McGovern also cites Al Jazeera as a credible news source. What? Mr. McGovern spends a large amount of his time in this video telling the viewer about the evil oil interests that drove the U.S. and her allies into a series of unnecessary wars and military misadventures; yet he doesn't mention that Al Jazeera is a TV network that is owned by a government that is nothing more than a giant oil producer. Oil -- the very fuel that is the cause of so much strife and harm to the planet on so many levels -- or so the legend goes. In 2010, WikiLeaks revealed a State Department cable from December 2009 that labeled Qatar as the Middle East's ""worst"" participant in counterterrorism efforts.",1362787200,2,4131,4.809590973201693
8219456,3,B000VN76IA,"This  might be better for someone who is younger or not as well informed on the subject, but for myself, there wasn't too much here that I didn't already know or suspect.

Here's the scoop. Ray McGovern has worked for the CIA for 25 or so years and he left because he saw the corruption from its original design and intention and simply did not want to be a part of it. He talks somewhat freely of its history and some of the darker moments.

There is some very good information given and it did fill in a lot of details, for me, on some of the agency's dirtier, clandestine operations. This would include the overthrow of various governments, assassinations, and providing misinformation for starting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But anyone who is of an age to have seen their thumbprint on the JFK assassination pretty well knows these aren't a good bunch of guys. It's as though there is this government outside the government that lives outside our laws and does pretty much whatever needs to be done to make certain American business interests are kept healthy.

As in the other videos in the series it's very simple. McGovern sits in a chair and talks unscripted. It works as well as it can given the speaker. I found him a bit annoying in that his delivery was a bit ""cute."" It were as though he was speaking to children and that didn't sit well with me. This might be good....even great for the right viewer, but if you're at all decently versed in the subject it might not hold much for you.",1359072000,2,1505,4.461818181818182
8219457,5,B000VN76IA,"Ray McGovern, a 27 year veteran CIA intelligence analyst, speaks out about his experiences on the analytical side of the CIA, and the politicization of the agency starting around 1968. His premise is that the agency was ""born with a birth defect"" in its original charter; the proviso that essentially established the covert operations side of the agency. Chronicling the overthrow of governments, starting with the duly elected and popular Mossadegh presidency of Iran in 1953 and the installation of the highly repressive regime of the shah and his Savak secret police, and moving forward through additional governments replaced by the USG because they were not in synchronization with America's need to expand her power and influence over the human and natural resources of the world to maintain an unsustainable lifestyle and level of consumption here at home. The complete ""Speaking Freely"" series of DVDs is well worth your time, providing concise insights into various aspects of our nation's policies that are not good for anyone except for a moneyed elite sitting at the top of the financial pyramid of world economic power. The spread of corporatism has not been good for America in the long run, and has certainly not been good for nations on the receiving end of the hegemonic power of the American Empire. American citizens can continue to blithely go about their daily lives, relying on the corporate media to keep them informed, or they can choose to get involved in a bit of independent study and research to learn what is really going on behind the daily news, and then become a part of the force for positive change in the world in which we live.",1350864000,4,1663,4.92170818505338
