8731443,5,B014N4BSAE,"Visited Disney World several times through the years, and one of my favorites has always been the Carousel of Progress. This DVD gives you a lot of the background about the ride as well as actual ""ride throughs"" of the ride itself. Interviews with people from Disney who created the exhibit were really interesting too. Could not be happier with this purchase!",1474243200,,360,4.82258064516129
