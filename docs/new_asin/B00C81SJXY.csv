We talked for a long time and he is truly blessed with knowledge and understanding of the Good Book. I have since watched the series among others of his video series. He has a compelling look at the end of time with Armageddon and the coming of Jesus.

I highly recommend getting this. $399.99 is worth it in my opinion but you can find it cheaper at www.endtime.com

I do not work for or have any other dealings with him other than sharing a flight with him. He is a vary down to earth person who is easy and open to talk to.",1415232000,3,624,4.10655737704918

I hate when they try to really overcharge for something. It shouldn't be allowed.",1413244800,3,135,5.181818181818182
8578565,5,B00C81SJXY,This is an amazing teaching from Irving Baxter about End Times.  I don't have time to go to College to learn about what the Bible says about the End Times and this collection helped me to understand it.  If you want to learn about which times we are living and what is coming you need to get this series.  I will continue looking for more DVDs like this one.  It is great!!,1366329600,15,373,4.138888888888889
