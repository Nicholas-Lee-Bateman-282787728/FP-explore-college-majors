8111535,2,B000EN8CJO,"I love Metallica and I love the DVD's that talk about various artists songs, and how to play them. But here is my main gripe with a majority of these kinds of DVD's, including this one: They don't include ANY of the second guitar parts for most of the songs! Let me give you a specific example:

On ""Until It Sleeps"" there are obviously two guitars playing, along with some overdubbed stuff. So James and Kirk playing (different parts), plus at least one overdub in some parts. In this ""in depth analysis"" they ONLY include James' part for the ENTIRE song, except the solo. So that second harmony chord part you hear on the CD is completely absent here.

And it's the same for all the other songs as well. You are getting anything BUT an in depth analysis, and if you already have the sheet music for these songs, this adds absolutely NOTHING of value to it, so skip it.",1238976000,,870,4.39751552795031
