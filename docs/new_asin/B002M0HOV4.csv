3950292,1,B002M0HOV4,IMO not so good.  I love Fredric March but he does not do Scrooge any justice.  Could not even finish watching the movie.,1262476800,2,121,4.217391304347826
3950293,1,B002M0HOV4,I purchased this version of The Christmas Carol to add to my collection.  It did not live up to my expectations and has been put in File 13.,1261526400,3,140,4.0
3950294,3,B002M0HOV4,"Very interesting version of the Scrooge story. Originally done on the CBS SHOWER OF STARS in 1954, a monthly series that alternated with CLIMAX. It has a great cast; March and Rathbone were both major stars from an earlier era who had matured into wonderful character people. Bernard Herrmann did the score, a couple of years before the first Hitchcock
film. The adaptation is just like all the rest, very faithful to Dickens. It's really great to finally get to relive this thing. I think CBS ran it two times, but I hadn't seen it since '55.
Now, somebody needs to find the original live-action version of the musical version,THE STINGIEST MAN IN TOWN, from NBC in '56?. Here, Rathbone is Ebeneezer, and the rest of the cast is really impressive. And the score is really nice. I have the lp. A cd was supposed to appear a few years ago, but it didn't show up. The is an animated version, which sues the title and some of the songs, but it isn't as effective.",1261353600,4,960,4.491428571428571
3950295,5,B002M0HOV4,I am tickled pink that this movie has finally come out on DVD.  My sister has a video tape (VHS) of the show and it was being warn out due to age and times used. The picture transfer was better than that of the video tape. I whole hearty recommend this tape if you are a Fredric March fan,1261008000,,288,3.8813559322033897
3950296,3,B002M0HOV4,"This is a surprisingly delightful take on the classic Dickens' tale.  Shot in the late fifties (and in color, I believe, although this DVD is not in color), the production values are extremely good for the time.  Fredric March makes a wonderful Scrooge - despite a ridiculously big nose. The doubling  of the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Present with Scrooge's lost lady-love and nephew Fred playing the dual roles is a nice innovation. Basil Rathbone makes for a haunting, understated Marley with chilling music underscoring his post-mortem agonies.

And speaking of music the real ""star"" of this treasure of the early years of televison is the wonderful score by the wonderful Bernard Hermann. As hinted at by another reviewer on this board, the Tiny Tim song is one of the most beautiful, tender and touching Christmas songs ever written.  The lyrics equal the melody and both combined truly touch one's heart.  The other songs are also memorable, especially the song for the opening sequence.  And there is an extended shot of Scrooge's face (with the Tiny Tim song sung by full chorus to accompany the shot) that was very brave on the director's part and shows an incredible range of emotions playing across Scrooge's face as he reflects on years wasted and the reborn years to come.  Fredric March displays truly great acting in this daring, imaginitive, non-verbal, extended moment.  It is a moment totally unique to all other Scrooge adaptations. And this entire version concludes with a fantastic shot that will definitely move you - unless you are made of stone. There are faults:  Tiny Tim isn't tiny and the American accents are distracting to the time and place being depicted.  But these are small matters.  This is 50 minutes of pure gold from the Fifties - and for the low price of the item, you can't miss.  Highly recommended!",1260748800,35,1844,4.871794871794871
3950297,3,B002M0HOV4,"This is a television program probably shot on video tape.  The technical quality is surprisingly good for being over fifty years old.

They had to cut out many of my favorite portions to make it fit in 30 minutes of story with the 20 minutes of singing solos and duets to make a total of 50 minutes.  Most dramatizations are 60-90 minutes long without any singing interludes. One example of things cut out is the late partner's face on the front door where the knocker usually was.  Another is the dressing gown hung on the wall and looking like it was occupied.

This is a US television production and lacks the ""Britishness"" of the original book and British dramatizations of the book.

All in all well worth the time to watch it once, but it may not stand the test of time for you if you have some of the British productions on DVD.",1260576000,29,835,4.3896103896103895
3950298,3,B002M0HOV4,"This ""Christmas Carol"" is an early TV version from 1954 with Fredric March as Scrooge (he won an Emmy) and Basil Rathbone as Marley.  It's not a bad effort for TV for the time, but rather dated by today's standards.  (Scrooge even tries to refer to hell, but was not allowed to say the word on TV at that time which leads to an unintentionally funny moment.)
The background music is by Bernard Hermann (of Hitchcock Psycho fame) and is the best part about this version (listen to the spooky chorus underneath Jacob Marley's scene).  But the actual songs (also by Hermann) are less than memorable (especially the song of Christmas Present).  However, the two original carols, sung by the outstanding Roger Wagner Chorale are great (if not time-appropriate to the story).
As for the acting:  Fredric March was an outstanding actor, but he's trying too hard (and there are several gestures thrown in over the hour that are over the top).  However, I think it was well received at the time (winning an Emmy).  The story is rather bare bones (this version is only an hour--with songs), but still makes it's point.
This version is basically for those old enough to remember it, or those interested in TV of the time (or perhaps Bernard Hermann fans--who knew he did TV?).  Perhaps also for those who are Christmas Carol completists.  Look for Bonnie Franklin's first TV acting role (as one of the Cratchit kids).
This version, however, should not be the only version of this story you have.",1257206400,129,1484,4.72093023255814

3950304,1,B002M0HOV4,"There was too much singing in it for me.  It started off singing at the beginning which clued me in that this might be a musical.  There are only a handful of musicals I will watch and this isn't one of them.

The 1938 MGM version with Reginald Owen is the one I remember seeing on TV every year and always wanted to get.  With so many versions it's difficult to figure which one is better.  I've never seen this sing-a-long version from 1954.  Just like Scrooge shutting the door because he was annoyed with the singing I did the same thing with this movie. I couldn't stand it anymore and played the 1938 version instead.",1512518400,2,623,4.327586206896552

3950315,2,B002M0HOV4,"SPOILER ALERT!

My wife and I both find most of the music in this version annoying.  The exception is the song carolers sing, accompanied by a flute, about ""this darkest day of winter,"" and ""holly, pine, and mistletoe.""  I find this song quite catchy.  As far as I'm concerned, it's the highlight of this adaptation.

There are some odd exclusions and changes in this adaptation.

First of all, the first people to visit Scrooge in his office are the two gentlemen seeking a charitable donation.

After Scrooge shows them the door, he tells Bob to clean up in the five minutes remaining before closing time.

Then Fred startles Scrooge by bursting in and wishing Scrooge a merry Christmas.

After showing Fred the door, as well as Bob, Scrooge locks up, and takes his strong box home.  The tavern scene and the scene with the door knocker are missing.  Instead, the camera cuts to Scrooge's chambers where his housekeeper opens his window to let the Christmas carols in (unrealistic since Dickens' version of this night was so bitterly foggy and cold).  She turns down Scrooge's bed, and lets him know his supper is ready.  He curtails her Christmas wish as she departs.  She never appears again, in this adaptation.

Jacob Marley appears to Scrooge, and foretells the coming of three other spirits.  Then he shows Scrooge a ledger, which he throws onto the floor, right before he leaves.

Scrooge seems to pass out in a corner; then he notices the ledger, and, apparently, realizes Jacob Marley's ghost really was there.  He jumps in bed and draws the bed curtains.

Later, the Spirit of Christmas Past appears to him.  He mistakes her for Belle, with whom he was in love as a young man.  The same actress, Sally Fraser, plays both roles.  The Ghost shows him Mr. Fezziwig's Christmas Ball, where he sees Dick Wilkins.  He also sees himself as a young man, singing a duet with Belle.  The instrumental accompaniment seems to be a harp instead of a fiddle, in Dickens version.

Then Scrooge sees Belle leaving him.  He gets upset, and the Ghost disappears.

Scrooge mistakes the Ghost of Christmas Present for Fred; the same actor, Ray Middleton, plays both roles.  He looks more like a muscular, young elf in tights than the fat man in a green robe described by Dickens.  He sings to Scrooge, and shows him a vision of the Cratchits at home on Christmas Eve, instead of Christmas Day.  They play Yes and No, and mock Scrooge as the bear-like creature, instead of the people at Fred's Christmas Dinner Party, which is never shown in this adaptation.

Then Scrooge finds himself alone with a black crow in a cemetery.  No Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appears.  Perhaps the crow is intended to be the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.

In the cemetery, Scrooge discovers, on his own, his own tombstone, with the year 1843 inscribed on it.  Then he sees Tiny Tim's tombstone.  He begins to cry, and wail, and pat Tim's tombstone, only to wake up patting his own headboard, back in his chambers.

He gets up and opens his window, to enjoy fresh air and sunlight, and he asks a boy outside what day it is.

When the boy tells him that it's Christmas Day, Scrooge simply turns around and gets ready to go out, instead of sending the boy to the poulterer's or anything.

Outside, Scrooge crosses paths with the gentlemen who were seeking a charitable donation the day before, and he apologizes to them, and gives them some money, the quantity of which seems to impress them.

Then he invites himself to Bob's house on Christmas Day.  He promises to raise Bob's salary, and help him get the medical care Tiny Tim needs.

Then Bob introduces his wife and children to Mr. Scrooge.  He only has five children in this adaptation.  The middle boy is missing. Belinda seems to be the eldest daughter, Martha perhaps the youngest, and the other girl is given a name:  Susie.

Tiny Tim ends the show by saying, ""God bless us, everyone!""

There is never any indication that Scrooge intends to visit Fred, and the entire scene at his office on the day after Christmas is missing.

Unless you're an avid Dickensian Christmas Carol aficionado like me, I recommend you skip this one.",1487548800,,4162,4.652472527472527

3950329,1,B002M0HOV4,"The worst production of Dickens's Christmas Carol ever. Flat. Grossly abridged (only 2 ghosts for example). Most acting is subordinated to allow for questionable choral interludes. Poor integration and interactivity of the performers. The entire literary impact is lost. March's make-up puts Fagin's (Oliver Twist) nose to shame (perhapsas a not so subtle anti-semitic jab). One shining attribute: the period trappings are fairly spectacular.

3950330,3,B002M0HOV4,"Two time Academy Award winner Fredric March played Ebenezer Scrooge in this rendition of ""A Christmas Carol"" in a Shower of the Stars"" series with Basil Rathbone as Jacob Marley; Bonnie and Judy Franklin as Martha and Susan Cratchit; Bob Sweeny as Bob Cratchit; and Sally Fraser as Christmas Past Ghost. Sally Fraser's singing is dubbed by the great Marilyn Horne. Bernard Hermann was composer.

This DVD is an adequate special of the Charles Dickens' classic. Sadly, there are no special features. I was amazed to see a young Bonnie Franklin as Martha Cratchit at 10 years old in the production. Fredric March does a terrific job in playing Scrooge and earned an Emmy nomination. Basil Rathbone was fine as Jacob Marley.

Bob  Cratchet would never have played a game with his children that put down Mr. Scrooge - that is out of character for the way Charles Dickens intended according to the book. This happens frequently.  The song sung between Scrooge and his fianc sets the tone that they are in love yet as soon as the song is over, she breaks up with him.  Also, there were only two ghosts in this adaptation.  There was no ghost to represent Christmas of the future - just two very shaky tombstones.

3950373,2,B002M0HOV4,"Typical candy-coated, 50-ish television musical, pop-operatic production of this classic tale. Somewhat comical actually. Not so much aimed at developing the story based on the book as much as putting on a hammed up, theatrical program showcasing vocal talents of the  day. The quaint musical numbers weaved throughout this rendition only distracts from the development of the Ebeneezer Scrooge character with whom we've come to have a fond hate-love relationship with as he eventually embraces the true meaning of Christmas. Fredric March, a great actor in his own right, does not sing at all during this ""program"". The contrast between his acting expertise and the musicale feel of this version make him appear to overact his character. Perhaps if his Scrooge would have sang a song at the end of the program, it would have better fit the format here and would have worked towards his realization of the magic of Christmas.

This interpretation of the classic Scrooge tale is a light-hearted, musical play from the early days of black & white 1950's cinema.",1423180800,,1059,5.080459770114943

This is basically a musical (fine singing, with the Roger Wagner Chorale,  as others have stated, but cheaply produced.  with the story's being almost obliterated. You will find yourself totally frustrated if you know the story as to its gutting. On top of this, the great Basil Rathbone gives a hammed-up performance as Marley's ghost which really surprised me,

Frederick March's performance was adequate. I think the Emmy was given for sentimental reasons both for our love of this story (when it's actually told!) and appreciation of March's excellence throughout his career.

The Albert Finney musical, in contrast, tells the whole story. I am giving my copy of this one away.

I am going to watch the Alastair Sim version now, to get this one off my mind!

Some would say that's all that Scrooge was, but if you compare Reginald Owen's portrayal (or the superlative color version starting George C Scott), it becomes obvious that Fredric March's Scrooge is cartoonish.  His emotions are over-emphasized, his movements are wooden, and the screenplay falls short of the genius of the book.

The definitive black and white version stars Reginald Owen!  The very best of the color versions stars George C Scott, and his portrayal of Scroige excels above all the others by a mile!

I found the plot chopped up to allow time for the choral numbers and for Fred March to needlessly emote.  For example, there's no Marley door knocker and no ghost of Christmas future to speak of.

On the plus side, it reminded me a lot of the TV specials of the late '50s and early '60s - I half expected Fess Parker to appear at any moment.  Also, the video quality was pretty good, though the audio was a bit muddy throughout.

I have studied Fred Guida's wonderful book ""A Christmas Carol and it's Adaptations"" so I had a pretty good idea of what to expect. I bought this version because I am a serious collector. As far as this version goes, it is definitely not a favorite of mine. At the end there is a painfully LONG continuing shot of Scrooge sitting at the Cratchet table while music plays. It is an awful thing to do to any actor, have such a very long, continuous close up. The other scene that was difficult was the Ghost of christmas present's song ""A Merry christmas"". It was so loooong and horrible that I was ready to throw something at the TV screen. I agree with another post that it should not have been a musical because they were trying to tell the story in less than an hour and the music did nothing to the story except cause major scenes to be completely left out. Instead we get songs that add nothing to the story that we have to painfully sit through.

I love musicals, but this was very bad, singing was beautiful, but it took away from the storyline and left little time to tell the story in one hour.  In the interest of being concise, the singing should have been eliminated because so much of the Christmas Carol scenes, which to me were essential to really understand the transformation of Scrooge, were gone.  Basil Rathbone was a great actor and one of my favorites, but his talent was wasted here, anyone could have done his Marley.  Scrooge was OK, but at times when he would give that crazy grin confused me and seemed inappropriate.  I fast forwarded through the singing of Belle and Ebenezer and decided this would be the only time I watched this version of one of my favorite Christmas stories.",1347321600,4,816,4.645833333333333

I actually had to fast forward through parts of it because it was so inane and goofy.  I just wanted to warn people that maybe wanted to see a different version. Don't bother!

An exception was ""Playhouse-90"". I remember seeing this show with my Parents in color when very few shows were available in color. It's great that this hour long show was preserved but unfortunate that the surviving tape was not in the original color form.  I've had the VHS version for years but it has become very worn and originally was not the best reproduction media so I'm tickled to have purchased a DVD version.",1324425600,2,664,4.61864406779661

And the stars are not wooden (ok, maybe Rathbone could've been more dramatic without being a bit over-the-top - and, yes, March could've used a normal nose). This was from 1954 and is excellent quality. Far better than the washed-out multi-generation copies we usually get. Leaving in period commercials would've been nice but can't have everything. Even so, TV shows had to fit into time slots, hence cuts. I would've thought people would have known this but, then, those are the same people who think that ""Dumb and Dumber"" (the movie, not Bush & Cheney) is a classic! Get this and see what TV once was instead of the dumbed-down tripe we get today.",1322611200,,727,4.732283464566929
3950464,4,B002M0HOV4,"This is really a wonderful production and very well done. It's a serious take on the story - I doubt it could be made today.

Fredric March inhabits Scrooge. It's a performance unlike any other Scrooge or any other by March. Understated but not boring. I really was surprised by just how well he does. Rathbone is also an understated and pitiful ghost of Marley. His screen time is short, but effective. He doesn't try to make the most of it, if you catch my drift. He plays his part effectively and is gone. Today, any director working with an artist of Rathbone's talent and notoriety would feel obliged to somehow work his presence into additional scenes. That doesn't happen here, and it's refreshing.

This production is quite daring in what it attempts and achieves. Without giving anything away, I will say that the very end of the show is unprecedented in the demands it puts on March in an extended shot that would never be attempted on TV these days.

The rest of the cast is also very good. There's not a weak link. No mugging from anybody, either.

Bernard Hermann's music is just perfect in that it foots the bill without drawing undue attention to itself. It tends to the operatic, or maybe, operetta-ish. In addition to the incidental/background music (most of which has a note of foreboding to it), it's striking to realize that all of the music is original. That includes Tiny Tim's Xmas song (reprised at the end by the chorus), a duet for the young Scrooge (tenor) and his fiance (soprano) (here called Belle, and sung by a young SOPRANO Marilyn Horne), a buffo baritone song for the Ghost of Xmas present (which turns up later in the show with a few catches sung by none other than Fredric March), and a Christmas Carol sung at the beginning of the production by the chorus (the Roger Wagner Chorale).

The DVD itself is very basic. Contrary to the blurb on the DVD case, there are no interactive menus and there is no intro by William Lundigan included in the video. The disc goes in your player and one option comes up - Play. I watched it through my BluRay player, so I don't know if there are options available if played in a DVD player.

Finally, I have to believe this show was shot on film and isn't drawn from kinescopes. The quality of the picture is simply too clear and steady to not have been a film production. It was shot by DesiLu, who I believe were using film on ""I Love Lucy,"" so why not for this production as well?

Definitely a sleeper and worth much more than the $3.98 it cost me from amazon.",1321747200,2,2535,4.474025974025974

Then as an adult I got to thinking about seeing this version again and several years ago had a good friend record all the Scrooge/Christmas Carol type productions she could find on cable at Christmastime and sadly after watching all of them, none of them were this one from school.

For me, Frederic March and Basil Rathbone will always be the definitive Scrooge and Marley (though March's brilliant performance could have done without the all-too-obvious oversize fake nose). The Bernard Herrmann score is delightful and features one absolute gem in Tiny Tim's solo, ""And Bless Us Every One.""
I have just one critical comment about this DVD edition. The original ""Shower of Stars"" intro, commercial break to display the new 1956 Chrysler models, and conclusion--all with William Lundigan--have been edited out. These segments were included in the previous VHS edition of this show and added much to my enjoyment, giving the production an unmistakable 1950's TV feel. (By the way, despite the ""in color"" announcement at the beginning, this edition is in black & white--the way 99.99% of us saw it in 1955 anyway!)
I guarantee, however, you won't be disappointed by March's Scrooge and the tuneful score. This show might well become for you, as it is for me, a most beloved Christmas tradition.",1265760000,2,1111,5.1098901098901095

Also, they arrive in 2 separate boxes. One didn't have any paperwork at all. No packing list or any information on three of the DVD's.

But there is NO WAY to contact Amazon that I could see on the site. How does a person contact Amazon to cancel a purchase they didn't make. It was charged to my credit information from a recent purchase.

THIS PRACTICE IS WRONG!!!!!!!!!!
