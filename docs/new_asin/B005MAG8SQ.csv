4834703,5,B005MAG8SQ,"My 3 Year-Old loves Dinosaur Train, and we got a series of these DVD's for a long road trip.  They were awesome and he was in heaven.  We got a few of the Dinosaur Train figurines to accompany him in his car seat, and he loved it!  These DVD's are structured just like the TV shows, but run back-to-back with multiple episodes.  Two thumbs up!",1344297600,7,343,4.230769230769231

4834717,5,B005MAG8SQ,"Our 3.5 year old son is obsessed with trains and just starting to like dinosaurs. He had seen 'Dinosaur Train' on PBS a couple of times and liked it. I ordered this DVD as a special car treat for our 1700 mile trip this summer. He absolutely loved it! Nothing like hearing your 3 year old giggling in the backseat on a long trip. There were also quite a few episodes in the DVD, which was awesome.

 We're going to suggest other 'Dinosaur Train' DVDs as gift ideas for his birthday.",1438300800,2,482,4.285714285714286

4834736,5,B005MAG8SQ,My 2 year old (soon to be 3) LOVES Dinosaur Train!  The stories are so cute and educational.  We don't let our son watch actual TV so these PBS videos are great to give him the down time while teaching him things all at the same time.
