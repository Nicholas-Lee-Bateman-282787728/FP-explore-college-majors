7904920,5,B000006QV1,"This two hour video is an awsome history of the United States Marine Corps.  A&E chose the right person, Fritz Weaver to narrarte it.  The video covers the Maraine Corps beginning in November of 1775 to the Marine Corps victory in the First Gulf War. You'll see the Marines fighting in World War I, their years between the wars.  Fritz Weaver narrates with style and will take you on the journey with the fighting Marines in the Pacific. You'll be on Guadalcanal where the Marines fought a ruthless enemy, and the Navy and Marines won a significant battle in 1942.  You'll see the Marines at Tarawa in the GIlbert Islands in 1943.  Naval gunfire support under the command of Rear Admiarl Harry Hill blasted Betio Island.  As the battle for the island raged, Marine Corps General Julian Smith radioed, ""Issue in doubt"".  The last time a Marine sent those grim words was moments before the fall of Wake Island.  You'll see the Marines with a Navy Corpsman raise the flag atop Mount Surbachi during the fighting for the island of Iwo Jima in 1945. The terrible visitation of two atomic bombs brought the Mairnes battle in the Pacific to an end, but it was a brief end. They found themselves fighting again five years later, fighing Communist North Korea to defend South Korea.  Witness their amphibious landing at Inchon on September 15, 1950.  Spearheaded by the First Marine Division, the Marines caught the North Koreans completely by surprise, they could not mount an effective defense and as a result 13,000 Marines were in the city by midnight.  You'll see the Marines fighting the enemy in Vietnam, at Caison then follow them through Vietnam and witness them deploy the largest expeditionary force to defeat Saadam Hussein.

Don't put this show on if you do not have the two hours plus to watch it through.",1123891200,2,1810,4.747603833865814
