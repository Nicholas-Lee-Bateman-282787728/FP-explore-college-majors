7926652,5,B00004Y6AX,"This is another superb Australian comedy that in my opinion is much better than another great Australian comedy""Strictly Ballroom"",but that's just my opinion. Anyway,both movies are highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1122249600,2,220,6.892857142857143
7926653,4,B00004Y6AX,"From Australia a truly unique musical built around an actor who has the amazing gift, for a middle-aged Aussie male, to sing just like Billie Holiday!  The story is structured around this gift and plot wise not much but the musical numbers are well staged and his singing carries the light froth of a tale.  It's all in good fun and enjoyable.  The R-rating is for 2 expletives that are totally unnecessary.  Enjoy the music.  It's comparable to LITTLE VOICES.",970358400,6,460,4.7
