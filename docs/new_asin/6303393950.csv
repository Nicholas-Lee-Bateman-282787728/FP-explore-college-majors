7845890,5,6303393950,"...With the term ""single"" taken from the days of 45-rpm records, when you'd go into the record store and buy a specific song instead of the whole album. The video single concept has been tried a few times. That's why this tape lasts just 6 minutes, it's the music video of Jeff Foxworthy's hit, Redneck Stomp, plus a little intro and outro filmed just for this video release. The music video format seems to be thriving best on CMT these days, and that's where Jeff Foxworthy fits right in, with his classic comedy bit. Funny stuff.",1041206400,2,532,4.552083333333333
