You get 3 intense,grueling, well choreograph, easy to follow awesome workouts by Cathe, and you can also premix your workouts so boredom is out of the question. I decided to substitute my running workouts for step aerobics workouts, at least for the time being, and workout at home after moving into a traffic congested neighborhood. Which means running outdoors  is not an option at this time. What better choice than choosing Cathe as my instructor. I suggest you begin doing the workouts with  just the platform until you have mastered the choreography, then you can turn loose on the world and enjoy the workouts. Practice makes perfect. Highly recommended. A must buy.",1452816000,,713,4.983193277310924
8108002,2,B000EB7CU6,"As an avid exerciser, I'd heard lots of good things about Cathe's videos.  So I finally decided to buy this one.  I was disappointed.  She doesn't cue very well at all and just overcomplicates all the moves.  Apparently ""advanced"" for her, just means ""complicated"".  I've done step aerobics before and had no problems.  I have other videos with complex choreography that I have no problems with.  This one, left me not even wanting to bother with the entire video because I couldn't get the moves down between the crazy complex moves and the poor cueing that went along with it.  Bummer, because I was really looking forward to it.",1243209600,,631,4.724770642201835
8108003,5,B000EB7CU6,"These are three great and intense, low, but a lot of high, step aerobic routines, each about an hour.  In addition, there is a ten minute abs segment that I do after each routine.  They all work you hard but the moves require some time to learn!",1231372800,,245,4.191489361702128
8108004,5,B000EB7CU6,"Received Cathe's Cardio Hits in timely fashion. And as with all of Cathe
Freidrich's exercise DVD's, this one is also excellent.  It is obvious in
all of Freidrich's DVD's that she enjoys what she's doing and is most
certainly a walking advertisement for the lifestyle she encourages.
Buy it!",1214524800,,292,4.959183673469388
8108005,5,B000EB7CU6,"I think every serious stepper has a Cathe workout (or two, or three...) I've being doing step for over 15 years and Cathe always delivers with the quality of her dvds and her workouts.  She has recently released some low impact easier step workouts so try these if you haven't worked out with Cathe before.

I won't go into details on the length of the workouts as Amazon has done this, but each workout on this dvd is great.  Lots of power moves and Cathe's usual fast pace means you don't have the time (or the energy!) to get bored. These workouts are tough but they get results.  There are modifications for some of the moves and there is a breakdown section to teach you some of the more complicated stuff.

What I like about Cathe's workouts is they are tough and athletic (not dancy, I'm a klutz), but they do move quickly and are full of power (propulsion) moves so if you have bad knees go for her low impact dvds.

A great price considering you are getting 3 different workouts.  Her later dvds have great menu functions where you can toggle the music and instruction on/off or louder/quieter - great if you want to use your own music.  This is an earlier one that doesn't have this function, but the music is great.",1147132800,10,1226,4.417777777777777
