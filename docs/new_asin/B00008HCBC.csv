8156649,3,B00008HCBC,"The movie looks very low budget, like actors Deon and Merlin where at a friends house and said ""hey lets film our own movie"". That being said for 1.98 I didn't go into this expecting much. At the very least it showed off the young men's talent at playing multiple and somewhat diverse roles - ie. the old men and the Jamaicans. I can see someone getting a kick out of this if they're intoxicated like the characters were. Think of a low budget - less funny ""How High"" movie. Only because I like the actors did I give it 3 stars.",1300320000,,528,4.186274509803922
