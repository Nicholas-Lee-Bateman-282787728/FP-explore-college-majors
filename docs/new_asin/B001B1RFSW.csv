3479619,4,B001B1RFSW,"I can't speak highly enough about this series.  It is excellent both terms of terms of the material and how it's organized.  And visually, well it is simply stunning.  In this sense I give this product 5 stars.

However, some of the quality is lost when viewing on DVDs.  I originally saw the series in HD on television.  It was so exceptionally good that I wanted to buy a copy.  (This is saying something when you consider this purchase nearly doubled the number of DVD's I have bought for my personal use.  DVD's for the kids don't count.)  Since I don't own a blu-ray player, we bought the DVDs.  There definitely was a difference in the visual quality when viewing it on the DVD format.  Thus while I do recommend purchasing this product, I would recommend buying the blu-ray format instead if you have a player.",1250553600,10,817,4.527397260273973

Compared to 1080p disks this one is very soft and grainy.  If you're buying it for the great scenes and as an educational endeavor that's fine, but if you're expecting a reference quality disk with sharp /crystal clear 1080p images, I would suggest looking into the British version which I believe is full 1080p (narration is also British)",1240876800,15,469,4.987179487179487
3479623,2,B001B1RFSW,"This is a heavily edited version narrated by Sigourney Weaver that was shown on the Discovery Channel in the US. It doesn't hold a candle to original BBC version narrated by David Attenborough. It has awkward pauses for commercials (that obviously aren't there) and a huge amount of missing footage. Plus Ms. Weaver doesn't have nearly the gravitas as a narrator of Mr. Attenborough.

3479628,5,B001B1RFSW,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this series. It looks amazing in HD.  And I personally find Sigourney Weaver's narration to be far superior to Attenborough's from the original BBC production of this series.  I may be mistaken but I feel like the soundtrack is also different from the BBC version.  Otherwise you can't really go wrong with either version of the series.  The filming is just stunning.  And the occasional slow-motion filming really intensifies the action and drama.

3479636,5,B001B1RFSW,"I remember watching this on TV. Then tried to find this on DVD and they only had the BBC version narrated by Attenborough. I wanted the iconic voice of Sigourney Weaver. Until now and with the help of Amazon.com, I found it. And yes, the music is incredible with those hard to forget scenic shots plus the extras explaining how some of those shot got taken, I found it's kinda hard to stop watching it. I have since loaned it out to several people who never saw it in the first place and from all indications, are going to order their own copies.

I personally couldn't understand Mr. Attenborough well at all & he seems nonstop in speaking thru every scene; (in my opinion)  How Can You Not Love This Series. The Wonders of Nature you might never have seen in your lifetime. And it is Heartbreaking at moments, since that is the Nature. Such Beauty for your mind and soul to enjoy.

I was so excited to watch this, and planned my week around it when it aired on tv. So I jumped at the opportunity to order this set. It arrived in great perfect shape, and apparently my oldest cat (11) was happy too. She jumped up on the bed at the corner facing the tv and watched an entire hour of it, I think that the jungle/forest one was her favorite.

This version is in 1080i, and personally, I don't think the sound or video quality could be much better.  Sigourney Weaver's pleasant voice steers you along as different parts of the earth are explored. A large portion is devoted to animals seeking and catching their prey - nature in its raw form. This is only a 4-dvd set, but includes everything I wanted.  There are some very good extras which tell and show how much time the photographers had to go through and the danger and obstacles they had to face in order to get the stunning footage.  Very educational, as well as breathtaking.",1376784000,3,753,4.717557251908397

This is a fascinating look at our planet and should be the standard for this type of nature documentary. Absolutely worth the money and definitely recommended.

When we first saw it on tv, I just couldn't stay awake even if I really wanted to, and thought that this was actually kind of great. Something about her voice and narration that just switches my brain waves to REM I guess.
I also leave it on for my pets sometimes, but they sleep all the time anyway so it's hard to tell if this is the ""Sigourney's voice effect"".
Anyway, thrilled to find and acquire this version! Thanks Amazon! ;-)",1359936000,,539,4.294117647058823

3479658,5,B001B1RFSW,"I can't stand the BBC version of this show because of the narrator, he's just boring and it takes me out of the story and the editing is a little different along with a different opening title sequence.  The Discovery channel version may cost more and be harder to find, but it's worth every penny.  Sigourney Weaver's narration pulls me into the story more. The image quality is incredible, it makes it seem as if the the actual animal or plant is in your living room.

My advice, If you are figuring our which version to get: watch both versions of one episode (they most likely are on youtube at this point) and see which one you personally prefer and get that version. We all have our preference, mine is the discovery channel version.",1353974400,3,739,4.5

3479661,5,B001B1RFSW,"Weaver's narration is absolutely enthralling.  I'm a fine art nature photographer and have been watching nature documentaries since I was little and have never enjoyed a series more than planet earth.  The cinematograaphy and Weavers voice are truly exceptional.  I rented the planet earth BBC version by mistake and it certainly was.  Attenborough has nothing on Sigourney.  Don't waste your money on the BBC version of Planet Earth,  the Discovery version is the only one worth owning.",1345420800,3,487,5.259740259740259
3479662,5,B001B1RFSW,"I must admit that I have realized that t is probably the best Blu-Ray I have ever bought in my life. The documentary itself is so beautiful that you can't imagine that without watching. I think there are a lot of reviews praising it. On top of that I was hunted by warm voice of Sigourney Weaver. She is narrating with confidence in her voice, including small jokes here and there. Her voice is fantastic added value to the release and in my opinion so much better than narration done by Richard Attenborough.
Thank you Discover for that release!

Blu-Ray is playable in all regions (incl. Europe) and comes with narration done by Sigourney Weaver with subtitles in English, French and Spanish.",1345161600,,694,4.688524590163935

3479665,2,B001B1RFSW,"I'm a huge fan of BBC nature videos, not only for the incredible cinematography, but also for the credible dialog.  Upon receiving this copy of Planet Earth, I was immensely disappointed when I discovered it was narrated by Sigourney Weaver. Weaver's narration voice is rather flat, unnatural, and lacks any note of scientific wonder.  Sentences are short with choppy pauses between.  She speaks each sentence with almost the same inflection--a high pitch to start and then tapering off to a punctuated low tone at the end of each sentence.  That's not an exaggeration.  I'd estimate that 70% of the sentences are spoken with the same rhythm and end using the exact same pitch.  Her cadence sounds more like a person reading directly from a script rather than someone who is speaking with natural amazement about the events in the video.  I find it to be tortuously boring.

The video resolution printed on the packaging shows 1080i rather than 1080p.  A quick search on Google revealed a good discussion on AVSForums that indicates _all_ main programs on both the US and UK versions are 1080p.  Because other content on the disks is 1080i, BBC uses the ""1080i"" rating on the packaging.  Check for yourself before purchasing if you have concerns about picture quality, because there seems to be a raging debate about the subject.  Check out my comment on this review for the AVSForums link.  I can't comment further on the video quality of this particular version because I didn't watch even an entire episode before investing in the Planet Earth version narrated by David Attenborough.

In contrast, the version narrated by Attenborough is much more enjoyable.  His lifetime of scientific discovery lends instant credibility and believability to the video.  His cadence is more natural and he speaks as if he just knows the material by heart.  Those familiar with how comfortable Attenborough is when speaking on camera in other programs will recognize the same comfort in his narration on Planet Earth.

Perhaps Attenborough's most endearing characteristic is that even in the latter half of his life, you can still clearly hear the scientific--sometimes childlike--fascination in his voice as he talks about the events in the video.

I recommend you skip the Weaver-narrated version and instead get the version narrated by Attenborough.  At least do yourself a favor and find some Planet Earth clips on YouTube with narration by Weaver and Attenborough to see which one your prefer.  Some seem to love Weaver's narration whereas I find it unbearable.",1339027200,4,2553,5.059808612440191

This Blu Ray DVD with Sigourney Weaver is more than a treasure to own... In all honesty, I feel that we are so priveledged, so honored, so lucky to be able to even have an EXPERIENCE of this sort... tied with Sigourney Weaver's voice... Magnificent, jaw dropping, breath-taking, an all around MUST HAVE!!! (Trust me, David Attenbourough leans toward the UK audience, while Sigourney Weaver leans toward the American audience). And if you don't want to listen to a man with an accent and a mono-toned voice I suggest you get your hands on Sigourney Weaver... there is a reason why its soooo much harder to find, not to mention more expensive than David's!",1323043200,6,775,4.664233576642336
3479669,5,B001B1RFSW,"When I bought Planet Earth in a DVD store i wasn't aware that there were two different narrators. i was so upset because i felt it lost that attention grabbing voice. Well that's why i ordered it again because although i love his British accent i couldn't handle not hearing Sigourney Weavers voice. Just youtube clips with him and her and you'll hear the difference she is much better for this type of show.

examples:

here are some links i found ..same shot almost the same music but a different feel.. Sigourney just gives more..check it yourself...

David Attenborough version (BBC)

Sigourney Weaver version (Discovery Channel)

(start it at 00:39 to 00:53)

Look i love everything Discovery, BBC, Nova, Science Channel, NATGEO and History Channel but i feel maybe the Discovery channel wanted to add more facts and kick it up with the music so its not so lame lol..Anyhow i hope they keep these shows coming because every time i am amazed.

Hope this helps",1309219200,10,976,4.767857142857143
3479670,5,B001B1RFSW,"I purchased this product and it arrived within 3 days. It was packaged nicely and in perfect condition. I chose the Discovery Channel version because it contains extensive bonus footage and the soundtrack is more vibrant than the BBC version. Sigourney Weaver does a decent job narrarating. During the film, she offers inside information on how certain shots were made possible. These explanations prove insightful because some of the angles they shoot from are mind boggling! The picture is crisp and perfect, aside from underwater shots which tend to be a bit ""grainy.""
A few people mentioned how the BBC version comes in 1080p while the Discovery Channel is in 1080i. The issue brought up being that 1080p will display a slightly better picture. However, based on what I have read, any HD Tv should even out the difference and display either format with the same picture quality.",1305244800,2,882,4.966216216216216
3479671,5,B001B1RFSW,"I DVR'd the entire series on Discovery and was blown. Sigourney Weaver's dry humor, as well as her intricate explanation of the process of achieving the amazing shots of the series made a show worth watching even watchier.

Then, months later, my roommate bought the Attenborough version on blu ray because hipsters on slickdeals kept insisting ""the original is always better"", just like these same purists think the American version of the Office sucks. Well they suck and so does the BBC version -- and I say this even though I am an avid fan of everything BBC (Top Gear, Mighty Boosh, etc).

I sat through the BBC version many nights asking myself AM I EVEN WATCHING THE SAME SHOW, cuz without the american editing and sound dynamics, it was a borefest. I went from being pumped about sharks snatching suckers out of mid air with tyko drumming to being tortured through watching grass freakin grow in the Andes with an elevator music backtrack. It was the cinematographic equivalent to the dismotilic bowel movements of the elderly.

Buy this version, listen to Ripley talking about animals doing crazy hijinks, and get super pumped about nature. Then go outside and plant like a million trees while listening to AC/DC.

3479672,4,B001B1RFSW,"Another reviewer said it was ""heavily edited"", but there are edited versions of both and full versions of both.  I own this Discovery Channel version, all 5 dvds, and love it.  And I actually searched this one out because I prefer Sigourney Weaver to Sir Richard Higgenbothemboroughshire the III.  :)  I guess I prefer the American inflection and cadence to the high British.  I prefer coffee to earl grey tea and crumpets too, but maybe it's just me.

The reason I didn't give it five stars is because I believe the film makers do allow some materialistic bias to come out.  Sussing that out here would take pages, so I'll just leave it as is for you to take or leave.

Recommended, nonetheless.",1286582400,16,696,4.6016260162601625
3479673,5,B001B1RFSW,"Besides being as healing as a visual spa experience, this series is testament to the staggering capacity of humans for sheer focus, dedication and empathy -- if they so choose.  It was as awe-inspiring to learn what it took to produce a segment as it was to watch the finished product.  This is for people who spend weeks never raising their eyes to the sky, never registering the natural sounds of the early morning, never experiencing the silences between the deadening assault of anthropogenic noise.  Watch it to awaken more fully to the meaning of being alive, and to let that gratitude inform the choices you make.
I think the best recognition, the best award for the makers of this movie would be the knowledge that it motivated a great number of those who watched it to rein in mindless consumption, to become invested in consciously supporting preservation.",1285718400,16,866,4.837837837837838

3479685,5,B001B1RFSW,Sigourney Weaver's voice is much more soothing and appropriate for this documentary. I was unimpressed with the BBC version. This is an excellent DVD set. The footage is so incredible. It features animals I never knew existed. Best nature series I've ever seen.,1259884800,8,261,5.093023255813954
3479686,5,B001B1RFSW,"Having investigated these program discs, both the BBC BDs and the Discovery Channel's set are identical in imagery and transfer quality (1080i, not 1080p).  But frankly, I have to say I find the Sigourney Weaver narration AND the completely different music score to be FAR superior to the bland, milquetoast British edition's sound (& I have both).

Just compare the difference in their respective teasers:  vivacious & energetic versus sleep-inducing!  The DC version's complete soundscape is dynamic and engaging, as well as more directly educational (Ms. Weaver's regular comments on how shots were achieved, etc.), and as much as I greatly respect and appreciate the decades of educational programming from both David Attenborough and the BBC Natural History Unit, I have to work to stay awake with their somewhat affected narration and sound design.  If an exciting visual AND aural experience is what you look for in your BD collection, I highly recommend the Discovery Channel version of 'planet earth'.",1258761600,110,1010,5.2875

8281363,5,B001B1RFSW,An unbelievable series.  The video quality and shots they were able to film are incredible.  You tend to get absorbed in it once you start watching it.  I prefer this version with Sigourney Weaver narrating rather then David Attenborough.  I think she does a much better job of narrating.,1515974400,3,288,4.816326530612245

I love this set of DVD's, Planet Earth is such an amazing movie, I watch it over and over again and never get tired of it!! The picture is crystal clear and you can see the animals just like they look in the wild. Sigourney Weaver does an incredible job at narrating the show, her voice is calm, soothing, and I enjoy it more than any other narrator to date!

It's especially wonderful for anyone who would love to travel to see our world but is unable to do so for whatever reason.
