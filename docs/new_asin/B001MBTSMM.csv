Sometimes a person does NOT have to be completely deaf to need the assistance of closed captions.
These debates aren't new. And it seems there has been quite enough time to have passed to close caption this debate, and the debates of this series. As a stroke victim, and a lifelong, sufferer of a form of dyslexia that makes hearing AND comprehending without the aide of closed captions quite difficult. It is not just a disorder of *mirror* writing, reverse letters/numbers, and reading deficiency. Many of dyslexics can read quite exceptionally. However, comprehending speech; particularly speech reproduced through radio, and television, and movies, etc..., can present great difficulties.

""Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.""

So sadly this was quite the struggle.

Would that I could have enjoyed this more....
Tis a pity that I could not.

8320875,2,B001MBTSMM,"The interview is too short and too shallow. I believe this was just a half hour program. They don't get very far because it was abruptly cut off.

8320878,5,B001MBTSMM,Bill Buckley and his firing Line show was one of the best things I remember about early television. Thank you for re-acqainting us about how good it was.,1367020800,3,153,4.5
8320879,5,B001MBTSMM,This episode of Firing Line is one that incorporates the then rising star of Rush Limbaugh and how he fits into the Conservative movement.  It seems like a ceremony of the passing of a torche from one generation to another of great conservative leaders.  The host talks to his guest on the topic of his personality and then current themes in politics.,1362960000,6,351,4.645161290322581
