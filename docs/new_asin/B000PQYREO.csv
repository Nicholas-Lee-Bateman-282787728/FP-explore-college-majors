8192987,5,B000PQYREO,"Henrik and Nina are happily married, he works as a Swimming Instructor and she is devoted to him. They do have a troubled teen daughter, who we find out is withdrawn, needs counselling and is prone to making things up. Then Henrik gets a call seemingly out of the blue, that lets him know that his daughter Stine, has accused him of sexually abusing her on a number of occasions. The authorities waste no time taking action.

What happens next seems to be totally unreal and Henrik is judged without trial by so many people. As more people find out, the strain on his marriage and also sanity start to take a heavy toll.

This was originally released in 2005, but it stars Sofie Grbl as Nina who has found deserved fame in TV series `The Killing' and if you are a fan check her out in `Aftermath' too for an outstanding performance. This then is another Nordic Noir treat, set in Denmark it is a story that is completely gripping and will hold your attention from the very start, a thing the Scandinavians seem to do rather well. This tackles a very dark subject and does so in a responsible way, but it is the anxiety and tension that had me transfixed.

It is also completely unpredictable which just added to the whole experience. The cast are all superb and as expected the direction and pacing are flawless. In Danish with really good sub titles and a smidgen of English. When you see quality you just know it is, almost instinctively, and this most certainly is that - ruddy excellent. If recent successes are going to cause more of these films to be resurrected, then keep them coming, I am a now a committed fan to the whole genre.",1376870400,,1639,4.456666666666667
