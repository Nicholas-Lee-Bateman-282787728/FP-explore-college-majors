8310575,3,B001GKXK5K,"The dvd's were ok but I feel they were too expensive for what was in them
and the fact you were charged so much on arrival 18.00 for surcharge on postage.
I would not recommend it as it all worked out to expensive and they were only the weight of an envelope.",1394064000,,259,4.0
8310576,5,B001GKXK5K,"FINALLY I have access to a swim teacher who occupies my world -  only with about 26 yrs more experience teaching than I have. This is EXACTLY the kind of video I have been searching and hoping for! I am a 'Learn To Swim' instructor at a recreation center where I teach classes and give private swimming lessons, and I also coach the two youngest groups of swimmers at the Loveland Swim Club (3-6 yrs old) in Colorado. I feel VERY validated in my teaching skills and approach by watching Steve Haufler. I am a hands-on, in-the-water teacher and loved seeing how Haufler operates from the water in this video because I couldn't teach any other way. More - this Progressions video tape gives me progressions that make good sense. Finding what works for young students can take time - and I can see it in Haufler's 30 plus years of experience. I am SO excited to benefit from all his teaching, insights and methods. I wish I could thank him in person!!! Trip to California....?
