The tapes seem to be very good. There are 5 tapes X 5 lessons X 15 minutes each.  The 'witness' above runs through a whole tape at a time without losing interest.  Wow!  Definitely worth the money.",983404800,21,413,4.394736842105263
1227673,5,B00000IQBJ,"""Learn to Read with Phonics"" is actually a series of five 75 minute videos, all of which are included in the purchase price listed.  The 75 minutes are subdivided into five 15 minute lessons.  After each, the child/parent can choose to turn off the tape or go on to the next lesson.  The series covers phonics, sight words and counting.  At four years old, my child knew her letters and their sounds, but not how to put them together.  After the third video, she could sound words like ""banana.""  I found the quality of the set and costumes to be rather amateur.  However, don't be put off by this!  The content is excellent.  My child was mesmerized by the tapes and learned a great deal.  I highly recommend them.",973814400,49,715,4.4728682170542635

I often allow them to use a notebook to write down new words they learn in the the video.  The tapes help reinforce what I have taught.

7911358,5,B00000IQBJ,"UPDATE Nov 2010: I ran into this old review I made three years ago and wanted to let you know how my daughter has progressed since. At seven and a half years old, and in the second grade, my daughter's September reading assessment said she was reading at the level of a typical student in the final month of fifth grade. She just picked up the first Harry Potter book (not my suggestion, but I own them all, and when she asked permission I gave it) and read the first five chapters in one evening, declaring it the best book ever.

Her teacher is amazed and tells me it's a joyful challenge to find plenty of interesting work for my daughter, as she finishes her work long before the rest of the class. I figure she's got a natural talent for reading, but I do give Mrs. Phipps and Snoothy the credit for teaching her the basics through this video set. Please don't let the fact that the video is dated (and, to an adult's sophisticated eye, cheesy) keep you from giving your child a chance to  learn early to love to read. It might not do for older kids, but for preschoolers, it's great!
_______

My daughter (4yo) and her cousin (5yo) first ""met"" Mrs. Phipps and Snoothy when my mother bought a used copy of Learn to Read volume 1 at a yard sale. After seeing just a few minutes of it, my mother almost threw it away, thinking it seemed too boring and unsophisticated for a modern child. To her surprise, both my daughter (then 3) and her cousin (then 4) absolutely LOVED the video! Whenever they visited grandma they begged to watch the video, and often, when the video finished, they rewound it and started it again. And they would sing the alphabet song from the video over and over too (it's a catchy tune; unfortunately so, as I often find myself unable to get it out of my head).

My niece learned to read within just a few months, before her fifth birthday, due in part to Mrs. Phipps, and now, in kindergarten, she reads 3rd-grade-level ""chapter books"" (I'm not exaggerating). She reads to her cousin whenever they're together, which has sparked a strong desire to learn to read in my daughter. But my daughter seems to think she should be able to learn it in an afternoon, and if I sit down with her to teach her, even if I try to make it into a game, she gets bored within minutes. I didn't worry about it, knowing she already has the desire to read; there's still plenty of time for her to develop the patience and attention span to learn the mechanics of reading. I figured I'd look into Hooked on Phonics when she enters kindergarten next year.

A few weeks ago, my daughter found volume 4 in this series during our weekly visit to the local library. She wanted to bring it home: ""It's like Grandma's movie! It's Mrs. Phipps!"" So we've started borrowing the whole series. We brought home volumes 4 and then 3 and 5, while waiting for volume 2 to become available. I worried about her watching them out of order, but she especially loves the later videos where the children act out stories while Mrs. Phipps reads the words as they're highlighted on the screen. These later volumes are still beyond her full grasp but her growing ability to read an occasional word, even though she can't read them all, encourages her desire to learn.

Now four, my daughter can write the alphabet, upper and lower cases, and though she hasn't quite mastered reading, she can sound out simple words (non-blend/short vowel) and knows a few more by sight. I figure she'll be reading within a few months if not weeks (it's an exciting time to watch your child right on the cusp of literacy). The beauty is: I haven't pushed her at all, but she CHOOSES on her OWN to play the Learn to Read videos along with her Dora, Maisy, and other tapes.

I got online today to order the whole set of videos for my daughter so we don't have to rely on their being available at the library (when she outgrows them, we'll donate them to the library). Don't shortchange your child by letting an 80s-style hairdo or a cheesy character costume turn you off of these videos. They may not be suited for every child's learning style, but for some kids at least, they work!",1192492800,,4145,4.4317585301837275
7911359,2,B00000IQBJ,"Skip these and buy Sound it out Land or Leap Frog phonics videos instead.  The Learn to Read with Phonics videos look like they were filmed with a camcorder and are simply a teacher writing on a dry erase board while explaining the rules of phonics. They throw in a character ""Snoothy"" in a lame nod to fun and entertainment. But all they thought of for Snoothy to do is make squeeks in the background while the teacher is giving the phonics lesson. Very cheesy,unimaginative and boring. My 4 year old lost interest in 5 minutes.",1114300800,3,529,4.510416666666667
7911360,5,B00000IQBJ,"As a parent and preschool director this teaches the alphabet and letter sounds. It also teaches uppercase, lower case letters, and how to correctly write the letters. My 6-year-old daughter has watched it over and over again learning something new each time. I have a M.Ed. in early childhood education and I used this video with my own child.  I have recommended this video to many parents of children the ages of 3-6 and those who have used it have had different levels of success.  Barbara Phipps uses phonics but teaches it in a fun and age appropriate way.  She teaches the proper way to write letters and stays within the national language standards for early childhood and elementary education.  Children learn at their own pace with lessons that are an average of 15-minute segments. If a child does not even know their alphabet they learn this, while hearing the correct way to pronounce the letter. The setting is a bit outdated, but children who view it do not seem to notice. It bothers the adults who watch it more.",1046995200,5,1028,4.694444444444445
7911361,1,B00000IQBJ,"I work withthe Adult Basic Education program at my local Community college.  We are in need of videos that help adults learn the phonetic approach to reading.  All the available videos are child oriented.  With the age of technology, why can't we have the same educational material produced for the adult with adult level animation,etc.  I need something with larger print, also.
We have learning disabled students returning to schoool and their needs are still the same as when they quit school.  The media is not there for us to help and yet I feel something has to be out there and I don't know about it nor does my supervisor.
We are using workbooks but the printed page causes the same frustrations to the pupil as they had in school. I use my training in learning disabilities, but it, too, is limited with some students.  I have a very open-minded supervisor and she will cooperate with any ideas suggested.  Do you have any suggestions?
