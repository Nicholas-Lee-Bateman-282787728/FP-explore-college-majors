Thank you so much ! Above that, at the end of the workout when strengthening my legs, i feel a little burn in my belly as well, which makes me feel like I'm gaining more advantages beside improving flexibility.
I really recommend this one to anyone doing any sports, its a good warm-up as well.",1252713600,5,513,4.410526315789474
3682901,4,B001LF3690,"This DVD is great.  I am nowhere near the splits, however I can feel my flexibility improving, and best of all, my body feels deliciously stretchy after doing this DVD.  The knee exercise designed to help knee pain hurt like crazy the first couple of times, yet now it seems to be doing the trick and my constant knee pain is much less noticeable.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the DVD is short; sometimes I feel like I would love to keep doing the stretches for longer than Stacey, however I don't know them all well enough yet to pause the DVD and do so.",1251763200,3,579,4.151785714285714

I'm very glad I got this DVD. Stacey, the beautiful and talented instructor, really works you! I stretched muscles I never knew even existed and did stretches I never even done before. What I personally like to do is hold the stretches a  little longer than Stacey does for a bigger effect. Love this DVD, I've done it twice a day for the past 4 days and have seen results.",1248566400,9,553,4.266666666666667
3682903,5,B001LF3690,"Stacey Nemour's ""Secrets of Splits & Flexibility"" is totally great! These exercises truly work! No matter what age you are and the sport(s) or physical activities you engage in, this DVD will help you perform and feel better. I've been struggling to improve the flexibility of my hamstrings: Stacey demonstrated some excellent stretches especially for hamstrings. And, by gully, they work like magic! So, if you are struggling in order to do front or side splits, this DVD will help you reach your goal(s) too.  There's a lot of other videos out there on the market; however, this value-packed and information-loaded DVD will save you a lot of trouble, decision-making, money and training time, period.

3682904,5,B001LF3690,My lower body flexibility was horrible!  I started using this video and it has already made a difference after just a few sessions.  I still have a long way to go but if feels great to already notice a difference.,1244678400,8,213,4.3
3682905,5,B001LF3690,"I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in increasing their flexibilty. Stacey's DVD meets you wherever you are. From the inflexible novice to the most flexible athlete. Her warm and friendly personality shines through guiding you every step of the way.

It has helped her with her strength and splits, as well.  Your kind way about you, your encouraging voice and smile makes it easy to listen to your dvd.  Thanks!!",1236902400,7,340,4.87719298245614

And I almost feel as beautiful and sexy as she is!
Maybe after a few more weeks of this great workout I will be.
She's smart, speaks clearly, demonstrates everthing she's talking about,
and everything she's demonstrating almost anyone with half a body can do.

On top of all that, she's incredibly gorgeous in an organic, non-plastic way.
If you want to learn to be more flexible, stronger, healthier, start with this DVD!
I can't wait for more in the series to come out.",1228608000,9,538,4.663157894736842

3682980,5,B001LF3690,I purchased this DVD so that my dance daughter could work on improving her splits and flexibility. In a short period of time my daughter's flexibility has improved. Stacey's technique works and my daughter is proof of that. I definitely recommend this DVD if you are interested in improving your flexibility and it even works for stretching out tight muscles. Stacey teaches you the correct way to stretch so that you can reach your potential without injury.,1398124800,,458,4.961038961038961

3682982,5,B001LF3690,I love this DVD - very easy to follow stretching techniques-  my daughter tried it once and is hooked -the stretches are fun and effective for reaching full range of motion of legs and hips - we will be purchasing #2 very soon,1397001600,,226,4.255813953488372
3682983,4,B001LF3690,This is not your typical exercise DVD.  Stacey tells you what stretches to do and you are on your own to hold them for as long as you see fit.  I eventually wrote down the stretches and use that instead of the video.  I'm sure if you dance or train your instructor can give you a list of what to do on your own without having to purchase.,1397001600,2,338,3.9411764705882355

3682986,5,B001LF3690,"I rated this 5 stars because Stacey gives clear, simple, easy instructions to follow to get into the splits.  In addition, she is very encouraging so even though I am a long way off from the flexibility Stacey has, I don't feel discouraged.  She gives additional instructions for people like me who may be quite a bit away from our goal.  Personally I also really appreciate her attire.  So many exercise videos have women in bras and panties (basically) that I wouldn't feel comfortable playing them with my husband or young son in the room.  And while Stacey is very fit, this is clearly a video to help you become more flexible, not one to show off Stacey's body.",1392249600,,666,4.563025210084033
3682987,2,B001LF3690,not what I was looking for. She just shows it quick and moves on. Not happy with this DVD. Loved LASTICS DVD,1391126400,,108,3.9545454545454546
3682988,3,B001LF3690,i thought her dvd was alright to be honest i was not doing any really deep stretches and i can forget about doing the splits. It would probably be beneficial after a few uses,1388534400,,174,4.147058823529412
3682989,4,B001LF3690,It's an oldie but none the less a good educational DVD taking one back to basics (which we sometimes forget). Out of most of the stretching DVDs I have purchased this is differently one of the better ones out on the market at present.,1383091200,,234,4.340909090909091
3683010,2,B001LF3690,"The stretches are just fine, however if you're looking for a tape with a steady pace that you can actually follow along with and not have pause, rewind, etc. to complete the series this is not the one.  Production quality is just ok and the narrative clear - but not worth the investment.  Good luck and happy hunting - I know it can be a chore to find a good stretching workout.",1380672000,,379,4.25

I just got started, and it is a great, rather, amazing workout. I wouldnt do anything different. I feel the burn, especially in my abs. Even without the ankle weights. Thank you SO much Stacy!!!! Next time I write a review, I will be down in my splits. Till then I'm going to challenge myself and to all the customers, do not give up!!!",1352160000,,510,4.378947368421053
3683013,4,B001LF3690,"This video will show you a lot of stretches that will help you get to the splits, many of which were new to me, even after searching on the internet for advice on stretching for splits.  I'm not super flexible so I have a long way to go.  I would prefer a video that I could put in and do the stretches along with the video.  You can't really do that with this one because Stacey doesn't hold them long enough to get a good stretch.  If you use the video to learn the stretches and then do them on your own, I think this would work better.  However I haven't managed to memorize all of the stretches yet.  All in all, I think this was a worthwhile purpose, if only for learning new ways of stretching.  These stretches really do get areas that traditional stretching don't get to.",1351814400,2,780,4.194630872483222
3683014,5,B001LF3690,"I own many yoga and fitness dvds, and this one is certainly worth every penny! If you are trying to improve your flexibility, I highly recommend it.  It's one of my favorites.  Stacey Nemour gives simple, easy-to-follow explanations of excellent stretching exercises. The dvd is the perfect length to fit in before or after a workout, or to do on its own.  After doing these exercises, I always feel terrific.  No matter how many times I've done this routine (and it's been a lot) I never get tired of it.",1345680000,,505,4.5777777777777775
3683015,5,B001LF3690,"I am not really a review writer, but I was compelled to for this video.  I have been trying to get down in my splits for around two years.  As an adult recreational ballet dancer, flexibility is really important to me.  Unfortunately, sciatic pain and tight hamstrings and hips were always preventing me from achieving full splits.  I tried everything I could think of, from stretching a lot before and after classes, to buying odd contraptions, and just plain trying to force it through the pain.  Finally, as a last resort, I caved and bought this video after reading the good reviews.  And to this very moment I am in amazement.  I got my splits in days, literally DAYS after I started using the video daily.  Given, I don't think I was enormously far from them beforehand, I would say that I was maybe around four inches off the ground before.  But I had been four inches away since last year, and I was just plain frustrated by the lack of progress.  This video has changed all of that.  Now I just slide into the splits for fun, just because I'm so excited that I can!  I'm definitely going to keep using this video, who knows maybe I can get as flexible as Stacey herself!",1325635200,24,1179,4.432558139534883

3683017,5,B001LF3690,"I think this is a great flexibility DVD. You certainly can follow Stacey and do it as a workout, maybe pausing here and there to extend the stretches, but with 30+ stretches it takes a good half hour to even do it quickly.

The setting is fine, some reviewers seem to dislike it being in her house but it's still perfectly professional and nicely presented. The sound is good and you can clearly see what she's doing and understand what she's saying.

I think this was well worth the money and am already seeing a difference after just a few times using it. I agree with the reviewer that says once you've done it a few times the DVD itself becomes less important. I put some screen captures on one side and a list of the stretches on the other side of a laminated half-sheet; I just keep it tucked in my gym bag as a reminder and use it all the time.",1299628800,6,851,4.214723926380368
3683018,5,B001LF3690,"I'm an athlete who is absolutely inflexible. I bought this video to help improve my flexibility and range of motion for dance, in hopes I will one day be able to do front splits. FYI... I downloaded this video rather than buying it, so having spent only $9.95 my rating/review may be somewhat valued differently.

First off, there is no fluff--this is stretching routine that Stacey immediately jumps into. I like that it's a good 35-40 minute routine that really hits all the muscles necessary to not only improve my flexibility for splits, but also give me a better sense of well-being and better posture.

The picture quality and sound are adequate--I truly don't know what others are talking about in terms of poor production. Stacey herself is great on camera, and it's quite apparent she is a great teacher as well. Yes, she does take you through the moves rather quickly but she does so with clear structure and specific explanations on what muscle groups are being stretched and how to avoid injuries. I had no problem following along in terms of body position and flow of the routine. I do pause the video here and there to really sit in a stretch or to focus more on areas I feel necessary. There is one editing error in the video (perhaps it's just my downloadable copy as I haven't seen this comment elsewhere) where the video displays the wrong position as she explains a specific stretch, but it really doesn't effect the flow of the routine, and it's very brief. In fact, people just may not even catch it.

So in conclusion, I give Stacey's video for flexibility and splits a 5/5 because it's extremely valuable at only $9.95 (downloadable version, remember!), it feels good to do the sequences, she gives great explanations on proper stretching/safety precautions, and Stacey is a downright great teacher.

Good luck!

3683019,4,B001LF3690,I bought this DVD so that I could increase my kick height in Taekwondo.  I started at an older age so this was a challenge for me.  I'm kicking about a foot higher since I started this DVD and it really works.  This DVD is not easy but some of the exercises can be modified until you get the flexibility needed to handle the complete stretch.  She has another DVD called Flexibility for the Least Flexible People which helped me to understand where I can modify some of these.  I would recommend either one.  Once you learn the stretches you don't need the DVD anymore because this is really more instructional than a follow-along.,1281830400,2,631,4.491228070175438
3683030,4,B001LF3690,"What most people don't get is that you have to pause the dvd and do the stretches longer. She's just demonstrating them. But overall, it's a very good dvd. I've done it a little over five times, and I already have the sequence memorized, so I guess I no longer need the disc, but it taught me a lot. After the routine I feel very open with my splits, more than I knew, and just after five times, I already feel flexible.

So overall, it could have been a follow along disc, but I still think it did the job, and would totally recommend it. Plus I haven't pulled a muscle while doing it, even doing it cold. I guess it means it's a good routine.",1278115200,,644,4.111111111111111
3683031,3,B001LF3690,"The video is not bad.  It's not great either, it's just an extremely flexible person going through stretches she likes.  There are just about all Static stretches and talks nothing about doing dynamic active/passive stretches.  She should have other people in the video with varying degrees of flexibility.  Maybe a very inflexible person and a very flexible person.  It should also be done in a studio, not just her apartment.  This video should cost about $10 and then it would be worth it.  There is just not clear defined structure on what to do to gain extreme flexibility like she has.

3683032,5,B001LF3690,"It has been said that when the student is ready , the teacher will appear.
This is a great stretching DVD with excellent progression from one movement to the next. I think that it is the video's greatest asset, as most anybody interested in stretching would know these individual stretches. I was a bit apprahensive at first only because the DVD is shot in what appears to be Stacey's home and not a porfessional studio. After a while however I started liking this quite a lot, as when I stretch it is at home, in similar environment and I feel much more at ease watching it.
It is not for the complete beginner though. If you are one of those, you should pick Stacey's other video ""Stacey Nemour's Stretching for the least flexible people on the planet"".
In fact, based on my improvement in flexibility due to this video I bought all her other ones too. I was faced with the dilemma now how to structure a routine based on them, so I wrote to Stacey asking for her advice. I was impressed, she responded almost immediately and I have been following her advice ever since.
Martial arts have been part of my life for many years but unfortunately I was never able to do the spilts. Until now, that is. With Stacy's help I just might.",1264636800,3,1231,4.427312775330397
3683033,5,B001LF3690,"First, a little background of me and why I purchased this video.  I used to be competitive martial artist, and then a b-boy, I let my training slip when life got in the way, it has been about 5 years since my peak fitness level.  I have finally had the chance and motivation to get back to the gym but wanted a guide to help my lack of flexibility, and also to learn some new stretches.

This DVD by Stacey Nemour was EXACTLY what I hoped for, and pretty much what it is advertised for.  Her guide to splits and becoming more flexible.  I have found some great techniques she teaches and following the stretches in the sequence she teaches has been awesome.  It has helped my lower back and hips with getting rid of discomfort.  It has gotten me more flexible and I love.

She is fast showing each technique, but she does state to not just do it once.  I don't know why there are bad reviews on here saying it isn't a work out.  It is to teach techniques, it says NOTHING about being a workout video.  If you are looking for a work out DVD, learn how to read first, then shop on Amazon.

If you are looking for a video to teach you techniques for gaining flexibility, I would highly recommend this video.  It has taught me alot of cool ways to get the most out of stretching.",1262044800,21,1275,4.197530864197531

When I follow her suggestion and do the stretches consistently, I do achieve a lot more flexibility.  My only complaint is that the sequences of the stretches are not long enough.  The pace is so fast that I have to do them on my own to hold them long enough.  I think maybe she had that in mind when she filmed the DVD.  She is teaching you the stretches so you can do them on your own.  Some of the stretches against a wall were completely new to me, so if I had not bought the DVD I would not have known about them--and they work.

------
Stacey is an attractive woman with some exceptional skills but this DVD is not what I'd hoped for. The individual stretches are sound but this is more of a how-to-guide than an actual exercise video. She flies through the different stretches without any inclination of how long they should be held. In short I wouldn't call this an exercise video since following along is practically impossible without pausing the DVD all the time. I prefer DVDs over books because it helps keep me in the routine.

The  following comments have nothing to do with the stretches in the DVD, but I'm providing it in case these issues may be important to you:
The overall production value is really low. It's basically shot on a consumer level camera (albeit with decent sound) in a living room. The transitions from one stretch to the next are distracting. It's a consistent fade-through-black transition set up, which only helps because you'll need to pause the video quite often. I only bring this up because the DVD is priced pretty high for an exercise DVD. If this were half the price like other DVDs (that usually have better production value) I wouldn't even mention it.
Stacey also has beautiful hair, but she should have put it up in a bun, or a pony tail at the least. It often blanketed her body and this issue coupled with some poor camera angles made for some guess work as to proper positioning and such. Imagine a wig draped over a pretzel. To note she has a million dollar smile and freakishly thin waistline (I know, that part is absolutely useless but I had to point it out ;)

----
This last part is for the producers and Stacey herself (hoping she reads these reviews):
It's a super long shot but I wish you would redo this video. I'd buy it because it's a great routine that's very close to being exactly what inflexible people are looking for. Involve three other people (beginner to advanced), and complete the video continuously as an actual routine. This would give you the opportunity to walk around to the different people pointing out proper form, counting out time, and such. It's the coaching element that I think is missing. I hope you can understand how important this is for people who are so much less flexible and want a DVD to follow along with.",1256169600,148,2545,4.574561403508772

I am not extremely flexible at all and really wanted something to help me out. I hate the fact that I have to pause after every single part of the demonstration to do the stretch longer on my own.

Part of what has kept me going is that Stacey comes across as a very friendly and enthusiastic person, so it hasn't been much of a drag to do the stretching sessions almost every day.
It's true that she doesn't hold some of the stretches very long, but for me it's exactly right that way. When I hold my stretches longer, I tend to get sore. Definitely a recommendation!!",1486857600,,699,4.102189781021898
