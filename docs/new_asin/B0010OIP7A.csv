8238093,5,B0010OIP7A,"I picked up this 2 DVD set at K Mart for $5.00!!! Both of these offbeat films star the one and only Dennis Hopper!!! Sure it's not Easy Rider,Out Of The Blue,Hell Ride or Speed material!!! But it's great stuff!!! Frankie The Fly is an off beat comedy and so is Search and Destroy which is produced by master director Martin Scorsese!!! Both fims also have great supporting casts!!! Hopper does great comedies as well as the serious stuff he is more known for! If you're a Dennis Hopper fan,this set is well worth picking up! A+",1234656000,3,527,4.443298969072165
