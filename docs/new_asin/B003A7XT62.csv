8392866,5,B003A7XT62,"I'd never seen ""The Moonraker"" before purchasing this DVD -- on the recommendation of Jeffrey Richards in his book ""Swordsmen of the Screen"", an appreciation of the swashbuckler.  ""The Moonraker"" is a fine example.  The plot is fast-paced and engaging, the casting effective, and the action is exciting.  George Baker is ""The Moonraker"", one of the last active Royalists who refuses to yield to the Roundheads during the English Civil War.  The film concerns his efforts to spirit Charles II out of England until he can safely be restored to his throne.  There's some fine swordplay, unusual romance, and hair-raising chases.  If you like swashbucklers, you'll be pleased with ""The Moonraker"".",1405209600,,693,5.198198198198198
8392867,5,B003A7XT62,"I just finished watching a very old, grainy copy of this movie and I am upset that I can't find it on DVD.  It is a fantastic, swashbuckling adventure set in seventeenth century England.  George Baker as the Moonraker is a great character, an the movie is a gem that I always enjoy watching.  Have had a copy for over 30 years, but I don't know how long my VHS copy will last.  First saw it as a kid, watching British Movies in the Afternoon, have always loved it.  ""Please come to me, my turtle dove.""  The song of the Moonraker.  I will keep searching and one day may be lucky enough to find a DVD.",1380931200,,600,4.120689655172414
8392868,4,B003A7XT62,"They seek him here, they seek him there... those Roundheads seek him everywhere. But, hold up, this isn't France and this isn't M. Chauvelin turning over every rock, desperate to unearth that demned elusive Pimpernel. THE MOONRAKER - which came out in 1958 and doesn't at all star Roger Moore - is a fine historical swashbuckling adventure and there's even a dash of romance peppered in. Set in 1651, shortly after the English Civil War, THE MOONRAKER recounts - or, rather, embellishes on - the true story of Charles Stuart II's perilous flight from England, what with his side, the Royalists, having lost the bloody debate and their king Charles I summarily executed.

No surprise that bad feelings yet fester between the Royalists, who wanted Charles Stuart II on the throne, and the Roundheads, who support Oliver Cromwell's military dictatorship (under the auspices of the Commonwealth of England). One adversary persists in vexing the Roundheads the most: that notorious Royalist outlaw, the Moonraker. Not that this has anything to do with what, but a ""moonraker"" is a smuggler who hides his contraband in the village pond only to rake it out by moonlight. In his guise as the Moonraker, the dashing Lord Dawlish (George Baker) works to secure Charles Stuart's safe passage from England to France. And just to keep things in perspective, there are one hundred pounds in bounty set on the Moonraker's head. But Charles Stuart's capture is worth one thousand pounds.

It would've been a bloodier eye for the Roundheads and their parliament had the Moonraker existed in actuality, but he didn't. As fleshed out by George Baker, Lord Dawlish makes for a gallant hero. Baker also exhibits a nice physical presence, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if he'd handled his own stunts and swordplay. The beautiful Ann Wyndham (Sylvia Syms) certainly can't be faulted for falling for him, never mind that she harbors hatred for the Royalists and she's engaged to Colonel John Beaumont (Marius Goring) of the Roundhead party. I do like the ending which stikes a somewhat ambivalent tone. The closing moments, it seems to me, portray Ann Wyndham as a woman pensively pondering her crossroads, her allegiances torn (because her fiance, the Colonel, is at heart a pretty decent bloke). The romantic bits aside, this much neglected, oft forgot British flick doles out plenty of sword fights and close shaves and cat and mouse games engaged by Lord Dawlish and the dangerous bladesman Major Gregg (a sinister Peter Arne) and Colonel Beaumont.

The film's second half takes place almost entirely in a coastal inn as Lord Dawlish arranges the final leg of Charles Stuart's escape. Solid performances abound, with a particular nod to Paul Whitsun-Jones' fun performance as Parfitt, one of the inn's guests. Events would reveal the pompous Parfitt as a Royalist sympathizer and that he is as stout in heart as in frame and not a stranger to the sword. The English landscape is a recurring supporting character and provides a scenic backdrop to the frenzied sword fights taking place center stage. THE MOONRAKER deserves Region 1 treatment so that the Yanks can also eyeball this modest but entertaining British stab at costumed derring-do. This Region 2 DVD does offer the film's trailer, so a golf clap goes out for that bit of largesse.",1324080000,,3325,4.987387387387387
8392869,4,B003A7XT62,"Not to be confused with the James Bond film, 1958's THE MOONRAKER is an overlooked British swashbuckler gem set during the waning years of the Roundhead-Cavalier Civil War.

Anthony, the Earl of Dawlish (George Baker) operating under the alias of The Moonraker has been assigned the task to secret England's rightful king Charles Stuart (Gary Raymond) out of the country and the clutches of Oliver Cromwell (John Le Mesurier).  Taking refuge at a south coast Inn whilst he plans the escape of Stuart and his entourage, Anthony meets and falls in love with Ann Wyndham (Sylvia Syms), a roundhead sympathiser engaged to Colonel Beaumont (Marius Goring), who'd just as easily see The Moonraker hanged for his crimes; but when Anthony's cover is finally blown, Ann's true feelings toward the regenade Cavalier come to the surface.

Running just over a compact 80 minutes, the film clips along at a good pace and the action never stops.  The chemistry between Baker and Syms is quite apparent.  Sadly this wound up being George Baker's final truly ""lead"" role in films; he spent the rest of his career in supporting roles, but found his main audience in television.  On the flip-side, this was one of Sylvia Syms' first real movie roles of note, and she'd subsequently distinguish herself in such films as ""Ferry to Hong Kong"", ""The World of Suzie Wong"", and ""Conspiracy of Hearts"".

If you enjoy British period adventures like ""The Wicked Lady"" and ""The Man in Grey"", you'll adore THE MOONRAKER.",1310256000,2,1491,4.94
8392870,5,B003A7XT62,"The Moonraker is a fine English swashbuckler, set during the period of the English Civil War (circa 1649). It features good acting, great production values, and is quite entertaining. Although in PAL format, with an ""all regions"" DVD player, it is viewable in the US.
