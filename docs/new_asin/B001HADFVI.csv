3627515,5,B001HADFVI,"I have now purchased all the seasons of One Foot in the Grave, and the Christmas specials. This is one of my all-time favorite comedies. Season Six contains some of the funniest episodes of the entire show, and also the saddest. I really enjoy curling up with Victor and Margaret, and their long-suffering neighbors.",1357516800,,316,4.87037037037037
3627516,5,B001HADFVI,One Foot in the Grave is one of the funniest British comedies.  I have purchased all the seasons and have not been disappointed.  It's a great show.  The problems that Victor Meldrew gets into are like none other and hilarious.,1346630400,,227,4.625
3627517,5,B001HADFVI,"Series 6 happened after production staff twice tried to end the ""One Foot in the Grave"" series. But included in this Season 6 DVD, The Final Series, is #3 ""The Futility of the Fly"" which I believe to be the CLASSIC of this classic cult-like comedy series. This BBC humor is derived from the unexpected, much confusion, unwanted retirement, banter and moaning. Situations are absurd and unbelievable--but pile up on newly retired Victor Meldrew like maggots on road kill. You will soon understand the why behind his famous line, ""I don't believe it!"" made famous by actor Richard Wilson in this series.

Victor is the World champion of smart aleck retorts. He's King Curmudgeon. The British Bard of Barbs. Just when you give up hope for something more than cynicism from Victor, he provides an oasis bit of tenderness, a note of loving affection toward his wife. Actually, Victor, attacks every annoying item in society and life, taking natural law into his own hands, only he uses his mouth, and sometimes cunning retaliation. It's funny. He dares do what we've all been tempted to do. He's the occasional ""Robin Hood"" of OAP (old age pensioners). But you don't have to be old and retired to enjoy this one-man crusade against injustice of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. We've all been there, and you too will cheer Victor's act first-think second attack on fate's little burrs of life. Victor is a moaner and complainer with a purpose.

If you can't afford the entire series ""One Foot in the Grave: The Complete Collection"" (see my collection review) then this single DVD is recommended. A higher recommendation is buy the complete collection--this DVD is included along with 30 more episodes, 6 Christmas specials, and other features just as fun.

WARNING:
One Foot in the Grave DVDs contain language issues: heavy vane use of Deity names & such. Also includes sexual innuendos, discussion of private body parts, & nudity (breasts and especially OAP men's bottoms). NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN or your pastor.

SUBTITLES INCLUDED:
SubtitLes avaiLabLe, compLete with every ""L"" begin capitaLized sLipped in as a Lark.

Hours of banter, moaning, fast-paced silly gags, and annoying life situations so intertwined that ""you simply won't believe it!""",1264377600,5,2261,5.002659574468085

3627520,5,B001HADFVI,"My wife and I simply love this program but we were disappointed to see that some content was altered and some of the episodes were missing.

Also it would seem that the BBC stiffed us on a special or two...at the very least they could make these available for purchase.

Still we consider this to be the the funniest program ever to grace TV and there is a little of Victor Meldrew in all of us.",1237161600,6,395,4.184210526315789
3627521,1,B001HADFVI,"As a fan of the series as it was broadcast on Public Television, I was greatly disappointed at this version of the final episode.  My favorite scenes have been altered from the broadcast version. The cabaret scene from Victor's reunion has been completely cut, and the final song used has been substituted with an insturmental selection.  I can only assume that these changes were made for legal reasons, as the cabaret performers are still listed in the closing credits.  I deducted 4 stars because I was so happy to be able to own the series and feel betrayed. Can you believe it?!",1235692800,18,583,4.696078431372549
3627522,5,B001HADFVI,"Produced five years after Season 5, this 2000 series chronicles the further misadventures of Victor Meldrew.  Not much changed after 5 years: Victor remains eternally unhappy and hilarious.  The final episode ends the series for good on a bizarre note--I won't give it away here.

This Series 6 Set includes a retrospective documentary about the series as one of the few supplements.",1234310400,9,383,5.145161290322581

8308273,5,B001HADFVI,"This a hilarious series. Victor Meldrew is so pissed off with world, his antics make you laugh until you fall off the couch.
