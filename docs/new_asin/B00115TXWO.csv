It's a very charming classic anime series that I recommend to fans of the books and classic funny animal anime. To my knowledge, this is currently the only North American DVD that exists. There is a Japanese box set, but I'm not sure what region it's in or if it contains English dubs or subtitles.",1516320000,,389,4.342465753424658
8240650,2,B00115TXWO,"I did not watch the full 60 minutes, but the portion I did watch was one ""Fables of the Green Forest"" episode followed by an ""ancient"" cartoon (not A Green Forest story) followed by the same episode of Green Forest again. I saw it repeat for the 3rd time then stopped watching. Was disappointed. I did not contact their customer service. Just figured ""live and learn.""",1398729600,,368,4.590909090909091
8240651,5,B00115TXWO,Please hunt down the summer series of the Fables of the Green Forest and I will buy them all!! What a classic treasure to have and share with children and adults alike...,1354320000,,170,4.34375
