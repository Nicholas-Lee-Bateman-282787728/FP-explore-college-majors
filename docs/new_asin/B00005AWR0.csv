We know what is happening and we see the real criminal becoming pure in front of a court and the real victim being accused of the crime. And yet it will end well because of an effort done by one cop who really digs out the little detail that will put things back in proper perspective. But the film is a lot more interesting at the psychological level. The husband, the victim of the attempted murder, manages to disappear due to an imbroglio in the crime and subsequent accident. He accepts this situation to let his wife rot in jail since she is accused. He wants vengeance. During this time, he lives in a small californian city as a mechanic under a false name. And there the plot thickens a little because his  boss  in this city is a woman and she reasons him into going back and getting out of his vengeful plan. He does and the wife, who is a perfect liar, accuses him then of having killed her lover. He becomes the accused criminal. It is a real last minute incident that will revert the situation. This film shows how vengeance is a bad motivation, but also how blind justice is and how easily justice can be coaxed into believing the wrong thing by an expert liar. Even if the end shows how fast a prosecutor can change the situation when he finally knows the truth, we have all reasons to be afraid of being one day entangled in such a situation and of becoming the accused of a crime we have not committed. That explains why so many people become blind and mute when they see a crime in the process of being committed. They don't want to get involved and be eventually dragged into complications.
