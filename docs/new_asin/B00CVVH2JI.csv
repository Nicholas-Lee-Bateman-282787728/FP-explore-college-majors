The film did not fare well overall with critics, so I had mixed expectations upon watching it. I only viewed it once, but my mind won't let go of it. In the climactic hallucinatory scene, one of the characters goes mad and eats mushrooms, hoping they are poisonous enough to release him from an alchemist's bondage. That's pretty interesting in itself.

So it is one of those movies that lodges itself in the mind and demands another viewing.  Or two.  If you like digging beneath surfaces, this film is for you.  If you like to be spoonfed meaning, look elsewhere.",1395705600,4,680,4.680672268907563

5743001,5,B00CVVH2JI,"This was an excellent film.  There are elements of Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Werner Herzog.  The cinematography is impressive, the script is good, the direction is excellent, and the acting is very inspired.  This is surrealist minimalism that never bores and is by no means pretentious.

The film clips along at a good pace and the realism of a time period in England as represented in this film is to be admired.  So; for a surrealistic head-trip, this is also rather accurate historically as well.

Hopefully this eerie film will stir on a new wave in British film-making, one that will blatantly ignore the stale old Hollywood standard.  ""A Field In England"" is a journey worth taking.",1391817600,7,697,4.8559322033898304

The story takes place during the Civil War in 17th-Century England and is about some deserters who are captured by an alchemist looking for treasure in a field and then they end up eating mushrooms and the journey begins.  Other than the cinemaphotography though, I found the story to be slow and boring.  I had to watch it twice as I feel asleep sitting upright in a chair and I wasn't even tired when the film started.

5743008,3,B00CVVH2JI,"At first glance, the narrative of this film may not seem overly exciting:  an alchemist`s apprentice and several English Civil war deserters meet by chance and wander around in a large field.  But if  you watch carefully, the minimalist structure enables you to really get into the characters,their personalities and problems, and their struggle to escape an ominous, enchantment-like experience.  It`s like a stage play transported to an outdoor environment.  Some have disparaged the slow pace of A Field in England.  I tend to think that it contributes to the general build-up of the story, much like in such disparate movies as 2001: A Space Odyssey and  Upstream Color.  About 20 minutes into it, a lot of strange things start to happen.

Most of the weirdness is linked to the imposing O`Neill, a master alchemist/magician who dominates the men and the action for much of the film. After he commands them to dig for a supposed hidden treasure, it becomes unclear how much of the subsequent happenings are caused by him or by a circle of  ""magic"" mushrooms.  Events repeat themselves, dead men walk again, and nothing seems genuinely real.  The frustrated young  Whitehead tries to defeat O`Neill and make sense of things, puzzling as this task may be.
The black and white cinematography is striking and almost seems into morph into color during some sequences.  I also enjoyed the musical score, which features traditional pipes and organs and includes a lovely Scottish ballad sung by the character Friend.

Basically the film is challenging at first, but well worth viewing, as it`s a genre-defying effort that  has some intriguing viewpoints on the nature of reality, how we perceive magic or the lack thereof, and  how different types can work together.  I`m looking forward to more from director Ben Wheatley.",1478995200,,1820,5.030100334448161

Sure there is a sort of evolution of the fool to the magus sort of concept going on, and many other little devices (including one of the best trippy minute and a half I've seen in a long while, very much conveying a 'peak' moment), this movie is really really funny.  The characters become pretty charming, and though I am not expressing much in the way of the plot (there isn't a whole lot) it is not a mere 'period' piece.  In many senses it doesn't seem much a period piece at all, but a timeless story that happens to take place at a moment in time, in a field, in England.",1466121600,2,738,4.176056338028169

5743024,5,B00CVVH2JI,"Wheatley's ""A Field In England"" is not quite anything like ""KIll List"". Not anything at all, really. Anyone expecting anything in common with those two movies (except the director's obvious fascination with the occult) has barked up the wrong tree.

This is intensely subjective. While I wasn't in the mood to watch something like this, I did get into it while not entirely understanding all of it. The English are busy at war a long time ago and we are following this psychedelic path of four soldiers right down into the rabbit hole.

This is my cursory understanding of the events: a very intelligent but helpless looking alchemist--and a working knowledge of alchemy helps to understand the decidedly nonlinear plot--arrested for intellectual treason--is faced with some uncanny circumstances as one of the soldiers undergoes a transformation.

Beyond that, one really has to pay attention. The only objection I have to the movie is that mushrooms don't really work in the cinemascope, ultra fantasy fantastic way as displayed here, but it was necessary to the plot that they do work that way. This is also a viciously effective anti-war film.

If Lewis Carroll and Syd Barrett wrote historical fiction together, it'd be like this. Recommended.",1448668800,4,1248,5.102941176470588

5743027,5,B00CVVH2JI,"This was a stellar movie that definitely provokes some thought into what is going on in the film, that makes you wonder the difference between magic and mushrooms.",1446249600,,163,4.857142857142857
5743028,4,B00CVVH2JI,"Visually speaking Ben Wheatley's film bears strong links to Peter Watkins's groundbreaking CULLODEN (1964), which treated the epic battle between the English and Scots (1746) as if it were a contemporary news report. The stark black-and-white imagery of the conflict and its aftermath contrasted with the matter-of-fact narrative to illustrate the true horrors of battle.

A FIELD IN ENGLAND is likewise shot in black-and-white, with grainy imagery of the English Civil War (1642-49) and its aftermath. There are no major battle-sequences (the film's budget would not extend to that), but Wheatley makes it clear why the deserters have abandoned the conflict in the interests of self-preservation. Cavaliers and Roundheads were quite literally fighting to the death; and none of the protagonists wanted to meet such a grisly fate.

Matters take an unexpected turn, however, when the deserters encounter an Irish alchemist O'Neil (Michael Smiley) who forces them to seek out hidden treasure that he believes has been buried in a field. Whitehead (Reece Shearsmith) is quite literally reduced to an animal as he is tied to a leash and made to execute O'Neil's orders. Wheatley's narrative style also changes, as the film moves away from quasi- realist mode into a surrealistic sequence of images where cinematic style appears to seem more important than plot coherence (as other reviewers have noted).

Or perhaps not. An alchemist professed to be able to transform base metal into gold, and by doing so had privileged access to the universe's darkest secrets. In the previous century John Dee had established a considerable reputation at the court of Queen Elizabeth I through his presumed knowledge of alchemy and the occult. By the mid-seventeenth century, however, the practice had been satirized in Ben Jonson's famous comedy THE ALCHEMIST (1610), and had subsequently lost a lot of its mystique.

What A FIELD IN ENGLAND shows is the potentially destructive consequences of O'Neil's practices. The deserters are not only transformed into slaves, but the music of the spheres has also been challenged. The alchemist has dared to pry into divine knowledge and reduced the world to chaos as a result. No one is safe; in a series of shoot-outs the deserters try to kill him, and O'Neil responds in kind. Concepts such as ""good"" and ""evil"" no longer exist; the world has degenerated into a dog-eat-dog environment wherein only the fittest survive.

This is a powerful antiwar message, made even more powerful when we realize that Wheatley's screenplay had been inspired by association with The Sealed Knot, the Civil War re-enactment society. A FIELD IN ENGLAND communicates a trans-historical perspective, making us aware of the sheer futility of war, whether practiced for real or simply played out for fun.",1445731200,,2808,5.231111111111111

I aporeciated it as a stoner movie, didn't really think it was scary. As the movie progressed  there were parts that made me cringe in my chair. I found them upsetting and deeply disturbing.

5743031,4,B00CVVH2JI,"Original review is below, but I felt I should give this one an update. I moved it from 3 to 4 stars: This films stuck with me. I re-read what I wrong below, and I stand by it. However after some time of reflection I think as a whole experience the lasting impression over time for me at least was a positive one. There's something to be said about the cinemetography and this film ended up having one of my favorite scenes of all time.""the tent scene"" as its dubbed. The movie felt fresh, which as I get older and watch more and more films I can appreciate more and more. I still would have wished there was just a bit more of an actual cohesive story (a good chunk of the later acts is a bit too much 'artsy' stuff for me (not too artsy mind you, just too much of it)). Definitely worth a watch if you're looking for something fresh, just go into it with an open mind.

I really really wanted to like this movie.  It had alot of good things going for it.  The premise is fresh and interesting.  The cinematography is very appealing and I am a massive Shearsmith fan.  But all in all the whole thing just fell short for me.  I read an interesting interview with the director and he cited ""primer"" as one of his inspirations because of its complexity.  He found it admirable that primer didn't ""hold the audiences hand""  it just said here's the science you either get it or you don't, probably not but whatever.  Wheatley (the director)  compared the experience to being dropped into a story in the middle of Japan stating something along the lines of ""you wouldn't know what the f* is going on. ""  and you know what,  I can appreciate that approach to realism.  I totally see where that influence impacts the film in a positive way.  Some of the early dialogue was skillfully crafted to reflect historically accurate conversations that might have been had in that time period.  And for the most part I didn't understand most of what they were saying.  In this light I think Wheatley accomplished his goal.  The end result in scenes like this is immersion.  It actually does feel like you're dropped in the middle of an ancient battle and listening in on a conversation of people from the past, so I have to applaud him there.  The language isn't dumbed down: it's not just regular English spoken in an 'old-timey' accent.  The problem comes from the rest of the story.  The film is fairly comprehensible up until... I'd say a little over halfway through.  It's slow albeit artful.  Then from there on out there no sense to be made of anything.  And it's not that it's too intelligent or subversive...  the thing just doesn't make sense.  It's confusing.  This is where I think Whatley missed something: so let's say you WERE dropped into Japan.  Let's say feudal Japan you're dropped into the middle of a story.  So I'd say roughly 50 percent of what's going on would make no sense heck maybe even 75 if I'm being generous.  But here's the important part: you would get the gist of going on or rather,  you COULD get what a going on.  It's possible, to understand something that is alien.  Maybe not fully,  but you could understand it enough to appreciate it.  It's this that makes me think Wheatley saw primer and was like ""I want to make a movie that is impossible to understand,  then everyone will appreciate how complex and intelligent it is. ""  Now I'm not saying that's the case,  maybe it just went over my head, that's possible.  But I couldn't even find an online synopsis that really explained anything... Making me wonder how much of it is legitimately capable of being understood.  I'm by no means someone that wants or even enjoys being spoon fed... I enjoy a good plot. I even enjoy a movie where you're not really meant to understand everything even after careful analysis...  But for me this movie just fell short.  It had some really awesome ""psychedelic""  effects.  Was nicely shot.  Had a great soundtrack and a strong premise.  But didn't make any sense in the end and left me frustrated and confused.  Because of this the ending just felt like a cop out because there was no rhyme or reason to it or anything before it.

Watch if: you're OK with a slow pace,  unfufilling ending,  confusing plot that may or may not be theoretically comprehensible,  if you enjoy artistic and stylistic imagery in film, and are patient.  Watch if you can remove all expectations.

Overall I think it was worth the watch.  If I think of it as an abstract piece of art I appreciate it more.  If I think of it as a movie or even a ""film""  I think less of it.",1445212800,,4561,4.448609431680774

5743052,5,B00CVVH2JI,"MOVIE REVIEW: ""A Field in England""
5 out of 5 beer cans

Set in 1648 during England's Civil War, an odd bunch of soldiers decide to desert the battlefield intent on finding an alehouse to drink some beer together instead (to hell with the war). They run into an evil-minded alchemist and his assistant along the way... who lead them into a certain field laced with many psychedelic mushrooms. Things in the plot get rather slippery at this point as things take something like a 1960's Beatles movie spin... in a violent way.

WHAT I LIKED: The Plot and how that plot is delivered. What is a movie but a storyline told in imagery? As the viewer, the story line doesn't roll out easy like a bag of Doritos spilling out in some fat truck drivers seat. I must say, that neither my movie partner nor I were bored one minute watching this flick. The imagery and story kept us tuned in. Granted, many movie watchers prefer not to have to work too hard for things - and that is fine - That group would probably turn this flick off 30 minutes in. To each their own.

Visually, this movie pulled myself and my movie partner in - not greatly - but it drew us in and kept us there till the end. I have an 80"" screen and projector set up - and that helps*.

I admit that I also liked the unusual setting, costumes and antique weaponry. As a right-leaning conservative American, living in the sticks, and an army veteran and self-proclaimed pyro, you'd think I own a lot of guns. Fact is, I only own two and both those are antique flintlocks. I like vintage guns - and there is a flintlock (matchlock) duke out in this movie.

WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: My movie partner and I both agreed that at times it was hard to follow the accents of the English in this. Their's was not the 'posh' sort of British you get with Hugh Grant or James Bond. This, however, ultimately lent to the authenticity and believability of the setting so this still gets my very rare 5-star review. I recall seeing parts of a Korean WW2 movie where Koreans played German and American soldiers in Europe - with English subtitles. This movie came across as a bizarre comedy. No, everything in ""A Field in England"" comes off as authentic - maybe even the psychedelic mushroom trips.

BOTTOM LINE: I liked this movie and can't find a single flaw in it. It certainly isn't a movie for everyone though. If you give this movie a go, limber up mentally with a few games of PC chess. As for me, I took this one straight up.

5743073,5,B00CVVH2JI,"I understand why some people rated this film so poorly, and don't blame them. 'A Field In England' only works if you work it; that is, appreciation of this movie demands complete immersion in the experience, a level of commitment most people aren't willing to take on the basis of a shoddily made trailer and a few positive Amazon reviews. Few filmmakers make any real demands on their audience other than 'Sit, watch, be entertained'. Wheatley does and by doing so he more or less automatically alienates the majority of his audience, who have more or less been conditioned to sit, watch, and be entertained. What he's asking of his audience is essentially subjective participation, for lack of a better descriptor. You, the person watching this movie, are forced to take part in it to enjoy it. You must become engaged in the experience.

You aren't lazy or stupid if you don't like this movie--and I bring this up because that's the way art house snobs typically view those who aren't into unintelligible, incoherent gibberish disguised as art, created to confound and show contempt for the bourgeoisie--and the kind of filmmakers I'm talking about almost always employ neo-Marxist terms like 'bourgeoisie' whenever they talk about the films they make, pretentious bastards that they are.

So yeah: feel free to not like this movie. Turn it off. Find something else, something you like. I liked it. I loved it, in fact. I'm just sorry I didn't watch it sooner, when it first came out, on a big screen somewhere.",1423872000,43,1514,4.864341085271318

5743076,4,B00CVVH2JI,"I completely understand the negative reviews. That having been said...

This film will go over the heads of a lot of people simply because they don't get the unusual, psychedelic, good verses evil, avaunt guard, intellectual aspect of this visual compelling, as well as emotional film.

The majority of people now a days just want a quick, mindless immersion into a fantasy that they can watch and absorb to escape their everyday boredom.  THIS MOVIE IS NOT THAT FILM. It has so many ""period based"" puns, Gothic humor, references and symbolism that most modern day ""I want to be entertain quick and shamelessly"" type people just do not, and will  not, get it.

NOW, that having been said, this film does drag on a bit (hence me dropping it to a 4 star film). But, the acting and Shakespearean stylistic essence of the film is very immerse. If you can read or watch Shakespeare, in period language, and be comfortable with that, as well as absorb The Clockwork Orange or Train Spotting then you should be able to easily understand and enjoy this movie.

Once again, this is not some fluff film that will simply let you get ""mind-numbed"" and then you go about your business after the credits roll. It is deep and gets even deeper. My suggestion to a potential viewer would be to pour a tasty beverage, make yourself comfortable and then (knowing full well its a mind bender and trip) enjoy the movie.

Excellent script
Quirkiness
Surrealism
Impeccable acting
Beautiful cinematography
Mysticism/Alchemy
Humor
Mushroom-induced weirdness

Some elements remind me of the other-worldliness found in Kubrick films. You either love that sort of thing or you don't.

The story itself, though isn't totally captivating and I found myself disappointed by what the treasure ended up being at the end.
I also have to just advise people who are considering watching it that the editing towards the end is rather jarring and unsettling. We're attacked by flash frames for a good 5 minutes and it does get annoying quickly.

Actors Michael Smiley and Peter Ferdinando have incredible performances integrating acting and voiceovers.

5743194,4,B00CVVH2JI,"Straightaway, I must say that director Ben Wheatley has created a film that I feel is indeed polarizing, to say the least! The plot, which involves a small group of 3 English Civil War deserters, an alchemist and his assistant, and a field in England, is very well explained by the above review by Robert Beveridge. The events all take place in 1648 England, and yes, all occur in a filed in England, which just happens to contain a circle of hallucinogenic mushrooms. That is on the surface, so to speak. I say this because, in this film, time and space don't have conventional meanings, but instead move at a different speed. Some viewers will find this film as some sort of pretentious slop, while others will consider it a masterpiece! The film is not recommended for anybody who does not have an open mind. Some will absolutely hate the film, while others will embrace it with both an open mind and heart, as well. That said, I shall move on and declare that the film is indeed surreal, and operates on several levels and layers, as well. Mysticism and folklore are indeed prevalent in this film. I found the cinematography, which is in B&W, to be excellent, and add an extra dimension to the story. I also found the musical score, which is a mix of electronica combined with acoustic, rustic guitar playing, to also add an additional dimension to the film. I found the film to be a bit too violent for my own taste, but really, it is framed by a war around it, so what should one expect. I found the acting, for the most part, to be very good to excellent, as well. I especially found Michael Smiley's devilish alchemist to be excellent! The sound mixing and sound editing also add an essential element to the film, and credit should be therefore given to Martin Pavey, who created the sound design. I feel strongly that the film holds up to and also necessitates repeated viewings to fully appreciate the craftsmanship involved in the making of the film, which was done on a small budget. It may very well be that I will fully appreciate the film even more after I watch it at least once more, in which case I would give it 5 stars. I found myself repeatedly impressed by the visual effects in the film. In addition, the final scene in the film completely changed my understanding of what exactly happened in that field! The running time of the film is 90 minutes, and the sound is Dolby Digital Mono, 1.85:1. The special features are quite impressive and include an audio commentary with director Ben Wheatley, producer Andy Starke and sound editor Martin Pavey, an interview with Wheately, camera tests reel, Master Class featurettes, a trailer, a very revealing 16 page booklet, which helps to explain some of the film through Director Wheatley's view, and a digital download.

5743198,4,B00CVVH2JI,"A Field in England (Ben Wheatley, 2013)

Four men walk across a field. One of them carries a pike; the other three are unarmed, which is somewhat odd considering that all four of them are, in various degrees, deserters from a battle taking place on the other side of a hedgerow from where they initially met. (What battle this is, presumably, I have been unable to figure out; the First English Civil War was over by 1648, but Cutler specifically mentions Oliver Cromwell at one point; I think Cromwell at the time was over in Ireland quelling the natives there in 1648.) One of them, Whitehead by name (Shaun of the Dead's Reece Shearsmith), is an educated man, apprentice to an alchemist, and he is on a mission. The othersJacob (Starred Up's Peter Ferdinando), Friend (Malevolence's Richard Glover), and Cutler (Velvet Goldmine's Ryan Pope)he's the one with the pikeare all men who had been more directly involved in the combat. But here I'm getting ahead of myself; at this point, the four of them are simply walking across a field. That scene, a long, stationary take about fifteen minutes into the movie, reminded me strongly  of a similar scene, coming at roughly a similar time, in Meek's Cutoff, where the three wives are walking in a very composed, very studied diagonal line behind the covered wagon. That sort of deliberate composition pervades A Field in England, as well, more so than any of Wheatley's other films to date.  It is a film that revels in its artifice, and because of that, I think, it's going to end up being polarizing; those familiar with Wheatley will find it either his best feature or his worst. I fall on the former side, just as I did with Meek's Cutoff.

As I said, the four of them are no longer a part of the battle. Cutler, the pragmatist of the bunch, recognizes that the four of them are basically deserters, then proposes the four form a band of their own, and cement the bond over a good meal at an alehouse in the area he knows of. They agree and start off across the field. (It is here that the scene described in the opening paragraph takes place.) They cross a line of mushrooms and, with far to go still, stop and work on filling their empty bellies. That, it turns out, may not have been the best idea, both because the mushrooms themselves would seem to be hallucinogenic, and because they are part of what would seem to be the border of England's largest fairy ring. However, during the meal, Whitehead asked the other three to help him on his mission: he is looking for a rogue alchemist, O'Neill (Wheatley regular Michael Smiley), who stole some valuable documents from Whitehead's master. If only it were that easy.

It would be simple, though inaccurate, to categorize A Field in England as an exercise in style over substance. There is certainly style to it, and in spades; this is Wheatley's most distinctive feature yet, stylistically, and that's saying something for the guy who came up with the final fifteen minutes of Kill List. But Wheatley has a lot to say here (and not just about indiscriminate ingestion of hallucinogenic substances); his trademark sharp, finely-observed characters, and the friendships that develop between them, lend the movie a weight it would not otherwise have. Wheatley also comes up with some inventive ways to get around what were likely budget limitations; the obvious example here is the delivery of the dialogue in the climactic scene. (I'm not trying to be obtuse, I want to stay on the safe side of spoilery. When you see it, you'll know it.) The main criticism I have seen levelled at the film, that it raises more questions about its plot than it answers, is accurate. I do not see this as a weakness. Your mileage may vary.

As a side note, the trailers for the film have made a pretty big deal of the war aspect. As a service to those who lack an interest in war films, I will note that the battle is a framing aspect that serves to fix the time of the story, at no point do we actually see any of the battle, though guns firing can be heard, and musket-smoke is visible behind the hedgerow, for the first five to ten minutes of the film. Unlike, say, Pan's Labyrinth, which switched back and forth between the reality of the war and the fantasy world, Wheatley gives us a few minutes of character introduction, as it relates to the war, and then spends the rest of the movie in the titular field.

Ben Wheatley has gotten better with every film so far. This made me look forward all the more to his next project (as of this writing, he's in the middle of both the Ideals feature and an adaptation of J. G. Ballard's novel High Rise). But until one of those comes out, hunt this down and give it a look. *** ",1397779200,28,4710,4.552538370720189
