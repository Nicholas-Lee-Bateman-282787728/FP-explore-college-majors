6339934,5,B00J9C0DRU,"The Arrow, The Flash, The 100, Tomorrow People, Vampire Diaries and Beauty & the Beast - All 5 star in my book.  Amazon's new pay all upfront for season pass now rather than by episode? 0 Stars.  Paying by episode as they occurred  through week didn't bust the budget.  Way to make it tougher on the customer, Amazon.

6340021,5,B00J9C0DRU,"This is by far the best season of arrow.  I loved how they put such a powerful foe like the league of Assasins to pit against team arrow this season, and how all the character's cane together to defeat them.",1500076800,,207,4.175

6340023,5,B00J9C0DRU,"After the shocking events at the end of season two, Arrow returns with a vengeance, and the stakes are even higher for Team Arrow. There are plenty of surprises in store this season, including a fun crossover with The Flash (continued from the eighth episode of that series), and some unexpected twists. Binge-watch the episodes. That is the best way to get the complete Arrow experience, either On Demand or Blu-Ray or DVD.

Of the special features, I have only watched the deleted scenes and the gag reel. The deleted scenes sadly don't amount to much, neither is there commentary from the producers and directors to justify their decision to exclude them, though the final cuts of the episodes are excellent.",1497484800,,711,4.87603305785124

6340027,5,B00J9C0DRU,I've never been into comic books and don't know the difference between DC and Marvel. Started watching Arrow a month ago and I LOVE IT!!

6340029,2,B00J9C0DRU,So I thought I was buying this brand new so far I had to skip disk two it was so Skippy and now I'm trying to pick up on disk 3 and it's still skipping every now And then disappointed because I already bought season 4!

6340101,2,B00J9C0DRU,"Lies, lies, and more lies.  When i reviewed the last season, I gave 4 stars. I said that the acting, the casting, the CGI, the fight scenes, and all the other technical aspects of the show were top-notch.  The only reason i dropped a star for last season was the CONSTANT AND INCESSANT Lying and finger-pointing.  This season was too much for me. Last season Oliver blamed someone for lying and refused to forgive them. Thea disowned everyone and ran away because they were hiding things from her, and yet now when its her turn to have a secret she does what?  LIES to everyone, even when Oliver is being 100% transparent with her.  I am so done. This is what it sounds like in my head:

""You lied to me, I will never forgive you!!"" ""Well you lied first""  ""No, you did.""  ""No, you!""  Blah blah blah blah blah blah just shoot me.",1489104000,,828,4.324675324675325

6340104,5,B00J9C0DRU,I love both this and the Flash!  I really like how they correlate and combine sometimes.  I would have to say flash is a little easier to watch with my younger kids but this one is a lot of fun too!,1488326400,,198,3.8048780487804876
6340130,1,B00J9C0DRU,This is a cheap knock-off. The printing on the DVD's is blurred and obviously been scanned and then reprinted. The disk's will play in my BluRay player but will not play in any of the 4 computer systems in the house. For a dollar more I purchased another set from a different supplier with no issues. I will not be purchasing anything else from this Roan company.,1487894400,,363,4.432835820895522

6340134,3,B00J9C0DRU,"We binge this and love the content; season two a bit cheesy, but it is the best superhero material on TV. The stars are superhumanly talented, both physically and theatrically!

That being said, this format is very undependable, which can ruin the experience. Season 1 of the BD set played through; season 2 had smudged discs and could not be cleaned--Amazon replaced; season 3 had a faulty disc 4, and fortunately we were within the time to return them. This time I elected just to refund, because I could not be assured the replacement would be any good. I just went with the stream online. I'll maybe buy them later when the price drops. Maybe.",1485907200,,647,4.626086956521739

So he is ARROW, big deal.  His uniqueness has gone.  Now everyone uses bows & arrows and too many people know his identity.  So now it's just another story - and it's 'OK', nothing amazing.
Those are the qualities that made the first 2 seasons GREAT!
Also, the story about him surviving on THE ISLAND for 5 years has changed leaving the idea misleading.",1479340800,,373,4.621212121212121

6340279,5,B00J9C0DRU,I enjoy this series. I like the characters and the storylines.  There is no reality to this show it is pure fiction and sometimes that's just what you need to get away from the daily demands we all face in life.  It does not hurt that the lead character is pretty on the eyes.,1477267200,,276,4.092592592592593

I soon will be placing a pre-order for it or as few people realize you can also wait for it to come out previously viewed and order it that way. Although the wait can be quite a while.

6340421,5,B00J9C0DRU,"This Season Three episode of ""Arrow"" completed a cross-over with Season One of ""The Flash"", as Barry Allen and his partners from Star Labs in Central City assist Oliver Queen and his team in facing down a boomerang-wielding assassin.  Digger Harkness' target is Lyla and her fellow A.R.G.U.S. agents.  The two superheroes will have a chance to compare notes and their respective psyches as they chase the elusive and manipulative assassin around the city.  There is a nice chunk of backstory for Oliver Queen as well as an emotional moment for Diggle.  Highly recommended to fans of both series.",1469059200,,595,4.97979797979798

This was a ""dark"" season in various ways; it seemed like no win no matter what Oliver Queen tried to do. The foil was well written and great acting and story material. It definitely kept us wanting to get to the next episode to see what was going to happen next.

The DVD series is too expensive, I think, at least as pre-order. Might reconsider that for the fourth season when it comes out on disk.
The Arrow series is not really a family series; too dark for young kids. Has a bit of sexual content as well that is not conductive to quality programming.",1457568000,,649,4.110236220472441

If you fast-forward every single part that Laurel is involved in, it makes the show a whole lot better. The second half of the season really picks up and makes it worth it though.

6340881,1,B00J9C0DRU,"I'm having trouble writing this review because I gauged out my eyes with green arrows.  The characters in this show continue to tunnel down into their own personal, unaware, self-centered, self-sabotaging, drawn out, dramas.  I'll wrap up the show for you, Oliver will continue to hide secret after secret with each secret being revealed to cause him to give unending, painful, exasperating, explanations that always end in ""I did it for you."" He will give his life a half a dozen times for others on the show only to be saved under ridiculous scenarios.  Laurel will continue to be self-centered  liability while getting her leather suit handed to her again and again by some no name criminal only to turn into a super ninja when it matters.  She will yell and scream and continually rail against any common sense.  Speaking of common sense, Dear Show Writers, Please write her out of this show!  Please!  If I have to listen to her one more time, I'll shove arrows in my ears as well.  Felicity, Oh Felicity, the ways in which you are bag of cats, crazy.  Is it how you blow off Clark Kent for the Arrow?  You do realize the Arrow's attraction to you is being driven by the appeal of forbidden fruit.  A weekend together will see him making a bow and arrow from toilet paper, a plunger, and shower rail and diving off the balcony to stop a pretend robbery just to get away from you.  Diggle seems to be the only character that the writers decided to give any common sense.  Diggle, move away from these nuts and go raise your child far away from Starling City.  Roy and Sarah, thank goodness you escaped this series of dysfunctional misfits.  I remember a time gone by when super heroes in the comics actually had their lives together when the mask was off.  These characters are drunks, drama queens, and narcissists with deteriorating social skills and or common sense. I remember the Green Arrow saving the day with wit and smile, this one apparently can only do it with self-loathing and psychological help for having multiple personalities.",1453248000,3,2047,4.673184357541899

------------
The Arrow has become a hero to the citizens of Starling City  but that doesnt mean that Oliver Queen can take his eye off the ball and lead a normal life in the spectacular third season of the hit series based on the DC Comics character.

A new wave of diabolical masterminds  from homegrown terrors inflicted by the resurgent Vertigo, the deranged Cupid, boomerangwielding Digger Harkness and bloodthirsty Danny Brick Brickwell to the insidious and pervasive havoc wrought by Ras al Ghul and the League of Shadows  threatens all he holds dear.

Team Arrow has grown into a powerful force, but the dangers and secrets that hold them together often put them at odds with each other, as the shadows cast by Malcolm Merlyn and the invincible Ras al Ghul trigger shifts in loyalties and allegiances that test the team to the core. For matchless heroism under fire, this actionpacked 5disc, 23episode Season Three cant be beaten!

Great story line, great acting; all the characters are good integrated and developed very nicely over the first two seasons. I'm not really a comic book fan per se (btw. I'm female); so I never read the Green Arrow comics but I love this show and the action of course. I like anyway anything that has nice action and and some great adventure/quest like touch to it and I like the darker, broken characters which are still good but don't play always on the ""official, legal"" side of things and take means in their own hands. Definitely watch Season 1 and 2 first so you have an idea about all the background about the Green Arrow and his friends, what happened and how they got to the point where they are now in Season 3. If you like action hero stuff, with some darker characteristics to it and some great story around it: Go for this show.",1451001600,2,973,4.3224043715847

There are always pros and cons with any show, but when it comes to Arrow, the best things about it are still the best things about it: Oliver Queen, Felicity Smoak, and John Diggle.  The plot got a little wobbly and I'm still not entirely sure what the big bad was trying to do exactly but who cares?  Fun to watch, full of action, a trio team that continues to build their friendship through trying times, some great twists, and FINALLY Oliver and Felicity getting on the same page.

6341150,3,B00J9C0DRU,"This is an honest review from someone who binge watched Season one through three.  When you binge watch something, you notice things you might not if you watched one episode per week.  Arrow is a silly, action packed show that is reasonably entertaining.  I'd say Season 2 was the highlight so far.  Season three was less good.  I think there are two things that hurt the show more than anything else:
1.  Melodrama--Arrow is pretty much a Mexican soap opera with costumes.  The characters may be in life and death situations, but they always find time for DRAMA, DRAMA, DRAMA.  And as soon as some pop music starts to play, you know a love scene is coming... and then there's Felicity crying.
2.  Repetitive dialogue--Seriously, if you took a drink of alcohol every time someone says ""Are you OK?"" or ""We need to talk"" you would die.  By season 3 I found myself cracking up every time someone said those phrases.

If you can get past those things, I think you'll enjoy this show.",1445731200,,980,4.574712643678161

OLIVER NEEDS TO DECIDE IF HE IS A VILLIAN OR A HERO ALREADY. ALSO, I ENJOYED THE INTERACTION OF OLIVER AND FELICITY WHEN THERE WAS NO ACTUAL ROMANCE, IT MADE FOR FUN, BUT ONCE THE LINE IS CROSSED, IT JUST TAKES SOMETHING AWAY FROM THE SERIES.  SOMETHING WAS LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION, SO TO SPEAK. THAT HAS BEEN RUINED. ALSO, HOW CAN SOMEONE TAKE A FEW BOXING LESSONS AND SUDDENLY BE ABLE TO BATTLE MEMBERS FROM AN ORGANIZATION OF PROFESSIONAL  ASSASSINS. FELICITY DRESSES LIKE A STREETWALKER AND NEEDS SOME TAPE ON HER WHINING MOUTH. THEA CONTINUES TO BE  COMPLETELY USELESS. THE PALMER CHARACTER IS CUTE BUT ANNOYING AND GOOFY.

6341179,3,B00J9C0DRU,"This 'review' is a combination of the quality of the TV show, the actual features in the Blu-Ray, and just overall easiness of the product.

Arrow Season 3 hits a sour note with many fans, myself included. While starting quite strong, the season became a hodgepodge of fan-service, questionable character motives, and a disappointing overarching plot and villain. This is of course in comparison to the likes of the first, and especially second, season - which were both outstanding views in their own respects. It's still a quality TV season overall, but it just was weaker than the previous two.

The Blu-Ray comes with the standard menus as the other past season Blu-Rays have. This includes the ever-slow-moving menu system that displays while watching an episode (if you choose to trigger it), as well as an option to view each episodes' deleted scenes. None of the deleted scenes are noteworthy save for a few, but it's still worth checking out nonetheless. The special features include the always-entertaining bloopers, as well as a 'special look' into how the costumes for each of the shows' characters were conceived/made. It's a one-time watch kind of thing that's neat.

Despite all of this...perhaps the biggest complaint I have regarding the Arrow Season 3 Blu-Ray is...no DVD combo. Season 2 came with both Blu-Rays AND DVDs...and came with the same initial asking price as the Season 3 Blu-Ray alone. Granted, that was a year ago - but the point still stands that it's outrageous to demand such a price in comparison to the previous Season release.",1445472000,,1563,4.980842911877395

6341226,5,B00J9C0DRU,"Season 3 of Arrow is infamous for being of lower quality than the previous two (I'm only discussing this season, if you want to know about the show itself, you should definitely start with the first one), due to the original lead writer moving to The Flash and characters suffering from bad changes and general lack of progression.  I used to think like that the first time I watched it.  Gladly, I purchased the Blu Ray and watched it again, and I have to say, the first impressions don't do this season justice AT ALL.

This season severely benefits from binge-watching, since you'll be less likely to forget plot points and details that you might lose if watching on TV schedule.  Another thing that benefits it are repeated viewings, since you will start noticing nuances you wouldn't have seen the first time.  In fact, upon my second viewing I realized the attention to detail and subtle foreshadowing for this season is only rivaled by Arrested Development.

Season 3 of the show kicks off with the eponymous character and his team being on the receiving end of the city's favor, but things quickly turn dark once one of their allies is murdered, which kickstarts Oliver's confrontation with one of the most fearless and determined foes from the DC universe: Ra's Al Ghul, and his League of Assassins, whose end goal turns the city against the Arrow.  Meanwhile, Oliver's personal life is turned complicated with the arrival of Ray Palmer, who takes posession of his company and is a rival for his love interest.  Curiously, though, Palmer also holds a certain interest for costumed justice.

The season's overaching plot is one of the most interesting yet, as Oliver is pitted against a foe who's his superior in physical and mental strength, but also makes him question his resolve and his legacy.  This is all wonderfully complemented by the acting, which is great all around.  Stephen Amell has played Oliver Queen since the beginning as a man with almost lost humanity, who's become emotionally distant and finds it hard to express his emotions, and, unfortunately, this has translated as people thinking he doesn't have acting chops.  On the contrary, every time something so powerful occurs that forces Oliver's emotions to come out, Amell does a fantastic job.  Look at the scene where he's convinced he's going to lose the love of his sister forever or the one where he hears his friend has died and he sells those expressions so well you will feel the pain inside you as if it all was happening to you.

While mostly all of the other characters do a good job too, major props should be offered to Matt Nable as Ra's Al Ghul.  He might be off-putting at first for fans of the source material, since he really doesn't look much like the character he's playing, but only one episode in and you'll realize he IS Ra's Al Ghul and those doubts will dissipate forever.

All in all, this season does a great job in moving the story forward and evolving the characters.  Don't let some bad opinions keep you from it.  And if you saw it before and didn't think much of it, give it a second chance.  It gets better.",1444521600,3,3121,4.683150183150183
6341227,3,B00J9C0DRU,"Love the overall show as the acting. Especially love the fight scenes. However, the storyline left much to be desired.  Even though only one episode has been shown for The 4th season, this season is looking better than last season.",1444435200,,231,4.775

6341239,5,B00J9C0DRU,"+++WARNING+++  This will contain spoilers from the prior season, and hints but no major giveaways from season 3.  If you have not seen the prior seasons skip past the first couple paragraphs.

Arrow is a show that keeps getting better, even with a very large ensemble cast (that has to an extent been trimmed down in some respects, but added to as well).  This season picks up after the events of season 2 and the battle vs Slade Wilson and the Super Soldiers.  Oliver is still reeling over the death of his mother, his sister having run off, and losing his company.  There is a major death at the end of the first episode, the ramifications of which carry through the entire season and a couple different showdowns with the League of Assassins and Ra's Al Ghul.

As with prior seasons the show is told partly in current time and partly through flashbacks showing the events of the 5 years Oliver was lost.  Where the first two seasons set the flashbacks on the island this year they are mostly in Tokyo, as was teased at the end of season 2, and at various points in the first two seasons when Oliver said and/or hinted that he was not on the island the whole time.  The flashbacks also allow for a couple of appearances of Tommy Merlyn during the season.

The main additions to the cast this year included Brandon Routh coming on as Ray Palmer who serves as an obstacle to Oliver in a couple respects, Matt Nable who does a great job as Ra's , and expanded roles for Katrina Law who plays Nyssa.and John Barrowman as Malcolm Merlyn.  It also sees shifting roles for Katie Cassidy and  David Ramsey as their characters play a larger role in ""Team Arrow"".  There are also multiple points in the season where characters from The Flash make appearances on the show including a full on cross-over episode, since the two shows share the same ""universe.""

For those who get the actual discs, the show looks and sounds great as you would expect.  Unlike prior seasons if you buy the blu ray you do not have to pay for the DVDs to be included.  The season is just on 4 blu ray discs.  For extras there are commentary tracks on the season premiere and the mid-season finale episode.  Deleted scenes on many, but not all, episodes, and then on the last disc a few behind the scenes and making of features, a gag reel, and part of the comic-con panel.  A decent amount of stuff for people who like to go through the extras.

Overall I think the show really has found its footing.  The acting and writing are very good, and the show is written well enough and gives all the characters enough to do that it does not get stale by the end of the season.  Which is hard to do for series that get 22-23 episode runs.  I think in that respect the larger ensemble cast helps.  Chances are if you are reading this you know what the show is, and have an idea of how you feel about it.  If you are just checking it out, you definitely need to watch the prior seasons first to know what is going on, but if you are a fan of the genre, it is definitely worth checking out.",1444262400,2,3049,4.3350970017636685

6341550,3,B00J9C0DRU,"After the surprisingly good freshman season and the superb second season, fans of DCs Arrow could understandably check themselves into the hospital with a nasty case of whiplash thanks to a third season that seemingly undid much of the goodwill the first two had garnered. Its as if, with DC finalizing that their movie and TV series would never cross over, and with Batman stuck as a teenager in Foxs Gotham, that the writers of Arrow decided they may as well start cribbing from Batmans greatest hits. And so, gone are the steady build-up of a villain over two seasons (as with Manu Bennetts Deathstroke) and the group dynamic that made even the darkest moments of Arrow fun to watch.  Left in their place is a villain (Ras Al Ghul) pursuing a storyline that belongs firmly in the Batman mythos and many of the fan favorite characters turned into dour, angsty versions of themselves.

It was a disappointing season to say the least, and the only real bright spots to speak of are the addition of Brandon Routh as would-be superhero Ray Palmer and the crossover episodes with spin-off series The Flash, which quickly overtook Arrow as the best superhero series on television.

The events of Arrows second season understandably left Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) and his team shaken in their conviction that they were up to the task of defending Starling City from the evils within and without, even as a thankful populace embraced the Arrow as a hero. However, with the police no longer hunting for them, Oliver decides maybe theres enough room in his life for an actual relationship with Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) and that things are looking up. Its a nice thought, but just as quickly Olivers life begins to fall apart: with newcomer billionaire Ray Palmer (Routh) buying Queen Consolidated out from under him; a disastrous first date reminding Oliver that his life as the Arrow puts his loved ones at risk; the return of Thea (Willa Holland) from her time studying under Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman); and the death of one of their own at the hands of an unseen archer.

All of this sends Oliver and his friends reeling, making them especially vulnerable as a new force descends upon Starling City that will forego the citys destruction in exchange for the acceptance of an offer made to Oliver that would take him from them forever.

Arrow has always had a soap opera sensibility, but in its third season that facet of the series threatens to take over completely as characters go in absurd directions for reasons designed to incite drama and not further character development. Even things like Olivers secret identity are sacrificed for the sake of some really shallow drama, and it would be great if it was at least a little unexpected but the third seasons writing is so sloppy that most of the twists are clear the instant they happen thanks to the power of coincidence (ie thing A happens and its then revealed person X is back in town). By the seasons end theres really no one left who doesnt know Olivers secret identity and who isn't involved in his team, and thats a bit ridiculous considering it only took three seasons for all the supporting players to get in on the act.

The character transformations this time around are also handled pretty poorly with Oliver merely becoming a more sullen version of himself with a new haircut, Laurel (Katie Cassidy) doing some very stupid things in an effort to take on her sisters mantle (at least when she was a drunk her poor decisions made sense), and Felicity being forced into the alternating voices of reason and desperation that need to be over-the-top or ignored by other characters so ridiculous things can happen unabated.

Whats worse is that the dual-timeline format of the show loses a lot of its impact thanks to the shift from the island to Asia changing things considerably and making Olivers secret history a bit more conventional. Yes, we get some insight into how Oliver knew Waller before she showed up back in the first season, but ultimately the scenes exist to endear Maseo Yamashiro (Karl Yune) to the audience in the past as his present poses an obstacle to Olivers plans. At least in the first and second seasons they served to deepen both Amell and Bennetts characters so that when they faced off as Arrow and Deathstroke in the second season there was significant history for the audience to draw upon. With the Asia flashbacks, we don't get that same depth.

All Arrow fans can really hope for is that the writers have gotten this out of their system and that the fourth system will be a return to form, because if not, Arrow will be better remembered as a two-season series.

6341551,5,B00J9C0DRU,"Has to be one of the best shows I have watched in a long time.  I by mistake started watching season 1 on netflix, and was so caught up in the story after a while.  I was glad I made the mistake.  After I got through the end up season 2, I was had.  I had to find season 3 so I purchased it on Amazon.  This is a really great show and it has something for everyone.  If you like suspense the show from the beginning is basically playing out 2 different stories at the same time in 2 different places.  If you like action there is plenty of that.  There is plenty of drama in that takes place in the show as well and some romance.  Just be aware.  I recommend going through and watching season one and two first.  Just be away once you turn on that first episode you will be captivated and your day is going to go down the drain because you will be stuck in from of that tv watching it all day.  The story line is well thought out and acted out, and you will always be wanting more.",1442793600,,981,3.9238578680203045
6341552,4,B00J9C0DRU,"Ive discovered just how hooked I am on superhero shows.  Granted, I always knew I liked the genre, but they are taking up an increasing amount of my TV viewing time, and Im not complaining.  Its been a recent development, too, since Arrow is the oldest of the shows Im watching, and it just finished up season three, which was another season well worth watching.

Season three picks up a few months after the second season ended.  Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) is hoping to buy back control of Queen Consolidated, but he fails when the company goes to billionaire Ray Palmer (recurring guest star Brandon Routh).  Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards), however, continues to work for team Arrow while helping Ray on secret projects at his company as his second in command.

Meanwhile, Olivers sister Thea (Willa Holland) has been out training with her father Malcom (John Barrowman), and Oliver and Diggle (David Ramsey) go out to bring her home.  Things are actually looking relatively quiet until a murder rocks everyones world.  With a new villain coming to town screaming for justice, Oliver has to figure out what happened.  Meanwhile, Laurels (Katie Cassidy) world is rocked and she takes another step toward her destiny.  But who is the killer?  And what can Oliver and his secret identity do about it?

As if often the case with TV shows these days, it would be really hard to jump in here.  Yes, its only season 3, but due to the ongoing nature of the story, youll miss out on a lot of character development.  With all the characters involved (and Ive left a couple out, actually), the season hits the ground running.  So start from season 1.  Not that youll regret it.

While Arrow has never been a light show, this season definitely went even darker than the previous two.  At times, that was good.  We got to see great growth in the characters and some wonderful acting by the cast.  On the other hand, it reached a tipping point late in the season, and I began to feel like it was just too much.  Fortunately, the season did turn around and end on a lighter note, and the rumors Im hearing about season four indicate it will keep that lighter tone.

Not that this season was completely dark.  Ray Palmer added some fun as he tinkers with his inventions and works on seducing Felicity.  Speaking of Felicity, her mom shows up for two episodes, and Charlotte Rosss performance in this guest role was absolutely wonderful.

In some ways, this season of Arrow was overshadowed by its spinoff, The Flash.  I absolutely loved that show, too, but why am I bringing it up now?  There was a crossover event early in the season and the characters popped up on each others shows several times, often revealing key plot points when they did that.  You don't absolutely have to watch both shows, but its so much fun youll definitely want to do so.

The show continues to be filled with great stunts and effects.  Its amazing what this show does on a TV budget each week.  The actors are at the top of their game as well.  I get the impression that they really do love their jobs, and it comes through in their work.

The flashback storyline this season does wind up tying into the season storyline, but, as always, I felt it was the weakest part of the show.  On the other hand, watch out for that mid-season cliffhanger.  Its a doozy.  And as you quickly move on to the next episode, remember I had to wait 6 weeks to watch the next episode.

The season consisted of 23 episodes, and naturally they are all here in their native widescreen and full surround sound.  Extras include two commentaries, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.  In the way of featurettes, theres one on the 2014 Comic-Con panel, one on the suits the superheroes wear, one on the set for this seasons villains lair, and one on creating Ray Palmers biggest gadget.

While season 3 of Arrow did grow too dark for a while, it was still well worth watching.  If you have been enjoying this show, youll be thrilled to add this season to your collection.",1442707200,,4009,4.566619915848527

6341842,1,B00J9C0DRU,"Coming from an avid fan of season 1, and disciple of it's nearly pristine sophomore year, this show has gone so far down the tube that it may never be fished out. The writing was just baffling, it's as if the producers were intent on smearing the shows integrity all over the fans faces. The biggest ball of creative muck came by way of the most disastrous ship since the Titanic, ""Olicity"", that has truly ruined this series. I can only hope it's not permanent. Other narrative squabbles include exasperating flashbacks, immature character growth, a timid antagonistic threat, and toxic level of heavy-handed melodrama. My only hope for the upcoming fourth season lies in the fact that the show has lost Jake Coburn, who was the worst writer on staff, responsible for some unrecoverable derailments. Co-developers Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg need to stop running around creating new shows every other second and finish what they started (along with weak-link Marc Guggenheim). The few bright spots of the season include winning interpretations of future small man Ray Palmer/The Atom (portrayed deftly by former Man of Steel, Brandon Routh); and under-appreciated Japanese warrior Katana (portrayed by the infatuating Rila Fukushima). If the series would just focus more on developing individual characters, one at a time, instead of making them all orbit Oliver/Olicity's gravity, it could easily defy the greatest of expectations.

And the mid-season, holiday break episode is a dozy.
But the finale episodes after that are a mess. Terrible writting and inane plots.
The writers waste characters: Ted(Wildcat) Grant, Lt. Shieve(In the Flashback scenes) and Ra's Al Ghul were under written or under played or miscasted.

Too many Felicity Crying scenes.
Less soap opera, more crime stories with action.
I want to see more of Green Arrow and less of Ollie. Embrace the custome.

Bradon Routh nicely plays Ray Palmer aka The Atom. But I'll overlook that Palmer is miswritten, He acts and sounds like Ted Kord aka the Blue Beetle.
Its seems they wanted Kord on the show but DC/WB said ""NO"". So they settle for Palmer.

6341962,5,B00J9C0DRU,LOVE IT!!!!  Great story line and each week the plot seems to have another surprise.  The characters are strong.  The actors/actresses are excellelnt picks.  Our local channel(CW) is playing game with our server(DISH) trying to get more $$$$ and has cut service to many providers.  Of course their timing shows their greed as this is the time for reruns of the 3rd season and as the new season will soon begin.

Trust me, 2.99 is cheap for a season finale when life happens and you can't watch it when it is originally broadcast.  Stephen Amell, John Barrowman, et al, have made this a must watch series for me.

6342369,4,B00J9C0DRU,"It's good adventure with a dose of fantasy sci-fi. Sometimes the writing or perhaps the acting leaves me cold. For example, the main character being so irrational at times: ""I refuse to believe my family/sister/mother is involved - I will not pursue that lead"". This is after his family/sister/mother were involved in so many strange or nefarious deeds prior to this statement. Wake up Oliver! Sometimes you are too irrational.

I had trouble understanding the drop-in of the Flash. Did I miss something?

I still like the Arrow. I am addicted, but a little more mature writing (see Dare Devil) would have been nice.",1438992000,,616,4.913461538461538

6342411,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I love most movies or tv shows that are sci go/fantasy so the bar is low, but I really did enjoy this. It's violent (but not HBO level violent) and action packed, while still having a good storyline, romance, and men without their shirts on. They don't let the violence or romance overshadow the story itself which I really appreciate. I feel like they let violence overshadow story in some shows. There's some humor as well.

I love that they also have strong female characters. I love that two Doctor Who characters are in this show.

So far this show is one of my favorites... I prefer it to the Dare Devil series. We also watch Agents of Shield... I think I prefer this show, but they're both quite good.",1438905600,,708,4.438461538461539

This show has everything that you need for entertainment.  Action, Romance, and hot guys with their shirts off for absolutely no reason (not complaining) tie this show together and then throw in snappy dialog and cool plots and you have Arrow. The character is dark and brutal and like a I said he loves to take his shirt off for no reason. But it's so great. The show does a good job of following the original comic and developing the characters in a way that is really interesting. I can only hope that TV continues to put out more comic book based shows.

6342865,3,B00J9C0DRU,"The Arrow , have to say sadly I have reduced my score for this show.  The first season was fantastic, action packed and Gritty ,  the second and third season it just became more and more and more about everyone's personal lives and relationships and Drama ... I was so so happy they finally killed off Sarah (Canary) as she could  not act her way out of a paper bag. There was absolutely no chemistry between her and Oliver or Her and Nyssa al Ghul and it was all just a mess of bad writing. And then Laurel becomes Canary ,good grief .
  The show just became to much about everyone's family and I could care less about Thea's relationship with malcom .
  Everyone was Kung Fu Fighting,  Roy,Thea,Laurel,  I mean come on really ? Every single person suddenly has a Rocky Balboa training routine and they are kicking elite assassins passes left and right,  they should all get a montage to really bring out the cheese factor .. and now they brought back Sarah on the new show as Canary ( that shows gonna Suck ), just watching a preview and its already cheesy one liners, no chemistry and did I mention Sarah is back to torment us with her horrible acting :(

They ended off in a decent place so hopefully Arrow gets back to what it was in season 1 but without all the drama and extended family nonsense, if I wanted Drama and family issues I would watch a soap opera",1437177600,2,1366,4.317647058823529

This season, especially has provided ample amounts of action, drama and edge of your seat suspense.  I've never read a single Green Arrow comic to know how true to the comics the story line plays.  I am not particularly a fan of DC comics in general, so I wasn't sure when I started season 1 that I would like this show.  But I've been caught with the dilemma of getting some sleep and watching one more episode almost every time I watch.  I'm sure the comic fanboys (and girls) will say that there are inaccuracies between the comics and the show. There have been a couple things that I'm not sure if I've missed or if they haven't explained (for instance where Oliver is getting his money this season) but it's fiction... I can let it slide.

I think that overall this show is great and can be enjoyed by both the comic fandom and those who don't follow the comics as well.",1436745600,,1035,4.304123711340206

Fast forward to about 2 months ago, when a friend was in town and he got us to start watching it. My boyfriend and I were instantly hooked! Just like any ""superhero"" story, there are some predictable plots/events here & there, but this was overall very well done. The character growth and the relationships between the characters are complex and developed in a way where they don't feel fake or rushed. Also, the tying in of other heroes (such as the Flash) was pretty cool, too.

Now that I'm all caught up, I can't wait until season 4 in the fall!",1435622400,2,632,4.401709401709402

6343154,3,B00J9C0DRU,"Arrow has become a sensation of sorts by bringing impressive production values, great CG work, incredible stunts/action sequences and stern direction to a comic book adaptation, of which doesn't happen often enough. Now three seasons in, Arrow was on the up-and-up, but after an absolutely brilliant mid-season finale, season 3 plumetted to unfathomable depths. The characters were written poorly, the acting was uneven, and the writing became lazy and unbearable, especially what was one of the worst season finales i have ever seen, and this is coming from an Arrow fan.

Now, the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1, is because of what's in store for the Warner Bros. blu-ray release. I'm sure the audio and video quality will have improved over the first two seasons (even if just a tad bit), and will be packed with more features, as they continually added more, with a bit in season 1 and more in season 2. So, my rating is for the blu-ray. The season itself would get one star from me, as the finale and other episodes of the season did a massive disservice to major characters such as Deadshot, Arrow himself, Arsenal, and most importantly, Ra's al Gul in the most idiotic and horrid way possible. I won't spoil it for those who still like the now-growing ""superhero soap opera,"" but i will say, don't waste your time or money. I cannot see the writers coming up wih anything worth-while after this abomination, and I fear for their show Flash, as that's a series that continually gets better with every passing episode.",1435536000,3,1530,4.7518796992481205

There is a lot more annoying bad acting moments and bad story lines. The flash backs are literally sooo stupid and confusing this season. For me, the show took a bit of a bad turn and I hope that will be fixed back to the great Arrow series we had for 2 seasons!",1435104000,,436,4.0813953488372094

6343207,3,B00J9C0DRU,"First they tarnish Felicity's character by making her into some sexualized hacker rebel then into a Laurel-champion. Seriously, all she does now is side with Laurel, give pep-talks to Laurel and praise Laurel. Every main character except Felicity is now a superhero. Who is there left to protect? The graphics are nice, the dialogue lacks humor and it's obvious the writers didn't expect Felicity and Oliver to be such a hit and thus they are struggling to depreciate her value so that fans will welcome the idea of Oliver with someone else. Honestly though, I hate to say this but does anyone care who he is with? There is no female on this show he hasn't bedded unless they're geriatric or related to him. I wouldn't be surprised to find out he had an affair with the argus lady or Tatsu (think I spelled that right). Removing Laurel would be a great start to improving the show. Also, his son has yet to be mentioned again though he ran into the baby's mother. At the end of this season the most infuriating pill to swallow was the writer's insistence of Oliver's and Diggle's deep bond. To say he was closest to him than anyone is such an insult. He had only known Diggle for 3 years, he had known Laurel for much longer and Tatsu's husband for longer as well. Regardless, I think this show is decent if all you care about are the action scenes. The first season was best. If only this show would stop trying to force feed us what they want and just go with the response of the viewers it would improve drastically.",1435017600,3,1519,4.467625899280575

6343256,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I wish I could give this show more than 5 stars.  It is completely entertaining with action scenes that are movie caliber.  You have the characters, villains, etc. of the comic books and yet the creators/writers are writing their own story, which is a plus to me.  Stephen Amell is perfect as Arrow and the rest of the cast is just great.  Each season has really built on Oliver Queen's journey to becoming Green Arrow.  Season 3 was darker, but I have just binge watched the entire season and I think the identity theme was necessary in his journey.  Season 3 has some of the best episodes to date in the Arrow/Flash crossover episodes, The Climb, Public Enemy, Broken Arrow, The Fallen, and My Name is Oliver Queen.  Amell and Grant Gustin are really wonderful on screen together as Arrow and Flash.  I love Oliver's relationships with his sister Thea and with Diggle.  Also, his relationship with Roy/Arsenal was fun to watch this season. And, I have definitely loved his relationship with Felicity for the last 3 seasons.  Emily Bett Rickards has been a joy to watch for 3 seasons.  I believe the way Season 3 ended really opened the door for Season 4 to be a little bit lighter, with Oliver being happier.  Looking forward to Oliver's sense of humor coming out.  Amell and the rest of the cast have proven they can do humor as well as serious.  Can't wait to get my copy of Season 3 and really looking forward to Season 4.",1434585600,6,1427,4.5234375

6343279,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I have been following Arrow since it premiered in 2012 and have been really believe in the show but to me season three didn't quite reach the same level of greatness as the first two amazing seasons. Dont get me wrong, I loved season three and it is must see tv but it just seemed a little unfocused compared to its predecessors. The season finale wrapped up things nicely and felt more like a series finale to me. It is going to be interesting to see where the writers take season four.

At times, the season can be a bit 'heavy' for a show based on a comic book character.

6343673,3,B00J9C0DRU,"No! There is zero way this season could earn perfect scores. Now, the Flash (2014) season 1? Yes, I gave it an absolute warm review because of it's happier pledging to DC fans tone. But 5 stars? You have to be in denial or crazy to think season 3 of Arrow was ""amazing.""

In the show's timeline, Arrow almost immediately downgrades (if not already more) into ridiculous TV soap opera territory after its amazing second season. What probably sounded awesome on paper for a Green Arrow vs Ras 'al Ghul's league of the assassins plot in a comic book, the results are completely underwhelming and tedious CW TV narrative. The side plot lines introduced earlier int he season can be considered the best parts compared to the main plot. Repetitive situations, dialogue, themes played out more here which resulted the show to lose an audience's interest before and after the mid season break. It also doesn't help that the show likes to center on characters that tie the story down when it doesn't need to. The main part is Ollie's tasks to uncover the murder of a teammate and resolving where he left Thea off...it's not that much fun as it sounds. Look, I love John Barrowman from Dr. Who and Torchwood, but he's become a real bore here!  Laurel does get better, but something about her acting or presence still doesn't quite solidify her as a good character. Felicity can be great but the random love triangle between her, Ollie, and Ray Palmer ultimately feels like a waste of time. The writers tried to play it out like it had significance, but it really doesn't.  There were highlights in season 3 that did make the internet happy such as the ""you said it couldn't be done"" boxing glove arrow moment. Even the mid season break plot twist had a ""Game of Thrones"" type of shock or surprise. However, as soon as the show came back on the air, it was short lived and a wasted opportunity that most DC fans shook their head at. If you get a buzz during this season, it wears off fast and you immediately question ""why do I bother?"" Strangley though, the crossover episode in this season was better than the one corresponding for the Flash. It's like the show switched directors or writers. it shows how much a droll watching Arrow can be when it affects another show. To make the matters worse, even Ollie's flash back sections are the worst.  They added more muddle to an already muddle plot and I wished they never bothered. They are tedious and boring compared to Ollie escaping the island and how Deathstroke came to be from season 2. Sigh, and I think we have 2 more years of this...

I'm not going to say that this season was absolutely terrible. It's watchable with parts that can catch your attention span if you need something to play while you do housework, exercise, or pay bills. But a chore itself to get through even if you are a fan of the show. I don't understand how nobody could not see the show got worse here. Hell, watching a ""bad episode"" of the Flash was a relief compared to some of the awful ones in season 3. I still can't wash the bad taste out after the Cupid's first appearance.  If you have to collect this season because you are a fan, I wouldn't pay the full price for it. The boring moments outweigh the fun ones so don't expect greatness here. Now that I think of it, I'm starting to think I was too harsh on season 1.",1432857600,2,3346,4.468085106382978

The 2nd season was less interesting because the Arrow becomes this irritating self ritious commercial super hero who doesn't kill anymore because he's a ""good vigilante"". By half way through the second season, everything got a little repetitive. There's a bad guy that only the Arrow can stop, Oliver loves a girl and thinks he can be happy but then he realizes that he can't blah blah blah..... I'm half way through season 3 and it is getting harder to maintain interest. All of his friends seem to have found out that he's the Arrow and now they are all vigilantes too. That idea is particularly terrible to watch. Even his ex girlfriend Lorel now goes out at night with a Zorro mask on to best up criminals with a stick. They must have hired writers from Beverley Hills 90210 and bay watch for their ideas to be this annoying to watch.

-- Felicity CRYING every single episode - her character was completely ruined after the Oliver romance
-- The unnecessary and irrelevant flashbacks (which, by the end of the season, were LITERALLY less than a minute long)
-- The Ras al Ghul story arc - long, overdone and out of place - forcing Oliver, the hero of the superhero show, into a villain role, basically. Turning the second most important character, Diggle, against Oliver.

6344009,2,B00J9C0DRU,"I wavered between two and three stars for this review. There were a few good moments in Arrow's third season; just barely enough to make it watchable. But ultimately, the truly pathetic finale lost the show another star in my book.

This may come as a surprise to those who watched Season 2. I will readily say that I still consider that year of Arrow to have been one of the finest examples of televised superhero storytelling in history. It did an amazing job showing us Oliver's evolution from a murderous vigilante into a genuine hero. Like many others, I was eager to see where the showrunners took the story next.

Here's the spoiler-lite version of how it all went wrong. Please note: Coming up next are big spoilers for Season 2 and some mild spoilers for Season 3.

Things start out okay in the first episode. The stage is set with a scene that illustrates Oliver's identity crisis (no geeky DC Comics pun intended) between his Oliver Queen and Arrow personas. This, apparently, is the theme which the writers intended to drive the season. Then a shocking crisis occurs, sending all of Team Arrow in a tailspin. It's an intriguing beginning, but cracks soon begin to show.

The first issue is the relationship between Oliver and Felicity. On the basis of fan demand, it would appear, the writers chose to embrace ""Olicity"" wholeheartedly. This proves to be a big mistake. Emily Bett Rickards is very good at the role she played in Arrow Seasons 1 and 2 - the fun, geeky tech wiz who injects some comic relief into the Arrow's dark world. She doesn't work quite so well as the romantic partner to a brooding vigilante. There was much comment this year from fans on the fact that Felicity cries in basically every single episode. It seems on the surface like a bad acting decision on Rickards' part, but in fairness, the scripts give her character a lot of reasons to cry. Which brings us to the next problem of Season 3: it's basically one crisis after another. The characters are never given room to breathe. No one is hurt more by this than Roy Harper, who is shuffled around from episode to episode like an insignificant pawn. Thea gets some fun moments, but is also treated so badly by various people that I'm surprised more feminists aren't crying foul. New guy Ray Palmer is funny enough, but feels out of place in an already bloated cast. The controversial Laurel Lance, ironically, is the only character who actually gets a good arc this year, finally becoming a strong and likable foil to Oliver.

Then there's the plot logic, or lack thereof. The storylines in this season simply do not make sense. Most of them revolve around one character inexplicably keeping a secret from another. It's literally impossible to keep track of who doesn't know what by the middle of the season. It's tiresome and soapy. Perhaps the worst result of all this is that by the end of the season, Oliver is established to be nothing more than a lying, manipulative creep who systematically hurts everyone close to him and suffers little if any consequences for his actions. This is not the Oliver Queen I remember from the comics, or even from earlier seasons of this show. His character arguably fares better in the flashback scenes, but this element of the season is of little redeeming value. The answer to what Oliver was doing in Hong Kong during the third year of his exile is frankly pretty boring.

There's one last glaring issue with this season, but it will require some bigger spoilers to explain. *SPOILERS START HERE*

It's eventually revealed that Malcolm Merlyn's actions are the driving force for most of the problems our heroes face this year. He's desperate to get himself off the League of Assassins' hit list. Now, we all know that Malcolm was put on that list in the first place for trying to destroy a large portion of Starling City, which was apparently against the League's code of honor. But in an absolutely ridiculous contradiction, the threat Team Arrow has to deal with in the finale is the impending destruction of ALL of Starling City BY RA'S AL GHUL HIMSELF. How does this even begin to make sense? The entire season is built on a massive plot hole.

*END OF SPOILERS*

I'm saddened by the shocking loss of ground in Arrow's third year. It's very telling that the characters are actually at their best when they appear in crossover episodes on The Flash. Something is very wrong with Arrow, and it needs to be fixed if this show is to ever regain its original level of quality. But given the tangled mess of poor resolutions the final episode leaves us with, I can't help but think that it's going to be very difficult to repair the damage that's been done. I'll definitely be watching next year, but only in hopes that one of my favorite shows hasn't lost its way completely.",1431648000,9,4804,4.648998822143699

6344206,5,B00J9C0DRU,This entire show is amazing! Stephen Amell plays the character to a T! He is the most lovable yet frustrating character I have ever watched. Felicity is the heart of the show and has become my favorite female actress! Two thumbs way up!!,1430956800,,237,4.534883720930233
6344207,3,B00J9C0DRU,"The third season get's a little more soap-opera like.  Depending on your taste, that's good or bad.  What I definitely didn't like are the ""walking dead"".  Without giving away spoilers, let me just say that there were several eye-roll moments where I said to myself ""Him/Her AGAIN?""  I mean, is this a zombie show or a superhero show?  I don't follow the comics closely, so perhaps this is all cannon, but it's a bit annoying.  Also, in this season, nearly episode seems to end in a cliff-hanger.

The individual plots and shows range from boring ""Canaries"" to the entertaining ""The Climb"".  This is the least engaging of the series so far, but it's still decent enough to be worth watching.",1430956800,4,691,4.7
6344208,3,B00J9C0DRU,Not as good as first two seasons. Needs better writers.,1430956800,,55,4.6

6344210,2,B00J9C0DRU,"I'm not sure which is worse: that they turned the Green Arrow into a bumbling, humorless chump or that they turned what could have been a good story into a cliched, tiresome soap opera. Everyone and their dog knows his ""secret""  identity, he can't win a fight to save his life, and he's as dumb as a post. Their treatment of other characters like Black Canary and Wildcat is even worse.

If you like shallow pointless relationships between characters that aren't even smart enough to belong in a comic book, then this is the show for you.",1430784000,3,538,4.536082474226804

6344244,2,B00J9C0DRU,"I loved season one: he had direction and purpose and got the job done while we were teased by what happened to him on the island by being shown flashbacks. By season 2 he is confused and angry and unable to take advice.

Now, season 3. People that have died keep showing up alive, and not just showing up but arriving on the scene with awesome ninja abilities. Then his sister and his ex-girlfriend start training to have awesome ninja abilities as well. And we find out he left the island at some point for Hong Kong. I can only guess that during this time he learned some awesome ninja abilities. You can read the synopsis online for the episodes and save yourself a lot of time.

It had great promise, but in my opinion they've lost it.",1430697600,3,739,4.3478260869565215

6344664,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I found this show on Netflix. With very little time for television, I usually just poke around Netflix until I find something I like. I found the first season there and loved it. Stephen Amell is a wonderful actor in that he let himself grow into this part... it's like you watch it and are part of it at the same time. It takes the viewer along for the ride. You're not standing on the outside looking in. The whole cast is great. The design side of this show is stellar. Wonderful cinema photography, lighting, sets... the whole ball of wax. The story is fun. Once in awhile you find yourself talking to the laptop (or television) but that's all part of the fun. It's simply wonderfully entertaining. And that's the idea!",1429228800,5,723,4.484848484848484

6344667,5,B00J9C0DRU,Season 3 is a great season creative and full of suprises. Just wasn't too fond of Arsenal at first but he grew on me and I even started to well up when Roy came up behind Felicity and Diggle and was alive afterall. Thea getting stabbed and killed pretty shocking. I knew the Lazarous pit would come into play soon enough but the preview show someone whom I think is Thea jumping out like shes in the Exorcist..... (kind of creepy). Anyway question is why didn't Sarah get the Lazarous treatment? Too far gone i'm assuming. Anyway great season but seasons 1 and 2 were great as well. Im hooked like I was with Smallville.,1429228800,,620,4.4
6344668,2,B00J9C0DRU,"I can't stand the poorly done fight scenes. Hey producers, don't be so cheap, get someone like Jeff Imada (Bourne movies) to coordinate your fight scenes. Please don't over do it though, using lots of wires like most Chinese movies would be insulting too.

6344695,3,B00J9C0DRU,This show is just getting worse. Rising people from the dead and changing the soul we are better off watching Twilight. This show needs better writing and better story. The first season was great and the second was ok but this season basically stinks. The only good part is the Atom who is the only non-serious character in this show. The season started off great and just got worse over time. I am beginning to not liking this show at all. So I am begging if CW wants to continue this show than start making more better stories without the whole supernatural demon stuff. That is the only way how this show is going to get better.,1429056000,2,631,4.401709401709402

6344821,3,B00J9C0DRU,The season isn't over yet but after last seasons great showing I only hope this season picks up soon. I really only started watching because I got into the CW's new Flash show and have been really surprised by how good the first two seasons are of Arrow. The inclusion of the League of Assassins has been great however I feel like there needs to be more done with the Atom and Felicity's characters to flesh out his story. Now I'm only on episode 18 and there are plenty more episodes to fill in the season. So Im excited to see more of the crossover between shows and the inclusion of not only more villains but new heroes as well. I enjoy this show a lot. If the rest of the season gets better I'll increase my score. It's a solid show.,1428364800,,738,4.204225352112676

But, because of my son's urging, who grew up collecting comic books, I gave this show a chance. And I'm so glad I did  because it is now one of my two favorites. (The other being WALKING DEAD, which is a different genre.)  ARROW has interesting and very engaging story lines with surprising twists and turns, lots and lots of great action, wonderful actors portraying interesting characters, and even romance and star-crossed lovers. I have actually stayed up to four o'clock in the morning watching episode after episode, like reading a good book I simply couldn't put down! I congratulate the writers who are talented enough to create something so appealing to adults of any age. I will mourn the day this show has to end, which I hope is a long time away.

6345042,5,B00J9C0DRU,"Out of all supernatural, Sci-Fi, action hero, effects and imagination packed series that I have seen produced lately, Arrow and The Flash are the top of my list and by far better than everything else. I actually only like these two. Interesting, pleasant for the eye with the amazing outfits, equipment, weapons, fighting scenes and sets, although using comics as they're basis for the story line, they have taken them further, to another dimension. There is a lot of imagination, amazing creativity and tasteful choices in them.
I also think Arrow without Stephen Amell and The Flash without Grant Gustin, wouldn't be close as good as they are. In fact the two of them bring them to life.
Then there is the rest of their respective crews adding to the cast strength. I can hardly wait for the next seasons.
Arrow always brings a twist, never boring and never fading from season to season. It has successfully pushed to three so far.
I have mentioned both series although Arrow was and still is my ""fist love"" because The Flash has a similar effect on me and leaves me with similar impressions.",1427673600,,1094,4.732984293193717

In my opinion, season 3 has been a muddled mess, and the show has gone off track with the characters and the trope plot lines.  It has way too much of a soap opera feel, and has lost focus on the things that I loved most about the show...the Oliver, Diggle, Felicity team dynamic, and the Arrow as the actual star of his own show.",1427328000,,475,3.9789473684210526

6345469,2,B00J9C0DRU,"Seasons 1 and 2 were great. The Flash spin off show is beyond great, but to me, Season 3 of Arrow has gone down hill. Laurel as Canary makes me wince. The addition of Ras Al Ghul on this show is absolutely ridiculous. If the show's writers were smart, they would have left Oliver dead for at least 4 episodes, developed the Canary a little more and made her just a tad more of a serious character -- maybe beefing up her fighting skills with Wildcat -- something more than what we got. They also could have developed the store line of the Omega. A lot more could have happened, but instead, we are left with ""heroes"" that like Bondage Fettish wannabe's who now, for some reason, want to save Malcom Merlyn and cheesy lines from Thea, who after all that training, couldn't even beat that DJ who tried to kill her. The only redeeming quality of this show is Ray Palmer and Felicity, but now even Felicity, this season is getting on my nerves. P.S. The Cupid episode? Beyond stupid!! And please --- bring back Deadshot!!! The actor and the character was so cool. The writers already destroyed ""The Return"" and any possibility, it seems of Deathstroke coming back to haunt Oliver. More Tommy flashbacks are always great too.",1425859200,2,1220,4.55

We are very active, professional, hard working baby boomers (MD and an Engineer) and this series keeps us young and thinking we can actually be Super Heroes without having Super Powers only by honing our God given talents.
Doesn't get better than that.

I don't understand why Moira left the show because I loved her role and acting.

6345604,4,B00J9C0DRU,I would give this Show a million stars if it weren't for Laurels character. I have tried to like her from the beginning but she has been irrelevant the entire time and still continues to be but now they are trying to force her to be more relevant and failing miserably. She should have never been brought into The Quiver aka the arrow cave. and i thought Sara as black canary was bad and good lord Laurel is a billion times worse I hate her character and the only way to restore the balance that season 3 has lost is to kill her off don't turn it into a story line make it a 100% legitimate car crash and forget she ever existed. This show is supposed to be Oliver and diggle kicking but and Felicity being smart and nerdy in a cute way not Laurels confrontations with Oliver as the main story line PLEASE KILL HER OFF YOU WILL BE THANKFUL YOU DID SAVE THE SHOW ARROW,1425340800,2,867,4.166666666666667

6345643,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I'm being completely serious. When I watched the first episode of Arrow, I was a little sceptical about whether the show will live up to the stellar reviews. Only a couple episodes later I was completely hooked I couldn't stop watching! The show makes you laugh, cry, smile, jump, scream, and makes your jaw hit the floor more than once. This show has a lot of those aspects that keeps you coming back week after week. Every season the story becomes more and more interesting and complex and connected. You really find yourself getting attached to the characters and always trying to see how they will solve the ridiculous situations that are presented before them. All in all, this is the tv show that you will never become tired of.",1425254400,,734,4.653846153846154

The cast continues to be solid, but we can still learn a lot from them. I would like to see Digg get more action time on screen and back stories. Roy needs to stop shaving his eyebrows, it's getting weird. Laurel stills needs more training. She seems to heal magically well for getting beat up. It's still a good show, and so far, worth watching.",1425081600,,514,4.364583333333333

6346113,5,B00J9C0DRU,I didn't watch the show because I had seen similar attempts that had really cheesy acting.  A coworker recommended I give it a try and now this is one of my favorite shows.  The flashbacks are pretty neat.  They give you a basis for how the Arrow's past is impacting current events.,1423872000,,282,4.384615384615385
6346114,2,B00J9C0DRU,"If you liked Season 1 and 2, you'll probably hate this season. Witness the downfall of a fun character Felicity as she turned into a whiny teenage girl. Also see Laurel have a character development to become BC to a few scenes and barely no training scenes making her skills look weird. And lastly, and my own disappointment, watch an awesome villain Ra's Al Ghul be wasted miserably. I blame Marc G for listening to Olicity fangirls and making Felicity have more crying scenes than having an important character development for Laurel. Oh and a terrible Season Finale after hyping it up. I'll say just watch the premiere, midseason finale, and the episode where Laurel suits up cause those are the only good episodes. Skip this disappointing season and just watch Season 4.",1423699200,3,774,4.827067669172933

6346129,3,B00J9C0DRU,"Shows like arrow I hope are going to looked upon as pioneers in comic book media going forward into the future.  Whatever flaws the show has DC is at least willing to put masked comic book heroes on the screen.  For too long we have been subjected to big budget movies that try to take heroes, make them too real and bring them into our world.  Marvel has proven time and time again that they are ashamed of their own source material.  Arrow and others shows like it are not afraid of comic book costumes or the kind of one liners we see in the pages of our favorite graphic novels.  I would give the show 5 stars if they had given a few of the characters more cannon treatment and didn't stuff the show with segments of crappy CW drama.  I hope the show keeps doing well so that maybe it will encourage Hollywood to give real super hero movies a shot.",1422921600,2,852,4.196319018404908

6346153,5,B00J9C0DRU,"This season of Arrow has taken a very interesting turn.  We are finally seeing very significant levels of character development on the upturn of the arch, and it is paying off!  Continued brilliant acting, interesting present and past plot development (though, I am starting to get a little worn out with the past plot).  The new intertwining of Flash and Arrow 'verses is really bringing DC-TV-verse to another level...  More heroes are definitely on the way!

Pros:
Action!
Excellent continued plotline
Twists and turns
Intriguing characters
More hero origins!!!

Cons:
Having to wait for the next episode, honestly.  Though, not really Arrow's fault.
Several plot elements are becoming a little tired.  Ready to see characters bloom.",1422662400,,736,5.2844827586206895

I was intrigued by him and Fellicity Smoak so I did a MARATHON of Arrow on Netflix starting with the Season 1, Episode 1. I was smitten. Couldn't stop watching it one episode after the other. Season 3 wasn't on Netflix so then I turned to Hulu, but, it started at Episode 5 which is why I purchased Season 3, Episodes 1-4. I LOVE THIS SHOW and my favorite character, out of all of them, is Fellicity Smoak.

6346695,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I really like this series due to it's traditional ""good vs. evil"" plot.

The main characters in the series exhibit the time honored qualities of loyalty, dedication, self-sacrifice and the importance of family.

There is violence for sure, but I feel that it is somewhat offset by it's other positive attributes.

The character, Oliver Queen, exhibits most of the qualities we respect in a person (in Season 2 and 3). I can't say the same of Oliver's character in Season 1, which was a bit more ""dark"".

Overall, it's well done series that I hope continues into the future.",1419292800,3,573,4.757575757575758

I realize this is in real life , but I don't see where it adds anything to the story. This is about entertainment, if I was looking for real life I would watch the news or some documentary.

Characters are interesting, story line is one of constant resurrection (hey, I thought he/she was dead), and the bringing of comic book heroes/villains to life.

More sexy scenes in the first season than any other season.  Violence is what you would expect.",1418688000,,410,4.828571428571428

I like the use of DC Comics backstory: Nanda Parbat, Ras Al Ghul, and, especially, Barry Allen.  But it does not consistently hold my interest.  I'd rather read Fritz Leiber, play Zelda, Oracle of Seasons, listen to Pete Townshend, or watch The Mike Tyson Mysteries.",1418688000,,454,4.580246913580247

6346888,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I avoided watching Arrow at first for no particular reason. Then one day I tried it out and must say that I truly enjoy this series. The show starts off slowly feeding the back story to Oliver Queen and how he ends up becoming the arrow while he struggles with his identity in the present. At first, considering how any show with approximately 22 episodes in a season is expected to sort of drag on, this show has a good enough story that really adds intrigue to 'the arrow' and why he is who he is. In season 3 for example, after I started to watch the flash, I enjoy the arrow but didn't really believe that he had any chance against the flash. Yet, the most recent crossover between the two shows did a wonderful job of building up both shows and it's characters, rather than diminishing one or the other. Stephen Amell, in the flash episode called 'The flash vs. the arrow' I believe, he says, ""You're really fast Barry but being fast has nothing to do with discipline and precision."" Then, the story just continues to play out in a way where the flash is fast, but goes to show he is not a soldier at heart...yet. In many ways they are heroes but very different and yet childlike, but also childish. For instance, there's a moment where Amell is interrogating this female psychiatrist about Cupid and she says 'maybe you should think about seeing a shrink'. But, all you can think about is, well, 'why don't you try living on a deserted island full of people who want to capture and kill you after seeing your father who admitted a whole bunch a stuff just kill himself....and more. The last episode with Ra's al' Goul or whatever was awesome. Love it. '",1418601600,35,1659,4.42483660130719

6346897,3,B00J9C0DRU,"Arrow's plots continue to build. The shorter plots are better ones less dragging of the feet. The plot leaving it at a cliff hanger over the winter break, the death of Sarah (Black Canary) is good but I'm disappointed that it went the way of her death already especially since she is, in the comics Green Arrows love interest. I'm disappointed that if they try to bring back the character as some comics do she will have to be replaced with another actor. She was already replaced from the first season when they thought she died on the ship having to react that scene. I know there are cross overs but to bring Batman nemesis Ra's al Ghul. That is saying that Green arrow has none of his own good nemesis'. I was disappointed in the last act of Oliver climbing the mountain to face Ra's al Ghul. Oliver has had 7-8 years of training and even with his ""LOVE"" for family and determination to protect them he put up a horrible fight against  Ra's al Ghul. Then to be tossed off the side of a mountain, after having a sword shoved into your sternum now that was a real cliff hanger.  I really hate that they used  Nyssa al Ghul as a love interest of Sarah, using those characters or changing them to fit Arrow from Batman (Nyssa would really be Talia al Ghul). It really shows no talent on imagination from these directors and produces to just change names. They could have used any other of Green Arrows nemesis' for these plots but to scavenge from Batman.",1418515200,2,1455,4.401486988847584

6347035,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I love Seasons 2 & 3. It looks like Lauel will become The Black Canary. This is a good idea since her deceased sister, Sara, was the Canary. Things are starting to fall into place. The big question is Who Killed Sara Lance? Whe know at least one person who didn't. That is Nyssa. She had many chances to kill Sara. But she loves her too much. When Sara tried to kill herself with the snake venom in Hair To The Demon in Season 2, Nyssa nearly lost it. Nyssa is devoted to Sara. She even released her fom her obligations with The League Of Assassins. That is how much she loves her. So there is no way Nyssa killed Sara. However Nyssa's father could had done the deed. Ras' is a powerful Leader who should not be crossed. Sara returned to The League of Assassins of her free will. Why? Maybe she wanted to stay close to Nyssa. Now that Sara is dead, her sister Lauel can finally become The Black Canary.",1416614400,2,902,4.219653179190751

6347040,5,B00J9C0DRU,"Here is a show so packed with action and plot twists that it always surprises and entertains. I never, ever, read the DC comic it is based on and doubt that I would have liked it. Not important as the show rises above the stodgy pages of a secondary comic series and shines. Does it stretch credibility at times? Of course. So does Batman. The spin-off Flash is good too, I think of it as an American telenovella which type of soap opera was made popular in Mexico. I hate soap operas because they drag on and on and nothing ever happens. But the Telenovella had a beginning and an end. It went somewhere. We here in the US have mastered the form now and it is wonderful. Love the show.",1416441600,4,686,4.244274809160306

6347053,3,B00J9C0DRU,Season 1 is the place to start. It won't make as much sense otherwise. Arrow is a lot like Batman but by far a lot more damaged. He spent five years on a deserted island (which is in every advertisement I've ever seen) and came back different. He's trying to be himself but has no idea who that is. He's trying to honor a promise to his father. All the while unable to forgive himself and running from demons he can't possibly escape. Each season Arrow reassesses himself and tries to make corrections based on his mistakes.,1416268800,,524,4.412371134020619

6347120,3,B00J9C0DRU,"It would have been great, but Hollywood has to screw it up with the politically-correct anti-gun BS.  Ironic isn't it that these people press graphic violence on you; but only their form of violence is OK.",1413936000,,205,4.694444444444445

6347122,5,B00J9C0DRU,"Honestly wasn't looking forward to this season as much as last but the opening ep, ""The Calm,"" quickly reminded me of why Arrow is one of the best shows currently on the telly. So much happens in the season premiere that it is almost hard to keep up. Action, romance (hint hint), tragedy, a smidge of comedy, new enemies, and the strengthening of old friendships. Season 3 is a wild ride in Starling City, and now we are flashing back to Hong Kong rather than still being stuck on the island (which was starting to grow stale). 

This show doesn't greatly depend on special effects (although the flying arrows are digital enhancements, for safety and practicality reasons); instead, Arrow relies on good stunt performers and core actors learning some martial arts methodology to make it all seem real. Not to mention, the cast remains strong. One of the best! ",1413936000,39,860,4.758389261744966
6347123,5,B00J9C0DRU,So far so good though personally I think the writers could do a better job on the story but its still good to watch with friends.  Not quite the family show.,1413849600,,157,4.064516129032258

6347140,5,B00J9C0DRU,"I love Arrow been watching it since the series started. I watch for the action, stunts are amazing, great stunt coordinator. Fan of Olicity, sad to see them struggle with each others situation. I don't mind where they are now. I don't like Laurel in the lair, she acts like she owns the place, ordering Felicity around, getting in Olivers face.  I liked it when it was just Oliver, Diggle and felicity (Team Arrow). Season 3 is shaping up to be a great season!",1413417600,,460,4.476190476190476
6347141,3,B00J9C0DRU,good concept... but it starting to get a bit too soapy...  it's falling into the rut of most long run series where there's a lot of unnecessary plot filler... don't get me wrong...  when they get around to the action it's a great show...  but in between needing an ambulance... they need to call the waaabulance,1413417600,2,311,4.517857142857143

6347147,4,B00J9C0DRU,"The third season of Arrow is off to a really good start, but I'm sorry that Oliver and Felicity's love is so short lived. Maybe in the near future the writers will give the fans a stable growing relationship between the two. I do see this season having a lot of action. I'm sorry to see that Sara was killed off, but I do understand that we will still see her in flashbacks. I am looking forward to the full season 3.
