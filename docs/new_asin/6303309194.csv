624806,4,6303309194,"I have been a bluegrass fan for about one year. I love the music - it just makes me feel good! I was impressed by the great footage on this DVD. The interviews are great and I love the photography. If you know a bluegrass fan, this would make a great gift!",1058400000,7,256,3.9423076923076925
624807,5,6303309194,"This superb documentary explores the origins and developments of traditional bluegrass, from the the early years of the 20th century through the 1970's.  It features a heavy dose of Bill Monroe, with a lot of Jimmy Martin, Mac Wiseman & Ralph Stanley rolled in.  A number of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys alumni are also featured -- String Bean, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs.  I found myself fascinated by the commentary and singing along to most of the performances.  There are a number of clips that standing alone would make this DVD worth the money -- Bill Monroe clogging while picking his mandolin at what looks like a county fair, Ralph Stanley singing ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" (Ralph Stanley singing a capella gospel never fails to give me goosebumps), and hippie ""flower children"" in San Francisco grooving to bluegrass in the early 1970's.  There are also some great clips of other wonderful performers -- A young, unpolished Alison Krauss, a young overly-polished George Jones in his crewcut days, singing ""White Lightning"", a young Porter Waggoner.  In addition, there is commentary by two rail-thin farmers, wearing overalls & fedoras & leaning on hoes in a field, talking about the backdrop against which bluegrass music gained and lost popularity, discussing the struggles of the depression and that crazy hip-swinging Elvis who had people ""throwing their babies at him"" and everything.  This is such a great DVD -- I know that I'll watch this again and again, and share it with several of my friends and family (and I'm half tempted to run out & buy myself a banjo and spend the next few years trying to learn to play like Earl Scruggs.)",1050105600,82,1650,4.913669064748201
624808,5,6303309194,"Liking bluegrass is not necessarily a prerequisite, but if you do then you will thoroughly love this dvd. It's well shot & well paced with b&w background footage, interviews and concert snippets with bluegrass greats from the 1940's through to the 1990's. Watching this DVD i can see where the Coen-brothers ""brother, where art thou"" film must have been inspired, as there are at least a dozen scenes & stills which turn up in their film.
The emphasis musically sticks to monroe's vision of bluegrass and asides from a few songs by the osborne brothers and the seldom scene (brilliant) in a 'rock' setting, it doesn't stray from that straight path so you won't find any fretboard whizzkid-flatpickers like clarence white, tony rice or jazzified bluegrass such as bela fleck but instead some of the purest bluegrass out there!
As for the DVD, there's no fancy menu structure or audio selection just ""start"" and ""scene selection"", but there's really no need for that here, as the audio is great and the movie says it all anyways.
If you like bluegrass, ""brother where art thou"" and/or ""buena vista social club"" then buy this dvd.",1046995200,11,1127,4.844559585492228
624809,5,6303309194,"What an outstanding movie.  If you like bluegrass music this movie will touch you very deeply.  If you like American history but not the music this movie could still be of interest.  Documenting the beginnings of bluegrass music.  How it came about, how it progressed in the early days and interviews of those who pushed the envelope and created the sound of today.
With interviews of everyday folks and artists along with  concert clips of the legends of the music including Bill Monroe, Mac Wiseman, Jimmy Martin, Ralph Stanely and many more mixed with an exceptional soundtrack of music by these legends this movie is an absolute tour-de-force of music documentaries, with soul!
I first saw this movie when I was just beginning the ""experience"" that is bluegrass music and festivals and had been looking for it for a while.  Now that I found it I have been swept away again.  For the new listener this movie is very important in providing history that you did not see, the artists explaining their life and their view on the music.  For the experienced listener, this movie absorbs you with music you love, concert clips from places you remember, and people that you have come to know.
One (and only one) of the many special things about this music is the artists do not consider themselves above you and set themselves off.  They perform for you, the eat with you, the pick with you in the night.  One big loving community.  This movie is a great introduction to this thing that we love!  Buy it, watch it, FEEL IT!",1020384000,12,1519,4.647940074906367
624810,5,6303309194,"This is a wonderful overview of Bluegrass. It gave me - as a beginner - an idea where, why and how Bluegrass originated and why it became so popular.
One of the singers on the tape said something that is very true: Bluegrass is music that is appealing to many but those people cannot really say why they like it. That says everything.
Buy the tape if you want to know more about Bluegrass and if you really appreciate that music. Hands off it if you do not like the music.",1019088000,2,472,4.197802197802198
624811,4,6303309194,"Chock full of great bluegrass music and old footage from the early days of the many artists, I found this disc to be very enjoyable.  If you like bluegrass or are interested in learning more about it this disc is for you - It has the feel of a Ken Burns documentary (He was a consultant) and goes into great detail of the life and times of the father of bluegrass, Bill Monroe.
The First third focuses in on the early days of bluegrass and Bill Monroe's youth.  The middle shows alot of the various lineups of Bill Monroe and his bluegrass boys - and footage of the various ""boys"" when they went solo.  The final third has some real magic in it when the crew visits the many bluegrass festivals.  Here the real magical performances are one of the Osborne Bros. from the late 60's doing Ruby (Incredible - unfortunatly this is not the whole performance) and the amazing group The Seldom Scene doing one of the best renditions of Know You Rider that I have ever heard - these two are worth the price of admission alone.
Being a guitarist/banjo picker I was finding myself playing along and even picking up some new licks and rolls - especially when Flatt & Scruggs are highlighted - whew! - Scruggs was a banjo god.  Very entertaining - a little slow in some parts and a few musicians that should have been mentioned were missing (namely David Grisman, Vassar Clements (he can be seen in one segment w/ Bill Monroe but that's it), Ricky Skaggs, Tony Rice,  and maybe a little more on some of the novelty acts like Bluegrass 45 - this is the only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars - but don't let that stop you - this DVD is GREAT !
This is a barebones DVD and could really have benefitted from a better sound, but I guess since many of the early recording were in mono - it was not an option - but it could have still used and benefitted from a dolby digital track, another track of the complete recordings would have made this pure gold - but I'm not complaining.",991958400,29,1963,4.291891891891892

624813,5,6303309194,"Not only is Bill Monroe a bluegrass deity, he is a national treasure.  The man has passed into the sweet by and by, but his music remains here with us...earthbound and gritty.  Ralph Stanley, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs, and  Mac Wiseman are featured prominently.  Eat your heart out Garth and Shania!  This is real country music.",946252800,9,329,4.803571428571429

624914,4,6303309194,"Great movie for anyone who love bluegrass, and perhaps others.  Not only does the movie present performances of  bluegrass by its major icons, it also relates the story of bluegrass from its origins, much of it narrated personally by some of those same icons.  With visuals alternating between the performances, the narration, and the ""high lonesome"" settings where this all took place.  Very exciting indeed.",1444435200,,409,5.246153846153846

624965,4,6303309194,"I am a bluegrass mandolin player and watch this documentary at least once a year.  Purchased the DVD since my VHS version was worn out.  Not the best documentary ever made, but probably the most important introduction to Bluegrass music for anyone interested.  Moves along pretty good except for some slow (filler) stock footage which needed more explanation.  Good interviews and performances by important pioneers of the genre, many who are no longer with us.  I have recommended this film to many new & old bluegrass musicians and enthusiasts.",1406678400,,546,5.089887640449438

624968,5,6303309194,I know next to nothing about Bluegrass until I heard some music that blew me away and decided I wanted to know more. This documentary is a great starter for someone who doesn't know much about the music. The interviews with the father of Bluegrass were telling since the man exudes a kind of authenticity and quiet understated integrity from another time. I highly recommend.,1402272000,,375,4.7846153846153845

625057,5,6303309194,Pure and 'close to the bone'!  The bluegrass circuit from Gettysburg to Ralph Stanley's old homestead echoed this haunting music.  Most bluegrass performers that I met were 'not above' the people that bought their music.  Some of the real joy at bluegrass festivals was the campfire picking that occurred after the shows.  This is an American art form with roots in Ireland and Scotland that immigrants brought with them.  Truegrass as opposed to newgrass.  Great DVD that brought back lots of memories.,1366588800,,503,5.073170731707317

625059,3,6303309194,"High Lonesome-The Story of Blue grass Music, a DVD, was great in story content, but because we have a ""regular"" DVD player, the sound quality was not very good.

625061,5,6303309194,"You do not have to love (or even like) bluegrass to appreciate this documentary. It takes us through the evolution of banjo playing and country groups -- and how first the roll and then the hammer on/off changed the face of country music. Despite the vibrancy of the music, one of its main pioneers, Earl Scruggs, comes off as shy and understated, which sometimes is exactly what you want in a  legend. And of course there is loads of music, with vintage and more recent clips featuring Bill Monroe, Porter Wagoner, Alison Krauss, and Ralph Stanley.

What also comes across is how important music was to the rural poor. Before television and the Internet (and often electricity and running water), people got together with their instruments and jammed. Parents taught their children, neighbors pulled up chairs, and folk songs got remade as people found new ways to play them. Highly recommended.",1353110400,,896,4.927152317880795
625062,5,6303309194,High Lonesome is an amazing and touching documentary. The lives of these rural people were illustrated through this music that was brought across the oceans and they made it their own. To tell their stories of hardship and loss. This music has lasted in it's purest form and is highly popular even today.,1324944000,,304,4.754716981132075
625063,5,6303309194,"I gave this DVD to my 80 year old bluegrass-loving husband for Christmas.  I was not disappointed in his response to it.  He absolutely loved it.  The narration and the songs touch your heart.  I know we will watch and enjoy it many times.  The only problem was low volume on much of it, but able to compensate by adjusting our volume way up.",1293753600,,342,4.28125
625064,5,6303309194,"My first experience with ""High Lonesome"" was as a radio announcer at WMNA 106.3 in Gretna,VA.  The year was 1995. I also produced a 30 minute Friday night radio feature called ""The Old 97 Show"" which featured recorded and live performances and interviews of Virginia and North Carolina Country music icons of the past and present.  I couldn't help but notice that many of the early Country and Bluegrass music personalities featured in ""High Lonesome"" were coincidently from the central VA/NC area that we were showcasing.  The station had a copy of the soundtrack, which contains even more songs than the documentary.  I grew up with this music.  I've seen all the artists in person and met most of them.  This film is like going home.  I know what the countryside in the film smells and tastes like... wood smoke and apple orchards and hot biscuits!

""High Lonesome"" is the perfect thing to introduce bluegrass music to anyone!",1291766400,,929,4.8354430379746836

625066,5,6303309194,"For a documentary film this example goes beyond my greatest hopes. The director did a fine service to the bluegrass music industry by creating this piece. Nice mix of interviews and sample performances. The commentary from performers is both informative and enlightening,giving a look at what life was like for the earlier artists of this genre. I'm thrilled that this information is available to current generations to explore how the roots of high lonesome bluegrass has influenced many recent styles of music. Picture and sound quality are suprisingly great and the length of the film is just right.",1263859200,2,602,5.153061224489796

625086,4,6303309194,The DVD is an excellent summary of the history of bluegrass music.  The images are of great interest to history buffs and the music is a pleasure to anyone who likes bluegrass.

625089,5,6303309194,"With a family heritage that includes some of the early English and Scotch-Irish settlers in the Blue Ridge Mountains this doc creates a special feeling for me. I feel transported back to an earlier time where I can better understand the lives of my grandparents and those that came before them.

This is partly due to the outstanding archival filmage which traces the history of bluegrass amidst a cultural backdrop of family farms, railroads and coal mines. The most attention is correctly given to the great Bill Monroe. He recites the words to his songs and visits the old family home while also discussing the musical influence of his Uncle Pen and his childhood years in rural Kentucky. Of course, many other outstanding bluegrass performers are also featured, including Ralph Stanley, Jimmy Martin and Mac Wiseman.  The doc also includes some more recent concert footage with contemporary bluegrass artists such as Allison Krauss and Seldom Scene.

Whether you are a newcomer who wants to learn more about bluegrass or a longtime fan seeking to enjoy the music and interviews from some of the all-time greats, this is an excellent film and comes highly recommended.",1204502400,,1171,5.025773195876289
625090,5,6303309194,"The absolute euphoria I felt when I was bitten by the bluegrass bug was tempered with sadness.  As I learned more about the music, I discovered that many of my new heroes -- Bill Monroe, John Duffey, Jimmy Martin, Kenny Baker, and Jim McReynolds, to name a few -- had recently passed on.  Sonny Osborne had retired fron the stage, and Ralph Stanley had quit playing the banjo.  Thank God for ""High Lonesome"", which immortalizes selected performances of these bluegrass titans on film, while providing heartfelt personal reflections, unflinching historical context and exceptionally apt musical examples.  The historical sweep is epic, the music prodigious (There must be between 50 and 75 songs, divided between live performances and background music, here).  There are dozens of little moments that will break your heart -- Jimmy Martin's consummate showmanship, even playing for a camera crew in his den; the rapturous looks on the faces of Sam Bush and David Grisman in the presence of their hero, Bill Monroe; the Osborne Brothers' infectious humor, offset by their sober recollections of the Bluegrass Depression; the Seldom Scene's easy camaraderie and brilliant musicianship.  The only problem with ""High Lonesome"" is that it's far too short to fully explore this greatest of American art forms.  Director Rachel LIebling poured her heart into this project, and had to scramble for funding.  If she'd been a big-name Hollywood director, then ""High Lonesome"" would have been the multi-part mini-series that bluegrass music truly deserves.",1203120000,3,1544,5.299180327868853
625091,5,6303309194,"This is a gem.  For those not aquainted with Bluegrass music, and those reaquainting with the genre.  Some great footage of Bill Monroe around the old homestead, reminiscing.  You get a sense of his experience.  He comments about having many banjo and fiddle players, but only one mandolin player, in his band...with a little twinkle.  Classic Jimmy Martin takes, he's such a buffoon.  Great music.",1193788800,,398,5.046153846153846
625092,5,6303309194,"I'll admit that Jimmy Martin was a very crude, and sometimes obnoxious entertainer. However he left his mark on hundreds of tunes. There is no doubt it's Jimmy when you hear ""Freeborn Man"" or ""Tennesee"".  He put together some of the best in Bluegrass Bands. Many of his band members moved on into prominent positions of their own.

This DVD will give you a glimpse of Jimmy's lifestyle. Beware of the Coon hunting scene, it's not for the faint of heart, or children.

As Jimmy would often say, ""Git It, Git It, Git It!"" This is a must have for those who appreciated ""Jimmy""",1178496000,,573,4.490384615384615
625093,5,6303309194,"You don't have to be a bluegrass fan to love this film, but you might end up one! Bill Monroe's life and music beautifully dominate a penetrating look at bluegrass music and the land that birthed it. Monroe's musicianship is astounding; his voice is like a lonesome wail, a tantalizing, gripping mix of pain and joy. He's an artist of immense stature, and High Lonesome does his legacy justice. This is a rowdy portrait of Appalachia and the hard South, salted with anecdotal contributions from people who live there, their music and stories of the artists who've succeeded in making a very persuasive art known and loved beyond a regional world. I gathered a bundle of heart from this film, and learned to love Monroe's music even more. One of the best moments is watching the grin wrap around Jimmy Dickens' face as he sings '20/20 vision, walkin' around blind...'. The film's chock full of nugget after nugget of pure music, resilient humanity, and an authentic film vision, all of it enriching to the max! High Lonesome delves into the importance of radio in its early days, and finishes with a blazing look at bluegrass festivals (lots of full performances are included!) and a number of current bluegrass performers, the unbeatable Allison Krauss among them. It's a film to watch again and again, one that stays true to its heart, and pulls you in for a memorable, at times haunting experience! Recommended enthusiastically - you won't be disappointed. And the music is stick-with-you SPECTACULAR!",1172707200,3,1503,4.921259842519685

Very enjoyable",1167955200,,80,4.714285714285714

625126,5,6303309194,"The people who said this isn't a good history of bluegrass have a point; as a history, it's idiosyncratic and incomplete. On the other hand, as a portrait of the music and some of its creators it's unforgettable. I must have watched this movie 15 times over the past ten or eleven years, and it can still bring tears to my eyes.",1163116800,2,328,4.306451612903226
625127,4,6303309194,"As some of the others have said (or over-stated), it may not be the best Bluegrass documentary out there....but it is really good, especially for novices.

However, the best part of the DVD is the imagery and film footage.  If you get nothing else, its an amazing visual history lesson of the tmes.",1141171200,5,298,4.60377358490566
625128,2,6303309194,"This is an outdated, very limited documentary on Bluegrass, with a few interviews, most of them looking like they were done in the 1970s. There are huge gaps in this ""story of Bluegrass music"" -- if you know anything at all about the history, you will be shocked at what is left out. It's not even a good introduction, nor a good general overview, to Bluegrass. I saw a MUCH better documentary on CMT's bluegrass week back in January 2002. What a dissappointment this DVD is!",1139875200,10,475,4.534883720930233

625131,5,6303309194,"I bought this DVD for my grandfather for his birthday.  He has listened to this music all his life and for so many years it was hard to find.
He called me immediately after receiving it and viewing it (10pm his time) to tell me how much he appreciated it.  He said it brought back good, old memories of all the people who were in the DVD and of growing up with the music.
He told me that this was the best thing I could have given him for his birthday (aside from a visit from his great-grandkids).
I'd say from his reaction that if you like this music this is definitely a DVD you must see.",1079136000,51,591,4.042735042735043
625132,2,6303309194,"I purchased the DVD based on reviews here.  I love Bluegrass music, but this movie was terrible.  It could have been made as a high scholl project.  Consists mostly of interviews with 3 or 4 musicians, very little complete music.  A good portion of the movie is Bill Monroe walking through an old house looking at nails in the wall, doors falling off the hinges and other such nonsense.  I can't understand why it received such good reviews.",1078358400,14,441,4.602564102564102
625133,5,6303309194,"I bought this DVD as a stocking-stuffer for my husband this Christmas.  It turned out to be the highlight of gifts. Not only is the Bluegrass music original and authenic, the historical account is enlightening. We knew Bluegrass came to this country through Irish immigrants, but we had never noticed the connection to the Beatniks and Flower Children era. The history just fell into place as the DVD took us through the various influences on Bluegrass music.",1072396800,8,459,4.961038961038961
625134,5,6303309194,Breathtaking and the true emotion of Bluegrass music. More than a history. A genuine experience of the roots and people who shared this unique sound with the rest of the humanity. Rachel & Jerome deserve a standing ovation for their work. I have lived it and remember it from the beginning.

7843500,5,6303309194,"This is absolutely a must-see for anyone interested in bluegrass music or the history of American music. I have watched many documentaries about different genres of American music, and I really feel this is among the best if not the very best one. In fact, I would say it is one of the finest documentaries I have ever seen on any subject.  The film is framed around the life of Bill Monroe, but also provides a great deal of interesting history, footage, and images depicting how life and culture in rural Appalachia was changed in the post WWII period by technology, migration, and urbanization. Much of the movie focuses on Monroe, jumping back and forth between his early days, and contemporary footage of his life on the road in the 1980's. It is a great portrait of this unique creative genius. It is also filled with many interviews and wonderful clips of performances by many of bluegrass's notable artists, including Monroe, the Stanley Brothers, Mac Wiseman, Jimmy Martin, Flatt & Scruggs, The Seldom Scene, Allison Krauss, the Osborne Brothers, and many others. Singer Mac Wiseman also does a fine job as narrator.",1518825600,,1125,4.859375
