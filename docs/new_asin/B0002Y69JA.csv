8034546,5,B0002Y69JA,"I bought this to see Bernard Hepton, the ""Colditz"" Kommandant, and his part was great of course
(now if only I could find his Sir Thomas More in the original A Man For All Seasons before Paul Scofield's brilliant rendition, likely an impossible quest),
but the actual story had an unexpected horrible homicide.  The actors (especially Hepton of course) and production were fine, but if I'd known the aforementioned aspect of the story I'd likely not have bought it.",1421107200,,465,4.886075949367089
8034547,2,B0002Y69JA,"I really like Patricia Clarkson; this film was not her fault.
The cinematography was tepid, and I suspect the director was a
wanker. The story crawled & crept,  never really ignited, and there were these
strange moments of suspension that were nearly tableau in nature
that dragged the movement of the vehicle even further down.
I wish I could recommend it but can't.  Wait for a remake - the concept and story are pretty good, I was excited about it.  They do not transcend the productions
shortcomings.  Sorry, Pats.",1274572800,,518,4.786516853932584
