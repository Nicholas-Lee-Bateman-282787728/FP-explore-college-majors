5360174,3,B009OXW8NQ,Quality is fine.  Content very predictable and a bit corny!  But I did enjoy the scenes all over London town!,1384560000,,109,4.4
5360175,5,B009OXW8NQ,I loved this film. The performances are excellent and the story is moving. Tobias Menzies and Genevieve O'Reilly have great chemistry on screen.,1363219200,3,144,5.304347826086956
5360176,4,B009OXW8NQ,"This movie is the whole package; intense, mysterious, thought provoking, sexy & romantic.  You'll want to watch this on over and over.",1353456000,3,134,5.090909090909091
5360177,5,B009OXW8NQ,I watched this movie for the first time because I had nothing better to do. I loved it. It was well written and the Characters fit their roles beautifully. I would love to get the sound track of this movie. Mark Underwood's music is lovely. I felt like this was a truly good love story to bad they do not do more that feel so real and allow you to connect with the actors. Thank you!,1319068800,8,383,4.052631578947368
5360178,5,B009OXW8NQ,This was superbly done.  Casting was on the mark.  The connection between the actors made the movie.  Tender touching scenes.,1316390400,4,125,5.15
5360179,5,B009OXW8NQ,"This romantic and enchanting film caught me completely by surprise!  Tobias Menzies and Genevieve O'Reilly have spot-on chemistry......and Menzies is a revelation!  Love the way the story unfolds, the musical interludes and transitions as they make their way across the city.  I keep reading about comparisons with Before Sunrise.  I've seen Before Sunrise and this is no Before Sunrise.  This film is so much better! Also waiting for the release of the soundtrack.",1314144000,10,465,5.315068493150685
5360180,5,B009OXW8NQ,"This film is wonderfully written and beautifully performed. It is very intimate, and revolves around two characters that meet, spend a night getting to know one another, falling in love, revealing their innermost selves, and maybe even saving each other. All of this action takes place against a stunning London backdrop, with some lovely music included. It's not too heavy, but not too light. It's real, and it's a great film. Do check this one out, just exceptional.",1308528000,7,468,5.012820512820513
5360181,5,B009OXW8NQ,"I saw this film without any expectations than to pass my time. And boy am i glad i saw this film..
It a wonderful moving story with beautiful pictures, great conversations (not like hollywood-love romance - but natural, like the perfect conversation you liked to have withe a total stranger - lover to be!
For all who don't like romances.. its not a typically romance like boy gets girl and happy ever after. Its Before Sunrise but better - because the conversation is much better and deeper. Its just one night of great pictures, great performance (both are great) and great music. For all who like music themed movies (its not all music, just a little - but enough to satisfy you).
I don`t want to poil the end, so im not saying anything concret - except that it fits, and you really do understand every character and their decisions. Also you don`t have a clear ending, its open to your imagination (and not in a bad way- its perfetc).

Also: best movie kiss ever!!!!",1308441600,11,970,4.542857142857143
5360182,3,B009OXW8NQ,"Ok movie... just the 2 people the whole dang movie.  I like Tobias, so I kept watching... entertainment for the airplane.  :-)",1515974400,,126,4.681818181818182
5360183,3,B009OXW8NQ,good,1515715200,,4,4.0
5360184,5,B009OXW8NQ,"Honest, quite real, clean, sincere, peaceful,funny, sad, emotional, keeps you interested, relaxing movie.  I so recommend this movie.  Very grounding and reminds you to appreciate what you have because you never know what tomorrow brings.",1514851200,4,238,5.771428571428571
5360185,4,B009OXW8NQ,I loved the compassion and the realness.  A great movie,1514764800,,55,4.5
5360186,5,B009OXW8NQ,Excellent movie with excellent acting!  Will watch it again!!!,1508544000,,62,5.888888888888889
5360187,4,B009OXW8NQ,"As did most others, I watched it for Tobias Menzies of OUTLANDER fame. He is an exquisite actor and I was curious to watch him as a romantic lead.  While not knowing what to expect, I rather enjoyed it. The two leads were charming together.  Menzies played a musician who is very different from any other characters I have seen him portray. The film had more substance than the average rom-com and I would watch it again.  SPOILER: The vocals are not Menzies' although they sound like they could have been.",1503446400,4,506,4.538461538461538
5360188,5,B009OXW8NQ,"This is a well written, crafted, acted film. This is a film about relationship, discovery, and intimacy. The gentle dignity presented is refreshing and haunting in today's hectic, forcing world.",1501545600,,194,5.5
5360189,5,B009OXW8NQ,"Like many others I became aware of Tobias Menzies through Outlander. There is no Black Jack in this performance, only a showcase of his tremendous talent to convincingly play any type of role. This is a bittersweet story I have watched several times when I need  a lift or reality check on life in today's world of inhumanity. The two actors mesh seamlessly in these roles. As for the ending, I like to think that Eve would stay with Will because of her compassionate nature as evidenced by her plans to become a nurse. Sadly, I'll never know.",1494115200,,543,4.540816326530612
5360190,4,B009OXW8NQ,"Well acted, thoughtful, romantic drama of a real life situation.  I liked  the idea of a phone call initiating a situation with two kind, decent people. A sad, but positive, and uplifting possible life experience. It is a patterns that connect story,that might trigger a personal memory, such as, ""What if?""",1492819200,2,307,5.0
5360191,5,B009OXW8NQ,"This was one that was pretty much figured out after a short period of time, but the evolution of it was too fine to stop watching. And I liked the ending. Even though there was no last Hail Mary. It was worth the watch and the final frames. Good to great at times acting. Bitter sweet, but it felt right. There aren't too many movies like this that have a graceful ending.",1492473600,3,372,4.180555555555555
5360192,4,B009OXW8NQ,Great movie with complex characters and an ending I didn't really expect.,1491609600,,73,5.166666666666667
5360193,5,B009OXW8NQ,awesome,1490659200,,7,7.0
5360194,4,B009OXW8NQ,"no special effects, no blowing things up , none of that stuff hollywood is obsessed with these days. Just a story about two people and their night together. I found it to be enjoyable even if it was bitter sweet.",1486339200,,212,4.325
5360195,2,B009OXW8NQ,Different,1485388800,,9,9.0
5360196,5,B009OXW8NQ,I could watch it all day long. Reminds me of the older style movies. With a real story line. Tobias Menzies is a great actor.,1473206400,,125,4.04
5360197,5,B009OXW8NQ,"sweet, sad, funny, witty, beautifully acted by two co-stars who are so compatible and balanced they feel like they were made to do this film together.  you feel like you know them and are listening in on a delightful and sometimes sad, sometimes revealing conversation on a magical night that is far longer than the hours they spend together.  would liked to have had a more Kubler Ross ending.  a slow nuanced unfolding.  nothing much but everything internal happens.",1472947200,3,468,4.886075949367089
5360198,5,B009OXW8NQ,I Like Tobias Menzies he is a really good actor. He plays his parts so well they actually seem real. Outlander is supurb . I hope he will continue acting for quite some time. I even saw him in Rome. Haven't gotten to the Game of Thrones yet. Best of Luck to him & the Cast of Outlander.,1468713600,2,286,3.9482758620689653
5360199,5,B009OXW8NQ,Well done.,1467244800,2,10,4.5
5360200,5,B009OXW8NQ,I'm a big fan of Tobias Menzies! His acting range is incredible and he is superb in this film. He and Genieve O'Reilly create a believable story that addresses life's real life struggles.,1465689600,6,187,4.696969696969697
5360201,5,B009OXW8NQ,"I picked this movie because of my new crush/hate on Tobias Menzies (the most excellent bad guy on the Outlander series).  The movie turned out to be a nice surprise.  The acting is good.  The screenplay is well-written, realistic and down-to-earth.  It's not the typical boy meets girl, happy ending stuff, but considering the story, it's a touching and satisfying ending.  Also, I'll be downloading the sound track!",1460332800,,416,5.0588235294117645
5360202,5,B009OXW8NQ,"This is one of my favorite movies starring Mr. Menzies. An emotional piece and he is stellar in it. However, it was not filmed in 1996, but in 2010.",1459555200,3,148,4.137931034482759
5360203,3,B009OXW8NQ,Great acting by Tobias Menzies but I didn't believe they were in love by the end of it all.,1455321600,,91,3.8421052631578947
5360204,3,B009OXW8NQ,"Very different. Wanted 2 see Tobias in another role other than frank/jack randall. He was very good.
Different sort of love story.",1445472000,2,130,4.954545454545454
5360205,5,B009OXW8NQ,"I loved this film. Not just because it was romantic, not because it was well-acted (and it was both), but most of all because it dealt with some very uncomfortable realities that people don't usually want to talk about. It discusses things that a lot of us feel but are afraid to really acknowledge because the feelings we have aren't what society says we should have. I won't say more because I don't want to spoil the ending, but I liked that it dealt with these issues in a very touching, tender, and yet honest way. Bravo, indeed.",1424217600,3,534,4.459183673469388
5360206,4,B009OXW8NQ,I already saw that movie myself and it is good so far,1416009600,,53,3.5
5360207,5,B009OXW8NQ,"This is very first movie, We accept and support asl film tried their best work as much they can!.. Slot, Gerland, etc its improvement movies!..",1415836800,,143,4.76
5360208,5,B009OXW8NQ,"While I loved the movie as I have seen online and wanted a disk.  However, when it arrived it was the wrong movie and had to send it back.  I have been afraid to order it again for fear I would not again not get the correct movie.",1413763200,,230,3.7708333333333335
5360209,5,B009OXW8NQ,"An off-the-grid movie with the type of poignancy done best by the Brits. Whenever I watch a film like this, it reminds me how over the top Hollywood is in both content and delivery. Both actors display such subtly, it might be lost on those seeking a ""larger"" experience. Beautiful, normal, and real.

I only wish they'd let Menzies do his own singing - his naughty nuns song was much better than the dreck they dubbed in for him.",1402617600,9,430,4.443037974683544
5360210,1,B009OXW8NQ,This movie cost $15.99.  What the heck!  I thought this price should be around $5.99 to $9.99.  I do not give star but it requires me to rate one star for bad price.,1392336000,2,165,3.9393939393939394
5360211,4,B009OXW8NQ,"Forget Me Not was a movie I had seen already, so ordered it because it's such an unusual story - with two people I'd never seen in movies before. Tobias Menzies is not classically handsome, but is just so pleasant looking. Two people meet and he rescues her from an attacker, so they wander the streets of London all night. So, London with lights on, the huge ferris wheel, the tower, the bridge, the clock - all of it is fascinating as they walk and talk. That's why I wanted to own it.",1386806400,8,487,4.247311827956989
8543435,1,B009OXW8NQ,"This was a VERY strange movie. Kept waiting for it to get better, but never did, and ended very unsatisfactory. I guess I'm a sucker for happy endings...and this one was...strange",1527724800,,179,4.806451612903226
8543436,2,B009OXW8NQ,"Just not my kind of movie...I was bored stiff with this story, but hung in there hoping it would develop. Pretty much could see where it was going...predictable. Most interesting character was the woman's mother. Just too slow, too sentimental; lacked any real story development.",1527638400,,279,5.222222222222222
8543437,5,B009OXW8NQ,This movie started out on the dark side but I kept watching because I liked the music and I wanted to see how the relationship between them unfolded. It was clear early on that she was moved by his music.... I am glad that I hung through the rough beginning. They each had some weighty issues going on and ultimately were able to comfort each other.,1526083200,,349,4.303030303030303
8543438,5,B009OXW8NQ,"Excellent movie, I would recommend this movie because it shows you the turmoil a person goes through when they are faced with a
debilitating disease, whether their own or someone close. It was a very interesting movie. If you get the chance watch it!",1523577600,2,250,4.704545454545454
8543439,2,B009OXW8NQ,"I'll have to preface this by saying that I didn't make it more than 15 minutes in before I shut the movie off, so maybe it gets better later.  If you like dark bars, razor blades, pills, fighting... then this movie might be your thing, but it's not a world I want to escape into.",1521158400,,279,4.072727272727272
8543440,5,B009OXW8NQ,"Well written story. The actors were excellent portraying their parts.  The movie was sad, touching and honest.  I liked the visit with the grandmother and wondered when Will picked up the questions. I am glad I watched it, thank you.",1519948800,,233,4.8
8543441,5,B009OXW8NQ,Tobias is such a delight to watch. Such a master of emotions n you see them all on his face in this sweet tender love story. I knew from beginning of his difficulties. But it's not your standard fare. I loved every minute of it n could watch Tobias 24/7 n never be tired of him. Where's my Will? Hurmph! Now if they only had a US format DVD. I'd buy it in a second.,1519689600,,365,3.88
8543442,5,B009OXW8NQ,Menzies does it again. Brilliantly done. All the feels and then some.,1518566400,,69,4.833333333333333
8543443,5,B009OXW8NQ,very good. love a love story with a beautifully imperfect ending.,1518480000,,65,5.0
