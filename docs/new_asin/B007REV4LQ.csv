5105297,5,B007REV4LQ,"For a film about nothing, Seven Psychopaths is one of the most delightful films of the year. Writer/director Martin McDonagh re-teams with Colin Farrell from the 2008 classic In Bruges and peppers his film with a terrific ensemble cast that includes Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, Woody Harrelson, Tom Waits, Kevin Corrigan, and Harry Dean Stanton. The film's plot is a wonderful slice of metafiction that deliberately blurs the line between what's actually happening and what's just happening in the script the main character is writing. With that in mind, Seven Psychopaths isn't really about anything yet it has one of the most ingenious scripts of the year.

The film opens with two hit men (Michael Pitt and Michael Stuhlbarg) discussing, at length, shooting a woman through the eyes. As they banter back-and-forth a masked man nonchalantly walks up behind them and shoots them both. This is Psychopath No. 1. From here we meet Marty (Farrell), an alcoholic screenwriter working on his latest script entitled `Seven Psychopaths.' The problem is he doesn't yet know who the seven psychopaths are. His friend Billy Bickle (Rockwell), an unemployed actor who, with his partner Hans (Walken), moonlights as a dog thief, attempts to provide him with unwanted assistance. When Billy kidnaps a Shih Tzu from Charlie (Harrelson), a violent gangster, Billy, Marty, and Hans find themselves running for their lives. This is intercut with Marty building his own script, with the help of some outside ideas.

Somehow, even when the film jumps into Marty's own fictional narrative it remains fascinating. One sequence involves a Quaker (Stanton) getting revenge for the death of his daughter and there's an eloquent, macabre sequence narrated by Zachariah Rigby (Waits). The film is consistently entertaining and endlessly fascinating.

This is McDonagh's second film, but as an acclaimed playwright he's well-versed in his craft. Seven Psychopaths is a slight departure from In Bruges tonally, but it has the same dark humor and the same mark of his genius. His screenplay is brilliantly plotted; a hilarious and violent work with memorable dialogue complemented by his eye for casting and his prowess as a director. There seems to be a Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie influence here, yet he puts his unique stamp on the formula and creates a delightfully demented crime film that is destined to become a cult classic.

The performances are showy and I'm not sure any will be considered Oscar-worthy, but they are very fun to watch. Walken hasn't given a performance this inspired in years. His energetic and hilarious performance teeters on the edge of self-parody at times, but it's very self-aware and possibly the funniest acting in the film. Harrelson demonstrates his enviable range here with his ability to move from one extreme to the other; in one moment, he's a frightening psychopath and in another he's hilarious...Sometimes at the same time. Tom Waits brings his own quirkiness to a role that only he would be able to create in such a way. Rockwell meanwhile nearly steals the show from everyone in a perfect Rockwell-type role. Farrell does a fine job, but he seems to allow the other actors to take center stage.

I admit the film is bedazzling to a degree. So much is good about it; it's easy to forget it's not perfect. Towards the latter half of the film it becomes a little too meta for its own good and almost veers off-track, but McDonagh skillfully reels it back in before it loses traction.

Seven Psychopaths isn't a masterpiece, but I predict it will become an often-seen classic among many viewers and will be enjoyed through repeat viewings in the coming years. It doesn't quite touch the brilliance of In Bruges, but it is a cartoonishly fun film that expertly blends ingenious writing, hilarity, and violence. It's one of the most original films of the year by far and certainly one of 2012's best.",1356652800,6,3921,5.033898305084746
5105298,4,B007REV4LQ,"If Roddy Doyle, Quentin Tarantino and the Coen brothers got drunk together one night, they'd almost certainly come up with a script like those of Martin McDonagh and his brother, John Michael. Martin McDonagh, already a successful playwright, directed two gleefully bloody black comedies, the Oscar-winning short ""Six Shooter"" and the full-length ""In Bruges."" Not to be outdone, John Michael McDonagh came up with his own nihilistic comic romp, ""The Guard.""

""Seven Psychopaths,"" Martin's latest movie, is the first McDonagh flick not to feature Brendan Gleeson. But although Gleeson is missed, the ensemble cast makes up for his absence. Foremost among them is Sam Rockwell as Billy Bickle, an aspiring actor who pays the bills by running a dognapping racket with his friend Hans (Christopher Walken). Rockwell, whose character can best be described as a hyperactive child on crack, brims over with ideas for the latest screenplay by his seriously blocked, seriously alcoholic best pal Martin (Colin Farrell, who also starred in ""In Bruges""). Soon, however, major trouble heads the way of Billy, Martin, and Hans, after Billy's latest dognap victim turns out to be the beloved pet of crazed mobster Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson).

Like its predecessors, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is wildly funny, consistently inventive, and over-the-top violent. I will preserve its plot twists for you to discover for yourself. For me it didn't have as much bloody meat on its bones as ""In Bruges"" or ""The Guard,"" but it does raise some interesting connections between movie violence and real-life violence. (Remember how Silvio on ""The Sopranos"" loved to do his ""Godfather"" impressions? ""Seven Psychopaths"" makes the same point, but much, much more strongly.) Rockwell steals the picture, but Walken, Harrelson and Tom Waits all offer amusing variations on criminal sociopathy, and Farrell is a likably befuddled straight man. With funny cameos by Harry Dean Stanton, Gabourey Sidibe, Michael Pitt, Michael Stuhlbarg and others, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is wild fun.",1351382400,,2047,5.413793103448276
5105299,4,B007REV4LQ,"This is director (and writer) Martin McDonagh's third film and first since the very good ""In Bruges"" from 2008.  A pair of small time con men (Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken) specializes in stealing dogs, then returning them for the reward.  Billy's (Rockwell) best friend Marty (Colin Farrell) is a wannabe screenwriter who only has the title for his movie (Seven Psychopaths) and a broad idea for a story.  Marty's biggest problem seems to be that he's drunk all the time.

Billy offers to help him with the story but Marty is intent on doing it himself.  Figuring he can give Marty some ideas, Billy runs an ad in a local trade paper, looking for reformed psychos to come in for an interview.  Yeah, the film is full of craziness.  This allows the always entertaining Tom Waits to show up as Zachariah, one of the seven psychos.

The films dognapping element becomes critical as Billy and Hans (Walken) kidnap a shih-tzu belonging to, yep, psycho crime lord Charlie (Woody Harrelson).  There is nobody better than Walken when it comes to playing offbeat characters and he doesn't disappoint.  While everybody makes contributions, this is Rockwell's movie.  His character is interesting, funny and provocative.  So is the movie.  It is a bit complicated, so you have to pay attention.  It is also extremely violent and the violence is pretty much just laughed away.  Such is this wonderful dark comedy.  It's absurd, messy, witty, smart and wildly entertaining.  One of the best of the year.",1350864000,11,1498,4.880952380952381
5105300,5,B007REV4LQ,"Back a few years ago, a writer/director by the name of Martin McDonagh emerged very heavily on the cinematic stage with the extremely black comedy IN BRUGES. It was hilariously funny, shockingly violent, utterly absurd at points as well as surprisingly human and touching. It also gave Colin Farrell possibly his best role ever. And with such an excellent film between them, what could they possibly do that could live up to the expectations set by that film?

They could reteam and make SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, and it really does live up to the expectations.

SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS primarily follows Martin (Farrell), a screenwriter in Hollywood trying desperately to write his newest script which he calls ""Seven Psychopaths"". His best friend is Billy (Sam Rockwell), a struggling actor who runs a dog-kidnapping... excuse me, dog-borrowing business on the side with his partner Hans (Christopher Walken) in which they find wealthy dog-owners, take the dogs, and return them for the reward money. Unfortunately for all involved, they end up taking the wrong person's dog, and that person is Mr. Costello (Woody Harrelson), a crime boss who loves his little Shih Tzu above all other things. A brutal and deadly pursuit begins for Costello as he tries to retrieve his dog, while Martin becomes embroiled in this mad scheme. All the while, Martin is coming up with ideas for more psychopaths to use in his film, and also meeting them via an ad that Billy put in the paper specifically for psychopaths to tell their story to Martin, and one of those is the bunny-petting Zachariah (Tom Waits), who has quite the tale to tell. Lines between life and art start to gradually blur as the inevitable confrontation between the dog-nappers and the dog-napped comes ever closer.

Like IN BRUGES, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS treads the very thin line between tragedy and comedy with some absolutely devastating moments, but then somehow finds a way to make itself the funniest film I've seen this year with some absolutely masterful performances that will likely be forgotten when Awards Season kicks off. Sam Rockwell continues his streak of scene-stealing performances as Billy, who is rightly considered one of the seven psychopaths of the title. Colin Farrell is forced to play straight man to the likes of Rockwell and Walken and does a nicely nuanced job of it. Harrelson is menacing and violently unpredictable enough to be a good villain, but also his obsessive love of his dog makes his bad guy increasingly absurd and funny. Waits does a really nice job with what must be a fun role to play and a really interesting character to watch. Also appearing in the film are Abbie Cornish as Martin's on-off girlfriend, Linda Bright Clay as Hans' wife and Olga Kurlyenko as Billy's secret girlfriend. This is really the only problem that I had with the film is that the female characters are largely ignored or marginalized, but there may be method to McDonagh's madness as there is a conversation in the film about Martin's screenplay lacking anything beyond one-dimensional female characters (which likely speaks to the metatext of the entire film). But when all is said and truly done, it's Walken who walks away with this picture. It's a performance of wit, sensitivity, genuine humanity, some menace and if nothing else, the ""put your hands up"" scene is something that will be in the annals of film comedy history.

There are so many moments of high humor in this film, it's hard to enumerate them, but what's perhaps most important about this film is the discussion about the film as the film is going on between its characters. Billy sees this whole story AS a film, and Martin looks to include stories from the film in his film. The film becomes a semi-satire of itself as it goes on, much like Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon's THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. As that film provided a metatextual satire of horror film conventions, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS offers up satire of the post-Tarantino crime genre, with philosophical hitmen, final shootouts, Mexican standoffs, etcetera. McDonagh makes all of the film's drama, comedy and action work with a wink in its eye and gallows humor in its heart.

It's also important to know that if you liked IN BRUGES, then in all likelihood, you will really enjoy this film. But if you didn't care for IN BRUGES, you probably won't like this film. SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, like IN BRUGES, does have some pretty massive tonal shifts from hilarious comedy to gut-wrenching tragedy and that can be hard to swallow for some audiences. It may not seem like it, but that is important to take into account.

SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is one of those rare great films that succeeds on all the levels it reaches for, but is strange enough to leave you wondering long after the credits roll... and believe me, STAY FOR THE CREDITS. It's the perfect coda to a film like this.

4.5/5 Stars.",1350777600,27,4866,4.869565217391305
5105301,5,B007REV4LQ,"Had the wonderful opportunity to get this screened a couple of months ago in Los Angeles. I didn't know what to expect except from the synopsis. All I knew it that it had a great cast: Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, Christopher Walken etc. That was enough for me to RVSP for the movie. Then I learned it was from upcoming director Martin McDonagh whose gotten critically acclaim for his work. Then I knew I was in for quite an evening.

I gotta say it delivered the goods. Dark comedies are definitely a great genre especially if handled well. McDonagh utilizes his talent very well. I and the screening audience definitely laughed at every turn.

All the performances were very good. I am not a big Colin Farrel fan, but he was perfect as ""Marty""-the screenwriter who doesn't know what he's gotten himself into when he puts an ad to interview psychopaths for his screenplay ""Seven Psychopaths"" at the request of his friend Billy (Sam Rockwell). Sam Rockwell was great as Billy. Woody Harrelson as the mafia boss. Christopher Walken was great as Hans.

One thing that always sticks out for me when I enjoy a movie is noticing how well the cast enjoys themselves in playing their roles. Every actor in the movie you can tell has a lot of fun with the roles they have especially Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell who really dominate their screen time.

If you're in the mood for something totally different, and want to laugh and laugh hard then this is the movie for you.",1350777600,4,1484,4.6311787072243344
5105302,5,B007REV4LQ,"The Irish playwright and scenarist Martin McDonagh is hands-down the world's best creator of black comedy today.  He brings the insanity of the contemporary world -- and of Hollywood -- to nis newest film, Seven Psychopaths, which he wrote and directed.  Viewers familiar with his theatrical works like The Lieutenant of Inishmore and The Cripple of Inishmaan or Pillowman will love this new film.  McDonagh has a lightness of touch that combined with his acute perceptiveness of the absurd create tears of laughter throughout this zany motion picture.  You won't want to miss it.",1350604800,3,580,5.138297872340425
5105303,4,B007REV4LQ,"Some 3-4 years ago, director Martin McDonagh teamed up with Colin Farrell in an absurd but very funny crime comedy called ""In Bruges"". I loved that movie (and not just because it was filmed in the Belgian city of Bruges, where I spent my high school years). Now comes another crime comedy from the same team.

""Seven Psychopaths"" (2012 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Marty (played by Farrell), a struggling writer who is working on a movie script called ""Seven Psychopaths"". His buddy Billy (played by Sam Rockwell) is volunteering to help in any way possible. At some point Billy steals a little dog, and only later do we learn that the dog's owner is Charlie (played by Woody Harrelson), a dangerous gangster who is out for revenge. Last, but certainly not least, there is Hans (played by Christopher Walken), a buddy of Billy's. There are a bunch of smaller characters in the movie. To be honest, I had a hard time keeping track of the multitude of characters, and the fact that part of the movie is a recreation of the script that Marty is writing. A script within the script, so to speak. After a while I simply let go of it all, and just watched the movie for what it is, regardless of the actual or percieved plot lines: another absurd (and I do mean that as a compliment) crime drama.

Couple of side comments: with apologies to Colin Farrell, but in my opinion Sam Rockwell steals the movie. His acting is sharp and he brings his character in a way that made me smile if not laugh out loud, just by seeing him. I also was surprised to see that this movie is not just playing at the art house here in Cincinnati (where I saw it), but also at a number of mainstream mulitplexes. The movie was not very well attended when I saw it this past weekend, and I can't imnagine that a dark and violent movie like this one, even with plenty of humor and comedy, will be a big hit, but I could be wrong of course. Bottom line is this: if you liked ""In Bruges"", which in style and approach is very similar to this one, you will love ""Seven Psychopaths"". If you found that ""In Bruges"" was not your cup of tea, save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this.",1350172800,50,2166,4.3722084367245655
5105304,4,B007REV4LQ,"Martin McDonagh, among the best known Irish directors previously won an Oscar for the short movie Six shooter&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Collection-of-2005-Academy-Award-Nominated-Short-Films/dp/B000FSMEDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Collection of 2005 Academy Award Nominated Short Films</a>&nbsp;although he is perhaps best known for the acclaimed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Bruges/dp/B0018BD9DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Bruges</a>also starring Colin Farrell, a dark comedy with tragic overtones about two hitmen on the run.

I first heard of this movie last year when I saw the movie The Guard directed by his brother Michael John. A trademark of the McDonaghs is dark humor mixed with some irony and perhaps even some philosophy together with some absurdity. As I loved The Guard so much and it has the biggest domestic box office of any Irish movie ever made, I looked forward to this latest movie with more than a little anticipation.

If you're like me and like American directors who also write such as Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill, or the Coen Brothers with No Country for Old Men, I think you will also like this.

Seven Psychopaths centers around an Irish screenwriter nemed Martin played by Colin Farrell planning to write a movie about seven psychopaths. Life begins to imitate art as a similar tableau to the one he writes about starts to unfold in real life.

Woody Harrelson plays Sam a local organised crime leader whose dog is kidnapped by Walken and Sam Rockwell's character who happen to be friends of Martin. Sam cares more about dogs than people. The real mixes with the imaginary in very intriguing ways, and kept the movie audience entertained. I particularly liked the scenes with the Vietnamese priest and the hooker, and the Quaker story. There is also a hit man with a white rabbit played by Tom Waits.

The revelatory performance in this movie comes from Sam Rockwell when he helps out Martin with the screenplay lending some psychotic absurdity to the scenes although everyone is excellent.

What I like is that McDonagh while clearly inspired by Tarantino and Coen imposes his unique style and does not kowtow to Hollywood conventions and delivers a movie that experiments with different styles of humor and yet manages to engross you so much in the moment that you do not attempt to guess the end. If you do you would probably guess wrong.

I love how he works the opening scene with two hitmen discussing preparing for a hit and how the scene turns out.

While I would not consider this better than say In Bruges there is a certain heaviness in the theme of In Bruges that is not present here and some people may prefer the more light hearted nature of this movie which is a highly welcome and worthy addition to the McDonagh repertoire.

I hope the McDonagh brothers will work together as I think they could give the Coen brothers a run for their money.

I think you will love it and I hope this was helpful.",1350086400,132,3064,5.23469387755102
5105305,4,B007REV4LQ,"I've been waiting for the release of Seven Psychopaths ever since I learned that Martin McDonagh was writing and directing. If you have seen In Bruges, you'll know that McDonagh has a dark sense of humor, not too far removed from something Quentin Tarantino might be involved with.

Does Seven Psychopaths match the brilliance of In Bruges? Not quite, but it's still an entertaining movie.

Marty (Farrell) is a struggling screenwriter, who has decided on little more than the title, Seven Psychopaths. The problem is, he wants his psychopaths to be Buddhist, and he can't see how they would go around killing people. He decides to make one Amish instead, for no particular reason. Marty doesn't have a clue about writing.

His friends, Billy (Rockwell) and Hans (Walken), make money by dognapping and returning the animals to their owners in order to claim the reward money. This backfires when they inadvertently take a dog belonging to Charlie (Harrelson), who is some kind of crime lord. You only have to read the tag on the collar of his beloved Shih Tzu to understand Charlie's outlook on life.

Seven Psychopaths is a comedy. It's also extremely violent at times, and has more than its fair share of foul language (including the word that almost every woman detests), with brief nudity and occasional racist remarks. But it's obvious that everything is tongue-in-cheek. It's almost impossible to mistake the movie for a serious drama; it's a fun ride, and the R-rated material does not seem offensive or out of place.

I've already mentioned Tarantino, and for good reason. The genre and setting are almost irrelevant; this is an exercise in style, and you'll either love it or hate it. Dialogue is everything in this type of movie and most of the writing is inventive, witty and intelligent. The opening scene is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, with two hit men talking nonsense. The scene ends in an unexpected way, and I won't reveal it here, but it sets the tone for the whole movie.

McDonagh is aware of the course that Hollywood action movies are supposed to follow, and Seven Psychopaths challenges those expectations. One character suggests that they pitch a tent in the middle of the desert so they can just sit there and talk, rather than having a traditional shootout with the bad guys. In response, his friend asks whether this is a French movie. It's that kind of humor. Another interchange observes that women have a rough deal in this story; when they aren't being verbally abused, they are in danger of being removed permanently.

I won't say any more about the plot because it's enjoyable seeing things gradually unfold on the screen, except to say that my favorite scene featured Hans making a suggestion about how to end the movie. Walken's comic timing is excellent as always, and his scenes are funnier when you think about some of the characters he has played in the past.

The movie features good performances from Rockwell, Walken, Harrelson and Farrell in particular, although nobody else delivers a weak performance. The audience in my theater laughed often, and occasionally groaned at the unexpected violent scenes. If you go in expecting a dark comedy along the lines of In Bruges, Fargo, or The Guard, you'll likely enjoy the experience. The pacing feels just right.

One thing I should add is that it's best to sit through the credits, or you will miss the final scene.

I'm looking forward to the Blu-ray and the next McDonagh movie. It would be fun to see Brendan Gleeson involved too.",1350000000,3,3523,4.8566666666666665
5105306,5,B007REV4LQ,"Being a big fan of ""In Bruges,"" getting excited for writer, director, and now producer Martin McDonagh's latest film ""Seven Psychopaths"" was like second nature. ""In Bruges"" is begging for a revisit, but it added a lot of humor to hitmen and crime situations that usually try to be gritty or as serious as humanly possible in films before it. ""In Bruges"" had this uniqueness to it and ""Seven Psychopaths"" is even more creative and hilarious in comparison.

A struggling screenwriter named Marty (Colin Farrell) has an idea for his next screenplay; a movie entitled ""Seven Psychopaths."" The problem is Marty is having difficulty coming up with the actual story or the psychopaths for that matter and his alcoholism often gets the better of him. His strange best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell), who kidnaps dogs with a religious man named Hans (Christopher Walken) and returns them to get the reward, has extreme interest in helping Marty write his story. What Marty doesn't count on is Billy putting an ad in the newspaper that opens the door for all sorts of crazy individuals to contact him and know where he lives. Marty's thrown into a world he's never dreamt of because of it.

If you've seen the poster for this, it portrays Olga Kurylenko and Abbie Cornish as two of the seven psychopaths. Ignore this. They maybe have eight minutes of screen time between the two of them and other than being the girlfriends of a few of the main characters are mostly completely irrelevant to everything else going on. The opening of the film is extraordinary; mostly because the appearance of ""Boardwalk Empire"" alumni Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt was completely unexpected. Their ""shot through the eyeball"" conversation immediately sets the messy and eccentric tone of the film.

The original aspect of ""Seven Psychopaths"" resides in its writing. Marty is writing a movie called ""Seven Psychopaths"" during a film you're watching with the same name. The entire sequence where Marty, Billy, and Hans go out into the middle of nowhere to write the movie is incredible. Not only is it massively entertaining, but it gives you a number of different scenarios of how the film could play out and how Marty will decide to end his version of the movie. It's as if it shatters the fourth wall and then just keeps running for several miles.

There's also this hilarious sense of logic throughout the entire comedy. Sam Rockwell is the funniest he's ever been. He acts a bit off, but everything that comes out of his mouth is just hysterical. His version of how Marty's movie should end is his shining moment, but he steals the show whenever he's on screen or opens his mouth. Nearly every conversation is just absurd though, but it's so absurd that it makes way too much sense. The phrase, ""That's just crazy enough to work!"" was meant for this film.

The rest of the cast isn't wasted either. It's interesting that Mickey Rourke was originally supposed to portray Charlie since Woody Harrelson fits the role so well. His obsession with his dog makes the Charlie character completely unpredictable. Christopher Walken is really superb. He makes Hans seem so much more interesting than he really is and his rambling is often the voice of reason or so dry that it's laugh out loud funny. Tom Waits as Zachariah is captivating because of his backstory and fascination with bunnies. His motives along with his after credit sequence are just written so unusually that it's amusing.

There really isn't anything else out there like ""Seven Psychopaths."" If that Marvel movie about ""Deadpool"" ever gets off the ground, you can imagine it to be a lot like this; people getting killed left and right, blood everywhere, ridiculously hilarious conversations in between and during, and the entire experience leaving a smile on your face. There's also quite a bit buried beneath the laughs and the killing; the question of whether the afterlife is real and peace being more important than war. This comedy has a very sentimental center that catches you a bit off-guard, especially when it comes to the emotional ending. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is an automatic contender for the funniest and most original comedy of the year.",1350000000,62,4189,4.892957746478873

At first, I couldn't quite figure out where the story was going, but I stayed with it, and it grew crazier and funnier (and funnier still) over time, with constant twists and turns, as the disparate elements of the storyline came together.  It has a stellar cast who play the bizarre, off-beat characters -- roles that many of these actors are extremely skilled at and are well known for.  Like most black comedies, it has a good deal of violence and strong language, so it might not be everyone's cup of tea.  But, I loved it!",1520208000,,689,4.524193548387097

McDonagh's writing is intelligent and witty, his characters and stories engaging, despite the dark emotions and violence.

5105354,5,B007REV4LQ,"I can't help but wonder what people who rated this 1-star were expecting...  I guess a majority of Amazon customers do not have a grasp on what dark humor is, or just don't understand it?  Likely the same people who gave Ace Ventura 5-stars, but gave Cable Guy 1-star.

You also have to take Amazon reviews with a grain of salt, when you consider that Independence Day (worst movie ever made IMO) and Over the Top (a step up from 'stop or my mom will shoot') have 4.5 stars on Amazon... so there's that.

As for the movie...  people had a hard time following the script?  The characters are basically writing the movie throughout the movie, the 1-star people couldn't follow that?

Overall, worth a watch, and something to throw on if there's nothing else on.  Best movie ever?  No.  While I do like In Bruges a bit better, there are definitely much worse movies to watch on here as part of Amazon's ""thousands of titles included with prime!!!""

Sam Rockwell is great in this... well, Sam Rockwell is great in everything, but his monologue of the ""shootout"" at the end is probably my favorite scene in the movie.  There's even one quick part where you can see Walken trying not to laugh.

Farrell is... Farrell.  I like him in this, and In Bruges.  Outside of that, it's the movies he picks that I don't like (Phone Booth is awful), not his acting.

Woody Harrelson is pretty funny in this as well, but I kinda wish they would've cast someone a bit more menacing as a mafia gangster type, unless that was on purpose?  Having Ralph Fiennes play the gangster role after his role as Harry in In Bruges would've been perfect.",1515456000,,1621,4.4965753424657535

Seven Psychopaths attempts and succeeds at both parodying and homaging action films and the creative writing process. The main character is named for the writer and director of this film, showing the struggle for originality when it comes to action movies. With its dark comedy, complexly driven characters, and great acting, it delivers on all it sets out to. The crazy bloodbath action scenes aren't meant to copy Tarantino or to pander to young boys who love guns in film, but to make fun of the tropes of Hollywood. It homages Tarantino with its opening, because those are good and original action films, but then satirizes the lack of originality with the ideas pitched for the final climatic battle.

5105437,3,B007REV4LQ,"So, I liked the cast.  I also laughed out loud at some scenes.  But the story has a meandering plot and different story lines that never weave together but travel near and far from each other.  It opens with a wonderful and whimsical murder scene but devolves into the interaction of the principle characters that, again, never really mesh well.

I was impressed.  It is a bit of a mind bender with the connections that are reveled from time to time and the on the edge scenes that occur after finding out something about a character.  The characters are not cliche in any way.  So, enjoy.",1494201600,,409,4.05

Believe it or not when I hear dialog like this it really relates to the way most normal people talk or would talk if they weren't scared to death that someone might hear them and get their feelings hurt. To me the story line was fresh and interesting and as some others noted it did turn on itself and the characters did wrestle with each of their own points of view and beliefs.

 Really, would you even know if you sat down in a cafe with one of these people, we are all just a simple decision away from being the good guy or the bad guy. Just watch it and enjoy it for what it is Entertainment.",1493683200,,749,4.054054054054054

7 Psychopaths is witty, satirical, thought-provoking and just flat out good. It's a movie about nut jobs, on the surface. But as Christopher Walkins says, it's got layers. Those layers are so well written, so train wreck mesmerizing, that you can be assured you will miss some meaning, some reference if you only watch it once.
And the acting? Brilliant. The plot? Sadistically twisty. Convoluted. It's very, very cool.",1491004800,3,498,4.870588235294117

5105465,4,B007REV4LQ,"3.5 Stars. I liked it. My wife not so much. It's basically your ""budding writer-director cutting his teeth with his UCLA film school hitman/crime/Tarantino-esque first script"" movie. Acting is fantastic. I'm a fan of everyone in this movie, especially Sam Rockwell.

Plot centers around a screenwriter/alcoholic (Colin Farrell) trying to write a script called 7 Psychopaths. His best friend, played by Rockwell, kidnaps dogs for a living, which leads everyone down the sewer hole when the wrong dog gets nicked from the wrong crime boss (Woody Harelson). Think Elmore Leonard and Get Shorty meet True Memoirs of an International Assassin with Kevin James. It's not a perfect analogy but the vehicle of the characters writing the movie you're actually watching fits, so does the reference to Elmore Leonard-type underworld characters.

Plenty of blood splatter and dark humor to go around. I didn't love it but I was glued to my TV.

Pretty good characters, fine acting, and a compelling pace keep this film moving in the right direction. There's a subtle nod and wink to the True Romance genre, as if, thankfully, the filmmakers and cast did not take it too seriously.",1486857600,9,1168,5.072916666666667

5105544,2,B007REV4LQ,"It's kind of interesting, but not much tying it together other than a vague plot.  Problems with it are that, with one exception, there are no psychopaths in the film.  I think the screen writer had no real idea of what a psychopath is and could have benefited from some research.  Also, the music sequences are horrible.  Whoever the sound editor was must have lost quite a bit of hearing, because whenever a soundtrack was played I had to grab the remote and drop the volume down quite a bit.  I think professionals know how to match volumes and bring in music gently.  This marks it as an amateurish production despite a couple of good stars.  It was okay for killing some time, but not the kind of movie that is worth watching again.",1483920000,,737,4.455223880597015

Mostly.  Give up your deep seated/seeded/ceded need to find real life characters to sort of represent what you'll find in this movie and you'll have a good time.  There's a fair amount of blood, but limited in duration.  Some very strange anti-heroes (all seven psychopaths) and one near realistic character at the periphery, collecting material for a movie.  Not as much fun as Get Shorty, and more of the writers-writing-writers issues, but different.  One I recommend seeing.",1474502400,11,737,5.151260504201681

5105785,2,B007REV4LQ,"Movie tries to be Quentin Tarantino-esque in terms of pacing and shock value but falls flat. Pace is TOO SLOOOOW and the actors are severely miscast. Having the comic relief guy from Galaxy Quest (Sam Rockwell...and, yeah, I had to look it up) as the main character doesn't work...the guy isn't main character material...casting the brilliant Christopher Walken as a mumbling, half-comatose character is a waste of his talent...casting Walken in the lead and Rockwell as the mumbler may have been an improvement.

5105793,4,B007REV4LQ,"Christopher Walken steals dogs and the movie. Colin Farrell and the other actors all provide great performances but it's hard to compete with the delivery and gravitas that Walken brings to his role. The writing for this film was excellent and non-standard for the genre with enough twists and turns to give M Night Shyamalan creative whiplash.

Seven Psychopaths is about some guy trying to write a script for a movie and his wacky friends trying to help him write his movie.  Wackiness and tragedy ensues.  All the female characters in the movie, Seven Psychopaths, have less than ten minutes screen time and die.  In one scene, one of the movie script writer's friend tells the writer, ""Your script is terrible, all the female characters have less than ten minutes screen time and die!""  The writer's freinds talk about their ideas for a movie, so we have movies within a movie.  They talk about things they done so we have flashbacks.  The Movies within the movie and flashbacks make Seven Psychopaths unique.  In one flashback scene, the Zodiac Killer is depicted as an old hippie.  We all know Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer.",1468627200,,921,4.62962962962963

5105935,4,B007REV4LQ,"Seven Psychopaths is a clever and fun black comedy and a twisted take on the mind of the writer enduring writer's block. Very dark and violent but as with Tarantino, the violence is so over the top it becomes a comedic device. If you laughed about Marvin's head getting blown off in Pulp Fiction, let's just say that Seven Psychopaths has an even funnier head blowing off scene. That sounds horrible but hey, it's true.

Colin Farrell somehow manages to be lovable, Sam Rockwell (The Green Mile, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) continues his brilliant streak playing charismatic psychos, Woody Harrelson is as menacing as ever and Christopher Walken gives a wonderfully subdued performance full of heart.

Not great but it's pretty close. Highly entertaining.",1467763200,,760,5.072

5105974,4,B007REV4LQ,"Seven Psychopaths is a particularly difficult film to enjoy, I feel. This is mostly due to the confusing ad campaign which made it seem like a wacky comedy, when it is so much more. Even then, this film may not be to everyone's liking, mostly because of the disjointed nature the plot and some of the more bizarre aspects. Even still, fans of film as a medium will enjoy it. The meta narrative woven throughout the plot, linking the protagonist's unfinished script and the plot of the film in such a way as to explore the genre of crime drama/action films and showing just how messed up the minds of characters in those films would actually have to be in order for the plot to actually happen. Yet it also pokes fun at the art house crowd as well, with Colin Farrell's pacifistic Marty's desire to write a life affirming film about psychopaths coming to a head with Sam Rockwell's more unhinged Billy and his more mainstream desire to make it an action film with gratuitous gore and sex so the film isn't boring. Peppered throughout, are some great moments both comedic and dramatic, with the always wonderful Christopher Walken stealing every scene he's in.

As a comedy, the film is rather short on laughs, but for fans of director Martin McDonagh's previous film ""In Bruges"" they will feel right at home with the subtle humor mixed in with surprisingly serious drama. Regardless, Seven Psychopaths proves to be a fun, mad, ride that is beautifully shot and edited and definitely worth a watch.",1466812800,10,1496,4.688212927756654

The story could really have been interesting if they hadn't tried so hard to be a mashup of the Cohen brothers and Quentin Tarantino.  The first half of the move isn't too bad... looks like an interesting plot is starting to take place.  It didn't help that Sam Rockwell overacted, but the whole thing falls apart to me in a gratuitous murder and violence rampage that doesn't add a thing to the movie.  A potentially good plot wasted..

In addition, there are also deeper issues examined such as religion, philosophies of life, psychology, and the role violence plays in society. It had potential to be great but the gratuitous violence was too much for me.  I loved tom waits' character and sam Rockwell portrayed his psychopathic character very well.

5106379,5,B007REV4LQ,"I've seen it a few times, and familiarity does not breed contempt for this little film. If you despised 'In Bruges,' and its foul-mouthed mix of grit, absurdity, and tough-guy violence, you'll hate this, too. But, as a woman who loves tense action films, character-driven stories, originality, wit, and Christopher Walken, I love this!

Yes, the central character is an alcoholic writer whose problems are largely self-inflicted. Yes, he has a jackass best friend whose legal name ought to be Liability. Yes, where the aforementioned friend is concerned, the protagonist inhabits a moral vacuum. But, so much about Seven Psychopaths is fresh, self-assured, and joyous. This film is that one ""weird"" kid at school who didn't suck up to popular kids, didn't wear his 20 year-old hand-me-downs with shame; the kid whose potential went supernova because he wasted no effort placating people who never gave a damn about him anyway.

It's small, it's modestly appointed (few of these guys have money), and every actor wears his or her character like a bespoke suit. If, like me, you're always wondering how & why some pretty decent men sustain friendships with mad eejits, you'll grasp some of the appeal of this movie.",1456790400,,1213,5.06

5106609,5,B007REV4LQ,"This movie is not for those who are offended by curse words or violence or social/political incorrectness.

But then, the movie is called ""Seven Psychopaths"", isn't it? Shouldn't that suggest that the film probably wouldn't be enjoyed by those who are easily offended by such things? Those are the sorts of things psychopaths might be likely to indulge in...right?

Sadly, the content of most of the 1- and 2-star reviews seems to suggest that quite a few people didn't make that inference. ""I stopped watching because of the repeated use of the f-word."" ""I couldn't continue watching after they called the one lady the n-word."" Etc. etc... These are horrible people we're watching, folks. Of course they're going to offend us.

Oh well, I thought the movie was great. But I'm not about to be like so many other reviewers and list all of the plot details. Spoilers are no fun.

This is a dark comedy. It's certainly not meant to appeal to common sensibilities; most often it's meant to satirize them. It also (quite amusingly) satirizes itself and the general ""gangster/revenge drama"" genre which it very much knows it fits into (mostly). The movie laughs at itself, it's intentionally absurd at times, but if you stick around and pay attention the payoff is there to be enjoyed.",1451779200,51,1279,4.853211009174312

5106621,5,B007REV4LQ,"I loved this. Many reviewers, however, did not - which is only to be expected, as this one is definitely not what it says on the tin. For some reason it was marketed as a comedy:  a Tarantino-esque, crime fiasco movie. And in the first half, it does have moments of masquerading as just such a movie. But if that's what you came for, you're likely to go away disappointed, because this is not that movie. It succeeds on that level, to a point. But only to a point. If what you want is a great beer drinking night movie full of wild scenes and crazy laughs, you're going to find the second half boring.

The second half is where the movie takes its mask off. Underneath is a different kind of movie entirely. A movie about a writer trying to understand what it means to be a psychopath, so he can finish his screenplay, who gets far more insight than he bargained for. You may hate that movie or you may love it. But that's the movie you're getting. It doesn't have the seven psychopaths pictured on the movie poster in it. And it's only incidentally about a kidnapped dog.

In my case, the real movie starts with three strikes against it:  1) I can't stand Colin Farrell, never forgiven him for his atrocious performance in Alexander. 2) I hate movies with main characters who are movie writers, they make me feel the writer was lazy and desperate. 3) I hate even worse the trope that writers can't write anything except exact depictions of events they personally live through so they have to live the events of the movie and then write about it. This is that movie.

And yet it works, for me at least. Your mileage may vary. There's a good case to be made that the goal is pretentious, that the second half drags, that the moral when it comes is about as subtle as a shovel to the side of the head. Several reviewers seem to feel that this is a failed parody of crime fiasco movies, which I think is missing the point. This not intended as a parody of anything. It's a deadly serious movie about crime fiasco movies, and what it would feel like to be friends with the people from them. There are some great laughs along the way, but the best bits are not the funny bits.

It goes without saying that this is a great cast. Christopher Walken walks off with every scene he's in. Woody Harrelson projects an aura of effortless menace. Sam Rockwell manages to be so disturbing that it's sometimes hard to look at him. I even liked Colin Farrell.

If black humor, cheese, buckets of gore, and overt philosophy lessons sound good to you, you might just love this movie. If not - at least you can't say I didn't warn you.",1449705600,3,2615,4.357289527720739

5106705,5,B007REV4LQ,"Seven Psychopaths is a much different comedy than most, in the sense that it has a special nostalgia that most action-comedies do not. The cast is absolutely perfect with great cameos (including Tom Waits). The film is about a screenwriter who is having trouble writing his next piece about seven psychopaths, each with their own story and special traits to make the story have it's own personality. Soon the screenwriter finds out his story may be more truth than fiction. This is a movie I simply can't suggest enough with it's slightly excessive violence and over the top comedic cast, it's really one worth checking out for any fan of gun-fights, comedy, and Woody Harrelson.",1448150400,,679,4.913043478260869

What's interesting is that at 7:30 he takes the $500 and says he's just going to put it here.
Take it if you want.  7:30 - 7:32 to trap people in an act their don't expect to be guilt-ed for.
All part of making money off a people's love of the Canus.
But i am guessing the Canus are smarter than the people.

5106979,5,B007REV4LQ,"This film is definitely not for everyone.  I gave it FIVE big stars because I have a sick, morbid sense of humor, and I love gratuitous and graphic violence in a classy setting.  Harvey Keitel, with a cravat!  How classy can you get?  And the wonderful Tom Waits has a meaty role, bringing pathos to the psycho he plays.  But of course, there are other psychos, not as sympatico.
A delightfully twisted, sick film, with nary a dull moment - - well, maybe a moment or two, but never fear, something is about to happen!",1443139200,,517,4.4

5106987,5,B007REV4LQ,I really enjoyed this. The actors are really colorful and play realistic personalities. The amount of humour thrown in was done tastefully so as not to be stupid. I always love a flick where I can't just guess what is going to happen next.,1443139200,,239,4.454545454545454

At first I had low expectations, (got attracted to the movie because of Woody Harrelson), but within the first 10 minutes I was engaged with the movie. A few nice cameos in the movie, def not a big-budget movie, but it was well acted and got some spins and twists as well. Not bad for a free movie!",1443139200,,378,4.053333333333334

5107177,3,B007REV4LQ,"I was curious to see this after having very much enjoyed the director's previous film IN BRUGES, which also featured Colin Farrell. While both films share some similar thematic points or character qualities, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is a bit more meandering in terms of unfolding it story-line. It's one of those ""Hollywood' set screwball comedies with a few graphic bursts of violence and craziness. Christopher Walken is very good in it, but his performance doesn't feel like much of a stretch for him. The character he played felt written for what we would expect him to act like anyway. Tom Waits has a fun cameo in it. He plays a variation on a Dexter like serial killer. I like the cast overall and it's (mostly) fun to hang out with them for the duration. Sam Rockwell is the crazy funny guy with Farrell acting mainly as the straight man here, Woody Harrelson is entertaining as a very angry mob guy who loves his little dog. It's a fun film but nowhere even close to as good as IN BRUGES which is just terrific IMO. Both films share a sense of humor that is very dark, but the earlier film delivers on the set-up in a way this one falls short of. If you enjoy movies set around L.A. withe a lot odd ball characters, and leavened with bits of over the top nastiness, you'll perhaps like this.",1440633600,9,1293,4.483050847457627

I felt like the men were more socio than psycho and the movie dragged on and on with very little to offer after the opening scene.  Like riding on a roller coaster that only has the hill as the bet part of the entire ride and the rest is all downhill.  I want a roller coaster that scares  or freaks the crap out of me not leaving me feeling like it was a ripped off. ACTOR Budget and not enough spent  on action.  .,1439683200,,474,3.9368421052631577

5107316,4,B007REV4LQ,"There may be a message of sorts, in this film about a  murderous psychopath bent on ridding society of other murderous psychopaths... or maybe not. All I know is, I enjoyed watching this dark comedy. Collin Farrell plays Marty, a screen writer struggling with a script about Seven Psychopaths. His drinking gets in the way of his writing, until his friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) offers to help. Things get out of hand when Billy and his friend Hans, played by Christopher Walken, kidnap the dog of a ruthless crime boss. The movie is populated by more than a few crazy characters and at times it is difficult to keep track of what is real and what exists only in the mind of any one of them. But the acting overcomes all of that. Walken is absolutely perfect, as always, just being himself. There is some nudity and a lot of violence.",1439078400,,832,4.509933774834437

Imagine Dalmer or Son of Sam as a contract killer; they couldn't put it together for 2 minutes. Those  guys are psychopaths.

You know, one of those movies written specifically with a plot line that sort of twists in and on and around itself.  It would be interesting to learn if the actual screenwriter of this whole thing snuck in a few details from his personal life story, just to give everything one more twist. It's true that the movie does knot itself all up- but they do unravel things in the end for the viewer.

5107528,5,B007REV4LQ,"Amazing movie, love every minute of it... contains almost every element you can think of: violence, philosophy, comedy, poignancy, action et al. The biggest surprise was the humor - I was expecting subtle ironic laughs, but this is genuinely historical - I mean fits of giggles funny - so many classic one-liners it needs a second viewing to catch them all. It's pretty much a male cast, and each is superb/flawless - Christopher Walken's character has spiritual power and a quirky stubbornness ""put your hands up... no... why?... I don't want to... but I have a gun... yeah, I know"" - Sam Rockwell is awesome as the goofball psycho, Woody Harrelson just has the mean, vicious, bad guy down so well now, but here he adds the comedy brilliantly: ""my guns jammed again... you need to get a new one boss... but I like the blue handle"" - Colin Farrell, pulls off the alcoholic, confused writer, (who is also the only character living on the edge of his nerves) perfectly - he wants to write a movie about a Buddhist, pacifist psychopath - so no wonder he's stuck - he toys with changing the main character to Amish or Quaker - he basically wants to write a gentle movie but is stuck with a great title ""Seven Psychopaths"" ... and it all flows from there. This movie has an absurdly crammed plot but never once does it lose itself or become incoherent - genius on the part of the writer/director - it's also evident that this is a British movie set in the USA, the way it handles itself is so NOT Hollywood - thankfully!!!!",1437177600,2,1518,4.5236363636363635

When I saw Shawshank redemption, I felt that - and the movie eventually did great through word of mouth. And now this movie. May be it is name of the movie or may be it wasn't sold well and so it wasn't an instant box office hit. But this is a really good movie. It is described as being dark comedy but it can also be categorized in several other categories such as adventure or drama and even spiritual (My bias is towards looking at it this way).

This movie is quite original in its handling of the skewed line between reality and entertainment. Woody Harrelson and Colin Farrel are also quite entertaining, but are somewhat dimmed by the brilliance of Rockwell and Walken. I was also very excited to see Tom Waits with a small (yet very creepy) part in this fun film. I love him as an actor as much as I love him as a musical performer.",1436572800,,562,4.744897959183674

Of course Christopher Walken is perfect as is Woody Harrelson.  Every character from the main to the smaller supporting roles are absolutely perfect.  The casting is awesome and spot on for each character.  Be warned there is plenty of graphic violence, but with a title like Seven Psychopaths did you really think otherwise?

5107892,5,B007REV4LQ,"You know, I generally don't like this type of Christian based ""formula"" love story, but somehow, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is much different. It kind of writes itself. I felt very close to this story. Oh the pains of writing. Getting critiques and advice that ping pongs a screenplay around to the point of not recognizing the story anymore. But before I get into that, I think it is important for me to bring up two important things: Number 1- No animals were harmed in this film. The Shih-Tzu and the rabbits were handled very gingerly. That's not easy to do, what with all the shootings, stabbing, incineration, and explosions. And letter B- P.P. Arnold sounds a lot like Ronnie Spector. They played ""The First Cut Is The Deepest"" while the credits roll.  I used to tell my wife that I thought the words in the credits go down, when in actuality, they go up. It's my eyes that are going down as the words go up. If I ever finish a screenplay, I'm going to have the credits go down, instead of up. Sort of a break away from the Hollywood ""rules"". Maybe I'll have to try to get a deal in China to get agreement on that. Arghh, I'll never get finished, what with the subtitles and everything. Almost forgot- Roman Numeral III- Sam Rockwell would be great playing Johnny Carson in a movie. I noticed that in the movie ""Everybody's Fine"".  I can picture him saying ""I did not know that."" Hay yo-o-o-o-o! Look, I'm not going to say anything else about the movie. You have experience it. I will say this though... If you put Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken in a movie together, it's not going to be your typical Christian based love story. And then stick Tom Waits in there for some extra weirdness. ""got no time for the corner boys, down in the street makin' all that noise,  don't want no whores on eighth avenue, cause tonight i'm gonna be with you.  cause tonight i'm gonna take that ride, across the river to the jersey side,  take my baby to the carnival, and i'll take you on all the rides, sing sha la  la la la la sha la la la.  down the shore everything's alright, you with your baby on a saturday night,  don't you know that all my dreams come true, when i'm walkin' down the street  with you, sing sha la la la la la sha la la la...""",1434412800,,2242,4.357314148681056

5107926,2,B007REV4LQ,Well acted and a great cast. It ran long in getting to the end of what is a nutty story line with no good hero. Evil wins and innocence loses again. It's tough to feel good after the movie because the gangster lives and the good guys are dead.,1434412800,,243,3.979591836734694

Christopher Walken performs a memorable, poignant role in this dark comedy. His performance alone makes the movie worth watching. Sam Rockwell comes in second at his psychopathic best.",1434240000,,350,5.051724137931035

There were some humorous moments, some cruelty, some (many) inane lines.......I did watch it to the end........but have no good excuse for having done so. The most surprising thing about this flick is that it was produced. The second most....that some 'name' actors performed in it.

5107960,3,B007REV4LQ,"I was SO looking forward to watching this film.  For one thing, how can you go wrong with a cast like that?  But no, the writer/director just had to ruin it with over-the-top violence, gore, and language.  Too bad really; the premise and the screenplay were freaking brilliant.  I laughed almost constantly the first 10 minutes.  The comic relief wasn't enough to lift you over the disturbing stuff though. What could have been just enough violence to convey realism, turned in to a gore-fest about the joy of killing.  Something you'd expect if Quentin Tarantino collaborated on a movie with Charles Manson.  (Why did you have to go THERE, McDonagh?)  Seems like the actors would have said, ""Hey!  Let's tone it down a little!""  I turned it off after 20 minutes or when I got nauseated - can't remember which happened first.

I gave it 3 stars for originality, clever dialogue, and several hilarious lines.  And for Sam Rockwell.  (Note to self:  Use caution next time you start to watch a Martin McDonagh film.)",1434153600,,1013,4.747126436781609

5107962,4,B007REV4LQ,"Like Zero Effect, this is more likely than not one of the best under-rated films of the last two decades (though it doesn't quite reach the level of Fight Club or Donnie Darko...it may vie with Vanilla Sky or Before Sunrise). Primarily it rests on the merits of its writing...darkly humorous with an interesting, possibly psychological-literary-critic's mentality and a Looney Tunes playfulness when it comes to tying things together). And, if I had to guess, the cast came together for little more than peanuts, simply because they loved the screenplay.

If you liked any of the films I've listed, you could probably ignore the bad reviews this film has received. If you're sailing in that boat, watch it with an open mind, even if you can't stand Colin Farrell.

5107985,4,B007REV4LQ,"Between the end of February 2015 and May 2015 I watched seven (7) movies, in addition to the 10 I previously contributed reviews for, where Colin Farrell played a key role.  In alphabetical order, the 7 movies are: Ask the Dust, Cassandras Dream, Horrible Bosses, Minority Report, The Recruit, Seven Psychopaths and Winters Tale.

I only now became aware that the actor was being honored for his overall achievements in film.  Around mid- May this year, the movie The Lobster was awarded third place (Prix du Jury) in the Cannas Film Festival, which an international award.  But, its the Maui Film Festival Navigator Award that sums up my sentiments of Colin Farrells performances in every movie I have watched so far. Theres nothing I could write that could be more persuasive to get people to watch his movies than recent recognition of the actor and his abilities.  It seems appropriate to  support the actor and the movies Ive watched by posting this in lieu of fleshing out individual reviews.

The following is from MauiNow.com (Posted 06:23 PM HST, June 5, 2015):
Colin Farrell was the recipient of the esteemed Navigator Award, during the Celestial Cinema on Friday night (06/05/2015) at the 16th annual Maui Film Festival.

The Maui Film Festival Navigator Award honors a film artist for carving a path of distinction through the turbulent waters of the entertainment industry without sacrificing their fundamental commitment to excellence.

Colin Farrell is a chameleon who constantly creates one-of-a-kind characters that send pitch perfect pebble-to-boulder-sized ripples through whatever story his performance is helping to tell, said festival founder and director Barry Rivers.

I wondered whether this could be Instant Video waste of time. Thankfully, I continued to watch it, and two things about the movie made me glad to have watched it to the end. First, the story is actually really good/funny. In a weird way, the movie's a bit about friendship and selflessly doing something for a friend (regardless of how psychotic that may be). Secondly, there are some great lines!  Some fail, but I laughed out loud several times.  If you line stupid one liners, you'll find some really good ones in this movie.

5108051,5,B007REV4LQ,"Any movie with Christopher Walken is worth watching and this is no exception. It's fun, interesting and fast paced and definitely off the reservation in terms of story line. The overall concept is that you're following an author while he struggles with his sobriety to write another book. He has a crazy friend that inspires him to write his crazy next novel. Another crazy friend (Walken) that kidnaps dogs for ransom. All the while, the author, crazy friend and Walken are being chased by Woody Harrelson as he tries to save his kidnapped dog. Woody Harrleson is a mafia sort of fella with no real empathy except for his missing pocket pet dog. You have to have an open mind, be willing to embrace the crazy, and not really mind that the story is all over the place while interjecting dry wit humor.

This is a comedy that requires a good amount of attention to fully grasp, and you'll need to have a decent amount of appreciation for the unexpected and the ridiculous.  A good measure to tell if you'd like this movie is if you like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (more specifically the bar critic episode).  The characters try to solve their problems in the worst possible ways; if you think that is funny, you'll love this movie.

ROCKWELL, FARRELL, WALKEN, HARRELSON, WAITS STANTION plus a delightful little poochie all layer this dark tale set in Hollywood, dealing with writer's block - is it?  Our writer - the devilishly handsome Mr. Farrell - an Irish Laddie who likes his wee drop of whiskey  - literally finds himself surrounded by 'the afflicted' including his Actor friend - the always delightful Mr. Rockwell who plays an out of work Actor with rather an unusual side-job.

From the opending scene which introduces us to two patiently waiting hit men - to the concluding 'shots' one just cannot look away.  The desert sequences are particularly beautiful.

It's something along the lines of ""Black Marble"" meets ""A Fish Called Wanda"" ..... and fragments of a classic Pekinpah blood-bath throughout - when 'things' run foul.

5108128,4,B007REV4LQ,"Gleefully dark comedy with a habitual tendency to go meta. That's actually a central point of the plot, which revolves around Colin Farrell's tail-chasing efforts to compose the film's screenplay whilst in the midst of it. We dance around this issue for a bit in the first hour, but once embraced it leads to a number of sharp, bitterly funny conversations and revelations that really help the film stand out as something different. Its jaded, desensitized approach to gruesome violence can be unsettling, but something tells me that's kind of the point. For that matter, so are the simple, shallow characters that pepper the perimeter and the story's rambling, uncertain climax. Farrell is constantly bookended by his cohorts, Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken, who portray two glaringly colorful characters but don't really bring a lot of depth or flavor to the mix. They're each painted with a single stroke, which could again be construed as part of the film's message... but at some point it's natural to question how many times it can fall back on that ready-made excuse. Funny, black hearted and world-weary, but it feels like too much attention is paid to the undercurrents in lieu of the ocean.",1394668800,2,1205,5.0

5108135,3,B007REV4LQ,"My main complaint is that the movie is so, so serious and psycological, no pun intended, but it is a lot more depressing than the previews came across. It's like a comedy version of Taxi Driver. You have these actors going through the ins and outs of being a psychopath on screen and doing crazy crap, and that's just not what the preview made the movie come across as. Yes, there was supposed to be general insaneness and killing--but there's really no main comedy tone, it's mostly a sad depressing tone about the varying levels of being a psychopath and what the psychopaths want from their drama to fulfill their psychopathic desires. That would be the main theme of the movie, how each psycho feels about their drama and what they want from the drama they hope to create in their lives.

I thought it was a little disgusting there was so much violence against women in this movie. That's where I really regretted renting it. There was real drama against women, there was a lot of it, there were fantasies about it, and at that point, despite being able to get through the nasty sex scenes, the crazy, violent, and grotesque for anyone's standards, murders, (and by anyone's standards that is not a joke because I had some pretty twisted English professors in college who made AN ALL GIRLS DETECTIVE NOVEL CLASS read super-duper sick rape literature) it just became a little too heavy, and I would not rent the movie again. I personally hate the Godfather movies because there is so much crazy, arbitrary, gross, and unnecessary raging, violence, and revenge against women....and I think that's only entertaining for psycopathic, psycopathetic males.

5108137,2,B007REV4LQ,"Honestly? Hmmm... very mixed feelings about this.

Screenwriter Marty (a subdued Colin Farrell who leaves most of the acting to his eyebrows) is suffering a creative block, when his best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) gets him involved with a long term dog kidnapping caper that goes wrong when his partner ( Christopher Walken) inadvertently steals the mutt of the local mob boss (Woody Harrelson). Cue revenge, cycles of violence, road trips, guns... and Marty finding something to write about.

The opening sequence of this film is excellent, with shades of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction as a near-mythical vigilante dispatches two mob goons in a way that would have made Keyser Soze proud.

The problem is that it is downhill from there on. It is difficult to feel any sympathy for the main hero as he is an abusive alcoholic. His best friend is a psychopath who has no hesitation in dispatching innocent women.

The nearest character I came to liking was the Walken's morally bankrupt dog thief.

It is interesting to note that the film is its own harshest critic when, about two-thirds of the way through, Marty presents a draft script to his pals based on events so far, and they tear it apart for being one-dimensional, lacking any decent female characters and sloppy dialogue. It also gives away the ending at that point too, which I found disappointing.

We're very glad we did.  Yes, there is graphic violence.  But, as odd as this sounds, it's not particularly disturbing as it is really necessary to advance the film.  The fact that humor is liberally distributed throughout the film makes it quite palatable.

5108154,5,B007REV4LQ,"Writer/director Martin McDonagh (`In Bruges') has done it again - created a comedy out of a tale about killing. He pulls this off with a smart script and with a cast of actors that simply could not be improved upon. Once it starts it doesn't stop  - not even at the end of the film when the absurdities just keep flying.

Chronically drunk Irish screenwriter Martin (Colin Farrell) has serious writer's block to the point that his drunken diatribes result in the loss of his girl Kaya (Abbie Cornish) and draws him closer to his best friend and wannabe writer Billy (Sam Rockwell - never better and in fact the true star of this film!). Martin is struggling to write a screenplay called `Seven Psychopaths' and Billy helps him find the characters to reference: crazy old bunny carrying Zachariah (Tom Waits) who shares his youthful killing spree with his wife (Amanda Warren), Cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) and his sidekick Paulo (Zeljko Ivanek) out looking for Charlie's kidnapped Shih Tzu blamed on an innocent Sharice (Gabourey Sidibe), but actually dognapped by Hans (Christopher Waken) to support his hospitalized wife (Linda Bright Clay - in a terrific cameo), a strange old man (Harry Dean Stanton) who slices his own throat, a loony Vietnamese priest (Long Nguyen) and other equally psychopathic characters. There is bona fide madness within and without every character and the manner in which McDonagh makes it all play out is a feat of cinematic genius. In the end Martin realizes that madness is reality and finishes his film  - with a severe twist at the end.

Carter Burwell is responsible for the imaginative musical score, even borrowing a supply gorgeous passage, 'Premiers transports que nui n'oblie' from Berlioz' Romo et Juliette performed by The Monteverdi Choir & Orchestre Rvolutionnaire et Romantique with Catherine Robbin, Jean-Paul Fouchcourt & John Eliot Gardiner (for those curious as to which recording was borrowed!).

5108162,3,B007REV4LQ,"Marty (Colin Farrell) is a Hollywood writer having a writers block (and a drinking problem, too) trying desperately to come up with an idea for the next project titled Seven Psychopaths. The idea arrives in an unexpected way when his officious friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) steals a dog that happened to be a sadistic gangsters.

Though set in Hollywood, Seven Psychopaths is a British crime comedy with a great cast including Christopher Walken, Woody Harrelson and Tom Waits, as well as interesting cameos from Michael Pitt, Gabourey Sidibe and Harry Dean Stanton. This is a sophomore work of Martin McDonagh (In Bruges) as a feature director, which means something for avid filmgoers. The film is often very violent.

Not that I take issue with that. The problem is, despite the effective dark humor, Seven Psychopaths relies too much on violence to further the story, which goes nowhere in the second half. The film often looks like an assortment of discarded ideas for films that did not materialize. The characters self-referential remarks (about female characters, for instance) sound more like an excuse than humor.

The best thing of the interesting but overlong film is naturally Christopher Walken and his character Hans, a person with a dark and mysterious background. His back story alone, the most thought-out and intriguing one among others, is worth watching. On the contrary, female characters played by Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko are little better than cyphers, or worse.

And writer / director Martin McDonagh obviously knows that, as thats exactly what one character in the film points out. This is where smugness gets the film, which stops being what it started out to be, a crime drama about seven psychopaths. Instead, it ends up being a commentary about itself, which is not really smart or interesting as it seems to think.",1384732800,,1852,5.062295081967213

5108166,5,B007REV4LQ,"First off, if you don't like dark comedies, or if you can't stomach ""self-aware"" movies... then just don't watch.

But if you can get past that, then... omg, it's awesome.  All of these actors are at their best.  It's like all of Harrelson, Rockwell, and Walken were told to act as over the top weird/semi-psycho as they could.  Meanwhile, Farrell, the drunk, is the only sane one among the lot.

I think they all had their own moments and some really good lines.  My favorite line: ""Friends don't make friends die for them!""  ""Well, psychopathic friends do.""

I watched it twice.  The second time around, I bought in HD because this is the kind of movie I could watch several times.

I don't want to ruin the movie, but you'll quickly realize all seven of the psychopaths are sort of anti-heroes or anti-psychos.",1384041600,,813,4.6223776223776225

It's never what you expect is gonna happen and it make you laugh and it makes you sad and, best of all, it makes you think. I've read a lot of the negative reviews here and you really shouldn't listen to any of them if you have half a brain. Odds are they went into this expecting a shoot-em-up formulaic action flick. What they got was so much better, but they didn't understand the message of the film, so they didn't get that.

To me, the characters were so blah I couldn't care much for their fates. I predict someone is bound to challenge my screenwriting credentials any second ...

It doesn't deliver the laughs that I'd hoped for, but it's still very enjoyable. It lags at the beginning and takes a bit to get into, but overall I thought it was good. I love Christopher Walken - so he was a big plus.  I think if you enjoy the movies like Snatch or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, then you'll probably enjoy this.

5108232,4,B007REV4LQ,"I'm not going to go into detail re: the plot because others have already done so.  Basically Collin Farrell somewhat of a drunk working on a screenplay and eventually his crazy friend (Sam Rockwell) starts to help and then Christopher Walken gets involved.  Along the way Woody Harrelson plays a bad guy out to get his dog back.  Mayhem ensues.

This film is funny in places, brutal in places and always interesting.  It's structured in a ""meta"" way at times, in that the screenplay becomes this movie, and they may talk through a scene and change it, and it will happen.

Overall it's not perfect - it's a little slow here and there and not everything makes sense - but the performances are just great.  Christopher Walken is always great, Collin Farrell is good (I generally like him but he's a bit overshadowed by the other performances here), Sam Rockwell is his usual quirky, excellent self (really, a truly underrated actor) and Woody Harrelson takes a criminal madman and makes him somewhat sympathetic.

This movie owes some style to Tarrantino, but still it's very enjoyable.  I'd say this is a quirky, interesting film that people will either love or hate.  If the performances weren't so good I don't think this movie would've worked.  But I like it a lot.",1374192000,,1267,4.739726027397261

It has lots of bizarre humor and plenty of violence too, so if that's not your thing, then you won't enjoy this. If you enjoy things that are out of the ordinary and humor that's out of the ordinary as well, this movie is for you!

It's definitely not for everyone, since it's a very polarizing film.

I was laughing so much throughout this entire movie and am just disappointed that more people haven't heard of Seven Psychopaths because they're missing out.

Many compare this to Tarantino films or Guy Ritchie films, and there is something similar about them. However, McDonagh has his own distinct style of writing and characters. But outrageous plots and lots of humor is definitely something they all have in common.

The cast is excellent, all at their funniest, especially Sam Rockwell (whose facial expressions are to die for!).

5108249,4,B007REV4LQ,"This is a movie about making a movie--or that's what it pretends to be.

Theoretically, it's about Martin (Colin Farrell), who wants to write a screenplay called ""Seven Pyschopaths,"" but who doesn't know anything about psychopaths and who hates violence--which is what psychopaths are all about.  So he's stuck.

But his friends, Hans (Christopher Walken), and Billy (Sam Rockwell), help him out.  Hans and Billy support themselves by dog-kidnapping, a low-level scam that sometimes nets them effusive rewards from the grateful owners.  (They don't threaten; just keep the dogs a couple of days silently, then return them as ""found."")

Both Hans and Billy turn out to be nutcases in their own way, and both help Martin develop his psychopath stories.  Billy points out a newspaper story about a mysterious, masked Jack of Diamonds killer who only kills mafia hitmen.  A serial-killer killer.

Billy also places a personal ad for psychopaths in a little freebie paper, which turns up Tom Waits.  Waits carries around a white rabbit, and tells his strange history of rescuing a young woman decades ago who had been captured by a serial killer.  He and she kill the killer and then go on a long campaign of killing serial killers, including, among others, the Zodiac.  Another pair of serial-killer killers.

Hans connects up with another psychopath-story, about a Quaker whose daughter is murdered by a psychopath.  The murderer is caught and jailed, but the Quaker forms a vendetta and pursues him--into jail and beyond, even though the killer has reformed.  Hans apparently is the Quaker.  Hans also resolves Martin's Vengeful-Vietnamese-Priest story relatively peacefully.

Hans and Billy's dog-napping enterprise goes seriously awry when Billy dognaps the Shih-Tsu of a mafia general (Woody Harrelson).

Billy wants to have a big shootout with the mafia men, but Hans is a pacifist and Martin hates violence, so they drive out to the desert to mull it over.

Oh, and by the way, without spoiling anything, Billy is seriously and deeply and crazily misogynist.

It all ends strangely with Martin and Hans and Billy each getting what he wants.

There's a shocking amount of gore and a lot of meditation on whether violence can ever be used against violence.

And Billy, who is the only genuine psychopath, steals the show.

Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson are terrific, and so are all the women actors, though they have small-to-middling parts.  Colin Farrell is only so-so.  I have a feeling Colin Farrell can act, but mostly he doesn't bother to.",1373068800,,2572,5.081145584725537

5108260,5,B007REV4LQ,"Fiction meets reality in this seriously dark comedy. Colin Farrell plays Marty, a struggling writer whose newest screenplay is based on select events in his life. The story involves several killers (thus the title) and how their lives become entangled in one another. Marty's concept is supplied to him by his friend and some time room mate Billy (Sam Rockwell).

Things are set in motion with Billy and Marty's other friend Hans (Christopher Walken), Billy's partner. These two are low level bad guys who make a living by kidnapping dogs of wealthy people and then returning them for a reward. Unfortunately the Shih Tzu that the pair of kidnapped at the moment is the beloved pet of big time mobster Charlie (Woody Harrelson) who sends out his minions to discover who would be so bold and to then kill them.

But the movie offers us more than just this simple story as Billy tells tale after tale to Marty about the various killers he's brought up. One is a Vietnamese killer out to set things straight. Another is a killer who feels his daughter was wronged by a young man. One is known as the Jack of Diamonds killer because he leaves a playing card behind on each of the high level mobsters he kills. And then there is Zachariah (Tom Waites) who replies to an ad Billy placed asking for psychopaths to tell Marty their story. Apparently Zachariah and his wife were multiple serial killers as he unfolds his tale to Marty only to then let him know he'll have to kill him eventually. All of these items play into the whole story that is not only being written by Marty but that he and his friends are actually living.

Along the way we also find out more about Hans and Billy. Hans' wife is in a nursing home and he visits her frequently. One of the many stories that Marty hears and writes about involves Hans and his wife. Several relate to Billy in one way or another. All have surprising consequences that you don't quite see coming as the story unfolds.

That's what makes this movie so special. The pieces of the puzzle are offered to you as viewer but they eventually drop into place as more and more are told the pieces turned this way and that as to make sense. About 2/3 into the film Marty, Hans and Billy go on a road trip to the desert and overnight more tales are told and almost everything the stories have led up to happens.

So many films these days love to take on the title of quirky and few ever live up to that concept. This film grasps it with both hands and clings to it tightly, deservedly so. It not only offers something truly different than most movies have to offer it does so with a unique blend of sadness, adventure and dark humor that rarely combine well but here come together like few films do.

There is nothing that is sub-par about anything involved in this film. The acting is tremendous and all three main leads have their moment in the sun. Farrell downplays his character so as to not be the leading man we've grown accustomed to. Rockwell shows that his abilities are almost always underused until now. And Walken at times does a parody of what we've come to associate with him but then shows that his character is perhaps the one with the biggest heart of all.

With a title like this some will shy away and be afraid of what they will encounter. Then again with the dark humor involved it might not be for everyone. But if you're willing to take a chance you'll find one of the funniest and most touching films albeit a gory film that you will find something to like in it. For me it's one to keep on the shelf and pull out from time to time to enjoy.",1372118400,,3598,4.401503759398496

I'm not sure how the story got lost on them, but bravo for them for not getting the very simple story going on.  Needless action or gore?  Absolutely not.  Marty (Colin) is writing about psychopaths, both fictional and non-fictional.  Being as they are killers, this to me already said it was going to have a bit of gore.  It wasn't needless.  I'm sorry but comparing this to Tarantino and throwing in lines about needless things in movies...  I loved it.  The foundation for it all is really the relationship between Marty and Billy (Rockwell).  This movie kept me on my toes, loved it beginning to end.  Unlike most action movies, it does have some well done drama nearer to the end that ties it all together.

A struggling writer, a stolen dog, and a group of crazy people. Does that sound like an interesting film to you? If not, then get out now. If so, then read on my friend because you just might be crazy enough to enjoy the insanity that is Seven Psychopaths. Crazy, over-the-top premise aside I found myself loving this film. It's fun, it's crazy, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.

You follow Marty Faranan (Colin Farrell), a struggling writer trying to finish his screenplay, ""Seven Psychopaths"". The problem is that Marty can't seem to get started and to top it off he has a bit of a drinking problem. As his friend Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) says, ""It's in your f***ing blood, man!"" Oh, Marty's Irish. So that's what Billy meant by ""It's in your blood"". Anyway, Billy is an unemployed actor who makes a living off of kid-napping dogs with his friend Has Kieslowski (Christopher Walken).

Things take a sharp turn when Billy steals a dog from a violent gangster by the name of Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson). So now these three men are trying to run for their lives so as not to get their heads blown off by Charlie. In an attempt to get away they go out to the dessert where Marty continues to work on his screenplay with Billy and Hans. Only now, he's not sure that this thrilling psychopath movie is what he wants to write anymore because he wants the ending to be grounded and humane.

I never watched Martin McDonagh's previous film In Burges so I'm not sure how that compares to Seven Psychopaths, but if I had to compare this to another movie I think I would use Snatch. Now this is nowhere near the brilliance of Snatch, but Seven Psychopaths has some of the same elements. There's a lot of dark humor and the violence is so over-the-top that the would-be gruesome scenes come off as funny and comedic. Plus, the movie is filled with a lot of interesting characters.

What this film does extremely well, aside from providing you with a unique, engaging story, is keep you guessing. As Marty is writing his story he's starting to use real stories based on previous and current psychopaths (In the movie's world, not reality). So as you watch the story progress you get to see all seven psychopaths in the flesh. The twist is that a few of the characters in this movie appear relatively normal, but you soon learn that sometimes the normal ones are the craziest of them all.

I think that's why I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. You don't expect it to pan out the way that it does, but as you learn these secrets everything just feels right. There have been many recent movies that force these character twists and they don't feel natural, but Seven Psychopaths nails it with ease. It's one of those things that you don't see until you actually see it and then you go ""Ohhhh"".

Surprisingly, Seven Psychopaths isn't all laughs and violence. Throughout the movie you'll see Marty grow as an individual and there's a few heartfelt moments with Hans and his wife Myra (Linda Bright Clay). It's these moments that really help balance out the story and keep everything grounded. Even when Billy's having a shootout or Marty's getting drunk, life never stops. Things happen that are not always under our control. It adds a touch of heart and normality to an otherwise crazy experience.

Finally, the casting in this film is excellent and each of the four leads are phenomenal. Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, and Christopher Walken have fantastic chemistry on screen and it's a joy to watch them in a scene together. Then Woody Harrelson gave another one of his bad-boy-that-has-a-heart performances and nails it yet again. There's really not anyone to complain about in here because even the minor cast members like Tom Waits and Linda Bright Clay nailed their performances.

Overall Score: 8.25/10 - Seven Psychopaths is a blast from start to finish and I'm glad I finally got the chance to see it. It's funny and over-the-top, but it's also charming and there's enough heart there to keep the experience grounded. If you were eyeing this movie in theaters but didn't get the chance to see it then now's the time.",1370476800,,4182,4.663500678426051
5108289,4,B007REV4LQ,"What can I say about this movie? It is weird, it is enjoyable, it is well acted, it makes NO sense for much of its running time, but by the end everything closes well and it has been well worth the journey.

Colin Farrell does some of his best acting here, Sam Rockwell is great as usual though you want to punch his character in the face every in other scene, and ONLY Christopher Walken can tell someone that he doesn't care that he's about to get shot and actually make you believe it. This movie is inventive, breaks from the typical structures, and is funny in a very dark way.

That's another thing. The marketing for this movie makes it seem laugh out loud funny and it is, BUT make no mistake, this is a DARK comedy.

5108315,5,B007REV4LQ,"From my site [...]

A movie that is amazing as the concept is bizarre. Seven Psychopaths is well made, full of action, and absolutely hilarious.

Marty (Colin Farrell) is an alcoholic screen writer with a terrible case of writers block. Martys friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) is very encouraging and constantly tries to help Marty with his screen play. It is clear that Marty doesnt respect Billy, and seeing the strange things Billy does, it is not all that surprising. Billy hangs out with a man named Hans (Christopher Walken). The two abduct dogs and hang on to them until the owners offer a reward. They then turn up and act innocent while returning the dog to collect the reward. Their relatively harmless plan takes a dark turn when Billy kidnaps Bonny, the shih tzu owned by a mob boss named Charlie (Woody Harrelson). The movie never stops moving and it moves quickly at that. Keeping up this pace for two hours is a huge credit to director Martin McDonagh. As the story unfolds it is told not only in the world of Marty, Billy, Hans, and Charlie but also in Martys head as he works his way through the screen play he is working on. As Martys situation becomes more chaotic the barrier between the two worlds starts to seriously blur.

Colin Farrell doesnt always make a hit but he is an actor who always tries hard. In this case his persistent hard work absolutely pays off since Psychopaths is an amazing movie. Farrell also stared in Martin McDonaghs previous movie In Bruges (also a 5/5). Farrell isn't quite the audience perspective or voice of reason in Psychopaths but he is the closest tether to reality the audience is given as they try to keep up with the insane actions of the rest of the movies characters. Sam Rockwell is the most far-out character by far. Despite Rockwells outrageous actions and ideas he is never guilty of chewing the scenery. He pushes his character to the limits but keeps control just enough to be amazing. Rockwell steals every scene he is in and proves yet again he is an actor who can handle any script that is given to him. Christopher Walken also delivers an impressive performance. It seems in recent years that Walken had essentially become a parody of himself and showed up in a lot of really terrible movies just so idiot teenagers would laugh at his distinct speech pattern. Walken is anything but a joke in Psychopaths. He is also out of the norm but at the same time a very calculated man who things about his actions and what he says, Walken gets some of the most shudder-ingly impressive scenes in the movie. Woody Harrelson is always a fan favorite despite most of his performances being very middle of the road. He never disappoints but never blows the audience away. Harrelsons role in psychopaths is a good one and definitely plays to Harrelsons strengths.

The script deserves a lot of credit for all the characters in the movie, it is clear they weren't created by the actors but the actors certainly brought them to life. With a lesser cast and crew this script, while obviously very strong, could have been pushed into the realm of far too ridiculous and fell flat on its face. The serious subject matter, brutal violence, and perfect blend of comedy are all proof of how strong the screen play really was.

Seven Psychopaths is a rare combination of fairly serious subject matter and outright hilarious comedy. The jokes are smart, the dialogue snaps, and the actors are flawless. Martin McDonagh took an incredibly strong script and molded it into an absolute master piece.",1368489600,,3538,4.681672025723473

That is if merely being a brutal murderer qualifies a person as such. I'd argue that, outside of the pop-based pseudoscience known as psychology, it doesn't, but that semantic debate is beside the point. Director Martin McDonagh reels you in right from the beginning with two mob-style killers engaging in interesting dialogue,  la Quentin Tarantino, and the movie never really goes boring from there. It never really goes particularly enjoyable neither, let alone as clever as it aims to be. The Billy Bickle character, a source of comic relief in a movie that would do better without it, is annoying, but the little Shih Tzu dog, which plays a major role in relation to the plot, is adorable.

That being said I loved it, it was very funny with sort of a different kind of comedy to it. Very odd, but a great movie. The writing was great for sure. Through most of the movie I wasn't really sure what was going to happen, which I love. I like when a movie keeps you guessing as most movies are pretty predictable. The director is also the same person that wrote it and he directed In Bruges (another good movie).

There was a lot of dialogue and during a couple parts it sort of makes fun of movies. I loved this, but I can see how some may not like that much cleaver dialogue or may not find it cleaver, but I thought it was awesome.",1365984000,,746,4.074829931972789
5108374,5,B007REV4LQ,"Like Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie before him, Martin McDonagh has struck it rich with a crime caper formula that is witty, exciting, so unpretentious. He is a playwright by trade, and Seven Psychopaths is like watching a Broadway theatrical production on the big screen. The movie is very deja-vuish like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-Turn/dp/0767805763/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U Turn</a>, but is intelligent enough through its multi-layered storyline to top&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B0047WJ12K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>.

In most cases, when a director makes a movie about ""making a movie"" or an author writes about a ""writer,"" it comes off as cliche and effective as beating a dead horse. I'm thinking latter day Steven King, especially the Z-grade movie adaptations that get churned out every other year. These types of movies/books/stories, etc. are stale before they hit the audience because the person at the helm is starving for original material and has nothing but their narrow-minded pursuit to draw upon. Seven Psychopaths rips on the entire movie industry, the acting profession, and the very core of celluloid as an art form while keeping its over-the-top action vehicle from derailing. The chemistry between a trio of Hollywood degenerates portrays irrational characters in a way that would not occur outside of a movie script (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/B005T3AYAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>), yet is dumb-downed enough for mass consumption.

Collin Farrel and Sam Rockwell share leads, while Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson play a good supporting cast. A shih-tzu is both central conflict and comedic sidekick. There is some excellent scenery chewing going on in this movie, and Christopher Walken delivers his finest performance in years at the end of the film. Yes, it can be mean-spirited at times, and I wouldn't consider Seven Psychopaths much of a comedy, but satire and a kickass movie experience it will deliver.",1365984000,,2163,6.328813559322034
5108375,5,B007REV4LQ,"AMAZING movie! The cast of this movie is phenomenal, with impeccable chemistry between Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell and Christopher Walken. I've heard people say that the movie drags on at parts but i couldn't disagree more. There is an abundance of humor and some very emotional scenes as well as some great cinematography. I could watch this movie a million times, and i probably will 'cause I'm making all my friends watch it too.

5108376,4,B007REV4LQ,"I'm a huge fan of `In Bruges'.  I thought it was a clever mix of action, thrills, comedy and emotional connection, and it provided Colin Farrell with his finest performance (and character) to date.  `Seven Psychopaths' was Martin McDonagh's follow up to `In Bruges', and with a reteaming with Farrell I must say that I was very interested (and hopeful) to see how this one panned out.

While not as well rounded as `In Bruges', `Seven Psychopaths' sports a rich ensemble cast and some fun dialog that keeps the scenes moving, even when the plot begins to ware thing.  The opening scene is brilliantly written and sets a tone for the film that made me anxious to see more.  Sadly, I found the floundering finale to be a bit of a letdown, and the overall development of the dual storylines (the actual psychos and the fictional tale regarding them) was somewhat gargled in the process.

That said, this is thoroughly entertaining!

The ensemble is pretty great, with Woody Harrelson taking the cake for me.  His brooding mix of theatrical emotions and commanding intensity made for an irresistible character.  The world loves Sam Rockwell far more than I do, and I've seen him play this character before, but he was funny and effective to say the least.  Walkin was Walkin, but the more tender moments felt really authentic.  Farrell is more of an observer here.  He's the least eccentric in the cast and so his character comes off slightly boring.  That isn't to say that he's bad here, he's just not the center of attention.

Funny, sharp and exciting, `Seven Psychopaths' may be as cluttered as the title suggests (and not as clear and concise as it should have been) but McDonagh has a knack for dialog and he makes the best of it here.",1365984000,,1738,4.6743421052631575

In short: imagine in combination the violence of Tarantino without the crisp, witty dialogue; the pacing of In Bruges without the insight or the beauty; and the agony of knowing that you will never recover the time you've spent watching this movie.

5108424,4,B007REV4LQ,"From British filmmaker Martin McDonagh (""In Bruges"", ""Six Shooter"") comes the black comedy film ""Seven Psychopaths"".  Premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival in Sept. 2012 and released in theaters the following month, ""Seven Psychopaths"" will now be released on DVD in Jan. 2013.

The film begins with a writer named Marty Faranan (portrayed by Colin Farrell), who is working on a screenplay titled ""Seven Psychopaths"", about seven psychopaths but for now, all he can think of is one.  A Vietnamese victim who wants revenge on the US military that killed his family during the Vietnam War.  And wanting to create an action-film, he's have a difficulty coming up with ideas.

Meanwhile, his friends include Billy Bickle (portrayed by Sam Rockwell), an unemployed actor and a crazy guy who steals dogs for a living in order to get owners cash rewards for the dog's safe return.  Billy tries to help Marty by trying to get him to use real serial killers as inspiration for the psychopaths such as the ""Jack of Diamonds"" killer (who is known for leaving the Jack of Diamonds with those he kills) and even ""Quaker"", who stalks his daughters killer for decades.  Billy goes as far as to place an advertisement in a newspaper inviting psychopaths to share their stories with Marty.

Marty also hangs out with a religious man named Hans Kieslowski (portrayed by Christopher Walken) who is trying to take care of his wife Myra (portrayed by Linda Bright), who is hospitalized for cancer.

One day, Billy and Hans steal a Shih Tzu named Bonny, unaware that it belongs to Charlie Costello (portrayed by Woody Harrelson), a violent gangster.  When one of Charlie's men named Paulo (portrayed by Zelijko Ivanek) finds out that Hans is connected to the kidnapping, they go to Billy's home where they threaten to kill Marty and Hans unless they reveal Bonny's location.  But the Jack of Diamonds killer arrives and kills Charlie's thugs.

Meanwhile, a murderer named Zachariah Rigby (portrayed by Tom Waits), responds to the ad in the newspaper.  And he tells Marty a story about how he rescued a girl named Maggie from a killer's basement long ago.  And the two became a couple and would become serial killers of actual killers.  Traveling around America and murdering killers.  But when he found Maggie to be to cruel in her methods of killing, the two split.  And Zachariah wants Marty to leave a message for Maggie at the end of the film if he plans to use his story in his screenplay.  And Marty swears on his life that he will.

As Hans is planning to visit his wife in the hospital, Charlie gets there before he does.  Very emotional about his dog being stolen and worried that his Bonny will be killed, he sends a message to Hans and his friends by killing Myra.

These events then lead to Billy killing Charlie's ex-girlfriend Angela (portrayed by Olga Kurylenko) and leading Marty, Billy and Hans to go on the run with Bonny.  And as Marty spends time with Billy and Hans in the middle of nowhere, he quickly learns that his two friends have a secret they have been hiding.  And as for Billy, he has invited Charlie and his men to come get his dog at their location, in hopes for a major shootout.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Seven Psychopaths"" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen and English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  It's important to note that if you want the best picture quality possible for ""Seven Psychopaths"", you will want to purchase a Blu-ray review copy of the film.

As for the DVD, picture quality is as good as it gets on DVD.  Picture quality features very good detail and warm colors.  Closeups are very good and considering the film is shot outdoors, the DVD looks very good but obviously, I'm quite sure the Blu-ray version looks magnificent.

As for audio, the film is pretty much a dialogue driven film, so mostly the audio is center and front-channel driven.  There are some action scenes involving gunfire towards the end but for the most part, dialogue and music are clear.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

So far, leave it to Martin McDonagh to create unique films that are nothing like typical, banal Hollywood films.

The director who wowed audiences and film critics with ""In Bruges"" is back with a film that is a black comedy featuring amoral characters that literally builds into this standoff of who can be the better psychopath.

With two storylines within the film, one that involves a screenplay about ""Seven Psycopaths"" and the lead character trying to find inspiration for his film by talking to actual serial killers, the violent storylines that he tries to think up for his screenplay is quite fascinating, very violent but also humorous.

But it's the battle between Marty's friends vs. Charlie and his thugs that make the film worth watching.  While Marty is the most reserved, Hans is quiet, it's Billy that is the mysterious unknown character because at first, you think he's just a con-man, but the more the film continues, you realize that he is quite a psychopath.  And the fact that he has found his matchup, another psychopath, the notorious gangster known as Charlie is quite interesting.

Woody Harrelson plays a sensitive and crazy gangster who cares about his dog but will not hesitate to kill innocent people.  You need someone crazy to go against crazy and on Marty's side, you have the actor Sam Rockwell, always known for playing versatile roles, who matches up with Woody Harrelson's craziness with efficacy.  Especially as these two, will primarily the character of Billy, who seems he must outdo the craziness of Charlie.

As for Hans, his character is rather complex.  A quiet religious man, his nature tends to change after the murder of his wife Myra.  And you eventually learn more about him and also Billy, as the film continues.

As for the DVD release, first, I must say that this is a beautiful film and if you have a Blu-ray player, it's definitely worth checking out on Blu-ray.  But on DVD, the film does look and sound good, while I felt the special features was quite short at around under three minutes each.  So, I wish there were lengthier special features, maybe even an audio commentary.

Overall, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is unlike any film I have ever seen.  A dark comedy which the character Hans would even say ""has many layers"", but its the way the film was written and how the characters are presented, it definitely made this film much more satisfying.  An original and unique film with a lot of twists along the way, Martin McDonagh's ""Seven Psychopaths"" is recommended!",1364601600,,7346,4.847389558232932
5108425,1,B007REV4LQ,"I watched this movie on the basis of the Rotten Tomatoes and Amazon reviews, which are largely positive. However, these reviews are probably from people who liked In Bruges, which I hated. I didn't realize until after I saw the movie that this is virtually the same cast and director as In Bruges

I thought that this was a pretty horrible movie. I suppose that movies like this are the American answer to the surreal French films. Which I don't like either.

So if you're not a fan of surreal movies and you didn't like In Bruges, then you're not going to like this movie either.

As far as I'm concerned this movie doesn't pass for entertainment. Nor does the twisted plot count for what I consider intellectual stimulation. There's a lot of movie blood (lots of people get either shot in the head or have their heads completely blown off). The plot meanders around. At the end its not clear whether the movie actually happened or whether it was just a screen play that the author was writing. Or what. But who cares.",1364601600,2,1019,4.5271739130434785

With this in mind I rented it from Netflix.  It is humorless, trite, and filled with the type of overacting one associates with high school plays.  One can only wonder what advice the director gave Rockwell, who does everything but chew up the scenery.  His character is so obnoxious I was hoping he'd be killed off quickly.  No such luck.  Colin Farrell acts as though he doesn't want much to do with the entire enterprise - who can blame him?  If you enjoy watching films in which hardly anyone acts as a human being might act under similar circumstances then this film is for you.  Chris Walken's character's wife is killed and his reaction is to smile that Walken smile. He shows more emotion when he finds that his own life story has been pilfered by another character.  Really?

5108450,1,B007REV4LQ,"2 psychopaths turn out to be 1 psychopath. Another psychopath is completely made up for script in this film. Even overlooking what the title clearly advertises to the viewer, this movie is just plain boring, unrealistic and feels like a amateurish beginner's attempt at script writing at a film school which is understandable for students, but not for directors. By the way, the trailer for Martin McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths lists off several characters that were not actually psychopaths in the Seven Psychopaths (both girls and the, ""Seemingly normal,"" guy who is just a dorky writer caught in the middle of the plot).

Before I continue, note that I will count what the movie counted as psychopaths as I describe the plot to you. The plot starts with these 2 guys trying to write script for a film that they only have the title for (Seven Psychopaths), but one writer is secretly a serial killer and psychopath (1) who has knowingly stolen a dog and girlfriend from a gangster boss (2) while disguised as another mysterious psychopathic serial killer dressed in all black with a red scarf (3). Along the way, the writer and his friend (supposedly the writer's co-writer) write about a fictional psychopath who was formally a Vietcong soldier in the Vietnam War (4), interview an old serial killer (5) who once had a girlfriend (6) whom he traveled around with to kill famous serial killers and another self-mutilating psychopath (7) who tags along with the writer and his crazy friend throughout the story for the sake of having Christopher Walken in the movie and nothing more. The 2 friends and Christopher Walken are basically trying to outrun the gangster boss psychopath who wants his beloved dog back that the writer's friend stole. Contrary to the film's advertisement, the gangster boss' girlfriend and the writer's girlfriend are small side characters at best. However, the writer's crazy friend, supposed fellow writer and secret serial killer who dresses up in an all-black disguise is counted as 2 psychopaths, but I do not count this 1 psychopath as 2. The Vietcong psychopath is a fictional character made up for a writer's movie script in Seven Psychopaths. Even if it turned out that the Vietcong psychopath was based on a real person, it's hearsay at best in the film and, other than being mentioned occasionally, the Vietcong psychopath is pointless and not very entertaining overall.

There isn't much chaos or mayhem, it's not really that funny, most of the characters aren't really that psychotic and the ending is stupid and doesn't make much sense in director Martin McDonagh's dull and lacking Seven Psychopaths film. As dishonest as the advertisement is, the advertisement was way more entertaining than the actual movie itself.",1363996800,3,2758,5.0196506550218345

I chose to see it basically because the cast, and the title interested me.  I am so glad I chose to see it. I found this movie to just be plain out quirky fun. Thoroughly enjoyable. The humor is subtle and a bit dry. The script appears to be seemingly all over the place with a total lack of cohesion; I think that the writer wrapped it up together nicely in the end. There will be people who will say what did this have to do with that and so forth. In truth life is all over the place and lacks cohesion. The main focus is on one character and how random events in his life play out. We never know how people or events that occur will affect our lives. I find the story-line to be similar, except that this character finds inspiration in the strange happenings that is his life.

I recall people telling me they loved Seinfeld because it was a show about nothing, just nonsense. I'd imagine that people who enjoyed the quirkiness of that show would enjoy this film. It's sort of a fun nonsense.",1363305600,,1165,4.243243243243243

The action is inthe trailer for the film.  I admit it had some good humor and some characters were decently crafted.  But that's why it gets 2.5.  The actors did a good job with what they had to work with, and oddly enough walken was not the most memorable one, still he added a good deal, but the plot after 45 minutes gets boring and the film drags on and on and on.  Much like this review would if I didn't say this: 2.5 stars at best, good acting, WALKEN!, humor... Everything else was boring.

Christopher Walken steals the show with his deadpan lines.  My favorite is when he delivers this line to Marty who is studying psychopaths for his movie script, ""You're the one that thought psychopaths were so interesting. They get tiresome after a while, don't you think?"" In this movie, McDonagh shows you another side of psychopaths, for example, killers who target serial killers.  Psychopaths that take out the bad guys.  If nothing else it gets you do think about personality disorders in a different way.

However this time, the fur flies when Hans and Billy kidnap the beloved pooch of a gangster (Woody Harrelson), and Marty uses the ensuing events as fodder for his screenplay.

5108525,4,B007REV4LQ,"Colin Farrell, Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Tom Waits, Harry Dean Stanton, usually these actors are the most interesting performer on-screen at any given time. The fact that they the fact that they are all on hand in Seven Psychopaths, let's you know that straight away you are in for a treat

Coming from writer-director Martin McDonagh, whose great In Bruges was released a little over four years ago to great acclaim and a Golden Globe win for it's star, Colin Farrell, the star here. Seven Psychopaths has many of the same qualities as In Bruges, it is a clever and well written cross pollinated comedy and crime drama.

Taking a self aware approach to the art of moviemaking, it is set in the outskirts of the movie industry and it's lead characters are an actor (Rockwell) and a screenwriter (Farrell). The writer is working on a script cheekily titled ""Seven Psychopaths"", he needs to find said psychopaths so his friend places a personal ad that attracts at least one crazy (Waits) to him.

But he doesn't have to look far as psychopaths are all around him. First his buddy is running a dog kidnapping for profit scheme with an older man (Walken), who comes with a series of surprises. They unknowingly abduct the dog of a mobster (Harrelson) who will stop at nothing to get his four legged friend back.

Full of quirky and very funny situations that don't seem as if they will add up in the end, but they surely do. Where this picture is going is never clear, but it is a lot of fun getting there. It doesn't lead itself to the heights of In Bruges, but it comes mighty close. Using the same kind of violence and compassion laced with loads of humor, it is all played as a joke this time around, but still one with a lot ofv bloodshed.

Like Quentin Tarantino, McDonagh has an ear for clever witty dialogue. Also like Tarantino he takes a rather mundane, perhaps worn out premise and turns it inside out, finding knowledgeable new ways to tell an old story.

As a send of the movie industry, Seven Psychopaths has a  lot of fun attacking conventions and clich&eacute;s. It feels often like it is bound to loose it's self, but McDonagh has a good knowing directing style that helps keep everything in check.

And that cast, I don't know what more can be said for it except it is spot on for this sort of absurdist satirical movie. Not the funniest movie of the year, I still think Killer Joe was, still there are a lot of good laughs that come from the sharp words spoken by a quirky bunch you will not see this season. The whole cast is at the top of their collective game and Farrell has found a collaborator in McDonagh who works towards his strengths, something the big Hollywood productions like the Total Recall and Fright Night reduxes have not done.

An intense and refreshing movie, and there are so few of them released any more. Seven Psychopaths is a little gem that was sort of lost amongst the bigger more high profile movies of the fall. Now on blu-ray and DVD, hopefully this minor masterpiece will find the adoring audience that it most deserves.

Instead of revolving around the dog-napping business and teeing off a mob guy (Harrelson) the movie gets into wackiness and delves into Colin Farrell's screenwriting career and terribly tries to twist the ""real world"" scenarios into his writing of a screenplay called Seven Psychopaths.

The plot was brilliant. The script was pathetic. Yet, with some of Hollywood's finest talent, only the dog was funny. Perhaps because he didn't speak. If you are the type who finds any sentence funny, as long the ""F-bomb"" is the defining adjective, you will enjoy. Throw in some mild-altering chemical prior to watching and you will prob. love the movie. I watched because 1. Dogs Rule and 2. It received high scores from critics vs. avg 3 star review from the public. Keep in mind, many professional critics seem to always rate movies about ""screenwriters writing movies"" high. Throw in an ""alternative-lifestyle screenwriter writing movies"" and it's a ""F-bomb"" Oscar contender. I already know my comment will not please the P.C. crowd. But, what's P.C. one week, changes the next. I've yet to find the answer why the word ""God"" has been replaced with ""universe"" and people still say ""Oh my God!""

5108572,3,B007REV4LQ,"Martin McDonagh made his feature film debut when he wrote and directed the improbable hit man black comedy ""In Bruges"" in 2008. ""Seven Psychopaths"" bears his signature violence, political incorrectness, and dark humor. A mystery assassin known as the ""Jack of Diamonds Killer"" is running around Los Angeles killing criminally violent people. Meanwhile Marty (Colin Farrell), a frustrated screenwriter, is stuck partway through a storyline that was given to him by his friend Billy (Sam Rockwell), partner of Hans (Christopher Walken) in a dog-kidnapping racket. Billy and Hans steal dogs from rich people and return them for a reward. But this time Billy has kidnapped Bonny, a Shih Tzu belonging to Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson), a violent single-minded gangster who really wants his dog back...and who may have met his match in Billy.

McDonagh's films can never be accused of being hackneyed. This is a fresh, thoughtful, multi-layered satire. It's violent. It's very funny at times. But ""Seven Psychopaths"" is so thematically complex and reflexive that I often felt that McDonagh was overthinking the whole thing. Reflexive to the point of self-mockery, placing revenge narratives within revenge narratives, satirizing violent movies and their audience while exploiting them to make a point, the film is certainly clever. But perhaps it is more clever than good. Its comment on revenge is strange and a little inscrutable. Sam Rockwell plays Billy's crazy character to great effect. But the racial component is also strange, and the whole exercise is so crowded with ideas that it loses coherence. Sometimes McDonagh hits the mark with his brash dialogue. Other times, he falls flat.

""You're the one who thought psychopaths were so interesting. They're kind of tiresome after a while, don't you think?"" says Hans to Marty. And that is, ironically, the idea behind a film about seven psychopaths. Original and occasionally shocking, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is not for the easily offended. Unfortunately, it suffers from too much of a good thing, and a lot of redundancy, packed into a super-violent dark satire that gets unbearably serious at times. I love the cast, and they give some gutsy performances. Making movies about movies is always tricky, but stripping half the material out might have made a better film. There are no bonus features on the regular DVD (Sony 2013). Subtitles are available in English, English SDH, and Spanish.",1361750400,15,2444,5.264102564102564

There's no real point to the movie (except the lead character realizing he's a psychopath and essentially embracing that) but the characters are written well enough (with deep enough stories) that it doesn't really matter.  The movie is not about the movie (apparently) it's about the characters and their backgrounds and those stories are pretty interesting.

Fairly violent though if that bothers you.",1361577600,,519,5.4375
5108576,3,B007REV4LQ,"Two of my favorite actors Christopher Walken and Colin Ferrell but was disappointed in this movie. Saw a couple of clips before I purchased the movie and was expecting something totally different. I thought it was a comedy and although it had some humor in it,I didn't care for it.",1361577600,,281,4.64
5108577,3,B007REV4LQ,"Due in great part to the commercial adverts, I went into this thinking there would be a literal seven nutters carrying a multitude of high powered and/or bladed weapons in the mold of a Guy Ritchie-esque hardcore twisted comedy. Discovering that the plot revolved around three guys and a dog... well, it certainly wasn't what was being sold in the promotionals.

However, that said, once past fallen expectations I found myself slowly enjoying this quirky flick. The further along into the film, the better it got. Very much like my experience with 'Cloud Atlas'.

The Seven Psychopaths is the title of a proposed movie that a part-time screenwriter and full-time alcoholic is creating. Tired of the same ol' same ol', Colin Farrell's character, Martin, has a vision to do something completely fresh and original. Seven vignettes of various psychopaths, their lives and their deeds or misdeeds expressed on film.

Not a particularly original or novel concept; which was, apparently, the point.*

Marty's two best friends and would-be muses are Bill, a brash loudmouth wannabe actor who seemingly has no clue that he's an obnoxious windbag with serious anger issues. And Hans, the sweet old veteran of the team whose life revolves around caring for his cancer ridden wife. The two work as small time schlubs whose criminal endeavors are infinitely less impressive or fantastical - and unsuitable to be Marty's inspiration - pathetically going about stealing pet dogs and holding onto them for the reward money.

And as the screenplay moves along, Bill desperately attempts to interject himself into the creative process. The intimation being that he's an ego whore in constant need of reflective fame. But is that really what drives his insistent attempts to contribute to the script? Still, after sharing a particularly bizarre tale about a father and his murdered daughter, Marty decides that maybe he has something to offer after all and invites him to be a co-writer, much to Bill's everlasting joy and boundless enthusiasm.

An enthusiasm that will bring Marty closer than he ever wanted to his imagined seven psychopaths.

Like a pungent antisocial onion, each revelation exposes the increasingly freakish connections between the outrageous fiction of the screenplay and the real-life experiences of the characters we meet throughout the film. Culminating in a hilarious, if predictable finish, as the three friends stumble into their respective destinies.

If what I've read is true, then success of the film is found in spite of itself; less an accomplishment and more a pleasant surprise - likely to the filmmakers themselves.

*Apparently, this was Director Martin McDonagh's attempt at satirizing the American movie mythology; a deconstruction of our ""ideal"" film and its archetypes. If that's accurate, then he failed. 'Psychopaths' doesn't properly draw out the comical to an absurd effect. Instead, while exploiting the same content, the film doesn't extract itself from the repetitive retread themes and stock characters he's attempting to skewer. His movie fell into the same trap.",1361577600,,3096,5.26369168356998

That being said, Walken and Rockwell are fabulous, always the highlight of any movie for me. This was semi predictable, but I enjoyed it to the end. The best moments were the ones you could tell were ad-libbed and you could tell the director gave liberties to the actors to do so. That is what made this so good, and made you feel like you were hanging out with friends when watching it. The humor was perfectly interspersed with the tense moments, so that nothing overshadowed anything else.  I highly recommend this, and know you will be talking about it to friends and coworkers.",1361577600,,750,4.597014925373134
5108581,5,B007REV4LQ,"I LOVED this movie! This was the most hilarious movie I have seen in a VERY long time! I love Christopher Walken when he plays ""Quirky, Funny"" Characters, and that is the reason I decided to watch this movie.  As I suspected, Walken was Amazing as a 60 something ""Dog Kidnapper"" named ""Hans"" with a sad past and a challenging present. Hans was quirky, compassionate and a great friend to Sam Rockwell's Character, Billy.

Billy was an Actor who was having a tough time getting parts because of his temper. He was a longtime friend of Marty's, Colin Ferrel.  Marty was writing his new screenplay called ""Seven Psychopaths"" and was having a terrible time choosing the Psychopaths, and grappling with what kind of a message he wanted his movie to portray. Billy took it upon himself to ""Help"" Marty find the Seven Psychopath Characters and help write the plot of the movie, only after much discussion and arguing whether Marty wanted his help or not. Billy comes up with finding characters in some unconventional ways and hilarity ensues.

In the meantime Billy kidnaps his girlfriends,""Gangster"" boyfriend, Charlie's, (Harrelson) beloved dog. Charlie is crazy in love with his little dog and cares more for the dog than the humans around him. Harrelson plays this role of the ""Psychopath Gangster"" perfectly!  Charlie tells his goons to find the kidnapper and get his dog back, one thing leads to another and Charlie finds out Billy has his dog.

Billy, Marty and Hans go into the dessert to work on the ""Script"" and Billy tries to make Marty write the movie the way he wants it to be. There are arguments, alcohol, and peyote consumed, and things are revealed that Marty can't deal with. Billy doesn't want Marty to leave, so he makes them stranded out in the desert and he calls Charlie to tell him to come and get his dog. Billy leaves them with only one choice and that is to end Marty's movie his way.

Sam Rockwell stole the show with his hilarious portrayal of Billy! Colin Ferrel was a great ""Martin,"" as Hans would call him. Martin had his hands full with his friend Billy, and Ferrel did a great job of mixing comedy with humility throughout the movie. The three characters couldn't have been played by anyone else in my opinion!

The acting was SUPERB! This is a ""must see"" if you like to be thoroughly entertained and laugh out loud through a whole movie!",1361491200,,2365,4.668269230769231

5108594,5,B007REV4LQ,"This was a BRILLIANT movie. It was funny, thrilling, suspenseful, and dramatic. To be frank this isn't your typical run of the mill gangster/revenge/action flick. If you were expecting this movie to be solely about violence / vengence like ""Godfather"" / ""Scarface""/""Goodfella's"" and follow the formula of classic gangster films then you will definitely NOT like this movie. This is one of the movies that you will either love or hate. Despite what people may think, this movie isn't about vengence. It attempts to showcase the ludicrousness of violence, and the impact it has on everything (people, places, lives, etc.). Another thing that made this movie different was that it attempted to mock various genre's and break apart stereotypes. Some may not get the jokes, but others will. I for one, thought they were creative, witty, and clever. The characters were very interesting as well. They were decently developed and brought a great deal of intelligence, comic relief, and drama to the film.

Unlike product reviews, reviews of movies, music, etc. are very subjective in nature. My review below expresses MY opinion based on MY personal taste. I do not like crude, disgusting, sexual, drug related, etc. scenes UNLESS they add or are relevant to the plot of the movie. I find many movies, videos, music, today use obscene language, sexual references, etc. for Shock factor.

Crude and disgusting is all I can say. We stopped watching it after 35 minutes. I kept thinking it would get better but it didn't. The funniest parts were in the previews. Don't waste your money or time unless you like crude humor.

SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is a cleverly plotted film where nobody is who they appear to be and nothing quite goes as planned. It's a ""noir humor"" film in the same tradition as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fargo/dp/0571179630/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fargo</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Born-Killers/dp/B000HL093A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Born Killers</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meeting-Evil/dp/B007PYFH5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meeting Evil</a>, and takes the subgenre one step further by spoofing these other spoofs. Several interesting premise-characters here, including a psychopathic killer who only kills other psychopathic killers and a hack screenwriter (expertly played by Colin Farrell) whose constipated work-in-progress oddly coincides with his friends' and adversaries' own predicament. Oh, and let's not forget the ruthless cutthroat gangster whose beloved Shih Tzu's been kidnapped by the screenwriter's associates. Yep, many interesting characters and details of conflict: The deranged Vietnamese priest also deserves mention. The thematic dialogue carries a good bit of this film and, especially toward the end, is very original and quite amusing, though not in a truly ""lol"" sense of the word.

Copious amounts of schlocky blood and gore throughout. Also, while there's nothing inherentirely misogynistic about the film itself, the harsh, constant ""male-talk"" about women-in-general is not likely to resonate with many female audiences.

Yet, for all its colorful ideas and details, as well as some very effective satire of modern society, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS does not quite have the creative punch of other films of its type, including any of the three excellent works mentioned. It's entertaining and not entirely predictable, but it gets tiresome in places and always seems on the verge of derailment.",1360886400,,1995,6.908730158730159
5108623,3,B007REV4LQ,"This is a movie about a screenwriter and his dog snatching buddy that wants to be an actor, and also wants to be part of the writing team for his new screenplay called Seven Psychopaths.  Which is about seven psychopaths.  It gets interesting as fact and fiction get blurred is what your seeing real or is it part of the screenplay.
I was very mixed on my review of this film, sometimes the movie is really uneven, but when the movie is good it is really good. There are some great performances by Christopher Walken and Tom Waits.  Sam Rockwell is okay he just needed to get reigned in a bit his performance is kind of all over the place.  Colin Farell was the real let down, he's the lead, and I just didn't connect with him at all he wasn't really likable at all.

I will say this movie has one hell of an opening scene that really throws you into it, I only wish the movie could have kept up that pace and the dark comedy timing, but after that it kinda falls apart, it reminded me a lot of the movie Smokin' Aces, which I've grown to love over time, and this film could be the same but for now it's pretty good boarding on okay.

I laughed out loud three to four times, some of it's hard things to laugh about, the movie is basically about death and accepting it, not the funniest of subject matter and a hard sell for most people.

I'd recommend this movie to fans of Tarentino's work and fans of Smokin' Aces and Christopher Walken",1360886400,3,1438,4.226277372262774

5108638,2,B007REV4LQ,"Martin McDonagh's first film ""In Bruges"" about two inept hired killers went underground in Bruges, Belgian was brilliant, funny and violent with smart dialogue.
This time he rounded up a great cast again headed by Colin Farrell about a minor Hollywood screenwriter who got into a lot of trouble after unable to proceed
with writing a script, named:  Seven Psychopaths!
There were some stories within stories and some eye catching locations including, sunny Hollywood, Joshua Tree, etc. but with rampant killings.
Is it supposed to be a satire against Hollywood?  Are we really living in this crazy world with people killing each others like flipping a switch?
Where are the motives?  Where are the narratives that make any sense?  What is the point of this movie?
Once again, a great group of acting talent has been wasted by a poorly conceived and written script and an indulgent director.
From ""In Bruges"" to ""Seven Psychopaths"" is like going from top to bottom.

5108659,4,B007REV4LQ,"Seven Psychopaths is a hard film to review. To describe the plot details would be to ruin the film, plus-it's not the easiest film to really write a synopsis for. I'll try to keep it simple: Screenplay writer struggling to come up with a story for his latest movie gets help with the plot from a good friend of his, who also happens to be a dog nabber. One day he nabs the wrong pooch-a little shih tzu named Bonnie who happens to belong to a really dangerous guy. Stuff happens, bad stuff ensues. The name of the film comes into play throughout, but again, I won't spoil what each psychopath stands for. This film clearly wants to be comedic in nature, but it has quite a few dramatic moments that don't really feel out of place. There is LOTS of blood, gore and violence. Some of it almost seems for violence sake, but you get a sense of what this film will be like from the very first moments. Someone reviewed and stated it was 'all nudity'. I think I can maybe think of one scene in the whole movie that had any nudity and it really wasn't all that lurid. I don't know what that person was watching, but it wasn't this.

The movie looks great in Blu-ray and sounds great too. It's filled to the brim with great actors and each one brings their own thing to the table. Yes, some of it is overacting but here it works quite well. There are some twists and surprises, some a tad predictable, but I thought it was an interesting film. Not to be taken seriously. People who enjoy dark comedies, and don't mind violence will get a kick out of this. Again, a few people are complaining about a lack of plot. Not every plot has to be linear and full of thousands of details. I am usually pretty picky with films but couldn't really find anything major to complain about.

I've enjoyed Woody Harrelson, Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken in separate outings so this was a can't lose situation, I thought. I paid full price for this unfunny piece of crap and can't give it away to anyone I care anything about. It's a stupid waste of time and talent about a dognapping that leads to lots of senseless killings. I love action and good horror films but here, the kills are mostly played for laughs and it ain't funny. I also didn't get the out of place racial slurs which pretty much target everyone. Even sexual preferences are targeted on numerous occasions. Gabourey Sidibe is called fat at least 4 times during the 5 minutes or so she's on film and it's demeaning, not funny. Bottom line, Seven Psychopaths sucks and I'm not going near another Martin McDonagh film. He's trying to be Tarantino but needs to try something else.

It has a great cast, and they all play their roles well. No spoilers here, but I will say that the plot is fairly creative, although a bit clumsily executed and, maybe it's me, but there were certain parts I figured out in the first ten minutes. Still, it was nice to see how they combined all of these diverse talents into a watchable film. I won't go through the cast here, or what they did, specifically, because part of the fun I derived from this movie was how the cast was introduced, and how they fit into their roles. Suffice it to say that it's one of those rare movies of recent vintage that didn't make me question whether it was worth the rental price. Candidly, I'm not sure I'd pay to own it, but as a one-time rental on Amazon Direct (or if you can get it for $5), it's worth it. Fair warning: my wife did fall asleep within the first 15 minutes despite a fair amount of action and blood-shed.

Christopher Walken was finally allowed to come through near the end. Sadly we are left waiting to see the Woody Harrelson his fans all love.

Sam Rockwell might have toned it down a bit, his ranting caused the urge to flick off the flick repeatedly.

This is invariably a neurotic and narcissistic exercise, with very little to reward the viewer.  There is no real plot, because the point is that the writer is blocked and can develop one.  In this case, there is also precious little humor or action, and quite a bit of gratuitous misogynism.  Who can believe that losers like these would be paired up with beautiful woman that they treat like scum?  All in all, an offensive waste of time or money.  The high rating on Rotten Tomatoes must be because some critics are enamored of the intellectual exercise of playing with the film medium itself.

It was different and heralded a unique new sensibility on the cinematic scene.  ""Seven Psychopaths"" is no less audacious but may teeter a little by the weight of it's quirkiness.  The conceit here is Irish screenwriter, Marty(Colin Farell) is blocked in delivering a script to his employers.  He has a title, ""Seven Psychopaths"", and a concept of a Buddhist psychopath but nothing has been transferred from pen to paper.  Ironically a couple associates of his Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans(Christopher Walken) have kidnapped the beloved Shih Tzu of a psychotic thug, Charlie (Woody Harrelson).  Marty finds himself waist deep in psychopaths while he bounces ideas about the subject with Billy and Hans.  The film has an interesting structure but sometimes you think McDonagh may be biting off more than he can chew.  You know you're not in Kansas anymore when Christopher Walken is the most normal guy in the room.  That said the film leaves an impression on you that it may gain momentum on repeat viewings.

Everything goes well until he steals the dog of Charlie, a psychopath gangster (Woody Harelson). The movie takes off and there is a lot, ...and I mean a lot of blood and unnecessary killing with a lot of shots to the head. The opening scene is a total imitation of a Tarantino movie. But after that it fails miserably and we are in for a boring 100 minutes (this is a long time to wait to the end when you already know what is going to happen and that #1 is also #7). I think that Martin McDonagh should give up in trying to imitate Tarantino and get his own style.

One star because I have to give it something and also because of Christopher Walken. Nothing to see, nothing will happen...The movie is so predictable that I knew from the first five minutes who is #1 and what will happen to him.",1359849600,4,1270,4.239669421487603

5108771,3,B007REV4LQ,"Seven Psychopaths is from the same director who made the great 2008 film In Bruges. Unlike most Tarantino-rip off movies In Bruges actually had some depth to the usual hitman comedy schtick as well as well done dark humor and a nice plot that ties everything together. Seven Psychopaths on the other hand seems like the director threw darts at a chart with random things and scrambled to put it together. ""Ok I hit bunnies, gotta throw bunnies in there, ok I hit peyote, gotta throw that in there now"", and it all comes out rather bland.

The main problem I had with Seven Psychopaths was that it was predictable. You'd think with a name like Seven Psychopaths it'd be a free-for-all, but instead you can tell who the main character is, who's going to die, who you should feel sorry for, yadda yadda. Another thing is besides Sam Rockwell (who puts in another great performance), none of them seem all that crazy. Colin Ferrel is basically the same self-loathing drunk from In Bruges, Christopher Walken is just his usual hammy self with a 'dark past'. Woody Harrelson is basically an A-hole, and he was really underplayed in this. An ambiguously gay guy who loves his little Shih Tzu more than life itself, what does he do for a living? Why is he so obsessed with that dog? You never really know, you just know he's emotionally unstable. I know there could've been some good jokes from his past, but alas, another missed opportunity. The other three psychopaths are barely in the movie, you have LOLSORANDOM psycho with his pet bunny, and the two women who aren't seen after the first half hour.

Some things worked, some things didn't. I liked the set up of a few losers in LA stealing dogs then returning them for the ransom, clever idea. I liked how Colin Ferrel was trying to write a movie based off this movie, there were some good jokes in it, even though the meta-commentary is starting to get old in movies. But then you get stuff like when they took peyote, and it added literally nothing into the film.

Now I was a few whiskey's deep when I watched this, so it's more than likely that I missed some things, but in general the movie feels half-baked, like all the ingredients are there, but they're not used well. It was enjoyable enough to watch but overall a sophomore slump for director Martin McDonagh. My advice would be next time keep the story more contained.",1359676800,2,2377,4.575117370892019

But am hard-pressed to explain why.  I mean what, really, is funny or entertaining about kill-crazed psychopaths and spurting, gushing blood?  When one gets right down to it, not a thing.
But that fact serves as a testimonial to the brilliance, the genius, that was brought to the making of ""Seven Psychopaths.""  I found it to be a riveting laugh-fest.
Granted, for me it bogged down a tad in its last quarter or so.  But that, in a way, was a good thing.  It gave me time to catch my breath.
""Seven Psychopaths"" also features stellar acting.  Woody Harrelson was superb as one of the seven;  Christopher Walken also delivered, I thought, one of his best-ever performances; and what can I say about Sam Rockwell?  His work here should launch him as a major, in-heavy-demand star.
I do have one problem with this film, though.  As was the case with Freidkin's ""Killer Joe,"" I'm hesitant to tell various people I know how much I enjoyed ""Seven Psychopaths.""

5108800,5,B007REV4LQ,"Part Hollywood insider piece, part action parody, SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS comes out of the gate charging full-throttle.  Well, actually the opening scene features two hitmen talking about shooting people in the eyes.  We then seque into the story of three friends: struggling screenwriter Marty (Colin Ferrell); con artist loser Billy (Sam Rockwell); and spiritual, devoted husband Hans (Christopher Walken).  When the latter two kidnap the beloved dog of a mafia leader (Woody Harrelson), all three forced to run, heading toward that inevitable climactic shootout.

Martin McDonagh's previous effort, IN BRUGES, will probably go down as a classic.  SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS just might as well.  It's got a little more edge than BRUGES (more blood, too); parts of the film almost feel Tarantino-ish.  And yet, the film is wholly McDonagh's; never once does it feel like he's ripping anybody off.  In fact, his humor and parody are both spot-on, so much so that they come off as unique, even though they really aren't.

It doesn't hurt that he's assembled a great cast.  Farrell returns from BRUGES, doing his slacker charm thing (this is a solid performance, but far from his best).  Rockwell steals the show as Billy; he's comedic yet unstable, an unpredictable tour-de-force that helps cement the film together.  Walken brings a surprising depth to his performance, while Harrelson oozes menace while being absolutely hilarious.  The film also features fantastic smaller performances from a range of contributors: Harry Dean Stanton, Linda Bright Clay, Michael Pitt, Michael Stuhlbarg, Gabourey Sidebe, and especially Tom Waits as a rabbit-cradling lunatic.  SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, like its predecessor, features that ultimate trifecta in filmmaking: cast, script, and direction.

His friend Billy (Rockwell) tries to help motivate him to finish his film but Marty lacks motivation. He can't seem to get his thoughts straight enough to complete the screenplay so Billy (being the friend that he is) takes an ad out in the paper calling all ""psychopaths"" in to tell their story. In the meantime Billy and his friend Hans (Walken) have a scam going where they kidnap or ""borrow"" dogs then collect a reward when the return them. As it turns out they ""borrow"" the wrong dog and now a gangster named Charlie Costello is after them (including Marty) to get his dog back. Marty comes to a startling revelation about Billy and Charlie is STILL after his dog. With the chaos around him, Marty starts to question his screenplay and the direction to take with it.

Lately I've purposely been watching movies without watching trailers or reading a synopsis. I miss the days when you could watch a film and be completely surprised at the plot. This was one of those films. With a title like Seven Psychopaths I expected a bloodbath similar to Smokin Aces. I was so wrong. It turned out to be a story about a man at odds with himself and his story. Sure the film had some violence and shootouts but it felt like it was in the background of everything. It was mainly about him just trying to find inspiration and to write something that hadn't been done before. McDonagh brought the dark humor he did in In Bruges but with an action filled twist. I thought Colin Farrell was hilarious in this. Usually you think of him as a badass but in this film he was reduced to a kitty cat that seemed to be scared of just about everything and so unsure of himself. It really was a good change of pace for him and it shows his versatility. Walken was Walken. He usually plays the same type of character with the same comedic rhythm and timing but for some reason it doesn't get old. His role was in my opinion the most heartbreaking but even with the seriousness that it called for at times he still provided the one liners and idiosyncrasies that only he can bring to the table. Harrelson plays ruthless very well. Add dark humor to it and it makes for the perfect character in this film. To me, his attachment to his dog I found pretty funny and the way his gun keeps jamming throughout the movie. After watching the film twice I really do think they gave Rockwell some of the best lines and moments. It's funny that I'm even saying this but he played a psychopath with a heart of gold. The crazy things he did, he did them all to try to help a friend even if they were a bit maniacal. My complaint: I wish they would've given Tom Waits a bigger part. With his character I felt like there was a bigger story to be told there. (If) they make a sequel then I think that would be the perfect opportunity to explore his character more.",1359158400,,3084,4.468085106382978
5108804,4,B007REV4LQ,"Seven Psychopaths
is Martin McDonagh's follow-up to his quirky 2008 hit, In Bruges.  McDonagh is making a name for himself as his two films complement each other nicely and provide a roadmap for the type of director McDonagh aspires to be.  Like Tarantino or Hitchcock, McDonagh strives to make films about similar types of characters viewed through a similar societal lens.  Awareness seems to be McDonagh's trademark.  His characters are flawed, yet keenly aware of these flaws.  His scripts are dark, yet this darkness is carefully tempered by his films' awareness of the fact that they are films, as his characters are always interacting with the film industry in some way.  This awareness allows the viewer to enjoy his films on multiple levels, first on a narrative level and again on a satirical level that tries to provide commentary on humanity through the narrative.

In the case of Seven Psychopaths, McDonagh turns his focused lens on an unfocused, alcoholic screenwriter, Marty (Colin Ferrell).  Marty is struggling to write a film called Seven Psychopaths and turns to his friends and their acquaintances for inspirations on ways to characterize his seven different psychopathic characters.  What follows is a wild series of events that lead Marty down the literal Psycho-Path to self-realization.  As his characters become fleshed out, Marty starts to see that he's living a detached life.  His detached life is illustrated by the flaws of his screenplay.  Marty's writing is not authentic.  He borrows from other people's lives to write his characters, and his tragic personal life causes his women characters to be nothing but fragile stereotypes.  His relationship is in shambles, his inspiration is drying up, Marty is desperate for a motivation, and thanks to a mixed up con-gone-wrong by his dog kidnapping grifter friends, Hans and Billy (Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell), this motivation comes in the form of an LA underground gangster (Woody Harrelson) who is seriously upset about his kidnapped Shi-tszu.

Seven Psychopaths is a busy film and it is also McDonagh's most brutal.  There is so much going on that its stars only have a matter of minutes to shine.  Standouts are Rockwell and Walken.  Rockwell's Billy is a fast-talking idea man.  He's relentless and firing on all cylinders in every scene.  Walken plays Hans, who is much more relaxed than Billy, but equally fun to watch.  Walken is doing a Walken impression here, which is basically what people have come to want from him in this phase of his career.  Regarding its brutality, from the opening scene, the film's tone is quite clear.  While trailers might lead one to believe that the dog kidnapping plotline is central to the story, it is actually a very minor element.  The majority of the film's 109 minutes explores exactly what happens when the ""inmates take over the insane asylum.""  Desert shootouts, sadistic serial killers, and revenge killings pepper the action of the film.  Seven Psychopaths feels inspired by the independent films of the 90s.  As it unfolds, it is reminiscent of 1994s Floundering or 1995's Living in Oblivion not in plot (or in casting James LeGros), but in its meaning.  These films blend the effects of fantasy and reality in a compelling way, creating a very enjoyable movie.  If only James LeGros could have shown up as an eighth psychopath!  B+

5108805,5,B007REV4LQ,"SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS (2012) is a wickedly delightful, somewhat violent, black comedy, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, whose previous film was the equally wickedly delightful, if slightly less violent, IN BRUGES.

Colin Farrell, who also starred in IN BRUGES, plays an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who is having trouble formulating his current assignment, a screenplay entitled ""Seven Psychopaths"".  His best friend, a somewhat unstable actor (Sam Rockwell) with a penchant for punching out casting directors, realizes that Colin just needs some inspiration, so he makes it possible for him to meet some real psychopaths.

Sam's ""day job"" is that of a dog kidnapper.  He and partner Christopher Walken steal people's dogs, then return them for the posted reward.  Unfortunately, they make the mistake of snatching the pooch of a crazed gangster (Woody Harrelson), who will stop at nothing to get his beloved animal back.

SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is a film of multiple layers; therefore no written synopsis would do the twist-filled plot justice.  Certain scenes are set in the real world, while others are sequences from the ""Seven Psychopaths"" screenplay in progress as imagined by Farrell, or Rockwell or Walken, both of whom have been invited to collaborate on Colin's work.

Farrell is certainly a fine actor, but in this outrageously funny film he essentially plays straight man to Rockwell, Walken,  Harrelson and Tom Waits, all of whom, in this writer's opinion, should have been Oscar-nominated  for their portrayals of hilariously demented characters .

Martin McDonagh's deft dialogue is a laugh-out-loud riot.

Extras on the Blu-Ray and DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include six ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

It contains elements that are heart-breaking, gratifying, horrifying, and even excessively silly. A grab bag which is not going to appeal to everyone but left me feeling I'd seen one of the best movies of the year.",1358985600,,745,5.208333333333333

  'Seven Psychopaths' is by Martin McDonagh, an alleged 'noted' playwright turned screenwriter. A better appellation for Mr. McDonagh, would simply be, 'hack'. One can surmise that McDonagh's 'psychopaths', is an attempt to write some kind of farce or 'black comedy', satirizing hyper-violent action movies. McDonagh fails to grasp the mechanics of farce, in which you're permitted the outrage, without the consequences.

  One lame example of this, is the exploding head sequence. As it's a scene that's part of a fantasy, the exploding head is outrageous, but without consequences. Hence, it qualifies (barely) as farce. Not so the entirely tasteless scene, where Charlie guns down Hans' cancer-stricken wife, Myra, in the hospital. It's a scene that is outrageous in its cruelty and with consequences--within the context of the story, we have no reason to feel this event is amusing in the least. Han's passive reaction to the murder of his wife is perhaps also supposed to be humorous (in a passive-aggressive way), but I found the entire sequence involving the shooting of Myra, to be completely inappropriate, and indicative of McDonagh's complete misunderstanding as to how to craft a successful satire.

  The ugliness of McDonagh's humor (reflected in the Myra sequence) is borne out by Mike LaSalle's review in the SF Chronicle. He writes: ""In the end, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is an immersion in ugliness and violence, barely relieved by wit. It's not a comment on an ugly, crazy world, nor is it a response to an ugly, crazy world. It's just ugly all on its own - and not nearly as crazy as it should be.""

  There's also a sense that McDonagh wants everything, 'both ways'. As much as he seeks to mock the hyper-violent action genre, he is also seduced by it. Kenneth Turan writing in the LA Times senses this: ""Like screen writing Marty, who wants to pen a violent psychopath tale that is also life-affirming, this film wants to deliver genre satisfactions while simultaneously subverting them. It's a difficult maneuver, and ""Seven Psychopaths"" doesn't quite pull it off."" Ann Hornaday in the Washington Post also echoes McDonagh's infatuation with violence: ""But the film also begins to feel like a case of a director getting to revel in the very thing he's reviling."" Kevin Jagernauth, writing in The Playlist, agrees with the 'both ways' theory: ""Boasting lots of gun-play, a big extended cast of stars willing to play along and a less witty, broader sense of humor, McDonagh tries to have it both ways by playing to the cheap seats while pointing out how absurd it is at the same time.""

  The 'Seven Psychopaths' plot revolves around Colin Farrell's character, Marty Faranan, an alcoholic screenwriter, who suffers from writer's block, and only has gotten as far as composing a title for his next work. Marty's best friend, the unemployed actor Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell), suggests that he use the 'Jack of Diamonds' serial killer as his Psychopath #1 for the screenplay (it turns out later that Bickle is actually the Jack of Diamonds killer, a murderer who kills other killers). Not all the psychopaths are real life characters; Marty dreams up perhaps the only interesting character in his pantheon of killers--a Quaker who stalks his daughter's killer and in an O'Henry-like twist, drives the killer to suicide, and follows him to hell when he slits his own throat.

  McDonagh intentionally makes his characters as unlikeable as possible, including Bickle and Hans (Christopher Walken) who steal dogs from their unsuspecting owners, only to return them to collect the reward money. The break into Act II occurs, when Bickle and Hans steal a Shih Tzu that belongs to Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson), a sadistic gangster, whose bent on retrieving the pooch at any cost.

  If this isn't enough, Marty's ad in the paper for more psychopaths, brings Zachariah Rigby, who used to go around the country with a girl, Maggie, who he saved after she was imprisoned in a serial killer's basement. In true Tarrantino fashion, the couple are seen in flashbacks, going around the country, hacking the hands off notable serial murderers, including the Zodiac Killer. Zachariah has Marty promise that he'll place a notice in the screen credits at the end of 'Seven Psychopaths', so he may re-unite with the long lost Maggie.

  The denouement of 'Seven Psychopaths' occurs when Marty, Hans and Bickle drive out to the desert. In a completely absurd scene, Charlie, drives out alone to meet them, carrying only a flare gun. When Bickle shoots Charlie in the back, it looks like it's curtains for him, but in a short amount of time, Charlie reveals it's only a 'flesh wound' and Marty attempts to save him by driving him back to town.

  I won't go into the ending since by this time, we've long lost caring for any of the characters. McDonagh's idea of humor is to stretch both his characters and situations to the maximum level of absurdity. This strategy backfires, as we soon come to realize that it's not enough to offset McDonagh's guilty pleasure: the love of violence!",1358899200,11,5125,4.977725674091442
5108808,4,B007REV4LQ,"I saw this a few days ago and really enjoyed it. The trailer I think is a bit deceiving about what this movie is really about which threw me off a little bit for the first half of the movie. It's one of those movies you won't fully understand till about mid way through which I think is a good thing. I don't want to spoil too much about the movie but essentially it's about Colin Farrell's character writing a movie about Seven Psychopaths (Hints the name) and Sam Rockwell who kidnaps Woody Harrelson's beloved Shih Tzu. Somehow all of that stuff ends up being connected in an odd and interesting way.

Seven Psychopaths is a very enjoyable movie if you stick with it till the end. It may feel a little odd and all over the place when it first starts but it all starts making sense later on in the movie. Watch the film for yourself and see if you like it because it's a little different than a lot of movies out there.",1358640000,3,921,4.232954545454546
5108809,4,B007REV4LQ,"Marty (Colin Farrell) is a screen writer with writer's block. He is attempting to write a screenplay called ""Seven Psychopaths"" a grindhouse without any killing or grindhouse action. His friend Billy Bickels (Sam Rockwell) offers him ideas, which aren't exactly all fictional. Billy steals pets for a living while his partner Hans (Christopher Walken) takes them back for the reward. One of the pets he steals belongs to crime boss Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson). The tag reads, ""Return to Charlie Costello, or you wil f@#$ing die.""

All this is going on while a real psychopath is killing Charlie's guys. The movie includes parts of the screenplay which ties things together.

This is a smartly written grindhouse which satirizes over-the-top grindhouse scenes with big shoot outs and exploding heads. At one point Hans remarks, ""psychopaths get tiresome after awhile."" Actually they don't on screen. Great film for grindhouse/ Tarantino type fans. Good dialogue.

5108810,5,B007REV4LQ,"To borrow a term from the movie, it's got ""layers""! With a fantastically talented cast playing quirky and unique characters, Seven Psychopaths is indeed a wild ride. McDonagah has a way of keeping the mood light, despite some very violent scenes, making the movie enjoyable even while it's disturbing. Add to that the world's cutest Shih Tzu, and you have a potential cult-classic!",1358467200,,381,5.063492063492063
5108811,4,B007REV4LQ,"The same director and screenwriter who made IN BRUGES with Colin Farrell teams with him again in this film.  This time Farrell plays an alcoholic Irish screenwriter in Hollywood who gets the idea of writing a screenplay called SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS. There are many ironies waiting for him in tackling this screenplay as his good friend, played by Sam Rockwell, who seems normal, really is totally off the wall and up for anything.  Much as I liked Farrell, Rockwell almost walks off with the whole movie because he is so good as this off the wall character.

Christopher Walken costars with these two as an older friend. For a change, he seems normal in comparison to them. They increasingly draw him into the action and he gets caught up with the SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS screenplay as well.

Not to be left out, Woody Harrelson is the local crime boss who is distraught because his dog has been stolen. His dog, hilariously, is one of these toy Chinese breeds.  The dog stealer is Rockwell and, even better, the dog likes Rockwell better than Harrelson. Harrelson is alternately vicious and distraught over his lost dog.

I really enjoyed this film.  It was a very good evening's entertainment.  If you liked IN BRUGES, you will also like this.

5108812,1,B007REV4LQ,"You see the cast.  You know Walken is in there.  How bad could it be?  VERY bad.  To the point that you feel the people who made the movie have revealed more about themselves and how vile their thought process is than they intended.  Bad in a way that makes you sorry you gave up the time to see it.  And I am certainly capable of enjoying a bad movie.  This movie is not like that.

It's entertaining, even promising, for about 20 minutes.  From that point you are simply not watching a comedy, period.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  It is trying to be clever so hard it has back-sweats.  And there's lots of bad effort to steal from other movies that I'm sure the filmmakers thought this movie was going to resemble.  You can almost hear them in the pitch meeting saying that it's going to be just like FILL-IN-THE-BLANK.  There is an attempt at ""Snatch"".  Nope.  It uses self-reference, ""Adaptation"" style, to no effect whatsoever.  They're ripping off everyone from Tarantino to Coppola, all for naught.  The only interesting element is that the film confesses that it's going to disappoint you even as you're watching it degenerate.  ""Dark"" comedies still have to be funny.  At least a little.  If you watch this, when it ends you will sigh.  And hang your head a little.  And you'll think to yourself, ""Well, there's a hundred minutes of my life I will never see again...""

The story uses (mis-uses) some real world historical events in a manner than can only be described as shameful.  Really.  Seeing them utilized the way they are here only succeeds in making you want to take a shower. Additionally it demonstrates that the writer - who is Irish - does not have the faintest understanding of what these events mean to Americans.  And I want to be clear, none of these flaws are in and of themselves amusing.  You will not get a kick out of seeing the mistakes in tone and pace the way you can with some movies.  The effect here is more akin to seeing a bird with a broken wing; you wish all these actors had labored in a different project, and you especially come away with a stomach ache that Walken used some of his days being dragged through the mud on this project.  So to answer that question - NO it's not worth it because it's Walken.  You just feel bad for him, as he spits up the tripe composed by this bleary eyed and baffled writer and director.  To those comparing this in ANY way to a Coen Brothers film, SHAME on you.  I will promise you this, if you approach this trash expecting anything within a thousand miles of a Coen Brothers film you won't just be disappointed - you'll be angry.

So often the experience is one where you almost say out loud, ""No, I am not going to go there with you, you don't know what you're doing"".  Violence is expressed here in a manner that inadvertently tells you that this is what the people who made the film think of you.  That THIS is what they think YOU (Americans) enjoy.  How insulting.  Not just violence, but cruelty, displayed in a pointless callous way.  Women are especially disposable here, and again the film admits that.  Abbie Cornish is just wasted, and Linda Clay Bright is apparently only in the film to facilitate further audience abuse.  There is a reason this movie was so anticipated and was then a horrid flop; it is awful.  Just irredeemably AWFUL.  Watch and regret.  You have been warned.",1357862400,17,3380,4.4794745484400655
