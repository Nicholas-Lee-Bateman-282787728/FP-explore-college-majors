8121216,1,B000FDK75A,"Movie is good, but watch out for bad transfers.  Can't tell for Amazon's description who made this DVD.  The movie seems to be in the public domain, so anyone can burn the movie and sell it as a DVD.  This was recently shown on Turner Classic Movies and the transfer was pristine.  But the transfer on the DVD I got was unwatchable -- washed out and off-the-chart colors, fuzzy out-of-focus image, among other problems.  Amazon should indicate who made this transfer.",1506384000,,467,4.716049382716049
8121217,4,B000FDK75A,claude rains and marta toren were really good.  The plot was enjoyable.  Good movie.,1474243200,,84,4.928571428571429
8121218,5,B000FDK75A,"The picture Alfred Hitchcock never made! This is a overlooked forgotten classic film noir mystery type movie! I just watched this online and it's
one of my favorites now. Claude Rains is great as all of the cast in the movie. Written and Directed as well as any Hitchcock picture. It starts off
great and finishes great from beginning to end. I can't say enough how good this movie is better than Casablanca which I find not that great!
It's one of Rains best movies and one of the best film noir type movies you will find. I can't think how it could be any better.",1439596800,,565,4.339622641509434

8121220,4,B000FDK75A,"As The Paris Express or as ""The Man Who Watched Trains Go By"" (original title), this offering in the genre of realistic fiction is lightly peppered with a few shakes of unreality. Okay, it is flawed; then, so are some of the most lovable among us. An annual visit from the crazy uncle can be a treat if the uncle is amusing, and has a number of saving gracesas does The Paris Express.
Most of the storyline is feasible enough to want to overlook the parts that raise unanswered questions in the minds of those that cant help thinking critically. As to the acting, this is universally superb, as the cast is from top to bottom constituted of heavy hitters.
I saw this offering once, perhaps forty years ago and maybe longer; for whatever reason it periodically resurfaced in memory as a movie Id love to see again. It had that lingering effect on my psyche which certain movies work. Hence I have at last revisited these characters and the plight of one Kees Popinga (Claude Rains), and satisfied a recurring curiosity.
The Paris Express can be called a gem only by those with an abiding affection for an old piece of paste jewelry that got into their lives at some forgotten point and cannot be tossed.
For one movie-buff, those who (and for all the right reasons) write-off the plot as defective, likely never knew the delight of having a crazy uncle.",1407196800,,1352,4.567901234567901
8121221,4,B000FDK75A,"I happened to come across this film and being a fan of Claude Rains I just had to buy it. I just finished watching it and I must say i was really impressed. The picture quality isn't the best. It reminds my of TV picture quality from the 80's. Its not horrendous but it could have used some touch up. Now the story I thoroughly enjoyed. It was a great Noir""ish"" film with suspense and intrigue. Claude Rains plays a decent hard working family man who finds himself on the other end of a bad seed(his Boss). Eventually, his ""good deed attitude"" places him in a situation where greed pokes his ugly head upon him and being a weak man he is taken over. I won't ruin the plot for anyone, but I will say it was entertaining, suspenseful and rather enjoyable. Claude Rains plays a good ""bad"" guy. I do recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys the old black and whites.",1371254400,,864,4.306748466257669

8121223,4,B000FDK75A,"Claude Rains is a mild-mannered bookkeeper and family man in small town Holland. Most nights after dinner, he watches trains go by, wondering which pleasures await passengers at their destinations. One night, he sees his employer Herbert Lom say goodbye to young and beautiful Mrta Torn. On another night, he chances upon his boss emptying the safe (Rains has invested all his savings in the century-old firm) and follows Lom, who is leaving town. He tries to recover his investment, the two men struggle and Lom falls into the water. Rains boards the Paris Express with the money and seeks for the intriguing Torn. Meanwhile, police inspector Marius Goring, who has been investigating the employer, is on his trail.

Claude Rains, as always, is brilliant as the gentle ""Man Who Watched the Trains Go By"" (the Georges Simenon source novel) as are Marius Goring and Herbert Lom. Mrta Torn, who played several women of mystery in her too short career (she suddenly died at age 31), is a true femme fatale in this film, glorious in Technicolor. It is also intesresting to see how early 1950s Paris looked like. The transfer to DVD, while not the very best, is fine. Highly recommended to fans of film noir and suspense.",1213833600,9,1216,4.818181818181818
8121224,5,B000FDK75A,"This film, made in 1952 in technicolor, was not a big success when it came out. It's a sad, action-packed, romantic drama, but still has a sense of the macabre and is almost a noirish film. Its a great film, and unfortunatlet the print on this isn't the best, but it's something. And of course, this founded that really annoying form of music you'd hear in 1950's-1990's british TV shows. A classic example is Mr. Bean. You cold say that this film is a landmark film for its time.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

PS Also with the cover art, it has a picture of Claude Rains and the female star, Marta Toren. The words Paris Express are upo the top and from first look you think, ""Oh great, another low budget, cheap DVD, just slapped on to a disc and not even restored."" Although this one may look low budget, thats just the cover art, the picture (although not restored) is still very good.",1208304000,6,899,4.2823529411764705
