8246901,3,B000FO0ALK,The narration for the EUROPE EPOSIDE IS MISSING and the show is generated more towards children .My biggest problem with this DVD is it is double sided which I hate. Information on each animal is very basic. Otherwise its not to bad for content. Good clear pictures.,1373846400,,266,4.680851063829787
