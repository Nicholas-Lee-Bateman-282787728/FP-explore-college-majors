8089362,5,B000BMWPTQ,"I'm using an old CD-ROM version of this right now.  If you follow their directions, your eyesight can definitely improve. Opthamologists and optitions have ALWAYS fought hard against Bates or Bates-derived exercises. Their argument that the shape of your eye is immutable is a lie--in fact, you CAN change that shape if you exercise muscles around the eye that habitually pulled or slackened to cause your eye to change its shape over the course of your life. I know an older woman who was almost legally blind, who did these exercises faithfully for a month and DID put away her glasses. She also faithfully did them once a month to recondition her vision, and stayed 20/20 or so for many years. So now I am doing these exercises to not need stronger reading glasses, and perhaps not need them anymore...I will check back in at the end of the month to add to this review.",1466035200,3,872,4.625806451612903
8089363,5,B000BMWPTQ,"I bought the entire version with all VCR tapes, audio CD, booklets... Review is for the tapes, DVD and booklets. VCR tapes would not open. Might be the old VCR I bought.  I think the book, audio tapes are the same. I could see of the VCR videos on the DVD.

There is some good training in this course; it can improve the clarity of vision.

The course was advertised on TV years ago. I remember thinking; the eye doctors, eye surgeons who prefer to sell eyeglasses, eye surgery, eye drops, contact lenses and drugs will probably try to stop this course from being sold to the public. In 1993 an eyesight teacher and invention patent business owner told me; ""If you teach this Natural Vision Method, you must be careful to not advertise on TV.., because the method works and you will be attacked and brought to court by the corrupt businesses that prefer to sell glasses, contacts, surgery, drugs...""
It seems that this is what happened to the See Clearly Method teachers. They were forced to stop selling their product, advertising on TV. (Don't know if they can sell on the internet...? These might be used copies, but I see many listed as new.)

I found some things in this course I do NOT advise doing. Things that are not natural, not true Natural Vision Improvement. Maybe these are the things organized individuals/businesses used against the See Clearly Method to force them to stop selling it.

Some of the beneficial things taught in this course are;

Looking at objects at a close and far distance that are in line with each other. Often it can quickly improve the vision. This is a secret that expensive dishonest vision teachers (selling via telephone, Skype.., or high priced books) do not want you to know. The authors (they are eye doctors) also mix in central-fixation (centralizing), but they list it under a different name. They say to look at the smallest details on the close and far object (one object at a time) that you are able to. This is a practice taught by Ophthalmologist Bates. It is the use of the central field; seeing best in the central where you are looking.  The authors need to describe more about central-fixation and give credit and access to Dr. Bates discoveries, works.

Course should also emphasize how to look at close, far and middle distance objects with one eye at a time, and to do extra practice to improve an eye that has less clear vision. This often brings instant clarity. Children learn very fast.

They also advise looking at the nose, then to a far object. With breathing. Shifting should be added to keep the eyes relaxed.

Shifting should also be described in detail. The closest they seem to get to shifting description, training is to provide a chart with zigzagging lines on it with many dots on the lines. The person moves from dot to dot along the lines. This CAN help loosen up the eyes, eye muscles (relax them), get the eyes moving shifting. They do mention to outline objects, look at small parts, move to other small parts. But complete shifting is not described. There are 3 charts, each smaller. This is good! It activates smaller and tiny eye shifts saccades and central-fixation (centralizing). This produces very clear vision when done with relaxation.

True eye shifting is done this way; just move your attention on a object from one small part to another, another, another... Blink. The dots on the zigzag lines chart is a good idea! It induces central-fixation (centralizing=central-fixation with shifting).

Another practice; move a object close, far as you look at it. The booklet should also state to move shift your visual attention on it. That keeps the eyes, vision relaxed.

Many of these practices include relaxed and deep breathing; this is good! Brings more relaxation, oxygen to the head, eyes.

Tracing on the edges of a object or sentences, words. Good!; is another way to induce shifting and relaxation when looking at something blurry. Shifting on smaller and smaller parts of objects; good! Is central-fixation. I wish the authors would give credit to Dr. Bates for this. Central-fixation is one of his main practices. Along with shifting.

They have a chart covered with words in 3 sizes going smaller and smaller. This is a good idea! The tiny letters induce tiny saccadic eye movements shifts and central-fixation. And the student is taught to trace around the words; induces shifting. Blinking, breathing included.  The words are familiar objects; easy to see. This prevents effort to see, prevents squinting, strain.

Acupressure section. Has many of the main eye acupressure points and directions are complete.

Palming is taught; a way to cover the eyes and relax the mind, body, eyes. Good instructions. The left and right hands have the fingers crossed on the forehead. This is the BEST way to palm. It keeps the hands, arms, shoulders, neck, head... relaxed. Thus relaxation travels to the eyes.
A thing the authors missed; The right hands fingers should be on top of the left hands fingers. (This is a left, right brain hemisphere activation/integration thing.) Use of the memory, imagination with positive happy thoughts should also be taught. Seeing black should be described, as taught by Dr. Bates. Black is seen when palming, when the visual system is perfectly relaxed.

Light therapy; good. But pure full spectrum sunlight is best and should be emphasized. Artificial light is less effective and not completely healthy.

Course includes music and a timer for each step. Positive inspirational encouragement throughout the book, tapes.

States; people usually see vision improvement in about 2-3 weeks.

Extra short tape for childrens parents; optometrist 18 years practice and other optometrist 40 years practice encourages them; states children can learn good visual habits that give a lifetime of clear vision. Says it is every mothers right for her child to NOT wear glasses.

Some of the things in this course that can impair the vision and things that are taught wrong or partially wrong are;

AVOID this!; Eye (clock) rotations, eye rolls, eye, eye muscle stretching; to look far to the left, right, up, down... stretching the eyes, eye muscles. Done with the head/face not moving with the eyes. This is NOT true eye shifting. It can strain, sprain the eyes, eye muscles and impair the vision, eye movement. Some people have gotten torn vitreous, other eye problems from this unnatural practice.

A healthy alternative is; to move shift the central vision along the lines of a astigmatism eye chart. The head/face moves with the eyes, in the same direction. Look directly at the lines, one at a time and move along it. There is NO stretching, pulling... of the eyes, eye muscles! The eye movement is completely natural; just tracing on/along the chart lines. The head/face moves with the eyes (central field) to prevent eye, eye muscle, head, neck tension, stretching, strain. To perfect the use of the central vision. All is done nice and easy, relaxed.

Fusion chart. See my other reviews. I warn against this unnatural practice. It is also called; Artificial 3-D, auto-stereograms, magic eyes pictures, and goes by other names. It involves placing 2 pictures in front of the face, one on the left side, one on the right. The eyes are crossed or uncrossed to look before or beyond the pictures to make them merge into a 3rd image that appears to be in the central field. But it is not. You are not looking at the distance it is at. This strains the eyes, eye muscles, visual system and strains/confuses the brain, left and right hemispheres, visual cortex and eye muscle and retina nerves. It can CAUSE crossed, wandering eyes and double vision, blur, astigmatism.

Dr. Bates cures strabismus with natural methods. He does NOT use the Artificial 3-D.

In some cases a HONEST, experienced eye doctor can apply this method a very specific way for a specific individual case of strabismus to alter the brain, visual system in a certain way to cure the strabismus. It needs expert application. But; its best to use natural methods FIRST! Only an eye doctor, in his/her office should apply this.
There are also dishonest eye doctors that teach it wrong, impair the patients eyes, visual system. Or; do it partly right, then teach it partly or fully wrong to keep the patient from obtaining a complete cure, thus going to the doctor for endless treatment.

Hydrotherapy; AVOID THIS. Authors tell the reader to apply a hot wet facecloth on the closed eyes. Then alternate with a very cold facecloth, then hot, then cold... This is unnatural. The eyes need to have the TRUE body temperature to stay healthy, function correct.

Fast and slow blinking; I like the part about also looking at small details of objects while blinking and with relaxed breathing. This improves the vision. But; the fast, slow blinks are unnatural.
Just blink naturally; watch a child or adult that has clear vision, relaxed eyes, no glasses. They blink normal, relaxed, soft, easy.

Squeeze blinking; Avoid it. Its unnatural. Do not squeeze the eyelids shut. It causes tension in the lids, face, neck, head and eyes.

Authors also have a book. I 'think' this is it; Improve Your Vision Without Glasses or Contact Lenses
See my review for that book. Things I like, agree with. Some things I do not recommend; http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DWDRYB963TTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684814382 They need to learn the entire natural method.

The TRUE original natural method was discovered by Doctor (Ophthalmologist) William Bates. Many people selling this method do not give him full credit, and often hide his work because it is 100% effective and free. His books, articles, work... are preserved free on the internet and ophthalmology, optometry college libraries; http://www.amazon.com/Method-Better-Eyesight-Without-Glasses/dp/0805002413/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1465220609&sr=1-1&keywords=bates+method

I like this teacher, author; http://www.amazon.com/Relearning-See-Improve-Eyesight-Naturally/dp/1556433417/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1465221940&sr=1-1&keywords=quackenbush

YouTube has some of the See Clearly Methods videos from the VCR tapes. I like the looking at close and far objects while shifting in a relaxed way on small parts of the objects. Such a simple easy method that improves the vision.

Now that you know what this course is about; I endorse the many good parts. 5 star, recommend.",1465171200,6,10648,5.191365227537923
8089364,5,B000BMWPTQ,"I have read ""Improve Your Vision"", by Dr. Beresford and his colleagues and followed their directions - just a bit - for the past 6 months or so. I know their physiology and their exercises are sound. I know that my own vision is measurably better, 5 years better, as a direct result of using their exercises only irregularly. I am getting more regular, that's for sure.

As a doctor myself, when first reading their book I recognized the profound validity of their fundamental principle: vision, like much of our health, is primarily a matter of movement and mindful habits.

I am just in the process of buying another 2 copies as give-aways for friends and loved ones.",1453766400,4,669,4.661016949152542
8089365,5,B000BMWPTQ,"While I have not purchased this particular audio cassette for myself (I'm a millennial and don't use audio cassettes) I must write a review to counteract the negative ones left here that refer to a lawsuit claiming that this method is fraudulent.

My paternal aunt used the See Clearly Method, along with reading books by Dr. Bates and others, to understand her vision and improve it.  She was severely nearsighted, at -6.00 in both eyes, and with a stigmatism, and was able to reduce her prescription to near perfect vision (I think 20/40?) - she doesn't need glasses to drive!  This is even more incredible to me given that she is started this in her 60s and is now in her 70s.  I am 25 and have -5.75 and a stigmatism in both eyes, and I have finally said enough is enough with relying on crutches (glasses) for the rest of my life.  Hence, I'm here on Amazon, looking up the See Clearly Method.

I've seen this work.  I don't know the details of the lawsuit, but I'd suggest that the point to take away from this is that it perhaps just didn't work for those people (and that is true for most kinds of life improvement changes).  But it worked for my aunt and I hope it will work for me.",1451606400,5,1191,4.333333333333333
8089366,5,B000BMWPTQ,"I wondered why this product was no longer being offered, because it is absolutely genuine. I'd forgotten to exercise my eyes until my eyes started getting weaker.  I pulled out my book and CD-ROM and began doing the exercises again, and sure enough, my vision started improving the very same week.  From now on, I'll remember to do the exercises faithfully.  It's not a good thing to give a bad report about something just because the media blasted it.  We need to think for ourselves, and prove things out for ourselves.",1446336000,11,521,4.6923076923076925
