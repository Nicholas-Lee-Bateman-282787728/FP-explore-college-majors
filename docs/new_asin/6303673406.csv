7855176,5,6303673406,"Mighty Space Miners is a great example of science fiction anime.  The story is about a boy growing up on an asteroid mining colony who is about to get his pilot's license when disaster strikes.  It was very thoughtfully done with attention to such details as gravity (or lack thereof) and physics in space, as well as character development, etc...  Unfortunately I've been waiting for about a decade to see this on DVD, and it hasn't happened yet.  Also, the movie doesn't end.  At a certain point it just stops with the fate of the asteroid mining crew and the people back on Earth hanging in the balance.  I'd love to see how the story ends some day and I'd love to see it on a more permanent sort of storage medium than low resolution VHS tape.",1230768000,,747,4.416058394160584
