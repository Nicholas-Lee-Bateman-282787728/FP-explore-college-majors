2670360,5,B000JEUT12,"Dr. O'Bryan's heavily referenced, easy to follow research overview is crucial to grasping the scope and severity of gluten sensitivity including neurological issues.  It extends far beyond celiac disease and is literally a safety requirement in the investigation of gluten sensitivity and celiac disease.

This seminar provided our family with fresh, little known insight in our  diagnostic journey. Our NON celiac daughter's serious and prolonged reactions to a gluten challenge finally made sense.

Sueson Vess's presentation of the gluten free casein free diet is encouraging,empathetic and doable. Her guidelines and research based meal balancing suggestions for blood sugar control clearly address the practical aspects of this lifestyle.",1161216000,25,743,5.91588785046729
8150102,4,B000JEUT12,The first part is very interesting; but later it gets too technical for me and it's not informative.,1422144000,,100,4.611111111111111
8150103,5,B000JEUT12,"I feel so fortunate having learned from Dr Tom O'Bryan! Fate connected me year 2013 with a free online webinar organized by him, where I listened with 200 000 people from all around the world, learning over the span of 8 days from medical professionals about gluten and its impact on health. It changed my life! I then ordered this excellent video (and also another video, Identifying and conquering gluten sensitivity inside and outside the gut, with 3 cd's, on his website, [...]). I admire Dr O'Bryan for his broad knowledge and all the international travel he does, educating ppl in other parts of the world. I now understand the difference between the industrial so called gluten free products and why they don't always help, b/c although they are free from gluten in wheat, they still contain gluten in the pseudo flours they are made of, and the difference between these and home made gluten free bread or cookies or pizza is like day and night. I never buy the industrial products, I only eat my own food. I do not miss store bought bread, with or without gluten. I do not suffer from celiac disease, I have not been diagnosed by any medical doctor, I just felt overall miserable and stopped eating gluten and when I did that, all subtle gastrointestinal and other problems like gas, bloating, feeling irritated, having freequent headaches, just not thriving, disappeared, and I now feel like new born! I obviously have the so called gluten intolerance, where gluten can cause chaos anywhere in the body, leading to several different health issues. My doctor didn't posses an enough open mind so I never bothered to test myself for gluten. I know I feel better now and that's all that matters to me. I don't need it in writing from a doctor. But those who do want to test themselves to have it in writing, Dr O'Bryan has several labs recoomended on his website and at the end of this video. I recently also stopped dairy which Dr O'Bryan also talks about, as Dr Mercola does (my other ""guru"", mercola.com). And I stopped sugar. I have done a lot of diet changes, from vegan to Paleo. It has been a challenging journey, but I feel happier now. I also feel angry when I see how stubborn ppl are regarding their health, how they would rather poison themselves with wrong foods and live sick, running from doctor to doctor, spending money on pharmaceutical drugs which only makes them more sick, and then die early, instead of changing diet!!! It is so insane! If you are going to change the foods you eat, pls understand that a new flavor needs to be ingested during 7 different occasions for the taste buds to accept it as familiar! Give new taste a chance! Good luck everybody! And spread the word! We all need to help each other!",1403481600,2,2737,4.62217659137577
8150104,5,B000JEUT12,This is an eye opening subject. Very well presented. A must see for everyone no matter if you are celiac or not. Good luck on your journey.,1392336000,,139,4.185185185185185
8150105,5,B000JEUT12,If you want to know about gluten free - you will find this fact filled.  This guy is passionate and knowledgeable.,1363046400,,114,4.428571428571429
8150106,5,B000JEUT12,"I wish more doctors would understand the connection between wheat and medical concerns!  Why is it not common practice to look at what we eat first? I am so sick, literally, from so many ""doctors"" seeing me for 5 minutes and prescribing antibiotics vs. getting to know me.  This DVD opened my eyes to improved health and how our food is harming us.  This is a must for anyone who cares about their health!",1357344000,3,405,4.445945945945946
8150107,4,B000JEUT12,"This DVD was recommended to me by my naturopath.  It is very informative, but he repeats himself A LOT and that makes it very slow.  I wish he would just get to the point sometimes.  Also, the first copy I received was distorted, as someone else reviewed - the timing was off, there were strange lights/colors on and above his head, and the charts were unreadable.  I exchanged it and the second copy I received (very quickly) was the same, so it must have been taped badly.  Still, because the information is so good to have, I am keeping it and plan to share with my chiropractor.",1325980800,2,582,4.401869158878505
8150108,5,B000JEUT12,"I credit this DVD for setting me on the path to true health. Dr. O'Bryan's knowledge and the information he offers here is extensive and mind-opening.  I purchased this because of a gluten sensitivity, but at the time I was unaware of just how pervasive and detrimental this sensitivity (even though it is not classified as true celiac disease) could be.  Dr O'Bryan cites numerous medical studies and explains the many facets of this issue.  Many people are unaware that symptoms of gluten sensitivity may be entirely unrelated to intestinal distress.  Gluten sensitivity can harm any part of or system in the body, and will primarily affect the weakest or most vulnerable areas, whether it is the liver, heart, nervous system, etc.  People with various health problems can often trace the origins to gluten intolerance, and even a tiny amount of gluten in the diet increases risk of disease and even death by various related conditions.  Therefore, it is very important to understand this issue and become educated in proper treatment and avoidance of gluten.  Dr O'Bryan also educates doctors and health practitioners in this area, since so many are unaware of the ubiquitous role gluten can play in the disease process for so many people.  Many doctors are unaware also of the most accurate tests for gluten sensitivity.  There are numerous aspects of this subject which people need to become much better informed about order to improve quality of life, and recover their health.  This DVD is a great start, and offered me more crucial information than I previously found from any other sources.",1324339200,8,1599,5.0
8150109,1,B000JEUT12,"This video was all distorted. I could not make out any of the words on the grafts and charts.
It was a terrible copy....I plan to return it.",1321747200,,140,4.035714285714286
8150110,5,B000JEUT12,"This DVD of Dr Tom Bryan delineating the effects of gluten on celiac and gluten sensitive people is packed with information and references obtained from widely accepted scientific publications...this is not one person's opinion or spin on a very important topic.

Dr Bryan clearly shows how the effects of gluten are global in the body and not just confined to the digestive tract as one might have previously believed.

Questions remain to be answered concerning why so many people are now being diagnosed with gluten or grain sensitivities compared to years past.

If you suspect you may be gluten sensitive or a true celiac case, go off gluten (found in wheat, rye, barley)for 90 days and see if it makes a difference...as of today, no one has been made worse by giving up gluten-containing foods.",1308096000,4,800,4.911111111111111
8150111,5,B000JEUT12,"This is a DVD worth watching, especially for new Celiacs like me -- I became even more vigilant about staying away from wheat in any form. It would be an eye-opener for people with unresolved health problems. Its extensive research references clearly show a world-wide concern about the effect of Celiac disease beyond digestive problems.

I loaned the DVD to my chiropractor who was extremely impressed with Dr. O'Bryan's new information as well as Susan Vesss's creative and delicious menus for Celiac's. ( I strongly agree!)

Dr. O'Bryan is my nutrtionist.  He helped me find out that I am a Celiac. I appreciated his well- presented extensive information on this DVD.  I'd like to suggest that another shorter DVD be made specifically for non-Celiac persons. It could make a big difference in helping those in need.",1171238400,16,819,5.0
