8024721,3,B00029KRZW,"Psycho II & Psycho III

This set of DVDs has two movies based on the 1959 movie Psycho. It was a big hit, but seems tame by later standards. The carefully edited scenes suggested more than what you saw. One scary part was the sound of a knife blade piercing flesh. But a butcher knife is designed for cutting or slashing, it lacks a hilt to prevent the wielders hand from sliding down the sharp blade and getting cut. Why would a horror film be so successful? Some say a recession or depression creates a market for horror films (as with the current Great Recession or depression). These films star Anthony Perkins, who plays the part of a crazy maniac very well.

Psycho II from 1983 shows Norman Bates released from a state hospital because his psychiatrist says he is cured. [No mention of politics cutting the budget so inmates are released earlier, or the use of drugs to control his condition.] Will Norman still obey his mother?

Psycho III from 1986 shows Norman Bates again returning home after many years. Not much has changed, for better or worse. They show parts of older movies as a reminder. You know what is going to happen, but there will be one or two surprises. Note how people who do wrong wind up getting killed, like in some classic mystery novels.

You should see the original 1959 Psycho as a background and a story about madness. This movie mentioned that the new highway bypassed the motel and caused a loss of customers. Does poverty cause an increase of violence, crime, and mental illness? So who benefits from these conditions?",1501200000,,1556,4.606498194945848
