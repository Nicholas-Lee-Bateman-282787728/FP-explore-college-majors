489719,3,6302610575,"Darkest Africa is noteworthy as it is the very FIRST serial produced by the newly formed Republic pictures.  The jungle theme would become one of the most popular settings for serials and Republic would visit it many times.

Darkest Africa is a 15-episode serial in which Clyde Beatty, King of the Jungle, goes to darkest Africa to rescue the Goddess of Joba, who is being held by the high priest.

Beatty is a capable hero and surprisingly, the action moves at a pretty nice pace.  The action sequences are will done and the supporting cast of no-names performs quite well.  Republic obviously had a tiny budget on this one but did everything they could to give it an expensive look.

The set pieces and ""special effects"" are really pretty decent given the time-period and budget.  The sound is not the best, particularly the music but again you might chalk that up to the time period.

Not one of Republics best, but a good start for them.",1101168000,6,941,4.626506024096385
489720,5,6302610575,"I've just seen the serial film Darkest Africa and I loved it. If you think that it was made in 1936 , with all dificulties then existing, the flying bat man, The Goddes of Jobba and the performance of the main star Clyde  Beatt you must consider that the result is excellent. I expected to see  something extremely naive ...on the contrary, revisiting my past (because  the first time I watched the film I was 10 years old) I was pleasantly  surprised with a very well realesed serial motion picture. Last but not  least - the copy is excellent. I recomend.",947116800,15,557,4.475247524752476

BIOS:

1.  Clyde Beatty

Date of birth:  10 June 1903 - Bainbridge, Ross County, Ohio

Date of death:  19 July 1965 - Ventura, California,

Special footnote, Clyde Beatty, was a big game hunter who became famous as a

lion tamer and animal trainer. He was the first lion tamer to be featured in a circus.

Eventually, he became a circus impresario who owned his own show.

Beatty became famous for his ""fighting act,"" in which he entered the cage with wild

animals armed only with a bull-whip and a pistol strapped to his hip. The act was

designed to showcase the five & a half-foot tall Beatty's courage and mastery of the

wild beasts, which included lions, tigers, pumas, and hyenas, sometimes brought together

all at once in a single cage in a potentially lethal combination. At the height of his fame,

the act featured Beatty solo, in a cage confronting 40 snarling, roaring and caterwauling

lions and tigers of both sexes.

7828751,4,6302610575,"Some time in the late forties, when Saturday movies lasted 4 hours, I saw the first 14 episodes of this serial.  It was already dated when I saw it, but the impression it made was indelible.  The fantastic flying Batmen of Africa and the weird siren sound they made still lives in my dreams.  In the ninties I taped the composite movie version, ""Batmen of Africa"" off TV and found out what happened in the last episode (I was sick with something I couldn't sneak out of the house with and missed it), a resolution to a mystery I couldn't remember by that time.  There are a number of elements in this series that defy explanation, not the least of which is a boy sidekick who seems remarkably ape-like.  Weird!  But the feel is still the same: adventure, challenge, courage and indominability.  Stand up and face it!",1149724800,,816,4.510204081632653
