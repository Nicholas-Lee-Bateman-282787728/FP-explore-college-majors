1190844,2,B00000657W,"Downhill Racer is essentially, a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences. Although there is a story here, Robert Redford's character, a skier trying to make the U.S. Olympic team, is so bland and unsympathetic  that you wonder why to care about him at all. Gene Hackman, in an early  performance, adds nicely, but this is a film that could be watched with the  sound off, and it wouldn't make much of a difference.",963792000,3,426,4.578947368421052
1190845,5,B00000657W,"As a former ski racer myself, I can assure you that ""Downhill Racer"" captures the essence of the sport perfectly. From the dated ski equipment and race sequences to the European ski resorts, from the edgy camaraderie of the skiers to their common goal of winning in this most individualistic of sports, ""Downhill Racer"" is right on target. A good skier himself, Redford did many of his own action scenes and seems to have an intuitive understanding of the ski racer psyche.
The stark scenes in Redford's hometown of Idaho Springs, Colorado contrast with the glitz of the glamorous European ski resorts where he races. His old cling-on racer-chaser girlfriend at home is the diametric opposite of the manipulative viper he meets in Europe. Redford is a misfit loner trying to succeed in an alien world, and he knows it. Gene Hackman plays the U.S. Ski Team coach perfectly, balancing his business role in raising money and reassuring nervous sponsors with his job of babysitting the prima donna Redford. After Redford wipes out in an important race and starts to make excuse to his coach, Hackman cuts him down with a classic speech (""the bumps took you out..."").
I think there are several basic genres of sports films. First, you have the overblown epics like ""Rocky"" and the romantic comedies like ""Bull Durham"" and ""Tin Cup."" These are essentially Hollywood efforts that just use sports for big Box Office. Then, you have parables like ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Field of Dreams"" and ""The Natural,"" and those that are more overwrought, such as ""Pride of the Yankees,"" ""Knute Rockne"" and ""Fear Strikes Out."" Finally, there are your nitty gritty slices of sports realism... ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" and ""Downhill Racer."" As a low budget, unpretentious film from thirty years ago, ""Downhill Racer"" remains a classic of its genre.",945388800,54,1857,4.97427652733119

1190875,5,B00000657W,"Robert Redford is not exactly ""the good guy"" in this film.
He is skier David Chappellet, bent on winning the big races that will put him in place for the Olympics. His problem is he is a self-centered know-it-all and doesn't have the time or patience (plus he's really inconsiderate) for anyone. This film was made in the late 1960s so it is dated but still an exciting film in my estimation. Dabney Coleman plays a young skiing instructor that is turned off by Redford's character's brashness but impressed by his speed and style on the ski slopes. Gene Hackman is the US ski team coach and he has to knock Chappellet down a peg or two to knock the cocky attitude out of him ( not completely).
I liked the international feel of the scenes since it almost seems like a European Alps documentary where they filmed the ski scenes. The background music of the German beer gardens and ski slope technicians counting in German adds to the film as well. If you are a Redford fan and haven't seen this film, you'll want to add it to your collection.",1423612800,,1042,4.460732984293194
1190876,5,B00000657W,"I had my doubts about this movie.  The trailer is strange and doesn't hint at a story and modern ski movies have evolved quite a bit since this was made.  I found this movie is great...not so much for the skiing (which is ok) but more because I don't remember seeing another movie like this.

Robert Redford plays an up and coming ski star who is really cocky.  He's a jerk but he's a great skier and he plans on showing everyone.  Usually movies that start this way have the guy get humbled, learn a lesson and develop and come away a better person.  This movie...not so much.  The movie shows no interest in changing him to be better.  It just explores him and his world and is unflinching about it.  It also explores the other issues in his life, his loves his family, etc... and makes no attempt to 'resolve' or improve on these relationships.  It just presents them.  It's wonderful because it feels real.  For instance his relationship with his father.  At one point he tells his father he is going to be a champion.  His father replies 'well, theres thousands of them in the world' in the most unimpressed way a father can tell his wastrel son exactly where he stands..  I kept watching hoping the guy would earn some sort of nod, or recognition from his father but it's obvious that winning over his father is a lot harder than winning gold medals.  There are a lot of real messed up relationships here.  And it makes for a great, and very unique movie.  Very worth watching.",1419292800,2,1483,4.42962962962963

1190900,5,B00000657W,"This is a movie about a punk hotshot kid (Redford) who has never been out of his small Colorado town and is thrust onto the world cup team to replace an injured skier. It's about how a young pompous American learns (the hard way) how the European side of alpine racing works. You have to remember that if you took football, basketball, hockey, and baseball and roll them into one sport, that's how the Europeans view alpine skiing. I love this movie as it captures what the sport is really like.  If you like crazy action and stupid plot you will hate this movie.  It is very subtle with little soundtrack and lots of background conversations which is what makes it so brilliant. If you pay attention it's a fascinating extremely well done movie.

If you love skiing this is for you, but having missed the first 10 minutes of it on TV just now, the rest of the film did not add up to even five minutes TOTAL of dialogue from HIM.  A total social misfit, not even knowing how to form a SENTENCE with a woman.  I found it so sad to see My Redford in such a role.... it was so depressing.  After sex in his car, she asked him his opinion of where she should go visit on a rrip [some quiestion like that, describing both alternatives] and all he could say was ""I don't know, have any more of that gum?""  That was the EXTENT OF THEIR WHOLE CONVERSATION!!!  He was totally disinterested in ANYTHING, nor any human contact except sexually then pants up and back to business getting rid of them as fast as he could, at least liking the second one a LITTLE more, maybe saying TWO words to HER.... then her dumping HIM, getting right out of the car when he shut HER up from talking by pushing the car horn!!  That was the ONLY decent moment in th ewhole film, his getting what he deserved, and SHE, he WAS obsessed with but treated HER no different.

1190904,4,B00000657W,"""Downhill Racer"" is a sport/racing genre film with skiing at the centre of the narrative.

Considering the era the movie was made in (1969), with no computer generated images and little in the way of special effects, good old fashion active camera work provides the viewer with plenty of adrenalin.

Protagonist and Olympic hopeful Dave Chappellet (Robert Redford) puts the ""I"" in team driven by his desire to be the best, and with little regard to picking up and putting down whatever he needs to get there. Team coach Eugene Claire (Gene Hackman) finds Chappellet difficult to manage and tries several ways to rein him in, but it seems victory is the only language he understands.

This film presents a fantastic opportunity to see Redford and Hackman at an earlier stage in their careers and seeing their acting in a pure state.

The score/soundtrack to the movie was made at a time when popular songs were seldom used and tunes were carefully crafted to stimulate emotion.

It's a film which encourages the viewer to strive for greatness and be a bit ruthless about it too.

1190950,4,B00000657W,"Dating from 1969, Downhill Racer holds up remarkably well both as a character study and a visually impressive journey into the world of Olympic skiing.  Robert Redford, in the title role, plays an egotistical loner aiming for Olympic Gold.  Coming from a background of rural poverty, he is fiercely determined to achieve fame and fortune.  Often abrasive and laconic, he is openly contemptuous of people who lack his ambition, and resentful of those who have been born to wealth.  Gene Hackman provides an interesting foil, recognizing his ability, but manipulating him for his own purposes.  All this plays out against a background of lofty mountain scenery and high-speed ski runs.  There is something very legitimate about the characterizations here: the implicit subtext is that success requires both relentless perseverance and an element of cold-bloodedness.",1352764800,5,864,5.41044776119403
1190951,5,B00000657W,"Robert Redford's 1969 film DOWNHILL RACER is a film that its admirers have long desired to see on DVD, and understandably so: director Michael Ritchie, Redford (who produced the film and came up with its concept), and writer James Salter fashioned a taut, economically-told portrait of a skier named David Cappellet, whose single-minded desire to achieve success on the U.S. ski team fuels his ego-centric behavior.

Atmospherically shot in a pseudo-documentary style on location in Europe -- in some of the most renowned Alpine locales in Austria, France and Switzerland -- ""Downhill Racer"" is both a product of its time and a still-relevant commentary on the nature of the modern athlete. As Redford himself discusses in the disc's supplements, winning truly is everything in this country -- so much that it can provide an excuse for abhorrent behavior. It's not that Redford's character in ""Downhill Racer"" is intensely dislikeable (at least not when compared to some of the completely off-putting professional athletes we see today), but he is a cipher whose motives are individualistic and internal. Winning, to him, seems to be the only thing guiding him forward, even though his coach (Gene Hackman) attempts to balance his behavior with his Gold-medal potential talent.

It's an interesting film with fine, early performances from the likes of Redford and Hackman (a young Dabney Coleman also essays one of Redford's fellow team members), not to mention superb cinematography that captures the essence of Alpine skiing circa the late `60s, when live sports coverage was just beginning to affirm its place in the broadcast spectrum and men like David Chappellet were on the cusp of turning into international sports heroes.

Criterion's DVD of this 1969 Paramount release includes a fine 16:9 (1.85) transfer along with mono sound and a number of extras: new video interviews with Redford, Salter, editor Richard Harris and other members of the production team; audio excerpts from a 1977 AFI seminar with the late Michael Ritchie; a rare promotional featurette entitled ""How Fast?""; the trailer; and booklet notes from Variety critic Todd McCarthy.",1337817600,4,2156,5.261627906976744

1190953,5,B00000657W,"Stunning scenery, fabulous heart stopping skiing, beautiful people and a great story.  This is a movie that be watched over and over!",1264550400,,133,5.045454545454546
1190954,5,B00000657W,"""Downhill Racer"" stars Robert Redford in his prime as David Chappellet, a taciturn loner from Colorado, who competes with an underdog American team for Olympic gold in Europe. Gene Hackman co-stars as the coach who tries to temper Chappellet's narcissistic and reckless drive for glory.

""Downhill Racer"" came out late in 1969 hot on the heels of Redford's success with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" Unfortunately it wasn't marketed properly and failed at the box office, but don't let that deter you 'cause this is a great film well worthy of your time.

Although the movie is from '69 and therefore has obvious dated aspects, ""Downhill Racer"" was very innovative in it's time and holds up amazingly well to this day. In fact, aside from the ski paraphernalia, I don't find the film dated at all. It somehow has a fresh quality and plays out like a docudrama similar to, say, ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which was made nigh three decades later(!).

""Downhill Racer"" is reminiscent of 1966's ""The Blue Max"" in that both films are about an unlikable loner who is ruthlessly ambitious in his area of skill and functions as a fish out of water in the social circles to which he's thrust. It goes without saying that if you liked ""The Blue Max"" you'll probably like this one too. Both rank with my favorite films of all time.

Downhill racing is an insanely hazardous sport in that the skier can reach speeds of 80-90 mph(!). Needless to say, one bad fall could take you out for life. Downhill is also an extremely individualistic sport, which is well pointed out in the story when a teammate criticizes Chappellet for not being a team player and another guy responds, ""Well, it isn't exactly a team sport, is it?"" Needless to say, it takes a very certain kind of individual to be successful at downhill -- someone who's ultra-daring and bold; someone with a wild, reckless edge balanced by the necessary discipline to train and compete. Redford effectively plays such a person here. He rises up in the ranks to become the American team's only true hopeful; the coach attempts to somewhat keep him under reigns and criticizes his individualism and recklessness even while he knows these are the very qualities that makes him a winner. Throughout the picture Chappellet and the coach act like they don't like each other at all, and it's true because Chappellet is a loner in the truest sense, but ultimately the coach is squarely on the young racer's side: When it comes time for the vital Olympic run the coach looks into Chappellet's eyes and confidently states, ""You can win this.""

Take note of the stark contrast of Chappellet's plain hometown in Colorado and the glitz of the European ski resorts where he races. Also contasted is Chappellet's throw-away hometown girl (""Do ya have some more of that gum"" -- LOL) and the glamorous self-absorbed babe he hooks up with in Europe (Camilla Sparv of ""Mackenna's Gold"" fame); she gives him a good taste of his own bad self, if you know what I mean. Also of interest is his 'relationship' with his distant father, a simple country man who doesn't understand his son's preoccupation with skiing and the lack of financial gain thereof.

While watching I couldn't help but think of Bill Johnson, the unlikely downhill gold medal winner for the USA in the '84 Olympics. Like Chappellet he was cocky & reckless and irked the European snobs with his bold predictions of Olympic victory. I have no doubt that ""Downhill Racer"" was one of Bill's favorite films. Unfortunately Mr. Johnson staged an improbable comeback bid for the 2002 Olympics that ended abruptly with a horrible downhill crash in March, 2001, leaving him permanently brain-damaged and in need of constant care. How the mighty have fallen!

One cavil I have with ""Downhill Racer"" is that Redford is playing a person in his early 20s while he was 32 years-old during filming and looks it. But this is just nitpicking.

Highly recommended.",1260835200,5,3942,4.803834808259587
1190955,5,B00000657W,"I first saw this film when it was released in 1969. I was a graduate student and part-time ski instructor in western New York, a time when my professional and avocational skiing interests were in full development.  I loved it then, and I still love watching it now!  It captured the essence of the ski racing scene and gave me touchpoints to use with my student skiers.  Much later when I was at the University of Colorado (Redford's daughter was a CU student at the time), I got involved in the World Cup races in Aspen and saw much of the same behavior with the top competitors (many of whom were absolute jerks).  Redford and Hackman are superb in refecting these dynamics and the attitudes of world-class athletes.  I already have two VHS copies of the the film and am purchasing the new DVD version.

I'm still skiing on my Volkl Reintigers and will continue to do so until ski manufactures rediscover the beauty and grace of skiing with ankles locked together in a waltz with the mountain. Stein if you read this review I'm sure you know what I mean.",1258761600,2,547,4.5353535353535355
1190979,5,B00000657W,"Given that this film has been taught and studied in film schools for almost three decades, it's arrival on Criterion seems egregiously late.  Be that as it may.

Why is it an important piece of film history?  This film represents creative successes and marketing failures.

Actors: Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, Camilla Sparv, and Dabney Coleman all give restrained performances that are more intense for their economy.  Well directed, these actors underplayed their roles and allowed personal and emotional tensions to build.  It's a style of acting that is no longer in vogue, but this presents a classic example of it.  There is a timelessness in the acting, too: despite the economy of portrayal, the complexity of every persona is clear.  The audience knows each moment.  The cafe scene between Hackman and Redford and the car scene between Redford and Sparv are some of the best in the film.

Director: Michael Ritchie has a strong creative vision, to be sure.  He may be one of those artists who captured the aesthetic and ethos of a time at the expense of the rest of his career.  In this movie and ""The Candidate"" Ritchie hit his peak.  Like so many creative directors, he had to sacrifice his creative vision in order to continue his career on the strength of his technical skills.  ""Downhill Racer"" and ""The Candidate"" are the early films in his career that still inspire young cinastes studying the history of the medium, but they were influential in their own time, too.  ""Fletch Lives"" and ""The Golden Child,"" both Ritchie films, were made for box office marketability, as was pretty much everything he made after 1980.  Perhaps Ritchie took that turn after the seed planted from the sting of ""Downhill Racer.""  His own influences are clearly seen in ""Downhill Racer"" as his is place in the New Hollywood movement.

Writing: James Salter wrote the screenplay.  Enough said.  But, to say more: the common Salter themes are present, but also visible is his reading of Pindar.  The victory odes of Pindar remain enduring examples of the psychology of victory, that apogee of mortality tangent to divinity on earth--a celebration of art and the physical and mental discipline at any cost, in the ancient Greek mind, that is.  The final scene and its seemingly early cut are as Pindaric as Olympian 1.

Marketing: The studio had no idea what to do with this film.  The production staff, director, and actors all saw themselves as making an art house film.  In an era long before Miramax, this was no easy task.  The studio execs marketed it as an action film.  Audiences, expecting one thing, saw another.  ""Downhill Racer"" was a box office flop.  Redford took this personally.  This was the experience, actually the first of a string of studio ""misunderstandings,"" that compelled him to found the Sundance Institute.

History: ""Downhill Racer"" is definitely a product of its time.  As the New Hollywood movement was trying to make more ""art house"" movies, more inspired by French New Wave and less by ""classical"" Hollywood, these directors were trying to make creative and aesthetically edgy films on a shoestring budget, and they did.  ""Downhill Racer"" and ""Easy Rider"" are some of the best examples of this moment in film history.  (Cinema won't see that effort again until the Dogma movement.)

And if you happen to be a skier, especially a former racer, you'll see the soul of the sport.  Sure, the equipment and technique is dated, but the attitudes and lifestyle are timeless.

Thank you, Criterion, for releasing this just in time for ski season!",1256342400,9,3563,4.89799331103679

1190982,5,B00000657W,"The opening sequence of ""Downhill Racer"" gets the adrenalin flowing - plenty of softly photographed downhill action accompanied the crisp jazz notes of composer Kenyon Hopkins' first-rate score. Then the film settles down to a pace befitting its core: a quiet study of a loner, exhibiting strained relations with most everyone around him, as he develops the zone he intends to maintain for victory.

In this somewhat contrarian role on the heels of his charming ""Sundance Kid"" performance, a still-emerging Robert Redford plays effectively off Gene Hackman in a thoughtful and interesting exploration of what makes a winning athlete tick and whether ""teamwork"" is always relevant to winning. Redford's visit to his hometown is a bit unsettling; one can feel the tenseness between father and son and the uncomfortableness of a young man who is not really ""home"" at all. The same low-lying tension permeates the other quiet scenes in and around team headquarters, which makes the actual competition - punctuated by Hopkins' buoyant score - all the more breathtaking.

Director Ritchie, who also worked with Redford in ""The Candidate"", knew how to get the most out of shooting his star's facial expressions, which deepen the feel of unease throughout much of ""Downhill Racer"", and that artful camerawork is put to excellent use in the film's finale.

This is a film worth a second look.",1200268800,8,1383,5.137777777777778

1190984,5,B00000657W,"I kick off every Ski Season by popping in my old vhs copy of Downhill Racer. It is one of the few, if not the only, ski films out there that is able to capture the american ski scene and culture in the late 60's as vividly and honestly as this film does. The Redford character is rather complex actually, a loner, a selfish and self indulgent athlete with great talent ... a talent never recognized or appreciated by his father. So perhaps it was a troubled and sad family life that fostered the cocky and arrogant attitude he brought with him to ski racing. And the very aspects of his personality that the coach and team members find disgraceful are the very same traits that make him a top racer, a winner. And as long as he keeps winning races this behavior will be embraced by the fans, the media and ultimately his coach.

His relationship with Carmilla Sparv is totally engaging, perfectly played and it's the only way the Redford character will get a taste of his bad self! And I've seen many a man's goggles fog up at the sight of a gorgeous gal who not only skis well but drives a porsche ... she was perfect for Redford ...hello, certainly she belonged in this movie!!

1190985,3,B00000657W,"When it comes to Robert Redford, I am a huge fan.  Redford is very famous for his role as Roy Hobbs in ""The Natural"" - a movie that many consider one of the greatest Baseball movies of all-time.  What many people don't realize is that earlier in his career Redford did another sports film - this one dealt with downhill skiing.  This movie is simply titled ""Downhill Racer"".  This movie is a very different movie than ""The Natural"".  Although from a plot standpoint, it is not as compelling as ""The Natural"", ""Downhill Racer"" does come across very well as a pure Sports movie.  The movie also features Gene Hackman as Coach Eugene Clair - the U.S. Olympic Downhill Skiing coach.

The best way to sum up ""Downhill Racer"" is that it is a combination of a Docudrama and a Drama.  Even though this is a fictitious story, the movie very much comes across as a docudrama.  The Docudrama part chronicles the three year career of fictitious skier David Chappellet  (played by Robert Redford).  It chronicles the story of when Chappellet  first joins the U.S. Ski Team and then follows his career as he becomes a rising star on the Ski Circuit in Europe - climaxing with a Downhill Event in the Olympics.  This part of the movie is very well-done.  As you watch this chronicling, you will almost believe that this is a biographical story.

Redford really brings the an edge to his character of David Chappellet.  Chappellet is character who is cocky and reckless.  Chappellet arrives in Europe to the U.S. Ski Team as a fill-in for an injured teammate.  Chappellet will immediately display a brashness when he is upset about getting a poor draw in the start gate (when he hasn't even proven himself).  Redford is able to deliver this brashness flawlessly.  Hackman's performance actually was somewhat a disappointment.  There is really only one scene where Hackman comes down on Chappellet for his rebel character.  While the character of Coach Clair does a good job in portraying himself as the U.S. Ski Coach, I would have liked to have seen better interaction with Chappellet throughout the film.

This film was directed by Michael Ritchie.  Up until this movie, Ritchie's work had been primarily on television.  This film would mark the beginning of a very successful motion picture directing career.  Ritchie does a great job at translating Oakley Hall and James Salter's script and painting a picture of realism of the Ski Circuit.  This is how the film almost has a Docudrama effect.  The Ski scenes are phenomenal.  There are scenes when a camera is mounted to a skier and it gives the effect of what the skier is looking at as he goes down the hill in a race.

The film does a great job at looking at Americas role on the World Ski Circuit.  The film points out that this traditionally a sport that Americans have not done well in.  There are references to why the Americans have not been as competitive in this sport (i.e. due to lack of sponsorship, funding, and good equipment).  The movie raises the question on whether Downhill Racing is a Team or Individual Sport.  Coach Clair is quick to point out that it is a team concept because of the costs the sponsors incur in funding the team.  However one of Chappellet's teammates (played by a young Dabney Coleman) quickly points out that there are times that Skiing isn't exactly a team sport.  The movie also raises the issue of Professional vs. Amateur Athletics.  When Chappellet returns home to visit his aluft father, his father questions why anyone would want to compete if they don't get paid. (This goes back to the days when the Olympics were really considered an amateur competition).  This also comes up again at the Olympics when Chappellet is repeatedly asked what he is going to do after the Olympics (referring to the obvious financial rewards that could follow).

As part of the view of the team, there is an interesting subplot that develops.  When Chappellet arrives on the team, there is a U.S. Skiing hope named Johnny Creech who is considered the rising star of the team.  As Chappellet becomes a rising star, a rivalry develops between the two skiers.  There are definitely times that Creech doesn't appreciate Chappellet's brashness.  As the two head for the Olympics, the rivalry begins comes to a climax.  Eventually it is Chappellet who will become the Skier that will have the Olympic showdown with Europe's top skier - Max Meier.

The final scene takes place at the Olympics.  There is a very interesting twist at the end of the movie involving who gets the Gold Medal.  Just when we think who won the Meier-Chappellet showdown, there is a wildcard thrown in where a third skier comes into play on who will get the Gold Medal.  I liked how this was done.

There are some other disappointments the lack of interaction with Chappellet and the Coach.  The weakest part of the film involves a Romance Storyline.  While in his second year on the U.S. Ski Team, Chappellet develops a budding romance with an employee of a ski manufacturer named Carole Stahl (played by Camilla Sparv).  It almost seemed like they forced the Romance angle in this movie - and the movie could have probably held its own without even introducing Carole's character. I would also liked to have seen the plot involving Chappellet's father have a little more done with it.  Chappellet definitely didn't have a strong relationship with his father - and it was clear his father didn't approve of what his son did.  I would have liked to have seen some closure involving this relationship.  Instead we are kept hanging with this subplot.

Overall, if I look at this movie from the Docudrama standpoint, I find it to be better than if I look at this as a Drama about Skiing.  It is definitely worth checking out.",1110672000,8,5760,4.715430861723447
1190986,4,B00000657W,"Dated as it might be, it remains as one of the few ""must see"" films for ski enthusiasts and students of the sport's history.  It also contains one of the most haunting images of any film of its era.  That is, the very last scene, when Redford locks eyes with the unidentified, teenage German (if I recall correctly) racer who has fallen on the last steep section of the downhill course.  The difference between first and last, in ski racing as in many other pursuits, is sometimes razor thin.  The glances exchanged among the German kid, Redford, and Hackman are a magnificent example of actors imparting with subtle expressions volumes more than dialog could have.",1100736000,15,665,4.756521739130434
1190987,5,B00000657W,"This film caught my attention immediately because of the writer, James Salter, so I was surprised at how little dialogue or actual talking goes on. Its one of the most physical films I've ever seen which is certainly appropriate given the subject matter, downhill ski racing. Redford came to this fresh off of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but he looks much younger without the moustache. The topic of ski competition is exciting and fun as most of the film takes place on the mountain with great ski footage or in ski lodges in Europe which are romantic to say the least. Also attractive is Redfords European girlfriend. She gives the film another dimension completely as the embodiment of the experienced and scrupulous European versus the innocent and clumsy(and socially naive)American. Gene Hackman as the coach is absolutely great as he tries to instill more than just athletic virtues into his team members. There are also scenes of Redford, the rising star of the team, visiting home in the American midwest somewhere which I suppose tells us both why winning is so important to him and why he is so clumsy socially. Its not a perfect film( the midwest scenes seem a little too simplistic for such an otherwise smart and uncliched film)  but one that tells a great sort of story rare in 69 in that it puts forth a value system instead of knocking one down. Redford has called the film an examination of American ideals about success. It is that. The ski scenes capture the excitement of the sport, and the hotel scenes capture the rewards given to success. But success in sport as in all fields is fleeting and you best enjoy the prize while at the top because if you finish second you are nobody again and all the rewards vanish as quickly as they were given. Effective cutting technique throughout the film emphasizes the ruthless pace and nature of a life forged in the heat of competition. Redford is caught surprise by the transient nature of this life. But the film has a great sort of ethic being put forth, that being that in a world where everything can be gained or lost in a split second one must not focus so keenly on the prize immediately at stake that one loses sight of those things which sustain us through both ups and downs, ie friends, coach, Dad, old girlfriend, dog.",1010620800,22,2301,4.639705882352941

7903678,1,B00000657W,"Review of Downhill Racer
Hot Toasty Rag, October 8, 2017

Even if you love Robert Redford and you love skiing movies, I cant recommend you sit through Downhill Racer. My preference lies with the former category, and since he won a BAFTA Award for his performance, I was looking forward to seeing some high-quality acting. There was no redeeming quality about this movie, and for the life of me, I don't know why he was honored for it.

Robert Redford plays a skier with hopes to join the American Olympic team. Hes arrogant, rude, and a total cad with the women in his life. Gene Hackman plays the teams coach, and while its fun to see him and Dabney Coleman so young, its hardly worth seeing the film all the way through.

The script feels nonexistent, the acting feels ad-libbed, the plot is thin, and theres more boredom evoked than suspense. Michael Ritchies directing style feels extremely European, and I don't generally like that artsy, noncommittal, aloof style of film. Besides Havana, this just might be the worst Robert Redford movie ever made.

DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie is not your friend. Most of it is filmed with a handheld camera, and the skiing scenes seem to be filmed by the skier himself, and they will make you sick. In other words, Dont Look, Mom!",1507420800,,1330,4.622881355932203
