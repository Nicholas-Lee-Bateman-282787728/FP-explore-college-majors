8378704,4,B002RG0OYC,I loved watching the different techniques.  There is a huge difference between a cook and a chef.  It makes you appreciate fine dining.  The video was awesome.,1268611200,,159,4.814814814814815
8378705,1,B002RG0OYC,"Apparently this Kings of the Kitchen documentary is trying to ride on the success of Iron Chef and other cooking shows, which are entertaining but don't actually teach me how to cook anything.

There are 2 disks and each one has interviews with 6 chefs of some renown, so a dozen interviews all together. Each chef sits down in his restaurant and rambles on about how he got started with cooking. They say a few things about restaurant food back in the dark ages of the 1980s, 10 ingredients in a dish is too many, and is that burning smell grilled cheese with Gruyere or Double Stilton? I believe it would go well with an aged root beer from the health food store, lightly carbonated with just a hint of oak.

The interviewer asked, ""Why has that man been mopping floors all day long?
The chef replied, ""I caught him eating Fruit Loops this morning. We have to uphold our standards here at Chez Posh, even if the customers never see us eating like commoners on the East Side of London.""
I'm kidding. Nothing that entertaining ever happens in these ho hum videos.

There are many scenes of cooks being very busy in their kitchens, but there's no description of what they're doing. I saw something that looked like a small bowl made of cream cheese and filled with raspberries. That looked intriguing! And it looked to be something I could do myself. Let's hear about it! No, it was only on screen for 2 seconds and then it was gone.

I checked these disks out from my local library. I'm thankful I did not pay for them. The Martha Stewart videos are far and away better and more savory and I actually learned how to bake a simple pie crust and make a fancy edging on the pie that looks like leaves.  So I recommend skipping this video and going with Martha. Plus she's very nice and charming.",1267056000,3,1792,4.434650455927052
