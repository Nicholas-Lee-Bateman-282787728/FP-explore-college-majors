6419632,1,B00KDFO6LQ,Didn't watch clear through.  Started way too slow.  Didn't hold any of our attention (the whole family).,1466467200,2,104,5.0588235294117645

6419634,4,B00KDFO6LQ,"I liked it.  A little ""hammy"" but still an entertaining movie.  Wholesome entertainment for the whole family.",1424131200,2,109,5.352941176470588
6419635,3,B00KDFO6LQ,"Let's be frank. This movie is really flawed. The action sequences are okay but they could have removed some scenes and storylines completely and the final product would have been at least good. Acting was amateurish and the whole premise a bit ridiculous. The tone was a bit conspiracy theory heavy, which didn't help matters at all. There were better ways to tell this story. An a for effort. But if you have nothing else to watch on a rainy day...it will do.",1424044800,3,460,4.554216867469879
6419636,3,B00KDFO6LQ,"I found the plot intriguing but much of the production values severely lacking.  There was some bad acting, bad dialogue, over exposure of lighting in scenes, and bad audio (the bad audio being the worst of it).  Many times it looked like they filmed shots first then badly dubbed the dialogue into the scenes (words being spoken don't match lips moving).  Since many of film's scenes are depicted on a college campus you have to wonder if this was a student film.

This is a Christian/faith based film so there is a lot of faith/God talk, not that I found it bothersome just letting others know to expect such.  Again, the plot is the best part of this movie especially if you keep abreast of current financial markets or know anything about the Federal Reserve this movie should keep your interest.  Overall, I'd recommend the movie if you like campy faith based films mixed with a little suspenseful action.",1413676800,6,910,4.6918238993710695
6419637,5,B00KDFO6LQ,"Wow!  In our day of situation ethics and relativism, it's refreshing to see this college student venture to do the right thing!  This is a compelling, fast-paced account of sophisticated international monetary corruption, as well as rampant moral corruption on campus- the consequences of covetousness, jealousy and disobedience ring loudly, while the rewards of honesty & character prove to bring forth a sense of well being & satisfaction.  Highly recommended!  Be sure to share with a friend too.",1407542400,3,499,5.358974358974359
6419648,4,B00KDFO6LQ,The story line was outstanding!! They covered all of the salient points of the crooks thar run the Fed. The acting wasn't great but the story line more than made up for amateur acting.,1505001600,3,184,4.4411764705882355
6419649,5,B00KDFO6LQ,"Amazing quality Indy film. Great special effects, exciting action story about the federal reserve. Intense drama with good character development. I'm greatly impressed with this young filmmakers work!",1504742400,2,200,6.178571428571429
6419650,2,B00KDFO6LQ,"Decent script with potential, but the acting was amateurish.  I left after ten minutes. Too bad, good story line. Next get some professional actors. Christian, Jew, Buddhist...who gives a rip? Just make a decent film. Nothing to do with one's religion.",1504569600,,252,5.146341463414634

6419655,3,B00KDFO6LQ,"Nice plot.  A serious story with global implication.  However, this could of been a much better movie if the script and the directing didn't make this like a teen movie.  The bad directing didn't help either.",1503878400,,208,4.722222222222222

6419657,5,B00KDFO6LQ,"This Movie has an intriguing story based around the Federal Reserve, international finance and the global elite. The story plays out as an adventure much like the summer movies I watched growing up. The Sub plots about honesty, transparency, and how your worldview shapes your actions are worthwhile and present a powerful message. Although this movie is not marketed strictly as a family movie I would have to say it is completely family friendly while not being boring or campy as is so often the case with that genera. Worth watching and recommending to your friends. 5 out of 5 stars well done!",1503878400,3,598,4.815533980582524

6419674,1,B00KDFO6LQ,"I love bad movies.  Some can be quite a lot of fun.  I understand that budget restraints will sometimes interfere with a production, special effects, and even acting.  But this was SO BAD, and SO BORING.  It's a story about a conspiracy theory.  An all powerful cabal shapes the world according to their whims.  But when they are thrown against 3 college kids then they seem powerless.

 I get that there will be poor acting, but everyone was better than the piece of wood they hired as the main protagonist, and no one in this movie was good.  His monotone was simply pathetic, anyone, literally, else would be better.  Plus the movie was SO LONG, being almost 1 hour and 45 minutes.  It could easily have been cut to an hour 20 and it would lose absolutely nothing.  I listen to a podacst called God Awful Movies.  They picked this one for their latest episode.  They seemed to be having so much fun picking it apart that I paused the podcast and watched this.  And that was a mistake.

 Again, I do not mind a bad, cheaply made movie.  But this one committed the sin of being boring and ridiculous at the same time.  The absurd plot line made no sense.  And I am not talking about the conspiracy theory, which is the point of this movie.  Actually, the claim that the lizard people (only implied, it was the ....  Jews!!!  that's right, they blame the Jews) gold was responsible for the Russian Revolution was the least absurd thing about this movie.  Hitmen and an all powerful boss, who kill anyone who stumbles upon any information about their evil agenda, and who have almost limitless power to surveil the protagonists, then can't even stay in the shadows and seem so inept that three college kids are able to foil them and can take apart an organization that has been running and ruining the world since the 1700s.  Absolutely a pathetic effort.  The religion thrown in out of nowhere, which added absolutely nothing to the plot was silly and pointless.  It was even worse than the extreme libertarian propaganda about the Fed.  And the name of our main hero?  That's right, Adam Smith.

 Other things simply make no sense.  The female lead seems to be unaware of anything, and uninterested.  Plus she spends most of the time with her two partners, escaping the hired killers.  Out of the blue she comes out and explains the whole conspiracy theory to the other two.  How did she find the information?  Doesn't matter.  She finds Jesus at the end so it all ends well.  Wow, what a piece of rubbish.",1502236800,,2507,4.538116591928251

6419693,4,B00KDFO6LQ,"Overall, simple with an interesting story behind the plot. Main actors were fine, but perhaps it is the directing that gives it that amateurish feel? No intimate scenes, no bloodshed/violence, no cursing (The Batman it does not try to be).  There were some bad guys with dark glasses, lol.  The bad guys chasing the good guys was actually funny since it was so simpleton. They didn't even show the dead guy, if I recall.  You just knew he was going to be killed.  But that's not the acting, is it? I think our movies today are filled with so much violence, we cal those without ""boring"".  I think watching this movie was not boring. The actors interacted together pretty well to allow the story to progress and the plot to thicken.  Photography and music were mostly well done.  A 5-star it is not due to the flaws of the directing. I gave it 4-stars because ""I like it"".  If you have small children, this is like watching an old movie with modern parts like computers and cell phones, and one of the heroes is a computer geek! Oh, and these college kids have real books and one works at the Library! I kid you not.",1499990400,2,1115,4.404878048780488

6419696,1,B00KDFO6LQ,"Unimaginably amateurish production. Acting is so bad, you will cringe. Religious propaganda takes ten minutes to start seeping out. Anti-Fed propaganda is on a level with alien abductions and Loch Ness monster films. I love Amazon Prime, but can't understand how this piece of garbage film is shown without a warning ""This Film may be unsuitable for all viewers"".",1499126400,2,363,5.169491525423729

6419711,4,B00KDFO6LQ,"I enjoyed this Christian political thriller. No, it wasn't as high-polished and flawlessly captivating in writing, acting and flow as a big Hollywood production but that's because it wasn't one. So, minus one star for lack in some of the acting & some other weak areas. However, being a Christian looking for these types of movies, I applaud their efforts because overall I did enjoy it and did not think it presented the religious point over-strong like some movies that are over-long sermons to the detriment of plot & entertaining story line, which turn people off. I think they are on the right track and if they improve weak areas in future movies, I would definitely look forward to seeing them. The main female lead's acting was not always believable for me - case in point, the crying after losing a friend and some of the other parts. I believed the main male lead's 'character a little more and I loved the lovable light geeky supporting male role (his character was perhaps better written also). The intensity of a thriller could be upped a lot, yes. The bad guys did not seem evil or old enough some of them and other roles played also by those who looked too young. The federal reserve board characters may also be actual church board members. BUT amateurism aside, the plot theme (who doesn't like a hint at the Illuminati) and the twist & turns of story with finish were an enjoyable effort to me. I enjoyed the variety of characters in the story. There was also no lack in the variety and type of settings a bigger budget thriller would have (Love the backstory from history and a foreign country and tie in to the modern day plot and characters- well done).  If you can't forgive flaws of an effort like this, then please don't view it and hack it apart. But if you're like me and you forgive some imperfections and a less intense movie presentation (think Love Comes Softly movies but different genre) you'll enjoy the story they portray & the message.",1483920000,6,1970,4.612535612535613

The audio track kept changing from clearly audible to having to turn up the TV to hear the poorly recorded audio (voice/music).  We didn't give up on it and watched it all the way through as the three-stars suggest, it was ""okay"".

There are some gunshot scenes, but no gore. Nothing sexual or vulgar. We enjoyed the mystery solving elements of the plot, and the plugs for a God who makes the rules.
