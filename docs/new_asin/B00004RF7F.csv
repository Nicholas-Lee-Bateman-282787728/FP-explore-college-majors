7920898,5,B00004RF7F,"A few years ago, this tape helped me overcome chronic low back pain. A massage therapist recommended it for it's precise, careful, gentle and mindful routine. She noted that most people overstretch in yoga and inadvertantly injure themselves. I used the tape 3-5 nights per week before bed--a kind of meditation in motion.

I had memorized the routine, but without the video I would rush, neglect to breath and relax properly, and would not get the full and amazing sense of physical and mental relaxation that came from following along with the voices, music, and pacing of the video.

I've been doing a more challenging yoga routine for the last 5 years, but the old low back pain has returned and I'm turning back to this tape for my therapy! Wish they offered it on DVD.

One caution: the music and studio setting are not very inspiring or beautiful, but they're not distracting either.",1179360000,,890,4.766233766233766
7920899,5,B00004RF7F,"IF YOU NEED A GOOD STRETCH, FEEL TENSE, AND STESSED, THEN THIS TAPE IS EXCELLENT. I'M A BEGINNER AT YOGA, AND BOUGHT THIS TAPE TO STRETCH MY MUSCLES SO I DON'T TENSE UP. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO INCORPORATE A STRETCHING ROUTINE IF YOUR DOING AEROBICS AND/OR WEIGHT TRAINING, AND THIS ONE IS ONLY 30 MINUTES AND FITS INTO MY PROGRAM ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK. ITS VERY SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T STRETCH, THEN YOU WONT KEEP YOUR LONG LEAN MUSCLES AND YOU'LL TENSE UP, AS KATHY WOULD SAY. I SUGGEST BUYING THIS TAPE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE YOGA AND WORKOUT FREQUENTLY BECAUSE ITS A GREAT WAY TO GEET THE FEEL OF YOGA. I HAVE TO SAY KATHY IS A GREAT INSTRUCTOR THAT HELPED ME CHANGE MY BODY AND MY LIFE.",1059264000,,718,4.325925925925926
7920900,4,B00004RF7F,"I bought this tape because I want to improve my flexibility without making a 1-hour long commitment every time I sit down to do it.  Some of the poses are difficult for me, but I am just starting out and expected a bit of a challenge.  Kathy takes her time with each pose and doesn't rush, so there is plenty of time to check that you are doing it correctly and don't hurt yourself.  If you want to try Yoga, but find most of the tapes out there are more than you want to jump into right now, then this is a good tape to help you begin.",1011571200,4,536,3.9444444444444446
7920901,4,B00004RF7F,"Kathy Smith's approach is even and an excellent start for those who are interested in bringing more balance into their hectic lives.  Both the video and audio, in tandem, introduce novices to the concepts of yoga and meditation without being overly ""new age"" in presentation.  For those who are curious about yoga, I would recommend this set as an introduction before purchasing any other tapes, as it gives the flavor of yoga without overcomplicating it.  Some beginner tapes are so overwhelming that they end up gathering dust.  Kathy and Rod are a great team in presenting effective relaxation and stress relief moves. The audio is a nice introduction to meditation, although I find meditation tapes by Jon Kabat-Zinn and Shakti Gawain more effective.  It is a nice compliment to the video, especially if you are a traveling business professional and would like to destress in your hotel room after a busy day. For those who are already familiar with yoga practice and meditation, you may find this too basic and maybe disappointing.  I do like Kathy and Rod's other yoga tapes, so if you use this as an introduction and then use it to move onto other's in the series, you should be satisfied.  It is excellent for day's when doing a full yoga routine may be too much, but you need to regain your center, focus.",970790400,10,1314,4.762114537444934
