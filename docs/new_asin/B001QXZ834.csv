8336844,1,B001QXZ834,"I'm really sorry I purchased this DVD. Jerome Brailey is one of the great proponents of funk, but he is left to demonstrate licks that some weirdo guy who thinks he is a drummer tells him to do.  Its like why would you buy a Buddy Rich DVD and listen some production fool tell you what Buddy is doing....Buddy can do that himself! A complete dissappointment and a waste of money and talent.",1395100800,2,390,4.342465753424658
