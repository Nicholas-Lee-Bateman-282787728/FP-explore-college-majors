3090980,5,B0012KK6QK,"This DVD is one of the better yoga DVDs I've tried.

First it has an extensive library to explain the poses, which everyone, whether a beginner or a more advanced practitioner, should watch before starting.  The explanations are given in simple, understandable and clear words.

Second, the sequences are indeed gentle vinyasa flows.  The sessions are divided into 2 series depending on one's practice level and experience, and each is divided further into 3 practices with different times.

Third, the flows are simple, doable flows that anyone serious enough to do some exercise can do. To those who want to pretend they are exercising while not stressing your body, this is not the DVD for you.  Although one may not sweat with the program, the body nonetheless is doing yoga.  The flow is not hurried at all but relaxing.  It is a wonderful stretching program for athletes.

Fourth, the instructions are given in a clear soothing voice.  Admittedly, I initially found the tone of Ms. Landwijt's voice a little bit patronizing, as if she were speaking to a 5 year old child.  However, I got past it as I assumed that she modulated her voice and manner of speaking to suit her program's intention of providing a gentle yoga practice.

Fifth, the camera work is great because you see every step and movement that you need to see.  There is no confusion as to what you are supposed to do next.

Lastly, I like the fact that she definitely tells you that the practice has ended so you don't have to get out of your shavasana in order to see if the practice is over.

I don't know if this is Ms. Landwijt's debut DVD but it's good work.",1232323200,16,1634,4.6055363321799305
3090981,5,B0012KK6QK,It was given as a gift . My wife said it is the best DVD on yoga she has used.,1232236800,5,78,2.95
3090982,5,B0012KK6QK,"I am so pleased with this DVD. The teacher is authentic, lacks pretension....the real deal. She gives you so much with this DVD. 3 levels of practices-extensive guidance on doing the poses correctly-she's completely thorough. This is all the yoga you'll ever need! Excellent for beginners-advanced-really worth every penny. The production is amazing too. This is first rate...get it, you won't be sorry! I am so impressed!",1222732800,8,422,5.313432835820896
3090983,5,B0012KK6QK,"This yoga video is one of the best I own.  If you are tired of endless sun salutations and want a slower paced yet effective stretch--this is for you.  She starts out with a couple slow sun salutes, then moves into some standing poses, and finishes on the floor with nice relaxing streches.  You can choose from 6 workouts ranging in length from 36 minutes to an hour.  Highly recommended.",1209859200,25,389,4.514285714285714
3090984,5,B0012KK6QK,"This is a gorgeous and useful DVD.  Exteremly well produced.  There are 6 practices - levels A and B both have practices of around half an hour, three quarters of an hour, and an hour.  I've tried 2 of the level A practices so far, even though I'm not a beginner, and really liked them. They are gentle vinyasa, but one does work.  Very thorough and well taught work...  The extra chapters on individual poses are extremely well done also.

I love this dvd.  The day after a weights workout I find it impossible to do power yoga.  This is great without being too easy.  Tones and stretches every part of your body and as a great bonus the shavasana is a yoga nidra which leaves me feeling totally mellow, relaxed and revived.

Oh, and the instructor besides clearly knowing her stuff has a very nice and mellow voice.

Highly recommended.",1207526400,79,838,4.483443708609271
3090985,5,B0012KK6QK,"Yoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flow with Zyrka Landwijt is my favorite vinyasa DVD. Filmed against the backdrop of beautiful Santa Barbara treetops, Zyrka teaches with precision and grace. She guides the student through the poses via voice-over using her gentle and soothing voice. Her detailed instructions allow the student to follow along without keeping their eyes glued to the television (a frequent complaint of most yoga DVDs). That said, you will want to view the entire practice at least once, to soak in the beauty of the poses and scenery! Another important fact is that this DVD is gently infused with yogic philosophy and does not contain the lectures that punctuate most yoga DVDs.

The DVD includes an Introduction by Zyrka, Pose Guide (23 poses), and 6 workouts ranging from 36 to 64 minutes long.",1206662400,97,803,4.992537313432836
3090986,5,B0012KK6QK,"Too many user reviews base their star-ratings on how well the program met their expectations - you find 1 and 2 star reviews followed by complaints that the program was too hard for them, or too easy, or the music wasn't to their taste, or that the seller left mustard stains on the case; but little insight into the actual program quality.  I will state at the outset that this program was not as challenging as I would have liked - but it helped me realize that I've made progress in my form, stamina, and willingness to extend, and it benefited me in other ways.

However, after trying both the a and b series, I can honestly say that this DVD lives up to its billing. It deserves a perfect rating for what it offers, and the care with which it is produced. I would recommend it to anyone looking to extend their beginner lessons into something more flowing, but preferring to avoid the more intense power vinyasa DVDs, or the more chatty and motivational instructors. It is gentle, meditative vinyasa, and despite the relative lack of challenge, it was very well-taught, in a pleasant, unobtrusive setting; a patient, clear verbal tone; well-demonstrated by a graceful and modest instructor; and it left me both relaxed and limber.

The pose guide would be a great resource for a beginner, and tipped me off to a few things I'd become sloppy with.  For a near-beginner or advanced-beginner, I think this DVD, with its mix of programs and lengths, offers a fine build-up to a more intense practice.  It is also a fine alternative for more experienced practitioners on blah days, needing a balance of meditative and physical, or nursing minor injuries.  For true beginners: please take some classes and learn your basics with feedback from a live instructor, then supplement with a DVD such as this.  For the rest: always go back to classes for live tune-ups - there is always something to be gained or improved from the eyes and skills of a good instructor.",1205107200,343,1960,4.680232558139535

3090990,3,B0012KK6QK,I haven't watched the video as of yet because I was annoyed with the disc format. I attempted playing the disc on my computer and based on reading several forums the fact that I have Windows 7 or newer (I have 10) my system can't read the disc. The file can't be read because I need a UDF reader. The disc can be read however on the Xbox One. I'll update after I play the disc.,1452384000,,377,3.973684210526316

3090992,5,B0012KK6QK,I bought this for a something a little more challenging than plain gentle yoga. My husband stole it and I to buy another one! This is a really easy and refreshing video. I love that there are so many different workout lengths!,1441152000,,226,4.404761904761905
3090993,5,B0012KK6QK,Excellent flow.  Wonderful voice.  Gentle yet invigorating.  This is my regular go-to yoga dvd out of a very large library.,1439337600,,123,5.05
3090994,5,B0012KK6QK,I LOVE this yoga dvd!!! It is great for beginners or intermediate...it is a little slow moving but I keep going back to this dvd... This has 6 workouts. Series A for beginners and Series B once you have mastered the A series... They are also all 3 different lengths. All I can say is I love this workout!,1438819200,,304,4.169491525423729
3090995,5,B0012KK6QK,"This is a perfect daily yoga DVD for novice to moderate levels. Zyrka's voice on this DVD is a little sing song, but I really enjoy her gentle clear instructions, and the calming, no nonsense presentation she provides. I also enjoy Zyrka's other Vinyasa Flow DVD very much. If you find some of the Yoga Diva DVDs to be overpowering and not your style, please give this a try. Borrowing from your local library before you purchase yoga DVDs can save you a lot of money and frustration.",1435881600,,484,4.511363636363637
3090996,5,B0012KK6QK,Simply the best Yoga DVD I have ever owned and I have many many of them. This one always leaves me relaxed and upbeat while still getting great results in transforming my body.,1432857600,,176,4.363636363636363
3090997,5,B0012KK6QK,"great stretches, eases you into the practice.  Even after I moved on to more advanced DVD routines I still  return to this one after I've skipped more than a week of practice to get limber again.  Can do just 38 minutes in the morning and be stretched and calm for the day. Great voiceover, things I've never heard in other classes or DVDs that  were ""aha"" moments for me as I mastered breathing and RELAXING into poses instead of STRAINING into them.  Can do 47 min or an hour as you have time. In total- 6 different routines",1432080000,2,526,4.326530612244898
3090998,5,B0012KK6QK,Enjoy this yoga video very much.  Relaxing and offers several different classes with easy to follow positions.  Great for beginner or someone getting back into yoga.  Several different class times allow you to fit in a quick morning workout or spend more time if you have it.,1427328000,,275,4.808510638297872
3090999,1,B0012KK6QK,"Horrible video quality. The cover picture on the dvd case is blurry, that was the first sign. I played the dvd and the image quality is horrible. The trees in the background look like green blobs. Image is very grainy. Will be returning.",1424390400,,237,4.534883720930233
3091000,5,B0012KK6QK,"Excellent DVD for gentle yoga.  I'm in my late 50's and do yoga to increase flexibility, and also for energy and some strength.  Zyrka's DVD contains a pose guide for most basic yoga poses, which is excellent because she offers variations on most of the poses, to help people modify if necessary to accommodate their own ability.  She offers 6 routines, averaging 30-40 minutes each.  I have quite a few Yoga DVDs; this has become one of my favorites.",1424390400,,451,4.670886075949367

3091002,5,B0012KK6QK,"Love it! Was looking for a dvd to do yoga at home, like the soft ones more for stretching and relaxation and this one was perfect. There is too many to chose from which can be anoying, so happy to have picked this.",1418428800,2,214,4.0

3091004,5,B0012KK6QK,"I am new to yoga, in my early 60s, and fairly flexible, but I am not interested in turning myself into a pretzel. This DVD is perfect for me! The instructor's voice is soothing and her instructions are clear and well-timed. She is so graceful and fluid that I enjoy just watching her and hope the practice helps me move more like her. The pose guide that teaches you how to do each pose correctly and safely is very helpful. So far, I have only done the first routine (there are 6) and find it gently challenging and relaxing at the same time. I really look forward to doing it, in fact, and love the way my body feels when I am finished.",1415059200,4,638,4.195121951219512
3091005,5,B0012KK6QK,"I'm a 65 year old male who needed to improve my flexibility and strength.  Started with 'Gentle Practice' DVD in 1/2014 and after eight months I wanted more variety and a greater challenge in my yoga practice.  The ""FlOW"" DVD does take my practice to another manageable level and meets my need for variety, a challenge and improved fitness.  I'm very happy with the Gentle Vinyasa Flow.  I've completed each level to get familiar with the routines.  In addition I find myself going back to the 'Gentle Practice' DVD to concentrate on poses I find very helpful to my well being.  In addition to Yoga, I lift light weights, do core exercises and ride bicycle and hike.  The hardest part of being in my 60's is finding friends\relatives in the same mind set of good health, fitness and physical adventures.  I ditto all the accolades written about Zyrka, her style and her yoga practice presented in the two DVDs.",1414022400,4,910,4.679245283018868

3091009,5,B0012KK6QK,"My new favorite yoga DVD.  I have all the Living Arts DVDs and after a few years, have found some are too easy and some are too hard, most are too short, some are too long.  This DVD is just right for progressing from very beginner.  The easiest work out is 38"" long, perfect, and just challenging enough to make me feel like my body is changing.  Lovely voice, nice music.  This is what yoga is all about.",1408406400,,406,4.153846153846154

3091012,2,B0012KK6QK,With 3 kinds of arthritis and some injuries I looked for a gentle yoga. If I could do push-ups I wouldn't need to look for gentle yoga. I cannot use this video.,1398297600,,160,4.03125
3091013,3,B0012KK6QK,"I have been doing yoga about 6 months between 1 & 5 times a week I'm not that flexible but I'm quite agile and strong living on a farm. This is too slow and too easy for me and gets boring so I lose interest mid work out.

3091014,5,B0012KK6QK,"Very soothing and relaxing video that will give you the basics as well as some good stretches.  My husband and I are 30 and relatively active, and this isn't exactly a challenging workout.  Still, the instructor's voice is very caliming and it's great for stress relief and stretching.",1397088000,,285,4.916666666666667
3091015,1,B0012KK6QK,I did not even realize an entire section is skipped over until I did this program about 5 times.  Then I fast forwarded to see if I could find the section.  It doesn't even appear each time you fast forward.  By the time I had figured this out it was too late to return it.  I am very displeased that Amazon will not replace this DVD.,1393632000,2,334,4.015151515151516
3091016,5,B0012KK6QK,"This is a great Vinyasa Flow DVD. It is easy to follow, with poses being well communicated and demonstrated. It is gentle and well paced and covers all the areas of the body for a good overall workout for those who don't want to push too hard too fast. Zyrka is a great teacher for those who appreciate a slower more intentional practice.",1391817600,2,338,4.380952380952381
3091017,5,B0012KK6QK,"I'm 64 and like other women my age I suffer from stiff joints and tight muscles and have found yoga to be an excellent way to counter these body changes.  Also like many others I find yoga classes to be a bit intimidating.  This dvd is perfect for my needs.  I have many yoga dvds and this is one of the very best.  I like alternating this dvd with the static poses on the equally excellent Gentle Practice Yoga.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a practice that is not trying to be a cardio workout, but also is not for those with physical limitations.  No chair workouts here.  The instructor gives very clear instructions, and demonstrates the poses as they should be done.",1390953600,5,682,4.451612903225806
3091018,5,B0012KK6QK,"I love love love this video. There is an A routine that is slower paced. The A routine's have 3 time's to chose from and I was sticking with the lowest length of time until I tried the 62 minute routine. Now I do it every single night. My husband who wasn't a ""yoga person"" has been converted. People get the idea that because you aren't sweating buckets that you are working. Well let me just tell you that my body literally craves this video because of the stretching and lengthening benefits. I have only tried the B routine once because it's faster paced.",1389312000,,559,4.384615384615385
3091019,4,B0012KK6QK,I gave it a 4 because it was slow. the instructor was very good in demonstrating the exercises and the background was relaxing.,1387929600,,127,4.565217391304348
3091020,4,B0012KK6QK,"1st let me state...this should be an easy 5 start rating. I will explain why I gave it 4.
I am pretty new to Yoga about 4 months into my practice and no doubt I am hooked! I have bought about 5 beginner DVD's, most from the ""big name"" Yoga rock stars. NONE of them is near as good as this DVD for a beginner, period end of story.

1. the dvd is broken into 2 practices, A&B. Both A&B have 3 sequences, 37, 47, 62 minutes and each build off the next. A being where you start and learn the basics and get a good workout at the same time. B kicks it up a notch in both complexity and intensity.
  2. Zyrka's guidance through each pose and each workout is simply incredible! Instruction and pace are spot on, options are offered if needed...the full package.
3. Her style of yoga, the way she teaches the movements and breath are like moving meditation.

The reason I gave this 4 stars not 5 is the way she ends each workout. Yoga is a by it's nature a great starting point for meditation and the ending pose is for relaxation and meditation. She just blew it here. She talks your breath into each body part and it is simply way to much talk. If she remade this DVD with a ""stiller"" more meditative resting pose I would re buy it!

That being said, if you are looking for a true teacher that can get you hooked on Yoga...this is the dvd!",1386374400,5,1333,4.111538461538461
3091021,5,B0012KK6QK,"I was new to yoga and this DVD was just PERFECT! I love her voice (soothing, calming and her instructions are spot on). So many choices of segments and different lengths of workouts. Noticed others complained about the increasing times being the workout before with some moves added in to add length of time. I LOVED THAT--after I ""mastered"" the first segment, I was hesitant to move to the next (longer) segment b/c I didn't want to learn a brand new routine all over again and be awkward. PLEASANT SURPRISED and ELATED that the longer segments were so similar to the previous one--but she adds a new moves here and there to make the workout longer. THIS IS BRILLIANT! I've been using this DVD for several months now and have noticed a HUGE difference in my muscle tone. I am 44 and was reluctant to try zumba or too much ""jumping around"" for exercise ... so I decided to try this and have not been disappointed. It is challenging without feeling like you are going to hurt yourself--and you will get results!",1385424000,5,1010,4.554945054945055
3091022,5,B0012KK6QK,"Most of the yoga DVDs I own fit into the ""Power Yoga"" category.  I bought this video for those occasional days when I just feel a little bit tired or lazy, but don't want to blow off doing yoga altogether.  It has filled that need very well, but the pleasant surprise is that some of these practices (particularly the two longer ones in the ""B"" series) actually do make me feel like I've worked hard, albeit in a gentle way.  It's slow and steady, but you do get your heart rate up and your blood flowing.  The practices flow nicely and they all pass what is for me the ultimate test for a yoga practice - they make me feel good!",1383782400,3,629,4.1735537190082646
3091023,5,B0012KK6QK,"This yoga dvd fits my needs exactly... it flows well, the amount of time held is perfect for me at the easier level (there are easier and more difficult level workouts to choose from), it's very relaxing, and centering.  It is my favorite of all yoga dvds. I use it so much, I am thinking of buying another one in case mine gets damaged or worn out.",1381795200,,349,4.208955223880597
3091024,5,B0012KK6QK,"I consider myself an ""experienced"" beginner because I have been practicing yoga off and on for about 15+ years, but because of my age, my bodily limitations, and my lack of consistent practice, I have not been able to advance beyond beginner work. I have practiced with the 38 minute workout and the 36 minute workout on this DVD. Both were easy to follow (granted, I already know most of the names of the poses), and are doable at the end of a long workday. I have not looked at the ""Pose Guide,"" but I imagine that it will help a true beginner who knows almost nothing about yoga. Zyrka Landwijt proceeds at a fairly slow pace and gives thorough verbal cues so that I do not find myself constantly having to look at the DVD to see what she  is doing. I highly recommend it.",1379721600,2,775,4.308219178082192
3091025,5,B0012KK6QK,I own several yoga DVD's and have found Zyrka's to be the ones I like best.  If you are looking for power yoga this probably isn't something you want to buy but if you want a good at home practice that works for beginners to intermediate levels this is for you.  there are 6 different regualr sessions plus more.  A great DVD.,1378425600,,326,4.225806451612903
3091026,4,B0012KK6QK,I like the different segments.  I can do a short segment or make it longer.  I also like the section where she did the different poses and gave great detail about each one.,1377820800,2,172,4.181818181818182
3091027,5,B0012KK6QK,"This is an excellent video for beginner level yoga practice.  Very well paced, excellent guidance and instruction.  Go Zyrka !",1374796800,,126,5.25
3091028,5,B0012KK6QK,"After taking a beginning yoga class, this dvd was the perfect way to continue yoga workouts at home. The pose guide is extremely helpful. The routines are doable but challenging for me because I like to perfect my form (I'm an ex-athlete in my late thirties, fit but not doing handstands or triathlons or anything). I've had lower back problems, and I feel safe doing this workout (as I did not with Kanta Barrios' dvd's) and better afterward. The background music is the best I've heard on a yoga dvd. Landwijt is brilliant--calm, steady, and obviously committed to the spiritual as well as the physical goals of yoga. Her timing of verbal instructions during the flow routines is spot-on.

When I'm sick or just not feeling up to working out, I do Landwijt's ""Gentle Yoga"" dvd, and when my mojo's working I do her ""Yoga Flow:  Saraswati River Tradition"" or Hala Khouri's ""Yoga for Stress Reduction.""

If you are looking to feel more spiritually grounded while improving strength and flexibility, these routines might be perfect for you. If you're using yoga primarily for physical training or if you're motivated by workouts with the words ""boot camp"" in the title, this might be more mellow than you're looking for. But that could be a good thing, too!",1374796800,,1255,4.800925925925926
3091029,5,B0012KK6QK,"The setting for the yoga workout is all outdoors on a platform in the trees. The voice over that guides the exercises is mellow and calm. The single lady that does the poses of the yoga workout is strong, modest, and achieves each pose gracefully. Very gentle flow with a good warm up and cool down. This video would be good for those with disabilities, in recovery of some kind which leaves a weak feeling, those who are needing gentleness and want to feel very mellow and relaxed, even in perfect health. Comes with a couple of different workouts, short and long, and brief instructions on what to do and not do do during yoga practice. Good for beginners to advanced, most enjoyable and rejuvenating.",1372032000,2,703,4.632
3091030,5,B0012KK6QK,I was surprised and glad that 6 exercise programs were in one disc. What a bargain. Not only that each program is excellent. I definety recommend this dvd.,1369094400,,155,4.571428571428571
3091031,5,B0012KK6QK,This is another of Zyrka's DVDs that are wonderfully guiding & flowing & encouraging.  There is something here for every level of Yoga.,1367452800,,135,4.869565217391305
3091032,5,B0012KK6QK,"I once had a yoga instructor in Portland who did this incredible slow stretchy yoga.  It was calming, meditative and when the positions were done correctly, it could also be a mild workout, but the workout wasn't the point, it was a side benefit.  I moved from Portland and have been on a quest ever since for that same wonderful yoga.  Years later I discovered the name of the yoga I was looking for and that was Vinyasa.

This DVD does the best job over anything I've yet found to replicating that incredible instructor I had in portland.

This DVD may not be for you if:
If you're looking for a workout that makes you sweat
If you're new to yoga, you'll have a learning curve (which the dvd provides) to learn the names of the positions.  Flow yoga moves from one position to the next so in any yoga situation you'll be better off knowing the poses.
You want short bursts of exercise you can rush through and then dash out the door (10 minute pilates or yoga as an example).

This DVD may be for you if:
You like AM Rodney but wish you spent more time in a stretch or had a little more variety
You enjoy relaxing stretches
You enjoy taking your time and have the time to take. (shortest session is 36 minutes)

My personal check list of what I was looking for:
Is this Vinyassa or slow/stretchy yoga?  Yes
Is it easy to follow along?  Yes.  Great verbal communication with only a hiccup here or there.  Four to five stars.
Does it have options/mixes?  Yes.  You're purchasing a lot for your money relative to some DVDs out there (looking at you am/pm yoga with great AM but grating pm)
Is the voice relaxing?  Yes, calm female voice.
Pretty/calming background music?  Yes.
Relaxing natural background on video?  Yes.

Series A is easier, Series B is a little more challenging.  You have different time limits to choose from starting about 36 minutes and going up to about an hour for a total of 6 different worksouts.  It includes the meditative cool down time.  The longer the times the more challenging it can become as well (challenge being relative... maybe complex would be the correct term).

The DVD has a video to introduce you to the DVD and yoga.  Also Has a video to introduce you to the poses.

Overall I'm happy and impressed.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  Finding the time to do this will be challenging, but worth it.

The last question some may have is ""how difficult is it?""  That's a difficult questions to answer.  If you're relatively flexible and in moderate shape, this would be an extremely easy dvd.  If you're extremely overweight or inflexible, this could be a little challenging, as are most workouts.  It's filled with long moments in child's pose, 5-10 seconds holding plank, flowing into warrior 1 and 2, cobra, down dog, tree, bridge, mountain and other VERY basic yoga moves with only a couple that might not be completely possible for some until they're more in shape or better balanced (you can go to walls for support if needed as a modification).  Shorter options will be easier and you can work your way into more difficult stretches if needed.

That's about the best I can answer the question.

Anyway, this was fantastic for me.  Hopefully the review helps you decide if this is what you want.",1366761600,22,3244,4.5344827586206895

3091034,5,B0012KK6QK,This Gentle Vinyasa Flow practice is a wonderful addition to anyone's yoga regimen.  The tape quality is excellent.  Pose explanation is superb and easy to follow.  I like the varied routines you can choose from depending on your time constraints.  I have used this tape for over a year now and go to it frequently when choosing a daily Vinyasa type practice.  It is paced well and gives you a wonderful all over stretch on those days when you do not want a rigorous practice.  Easy for beginners and a nice change for the seasoned yogi.  Highly recommend!,1364342400,,556,4.612244897959184

You get all the parts of your body moving and feel amazing after the practice. I had no idea there would be 6 practices with varying levels, so that was another bonus. wish i bought this sooner! Zyrka also explains all the poses really well. Even though I've been doing yoga for yrs, i learned a few things myself.",1361750400,,437,4.27710843373494
3091037,5,B0012KK6QK,"There must be hundreds, if not thousands of yoga DVDs. I have 5 or 6 different ones but none are as good as this one. I  am familiar with yoga from having taken classes over the years but am still a beginner. This has two sets of practice sessions, 3 for beginners and 3 for intermediate (and maybe advanced?). All are well directed in that Landwijt's voiceover tells you exactly how to do each pose, including the breathing and following the practitioner's moves exactly. It's easy to see what's being done so you can follow along and make corrections as necessary. Her voice has a nice rhythm and intonation.
Also, the pace at which the routines are done are not too fast or too slow. Many yoga classes I've attended speed through the exercises and seem to turn it into an athletic competition, which is not in keeping with spirit of yoga, in my opinion. This DVD also has a fair amount of repetition of poses which may be normal for vinyasa yoga. The repetition is also fine with me because I don't want to be jerked from pose to pose without adequate practice in learning each pose.
One other nice aspect of this DVD is a separate section which goes through many of the poses in great detail and sometimes includs props, which are helpful if you have physical problems or your body is not very flexible.
I can see myself using this for quite awhile.",1360886400,2,1353,4.477732793522267

I love the pose guide on the menu, she does a very good job explaining what the pose is and how to do it. The A part video (I have not moved to the B part) is very well done. Zyrka does an excellent job transitioning from one pose to another, describing the pose movements that I could easily listen to her and follow the cues. THAT is a nice touch, for most videos my eyes are glued to the screen to find out what to do next, so I do appreciate being able to truly get into the poses without looking to see if I am right. Overall, this is an excellent product and I am very happy with it.",1360281600,,742,3.888157894736842

3091043,5,B0012KK6QK,"I usually don't write reviews about exercise DVDs because I never connect with them.  This is (usually) especially the case when it comes to yoga or pilates DVDs, to my chagrin.  I could not seem to find a beginner's yoga routine that was like classes I took some years ago.  For me, this is it!  I absolutely LOVE it!  It was gentle (as in the name) and I started to understand how to connect my breath in practice, which I have had difficulty achieving.  My motivation in purchasing this DVD is because I've always wanted to practice yoga on a regular basis.  However, I am a beginner and, on top of that, I am physically unfit due to a sedentary lifestyle (though no health conditions and still young).  This was the first yoga DVD I would look forward to repeating.  I can see how I could improve each time in a low-stress environment without feeling left behind and frustrated.  I started with the 38 minute routine A and it did not feel long at all.  As a side note, I did follow the modified aspects of the routine.  The voiceover was very calming and the practice was easy to follow.  There's no flash here, just a supportive teacher and cleansing yoga practice.  The extras section explaining Vinyasa flow as well as the pose guide are also a major plus.  I recommend watching some of them before beginning.  I will be using this along with walking to get back into physical activity.  I would sincerely recommend this DVD to just about anyone who has a desire to learn yoga!",1344643200,4,1484,4.477611940298507

The music is soothing, the voice gentle non judgemental and pace is just perfect to unwind after a long day and let those muscles relax. I use it every single day and love it. The only reason I gave it one star less is because some scenes freeze for a couple of seconds before moving to the next. I realized after a few times that the recording is that way, easy to think the DVD is not playing right. Can be corrected.",1334793600,7,531,4.066666666666666
3091045,5,B0012KK6QK,"I have been practicing on and off for about 5 years now. There have been times that I have gone to classes several times a week every week, and times I have not practiced at all for several months. I have taken classes from many different instructors, so I feel like I have a good grasp of the options out there for yoga flow.

With that said, I really enjoy this DVD. It is excellent for those times that I have not been practicing and want to ease back into things, when I am sore from other workouts and need some streching, or when I am stressed and need some meditative practice. I think this could also be a good DVD for people transitioning from a very basic beginner DVD where all the poses are explained in great detail.

There is a good amount of information presented, and several times (just like any other instructor) she gave tips and reminders that helped me adjust my poses. I liked that her voice was soft and soothing. I turned the lights in my apartment down, and when I closed my eyes it was like I was in a class and not my living room. She didn't give so much detail to be intrusive, but gave enough direction that since I know many of the poses already I could follow without having to look at the TV constantly, just like in a regular class. She even offered a few modification options for some of the slightly more challenging poses, like a different option for those not ready for or wanting to do a shoulder stand.

The 6 ""classes"" on the DVD vary in length from about 30 minutes to about an hour. Another thing I really like is that there are two series (A and B) and just like with actual classes, the longer sessions use the same basic poses and then add additional ones to build length and level of challenge. Most instructors I have taken multiple classes from have their preferred posses or series that they repeat across several classes, which is what this feels like to me.

Overall, I am extremely glad I bought this DVD. It does what it is intended to do very well. It was exactly what I was hoping for, and is a welcome addition to my rotation.",1333756800,12,2082,4.303571428571429

3091047,5,B0012KK6QK,"Despite now considering myself more ""intermediate"" than ""beginner"", I keep coming back to this video. It's just a beautifully balanced, satisfying routine, with a good range of choices depending on how you're feeling on a particular day. Even with the shortest sequence, you're constantly on the move because of the vinyasa structure, which means that you never cool down too much, or feel that you're slacking. Zyrka's commentary is simple and relaxed, and she restrains herself with the poses, never showing off or making you feel inadequate because you can't match her flexibility or strength. Although I now have a range of more advanced DVD's, I return to this DVD after an illness, or if I'm feeling tired or demotivated.

3091050,5,B0012KK6QK,"I am a total beginner at Yoga and I have been searching for a DVD that could be instructive, focusing on fundamentals and proper form, without getting old after a couple viewings and - at the same time - challenging enough to help me improve my yoga practice.

I am totally happy with this DVD.

The instructor: Zyrka comes across as a calm and knowledgeable teacher. She does her practices alone in a gorgeous setting surrounded by trees. Her soothing, impeccable voiceover cuing and the clear camerawork really allow you to follow along without watching the screen once you get the hang of proper alignment.
As mentioned by other reviewers Zyrka's voice might be a little too spacey at times but personally I do not find that bothering at all.

Routines: This DVD includes 6 routines of varying lengths and difficulty levels.  Each routine builds on the foundation of the prior, shorter routine:
*Series A for Beginners: 38 minutes, 47 minutes and 62 minutes
*Series B for Beginner / Intermediate: 36 minutes, 50 minutes and 64 minutes
Music: The guide background music is a simple but beautiful, piano and flute melody.

Pose Guide. This segment is filmed in a white space. Zyrka gives detailed demonstrations plus tips to maximize benefits. For each pose she discusses alignment, common mistakes, variations, benefits and contraindications. She does not use voiceover cueing in this section.

Here is a breakdown of the poses:

Seated poses: forward fold, bead to knee, bound angle, seated twist, child's pose.

Extended poses: plank, cobra, updog, bridge.

Standing poses: mountain, tree, forward fold, wide leg fold, down dog, warrior one, warrior two, triangle, extended triangle.

Inversion poses: legs up wall, shoulder stand.

Extras Guide. This section includes 3 more features that are especially helpful to beginner yoga practitioners:
*""Vinyasa Guidelines"" demonstrates the connection between movement and breath as you shift from pose-to-pose during a Vinyasa sequence.
*""Breathing practice"" delves into the importance of  proper breathing techniques.
*""Attitude"" is a quick reminder to approach your mat with peace and receptivity to get the most out of your practice.

Positive note to Amazon customers...I bought this Gentle Vinyasa Flow Yoga DVD, on Nov. 6th choosing  the cheapest shipping method (I live in Europe, so shipping charges can be quite expensive...). The expected delivery was December 12... but I received it on November 21st!!
Very pleased with the wonderful service.

3091053,4,B0012KK6QK,"I'm 48, practice intensive strength training and martial arts work BJJ (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu), and am usually sore, getting injured or recovering from an injury.  Two years ago I tried yoga on a whim after a particularly hard workout.  I went into the session unsure of what to expect, but expecting to relax.  I was messed up in my back and hips.  Following the 40 minute routine (Vinyassa?) I was tired.  Amazingly, it hit me hours later, I felt better physically than I had in months.  I told my wife it was as if I'd had the equivalent of ten chiropractic adjustments worth of therapy!  It was amazing!  Fast forward to now: I'm a personal trainer certified in corrective exercise techniques, learning under the likes of Gray Cook and Charlie Weingroff.  These leading experts on...well...""fixing"" athletes both relate how properly done Yoga is phenomenal at reconnecting the body and autonomic functions together.  I'm a huge Yoga believer now.  For this DVD I needed something I could do at home since making it to Yoga sessions in town has become difficult.  I needed something relaxing, not a workout (I get plenty of sweating in BJJ classes).  This DVD and the voice (Zyrka?) is beautiful and simple...in fact I just finished my night of the beginner 36 minute session.  Going into the session I was hurting, left leg numb and right arm numb with my back aching from a particularly tough night of class.  I honestly didn't expect to get much ""help"" from the Yoga session, simple as it is, but again: WOW.  I feel so much better!  Amazing!  None of my own stretching, twisting or other movements helped, but this gentle soothing session did.  And as another reviewer wrote, Zyrka's voice-over is just so amazingly soothing and almost magically calm that I can't describe it.  Her voice alone makes the session so wonderful.

My only complaint, if you will, is the speed of transition in some of the routines.  It makes a number of the stretches/poses transition at a rate much faster than one can synch with breathing (4 sec in/out) so there is a rushed sensation at times.  This may be because she's narrating and the timing doesn't match well?  IF the sequences would allow for a full inhale/exhale at all the positions, the DVD would get six (6) stars from me. As it is, it loses one.  It is almost trivial but, seriously, that is the only ""hit"" I can give.  I will be looking for other DVDs from Zyrka.  If she has a meditation sequence, I will definitely get that--her voice, cadence and just....personality...carry through and would keep me focused and relaxed enough to put my ADD away and actually meditate!  Hope this helps :-)",1318291200,16,2643,4.724288840262582

3091055,3,B0012KK6QK,"This is a great DVD for beginners and those who need an intro to some yoga poses.  The routines themselves aren't too challenging except for maybe some things like shoulder stand.

I am new to yoga but I was looking for a DVD with a bit more challenge.  This DVD would be excellent for the evenings, to stretch you out and clear your mind.

One thing to note though... the voice over (I'm assuming this is Zyrka) is...  interesting.  I'm not sure why she does this but she tends to streeeeeetch out words, I guess in an attempt to relax you?  It sounds like ""exhaaaaaaaling as you lift...  inhaaaaaaaling into cobra....""  It's kind of annoying.  I'll keep this DVD for days (or evenings) when I want a more mellow practice, but I don't know if it will ever become a favorite in my collection.

Also lots of repeat footage.  There are three beginner practices of different lengths and three more advanced practices also of different lengths.  These aren't 6 separate practices, they are different lengths because parts of the practices are repeated in each of the 6 practices, and new sequences are added on for length.

3091057,5,B0012KK6QK,"The most valuable part of this DVD is the Pose Guide section.  Zyrka Landwijt has the ability to clearly describe each pose from start to finish.  The DVD is very similar to attending a group Yoga class.  Her presentation shows an in-depth knowledge of the body and of teaching Yoga.  Concentrate on each of the poses in the Pose Guide until you know each one, then try one of the short, easy Yoga sequences.  A beginner's Yoga course will spend most of the course teaching individual poses.  The Yoga sequences usually come later.  I find it valuable to sometimes just watch the Pose Guide section without doing them to allow the instruction to sink in.

A note to beginners: Take a short Yoga course locally to get an understanding of terms used and what the specific directions mean.  Yoga is more than an exercise.

Using Zyrka Landwijt's Yoga DVDs will get you quickly to the point of taking Yoga courses for corrections and refinements of your asanas within sequences, rather than just learning poses.",1301270400,5,1007,4.735632183908046

Of course a real live class is better.  2 series (A & B), with three lengths of each series (6 options) makes this very useful.  Series B is a bit tougher than series A.  There is a 7th section that explains each pose and common mistakes, which is nice for beginners.  I am a hefty guy with a few years (4) yoga experience, including classes. I get a lot of benefit from these videos. I will recommend to some of my similarly sized friends.  Athletes may want a tougher workout than this.",1292198400,7,563,4.355769230769231

Played the DVD as soon as I got it and listened through the introduction.  It was ok.  But as soon as the routine started, I hated it.  Not the routine itself, which was very easy to follow but the voice-over narration and the narrator.

As I have a slight hearing difficulty, I found it difficult to hear what was being said... unless I play it really LOUD and then it would be too distracting to practice.  Add to that, the narrator likes to ""stretch"" certain words to emphasise them such as ""sweeeeeeeeep"" your hands ""aalllllll"" (all) the way ""doowwwnnn"" (down)..... in an almost melodic tone.

I guess this is what is meant by ""gentle"" voice but the style of narration simply did not suit me.",1290211200,11,732,4.5

It's very easy to follow with great instruction as you go, making it less about worrying that you have the pose right and enabling you to really flow with the movements/poses and experience the breath - which is really what I always thought Yoga was about.  You don't feel rushed or pressured to be fabulously pretzel like. : )  There is soothing piano based music low in the background which helps put you in a relaxed and focused state.  it doesn't feel like hard work as your doing it - as some other yoga videos I've tried do - and yet when you're finished, you feel invigorated, (like you've really worked your body), and at the same time very aligned and relaxed.  The instructor, Zyrka, has a very calm and soothing way about her as she directs you through the poses and breathing. Tthe way she tells you what to focus on during each pose helped me understand and feel the poses in a way I hadn't before.  The outdoor scenery is also lovely to look at and yet not distracting.  One of the other things i love about this DVD is that there are 6 different yoga routines to choose from, depending on how much time you have that day and how much energy you have.  There's an ""A"" series and a ""B"" series - each with 3 different lengths of routines ranging from 35 minutes to around 65 minutes fora more complete yoga workout.  There's even a pose guide that shows and discusses the different poses and breathing practice etc.

This is not a video for a total pro looking to advance their technique and stamina, but for someone looking to get into Yoga or for someone like myself who enjoys lots of different types of exercise, this is a great addition to your weekly routine if you'd like to add Yoga to the mix. I'm about to buy this for several of my friends!

I look forward to my new afternoon ritual, which can be as short as just over a half hour or maximized to over an hour. I enjoy the repetition of the practice and can feel more flexibility.",1266192000,4,399,4.405405405405405
3091068,5,B0012KK6QK,"I just got this dvd the other day and, for me, it is the best yoga dvd that I own.  The pace is easy, but perfect with clear instruction.  My other yoga dvd's are more strenuous and energetic and not what I want all the time.  If you are looking for good vinyasa flow routines that are easy to follow, gentle and move from one movement to the other in a slower fashion, you will love this.",1265846400,3,389,4.025974025974026
3091069,3,B0012KK6QK,"I had initially ordered this DVD with two ideas in mind.  One, to have a nice relaxing and gentle practice on my days off from my major exercise, or even to do after my regular exercise for flexibility and stretching.  The second to learn Flow yoga better before trying Shiva Rea's more advanced style.

I tried this DVD today. It was certainly better than the first DVD, but after so many downward facing dogs, I was starting to get bored with this one too.  She narrates as if she is reading a book for a 5 year old (one other reviewer also mentioned her narration style, only I was not able to get past it like the other reviewer was).  I made it about half way through the shorter intermediate routine, and then stopped. Zyrka's style is very much instructional, which I also find boring.  As I tried her first DVD and this one, she makes me feel like yoga is drudgery, something I have to get through.  There is no feeling of joy or that yoga can be a pleasant thing.

I also have the impression many of the reviewers are hard-core yoga followers, and that this DVD may offer something for them to get ""deeper into their practice"".  I am not a hard-core yoga follower. For me, I exercise on regular basis (elliptical, brisk walking, strength, flexibility, stretching), so yoga is simply something that complements the other fitness activities I do.  I do understand getting a better understanding of the poses or breathing with yoga, but this DVD didn't do that for me.

If you are like me, and do not like Zyrka's style, and are in reasonably good shape but still fairly new to yoga, you may find Shiva Rea's Beginner's Flow yoga a better alternative. If you are very out of shape or are a couch potato, then Zyrka's beginner flows are probably more appropriate. For me, Shiva makes yoga a joyful experience, and something I should enjoy doing. It was much more appropriate for me.

One other comment on the Pose Guide on Zyrka's DVDs. It is a nice add, although I think it would be very difficult to watch the whole thing from start to finish.  I have another yoga DVD that also has a guide but this guide is interactive.  Meaning that while you are going through the practice, when a new pose is introduced the name of the pose is flashed up on the screen. You have a few seconds where you can press enter on your remote control and it will bring up the practice guide for that particular pose so you can view it while you are doing it. It then returns back to the practice and you continue on.  I think this kind of guide is much more usable.",1262131200,19,2551,4.397872340425532
3091070,5,B0012KK6QK,I am so pleased with this DVD!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  I bought three different DVDs from three different instructors and this is the only one I love.  The 23 pose lessons are wonderful for beginners or reminders for those of us who know these asanas.  Routines are true Vinyasa Flow just like we do in class.  Great to have at home when I can't make it to the studio.  LOVE this!,1256860800,3,396,4.144736842105263
3091071,5,B0012KK6QK,"I just love this video.  I read all the reviews and researched other videos before I purchased this one, and I'm very happy with my choice.

I really love that she holds the poses long enough to really feel them and get the most from them.  I've been practicing for years, and enjoy vinyasa flow, but I do think many just go too darn fast, most of the time. I do not like running at all, too jarring; I have plenty of endurance though, so I prefer hiking to running - sometimes it seems like I can go up and down hill forever; so a slower vinyasa really works best for me. Keeping this in mind, I would love to see her do another video, one with the same pace, but a little more challenging, if that's possible.  This video is extremely well done, it's cued and timed just right, the instructor makes me want to come back again.  It even has a pose I never do - gate pose, so I enjoy that also.

The routine keeps you working, and here in Arizona in the summer, yeah, I do sweat a bit - a lot.  I recommended this to my sister, who just came to yoga several years ago, I think she'd really benefit from it, and now she's going to buy it too.  This is a wonderful workout for someone who has tried yoga, and is ready to move on to something different, to work their body in new ways without stressing it out too much.  Or like me, who has done yoga quite a bit, but had a sore spot on the lower back, and am using this to recoup with.  I really can't find fault at all with this one.  It just seems to work me the way I need worked at this time - can't go wrong with that.",1252886400,16,1571,3.9713375796178343
3091072,5,B0012KK6QK,"This DVD is for beginners to intermediate yoga practioners.

Pros:

Very comprehensive review section for poses
Easy to navigate
Wonderful voice over
Fun and effective routines

Cons:

Examples of the use of props in the review section as they would be used during the flow would have been helpful

Bottom line:

I own several yoga DVDs. This and ""Yoga for Well Being"" are my favorites and what I use near daily. Unless you are an advanced yoga practioner, I think you will have a hard time, if you even can, finding a better slow vinyasa flow DVD.",1250985600,5,548,4.597938144329897
3091073,5,B0012KK6QK,"First let me say I am a novice yogi.  I've taken a couple of classes which I have loved but due to scheduling conflicts was unable to continue them.  So I set out to find a video that could compare to the incredible teacher I had.  This video comes pretty darn close!  While there is really nothing like the real thing, Zyrka is an excellent teacher.  Her voice is mellow & soothing, her prompts are in just the right spots & her moves are easy to follow.  I love that the setting is outdoors, very calming, as is the background music.

The video is divided into 2 levels with three different lengths in each level for a total of 6 workouts.  There is also an excellent pose guide that goes thru each pose in detail to help you perfect your poses.  Even if you are more experienced than I am, I would think it would be refreshing to return to the basics & maybe refine your style.

I also love her focus on integrating breath with the movement & including meditation at the beginning & end of each workout.  They have set it up so Zyrka gets you nice & relaxed at the end & then the main menu kicks on with music calming and soothing enough you can continue your meditation without feeling the need to turn it off.

All in all an excellent video, I did a lot of research on here & other sites, painstakingly reading reviews.  I am very happy with my choice & I highly recommend it to any level yogi.",1248739200,19,1399,4.214285714285714
3091074,3,B0012KK6QK,"The video was well made, very relaxing, wonderful scenery, very soothing, and very easy. Based on other reviews, I knew this cd would be easy and I wanted something that I could do on days when I was feeling sluggish and not wanting a heavy-duty workout. This cd, however, was a bit too easy for my semi-intermediate yoga experience. This is great for novices. It's very well done, but not a strenuous workout.",1248048000,14,410,4.63013698630137
3091075,5,B0012KK6QK,"Great for beginner/advanced beginner and someone their 50's like me!  After being sorely disappointed with the Restorative Yoga DVD by Neaman,  I was pleasantly surprised by how this yoga session was very close to my own Vinyasa instructors at the local yoga center!  Very well explained without being boring nor too wordy...Zyrka is accompanied by a quiet, meditative background music that allows both your mind and body to thoroughly unwind!  In the past, i have been plagued by shoulder bursitis and severely herniated back disc, but this type of easy core stretching & strengthening has actually been more beneficial for me than the physical therapy sessions prescribed by my doctor!  Also, just as Zryka states, if a position is uncomfortable, to use her alternative position!  A great way to remain flexible and release tension!",1243036800,6,834,5.186567164179104
3091076,5,B0012KK6QK,"The instructor in this video is excellent.  I haven't worked up from the first program, but I really like the fact that there are two levels with three programs apiece so that I can work up to a more challenging practice.  Substitutions are often suggested, and if you are interested in more in-depth information about a pose, there is a whole pose guide with variations and tips on proper posture.  The music is soothing and non-obtrusive, and the setting is very pretty, but not distracting.  I highly recommend this to anyone, but I think it's a good idea for any first-timers to go to at least one yoga class in person, because we're often unaware of exactly what our bodies are doing at first.",1236643200,6,698,4.604838709677419
3325477,5,B0012KK6QK,"This DVD is one of the better yoga DVDs I've tried.

First it has an extensive library to explain the poses, which everyone, whether a beginner or a more advanced practitioner, should watch before starting.  The explanations are given in simple, understandable and clear words.

Second, the sequences are indeed gentle vinyasa flows.  The sessions are divided into 2 series depending on one's practice level and experience, and each is divided further into 3 practices with different times.

Third, the flows are simple, doable flows that anyone serious enough to do some exercise can do. To those who want to pretend they are exercising while not stressing your body, this is not the DVD for you.  Although one may not sweat with the program, the body nonetheless is doing yoga.  The flow is not hurried at all but relaxing.  It is a wonderful stretching program for athletes.

Fourth, the instructions are given in a clear soothing voice.  Admittedly, I initially found the tone of Ms. Landwijt's voice a little bit patronizing, as if she were speaking to a 5 year old child.  However, I got past it as I assumed that she modulated her voice and manner of speaking to suit her program's intention of providing a gentle yoga practice.

Fifth, the camera work is great because you see every step and movement that you need to see.  There is no confusion as to what you are supposed to do next.

Lastly, I like the fact that she definitely tells you that the practice has ended so you don't have to get out of your shavasana in order to see if the practice is over.

I don't know if this is Ms. Landwijt's debut DVD but it's good work.",1232323200,16,1634,4.6055363321799305

Excellent for beginners-advanced-really worth every penny. The production is amazing too. This is first rate...get it, you won't be sorry! I am so impressed!",1222732800,8,422,5.313432835820896

You can choose from 6 workouts ranging in length from 36 minutes to an hour.  Highly recommended.",1209859200,25,389,4.514285714285714

There are 6 practices - levels A and B both have practices of around half an hour, three quarters of an hour, and an hour.  I've tried 2 of the level A practices so far, even though I'm not a beginner, and really liked them. They are gentle vinyasa, but one does work.  Very thorough and well taught work...  The extra chapters on individual poses are extremely well done also.

I love this dvd.  The day after a weights workout I find it impossible to do power yoga.  This is great without being too easy.  Tones and stretches every part of your body and as a great bonus the shavasana is a yoga nidra which leaves me feeling totally mellow, relaxed and revived.

Oh, and the instructor besides clearly knowing her stuff has a very nice and mellow voice.

3325482,5,B0012KK6QK,"Yoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flow with Zyrka Landwijt is my favorite vinyasa DVD. Filmed against the backdrop of beautiful Santa Barbara treetops, Zyrka teaches with precision and grace. She guides the student through the poses via voice-over using her gentle and soothing voice. Her detailed instructions allow the student to follow along without keeping their eyes glued to the television (a frequent complaint of most yoga DVDs). That said, you will want to view the entire practice at least once, to soak in the beauty of the poses and scenery! Another important fact is that this DVD is gently infused with yogic philosophy and does not contain the lectures that punctuate most yoga DVDs.

The DVD includes an Introduction by Zyrka, Pose Guide (23 poses), and 6 workouts ranging from 36 to 64 minutes long.",1206662400,97,803,4.992537313432836
3325483,5,B0012KK6QK,"Too many user reviews base their star-ratings on how well the program met their expectations - you find 1 and 2 star reviews followed by complaints that the program was too hard for them, or too easy, or the music wasn't to their taste, or that the seller left mustard stains on the case; but little insight into the actual program quality.  I will state at the outset that this program was not as challenging as I would have liked - but it helped me realize that I've made progress in my form, stamina, and willingness to extend, and it benefited me in other ways.

However, after trying both the a and b series, I can honestly say that this DVD lives up to its billing. It deserves a perfect rating for what it offers, and the care with which it is produced. I would recommend it to anyone looking to extend their beginner lessons into something more flowing, but preferring to avoid the more intense power vinyasa DVDs, or the more chatty and motivational instructors. It is gentle, meditative vinyasa, and despite the relative lack of challenge, it was very well-taught, in a pleasant, unobtrusive setting; a patient, clear verbal tone; well-demonstrated by a graceful and modest instructor; and it left me both relaxed and limber.

The pose guide would be a great resource for a beginner, and tipped me off to a few things I'd become sloppy with.  For a near-beginner or advanced-beginner, I think this DVD, with its mix of programs and lengths, offers a fine build-up to a more intense practice.  It is also a fine alternative for more experienced practitioners on blah days, needing a balance of meditative and physical, or nursing minor injuries.  For true beginners: please take some classes and learn your basics with feedback from a live instructor, then supplement with a DVD such as this.  For the rest: always go back to classes for live tune-ups - there is always something to be gained or improved from the eyes and skills of a good instructor.",1205107200,343,1960,4.680232558139535

The A routine's have 3 time's to chose from and I was sticking with the lowest length of time until I tried the 62 minute routine. Now I do it every single night. My husband who wasn't a ""yoga person"" has been converted. People get the idea that because you aren't sweating buckets that you are working. Well let me just tell you that my body literally craves this video because of the stretching and lengthening benefits. I have only tried the B routine once because it's faster paced.",1389312000,,559,4.384615384615385

3325517,4,B0012KK6QK,"1st let me state...this should be an easy 5 start rating. I will explain why I gave it 4.
I am pretty new to Yoga about 4 months into my practice and no doubt I am hooked! I have bought about 5 beginner DVD's, most from the ""big name"" Yoga rock stars. NONE of them is near as good as this DVD for a beginner, period end of story.

1. the dvd is broken into 2 practices, A&B. Both A&B have 3 sequences, 37, 47, 62 minutes and each build off the next. A being where you start and learn the basics and get a good workout at the same time. B kicks it up a notch in both complexity and intensity.
  2. Zyrka's guidance through each pose and each workout is simply incredible! Instruction and pace are spot on, options are offered if needed...the full package.
3. Her style of yoga, the way she teaches the movements and breath are like moving meditation.

The reason I gave this 4 stars not 5 is the way she ends each workout. Yoga is a by it's nature a great starting point for meditation and the ending pose is for relaxation and meditation. She just blew it here. She talks your breath into each body part and it is simply way to much talk. If she remade this DVD with a ""stiller"" more meditative resting pose I would re buy it!

That being said, if you are looking for a true teacher that can get you hooked on Yoga...this is the dvd!",1386374400,5,1333,4.111538461538461
3325518,5,B0012KK6QK,"I was new to yoga and this DVD was just PERFECT! I love her voice (soothing, calming and her instructions are spot on). So many choices of segments and different lengths of workouts. Noticed others complained about the increasing times being the workout before with some moves added in to add length of time. I LOVED THAT--after I ""mastered"" the first segment, I was hesitant to move to the next (longer) segment b/c I didn't want to learn a brand new routine all over again and be awkward. PLEASANT SURPRISED and ELATED that the longer segments were so similar to the previous one--but she adds a new moves here and there to make the workout longer. THIS IS BRILLIANT! I've been using this DVD for several months now and have noticed a HUGE difference in my muscle tone. I am 44 and was reluctant to try zumba or too much ""jumping around"" for exercise ... so I decided to try this and have not been disappointed. It is challenging without feeling like you are going to hurt yourself--and you will get results!",1385424000,5,1010,4.554945054945055

I bought this video for those occasional days when I just feel a little bit tired or lazy, but don't want to blow off doing yoga altogether.  It has filled that need very well, but the pleasant surprise is that some of these practices (particularly the two longer ones in the ""B"" series) actually do make me feel like I've worked hard, albeit in a gentle way.  It's slow and steady, but you do get your heart rate up and your blood flowing.  The practices flow nicely and they all pass what is for me the ultimate test for a yoga practice - they make me feel good!",1383782400,3,629,4.1735537190082646

I have practiced with the 38 minute workout and the 36 minute workout on this DVD. Both were easy to follow (granted, I already know most of the names of the poses), and are doable at the end of a long workday. I have not looked at the ""Pose Guide,"" but I imagine that it will help a true beginner who knows almost nothing about yoga. Zyrka Landwijt proceeds at a fairly slow pace and gives thorough verbal cues so that I do not find myself constantly having to look at the DVD to see what she  is doing.

3325525,5,B0012KK6QK,"After taking a beginning yoga class, this dvd was the perfect way to continue yoga workouts at home. The pose guide is extremely helpful. The routines are doable but challenging for me because I like to perfect my form (I'm an ex-athlete in my late thirties, fit but not doing handstands or triathlons or anything). I've had lower back problems, and I feel safe doing this workout (as I did not with Kanta Barrios' dvd's) and better afterward. The background music is the best I've heard on a yoga dvd. Landwijt is brilliant--calm, steady, and obviously committed to the spiritual as well as the physical goals of yoga. Her timing of verbal instructions during the flow routines is spot-on.

When I'm sick or just not feeling up to working out, I do Landwijt's ""Gentle Yoga"" dvd, and when my mojo's working I do her ""Yoga Flow:  Saraswati River Tradition"" or Hala Khouri's ""Yoga for Stress Reduction.""

If you are looking to feel more spiritually grounded while improving strength and flexibility, these routines might be perfect for you. If you're using yoga primarily for physical training or if you're motivated by workouts with the words ""boot camp"" in the title, this might be more mellow than you're looking for. But that could be a good thing, too!",1374796800,,1255,4.800925925925926

The single lady that does the poses of the yoga workout is strong, modest, and achieves each pose gracefully. Very gentle flow with a good warm up and cool down. This video would be good for those with disabilities, in recovery of some kind which leaves a weak feeling, those who are needing gentleness and want to feel very mellow and relaxed, even in perfect health. Comes with a couple of different workouts, short and long, and brief instructions on what to do and not do do during yoga practice. Good for beginners to advanced, most enjoyable and rejuvenating.",1372032000,2,703,4.632

3325529,5,B0012KK6QK,"I once had a yoga instructor in Portland who did this incredible slow stretchy yoga.  It was calming, meditative and when the positions were done correctly, it could also be a mild workout, but the workout wasn't the point, it was a side benefit.  I moved from Portland and have been on a quest ever since for that same wonderful yoga.  Years later I discovered the name of the yoga I was looking for and that was Vinyasa.

This DVD does the best job over anything I've yet found to replicating that incredible instructor I had in portland.

This DVD may not be for you if:
If you're looking for a workout that makes you sweat
If you're new to yoga, you'll have a learning curve (which the dvd provides) to learn the names of the positions.  Flow yoga moves from one position to the next so in any yoga situation you'll be better off knowing the poses.
You want short bursts of exercise you can rush through and then dash out the door (10 minute pilates or yoga as an example).

This DVD may be for you if:
You like AM Rodney but wish you spent more time in a stretch or had a little more variety
You enjoy relaxing stretches
You enjoy taking your time and have the time to take. (shortest session is 36 minutes)

My personal check list of what I was looking for:
Is this Vinyassa or slow/stretchy yoga?  Yes
Is it easy to follow along?  Yes.  Great verbal communication with only a hiccup here or there.  Four to five stars.
Does it have options/mixes?  Yes.  You're purchasing a lot for your money relative to some DVDs out there (looking at you am/pm yoga with great AM but grating pm)
Is the voice relaxing?  Yes, calm female voice.
Pretty/calming background music?  Yes.
Relaxing natural background on video?  Yes.

Series A is easier, Series B is a little more challenging.  You have different time limits to choose from starting about 36 minutes and going up to about an hour for a total of 6 different worksouts.  It includes the meditative cool down time.  The longer the times the more challenging it can become as well (challenge being relative... maybe complex would be the correct term).

The DVD has a video to introduce you to the DVD and yoga.  Also Has a video to introduce you to the poses.

Overall I'm happy and impressed.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  Finding the time to do this will be challenging, but worth it.

The last question some may have is ""how difficult is it?""  That's a difficult questions to answer.  If you're relatively flexible and in moderate shape, this would be an extremely easy dvd.  If you're extremely overweight or inflexible, this could be a little challenging, as are most workouts.  It's filled with long moments in child's pose, 5-10 seconds holding plank, flowing into warrior 1 and 2, cobra, down dog, tree, bridge, mountain and other VERY basic yoga moves with only a couple that might not be completely possible for some until they're more in shape or better balanced (you can go to walls for support if needed as a modification).  Shorter options will be easier and you can work your way into more difficult stretches if needed.

That's about the best I can answer the question.

Anyway, this was fantastic for me.  Hopefully the review helps you decide if this is what you want.",1366761600,22,3244,4.5344827586206895

I like the varied routines you can choose from depending on your time constraints.  I have used this tape for over a year now and go to it frequently when choosing a daily Vinyasa type practice.  It is paced well and gives you a wonderful all over stretch on those days when you do not want a rigorous practice.  Easy for beginners and a nice change for the seasoned yogi.

You get all the parts of your body moving and feel amazing after the practice. I had no idea there would be 6 practices with varying levels, so that was another bonus. wish i bought this sooner!

3325534,5,B0012KK6QK,"There must be hundreds, if not thousands of yoga DVDs. I have 5 or 6 different ones but none are as good as this one. I  am familiar with yoga from having taken classes over the years but am still a beginner. This has two sets of practice sessions, 3 for beginners and 3 for intermediate (and maybe advanced?). All are well directed in that Landwijt's voiceover tells you exactly how to do each pose, including the breathing and following the practitioner's moves exactly. It's easy to see what's being done so you can follow along and make corrections as necessary. Her voice has a nice rhythm and intonation.
Also, the pace at which the routines are done are not too fast or too slow. Many yoga classes I've attended speed through the exercises and seem to turn it into an athletic competition, which is not in keeping with spirit of yoga, in my opinion. This DVD also has a fair amount of repetition of poses which may be normal for vinyasa yoga. The repetition is also fine with me because I don't want to be jerked from pose to pose without adequate practice in learning each pose.
One other nice aspect of this DVD is a separate section which goes through many of the poses in great detail and sometimes includs props, which are helpful if you have physical problems or your body is not very flexible.
I can see myself using this for quite awhile.",1360886400,2,1353,4.477732793522267

I love the pose guide on the menu, she does a very good job explaining what the pose is and how to do it. The A part video (I have not moved to the B part) is very well done. Zyrka does an excellent job transitioning from one pose to another, describing the pose movements that I could easily listen to her and follow the cues. THAT is a nice touch, for most videos my eyes are glued to the screen to find out what to do next, so I do appreciate being able to truly get into the poses without looking to see if I am right.

3325540,5,B0012KK6QK,"I usually don't write reviews about exercise DVDs because I never connect with them.  This is (usually) especially the case when it comes to yoga or pilates DVDs, to my chagrin.  I could not seem to find a beginner's yoga routine that was like classes I took some years ago.  For me, this is it!  I absolutely LOVE it!  It was gentle (as in the name) and I started to understand how to connect my breath in practice, which I have had difficulty achieving.  My motivation in purchasing this DVD is because I've always wanted to practice yoga on a regular basis.  However, I am a beginner and, on top of that, I am physically unfit due to a sedentary lifestyle (though no health conditions and still young).  This was the first yoga DVD I would look forward to repeating.  I can see how I could improve each time in a low-stress environment without feeling left behind and frustrated.  I started with the 38 minute routine A and it did not feel long at all.  As a side note, I did follow the modified aspects of the routine.  The voiceover was very calming and the practice was easy to follow.  There's no flash here, just a supportive teacher and cleansing yoga practice.  The extras section explaining Vinyasa flow as well as the pose guide are also a major plus.  I recommend watching some of them before beginning.  I will be using this along with walking to get back into physical activity.

The only reason I gave it one star less is because some scenes freeze for a couple of seconds before moving to the next.

3325542,5,B0012KK6QK,"I have been practicing on and off for about 5 years now. There have been times that I have gone to classes several times a week every week, and times I have not practiced at all for several months. I have taken classes from many different instructors, so I feel like I have a good grasp of the options out there for yoga flow.

With that said, I really enjoy this DVD. It is excellent for those times that I have not been practicing and want to ease back into things, when I am sore from other workouts and need some streching, or when I am stressed and need some meditative practice. I think this could also be a good DVD for people transitioning from a very basic beginner DVD where all the poses are explained in great detail.

There is a good amount of information presented, and several times (just like any other instructor) she gave tips and reminders that helped me adjust my poses. I liked that her voice was soft and soothing. I turned the lights in my apartment down, and when I closed my eyes it was like I was in a class and not my living room. She didn't give so much detail to be intrusive, but gave enough direction that since I know many of the poses already I could follow without having to look at the TV constantly, just like in a regular class. She even offered a few modification options for some of the slightly more challenging poses, like a different option for those not ready for or wanting to do a shoulder stand.

The 6 ""classes"" on the DVD vary in length from about 30 minutes to about an hour. Another thing I really like is that there are two series (A and B) and just like with actual classes, the longer sessions use the same basic poses and then add additional ones to build length and level of challenge. Most instructors I have taken multiple classes from have their preferred posses or series that they repeat across several classes, which is what this feels like to me.

Overall, I am extremely glad I bought this DVD. It does what it is intended to do very well. It was exactly what I was hoping for, and is a welcome addition to my rotation.",1333756800,12,2082,4.303571428571429

It's just a beautifully balanced, satisfying routine, with a good range of choices depending on how you're feeling on a particular day. Even with the shortest sequence, you're constantly on the move because of the vinyasa structure, which means that you never cool down too much, or feel that you're slacking. Zyrka's commentary is simple and relaxed, and she restrains herself with the poses, never showing off or making you feel inadequate because you can't match her flexibility or strength. Although I now have a range of more advanced DVD's, I return to this DVD after an illness, or if I'm feeling tired or demotivated.

3325547,5,B0012KK6QK,"I am a total beginner at Yoga and I have been searching for a DVD that could be instructive, focusing on fundamentals and proper form, without getting old after a couple viewings and - at the same time - challenging enough to help me improve my yoga practice.

I am totally happy with this DVD.

The instructor: Zyrka comes across as a calm and knowledgeable teacher. She does her practices alone in a gorgeous setting surrounded by trees. Her soothing, impeccable voiceover cuing and the clear camerawork really allow you to follow along without watching the screen once you get the hang of proper alignment.
As mentioned by other reviewers Zyrka's voice might be a little too spacey at times but personally I do not find that bothering at all.

Routines: This DVD includes 6 routines of varying lengths and difficulty levels.  Each routine builds on the foundation of the prior, shorter routine:
*Series A for Beginners: 38 minutes, 47 minutes and 62 minutes
*Series B for Beginner / Intermediate: 36 minutes, 50 minutes and 64 minutes
Music: The guide background music is a simple but beautiful, piano and flute melody.

Pose Guide. This segment is filmed in a white space. Zyrka gives detailed demonstrations plus tips to maximize benefits. For each pose she discusses alignment, common mistakes, variations, benefits and contraindications. She does not use voiceover cueing in this section.

Here is a breakdown of the poses:

Seated poses: forward fold, bead to knee, bound angle, seated twist, child's pose.

Extended poses: plank, cobra, updog, bridge.

Standing poses: mountain, tree, forward fold, wide leg fold, down dog, warrior one, warrior two, triangle, extended triangle.

Inversion poses: legs up wall, shoulder stand.

Extras Guide. This section includes 3 more features that are especially helpful to beginner yoga practitioners:
*""Vinyasa Guidelines"" demonstrates the connection between movement and breath as you shift from pose-to-pose during a Vinyasa sequence.
*""Breathing practice"" delves into the importance of  proper breathing techniques.
*""Attitude"" is a quick reminder to approach your mat with peace and receptivity to get the most out of your practice.

Positive note to Amazon customers...I bought this Gentle Vinyasa Flow Yoga DVD, on Nov. 6th choosing  the cheapest shipping method (I live in Europe, so shipping charges can be quite expensive...). The expected delivery was December 12... but I received it on November 21st!!
Very pleased with the wonderful service.

3325550,4,B0012KK6QK,"I'm 48, practice intensive strength training and martial arts work BJJ (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu), and am usually sore, getting injured or recovering from an injury.  Two years ago I tried yoga on a whim after a particularly hard workout.  I went into the session unsure of what to expect, but expecting to relax.  I was messed up in my back and hips.  Following the 40 minute routine (Vinyassa?) I was tired.  Amazingly, it hit me hours later, I felt better physically than I had in months.  I told my wife it was as if I'd had the equivalent of ten chiropractic adjustments worth of therapy!  It was amazing!  Fast forward to now: I'm a personal trainer certified in corrective exercise techniques, learning under the likes of Gray Cook and Charlie Weingroff.  These leading experts on...well...""fixing"" athletes both relate how properly done Yoga is phenomenal at reconnecting the body and autonomic functions together.  I'm a huge Yoga believer now.  For this DVD I needed something I could do at home since making it to Yoga sessions in town has become difficult.  I needed something relaxing, not a workout (I get plenty of sweating in BJJ classes).  This DVD and the voice (Zyrka?) is beautiful and simple...in fact I just finished my night of the beginner 36 minute session.  Going into the session I was hurting, left leg numb and right arm numb with my back aching from a particularly tough night of class.  I honestly didn't expect to get much ""help"" from the Yoga session, simple as it is, but again: WOW.  I feel so much better!  Amazing!  None of my own stretching, twisting or other movements helped, but this gentle soothing session did.  And as another reviewer wrote, Zyrka's voice-over is just so amazingly soothing and almost magically calm that I can't describe it.  Her voice alone makes the session so wonderful.

My only complaint, if you will, is the speed of transition in some of the routines.  It makes a number of the stretches/poses transition at a rate much faster than one can synch with breathing (4 sec in/out) so there is a rushed sensation at times.  This may be because she's narrating and the timing doesn't match well?  IF the sequences would allow for a full inhale/exhale at all the positions, the DVD would get six (6) stars from me. As it is, it loses one.  It is almost trivial but, seriously, that is the only ""hit"" I can give.  I will be looking for other DVDs from Zyrka.  If she has a meditation sequence, I will definitely get that--her voice, cadence and just....personality...carry through and would keep me focused and relaxed enough to put my ADD away and actually meditate!  Hope this helps :-)",1318291200,16,2643,4.724288840262582
3325551,5,B0012KK6QK,I was looking for a DVD to replicate my beginner vinyasa flow yoga class and am very happy with my choice.  I like to ability to choose from 6 different class levels and durations.,1318204800,4,180,4.294117647058823
3325552,3,B0012KK6QK,"This is a great DVD for beginners and those who need an intro to some yoga poses.  The routines themselves aren't too challenging except for maybe some things like shoulder stand.

I am new to yoga but I was looking for a DVD with a bit more challenge.  This DVD would be excellent for the evenings, to stretch you out and clear your mind.

One thing to note though... the voice over (I'm assuming this is Zyrka) is...  interesting.  I'm not sure why she does this but she tends to streeeeeetch out words, I guess in an attempt to relax you?  It sounds like ""exhaaaaaaaling as you lift...  inhaaaaaaaling into cobra....""  It's kind of annoying.  I'll keep this DVD for days (or evenings) when I want a more mellow practice, but I don't know if it will ever become a favorite in my collection.

Also lots of repeat footage.  There are three beginner practices of different lengths and three more advanced practices also of different lengths.  These aren't 6 separate practices, they are different lengths because parts of the practices are repeated in each of the 6 practices, and new sequences are added on for length.  Just an FYI.",1318118400,9,1132,4.623115577889447
3325553,4,B0012KK6QK,"Great dvd.  Zyrka is very soothing and does great with the transitions.  This is really gentle, almost too gentle to feel like you are getting a workout.  Great for beginners!",1317600000,4,175,4.766666666666667
3325554,5,B0012KK6QK,"The most valuable part of this DVD is the Pose Guide section.  Zyrka Landwijt has the ability to clearly describe each pose from start to finish.  The DVD is very similar to attending a group Yoga class.  Her presentation shows an in-depth knowledge of the body and of teaching Yoga.  Concentrate on each of the poses in the Pose Guide until you know each one, then try one of the short, easy Yoga sequences.  A beginner's Yoga course will spend most of the course teaching individual poses.  The Yoga sequences usually come later.  I find it valuable to sometimes just watch the Pose Guide section without doing them to allow the instruction to sink in.

A note to beginners: Take a short Yoga course locally to get an understanding of terms used and what the specific directions mean.  Yoga is more than an exercise.

Using Zyrka Landwijt's Yoga DVDs will get you quickly to the point of taking Yoga courses for corrections and refinements of your asanas within sequences, rather than just learning poses.",1301270400,5,1007,4.735632183908046
3325555,5,B0012KK6QK,"I love, love this dvd. It is great dvd to practice with at home.  Zyrka is a fantastic instructor, music is great! One of the best yoga dvd purchases I have ever made.  Highly recommend.",1298419200,5,186,4.285714285714286
3325556,5,B0012KK6QK,"Love this.  This is really ideal for a beginner to intermediate practice.  Of course a real live class is better.  2 series (A & B), with three lengths of each series (6 options) makes this very useful.  Series B is a bit tougher than series A.  There is a 7th section that explains each pose and common mistakes, which is nice for beginners.  I am a hefty guy with a few years (4) yoga experience, including classes. I get a lot of benefit from these videos. I will recommend to some of my similarly sized friends.  Athletes may want a tougher workout than this.",1292198400,7,563,4.355769230769231
3325557,1,B0012KK6QK,"Would have returned it if I could.

Played the DVD as soon as I got it and listened through the introduction.  It was ok.  But as soon as the routine started, I hated it.  Not the routine itself, which was very easy to follow but the voice-over narration and the narrator.

As I have a slight hearing difficulty, I found it difficult to hear what was being said... unless I play it really LOUD and then it would be too distracting to practice.  Add to that, the narrator likes to ""stretch"" certain words to emphasise them such as ""sweeeeeeeeep"" your hands ""aalllllll"" (all) the way ""doowwwnnn"" (down)..... in an almost melodic tone.

I guess this is what is meant by ""gentle"" voice but the style of narration simply did not suit me.",1290211200,11,732,4.5
3325558,3,B0012KK6QK,"The dvd is really good and I would recommend it.  However, even though there are 6 routines, they are all pretty much the same routine with small additions with increasing time.  I was just expecting more diverse routines I could choose from.",1284249600,24,242,4.738095238095238
3325559,5,B0012KK6QK,"Both my husband and I love this DVD. There are 2 level options (A + B) and three time options within each level. It's been a great way to both vary the workout and fit it in no matter what.

I find that it has a nice balance of relaxation and meditation, with a moderate workout. There is a great section of the DVD which focuses on the specific poses. This has helped to improve my practice greatly.

The instruction is clear, easy to follow, and uplifting. I strongly recommend this DVD for beginners, anyone overcoming injuries, or those just looking for a gentle yoga practice.",1277683200,7,581,4.471698113207547
3325560,5,B0012KK6QK,"This dvd is great. I am recovering from an irritated disc, facet joints and SI joint.  This dvd is perfect.  I have only done the 60 min series a routine.  I think the series b looks a little more challenging. I love everything about this routine. It's as good as going to a class if not better than some classes in the area where I live.  Best of all I think this is helping my back more than the treatments from the chiropractor. I feel worked, energized, stretched and relaxed after this yoga routine. I have done it 4 times in 5 days and I actually look forward to doing this yoga and can't wait to do it again. Zyrka is a wonderful instructor who gives the perfect amount of detail and her voice is very relaxing.  I will purchase her other two dvds.  Well worth the money and highly recommend.",1276387200,10,799,4.258278145695364
3325561,5,B0012KK6QK,"The video is not too hard, but it will make you work. The explanation of the breathing techniques is very helpful and something I don't find in other yoga DVDs.",1272499200,6,160,4.366666666666666
3325562,5,B0012KK6QK,"This yoga video is everything I've been looking for in a yoga video to do at home with my boyfriend!  It's very easy to follow with great instruction as you go, making it less about worrying that you have the pose right and enabling you to really flow with the movements/poses and experience the breath - which is really what I always thought Yoga was about.  You don't feel rushed or pressured to be fabulously pretzel like. : )  There is soothing piano based music low in the background which helps put you in a relaxed and focused state.  it doesn't feel like hard work as your doing it - as some other yoga videos I've tried do - and yet when you're finished, you feel invigorated, (like you've really worked your body), and at the same time very aligned and relaxed.  The instructor, Zyrka, has a very calm and soothing way about her as she directs you through the poses and breathing. Tthe way she tells you what to focus on during each pose helped me understand and feel the poses in a way I hadn't before.  The outdoor scenery is also lovely to look at and yet not distracting.  One of the other things i love about this DVD is that there are 6 different yoga routines to choose from, depending on how much time you have that day and how much energy you have.  There's an ""A"" series and a ""B"" series - each with 3 different lengths of routines ranging from 35 minutes to around 65 minutes fora more complete yoga workout.  There's even a pose guide that shows and discusses the different poses and breathing practice etc.

This is not a video for a total pro looking to advance their technique and stamina, but for someone looking to get into Yoga or for someone like myself who enjoys lots of different types of exercise, this is a great addition to your weekly routine if you'd like to add Yoga to the mix. I'm about to buy this for several of my friends!  My boyfriend, (who loves yoga but never has time to make it to a scheduled class), loves this DVD and loves that it's a great ""class"" that we can take at home when our schedule permits.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!",1269993600,6,2089,4.301020408163265

3325564,5,B0012KK6QK,"I was looking for an intro to yoga, and this video lives up to the title, it is gentle yet effective. Gentle music and coaching combine with bending and stretching, then ending with the corpse pose meditation. I look forward to my new afternoon ritual, which can be as short as just over a half hour or maximized to over an hour. I enjoy the repetition of the practice and can feel more flexibility.",1266192000,4,399,4.405405405405405
3325565,5,B0012KK6QK,"I just got this dvd the other day and, for me, it is the best yoga dvd that I own.  The pace is easy, but perfect with clear instruction.  My other yoga dvd's are more strenuous and energetic and not what I want all the time.  If you are looking for good vinyasa flow routines that are easy to follow, gentle and move from one movement to the other in a slower fashion, you will love this.",1265846400,3,389,4.025974025974026
3325566,3,B0012KK6QK,"I had initially ordered this DVD with two ideas in mind.  One, to have a nice relaxing and gentle practice on my days off from my major exercise, or even to do after my regular exercise for flexibility and stretching.  The second to learn Flow yoga better before trying Shiva Rea's more advanced style.

I tried this DVD today. It was certainly better than the first DVD, but after so many downward facing dogs, I was starting to get bored with this one too.  She narrates as if she is reading a book for a 5 year old (one other reviewer also mentioned her narration style, only I was not able to get past it like the other reviewer was).  I made it about half way through the shorter intermediate routine, and then stopped. Zyrka's style is very much instructional, which I also find boring.  As I tried her first DVD and this one, she makes me feel like yoga is drudgery, something I have to get through.  There is no feeling of joy or that yoga can be a pleasant thing.

I also have the impression many of the reviewers are hard-core yoga followers, and that this DVD may offer something for them to get ""deeper into their practice"".  I am not a hard-core yoga follower. For me, I exercise on regular basis (elliptical, brisk walking, strength, flexibility, stretching), so yoga is simply something that complements the other fitness activities I do.  I do understand getting a better understanding of the poses or breathing with yoga, but this DVD didn't do that for me.

If you are like me, and do not like Zyrka's style, and are in reasonably good shape but still fairly new to yoga, you may find Shiva Rea's Beginner's Flow yoga a better alternative. If you are very out of shape or are a couch potato, then Zyrka's beginner flows are probably more appropriate. For me, Shiva makes yoga a joyful experience, and something I should enjoy doing. It was much more appropriate for me.

One other comment on the Pose Guide on Zyrka's DVDs. It is a nice add, although I think it would be very difficult to watch the whole thing from start to finish.  I have another yoga DVD that also has a guide but this guide is interactive.  Meaning that while you are going through the practice, when a new pose is introduced the name of the pose is flashed up on the screen. You have a few seconds where you can press enter on your remote control and it will bring up the practice guide for that particular pose so you can view it while you are doing it. It then returns back to the practice and you continue on.  I think this kind of guide is much more usable.",1262131200,19,2551,4.397872340425532
3325567,5,B0012KK6QK,I am so pleased with this DVD!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  I bought three different DVDs from three different instructors and this is the only one I love.  The 23 pose lessons are wonderful for beginners or reminders for those of us who know these asanas.  Routines are true Vinyasa Flow just like we do in class.  Great to have at home when I can't make it to the studio.  LOVE this!,1256860800,3,396,4.144736842105263
3325568,5,B0012KK6QK,"I just love this video.  I read all the reviews and researched other videos before I purchased this one, and I'm very happy with my choice.

I really love that she holds the poses long enough to really feel them and get the most from them.  I've been practicing for years, and enjoy vinyasa flow, but I do think many just go too darn fast, most of the time. I do not like running at all, too jarring; I have plenty of endurance though, so I prefer hiking to running - sometimes it seems like I can go up and down hill forever; so a slower vinyasa really works best for me. Keeping this in mind, I would love to see her do another video, one with the same pace, but a little more challenging, if that's possible.  This video is extremely well done, it's cued and timed just right, the instructor makes me want to come back again.  It even has a pose I never do - gate pose, so I enjoy that also.

The routine keeps you working, and here in Arizona in the summer, yeah, I do sweat a bit - a lot.  I recommended this to my sister, who just came to yoga several years ago, I think she'd really benefit from it, and now she's going to buy it too.  This is a wonderful workout for someone who has tried yoga, and is ready to move on to something different, to work their body in new ways without stressing it out too much.  Or like me, who has done yoga quite a bit, but had a sore spot on the lower back, and am using this to recoup with.  I really can't find fault at all with this one.  It just seems to work me the way I need worked at this time - can't go wrong with that.",1252886400,16,1571,3.9713375796178343
3325569,5,B0012KK6QK,"This DVD is for beginners to intermediate yoga practioners.

Pros:

Very comprehensive review section for poses
Easy to navigate
Wonderful voice over
Fun and effective routines

Cons:

Examples of the use of props in the review section as they would be used during the flow would have been helpful

Bottom line:

I own several yoga DVDs. This and ""Yoga for Well Being"" are my favorites and what I use near daily. Unless you are an advanced yoga practioner, I think you will have a hard time, if you even can, finding a better slow vinyasa flow DVD.",1250985600,5,548,4.597938144329897
3325570,5,B0012KK6QK,"First let me say I am a novice yogi.  I've taken a couple of classes which I have loved but due to scheduling conflicts was unable to continue them.  So I set out to find a video that could compare to the incredible teacher I had.  This video comes pretty darn close!  While there is really nothing like the real thing, Zyrka is an excellent teacher.  Her voice is mellow & soothing, her prompts are in just the right spots & her moves are easy to follow.  I love that the setting is outdoors, very calming, as is the background music.

The video is divided into 2 levels with three different lengths in each level for a total of 6 workouts.  There is also an excellent pose guide that goes thru each pose in detail to help you perfect your poses.  Even if you are more experienced than I am, I would think it would be refreshing to return to the basics & maybe refine your style.

I also love her focus on integrating breath with the movement & including meditation at the beginning & end of each workout.  They have set it up so Zyrka gets you nice & relaxed at the end & then the main menu kicks on with music calming and soothing enough you can continue your meditation without feeling the need to turn it off.

All in all an excellent video, I did a lot of research on here & other sites, painstakingly reading reviews.  I am very happy with my choice & I highly recommend it to any level yogi.",1248739200,19,1399,4.214285714285714

Based on other reviews, I knew this cd would be easy and I wanted something that I could do on days when I was feeling sluggish and not wanting a heavy-duty workout. This cd, however, was a bit too easy for my semi-intermediate yoga experience. This is great for novices. It's very well done, but not a strenuous workout.",1248048000,14,410,4.63013698630137

After being sorely disappointed with the Restorative Yoga DVD by Neaman,  I was pleasantly surprised by how this yoga session was very close to my own Vinyasa instructors at the local yoga center!  Very well explained without being boring nor too wordy...Zyrka is accompanied by a quiet, meditative background music that allows both your mind and body to thoroughly unwind!  In the past, i have been plagued by shoulder bursitis and severely herniated back disc, but this type of easy core stretching & strengthening has actually been more beneficial for me than the physical therapy sessions prescribed by my doctor!  Also, just as Zryka states, if a position is uncomfortable, to use her alternative position!  A great way to remain flexible and release tension!",1243036800,6,834,5.186567164179104

I haven't worked up from the first program, but I really like the fact that there are two levels with three programs apiece so that I can work up to a more challenging practice.  Substitutions are often suggested, and if you are interested in more in-depth information about a pose, there is a whole pose guide with variations and tips on proper posture.  The music is soothing and non-obtrusive, and the setting is very pretty, but not distracting.  I highly recommend this to anyone, but I think it's a good idea for any first-timers to go to at least one yoga class in person, because we're often unaware of exactly what our bodies are doing at first.",1236643200,6,698,4.604838709677419
