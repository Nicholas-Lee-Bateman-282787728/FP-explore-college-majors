8328148,5,B001NY1524,"you may watch the DVD as an intense walk thru ""stained glass from A to Z"", or you can, as proposed as a lesson plan, watch one chapter per week and take it in (and practice on your own).
The steps are very clear, with appropriate zooming on details.
My kids have watched the DVD a few times ... still amazed that one can ""play"" with glass and not cut oneself (this is the video only, you WILL get some cuts on your fingers!).

A multipurpose DVD, for the hobbyist, the curious, the child, the new artist. All will appreciate watching the blooming of the (glass) flowers over and over again.",1302912000,2,590,4.315315315315315
8328149,5,B001NY1524,"This DVD provides easy to follow, step by step details on making traditional leaded stained glass panels. From designing your panel, to creating the templates, to selecting and cutting glass, to building the panel with lead, to soldering, to puttying to make the panel weatherproof, and even to installation, this DVD is very complete. It also includes very interesting background information about on how art glass is made both with traditional and modern techniques. If you're intersted in making stained glass, or even if you are just curious how these works of art are made, I highly recommend this DVD.",1248739200,3,607,5.08
