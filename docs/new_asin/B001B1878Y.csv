3479090,1,B001B1878Y,What a disappointment. For anyone that saw the series on tv will be really disappointed with this release. This cut up version of the series should not have been released because it is so fragmented that the story line is confusing. Major portions of the story are left out that help tie the story together. I would not recommend this version of the show because it does not represent how good this show was. I would have gladly paid more for the complete series of the show rather than be disappointed with this version.,1221004800,35,521,4.553191489361702
3479091,3,B001B1878Y,"I love this novela!  I started watching it when I was doing a semester abroad in Uruguay this spring.  I am so happy to have come home and found it  now available on Amazon!

I hope Amazon will also add some Argentinian shows like Lalola, Bella y Bestia, and Vidas Robadas soon!  These shows are all very entertaining, and I have found them to be great learning tools as well.

Enjoy!

*Update- after watching the DVDs I've realized that A LOT has been cut out- I'm so disappointed.  I've changed my 5 star review to just 3 stars...and that's being generous.",1220745600,,558,4.455445544554456

3479124,3,B001B1878Y,"Destilando Amor (Distilling Love - 853 minutes)

Romance on an agave plantation so we get to learn about the production of tequila.

Spitfire Gaviota runs afoul of Rodrigo, the handsome grandson of the plantation owner whose family is being victimized by a villainous foreman. Our heroine sings in the village, fights with Rodrigo, runs away with her mamacita to ""Mexico"" (Mexico City) where she becomes an official for the Mexican government's Agave Quality Control Administration. (Don't cha just love telenovelas!)

Totally implausible situations, jealousy (on the parts of BOTH lovers!), double-crosses, car wrecks, injuries (in LONDRES! -  [LONDON]), misunderstandings and rivalry all add to the fun.

We always learn something new in telenovelas and I had never seen the production of tequila before. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this educational DVD...smile... By the way, the captions are in English ONLY, there are NO captions in Spanish.",1372982400,,947,5.503448275862069

Me Gusta Mucho Eduardo Yaez y Angelica Rivera, hacen Bonita Pareja y los Antagonicos, Martha Julia, aunque Sergio Sendel no me agrada mucho si Me Encanta Chantal Andere, es Muy Buena Actriz.
