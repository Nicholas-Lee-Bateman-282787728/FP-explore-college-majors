8330257,5,B001OBMP9S,"Excellent Movie!
John Stockwell, best known for his acting in Top Gun, has a leading role in this short film. John is now a top director and directing some of the best films in Hollywood. Jenny Ladner launches her career as the leading lady and does an outstanding job. If you like youthful action sports- like wakeboarding, and young romance, this is a film for you.",1409702400,,367,4.575757575757576
8330258,2,B001OBMP9S,"This film is actually 24 minutes long - not 74. The story is rather silly but it tries. A young lady is competing in a local wakeboarding competition whilst living at home with the cliched drunk dad. Throw in some teen angst, some fun wake stunts and you have yourself a film that finishes before it starts.

There are some deleted scenes from an unrelated film that follow and a preview of another. Sound is bad, picture is horrible, but I would recommend it to those teens looking for some cool (albeit brief) wake footage.",1242172800,,525,4.526315789473684
