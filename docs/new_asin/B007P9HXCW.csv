8520260,5,B007P9HXCW,Love her teaching style. Good basic beginner book,1491091200,,49,5.25
8520261,5,B007P9HXCW,"This was so very helpful. A great tutorial. For holding instrument, pick and placement on strings. A great basic training tool",1401321600,3,126,5.0476190476190474
8520262,5,B007P9HXCW,"If you are looking to get your feet wet in proper classical mandolin, its hard to find a better player than her.  She shows techniques, very close up and in detail.  She covers a few songs, and its easy to print out the tabs.  Just practicing her tips will improve your playing all around!",1401321600,7,289,4.314814814814815
8520263,5,B007P9HXCW,"The instructor is extremely thorough, and knowledgable.  She breaks down what the left hand does,  what the right hand does, and how to position the body. An added feature is that there is a link for downloading the pieces that she presents  so that you can print out the music.  I found that her technique clarified what I was doing, and was opposite what I had been instructed to do by an old-time mandolin teacher.  Her technique works better.",1400198400,11,446,4.594936708860759
8520264,4,B007P9HXCW,"I really like the DVD, but I need the booklet of music that comes with it. It is on the DVD in PDF format but I can't get it to print.

If there are special instructions for printing the sheet music, there should be a file that describes it.",1382832000,,241,3.9183673469387754
8520265,5,B007P9HXCW,"Like this DVD, I hope there will be part 2 some day! It is not for absolute beginners, one has to have general understanding of the instrument.",1369267200,6,143,4.333333333333333
8520266,4,B007P9HXCW,"I ""dabble"" in mando.  I've played some bluegrass and Old Time, and I enjoy playing Celtic tunes on mando.  Then I figured I'd dabble in some classical tunes and decided to get this DVD (I'm a happy Homespun customer).  I enjoyed it very much and will have to return to it (there's a lot), I'm sure.  Caterina is a very pleasant instructor, which is good.  This is a basics DVD (even I could follow it:))  But I did learn a lot about nuances that make classical so different from bluegrass/OT/Celtic.  Things so basic/subtle as pick angle and hitting only one string on the upswing for a softer tone.  Now bluegrass/OT/Celtic also have pick angles and upswings, but there's also some very interesting techniques that originate in classical, but could be applied on a crossover basis -- she plays ""what do you do with a drunken sailor"" using a harp arpeggio techinque, and it sounds good!  I just might try that at my next OT session!  She also ends with a great mando version of Bach's Prelude from Cello Suite No. 1; that alone might be worth it!  All on tab on pdf that accompanies the DVD.  I really enjoyed it, and I expect I'll re-visit it.",1364428800,13,1144,4.5
