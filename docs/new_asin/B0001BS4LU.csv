8009863,5,B0001BS4LU,"This DVD is the original English version narrated by Brian Wilde.

Microscopic Milton lives in a clock on the mantlepiece in the home of Mrs Witherspoon but can only be seen by Douglas the pet dog of Mrs Witherspoon. He has a vivid imagination & tries to bring them to fruition much to the consternation of Douglas.

These short animations will appeal to children of all ages (even big ones). The colours are soft & some look as though they have been done with water colours the way they merge together. The combination of a soft spoken Brian Wilde, quiet background music & tasteful colour make watching these cartoons a very calming experience.

If only life could be this simple. Highly recommended.",1239148800,,702,4.737704918032787
