8701776,4,B00THG6KAW,Having seen the show I can give it 4 stars. n.b. this DVD is in PAL (European) format and you won't be able to watch it in North America unless you have a recent model player that plays NTSC and PAL. Amazon should have pointed this out in the description for this DVD.,1466553600,,268,4.0754716981132075
