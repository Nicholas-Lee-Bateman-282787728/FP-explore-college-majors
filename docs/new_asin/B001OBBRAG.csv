8330231,5,B001OBBRAG,"I had to get the special edition set to finish my collection, the must have piece is the soundtrack. This series has fantastic music so I had to have it.",1395964800,,153,4.133333333333334
8330232,5,B001OBBRAG,"As I've stated for the other parts of this series, Gurren Lagann is a fantastic anime and this box set is about as good as it gets. My only complaint is that when I received the package, the box art was slightly damage (a few creases, bent corner or two). That being said, I'm still completely satisfied with my purchase.",1378339200,,321,4.366666666666666
8330233,5,B001OBBRAG,"This one I believe is a bit optional. I- of course bought all three limited editions of the Gurren Lagann collection, but this one I think a lot of people could do with the normal 2 box set. In case you didn't know, this one comes with the first issue of the Manga and the soundtrack for the series. I am a hardcore fan, I cosplay Viral and all- so it was natural for me to buy it. But, to get the end of the series and the first manga seemed a bit arbitrary. The soundtrack, although great and containing amazing songs, is also something I don't know if most people want to be blaring in their car.

As John pulled up at the stop sign, he allowed his window to come down. Tipping his sunglasses he peered out at a young woman who was gazing into his vehicle. Suddenly, he'd turn the dial on his stereo and let the sounds crash against her like waves... 'ROW! ROW! FIGHT DA POWAH!' -the girl melted.

Like I said, great songs, great manga, but not most people will find this as cool as the bag or drill bit necklace or art box. So, it's all within your hands. Are you a hardcore fan... or no?",1269302400,,1092,4.122065727699531
8330234,4,B001OBBRAG,"When you are looking to finish up Gurren Lagann, you can't go wrong with the special edition.  It has the last nine episodes of the series, the two disk CD that has all the themes and endings on one disk, and all the awsome music from the series on the other disk.  The first volume of the manga is included in the set as well.  The manga remains true to the storyline while staying interesting as well.",1247097600,,403,4.207792207792208

Shipping was cheap, this item was cheap!
All in perfect condition. It was all outlined as when I purchased the item. There is no better seller on Amazon!",1244678400,,183,4.575757575757576

It's the single word that describes how I have felt about nearly episode of ""GURREN LAGANN and here we are now with the final set which contains volumes 05 (Episodes 19-23) and volumes 06 (Episodes 24-27).  The Limited Edition version of Set 03 also comes with the first manga volume and the ""GURREN LAGANN BEST SOUND"" soundtrack.

GAINAX brings us a mecha anime series and having created so many and with so many created for so many decades, you often wonder if innovative, imaginative storylines can still be developed.  Well, with ""GURREN LAGANN"", the creators of this anime series manages to create a fantastic series that unique, fun, explosive, sexy and enjoyable.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Each episode is  featured in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The character designs by Atsushi Nishigori are fresh and very different.  I truly dig the character designs and the whole anime is quite colorful and looks stylish and pretty cool.

The main difference with these final eight episodes compared to the past series is the use of CG and various effects to showcase the war against the anti-spirals.  Definitely vibrant in the various colors shown in the animation, the animators also take their time in utilizing stylish segments and making sure the final four episodes look chaotic, frantic but at the same time, colorful.

As for the audio, the Digital 5.1 effects utilized in the English dub is actually very well done.  I liked the effective use of splitting the audio of action scenes through the various speaker channels and overall, the audio track for the 5.1 English dub is well done.

The Japanese audio is featured only in 2.0 Stereo but the dialogue and action scenes also come clear through the front channels, the main difference is that the war seems to come alive on the English dub.  I have a 7.2 home theater setup, so it was great to hear the front channels utilized but also hearing the variety of sounds coming through my other two channels situated in the sides of my room.

So, overall, I was pleased that both audio tracks are included and although my preference is towards the original Japanese audio, I felt the casting of voice talent for the English dub was well selected and overall the voice acting on both the Japanese and English were well-done.

Gurren Lagann Manga Volume 001

The first manga volume (in English) of ""Gurren Lagann"" is included with the SET03 LIMITED EDITION.  The manga features both Simon and Kamina living underground up to the first battle between Kamina and Viral in their Laganns.  The anime adaption from the manga is pretty much spot on.  And the character designs were just pleasant to look at.  Overall, a magnificent job by Kotaro Mori and of course, GAINAX.  Also, another wonderful translation by Shoko Oono.

I was very pleased to find the two disc soundtrack ""GURREN LAGANN BEST SOUND"" included with the Set03 Limited Edition Box Set.  For one, I have reviewed so many Japanese movie soundtracks and anime soundtracks to know that if you want a soundtrack with both vocal and instrumental tracks, you end up having to buy multiple soundtracks and CD singles.  So, it does get expensive.

But for this soundtrack, you get all the vocal tracks and the instrumentals.

On the first disc ""Theme Song Disc"", you get the main theme ""sorairo days"", a catchy pop song by Shoko ""Shokotan"" Nakagawa and was the main theme song used for the whole entire series.  You also get the ending themes ""UNDERGROUND"" by HIGH VOLTAGE and ""Minna no Peace"" by Afuromania and also the insert song used in the series titled ""happily ever after"" by Shoko Nakagawa.

The second disc features the soundtrack with music composed and produced by Taku Iwasaki.  A well-known composer in the anime world who did the composition for hit anime series such as ""Irresponsible Captain Tailor"" OAV series, ""Now and Then, Here and There"", ""Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen"", ""R.O.D. - Read or Die-"" and many more anime series.

The soundtrack utilizes plenty of orchestra instrumental but you also get a touch jazz with track like ""Boobies VS Boobies"", romantic saxophone jazz with ""elegy for Kamina's Father, Who Became a Skeleton"", rock n' roll with ""Nikopol"" and hip hop with ""Rap is a Man's Soul! Heads Up and Listen to the Man Who Seeks the Heavens, Kamina's Theme!"" (which many people have heard the lyrics, ""Bro! Bro! Fight the Power"" throughout the series) and ""Libera me"" from Hell which combines cool rhymes with opera, electrosynth with tracks such as ""Spin, Spin, Spin and Spin..."" and electronic gabber-like style music such as ""The Blue monday e""r""ectrical parade"" and more.

CD insert contains romanized lyrics to the tracks and production credits.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Overall, this is a pretty well-done soundtrack that features a wide variety of music. If sold on its own, I would highly recommend it but since it's a soundtrack that comes with a DVD box set, that's just the cherry on your favorite cake.  If you are a fan of the series, this is another incentive of why to get the ""GURREN LAGANN - SET03 LIMITED EDITION"".

I can't help but think how awesome this series was to watch!  From the stylish presentation, the wacky humor, the adult-like humor and pervertedness and the imaginative mecha Gunmen robots and attack modes, the battles and the fun characters and the music, there is just too much to like about ""Gurren Lagann"".  I absolute found the series to be quite fantastic!

Just how the pacing of the anime series goes from people wanting to get out of the underground and seeking freedom, to the characters fighting to survive and eventually growing up but having to face their own insecurities and also consequence and then furthering their adventures as we see the characters start off young and right to end where they are older adults.

And of course, this anime series is action-packed but most of all well-acted (both in Japanese and English), awesome animation, great character development and well-written storyline.  Suffice to say, these last two volumes are absolutely fantastic and the way the series concludes gives wonderful closure to the viewer.

And with Bandai Entertainment giving us a Limited Edition Box Set for ""SET03' is just wonderful.  It's great to have the first volume of the manga series but to get an awesome 2-disc original soundtrack, you are definitely getting your money's worth!

""Gurren Lagann"" can be described in one word and that is ""Fantastic!"" but to experience the complete series from beginning to the end and to have a magnificent release with the ""GURREN LAGANN - SET03 LIMITED EDITION"", this DVD box set release definitely gets an A+!",1242691200,14,12984,4.738351254480286
