8497566,5,B006GGJRLA,"The Yellow Ticket (1918 release from Germany; 66 min.) brings the story of Lea, a Jewish young woman living in Sokolowice, Poland. She is eager to get to St. Petersburg, Russia to study at university, but her father cant afford it. After her father passes away, she goes to St. Petersburg anyway, where she is struggling mightily, even having to apply for a yellow ticket, issued to women of pleasure. In a parallel story, Lea gets her hands on the birth certificate of the deceased sister of a former teacher, and with that Lea is able to register at St. Peters University. She is in particular interested in the class taught by  Prof. Stanlaus. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie comes from the golden era of silent movies, and is worth seeing for just its historical context and significance. Second, the movie was shot entirely in Warsaw, which stood in for both Sokolowice and St. Petersburg. Third, what interested me the most was to observe the scenery, given that this is now almost 100 years ago. Its like getting a time capsule in the form of a movie. Fourth, this stars Pola Negri. Nuff said! Last but not least, for those interested in a further perspective on this movie, it was remade in Hollywood in 1931, starring Elissa Landi, Lionel Barrymore and Lawrence Olivier.

I saw The Yellow Ticket recently at the 2014 Jewish & Israeli Film Festival here in Cincinnati, where the movie was shown with a soundtrack composed, and performed live, by violinist Alicia Svigals, accompanied by pianist Marilyn Lerner. It certainly added to the overall enjoyment of the movie, as this now was a live multi-media event. Truly something special. Svigals has been touring North America doing this live performance, and if you have a chance to experience the movie in this way, by all means do not miss it! But even without that, The Yellow Ticket is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1393027200,,1997,4.749279538904899
8497567,2,B006GGJRLA,"Did I get the wrong DVD-set? It is hard for me to understand the statements of the three reviewers below who each gave 5 stars. In fact I experienced the same as the two reviewers with the 1 and 3 star judgement. I got three scratched DVDs that didn't work. As a replacement I received ... three DVD-r. O.k., this time they worked. There is a remark in the booklet that promises digital restorations of the films and it is repeated in the opening and closing credits of each movie. When I watched ""The Eyes of the Mummy Ma"" I realized that this is the same print as the Alpha-DVD with the titles replaced by ugly white-on-black ones that don't really fit in. Just compare the first scene that takes place in the desert. And everybody should know by now that you can't sink much lower than Alpha. The most interesting of the films is ""Sappho"" which is announced as being tinted. Well, it isn't. I own the Grapevine-DVD which in fact contains the tinted version with english titles. O.k., it looks like a transfer from a video cassette, but unless the long announced german version from ""edition filmmuseum"" gets published this is the one to get. There is also a (shortened ?) version of ""Hintertreppe"" (Backstairs) on it. I give 2 stars for the two polish films on the first DVD. Not that they are especially good (they are not) or that they are restored (they aren't and they were provided with the same ugly titles as the other films), but they are examples of the Pola Negri films that were produced in Poland before she went to Germany where she made her - in my opinion - best silent film ""Die Bergkatze"" (The Wildcat), directed by Ernst Lubitsch.",1345939200,6,1651,4.506666666666667
8497568,3,B006GGJRLA,the discs are scratched and damaged and don't play well.  There is definitely something wrong with quality control at emphasisentertainment.  I contacted the manufacturer through their website and they acknowledged the fault and they were so kind to send replacement discs. 2 replacement discs were dvd-r but it is better than nothing...,1338163200,6,337,5.461538461538462
8497569,5,B006GGJRLA,"I was thrilled to discover that a pola negri dvd set was in the works, but even more thrilled after i viewed it. ""THE POLA NEGRI ICONIC COLLECTION"", Which contains four films: the polish dancer, the yellow ticket, the eyes of mummy ma, and sappho. The polish dancer & the yellow ticket(2-very rare films) make their dvd debut. Although eyes of mummy ma & sappho have been released before on other editions, this set brings the best available quality to create an excellent collection. The 3-dvd set also includes a very nice booklet as well as some extra's. Bright shining city productions has outdone themselves! Also lookout for their excellent documentary on pola negri entitled:""LIFE IS A DREAM IN CINEMA"", directed by: mariusz kotowski. If you are a fan of pola negri, or a silent film buff, this set is a must own!",1333756800,2,820,4.741258741258742
8497570,5,B006GGJRLA,"Finally, the premiere actress who used her exotic beauty and mystery to back a 50-year career has been rediscovered.
  And fully recognized.
  Pola Negri has been badly neglected by film historians, but the release of the gorgeous three-disc set Pola Negri: The Iconic Collection The Early Films (Bright Shining City Productions) finally corrects this.
  Negri married Count Eugene Dambski and later Prince Serge Mdivani, and had affairs with a wide variety of terribly important men (from Rod La Rocque to Charlie Chaplin), but it was her relationship with silent screen heartthrob Rudolph Valentino that caused the greatest stir.  At his death, Pola performed one of her greatest roles, a cross-country fainting tour, plummeting on cue for the newsmen at every stop; she even sent a floral arrangement for Valentino's coffin that spelled out P-O-L-A in blooms and blossoms.  Some meaner wags suggested that Pola and Rudy had never actually met.
  What truly matters are her films.
  Four films---The Polish Dancer (1917), about a wild young thing's fateful search for love in the city; The Yellow Ticket (1918) exposes the rampant anti-Semitism in Imperial Russia; Eyes of the Mummy Ma (1918) is an Egyptian concoction with Emil Jannings chewing the scenery and Sappho (1921) with Alfred Abel who would play the world leader in Metropolis a few years later---are the core of the collection which belongs on the shelf of every silent movie buff.
  Among the bonuses are clips from Life is a Dream in Cinema. This documentary reminds us that before Garbo, Dietrich, Madonna or Lady Gaga, Negri paved the way for stars who had a better eye for publicity than art, that you had to be known to be seen and there is no such thing as bad publicity. To be sure, there were grand horizontals who slept their way to fame and fortune before Negri did, and these ladies frequently used the entertainment industry as a conduit for success.  But Pola was the first to use the silver screen, originating the cinematic femme fatale.
  Yes, these films are early and nave and a bit murky at times, but it's fascinating to follow the creation of a cinematic persona so vivid as Negri. This is the face of the motion picture camera's first love. Stills and publicity photos fail to capture the fire and mystery so easily illustrated by the moving image. Whatever the miracle is that takes place between an actress and the lens of a camera, Negri was the first to have it, and the first to exploit it.
  There is something magic about films preserved and re-mastered from this period.  The work done here is exquisite, the new piano score by Rick DeJonge is both so much of the period of the films as well as an incredibly modern manner of presentation, carefully illustrating the moods and passions of an art created nearly a century ago.
  Bright Shining City Productions is to be congratulated for this major contribution to the history of cinematic art.  Lovingly and expertly done, Pola Negri The Iconic Collection The Early Films will be cherished by all film lovers for years to come.",1333065600,2,3073,4.856046065259117
8497571,1,B006GGJRLA,"I was very excited to see that such a DVD collection of the early Pola Negri's movies had been released. I ordered it all the way from America to Poland as I'm a huge fan of Pola and silent movies in general. Unfortunately all discs are damaged and scratched which must have happened during production. The first disc is so damaged that I lost 8 minutes of the movie, it is impossible to make it work, it stops and I had to fast-foward a lot. I don't recommend it to anyone...",1330992000,8,476,4.241758241758242
