8438092,5,B004QF720Q,"My Sister and I went to watch Willy Wonka at the movie theater when it first came out. We saved so many soda bottles for money and must have watched it 50 times. It was Summer and we didn't have anything better to do but sit in the air conditioning so we sat through the second movie ""Squirm"" which was very scary for our young age. It made an impression for our first scary movie and I wanted to add it to my collection to share with my Grandsons. I wonder if they will find it as scary as we did?",1406851200,2,498,3.9405940594059405
