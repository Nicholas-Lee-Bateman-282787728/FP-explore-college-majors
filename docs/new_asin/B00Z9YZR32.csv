No wonder this was only 8 episodes",1531267200,,110,4.0
8719665,1,B00Z9YZR32,"If you are a fan of top level BBC dramas, you will be disappointed as I was.  This production seems to be a poor amalgam of the top US Series: 'The Wire' &' Breaking Bad.'  The photography was the only top grade feature of this DVD.  The main culprit is the poor script from episode to episode.  The quality of the casting, which is a BBC hallmark, was uneven. O.T. was much better in an earlier TV police drama.  Trevor Eve, a favorite, is wasted because of the writing.  One positive:  He is aging well.  Bottom line:  a waste of time and effort for one who bought the Series unseen.",1447027200,,585,4.245454545454545
