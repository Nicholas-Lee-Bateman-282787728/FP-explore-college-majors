1418427,5,B00005AUE4,"Have you ever looked up into the heavens and wondered what might be looking back? Most of us have. UFO's and ALIENS made me wonder what else was out there. The movie is comfortably narated, and easy to understand, with just the right touch of suspence.  With the physical layout of the Universe, the vast expanse, could we be the only life out there? Scientists disagree whether it is possible. Could we really be that fortunate? Or are we just a simple example of what could be? What other life forms could be out there?  As I watched, I was drawn to the same old questions: What do other forms of life look like? What is the basis of their form of life? Are they Carbon Based? Or could they be completely different? These questions have plagued mankind for eons. With all the evidence, is it possible we are but a small, insignificant life form? You decide.",989280000,10,859,4.464968152866242
7935801,5,B00005AUE4,"The material in the DVD is a bit dated now, but overall its an excellent presentation, especially compared to other DVDs sold in this subject area. Jeri Ryan also has an magnificent, unique voice for narration, which tends to get overlooked when she is on camera because she is so attractive. So she was a great choice as the narrator for this set of topics.

I found some of the attempt to balance belief vs. skepticism a bit of a stretch as the people discussing the topics were often ill-informed (such as the so called expert who was very skeptical of hypnosis results)... Obvious bias and not backed up by the facts...

I would recommend this at the bargain price its available for now. The material does get a bit tedious, so you can't really sit through it straight for the full 3 and a half hours. But otherwise, its worth watching. It doesn't go into tremendous depth in any one area, but that's to be expected considering the limitations of the format.",1467590400,,962,4.554913294797688

7935805,5,B00005AUE4,"This is a great DVD! I really don't want to go into detail but I will say this. The special visual effects just for this DVD are awesome! Jeri Ryan's narration is really good. The DVD has three programs all of which are very similar to each other. Showing actually UFO sightings and hypnosis! It has the usual people giving their opinions that alien abductions is just a dream and all that and that the UFOs are secret air craft by out government and such. In My opinion that's a bunch of bull. The three other documentaries are shorter but are really good. The UFOs vs. the Government is really a good. The Reel Encounters really brought back memories with special footage of the Day the Earth Stood Still, The War of the Worlds, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E. T. The Extra-terrestrial!  And last but not least the Aliens in Antiquity is just really a treat! Showing the wonders of the world such as the Pyramids of Giza, the Statues on Easter Island, Stonehenge, the Myan Temples, and among others. But how could normal people hundreds and thousands of years ago build these magnificent wonders? The narrator Ed Ragozzino explains the possibilities that there were Gods, Giants, and Aliens. That's all I'm gonna say! This really is a great DVD! If you are a huge UFO and Alien buff like I am then I strongly recommend that you purchase this today because at about three hours and at this price you can't beat it!",1125273600,,1426,4.54863813229572
7935806,2,B00005AUE4,"I have purchased and watch the ""UFO's and ALIENS"" DVD and all I want to say is ""PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DON'T ORDER THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE""!!!!!!  You will recieve some Government TRUTH within the ""EXTRA's"" section of the DVD, but when you watch the DVD you must ask the question ""What are they NOT telling ME""?  I have seen many UFO video's and this one is the worst, I recommend buying ""UFO's: The Secret Evidence"", it will give you at least 80% of the truth about what's happening with this phenomenon.

7935807,2,B00005AUE4,"If you want to learn more about the phenomenon, then don't bother looking at this DVD. The only slightly intresting bits are the ""extras"" and the last 1/3 of the main DVD - Saucer Tech.

The first main sections of the DVD iterates that only scientits are able to discern reality from non-reality. So called specialists think that UFO's are figments of the imagination or sleep paralysis.

There is so much denial of ""hard"" or ""real"" evidence such as radiation burns, physical debris and other physical evidence, yet of course only SETI can tell us if the aliens are out there with their primitve alien radio transmitters.

It's a shame Jeri Ryan wasn't actually ""in-shot"" or I'd have given a few more stars just for her appearance!

If you're gonna buy, put this at the bottom of your wishlist.",1109548800,5,794,4.690647482014389

7935809,5,B00005AUE4,"UFO's and Aliens is far better than the average DVD documentaries that seem to be rushed into production. The DVD contains three programs from TLC (The Learning Channel) with an additional set of three documentaries as a bonus! Essentially, you get six fifty minute programs on one DVD. It's a real bargain, for a DVD release. And the interviews, narrations, and graphics are all top notch. You won't be disappointed.",1046131200,2,417,4.9714285714285715
