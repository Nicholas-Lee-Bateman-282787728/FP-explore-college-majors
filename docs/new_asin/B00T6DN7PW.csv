Here's the scoop. Set in Afghanistan, there is a British outpost that seems to do a lot of recon and some patrolling to make certain the local terrorists aren't up to no good. During a patrol, one of the soldiers steps on a land mine. Not good. Things spiral down from there and the entire situation becomes untenable.

This starts out soft. You visit the outpost. Me the guys (sort of) and see some of their daily routine. Then they go on the scouting mission and the land mine thing happens. It gets pretty intense for awhile as they all try to get back on track. Then it slows down horribly. The viewer spends an inordinate amount of time listening (or trying to listen) to the guys talk to each other as the try and ride out the situation. It's as boring as can be. Part of the problem lies in the thick British accents. I understood less than half of what these guys were saying. So this long boring stretch gets really long and boring. Then it doesn't really end. It just kind of stops. There is no arc leading to a climax and resolution.

I've seen a fair number of British flicks but I didn't recognize any of these actors. I suppose they did a decent enough job of things. It was directed well enough with very good (if somewhat gooey) special effects. But I don't think this was a story that could lend itself well to film. No story arc, no character arc and no climax. Just a bad situation that gets fixed by the end in a non-surprising manner.",1459728000,,1634,4.403973509933775

8700548,5,B00T6DN7PW,"Mostly war movies are about strong-jawed heroes facing the enemy and follow a predictable and pretty unrealistic story arc.

This is very, very different. The enemy turns out to be old Russian landmines left over from the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. British forces, occupying a hilltop near Kajaki dam, need to move to a forward position on a nearby ridge in order to get eyes on the main road where insurgents seem to be taking up position. To get to the ridge the troops descend from their OP and cross a sand-filled gully. It's a routine movement.

And then one of them steps on a landmine.

From here on in it's about reacting to bad luck. One casualty turns into two and then the law of multiplication sets in. Casevac is requested but the controller messes up the dispatch. When a suitable heli arrives the force of the downblast sets off yet another mine, injuring yet more soldiers. In the end it's a question of endurance and trying to keep morale going. The heroics comprising facing a sh*t situation with black humor and resilience. There are no contacts with the enemy, no brassing up Terry the Talib. It's just the minute-by-minute grit and determination to remain professional under circumstances that would cause most people to break down with self-pity and fear.

This is a very realistic and harrowing movie. It won't appeal to people who think John Wayne movies are the apogee of cinematic story-telling. But for people who want both some insight into real combat conditions and value great acting that isn't hampered by clichd story arcs, character arcs, and all the rest of the prefab Hollywood nonsense, this is a must-watch movie.",1445558400,,1658,4.827464788732394
8700549,5,B00T6DN7PW,"Set in 2006 a team from 3 Para of the British Army set out to intercept a Taliban patrol. They were based at the Kajaki Dam in Helmand province in the south of Afghanistan. In order to have cover they chose to use a wadi (a dry river bed). Unbeknown to them the area has been mined by the Russian Army when they occupied the country in the 1980's.

What follows is based on actual events and the efforts of the men to extricate the wounded in the face of dreadful odds where you never know when the next unstable mine will blow.

This is not only upsetting it is also edge of seat stuff. All of the performances are exceptional. Mark Stanley (`Game of thrones') plays the medic - Tug and he puts in an extraordinary performance. This is well filmed, directed and acted and deals with a part of war that is less seen in films but is just as much a reality when dealing with modern warfare. This is a film that has the power to move and upset you but is all the more praiseworthy for having done so. I hope it is a fitting tribute to the men who took part in this action.",1437696000,3,1069,4.110047846889952
