5275717,3,B00979KQ7C,"The Son of Robin Hood, who is actually his secret daughter with the first name of Daring, is an interesting idea. However, the story didn't move fast enough; also the children of Robin Hood's followers in attendance would have been more plausible than an aging band of Merry Men who somehow all managed to outlive Robin.

8537202,3,B00979KQ7C,"There'd been heaps of Robin Hood movies that have ranged from excellent to forgettable. SON OF ROBIN HOOD, out in 1959, falls somewhere in the middle. I do like the twist of Robin's offspring being a daughter, although I say PRINCESS OF THIEVES - with Keira Knightley as Robin Hood's daughter - is a superior film.

Set in the year 1220, SON OF ROBIN HOOD posits that the revered outlaw of Sherwood Forest has been dead these past ten years. In his absence, His Grace Duke Simon des Roches (David Farrar) has grown corrupt and starved for power. As the movie opens, he wastes little time in clapping irons on Robert, Earl of Chester and Prince Regent of England, and hurling him in the dungeon.

Who's left to fight tyranny? In Sherwood Forest gathers a band of geriatric outlaws. Some of Robin's most trusted merry men - Little John, Alan A Dale, Will Scarlet - are still creaking around, now to foment an uprising against the foul Duke des Roches.

Except what's required is an almighty spark to ignite a rebellion. Well, why not bring Robin's son, Deering Hood, into the fray? And Deering Hood is only happy to help. Look, there he sails from Spain. And now he's arrived to England! Except he's a she.

Speaks to the rampant chauvinism of that era that the bandits' universal reaction, upon learning that Deering is a bonnie girl, is wild consternation and dismay. Well, she just won't do to lead the charge, not ""Sir Fair Legs!""

The bandits perk up when a fine figure of a stranger steps in. There's a lot of masquerading that goes on in this movie. This intrepid stranger - who, in actuality, is none other than the regent's younger brother, Sir James (Al Hedison), returned from the Crusades - readily agrees to take on the role of Robin Hood's son and, also, soon after, for the purpose of infiltrating Duke des Roches' inner circle, poses as the visiting Marquis Henri Duval.

And there's the real Deering Hood (June Laverick), stewing. Still, she goes along with the plan, Sir Fair Legs, first passing herself off as ""Deering's"" page, then as Duval's wife. While she disappears for huge chunks of the movie, at least the screenplay allows her her moments of pluck and badassssery. Gratifyingly, her arrows fly just as true as her father's. So, she does contribute more than just as window dressing, never mind that she looks fetching either in a gown or in her spring-to-action Sherwood Forest outfit.

SON OF ROBIN HOOD is passable entertainment, not as good as some, not as crap as others. June Laverick didn't have much of a cinematic career. Her role here may be her most shining moment. Al Hedison snags the male lead part and he's fine in it, being properly strapping and flaunting a swagger and a twinkle in the eye. Maybe my favorite character here is Lady Sylvia (Delphi Lawrence), des Roches' randy sister. She's so sly and unapologetically horny and delights so in playing games of sexual conquests, it's a hoot. Also, her arc ends up playing a significant role in the main storyline.

3 out of 5 stars. The film suffers some from the occasional choppy editing and a boilerplate sensibility. Laverick's archery just doesn't look convincing. You see her barely exert herself pulling on the bow string. And I guess the combat sequences were adequate back in the day, but, today, they look clumsy, like kids playing swords. I like how the showdown sword fight degenerates into fisticuffs, as if the combatants realized at the same time that they weren't getting anywhere crossing blades and just decided to go punch each other.

There's a scene that was so stupid I started laughing. Just as the rebels were about to navigate a flooded tunnel, trying to breach the duke's castle, they decide to leave their weapons behind. I guess they're, what?, crossing their fingers that they'd stumble across new weapons on the other side?

There's another scene when the rebels and Deering have snuck into the castle's courtyard. Deering has her bow and arrow at the ready, and there's des Roches right there with his back turned to her, the easiest target. She could've taken him out right there, and main problem solved. Does she? No. It would've deprived our rugged hero engaging des Roches in their ""epic"" sword fight that turns into a bum fight. So, yeah, 3 out of 5 stars.",1523577600,,4285,4.716577540106952
8537203,5,B00979KQ7C,This was also a very good movie for the people that like Robin Hood.,1431129600,,68,3.9285714285714284
8537204,1,B00979KQ7C,"The makers of this somewhat insipid movie appear to be suffering from some gender confusion as Robin's offspring is in fact a daughter,one ""Deering Hood"" played ineffectually by a wan and uninspiring June Laverick..She is summoned from her home in Spain by Robin's trusty lieutenant ,""Little John "" who erroneously believes her to be a male .He wishes her to lead the resistance to the villainous ""Des Roches""(David Farrow)and his henchman """"Dorchester ""(Philip Friend) who scheme to prevent the coronation of the boy king and ,after disposing of him,assume the throne. Fearing that his followers will not accept a woman as leader of the resistance ""Little John"" persuades the dashing ""Jamie""(Davis Hedison) to pose as Robin's son and  with ""Deering "" disguised as his squire they infiltrate ""Des Roches"" court and set about trying to liberate the young king and his mother.

It is all pretty dire. The acting is strictly second rate(with the sole exception of Delphi Lawrence as the sister of Des Roches) and the action scenes lack verve and brio. The colour too is muddy and the sound lacks sharpness..The best that can be said of the movie is that it is mercifully brief. Altogether a dull ,lackluster piece of work .Avoid.",1423699200,,1226,4.975609756097561
8537205,5,B00979KQ7C,Thought it was well done.  Acting was convincible  Loved David Hedison.  Wish he would have made more movies.  I would recommend it.,1382227200,,132,4.863636363636363

8537207,4,B00979KQ7C,"As old as I am, it never ceases to amaze me, how the ""creative"" talents of both Hollywood and Great Britain can take a
legend and bungle the story line.  Don't take me wrong, I remember watching all the other 'ROBIN HOOD' features on
black and white TV.  I even remember the films involving the children of other famous heroes, such as the 'Three
Musketeers'.  the idea of 'Robin Hood' having a son or a daughter for that matter isn't that hard to believe.  What with the
way things were back then.  Anyway, the premise of the film wasn't that bad, what made me angry was 'Robin's daughter'
being so easily tricked into letting her be talked into playing second fiddle.
All in all, it was an enjoyable film.",1367366400,,707,4.449612403100775
8537208,2,B00979KQ7C,"20th Century Fox, you should be ashamed! All right, SORH is no classic, but this is a dreadful print with no re-mastering and a 1:33:1 pan and scan TV image to boot. Sadly I didn't check the aspect ratio before I hit the ""buy"" button. How any studio can put out rubbish like this, at such an inflated price (plus UK postage for us Brits) is beyond me - especially in an age when the competition is consistently releasing back catalogue titles in their original aspect ratios. Frankly the old video copy I already own is just as good, picture-wise.

As for the film, it's entertaining enough in a fin-de-siecle sort of way; David Hedison makes quite a charming hero, June Laverick is perky enough (with smashing legs, I'm non-PC enough to note), and David Farrar gives an expansive turn sporting a fright wig as the baddie. The action scenes are pretty ropey , although the final multi-weapon set-to is reasonably exciting and you can play ""spot the stuntman"" as Bob Simmons rather obviously leaps in to double Hedison.

But honestly, Fox...",1363392000,3,1040,4.708791208791209
8537209,5,B00979KQ7C,"This is a fun, swashbuckling movie from the 50s.  If you are expecting an academy award winner, don't buy this -  you will be disappointed.  But, if you want to have some fun without the gory realism of today's movies this is a flick for you.  This movie is just entertainment.  The plot is simple:  Robin Hood's son need to return to England to take up where dad left off.  But, of course, there is a twist.  Corny & campy and I loved it!  The DVD itself is good quality, the movie must have been remastered because it looks good on the screen.  The price was reasonable and it sure beats watching reality TV.",1363305600,,610,4.271929824561403
8537210,2,B00979KQ7C,"I saw this Robin Hood film in the movie theater as a child. I was overjoyed to get the chance to see it again. I was prepared for anything, so I am not disapointed even though the plot is silly, the acting is worse, the swordfights seems without director and swords and halberds are clearly made of wood. No, it's allright, nostalgia is great fun. But the quality is bad. In close ups the picture is perhaps acceptable but when the knights ride in the landscabe and scenes alike, it is as seeing the film through a haze. It's dizzy and unsharp. Therefore I can only give it two stars simply for seeing it again.",1358035200,6,611,4.321739130434783
8537211,2,B00979KQ7C,"Warner Bros started a welcome trend with their no-frills DVDs on demand line,  promising to eventually  release their entire library encompassing MGM, RKO, Monogram, Allied Artists, a treasure trove for collectors indeed! I've remained an avid such collector in spite of the line's relatively high pricing policy, given that they are only DVD-Rs after all, and that as a down under resident, I'm additionally up for higher postal fees. Happily, the MGM/UA, Columbia/Sony and Universal vaults quickly followed the market and Warner began remastering a number of key films which further enhanced their product. Finally, Fox has joined this trend-promising great things given that their three-strip technicolor musicals and period films were so spectacular looking in their heyday, and the Cinemascope revolution of the 50s created a whole new ball game. Well, Fox is dropping the ball by releasing pan and scan prints of some of its titles and I'm particularly unhappy that The Son of Robin Hood, a modest little swashbuckler from the prolific action director George Sherman, has bitten the dust in this murky pan and scanner. I want clear assurance in future before I hand over my $19.95 plus postage that the film I purchase will arrive in its original aspect ratio. I'm particularly irked when I read ""this has been modified to fit your screen"". MY screen happens to be a wide one, like the majority of contemporary TV sets. They clearly haven't caught up with the times.",1357257600,15,1472,5.078512396694215
