1801049,4,B0000764FF,"When I first saw the previews for this, I groaned. I was totally thinking it would be a huge flop and a silly movie, then I watched it. It was very cute! It had a heart warming storyline, our favorite familiar characters, and even some new ones to liven up the story. I was so excited even though he is a bad guy that Disney put a Welsh Corgi in this movie because they are my most favorite dog. The only thing I have to say about this movie that's negative is that I miss Mr. Tibbs from the first movie.",1052438400,,504,4.0
1801050,3,B0000764FF,"My daughter recieved this as a Valentine's gift and she loves it.
I was dissapointed to find that Cruella de Vil still smokes in this sequel.  With all the anti-smoking campaigns now I would have thought that Disney would have made this important change in their villian.

Found this to be very similar to Lady and the Tramp II: Scamps Adventure.  Same story line different characters.
Unless you absolutely have to have this for your Disney Video collection I would rent it first before purchasing it.",1048118400,,502,4.813953488372093
1801051,4,B0000764FF,"Out of the animated sequels Disney has been releasing in the past few years, ""101 Dalmatians II"" of the best. Unlike many of its contemporaries in the realm of  direct-to-video entertainment, it wonderfully captures the style and feel of the original movie while also being entertaining for a modern audience. The film's story revolves around Patch, one of the Dalmatian pups who feels like he's not special because he is only ""one out of one hundred and one."" After getting left behind after his family moves the country, he strikes off on his own in a search to find his favorite television star, Thunderbolt the Wonder Dog, who just happens to be filming his program in London (how's that for a coincidence). Cruella's back as well, this time with an eye on fine(?) art since he parole officer has ordered her to stay away from fur. While it's not nearly as memorable as the first film, but still pretty good.",1046390400,,912,4.7
1801052,4,B0000764FF,"This movie is a step above most Disney sequels.  It actually captures the look and feel of the original, and expands greatly on the humor.  Clever dialogue, cute puppies, great new characters, and a lightning fast pace make this one of the few Disney sequels that can stand up to the original.  Recommended for kids and their parents!",1044316800,,334,4.724137931034483
1801053,3,B0000764FF,"I loved the original growing up and had the stuffed animals. I got the sequel because of my love for the original, and while I liked this film a lot, I couldn't get over the big mistake. In the begining, Pongo is counting the puppies on counts 101. If you have seen the original, you would know that the number 101 includes Pongo and Perdita. There are only supposed to be 99 puppies. And later when the puppies are kidnapped, dogs throughout London participating in the Twilight Bark say that 101 puppies were stolen. Towards the end, somebody finally says that 99 puppies were stolen. It made me mad that nobody at Disney caught this mistake! The storyline is that Patch wants to be one of a kind instead of one of 101. He gets left behind when his family moves to a farm (a dalmation plantation)and ends up joining his favorite t.v. hero, thunderbolt, who is attempting to save his acting carrer by doing an actual heroic deed. Cruella Devil is on probation and meets an artist who paints spots. When he looses his talent, Cruelly gats Horris and Jasper to steal the puppies for inspiration. After the artest gets fed up with Cruella, she goes back to her original plan of making a coat. It's up to Patch to save the day and become a one of a kind hero. The truth is, kids will love it and adults who grew up with the original will find it entertaining.",1043280000,2,1356,4.4063745019920315
1801054,4,B0000764FF,"This is one of the better Disney sequels. The animation, voices, and music have more thought behind them than previous sequels. The plot is good and and full of humor. ( Martin Short is very funny as Lars the artist as is Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt.) Patch is feeling lost in a sea of puppies becomes a hero in the end saving his family from Cruella. The story has something for adults as well as kids. If you and your children enjoy the original then this one will be enjoyable as well and worth the money.",1043280000,9,510,4.322916666666667
1801055,4,B0000764FF,"Finally, a part II that lives up to the classic! Why the four starzzzz???? It still has it's ups and downs! I feel the voices should have matched a little better. I felt that the animation was a little better than other Disney Part 2s! It adds up to being one of the top five best part lls so far! :)
GREAT JOB DISNEY! FINALLY LOL!",1043193600,2,331,4.03030303030303

I'm just wondering why a brand new, unopened movie didn't come with any Disney inserts. I'm wondering if this movie wasn't new. Or previously opened and then shrink wrapped again. I didn't get any inserts in the brand new movie nor the Disney rewards. That bothers me, as I know Disney puts those in there.
The shipping was fast. My daughter loved the movie. That's all fine, but as far as I knew, I was buying a brand new movie. There is always ads and such in there.",1494201600,,490,4.336956521739131

If you want your kids to watch a hundred and one Dalmatians movie show them the the original or even better the remake of the original.

1801177,3,B0000764FF,"Several songs, some whiny puppies/nasty siblings, evil incarnate in the form of Cruella De Vill, and a dog actor make for an inconsistent mix in this belated follow-up to the original film.  (This is not an adaptation of Dodie Smith's sequel to The Hundred and One Dalmatians, titled The Starlight Barking.)  Patch's London Adventure is a contrivance strictly from the Disney studio.  At least in this version Cruella was caught and punished, whereas in the original film she's last seen throwing a scene in a ditch.  But, in this sequel, they confuse matters by rehashing Cruella's need for a coat, utilizing the two dimwitted crooks from the first film, and by adding the story of a vain dog actor and his jealous sidekick.  For good measure, they tie it all together with the dog Patch now separated from his family.  Another car chase is tossed in for good measure.  Never has so much amounted to so little.  It's entirely too slick for its own good.",1417392000,,954,4.739393939393939

1801246,5,B0000764FF,"This is a TWO DISC set.  Each disc contains one of the movies.

I don't usually bother writing reviews, because it always opens a can of worms and reviews can eventually become a boxing match for the righteous. I don't have time for nit picking and nonsense.  However, I wanted to write this one to help others in the US avoid any stress in case they decide to buy this Blu Ray version, as it is a UK import.  Until my purchase arrived, I was unclear, because most reviews of the Blu Ray import are lacking in this basic, clear statement: IT WORKS.

So then, I will happily repeat myself for your benefit and will say that, first and foremost: IT WORKS IN US BLU RAY PLAYERS without a hitch! There are no PAL/NTSC issues. Also, as stated in the listing, it contains several languages including Spanish (which the Aladdin Import Blu Ray does not).

The video and audio quality are what you'd expect from a US Disney Blu Ray release, so I won't go into detail other than to say it both are excellent.

And while the Magic Code will not work in your US Disney rewards account, sadly, the bottom line is there is no need for you to wait for Disney to decide that Americans are finally ready for the honor and blessings of these wonderful films (I include Aladdin in this sarcasm) to be released domestically on Blu Ray.  You can get them now. I did the same with Dumbo, when Disney kept postponing the Blu Ray release date and when, two years later, they finally did release domestically, I didn't even flinch.  I thought I might, but I did not.

I will post this review as well in the Aladdin import Blu Ray page to help anyone trying to decide if they should get that one also.  If you want it, you should get that one as well.",1393804800,24,1725,4.309597523219814

You cannot possibly expect the same voices to return as many decades has separated the two productions, so it's just plain lucky that Disney protgs embarked on taking the task to begin with, and this is far superior entertainment to most or any of today's cartoons in the first place.
The animation plays closely to original and does not make a mockery of it's art deco style. All the characters are back that look exactly like a close follow up to first picture with not much time lapse. The DVD itself has plenty of fine features that include games, Thunderbolt dressing room tour, behind the scenes with some loveable real dogs on studio lot, and song videos that have good new material. Anyone expecting the real voices to return are asking for a bit much, and I'm glad the studios did make these features not simply as a gimmick, but a real creative follow up that flatters the real thing with fresh material and interesting original characters.",1333411200,,1090,4.682291666666667

In the excitement, puppy Patch gets left behind, and ends up connecting with his hero, cinema canine Thunderbolt (memorably voiced by Barry Bostwick).  Thunder, despite Patch's illusions about him, isn't really heroic at all--he just follows scripts.  But when his sidekick, Little Lightning (Jason Alexander), plots to push him out of their TV series and take his place, he resolves to try to prove himself.  And when Cruella deVille kidnaps all Patch's siblings once again, it's Thunder and Patch to the rescue.

My chief problem with this movie is its improbability--not so much in terms of the dogs and what they do, as in terms of Cruella and the Badduns' apparent fate (how did anyone find out they were responsible for the original dognapping, when only the dogs knew about it?).  And Cruella's brief conversion to patron of the arts seems rather out of character.  But as Patch discovers what heroism is really about, and Thunderbolt learns just what he's capable of doing, the story takes off, and in the end is curiously satisfying.  Though it's nowhere near as good as the original, it's still enjoyable and may spark some good discussion with your kids besides.",1258156800,2,1597,5.570247933884297

1801324,3,B0000764FF,"This animated sequel to Disney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/101-Dalmatians-Two-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000YERP2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">101 Dalmatians (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>&nbsp;is a very cute movie; very much at home on a video release, the animation and vocals are definitely above what you'd expect for a direct to video film. This tale begins where the first movie left off; Cruella de Vil is out on parole while her two flunkies are stuck in the slammer. She hooks up with a beatnik artist, Lars (voiced by Martin Short), who also likes spots. She hires him to create a one-of-a-kind masterpiece just for her. Meanwhile, Anita (voiced by Jodi Benson, best known as Ariel in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid-Two-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000F8O35U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>) & Roger are moving to the country. Patch accidentally gets left behind, which is just fine with him, as it allows him to go to London and audition for his TV Hero's show, the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour. When Lars is unable to satisfy Cruella with his art, she decides to go after the Dalmatians again and have Lars use their fur coats as a canvas!

There are some life lessons for the kids as you would expect; Thunderbolt's (voiced by Barry Bostwick) thirst for fame and vanity are not very admirable traits. Naturally, when he teams up with cute little Patch, he realizes (and hopefully the kids watching will too) that there are more important things in life.

Overall, this film is fine for children, other than some off-camera violence where Cruella knocks out a dog (who eventually wakes up unharmed) and the fact that Cruella actually does smoke in the film. The smoking shouldn't be a big deal as she is so over the top and nutty that it is obvious that she is not a person to be looked up to or imitated!

The backgrounds and animation style do a very good job of trying to follow the same stylings of the original. Although they lack the amazing artistry of animator Marc Davis & art director Ken Anderson, they are definitely better than most of the TV animation you find today.

This DVD also has some nice extras:

*A 7 minute behind-the-scenes ""Dog-umentary,"" which is a look at how the movie was made, hosted by a group of dogs who are being given a tour of the Disney Studio. It shows Bostwick, Jason Alexander (voice of Lightning, Thunderbolt's sidekick), Susanne Blakeslee (Cruella), and Martin Short recording their parts. It's also interesting to see art director Bill Perkins create the backgrounds and how the unique hand-drawn/xerox style is achieved.

*""Try Again"" & ""You're The One"" music videos

*3 games: ""Patch's Twilight Adventure"" in which the player looks for keys to help free the dalmatians from their cages; ""Lost in London"" is somewhat of a travelogue of London complete with footage of famous landmarks as players (once again) try to track down the dalmatian puppies; and ""Thunderbolt: A Look Inside"" lets you tour the canine star's trailer.

Specs for the movie are Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound with French & Spansih language tracks, and Widescreen (1.66:1). Approximately 71 minutes.

Overall, an enjoyable family film to watch with your children.",1221523200,9,3345,5.417307692307692
1801335,4,B0000764FF,"I expected this movie to be a lame sequel, since I really hadn't heard anything about it.  But I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it made me nostalgic about the original which was my favorite movie growing up.  I really felt for Patch, who had to deal with being not one of a kind as he liked, but 1 of 101, which is clearly intense competition.  He gets himself seperated from the rest of his family and into cahoots with Thunderbird, the ""wonder-dog"" from his favorite TV show.  They both have to find the true hero within and once again save the puppies from the clutches of madwoman Cruella Devil.  The original characters all come back, from Pongo and Perdita, Roger and Anita, Cruella and her goons, the feisty nanny and of course the puppies.  The new characters blend in perfectly; Lars the artist who paints spots and is quickly discovered by Cruella, and the dogs from the Thunderbird show.  The animation was done in a similar fashion as the original, which made it seem more closely linked.  In general an enjoyable movie and a stronger urge to own a dalmatian myself.  :)",1122076800,7,1078,4.572916666666667

1801337,5,B0000764FF,"I like this particular Disney sequel a lot--and that's not a commonly stated thing. Lars and Little Lightning are easily two of the best newer Disney characters. And the entire film is well-made and enjoyable. However, my one issue with the movie is that Lightning the pembroke corgi is made out, just a little bit, to be a sort of 'bad guy.' He isn't in the least. He didn't start out as a treacherous little dog looking to outshine the 'hero,' Thunderbolt. Au contraire, he spent a lot of time just trying to make the best of being in that ham's shadow. Lightning was a great dog, from the beginning and through to the end. Is it any wonder that at one point he would try to take the TV show for himself? After being treated as an underdog, a mere sidekick, receiving no attention, having to watch the girls swoon over Thunderbolt and shun him? Hardly. Yet this means the movie is successful in creating a character inspiring sympathy. So bravo, Disney; if you could turn out a few more sequels on this level it would be a whole lot nicer!",1110153600,3,1041,4.427083333333333

Thunderbolt has to ""find himself"", with all the emotional conflict of whether or not he wants to be a real hero or not is too much for a kid to enjoy, much less the adult having to watch this nonsense.

1801341,4,B0000764FF,"Set immediately after the ending of the original 1961 film, Patch's London Adventure begins as Roger and his wife, Nanny and 101 dalmatians are moving out to their ""dalmatian plantation"".  Unfortunately in all the excitement Patch has been left behind, so he begins to make his way across London when he meets his hero, Thunderbolt.  At the same time, Cruella has fallen off the fur coat wagon, broken Jasper and Horace out of jail, teamed up with an abstract painter and begun looking for the puppies.

The action here is more muddled than in the original.  Also, a lot of favorite characters are ignored or missing; for instance, when Roger finds out Patch is not at the farm, he and Anita, Pongo and Perdita take off in a car to find him, but we don't see them again until the last scene.  Neither do we see hide nor hair of the Great London Barking Chain and its charming denizens such as The Colonel and Sgt. Tibbs.

DVD features include a trivia game, an interactive look inside Thunderbolt's trailer, a 7-minute making-of featurette, two music videos and 7 trailers.  Audio is in English or French, and subtitles are available only  in English.

Because the placement of the live-action sequel starring Glenn Close takes place after these events, it might be fun and less confusing to watch the original and then this one as a double feature.",1065398400,,1349,4.706382978723404
