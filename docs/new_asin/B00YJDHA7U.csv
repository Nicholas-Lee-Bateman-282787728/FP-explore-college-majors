7222855,4,B00YJDHA7U,"This ""American Experience"" documentary  doesn't exactly shatter the myth of Walt Disney as ""Uncle Walt, that happy master of fantasy who made dreams come true"", but it definitely  is not a sweet valentine to his greatness, either.  Disney was definitely flawed, but, yes, he was  also visionary, creative, and a genius. People either seem to love or loathe Disney. He was either somebody who had a negative, ruinous effect on popular culture, or somebody who made all our dreams come true. Both sides of Disney are presented in this penetrating, absorbing, almost four hours long documentary.
  You could say, correctly, that Disney was ""obsessed""-- obsessed with being THE BEST at everything he set out to do. But his quests for perfection came at a heavy personal price. The beginning of the documentary charts his early years, his struggles for success, Mickey Mouse, his nervous breakdown in 1931,  ""Silly Symphonies"" and, of course, ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs."" I'd forgotten what a gamble, in every way, ""Snow White"" was. If ""Snow White"" had not been a success, Disney would have been done. ""Snow White"" was hailed as a masterpiece and, with the profits, Disney built a bigger studio in Burbank.
  The biggest myth that is shattered here is that Disney Studios was a great place to work. Of course, some of his employees adored him. But there was a hierarchy, and huge wage discrepancies, at Disney Studios. The fantasy behind the scenes came to an end with the Animation Strike of 1941 and, more specifically and personally, Disney at war with Art Babbitt, one of his top and most respected animators. The hard-hearted and hurt Disney refused to even try to negotiate with labor unions. Walt, instead, took off for South America, leaving his more practical-minded brother Roy, to resolve the mess. Walt was unable to understand how or why anybody could be ""against him."" And if you weren't ""with Walt"", you were against him. Apparently, if Walt was not your great friend, he was a cold S.O.B. To hear Walt tell it, all his troubles were caused by a Communist Conspiracy. And yes, Walt was one of the people who ""named names"" during the notorious McCarthy Communist Witch Hunts, beginning in 1947.
  Artistically and critically, Disney films were hit and miss. ""Pinocchio,"" his lushly animated but decidedly dark coming of age tale, won praise. But his bold experiment ""Fantasia"" was met with a ""what the hell is he doing?""  reaction. The heart-tugging ""Dumbo"" and ""Bambi"" failed to earn back their production costs. It took another fairy-tale princess, ""Cinderella"", to revive Disney Studios' sagging fortunes in 1950. Privately, Walt despaired he would never make another film that would measure up to ""Snow White"", and he stopped trying. ""Peter Pan"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"", among others, are not even mentioned in this extensive documentary, because, one suspects, Walt was not emotionally interested or invested in these films.
  By now, Walt was interested in creating a perfect world that never really existed to begin with. Disneyland became the perfect project for his control-freak tendencies. Walt couldn't control people, or the public and critical response to his films, but certainly he could, and did, control the creation of his OWN amusement park!! The creation of Disneyland, and how it was designed to be the ""ultimate escape from reality:, is fascinating.
  Success, on any level, was never enough. Walt remained an odd and unsatisfied enigma. How could a man who received more Academy Awards than anyone else in Hollywood still feel like a Hollywood Outsider? Old wounds hurt deeply. And Walt was hurt that ""Snow White"" did not receive a nomination as ""Best Picture"" in 1938. Walt wanted a film that would earn a ""Best Picture"" nomination. And so, ""Mary Poppins"" became Walt's last passion project. ""Poppins"" picked up a bag full of nominations and awards, but not the BIG ""Best Picture"" prize Walt wanted. ""Mary Poppins"", the story of how a no-nonsense, supernatural nanny fixes a dysfunctional family, delighted everyone EXCEPT P.L. Travers, the prickly ""Poppins"" author herself (but that is another story). Walt's story is always fascinating, if you don't mind that this documentary knocks ""happy Uncle Walt""  off his pedestal a bit.",1443139200,10,4267,5.072857142857143

7222858,4,B00YJDHA7U,"I feel that visually this film was fantastic. archival films, home movies were terrific as well as the content through the first five films. on ce it got into the union problems that Disney had  it  strayed into politics and left  behind the creativity that were the films, Peter Pan Sleeping Beauty 101 Dalmations  and the Jungle Book. the very popular films of Hayley Mills  and live action films like Shaggy dog old yeller swiss family were not mentioned at all. this was a great time for the studio. I grew up during that era. a new Disney film was an event. this film doesn't capture that. in fact from Disneyland forward it seemed rushed. I still like the film but it could have been much better",1442361600,6,701,4.488188976377953
7222859,3,B00YJDHA7U,"I would say this is 3 1/2 stars. If you want to learn about Walt Disney without exerting too much energy to read a book or view his library of films with a fresh, adult perspective, you'll be perfectly satisfied with this documentary. You'll get a good overview of the man that delves into key elements of his life and work. If you are looking for a flawless, definitive work, then watch it and then seek out the WALT DISNEY: MAN BEHIND THE MYTH documentary to fill in the gaps and make corrections.

There's a lot of rich, previously unseen photographs here, great archival video, and vibrant clips from some of Disney's greatest films. There's lively discussion of the production of ""Snow White"" and a rare look at Walt Disney as a business manager. This documentary sheds like on the strike almost completely missing from the MAN BEHIND THE MYTH documentary.  That said, this documentary suffers greatly from an over-reliance on historians and ""historians"" to retell the story in place of living people who witnessed it first-hand and archival interviews of those who lived, worked, and breathed the same oxygen as the man. As a result, the first half of the film attempts to pass supposition as fact, as if historians and ""historians"" can draw conclusions about Walt Disney's feelings, emotions, and motivations that have not been recorded in the substantial amount of first-hand narrative that Disney and his colleagues have left behind. There is even the rather ludicrous idea expressed that Walt Disney had conversations with himself as Mickey Mouse, which is completely unsubstantiated. Neal Gabler, Michael Barrier, Richard Schickel, Don Hahn, and Tom Sito are recognized experts in the field of Disney, but when some of the other historians are talking, we are getting weak interpretations, obvious statements, and sometimes misstatements (the description of Mickey Mouse as a personality, for example, doesn't hold up to the films themselves). There are a few out and out falsehoods and missing information that taint the documentary--such as the idea that Disney left for South America for a vacation at the height of the strike (he was actually on a long-planned government-sponsored Goodwill Tour of South America that was to result in South American-flavored films, films which are never mentioned in the documentary). Also, ""Song of the South"" warrants a substantial amount of screen time--of interest to Disney fans and historians--but other than the controversy that has always followed the movie, it is not a movie particularly relevant to Disney's body of work (Disney's ""So Dear to My Heart"" is probably the closest Disney ever came to realizing the idealized version of Americana and his Midwestern upbringing in Marceline and would have been a far more relevant topic to discuss). There are many aspects of Disney's personality that are missing from the discussion--his demand for control over all of his live-action movies, his willingness to risk big on projects he believed in, the love many of his later employees had for him, the unique culture of the studio he created, his visionary leadership skills in spite of his poor people management skills, among others.

Oliver Platt's narration is decidedly flat, as if he was narrating a documentary thirty years ago, and it's annoying that we consistently hear voices discussing events over archival pictures before we get a chance to know who is talking; considering the questionable nature of some of the historians, it's problematic.

That said, anything that explores the world of Walt Disney is going to be fascinating on some level. Watch it, and just keep in mind that no documentary or biography will ever fully capture one person, and this one has a few more flaws than others. To supplement your learn, do check out the WALT DISNEY: THE MAN BEHIND THE MYTH documentary and read Michael Barrier's harsh but telling biography THE ANIMATED MAN.",1442275200,49,3926,5.082170542635659
7222860,5,B00YJDHA7U,"This four-hour documentary on American icon, Walt Disney, will air on PBS in September and be released on DVD by PBS Home Video at that time. I was provided an advance screening copy in order to provide an objective review.

Like many who will read this review, I grew up on Walt Disney films and, in my case, Walt Disney on television. (This was long before cable and The Disney Channel and goes back to The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC TV.).  I don't want to give any spoilers here but there are so many fun facts that you will learn, like the fact that it was ABCs payment to Disney to do the TV show, that provided the final financing needed to finish Disneyland (in California, not Florida).

The producers and directors were able to acquire some amazing archival footage of Walt at work and in his home life. The story starts, of course, with his childhood and his relationship with his father (not good) and brother Roy (good) and shows how he first created Oswald the Rabbit and then Mickey Mouse. We learn how he created his own studio and then had many employees leave him over wages. He was able to build things back up again with his first hit Snow White. The major animated films are covered as well as Fantasia and Mary Poppins. Then we move on to the creation and building of Disneyland and how close he got to not opening on time.  There is a small section on TV series like Davy Crockett and The Mickey Mouse Club, but his life was so busy that four hours really isn't enough. And yes, there is an honest discussion Disneys film (never released on home video), Song of the South.
As you get to the last hour of the film, you hear about Walts plans for Disney World and EPCOT and it is then that you realize that the park was not completed until after he died and is much different than he envisioned. And, when you realize that he died at the young age of 65, and see all that he accomplished, its truly amazing.

There are interviews with Walts biographer, Neil Gabler (who you may remember for his years reviewing movies on PBS with Jeffrey Lyons when Siskel and Ebert went commercial), Walts son-in-law and an array of film historians. I must say that every one of those interviewed were fun to listen to and excellent communicators (unlike some dry talking heads).

No you won't hear about The Little Mermaid, Aladdin or any of the CGI animated films. Those were done by Walt Disney Studios, under CEOS like Michael Eisner. This documentary goes only as far as Walts life. But what a life!

I cant think of anyone who won't want to see the film and rewatch it on DVD. The DVD does not have any bonus features but it does have chapter stops (though many of the chapters are long).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7222861,5,B00YJDHA7U,"Brilliant, insightful. engrossing. Sure, I grew up racing home from school to catch ""The Mickey Mouse Club"", and watching ""The Wonderful World of Color"" on our brand new first color t.v. console in our foyer. And, I remember seeing ""Snow White"" on the big screen when I was even younger. I recall the clamor when Disneyland went up, although I was based some three thousand miles east. And, I recall being at least a little disappointed when so many years later, I finally visited the legendary place, and found it arid, antiseptic, contrived, nothing reflective of anything in my experience. Then there were the contrarians: Schickel's ""The Disney Version"", Zappa's comment that Disney represented the antithesis of creativity, and Paul Krassner's hilarious scatological reimagining of Walt Disney's world. So, it came as some surprise that I was immediately captured by this warts and all biography, and left with the conclusion that for better or worse, and mostly better, Disney was a true American original genius. As this four hour film makes abundantly clear, the man had vision, courage, and unbelievable tenacity. Was he always likeable or on the right side of history? No, but how could such a man be? His first five feature length animations pretty much created a new art form. Whether Disneyland is the happiest place on earth is highly debatable (just ask some of the former employees), but it was such a monumental undertaking, and has apparently given so much pleasure for more than a half century, that its success must be acknowledged, even if I'm one who believes the Disnefication of American entertainment has been a commercial triumph, but not the best thing for the various arts it has touched. No question the man himself has been long gone, and I can't help but wonder how he'd have felt about having a new Star Wars sequel in movie theatres virtually every Christmas. In any case, after watching this expertly produced film, it's hard not to acknowledge that Disney the man was one of a kind, and that the impression he left on our culture is permanent and indelible. All in all, one of the best American Experience projects ever!",1504742400,,2155,4.923076923076923

7222884,2,B00YJDHA7U,"Walt Disney, one of the most prolific geniuses in Hollywood gets a 2-part biography, heavy on still images, short on contextualization and slightly biased. We're meant to understand Walt herein as a sort of short-tempered tyrant who demanded his way or the highway from his employees, held dominion over his empire with a rather insincere cruelty for keeping everyone in check, but respected the talent that made him a lot of money and elevated the prestige of the art of animation along the way.

We don't get a lot of first-hand accounts. Let's be honest, a good many of Walt's contemporaries are gone. But it would have been prudent of this American Masters doc to seek out and gain access to all the archived interviews conducted with Walt and a lot of people who knew and truly understood the man. This documentary plays like a coming attraction for a feature we never entirely get to see. Very superficial rendering of one of the giants in the medium of film. Disappointing and not terrible comprehensive. A life as rich and varied as Walt's really needs a more thorough exploration and praise worthy accounting for his clairvoyance in the art of animation, TV and the creation of an entire empire built to satisfy his visions of a collective North American childhood. This isn't that documentary, folks. It's tongue-in-cheek and begrudgingly praises Walt's accomplishments while seeking out minor incidents that are then blown up to suggest Walt wasn't perfect and, perhaps, even slightly unworthy of our respect. I didn't buy this to learn dirty little secrets which, in the grand scheme of a life richly lived, pale to the myriad of treasures Walt wrought for the good of all mankind. And no - that's not gushing praise on my part - just a little closer to the reality of who Walt was - not perfect - but striving for perfection and a chance to share it with his fellow man. You won't find any praise half as worthy in this documentary. Pity that. Pass on this offering.",1463184000,3,1979,4.752906976744186

This film highlights how important and groundbreaking Disney was for American culture. It does show his weaknesses as well as his strengths.

It also contains the obligatory politically-correct sneering about Disney being too white and protestant. But I can ignore that, and I'm always glad for balancing viewpoints. The thing that is a little harder to understand is adult critics, both then and now, talking about children's movies and theme parks as if they were intended for adults. That's a head-scratcher.

7222891,4,B00YJDHA7U,"I've been a long time fan of Walt Disney and I have seen or read just about every credible (some not so credible) source available. I bought this DVD after seeing a small section of it on PBS. The Documentary is full of wonderful information pointing out the good and bad of Walt Disney. If you're looking for a sugar coated account of his life don't look here, but if you'd like to at least entertain the thought of Disney being a perfectionist who demanded a lot from his employees this is a pretty revealing account of some major points in his life.

The DVD is set of in 2 parts and each part is approx. an hour and 55 minutes long. Nearly 4 hours are spent on this extremely interesting man that many called Uncle Walt. What I liked most about this documentary is that they don't pull any punches. Walt was a genius, but he was a flawed man, a slave driver and consumed by his ambitions.

The documentary starts out with his childhood, early animation career and then on to his crown jewel Snow White. It's quite thorough, but it would have been even better if it was even longer. There is enough information missing to fill another segment of the same length. It skims over Walt's history with Ub Iwerks more than it should, but what's here is very well done.

The segments include old footage, newer interviews and some great stills. The DVD is presented in excellent SD quality, but naturally the old footage is rough in spots. No amount of restoration is going to make this stuff look good in HD. Part 1 covers the early years up until the end of the first era of animated classics. Part 2 shows Walt's animators strike, the hardships of the studio after the films following Snow White lost money on their initial runs. It goes into great detail on this and even know I have seen a lot of documentaries on this man, I found much to discover here.

It also covers Uncle Walt planning and building Disneyland, creating his TV show and his later obsession with trains. While I know that Walt had little to do with the animated features later, the last film they mention is Cinderella. It's a shame as while he wasn't anywhere near as hands on with later films as he was with Snow White, he certainly must have picked the stories, so it would have added a lot if that had at least mentioned what films were being produced while he was preoccupied with building Disneyland and his TV show. The documentary ends a little abruptly with Walt buying up land in Florida and dying from Cancer. It is done tastefully and is heart felt as even with this man's flaws there is no doubt his employees cared for him deeply.

Running almost 4 hours it would seem like enough, but this would have been even better if 6 hours. I'm not knocking this documentary in any way and if you're a fan of Walt Disney you definitely want to pick this up. There is no bonus material, but at close to 4 hours it doesn't need any.",1456272000,4,2905,4.392193308550186

Seeing how Snow White, Cinderella, Mary Poppins, and all these classic films got made was fantastic to watch. If you're a Disney fan, you'll love this documentary, but know that Walt was not a perfect man (none of us are).

7222905,3,B00YJDHA7U,"I was so looking forward to this. I watched twice through and am disappointed. It offers drastically new versions of old tales- for example, in this version, Disney does not create Mickey on the train ride back to L.A. after losing Oswald in NYC, but afterwards, via brainstorming with Iwerks and others on his staff in L.A. Maybe this is the truth- it sounds more likely- but there are so many undoubted historical errors, such as that Snow White was the world's first attempt at a feature-length cartoon, that the film's credibility is far from certain. There are new angles on old stories that are interesting, such as that Walt lost his Oswald staff because they were annoyed with his glory- and money-hogging ways, anticipating the origins of the first strike. But my biggest beef is the endless explainers- people like Neal Gabler going on and on about what this or that so obviously means, often redundantly and almost always unnecessarily. This stuff eats up a huge amount of the four hours and ultimately deadens the whole thing. Too bad.",1448928000,3,1047,4.822222222222222

7222909,1,B00YJDHA7U,"Like many Disney enthusiasts, and with lots of buzz from friends and family, I was excited to see the PBS American Experience covering Walt Disney. Pleased to see the diversity of the authors/fellows who were made available for narrative, I was hopeful for the viewing. In the affect of hearing the retelling of a story we've heard & read many times, I felt jolted in my understanding of Walt. So difficult to listen to individuals who were portraying him in the ways they were. The delivery of facts, even with an attempt at unbiased opinion, fell upon the excessive air time of opinionated statements and poor sequence. The timing of the release is impeccable. As the generation of the original artists passes away, the next generation writes a new history to be understood. I don't think so folks. I am only an enthusiast in search of the real story, I strongly recommend going to the Disney Family Museum and pursuing Disney history a little less force fed off screen, read Walt Disney by Bob Thomas (my favorite), The Animated Man by Michael Barrier (www.michaelbarrier.com) (who appears on this PBS-AE film),or check out the film  Walt: The Man Behind the Myth produced by Walter Elias Disney Miller (available right here on amazon) just to name a few..... good luck my fellow fan",1447977600,8,1286,4.819004524886878

7222927,1,B00YJDHA7U,"Huge opportunity lost  pinched in spirit  at times flat out wrong, factually and tonally, in ways both big and small. This documentary, however well intentioned, never comes to grips with why Walt Disney epitomized the American Dream and was, therefore, the pluperfect choice for a series called The American Experience. Disney is not just famous for being famous. He was the dominant figure in 20th century American culture, and remains, even now, a significant force in our lives. The makers of this film seem to have been virtually clueless with respect to what Walt and all that he wrought meant  and still mean  in artistic, cinematic, cultural, and societal terms . . . which may explain why this four-hour forced march through his life could not deliver a more rounded, satisfying, and broadly contextualized sense of his historical importance.

As for the factual deficiencies . . . Jiminy Crickets! For one thing, there is no discussion anywhere in the film of Donald Duck (the id to Mickey Mouses ego) ... and, no, there was no markedly dark side to Disney, as Neal Gabler would have it. Walt was not deprived of a proper childhood, his father did not mistreat or fail to love him,  and, yes, he was a gifted artist. Disney loved his dad. He once teasingly accused him of having been kind of ornery, but used the same word to describe himself. As a boy and as a young man Walts goal was to become a political cartoonist. His youthful drawings reveal a talent on a par with much of the graphic work being published circa 1920, so much so that a Kansas City newspaper offered him the position of editorial cartoonist.

Disney abandoned that goal because there was much else he wanted or was driven to do  and, no doubt, because he knew he could never stay chained to a drawing board, confined to daily graphic commentary on politicians and public issues. Instead, he fell in love with moviemaking and in particular, animation, two cutting-edge machine-age media that afforded him an infinitely greater opportunity to pursue his dreams as an artist, a storyteller, and showman. Animation, as he discovered, is a quasi-industrial business  nothing like the solitary (often alcohol-fueled) quotidian existence of a print cartoonist. From a purely practical angle, no artist laboring alone (even one more skilled than Walt) could hope to produce films like the Mickey Mouse sound cartoons that sent his career into permanent orbit, much less the string of classic feature-length cartoons he started making in the mid 1930s.

There is a bizarre array of talking heads on this DVD. Several of the politically correct academics clearly were hostile to Disney and/or ignorant about him and his accomplishments (and pop culture as well, actually).  Two of the credentialed experts, Gabler and Steven Watts, referred to the Snow White film as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Journalist Ron Suskind  an engaging man personally  is a very fine writer, not an authority on Walt, and why he was allowed to waste a valuable chunk of screen time imitating Disney mimicking Mickey is baffling. Even worse, the original music composed for the soundtrack tends to be dirge-like, and the narrator comes across as an earnest cleric who never met the deceased but has been tasked to eulogize and put a best-possible face on a marginally sketchy life.

The film saps much of the joy and humanity out of its subject, both Disney individually and his many achievements, which  no one can deny  from Mickey and Minnie to ""Dumbo, from Disneyland to Mary Poppins, have delighted millions upon millions of people, in America and around the world.

Better to buy the 2004 documentary (also available on Amazon), Walt, The Man Behind the Myth: A Portrait of a Legend from Those Who Knew Him Best. Its much shorter (87 min. as opposed to 240 min.), and far more expensive than the PBS product, but it comes closer to faithfully, honestly, and sincerely capturing the essence of Walt Disney in a way this disappointing project does not.",1444435200,32,4013,4.88659793814433

Through rare archival footage, home movies, people who worked with him,  historians, and, of course, his wonderful films, you get a rare glimpse of the man behind the magic. Trust me. This doesnt soft soap Uncle Walt. In my mind, it makes him more real. More engaging. More endearing than ever! It paints him as the true visionary he was. Weather it was the first sound cartoon, Mickey Mouse in Steamboat Willie, the first full-length animated feature film, Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs or the creation of Disneyland and Disney World, this film paints a flesh and blood portrait of the man Walt Disney was. My final thought here, is that, perhaps PBS should do a sequel. Life After Disney. But then again, like most sequels it would pale in comparison.
