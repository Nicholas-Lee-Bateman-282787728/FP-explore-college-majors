8122289,1,B000FGG5IA,"Lethargic storytelling, poorly done, narrated by an updated Elvira in a black bustier.  For much better NY ghost stories, find Louis Jones' Things That Go Bump in the Night.",1250467200,,173,4.9655172413793105
8122290,4,B000FGG5IA,"As a native of Central New York I found this to be interesting, since most of us grow up hearing these stories. The production on this was very good. I'm a bit dissapointed that they left two of the most popular hautings in Syracuse. The Landmark Theatre and ""13 Curves"".  I would really love to see another dvd featuring other hauintings in the area.",1169424000,,351,4.484375
8122291,5,B000FGG5IA,I watched this documentary style piece and was fascinated with the supernatural stories in Central New York.  The topics were edge of your seat and the treatment was very professional.  The whole things was well put together and I look forward to seeing more things like this to buy.,1168473600,,283,4.755102040816326
