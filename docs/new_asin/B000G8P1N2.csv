8129604,4,B000G8P1N2,"Amazon has no listing for this edition, so I will put it here.  This is for the Lone Rider Double Feature DVD-R from VCI.  LR Fights Back has quite good audio/video quality and no dialogue splices.  Issues are original title card has been replaced(PRC opening logo is present, then goes to British Equity title card, then back to original credits).  Apparantly sourced from a British print, DVD running time is 60 min. and sources list the running time as 64 min.  LR in Ghost Town also has good audio/video quality, although just a bit dark.  All credits are original and it is not splicy.  DVD running time is 53 min. and sources list a range of 58 to 64 min.",1357344000,,661,4.458333333333333
