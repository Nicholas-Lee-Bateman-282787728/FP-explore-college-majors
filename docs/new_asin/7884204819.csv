8597777,1,7884204819,"Hi a few weeks ago I ordered the Around the World - Prague, Czech Travel DVD in English for my mother's 86th birthday.  I received a dvd in Japanese/Chinese with English subtitles.  I notified the seller of the error in writing (using the address on the package), and requested that he send me a dvd in English.  I told him when I received the corrected dvd, I would be happy to then send the incorrect copy back to him. I have not had a response.  We have been very happy in being able to use Amazon.com until this problem.  Please advise me as to what I should do at this point.  I emailed the vendor Bible in My Language today and am waiting for a response.  The purchase price was $23.98.",1392163200,,692,4.236641221374046
