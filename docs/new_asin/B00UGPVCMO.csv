8705907,4,B00UGPVCMO,"Fred MacMurray as a fast-talking press agent? No problem... (Alida) Valli (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-THIRD-MAN/dp/B003ULW74S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE THIRD MAN</a>&nbsp;fame) as a doomed aspiring actress? Sure, why not... Lee J. Cobb as a tough-as-nails studio head? Great! Frank Sinatra as the kindly Catholic priest of a poor parish? Better than you'd think.....!

MIRACLE OF THE BELLS is a somewhat strange tale told in multiple flashbacks. Without giving too much away (but there are SPOILERS ahead!), Hollywood press agent Bill Dunnigan (MacMurray) relates the first time he meets aspiring actress Olga Treskovna nee Trocki (Valli), who he eventually falls deeply in love with, but keeps his feelings to himself. Olga, who's obviously not well (she coughs a lot), gets the one-in-a-million chance to star in a major film. Unfortunately she dies after the filming, causing the studio head Marcus Harris (Cobb) to shelve it. Dunnigan accompanies her body back to the small Pennsylvania coal town of her birth, where following her wishes he approaches the priest of her poor parish, Father Paul (Sinatra) to officiate at her funeral. Although heartbroken AND broke, Dunnigan has an inspiration to show his love and honor her memory. He pays all the local churches, with bad checks no less, to ring their bells continually for three days hoping to garner enough publicity to force Harris to release the film. While failing to move Harris, the resulting publicity causes the priest of the other, and wealthier Catholic church to try blackmailing Dunnigan into having her funeral there. Harris, although still unmoved, wires money to cover Dunnigan's debts. The now defeated agent goes to Father Paul's church for the funeral service, where a ""miracle"" occurs, saving the film, Father Paul's parish, Olga's memory, and Dunnigan's faith......

MIRACLE OF THE BELLS's detractors usually focus on it's convoluted maudlin plot, very relaxed pacing and Sinatra's atypically quiet performance as a priest. It certainly won't ""ring the bell"" of anyone expecting fast action, wacky comedy or singing from Sinatra, although he does get to perform a short hymn. If you like two-hankie uplifting mildly religious-themed fare with a tenuous Christmas connection, it may ring yours. One thing that impressed me about the plot (and is a MAJOR spoiler) was Father Paul's willingness to expose the cause for ""the miracle"" instead of milking it. It's also hard not to think that author Jean Shepard, whose anthology ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-God-We-Trust-All-Others-Pay-Cash/dp/0385021747/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash</a>"" was the basis for the perennial&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-CHRISTMAS-STORY/dp/B00E3WKWWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A CHRISTMAS STORY</a>&nbsp;was inspired by the ""Christmas dinner in a Chinese restaurant"" scene......

Besides it being one of my late girlfriend's favorite movies, another reason I have a soft spot for this film is it's setting. I live in Northeastern Pennsylvania where the fictional ""Coaltown"" is located, not that far from the actual cities of Nanticoke, the location for the film's train station scenes, and the oft mentioned Wilkes-Barre (although there is a real Coaltown in PA, but it's on the far western side of the state). The portrayals of the wealthy condescending mine and business owners, the priest with the  ""rich"" parish, the humble dirt-poor but kindhearted miners and their poorer parish, all ring true for the area's history. It's also ironic that Lee J. Cobb, whose character fires an ""foreign"" actress for her un-American comments while praising his country, was later blacklisted in the 1950's. While researching this review I also found that although they were only acquaintances, when Cobb later suffered a heart attack and financial difficulties, Frank Sinatra not only helped him, he also had him live in his house until he was back on his feet. The RKO production released by Olive Films looks quite good on Blu-ray (it's also available on DVD) with only some occasional light scratches and speckles. It's probably the best you'll ever see, it's doubtful a full restoration or Criterion treatment is on the books. MIRACLE OF THE BELLS is an interesting piece of film history and worth seeing for the cast alone. Those who complain about the incredibly coincidental plot need to remember one thing...it's only a movie.....!",1459987200,,4567,5.711764705882353
