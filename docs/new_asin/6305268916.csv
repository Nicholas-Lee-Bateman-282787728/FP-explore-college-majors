1011819,5,6305268916,"I recently visited my 2 yearold niece and had never seen VeggiTales. If you even mentioned the video she was ready to watch. I laughed so hard when the silly song started The Song of the 3 Cebu (say-boo). I found myself  singing the song 3 days after I came back home. I believe the people who  put these video's together have struck gold. I did tell my sister to watch  out when she feeds my niece a tomato or cucumber she might hear the words  ""No, no eat Bob or Larry"". I don't believe anyone buying these  video's will be disappointed. I can't wait to see what new one's they will  come up with.",938131200,3,599,4.165217391304348
1011820,5,6305268916,"I think that ""Josh and the Big Wall"" is the funniest retelling of the Isrealites and their defeat of Jericho. While entertaining kids, it  inconspicuously teaches them about obeying God and their parents.  ""Veggie Tales"" are the funnest way to learn about God and  virtues. A wonderful video,  cleverly written, and funny. And the Silly  Songs with Larry segment is very entertaining, too! The song about a boy  and his three ""cebus"" (say-boo)is imossible to not like. The  tune, the words, and the story is irresistable! A #1 in kid's videos. Bob  the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber present the idea of obedience in a  positive way. They always talk about improving and obeying so kids won't  feel bad about not having obeyed in the past. A GREAT VIDEO.",936057600,25,753,4.767441860465116

I loved this video because it's silly (slushies are poured on character's heads).  Veggie Tales are always funny.  They make silly versions of what actually happened to people in Bible stories.

Having enjoyed Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail in college and beyond, this little children's film (with healthy morals and God's Word) tickled my funny bone with the parallels to the MP film.  I had the brief pleasure to have an unexpected meeting with the father of one of the creators of VT and we both laughed about that particular inspiration - and I felt a little justified in making the comparison when even the dad was making it!

In this they actually speak often and complain too at times the Bible says they were quiet.  While it does ""entertain"", I worry about teaching incorrect stories to our children. God did not put things in the Bible for kicks & giggles.  Everything has a purpose so for them to change this story's details changes the meaning behind it.

1013381,5,6305268916,"The opening countertop finds Junior Asparagus filling in for Larry the Cucumber, who is sleeping in today (he was tired after the last show). Junior and Bob the Tomato field a question for Victor from Sausalito, California about obedience. Using their imaginations, Bob and Junior are transported to the Holy Land so that they can tell the show's story.
Bob acts as narrator and provides Junior with some background information. The Israelites, having been held as slaves in Egypt, are liberated by Moses (played by Mr. Nezzer) and led to the Promised Land. However, they question God's methods and are banished from Israel for forty years. Upon the completion of their exile, Moses has already died, and Joshua (played by Larry) has become leader of the Israelites. With everybody eager to finally reach the Promised Land after four decades of waiting, Joshua leads the Israelites to their new home, but are halted in their tracks by one big obstacle -- the city of Jericho.
The story is interrupted here for Silly Songs with Larry. ""Song of the Cebu"", introduced as a ""sequential image, stereophonic, multimedia event"", finds Larry on the countertop with a slide projector and a captive audience (Jimmy Gourd, Jerry Gourd, and Junior Asparagus). The song, about a boy and three cebus (and a hippo) frequently goes off track and is interrupted several times by Archibald Asparagus. When the song ends abruptly and without any sort of conclusion, Archibald is furious and threatens to inform Bob about this utter failure of a song (foreshadowing the events of the next episode).
When the story resumes, the Israelites are confronted by the defenders of Jericho (the French Peas), who taunt them from atop the city's great wall. Joshua explains that God has given this land to the Israelites and that therefore the defenders will have to step aside. They are met by more insults and smug jeering. When a slushy drink accidentally falls and hits Jimmy, they fall back and regroup.
That night, the Israelites argue about what to do. Pa Grape wants to go back to Egypt, while Jimmy and Jerry are convinced that they need heavy firepower to destroy the wall and run off to construct their weapon. Trying to escape the arguing, Joshua wanders off in hopes that he can hear God for advice. During his solitude, Joshua meets the Commander of the Army of the Lord (played by Archibald Asparagus), who tells him how the Israelites are to take Jericho: they must march around the city once a day for six days, then on the seventh day they are to march around it seven times, blow their horns, and all yell at the same time. At this point, the messenger states, the walls of Jericho will fall.
Joshua reports the plan to the rest of the Israelites the next morning. Naturally, this plan leads to some serious doubts. Jimmy and Jerry then show off their alternate plan: a giant rocket named ""The Wallminator 3000"" which the Israelites applaude (despite not having hands). Joshua, however, insists that they agree to try it God's way, and they all proceed to Jericho.
As the Israelites march around the wall, the city's defenders insult them all the more, turning their taunts into a choreographed musical number while the Israelites try to ignore them. However, the taunting turns to semi-frozen carnage when the Jericho defenders bombard the Israelites with slushy drinks.
The end of the day finds Joshua facing the threat of mutiny from the slushy-soaked Israelites, with some ready to fire up the Wallminator and others ready to run back to Egypt. At this point, Junior intervenes and convinces them to continue with the plan God laid out. He explains that God's way doesn't always make sense, but provides examples of how it always works out in the end.
Inspired by Junior's example, the Israelites agree to stick with the plan and, in spite of renewed and constant counter-attacks, march around the city for seven days as specified. On the seventh day they blow their horns and scream: at first nothing happens, but then cracks appear and the walls crashes down, just as God said it would. Joshua claims the land for his people, the defenders run away in panic, and the Israelites are finally allowed into the Promised Land.
Bob and Junior wrap up on the closing countertop, reiterating the lesson in the film in that though God's way may not always make sense, His way of doing things is always the best way. As Bob and Junior leave, Larry arrives in his pajamas to start to show but learns too late that it's already over.",1343347200,,4516,4.813384813384813

Is it OK to make such a serious and bloody event into something this light-hearted?  I mean after the walls fall, there is nobody in the town and the Isrealites just walk through it.  In real life there was a violent and bloody raid!  Everybody behind the wall was slaughtered!  This came about because of following God's intructions?!  Were the people (including children) living there not part of the creation that God supposedly loves?  Obviously it would be innappropriate to show the truth to children, but then why bother showing a watered-down version that supposedly teaches morals?  Somehow something seems very wrong with this.

While they didn't grasp all of the concepts, which are clearly meant for older kids, they absolutely loved the animation, the sight-gags, and especially the silly songs. I still have that ""Going the Promised Land"" song stuck in my head four days later. My wife and I appreciated the religious context of the show as well, which sparked a discussion about obedience with our 4 and 3 year olds when the DVD was over.

And thank goodness, this isn't one of those idiotic productions that assumes that kids are little dimwits who need to have quick-cuts to hold their attention. The silly songs are not the typical sappy nonsensical fare that dominates much of children's television these days. They are all very clever--in the best tradition of classic Muppets songs--and any adult with a sense of humor will be able to appreciate them without feeling IQ points melt away.

There is no way that these films are just for kids. There are so many little things that children would never pick up on. Believe me, these films are a must for your collection. No only will they have you rolling, but they teach amazing values as well.

I love the way that Josh stands up to the ""peas"" on the walls of Jericho, and takes the taunting and teasing from them, and from the members of his group.

He asks for it above all others.  I am truly shocked as he used to ask for full-feature Disney movies.  Now, he begs for VeggieTales.  Some of the humor makes me laugh out loud, too.  When the squash (?) looks up at the french peas and says, ""We're not crazy, you know.  Our God told us to do it,"" I just fall out!

This is
the one Veggie that I think went over the top with its Christian
fundamentalism.  The theme and lesson of this video is really ""We

ok.""
