8219021,5,B000VJ3DUY,"""The King Of Kensington"" is one of the very best television shows ever aired by any broadcast network in any country! Yes, it is that good. Often described as Canada's version of ""All In The Family,"" ""The King Of Kensington"" is an original show not at all connected to any other series, but like ""All In The Family,"" and other Norman Lear shows, it takes the politics, economic, and social times of the 1970's, and plays them for laughs. ""The King Of Kensington"" can also be poignant at times. Al Waxman, known to many Americans for his role in ""Cagney & Lacey,"" plays Larry King, owner of a variety store (five-and-dime or dollar store) in a section of Toronto known as Kensington. King lives with his wife and mother in a small two-story house, and while he is far from wealthy, he is rich in friends and acquaintances. It seems that everybody in the Kensington neighborhood comes to him with their problems. Although King's mother would prefer he worry only about his own family, King, often with his wife's help, finds a way to better someone else's situation, sometimes even to his own detriment. Yet, it all seems to work out in the end. This series was rarely shown in America, which is a real shame, but I saw some episodes in Los Angeles when I was a boy, and they have stuck with me for decades. This CD set only contains the first season, and while I am thrilled beyond words to be able to see these episodes again, I really, really, really hope that some company will release the rest of the series. ""The King Of Kensington"" is notable for giving young actors breaks, people like Mike Myers (""SNL,"" ""Austin Powers,"" ""Wayne's World""), Dave Thomas (""Bob & Doug McKenzie""), other actors from ""SCTV,"" and Saul Rubinek, who is now considered a top character actor in the United States. ""The King Of Kensington"" may contain some references of 1970's politicians that perhaps only Canadians will know, but the humor in this series is truly timeless.",1466553600,,1954,4.6502890173410405
8219022,4,B000VJ3DUY,"I remember this show from childhood. It definitely belongs to another, more innocent era.  It's a thoroughly Canadian show with gentle humour, down-home characters and many cultural references of the day.  (I had forgotten all about John Turner until Larry King mentioned him.)",1427155200,,277,5.4186046511627906
8219023,4,B000VJ3DUY,"I was a teenager when The King of Kensington was first on the air. I was also living in Toronto for part of the time that the show aired. It was a huge Canadian hit that even managed to break through to the US TV market, which is rare for a Canadian show of any kind.

Al Waxman was such a wonderful actor. He IS Larry King, shop keeper and friend to the whole neighbourhood. His mother in the show: Helene Winston was the perfect balance of sarcasm and skepticism to Larry's good deeds and adventures. Fiona Reid  was funny and sweet as Larry's wife.

It's fun to watch these again now as an adult. The 70's humor and references remind the viewer of the times, the morals, the jargon, the clothes... of a time that now seems so long ago.

Maybe not as funny as the first time around but still funny and worthwhile after all these years. I don't know what kids watching this now would think of this series but anyone who grew up or was an adult in the 70's would probably have some fond memories brought to mind again, watching this DVD.",1390953600,,1037,4.248730964467005
