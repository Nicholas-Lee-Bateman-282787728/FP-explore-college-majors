8330174,4,B001OBBRZQ,"OK pair of late 50's-early 60's beatnik type melo/crime dramas.  The Beatniks is about a new exciting singer who can't seem to shed his friends, a scraggly bunch of thieving, murderous losers.  The Bloody Brood is about a young man trying to find out who murdered his kid brother.  He has to delve in the world of pointless, aimless beatniks.  Has an early performance by Peter Falk as the head of the beatnik crowd.  DVD has some extras with rambling input by Johnny Legend.  The picture quality of the two films is pretty OK, about as good as they will ever probably get.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1448755200,2,609,4.532110091743119
