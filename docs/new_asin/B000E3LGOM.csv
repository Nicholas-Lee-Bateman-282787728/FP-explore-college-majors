8105191,4,B000E3LGOM,"probably my second least favorite season, but i love 'em all.  if you're a fan of mma/ufc/tuf, you will love it.  the challenges are completely pointless & i don't like the format (they've since corrected it so that all fighters must fight in round 1, etc), but it's great.  the one challenge w/joe-daddy & whitehead is amazing.  rashad's fights are very dull.",1202169600,,360,4.758064516129032
