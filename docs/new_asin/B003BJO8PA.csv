8442257,1,B003BJO8PA,"I watched as much of this collection as I could which was less than an hour. With the heavy British accent, and the age of the movies it was very difficult to understand most of the dialogue. And most of what I scanned wasn't very funny, even with Bella Lugosi whom I admired very much. I would not recommend these movies! and yet  it depends on the individuals personal taste in comedy.",1405382400,,387,4.375
