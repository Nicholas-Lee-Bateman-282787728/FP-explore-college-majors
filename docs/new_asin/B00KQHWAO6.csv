8660805,1,B00KQHWAO6,"Worst Hollander staging ever. Someone was on some bad drugs when they made this one. I was offended in the first Act by the smirking of the performers, as if they knew how awful it was. Or was that intentional? How would one actually know? The second and third acts weren't as bad, but that's only relative. OMG I can't unsee what I have seen. It's that awful.",1415404800,8,360,4.3088235294117645
8660806,5,B00KQHWAO6,"This is a great performance and production from 2012 Bayreuth Festival. The singers, the chorus, the orchestra and the conductor are excellent. The interpretation and production is one of the best I've seen in Wagner productions. Wagner used to tell his children: ""Always create new things, children"". Unfortunately, his conservative wife, Cosima, directed the Bayreuth Festival after Wagner's death in 1883 until her own death in the 1930's like a museum. All productions were exactly the same as was during Wagner's life. Fortunately, Wagner's grandsons, especially Wieland began new productions after the end of the second world war. In recent years, Bayreuth Festival has become the forerunner of new interpretations. Unfortunately, our own Metropolitan Opera has become more and more conservative in its Wagner productions.

This does not mean all new interpretations are good. New interpretations are good as long they stay true to Wagner's idea. A few years ago, Wagner's great granddaughter, Katherina directed a production of the Meistersinger of Nurnberg that was way out of line and everything Wagner stood for in his philosophy.

Jan Philipp Golger's interpretation is wonderful and right on the target from Wagner's philosophy point of view: renunciation of greed and power in favor of true compassionate love. In this production, the time is 1950's in a capitalist society where everyone is after collecting more money. Senta's father is a factory owner that makes electric fans. He is ready to sell his daughter to the highest bidder. The Flying Dutchman come from the future (in the original story he is coming from the past) when the same capitalist society has reached its highest level where prople have become money making robots without any feelings for love. Only Flying Dutchman is aware of his lost identity and his curse. His curse is the same as Alberich's curse in Wagner's later opera, the Ring of the Nibelung. Alberich curses love in favor of the gold. The Dutchman when reaches the point of his curse in his monolog at the beginning of the opera, burns a dollar bill to show the reason of his curse. When he and Senta fall in love in the second act they both burn money on a pile of fire, again a reference to the Ring. The greatest idea comes at the end of the opera when Senta rescues the Dutchman from his curse through her compassionate love but we see others on the stage now making table lamps (instead of fans) with the statues of Senta and Dutchman hugging each other to show that the capitalist society is moving forward to its grim future. It has not learned its lesson from the Dutchman's fate.",1407283200,11,2636,4.948081264108352
8660807,5,B00KQHWAO6,"You never know quite what to expect from a new Bayreuth production other than the certainty that it won't be a ""traditional"" staging of a Wagner opera. Jan Philipp Gloger's concept for the 2012 production of Der Fliegende Hollnder for example, is initially difficult to figure out, but there are a few things that stand in its favour that suggest that it at least holds true to the spirit and intention of the work. One is its adherence to the dramatic and mythological strengths of the work, the other is the quality of the performance itself, conducted by Christian Thielemann and sung well by a strong cast.

It's not immediately obvious what the setting or the intention is here from the first act, and there's not much that appears consistent in the tone or the concept in the acts that follow either. Act I seems to suggest a futuristic setting, dark walls of a motherboard lighting-up with the flashes of the storm, one that seems to derive directly from the ominous and unnoticed approach of the cyborg Dutchman's phantom ship. Act II doesn't enlighten matters any, the female chorus not a group of wives-a-weaving but workers in a factory packing fans into boxes. Among this group of sweetly singing industrious ladies, Senta comes across as a bit of an odd-ball - dark, gloomy and not a little deranged, crafting an abstract sculpture of the mythical Dutchman out of spare bits of wood, black tar and packing.

Things do start to fall into place in Act III (although it might help if you refer to the director's notes on the production in the accompanying booklet). Broadly speaking it's not that far removed from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martin-Kusej-s-interpretation-for-De-Nederlandse/dp/B004Q2TWKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martin Kusej's interpretation for De Nederlandse</a>&nbsp;in terms of how  the subject of Der Fliegende Hollnder is viewed as a question of love versus commerce. According to Jan Philipp Gloger, the Dutchman's curse is to be ever in search of new markets and increasing his profits. Weary of the pace of modern life and cold practicality of business, he needs to find some peace and get back in touch with real human feelings. This is a credible reading of the work, but it also takes into consideration Wagner's belief in the romantic and ennobling power of myth, converting Senta into a makeshift angel, her actions inspiring her co-workers to recognise her human sacrifice in a commemorative object d'art. That sounds belittling of Wagner's mythology, but it actually brings it back to human terms without losing any of the grandeur of the work. That's emphatically all there in the music.

Christian Thielemann's conducting of the Bayreuth orchestra might perhaps be a little unadventurous, but it's perfectly attuned to the dramatic performance and the singing. Unshowy, it's sensitive to the intricacies of the score, muscular where required, light and lyrical in other places with a true romantic sweep and dramatic drive. It's wonderful to hear, but even more impressive in how it connects with all the points of the dramatic staging. The singing here is very strong in all the roles. Ricarda Merbeth in particular is outstanding as Senta. Merbeth not only meets all the technical requirements, she delivers it with ringing lyricism that captures the magical as well as the all too human nature of her character. She's at her best in the critical Act II scene with the Dutchman which has to make this unlikely couple seem credible and she and Samuel Youn do indeed 'click' and work together wonderfully.  You can't fault the casting in the other roles here either and the choral work is outstanding.

On Blu-ray, the 2013 Bayreuther Festspiele production of Der Fliegende Hollnder looks and sounds tremendous. Extras consist of short interviews, the most notable an entertaining interview with Christian Thielemann being amiably(?) spiky and contrary, clearly knowing his own mind with respects to Wagner and this work. The disc is region-free, subtitles are in English, French, German and Korean.",1403740800,9,4094,5.214285714285714
