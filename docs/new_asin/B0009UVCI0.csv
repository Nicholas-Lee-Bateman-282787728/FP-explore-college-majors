2323139,5,B0009UVCI0,"I understand that this video cannot be up there in the pantheon of ""genius creations of all time"" for most people, simply because it isn't as accessible as some of Cunningham's other work.

Aside from this, it is just short of perfection.  The visuals are completely well suited and perfectly matched to the music.  If you aren't an Aphex fan, you will have a problem with this, because the imagery is inextricably linked to the music.  Nevertheless, with this caveat, you cannot help but be mesmerized by the grotesqueries of the Johnny character, and of course the eerie likeness to John Merrick, evidenced by the oversized cranium.

I thought it was hilarious that the Italian printing company hired to make the sleeve for the DVD refused to finish the job because the workers on the printing floor didn't even want to look at the DVD artwork.  If you think this is all a bit cheeky, you're right; pushing the envelope of culture by using uncomfortable images sounds like what an artist does.  Or you can look at it as sensationalism- it's up to you.  I choose the former, because Cunningham isn't afraid of being darkly humorous...even if it is a little sick.",1120608000,3,1163,4.7227722772277225
2323140,2,B0009UVCI0,"After seeing the promos and reading the announcements for this film, I was looking forward to seeing an actual short film by Cunningham. However, ""Rubber Johnny"" turns out to be just another Aphex Twin music video, and in my opinion, the least successful of the ones Cunningham has made. I own both of his other Aphex videos, but I will not be purchasing this one. Try before you buy.",1120348800,6,384,4.579710144927536
2323141,5,B0009UVCI0,"I just got this book/dvd direct from England today and despite the migraine I was suffering from, managed to blind-side the pain with instrumental precision. The choice of music from Aphex Twin not only did the video justice but put an axe in the proverbial hi-jinx established within the mind set of absolute genius. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1120262400,,339,5.071428571428571
2323142,5,B0009UVCI0,"this is the coolest thing chris cunningham has ever done, next to windowlicker.

We'll see how time treats this.  Right now though, it's amazing.  It is Chris Cunningham's first work as an auteur.  He directed, edited, animated, and starred in the title role.  Chris Cunningham is the beethoven of filmmaking.  Whether crazy or not, he is a national treasure.  Just for the experience, I highly recommend this to anybody who labels themself a radical.",1120176000,,451,5.013513513513513
2323143,5,B0009UVCI0,"Originally conceived as a promo for Aphex Twin's DrukQs album almost 4 years ago, this piece by up and coming director Chris Cunningham has been a labor of love for him, and has been filmed and edited piece by piece when time permits to be fully unleashed on the public when ready.  The story of course is about Johnny, a dangerous shapeshifting mutant kept in the cellar by his parents, where his mind alone keeps him and his dog entertained, along with the occasional ingestion of powdered cleaning products.  The ingenuity with which Cunningham (who stars as Johnny by the way) uses nightvision to give this short film an unequalled creepiness is unsettling to say the least.  All I can say is he is an acquired taste.  Having been initially exposed to his visceral vision with 1997's 'Come to Daddy' video, I can say he is among my favorite directors working today, and I cannot wait for his eventual feature length film to hit theaters.  It will be like a punch in the stomache to the public.  Take heed.",1119312000,5,1009,4.608938547486034
2323144,5,B0009UVCI0,"Lasting only 6mins in length, Rubber Johnny opens with the narrative of ""little Johnny"" being calmed by his docter who gives him a shot to calm his nerves. From there all hell breaks loose as rubber johnny transforms into a shape shifting, wheelchair break-dancing, splatter face creature; all done to Aphex Twins [Drunks] music. The video will drain you and may induce nausia, but the art on display here is amazing.",1118016000,,417,4.887323943661972
2323185,1,B0009UVCI0,"This too much reminds me of a Residents short film, Jelly Jack. [...] You can totally tell where Chirs Cunningham gets some of his inspiration. I used to like some of his videos, such as Come To Daddy and All is Full of Love, but as I have grown and seen more superior work from decent directors, his work just seems disgusting, not even cool in anyway. You can tell he has a very very disturbed mind. His work goes from strange to just plain sick. Not even insterestingly sick, just completly psychotic, and even stupid. If you want weird, gross, but original art film splendor, check out the Resident's Iky Flicks.",1139788800,5,616,4.508928571428571
2323186,5,B0009UVCI0,"Definitely worth the four years (on and off) it took to create this - highly recommended for Cunningham and Aphex Twin fans. Too bad this ""video"" didn't make it on to MTV late night - that's where I first saw ""Come to Daddy""; nothing llike watching that video for the first time alone at one in the morning - I was a fan for life.

Be warned, I'v ordered this twice, once for me and once for a friend. It does not ship in 24 hours (for me at least). Took 10 days for my order to ship, and It's been 23 days, many delay notices and counting to get it shipped to my friends house. They must keep it in a sealed vault in Siberia...",1135209600,,628,3.984126984126984
2323187,5,B0009UVCI0,"I stole that line from a fellow Amazonian who was referring to the cover of the Come To Daddy EP (Aphex Twin), but I believe it works equally well in describing the contents of this DVD. To see why it took so long for Chris to make Rubber Johnny, read this interview: (...)",1135123200,,273,4.169811320754717
2323188,5,B0009UVCI0,"This is the greatest leap in music and film since the last video Chris made that moved minds, Come to Daddy.  To the doubters - It takes courage, imagination, and spirit to create a work like Rubber Johnny, and I think that you understand none of this, and are probably untalented wan bee artists/film buffs {losers}.

This film was made using old and new technology: shot on mini-DV, 10 Inferno Artists from Golden Square productions, Chris as Rubber Johnny, and a small team of post assistants to make this.  Considering the garbage that is hailed as great art, Chris has once again reminded us that the mind has no limits and your only barrier is yourself.",1132444800,,659,4.663793103448276
2323189,4,B0009UVCI0,"Although it's a short (very short) film, it's probably the most innovative and engaging 6 minutes of film I've seen in a while. While most people will be turned off by the accompanying booklet, the film is uncomfortably irresistible. It's only downside is that it's too short.",1130112000,5,276,4.8936170212765955
2323190,5,B0009UVCI0,"At first I thought I was watching some kind of actual footage of aliens at Area 51 or something (ha-ha-ha) and then the titles came up.  By that point I was pretty creeped out, but when the ""action"" starts this movie turns into something really fun.  When it is finished I think you realize that it was a rewarding experience to watch.  It is some sort of display of how anyone can have fun, no matter who they are, where they are, or under what circumstances.  It's actually pretty mind boggling to watch this and try and figure out how it was filmed.  It's awsome!!",1130025600,8,567,4.3619047619047615
2323191,5,B0009UVCI0,"THIS VIDEO MUST BE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A SMALL INSECT THAT CRAWLED INTO APHEX TWIN'S HEAD! I THINK THIS IS THE DARKEST, MOST CREEPY MUSIC VIDEO EVER MADE! LOVE IT! BE WARNED : ONCE YOU HAVE VIEWED THIS VIDEO, THE IMAGES YOU SEE WILL LIQUIFY YOUR BRAIN UNTIL ALL THAT'S LEFT IS FEAR!",1130025600,,284,4.089285714285714
2323192,4,B0009UVCI0,"This is a pretty brilliant video, albeit terribly messed up.  Conceptually it is rather dark as well as literally being dark (as it was all shot on a infra-red camera).  If you like Chris Cunningham, you'll probably like this video, though it is one of his stranger ones.",1129334400,4,271,4.625
2323193,2,B0009UVCI0,"i tend to be a fan of cunningham's work - however, this is just sub par. four years wait - and for what is essentially another aphex music video. it's not a short film at all - not even an experimental short film. it's a music video. be forewarned - the cover image isn't exactly representational of the footage either - which is for the most part, really uninteresting (lots of quick edits in time to aphex twin) with the exception of the absolute begining, and end (the bits in color). i suppose they couldn't package a single music video and sell it for 10 bucks - no, they have to call it a short film. i guess what's really upsetting, is that the intial start of the video sets you up to expect some kind of actual short film - and a really good one at that. i had heard people speaking of lynch's shorts - and that's really not even close to what follows. even at his most abstract, lynch never decends into what is more or less an excercise in editing to sound. and now i've heard that cunninham has ditched neuromancer? c'mon - he also gave up on a scanner darkly. four years for a little under 6 minutes of film. that's apprx 1.3 minutes of film a year. you want to see brilliance in under 60 seconds? watch lynch's short on the lumiere compilation - done in one shot. hoisted by yr own pitard, cunningham...!",1127692800,11,1318,4.276
2323224,2,B0009UVCI0,"This character was unnerving to say the least when first introduced three years ago.  This highly anticipated elaboration of Rubber Johnny, created by Chris Cunningham, is at first creepy but when the music starts it's rhythmic patterns, Rubber Johnny goes into silly ""rave moves"" or ""dance fidgeting"" in a wheel chair.  This was stupid and broke the mood completely of this potentially horrific creature.  There's a point where Rubber Johnny turns his oversized hydrosephalic head quickly in respose to someone talking at a door openning which wreaks of a light foam prosthetic head worn by an actor.  The illusion was immediately dismissed with this careless editing decision.  Someone with such a large oversized head would barely be able to move!  Aside from this, the fast paced editing took away from the mood as well.  It could have been something extraordinary.  Something with this kind of creep factor could have really gone somewhere.  The pacing should have slowed down-- WAY DOWN with rich, thick, creepy horror goodness!",1127692800,3,1034,5.180722891566265
2323225,5,B0009UVCI0,"I am a student at the Art institute of dallas, and I am about to graduate. One of the things that I analyze most is video and film. ""Rubber Johnny"" is so technical. Everytime I watch it I find something new. If you are an editor you would understand how insane the editing is on this. It must have taken him forever. Most people would find this video a little bit different, and might not like this. It is different, but if you think about the story, it is pure genious. I love it, and if you like strange videos, or crazy music videos, then check this one out.",1127433600,2,561,4.155963302752293
2323226,3,B0009UVCI0,"The Video is awesome, it's creepy the first time you see it, and then it just starts to get damn cool and damn funny at the same time.  I use a wheelchair in real life, so whether this is lame or not... I LOVED THE WHEELCHAIR BREAK DANCING... it looked awesome... I think I was a little bit overtired when I decided to buy it though, because all it really is, is a book with a bunch of twisted up pictures of rubber johnny, and a cd of the 6 minute video that u can see on other places on the internet.. I was HOPIN that the book would have more of an in depth explanation of the video, to see why rubber johnny was created.. seriously... why.. I need analysis in my life!! But Now that I bought it, I still don't regret the purchase, cust it's still a crazy and insane music video, and great to add on to the rest of my collection of creepy and f**ked up things.",1124409600,5,863,4.017441860465116
2323227,5,B0009UVCI0,"Well besides the absolute beautifully grotesque artwork that is perfectly binded into a small booklet, the actual video by the renowned genius director, Chris Cunningham is absolutely entertaining yet disturbing. Don't be a naive person and just thing ""ew gross wtf is that"" If you're a fan of Cunningham's work then no doubt you wouldn't think twice about buying this dvd. Its well worth the money and an added collection to his work. Great buy!",1123891200,,446,4.96
2323228,2,B0009UVCI0,"I blinked and it was over. No really, it barely lasts five minutes.  It's a segue.  It leads you on with its elaborate packaging (lots of pictures that make you question your choice to watch it while eating) and has a disturbing opening which leads you on to the fact that there might be a story here...  nope.  It's not worth the $10 I paid.

Those five minutes were good. Wait for it to show up on some sort of compilation- then buy it.",1122422400,4,438,4.166666666666667
2323229,3,B0009UVCI0,"quite brilliant, but much to short to justify the price!  its over in the blink of an eye it seems.  not even a full song from aphex.  i was hoping for new music, but no, its a song from drukqs.  recommended, but only if you have the money burning a hole in your pocket.",1122076800,2,270,3.9444444444444446
2323230,4,B0009UVCI0,"If you like Chris Cunningham's other stuff, then you will like this as well. It's as good as anything else he's ever made. But $11+ for a 6 minute(not even) dvd? That's not really very fair. The Chris Cunningham director dvd was like $13 for 8 music videos plus some commercial spots plus a full book. The Warp dvd is like $18 for a lot more music videos. Anyways, you get the point. It's very good, but I would think that this would be released on some sort of comp at some point. It's good, but I suggest getting it used or waiting for it to be released cheaper somehow.

5 stars for the actual video, 2 or 3 for the value.",1121990400,3,625,4.122950819672131
2323231,3,B0009UVCI0,"According to Warp's site, this thing was 4 years in the making.  It's as brilliant as anything else Cunningham has done, even if it does feel like a Taco Bell commercial directed by David Lynch (not a bad thing mind you).  I was really hoping for more.  It's just another music video.  I guess I was hoping for at least a 30-minute short film.  Something along the lines of Lynch's 'The Grandmother'.  Cunningham has been over this format before (6-7 minute shorts).  It's time to graduate to something bigger Chris.  I know you can do it.  Don't be afraid.  Give us a really messed up 40 minute version of Rubbber Johnny.  Not as much dancing this time though.  I'm glad I didn't pay $20 for this.  But I'm sure I will watch it again and again.  And again.  It is brilliant, don't get me wrong.  I just was hoping for more.  I hope he makes a feature someday (even if it takes 40 or 50 years).",1121644800,2,894,4.289156626506024
2323232,5,B0009UVCI0,"A nightmarish trip.  You will be dragged into watching this video till the end.

The intense visuals mirror the intensly frenetic pace of the music.  In the end this experience will leave you quite exhausted and breathless.

This short film is definetly not for the faint of heart. If you have the constitution to take it I would highly recommend Rubber Johnny.",1121644800,3,361,4.774193548387097
2323233,5,B0009UVCI0,"While I have not seen this, I have seen enough of Cunninghams work to know what to expect. This should be well delivered with Chris's touch of dark playful images.

8067081,4,B0009UVCI0,I bought this because I heard it was super creepy. Well it is! The first time I tried watching this was at night and I was alone. I wan't able to finish it. I eventually watched it through during the day. Still creepy as hell. I'd recommend this for sure.,1428364800,,255,4.12
8067082,5,B0009UVCI0,"Rubber Johnny is a crazy short film. I loved the music and it's very trippy. Creepy and disturbing at times! Very well shot and edited too. Rubber Johnny reminds me of Big Brain from The Hills Have Eyes remake. Pretty sure they got the idea from Rubber Johnny, they look very similar. The art booklet that comes with it is pretty cool too. Worth it I'd say, but don't pay too much. No extras on the dvd, just the short film.",1406246400,,424,4.246913580246914

8067086,5,B0009UVCI0,"I play this whenever someone comes over who hasn't seen it before, and their typical reaction is ""What the h*ll IS THIS?!"".  Don't let them read the book while watching the DVD, else they get too distracted and can't decide which thing to look at.  Nearly everyone who sees it asks where they can get a copy of it; I have bought multiple copies as gifts for other people.  Granted, most of my friends are the type that would be into it to begin with, so, it's an expected reaction.

Yeah, it's thirteen bucks for one video that last all of six minutes, but the companion book makes it worth it, not to mention the really bugged out video itself.  I first saw it on the internet, and it apparently became so popular that ""they"" yanked it from almost everywhere, so I had to buy it; happy I did.",1168387200,,793,4.295302013422819

Basically, here is the whole movie in a nut-shell.  A deformed kid in a wheelchair...bouncing laser beams off of his hands, to some Aphex Twin background music and a few images of what looks like raw chicken pushed up against a pane of glass.

This would probably be a cool DVD....if they would've included some special features.  Commentary,easter eggs,trailers, something....anything.  Instead, it has one option on the menu screen...""play Rubber Johnny.""

Whoever marketed or put out this DVD, must be really hurting for money.  They could have easily fit this onto the ""Work of Director Chris Cunningham"" DVD, at no additional cost or packaging.
