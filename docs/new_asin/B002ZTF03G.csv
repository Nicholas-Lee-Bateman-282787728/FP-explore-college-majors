8385249,5,B002ZTF03G,"If you are reading this review, most likely your already know that Christopher Marlowe's ""DOCTOR FAUSTUS"" (1588) is the first great tragedy in Elizabethan. Yet it is seldom performed -- and with good reason.
First of all, scholars are still debating just how much of text we have as actually written by Marlowe. Secondly, the play has an enormous cast of characters. As if these casting difficulties are enough, the two principal characters, Faustus and Mephistophelis have lengthy and demanding speeches and are on-stage for much of the action; so these parts call for actors with both physical stamina and vocal dexterity and power. Third, there is a big gap between the descriptions of the protagonist's magical power and the (rather unimpressive) examples of these powers presented on stage. This poses a real test of the imaginative and technical resources of the director and production crew. And finally, the frequent comic interludes were pretty much rough clowning to start with and they haven't gotten any funnier with the passage of four hundred years.
Until now, the only readily available video was the alternately leaden and amateurish 1968 Burton/Taylor version. I had never heard of either Stage on Screen or Greenwich Theatre, London. But when I happened across a listing for this 2010 DVD of a stage performance in front of a live audience, I decided to take a chance on it.
And am I glad I did!
Not only are leads -- Garreth Kennerly as Faustus and Tim Treloar as Mephistopheles -- more than up to the demands of their parts, the rest of the cast performs their multiple parts at the same level of professional expertise. The sheer number of characters gives the action the feel of an epic adventure unforlding. This production relies on a combination of simple sets, colorful costumes, and dramatic blocking to keep the action moving briskly. The use of light, sound and choreography for the moments of ""magic"" is strking and inventive. All told, it gave me a taste of the ways in which this play might have stunned its first audiences.
As far as I can tell, this DVD is as close to faultless as the recording of a live event is likely to be. I was never confused as to where the characters were or what was going on. Aside from a single line, I could make the words of every speaker. The camerawork was usually fluid and the sound recording crisp.
So: if you are interested in seeing a top-flight professional production of this play, I strongly recommend this version.
P.S. - All of the Greenwich Theatre DVD productions are availabe either as a single DVD (the production itself) or as part of a 4 DVD ""Special Edition Teacher Pack"" (which costs about twice as much). I got the latter. I did not find the interviews with the cast and crew all that enlightening. However, I have not yet tried either the ""Mastershot DVD"" or the ""Interactive CD-ROM.""",1316044800,22,2871,4.778672032193159
