74152,4,0784011648,"Henry Fonda plays his age in this sentimental but well-done tear-jerker, set, not coincidentally, in the autumn/sunset/loonsong glow of Golden Pond's lake shore.  Though family tensions abound, it is the rascal wit and  toughness of Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda, doing what they do best in  the sunset of their own lives, that carry this movie.  There are some  winning moments with the young boy, and the music by Dave Grusin remains  winsome and evocative, if a bit overstated, but any scene with these two  giants takes your breath away.  Jane Fonda, who must have been plugging her  first aerobic workout tape with incongruous scenes of her in a bathing suit  stuck into the middle of the movie, seems amplified and tense, and  therefore unbelievable, and Dabney Coleman, who is a perfect comedian/foil  in practically every movie he has ever been in, seems out of place here.  Still, there is much to recommend in this movie, which, if you have not  seen, will undoubtedly move you with its simple but true through-line of  familial love in the face of mortality.",945734400,,1073,4.883333333333334

Henry plays a grumpy old man.  And there is good interaction between Henry Fonda and Doug McKeon who plays Jane's step son.  And slowly bonds with Henry,  And Katharine Hepburn as Henry's wife adds stability.  The movie won acadamy awards for picture, actor and actress.  Which I thought was just for sentimental reasons.

74164,3,0784011648,"Review of On Golden Pond
Hot Toasty Rag, September 28, 2017

On Golden Pond is famous for many reasons, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on some of the most memorable moments of semi-modern, semi-classic film history.

Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda play an old married couple who return to their lake cottage to celebrate Henrys 80th birthday. Hes a crotchety old man whos grumpy all the time and doesnt like getting older. Katharine supplies the warmth in the family, including their relationship with their daughter, Jane Fonda. Jane and Henry don't get along, mirroring their real-life relationship, and when she comes to the lake house to mend their old wounds, its an uphill battle.

Dabney Coleman costars as Janes fianc, and Doug McKeon plays Dabneys teenage son who bonds with Henry. Both Katharine and Henry received Oscars for their performance, as did Ernest Thompson for his adapted screenplay. Its hard to choose one famous moment from the film, since there are so many: Katharines go go go speech, Janes backflip, Henry and Janes hug, Janes tearful I want to be your friend line, and Henrys pronunciation of his wifes name. Its definitely worth watching, especially if you're a fan of anyone in the cast, or if you have issues with your father.",1506556800,,1280,4.889400921658986

74219,5,0784011648,"I have the DVD version.
5 Stars for the movie.
3 Stars for picture quality. Moderately grainy and fuzzy picture.  Not bad but I was a bit surprised.

In terms of how wonderful the movie is, there are numerous other reviews.  I'd like to give some information on the DVD and the extras.

-Interesting connections to Spencer Tracy (Katharine Hepburn's long time love interest in real life from early 40's to his death in 1967):
The first scene where Hepburn and Fonda arrive at the lake house, Henry Fonda is wearing a hat which Hepburn gave him which once belonged to Spencer Tracy when he was alive.  Also, Hepburn calls one of the two boys working at the gas pump (the one with unbuttoned shirt), ""Hello Sumner!""  Sumner is Spencer Tracy's character name in Hepburn/Tracy movie from 1957 movie ""Desk set"".

-Commentary by Mark Rydell:
Gives you good insight into the making of the movie, working with Hepburn and the Fondas.  Hepburn broke her arm because she served too hard while playing tennis.  She had surgery but still showed up to rehearsals for the movie. During the weeks the movie was being filmed at the lake, she woke up daily at 4am to swim in the lake. She did the same at her Fenwick home in Connecticut even during winter.  Rydell describes how perfect Henry Fonda was for all the scenes in the way he acted and approached each scene while Hepburn had lots of ideas for scenes but needed more direction in terms of how the director wanted her to act.

-Commentary by the play write Ernest Thompson:
He points out some changes/differences from his original script to the movie.  In particular Katharine Hepburn wrote and added, ""Listen to me, mister. You're my knight in shining armor. Don't you forget it. You're going to get back on that horse, and I'm going to be right behind you, holding on tight, and away we're gonna go, go, go!""  Also, the scene where Henry Fonda gets lost in the forest wasn't in the original script.  In the original script/play, he simply comes back to the house from getting lost and tells how he got lost and how awful it was to lose your memory.

This is simply a wonderful movie.  I put it right up there with ""The Shawshank redemption"" among other favorite movies of mine.",1477785600,10,2221,4.584810126582278

74235,2,0784011648,"Norman and Ethel Thayer are an elderly couple making their annual trip to their summer cottage. Once there, they bicker-quite a lot. Norman acts obnoxious, insulting, and out of it while Ether keeps calling him an ""old poop"". For being major actors, the two leads perform like a bad vaudeville team, and we nearly turned it off.

But the estranged daughter arrives as planned, along with her new boyfriend and his teenage son. After a short time, daughter and boyfriend have to go to Europe while they leave the son at the cottage. It is not too surprising how the rest of the movie goes.

Henry Fonda reportedly won his only Oscar for this movie, which is a shame because he gave far better performances in far better movies. Perhaps because he was about to die and they wanted to give him one before it was too late. There was certainly no other reason that anybody who had to do with this movie should earn any awards.",1473724800,,921,4.508982035928144

74266,5,0784011648,"Kristy Woodson Harvey's new book, Lies and Other Acts of Love, will forever be firmly instilled in my heart.  I am certain it is because there are many strong women in my family, the love I hold for my family and God, my Southern roots, and the experiences that resemble so many of those in all of our lives that spoke to my heart throughout this book.  Kristy, words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this book and admire your ability to bring words to life.

Set in Raleigh, North Carolina, this book shares the lives of three generations of a family that is not only close-knit and loving, but also strong and faithful.  The characters in the book greatly love their wives, husbands, sisters, parents, grandparents, and friends. You learn early on that the women are the backbone of this family, supporting each other with a closeness and loyalty that is heartwarming.

My favorite characters are granddaughter Annabel and grandmother Lovey, of course. When making your choice, I guess it depends on whether your favorite parts are the strength and dedication to marriage, the steamy relationships filled with love, the episodes of heartbreak, the strength of their faith, loyalty, the closeness and love of each other, or most likely a combination of the above.

As with Dear Carolina, Kristy has a way of bringing the senses to life like very few can. The reader feels as though they are right in the middle because it reminds them of much that has happened in their own lives, including the surroundings.

If the movie producers don't grab this up and make a movie, they are missing out.  The setting and the characters are perfect movie material. It is time for a beautiful, southern, heartwarming and real story at the box office.

You hit this one to the moon, Kristy! It was a pleasure to read.",1463875200,,1805,4.722929936305732

74360,4,0784011648,"Somewhat sentimental early 80s fare, with, like Driving Miss Daisy a very loyal following. How does it hold up? Technically, it looks very much of its time in terms of cinematography, lighting and even Dave Grusin's very eighties score. The central joy of Pond, of course is Hepburn and the Fondas, and they don't disappoint. Although it is somewhat ironic to watch this flim about the joys and fears of old age and realize Henry Fonda was near the end himself when he made it. At least, this was his last film role in a career that was nearly unparalleled in American cinema. The suprises here are the supporting roles: Dabney Coleman is excellent as Bill Sr. and the teenage Doug McKeon reminds one of Hailey Steinfield in the recent True Grit remake -- perhaps not at that age a great actor, but completely holds his own with the titanic trio Hepburn, Henry and Jane Fonda. And the unexpected joy here? Ernest Thompson's excellent screenplay, based on his wry stage play.

Also, explored is a struggling relationship between a father and daughter and an unlikely friendship between an old man and a 13 year old boy who find a common bond in the challenge of fishing for Great Trout of Golden Pond!!

74433,3,0784011648,"""On Golden Pond"" works through the same themes that occupied many big-time play adaptations between the 1950s and the 1980s. Like ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" (1958) and ""The Lion in Winter"" (1968) it is about inter- generational family dysfunction, and it seems to want to embarrass or shock the audience through a frankness of discourse. It is the kind of script that purports to peel away the supposedly-artificial niceties of middle-class life to get to the meat of matters, which in the minds of these kinds of playwrights always seems to mean sex and death. Tennessee Williams and James Goldman made that format dance, and watching the great Hollywood versions of their works is thrilling because of the way they constantly try to set new records for speed and intensity and brutal honesty. ""On Golden Pond"" imitates these classics but with a lower degree of commitment. It's slower and gentler, and it never seems to let a barb stand unaccompanied by a sappy line or a nostalgic musical cue. It's a movie that's easy to like, because it's a suger-coated pill. As Williams and Goldman knew, there's nothing challenging about a sugar-coated pill. To them, the purpose of writing characters who speak in a forthright way about difficult issues was to make us face our fears and anxieties, and their genius was to do this while also being entertaining. ""On Golden Pond"" wants to do these things, but it wants to go down easy. That impulse is not altogether a bad one; compare it with another play adaptation, 1966's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" which aims to scream the loudest and cut the deepest only to end up as thoroughly unlikable as its characters. Toward the beginning, ""On Golden Pond"" echoes ""Virginia Woolf"" as Henry Fonda's irascible ""old poop"" tries to discomfit a polite younger man with blunt sexual talk. By the middle of the movie, though, this riff on Edward Albee's hard-edged approach gives way to a much sweeter narrative about an unlikely friendship between Fonda's 80-year-old and a 13-year-old boy. It's nice, but it's predictable and safe and familiar and forgettable whereas its predecessors succeeded by being none of those things. Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda are believable, though, and Jane Fonda threatens to upstage both of them as their adult daughter whose eyes betray an inner mixture of depression and resentment and a certain flightiness born of self-doubt. If nothing else, what ""On Golden Pond"" shares in full measure with its more ambitious and significant forerunners is magnificent acting by a top-shelf cast.",1423180800,,2559,4.981308411214953

74519,4,0784011648,"I'm putting on my flak jacket because I'm actually not going to this movie 5 stars and it has nothing do to with video or sound quailty.

Don't get me wrong. It's a wonderful movie, touching and poignant, dealing with many topics from aging to forgiveness to reconciliation. It tugs at the heartstrings and has many humorous moments as well. The acting is basically top-notch. In fact, I think this is one of Henry Fonda's best acting jobs ever (my other personal favorite - The ""Ox-Bow Incident""). I love most Henry Fonda movies, but I often find him to be a bit stiff and preachy in his roles (think ""Failsafe"" and ""12 Angry Men""). Of course those were both movies with rather strong political messages, messages Fonda was obviously more than happy to convey. I like him better in movies where his character is ""flawed"" (such as this one), he's much more believable so his acting seems stronger. Katherine Hepburn is also, no doubt, at the top of her game in this film as well. I didn't think Jane Fonda did anything amazing but it was of course interesting to see her with her father in a role I'm sure hit close to home for both of them.

OK, so why only 4 stars? As good as the movie is, I found it to be a bit manipulative. Of course, in one sense, that's what movies are supposed to do. But ""You old poop"" is funny one or two times, after that, it gets old (no pun intended). It's almost as if the Director (Mark Rydell) knew he was on to a line that would be repeated by audiences for generations to come, so he overused it. Same with Katherine Hepburn's voice. I realize this is her natural speaking voice but once could almost envision her getting direction on the set ""More vibrato, Katherine!"". I felt she was playing a caricature of herself. Had these items been toned down just a tad, the film could have even been greater. And the soundtrack? Ehhh....people seem to rave about it, it did absolutely nothing for me.

Notwithstanding the small criticisms, a timeless film that deserves all it's praise.",1406246400,,2015,4.5

74534,5,0784011648,"How can this film be nearly 35 years old?  It is still emotionally moving and gorgeous to watch. This was Henry Fonda's last film role, for which he won his only Best Actor Oscar. He died the next year and was too ill to attend the awards ceremony, and his daughter, Jane Fonda who played his daughter in the film, accepted on his behalf.

The film pairs two acting legends, Fonda and Katherine Hepburn in roles in which they essentially play themselves. Fonda, as Norman Thayer, a retired 80-year old professor, arrives at their cabin at the lake and is tremulous and grumpy, suffering from angina and slight dementia and is obsessed with dying. He feels he has nothing left to look forward to. Hepburn, as Ethel Thayer, is a decade younger than Norman, still spry and excited about being at their beautiful lake and listening to the haunting loons. She tries to cheer him up and tolerates his moodiness. Their daughter, Chelsea (Jane Fonda) arrives with her new beau (Dabney Coleman) and future stepson, 13 year old Billy Ray, played by Doug McKeon. The only false note in the film is when Chelsea asks if they can leave the 13 year old at the lake for a month while she and the fiance go off to visit Europe. Highly improbable, especially since Norman and Chelsea already have a strained and distant relationship.

Nevertheless, Norman and Billy Ray start to bond, mainly over fishing expeditions, when plenty of profanity is flung about, while they search for the elusive giant trout of the lake - old Walter. Norman has a spring in his step, and the boy learns that hanging out with the old folks can be entertaining. Chelsea returns near the end of the summer, now a married woman, and at her mother's urging decides to hold out the olive branch and try to build a new friendly relationship with her dad. It is one of the most emotional and memorable moments in film history, apparently mimicking the real life relationship of the father and daughter.

The scenery in and around the lake is just stunning, and the film is laced with beautiful and artistic scene-setting shots of flowers, sunsets, birds, water and reflections. The DVD specials include an extensive interview with the cinematographer in which he describes his approach to using natural light, both indoors and outdoors. The quality and beauty of this film, as well as the stellar acting, give it a lasting and timeless appeal.",1402617600,,2398,4.729665071770335

74560,4,0784011648,"With over 300 reviews on this classic I'll not address the plot of this wonderful film...which is one of my treasured favorites.  I do wish to offer thoughts about the remastering of the latest special edition...which includes both the soundtrack and a reformatted picture to a 16:9  flat screen-friendly ratio, plus the addition of a special feature on Kate Hepburn, who at 96 had died in 2007 = before the special version was released.  This new feature is a good bookend to the other feature about the making of On Golden Pond...which appeared on the original CD and is one of the better examples of the ""making of"" genre.
  But more to the point..with respect to  picture quality..I saw no dramatic improvements to the earlier CD version of this movie...but that aid  I still found the picture to be quite satisfactory..with natural and saturated colors and shadow detail not to detract from the unfolding plot.  Yes..I wish this movie would receive a blu ray remastering one of these days,  which no doubt would improve upon what we have now,  but I'd still give the picture  3 to 3 1/2 out of 5 in its current DVD version.

For me the big improvement is in the sound..which has been remastered from its original stereo into a very believable 5.1 surround sound aural picture.  This is immediately apparent from the opening credits...even without dialogue, which is firmly grounded in the new middle and front left-right channels  with just enough of a boost from the surround speakers to allow the sound  and especially the marvelous soundtrack to fill the room in a most pleasant way.

Given that this latest special edition  of a classic can be had from Amazon for less than $5.00 delivered (if one has ""Prime"") the improvements in sound alone plus the extra Katherine Hepburn special feature  make this a fine deal...until whenever the bluray version should appear.",1396828800,,1874,4.839622641509434

74653,5,0784011648,"In the early '70s, Henry Fonda and daughter Jane hoped to appear together with Jane's brother Peter in a Revolutionary War drama, but that project never came to fruition. ON GOLDEN POND was in hindsight a final chance for two members of this talented family to make a picture together, and what a film it is!

Kate Hepburn, who clearly manifests the Essential Tremor (not Parkinson's) that had afflicted her for many years, won a fourth and final Best Actress Oscar here, and Henry matched her with his first (and only) Best Actor statuette. (NOTE: neither were at the Awards ceremonies that night.)

Jane was nominated as well, for a limited supporting role that she is quite good in. Her crucial final scenes with dad get emotional and the viewer feels these two aren't acting as much as truly relating to each other. It's a rare privilege to share such an intimate moment with two superlative performers who just happen to be blood relations.

Hepburn, like the younger Fonda, is somewhat peripheral to a male-bonding story of her ""old poop"" and the 12-year-old son of Jane's fianc (Dabney Coleman). The role of Billy Ray Jr. surely is Doug McKeon's best work. Billy and the naturally aloof Norman Thayer (Fonda) spar at first but find common ground (both are 'junior's and they favor a certain 8 letter word for cow manure). Ultimately these two become the closest of friends in a quest to land the lake's legendary ""whopper"" fish. There's genuine drama here when a boating accident occurs and both are violently thrown from their wrecked craft.

ON GOLDEN POND is in the end about resolution and acceptance: of the elderly for an uncertain future, of a long-married couple who love each other more than they openly express, of a father and daughter who've been estranged for far too long, and of an alienated boy who comes to grips with a new ""mom"" in his life (one that at age 43 is a knockout in a bikini!), and who finds in that woman's father a kind and accepting friend.

74688,5,0784011648,"Not a mark of age anywhere here.  Just a surpassingly beautiful film, incomparable in its subject-matter category.

Don't miss the ""Loving Against Time"" documentary if you get a copy of this edition.  It brought tears to my eyes.  One notable aspect of it is how the playwright/screenwriter (Ernest Thompson) says that when he originally conceived the story, he saw it as a kind of elegy for a way of life that was passing out of existence -- not only in New England, where he was raised, but generally -- and that it was supposed to be more about that than specifically about the Thayers, but that the story just sort of evolved into something more specifically about _these_ people (which, of course, is really the only way to make a more general point anyway).

Ironically, if you know the story arc, there's actually more a sense of continuing hope for this kind of decency and gentleness to survive on into the future, despite Thompson's original intent to portray some kind of permanent loss.

In fact, as it turns out, after having this experience Thompson himself moved back from L.A. to New Hampshire, just down the road from the filming site, and decided that's where he wanted his family to be, thus negating his own thesis at least partially (since he then became an active and purposeful part of making that way of life survive).  Let's hope it never dies.",1370304000,,1369,4.702928870292887
74689,5,0784011648,"Watching this movie makes me homesick for long summers at a Lake Cottage I have never had the opportunity to spend. Few but the very rich, unless the cottage has been in the family for generations, can afford such a luxury today. My parents spent a weeklong honeymoon at a cabin on Molega Lake, Queens County, Nova Scotia seventy years ago. Probably the only such vacation they ever took. Today those not wealthy enough to afford a million dollar cottage property live in trailers in crowded RV Parks.

Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda both at the end of long and distinguished film careers are perfectly cast as Norman and Ethel Thayer Jr. One wonders just what Norman's professorship was in? Henry's daughter Jane plays their screen daughter, Charlie, an old flame still delivers the mail and she shows up with a boyfriend and his son Billy played by Doug McKeon who at 14 never played a better role. The two marina attendants, one showing off youthful pec development are the only other actors on screen. Of course the pair of loons and the fish are every bit as important to the script. And the lake is an equally important character.

As the aging couple the pair are note perfect, they are mercifully spared a gag reel of flubbed lines. Since the piece is adapted from a screen play the sets are limited to the cottage, the boat on the lake and the dock. The majority of the film involves the developing relationship between Norman and Billy as Norman abandons his morbid pre-occupation with death in his growing enthusiasm for showing Billy how to fish. As Ethel says if I'd known how it would bring Norman out of his shell I'd have rented a 13-year-old ages ago.

Life unfolds slowly and gently on Golden Pond as this couple lives out their golden years. Norman grumbles like an old lion just to prove he can still roar. Billy plays the cool teenager from California and Ethel plays the understanding wife who knows her husband better than he does himself. With the Lake never far from the foreground and the loons calling in the background and a piano score playing obligato this is a movie that calms the soul.",1370217600,,2121,4.63563829787234
74690,2,0784011648,"Wonderful film?  Good god no.

It is the film that Spencer Tracy didn't live to make with Katharine Hepburn.  In Tracy's place, we have Henry Fonda.  And it (the film) and he (Fonda) are lousy.

Nothing happens in this film except for Jane Fonda doing a back-flip off of a dock to earn her daddy's love.  It's stupid.

According to legend, la Jane WANTED/NEEDED/HAD TO make this film with her Dad.  It meant so much to her. Unfortunately, it does not mean that much to the viewer.  All it took was a back-flip off of a dock?  What?

For all of the Fonda/Fonda publicity when this film came out, daddy Henry has woefully little to do.  He's Henry Fonda and he isn't acting now.  He's old and feeble and why Jane ""needed"" to do this with him is beyond me.  But she's Jane Fonda.  Egotistical in a way her father never was. But she's struggling through her ""issues"" and it's the 80's when we all had to get in touch with ourselves.  (This is almost ALWAYS the case when children of famous parents hit the limelight.  The parent is almost always the more talented and the offspring have ""issues"").

Since it's the 80's, Jane has some idiot blonde kid (her boyfriend's son) right out of Central Casting/80's sit-com who is too cool for school and teaches the old couple the way the young'uns think nowadays.  Atrocious.  To make matters worse, la Jane has fallen in love with (are you sitting down?) DABNEY COLEMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's the 80's.  It's Central Casting.  It's a sit-com.  It's atrocious.

Katharine Hepburn, in her unprecedented fourth Oscar winning role, dishes up the Fenwickian Hepburn a la carte.  She dives.  She lugs wood. she dispenses wisdom and elegant elderly lady wardrobe.  She's Katharine Hepburn; she doesn't have to act.

There are so many shots of the pond that those shots alone take up about 15 minutes.  The photography is gorgeous but how much is too much?

It's a bore of a film.  Jane whining about why her father hasn't cared enough/loved enough.  Henry just being an iceberg, and the wonderful Kate trying to thaw everyone.  But with diving all over the place and lugging wood and Indian chants, she has quite a full plate herself.

74741,5,0784011648,"I was quite young when I first saw this movie and I didn't really grasp alot of the more subtle messages within the scenes, but as an adult now I watch this movie and it never ceases to move me.

I have always been a diehard Katherine Hepburn fan so I knew that as time went on I would find more to love in her performance as well as Henry Fonda's, and I have.

Not only is this movie visually stunning in the way it was filmed, but the humor and bittersweet relationship between Henry and Kate rings so true to life.  As a couple who have been married for many decades, they have learned to accept the flaws and love the virtues in each other, having grown so close together in their marriage that their daughter, played by Jane Fonda, never really felt like she fit.

Honestly, the character of the daughter, Chelsea, doesn't really add much to the storyline for me as much as the step grandson does.

This was such a beautiful story for so many reasons, but it was the way that these two people entering the twilight of their lives loved each other so much, so well, that they truly understood each other to the point of not knowing where one ended adn the other began.  Kate's character, Ethel, is as much in love with her husband on his 80th birthday as the day she married him.  While she is an upbeat, positive person by nature, she buoys her curmugeon husband, Norman, as he comes to terms with the fact that their time together and their time in this life, was growing short.

They go to the house on Golden Pond every year, and on this visit Norman wonders if he will make it to another summer on the pond and if he does come back, will he remember it or the many years of memories that were forged there.  He's angry at life because it passed him so quickly, leaving him with a sense of frustration for the things that went undone, the conversations unspoken, the choices never made.  He wonders if his wife has regrets about those choices and yet he won't bring himself to ask, instead he tries to push her away so that when his time comes, it won't hurt her so badly.

And, when their daughter and her boyfriend come out to the lake for Norman's big 80th birthday party, they leave behind the boyfriend's 13 year old son, Billy, behind while they head off to Europe.

Ethel convinces Norman to agree to keep the boy for the summer while Chelsea goes off with her boyfriend as a favor to their daughter, a gift, an olive branch to the daughter who carries a massive chip on her shoulder, so Norman agrees because, quite honestly, he cannot deny his beloved Ethel anything she wants.

There is tremendous humor and poignancy in this story as Norman realizes that he isn't just the old man that he chafes at being, he's still got something to teach to this young boy who is willing to listen and learn.  Norman teaches the boy how to fish, about classic literature, how to fix the hinges on the porch screen door, and in doing so he recaptures a moment in time that he thought had passed.

And watching this is his wife, who loves him more than he realizes, and who is all too aware of the time that keeps moving them forward.

The movie is about love, human frailty and the understanding borne of both that brings home the point that it is never too late to start a conversation that is long overdue. It's about seeing the world through someone else's eyes, sharing experiences and knowledge that would otherwise be lost and accepting that while you can never go back in time, you can cherish the memories you made while doing the best you could in the moment.

I love this movie and I would never consider my movie collection complete without it.",1318118400,8,3658,4.371681415929204

74746,5,0784011648,"I saw this when it first came out and remembered almost exclusively the negative side of the old man, as expertly acted by Fonda.  He was so hard on his daughter, who came to him as a wounded girl in spite of her life working elsewhere, far away from the vacation home in New England.  In a way, it mirrored the way I have felt about my own father, also a difficult if warmhearted man.  I identified completely with their daughter, who is struggling with his putdowns, remembering slights and criticism far too long and unable to move on.  So I didn't want to watch it again, that is, until I heard Jane Fonda talk about reconciliation and what making the film meant to her.  We had had it for at least 5 years,  never played.

I am happy to admit that my memories of the film were completely skewed.  The most powerful thing in the film that I noticed this time, as a much older man in a 20-year marriage that is essentially good, is the chemistry and effort that the old couple makes to keep things together.  It is beautiful, touching, and completely believable in the balance they must strike.  There is also the playful humor of the old curmugeon, with his faults, vulnerabilities and fears as he tries so hard to make his way with dignity while knowing that his body is failing him and that death will come soon.  I do not think that I have ever seen Fonda or Hepburn better, acting more naturalistically and spontaneously than the heavily stylized stuff that came out of the hollywood of their era.  Indeed, they reveal entire new sides to their talent.

The other subplots are also wonderfully successful.  The daughter's boyfriend, so comically fearful of the outdoors, draws a very clear line beyond which he will not tolerate jibes from the father.  Jane is also excellent, though her performance is perhaps the weakest of the film.  Finally, there is adolescent boy whom they dump on the couple while they take a trip to Europe - the evolution of his relationship with the old man is difficult but fruitful, revealing an aspect to him that the daughter cannot quite see.

Alas, the ending was a bit too pat and schmaltzy for my taste - too much gets resolved, the feelings and breakthroughs appeared rushed to me - it is still a very moving film with as much psychological realism as hollywood can tolerate.  It achieves the status of good art that one can perceive in wildly different ways at different times in one's life.

Warmly recommended.",1313452800,,2457,4.568493150684931
74747,5,0784011648,"I was 12 when this came out. I was on a cruise with my mother and it played in the on board movie theater. At that age, it wasn't the kind of movie I would go and see, but on the ship, I was off doing my own thing and saw it out of lack of anything else to do. I was bored with the arcade and whatever else there was for a 12 year old boy to do.

I loved it! When I got home from the cruise it was on HBO quite a bit, and saw it a good number of times. But then it went away like so many films do. It left my memory over the years. Today is August 14, 2011, 30 years almost to the day I first saw it, and there it is on showtime. I'm 42 years old now.

The story is about getting old, being young and appreciating the smaller simpler things in life, a lake, nature, fishing, and the larger things like enjoying life and family, and getting the most out of the time we have here in this life.

Unless you have a cold heart, you will laugh, and if you are a sensitive person you may even cry. With the brilliant acting and sharp lines that jump out of nowhere to sometimes stab you, this movie is a classic for the ages. A must see for every human being.

So, too, is the teenage boy in the movie. His continual use of foul language would be laughable, were it not so pitiful, (or is it pathetic?). It's no wonder he never got another acting job and disappeared into obscurity.

It is sad to see Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn in their nearly dead stages in this movie but they did a good job making something memorable out of this movie even with such lousy co-stars to work with. Dabney Coleman? He is utterly forgettable, as always.

74753,5,0784011648,"In the early '70s, Henry Fonda and daughter Jane hoped to appear together with Jane's brother Peter in a Revolutionary War drama, but that project never came to fruition. ON GOLDEN POND was in hindsight a final chance for two members of this talented family to make a picture together, and what a film it is!

Kate Hepburn, who clearly manifests the Essential Tremor (not Parkinson's) that had afflicted her for many years, won a fourth and final Best Actress Oscar here, and Henry matched her with his first (and only) Best Actor statuette. (NOTE: neither were at the Awards ceremonies that night.)

Jane was nominated as well, for a limited supporting role that she is quite good in. Her crucial final scenes with dad get emotional and the viewer feels these two aren't acting as much as truly relating to each other. It's a real privilege to share such an intimate moment with two superlative performers who just happen to be blood relations.

Hepburn, like the younger Fonda, is somewhat peripheral to a male-bonding story of her ""old poop"" and the 12-year-old son of Jane's fianc (Dabney Coleman). The role of Billy Ray Jr. surely is Doug McKeon's best work. Billy and the naturally aloof Norman Thayer (Fonda) spar at first but find common ground (both are 'junior's and they favor a certain 8 letter word for cow manure). Ultimately these two become the closest of friends in a quest to land the lake's legendary ""whopper"" fish. There's genuine drama here when a boating accident occurs and both are violently thrown from their wrecked craft.

ON GOLDEN POND is in the end about resolution and acceptance: of the elderly for an uncertain future, of a long-married couple who love each other more than they openly express, of a father and daughter who've been estranged for far too long, and of an alienated boy who comes to grips with a new ""mom"" in his life (one that at age 43 is a knockout in a bikini!), and who finds in that woman's father a kind and accepting friend.

74763,5,0784011648,"This is a movie with many themes and they are woven into a warm blanket of understanding for the viewer.  It covers love, family conflict, dementia, growing up, growing old and growing wise.

Norman Thayer (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) arrive at their summer cabin on the lake somewhere in the northeast.  They have owned the cabin for a long time.  Norman reads old newspaper clippings of his retirement as a college professor, a smart and respected man - and yet Norman does not recognize people in a framed picture or remember the telephone operator's name.  You see he is dealing with dementia and sometimes frustrated.  He is a proud man and covers up a lot with his cantankerous nature.

This summer their daughter, Chelsea, (Jane Fonda) arrives with her fiance Bill Ray (Dabney Coleman) and his 13 year old son Billy (Doub McKeon) from a previous marriage.  They leave Billy with the Thayers as they want a romantic vacation in Europe together.

Norman is grumpy but agrees to have Billy for the summer.  He is also thinking a lot about turning 80 and his health.  He has never understood how to raise a daughter and did not get along with Chelsea as a youngster - calling her ""fat"" and overall distant and unloving. Chelsea can't get the ""chip"" of his comments off her shoulder and move on - yet Norman may not live very long.

Somehow, alone with Billy, Norman blossoms and also helps Billy to really enjoy his time at the cabin with two ""old folks"" - fishing brings Norman and Billy together.  When his daughter returns at the end of the summer, an understanding and reconciliation happens with her as well..

Golden Pond and the Thayer's ""golden years"" deal with loss of health, dementia, aging through a wonderful cast and well-written script.  Jane Fonda's real-life issues with her dad Henry seem all too similar to those on the screen.  You wonder if she is acting or reacting to his cantankerous comments.

74766,4,0784011648,"I liked this film much better the first time I saw it. That may say something about the movie; on the other hand, it may say something about me. First the cinematographer Billy Williams gets a flat A. The shots of the water from ""On Golden Pond"" literally shimmer. Mr. Williams obviously lay in wait a long time to get the gorgeous footage of the loons as well. And I understand that we are to get the double meaning of ""golden,"" the beautiful pond and the end of life. The plot is simple. Norman (Henry Fonda) and Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) Thayer return to their summer home on Golden Pond to celebrate Norman's 80th birthday, which he decribes as twice as bad as a 40th. They are visited by a distant daughter-- in both geography and family relations-- Chelsea (Jane Fonda). She is accompanied by a new boy friend Bill (Dabney Coleman) and his thirteen-year-old son Billy (Doug McKeon). The conflict has to do with Norman and Chelsea's strained relationship and the contrast between a thirteen-year-old and an eighty-year-old.

I looked at my watch several times while watching this film-- particularly during the first 30 or 45 minutes or so-- not something I do for what I consider a five star movie. Hepburn used the phrase ""you old poop) at least one time too many and Henry Fonda was just a tad too crabby. When Jane Fonda made her first appearance on screen, she was more bronzed than the current Congressional Minority Leader John Boehner-- and that's way too much brown-- and had more hair than anyone you expect to meet outside a Wal-Mart. On the other hand, we do get to watch three first-class actors, the two Fondas and Hepburn. Much has been made of the fact that this was the elder Fonda's last movie, that he had never appeared in a film with his daughter and that the two of them, at least Jane, were not acting in the teary scenes between daughter and father as theirs apparently was not always the best of relationships.

Of course the theme of confronting one's own mortality and the loss of memory appeals to the most jaded of film-watchers so one could do a lot worse than seeing this film again.",1246233600,,2119,4.588390501319261

74768,3,0784011648,"I didn't hate this movie, but there is really nothing overly special about anything in it.  The characters are clich ridden and the acting, while universally solid, rarely transcends just that.  There is nothing here that begs to be remembered really, and the generic and unrealistic way in which the plot is developed (and quite frankly, the lazy ending) is almost frustrating beings that the center moral concerning the fear of aging deserves a better canvas.

The film focuses on a elderly couple, Norman and Ethel Thayer, as they retreat to their cabin on Golden Pond to celebrate Norman's eightieth birthday.  Norman is a crotchety old man (clich) and Ethel is his feisty spirited wife (clich) and so the two of them make for an interesting pair (or I should say, they would make for an interesting pair had this formula not been used in every movie).  Their wayward daughter Chelsea decides to drop by to introduce her parents to her new boyfriend and ask them for a favor.  She wants them to watch her boyfriend's son Billy Ray for a month while they slop away to Europe.  She claims the boy will be miserable, but it's obvious that she will be miserable if the boy is with them.

What happens next is a `quote-unquote' heartwarming tale of an elderly man finding his youth in the eyes of a young boy who just needed a little love.  Norman loses his hard edge when given the opportunity to bond with Billy Ray, and Billy finally finds someone to take an interest in him.

Something like that.

I had a hard time really taking this film all that seriously because it wasn't very serious.  The subject and the issues dealt with are really very lightly handled, nothing ever truly sinking in to feel even remotely genuine.  I especially found the `father/daughter' situation to be almost brushed under the rug, even though it's boasted as one of the films core situations.

The end resolve feels lazy to me.

This movie won Oscars for both Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda, and while they are serviceable here (and Katherine is actually quite hilarious throughout) there is nothing in these performances that demands to be rewarded, especially when you have much better performances nominated alongside these ones (Diane Keaton is extraordinary in `Reds' and Dudley Moore is comedic gold in `Arthur').  I can't say that these wins anger me, because they are not `bad', but they should not have garnered gold, that year or any for that matter.  Even more baffling is the nomination for Jane Fonda who does nothing but cry, and even those tears are unconvincing.  Her character arch is undeveloped and unfinished and thus incomplete and so her performance suffers from lack of real material.

The only performance I would consider as nomination worthy is that of Doug McKeon, who actually takes young Billy Ray and makes him a believable child with real issues and a halfway believable resolve.

So, what do I mean by all the `saccharine melodrama' and `forced sympathies' talk?  Well, to be brutally honest, this film is a syrupy mess.  Any actually sentiment is lost amidst the films pulpy atmosphere.  Everything, from the overly clichd characters to the sappy soap opera music begs the listener to fall in love with the surface characters, but the film fails to delve any deeper into who they really are.  In the end, this feels like a rather pointless film that fails to deliver anything more than standard or average entertainment.  It could have been so much better than it was had the script not been so predictably average.",1241568000,3,3535,4.793729372937293

Had to admit that before watching it I was a bit skeptical, I thought it would be just one of those boring hyper-romantic films but....  Finally when I got the chance to watch it I was breathtaken! This film is simply a masterpiece of a time that, unfortunately, is long gone. A time where love could last a lifetime and still be beautiful at the end of life. How many of those films are made today in this hasty divorce filled time? Not many I'd say!  It was such a beautiful experience to watch this film and in a strange way it made me also sad. Mainly because today's world isn't like that anymore for how many people can stay in love and care for eachother after 50 years? The theme of everlasting love, knowing eachothers habits through a whole life is really something very very special.  The roles as the elderly couple were also played with such an honesty that it was amazing and the music plus the landscape and the actual calmness of the film makes it into a film that won't ever be forgotten; at least it shouldn't be!  Of course it's romantic but it's also realistic and that's what makes it different from other socalled romantic films. There's a catch in it and there's something to think about too!  The beauty of these two old people and their relationship is something I believe many people will envy. Having been together for half a century and still being so much in love as the film shows.

74785,1,0784011648,"This gag worthy and highly artificial concoction throws in every late twentieth century clich on cross generational bonding: a tremulous geriatric couple who appear to have been loaned by the ""Carol Burnett Show"", (remember when Carol and Harvey Korman did the elderly couple--and he grabbed her by the leg?)which is to say, they are as bristly and acerbic as a hairbrush in their testy public exchanges, but in their tender moments, they just brim with tearful, ""genuine"" reminiscent emotions.

In other words, it traffics in the type of Jimmy Carter era ""authenticity"" that consists in and of overalls, flapjacks, and maple syrup. One keeps expecting Will Geer to appear.

And who better to interpret this type of thing, than the dessicated ""Hank"" Fonda and Kate Hepburn, both of whom had long since discarded their by now forgotten, (but oh how much more appealing!) suaver selves in the more moth eaten environs of the RKO prop department.

Visually the film is suffused with Vermont travelogue optics--stereotypical slanting sunbeams on the lake ad nauseam, and it must be added, to the point that the whole thing looks like a very extended margarine commercial.

The script follows suit--for amidst the unbearable schmatlz, it takes pains to contain all the Norman Learish style ""hep"" touches--scatological humor, profanities, etc. (after all, lest we forget, Jane Fonda is in this too) meant to assure the audience that, we are dealing with ""real"" people, that this is in fact the late 20th century, and Ozzie and Harriet don't live here any more. Thus we are treated to such endearing witticisms as ""let's suck face!"". And yes it really is that embarrasing.

In short, it has all the sham sincerity of a Hallmark greeting card for an Octagenerian. You know the type--with the oaken bucket and the black eyed Susan peeping out?

74787,5,0784011648,"If anyone ever tells you, you are too old to do great things, this movie will make you think twice about that statement. Both Henry Fonda and Kathryn Hepburn do a great performance in this film. There really is no real plot to this film per say, unless you call living to 80 or 70 years old a great achievement, which I do; now being 50 myself.  When you look at most grave stones in a cemetary, most don't live to be 40 years old and those that die young are cremated, never telling how they came to an early end in their life.

However, one underlining message flies home from the get go with this film; you are never too old to live life and enjoy it. It also will cause the young to think what might lie ahead of them in their golden years, should they live to be so old. I especially enjoyed the presence of Doug McKeon, who plays the ""grandson"" in the story named Billy Ray, Jr.. This kid's got a great personality he brings into this role and also brings a great deal of warmth between himself and Henry Fonda's character, Norman Thayer, where we see the very old looking at the very young; an age old contrast.  The boy certainly thinks his elder counter part is not too old to do young things, which makes for great character interaction in the film.

The story studies the interaction of a rather dysfunctional family, with ample room for character development and revelation, which it does. There are many humorous moments and tear jerking moments, as well through it all.

74796,5,0784011648,"ON GOLDEN POND may be twenty-five years old but the film is of such high quality that it has retained the luminous quality that garnered so many awards when released.  It not only has a fine script adapted by the playwright Ernest Thompson from his own play, but it benefits from the sensitive direction by Mark Rydell and a cast of superb actors.

The story is rather simple: Ethel (Katherine Hepburn) and Norman (Henry Fonda) Thayer have returned to their summer home beside Golden Pond and while they are elderly, their lives are still significant.  They receive a rare visit from their distant daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) who stops by with her current boyfriend Bill (Dabney Coleman) to drop off Bill's ruffian teenage son Billy (Doug McKeon) to reluctantly stay with them while Chelsea and Bill are off to Europe.  It is a battle of age differences: Billy sees no future in starting a relationship with the old turkeys and Norman is resentful at the youth's attitude (Ethel is the wise mediator).  Slowly but surely the three bond, age differences diminish as negatives and Billy sees Norman as a wise teacher he has never had.  Chelsea returns at summer's end with her now husband Bill and faces confrontation with Norman for never being the father she needed: Chelsea knows Norman has spent his life rejecting her because she was not the 'son' he wanted!  Finally the family reconciles past differences and Ethel and Thayer face their aging and its effects as they listen to the loons on the lake.

Hepburn, both Fondas, Coleman and McKeon give outstanding performances, but it is the knowledge that this was H. Fonda's last film and for all intents and purposes Hepburn's last film AND the only time the Fonda father/daughter team acted together on the screen that makes the film even more meaningful.  The awards were many and well deserved, not only for the picture, but also for the actors and the production crew.

74802,5,0784011648,"The rumors about Ben Affleck and Matt Damon starring in a remake of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid""* got me thinking:

*(I can't believe what a marvelous idea that is, by the way. For one thing, they have REAL chemistry -- not pretend chemistry like Paul Newman and Robert Redford. And what's with Redford naming everything of his ""Sundance""??? Get over it -- it was forty years ago!!!)

What other so-called ""classics"" can be improved with modern filmmaking styles?

- ""Jaws"": obviously, CGI effects would allow you to see the shark all the time, which would be TONS scarier.

- ""Star Wars"": George Lucas constantly changes them anyway, so why not start over completely on the old ones? Not only could Jimmy Smits play a larger role in the ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" like he's supposed to, but you could cast Paul Walker as Luke Skywalker, Tara Reid for Princess Leia, Ashton Kutcher to play Han Solo, and Michael Clarke Duncan as Chewie. Plus, Jar-Jar could make a cameo appearance to delight the fans!

- ""To Kill a Mockingbird"": Is there a better person to play Atticus Finch than affable George Clooney? I think not. Nor could anybody be more suited for the role of Scout than the always-adorable Dakota Fanning. And Chris Tucker was born to play the black dude accused of assaulting a redneck lady. Plus, the ending could be redone so that Boo Radley turns out to be, like, a ninja or something, hiding in the house all the time because he's a government assassin. He uses Keyhole Spy Satellite technology to find out the kids are in trouble.

- ""Lawrence of Arabia"": Considering the current geopolitical climate, it should be retitled as ""Lawrence of A Future U.S. Territory"" and star somebody more masculine than Peter O'Toole. The Rock, for example. (Although they both have manly, phallic names.)

- ""Sabrina"": the first two tries didn't cut it. This time, have Pixar take a crack at it.

- ""On Golden Pond""? One word: nudity.

Obviously, my future as a studio-executive is bright.",1139356800,5,1994,4.7398843930635834
74803,3,0784011648,"I recently saw this film for the first time.  I had continually refused to watch it because of Katharine Hepburn.  But curiousity made me want to see both her and Henry Fonda's Oscar Winning Performances.  Beautifully photographed with a haunting musical score this film scores on most counts, primarily because of Henry Fonda's outstanding Oscar Winning performance.  He makes this film!  Katharine Hepburn's role is secondary to his and her nervous twitching (NO SHE DID NOT HAVE PARKINSON'S DISEASE)and patrician mannerisms are a distraction.  I know Jane Fonda held out for her to do the part but it is known for a fact that Barbara Stanwyck campaigned very hard to get it.  No doubt, if Stanwyck had played it, she and Henry Fonda would have been reunited after forty years (they had made three films together in the past namely, ""The Mad Miss Manton"" (1938), ""You Belong to Me"" (1941) and their masterpiece ""The Lady Eve"").  Mr. Fonda always said that Stanwyck was his favorite leading lady it is with wistfulness that I wish she had played Ethel Thayer instead of Hepburn.  No doubt she would have gotten her long overdue Oscar as well!  Jane Fonda should have realized that ""real movie magic"" would have been made had Stanwyck gotten the role of Ethel Thayer.  This won't be one of my favorite films (mainly because of Hepburn) but it has its merits namely the conflict between father and daughter (Fonda and Fonda), a fantastic performance by Timothy McKeon, the bratty 13 year old who comes to be the son Norman Thayer (Fonda) never had.  What a tremendous chemistry between the two of them.  While there is chemistry between Hepburn and Fonda, this film would have been a thousand times better with Stanwyck and Fonda.",1137456000,2,1729,4.840136054421769
74804,5,0784011648,"On Golden Pond was Henry Fonda's last film, Katherine Hepburn's final starring film role and the only film with Henry and Jane Fonda.  Just for this it's a must have DVD.  Add to this Ernest Thompson's brilliant adaptation of his Broadway smash.

Norman and Ethel Thayer (Hank and Kate) are at the end of their lives (Great line: Ethel: ""I met this nice middle age couple just like us.""  Norman: ""Ethel we're not middle aged.  Middle aged refers to the middle third of your life.  You're old, I'm ancient."").  They are spending their summer at their cabin.  When their daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) arrives for a visit with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman), she springs a surprise on them.  She wants Norman and Ethel to take care of Bill, jr. while she and Bill, sr. go to Europe.

At first, things don't go well but Norman bonds with Billy and Billy gives Norman a new focus on life.  When Chelsea returns, it's time for her and Norman to mend fences.

This is a fine film that examines relationships at the end of life and mending the broken fences.  Many say that Fonda won the Oscar for ""Lifetime Achievement"" but this is a brilliant performance.  Hepburn was a perfect match for Fonda and after six decades, she proved why she is considered the greatest actress of all time.  You can tell that this was a film of love for Jane as she absorbs every line and every scene.

This is one of the great films of the 80's.

DVD EXTRAS:

Reflections on Golden Pond - A 30 minute feature on the making of the film and principally on cinematographer Billy Williams.  A very good documentary.

Katherine Hepburn Remembered - A 16 minute tribute to the great actress made shortly after her death for this DVD release.

74805,5,0784011648,"It is said that the swan sings only once in its life. A beautiful, first and last chant. Through ages swans have been considered the icon of the eternal faithfulness. Surely this comparison should be with loons, but I am afraid I prefer swans.

Norman and Ethel Thayer are facing the end of their lives together. Norman is a man who sees how bitter and cruel time and agen can be with a man. And he cannot cope with that. Ethel is the other side of the coin, always trying to enjoy what life can give to her. Getting old is not easy, specially today when it is seen almost like a vice in a society that only asumes that youth and beauty are worth . The film deals with all the aspects in life we have to face while getting older, or better, when we know there is not much time left. Like Norman has to deal with the fact that his head is not as brilliant as it used to be,. While Ethel wants to keep by her side the man she loves. Or Chelsea their daughter trying to say goodbye to a man she had never understood.

This film has this crepuscular aspect that makes it beautiful and sad at the same time. It gives us the last performance on the big screen of Henry Fonda. And whjat an end!. He is a real man. Sometimes we like him and sometimes we not. He can be tender, and bitter and a real son of....but he is real. I think that the best praise we can make to this film is that it shows that we are always the same no matter how old we are. Our spirits are the same, it is only that our bodies are not.

Henry Fonda and Billy, over time, become good friends. Fonda is just terrific as the cantankerous father figure, angry at getting old, and Kate is great, too, as his life-long companion.

Fans of movies like ""A River Runs Through It"" should find this to their taste.

This film offers great insight into aging and the fears that go along with it.  Jane Fonda adds a brilliant performance as the daughter who is distant from her father.  She is a great actress and has many great films, but this is by far her best role.  You add the amazing direction of Mark Rydell and classic cinematography of Billy Williams and you get the most beautiful film made.  The film is truely stunning.",1113436800,2,740,4.455223880597015
74813,5,0784011648,"Much of this film revolves about the coming of age of the two main male characters: 13-year-old Billy (Doug McKeon), who is facing the teenage years and approaching adulthood with a bit of trepidation and the anger that only a teenager can manage; and 80-year-old Norman (Henry Fonda), who is facing approaching death with a bit of trepidation and the anger that only a New England curmudgeon can manage.

These two seeming opposites form an unlikely friendship with one another, as Billy is left, not by choice, with his (step-)grandparents for the summer. The forming of the relationship between the two is really beautifully and realistically handled and quite entertaining to watch.  Consider this exchange just after Billy's parents have gone off, leaving him:

Billy (brash and teenager-like): This is all [BS]!

Norman (looking up from his book): You like that word, don't you?

Billy (defiantly): Yeah!

Norman: (nodding) Good word. (Goes back to reading)

This really takes the wind out of Billy's sails.  You can see the wheels turning in his head.  He had been all set to put on his angry teenager hat and rebel against the old fuddy-duddy attitude, and instead, it turns out that his grandparents may be old, but they are NOT as stiff as he thought.  Hmm!  Guess some re-thinking is in order.

By the way, speaking of language.  Back when the film was first out in the 1980s, my family (mom and grandparents) recommended it to one of my great-aunts (and corresponding uncle), who we thought would really enjoy it.  To our surprise, they were quite shocked.  All they could talk about was the ""Language!""  My goodness.  I do not find any of the (pretty mild) language at all gratuitous.  [BS] is pretty much the naughtiest word IN this film; and if you have ever been around any teenagers from California in the last 30 years, you know that they certainly do say things like that (and worse) in real life.  (I guess if you are going to find that sort of thing hopelessly distracting to your enjoyment of the movie, you should stick to films rated G.)

A few days later, Billy finds himself standing between his grandparents in the front seat of their powerboat.  ""So, how fast does this old tub go, anyway?""  Norman spins the throttle, and the acceleration pastes Billy into the back seat in a crumpled heap.  This is way cool, even if you ARE a teenager from California!  Before long, Billy and Norman are inseparable buddies.  (I should add that Norman also gets the occasional comeuppance from Billy in return, but you will have to see the film to experience those.)

But there other equally rich characters and relationships; Ethel, Norman's wife (Katherine Hepburn), whose sweet exterior overlays a heart of solid oak, and who loves Norman deeply in spite of himself.  And their daughter, Chelsea (Jane Fonda) who is largely estranged from them, and is shocked to see young Billy forming the bond of friendship with Norman that she never had as his own daughter.  There is great emotional range in all of these combinations.  (Dabney Coleman as Chelsea's new husband and Billy's father is really just a throwaway comic-relief character, but good as far as that goes.)  By the way, you could easily argue that Jane Fonda turns in the weakest performance of the film.  This is not to say that she did a bad job, because I for one don't think that is true at all; what it shows is just how high a level of artistry this entire film maintains.

And oh, is this a beautiful film.  The nature photography alone is breathtaking.  And Dave Grusin's musical score is nothing short of magical.  (The main title music accompanying Norman and Ethel's drive through the heavenly New England countryside is so simple, and so elegant, but its quiet beauty is also haunted by a touch of sadness. This music sets the tone for the entire film, and indeed, the main title theme returns often in different guises throughout.)  I hate to repeat the tired phrase ""You will laugh, you will cry"" but it is true.  This film has joy, and sadness, and laughter, and pain, and beauty, just as much as life itself does.  If the word ""bittersweet"" were not already in the language, someone would have had to invent it for this film.

If you allow this film to touch you at all, (and, true, some people, like my older, now-departed relatives mentioned before, just do not understand it or allow it to reach them) it will become a lasting part of you; at least, I found this to be true for myself.  And that is really the highest praise you could give any work of art in any medium.",1106352000,6,4566,4.6800501882057715
74814,5,0784011648,"Hepburn and Fonda are excellent! I have watched this movie time and time again and still find myself brought to tears. The journey of parent and child is painfully raw in stubborness and forgiveness. The difference in generations is another bridge to be crossed. With time and mutual respect it does get crossed which makes for a nice ending.

Also the painful awareness of aging and illness brings one to face their own mortality. In short, life is short, make everyday full of whats important.

74815,2,0784011648,"I remember watching this when it first came out. I had just entered my 20's, and at the time I don't think I even knew who Henry Fonda was. I think I knew who Katharine Hepburn was. I can't really remember my opinion of it then, except vaguely I think I thought it was only mediocre.

Now I am 42, and I enjoy classic film. I have seen many Katharine Hepburn films. I have only seen a few Henry Fonda ones because he has never been a favorite male actor of mine. Actually, he for the most part bothers me somehow, and I can't put my finger on it. It is the same way that Fred MacMurray really bothers me. How did these 2 ever keep on in the movies? Very weird icky leading men.

Anyway, my daughter wanted to see this film, to see KH and HF in old age roles. The library had it,  and we watched it last night. My main feeling is the same...only mediocre, nothing that great. Sure, there is some beautiful photography in there. But noone really impressed me with their acting, and I found the story a bore. I don't get into dysfunctional family films, and I don't like modern films (mid- 1960's to present). I don't think there were many such films in the classic film period. A few come to mind...A Bill of Divorcement with Katharine Hepburn and John Barrymore, and Dodsworth, with Walter Huston and Ruth Chatterton. But back then, movies were just so much better, more interesting. People did more than whine. Jane Fonda just seemed like a whiner. All thru the film I just kept thinking, get over it. The past is the past. Move on. Quit whining. I don't think she was a good actress here. Some of the lines she said just didn't convince me. Some of Henry Fonda's lines didn't have much feeling in them either. Back to Jane...she didn't always have to be in a swimsuit, tight shorts, halter tops...she must have wanted to show off her body a lot here.

I was very offended at all the swearing and bad language in this film. Since I do not watch modern films, to hear this is very shocking. Hearing 2 old people use vulgar language is sad. Hearing children use vulgar language is likewise sad. It didn't impress me. There was no need for these people to talk like that. Another reason I like the classics...people could talk then and had vocabularies. Also, they kept their clothes on.

I felt the story was hokey...too much of a ""quick fix"" in the end in the relationship with Jane and her dad. Years of a neglected relationship can't be fixed in 20 minutes.

I doubt I will ever watch this again. And I would definately not recommend it for children with all the bad language and the dysfunctional relationships. Katharine Hepburn definately did much better work than this film.",1099785600,9,2679,4.42393509127789

You should go back in time until 1971 with the Last Picture Show , The Miracle worker in 1962 , Marty in 1955 and It's a wonderful life in 1946 to name the most remarkable pictures which deal with familiar problems telling an absorbing and original story .

This is Henry Fonda's last film and his farewell movie sums up all things that made him a legend. How many screen legends get to play one of the best roles of their career in their last movie, that's why this movie is even more special. This is one of the most moving, honest, and touching performances I've seen. Katharine Hepburn gave a marvelous support to Fonda (in the end this is really his movie), she just has a glow around her that's contagious. Her knight in shining armor speech was just beautiful. Both actors are at the top of their acting prowess, they work beautifully together.

The movie has a very calming effect probably because of the setting. It's a very relaxing movie to watch even though they tackled subjects like the fear of mortality, estrangement, and losing oneself to age probably because it showed it in such a positive light. I whole heartedly recommend this movie. This is a movie worth keeping. .

But under director, Mark Rydell's command, the film version became a tender, poignant and loving account of old age and loving through the ages. Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda (who had never worked together before)were ideal as Ethel and Norman Thayer. Jane is Chelsea, Norma's headstrong, rebellious daughter. See the parallel yet? What followed was a tear-jerker that never became maudelin or trite.
TRANSFER: A really handsome looking transfer indeed. Though plagued by hints of edge enhancement throughout, this updated, remastered anamorphic DVD transfer is much more rich and varied with its color palette than the previously issued DVD. Film grain is still present but greatly reduced over the previous DVD. Fine details tend to get lost during the darker scenes, but over all, the film elements hold up remarkably well. Blacks are black. Contrast and shadow levels are bang on. The audio has been remastered to 5.1 with impressive results and a natural sounding spread across all five speakers.
EXTRAS: A good documentary on the film's cameraman and a little nothing on Kate Hepburn's career that, unfortunately, shows too little in the way of clips from Hepburn's illustrious film career. Also, the ""Loving Through Time"" documentary that was far superior to either of these - included on the previously issued DVD - is absent here. It follows the film's development and creation and its popular aftermath far more succinctly than anything featured on this disc. Also, the trailers included on the previous DVD release are not reproduced on this disc.
BOTTOM LINE: My advice is to get both versions of this film on DVD. Though this is clearly the better looking and sounding DVD of the actual film transfer - the other DVD is essential for its extra features content.",1071964800,6,1963,5.061728395061729

It won three Oscars: Best Actor(Henry Fonda in his last movie role), Best Actress(Katharine Hepburn, her forth in her career), and Best Director(Mark Rydell).  Its unique plot gives it further joy to the audience.  Its theme of Norman'(Fonda) anger increasing dramatically because of getting old always has its twists and turns.  The emotion is never lost.  While Norman tries to reconcile with his estranged daughter, Chelsea, many life changing events occur that keep the audience interested.  Such mix of events, plus a few others, are combined wonderfully by the writer.  He accomplished a more difficult challenge considering there aren't many characters.  The screenplay lives up to the original stage version.  The acting is wonderful.  Besides the Oscar winning actors who performed brilliantly, Jane Fonda's performance as Chelsea is great.  The entire cast add their own emotional value to the dramatic plot.  Such movie quality makes ""On Golden Pond"" highly enjoyable to watch.

74829,5,0784011648,"I remember with fondness having been booked into a seat next to one of Jane Fonda's production assistants flying back to Boston from Los Angeles early in the 1980s. This was how I learned of the film shooting going on that summer up in rural New Hampshire at Great Squam Lake (the actual setting for the mythical Golden Pond). I really enjoyed having an animated conversation with the young lady, who was obviously very bright and very knowledgeable about various aspects of the movie production, and made sure I was in line to see the new film when it within the following year. Evidently it was rushed through both production and release due to Henry Fonda's failing health and the desire to try to set him up for would certainly be his final attempt to receive the Academy Award that had so long eluded him.  After seeing the movie, there was doubt he deserved the award he eventually received for this role of a lifetime.
It was indeed a bravura performance, one that is as quintessentially American as apple pie or the fourth of July, and one that will long endure as both a popular and critical favorite. Fonda played Norman Thayer, last of the great American curmudgeons, to perfection, and did so with such convincing energy and verve as to remove any and all doubt he knew from personal experience of what he spoke. Moreover, Everything about the production is first rate, from the splendid adaptation of the Broadway play to a screenplay to the wonderfully bucolic and even idyllic setting of one of New Hampshire's more scenic and pristine lake areas. The cast is also superb, and I was quite surprised that Katharine Hepburn did not receive an Oscar for her stellar performance as Ethel Thayer, the long suffering but devoted wife to Norman.
Also quite good is young Doug McKeon, playing the young and challenging son of the Thayer's wayward daughter's boyfriend, dumped on the elderly Thayers for the summer so the boyfriend and daughter can escape to France for a much-needed romantic escape. It is the developing relationship between Fonda's character and the young boy that ignites Thayer's compassion and warmth to show the warm and vibrant man lurking underneath that crusty exterior. In this sense, the son becomes the catalyst for Thayer's reconciliation with his daughter, which has been Ethel's most fervent hope for the summer.  The movie is, for me at least, sheer magic, and I marvel at the banter and repartee written so intelligently into the script, for such wit and warmth is quite rare in today's films, which so often seem to be constructed around demographic appeal surveys rather than meaningful story lines.  This one is a keeper, folks, and one you will want to see again and again. Needless to say, I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1032220800,31,2764,4.814736842105263
74830,5,0784011648,"This is one fantastic movie. Henry Fonda provided his best in his final movie. The story centers around Norman Thayer's estranged daughter (Played by real life daughter Jane Fonda) who visits her parents at their summer home on Golden Pond. She brings along her Fiance' and his son. The daughter and the boys father leave for Europe, leaving the boy with the older couple. The freinship that developes between the boy and Norman Thayer is teriffic. In an age where movies treat elderly people with contempt, it is good to see that older people can be treated with dignity and respect. Older people tell some fantastic stories (some of them are even true). The friendship developes over Norman and the boy's attempt to catch the fiendish catfish known as Walter. When there is an accident Norman is thrown from the boat. He then clings to a rock calling for his daughter. This especially sd because if you see this movie their relationship is not exactly close. Of course, the boy and Norman are rescued. The daughter and the boys father return from Europe married. At the very end of the movie norman and his daughter begin to patch up their relationship.
This movie is a possitive exzmple of frienship and trust. The boy was rejected by his mother and has to live with his father (Who does love the boy). But because of his mother's rejection he has a lot of anger and resentment. It takes him a while to trust Norman. The entire cast gave a stellar performance.

74834,4,0784011648,"On Golden Pond is a great film about family,love, and death.
Henry Fonda plays an aging old man who's losing it, and is afraid of when his death will come. Katherine Hepburn is his wife who is there to set him straight, and comfort him along his way. Jane Fonda is there daughter, who does not get along well with her father, and is bringing her new boyfriend(Dabney Coleman) and his son to Golden Pond. Golden Pond is where there summer house is located, and where the whole story revolves around. When Jane's character arrives with her boyfriend and his son, Henry's character learns the boyfriends son will be living with them, while his father and his girlfriend go away. Here Henry's character learns to become friends with the boy and learn about his ways. For the boy, he enjoys the summer at Golden Pond with the two old folks. Eventually, the father and daughter reconcile. Suddenly the summer is over, and Kate & Henry's characters are ready to leave when a BIG plot Twist comes along. Here is where all of the main themes start to tie in. If you are looking for a good family film with good themes, this is the right one. Hepburn and H. Fonda won Oscars for there roles, respectively. Jane Fonda deserved the Supporting Actress Oscar, as well as the film, which should have won Best Picture.
Also, great Directing by Mark Rydell who deserved Best Director.

In his final film which earned him the Academy Award, Henry Fonda plays the retired Prof. Norman Thayer Jr. Thayer and his wife Ethel (wonderfully played by Katherine ""the great"" Hepburn) decide to have a birthday celebration at the family lake, and hope to reconcile the bond with their daughter Chelsie (Jane Fonda)! What made me like the film so well was obviously Henry Fonda's character as he deals with the fear of turning 80. Just watching Norman go through these obstacles really made me cry because it's so heart-wrenching to have a person you admire go through all of this! He would almost be like the grandfather you really love, and who you would hate to lose without having a relationship with them. In the end, Chelsea and Norman finally rekindle the bond of a father and daughter relationship.

74836,4,0784011648,"With pursed lips, sparkling eyes, and an old fisherman's cap, Henry Fonda creates an indelible image.  Norman Thayer Jr., crusty old English professor, ranks right up there with the best of the great curmudgeons.  Regular readers of this space will know of my fondness for curmudgeons; they are my favourite of all character types.  Norman ranks right up there with the best of them.  Hank does a fine job showing the outer shell of gruffness, while hinting at the affection hiding in Norman's heart.  He also does a fine job essaying the slow deterioration of what used to be a lightning fast mind.  Norman's big brain is still in there fighting, but can't keep up the same pace that it used to.
Katherine Hepburn (as Ethel Thayer; ""Sounds like I'm lisping"" says Norman with glee) is more than Hank's match.  Her role could have been nothing more than a dowdy housewife, crawling feebly to the end.  But Kate gives Ethel such vibrancy and pep (Pep!) that you'd swear she was in her twenties rather than her seventies (she does some nifty high-stepping at one point, while picking berries in a clearing).  And her chemistry with Hank is divine.  There's one telling scene, after a late-night skinny dip, where the two of them discuss the prospect of their daughter and her boyfriend sleeping in the same bed.  There's not a trace of panic in either of their voices, but Kate shows such tangible pragmatism, you're bound to admire her for her progressive thinking alone.  These aren't your typical, stuck-in-the-mud senior citizens.  These are thoughtful human beings.  Close to the end, sure, but hanging on with all the faculties they have.
The scenes with Jane Fonda are flat.  Someone must have thought that her real-life tormented relationship with Papa Hank would have carried the day, seeing as it mirrors their characters' relationships in the movie.  But she is sappy, sentimental, weak, and seemingly driven by fashion (check out her feathered 'do).  She's the kind of women Norman would verbally skewer on first sight.  But she's his daughter, so he has to settle for reminding her that she was once his ""fat little girl"".  She's hardly a worthy opponent for the old lion.  Dabney Coleman (Billy Ray Sr.), in his one scene of substance, proves that he is.  Dressed in a ridiculous powder-blue suit, and sporting a bushy beard to hide his compromised fat face, Dabney's dentist-boyfriend at first comes off as the typical '80s sensitive baby boomer.  But he sheds that veneer pretty quickly, earning Norman's respect with a well-placed speech.  These two aren't on screen for very long, and really, the story's not about them.
What it *is* about is Norman's relationship with young Billy Ray Jr., played by Doug McKeon.  Billy Ray is dumped in the Thayer's laps so that his Pop and prospective stepmom can go giggling around Europe for a month.  Typically, young Billy Ray is not happy at the prospect of spending his summer with a couple of rotting octogenarians.  But that turns out to be a misconceived perception.  Neither Norman nor Ethel flinch at his repeated use of the term ....thus gaining his respect.  Norman bullies Billy Ray (or as he lovingly calls him, the ""dwarf"") into liking and respecting him.  Their scenes together, usually fishing for a mythical trout, are cute.  Sometimes overly cute, but not enough to ruin things.  And for a man on the verge of death, Norman find himself enjoying the joie de vivre that Billy Ray brings to Golden Pond.  McKeon does a serviceable job (he's better than Jane, that's for sure), but not great.  You can see him trying to be precocious and rebellious all at once.  However, he gets credit for never getting trampled by Hank's gargantuan performance, and their chemistry together is fun to watch.
Sure ""On Golden Pond"" is designed to tug at your heartstrings.  But it works emotionally without being manipulative.  Even after multiple viewings, I still get choked up when Ethel calls Norman ""her knight in shining armour"".  It's sappy, true, but it still manages to carry a lot of weight.",995414400,2,4053,4.855685131195335
74837,4,0784011648,"Just a comment about the Widescreen Review rating for that movie. It has given a 3 for picture quality and a 2 for sound.  I bought the DVD this weekend and I think that the transfer is quite good and enjoyable.  It captures the beauty of the scenery and the sounds of nature (looms, etc.) very faithfully.  Interior scenes are not that bad either: not too dark, well lit.
The movie itself is very beautiful and inspiring.  A very good movie about relationships. Katherine Hepburn, Henry Fonda and Jane Fonda and all the other supporting cast is excellent. Very touching.
Do not hesitate to buy this DVD.  It is not that bad of a transfer.  I personnally think it is a very beautiful transfer. I have a 36 inches Sony Trinitron Wega XBR TV set and the movie shows no sign of bad colorization, grain or other elements of a bad transfer.

74839,5,0784011648,"On Golden Pond is a movie that speaks about many things: the anger an older person feels at growing old and becoming forgetful, the feelings that can be carried around from childhood, the love between a husband and wife, the connections to be made through age and youth, and reconciliation.
Henry Fonda stars as the aging Norman Thayer. With age, Norman has begun to experience forgetfulness and heart angina. Competent of the fact that he's becoming slower and more forgetful, Norman is can come across as an irritable, jaded, and sarcastic man. This is his defense mechanism to overcome the frustration he's feeling. Norman has a loving wife Ethyl who is patient with him but also isn't afraid to rebuke him when he's out of line.
At the request of their daughter, Norman and Ethyl allow a young boy to stay with them (the boy of their daughter's new boyfriend) for the summer. This turns into an experience where an old and young man connect and develop a friendship that helps Norman. Through their experiences together, Norman gets to see how his actions have begun to affect people and you start to see a different person emerge.
The story is dramatic, powerful, touching, and beautiful. Movies like this are indeed rare and should be treasured. It's great that this is finally available on DVD.

His interplay with Katharine  Hepburn reminds one of the rare chemistry she enjoyed with Spencer Tracy in  all the magical movies they made together. Everything Fonda says in this  movie is real and believable, you'll never catch him overacting or playing  one false note. It would be difficult to imagine anyone else in this  role.
Fonda's scenes with daughter Jane are particularly moving  considering their strained real life relationship. Their last embrace at  the conclusion of the film will tug at your heart strings. It's a poignant  and wistful look at growing old and facing death, two unpleasant but  unavoidable subjects. Fonda and Hepburn are literally perfect in this film,  which is also enhanced by a beautiful, haunting soundtrack.
