7905942,4,B00000DGHO,"I found this to be a very interesting movie.
I have always wanted to know why the Six Day War happened, and this video gives many answers. The documentary was made by a Canadian TV team. They followed behind Israeli lines, and as a viewer you are shown how the Israeli feel threatened by the powerful neighbouring countries.

Egypt tells the UN forces to leave. The peace keeping forces have been stationed at Egypt's border to Israel. When Egypt's leader Nasser tells the UN forces to go home, there is nothing to stop the Egyptians from attacking Israel. Nasser is moving troops closer to the border. Jordan and Syria do the same.

Israel is a very small country at the time, and much smaller than their aggressive neighbours. Israel sees only one way to succeed: They have to attack first.

In this documentary you are shown how the very majority of the Israeli population is joining in to protect their country. The commentator tells the viewer that even ice cream wagons were used in the struggle.

One man interviewed says: Before in the concentration camp I did not have a family or a country. Now I have a family and a country"".

It is interesting to see old state leaders interviewed; like Nasser, Begin and Dayan. All in all I like this documentary. The only minus is that the film is old, so the quality is a little bit bad.

Since the TV crew followed behind Israeli lines, you also have to take into perspective that this film is more likely to see things from the Israeli point of view. Keeping in mind that it primarily shows the conflict from one side, I still believe it is a very informative documentary.",1109203200,8,1622,4.556701030927835
7905943,4,B00000DGHO,"This is B&W footage from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's coverage of the Six-Day War (dubbed Operation Strike, Zion! by Israel), the only film crew allowed on the battlefield.

This video has some spectacular shots, such as Israeli figher jet camera footage of the downing of an Egyptian MiG (though, unfortunately, due to age, much of the film quality itself is poor).

Since the film crew was behind Israeli lines, the viewpoint is from their perspective and so may come across as pro-Israeli (as a warning to those who tend to get fanatical on the issue).

Militarily, this is an excellent study of an incredible war where superior intelligence, tactics and resolve were able to overcome superior numbers, arms and technology in a remarkably short period of time.

The only complaint I have is that, for the price, it could have been longer as it is only 60 min. long.  That keeps it from getting more than 3 stars.

(2017 update) - 15 years later, I note this is now available for 1/4 the price than posted in my original review (at one point, for several years, it wasn't even available!).  As such, I have bumped my rating from 3/5 to 4/5.  From 5/5, one star is lost for its possibly one-sided viewpoint and short length, but the 2nd lost star was for price alone, now reconciled.  Good job, publishers!",1026000000,17,1318,4.720524017467249
