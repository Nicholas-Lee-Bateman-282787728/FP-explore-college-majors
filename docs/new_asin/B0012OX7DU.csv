8356003,4,B0012OX7DU,"Set in London, thirty-something lesbian couple Sasha (Lisa Gornick) and Maya (Raquel Cassidy) want to have a child together. As their biological clocks tick away, the women take a hard look at their relationship and explore their options for pregnancy.

In contrast to Sasha and Maya's experience, straight couple Fiona (Joanna Bending) and Todd (Willam Bowry), and single photographer Gillian (Sarah Patterson) are also trying to have children.

Lisa Gornick wrote, directed starred in this clever look at modern-day sexuality and the hurdles that both lesbian and straight couples encounter on their quest to have children. The couple's troubles are nicely contrasted against each other, showing that regardless of sexuality or relationship status, there are challenges in becoming a parent.

Lisa Gornick and Raquel Cassidy bring warmth and humour to the roles of lesbian couple Sasha and Maya. One hilarious scene follows the couple as they stalk potential sperm donors.

8356004,1,B0012OX7DU,I think babies are great really - but why does every lesbian in every film have to want one so bad even straight people could identify with her? that's all - can't we do better as subject matter? the world is very crowded.,1214870400,4,222,4.186046511627907
8356005,5,B0012OX7DU,"This is a wonderfully poignant and charming little movie about three sets of prospective parents: a lesbian couple, a straight couple, and a single woman determined to get some sperm from an unwitting  one-night stand. You just don't see films like this being made in the US (this is a British film). Smart and funny and full of astute emotional observations on the universal question of when and whether (and how) to have a baby.",1203897600,6,430,4.733333333333333
