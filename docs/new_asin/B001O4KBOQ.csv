8329499,5,B001O4KBOQ,"Viva Pinata, Lights, Camera, Action! is a great follow up to the first VP disc, The Pinatas must be crazy. This was the best Saturday morning cartoon in long time! The CGI work is terrific just like Beast Wars & ReBoot. That there should give you a hint of how old I am.
Since I don't have cable or dish, this was one of the cartoons that made you laugh like you were a kid again. Fergy, Hudson, Paulie & the gang have fun at beach parties and other adventures on Pinata island and foiling the evils plots of Professor Pester. Langston is still trying to get Fergie & Paulie to go to parties. Alot of inside jokes that the parents will know and the kids will laugh along. Wish they would of never took this show off the air. But that's Fox & Microsoft for you, get something good and they'll take it away. Can't wait till Shout Factory gets the next DVD's out for sale. Here are the episodes on the DVD. Franklin Can't Dance (which was the first episode), Les Saves The Day...Again, Sick Day, Lights, Camera, Action!, Mad Mongo, Hudson's Biggest Fan, Mission Impinatable, My Little Fergy, The Great Gob Rush, Hero.",1247356800,,1114,4.412621359223301
