8364978,5,B002DB77RS,"This is a great DVD but be SURE that you are interested in seeing a completely UNCENSORED concert.  Redd Foxx certainly was one hell of a dirty old man!  Not Mr. Sanford, by any stretch of the imagination.  Funny?  You Betcha!",1400716800,,226,4.439024390243903
8364979,3,B002DB77RS,video quality very poor good show other wise just as raunchy as he was in person years ago in Minnesota,1391385600,,103,4.2
8364980,5,B002DB77RS,Great DVD which was delivered very promptly from a great seller. I thoroughly enjoyed this Redd Foxx DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Redd Foxx' comedy.,1359849600,2,165,4.724137931034483
8364981,5,B002DB77RS,had this on VHS before lost in a move. This is by no means a commercially produced DVD. It is a VHS transfer to DVD and the quality shows. Still he is one of my favorites and i am glad this is back in my collection. It was missed. Worth having if you can stand a bootleg copy.,1302134400,,276,3.7758620689655173
8364982,5,B002DB77RS,"Redd Foxx is the Original King of Comedy & ""In a Plain Brown Rapper"", he is at his best! He is hilarious! Watch this dvd & you will see Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, & most of the other African American comedians out now! They all need to bow down to the Master! His jokes are original & funny even to this day! Forget Sanford & Son, this man was raw, raunchy, funny & on point with his style & jokes, which have stood the test of time. The dvd is recorded good with good sound. If you have to have one dvd of Redd Foxx stand-up, this is the one. Watch him & Richard Pryor & you will see 99% of todays comedians' jokes & styles...",1282867200,8,626,3.9761904761904763
