8260296,5,B0015XL7N0,This was used as a Christmas gift card tin and had the added gift appeal of DVD's and a Popeye key chain.,1356652800,,105,3.8181818181818183
8260297,3,B0015XL7N0,"I purchased this because my 4yr loves Popeye.  I thought the lunchbox would be great for him to take his snacks to Pre-Kindergarten in.  As another reviewer stated, these cartoons are nothing different from what we already owned had purchased at a close-out store.  The lunchbox is large enough to hold a juice and bag of Kashi chips in but the handle is so closely attached to the box that it's uncomfortable for an adult hand to clutch it.  The DVD's are ""mounted"" on cardboard the size/shape of the lunchbox, no sleeves etc.  I'm not sure why the picture shows DVD cases because there are none.  Unless the DVDs are housed inside the lunchbox you have 3 disks unprotected.  The keychain is attached to Popeye with a screw going through his head.  If truly used with a set of keys I don't know how long it would remain attached. The outside of the lunchbox at the bottom has the information about the DVDs, producer, etc.  I wish that hadn't been made a part of it.  If you are purchasing this for the cartoons, I would hope there are better sets out there, if for the lunchbox, realize it's not a full size, but probably could hold a juice and a sandwich.",1251244800,6,1158,4.4454976303317535

This is just a re-packaging of two public-domain Popeye releases.
