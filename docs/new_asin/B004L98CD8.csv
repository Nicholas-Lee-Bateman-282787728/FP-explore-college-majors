And not spread stuff too, well this comes in the wake of SARS, bird flu, swine flu and generally flu in all its nasty forms and the devastating potential to kill millions of us. It starts by showing what happened in a rural part of the Philippines and how the World Health Organisation managed to contain it, then we move onto a regional hospital in Japan some time late and a man comes in as he is feeling poorly.

He is told he is a bit `under the weather' and to go home and rest. He comes back later that day bleeding from every orifice and despite their best efforts he dies, then his wife falls down and then lots of people do including some of the medical staff. That is when WHO and the Government get involved. In a matter of days `Tamiflu' the only real medicine they have is running so low that patients are going to be prioritised to medics and essential workers only.

The hero doctor is also the ex boyfriend of the WHO Lead Medical Officer, so we have sexual chemistry, unfinished business and misunderstandings that will only hamper their work, she is called Eiko (so was probably named after the whale in `Free Willy').

Things go from bad to worse and they realise they have to find the source in order to be able to fight it. This is a fairly dark look at what would happen if a calamitous epidemic were to break out; you pretty much become a social pariah over night if you even have a sniffle and the rest of the world want you to stay as far away as possible. How would the authorities act, and how soon before the social fabric of society begins to unravel? Well this does address all of those issues, the fact that they have to insert over sentimentality a bit too often I found to be a bit tiresome, but could see why it was done.

Most of the acting is good to middling but there are a couple who do not have actors union cards if their performances were anything to go by. Check out the guy playing `Mr David' I was actually shocked at how rubbish he was, he is speaking in English though so it might have been deliberately hammed up for the Japanese audience, either way he should never be in front of a camera again. There is also some ropey CGI, but also some excellent shots so a bit more consistency would have been great. We also have a rogue medical researcher, which must be the smallest group of `rogue' anything in the world, so a tad unbelievable.

There is a phrase they say as a thread in the film and that is `Even if the world ends tomorrow, plant an apple tree today'; which is great as it says you have to hope - not so good though if you are allergic to apples or there is an outbreak of `Apple Flu'.

Quite a long film at 138 mins, but it was compelling enough for me to sit through it all in one hit. In Japanese and some English with sub titles, this was quite an interesting watch, if you liked `Survivors' then this will be one for you and it only scrapes 4 stars as I am feeling generous today having planted a half eaten apple and some gone off oranges to see what happens.",1336348800,2,3193,4.243421052631579
