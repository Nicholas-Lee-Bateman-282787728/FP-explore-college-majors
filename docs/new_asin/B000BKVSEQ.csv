2423107,4,B000BKVSEQ,"Beeper (2002) finds Harvey Keitel and cohort in India,  not unlike
Holy Smoke from 1999. This filming location is refreshing for the
audience, who is taken on a wild ride in New Delhi or Calcutta,
ranging from kidnappings, police, CIA and local embassy intrigue,
potential narco-trafficking and underworld dealings.

The 2 protagonists,  HK and Ed Quinn playing an American expatriate
underworld boss and visiting  R & D  scientist respectively, do
very well from representing opposite sides of the acting spectrum
(one explosive and impulsive, the other calm and reflective) while
Lauren Adams plays the high-level bombshell blonde manager with
possible links to the CIA in her embassy position, as is often the
case abroad.

The pace of the movie is both relaxing and upbeat, dramatic, with a
thriller combination, with the added bonus of special effects,
music and action scenes  that takes this movie head and shoulders
above  the majority of similar movies, demonstrating what talent,
professionalism, skill and intelligence can do when combined.

This is definitely a keeper, with replay value for the outdoor and
action scenes, exotic scenes for Euro or US audiences, centered in
India. Surprisingly good, although that is the standard by which HK's
movies are judged and expected, and original. 4.5 stars",1388188800,2,1312,5.299516908212561
2423108,1,B000BKVSEQ,"This one I got in the $1.99 bin, buy two get one for a penny.  Well, I guess it was worth a dollar-forty.  A typical kidnap genre that expected to show originality based on a setting in India falls short with a poor screenplay and some no-name actors that haven't graduated school.  But, Harvey Keitel (Wise Guys; Reservoir Dogs; Pulp Fiction) saves the movie from the trash bin with his typical outstanding acting and portrayal of Zolo.  (I betcha he ad-libbed a lot with what he was given.)  Zolo is a ruthless drug dealer that's been around the block.  Business is business and he ""can't afford to care"" about some tourist doctor's son kidnapped for no apparent reason.  But, Doctor Richard Avery (Ed Quinn) has his opium and the doctor won't give it up until Zolo helps him find the `beeper' that the kidnappers are using to relay info about Avery's son.  Zolo has no choice as the doctor is ready to give his own life rather than give up the dope.  So, off they go on a city wide hunt and chase looking for the beeper before midnight when the kidnapper claims he'll kill the boy.  Won't give away the ending, but I bet you'll figure out who the perp is before the end.  Worth a look if you don't have a lot to do and there are a couple beers iced ready to go. Or, go watch a re-run of Firewall, Man On Fire, Along Came a Spider.",1219795200,,1333,4.292
2423109,2,B000BKVSEQ,"BEEPER is the product of those films that deal with kidnapping of a child with the only connection with the perpetrators being by cell phone or other mechanical devices supposedly to enhance the tension of identifying the bad guy.  By now the story is so used and tired that it takes a spectacular gimmick to make it fly.  BEEPER remains grounded.

Dr. Richard Avery (Ed Quinn, known to only those who watch TV) flies to India with his young son (he is a widower) to give a lecture at a worldwide medical conference.  In the audience the son Sam (Stefan Djordjevic) disappears and the good doctor notices too late, beginning a long series of chases to find Sam. Avery encounters Sr. Inspector Vijay Kumar (Gulshan Grover), whose specialty is drug dealing problems, and Inspector Julia Hyde (Joey Lauren Adams), whose specialty is kidnapping. But Avery is informed that he is to follow instructions given through a beeper and to avoid the police.  Avery finds his only source of information is through Zolo (Harvey Keitel), a drug lord in Delhi who has special interests in fulfilling the ransom: cash for opium.  After an endless car chase through the streets and markets of Delhi the truth about who is the real kidnapper is revealed...and the movie glides to a bumpy end.

Seeing India as a backdrop for an intrigue film is promising but visually this viewer gets the feeling that much of the footage is actually from a can rather than being on set.  The acting ranges from fair to really awful and the script by Michael Cordell and Gregory Gieras is dreary. Made in 2002 and just released on DVD it is not a secret why the movie didn't make it in the theaters. Even the usually reliable Keitel can't save this one.

8088306,3,B000BKVSEQ,"Typical Bollywood, hundreds of continuity errors, so I blame the director and editor. The acting was not bad, but not good. The twist in the plot was good, but not believable. So if someone tells you they can see everything inside your hotel room, wouldn't check for hidden cameras? That was just dumb. The action scenes were fast, some good, but not believable. Harvey Keitel keeping up running with the main actor? Not hardly. I did like the tour of a metro India area, but too many dumb mistakes. One thing all travelers are warned about, do not give money to beggars, yet this guy does that, exposes his wallet when his only priority should be his son. This is India, so why would a ripped pocket be worth all the money he had on him plus his jacket? Why would his watch and wallet be worth a single phone call when he was answering, not making a call, just dumb. They do not charge for received calls in India. You have to be half blind not to see all the mistakes.",1507766400,,970,4.335164835164835
8088307,1,B000BKVSEQ,"I gave it 20 mins.  The quality of the playback was bad (too close up, bad color blotches which were distracting).  The acting was bad.  The storyline was going to be bad...I just know it!  I'm not going to waste any more time on this.",1493164800,,235,4.155555555555556
8088308,3,B000BKVSEQ,"I knew it was not a first run movie, but Harvey Keitel is always one to watch.  My problem was the on-screen formatting was terrible. I tried full screen, and other modes but nothing helped.  At times the tops of heads were cut off when in close quarters.  Also some CC was fine and other instances it was located about half off the bottom of the screen.  Picture quality certainly was poor as well.  I still watched it as the idea for the plot was interesting.",1492214400,,461,4.313953488372093

8088311,3,B000BKVSEQ,"A Bollywood film shot in metropolitan India. Odd plot-twisty story revolving around a kidnapped child (who is only seen in the beginning and end). It doesn't have any of the artistry usually associated with Harvey Keitel... It has an obligatory car chase and drugs and money-bag confusions tied together by the protagonist persistently trying to get his son back by trying to figure out who he might be able to trust. If you just want some Indian atmosphere for a change, it's OK if you lower your expectations a bit.",1490227200,,517,4.7555555555555555
