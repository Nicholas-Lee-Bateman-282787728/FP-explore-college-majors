8015188,1,B0001NBLSG,I am sorry I bought it. If the silly kitchen stuff was not in it it would be useful but as it is I cannot use it for my students.,1289433600,2,129,3.3333333333333335
8015189,5,B0001NBLSG,I have been looking for a dvd (to replace old worn-out VHS from Share the Music series) that showed all of the instruments in each family in a way that the students could hear each instrument and understand how it fits into each family.  This DVD is perfect and it also has great humor that the students love and could make 'connections' too!!!,1266883200,8,344,4.4603174603174605
8015190,1,B0001NBLSG,"I bought this for a grandchild who is showing interest in musical instruments.  I previewed it and thought it was just awful. Looking for another way to use it,  I took it to school and showed it to fifth grade students who are learning to write  reviews.  They gave it ""two thumbs down.""  One student asked ""Why do they think kids only like silly stuff?"" Another said, ""I could write better dialogue that that."" Well put.",1264032000,,422,4.5
8015191,5,B0001NBLSG,"This very reasonably priced dvd was a pleasant surprise.  I purchased this dvd to teacher about tone color/timbre and the instrument families of the orchestra.  When I previewed the dvd, I found each section to be informative and entertaining.  The dvd begins with a segment called ""Getting to Know the Instruments"", which is an overview of all 4 orchestral families.  The dvd also contains segments on ""The Woodwinds"", ""The Percussion"", ""The Brass"", ""The Keyboards"", and ""The Strings.""  Each segment is about 22 minutes.  In each segment, a humorous host explains how each family generates sound, the physical characteristics of the instruments in each family, and then has samples of multiple instruments from that family being played.  This is tied together with a plot line to make it more interesting (in one segment, the host is baking a cake for Grandma and has fond flashbacks of growing up with her that are quite funny; in another, the host is solving the Case of the Missing String).  The consultant on this video was the former MENC president, June Hinckley.  This dvd is appropriate for grades 2-6.",1186099200,38,1111,4.994565217391305
