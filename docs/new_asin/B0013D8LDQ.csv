3103133,5,B0013D8LDQ,"Great seller and GREAT DVD.  It makes me sad though, because I miss Tai Shan terribly.............His parents and his new sister are in DC and he is alone, in China, although in a very beautiful panda reserve.  Not much news about him has been put out since 2012, although we did see the un-eaten lovely birthday cake for him in 2013.  He has no camera, and last I read, he was in the hospital area, closed off to the public and to other pandas, because his old IBS acted up.  Is there a way to get him a web cam???  Can we get a volume 2 of Tai Shan's life????  This is a wonderful DVD.",1384905600,,587,4.060869565217391

3103136,5,B0013D8LDQ,"I don't write reviews as much as I should but this video is the best video we own for our son.  He is 2.5 yo and he loves this video he pretends he is one of the cuddly pandas and rolls around on the floor, too sweet! Better still is it accomplishes this cuddly euphoria with it's simple, unhurried images of Pandas playing and wrestling. I find that most videos try to overwhelm kids with a barrage of fast cut imagery that may incapacitate them for a needed rest but I feel it is disturbing and at the very least raises the bar for what tv/video time should be.

The Panda video is simple and not very polished but I find this to be just fine.",1318377600,9,645,4.111111111111111
3103137,5,B0013D8LDQ,"I've watched 3 DVDs about Panda. One of them is titled ""The amazing Panda adventure"". It has a couple of scenes where the Panda are obviously fake.
I've forgotten the title of the second DVD but it's about pandas raised in a preserve in China. It's good in terms of knowledge but I'm not attached to it.

This DVD is completely different. It's both educational and emotionally exciting.
It shows the anxiety, and suspense of the people who tried to help Mei Xiang, a female panda to get pregnant. They were sad when their effort failed. They were joyful when she gave birth the next year. The film shows how fragile the baby panda was. He weighed only 4 ounces at birth. It's the size of the stick of butter! Then within 1 year, he grew to 56 pounds. It's touching to see how his mother loved and nurtured him. It's lovely to see him play by himself.

In short, it's the BEST documentary on Panda I've ever seen. Everybody who loves pandas should have one copy.",1290211200,4,961,4.423728813559322
3103138,4,B0013D8LDQ,"Originally broadcast on cable's Animal Planet channel, these two 40-minute features tell the story of Tai Shan, the first panda cub to survive birth in captivity at the Smithsonian National Zoo, in Washington, DC.

The offspring of two pandas on loan from China, Tai Shan is utterly adorable (as all giant pandas seem to be...) The first featurette tells the story of how his parents, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were brought to America, and the long, 5-year process involved in getting them to breed.  In this relatively frank presentation, the panda caretakers are as much characters in the drama as the bears themselves, and you may develop the same sort of affection for them as well, watching them get old along with the animals, and share their disappointments and joys.

The second chapter happily shows Tai Shan's growth and adventures in his first year of life, and the giddy reception he got as a major draw to the National Zoo. Crowds of happy zoo-goers flock to see him and delight in each step of his development.  One sad note that the filmmakers could not foresee is that the Wolong wildlife preserve in China, where Tai Shan's parents are from, was leveled by the May, 2008 earthquake, as were several dozen other panda research centers. As of the time of this review, the pandas appear to be safe, although several escaped and the Wolong facility  is in ruins, but is apparently still functioning. This documentary will give you a taste for the urgency (and joy) involved in panda nature conservancy efforts. (ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1211500800,10,1562,4.879245283018868

8249896,5,B0013D8LDQ,What a great ride this was. I remember the events leading up to the birth and how it captured the imagination of the surrounding area and nation-wide. Panda have that lasting effect on people. This was a great story to tell by from the inside which helped to make it that much more appealing. A can't miss video,1503878400,,311,4.379310344827586
8249897,5,B0013D8LDQ,Wonderful story! An excellent documentary with lots of adorable footage of baby panda. I have watched it 3 times and already bought an additional one for my daughter.,1494979200,,166,4.964285714285714
8249898,5,B0013D8LDQ,"This was(IS) an adorable documentary of a Panda bear couple and the high hopes the zoo (in DC) had of mating them to produce a baby. It is very interesting to watch a couple of adorable adult bears (male and female) interact, and ultimately, for the female to produce a baby (with medical intervention).  OMG, puppies and pandas must be the cutest babies in the world! They are so precious, and I think, they just bring out the loving, joyyful preciousness in us humans!  Anyway, this follows the Pandas all the way to the immaturity of the baby, and shows us the care & protectiveness of the mother (and staff!) with some astonishing, and some hilarious behaviors! Also we are shown the behavioral training the humans do on the Pandas. A must see that won't disappoint!",1488499200,,770,4.654411764705882

8249902,5,B0013D8LDQ,"Instant favorite for my 3 year old. It's presented in an educational and fun way. The voices and background music are a great balance and not too loud, which is important for my child. It's calming to watch. Lots of footage of the pandas plus some other animals in the zoo. It also teaches how we should respect and help protect animals. So glad I ordered it.",1436313600,,359,4.373134328358209
