7909414,2,B00000I1ZB,"'Naughty Nights' is two late 80s/early 90s racy comedies bundled together  in a single package. The movies are 'H.O.T.S.' and 'Sex and the Single  Alien.' Neither film is particularly brilliant. The Two-Star Rating on this  review is an average of what I'm giving the films.
'H.O.T.S.' is sort of  a girl version of 'Revenge of the Nerds,' with plenty of gratuitous bare  breasts thrown in. It focuses on a group of college women who, after being  rejected by the snooty sororities on the Franklin University campus  (abbreviated F.U., of course), start their own sorority. The film features  all the standard elements of this sort of 'college hi-jinx' story, although  its resolution goes (sinks?) to rediculous new levels when the H.O.T.S.  girls have to play the Pi sorority (their arch-enemies) in a game of strip  football... a game refereed by the school's dean who earlier in the film  was admonishing the H.O.T.S. members to maintain high moral standards.  Saddled with an uninventive storyline, tired jokes, bad actors, and a  script that meanders from bad to worse, this is the very image of a bad  B-movie. One Star.
'Sex and the Single Alien' is about Harry, a man who  co-owns the strip club Family Values with his wife. Harry's wife is  obssessed with UFOs to the point where she will rather read about them than  have sex with him. Harry starts contemplating having an affair, something  which his best friend, who runs a hot air balloon rental company, and a new  dancer at the club are more than happy to facilitate. Using a black hot air  balloon and some spotlights, the friend helps Harry leave his home by  making it seem like he's been abducted by aliens. The wife buys it hook,  line, and sinker... even refusing to believe that Harry's having an affair  when he confesses to her. The plan is a good one... until Harry REALLY gets  abducted by aliens. Far, far better then H.O.T.S, genuinely funny at times,  and featuring a lead character who's pretty likable, 'Sex and the Single  Alien' may not be a masterpiece but it's a nice late-night cable kind of  comedy. (It too features gratuitous breast-shots... but at least they're  where they belong: In the Family Values strip club.) Three Stars.
For  $10, these two movies are a pretty good deal. H.O.T.S. isn't so bad so as  to be diagreeable--it's just lame--and 'Sex and the Single Alien' has some  very nice moments in it.",968371200,,2400,4.792176039119805
