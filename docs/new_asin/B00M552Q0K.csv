8670335,5,B00M552Q0K,"Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himself

For some reason, music stores and concert programs file British composer Michael Nyman under Classical Music. I find this interesting because thats not really what Nymans music is about. First off, he is most well-known for the film score for The Piano and wrote film scores for some Peter Greenaway films. (So, is John Williams a classical composer?

Next is the fact that most recordings of his music are by the Michael Nyman BAND (not Michael Nyman Orchestra!). And look at the instruments he uses: French horn, electric guitar, drum, and only two or three string players.  And most of his pieces are short, lasting from two to 5 minutes.  Yes he does write repetitive rhythms like Phillip Glass but Nymans work is fast and he borrows tunes to insert in his pieces. While I like Phillip Glass and John Adams, I LOVE Nymans work.

This wonderful Bluray disc contains the 2009 concert held in the German label Arthauss intimate concert hall. The occasion was the premiere of Nymans tribute to the work of Handel: I piece titled Musicologist Scorse. At 21:31 it is the only one of the 16 pieces in this 89 minute concert. The others are some of Nymans hits (but not The Piano and a few that are new (or were in 2010). The camera work is superb!  As a bonus  for those not familiar with the composer  is a 52-minute film Michael Nyman  Composer in Progress from 2009. This film has been available on another DVD from Arthaus, but its nice to have it here as a bonus.

If you are a Nyman fan like me, youll want to see this BD. If you are new to Nyman and have a short attention span to instrumental works, this is a great start since you can watch the portrait first and then the concert.
The BD comes with a 20-page booklet of photos and an essay in English, French and German.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
