I love independent films in general, but most of them reach an expectation of what independent films should be and dare not venture out beyond that point. Yeardley breaks from this ilk. The filmmakers set you up for what appears to be standard indie film fare, but then they turn it on its head and you realize you're in new and unfamiliar territory. I won't give anything away here, because the ending is certainly unexpected and that's all I'll say about that.

It's refreshing to see an indie film willing to take on otherwise taboo subject matter surrounding divorce and custody battles, and do so in a way that doesn't pander to one side. It's willing to be honest and present everyone in a way that's demonstrative of each character's own personal flaws and mistakes. There are no real good guys in this film - and certainly no martyrs for a cause. And I love that.

My only critique about the DVD is there's no commentary. I really wish I could hear more from the filmmakers about the various choices they made along the way, but that's a small gripe. Do yourself a favor and add this to your collection. You'll want to revisit it from time to time. I promise.",1324425600,,1239,4.4734513274336285
8490192,5,B00608JEOY,"Jeff Yeardley is a flawed man, but his flaws make him come across as quite real - uncomfortably real, in some instances.  His choices turn his life into a downward spiral, especially when one more bad choice leads him into a liaison that was much more than he bargained for.  It's easy to sit back and say, ""I wouldn't have made his mistakes,"" but we all know that the straight and narrow is an ideal, often difficult to make into reality.  If temptation were easy to resist, then it wouldn't be temptation, would it?

Things fall apart. Sometimes it's our fault; other times it's not.  For Yeardly, it's definitely both.  Jesse Bernstein's top notch performance make his emotions, especially his despair, quite palpable.  Saskia Grace Holmes also fills her role well as his estranged wife.  This is director Heath Michaels first film.  Let's hope it's not his last.",1321574400,4,866,4.797297297297297
