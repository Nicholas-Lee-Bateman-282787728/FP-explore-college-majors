8610831,3,B00000IBW5,"The plot of the story is, of course, Winston's learning to use the potty chair.  (There is a girl named Molly, but the emphasis is on Winston.)  In the story, unlike real life (lol), Winston asks his mommy how long he will have to use diapers.  Mom smiles and assures him that he will be free of them soon.

Mom and Dad then surprise him with a potty chair.  At first, Winston has no idea what it is and his imagination goes wild.  He imagines the chair taking him to all sorts of exotic places, engaging in all sorts of adventures.  He even wears the potty on his head for awhile, before Dad corrects him and shows him how to use the potty properly.  All throughout the story, `being a big kid' is emphasized, which might be motivational for some children.

I got this video from the library, along with two others.  None of them worked with our recalcitrant 3 year old.  (Oh well-just a question of time I suppose (LOL))

Three Stars.  The tape is a little short and didn't work for us.  Still, I think you need to read all the reviews to see if you think it would work for you. Certainly other reviewers claim it worked for them.

Also, other reviewers have noted that the production quality is not overly professional, but from what I gather from my children that's not really a drawback.  Children are just not that critical.",1129248000,2,1330,4.389344262295082
8610832,1,B00000IBW5,"I was so disappointed in this video.  You should know it's underwritten by Huggies Training Pants--they only tell you about the AMA part.  The advice from the doctors is the same as you will find anywhere.  The video is short, doesn't go through any of the steps of actually using the potty, and the animation nothing to rave about.  I purchased one book and one video for my son for potty training, and wish I had gotten a different video for sure!",977184000,36,449,4.439024390243903
8610833,5,B00000IBW5,"This video is the best tool I have seen for use in potty training.  After watching this video, my son went from totally not interested in potty training to using the potty happily in one week's time.  The video is very  well done--captivating enough to catch their attention, and fun enough  where they want to watch it over and over again.",945648000,41,340,4.524590163934426
