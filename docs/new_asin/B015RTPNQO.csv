8734386,5,B015RTPNQO,A good overview of Callas' singing in good sound quality. The Paris DVS has a nice introduction to the opera of Paris. As these are old films one can not expect top picture quality.,1517356800,,181,4.352941176470588
8734387,2,B015RTPNQO,"According to the reviews I've read, these are not remastered to Blu Ray audio sound quality.  It's the old stuff with a bit of visual sprucing up but not where it really counts, the audio.  Callas's voice has been cropped on prior regular CDs.  The DSD remaster did wonders.  Even better are the Japanese SACDs - more of her voice is there.  Much of the harshness is gone (although there there is still plenty there.)  If as close to live as possible is the goal, as it is for me, this doesn't cut it.",1503878400,3,501,4.276595744680851
8734388,5,B015RTPNQO,"An incredible talent, that could literally capture an audience with her ability to take operatic arias and sing and ""project"" this music with her multi octave voice of soprano, mezzo-soprano and alto-soprano. If Tulio Serafin was conducting the orchestra, this was an added plus, because he knew her voice so well, and could integrate a full symphony orchestra, with her voice, to enhance the the music she was singing.",1502150400,,419,5.086956521739131
