8343846,5,B001UIH6EE,"Very amusing, late 30's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing) comedy-mystery.  A mystery writer's doctor, feeling his patient is nearing a nervous breakdown from his profession, wants him to go to a rest home to recuperate (actually a sanitarium).  Sooo, the writer and his employee head for this place but end up at the mansion next door.  What they don't realize is that a bunch of people are gathered together there to outdo each other out of a large inheritance and have mistaken the writer for the principal heir.  The mansion is full of weird acting people, offbeat servants, and even a room full of stuffed wild beasts.  What no home should be without, a creepy natural history museum.  Lots of fun and very like English language films of that era of the same genre.  The DVD is very good quality.  Highly recommended.",1428796800,2,831,4.843971631205674
