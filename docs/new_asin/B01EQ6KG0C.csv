8759392,1,B01EQ6KG0C,"I purchased this DVD because my 1-year old granddaughter loves Masha and the Bear cartoons. I had read that the quality wasn't great, but was willing to take a chance. However, the DVD does not play at all. I've tried it on several DVD players, all of which are in perfect working condition. So, I definitely do not recommend this DVD to anyone.",1502668800,,345,4.492063492063492
8759393,5,B01EQ6KG0C,I like it. I have been studying Russian for several years and looking for Russian language films. I have watched much of it and have encountered no problems with it.,1496016000,,165,4.533333333333333
8759394,2,B01EQ6KG0C,"Kids love these cartoons and were watching them on the official youtube channel. We bought this disk to have cartoons with us when traveling and to avoid excessive ads youtube channel lately has.

This said, the quality of the disk is seriously lacking. Most of the episodes are slightly cut at the beginning or the end (or both). The sound disappears for few seconds every few episodes. Series are not recorded sequentially on the disk, so player keeps seeking the right spot on the disk between episodes.

Bottom line is, this are the great cartoons, but I would suggest looking for some other recording to buy them.",1494288000,,618,4.766355140186916
