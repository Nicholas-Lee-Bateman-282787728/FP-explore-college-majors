8432795,5,B004KDO2NO,"This stark production serves Strauss' shattering music wonderfully and maintains the grim atmosphere of Sophocles' play with its stark,vaguely early 20th century costumes and prison-like set. Waltraud Meir shines as Clytemnestra along with Ren Pape in his brief role as Orestes. Multiple viewings have not diminished its power to move and disturb. Westbroek and Theorin perform admirably.",1356220800,,388,5.824561403508772
8432796,5,B004KDO2NO,"I recently purchased a copy of Strauss' Elektra (at Target for much less than Amazon). This is from the 2010 Salzburg Festival with Irne Theorin in the title role with support from Waltraud Meier as Klytmnestra (wait `til you see what happens to her at the end), Eva-Maria Westbroek as Chrysothemis, and the great Ren Pape as Orest. Daniele Gatti conducts the Weiner Philharmoniker and the stage direction is by Nikolaus Lehnoff who created a very successful production of Parsifal a few years ago.

So I popped it in very late the other night just to check the audio and video quality. I figured I'd watch for five minutes, tops. Well, Elektra had me at Allein! (Alone!). Her opening line that invokes her murdered father, coupled with her phantom presence, was so compelling I had to stick around just to find out what dark corner of the universe this girl was emerging from and how far her obsession would take her. I watched the whole thing straight through.

If you know the story of Elektra from Greek Tragedy, well, opera doesn't get any more tragic than this. Once the story takes hold of you, look out. But what music Strauss composed! - at times dissonant and unworldly, at other times sublimely beautiful, almost poetic. How the lyrical climax in the recognition scene can be filled with such emotional intensity, and still manage to strike a chord of tenderness is a tribute to Strauss' gift of composition.

An opera like this, in the hands of anything less than a stellar cast and orchestra, would be a disaster. Fortunately a world-class ensemble was put together to meet the challenge of Strauss' masterpiece. The result is a harrowing performance of sheer psychological terror and existentialism. Elektra is one of the most demanding roles in the dramatic soprano repertoire, perhaps on par only with Brnnhilde in Gtterdmmerung. But where Wagner allows many a moment of quiet repose, Strauss drives the intensity to white-hot levels that never let up. Irne Theorin delivers a fervent performance with remarkable vocal range. Her high notes are well executed and her voice is always under control, never straining.

The supporting cast is equally strong. Waltraud Meier, the great Wagnerian soprano, delivers a definitive performance as Elektra's mother who is defiant in the face of her nightmarish visions of a fate waiting to strike. (If you like her here, it would be well worth checking out her portrayal of Ortrud in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Lohengrin-Blu-ray/dp/B001U5V04E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Lohengrin [Blu-ray</a>].) Eva-Maria Westbroek, one of the emerging talents of the international stage and who has rightfully claimed ownership of the Walkre Sieglinde, is more than good enough (although slightly miscast) as Elektra's gentle unassuming sister who longs to escape her misery and live a normal life. Ren Pape plays the relatively small basso part of Elektra's exiled brother who returns for vengeance with efficiency and understatement. He stays within the role and lets his voice perform naturally.

The audio and video in this Blu-ray from Arthaus Musik is excellent. The dts surround track is spacious and full-bodied; the video clear and well framed. Conductor Gatti gives a confident reading of Strauss and the orchestra responds well to the dramatic highs as well as the subtle nuances in the score. Lehnhoff's production, much like with Parsifal, is on the mark. He shows Elektra as an atrophy of human emotion and self-abandonment. She appears as the undead behind a horrific mask of self-destruction. The everything-gray stage of distorted angles and empty holes is seen as a reflection of her psychosis. If you're up for it, this Elektra really delivers.",1313107200,4,3766,5.249169435215947
8432797,4,B004KDO2NO,"The 2010 production of Elektra for the Salzburg Festspiele is an impressive production, Nikolaus Lehnhoff's staging as intense and claustrophobic as a staging of Strauss' opera ought to be.  In addition, this production also benefits from a superlative cast including Irne Theorin, Waltraud Meier, Eva-Maria Westbroek and Ren Pape, with Daniele Gatti conducting the Wiener Philharmoniker.  It doesn't come much better than this and it does live up to expectations ...unless you already have a strong preference for another production.

Unsurprisingly, for a director like Lehnhoff working with such an opera, the stage setting is a reflection of the internal torment of Elektra, fixated as she is on the death of her father Agamemnon and the desire for vengeance against his murderers, her mother Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus.  She's waiting on her brother Orestes to exact that vengeance for her, but, hearing of his death from her sister Chrysothemis, she prepares to carry out the foul deed herself.  Lehnhoff envisages the tempestuous fluctuations of Elektra's state of mind as a grey barren landscape, undulating and tilted, full of fractures and chasms from which horrors torment her and into which she is about to drop into at any moment.  It's reminiscent of his 1999 stage setting for Wagner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parsifal/dp/B003BFUS8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parsifal</a>, forcing one to draw interesting comparisons between Wagner's score for that opera and Strauss', the themes being similar in respect of Elektra in an eternal state of suffering and torment seeking release or purification.

If the stage setting is highly effective in this respect, its impact is somewhat lessened by the lack of wide-shots to take in the whole stage, the filming for television focussing for the most part on close-ups of Irne Theorin's fixed mask of madness, which is powerful, but limiting and not quite so effective as what is evoked by the stage set as a whole, and by her position alongside the other characters within that space, since Lehnhoff is very considered about the movement and placement of characters in relation to one another.  Fortunately, there is much more expressed in this opera through the score and the singing than through the acting, and here Theorin is terrific, cutting an imposing figure vocally and through her physical presence that dictates the whole tone of the piece.  Elektra is a notoriously difficult role for a singer, Theorin having to sing pretty much for an hour and a half without break in the one-act opera, and she rises to the challenge, seeming to grow in strength and intensity right up to the devastating conclusion.

The other singers likewise live up to expectations.  Ren Pape, as you would expect is a strong Orestes, even if he lacks the necessary dramatic qualities here.  Westbroek sometimes seems to be danger of going a little shrill and harsh, but shows nevertheless fine control and manages to remain a lyrical Chrysothemis, contrasting well with Theorin's Elektra.  Theorin is also well-pitted against Waltraud Meier, but sparks don't fly as they might between Elektra and Clytemnestra, the production here finding a sense of deep mutual like-mother-like-daughter recognition in the two figures, both in the nature of their own internal conflict and in the depths that they are prepared to sink to.  It's an interesting variation on the mythological relationship, but it doesn't capture the fullest extent of the conflict within of their relationship that is a little more ""complex"" (sorry!) and expressed with greater precision in the discordance of Richard Strauss' score.

Although it's hard to justify a preference for Linda Watson and Jane Henschel over Theorin and Meier, Watson's acting in particular being limited to the adoption of a haughty expression that is no match whatsoever for the brooding anguish of Theorin's interpretation, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baden-Baden-2010/dp/B0046HCOO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baden-Baden 2010</a>&nbsp;production is sung and played terrifically well with a striking staging, and I feel that Christian Thielemann's much more adventurous conducting brings out the dynamism in the opera and an edge that is missing here.  That's a personal preference however, just as others might equally prefer the Karl Bhm version, since otherwise there's little to fault about the performances, staging or conducting of this fine production.

Other than the predominance of close-ups, there's little to fault with its presentation on Blu-ray either, the opera looking and sounding terrific in High Definition.  Audience applause at the start and bows at the end have been eliminated, and I rather liked the dramatic integrity this gave the opera.  Subtitles are in English, French, Spanish and Italian, but no German.  Other than trailers for other releases, there are no extra features and only a brief essay and a synopsis in the booklet.",1304985600,8,5055,5.53177691309987
8432798,4,B004KDO2NO,"The very first Elektra in 1903 was a sultry young Gertud Eysoldt who looked the part of a tormented teenager. Most performances of the opera on CD did not need to pay attention to appearances and brought in great singers with generally Wagnerian proprtions. Sadlt this carried over to DVD, but the arrival of Blu-ray should really bring about some change. The singing on this disc is excellent as is the orchestral playing and the picture quality but I have some reservations over the casting. Irne Theorin sings and acts magnificently with a murderous intent, somewhat in the style of Birgit Nilsson in her last recorded performance, but she looks more like her mother's mother than her daughter! Orest appears as an equally murderous hit man and all in all one feels rather sorry for Klytmnestra who is presented completely differently to the evil, and never to be forgotten, performance of Astrid Varnay in the Bhm recording. I was initially a bit disappointed at this reversal but my view changed as the opera progressed. It is a valid viewpoint and it works. The sets are very basic, set in the courtyard of an unfinished prison as far as I could make out but this is rarely an issue with Elektra. The costumes are mostly era-free modern except for Aegisth who was dressed like a pimp returning from his collection run and the chief overseer and a male servant who were done up like bikey gang members. All a bit odd but better than dinner suits or pajamas that appear all too often. Thank God we are spared Elektra's dance and the ending is quite horrific and without doubt the best I have ever seen. I will not spoil it by saying more. This is a very different production and well worth seeing.",1300147200,9,1701,4.635761589403973
