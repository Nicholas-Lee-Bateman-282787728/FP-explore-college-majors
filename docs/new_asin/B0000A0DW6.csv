7994989,1,B0000A0DW6,"This flick is totally dreadful.  Real kung fu fans will not tolerate this garbage. Although it had a decent plot, every fighting scene appeared as if they were sparring with eachother.  The flick is not on the level of The Three Evils, The Green Jade Statuette, or The Mystery of Chess Boxing.  The fighting was lame - the kicks were lame.  A novice would love this one, but to a seasoned Kung Fu fan, this one is totally wack to say the least.

Please don't waste your money on this one.  If you want to spend wisely, go with many from Shaw Brothers - (Masked Avengers, The Spearman, etc.). Please see my other reviews so you don't get stuck with worthless kung fu flicks that aren't worth the disc it was copied to.",1178236800,2,717,4.353383458646617
7994990,4,B0000A0DW6,"After a cricket match (no, not of the British kind: this is a fight between two crickets with guys betting on the winner) gives rise to a brawl, Fong Sai Yuk, depicted by Meng Fei, inadvertantly kills the young student of two local masters.  In retaliation, the two masters (one is great with his fists, the other with his feet) pay a visit to Sai Yuk's house.  Meanwhile Fong happens to be out with his friends getting into martial arts mischief.  With Fong's dad killed and his mom beaten in the ensuing mayhem, I needn't tell you that the film falls into the classic revenge plot.  In the process Sai Yuk is trained by his mom to avenge the death of his father and to rid the town of the two masters' tyranny.  This all leads to a final showdown that is well worth the price of admission for this movie, in which Sai Yuk squares off against the two masters and their sinister father.

The Diamond Entertainment transfer is decent, and I enjoyed the film itself, with its typical revenge plot and training sequences, together with some enjoyable vestiges of comic and romantic relief.  Meng Fei, as Fong Sai Yuk, does come across as rather arrogant and perhaps too care-free in light of the grave misdeed for which his character is responsible, though (admittedly, he did commit manslaughter at the outset of the story.)  I suppose the loss of his father compensates, in some way, for Fong's general lack of conscience for his senseless violence.

For the street price of about $3-$4, you can do a lot worse in the search for decent kung fu films.  4 stars (****).",1124236800,,1566,4.560714285714286
