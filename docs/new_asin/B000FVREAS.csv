Seems as if it was rushed to be put together without a lot of planning.
If you have the time and money and you are a beginner or approaching an intermediate level this maybe something to consider.. or not..",1303603200,,447,4.209302325581396
8127456,1,B000FVREAS,"If you're looking to improve your doubles game, you aren't going to find much help in this very disappointing DVD and there are probably a slew of better options available to spend your money on. While I'll stop just short of calling this a complete rip off, there was actually very little information on the game of doubles and the bulk of the time that could have been spent discussing strategy was instead used in interviews similar to what you could see any time (and for free) on cable's Tennis Channel. The motivation behind developing this product escapes me. Surely money isn't a major concern to Jimmy Connors? Maybe he just wants to impress people with his ability to draw people like the Bryan's and John Lloyd into his program? There were a few minutes where the Bryan brothers did play a bit and offered a few tips, but other than that it was a total zero. I thought about checking out the other Connors ""Fundamental"" DVD's but this one put me off to the whole series. As anyone who has shopped this genre knows, there are a lot of bad tennis instruction video's and DVD's out there. I found it surprising and unfortunate that Connors only added to that particular pile.",1186272000,9,1183,4.584905660377358
