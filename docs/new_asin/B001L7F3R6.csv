8317493,5,B001L7F3R6,This is a great instructional DVD by a bestselling author in a workshop setting. He discusses the creative mindset of writing fiction and also provides the processes to help you organize and begin your writing project. Excellent resource for writers trying to learn story structure. Well worth the small investment in cost! I wish he had more DVDs available.,1382918400,3,358,5.084745762711864
8317494,5,B001L7F3R6,"The version of this that I consumed was a DVD.  It was the best education I could ever ask for on becoming an author. It also spurred me to take William Bernhardt's in person workshop, when he presented it in  Hawaii. Not only is Berhardt a wonderful writer with great breadth and depth, but  he is also a fantastic teacher. I encourage anyone interested in writing to get this DVD, watch it once, watch it again (to take notes), and watch it again to pick up everything you missed the first two times.",1381708800,,502,4.376344086021505
