8221854,3,B000W92B06,"This review is for the standard DVD edition of Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter released by Synergy Entertainment in September, 2007.

This movie was made in 1966 and is a low budget movie from that time period. Strictly for fans of old 'B' sci-fi fans.
This movie has been in the public domain for quite some time an there are other versions available.
Synergy Entertainment generally puts out somewhat respectable prints though by no means top notch stuff.

I purchased this for $9.99 at the beginning of 2016. As of the time of this review in April, 2017 the price was still the same.

DVD: The movie is in color and the print on this DVD is in decent shape. It is better than average for a release of this type (No extra's, menu's or subtitles). Often in movies of this type (low budget, public domain) you get very poor prints that can be fuzzy, out of focus or worse. This one is OK. It is not super clear but there are not a lot of imperfections. The picture is steady and there are very few problems likes spots and lines and hairs, etc. If your expectations are low then you should not be disappointed with this one. It's good enough so that you don't feel like you wasted your money. This often happens with some of the really terrible prints provided by Alpha Video and other's of its kind. Of course Alpha's DVD's are usually very cheap in terms of price.

EXTRA'S: None whatsoever. Put the DVD in and it starts playing. No menu's, no scene selections, no subtitles(interestingly enough when I press the subtitle button it says on as if they are there but nothing show up on my screen.) For what it's worth there are 17 chapter stops.

PLOT/SUMMARY: Jesse James, his gang devastated after a robbery attempt, shows up in a southwestern town with one of his men, a rather large guy called Hank. He is there to meet the last of the so called ""Wild Bunch."" There are 3 of them left including the traitorous, Lonny. They decide to plot to rob a stagecoach. Lonny wants to collect the $10,000 reward for Jesse James and goes to the sheriff so they can plot to lead them into an ambush. The ambush succeeds and the last two of the Wild Bunch are killed by Jesse escapes with a badly injured Hank.  Jesse meets Juanita and her parents while running away. Juanita's family has left there town due to unusual things going on. Juanita lies to her parents and helps Jesse and Hank. She wants to bring them to the doctor in town who is....
Maria Frankenstein, granddaughter of the famous Dr. Frankenstein, and her brother Rudolph are experimenting with children in a southwestern town in the United States. They left Europe with her grandfather's notes and equipment. Because of them the townspeople have all left. She is trying to make slaves out of immigrants. Rudolph,also a doctor, is against this and sabotages her experiments without her knowing. For some reason Maria believes that they need a large person to continue her experiments. Her wishes come true when Jesse brings Hank to her home. She tells Jesse that she will make Hank better.
Both Maria and Juanita have fallen in love with Jesse. Jesse rejects Maria's advances and she plots to have him arrested. She sends him to town for prescriptions for Hank but leaves a note telling the pharmacist that the notorious Jesse James is standing before him. He goes to get the sheriff. He finds the treacherous Lonny there. Lonny decides to go for the reward but ends up getting himself killed chasing after Jesse.
The experiment with Hank has succeeded. She has inserted an artificial brain and renames Hank, Igor. Maria catches Rudolph trying to poison Igor and has Igor kill Rudolph. Jesse returns to the Frankenstein home and is taken prisoner. Juanita goes to the sheriff and they both go to get Jesse and stop Maria.

Will Jesse escape? Will Juanita and the sheriff get there in time? What will become of Maria Frankenstein? What will happen to Hank? You will have to watch to find out......

THOUGHTS/PRODUCTION:  The title of the movie is not accurate. I'm not sure if it was deliberately deceiving but Jesse James meets Frankenstein's ""Granddaughter"".....not the 'daughter' in the title.

Most of the actors in this movie were veteran actors of some note. Several had appeared in many westerns and television show. John Lupton was best known for a television series in the 50's called 'Broken Arrow.'
Cal Bolder (Hank/Igor) was given his name by the same guy who gave Rock Hudson his stage name. Though obviously his career didn't go the same way!
The acting for the most part was not good despite having veteran actors. John Lupton was not even a remotely convincing Jesse James. Narda Onyx as Maria Frankenstein was just too over the top. She looked like she was trying too hard.

The old west or in this case the southwest isn't exactly known for it's raging thunderstorm's! Frankenstein's daughter must have done a lot of sitting around and waiting.
Frankenstein was making artificial brains? I'm not sure where these artificial brains from but hey it's a 'B' movie. According to Maria, her grandfather was making artificial brains. I never read the book or saw a movie in which this occurs so I suspended disbelief and just went with it.

The producers of the movie weren't all that much interested in getting their historical fact's correct. Of course Jesse could have just been lying.

I'm not sure how Hank could still be in love with Juanita after his brain has been exchanged.

Estelita Rodriguez, the woman who plays 'Juanita' had passed away by the time the movie was released. The month prior she had been found dead a the age of 37 in her kitchen. Before that, the Cuban actress had been in many westerns.

Overall, I'd have to say they made an attempt at making a decent movie. It didn't necessarily work but I've seen much worse many times before.

RECOMMENDATIONS: If you really want to own this movie then this is as good as it gets at this time. You can see the movie for free on YouTube if you don't feel like purchasing it or if you haven't decided if you want to add it to your film library.

If you were born later than 1980 you will probably not want to watch this unless you are a fan of old 'B' movies. This one is for the older generations or for fans of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.

I'm giving the print a 6/10 or 3 stars. Keep in mind that this is in comparison to releases of this type and for the price(budget in the public domain), not a regular release. If I were comparing it to a regular release my rating would be much lower.
I'm giving the movie 4/10 or 2 stars. It has a few things going for it but it's not terribly interesting. Obviously a zero rating for extra's.
Overall I'm giving it 2 1/2 stars but rounding it up to 3 stars just because Synergy Ent. at least attempted to put out a decent print.

In light of the fact that there probably aren't any better versions available at this time then this is a respectable value at $9.99. It's not a cheap price nor is it expensive. It's priced about right. If something better comes along then it will need to be priced more like an Alpha Video release at around 5 or 6 dollars. But as of this time I doubt there is anything in the works. So this is as good as it gets.",1492905600,,7233,4.54147465437788
