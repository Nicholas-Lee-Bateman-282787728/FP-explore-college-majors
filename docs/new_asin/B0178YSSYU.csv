7498013,5,B0178YSSYU,Great!,1461110400,,6,6.0
7498014,5,B0178YSSYU,I really like this video. I believe it to be informative and does make you think about your food choices.,1461024000,,105,4.3
7498015,5,B0178YSSYU,"Common sense.  Not militant.  Great historical perspective on the food wars, with a simple common sense strategy that makes sense.",1451865600,3,130,5.45
7498016,5,B0178YSSYU,"I saw this when it aired on TV recently.
Very impressed with the message, and manner in which it's delivered.
This is something I'd recommend everyone watch at least once, and would highly recommend for teachers to utilize as a tool for teaching about nutrition.
Haven't most of us watched at least one loved one die from eating ""Edible Food-Like Substances""?
I know I have, and don't want my kids and grandkids to make the same mistakes.",1451606400,5,438,4.701298701298701
7498017,5,B0178YSSYU,"Michael Pollan's message.

It is not pompous. It is not communist. It is not what
people already know. What we see in our country almost
universally now is an attack on reason, and attack on
positivity, somehow for the average working or middle
class person the marketing tool of associating bad behavior
with freedom and then over-exulting freedom over everything
else.

Our PR/advertising industry and our industrial focus on
life has killed or made miserable millions of people. The
idea that science and technology and products are somehow
all the same, and that the externalized effects can just
be ignored because at some point in the future, we'll get
it right. Yeah, after our health is ruined, and our money
in the hands of the people who ruined it.

Look at our entertainment industry. The Right wing
corporatists rail against government media, PBS, but ""In
Defense Of Food"" is one of the best things I've seen on
TV ... and I would not see anything like it on broadcast
TV. Night after night on broadcast TV I keep seeing murder
and crime one after the other. Ridiculous game shows,
many of them from 40 years ago.

Our news has become the same way. Useless, junkified, and
as Pollan points out here, it is also so with our food.
The food that keeps us alive eventually kills us, and
keeps us apart, maybe even predisposed to violence or
mental illness. It makes learning and growing up more
difficult for children, and yet, because it makes certain
people money, we have it forced on us at high cost, so
that we can then force it on other countries.

It is the same thing with health care. Every other developed
rich country in the world has national universal health
case, and yet somehow because the US is militarily dominant,
we are right to deny our citizens health care.

AND WHY? Because if the taxpayers and corporations of
this country had to actually pay for all the damage the
food industry, tobacco industry and junk food industry
did, whoops, there goes all that money.

""In Defense of Food"" makes a great point about how ""we""
... whoever that is, allow the food industry to manipulate
us. We are exposed to their brainwashing commercials from
the time we are babies. We are victims to their neurological
testing about what flavors and textures light up our
brains like drugs. We are tricked into buying things laid
out by experts in the supermarkets so we will load up on
all the most profitable stuff first and not have room in
our carts, baskets or plates. Yet, somehow when the
government tries to reverse or counter that as in the
soda tax or limits on soft drink size ... it is communism
or unAmerican.

Associating American with being stupid and suicidal and
sick? Think about it. It starts there, thinking about it,
and ""In Defense of Food"" is food for thought, and it is
just a start, because you can apply this same thinking
to just about all of our industries and our economy and
answer why we seem to have so many problems today.

""In Defense Of Food"" Very well done ... 5/5 .... see it,
see it again, think about it.",1451606400,12,3053,4.587155963302752
7498018,3,B0178YSSYU,"I wanted to love this movie. I really did. And I was really impressed with the cinematography. So why three stars?

The message was pretty simple, avoid processed foods, eat meat in great moderation if at all, and don't eat too much.

IMO the great failure is in not addressing the topic of food quality. And without addressing that topic, the rest falls flat.

He seems to be trying to work mostly within the structure of conventional supermarkets that sell old produce bred for everything but flavor and nutrition, from thousands of miles away, and in doing so, renders his message largely ineffective.

How can tasteless, lifeless, old produce compare to the ""wonders"" of processed food? The answer is, it can't. Very few among us have the will power to do that, and social manipulation won't cut it either.

But it isn't just vegetables. It is also meat. He almost completely ignores that fact that meat varies enormously in quality and simply recommends less of it. This is a gross oversimplification and the point should have been made that our meat also needs to eat real food in alignment with its biology and life in a healthy environment.

And almost nothing was said about healthy animal fats. I find that disturbing because of most of us, without lots of healthy quality fats, will quickly go back to sugar/carb based diets. In his defense, there was a bit about the Omega 6 based fats and the problems associated with that.

I appreciate the motivation away from processed foods, but if we are going to move toward real food, we need to understand what real food is, or we will shortly be back to the processed junk.

Overall, I'm glad I watched, even though I felt the narrative was lacking in essential ways.",1451520000,23,1723,4.700996677740863

7498030,5,B0178YSSYU,"This book, along with Pollan's book ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" have informed my thinking about food and what I choose to eat.  I've lost weight and my overall health has improved after reading those two books.

I read this book first and consider it the most eye-opening and concise book I have ever read about food, health and nutrition.

It is NOT a diet book -- It is an information book that helps you look at food in a different way!",1471651200,,436,4.425

7498032,5,B0178YSSYU,"I love the work of Michael Pollan.  Every person should watch this.  Several of my friends didn't want to see it because they
thought it was all doom and gloom about food, but it's not, and that's what I like about this piece; it's balanced.  It shows the positives
about good food, real food.  My favorite part, eat like the French...enjoy!",1470355200,2,341,4.540983606557377

7498036,5,B0178YSSYU,I was really excited to watch this documentary after reading Michael Pollan's book of the same name. I would recommend others to read the book first and then delve into the DVD. It is very informative without being harsh as some food documentaries are. Michael Pollan has seriously opened my eyes to a new way of eating.,1462665600,6,320,4.631578947368421

8738376,5,B0178YSSYU,"I recommend both the documentary & the book. If you want to know how to eat well, how to ditch diets, how to truly eat to live: look at this video & then snag the book. Pollan doesn't spout a bunch of hippy, granola nonsense (as my dad would have said). Pollan gives commen sense tips our grandmothers would have told us, and probably did. It boild down to the motto: Eat food, not too much, mostly plants. He doesn't call for you to raise your own chickens or eliminate meat, but he does want you to be aware of what is in your food, what you are eating, and how adversely it affects your health. Using this as a guide, hubby & I both lost more weight than we ever did on diets, and overall our health improved. HIGHLY recommend it.",1512259200,,733,4.169014084507042

8738379,5,B0178YSSYU,"This is one of the best documentaries on food. He covers a lot of territory in a simple way. At the end, he summarizes by eat real food, not too much, and mostly plants. The healthiest people in the world know nothing about nutrition and never watch food advertising. They eat as their ancesters did.",1501372800,,300,4.472727272727273
