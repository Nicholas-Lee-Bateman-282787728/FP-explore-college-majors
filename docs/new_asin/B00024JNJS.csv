2063084,1,B00024JNJS,"Appointment in Tokyo is done in the style of  the documentary-like holdovers from the somewhat self-serving armed-forces films that were produced during and  immediately following WWII. All things Japanese are still referred to as Jap, as in  the Japs, the Jap forces, the Jap navy, etc.

The entirely one-sided account concentrates mainly on the various  battles that culminated in the liberation of the Phillipines, after whichas though the writers suddenly found that they had used too much time for earlier materialsthe last stages of the war were more or less treated  more or less like a list. If I correctly recall, Iwo Jima , Okinawa, and even the atomic bomb were accorded only a handful of seconds apiece. I would have to watch it again something I can't bring myself to dofor a reminder as to whether the deadly Kamikaze tactics as the wars end neared were even mentioned.

I, personally, derive more of a sense of the sweeping drama of the conflict by reading relevant Wikipedia articles than I do from this film. All of the various PBS films touching on the conflict that I have seen do a far better job.",1401148800,,1117,4.756476683937824

2063088,4,B00024JNJS,"This production demonstrates just how actively MacArthur's image was polished and projected, during the war.  leaving out his personal excesses, and errors in judgement. Still it is well worth seeing for anyone interested in the period.",1386979200,,236,5.555555555555555
2063089,4,B00024JNJS,Well narrated  overview of the Pacific Theater beginning in early 1942 and ending with the signing of peace treaty between the US and Japan on 1 September 1945. US and captured Japanese original footage is presented in an easy to follow format. Maps are included to provide a basic understanding of the strategy used by the combined military forces. Definitely recommended for those that are curious about WWII and for beginners. A documentary that is accurate and interesting without including an in depth view. Look into the eyes of history.,1382054400,3,543,5.033333333333333
2063090,5,B00024JNJS,"Excellent work, considering the time frame of World War II and
the photography equipment available at the time. Should be read
by all. If we don't learn from the past we are bound to repeat it.",1344297600,,193,4.388888888888889
2063091,5,B00024JNJS,"This film was produced by the Army Pictorial Service of the Signal Corps, which was during WW II commanded by Col. Frank Capra (""It's A Wonderful Life,"" starring James Stewart). As a Private First Class combat cameraman and still photographer, I was a member of the crew which shot some of the footage of the Philippine invasion: MacArthur's Return. It was originally planned as a spur for War Bond sales to be shown in the theaters of America prior to the invasion of Japan, which -- fortunately -- was never necessary; later added to, to reflect a larger ""picture"" of that war.
  I highly recommend it, especially for senior high school teachers of American History. As such (after retiring from the US Army), I used it in my teaching units on World War II at a Florida high school. It's as good as it gets; true to the wartime experiences I had. (My novel, CAMERA SOLDIERS, tells the story of what went on ""behind"" the cameras with the men who took the pictures.)

2063093,5,B00024JNJS,"General MacArthur was a true American hero.  Graduating at the top of his West Point class, he was assigned responsibilities in the army which took advantage of his skills and call to duty.  Assigned to a post in the Philippines, he became enamored with the Philippine people.  He performed many daring acts, one of which was his promise to return to that land.  This happened before the war was winding down and was done under circumstances which could have been disastrous for both him and his men.  The crowning act of his service was that he was assigned to oversee the post-war occupation of Japan.  A truly brilliant man who was devoted to his country.",1461715200,2,658,4.678260869565217

MacArthur is a native of Norfolk, VA and his museum is there with his grave inside that building. I was the personal escort of one of the high-level Japanese civilians who knew him after 1945. I was personally honored by this man for my assistance in returning the last Japanese sea plane, EMILY, to the nation of Japan in 1978. EMILY had been in Norfolk at the Naval Air Station since 1945 to study the aerodynamics of that aircraft, but time passes and we entered the jet age and stopped the sea plane research era. That aircraft was refurbished and now sits on the base where the Kamikazi aircraft were launched against the American sea forces in 1945.
