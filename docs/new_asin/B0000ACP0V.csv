7996630,5,B0000ACP0V,Excellent product - Exactly as advertised.,1491955200,,42,6.166666666666667
7996631,5,B0000ACP0V,"When I lived in the UK I used Tony Little's exercise video cassettes and LOVED them.  I was so happy to find this dvdn and the one on ab reduction.  If you use these you will see results!  I did miles of walking and these dvds to get and stay in shape, not to mention lose weight and inches.",1452816000,,291,3.8983050847457625
7996632,5,B0000ACP0V,"Not for advanced. Not enough reps to get a burn, not even with heavy weights. This would be great for beginners.",1435708800,,112,4.380952380952381
7996633,1,B0000ACP0V,"I guess I bought it because I used to watch his videos, more like a nostalgic purchase, I regret buying it.",1397692800,,107,4.142857142857143
7996634,3,B0000ACP0V,"I have several Tony Little VHS tapes, really liked his manner but new DVD is too ""energetic"" and not for the older folks.  Liked his older ones much better.  Warm up tires me out!!",1338940800,,180,4.264705882352941
7996635,5,B0000ACP0V,"- Technique Demonstration section clearly shows how to properly do body alignment and  the exercises properly. One of the important and interesting thing Tony showed is never move your knee out past your toes while doing squats or lunges. Otherwise, it will be injured.

- There are slides showing what muscles are being worked on for each exercise. Many other competitors' DVDs do not have this.

- Multi-angle views are shown while Tony's doing the exercise. This makes it very easy for me to follow. Not all the other exercise DVDs have this.

- The exercises are effective because I sweat after doing them.

- There is a time bar showing 30 seconds, 60 and 90 intervals.

- There are 9 exercises in total. They are: Modified Squats, Wide-Stance Squats, Lunges for left leg, Lunges for right leg, Calves, Lateral Leg Raise for left leg, Lateral Leg Raise for right leg, Butt Squeeze for left cheek, Butt Squeeze for right cheek. The length is 90 seconds per exercise for advanced level, 60 for medium and 30 for beginner's. They're adequate for me. A viewer complained they're short. For me, that's not a problem.
Later, when I get used to them and find they're short, I can re-run them to make each 3 minutes long.

- Tony's speaking is encouraging with some humor. That makes time fly while practicing with him.

In short, it's an Excellent Exercise DVD. I use it with other DVDs such as cardio exercise.",1310601600,3,1409,4.676113360323886
7996636,1,B0000ACP0V,"I STILL have NOT received this item and have not been contacted back! I was charged but never got my item, and will NOT be doing business with them again.",1240617600,3,154,4.166666666666667
7996637,3,B0000ACP0V,"I know this DVD is an ""Express"" one, but I didn't even break a sweat.  It says the total DVD time is 50 minutes and I know would include instruction, etc. but the total actual warm up and workout time is less than 25 minutes.  The workout is squats, widestand squats, standing lunges, calf raises and lateral thigh raises, each for 30 to 90 minutes.  There is no inner thigh work.  This is a good supplement to other exercises but not enough on it's own.",1133568000,4,454,4.305882352941176
7996638,5,B0000ACP0V,"I love doing this workout in combination with a cardio.

The results are aweswome",1123804800,3,81,4.785714285714286
