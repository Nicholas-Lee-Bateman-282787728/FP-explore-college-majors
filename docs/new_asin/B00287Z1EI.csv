3872068,3,B00287Z1EI,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1925,4.928792569659443
