3025834,5,B000YCLRBA,"I agree with everyone, except that I loved the minimalist sets because they allowed me to focus completely on the performers.  I almost held my breath waiting for The Met to release anything from last season...anything at all.  I was thrilled and ordered it immediately from them.  If I'd know Amazon would get them ( bought Puritani, too), I would have waited...but I didn't dare. Now I want them to let ""The Barber of Seville"" loose.  THAT was also incredible.  Joyce diDonato was thrilling...as was the entire cast.  When they do that, I'll buy it from Amazon.",1199664000,4,563,4.752577319587629
3025835,4,B000YCLRBA,I saw this in the theater when it was broadcast live and was blown away by the performances of Renee and Dimitri.  The set was minimalist yet wonderful!  I was hoping this would come out on DVD. I just wish it would come out on Blu-Ray disc so I can watch it in Hi-Def at home.  Watching it on standard DVD just doesn't quite compare to watching it in Hi-Def.,1199232000,4,359,4.1

They artfully enable one to focus on the performances and drama without extraneous distraction.  A thrilling experience and a must-have.  Plus, DH=hubba hubba!",1197504000,11,331,5.673469387755102
3025837,5,B000YCLRBA,"This production was on the web for months by now, and every opera lover is dying to own it in a neat and snug DVD set (also for gifts during Christmas).
Dmitri Hvorostovsky previously sung a CD version in the late 1990's with Nuccia Focile as Tatyanna. I would say with 100% certainty that this MET production's Onegin and Tatyanna topped the previous version. Baritones are like wine; in the case of Hvorostovsky, exceedingly good wine. I remember well the last parting scene of the two protagonists in this production - devastating is the only description I could think of.
Fleming and DH were like being engaged in a vocal dual, each singing and acting their hearts out. Their proficiency simply unblievable. I strongly recommend this recording to students undertaking operatic training.
Ramon Vargas delivered an aria (""Kuda, Kuda"") that earned him an applause for well-nigh 2 minutes. He is in his absolute prime in this performance.
Gergiev - yes, he's the person chiefly responsible for bringing out the best in his cast. Rene Fleming's so-called 'mannerisms' were no where discernible in this performance.

3025838,5,B000YCLRBA,"I was thrilled seeing this at the movie theater knowing the considerable talent of the three principals and couldn't wait until it came out on DVD.  I've purchased a few for Christmas presents to the friends who were with me on that day and, yes, we opera ""buffs"" have been discussing it ever since.  The first reviewer is spot on in the details of the review. The only detraction was (as most usual) the production, however, those made no difference in the wonderful pleasure derived from the artistry of the singers.  Dmitri owns the role, period.  Renee was at her very, very best and the chemistry between the two jumped off the screen.  This is a must purchase for anyone who loves the art of pure singing and acting singers.  Performances of perfection!!  I was in attendance at the Met for my favorite performance of all time, that of Domingo and Fleming in ""Otello"", also available on DVD.  This is just about as good as it gets in the world of great opera singing.  I've seen all three in person many times and the DVD is a must for memories of these extraordinary artists in a beautiful opera.  Russian is a language that sings beautifully as well.

3025841,5,B000YCLRBA,"I saw the moviecast of this production. For those who don't know, the moviecast was a live performance of a matinee at the Met in New York shown in movie theatres across the country; it had almost all the excitement of being in the Met itself for this unforgettable performance. I just wish I too had a program to tear up and rain confetti down on the singers as the audience at the Met did. Yes, it was that great a performance.

This is a lushly romantic opera about unrequited love and deserves to be far better known than it is.

As for the performance, it's one for the ages and I count myself lucky to have seen the moviecast. I agree with the previous reviewer about the spare sets not always doing justice to the intent of the opera, but the performances are so stellar, it really doesn't matter.

I've been anxiously awaiting the DVD and am very relieved that it's one of only two releases from last season's Met moviecasts.",1196467200,23,933,4.412790697674419
3025842,5,B000YCLRBA,"I'm so pleased to see that this is coming out on DVD!  I taped this (Met production?) off of the TV and my tape is all messed up.  So now I can replace it, and with something that doesn't have a Severe Weather Warning in the corner, either.

This was a beautiful production.  Tatyana and Onegin are sung by real stalwarts.  But I had never heard the Mexican tenor(?) who sings Lenski and that was such a nice surprise.  He has a beautiful voice and did a great job.  I hope they have included the behind-the-scenes footage they showed on TV - he was chuckling that he didn't really see himself as a tragic young Russian romantic, but that he would do his best!

I've always loved my dear Onegin in any form.  I am definitely pre-ordering this!",1196380800,10,743,4.326086956521739
3025843,5,B000YCLRBA,"Anyone making a short list of the all time greatest operas needs to give serious consideration to Eugene Onegin. Not only is this opera filled with beautiful melodies, it also contains a very dramatic story told episodically, almost as a tableaux of grand scenes. The story is unconventional in that the lovers never get together because they are never on the same page romantically, initially he is too mature for her, then, later, ironically, when he finally becomes interested, she is too mature for him. There is death in this opera, but the real tragedy of Eugene Onegin is the title character's self-centered, unfeeling hubris, and finally his regrets. All of this is expressed through music so achingly romantic it washes over the listener like a wave. Anyone who thinks Tchaikovsky was just a composer of pretty ballets has obviously never seen or heard Eugene Onegin.

I saw this production when it was broadcast to a local cineplex earlier this year. I was so enthralled and excited by what I had experienced(I was high on this performance for days!) that I have been anxiously waiting for it to be released on DVD ever since. The production itself isn't perfect, but the performances are(the Met repeats the success of its La Traviata of a few years ago by reuniting the same three leads with the same conductor), and the result is a Eugene Onegin whose like we are unlikely to see again, at least during my lifetime.

The leads could not be more ideally cast. Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky are what is popularly referred as the complete package, a combination of knockout looks, intelligence, charisma, dramatic ability, oh, and did I forget to mention vocal talent? Hvorostovsky broods handsomely, and his icy detachment is chilling, abetted in no small measure by the depth of his baritone voice. His Onegin is easy to fall in love with, but hard to feel much sympathy for, at least until the end, which is how it should be. Fleming is quite a bit older than Tatianna, but is still youthfully lovely, and capable of exploring the young innocent's tormented emotions. Besides, her age and experience make her character's eventual maturation into a regal and sophisticated woman of the world that much more convincing. Fleming's mood-swinging, ultimately giddy Letter Scene brings down the house,(remember, when I saw this it was in a movie theater, watching the performance via satellite, and the result was just as overpowering). Ramon Vargas has the impassioned, jealous tenor thing down pat, he obviously draws on his experience singing Alfredo, and he makes for a fiery Lensky. The mezzo-soprano who sings Olga(I don't recall her name) is attractive and appropriately flirty. Musically, I'd rate this performance as flawless. Conductor Valery Gergiev's deep understanding of this score is obvious, so is his equally deep love for it.

The production is mostly good, but with some problems. For instance, I don't understand why Tatianna's bed is placed in the middle of the outdoors other than to give her an excuse to fling leaves across the stage at the climax of the Letter Scene. Maybe this is supposed to represent how her writing the letter is her liberation from confinement...if so, well, it works better conceptually than visually. And the ballroom scenes are minimalist to the extreme, lacking any grandeur, which attenuates the effectiveness of the staging. Certain operas, such as Traviata and this one, should always be opulent(this director could take a few lessons from Franco Zefferelli), no matter how modernist operas in general become, because the opulence is an important element of the storytelling. Onegin is supposed to be distanced from and bored by the bourgeois spectacle he sees, by the aristocratic circles he finds himself traveling in, and their values,  but this is hard to convey when there isn't any bourgeois spectacle to be bored BY. My feeling, this is minimalism without any understanding of the subtexts of the opera, minimalism for its own sake, just to do something different, an attempt to add intimacy to a scene that isn't really supposed to be intimate. On a positive note, the opening scene is superb, as are the scenes where Onegin rebuffs Tatianna's affections and their final intimate drawing room duet. The duel, staged completely in shadows, is rather unsettling. Here the creepy minimalism makes perfect sense, and the result is one of the most effective opera scenes I've seen in recent memory. For the most part the production works, despite being disappointing in places, at the very least it never distracts from the performances, which might sound like a left-handed compliment but is a compliment nonetheless.

One more thing, concerning the price. I was tempted to knock off a star due to the fact that Deutsche Grammophon has chosen to release this as a two disc set even though the opera is only about two-and-a-half hours long and therefore capable of fitting on one. I have the same complaint about the upcoming I Puritani, which I saw when it was broadcast on PBS, also an excellent performance, very much worth owning, but also short enough to fit on a single disc. Obviously I'm planning to suck it up(for Onegin, and perhaps for Puritani as well) and shell out the money because the idea of not owning this is unthinkable, but in the meantime, color me disgruntled. In the end, though, I have decided to rate the performance, not the price, in which case the five stars is well deserved.",1195948800,144,5477,4.961873638344227

3025847,5,B000YCLRBA,"A stellar performance of Eugene Onegin that I have been watching again and again! Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky are perfectly cast here as Ongein and Tatyana. Their chemistry is especially palpable in the final scenes. Ms. Fleming ably portrays Tatyana from a innocent young girl in the flush of her first love, heartbroken when Onegin coldly rejects her (her tears in this scene seem real and his cold superiority leaps off the screen), to mature self contained woman when Onegin sees her years later after she is married to a Prince. Only then is Onegin attracted to her and the roles are reversed. She is aloof and he is giddy like a young boy in his first love. I won't tell you how it ends, watch it! :) The whole cast is excellent and the two leads are in particularly fine voice here. Valery Ghergiev really pulls the pathos and drama of Tchaikovsky's music from the Met orchestra and the staging is minimal yet charming. A must for any opera lover",1433894400,4,963,4.604651162790698
3025848,5,B000YCLRBA,Brilliant!,1428624000,,10,10.0
3025849,3,B000YCLRBA,"This is a distressing video of Tchaikovsky's great opera.
It is a fine production in musical terms, with generally excellent singing and an impassioned, well-paced performance from conductor Valery Gergiev. Dmitri Hvorostovsky demonstrates why he is one of the leading protagonists of the title role, with beautiful singing and powerful acting. Renee Fleming is a lovely Tatiana. She handles the vocal demands with aplomb; dramatically, she manages girlishness in the early going without embarrasing herself, and she is nicely regal in Act III. Ramn Vargas brings a lovely lyric tenor to Lensky's part and acts convincingly. Fleming and Vargas are the only non-Russians in the cast; they seem comfortable with the language, though I can't comment on the quality of their diction. The two larger supporting roles are less good. Elena Zaremba looks too old for Olga, and her singing is a bit rough. Sergei Aleksashin as Gremin certainly understands his beautiful aria, but his pitches are rather wooly. The small roles are well-cast.
Unfortunately, all these good things are sabotaged by Robert Carsen's preposterous production. I realize that the stage director is treated like a deity in today's operatic world. But it is too bad that ""concept""productions are inflicted on operas which are firmly bound to a specific time and place for their setting. ""Yevgeny Onegin"" is all about imperial Russia, and the more authentic detail the better. Here we have characters in beautiful period costumes acting on a minimalist ""non-set"". The vast Met stage is made into a cavernous room, with actual walls at the back and sides, and virtually all the action takes place in a small central area of this huge space. This creates a number of absurdities, of which I'll list three that reduced me to laughter:
1. During the entire first act the stage is for some reason covered with fake autumn leaves. For the Letter Scene, Tatiana's bedroom sits in the middle of this leafy expanse. Since Filipyevna has to leave the scene before Tatiana starts writing, she exits via - you guessed it - a trapdoor! (She uses it again when she re-enters.)
2. For the ball scene in Act II the playing space is delineated by a rectangular arrangement of chairs. During the opening waltz the chorus and dancers are crammed into this space like sardines in a can and can scarcely move. To add to the silliness, the women freeze in poses while the men sing, and vice versa.
3. A composer usually has good musical and dramatic reasons to end an act where he does. Act II ends with the duel between Onegin and Lensky. Act III is set some years later in Prince Gremin's palace and opens with the guests dancing to a brilliant polonaise. In this production Act II runs into Act III without a break. As the polonaise begins, Lensky's corpse is still lying onstage. Eventually a group of servants carries the tenor into the wings while another group removes Onegin's costume and dresses him in a new one, in full view of the audience. (Perhaps someone wanted to admire Hvorostovsky's bare torso ...) This was simply jaw-droppingly ridiculous.
Carsen has apparently convinced many people that he is a genius. He is not. He is a charlatan who regularly demolishes great operatic works. This particular piece of directorial self-indulgence does nothing but distract from the fine singing and acting that is going on.
I'd have to give this DVD three stars for the musical values. Perhaps you could watch it with the picture turned off.
The 1984 Kirov production on Kultur is less impressive cinematically, but it is a beautiful, traditional staging, with wonderful singing and conducting.",1422230400,4,3643,4.9639934533551555
3025850,1,B000YCLRBA,"Staging is just awful. Just flat plain walls at an angle and lots of leaves on the ground at first and lots of chairs later.  Aesthetically very displeasing.

3025855,3,B000YCLRBA,"Well,  I did not read 79  five stars reviews.  I love Tchaikovsky s Onegin and I am getting accostumed to minimalistic ""licenses"", which perhaps allow whichever symbolism.
  Despite the ""pour"" understandable scenario, singers, orchestra,whole music are wonderful,
  Problem is Brian Large, whose direction is better at Pique Dame 2007 in St Petersburg.

No one can deny the top scene of Onegin is the duel  and Lensky 's ""Kuda?"", may be the best romantic  non-clichet-tenor aria.
  Well , once Lensky is dead ,we see a sun which pretended to be Petersburg Midnightsummer but seemed instead as an Arizona's twilight for a cold killer  named Onegin.
Pushkin gives a gap of time between duel and Onegin return.  Nevertheless, we are taken instantaneously to  Onegin having his cloth changed (to show Barihunk shirtless?) for the last ball, meanwhile Lensky's corpse is taken away.

  PORTUGUES: Nao li os 79 elogios de 5 estrelas. Adoro Tchaikovsky e me acostumei com licenas minimalistas , que talvez admitam qualquer simbolismo.
Apesar do pobre e compreensvel cenrio, cantores, orquestra, toda a msica est esplndida.
  O problema seria talvez Brian Large, que, em Petersburgo 2007, dirigiu melhor a Dama de Espadas.
  Ningum negaria que o ponto alto de Onegin  o duelo e a ria ""Kuda"" de Lensky, talvez a melhor e menos clich das rias romnticas para tenor.
  Bem, assim que Lensky morre,  vemos um sol que talvez fingia ser a meia-noite de Petersburgo, mas mais parece um ocaso no Arizona, para um assassino frio chamado  Onegin.  Pushkin d um tempo entre o duelo e a volta de Onegin.
Entretanto ,somos levados instantaneamente a Onegin a trocar de roupa ( para mostrar o bartono sem camisa?) para o baile final, enquanto o cadver de Lensky  levado.

3025869,5,B000YCLRBA,"Last October I saw the Metropolitan Operas new production of EUGENE ONEGIN in its HD movie theater showing.  The performance featured Mariusz Kwiechen as Onegin, Anna Netrebko as Tatiana, and Piotr Beczala as Lensky.  Though the realistic production was meticulously directed and acted and often beautifully sung, it didn't affect me emotionally the way the Mets previous production of EUGENE ONEGIN, which this DVD captures in a 2007 performance, does.  For me, the 2007 ONEGIN is virtually definitive.

Stylistically, the settings are abstract while the costumes are traditional (they seem to be from the period of the original poems composition, the 1820's).  The poetic introductory sequence, with Onegin sitting alone on a bench remembering the past while autumn leaves swirl around him, is one visual highlight; another is the transition from Act II to Act III, with a despondent Onegin being readied for the ball by his servants.  Vocally, the cast is almost uniformly excellent (I say almost because Elena Zarembas matronly-looking Olga is afflicted by a distressing wobble).  Renee Fleming as Tatiana is here at her late-prime best, pure of voice and convincingly youthful in appearance even though she was 48 years old at the time.  Ramon Vargas as Lensky is not as intense or idiomatic as was Beczala, but his poet is sincerely acted and beautifully sung in a basically bel-canto manner.  Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Onegin is, in a word, perfect: elegant of voice as of appearance, charismatic yet cynical, and ultimately heartbreaking.  Maestro Valery Gergiev conducts the score with deep feeling.  Dont miss this DVD.",1390176000,3,1626,5.263565891472868

The Russian peasants, in Act 1, are not only in proper garb but they physically look like Russian peasants.

 There is no bad singing, in this rendition. Everyone did a more than acceptable job.

 The only issue I have is the scenery choices. Rather than realistic backdrops, we are treated to a box, the projected colors and floor textures of which change, as the scenes change. Odd but it worked. This is an opera not regularly performed, at the Met or otherwise, probably because it is Russian-quirky and different from the Italian and German styles, to which most of us have become accustomed.

3025881,3,B000YCLRBA,"If I hadn't known better, I would have thought that this opera was recorded in some sort of school lecture hall! Acoustics is far too dominant, lighting most unprofessional, stage set-up painfully dull.
Certainly Rene Fleming (Tatyana) has a beautiful voice, so have Dmitri Hvorostovsky (Onegin) and Ramn Vargas (Lensky). Elena Zaremba as Olga sings unfortunately as she suffers from constipation, though.
The periodic clothing is fine. (However, someone has put what looks like half of a grapefruit on poor Lensky's head. (The ""fruit"" falls fortunately off later). The night letter scene is great, thanks to dazzling singing and acting by Fleming. Also the orchestra performs fine with the experienced Valery Gergiev as conductor.

Some reviewers claim that the simple stage set-up makes the viewer concentrate on the action and draws the viewer into the plot and the mood more easily. I presume those reviewers would settle for a VHS version of the opera, instead of high definition blu-ray disc.

I can't in all honesty recommend this blu-ray, although this is not the fault of the singers or the orchestra. The stage director and the producer must take the blame entirely. I will approach future Met releases with great caution.
Of course this is not the first time that stage director Robert Carsen has ruined a fine opera and I doubt it will be the last...",1374710400,,1362,5.022123893805309

Onegin to remain faithful to  Lenski.  Vargas plays Lenski with sensitivity and the anger and disillusionment in his
friend, Onegin, leads to the duel.  I love this opera and I hope to see it live at the Met this season.",1374364800,2,453,4.8311688311688314

3025884,5,B000YCLRBA,"Onegin is contemptible. A self-pitying narcissist, Don Giovanni without even the false nobility of defiance. On one hand, one can be gratified that the tale includes no Faustian Repentence/Redemption, so beloved of 19th C adolescence. On the other, one can feel aggrieved that the despicable jerk doesn't end the opera with a suicide. And that leaves the key question: why did such asinine heroes appeal to Romantic writers, composers, and audiences, from Goethe's mawkish Werther almost to the present?

Alexander Puskin's poem is a revered classic of Russian literature. Unfortunately, I can't read Russian and therefore have no idea how closely or amply the opera libretto by Tchaikovsky and Shilovsky represents the poem. The libretto is stock Victorian melodrama. That doesn't, of course, distinguish it from many other popular 19th and early 20th C operas, most of which depend on passionate music to rescue their stories from banality.

Is Tchaikovsky's music passionate enough? Forgive me, dear reader, but to my ears it's mere humdrum bandshell Heldenwhoopy. The only portion of the opera that affects me emotionally is the soliloquy of the poet Lenski as he confronts his almost-certain death in a duel with his ""friend"" Onegin. Lenski is another Romantic caricature, a fool but a likable one. The role is sung and acted, on this DVD, by Ramn Vargas; both acting and singing are superb enough to justify the whole 156 minutes of the production. It's the singing and acting that earn my five-star rating of the DVD, rather than the opera per se. Dmitri Hvorostovsky is the very avatar of the arrogant selfish Onegin. Rene Fleming makes herself believable both as the puppy-love provincial maiden Tatiana and as the mature self-dominating faithful wife Tatiana. Extraordinary singing can redeem almost any mawkish text.

And the ""film"" is beautiful. Fleming and Hvorostovsky are sensual bliss in close-ups. The ""sets"" are utterly minimal -- a floor covered with scattered autumn leaves, bare walls, a few chairs -- but perfectly conceived to frame the gorgeous costumes, expressive faces, and well-directed choreography of the singer-actors' movements. The color coordination, from the lush orange and auburn of the first act to the brooding blues and somber blacks of later scenes, seems more artful to my eyes than any amount of costly clutter.

I know this is an ambivalent review. But it's sincere. Eugene Onegin is a perennial favorite of opera audiences. There must be something more to the music than my ears perceive. Conductor Valery Gergiev can't be held accountable for my taste; he elicits very fine instrumental timbres and tight ensemble from the Met Opera Orchestra. If you consider yourself - in your madness - a ""serious opera lover,"" Eugene Onegin is an opera you must hear and see at least once, and this is as artful a performance of it as anyone could demand.",1367539200,3,2888,5.1252653927813165

3025890,4,B000YCLRBA,"This is a very fine performance and recording of what must be described as rather a minimalist production which, on its own terms, must also be considered a success. To elaborate further therefore ......

The cast chosen for this production is unquestioningly top quality throughout and it delivers similar high quality performances in depth. The title role of Onegin perfectly suits the handsome and impressive Dmitri Hvorostovsky whose rich voice and generally restrained bearing underlines Onegin's own perceived role in society. The Russian timbre of his voice also adds considerable veracity to this role. In this respect he is in good company within the cast. Olga, sung by Elena Zaremba, Tatiana's nurse, sung by Larisa Shevchenko, Tatiana's mother sung by Svetlana Volkova and the impressively Russian timbred Serei Aleksashkin as Prince Gremin, all share these tonal advantages. All the above listed singers are clearly equally immersed in their respective roles and the production benefits accordingly.

Ren&eacute;e Fleming is a perfect Tatiana and brings the necessary appearance of youth combined with her later social sophistication effortlessly to the role. Her voice is as beautiful as her acting is beyond reproach. The role of Lenski suits the sustained lyrical abilities of Ram&oacute;n Vargas which culminates in arguably one of his finest moments at the beginning of Act 2 scene 2 in his lengthy aria just prior to the fatal duel. This justifiably earns a considerable ovation from the very appreciative audience.

The orchestra play to their normal high standard under the sure direction of Gergiev who clearly knows this score inside out.

The production is one of the minimalist variety where the intention appears to be to focus the audience's attention on the personal dramas rather than the settings. To this extent it succeeds very well and suits the intention of the libretto based largely on Pushkin's creation. As Tchaikovsky himself commented in a letter to his future benefactress Nadezhda von Meck on 27 May 1877, `The opera will have no strong dramatic action, but the portrayal of everyday life will be interesting, and how full of poetry it all is.' Nevertheless there will be those who will regret the lack of opulence in the ballroom scenes which can be spectacular in other productions.

There are the usual interviews and introductions typical of these Met recordings plus a short film giving an interesting glimpse of rehearsal moments which reinforce expectations rather than casting any new light as regards understanding this opera. The booklet is usefully informative.

The imaging is crisp and the camera work is involving. The close-up shots during the ballroom scenes help to suggest a greater scale of event than is actually the case on stage! The sound is presented in excellent DTS 5.1 and stereo.

This is a quality production which should give plenty of pleasure and satisfaction to most purchasers. Within the context of the somewhat minimalist chosen production values it seems reasonable to rate this as a convincing disc although there will be many who will regret the lack of scenic scale, most obviously at points such as the ballroom scene where it can easily be argued that too much has to be left to the imagination.

3025891,5,B000YCLRBA,"I have recently purchased this DVD mainly due to the excellent reviews that it had received. They were entirely right - this production is superb in all respects. I am especially impressed by Renne Fleming, and in particular by her rendition of the ""letter scene"". This justly famous passage from Pushkin's Evgeny Onegin (which is perhaps as important to the Russian language as La Divina Comedia is to Italian), that is quoted essentially verbatim in Tchaikovsky's score, must be one of the highest pinnacles of aesthetic achievement both in poetry and music. Renne's rendition of this passage will positively give you goose bumps. It is a no small feat that a singer in her fifties can believably look and act the part of a young woman; she does all that very convincingly, singing incredibly beautifully all the way through. I imagine that Russian can not be a simple language to her, and yet we would never guess this from listening to her. In my opinion this passage alone justifies the purchase of the DVD.  Among the other singers I am especially impressed by Hvorostovsky, but this is perhaps not overly surprising since he is on the home turf in this beautiful romantic music of Tchaikovsky. The blending of Renne's and Dmitry's voices must be one of the most fortunate examples in contemporary opera production. Gergiev leads with his characteristic energy, intelligence and insight; this man is truly impressive, in my opinion one of the handful most exciting conductors of our time.",1335052800,5,1494,4.952191235059761

The blu ray images were fine but not outstanding and the sound while OK did not have the level of sound stage presence that I have heard from other blu ray disks.  I hope however, that the Met got the set and staging for a discount.  Plan brownish yellow walls, pretty much the same from act to act.  Lots of leaves for the chorus to sweep, in fact that was the major activity for the female chorus, sweeping leaves. There were also lots of chairs -- I don't get the chairs.  The beautiful 3rd act opening polinaise was wasted by the static scene of dressing Onegin; I thought that the polinaise was a dance where were the dancers?  If sets and action are supposed to help set a time and place -- this set and stage direction failed.  You could close your eyes for long periods of time and not miss a thing except for not being able to read the subtitles.

Dimitri is gorgeous, elegant, and oh, so aloof.  Renee is lovely, yet vulnerable.  Ramon is a poet, sensitive yet quick to anger.  I would appreciate sets that suggest Russia of the time, costumes that reflect the culture, and a truly grand Polonaise.  None of this was in the Met's mix this time, but one can't have everything even though it is always permissible to dream.  A good all-around choice.

3025897,5,B000YCLRBA,"Tchaikovsky's opera ""Eugene Onegin"" was a pleasant surprise to me when I first encountered it. I was expecting a heavy Russian epic (along the lines of ""Boris Godunov""), but instead it is romantic and very lyrical.

In this production from the Metropolitan Opera, Rene Fleming gives an outstanding performance as Tatiana, producing beautiful singing and touching acting throughout. Dmitri Hvorostovsky is equally appealing as Onegin, with his famous rich tone. And how touching it was to have the two of them interviewed at intermission by Beverly Sills herself!

The production is very different and extremely minimalist, with the stage frequently bare with the exception of one or two simple pieces of furniture. While some may prefer sets on the more extravagant side of things, I found that this minimalist approach allowed the characters themselves to blossom and become the center of our attention. The lighting design brought out some gorgeous colors, with a very effective sunrise after Tatiana's letter aria, and a cold morning for a chilling duel between Onegin and Lensky.

The video quality is crystal clear, though not quite at the exceptional level of many discs release by Opus Arte. The sound is simply stunning.

It all works wonderfully for this, to me, very intimate opera that focuses more on Tatiana. Lenski and Onegin's inner emotions.  Although, the production thrilled me, I was overwhelmed with the musical side of things, as well

The Met Orchestra, outstandingly led by Valery Gergiev, was, per usual, wonderful playing with extreme beauty and sensitivity--bravo.  All three (3) of the principal singers (Renee Fleming, Ramon Vargas, and Dmitri Hvorostovsk) were simply outstanding delivering their arias and duets magnificently.  The closing duet between Onegin and Tatiana (Fleming and Hvorostovsky) was truly special being so dramatic and beautifully sung.  Once again, I must say BRAVO.

I missed the live broadcast in theaters but the DVD on wide screen TV is the next best option. I just can't have enough of it. The opera is based on a beautiful love story by Pushkin that Tchaikovsky transformed into an immortal opera. The melodies are Tchaikovskian at their best and beautifully match the scenes and moods of story line. The performances of major characters by Fleming, Hvorostovsky and Vargas are breath-taking despite two of them being non-Russian (Fleming,Vargas). I specially was taken by Ms. Fleming's performance. My first Onegin recording had Irina Arkhipova in Filipyevna role and I was amazed as how well Ms. Fleming held a candle to the great Russian opera singer. Ms Fleming is not only a great singer but an excellent actress too as she melds into the role of a 16 year old Russian girl so beautifully that you loose sight of her being much older. The dramatic impressions by the characters more than make up for the lack of elaborate decor in most of the scenes. Though the story-line is somewhat sad, it is one of Tchaikovsky's happier operas as compared with Mazeppa, Iolante or Queen of Spades. The sad irony is that Pushkin himself was killed in a duel in much the same way as Lensky's character in the opera. I tell my friends ""if you just want to see one opera in your life-time, make it Evgeny Onegin. You won't regret it.""",1295654400,,1472,4.558490566037736
3025901,5,B000YCLRBA,"Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin is as Russian as they come - from an impeccable literary source (Pushkin), filled with all the classic situations of fatalistic romances, fabulous balls and a duel over a question of honour.  The Met's 2007 production, recorded for their HD-Live series, retains a strong underpinning in the casting and the sensitive conducting of the opera by Valery Gergiev that brings these elements brilliantly to the fore.

Perfectly in line with Tchaikovsky's original intentions, Robert Carsen's staging is straightforward and simple, the set uncluttered, with only the bare minimum of props required for the settings, while the all-important tone - primarily an emotional one - is set by the lighting and colouration of the stark backgrounds that tower over and enclose the performers.  It gives the opera a truly unique feel, one that is perfectly in tune with the emotional chords struck by the music and the libretto, a tone that is dominated by the interpretation of Onegin here - cold, austere and aloof, calculating even, certainly with a touch of arrogance, but carrying within himself his own torments, distancing himself from others in a remote and self-involved manner that doesn't take anyone else's feelings into account.

It's remarkable then how this chimes with Tchaikovsky's own personal circumstances at the time, unable to bear the gossip surrounding him over his sexuality, entering unadvisedly into a marriage for convenience where he is unable to offer anything more than ""brotherly love"".  Accordingly the music in Eugene Onegin is often as heartfelt and emotional as anything Tchaikovsky has composed, but with that customary detached, intellectualised translation of it into pure, precise musical terms.  Consequently, it's utterly gripping when converted into the drama of Onegin, involving the heart as much as the mind.

One couldn't ask for anything more out of the performers - the starkness of the sets allowing the audience to focus solely on the singing without distractions while the lighting supports the emotions and motivations lying behind them.  The singers meet the demands of the roles and the action admirably, Dmitri Hrovostovsky indeed presenting a fine cold, aloof figure in Onegin, contrasted with the fiery passions of Ramn Vargas's Lenski and the romantic purity of Rene Fleming's Tatiana.

On Blu-ray, the staging looks magnificent in its colouration and tones.  The audio is generally fine, but there are a few issues with microphone placements that don't give adequate presence to the voices, neither in the LPCM 2.0 or the DTS HD Master Audio 5.1, though this is only an occasional issue particularly in the first act of the opera.  A 16-minute Behind the Scenes featurette presents an interesting look at the rehearsals for the opera.

3025905,5,B000YCLRBA,"Amazingly, what we have here is an `exercise in reverse'...

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have quite a successful group of singers born bread and trained there, aspiring to take the world's centre operatic stage; those include  in no particular order: Vesselina Kasarova (Mezzo-soprano/alto), Elina Garanca (Mezzo-soprano), Dimitri Hvosostovsky (Baritone), Anna Netrebko (Soprano), Angela Georgiou (Soprano), and not to forget the forerunners of those artists, the magnificent Elena Obraztsova (Mezzo-soprano), the superb Ghena Dimitrova (soprano), the great NIcolai Ghiaurov (Bass), and more.
All of these artists which initially were trained in the former Soviet Union schools of music, took to the Italian and French repertoire - and here was the `straight forward exercise' which they took upon themselves; to try (to various degree of success) to overcome their inherent Slavonic culture-of-the-voice, and without the hinder of the Slavonic trained singing voice to shine in the Italian and French repertoire...True, many of them got their voices trained farther with Italian and French singing teachers later on in their fledgling careers.

The `exercise in reverse' now, is, that two of the greatest western cultured operatic voices, born, bread and trained in the best of the Italian and French culture tradition of the voice, namely, Ramon Vargas (tenor) and Renee Fleming (lyric soprano) would dive nose down into the core of the Russian operatic repertoire - Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin...

Right from the start there is a magnificent sense of correctness in the way by which Renee Fleming
enters the scene as a the romantic teenager, expressing her lines in pure Russian diction and pure lyric-vocal-tone and with the right Russian syllables.
From there on, Tatiana becomes Renee Faming - and Renee flaming on stage becomes Tchaikovsky's and Pushkin's Tatiana...
Most rendering is the `letter aria': this is a complete encompassing scene that demands a command of the singing voice, expressiveness and an amazing ability to act - all of which is greatly fulfilled by Renee Fleming. (One might imagine that Tchaikovsky dedicated the vocal lines here to this singer, to her range of colors and registers - no piercing the stratosphere with high notes above the B flat...)
And mind you - the whole of Tatiana's roll the key to Tatian's character and reasoning hinge on this single impressive scene.
The voice here has a successful mixture of the lyricism, timbre, and correct Russian vowels pronunciation, and the degree of shading of the voice that goes into the lower register here, is correctly tinted with a Slavonic hue.
This scene is guaranteed to make your heart break, and give you a goose-bumps, this, along-side Fleming's (garden scene) where her the acting and facial expression are aimed at giving you a heartache when Onegin lectures her and returns her letter while rejecting her.

Onegin's roll sung by the Russian Baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky (the prime winner of Cardiff-singer-of the-world-competition of some years ago), comes to him naturally and without obvious effort, fitting his physique, stage presence, and his `cool' acting, to the teeth.
Still, there are moments in the last act where Onegin have a change of heart, which asks for just a tad more `remorse', passion, naked laying of emotions - in which Hvorostovsky is a tad too stingy.
One should compare this closing scene between Tatiana and Onegin, with the James Levine 25th anniversary DVD at the Metropolitan - where dramatic baritone Dwayne Croft practically stops the show with his full throat out-burst and breath-control in: ""what humiliation, what anguish, what a tragic fate!"" - to fully understand what is (slightly) missing here with the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky.

Ramon Vargas, which we associate with Puccini and Verdi tenor rolls emerges here as a fine fit to the Russian roll of Lenski dealt to him. His soave tenor voice carries on into the Russian vocalizations and vowels very successfully. His pronunciation is clear and with no obvious hindrance. His acting abilities are equally satisfying in this roll.

The Russian alto/mezzo-soprano Larisa Shevchenko,- gives a specially impressive performance, in the roll of the old nanny; very believable, well sung and well acted and very reliable, specially so, in her duet with Tatians's mother at the very beginning of the opera and later on in the `letter scene' where her interaction with Renee Flemig/Tatiana, at the start of the scene end - when morning breaks in - gives her part a very special sad touch and a great meaning.

The stage set-up - sparsely decorated, clear and almost empty but colorful (the falling leaves that carpet the floor) has an extra edge: it makes the viewer concentrate on the action and draws the viewer into the plot and the mood more easily. It is extremely functional and gives the actors an `instrument' with which to interact (Tatiana playing with the leaves, using a leave in the embarrassing moments of her lake-side scene with Onegin. her letter-scene, and so forth). Everything on the sparsely decorated stage is functional and has its purpose (a rare phenomenon with modern staging).

The stage illumination too has a clear un-exaggerated function which greatly contributes to the filming and details that the cameras capture (this is no half shading `camera obscura' - the way some Blu-ray is made; in semi darkness...)

The sound recording is as perfect as it gets - it capture the orchestral sound and dynamics and the singers voices in a greatly focused proportional way and with a frequency range that is clear, extended - in the best of the Decca tradition.

The conducting, the tempi, the breath and pause, is a marvel:
What a great conductor we find here for the Metropolitan Orchestra and the Tchaikovsky score in the figure of Valery Gergiev...!

The Tchaikovsky musical theme are quite known and melodic - the lines are easy to memorize, but it might take the novice to Tchaikovsky's operas and the manner by which Tchaikovsky takes to the singing voice score and orchestra, a second hearing/viewing of this DVD - just to get it all to sink-in and enjoy.

No doubts that this is one of the very best (possibly THE VERY BEST) of the Blu-ray DVD opera as yet; One of a great stage production, singing, sound - all in all, a marriage of the best possible assemblage of artists which gives meaning to it all.

3025906,5,B000YCLRBA,"Amazingly, what we have here is an `exercise in reverse'...

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have quite a successful group of singers born bread and trained there, aspiring to take the world's centre operatic stage; those include  in no particular order: Vesselina Kasarova (Mezzo-soprano/alto), Elina Garanca (Mezzo-soprano), Dimitri Hvosostovsky (Baritone), Anna Netrebko (Soprano), Angela Georgiou (Soprano), and not to forget the forerunners of those artists, the magnificent Elena Obraztsova (Mezzo-soprano), the superb Ghena Dimitrova (soprano), the great NIcolai Ghiaurov (Bass), and more.
All of these artists which initially were trained in the former Soviet Union schools of music, took to the Italian and French repertoire - and here was the `straight forward exercise' which they took upon themselves; to try (to various degree of success) to overcome their inherent Slavonic culture-of-the-voice, and without the hinder of the Slavonic trained singing voice to shine in the Italian and French repertoire...True, many of them got their voices trained farther with Italian and French singing teachers later on in their fledgling careers.

The `exercise in reverse' now, is, that two of the greatest western cultured operatic voices, born, bread and trained in the best of the Italian and French culture tradition of the voice, namely, Ramon Vargas (tenor) and Renee Fleming (lyric soprano) would dive nose down into the core of the Russian operatic repertoire - Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin...

Right from the start there is a magnificent sense of correctness in the way by which Renee Fleming
enters the scene as a the romantic teenager, expressing her lines in pure Russian diction and pure lyric-vocal-tone and with the right Russian syllables.
From there on, Tatiana becomes Renee Faming - and Renee flaming on stage becomes Tchaikovsky's and Pushkin's Tatiana...
Most rendering is the `letter aria': this is a complete encompassing scene that demands a command of the singing voice, expressiveness and an amazing ability to act - all of which is greatly fulfilled by Renee Fleming. (One might imagine that Tchaikovsky dedicated the vocal lines here to this singer, to her range of colors and registers - no piercing the stratosphere with high notes above the B flat...)
And mind you - the whole of Tatiana's roll the key to Tatian's character and reasoning hinge on this single impressive scene.
The voice here has a successful mixture of the lyricism, timbre, and correct Russian vowels pronunciation, and the degree of shading of the voice that goes into the lower register here, is correctly tinted with a Slavonic hue.
This scene is guaranteed to make your heart break, and give you a goose-bumps, this, along-side Fleming's (garden scene) where her the acting and facial expression are aimed at giving you a heartache when Onegin lectures her and returns her letter while rejecting her.

Onegin's roll sung by the Russian Baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky (the prime winner of Cardiff-singer-of the-world-competition of some years ago), comes to him naturally and without obvious effort, fitting his physique, stage presence, and his `cool' acting, to the teeth.
Still, there are moments in the last act where Onegin have a change of heart, which asks for just a tad more `remorse', passion, naked laying of emotions - in which Hvorostovsky is a tad too stingy.
One should compare this closing scene between Tatiana and Onegin, with the James Levine 25th anniversary DVD at the Metropolitan - where dramatic baritone Dwayne Croft practically stops the show with his full throat out-burst and breath-control in: ""what humiliation, what anguish, what a tragic fate!"" - to fully understand what is (slightly) missing here with the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky.

Ramon Vargas, which we associate with Puccini and Verdi tenor rolls emerges here as a fine fit to the Russian roll of Lenski dealt to him. His soave tenor voice carries on into the Russian vocalizations and vowels very successfully. His pronunciation is clear and with no obvious hindrance. His acting abilities are equally satisfying in this roll.

The Russian alto/mezzo-soprano Larisa Shevchenko,- gives a specially impressive performance, in the roll of the old nanny; very believable, well sung and well acted and very reliable, specially so, in her duet with Tatians's mother at the very beginning of the opera and later on in the `letter scene' where her interaction with Renee Flemig/Tatiana, at the start of the scene end - when morning breaks in - gives her part a very special sad touch and a great meaning.

The stage set-up - sparsely decorated, clear and almost empty but colorful (the falling leaves that carpet the floor) has an extra edge: it makes the viewer concentrate on the action and draws the viewer into the plot and the mood more easily. It is extremely functional and gives the actors an `instrument' with which to interact (Tatiana playing with the leaves, using a leave in the embarrassing moments of her lake-side scene with Onegin. her letter-scene, and so forth). Everything on the sparsely decorated stage is functional and has its purpose (a rare phenomenon with modern staging).

The stage illumination too has a clear un-exaggerated function which greatly contributes to the filming and details that the cameras capture (this is no half shading `camera obscura' - the way some Blu-ray is made; in semi darkness...)

It is very nice to watch a DVD with beautiful scenery; but it is also true that you can get distracted, that is why even the scenography was very simple, I was more focused on the artist's performance, there singing, and acting,  and also the drama, for those reasons I enjoyed so much, the performance of all were super.
I brought Sir Georg Solti's' version a couple of years ago and the scenery was very beautiful, this is an ""advance"" when you make it as a movie, beside, the actors and singers were not the same. I took a while to decide to buy this version, and I am glad I bought this one, I like to see a DVD that the acting and singing were done by the same artists.
An other thing that I enjoyed were the lights , to put an example of the effect of these was the duel scene with the use of claroscuro that made so dramatic, as well as in other passages of the drama . The costumes were very beautiful and the sound wonderful.
This DVD was the first that I bought from the HD Metropolitan Performance series and of course I can see the difference in the images quality compared to other DVD.
This is an outstanding production.",1253404800,2,1445,5.201716738197425
3025910,3,B000YCLRBA,"I placed my order for this opera from one of Amazon' s merchants, expecting to receive a Blu-ray version.

3025911,5,B000YCLRBA,"Ordinarily I avoid operatic productions with minimalist settings and avant garde stage directors like the plague, but this staging of Eugene Onegin by the Metropolitan Opera proved that sparse settings used imaginatively with sympathetic lighting can be very effective and even , dare I say, beautiful. Take the opening scene: to portray the rustic Larin estate, a bare stage thickly strewn with red and gold leaves, in the centre of which two women sit peeling apples, reminiscing about old times and then the appearance of a group of peasants singing in chorus immediately sets the scene in the Russian countryside. The lighting highlights the russet, orange brown hues beautifully and the Hi-Def colour and picture quality are brilliant. I must point out that the costumes are appropriate to the period and very colourful they are too. Simple white chairs in a rectangle are used for the ball at the estate, and a set of ornate chairs for the ball in high society Moscow. The stage is chillingly bare for the duel scene where the protagonist are shown in silhouette; they face each other point their pistols, fire and one falls, very dramatic.
  Dmitri Hvorostovsky, is perfectly cast as Onegin, a handsome, aristocratic figure, completely egocentric and callous of others' feelings, a bored society lion. His rich baritone voice is thrilling to hear and he puts in a commanding performance especially in the final scene.  Ramon Vargas excels as the poetic Lenski and is most impressive in the poignant scene just before the fateful duel, where he sings wistfully about the end of his golden youth, to great ovation from the audience.
  And then there is Renee Fleming. I have to admit having some initial qualms about Fleming cast as Tatiana. Tatiana is a very young maiden, a girl naive and innocent yearning for love and an idealised hero, a Juliette figure in essence. I would have thought that Fleming would be too mature a figure to carry it off. But carry it off she did and with great aplomb. She had me believing she was a moody teenager, head in the clouds or buried in romantic novels pining for love. The scene in the bedroom with her nanny is touching as is the next where she gushes forth all her feelings in a reckless letter to Onegin. And when Onegin confronts her to politely but coldly reject her, her facial expression tells it all: humiliation, anguish and a hope that the earth would swallow her up. Fabulous acting. Superlative singing. And of course the climactic scene where she tears herself from Onegin at last professing his love for her, realising that happiness was so close but quite impossible to attain, and that the past is past. The title of the opera may be Eugene Onegin but this one is all about Tatiana and Renee Fleming. What a triumph.",1250208000,7,2779,4.805439330543933

3025918,4,B000YCLRBA,"I gave this version of Onegin 4 stars because, in spite of the outstanding performance by Dmitry Hvorostovsky and Valery Gergiev, one that thoroughly revealed the greatness of Tchaikovsky's score, the rest of the cast, in my opinion, did not fully reach that level of perfection. Renee Fleming has a gorgeous voice, her pitch is perfect but at moments in the first act she acts too much as a grown-up woman rather than as a sixteen-year-old Tatyana. Tatyana finds her emotional turmoil inexplicable until she discovers that she is in love (Pouring water on herself is a bit  extreme, particularly for a very young Russian country girl). However, Fleming is superb in the last scene of the opera. That scene is unforgettable. It takes one's breath away. Fleming and Hvorostovsky not only sing brilliantly, they succeed in making one forget that this is a stage and not real life, they are totally identified with their characters.  No one else comes close to that level of performance. Olga is excellent, but she and Vargas do not make a credible couple. I find his Russian pronounciation not good, and his Lenski aria is too full of Italianate rubato and  sentimentality. In my opinion, that aria is one of the most beautiful and profound in the repertoire. It, by the way, is beautifully and expressively played by the cello soloist in the introduction to the duel scene.

 Other artists in this recording who do total justice to their role are Larisa Shevchenko (""nyanya"") and Sergei Aleksashkin (Prince Gremin).
Shevchenko sings beautifully, has a warm personality, and is a kind and devoted nyanya. Sergei Aleksashkin's version of his aria is the best I have heard. The tempo is excellent, his voice is rich and of accurate pitch, and his delivery soberly conveys nobility of sentiment.",1232323200,6,1790,4.9335548172757475
3025919,5,B000YCLRBA,"Quite often Eurotrash directors gleefully subvert the intentions of the original composer and librettist. Stage directions are ignored, and singers are encouraged to perform actions on stage that run contrary to the actions clearly suggested in the music. Extraneous characters run to and fro, and the mise-en-scne is so radically different than anything ever imagined by the opera's creators that you literally cannot figure out what the story's about. Sometimes such innovative Regietheater can be great fun or even revealing, but 90% of the time it's pretentious nonsense, a perverse and often childish amplification of subtexts. After years of this crud, the Eurostrashcan (aided and often led by Ameritrashers) is crammed with boring ""avant-garde"" cliches(which should be an oxymoron). Over 100 of these production disasters can be purchased on standard DVD videos here at Amazon.com.

Among the more acceptable malifactors is the director of this fine ""Onegin,"" Robert Carsen, aided and abetted by set-and-costume designer Michael Levine. Plenty of stupid eliminations and additions occur in this production, but the leaf-covered, furniture-cramped-then- empty-spaced Postmodern settings are often visually beautiful in this video, and the principals are rather wonderful -- especially the silken-throated, sexually charismatic baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky (who, as they like to say, ""IS"" Onegin""), soprano Rene Fleming (at her best as Tatiana), and tenor Ramn Vargas (who sings gloriously and looks exactly like Lenski). Valery Gergiev conducts authoritatively. The widescreen Blu-ray image looks fabulous -- and the sound is spacious and thrilling. This DVD is an edit of the live HD transmission seen in theaters, live from the Met. One hopes all the Met's HD transmissions (for better or for worse) will be available in this exciting new Blu-ray format.

Among the more destructive Blu-ray offerings are the perfectly dreadful Opus Arte ""Norma"" (turned into a trivial backstage melodrama), the obfuscatory DG ""Le Nozze di Figaro"" from Salzburg (in which even the conducting is bad), an absurdly vulgar Arthaus ""Rigoletto"" (not too bad musically, however), and an interesting but ultimately dreary minimalist Harmoni Mundi ""Don Giovanni"" (conducted by Rene Jacobs and containing some fine singing with added ornamentations not specificed by Mozart). The crazy mixed-up DG ""Manon"" is actually fun with its looney concept which keeps Anna Netrebko self-consciously evolving through various personae including Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Ingrid Bergman.

Hvorostovsky and Fleming are ideal as Onegin and Tatiana The stark set, indeed a ""non-set"", is at first disappointing, but does succeed in focusing attention on the human drama instead of toward lavish production elements. Color is used very effectively to saturate each scene and outline the singers. This production no doubt benefited from the close scrutiny of the camera because the performances were finely tuned and sublty nuanced. As an example, the usual ""dance spectacle"" accompanying the Polonaise which opens Act III is replaced here by Onegin attended to by his valet staff while changing from dueling attire to formal dress. Although I enjoy a lavish production as much as anyone, it was refreshing to experience a concept which focuses primarily on the protagonists. This would not work with less than world-class principals.",1215820800,7,928,5.23489932885906
3025924,5,B000YCLRBA,"This is by far the best rendition of ""Eugene Onegin"" that has ever been issued on DVD.
The production by Robert Carson is stunning, even without a lot of scenery.  Carson's staging is interesting and imaginative; the lighting is very good, as well.

Even though a stupendous singers set was gathered for this performance it did not necessarily guarantee it's amazing success. This dreamed cast is formed by three of the most talented singers of our time: Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Rene Flemming and Ramn Vargas.

The staging is minimalist however absolutely accurate and tasty. By adding different intelligent elements the drama flows both naturally and flawlessly, in other words impeccable. The Russian Maestro Valery Gergiev conducted the MET orchestra with full commitment and passion.
The Siberian baritone Dmitri Hvorsotovsky is enormous as Onegin completely understanding the character and making it his own. Needless to say he is at his best here, both vocally and dramatically; I don't see anyone at this moment to be a match for him in this roll.
Rene Flemming is tremendous as Tatiana, she is simply perfect. Her acquaintance with Hvorostovsky is impressing.
Ramn Vargas as Lensky is memorable, precise and passionate confirming his position as one of the more reliable tenors of his generation. His ""Kuda, kuda"" was performed effortlessly with real suffering and pain.
Elena Zaremba portrays a charming Olga with no less intelligence and knowledge of her role.
The secondary roles are covered more than efficiently.

Fleming's Tatiana dovetails this as a convincing ingnue in Act 1 leading to the honour-bound wife of Act 3.  Her warm lyrical soprano producing a moving 'letter scene'.

3025931,4,B000YCLRBA,"REVIEW OF PUSHKIN'S ONEGIN

The very talented cast is up to performing with passion Pushkin's Onegin, however Elena Zaremba would have been much better suited playing Tatiania's Mother and the more youthful looking Mother, Olga.

I do feel that Carsen's staging is a big disappointment to both the cast and certainly to the audience as well.  It was a great distraction from the performances. One has to ask if Michael Levine has a prejudice against presenting Russian culture in his stage scenes.  Two steel pipes and a stage strewn with leaves, does not make a birch forest in a Russian countryside.  And what would it have cost production to have two pillars in the backdrop and a chandelier hanging from the center stage to convey a ballroom scene in St. Petersburg?  The stark eclectic staging of Onegin is something only a Stalinist could appreciate.

I had considered seeing Onegin when it came to Chicago in March but after noting it was a Carsen-Levine staging I opted to buy the DVD and am so very glad I did so.  I saved over $280.  The performances are great despite the drab setting they were compelled to perform in.  Supreme talent outshines a mediocre production.

J. Ray",1206921600,7,1187,4.769607843137255
3025932,5,B000YCLRBA,"Having seen this production at the MET and HD transmission to the movies, this DVD is outstanding in every way and highly recommended as a worthy addition to your collection. For those who have seen the production at the MET, it will enhance your enjoyment of the individual performances with close-ups of facial expressions of singers and other interesting nuances and other little amusing things you might have missed if you were seated far from the stage. This DVD is specially beneficial to those seeing this opera for the first time because of the elimination of extraneous and distracting things, which allows you to focus on the dramatic and musical  inputs of the protagonists more clearly.

Having seen conventional, lavish productions of this opera in major houses, I had some apprehensions at first about how Act 3 would turn out stripped of the customary depiction of the opulence and splendor of St. Petersburg in Pushkin's time. With bare walls and just a few nice chairs around, the fantastic lighting effects and elegant coustumes made a big difference and saved this production from getting too ""eurotrashy"".

For me, the most important achievement of this production is the righting of the unfair characterization by critics, past and present, of the role of the poet Lenski as the ""weakest link"" among the principals. From  the very first time I saw this opera, I have always felt that Lenski's music was the most beautiful in the opera and that Tchaikovsky identified more with Lenski's creative nature. So, why the ""weakest link"" tag ? This production  provided the answer! That's why this minimalist ONEGIN is particularly helpful to first timers to the opera. By combining Acts 2 & 3 and eliminating the long intermission between the Acts & scenes as well as toning down the distracting, unnecessary elements extraneous to the story, this production allows the audience to focus not only on individual performances but the totality of their artistic contributions as well. In full lavish productions, Lenski dies at the end of Act 2. He is given a courtesy solo bow, and his night is done. After a 20-minute intermission or longer, a shot of vodka, champagne or margarita, the audience is ushered back to their seats for the beginning of Act 3. When the curtain opens, the audience is greeted by the majestic polonaise  with elegantly dressed and bejewelled ladies of St. Petersburg's upper crust society, dancers and entertainers at Prince Gremin's palatial digs. The audience then gets to hear his beautiful aria  and Onegin's two-minute arioso. Another time break for scene change, and then the final scene with Tatiana and Onegin culminating with the histrionics of their dysfunctional love relationship. End of opera - about one and a half hours after Lenski' death. Poor Lenski is a forgotten man by then. But not in this production! Here, after his death, he goes back to his dressing room, have coffee or something stronger (Bjoerling used to do it,why not), and half an hour later, he goes out on stage to receive the audience's feedback with the rest of the cast. That's
the way it should be, and the composer would have loved it.

This DVD may not be surpassed for a long time. The cast is just outstanding, from the three principals who are all at their best, down the line to Lenski's second at the duel scene. Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky will be very hard to top as Tatiana and Onegin because, not only do they possess beautiful voices and fine acting abilities, they also must have spent a lot of time studying and rehearsing together. It shows in their chemistry. Ramon Vargas gave the most vivid portrayal of the poet's persona that I have ever witnessed, and his subtle, well controlled and very effective acting  covered a wide gamut of emotions from the lyrical Act 1 through varying degrees of distrust, jealousy and anger, and the heartbreaking resignation in Act 2. He even introduced a little humor in the middle of his ardent declaration of chaste love to the seated Olga by gently pushing the tray of goodies away from her to get her full attention. I missed that one in the theater, and I'm thankful for the DVD. His voice was absolutely gorgeous, and his singing superb throughout. His arioso in Act1 is just as beautiful as Onegin's aria at the end of the act. For some strange reason, Hvorostovsky received only a polite audience response with no bravos. I thought he gave a flawless and terrific rendition of the aria. In Act 2 Scene 1, Vargas dominated the singing in his reprimand of Olga for her flirting with Onegin, his private confrontation with Onegin and the escalation ending in throat grabbing before the guests. He opened the  big quintet with chorus  with a tender and touching recollection of the happiness he found at the Larin's home as an adolescent and ended the ensemble with a powerful, pained farewell to his beloved Olga. Lenski's aria Act2 Scene2, as sublimely sung by Vargas and lovingly accompanied by the great Met Orchestra under the super conductor of choice, Valery Gergiev, is one for the ages. Vargas just simply dominated all of Act 2. Renee Fleming dominated Act 1 with her wonderful, well nuanced Letter Scene which was warmly received by the audience.

So, is the ""weakest link"" going to steal the show from the Star?  After Act3 Scene1, Lenski was still ahead in my tally. DH was in his best voice, and that's a lot. He must deliver the best performance of his life to catch the poet. Fleming could pass him too if he didn't. Fueled by Fleming's incredible acting and singing, which I have never seen from her before, he caught fire in the last six minutes, and the rest is history. He nailed that last note like Rigoletto's anguished maledezione with all the power and pathos he could muster. My verdict: it's a 3-way tie ! When Vargas came out for curtain calls , the audience did not forget the pleasures he had given them and gave him back a tremendous ovation with confetti as they did the other two stars. Aren't we blessed to have three stars of this caliber with an excellent group of supporting singers, the best opera orchestra in the world under the direction of the genius from St. Petersburg?

And Vargas... awesome. No matter his latin presence... his singing was perfectly. After the ""Kuda, kuda, kuda vi udalilis..."" is sad and a pity that Lensky is going to die and with him this liric sound and nearly perfect technique.

3025935,5,B000YCLRBA,"The productions of Robert Carsen, though usually informed by an individual style, tend to be predictable only for their being polarizing. When his approach jells (when he has not decided that, say, IL TROVATORE should be a searing indictment of the petrochemical industry), one sees a kind of minimalism that (pace the editorial review above) is quite the opposite of ""stark."" Carsen has the talent and the insight to do well what some of his lesser contemporaries do badly. He knows that the bare minimum of props and subtle shifts in lighting and color in place of traditional stagecraft can lend a production mechanical ease and fluidity while in no way precluding lyric beauty or kinetic energy. A poignant tone is set for this ONEGIN by the literally autumnal look of its first half: during the prelude, the bereft Onegin is showered in brown and orange leaves that remain on the stage for the next several scenes. When the peasants pay tribute to Larina with a joyous rustic dance, it is not a meticulously choreographed display of grace and athleticism (as later dances, in more formal and sophisticated settings, will be) -- it looks chaotic, spontaneous, even amateurish, just as such a demonstration would be if one were in the village observing it. The early-morning duel between Onegin and Lensky is masterfully staged. The two men sing their respective interior monologues in preparation for the deadly showdown neither wants, and each reaches his hand out in the direction of the other, from a distance that is slight yet unbridgeable. The staging makes clear that this is a representational and not a literal gesture, and the moment is heartbreaking. The subsequent silhouetted portrayal of Lensky's shooting, followed by the bright sun rising on Onegin, his soul irreparably stained, is both arresting and haunting.

But Carsen's greatest triumph is his demonstration of what usually is an asset even in his unsuccessful productions: an eye for subtext, and an ability to tease it out without assaulting his audience with it. This ONEGIN is not, as ONEGIN often is made to be, simply a tale of two people who would be a good match but have unfortunately misaligned timing; nor is it about a contemptible snob who gets his comeuppance in the end. Carsen astutely takes his cue from the first conversation we hear in the opera, that between Mother Larina and the nanny Filippyevna, both of whom loved and were loved passionately in youth but were led by pragmatism, duty, or necessity down a different path. ""Heaven sends us habit instead of happiness,"" observes Larina, and in the next two and a half hours we will see our heroine, Tatyana, assume her place among these women. Along with habit, heaven can send us heartbreak.

In the principal roles, Rene Fleming, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, and Ramn Vargas are in sovereign voice, and the soprano in particular is a revelation. I will confess that while her work in the past has hardly been thoughtless, I did not believe she had a performance of such behavioral specificity and dramatic perception in her (accompanying mini-doc footage suggests a fruitful partnership between her, Hvorostovsky, and Peter McClintock, director of this 2007 revival of Carsen's production). From the opera's opening through the birthday party, Fleming precisely evokes an ingenuous and romantic young person on the precipice of womanhood: a gesture or expression of distinctly girlish excitement or impulsivity may be followed in short order by one that is more wistful or circumspect, suggesting the woman she will become. Her work has a marvelous reactive spontaneity. When Tatyana reappears in the opera's final two scenes as a society woman of refinement and reserve, we are right there with Onegin in admiring the transformation, but we (like Fleming, Carsen, and McClintock) know that while something precious has been gained, something equally precious has been extinguished, or at least will never burn so brightly again: zest, eagerness, trust, innocence. Heaven has brought something, and heaven has taken something in payment.

Hvorostovsky, who has performed the title role with distinction for many years, recently has indicated a readiness to set it aside -- in that event, we are fortunate now to have deluxe documentation of his late thoughts on the character to supplement his earlier ones (on the Bychkov/Philips audio recording). It would be difficult to imagine a more ideal match of singer with character than Hvorostovsky with this vain, preeningly handsome, emotionally careless (but never uncaring) protagonist. Another of Carsen's shrewd touches, deftly enacted by Hvorostovsky, is to have Onegin barely pay attention to Lensky's initial round of charges at the birthday party. At a point when Onegin still has a window in which to defuse tension and avert tragedy, he does not even look at his angry friend; he remains seated, smirking and downing food and drink as if he is Giovanni patronizing a desperate Elvira. As has been noted elsewhere, Vargas's build, clothing, coif, and spectacles give this Lensky a striking (and apt, if intended) physical resemblance to another fragile, doomed poet/artist, Franz Schubert. Vargas is not the actor that his co-stars are, and is less comfortable with the Russian language than is any other featured singer on the stage, but when such gratifying lyric singing as his represents the weakest link, we obviously are dealing with a roster of unusual depth. Elena Zaremba (Olga) and especially Sergei Aleksashkin (a Gremin who quite looks the part) maintain the high musical standard; in smaller roles, Svetlana Volkova (Larina) and Larisa Shevchenko (Filippyevna) make their crucial points with warmth and appeal.

Celebrity maestros often are fascinating to watch at work for their varying methods: Karajan's eyes-closed shamanistic sculpting; Bernstein's emotional and occasionally overwrought balletic demonstrations; Muti's solemn-faced aristocratic precision; Abbado's genial coaxing and nudging; Carlos Kleiber's exuberant elasticity; Richard Strauss's minimalist economy of means. And then, on some quite different list, there is Valery Gergiev, one of the least fetching conductors in terms of gesture and expression  I have ever seen. The best description I can offer of his batonless technique to someone who has never seen it: imagine the imitation of a flamboyantly effeminate sorcerer by someone who despises that sorcerer. But however he chooses to communicate, he is no impediment to the Met Orchestra's predictably sumptuous reading of Tchaikovsky's score. The conductor's only truly questionable judgments are the taffy-pulling of Triquet's number (the tenor singing Triquet is obliged to serenade Tatyana at the slowest tempo I have ever heard in the piece, and then, as if to make up for lost time, the chorus's admiring responses are rushed -- it is rather like the release of a slingshot), and a too-hectic tempo for the dance music in the penultimate scene. On the whole, this ONEGIN deserves placement alongside the Scotto/Domingo MANON LESCAUT, the Troyanos TROYENS, and select others among the finest Met performances yet preserved for home viewing.",1202601600,11,7182,5.258064516129032

 Stunning Performances by the principals., Jan 3 2008
By  Hazel Smith (Sudbury, Ontario, Canada) - See all my reviews

I saw the HD presentation in 2007 and was so impressed that I went back for the encore two weeks later. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the Met would get a dvd of the production out so fast. I pre-ordered 2 copies the minute it was advertised. I am a devoted fan of Renee Fleming and she didn't disappoint; nor did Dmitri Hvorostovsky. Ramon Vargas was in excellent voice. The setting(for me) emphacized the isolation of the Russian steppe-vast landscape with few people. The ballroom scenes, with chairs hemming everyone in, seemed to symbolize the constrictions of conventional society. I know some people objected to the minimalist nature of the sets, but they worked for me and underlined some important facets of the opera. Aside from the glorious singing and acting, I loved watching Valery Gergiev conduct. The bonus features backstage were great. Thanks to Robert Carsen for another fabulous production. I've watched my dvd twice already. I just can't get enough of the ""letter scene"", the ""polonaise"", or the final duet. Enjoy!!!!!",1200873600,3,1221,4.946341463414634

It's painful to watch, and the performance breaks your heart in more ways than one.",1200787200,16,365,5.05
3025941,5,B000YCLRBA,"My wife and I watched this performance from the Grand Tier. At the time, we agreed that the staging and performance were superb, and the cameras were unobtrusive, but thought that some of the performances, notably that of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, were a tad 'wooden'.

A few months later, we saw the broadcast performance, and were very pleasantly surprised. Hvorostovsky's performance was far from wooden: with the benefits of the TV camera, we could see every subtle nuance, every expression, every gesture. His was a performance of the highest standard. Bravo!

And here we find one of the differences between televised and live performances - the camera can pick up subtleties which just aren't visible from the back of the theatre (and exaggerate 'operatic acting'as it happens). True, watching a live performance has other advantages - the ambience, the freedom to choose what you want to look at, people-watching, the champagne during the intervals....

In the past, there have been other differences - poor direction, inadequate sound, extraneous noise, but this is no longer an issue. This Brian Large production is basically superb! Picture quality is excellent, reflecting the clever lighting effects on stage. Sound is crystal clear, with enough resolution to distinguish individual applause (ours must have been in there somewhere, I suppose). This recording, in many respects, is even better than the 'real thing'.

Putting technicalities to one side, the production itself was of the highest calibre. All the singers, without exception, were at the top of their form. Aria after aria ended in thunderous applause. Gergiev was amazing, extracting every ounce of emotion from Tchaikowsky's music.

The minimalist sets were, I thought, very clever. I particularly liked the first ballroom scene, where the dancers were crowded together in a slightly too small dance floor flanked by mis-matched chairs. The effect was of an impromptu ball run by a family who were comfortably off, but a little down-at-heel. The leaves, as a symbol of time passing, were very effective, particularly during the overture.

And now, I think, enough time has passed.

3025943,4,B000YCLRBA,"I am a big fan of Eugene Onegin and watched this opera several times at various opera houses, including once at Bolshoi (the ""old"" Bolshoi of 1980s). Therefore, I have had quite high expectations after seeing parts of this performance on TV a few months ago. Yesterday, after the DVD arrived in the mail, I could barely wait to get home to watch it. Honestly, I was disappointed.  Please do not get me wrong. This production is still very good, just it is not the ultimate Eugene Onegin I hoped it would be. Hvorostovsky is outstanding, he is definitely the best Onegin I ever heard. At the same time, Fleming as Tatiana is not as good as I expected. After watching this DVD, I listened for a while to my old CD set with Galina Vishnevskaya as Tatiana (Bolshoi, recorded in 1950s), and in my opinion Vishnevskaya's singing is highly superior to that of Fleming. Also, maybe a factor was the awful quality of the English translation, which totally emasculates the rich Pushkin poetry.  Sometimes I had the feeling Fleming had no idea what was the real meaning of the words she was singing, and it really spoiled the impression of her acting (wrong gestures, wrong expressions). At times, like in the middle of the first act (Onegin and Tatiana returning from their walk), she seemed not to know what to do and, rather than acting, was looking intently at Hvorostovsky for clues. This was disappointing. Overall, this is a good performance, and Hvorostovski is absolutely brilliant.

Dmitri Hvorostovsky previously sung a CD version in the late 1990's with Nuccia Focile as Tatyanna. I would say with 100% certainty that this MET production's Onegin and Tatyanna topped the previous version. Baritones are like wine; in the case of Hvorostovsky, exceedingly good wine. I remember well the last parting scene of the two protagonists in this production - devastating is the only description I could think of.
Fleming and DH were like being engaged in a vocal dual, each singing and acting their hearts out. Their proficiency simply unblievable. I strongly recommend this recording to students undertaking operatic training.
Ramon Vargas delivered an aria (""Kuda, Kuda"") that earned him an applause for well-nigh 2 minutes. He is in his absolute prime in this performance.

For those who don't know, the moviecast was a live performance of a matinee at the Met in New York shown in movie theatres across the country; it had almost all the excitement of being in the Met itself for this unforgettable performance. I just wish I too had a program to tear up and rain confetti down on the singers as the audience at the Met did. Yes, it was that great a performance.

This is a lushly romantic opera about unrequited love and deserves to be far better known than it is.

As for the performance, it's one for the ages and I count myself lucky to have seen the moviecast. I agree with the previous reviewer about the spare sets not always doing justice to the intent of the opera, but the performances are so stellar, it really doesn't matter.

3260340,5,B000YCLRBA,"Anyone making a short list of the all time greatest operas needs to give serious consideration to Eugene Onegin. Not only is this opera filled with beautiful melodies, it also contains a very dramatic story told episodically, almost as a tableaux of grand scenes. The story is unconventional in that the lovers never get together because they are never on the same page romantically, initially he is too mature for her, then, later, ironically, when he finally becomes interested, she is too mature for him. There is death in this opera, but the real tragedy of Eugene Onegin is the title character's self-centered, unfeeling hubris, and finally his regrets. All of this is expressed through music so achingly romantic it washes over the listener like a wave. Anyone who thinks Tchaikovsky was just a composer of pretty ballets has obviously never seen or heard Eugene Onegin.

I saw this production when it was broadcast to a local cineplex earlier this year. I was so enthralled and excited by what I had experienced(I was high on this performance for days!) that I have been anxiously waiting for it to be released on DVD ever since. The production itself isn't perfect, but the performances are(the Met repeats the success of its La Traviata of a few years ago by reuniting the same three leads with the same conductor), and the result is a Eugene Onegin whose like we are unlikely to see again, at least during my lifetime.

The leads could not be more ideally cast. Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky are what is popularly referred as the complete package, a combination of knockout looks, intelligence, charisma, dramatic ability, oh, and did I forget to mention vocal talent? Hvorostovsky broods handsomely, and his icy detachment is chilling, abetted in no small measure by the depth of his baritone voice. His Onegin is easy to fall in love with, but hard to feel much sympathy for, at least until the end, which is how it should be. Fleming is quite a bit older than Tatianna, but is still youthfully lovely, and capable of exploring the young innocent's tormented emotions. Besides, her age and experience make her character's eventual maturation into a regal and sophisticated woman of the world that much more convincing. Fleming's mood-swinging, ultimately giddy Letter Scene brings down the house,(remember, when I saw this it was in a movie theater, watching the performance via satellite, and the result was just as overpowering). Ramon Vargas has the impassioned, jealous tenor thing down pat, he obviously draws on his experience singing Alfredo, and he makes for a fiery Lensky. The mezzo-soprano who sings Olga(I don't recall her name) is attractive and appropriately flirty. Musically, I'd rate this performance as flawless. Conductor Valery Gergiev's deep understanding of this score is obvious, so is his equally deep love for it.

The production is mostly good, but with some problems. For instance, I don't understand why Tatianna's bed is placed in the middle of the outdoors other than to give her an excuse to fling leaves across the stage at the climax of the Letter Scene. Maybe this is supposed to represent how her writing the letter is her liberation from confinement...if so, well, it works better conceptually than visually. And the ballroom scenes are minimalist to the extreme, lacking any grandeur, which attenuates the effectiveness of the staging. Certain operas, such as Traviata and this one, should always be opulent(this director could take a few lessons from Franco Zefferelli), no matter how modernist operas in general become, because the opulence is an important element of the storytelling. Onegin is supposed to be distanced from and bored by the bourgeois spectacle he sees, by the aristocratic circles he finds himself traveling in, and their values,  but this is hard to convey when there isn't any bourgeois spectacle to be bored BY. My feeling, this is minimalism without any understanding of the subtexts of the opera, minimalism for its own sake, just to do something different, an attempt to add intimacy to a scene that isn't really supposed to be intimate. On a positive note, the opening scene is superb, as are the scenes where Onegin rebuffs Tatianna's affections and their final intimate drawing room duet. The duel, staged completely in shadows, is rather unsettling. Here the creepy minimalism makes perfect sense, and the result is one of the most effective opera scenes I've seen in recent memory. For the most part the production works, despite being disappointing in places, at the very least it never distracts from the performances, which might sound like a left-handed compliment but is a compliment nonetheless.

One more thing, concerning the price. I was tempted to knock off a star due to the fact that Deutsche Grammophon has chosen to release this as a two disc set even though the opera is only about two-and-a-half hours long and therefore capable of fitting on one. I have the same complaint about the upcoming I Puritani, which I saw when it was broadcast on PBS, also an excellent performance, very much worth owning, but also short enough to fit on a single disc. Obviously I'm planning to suck it up(for Onegin, and perhaps for Puritani as well) and shell out the money because the idea of not owning this is unthinkable, but in the meantime, color me disgruntled. In the end, though, I have decided to rate the performance, not the price, in which case the five stars is well deserved.",1195948800,144,5477,4.961873638344227

Ms. Fleming ably portrays Tatyana from a innocent young girl in the flush of her first love, heartbroken when Onegin coldly rejects her (her tears in this scene seem real and his cold superiority leaps off the screen), to mature self contained woman when Onegin sees her years later after she is married to a Prince. Only then is Onegin attracted to her and the roles are reversed. She is aloof and he is giddy like a young boy in his first love. I won't tell you how it ends, watch it! :) The whole cast is excellent and the two leads are in particularly fine voice here. Valery Ghergiev really pulls the pathos and drama of Tchaikovsky's music from the Met orchestra and the staging is minimal yet charming. A must for any opera lover",1433894400,4,963,4.604651162790698

3260346,3,B000YCLRBA,"This is a distressing video of Tchaikovsky's great opera.
It is a fine production in musical terms, with generally excellent singing and an impassioned, well-paced performance from conductor Valery Gergiev. Dmitri Hvorostovsky demonstrates why he is one of the leading protagonists of the title role, with beautiful singing and powerful acting. Renee Fleming is a lovely Tatiana. She handles the vocal demands with aplomb; dramatically, she manages girlishness in the early going without embarrasing herself, and she is nicely regal in Act III. Ramn Vargas brings a lovely lyric tenor to Lensky's part and acts convincingly. Fleming and Vargas are the only non-Russians in the cast; they seem comfortable with the language, though I can't comment on the quality of their diction. The two larger supporting roles are less good. Elena Zaremba looks too old for Olga, and her singing is a bit rough. Sergei Aleksashin as Gremin certainly understands his beautiful aria, but his pitches are rather wooly. The small roles are well-cast.
Unfortunately, all these good things are sabotaged by Robert Carsen's preposterous production. I realize that the stage director is treated like a deity in today's operatic world. But it is too bad that ""concept""productions are inflicted on operas which are firmly bound to a specific time and place for their setting. ""Yevgeny Onegin"" is all about imperial Russia, and the more authentic detail the better. Here we have characters in beautiful period costumes acting on a minimalist ""non-set"". The vast Met stage is made into a cavernous room, with actual walls at the back and sides, and virtually all the action takes place in a small central area of this huge space. This creates a number of absurdities, of which I'll list three that reduced me to laughter:
1. During the entire first act the stage is for some reason covered with fake autumn leaves. For the Letter Scene, Tatiana's bedroom sits in the middle of this leafy expanse. Since Filipyevna has to leave the scene before Tatiana starts writing, she exits via - you guessed it - a trapdoor! (She uses it again when she re-enters.)
2. For the ball scene in Act II the playing space is delineated by a rectangular arrangement of chairs. During the opening waltz the chorus and dancers are crammed into this space like sardines in a can and can scarcely move. To add to the silliness, the women freeze in poses while the men sing, and vice versa.
3. A composer usually has good musical and dramatic reasons to end an act where he does. Act II ends with the duel between Onegin and Lensky. Act III is set some years later in Prince Gremin's palace and opens with the guests dancing to a brilliant polonaise. In this production Act II runs into Act III without a break. As the polonaise begins, Lensky's corpse is still lying onstage. Eventually a group of servants carries the tenor into the wings while another group removes Onegin's costume and dresses him in a new one, in full view of the audience. (Perhaps someone wanted to admire Hvorostovsky's bare torso ...) This was simply jaw-droppingly ridiculous.
Carsen has apparently convinced many people that he is a genius. He is not. He is a charlatan who regularly demolishes great operatic works. This particular piece of directorial self-indulgence does nothing but distract from the fine singing and acting that is going on.
I'd have to give this DVD three stars for the musical values. Perhaps you could watch it with the picture turned off.
The 1984 Kirov production on Kultur is less impressive cinematically, but it is a beautiful, traditional staging, with wonderful singing and conducting.",1422230400,4,3643,4.9639934533551555

  Problem is Brian Large, whose direction is better at Pique Dame 2007 in St Petersburg.

No one can deny the top scene of Onegin is the duel  and Lensky 's ""Kuda?"", may be the best romantic  non-clichet-tenor aria.
  Well , once Lensky is dead ,we see a sun which pretended to be Petersburg Midnightsummer but seemed instead as an Arizona's twilight for a cold killer  named Onegin.
Pushkin gives a gap of time between duel and Onegin return.  Nevertheless, we are taken instantaneously to  Onegin having his cloth changed (to show Barihunk shirtless?) for the last ball, meanwhile Lensky's corpse is taken away.

  PORTUGUES: Nao li os 79 elogios de 5 estrelas. Adoro Tchaikovsky e me acostumei com licenas minimalistas , que talvez admitam qualquer simbolismo.
Apesar do pobre e compreensvel cenrio, cantores, orquestra, toda a msica est esplndida.
  O problema seria talvez Brian Large, que, em Petersburgo 2007, dirigiu melhor a Dama de Espadas.
  Ningum negaria que o ponto alto de Onegin  o duelo e a ria ""Kuda"" de Lensky, talvez a melhor e menos clich das rias romnticas para tenor.
  Bem, assim que Lensky morre,  vemos um sol que talvez fingia ser a meia-noite de Petersburgo, mas mais parece um ocaso no Arizona, para um assassino frio chamado  Onegin.  Pushkin d um tempo entre o duelo e a volta de Onegin.
Entretanto ,somos levados instantaneamente a Onegin a trocar de roupa ( para mostrar o bartono sem camisa?) para o baile final, enquanto o cadver de Lensky  levado.

3260366,5,B000YCLRBA,"Last October I saw the Metropolitan Operas new production of EUGENE ONEGIN in its HD movie theater showing.  The performance featured Mariusz Kwiechen as Onegin, Anna Netrebko as Tatiana, and Piotr Beczala as Lensky.  Though the realistic production was meticulously directed and acted and often beautifully sung, it didn't affect me emotionally the way the Mets previous production of EUGENE ONEGIN, which this DVD captures in a 2007 performance, does.  For me, the 2007 ONEGIN is virtually definitive.

Stylistically, the settings are abstract while the costumes are traditional (they seem to be from the period of the original poems composition, the 1820's).  The poetic introductory sequence, with Onegin sitting alone on a bench remembering the past while autumn leaves swirl around him, is one visual highlight; another is the transition from Act II to Act III, with a despondent Onegin being readied for the ball by his servants.  Vocally, the cast is almost uniformly excellent (I say almost because Elena Zarembas matronly-looking Olga is afflicted by a distressing wobble).  Renee Fleming as Tatiana is here at her late-prime best, pure of voice and convincingly youthful in appearance even though she was 48 years old at the time.  Ramon Vargas as Lensky is not as intense or idiomatic as was Beczala, but his poet is sincerely acted and beautifully sung in a basically bel-canto manner.  Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Onegin is, in a word, perfect: elegant of voice as of appearance, charismatic yet cynical, and ultimately heartbreaking.

 There is no bad singing, in this rendition. Everyone did a more than acceptable job.

 The only issue I have is the scenery choices. Rather than realistic backdrops, we are treated to a box, the projected colors and floor textures of which change, as the scenes change. Odd but it worked.

3260380,5,B000YCLRBA,This is a stunning production and Fleming and Hvorostovsky are perfect. I think it is one of the best opera DVD's available.,1368230400,3,124,4.681818181818182
3260381,5,B000YCLRBA,"Onegin is contemptible. A self-pitying narcissist, Don Giovanni without even the false nobility of defiance. On one hand, one can be gratified that the tale includes no Faustian Repentence/Redemption, so beloved of 19th C adolescence. On the other, one can feel aggrieved that the despicable jerk doesn't end the opera with a suicide. And that leaves the key question: why did such asinine heroes appeal to Romantic writers, composers, and audiences, from Goethe's mawkish Werther almost to the present?

Alexander Puskin's poem is a revered classic of Russian literature. Unfortunately, I can't read Russian and therefore have no idea how closely or amply the opera libretto by Tchaikovsky and Shilovsky represents the poem. The libretto is stock Victorian melodrama. That doesn't, of course, distinguish it from many other popular 19th and early 20th C operas, most of which depend on passionate music to rescue their stories from banality.

Is Tchaikovsky's music passionate enough? Forgive me, dear reader, but to my ears it's mere humdrum bandshell Heldenwhoopy. The only portion of the opera that affects me emotionally is the soliloquy of the poet Lenski as he confronts his almost-certain death in a duel with his ""friend"" Onegin. Lenski is another Romantic caricature, a fool but a likable one. The role is sung and acted, on this DVD, by Ramn Vargas; both acting and singing are superb enough to justify the whole 156 minutes of the production. It's the singing and acting that earn my five-star rating of the DVD, rather than the opera per se. Dmitri Hvorostovsky is the very avatar of the arrogant selfish Onegin. Rene Fleming makes herself believable both as the puppy-love provincial maiden Tatiana and as the mature self-dominating faithful wife Tatiana. Extraordinary singing can redeem almost any mawkish text.

And the ""film"" is beautiful. Fleming and Hvorostovsky are sensual bliss in close-ups. The ""sets"" are utterly minimal -- a floor covered with scattered autumn leaves, bare walls, a few chairs -- but perfectly conceived to frame the gorgeous costumes, expressive faces, and well-directed choreography of the singer-actors' movements. The color coordination, from the lush orange and auburn of the first act to the brooding blues and somber blacks of later scenes, seems more artful to my eyes than any amount of costly clutter.

I know this is an ambivalent review. But it's sincere. Eugene Onegin is a perennial favorite of opera audiences. There must be something more to the music than my ears perceive. Conductor Valery Gergiev can't be held accountable for my taste; he elicits very fine instrumental timbres and tight ensemble from the Met Opera Orchestra. If you consider yourself - in your madness - a ""serious opera lover,"" Eugene Onegin is an opera you must hear and see at least once, and this is as artful a performance of it as anyone could demand.",1367539200,3,2888,5.1252653927813165

3260387,4,B000YCLRBA,"This is a very fine performance and recording of what must be described as rather a minimalist production which, on its own terms, must also be considered a success. To elaborate further therefore ......

The cast chosen for this production is unquestioningly top quality throughout and it delivers similar high quality performances in depth. The title role of Onegin perfectly suits the handsome and impressive Dmitri Hvorostovsky whose rich voice and generally restrained bearing underlines Onegin's own perceived role in society. The Russian timbre of his voice also adds considerable veracity to this role. In this respect he is in good company within the cast. Olga, sung by Elena Zaremba, Tatiana's nurse, sung by Larisa Shevchenko, Tatiana's mother sung by Svetlana Volkova and the impressively Russian timbred Serei Aleksashkin as Prince Gremin, all share these tonal advantages. All the above listed singers are clearly equally immersed in their respective roles and the production benefits accordingly.

Ren&eacute;e Fleming is a perfect Tatiana and brings the necessary appearance of youth combined with her later social sophistication effortlessly to the role. Her voice is as beautiful as her acting is beyond reproach. The role of Lenski suits the sustained lyrical abilities of Ram&oacute;n Vargas which culminates in arguably one of his finest moments at the beginning of Act 2 scene 2 in his lengthy aria just prior to the fatal duel. This justifiably earns a considerable ovation from the very appreciative audience.

The orchestra play to their normal high standard under the sure direction of Gergiev who clearly knows this score inside out.

The production is one of the minimalist variety where the intention appears to be to focus the audience's attention on the personal dramas rather than the settings. To this extent it succeeds very well and suits the intention of the libretto based largely on Pushkin's creation. As Tchaikovsky himself commented in a letter to his future benefactress Nadezhda von Meck on 27 May 1877, `The opera will have no strong dramatic action, but the portrayal of everyday life will be interesting, and how full of poetry it all is.' Nevertheless there will be those who will regret the lack of opulence in the ballroom scenes which can be spectacular in other productions.

There are the usual interviews and introductions typical of these Met recordings plus a short film giving an interesting glimpse of rehearsal moments which reinforce expectations rather than casting any new light as regards understanding this opera. The booklet is usefully informative.

The imaging is crisp and the camera work is involving. The close-up shots during the ballroom scenes help to suggest a greater scale of event than is actually the case on stage! The sound is presented in excellent DTS 5.1 and stereo.

This is a quality production which should give plenty of pleasure and satisfaction to most purchasers. Within the context of the somewhat minimalist chosen production values it seems reasonable to rate this as a convincing disc although there will be many who will regret the lack of scenic scale, most obviously at points such as the ballroom scene where it can easily be argued that too much has to be left to the imagination.

3260388,5,B000YCLRBA,"I have recently purchased this DVD mainly due to the excellent reviews that it had received. They were entirely right - this production is superb in all respects. I am especially impressed by Renne Fleming, and in particular by her rendition of the ""letter scene"". This justly famous passage from Pushkin's Evgeny Onegin (which is perhaps as important to the Russian language as La Divina Comedia is to Italian), that is quoted essentially verbatim in Tchaikovsky's score, must be one of the highest pinnacles of aesthetic achievement both in poetry and music. Renne's rendition of this passage will positively give you goose bumps. It is a no small feat that a singer in her fifties can believably look and act the part of a young woman; she does all that very convincingly, singing incredibly beautifully all the way through. I imagine that Russian can not be a simple language to her, and yet we would never guess this from listening to her. In my opinion this passage alone justifies the purchase of the DVD.  Among the other singers I am especially impressed by Hvorostovsky, but this is perhaps not overly surprising since he is on the home turf in this beautiful romantic music of Tchaikovsky. The blending of Renne's and Dmitry's voices must be one of the most fortunate examples in contemporary opera production. Gergiev leads with his characteristic energy, intelligence and insight; this man is truly impressive, in my opinion one of the handful most exciting conductors of our time.",1335052800,5,1494,4.952191235059761

The blu ray images were fine but not outstanding and the sound while OK did not have the level of sound stage presence that I have heard from other blu ray disks.  I hope however, that the Met got the set and staging for a discount.  Plan brownish yellow walls, pretty much the same from act to act.  Lots of leaves for the chorus to sweep, in fact that was the major activity for the female chorus, sweeping leaves. There were also lots of chairs -- I don't get the chairs.  The beautiful 3rd act opening polinaise was wasted by the static scene of dressing Onegin; I thought that the polinaise was a dance where were the dancers?  If sets and action are supposed to help set a time and place -- this set and stage direction failed.  You could close your eyes for long periods of time and not miss a thing except for not being able to read the subtitles.  So 5 stars for the leads, 2 stars for the set -- this comes to about 3.5 but Amazon requires whole star ratings.

Hvorostovsky, Renee Fleming, and Ramon Vargas is a good choice overall. Sets don't exist, the stage is barren except for leaves on the floor and a chair or table; however, one can concentrate on the singers without distraction.  Dimitri is gorgeous, elegant, and oh, so aloof.  Renee is lovely, yet vulnerable.  Ramon is a poet, sensitive yet quick to anger.  I would appreciate sets that suggest Russia of the time, costumes that reflect the culture, and a truly grand Polonaise.  None of this was in the Met's mix this time, but one can't have everything even though it is always permissible to dream.  A good all-around choice.

I get the impression that the MET ran out of money for the production (sic!) after paying those superstars their fees... that they had to cut down the sets to dead leaves and other sets (or lack of them) leaving much to be desired. The waltz scene made me sick with those tacky chairs (looked like borrowed from the nearest vodka quickie joint) with dancers herded inside it.... yuck....
And God... what did they do to the Polonaise? I would have preferred seeing Renee Fleming dressing up instead of Hvorostovsky LOL.... That would have made it deserve more than 5 stars...
A reviewer whom I respect a Lot, Mr. Keris Nine takes up for the Met, and blames Tchaikovsky for this... LOL... True, Tchaikovsky may have wanted it simple, but there could have been a lot more reasons for that, economy being one of them, if you read between the lines...
All said and done, a production by the MET should be by all standards Grandiose.. that is what I would expect and demand for my visual benefit. They could as well have had just the stage with the singers belting away rather than these minimalist settings... BOOO and ONE STAR LESS for this.

3260394,5,B000YCLRBA,"Tchaikovsky's opera ""Eugene Onegin"" was a pleasant surprise to me when I first encountered it. I was expecting a heavy Russian epic (along the lines of ""Boris Godunov""), but instead it is romantic and very lyrical.

In this production from the Metropolitan Opera, Rene Fleming gives an outstanding performance as Tatiana, producing beautiful singing and touching acting throughout. Dmitri Hvorostovsky is equally appealing as Onegin, with his famous rich tone. And how touching it was to have the two of them interviewed at intermission by Beverly Sills herself!

The production is very different and extremely minimalist, with the stage frequently bare with the exception of one or two simple pieces of furniture. While some may prefer sets on the more extravagant side of things, I found that this minimalist approach allowed the characters themselves to blossom and become the center of our attention. The lighting design brought out some gorgeous colors, with a very effective sunrise after Tatiana's letter aria, and a cold morning for a chilling duel between Onegin and Lensky.

The video quality is crystal clear, though not quite at the exceptional level of many discs release by Opus Arte. The sound is simply stunning.

One of my favorite operas on blu-ray! I hope the Metropolitan Opera produces more.",1301443200,,1312,5.203791469194313
3260395,5,B000YCLRBA,"The majority of the productions that I have witnessed from the Metropolitan Opera House have been ""eye popping"" spectacles.  This 2007 Metropolitan Opera House's production of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin is spectacularly intimate with minimalistic sets and very sparse scenery.  It all works wonderfully for this, to me, very intimate opera that focuses more on Tatiana. Lenski and Onegin's inner emotions.  Although, the production thrilled me, I was overwhelmed with the musical side of things, as well

The Met Orchestra, outstandingly led by Valery Gergiev, was, per usual, wonderful playing with extreme beauty and sensitivity--bravo.  All three (3) of the principal singers (Renee Fleming, Ramon Vargas, and Dmitri Hvorostovsk) were simply outstanding delivering their arias and duets magnificently.  The closing duet between Onegin and Tatiana (Fleming and Hvorostovsky) was truly special being so dramatic and beautifully sung.  Once again, I must say BRAVO.  I really loved this operatic production.

3260397,5,B000YCLRBA,"I have been listening to Onegin for over 20 years on CD but this was the first time I actually bought the DVD. I missed the live broadcast in theaters but the DVD on wide screen TV is the next best option. I just can't have enough of it. The opera is based on a beautiful love story by Pushkin that Tchaikovsky transformed into an immortal opera. The melodies are Tchaikovskian at their best and beautifully match the scenes and moods of story line. The performances of major characters by Fleming, Hvorostovsky and Vargas are breath-taking despite two of them being non-Russian (Fleming,Vargas). I specially was taken by Ms. Fleming's performance. My first Onegin recording had Irina Arkhipova in Filipyevna role and I was amazed as how well Ms. Fleming held a candle to the great Russian opera singer. Ms Fleming is not only a great singer but an excellent actress too as she melds into the role of a 16 year old Russian girl so beautifully that you loose sight of her being much older. The dramatic impressions by the characters more than make up for the lack of elaborate decor in most of the scenes. Though the story-line is somewhat sad, it is one of Tchaikovsky's happier operas as compared with Mazeppa, Iolante or Queen of Spades. The sad irony is that Pushkin himself was killed in a duel in much the same way as Lensky's character in the opera. I tell my friends ""if you just want to see one opera in your life-time, make it Evgeny Onegin. You won't regret it.""",1295654400,,1472,4.558490566037736
3260398,5,B000YCLRBA,"Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin is as Russian as they come - from an impeccable literary source (Pushkin), filled with all the classic situations of fatalistic romances, fabulous balls and a duel over a question of honour.  The Met's 2007 production, recorded for their HD-Live series, retains a strong underpinning in the casting and the sensitive conducting of the opera by Valery Gergiev that brings these elements brilliantly to the fore.

Perfectly in line with Tchaikovsky's original intentions, Robert Carsen's staging is straightforward and simple, the set uncluttered, with only the bare minimum of props required for the settings, while the all-important tone - primarily an emotional one - is set by the lighting and colouration of the stark backgrounds that tower over and enclose the performers.  It gives the opera a truly unique feel, one that is perfectly in tune with the emotional chords struck by the music and the libretto, a tone that is dominated by the interpretation of Onegin here - cold, austere and aloof, calculating even, certainly with a touch of arrogance, but carrying within himself his own torments, distancing himself from others in a remote and self-involved manner that doesn't take anyone else's feelings into account.

It's remarkable then how this chimes with Tchaikovsky's own personal circumstances at the time, unable to bear the gossip surrounding him over his sexuality, entering unadvisedly into a marriage for convenience where he is unable to offer anything more than ""brotherly love"".  Accordingly the music in Eugene Onegin is often as heartfelt and emotional as anything Tchaikovsky has composed, but with that customary detached, intellectualised translation of it into pure, precise musical terms.  Consequently, it's utterly gripping when converted into the drama of Onegin, involving the heart as much as the mind.

One couldn't ask for anything more out of the performers - the starkness of the sets allowing the audience to focus solely on the singing without distractions while the lighting supports the emotions and motivations lying behind them.  The singers meet the demands of the roles and the action admirably, Dmitri Hrovostovsky indeed presenting a fine cold, aloof figure in Onegin, contrasted with the fiery passions of Ramn Vargas's Lenski and the romantic purity of Rene Fleming's Tatiana.

On Blu-ray, the staging looks magnificent in its colouration and tones.  The audio is generally fine, but there are a few issues with microphone placements that don't give adequate presence to the voices, neither in the LPCM 2.0 or the DTS HD Master Audio 5.1, though this is only an occasional issue particularly in the first act of the opera.  A 16-minute Behind the Scenes featurette presents an interesting look at the rehearsals for the opera.

3260402,5,B000YCLRBA,"Amazingly, what we have here is an `exercise in reverse'...

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have quite a successful group of singers born bread and trained there, aspiring to take the world's centre operatic stage; those include  in no particular order: Vesselina Kasarova (Mezzo-soprano/alto), Elina Garanca (Mezzo-soprano), Dimitri Hvosostovsky (Baritone), Anna Netrebko (Soprano), Angela Georgiou (Soprano), and not to forget the forerunners of those artists, the magnificent Elena Obraztsova (Mezzo-soprano), the superb Ghena Dimitrova (soprano), the great NIcolai Ghiaurov (Bass), and more.
All of these artists which initially were trained in the former Soviet Union schools of music, took to the Italian and French repertoire - and here was the `straight forward exercise' which they took upon themselves; to try (to various degree of success) to overcome their inherent Slavonic culture-of-the-voice, and without the hinder of the Slavonic trained singing voice to shine in the Italian and French repertoire...True, many of them got their voices trained farther with Italian and French singing teachers later on in their fledgling careers.

The `exercise in reverse' now, is, that two of the greatest western cultured operatic voices, born, bread and trained in the best of the Italian and French culture tradition of the voice, namely, Ramon Vargas (tenor) and Renee Fleming (lyric soprano) would dive nose down into the core of the Russian operatic repertoire - Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin...

Right from the start there is a magnificent sense of correctness in the way by which Renee Fleming
enters the scene as a the romantic teenager, expressing her lines in pure Russian diction and pure lyric-vocal-tone and with the right Russian syllables.
From there on, Tatiana becomes Renee Faming - and Renee flaming on stage becomes Tchaikovsky's and Pushkin's Tatiana...
Most rendering is the `letter aria': this is a complete encompassing scene that demands a command of the singing voice, expressiveness and an amazing ability to act - all of which is greatly fulfilled by Renee Fleming. (One might imagine that Tchaikovsky dedicated the vocal lines here to this singer, to her range of colors and registers - no piercing the stratosphere with high notes above the B flat...)
And mind you - the whole of Tatiana's roll the key to Tatian's character and reasoning hinge on this single impressive scene.
The voice here has a successful mixture of the lyricism, timbre, and correct Russian vowels pronunciation, and the degree of shading of the voice that goes into the lower register here, is correctly tinted with a Slavonic hue.
This scene is guaranteed to make your heart break, and give you a goose-bumps, this, along-side Fleming's (garden scene) where her the acting and facial expression are aimed at giving you a heartache when Onegin lectures her and returns her letter while rejecting her.

Onegin's roll sung by the Russian Baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky (the prime winner of Cardiff-singer-of the-world-competition of some years ago), comes to him naturally and without obvious effort, fitting his physique, stage presence, and his `cool' acting, to the teeth.
Still, there are moments in the last act where Onegin have a change of heart, which asks for just a tad more `remorse', passion, naked laying of emotions - in which Hvorostovsky is a tad too stingy.
One should compare this closing scene between Tatiana and Onegin, with the James Levine 25th anniversary DVD at the Metropolitan - where dramatic baritone Dwayne Croft practically stops the show with his full throat out-burst and breath-control in: ""what humiliation, what anguish, what a tragic fate!"" - to fully understand what is (slightly) missing here with the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky.

Ramon Vargas, which we associate with Puccini and Verdi tenor rolls emerges here as a fine fit to the Russian roll of Lenski dealt to him. His soave tenor voice carries on into the Russian vocalizations and vowels very successfully. His pronunciation is clear and with no obvious hindrance. His acting abilities are equally satisfying in this roll.

The Russian alto/mezzo-soprano Larisa Shevchenko,- gives a specially impressive performance, in the roll of the old nanny; very believable, well sung and well acted and very reliable, specially so, in her duet with Tatians's mother at the very beginning of the opera and later on in the `letter scene' where her interaction with Renee Flemig/Tatiana, at the start of the scene end - when morning breaks in - gives her part a very special sad touch and a great meaning.

The stage set-up - sparsely decorated, clear and almost empty but colorful (the falling leaves that carpet the floor) has an extra edge: it makes the viewer concentrate on the action and draws the viewer into the plot and the mood more easily. It is extremely functional and gives the actors an `instrument' with which to interact (Tatiana playing with the leaves, using a leave in the embarrassing moments of her lake-side scene with Onegin. her letter-scene, and so forth). Everything on the sparsely decorated stage is functional and has its purpose (a rare phenomenon with modern staging).

The stage illumination too has a clear un-exaggerated function which greatly contributes to the filming and details that the cameras capture (this is no half shading `camera obscura' - the way some Blu-ray is made; in semi darkness...)

The sound recording is as perfect as it gets - it capture the orchestral sound and dynamics and the singers voices in a greatly focused proportional way and with a frequency range that is clear, extended - in the best of the Decca tradition.

The conducting, the tempi, the breath and pause, is a marvel:
What a great conductor we find here for the Metropolitan Orchestra and the Tchaikovsky score in the figure of Valery Gergiev...!

The Tchaikovsky musical theme are quite known and melodic - the lines are easy to memorize, but it might take the novice to Tchaikovsky's operas and the manner by which Tchaikovsky takes to the singing voice score and orchestra, a second hearing/viewing of this DVD - just to get it all to sink-in and enjoy.

No doubts that this is one of the very best (possibly THE VERY BEST) of the Blu-ray DVD opera as yet; One of a great stage production, singing, sound - all in all, a marriage of the best possible assemblage of artists which gives meaning to it all.
The `exercise in reverse' - courtesy of the Metropolitan Opera House, is a mile-stone.",1259884800,4,6525,5.109756097560975

Most rendering is the `letter aria': this is a complete encompassing scene that demands a command of the singing voice, expressiveness and an amazing ability to act - all of which is greatly fulfilled by Renee Fleming. (One might imagine that Tchaikovsky dedicated the vocal lines here to this singer, to her range of colors and registers - no piercing the stratosphere with high notes above the B flat...)
And mind you - the whole of Tatiana's roll the key to Tatian's character and reasoning hinge on this single impressive scene.
The voice here has a successful mixture of the lyricism, timbre, and correct Russian vowels pronunciation, and the degree of shading of the voice that goes into the lower register here, is correctly tinted with a Slavonic hue.
This scene is guaranteed to make your heart break, and give you a goose-bumps, this, along-side Fleming's (garden scene) where her the acting and facial expression are aimed at giving you a heartache when Onegin lectures her and returns her letter while rejecting her.

Onegin's roll sung by the Russian Baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky (the prime winner of Cardiff-singer-of the-world-competition of some years ago), comes to him naturally and without obvious effort, fitting his physique, stage presence, and his `cool' acting, to the teeth.
Still, there are moments in the last act where Onegin have a change of heart, which asks for just a tad more `remorse', passion, naked laying of emotions - in which Hvorostovsky is a tad too stingy.
One should compare this closing scene between Tatiana and Onegin, with the James Levine 25th anniversary DVD at the Metropolitan - where dramatic baritone Dwayne Croft practically stops the show with his full throat out-burst and breath-control in: ""what humiliation, what anguish, what a tragic fate!"" - to fully understand what is (slightly) missing here with the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky.

Ramon Vargas, which we associate with Puccini and Verdi tenor rolls emerges here as a fine fit to the Russian roll of Lenski dealt to him. His soave tenor voice carries on into the Russian vocalizations and vowels very successfully. His pronunciation is clear and with no obvious hindrance. His acting abilities are equally satisfying in this roll.

The Russian alto/mezzo-soprano Larisa Shevchenko,- gives a specially impressive performance, in the roll of the old nanny; very believable, well sung and well acted and very reliable, specially so, in her duet with Tatians's mother at the very beginning of the opera and later on in the `letter scene' where her interaction with Renee Flemig/Tatiana, at the start of the scene end - when morning breaks in - gives her part a very special sad touch and a great meaning.

The stage set-up - sparsely decorated, clear and almost empty but colorful (the falling leaves that carpet the floor) has an extra edge: it makes the viewer concentrate on the action and draws the viewer into the plot and the mood more easily. It is extremely functional and gives the actors an `instrument' with which to interact (Tatiana playing with the leaves, using a leave in the embarrassing moments of her lake-side scene with Onegin. her letter-scene, and so forth). Everything on the sparsely decorated stage is functional and has its purpose (a rare phenomenon with modern staging).

The stage illumination too has a clear un-exaggerated function which greatly contributes to the filming and details that the cameras capture (this is no half shading `camera obscura' - the way some Blu-ray is made; in semi darkness...)

The sound recording is as perfect as it gets - it capture the orchestral sound and dynamics and the singers voices in a greatly focused proportional way and with a frequency range that is clear, extended - in the best of the Decca tradition.

The conducting, the tempi, the breath and pause, is a marvel:
What a great conductor we find here for the Metropolitan Orchestra and the Tchaikovsky score in the figure of Valery Gergiev...!

The Tchaikovsky musical theme are quite known and melodic - the lines are easy to memorize, but it might take the novice to Tchaikovsky's operas and the manner by which Tchaikovsky takes to the singing voice score and orchestra, a second hearing/viewing of this DVD - just to get it all to sink-in and enjoy.

No doubts that this is one of the very best (possibly THE VERY BEST) of the Blu-ray DVD opera as yet; One of a great stage production, singing, sound - all in all, a marriage of the best possible assemblage of artists which gives meaning to it all.
The `exercise in reverse' - courtesy of the Metropolitan Opera House, is a mile-stone.",1259884800,5,6525,5.109756097560975

It is very nice to watch a DVD with beautiful scenery; but it is also true that you can get distracted, that is why even the scenography was very simple, I was more focused on the artist's performance, there singing, and acting,  and also the drama, for those reasons I enjoyed so much, the performance of all were super.
I brought Sir Georg Solti's' version a couple of years ago and the scenery was very beautiful, this is an ""advance"" when you make it as a movie, beside, the actors and singers were not the same. I took a while to decide to buy this version, and I am glad I bought this one, I like to see a DVD that the acting and singing were done by the same artists.
An other thing that I enjoyed were the lights , to put an example of the effect of these was the duel scene with the use of claroscuro that made so dramatic, as well as in other passages of the drama . The costumes were very beautiful and the sound wonderful.
This DVD was the first that I bought from the HD Metropolitan Performance series and of course I can see the difference in the images quality compared to other DVD.
This is an outstanding production.",1253404800,2,1445,5.201716738197425
3260407,3,B000YCLRBA,"I placed my order for this opera from one of Amazon' s merchants, expecting to receive a Blu-ray version.

Much to my chagrin I received the standard DVD version. I did not check the album until a few weeks after receiving it - by which time it was too late to return it.",1251331200,,271,4.113207547169812
3260408,5,B000YCLRBA,"Ordinarily I avoid operatic productions with minimalist settings and avant garde stage directors like the plague, but this staging of Eugene Onegin by the Metropolitan Opera proved that sparse settings used imaginatively with sympathetic lighting can be very effective and even , dare I say, beautiful. Take the opening scene: to portray the rustic Larin estate, a bare stage thickly strewn with red and gold leaves, in the centre of which two women sit peeling apples, reminiscing about old times and then the appearance of a group of peasants singing in chorus immediately sets the scene in the Russian countryside. The lighting highlights the russet, orange brown hues beautifully and the Hi-Def colour and picture quality are brilliant. I must point out that the costumes are appropriate to the period and very colourful they are too. Simple white chairs in a rectangle are used for the ball at the estate, and a set of ornate chairs for the ball in high society Moscow. The stage is chillingly bare for the duel scene where the protagonist are shown in silhouette; they face each other point their pistols, fire and one falls, very dramatic.
  Dmitri Hvorostovsky, is perfectly cast as Onegin, a handsome, aristocratic figure, completely egocentric and callous of others' feelings, a bored society lion. His rich baritone voice is thrilling to hear and he puts in a commanding performance especially in the final scene.  Ramon Vargas excels as the poetic Lenski and is most impressive in the poignant scene just before the fateful duel, where he sings wistfully about the end of his golden youth, to great ovation from the audience.
  And then there is Renee Fleming. I have to admit having some initial qualms about Fleming cast as Tatiana. Tatiana is a very young maiden, a girl naive and innocent yearning for love and an idealised hero, a Juliette figure in essence. I would have thought that Fleming would be too mature a figure to carry it off. But carry it off she did and with great aplomb. She had me believing she was a moody teenager, head in the clouds or buried in romantic novels pining for love. The scene in the bedroom with her nanny is touching as is the next where she gushes forth all her feelings in a reckless letter to Onegin. And when Onegin confronts her to politely but coldly reject her, her facial expression tells it all: humiliation, anguish and a hope that the earth would swallow her up. Fabulous acting. Superlative singing. And of course the climactic scene where she tears herself from Onegin at last professing his love for her, realising that happiness was so close but quite impossible to attain, and that the past is past. The title of the opera may be Eugene Onegin but this one is all about Tatiana and Renee Fleming. What a triumph.",1250208000,7,2779,4.805439330543933

3260415,4,B000YCLRBA,"I gave this version of Onegin 4 stars because, in spite of the outstanding performance by Dmitry Hvorostovsky and Valery Gergiev, one that thoroughly revealed the greatness of Tchaikovsky's score, the rest of the cast, in my opinion, did not fully reach that level of perfection. Renee Fleming has a gorgeous voice, her pitch is perfect but at moments in the first act she acts too much as a grown-up woman rather than as a sixteen-year-old Tatyana. Tatyana finds her emotional turmoil inexplicable until she discovers that she is in love (Pouring water on herself is a bit  extreme, particularly for a very young Russian country girl). However, Fleming is superb in the last scene of the opera. That scene is unforgettable. It takes one's breath away. Fleming and Hvorostovsky not only sing brilliantly, they succeed in making one forget that this is a stage and not real life, they are totally identified with their characters.  No one else comes close to that level of performance. Olga is excellent, but she and Vargas do not make a credible couple. I find his Russian pronounciation not good, and his Lenski aria is too full of Italianate rubato and  sentimentality. In my opinion, that aria is one of the most beautiful and profound in the repertoire. It, by the way, is beautifully and expressively played by the cello soloist in the introduction to the duel scene.

 Other artists in this recording who do total justice to their role are Larisa Shevchenko (""nyanya"") and Sergei Aleksashkin (Prince Gremin).
Shevchenko sings beautifully, has a warm personality, and is a kind and devoted nyanya. Sergei Aleksashkin's version of his aria is the best I have heard. The tempo is excellent, his voice is rich and of accurate pitch, and his delivery soberly conveys nobility of sentiment.",1232323200,6,1790,4.9335548172757475
3260416,5,B000YCLRBA,"Quite often Eurotrash directors gleefully subvert the intentions of the original composer and librettist. Stage directions are ignored, and singers are encouraged to perform actions on stage that run contrary to the actions clearly suggested in the music. Extraneous characters run to and fro, and the mise-en-scne is so radically different than anything ever imagined by the opera's creators that you literally cannot figure out what the story's about. Sometimes such innovative Regietheater can be great fun or even revealing, but 90% of the time it's pretentious nonsense, a perverse and often childish amplification of subtexts. After years of this crud, the Eurostrashcan (aided and often led by Ameritrashers) is crammed with boring ""avant-garde"" cliches(which should be an oxymoron). Over 100 of these production disasters can be purchased on standard DVD videos here at Amazon.com.

Among the more acceptable malifactors is the director of this fine ""Onegin,"" Robert Carsen, aided and abetted by set-and-costume designer Michael Levine. Plenty of stupid eliminations and additions occur in this production, but the leaf-covered, furniture-cramped-then- empty-spaced Postmodern settings are often visually beautiful in this video, and the principals are rather wonderful -- especially the silken-throated, sexually charismatic baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky (who, as they like to say, ""IS"" Onegin""), soprano Rene Fleming (at her best as Tatiana), and tenor Ramn Vargas (who sings gloriously and looks exactly like Lenski). Valery Gergiev conducts authoritatively. The widescreen Blu-ray image looks fabulous -- and the sound is spacious and thrilling. This DVD is an edit of the live HD transmission seen in theaters, live from the Met. One hopes all the Met's HD transmissions (for better or for worse) will be available in this exciting new Blu-ray format.

Among the more destructive Blu-ray offerings are the perfectly dreadful Opus Arte ""Norma"" (turned into a trivial backstage melodrama), the obfuscatory DG ""Le Nozze di Figaro"" from Salzburg (in which even the conducting is bad), an absurdly vulgar Arthaus ""Rigoletto"" (not too bad musically, however), and an interesting but ultimately dreary minimalist Harmoni Mundi ""Don Giovanni"" (conducted by Rene Jacobs and containing some fine singing with added ornamentations not specificed by Mozart). The crazy mixed-up DG ""Manon"" is actually fun with its looney concept which keeps Anna Netrebko self-consciously evolving through various personae including Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Ingrid Bergman.

Hvorostovsky and Fleming are ideal as Onegin and Tatiana The stark set, indeed a ""non-set"", is at first disappointing, but does succeed in focusing attention on the human drama instead of toward lavish production elements. Color is used very effectively to saturate each scene and outline the singers. This production no doubt benefited from the close scrutiny of the camera because the performances were finely tuned and sublty nuanced. As an example, the usual ""dance spectacle"" accompanying the Polonaise which opens Act III is replaced here by Onegin attended to by his valet staff while changing from dueling attire to formal dress. Although I enjoy a lavish production as much as anyone, it was refreshing to experience a concept which focuses primarily on the protagonists.

3260422,5,B000YCLRBA,"I dare to say that this production was the MET last year major achievement. Even though a stupendous singers set was gathered for this performance it did not necessarily guarantee it's amazing success. This dreamed cast is formed by three of the most talented singers of our time: Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Rene Flemming and Ramn Vargas.

The staging is minimalist however absolutely accurate and tasty. By adding different intelligent elements the drama flows both naturally and flawlessly, in other words impeccable. The Russian Maestro Valery Gergiev conducted the MET orchestra with full commitment and passion.
The Siberian baritone Dmitri Hvorsotovsky is enormous as Onegin completely understanding the character and making it his own. Needless to say he is at his best here, both vocally and dramatically; I don't see anyone at this moment to be a match for him in this roll.
Rene Flemming is tremendous as Tatiana, she is simply perfect. Her acquaintance with Hvorostovsky is impressing.
Ramn Vargas as Lensky is memorable, precise and passionate confirming his position as one of the more reliable tenors of his generation. His ""Kuda, kuda"" was performed effortlessly with real suffering and pain.
Elena Zaremba portrays a charming Olga with no less intelligence and knowledge of her role.
The secondary roles are covered more than efficiently.

Needless to say, that this is truly a ""must have"" for every opera fan and especially for Mexican Opera Fans, not only for the price, but for the achievement.",1210032000,3,1507,5.223140495867769

With his rich, long-phrased baritone and artful characterisation Hvorostovsky brings to life a very credible Onegin,  adapting from his cool response to Tatiana's letter to the empassioned profession of love in Act 3.  Fleming's Tatiana dovetails this as a convincing ingnue in Act 1 leading to the honour-bound wife of Act 3.  Her warm lyrical soprano producing a moving 'letter scene'.  The production cleverly presents the action as taking place in Onegin's memory, starting with him alone on stage, during the orchestral introduction, holding Tatiana's letter,  All around him are autumn leaves,  some falling from between the pages of the letter, suggesting a mood of love lost.",1208649600,5,842,5.4728682170542635

However, nothing would have topped the experience of seeing this live production of Eugene Onegin by the Metropolitan Opera.

The last tweleve minutes of the opera alone are worth the purchase of this dual disc.  You really get wrapped up in the experience. Vargas brings tears to your eyes with his rendition of Lenski's Aria.  If you're a fan of Tchaikovsky, beautiful music and a great story line, you'll love this opera.

3260428,4,B000YCLRBA,"REVIEW OF PUSHKIN'S ONEGIN

The very talented cast is up to performing with passion Pushkin's Onegin, however Elena Zaremba would have been much better suited playing Tatiania's Mother and the more youthful looking Mother, Olga.

I do feel that Carsen's staging is a big disappointment to both the cast and certainly to the audience as well.  It was a great distraction from the performances. One has to ask if Michael Levine has a prejudice against presenting Russian culture in his stage scenes.  Two steel pipes and a stage strewn with leaves, does not make a birch forest in a Russian countryside.  And what would it have cost production to have two pillars in the backdrop and a chandelier hanging from the center stage to convey a ballroom scene in St. Petersburg?  The stark eclectic staging of Onegin is something only a Stalinist could appreciate.

I had considered seeing Onegin when it came to Chicago in March but after noting it was a Carsen-Levine staging I opted to buy the DVD and am so very glad I did so.  I saved over $280.  The performances are great despite the drab setting they were compelled to perform in.  Supreme talent outshines a mediocre production.

3260429,5,B000YCLRBA,"Having seen this production at the MET and HD transmission to the movies, this DVD is outstanding in every way and highly recommended as a worthy addition to your collection. For those who have seen the production at the MET, it will enhance your enjoyment of the individual performances with close-ups of facial expressions of singers and other interesting nuances and other little amusing things you might have missed if you were seated far from the stage. This DVD is specially beneficial to those seeing this opera for the first time because of the elimination of extraneous and distracting things, which allows you to focus on the dramatic and musical  inputs of the protagonists more clearly.

Having seen conventional, lavish productions of this opera in major houses, I had some apprehensions at first about how Act 3 would turn out stripped of the customary depiction of the opulence and splendor of St. Petersburg in Pushkin's time. With bare walls and just a few nice chairs around, the fantastic lighting effects and elegant coustumes made a big difference and saved this production from getting too ""eurotrashy"".

For me, the most important achievement of this production is the righting of the unfair characterization by critics, past and present, of the role of the poet Lenski as the ""weakest link"" among the principals. From  the very first time I saw this opera, I have always felt that Lenski's music was the most beautiful in the opera and that Tchaikovsky identified more with Lenski's creative nature. So, why the ""weakest link"" tag ? This production  provided the answer! That's why this minimalist ONEGIN is particularly helpful to first timers to the opera. By combining Acts 2 & 3 and eliminating the long intermission between the Acts & scenes as well as toning down the distracting, unnecessary elements extraneous to the story, this production allows the audience to focus not only on individual performances but the totality of their artistic contributions as well. In full lavish productions, Lenski dies at the end of Act 2. He is given a courtesy solo bow, and his night is done. After a 20-minute intermission or longer, a shot of vodka, champagne or margarita, the audience is ushered back to their seats for the beginning of Act 3. When the curtain opens, the audience is greeted by the majestic polonaise  with elegantly dressed and bejewelled ladies of St. Petersburg's upper crust society, dancers and entertainers at Prince Gremin's palatial digs. The audience then gets to hear his beautiful aria  and Onegin's two-minute arioso. Another time break for scene change, and then the final scene with Tatiana and Onegin culminating with the histrionics of their dysfunctional love relationship. End of opera - about one and a half hours after Lenski' death. Poor Lenski is a forgotten man by then. But not in this production! Here, after his death, he goes back to his dressing room, have coffee or something stronger (Bjoerling used to do it,why not), and half an hour later, he goes out on stage to receive the audience's feedback with the rest of the cast. That's
the way it should be, and the composer would have loved it.

This DVD may not be surpassed for a long time. The cast is just outstanding, from the three principals who are all at their best, down the line to Lenski's second at the duel scene. Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky will be very hard to top as Tatiana and Onegin because, not only do they possess beautiful voices and fine acting abilities, they also must have spent a lot of time studying and rehearsing together. It shows in their chemistry. Ramon Vargas gave the most vivid portrayal of the poet's persona that I have ever witnessed, and his subtle, well controlled and very effective acting  covered a wide gamut of emotions from the lyrical Act 1 through varying degrees of distrust, jealousy and anger, and the heartbreaking resignation in Act 2. He even introduced a little humor in the middle of his ardent declaration of chaste love to the seated Olga by gently pushing the tray of goodies away from her to get her full attention. I missed that one in the theater, and I'm thankful for the DVD. His voice was absolutely gorgeous, and his singing superb throughout. His arioso in Act1 is just as beautiful as Onegin's aria at the end of the act. For some strange reason, Hvorostovsky received only a polite audience response with no bravos. I thought he gave a flawless and terrific rendition of the aria. In Act 2 Scene 1, Vargas dominated the singing in his reprimand of Olga for her flirting with Onegin, his private confrontation with Onegin and the escalation ending in throat grabbing before the guests. He opened the  big quintet with chorus  with a tender and touching recollection of the happiness he found at the Larin's home as an adolescent and ended the ensemble with a powerful, pained farewell to his beloved Olga. Lenski's aria Act2 Scene2, as sublimely sung by Vargas and lovingly accompanied by the great Met Orchestra under the super conductor of choice, Valery Gergiev, is one for the ages. Vargas just simply dominated all of Act 2. Renee Fleming dominated Act 1 with her wonderful, well nuanced Letter Scene which was warmly received by the audience.

So, is the ""weakest link"" going to steal the show from the Star?  After Act3 Scene1, Lenski was still ahead in my tally. DH was in his best voice, and that's a lot. He must deliver the best performance of his life to catch the poet. Fleming could pass him too if he didn't. Fueled by Fleming's incredible acting and singing, which I have never seen from her before, he caught fire in the last six minutes, and the rest is history. He nailed that last note like Rigoletto's anguished maledezione with all the power and pathos he could muster. My verdict: it's a 3-way tie ! When Vargas came out for curtain calls , the audience did not forget the pleasures he had given them and gave him back a tremendous ovation with confetti as they did the other two stars. Aren't we blessed to have three stars of this caliber with an excellent group of supporting singers, the best opera orchestra in the world under the direction of the genius from St. Petersburg?

Hvorostovsky is in his role... no doubt is his best. Without problems of appearence and diction can't think someone better... if is possible.
And Vargas... awesome. No matter his latin presence... his singing was perfectly. After the ""Kuda, kuda, kuda vi udalilis..."" is sad and a pity that Lensky is going to die and with him this liric sound and nearly perfect technique.

Equally mind-blowing is Mr. Hvorostovsky's Onegin. They are a perfect pair together - their chemistry is so real and palpable that one never doubts the sincerity emotions of the singers.

3260432,5,B000YCLRBA,"The productions of Robert Carsen, though usually informed by an individual style, tend to be predictable only for their being polarizing. When his approach jells (when he has not decided that, say, IL TROVATORE should be a searing indictment of the petrochemical industry), one sees a kind of minimalism that (pace the editorial review above) is quite the opposite of ""stark."" Carsen has the talent and the insight to do well what some of his lesser contemporaries do badly. He knows that the bare minimum of props and subtle shifts in lighting and color in place of traditional stagecraft can lend a production mechanical ease and fluidity while in no way precluding lyric beauty or kinetic energy. A poignant tone is set for this ONEGIN by the literally autumnal look of its first half: during the prelude, the bereft Onegin is showered in brown and orange leaves that remain on the stage for the next several scenes. When the peasants pay tribute to Larina with a joyous rustic dance, it is not a meticulously choreographed display of grace and athleticism (as later dances, in more formal and sophisticated settings, will be) -- it looks chaotic, spontaneous, even amateurish, just as such a demonstration would be if one were in the village observing it. The early-morning duel between Onegin and Lensky is masterfully staged. The two men sing their respective interior monologues in preparation for the deadly showdown neither wants, and each reaches his hand out in the direction of the other, from a distance that is slight yet unbridgeable. The staging makes clear that this is a representational and not a literal gesture, and the moment is heartbreaking. The subsequent silhouetted portrayal of Lensky's shooting, followed by the bright sun rising on Onegin, his soul irreparably stained, is both arresting and haunting.

But Carsen's greatest triumph is his demonstration of what usually is an asset even in his unsuccessful productions: an eye for subtext, and an ability to tease it out without assaulting his audience with it. This ONEGIN is not, as ONEGIN often is made to be, simply a tale of two people who would be a good match but have unfortunately misaligned timing; nor is it about a contemptible snob who gets his comeuppance in the end. Carsen astutely takes his cue from the first conversation we hear in the opera, that between Mother Larina and the nanny Filippyevna, both of whom loved and were loved passionately in youth but were led by pragmatism, duty, or necessity down a different path. ""Heaven sends us habit instead of happiness,"" observes Larina, and in the next two and a half hours we will see our heroine, Tatyana, assume her place among these women. Along with habit, heaven can send us heartbreak.

In the principal roles, Rene Fleming, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, and Ramn Vargas are in sovereign voice, and the soprano in particular is a revelation. I will confess that while her work in the past has hardly been thoughtless, I did not believe she had a performance of such behavioral specificity and dramatic perception in her (accompanying mini-doc footage suggests a fruitful partnership between her, Hvorostovsky, and Peter McClintock, director of this 2007 revival of Carsen's production). From the opera's opening through the birthday party, Fleming precisely evokes an ingenuous and romantic young person on the precipice of womanhood: a gesture or expression of distinctly girlish excitement or impulsivity may be followed in short order by one that is more wistful or circumspect, suggesting the woman she will become. Her work has a marvelous reactive spontaneity. When Tatyana reappears in the opera's final two scenes as a society woman of refinement and reserve, we are right there with Onegin in admiring the transformation, but we (like Fleming, Carsen, and McClintock) know that while something precious has been gained, something equally precious has been extinguished, or at least will never burn so brightly again: zest, eagerness, trust, innocence. Heaven has brought something, and heaven has taken something in payment.

Hvorostovsky, who has performed the title role with distinction for many years, recently has indicated a readiness to set it aside -- in that event, we are fortunate now to have deluxe documentation of his late thoughts on the character to supplement his earlier ones (on the Bychkov/Philips audio recording). It would be difficult to imagine a more ideal match of singer with character than Hvorostovsky with this vain, preeningly handsome, emotionally careless (but never uncaring) protagonist. Another of Carsen's shrewd touches, deftly enacted by Hvorostovsky, is to have Onegin barely pay attention to Lensky's initial round of charges at the birthday party. At a point when Onegin still has a window in which to defuse tension and avert tragedy, he does not even look at his angry friend; he remains seated, smirking and downing food and drink as if he is Giovanni patronizing a desperate Elvira. As has been noted elsewhere, Vargas's build, clothing, coif, and spectacles give this Lensky a striking (and apt, if intended) physical resemblance to another fragile, doomed poet/artist, Franz Schubert. Vargas is not the actor that his co-stars are, and is less comfortable with the Russian language than is any other featured singer on the stage, but when such gratifying lyric singing as his represents the weakest link, we obviously are dealing with a roster of unusual depth. Elena Zaremba (Olga) and especially Sergei Aleksashkin (a Gremin who quite looks the part) maintain the high musical standard; in smaller roles, Svetlana Volkova (Larina) and Larisa Shevchenko (Filippyevna) make their crucial points with warmth and appeal.

Celebrity maestros often are fascinating to watch at work for their varying methods: Karajan's eyes-closed shamanistic sculpting; Bernstein's emotional and occasionally overwrought balletic demonstrations; Muti's solemn-faced aristocratic precision; Abbado's genial coaxing and nudging; Carlos Kleiber's exuberant elasticity; Richard Strauss's minimalist economy of means. And then, on some quite different list, there is Valery Gergiev, one of the least fetching conductors in terms of gesture and expression  I have ever seen. The best description I can offer of his batonless technique to someone who has never seen it: imagine the imitation of a flamboyantly effeminate sorcerer by someone who despises that sorcerer. But however he chooses to communicate, he is no impediment to the Met Orchestra's predictably sumptuous reading of Tchaikovsky's score. The conductor's only truly questionable judgments are the taffy-pulling of Triquet's number (the tenor singing Triquet is obliged to serenade Tatyana at the slowest tempo I have ever heard in the piece, and then, as if to make up for lost time, the chorus's admiring responses are rushed -- it is rather like the release of a slingshot), and a too-hectic tempo for the dance music in the penultimate scene. On the whole, this ONEGIN deserves placement alongside the Scotto/Domingo MANON LESCAUT, the Troyanos TROYENS, and select others among the finest Met performances yet preserved for home viewing.",1202601600,11,7182,5.258064516129032

 Stunning Performances by the principals., Jan 3 2008
By  Hazel Smith (Sudbury, Ontario, Canada) - See all my reviews

I saw the HD presentation in 2007 and was so impressed that I went back for the encore two weeks later. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the Met would get a dvd of the production out so fast. I pre-ordered 2 copies the minute it was advertised. I am a devoted fan of Renee Fleming and she didn't disappoint; nor did Dmitri Hvorostovsky. Ramon Vargas was in excellent voice. The setting(for me) emphacized the isolation of the Russian steppe-vast landscape with few people. The ballroom scenes, with chairs hemming everyone in, seemed to symbolize the constrictions of conventional society. I know some people objected to the minimalist nature of the sets, but they worked for me and underlined some important facets of the opera. Aside from the glorious singing and acting, I loved watching Valery Gergiev conduct. The bonus features backstage were great. Thanks to Robert Carsen for another fabulous production. I've watched my dvd twice already. I just can't get enough of the ""letter scene"", the ""polonaise"", or the final duet. Enjoy!!!!!",1200873600,3,1221,4.946341463414634

It's painful to watch, and the performance breaks your heart in more ways than one.",1200787200,16,365,5.05
3260438,5,B000YCLRBA,"My wife and I watched this performance from the Grand Tier. At the time, we agreed that the staging and performance were superb, and the cameras were unobtrusive, but thought that some of the performances, notably that of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, were a tad 'wooden'.

A few months later, we saw the broadcast performance, and were very pleasantly surprised. Hvorostovsky's performance was far from wooden: with the benefits of the TV camera, we could see every subtle nuance, every expression, every gesture. His was a performance of the highest standard. Bravo!

And here we find one of the differences between televised and live performances - the camera can pick up subtleties which just aren't visible from the back of the theatre (and exaggerate 'operatic acting'as it happens). True, watching a live performance has other advantages - the ambience, the freedom to choose what you want to look at, people-watching, the champagne during the intervals....

In the past, there have been other differences - poor direction, inadequate sound, extraneous noise, but this is no longer an issue. This Brian Large production is basically superb! Picture quality is excellent, reflecting the clever lighting effects on stage. Sound is crystal clear, with enough resolution to distinguish individual applause (ours must have been in there somewhere, I suppose). This recording, in many respects, is even better than the 'real thing'.

Putting technicalities to one side, the production itself was of the highest calibre. All the singers, without exception, were at the top of their form. Aria after aria ended in thunderous applause. Gergiev was amazing, extracting every ounce of emotion from Tchaikowsky's music.

The minimalist sets were, I thought, very clever. I particularly liked the first ballroom scene, where the dancers were crowded together in a slightly too small dance floor flanked by mis-matched chairs. The effect was of an impromptu ball run by a family who were comfortably off, but a little down-at-heel. The leaves, as a symbol of time passing, were very effective, particularly during the overture.

And now, I think, enough time has passed.

3260440,4,B000YCLRBA,"I am a big fan of Eugene Onegin and watched this opera several times at various opera houses, including once at Bolshoi (the ""old"" Bolshoi of 1980s). Therefore, I have had quite high expectations after seeing parts of this performance on TV a few months ago. Yesterday, after the DVD arrived in the mail, I could barely wait to get home to watch it. Honestly, I was disappointed.  Please do not get me wrong. This production is still very good, just it is not the ultimate Eugene Onegin I hoped it would be. Hvorostovsky is outstanding, he is definitely the best Onegin I ever heard. At the same time, Fleming as Tatiana is not as good as I expected. After watching this DVD, I listened for a while to my old CD set with Galina Vishnevskaya as Tatiana (Bolshoi, recorded in 1950s), and in my opinion Vishnevskaya's singing is highly superior to that of Fleming. Also, maybe a factor was the awful quality of the English translation, which totally emasculates the rich Pushkin poetry.  Sometimes I had the feeling Fleming had no idea what was the real meaning of the words she was singing, and it really spoiled the impression of her acting (wrong gestures, wrong expressions). At times, like in the middle of the first act (Onegin and Tatiana returning from their walk), she seemed not to know what to do and, rather than acting, was looking intently at Hvorostovsky for clues. This was disappointing. Overall, this is a good performance, and Hvorostovski is absolutely brilliant.

I suggest saving your rubles on the DVD and if you want to hear Vargas and Hvorostovsky get the CD where you will not be sickened by the minimalist trash production.
