1035044,1,6305474583,I was very disapointed that the copy I received is unusable in the USA.  I did not realize that untill I received it.  It is my mistake.  I thought it was obvious since it was being shipped to the USA that I would get a copy that I could play.  I would still love to find a copy that I can play here.  It is one of my favorits and would love to share it with my grandchildren. Next time I will red the discription more carefully.,1304899200,,429,3.8850574712643677
1035045,5,6305474583,"'One of our Dinosaurs is Missing' was a hard movie to find, but I found it on Amazon!  It was a bit pricy but since there were no others to be found, I got it.  You will enjoy it if you enjoy other Disney Classics.",1303084800,2,214,3.7333333333333334
1035046,1,6305474583,"This movie was about an hour too long.  Car chases went on and on and on and on.  Kids were bored and glad when it ended.

Seriously, we rented this because of the 5 star reviews.  This is NOT comparable to real 5 star movies like Toy Story or Monsters Inc or Follow Me Boys.",1298764800,2,275,3.9454545454545453

1035048,5,6305474583,When do we get this in a region 1 DVD?  So many other movies have come out on DVD that are out on VHS.  Has anyone else been waiting for this movie?,1161907200,14,148,3.59375
1035049,4,6305474583,"One Of Our Dinasaurs Is Missing didn't quite enjoy the heights of success it was anticipated to by Disney. Its a shame as this is actually an enjoyable, fun comedy with a cast of stars that includes Peter Unistov, Helen Hayes, Derek Nimmo and Joan Sims, who was more famous for her appearances in the classic Carry On film series. A top secret formula is hidden by aristocrat Derek Nimmo inside the skeleton of a dinasaur at the natural History Museum in London. Peter Unistov is mildly amusing as a Chinese agent where as Helen Hayes and Joan Sims are leaders of a gang of unlikeley nannies that even Mary Poppins wouldn't join! Livening things up is a silly, though amusing car chase, lots of kung fu fighting and some flamboyantly over-the-top acting makes this an overly good and entertaining film thats defintley worth a look.",1039996800,16,831,4.698630136986301

1035189,2,6305474583,"I rented this movie because I'm a fan of Walt Disney and his earlier movies. However, this movie did show the ""sign of the times"" with Caucasian actor(s) portraying as Chinese spies speaking their version of a Chinese accent. If you can over look this, it can be a comical movie.

However, my main gripe is the playback quality. Over half way through the movie, the digital quality became poor during a few scenes lasting less than 5 minutes. But none the less, when you purchase a movie to watch you hope that there aren't any issues with playback.",1398816000,,549,4.545454545454546

1035287,5,6305474583,"Go Disney!
  I love this movie but couldn't watch this copy.  I didn't know about Regions.  Since I'm in the good old USA, didn't translate.  But if you are in Region 2, buy it.  It is funny and you'll laugh at the ending.  I did.  Still would love this on DVD for the USA.  I don 't understand Disney keeping this from us.",1384560000,2,323,4.0
1035288,5,6305474583,Like the way they help me.  Gave good advise.  Wish they could let me know about old disney shows? I like the old ones best.,1383177600,,124,3.92
1035289,2,6305474583,"I bought this DVD as a gift. When it arrived it was not able to be played in Canada or the US. I had not realized what the 2 had meant. Now it is totally useless, I paid 35 dollars and was embarrassed that my gift was unusable. Why bother to sell a DVD in Canada, that is being shipped to a Canadian address, when it is unplayable. A total waste of money. Would not buy from this company again. It did arrive on time and was packaged well but a lot of good that did.",1382918400,,466,3.8645833333333335

1035345,3,6305474583,"Not the best film in the world, but certainly not the worst... unless you happen to be Asian.  Not sure why every Asian character had to be cast by a Caucasian in makeup, but that's what they did.  Maybe so Peter Ustinov wouldn't stand out so horribly in his own shady makeup.  I'd like to say it's a kind of fun film, but in all honesty shortly after I rented this film I let it play while I did some odds and ends around the house, checking in periodically.  So as background noise it was delightful, but as something to sit and watch all the way through it might be asking a bit much.  I like Robert Stevenson's other films; The Love Bug, Blackbeard's Ghost among a few others but this one is one dinosaur that might be better served if it stayed missing.",1376438400,,758,4.236111111111111
1035346,4,6305474583,"This is a Disney film that is rarely seen.  It was not available for many years, quite possibly due to some of the content.  Peter Ustinov pays a Chinese man and the caricature could be viewed as mildly offensive.  Beyond that, it is silly fun and boasts enjoyable performances by Ustinov and Helen Hayes.  Young children may not be able to follow the story on their own or find the movie too slow.",1372723200,,398,4.410958904109589

1035349,4,6305474583,"Not being a big fan of most ""entertainment"" options available today it is really wonderful that classic films such as ""One Of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing"" are available via streaming now on Amazon.

I would strongly suggest that you check Amazon pricing prior to purchasing any films such as this from Apple on iTunes as I have found Amazon to be better priced most every time.

Pop yourself some popcorn and settle in to enjoy this film.",1365638400,2,435,4.636363636363637
1035350,3,6305474583,"This is a rare Disney film to find in any digital format and after watching, it's fairly easy to see why. Although it is funny at times, overall it just seems a little forced. I think Helen Hayes and her band of nannies are the most entertaining. The actors playing Asians are hard to watch with so much makeup caked on their faces.

One of the best things about this is the pristine quality of the picture and sound, probably due to the fact that the film has rarely been handled and locked up tight in storage.",1357516800,5,512,4.278350515463917

I didn't realize until after it arrived and I read on the jacket that it will only play in players made in the U.K.? Since when are Disney movies and DVDs not made to play in American systems? I know this is a very old Disney movie but my daughter had heard about it so I searched for it on Amazon and found it. All other Disney movies I've bought on Amazon play just fine, regardless of how old they are. Why not this one? I imagine I made a mistake by purchasing it but was very disappointed.",1484524800,,588,3.9915254237288136
