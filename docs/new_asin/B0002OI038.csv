8029889,4,B0002OI038,I have the entire TV DVD collection and I just loved it.  This was good and has all the characters that were in the TV series it's just that the story line was not as good.  With that said if you are a big fan of Dad's Army as I am then I would recommend you getting a copy of this movie and i'm sure you will enjoy it.,1460592000,,319,3.608695652173913

8029891,5,B0002OI038,"Any fan of british comedy will love this movie adaptation of the UK hit, Dad's Army. Though it's available in Region 2 video, I was able to watch it on my PC.",1439510400,,158,3.96875
8029892,4,B0002OI038,"The most exciting thing regarding this movie was getting it from England. For some reason I thought it was cool ordering a movie from across the pond. It took a full 6 weeks to get it and that was by air mail. It must have been a slooow plane. The movie itself was pretty good. If I had not had the collection of dad's army I probably would have given it a 5 star. The movie really started at the beginning of how the home guard was formed and how all the characters were brought together. It kind of expanded on the first TV episode and as most UK viewers were probably familiar with Dad's Army it was kind of redundant(American meaning not British). The movie follows the same theme as the TV series. Arthur Lowe leads a group of mostly senior volunteers who make up the local home guard. Through Captain Mamring's (Lowe) leadership they are the madcap group of all the home guard units for that area. They frolic from one misadventure to another. Totally incompetent they stumble into ways to save the day in spite of themselves. The movie is a lot of fun to watch. I have seen it twice since it arrived. I need to get my monies worth. The movie is used as I don't believe there are any new ones out there, but it was in great condition. The British are very considerate with providing subtitles for us yanks who can't understand the queen's English. From what I could tell region 2 is the only region available. Prices range from $6.00 on up to the ridiculous. I paid a little over $6.00 and $4.00 for shipping. It certainly was worth the experience.",1428451200,,1554,4.380622837370242
