5562937,5,B00B886412,"When I heard that Iced Earth was putting out a new dvd I was so Excited. They have really been tearing it up since their newest album dystopia. After all the years Iced Earth has been formed, this concert dvd their true passion for their music and their energy. With Stu Block as their singer they have become stronger and more united than ever. He can hit the high notes like tim owens and can come close to the low notes of Matt Barlow. I loved this dvd from start to finish. This is probably by far one of the best Concert dvd I've ever seen. Long live Iced Earth",1366243200,4,566,4.154545454545454
5562938,5,B00B886412,"Stu Block has managed to do what I thought was impossible - do justice to material from Iced Earth's full discography, and originally sung by no less than 4 different people. He can out-scream Ripper, and even out-emote Harlow. And the whole band sounds tight, energized, and the crowd is INTO it. That a band this far into their career can pull off a live album like this is really remarkable.

If you like Iced Earth - old stuff or new - this is a must buy. And if you like power metal at all - grab it.

Now I just have to wait for the Blu-ray to come out in the U.S.",1366070400,23,570,4.035398230088496
5562943,5,B00B886412,"Live In Ancient Kourion is a live concert Blu-Ray from the American Power Metal band Iced Earth. It was filmed at the ancient Kourion Theater in Limasol, Cyprus (a site with a 6,000-year history according to the liner notes) in 2012, in support of the Dystopia album. The line up features Jon Schaffer, Brent Smedley, Troy Steele, Luke Appleton and then-new singer Stu Block.

The career-spanning set contains 27 songs from all eras of the bands history, in a concert that lasts around 2 hours and 35 minutes. Its pretty great value for money in that regard.

The performance is very strong indeed, with all band members putting down solid performances with no weak links. Stu capably handles the material of previous singers Matt Barlow and Tim Ripper Owens in a suitable but distinctive way. He fits the band perfectly and is immensely talented. Elsewhere; the dual guitar lines and solos are sublime and the drumming is powerful and rock-solid. If you like Iced Earth then this is a really strong and representative example of what they are all about.

Highlights include strong performances of Burning Times, Wolf, Declaration Day, Days Of Rage and Dantes Inferno. Boiling Point and Damien are also especially energetic and exciting here  if you were wondering if youd enjoy this release, then I suggest trying those two tracks out.

The stage design and the simple, tasteful lightshow in conjunction with the well-integrated use of smoke and pyro perfectly complements the bands meaty, honest approach to Metal music. The crowd get into it and both clap and sing along on many occasions. Sometimes not only singing the words but also the guitar melodies. The concert really shows a confident band delivering their best to an appreciative crowd.

The camerawork and editing are absolutely solid, the audio recording quality and live mix are spot-on and overall this is a very strong release on both the audio and visual fronts. Sometimes youll get a DVD with way too many flashy transitions and cheesy editing choices, or the bass guitar missing from the mix, but a lot of care has obviously gone into making this a tasteful and musician-friendly affair. Admittedly I have seen concert Blu-Rays with better picture quality (Sabaton, Gamma Ray, Stratovarius and Hammerfall spring to mind) and here it can be a tiny bit grainy, soft-focus or washed out at times depending on the lighting conditions in the venue at the time however just because better examples exist, it doesnt mean the picture here is anything to complain about.

In terms of bonus features there are photo galleries (4 minutes of very high resolution photos of the band and the beautiful Cypriot landscape), a 9-minute world tour story (breaking down the logistics involved such as how many guitar picks and flights the band went through) which mixes photos and graphics with interview footage, as well as the 31-minute Documentary feature The Making Of Live At Ancient Kourion.

The version I got comes with a slipcase in a digibook-style box which contains booklet featuring photos, credits and liner notes from bandleader Jon Shaffer. It houses the Blu-Ray version, DVD version and CD version of the concert for maximum flexibility.

The Blu-Ray specs are as follows: Region 0, Format 16:9, Audio comes in a choice of Dolby Digital 2.0 or DTS HD Surround 5.1.

Overall; Live In Ancient Kourion, especially this edition, is a very worthwhile release and I whole-heartedly recommend it to fans of the band, or fans of Traditional Heavy Metal and Power Metal in general.",1394236800,3,3541,4.986440677966102
5562945,5,B00B886412,Who doesn't LOVE Iced Earth! This is a gift for my husband...he is going to LOVE IT! We have seen them in concert several times and looking forward to the tour this coming spring!,1386892800,,179,4.294117647058823
5562946,5,B00B886412,"These guys had a lot to live up to with this album considering the monster that is ""Alive In Athens"", which in many a metalheads opinion is one of the greatest greatest live albums ever.  Is this as good?  Not quite, but it is surprisingly close and worthy of 5 stars.  Stu is great, flawlessly singing all eras of the bands' material.  He doesn't exactly have the wittiest stage banter, but that is just nitpicking because it is really about the music.  The song selection is great, spanning Iced Earth's entire career.  The highlight here has got to be ""Dante's Inferno"", in its' full 18-minute glory.  The new songs sound great too.  All Iced Earth fans, new and old, need to get this!",1383177600,,688,4.536585365853658

5562950,5,B00B886412,"A very well made video.  The concert itself was excellent - great effects.  Had no idea where or what
Ancient Kourion was.  Now I know.

I was surprised at how quickly the video got here.  Shipper did very well.  No issues there either.",1372809600,,236,4.372093023255814

5562952,5,B00B886412,"While the Alive in Athens live collection is perhaps a bit better, this live recording does an excellent job showcasing both the band's skills and Stu Block's excellent vocals.",1372204800,,176,5.103448275862069
5562953,2,B00B886412,"To get started, I must state that I love Iced Earth. Which, unfortunately, will make this review painful.

I can honestly only recommend this live DVD/Blu-ray to people who are die hard Iced Earth fans. The reason? Block's voice. While he sounds great on the album, he does not do well here at all. It is hard to describe how his voice sounds, but comparing it to a 12 year old boy would not be unwarranted. If you don't believe me, buy it. You will most likely regret it. His voice shows none of the power that is present on Iced Earth's latest offering, Dystopia. That major issue, combined with the fact that the sound of the pyrotechnics occasionally cover the sound of Stu's voice (blessing or curse? I cannot decide) makes this a not-so-great purchase. You would be better off borrowing this from a friend, or simply sticking with older Iced Earth DVDs, such as Alive in Athens, or even Festivals of the Wicked.

At first I was extremely excited for this new singer, but if their live shows are all going to be a repeat of Live in Ancient Kourion, then I have no choice but to find myself a new band.",1371081600,3,1106,4.416666666666667
5562954,5,B00B886412,I simply love it. Great performance!!! Iced Earth always delivers!! No need to say much. A must have item to add to collection!!!!,1370476800,,130,4.695652173913044
5562957,5,B00B886412,This is the Live After Death for the 2010's. What an excellent live recording! Stu Block is easily one of the best voices in metal today and makes a magnificent addition to Iced Earth.,1369526400,,184,4.4411764705882355
8564020,3,B00B886412,"Ouch. Just ouch. The production quality is top notch. Unfortunately the performance suffers majorly because of Stu's vocals. His blatant attempt to clone Matt Barlow's singing style does not come through successfully. His voice is weak and untrained and it shows. Because of this, the whole performance basically falls apart. At times you can even read on Jon Schaffer's face that he feels unsatisfied. Iced Earth used to be one of my favorite bands but after the debacle of juggling 3 different singers and putting out at least 3 mediocre albums, it's time to put the band to bed, Jon. I'm just keeping it real.
Then there's the issue with their new music. The last 2 albums (featuring Stu on vocals) offer absolutely nothing of merit for the Iced Earth catalog. They come across sounding like cliche knock-offs of their old material.
If you want to see this band at their best, buy the Alive in Athens DVD. If you want more then pick up the Festivals of the Wicked DVD which has 2 excellent full concerts featuring Barlow on vocals. Now THAT is Iced Earth.",1466553600,,1058,4.693548387096774
