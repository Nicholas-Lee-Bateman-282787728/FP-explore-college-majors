8726135,5,B012G7IO5M,"David Oyelowo and Kate Mara enact an extremely powerful suspense story of redemption.  In Atlanta, Georgia in 2005, a convict named Brian Nichols escaped and committed acts of murder in the process.  He made his new hiding place the home of Ashley Smith, a single mother who couldn't even have custody of her daughter because she was addicted to meth.  She had been given a copy of The Purpose Driven Life, which has become a household name because it's one of the most popular Christian books ever, but was not very motivated to read it.  Indeed, when this story hit the news, it became a major boost for the book's success.  After undergoing seven hours of captivity by Brian Nichols, Ashley finally experienced a miracle:  He allowed her to read the book aloud, she turned to chapter 32 and read it aloud, and it softened his spirit.  She was able to get her freedom.

The movie's cinematography/camerawork is very good.  The acting by David Oyelowo is truly Oscar-worthy.  That actor carries a strong presence, and it's quite an achievement that he was able to play such a fully believable criminal, who is tormented inside, ruthless, but also hesitant to kill people who haven't provoked him.  He played the pacifist Martin Luther King in the movie Selma just last year!  I was reminded of Captain Phillips (2013 movie starring Tom Hanks) when I saw how he kept having to threaten her in his desperation for leverage against the government, fearing they would not let him see his son in prison if he turned himself in.  I find it sad that to this day, Ashley has not been able to reconnect with Brian Nichols as he's in prison, nor can his son meet him until he turns 18.  Somehow, though, even though it's definitely bittersweet, the mood that the movie captures at the end is gladness at how Ashley gained victory over her sin issue of drug addiction, and that she's doing well and ministering to other addicts now.  But this movie also has entertainment value as a suspense thriller with extraordinary acting.",1442966400,,2017,4.706552706552706
