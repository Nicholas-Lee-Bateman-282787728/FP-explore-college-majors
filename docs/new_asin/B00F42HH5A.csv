8612194,5,B00F42HH5A,"I watched this on a flight from Tokyo to DC a few years ago.  It was subtitled.  The time-frame is a little difficult to figure other than post-WW2 during Japan's economic recovery.  Much of the story is well told.  This is about a man who leaves his parents' farm in rural Japan, becomes relatively successful in Tokyo or some other big city then returns to help on the farm after some kind of trouble.  He is well liked by his family and the community but he's quirky.  He marries a local girl he knew in school.  His father-in-law is quietly supportive of his efforts.  The acting was good.  The relationships were appealing and the story was compelling.  It's the only movie I remember watching on that 11 hr flight.  The only possible criticism is that this man and his family went through a lot to reach the end but in retrospect that struggle is integral to the story.  I'd like to see it again.",1466812800,,902,4.432926829268292
