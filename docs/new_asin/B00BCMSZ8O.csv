5578682,4,B00BCMSZ8O,Good editing.  I have some older telenovelas in my collection & it was a real waste of time & money. I don't have the patience to follow a telenovela for 1 or almost 2 years so I rely on the shorter versions but I want to be able to understand the story and this is a cute enjoyable one :-),1371513600,5,290,3.8333333333333335

5578709,3,B00BCMSZ8O,"I got these DVDs because I was half way through the series when Netflix decided to stop streaming it and I almost lost my mind!  I'm thankful I had these as an option, but I only give them three stars because I was really disappointed that these DVDs cut a lot of the best parts of the series, like pretty much all the romantic scenes and dialogues between JC and Elena.  Not a deal breaker, but details are really important to me, and with this version, I felt I missed a lot of crucial dialogues that were in the original version.  Other than that, quality, price and delivery were great.",1461110400,10,590,4.345454545454546

The problem is, I don't speak Spanish and he had to translate for me as there are no subtitles.  I was so excited to discover this DVD which does have subtitles.  It really is an entertaining show.  Jaime Camil and Lucero are outstanding.",1407369600,5,357,4.415384615384616

5578776,5,B00BCMSZ8O,"I guarantee that you will be laughing all the way to the end with this funny-fast paced romantic comedy! It is comedy but also the story presents a great message for society. Mrs. Rosy O'Campo, well known producer, hits another home run in her very successful career with ""Por Ella Soy Eva"". Add to that Benjamin Cann's masterful direction and the wonderful acting of Lucero, Jaime Camil, Patty Navidad, Jesus Ochoa, Helena Rojo, Carlos Bracho, Leticia Perdign, Manuel Ojeda, Tiar Scanda, Mariana Seoane, Christina Pastor, Carlos de la Mota, Marcelo Cordoba, Luis Manuel Avila, Nikolas Caballero and without a doubt the result is a winning combination.

5578778,5,B00BCMSZ8O,"A must see telenovela!  I have seen whole in original form with Polish subtitles/dubbling on one of the international tv channels. Jaime Camil became my personal favorite. I don't remember laughing so much in a long time watching any other telenovela.
I predict with a great roles, Jaime Camil will become one of the most heard names in the world.
If you want to laugh, cry and watch great telenovela - this is it!",1387238400,,414,4.594594594594595

5578781,5,B00BCMSZ8O,"Yes, this one earns its stars with solid performances by the lead superstars, high production values and even good editing to disk. The writing includes hysterical scenes--the bad girl who can't spend the night with her boy because she's afraid he'll kill her in her sleep. This one is lifted way above average by the supporting cast. Jesus Ochoa (Don Adriano) is a high point--veering from slapstick to pathos and balancing Jaime's drama perfectly. It gets an extra star for minimizing the violence that is creeping into the resolution of too many novels--though it does include one gratuitous armed confrontation and police chase.",1377216000,,632,5.145631067961165

It about love from man to woman... A man who convert from man to

5578785,3,B00BCMSZ8O,"Por ella soy Eva (For Her, I'm Eva - 857 minutes) Terrible acting... Too much slapstick humor, but a wonderful, feminist script. This DVD set is from Amazon.com.

Eva is a lovely woman played by Lucero; she is a flunky in an extremely misogynistic real estate firm. She submits a proposal for a resort development. Jaime Camil plays one of the partners who makes a serious business error while planning to seduce her; the company must quickly downsize, so 40 women are let go without notice; she is one of them. Eva tries to get her proposal back but it has already been tossed.

Later the partners hear about a hot new area for resorts and he remembers her proposal. They dig it of the garbage and our story begins.

The horn-dog who was in the process of seducing her is in a car wreck and everyone thinks he died. He comes back dressed as ""Eva"" and applies for a job. We are treated to all sorts of unfair treatment of women and girls while he struggles to fix his bungle and save the company.

One very young woman is having a fling with the CEO; when her father bursts in with a gun it turns out he is one of the partners. He is horrified to see his close friend in a compromising position with his daughter.  The guilty man asks the girl if she ever felt anything for him and she replies in pure Valley Girl that she totally didn't care for him she just wanted her father to see how stupid it looks for men their age to date women young enough to be their daughters. The father lowers the gun and averts his face. A great moment!

I loved watching three adults trying to jam into a SmartCar to follow the villainess. This has a goofy ending, but every one lives happily ever after.",1372464000,,1687,4.289308176100629
8566235,1,B00BCMSZ8O,I feel betrayed. I bought this expecting to be able to watch the full episodes and was disappointed to find out that this DVD was heavily edited. I will be returning this.,1511827200,,171,4.375

8566240,1,B00BCMSZ8O,"The price is reasonable. I would love to know where I can get all the 166 episodes regardless of the cost. This was on Netflix but only for one year. I found a website that sells all of them but it's not a secure connection (not safe for credit/debit cards or passwords). If anyone out there knows a secure website where I can buy all episodes, PLEASE let me know. Thanks.",1498348800,,372,4.253521126760563
8566241,4,B00BCMSZ8O,"Out of all the fast and furiously edited telenovelas which disappointed me, this was by far the only one that was OK and very funny to boot so much so that my husband got hooked on it!.  I began to watch this Telenovela while I was in Chile for a period of 4 weeks and so I was aware of how much was edited out, however this editing was far more skillful and considerate than the other telenovelas.

The storyline is similar to the Tootsie story but with a very funny Mexican twist and the lead actor, Jaime Camil couldn't be better in the role. They should have made a movie of this.",1484265600,,584,4.15929203539823
8566242,3,B00BCMSZ8O,"I love this soap opera, one of my favorites and that is why I chose to buy it,  however, when I received it and was so looking forward to watching the whole thing again,  I was disappointed to find out that this version is all chopped up.  the episodes are only 15 minutes long at most, it almost feels like i purchased the collection of all the trailers for each episode. I was looking forward to watching all 160 episodes and not the highlight reel  Wish I actually got what I thought I was purchasing.",1478649600,,504,4.273684210526316

8566244,1,B00BCMSZ8O,If I could give it a zero I would. It's horribly edited and a disservice to those that would live the original telenovela which was funny and moving. This jigsaw puzzle will confuse anyone that has not seen the original. I wish I had sent back for a refund. I recommend no one purchase this boot leg type of junk.,1470009600,2,313,4.233333333333333
