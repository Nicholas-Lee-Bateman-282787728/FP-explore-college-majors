7992935,4,B00009RXLN,"This is an 8 DVD retro wrestling set. Each DVD focuses on a particular theme or ""before they were famous"" wrestler. The wrestling footage is from around the late 80's till the mid 90's with most of it in the early 90's.

There are a handful of matches from the AWA, World Class, and UWF. Good ol' JR also does some commentary on a match or two. The bulk of the matches takes place in the famous Dallas Sportatorium, the house of the Von Erichs. However, there are no Von Erichs on these DVD's.

The majority of the matches seem to be from an organization called Renegade Ramage, always on display in the center of the ring. A Jerry Lawler vs Mark ""The Undertaker"" match took place in a closet-sized ring, pretty claustrophobic! Here is a breakdown of each DVD and all the matches:

Additionally, Mr USA Tony Atlas does an in-studio commentary segment before every match for the Cactus Jack, Steve Austin, and Booker T DVD's. Still got those huge ""guns"". By the way, Buff ""Handsome Stranger"" Bagwell is hilariously ""queer"" with this early gimmick. The audio on some matches is not that good. All in all this is a pretty solid package, with plenty of old-school wrestling action. Would be an especially excellent value if it could be found for under $30.",1216771200,3,3981,4.897321428571429
