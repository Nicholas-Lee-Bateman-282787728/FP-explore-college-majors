What I was after when I bought this dual feature was the film, ""Let It Ride.""  I had seen the film on the pay TV channels, but was dismayed when I was ready to buy it that it was unavailable on DVD, unless I wanted to pay Collector's prices!

""Let It Ride"" is a great ensemble film with hardly ever a dull moment.  (My dull moment is most of the sequence in the club for the rich folks.)  However, the rest of the film is very interesting as a usually down on his luck gambler has an incredibly good day at the track.

I recommend this film very highly.

3170166,5,B0017CW5T4,I've never watched Lucky Numbers.  Let It Ride is a truly under rated movie.  It is a hysterical Richard Dreyfuss comedy with an outstanding cast for a character study.  It reminds me of movies from the 30's or 40's when many movies were planned around great character actors and their parts.  This is one of my favorite comedys.,1404950400,,329,4.620689655172414

However, the movie seems to be out of print and so for those of us that do want to purchase the stand-alone movie, we are forced to buy this version unless we want to pay through the nose.  Many times when manufacturers make compilations or DOUBLE FEATURES they combine well-known movies with movies that are less-than-known or box office flops.  This is surely the case.

3170187,5,B0017CW5T4,"Somebody at Paramount is truly inspired in paring these two films together.  A couple months back I bought ""Back to the Beach"" and ""Brain Candy"" on a single disc and that was as inspired as this double feature.  I went looking for ""Let It Ride"" as a solo and I got ""Lucky Numbers"" as a bonus.  I saw ""Let It Ride"" on cable years ago because I'm a huge David Johansen fan and it stayed with me.  Both films have something of a checkered past.  ""Let It Ride"" was released in the waning days of the Summer of '89 and was met with critical and commercial indifference.  ""Lucky Numbers"" met a similar fate being released the same weekend as ""Meet the Parents"".  John Travolta was kind of on the outs at that time having foisted ""Battlefield Earth"" on an unsuspecting public in early 2000.  What took me by surprise was that the film was directed by Nora Ephron.  There's virtually none of the schmaltz of ""Sleepless In Seattle"" apparent here.  The film seems inspired by Elmore Leonard by way of Quentin Tarantino.  What distinguishes the film is not so much plot but mood and characterization.  On paper these characters are not that sympathetic but Ephron has assembled a talented cast, stars Travolta and Lisa Kudrow no exception, that imbue enough humanity to make them palatable.  I particularly liked Tim Roth as a sleazy club owner and Bill Pullman as a lazy cop.  ""Let It Ride"" stylistically is the polar opposite of ""Lucky Numbers"".  It's a genteel fable about a poor schmuck(Richard Dreyfuss) who's having a great day at the racetrack.  Director Joe Pytka has a great eye for detail and creating atmosphere.  I've never been to the track though I used to work minutes away from one but this film makes a day at the races very inviting.  Pytka also assembles a terrific ensemble that not only includes the aforementioned Johansen, but Teri Garr, Jennifer Tilly, Allen Garfield, Michelle Philips, and Robbie Coltrane.  One begins to wonder what other terrific double-bills Paramount has in it's vaults.  Just this morning I stumbled across a two-flick set of ""Brain Donors"" and ""Critical Condition"" with Richard Pryor!",1301184000,2,2121,4.774725274725275

What took me by surprise was that the film was directed by Nora Ephron.  There's virtually none of the schmaltz of ""Sleepless In Seattle"" apparent here.  The film seems inspired by Elmore Leonard by way of Quentin Tarantino.  What distinguishes the film is not so much plot but mood and characterization.  On paper these characters are not that sympathetic but Ephron has assembled a talented cast, stars Travolta and Lisa Kudrow no exception, that imbue enough humanity to make them palatable.  I particularly liked Tim Roth as a sleazy club owner and Bill Pullman as a lazy cop.  ""Let It Ride"" stylistically is the polar opposite of ""Lucky Numbers"".  It's a genteel fable about a poor schmuck(Richard Dreyfuss) who's having a great day at the racetrack.  Director Joe Pytka has a great eye for detail and creating atmosphere.  I've never been to the track though I used to work minutes away from one but this film makes a day at the races very inviting.  Pytka also assembles a terrific ensemble that not only includes the aforementioned Johansen, but Teri Garr, Jennifer Tilly, Allen Garfield, Michelle Philips, and Robbie Coltrane.  One begins to wonder what other terrific double-bills Paramount has in it's vaults.  Just this morning I stumbled across a two-flick set of ""Brain Donors"" and ""Critical Condition"" with Richard Pryor!",1301184000,2,2121,4.774725274725275

Richard is very entertaining to watch with his antics and the banter with his sidekick is too funny to miss. Great dialog on all counts. If you missed this movie, you have missed out on a great ride. A must have to any collection.",1296086400,2,392,4.24

both of them, Richard Dreyfuss is really funny, he always
works with a great cast, this movie is one of many talked
about movies. I can watch it over and over again.

Lucky Numbers is a good movie, John Travolta is a great actor
He made a lot of great films, he is a well known actor, and his
career started with Welcome Back Kotter I liked John ever since.",1296086400,,419,4.048192771084337

Richard Dreyfuss and Terri Garr are perfect but David Johansen and Jennifer Tilly just kill me! Every character is a masterpiece. Music by Gorgio Moroder is an extra added delight.

3404715,4,B0017CW5T4,"#1)  Apparently, mine was not considered a purchase from Amazon, because if the purchase HAD been considered to be from Amazon, I would not have been charged $16 for shipping.

And, the way I look at it, I could not have bought the DVDs from anyone else, because I only shopped at Amazon.  Go figure.

... another one bit the dust !

#2)  Look at the ad:  It says ""2pk [dvd], but they were NOT 2-pack DVDs; they were each, one disc, two-sided, and unmarked.
