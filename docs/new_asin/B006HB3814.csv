4989309,5,B006HB3814,We got this last holiday season and are looking forward to pulling it out again this year.  Everyone that came by last year during the holidays really enjoyed it.  It has the option for music or just the sounds of a crackling fire.,1317859200,3,231,4.348837209302325

4989314,4,B006HB3814,"I would have given a 5-star rating if there were more frequent & lingering Disney pop-up characters. If you blink, you'll miss them but the grandkids do enjoy the changing fireplace bursts of colors and of course, the Christmas music. Me too!",1369094400,2,242,4.785714285714286
4989315,4,B006HB3814,"Cute intro, lovely log effects, a little light on ""Disney"". Appearances by the characters are few and far between. If you're a Disney addict, as is my daughter, for whom this was a gift, you'll love it. She does.",1367712000,,212,4.461538461538462
4989316,5,B006HB3814,I searched for a nice fireplace dvd and I think this is the best animated fire you can get.. and it's not only fire you can also add xmas carrols and there is always a shadow of some disney caracter... so its never borring,1360195200,2,222,4.068181818181818
4989317,5,B006HB3814,"I saw this online and debated with myself but decided I had to have it.  So glad I got it!  I love that you can have music or not-that made it so nice at a party I had. And though the DVD is an hour long, it seamlessly repeated over and over. This will come out every Christmas!",1358553600,,278,3.7758620689655173
4989318,5,B006HB3814,this was just what we needed on Christmas morning and throughout the day to watch/listen to. Enjoyable for all those who truly love Disney!,1357862400,,139,4.833333333333333
4989319,3,B006HB3814,"I've wanted this DVD for a couple of years now, but I thought it was a lot of money for a burning log.  Well, my love of Disney wore me down and I ordered the DVD. It's only 58 minutes long, and the animations are insanely brief if your not waiting for it, you will miss them. The animations only pop up every 50 seconds to a 1:10.  It's really cute and nice for background noise. I love when the fire changes color, I REALLY wish it did that more.",1351468800,8,448,3.966666666666667
4989320,4,B006HB3814,This DVD was great for background music during Christmas. All the different little Disney friends that pop in make it Very entertaining,1325980800,5,135,5.181818181818182

8498268,5,B006HB3814,"A wonderful, relaxing DVD. I had to watch it twice through because I kept missing some of the visual affects that kept popping up. The dragon that turns the flames green is really great. Set to various Christmas songs, it will entertain you over and over. I am glad I bought it and after watching it, I promptly bought a second one as a gift.",1448582400,,342,4.276923076923077

8498272,5,B006HB3814,"I bought a second copy so I wouldn't need to keep moving it back and forth between the DVD player in my living room and my den.

NOTE:  I have both the 2011 and the pre-2011 versions. I prefer the older version because the animations are less noticeable; sometimes large, colorful cartoons appear in the 2011 version, which make the fireplace seem more like a television show and less like a virtual fireplace.  In the older version, the Disney animations blend in, appearing more like shadows or scintillating, floating debris.

When you play this DVD the first time, after putting it in a DVD player, it displays the Disney, animated logo, then a splash screen which offers the options of watching the fireplace with Christmas carols or sound effects.  After selecting one of these options, you see a splash screen which offers wide-screen or full-screen options.  After selecting one of these options, you get to see another animated Disney logo, a disclaimer, and an F.B.I. anti-piracy warning.  Then the scene opens on a starry sky, from which Tinkerbell descends to pass Mickey and Minnie, Daffy and Daisy, and other Disney characters, on her way into a home, where she lights the fireplace with a wave of her magic wand.  Then the ""camera"" remains on the fireplace indefinitely, while you either hear the quiet crackling of the fire, or Christmas carols.  After about an hour, the screen goes blank for a moment, the resumes without showing the intro scene again.  If you're not paying attention, you won't even notice it.

There are approximately two dozen carols, most of which I recognize, including ""The Twelve Days of Christmas,"" sung with ad lib by Mickey, Minnie, and other Disney characters; ""Joy to the World"" (instrumental, and later a version with a choir singing in English and, if I'm not mistaken, Latin); ""Jingle Bells"" (instrumental with chorus ""ah's"", and later an instrumental only version); ""Good King Wenceslas""; ""Jolly Old Saint Nicholas"" (an instrumental and later a male soloist version); ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" (instrumental); ""What Child Is This?"" (choir with accompaniment); ""Oh, Christmas Tree"" (choir a cappella); ""Silent Night"" (children's choir); ""The First Noel"" (instrumental); ""Oh, Holy Night!"" (children's choir); ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen!"" (instrumental); and ""Deck the Halls"" (intrumental, and later, a Disney character version).",1417737600,4,2385,5.1688311688311686
