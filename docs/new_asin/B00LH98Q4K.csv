8665854,4,B00LH98Q4K,"I have neither bought nor viewed this product. It seems similar to another product that has ten SH films and the 39 half-hour episodes filmed in France in the early 1950's with Ronald Howard and H. Marion Crawford.
That product has ten movies: 5 from the 1930's produced in England, 4 from the 1940's produced in Hollywood w/ Basil Rathbone, and 1 from 1962 made in Germany with Christopher Lee.
These are all worth viewing even if the quality of the videos are not the greatest.",1496880000,,479,4.5813953488372094
8665855,2,B00LH98Q4K,"The quality of the videos is really poor.  It takes a while to get used to the visual, but it's nice to see the older shows.  We expected better.",1421712000,,145,3.9655172413793105
