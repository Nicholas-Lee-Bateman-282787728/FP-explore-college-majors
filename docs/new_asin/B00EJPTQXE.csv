I just viewed this DVD...and I must say it was more than what I expected. I thought I really knew The Voice...but I was mistaken. The DVD was exciting, thorough and well organized. The X Man did an excellent job putting Maurice's life into two hours. Maurice lets his listener's in his private as well as his professional life, a life of so much hard work, dedication and achievements. I watched with a smile and sometimes tears; it brought back so many memories. I can't believe the dvd is only $19.99... it's definitely worth more; but knowing Maurice he wanted to make it affordable for his listeners. Thank you Maurice for allowing us to share you for 30 years. Thirty years of breaking your back for your Continue Reading

He has millions of fans throughout the world, who support him with his concerts in Atlantic City each year and R&B weekends in the Poconos every fall. He is the best at what he does.

A well put together can't take my eyes off type of project that i would recommend to anyone who ask me what i think.

I was thoroughly impressed with the the interviews, the footage, the commentators and most of all the production. It was a first class project and very entertaining.

5923770,5,B00EJPTQXE,"Maurice I just want to say that I have truly enjoyed watching the dvd....you will always have my support for life....I have laughed so hard watching you dance with Ali Woodson and singing Freddie Jackson ""You Are My Lady"".  You touched my heart as tears flowed listening the story about Ms. Queen who didn't even know her own family members and soon as you spoke she knew who you were and Ms. Janet who husband was sick and when you asked her to get a radio for him and he came around, you are truly an inspiration and a guardian angle.  I love the story about how you met Tammy and how the tow of you always dressed alike that was true love cause you'll was sharp, love how during the birth of MJ how you allowed your listeners to be a part of your special moment.  Love the wonderful interviews from such great artist who's lives you have touched over the years especially Dennis Edwards who said it best you are truly a ""PIONEER"" in the business. You are a wonderful Husband, Father and Son.  I know you mother who is such a ""BEAUTIFUL"" woman is smiling down on you saying how proud she is to have a ""GREAT"" son like you.  Maurice you have a lovely home and a beautiful family thank you for sharing them with the world and your listeners.  I have never met no one who is so ""HUMBLE and ""CARING"" like you who always puts everyone else first, I thank you for all the love you have for me and the other listners of the The Love Zone, you always make me feel like apart of your family there is no other radio show on air that can ""TOP"" what you do and I will do what I can to keep you on the air.  I get to chat with other listners and like you say we say it you play it.  I love the part with your two nieces talking about your jeri curl but one thing I can say you had it going own for real.  Maurice I just want you to know that it's and ""HONOR"" to have you as a friend, I thank you for all that you do and always showing me love.

The testimonies of his supporters from all walks of life and from various levels of the entertainment industry prove that this DVD is a must have for anyone who wants to witness a testament of success and the sacrifices and hard work that go along with it... I highly recommend it to any entertainer.... aspiring or established... Kudos Maurice for being so transparent.",1419033600,,811,5.246153846153846
8606060,5,B00EJPTQXE,"I am a huge fan of Old School music, especially Love Songs and Ballads.  I met Maurice Watts for the first time at an R&B event  he was hosting, and during the event he would advertise his Radio Show, The Love Zone, which consist of classic R&B Love songs/Ballads. I have since became a regular member and recently purchased 30 Years behind the Mic.  In this Documentary, Maurice gives an excellent narrative of  his journey from Lead Choir Singer to having the No1. Radio Show on Friday Nights. Its an entertaining, humorous, and a  brutally honest look at Maurices passion for music, and his beautiful family life. Maurice gives you a window into his life, and it depicts the highs and lows of Radio and you discover that his passion for music and his fans were more important to him than commercialism. His talent goes beyond that of Radio Personality.  The interviews with friends and Celebrities surprised me a little. I had no idea Maurice was so loved and cherished, by artist such as Freddie Jackson, Dennis Edwards, Leon,  Gerald Albright, DTrain Williams,  Meli'sa Morgan, Alyson Williams,  Howard Hewett, LJ Reynolds, Kurtis Blow, just  to name a few. I did tear up when one of his listeners was ill and only responded to the sound of his voice.  I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and recommend it to music lovers everywhere.",1417392000,,1332,4.747826086956522
8606061,5,B00EJPTQXE,"I really enjoyed the DVD.  It was excellent, of course, I wouldn't expect anything else of Maurice Watts.  It was also a pleasure to see Ali Woodson, formerly of the Temptations--he's one of my favorites.  Thanks, again.",1399593600,,220,4.891891891891892
8606062,5,B00EJPTQXE,"Maurice Watts not only took you into his home and shared his personal life and stories, he displayed how his radio personality reaches far beyond the control board and into the lives for family and friends.  It is not often that you get a chance to really know the person behind the Mic and in this documentary you get that and more.  If you ever wanted to know what is Personality Radio; then, viewing this documented material will give you exactly what it is and how it works without boring you.  This one is a ""Keepsake!""",1395014400,2,524,4.4375
8606063,5,B00EJPTQXE,"I anticipated as what to expect from this DVD and I was not disappointed. I met Maurice by way of Facebook and through him introduced to his radio station and from that point on I was hooked, so to say the least when I heard about his 30 years behind the music, there was no way I could let this past me by. I had to have it. it's because of this DVD that I became even more aware of who Maurice really is. So, if you love music and love the Dee Jays that introduces and plays your favorite music then you will love knowing and learning how artist and Dee Jay's work hand and hand. This DVD is a must have!",1394928000,2,606,3.934959349593496
8606064,5,B00EJPTQXE,"I had no idea what to expect, however, I was almost immediately taken in by the warmth and genuineness of this amazing individual. Over time I had seen Maurice at various events, and there was always the realization that, ""hey, I know you,"" but could never specifically remember from where.  My God, it was everywhere!  This ""docu/bio"" is firstly very well done, and an enjoyable walk through not only the music world, but through the life of a very talented man.  Buy it, you will love it.",1394409600,,490,4.609195402298851
8606065,5,B00EJPTQXE,"Let me start by saying NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE, does it better than Maurice ""The Voice"" Watts when it comes to hosting events, and doing radio, something he has done for over 30 years. I loved the DVD to the point I have watched it no less than 10 times in its entirety. Every single time I see something new that either takes me back, or makes me smile. Never did I ever expect to see such a magnificent DVD produced because I always felt you have to see Maurice Watts in person to fully appreciate him. Boy was i fooled as were many others from New England to Mississippi. To hear so many celebrities talk on one DVD is almost unheard of in these times when everyone is out for self. But the respect Maurice has from his radio peers, celebrity friends, and personal friends, made it possible for people watching this DVD to actually hear the true voices of many of the performers we all have grown up with, loved, and enjoyed. So in a nutshell I strongly recommend everyone to go out and purchase this product, a product that will make you go back to a special time just as the music we hear on certain informercials do!  I just wish I could rate it 10 stars. Unfortunately I can only rate it a maximum of 5 stars on here. So 5 stars it is but with a bullet!",1394409600,,1262,4.151020408163265
8606066,5,B00EJPTQXE,"i thoroughly enjoyed watching this dvd. It is certainly a must have for your collection. Throughout the 30 years It chronicles the rise of Maurice's career as he balanced being a family man as he pursued his passion in the radio and entertainment field. He accrued a legion of fans with his radio show the Love Zone where ""The Voice"" as he is known professionally takes you to a special place where you can relax and unwind to the smooth grooves that are laid down each and every Friday for your listening pleasure. Another standout talent showcased in this documentary were his uncanny skills emceeing live events to throngs of patrons making it that much more spectacular. Maurice is currently grooming his son Maurice Jr to follow in his father's footsteps as  the next star on the horizon. This 2 hour film is captivating and fun and you will want to spread the word telling your friends that this dvd is well worth purchasing.",1394409600,,931,4.676829268292683
