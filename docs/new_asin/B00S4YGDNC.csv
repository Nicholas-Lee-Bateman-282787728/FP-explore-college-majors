8697295,5,B00S4YGDNC,"The Man Who Saved the World is a very difficult movie to categorize. Is it a docudrama, reality TV, documentary, autobiography or drama? It seems to fit each of those descriptions at different times. The description I read of the film beforehand was so vague that it took a good 30 minutes or so to even understand what I was seeing myself. The closest explanation that I can give is that it is an interwoven combination of all of the above. You will have to decide for yourself what parts of the movie fall into each category.

On its face, the story is pretty simple. Stamislav Petrov was an officer in charge of detection of incoming nuclear missile threats in the USSR in 1983. For reasons that are still not understood to this day, Soviet satellites reported to the Army that the United States had launched several nuclear warheads at the Soviet Union. Petrov's job was to report this threat to his commanders, who would in turn launch a counterattack that would have triggered World War III. Instead of trusting the Army's early warning system, he decided not to report the (eventually shown to be false) incoming attack to his superiors. Had he done as he had been instructed, by the book, none of us would be alive today. Rather that being recognized as a hero, he was derided by his superiors and the entire story was kept a deep secret until the end of the cold war.

In this documentary, or whatever you wish to label it, Petrov accepts an offer to travel to the United States with an interpreter to give a speech about what happened, accept an award and get to meet with a number of celebrities like Walter Cronkite, Matt Damon and eventually Kevin Costner, who is the only celebrity that Petrov seems to have heard of. Some of the scenes are obviously raw footage while others seem to be staged or perhaps re-creations of actual events. The line can be pretty blurry at times.

Underneath all of it is the story of a simple human being that suffers from a host of different problems and a lot more representative of the overall human race than he is of being a hero. The film balances the story of what was one of the most important events in human history with the story of a lone Soviet officer whose life eventually fell apart under the strain of his many problems, much as the Soviet Union itself fell apart at the end of the cold war.

The film cleverly uses Petrov's life as an analogy of that of the human race itself and begs the question if humanity was really worth saving in the first place. Petrov's view that we have learned nothing from the cold war and that nuclear war will eventually happen as a result hangs a pretty heavy atmosphere over the whole film, but there are just enough uplifting scenes to keep one from becoming deeply depressed over the entire situation. In the end, it is an extremely poignant and memorable film that will keep you hanging on until the end and thinking about long after you have finished watching it.",1522454400,,2962,4.520522388059701

8697299,4,B00S4YGDNC,"A truly human/humane movie that everyone needs to see. It's time to stop playing the nuclear weapon roulette game. We have been this close, we are this close, we will continue to be this close, unless humanity can find a way to allow both both its mind and its heart to evolve. That is why we are here, to clearly see each other as one. There simply is no other way forward.",1478304000,2,374,4.208333333333333
8697300,5,B00S4YGDNC,This documentary should be manadatory viewing for every citizen of the world -- we are all in debt to this man and also importantly to filmmaker Peter Anthony for telling the compelling story of Stanislav Petrov. It took him 10 years and a lot of guts and fortitude to make this film to bring to light what might have otherwise been left as a footnote in history. See this and you will understand that we need global and permanent disarmament of nuclear arms. Petrov is a global hero. #thankyoupetrov.,1477267200,2,501,4.640449438202247
8697301,5,B00S4YGDNC,"This movie should be watched for kid in the public schools. Fantastic kind of half documentary half drama. Telling in an artistic way with most of the real people no actors o better say actors playing them selves a chilling story about Nuclear disaster and how close we lived the end of humankind (WE HOPE THOSE TIMES ARE GONE)
Please watched and then go a decide for who you will be voting",1455840000,2,390,4.430555555555555
8697302,5,B00S4YGDNC,"This is the true story of an extraordinary event in September 1983, at the height of the Cold War, when the world was saved from a nuclear Armageddon by the cool thinking, insight and humanity of one man. That man was Soviet Army lieutenant colonel Stanislav Petrov, on duty that night in a nuclear early-warning centre outside Moscow. He was suddenly faced with a momentous decision and, if he had got it wrong, none of us would be here today.

The story is already covered in other reviews from Tommy Dooley and John S. Socha, with several more on the UK Amazon site. So I will avoid repetition here, summarise the story briefly, and just add a few thoughts of my own. That night, Soviet defence system computers detected the launch of five ballistic missiles from the United States, headed for Russia. But one by one, as the vital minutes ticked by, the radar systems failed to confirm the information. Petrov had about 10 minutes to decide whether to pass on the alarm to his superiors, who would order a massive retaliatory strike against the USA. Which was right, radar or computers? As Petrov himself said later, it was 50/50. And he made the right judgment, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this.

The movie covers, in tandem, both that momentous historical event  kept secret for many years  and the personal story of the man we have to thank for our lives. The intertwining of these two threads is one of the great virtues of this gripping, moving and frightening film. The central event itself, those minutes of tension and terror in Petrov's control bunker, is treated in a series of flashbacks that generate almost unbearable tension. That tension, in spite of the fact that we all know the outcome, is enhanced by an absolutely compelling performance from Sergey Shnyryov as the 44-year-old Petrov, well supported by his colleagues, and by Peter Anthony's excellent direction.

Then we have Petrov's personal story. Having saved the world, Petrov is hauled up before his superiors and severely reprimanded for not following correct procedures and for failing to keep a written log of his actions during those few fearsome minutes. So he doesn't get a thankyou, let alone a medal. He eventually leaves the army, a sad and angry man, and doesn't even tell his family about what has happened. His wife is dying of cancer, he no longer speaks to his mother. Even when, many years later, he is invited to the USA by Kevin Costner and other distinguished figures who have finally learned of his actions, he's still angry and reluctant. This is the thread where, in documentary style, we meet the real Petrov (played by himself) at the age of 67, accompanied for his U.S. visit by a young woman interpreter.

As mentioned above, the two threads of past and recent events are intertwined in the movie, to form a series of flashes back and forward. The procedure works well by repeatedly letting us see the older Petrov in the context of that momentous past event, and vice versa. Especially touching are the initially uneasy relationship between the older Petrov and the interpreter girl, very sensitively played by Nataliya Vdovina; also, the reception of Petrov at the U.N. And more touching still is his reception at the house of Kevin Costner with a gathering of his friends. Back home again in Russia, equally moving is the depiction of Petrov's relationship with his mother; but I won't spoil that part here.

The result is a sensitive portrayal of an angry, isolated but ultimately heroic man to whom we must all be profoundly grateful, and who is finally granted at least a measure of recognition  even though it was not in his own country. The film reminds us at various points of what would have happened to the world if someone else had been on duty that night. For those of us who lived through the Cold War, this film serves as a stark reminder of the risks our leaders were taking on our behalf.  And if you're too young for that it will tell you what it meant, what might have been, and what could still happen if, unlike Stanislav Petrov, somebody gets careless.",1448755200,10,4085,4.734177215189874
8697303,4,B00S4YGDNC,"In 1983 the Cold War was almost at absolute zero and relations could not really have been worse between the `super powers'. Nuclear arsenals were also so big they were enough to destroy the world many times over and the World spent more money on nuclear weapons in one day than all the money raised by `Live Aid'. Then on an ordinary night watch in the USSR's air defence control, the alarms start to ring. It is a pre emptive strike by the US on the USSR and Stanislav Petrov is in command - he has to decide how to react and the protocols mean a retaliatory strike.

This is his story and indeed the story of everyone from that day forth as if he had not acted as he did it is quite possible there would not be much of a World left to bother with. The film recreates that fateful night and other major incidents in his life. He plays himself in this and on being invited to America he gets to meet a lot of famous types including Kevin Costner - whom he is a big fan of.

They do use footage from 09/11 and other images to convey what destruction is. I thought this was a bit tactless and also misleading, nuclear war means never having to say you're sorry and is not recoverable on this scale. This is quite moving in places and it is also an indictment on how a system can treat a man who should be seen as a hero of the World - a compelling watch indeed.",1439424000,4,1359,4.105263157894737
