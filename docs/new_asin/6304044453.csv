8363140,4,6304044453,"First Loves 2 continues where First Loves 1 ends.  Also done by Pink  Pineapple, and subtitled by ADV.  Animation, coreography, sound, music, and  acting are all fairly good.  It's consistent with the first.
Anyway, so  our hero Kakeru now has a little bit of wisodm under his belt in the  relationship scene.  But a little wisdom can get you into a lot of trouble.  However heartbreak soon occurs as Kakaru's love from the first show,  Urara, leaves to go study in America leaving our hero heartbroken.  Still,  Kakeru cheers up when Rei (another freshman) befriends him. However, Rei is  on the tennis team, and leaving for tennis camp soon.  And, worse yet, our  hero's sister is going off to tennis camp with a known player!  And, this  same jerk, likes Rei too!
So Kakeru goes to tennis camp to try to keep  his sister out of trouble, and to try to win the heart of Rei.  Another  good chapter of this story.  It has a lot of romance and true feelings.  It  also has a lot of heartbreaks as you learn the Rei is crushed when she  finds the tennis captain (who she has a crush on) playing the  field.
Unfortunatley... this is where the series abruptly ends.
Overall, a good continuation from the first.  Another mature look at how  inexperience in the dating area can lead to a lot of ""dumb luck"",  a lot of hardships, and, most importantly, what real friends are  like.
