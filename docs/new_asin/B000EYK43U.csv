8290752,3,B000EYK43U,"This is a very curious film - although released in 1934, the story must have been written and planned before the National Socialists came to power in Germany, almost certainly conceived at the height of the initial revulsion at the Great War in the late 1920s and at the time of the emergence of revisionist historical literature, e.g. Sidney B. Fay's The Origins of The World War (1928, rev. 1930).

Clearly an anti-War film, focusing negatively on the anti-German prejudice in the US which built after the Lusitania sinking and its effects on good people, and sympathetically portraying the Germans as patriotic to their own country rather than as the Evil Hun of Allied war propaganda.

This film is thus very much a period piece.  The acting is competent enough, but despite its significance as an historical document with respect to American attitudes towards Germany and the War, it is a small film.",1340668800,2,905,4.901960784313726

Set during the Great War, it's the story of Fred von Bergen (James Bush), a first-generation German-American who returns to his homeland after losing his aviation job because of anti-Teutonic prejudice. Fred and American friend Bob Wilson (Ben Lyon) become German pilots; both men take a fancy to ambulance driver Alida Hoffman (Sari Maritza). When the U.S. enters the war in 1918, Bob's desire to remain loyal to America may get him executed as a deserter and traitor. Erich von Stroheim gives his usual competent performance here as Capt. Wolters.

Ben Lyon (Bob) also appeared in the Howard Hughes epic of WWI aviation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HELL-S-ANGELS/dp/B0002MHE1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HELL'S ANGELS</a>&nbsp;(1930).

ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage movies, serials and TV programs, many of which aren't available elsewhere. Their prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet the market scarcity of their material and an honest price make these DVDs a worthwhile purchase.
