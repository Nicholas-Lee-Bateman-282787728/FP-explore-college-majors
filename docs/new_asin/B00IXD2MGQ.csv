6302027,5,B00IXD2MGQ,"Four very good super hero movies thanks to Marvel studios (and Stan Lee!). Great price for this box set (if you can live without the bonus, ""extras"" discs).  Recommended.",1402876800,3,170,4.862068965517241
6302028,5,B00IXD2MGQ,"Great set, great picture. Very happy with set picture quality on all the discs is amazing on Blu-ray. Live the set.",1402876800,,115,4.523809523809524
6302029,5,B00IXD2MGQ,Can't wait for the new one to hit the shelves!! Going to look great on my 3D TV!!  I will watch the series for start to end!,1402444800,,124,3.5925925925925926
6302030,5,B00IXD2MGQ,This is a Blu Ray only set. It contains the movies and that's it. The HD transfer is surprisingly good.,1401926400,,103,4.2
6302031,5,B00IXD2MGQ,"The box contains the movies: X-Men, X2: X-Men United, X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: First Class each on a Blu-ray disc.
Only the movie is on the disc, the extras found in the individual movie release is not included, a major consideration if the extras are important to you.
The studio is rereleasing these movies repackaged as a set to capitalize on the new X-Men movie release.
The movies are not enhanced video, extended or a Directors cut.

If you have all these movies in Blu-ray, there is no reason for you to buy this set.
If you must have the Wolverine movies, there is another box set with them included at a higher price.
If you want the four X-Men movies on Blu-Ray this set is a very good buy at about $5 a movie.
This upgrades my DVD X-Men moves and adds the ones I did not have.
This set has what I wanted and for me it is a five-star set.",1400889600,19,856,4.1878787878787875
6302032,1,B00IXD2MGQ,i love the X-Men and want all of the movies but I don't have a HD tv so i can watch blu ray is there a regular version,1400544000,,118,3.25
6302033,3,B00IXD2MGQ,"This X-Men Quadrilogy Collection box set contains four of the X-Men movies:
1. X-Men
2. X2: X-Men United
3. X-Men: The Last Stand
4. X-Men: First Class.

Each movie is on it's own disc - but unfortunately the bonus discs which contained most of the special features are not included here (so if you like watching extras, it would be wise to purchase the individual 2-disc sets instead of this collection).

I'm not sure the point of this set, other than the studio wanting to capitalize from the coming theatrical release of ""Days of Future Past"" (and when that hits blu-ray later this year, I'm sure they'll put out yet another box set).  It's a nice deal if you do not yet own these films, but there is no need to re-buy them because this set offers nothing new (other than the nicely designed outer packaging).

NOTE: This set does not contain the two Wolverine spinoff movies.  if you want a box set containing the X-Men films plus the Wolverine films, try this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-and-the-Wolverine-Collection-X-Men-X2-X-Men-United-X-Men-The-Last-Stand-X-Men-Origins-Wolverine-X-Men-First-Class-The-Wolverine-Blu-ray/dp/B00FLML7HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men and the Wolverine Collection: X-Men / X2: X-Men United / X-Men: The Last Stand / X-Men Origins: Wolverine / X-Men: First Class / The Wolverine [Blu-ray</a>]",1400198400,62,1387,5.846534653465347
6302034,1,B00IXD2MGQ,Because a new box set will come out later this year that will include the upcoming new movie also.  I for one is still waiting on them to put out the Complete Set by season of the X-Men: Animated Series that aired on Fox.  Not that crappy animated series X-Men: Evolution.,1400112000,,272,4.313725490196078
6302035,4,B00IXD2MGQ,This is a new Box set than Fox has released having the first threenvies and first class. For most fans this might ve pointless to get. Espically If you Got the xmen and Wolverine collection released last december. It also has only the movie disc versiones of the first three xmen blu rays also. But it has the feature packed blu ray of first class despiste the cover on the Box showing the movie only blu ray artwork case. But If you have some missing from your collection and do not mind having the Wolverine movies this Would be a good buy. But I suggest going to Wal-Mart to get it. Its 19:96 there,1399680000,8,601,4.280701754385965
6302038,5,B00IXD2MGQ,I enjoy the watching the X-Men.  Great movies.  This is a nice set.,1479081600,,67,4.076923076923077

6302042,5,B00IXD2MGQ,I have no idea why I bought this.,1459468800,,33,3.25
6302043,4,B00IXD2MGQ,"I am late to the X-men game. I honestly only decided to watch them all because Deadpool is so connected to that world, and I really enjoy Deadpool. But, compared to all the other Marvel films that have happened since these, they really are quite boring. I never really liked the whole ""group"" fights anyways. Fantastic Four, Justice League, I only like the Avengers, cause all of my favorite Marvel characters show up. So, I watched them, but I feel like I could have done without...

They most definitely have a lot of star power behind them. So many talented actors and actresses involved.",1456963200,,591,4.6826923076923075

6302047,3,B00IXD2MGQ,"Love the price for the X-Men Experience Collection, but you get what you pay for... upon opening my package I noticed a rattling noise. The bottom right corner of the actual DVD case was cracked and it won't even shut all the way tight! Very upset. If you don't mind a cracked case, this is a great product. If you want a quality collector's item, this is not a product you want.",1451433600,,379,4.277777777777778

6302090,5,B00IXD2MGQ,"Though some of the special effects are outdated, these three movies are still the best in the franchise.  In fact ""X-men: First class"" is still one of my favorite movies in the superhero genre. Michael Fassbender's performance is still mesmerizing, and it is fun to see Jennifer Lawrence in this role before she became a full fledged Oscar star. Setting the movie around the Cuban Missle Crisis grounds this story in a way that many other superhero movies fail to do. The stakes are very realistic, and the audience's connection to the problem is direct. Moreover, taking the superhero genre back to the character roots is very refreshing. These heroes are people, and as such, they have human problems. That's something you don't see in the world of ""Thor"" or ""Superman"".",1426809600,4,772,4.893129770992366
6302091,5,B00IXD2MGQ,One of my favorite movie series.,1426550400,,32,4.5

6302095,1,B00IXD2MGQ,Was really excited to watch these four discs. Unfortunately none of them would play in my blu-ray player even though they are supposed to be coded for Region A/1. Had to return them. :-(,1420675200,,186,4.5

This set does not include the wolverine series.",1410307200,,115,4.8
6302114,4,B00IXD2MGQ,"Great price for 4 movies. It doesn't have extras, which is not a huge deal for me.",1409961600,,82,3.8823529411764706
6302115,5,B00IXD2MGQ,"Great price for all four Dvd's everything came wrapped brand new and right on time. Kind of a lame case but you get what you pay for and, if your not interested in special behind the scene footage or deleted scenes then this is the right collection for you it's a basic set. Another thing is the description is wrong it's not one dvd with all four movies on it, its actually four individual dvds passed that I don't think your gonna find a better price for all these movies in one box and I'm just super excited I finally have all the movies now.",1409270400,18,546,4.20952380952381

6302150,4,B00IXD2MGQ,"I picked up this set to replace the DVD versions that we have.  I then gave those out to other family members.

This is also great if you want the 4 movies, and want them all to fit in the same area as just one case.

As others have noted, no extra stuff here....but I rarely watch those anyways!",1406246400,,296,3.983050847457627

There are other X-Men box set, if this one won't have the movies you like then buy another, this one was the right for me so I took it home and I love it.",1405036800,,345,3.9285714285714284

6302157,4,B00IXD2MGQ,Well worth the cost considering each individual film would cost more. Jump into the world of the mutants and see where it takes you. Do you watch 'First Class' first or last? That is up to you to decide. (also 'First Class' or 'The Wolverine' ?? lol),1404086400,,250,4.340425531914893
