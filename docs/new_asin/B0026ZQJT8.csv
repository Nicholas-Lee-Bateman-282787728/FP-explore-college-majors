3857815,5,B0026ZQJT8,A judge harshly  condemns a murderer to death at the gallows.  Now retired in a new evidence turns up that that man was innocent of the crime. Another later has confessed.  Good pairing between Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre.,1388275200,,229,4.82051282051282
3857816,5,B0026ZQJT8,"Don Seigel directing Greenstreet and Lorre??? What more can you ask? This won't make anybody's ""top ten"" of all time but it's a well acted and directed whodunit full of plot twists and turns. Sydney Greenstreet had a very short film career but this is one of his many memorable performances that any fan should not miss.",1381708800,,320,4.631578947368421
3857817,5,B0026ZQJT8,"I'm biased, I've always loved seeing Peter Lorre in all his glory.  The Verdict is a gem of a black and white old style Hollywood movie, you won't be disappointed if you're real film buff.",1374364800,2,188,4.371428571428571
3857818,4,B0026ZQJT8,"A Victorian costume drama not very exceptional from the brothers Warner.  Greenstreet plays a Scotland Yard inspector who retired but continues to track down the murderer of a case that he cannot let go of.  Watch Joan Lorring, a new actress whose performance is worthwhile.",1362873600,,274,5.066666666666666

3857820,4,B0026ZQJT8,"This is THE VERDICT that doesn't star Paul Newman and James Mason. This is THE VERDICT that sets its tale in a foggy and gaslit Victorian London, in the year 1890. The atmosphere is appropriately noirish and even gothic, a stylish backdrop to complement the theatrical antics of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, as odd a couple as you'll ever set eyes on.

Greenstreet was an expansive man, in girth and in acting prowess. Shame it is that he waited until he was 61 before making his cinematic debut. As it were, he was featured in quite a few memorable roles, none more incandescent than his casting of the eloquent ""Kasper Gutman"" in THE MALTESE FALCON. Still, his performance in 1946's THE VERDICT as Scotland Yard's cocksure Superintendent Grodman can't be dismissed.

Except that the film opens with the puncturing of Superintendent Grodman's ego and credibility, as evidence surfaces which exonerates a man he'd just swung on the gallows. Grodman retires in abject shame, forfeiting his position to a loathed rival, the insufferable Inspector John R. Buckley who doesn't shy from crowing about his superior detecting skills. He lectures Grodman: ""There's always a clue...""

The narrative picks up some time later as the ex-Superintendent Grodman and his good friend, the macabre artist Victor Emmric (Lorre), get embroiled in a locked room murder mystery. Superintendent Buckley lands the investigation but when called upon to deliver on his sleuthing chops, he doesn't quite. There are a number of sketchy suspects to choose from, not the least of which is that same Victor Emmric, a practically decadent character who persists in lobbing amusing asides and lurking in shadows. And since Peter Lorre also plays him with his trademark twitchiness, no wonder your suspicious eyes first flicker over to him.

Don Siegel directs his first feature film, and he does it with confidence and vigor and enviable craftsmanship, demonstrating promise and potential. Ernest Haller's cinematography lends oodles of texture and mood. I don't know that the mystery itself is so engrossing or elegant, although there is a delectable swerve at the end. Mostly, the draw to this film is whenever the majestic Greenstreet and the droll (and just a bit effete) Lorre share the camera. THE VERDICT is their ninth and final movie together, and they've got their patter and their synchronicity perfected, this pair exhibiting a respective flair for dialogue. Not to mention it's always intriguing to gaze at the contrast of their physiques. See them in this one and soak in, too, the evocative Victorian setting and a well-acted tale ultimately fueled by hubris, by fatal oneupmanship.",1325030400,19,2672,5.135632183908046
3857821,5,B0026ZQJT8,"Solid Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorrie performances. You will be kept guessing untill the end of the story. The London fog, Old Scotland Yard and the how was it done murder held a secret revenge motive.",1322352000,3,205,4.722222222222222
3857822,5,B0026ZQJT8,"This is a Warner Archive product. It is a DVD-R with no extras other than a trailer and no chapter stops. You may only go forward and backwards in ten minute increments.

Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre were terrific in the films they made together, this being the best of the ones I've seen so far. Best known for their appearance together in supporting roles in The Maltese Falcon, they also did a series of films together during and immediately after World War II in which they starred, since many of the Warner Brothers A list stars were serving in the military.

The year is 1890. Greenstreet plays the superintendent of police of Scotland Yard, George Edward Grodman, who has just been to the execution of a man he arrested for the crime of murdering an elderly woman. He arrives back at his office to discover that the man is in fact innocent, as the clergyman that the man claimed as an alibi has finally surfaced. Disgraced, he is forced to resign in favor of his subordinate, John Buckley (George Coulouris).

Grodman is a man of means, so the loss of a paycheck doesn't seem to be a problem, but his nightmares about sending an innocent man to the gallows are. He seems to be recovering, and even making plans for writing a book about his past cases, when a neighbor from across the street is murdered. The crime seems to be a perfect one - the murderer apparently killed the man from inside his own locked room and escaped without detection or leaving any clues behind. However, the brash and boorish new superintendent Buckley will not accept that, and continues seeking a suspect, although in the manner of a bull in a china shoppe. In the meantime, there are a multitude of suspects that intersect with a multitude of witnesses, and Grodman along with the help of his friend, illustrator Victor Emmric (Peter Lorre) decide to do some investigating themselves on their own time.

Greenstreet and Lorre are terrific together as always, with a timing and chemistry that makes them great at these kinds of films. You never know if the likable exteriors displayed by each is the truth or a lie in either or both cases, usually up to the end. This one will keep you guessing right up to the final scene, and I highly recommend it.

The video and audio quality on this film are very good. It's too bad it wasn't put on a pressed DVD with commentary so deserving of such an artfully done film. The only negative thing I can say about the product itself is that it says it contains a trailer. When I play what is supposed to be the trailer, what I in fact get are the first few minutes of the film itself. Such is typical of the worst thing about the Warner Archive products so far - the extremely variable quality and outright mistakes made during the manufacturing of the individual discs themselves.",1260662400,54,2811,4.558415841584158
3857823,5,B0026ZQJT8,In my top 100 favorite films collection. Amazing Haller cinematography - Greenstreet as a Scotland Yard detective - Peter Lorre and a good mystery- should be released remastered on dvd with extras such as commentaries- a rare gem- not personally familiar with the dvd-r quality but the film itself is great!,1255046400,20,307,5.03921568627451
3857824,5,B0026ZQJT8,Murder in Victorian London; Scotland yard investigates in the dark night amidst the foggy streets. Greenstreet and Lorre are in their absolute top form. One of the best mystery films ever made.,1431216000,,193,5.0625
3857825,5,B0026ZQJT8,"Another wonderful Greenstreet/Lorre collaboration that has a great ending.  Decent picture and sound but once again a WB DVDR only,  at a DVD price.",1428364800,,148,5.125
3857826,5,B0026ZQJT8,"I'm not sure what one would rate in a DVD or CD. The packaging is as convenient as any other. The reason for the five stars is simply for the movie itself; I just had to do it, as I think this movie is truly the best 'mystery' movie ever made.",1426982400,4,243,3.784313725490196
3857827,4,B0026ZQJT8,"A fine Gothic mystery that features the famed Shakespearian actor Sydney Greenstreet teamed with his friend Peter Lorre to solve a locked room murder mystery.  Greenstreet, who only made 23 movies and 9 of them with Lorre, plays a Scotland yard police chief who loses his job in disgrace at the opening of the film for convicting and hanging a innocent man in the 1890's.  He's replacement was quick to get him removed and take his place.  Greenstreet is biding his time when a mysterious murder happens across the street from him and in the apartment building of his friend Peter Lorre.  The two then work to solve the crime, at least as hard as the hard partying artist Lorre is available to.  Well done little mystery and well acted.  Well worth a watch for fans of old time mysteries and fans of older films.  Greenstreet made his film debut in The Maltese Falcon and he turned in such a fine performance that many thought the stage actor had been acting in films for years.  He thought making films was harder than stage work because the lens was so unforgiving.",1426377600,,1067,4.578947368421052
3857828,4,B0026ZQJT8,Enjoyed this one quite a bit even though I figured it out fairly early on.  But I love the Greenstreet/Lorre combo and will definitely watch this again.,1419984000,,152,4.62962962962963

3857832,4,B0026ZQJT8,I like some old thrillers and this one is just simple great with the performance of Charles Laughton....,1408147200,,104,4.833333333333333
3857833,4,B0026ZQJT8,"THE VERDICT (1946) is an engaging murder mystery movie starring Peter Lorre as a somewhat creepy artist and Sidney Greenstreet as his close friend, a brilliant police detective. Greenstreet, in the opening minutes, is forced to resign because evidence he gathered led to the conviction and execution of an innocent man. Greenstreet's replacement as chief detective (George Coulouris), a nasty subordinate who had been bucking for his job for years, gloats that HE will never make such an error.

The very next morning, a wealthy young gentleman is found murdered in his bed in his apartment whose windows are all latched and whose only door was locked and bolted from  the inside. Is the same killer to blame? Can the new chief detective solve this puzzle? Or will he, too, make a major mistake, perhaps causing the unjust conviction and sentencing of another innocent person?

Sufficient clues to the mystery's solution ARE there for viewers to spot, but this Fair-Play Puzzle is NOT an easy one to solve.

In my own case, sadly, I could not play the game. I knew within the first 7 or 8 minutes where THE VERDICT was going, not because I'm any sort of great detective, but because I began noticing dozens of resemblances between this film and an 1891 detective novel I'd read 14 years ago -- THE BIG BOW MYSTERY by the little known author Israel Zangwill.

At least 85 percent of this movie's general plot and 100 percent of its ""locked-room mystery"" plot are based on this late Victorian mystery novel. And by the way, I very highly recommend this nearly forgotten novel, which is excellent in its humor and its human psychology, as well as in its very skillful puzzle construction.",1403827200,,1685,4.796551724137931
8353827,5,B0026ZQJT8,"Early Don Siegel movie w Brit seasoning.  Another pairing of Greenstreet and Lorre.  An English drawing room mystery, representative of the period but very well written and will appeal even to contempo audiences.  Surprising storyline twists in store.  Sophisticated ""upper class"" dialogue keeps things rolling but in my view it never got tedious or boring.  Hard to find movie, not readily available on streaming services, etc.  I had to buy the dvd but it was worth it.",1503100800,,471,5.0519480519480515
8353828,4,B0026ZQJT8,"Wonderful crime drama.  I had videotaped The Verdict, along with Three Strangers and The Mask of Dimitrios some years back when all three movies aired back-to-back on Turner Classic Movies. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet complemented each others acting. Highly recommended.",1497916800,,277,5.7560975609756095

8353831,5,B0026ZQJT8,This has always been a favourite of mine.  The recording is of a high quality.  Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre are always a delight on screen.  The story here is very well crafted.  At the core of the story is a locked-room murder mystery.  The title may lead you to think that it is a courtroom drama; it is not.  The cinematography is excellent as well.,1463616000,,359,4.363636363636363

8353836,5,B0026ZQJT8,"PLOT: locked door mystery has even the police baffled.

""EX-superintendent Gradman"" (SYDNEY GREENSTREET) was ousted from his job when the WRONG man was hanged. He spends his day writing his memoires of ""cases he solved."" When a ""locked door"" killing occurs in the house across the street he is drug into a new investigation. Suspects include a lovesick landlady, likeable drunkard artist (PETER LORRE), a Member of Parliament with a bad alibi and lady of the night who sings .... Set in 1890 England complete with fog. The DEAD man has few mourners and plenty who wanted the job done. A ""watch fob""....is a clue and ends up having the body exhumed. LORRE steals the show here as an overly curious observer who loves his booze. LOL....and a nifty  twist ending. Excellent cinematography.",1437177600,,786,4.902255639097745
