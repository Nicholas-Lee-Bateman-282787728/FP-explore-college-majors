7234833,2,B00YS4V5BC,"At the age of twenty-nine, Adaline Bowman suffered a bizarre car accident, where she plunged into a frozen river and was struck by lightning. In the decades since the accident, she has not aged a day.

It's an intriguing premise for a magical-realism romance, especially if one considered the vast, sweeping changes that have happened over the last century. Unfortunately, ""The Age of Adaline"" never achieves more depth than a pretty but shallow picture -- it drapes the most twee of old-fashioned trappings around a modern plot, surrounding a blandly pleasant Mary Sue heroine and a vaguely inspirational message about how you should live your life or something like that.

After the FBI took an interest in Adaline's lack of aging, she started adopting a new identity every decade or so, so no one will notice her lack of aging. The only one who knows her secret is her daughter Flemming (Ellen Burstyn), who now could pass for her mother's grandmother. Though independently wealthy from early investments in Xerox, her latest identity is a librarian named Jennifer, but she's planning to trade in that persona and retire to a remote farm in Oregon.

But her plans are derailed on New Year's Eve when she encounters Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a wealthy young man who relentlessly pursues Adaline until she agrees to date him. She finds herself falling in love with him despite her determination to stay emotionally unattached -- but when she accompanies him on a visit to his family, his father (Harrison Ford) recognizes her from a long-ago relationship. Now Adaline must make a fateful choice: keep running away, or finally embrace life and love?

""The Age of Adaline"" is presented as if it were a sort of modern American epic mingled with cosmic magical-realism... but sadly it doesn't really have the backbone or the cojones to really be what it aspires to be. Instead, it's a picturesquely soppy romance that lingers lovingly on many pretty tableaus -- antique cars roaming over grassy hills, glimmering rain and stars, elegant parties, lushly green North California forests and as many shots of the Golden Gate Bridge as a rack of tourist postcards.

So it only dips lightly into the problems Adaline would be expected to have -- mainly bumping into old flames and a five-second-long encounter with Sinister Government Forces. And though the selling point of any story about an immortal is the weight of time's passage, there's no real sense of Adaline having done much than attend a few parties and have a few romances. We're supposed to see her as a woman weighed down by her long artificial life and the isolation it brings, but it feels like she hasn't gained any baggage except her elegant wardrobe.

And it has a message that is just as bland and twee: you should be courageous enough to love and live.... instead of the alternative, apparently. Despite dipping lightly into some of the problems you would expect Adaline to have -- such as the FBI wanting to find the cause of her immortality -- the movie quickly darts away from anything that isn't prettily romantic, narrated archly by an omniscience narrator who describes everything significant down to the molecular level. It desperately wants the epic sweep and tragedy of an immortal's life... but it also wants to be a safe, cozy little romance.

And of course, ""living"" and ""loving"" are entirely expressed through a rather trite, blindingly sentimental romance, which is only memorable because Ellis is kind of creepy. Seriously, he stalks Adaline and uses her job as a means of extorting dates from her, yet this behavior is presented as if he's merely charmingly earnest and a little awkward.

Blake Lively does a serviceable job as Adaline, and you sense that she's throwing herself into the role with all she has. However, she doesn't have the luminous charm, the gravitas, or the sense of age that Adaline is supposed to have. In fact, Adaline herself is a rather blandly perfect figure -- she lives a glamorous life while also being a librarian, independently wealthy, speaks many languages, met various twentieth-century celebrities, and every man who sees her instantly falls in love with her her and obsesses on her for years. She's well-read, wise, witty, beautiful and generally perfect in every way. She's like a romantic bookish teenager's Mary Sue.

But the actors are to be commended for doing a pretty good job all around -- Ford has a brief but wrenching role as a former paramour of Adaline's, who has been haunted by her for all these years. It's probably the best performance he's given in years. Burstyn is quite good as Adaline's elderly daughter, and Huisman does what he can with a rather flat romantic figure.

""The Age of Adaline"" strives to be something grand and wrenching, but falls back into a safe little nest of cliches and pretty scenery. Not so much a bad movie as a profoundly forgettable one, despite its intriguing premise.",1435622400,4,4937,4.901796407185628

7234835,3,B00YS4V5BC,A woman has an accident and stops aging. Afraid that she will be figured out she hides out. One day she encounters an old love and the chips hit the fan. Feels like an episode of 'The Twilight Zone'. Much of the plot has to be explained to the viewer as it is so complicated.,1434844800,,275,4.0181818181818185
7234836,4,B00YS4V5BC,"""The Age of Adaline"" (2015 release; 112 min.) brings the story of Adaline Bowman (played by Blake Lively). As the movie opens, we are told it is ""San Francisco, December 31, 2014"" and we see Adaline buying several falsified passports and ID documents. It isn't long before the movie flashes back in time and the voice-over explains that Adaline was born on January 1, 1908, but as the result of a freak accident in 1937, Adaline's body has stopped aging. Later on that New Year's Eve, Adaline meets Ellis Jones (played by Michiel Huisman), an impossibly nice (and rich) philanthropist. Along the way, we also get to know Adaline's daughter, who is now an old lady (played by Ellen Burstyn), who is the only person in the world who knows Adalin's secret. Or is she? And what will become of the spark between Adaline and Ellis? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a rom-com with a sci-fi twist, namely the 29 yr. old woman who does not age. I loved the opening 15-20 min. of the movie, where we see in flashbacks over the years how Adaline lived through the 30s, 40s, and subsequent decades (that entire sequence reminded me a bit of Woody Allen's ""Zelig"", where Woody shows up in all kinds of famous scenes of history). The 'freak accident' that causes Adaline to stop aging is something you have to simply take at face value and accept, otherwise there is no point in watching. Unfortunately, after that, the movie becomes a fairly straight forward rom-com and, pleasant as it is, to me it feels like a bit of a lost opportunity. Yes, there are some hints as to the utter loneliness of Adaline (she has no friends to speak of), and yes, there are a couple of interesting scenes between 29 yr. old Adaline and her very old daughter, but the movie does not pursue these psychological angles deep enough for me. By the time the Big Twist comes deep into the movie (no worries, I won't spoil), it made things only worse for me as it seemed completely implausible, just like the 'freak accident' but this time I couldn't get over it. Still, I rate the movie 3.5 stars for several reasons: the lead performances are all good (besides Lively and Huisman, the latter being his first lead role in a US film, there is also Harrison Ford, as Ellis' dad); the movie's photography is tops--check out the visual eye-candy that is the San Francisco city scenery); and I really enjoyed the orchestral score, composed by Rob Simonsen). In the end, the movie flashed by in seemingly no time.

This movie has done rather well at the US box office, a bit to my surprise since this has gotten virtually no marketing support. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati last month was not well attended (and I'm being mild), but then again I saw it on a week night. If you are in the mood for a pleasant, if non-challenging, rom-com with a sci-fi twist, this movie should satisfy you. If you have the opportunity to check out ""The Age of Adaline"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I'd encourage you to do so and draw your own conclusions.",1434672000,86,3196,4.546875
7234837,5,B00YS4V5BC,"At 12:01 am on January eighth, 'nineteen hundred and eight', Adaline Marie Bowman (Blake Lively) was born in San Francisco, CA. She was a beautiful young girl who grew up, fell in love and married. She then had a daughter, Flemming (later portrayed by Ellen Burstyn). In a horrific accident during the building of the Golden Gate Bridge she lost her husband very early in her marriage and was left to raise their daughter alone. On a reality changing dark night, Adaline was driving her car to get to her daughter when something transpired which can only be detailed by the narrator (Hugh Ross) to understand how it all took place. He describes the science of it all as it occurs in ""threefold"" and takes on an almost other-worldly approach while happening during the first snowfall in Sonoma county. This happened quickly at the outset of the film and does explain all that is to follow which is completely necessary to Adaline's story. I took the developments at face-value to answer the many questions occurring after this phenomenal event, but for some, suspending your disbelief will aid in your enjoyment of ""The Age of Adaline"".

After going through this, Adaline does not age any longer and remains stuck at her twenty-nine years. She is suspended in time and does not move forward. Flemming ages appropriately while she keeps her mother's secret all of these decades. Adaline is now living in the present day under another alias which she has just assumed, Jennifer Larson (Jenny) and continues working in isolating jobs. She rarely goes out for fear of being discovered; an endless life or is it? If one will not age in this setting, will eternal youth hold any advantage in a life of seclusion? After being coaxed out of her apartment to join a friend at a New Year's Eve party, she meets a man in the elevator, Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman) who is a wealthy philanthropist from a well-to-do family. It is obvious that he has adored her from afar as he keeps trying to scoop Adaline into a relationship while she tries to protest. She is so used to keeping to herself that she is afraid and would rather be solitary as only Flemming could completely understand her dilemma. She becomes confused with her feelings for Ellis and how she might handle a romantic relationship if it were to progress into one. She has such a working knowledge of past happenings while exclaiming to Ellis, ""I'll never understand why too few people care about history"". It becomes more amazing to realize just what Adaline recalls as she has already experienced it.

I found Adaline in this extremely original storyline very compelling and wouldn't want to keep describing it as this is much better for you to discover. I am not usually too interested in a story that includes some semi-science fiction although this one was a pleasant surprise. Adaline's story is intriguing and she is enchanting in it. I must mention the supporting cast with Kathy Baker as Kathy, Ellis' mother, and especially Harrison Ford as William, his father who serve to uplift the story and add necessary tension to places of urgency within the story. From an original story and screenplay by J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz then directed by Lee Toland Krieger comes this story of the cost of never growing old with the feelings and emotions surrounding how one would live within this state of eternal youth while the world continues on around her. It does present a quizzical theory overall and at points had me guessing how Adaline would be doing at twenty-nine during the generations she was living in. The cinematography (David Lanzenberg) shows off well-done sets representing San Francisco. The costumes for the cast kept up delightfully with the changing trends of the day, makeup to hairdos. Also the cars, lifestyles and the visuals of a historical past - especially concerning the happenings with the Golden Gate Bridge on film reels of Adaline's significant era added to the interesting features. These are shown in the first thirty minutes which is a most important time of the film. For me, this heartfelt and picturesque story concerning Adaline was a definite don't miss film.",1434585600,435,4164,4.855133614627285
7234838,5,B00YS4V5BC,"I saw this today.  I kind of had an idea what it was about.  I guess it is about a few things.

First, something happens to a lady.  This thing stops her from getting older.  Those she loves and is friends with all get old and die, while she stays the same.

They explain what happens and I kind of think that was the worst part of the movie.  At a few points, you hear a man talking.  Telling you about things that happen and what these things cause.  I know why they did it.  But, some things you just cannot explain.  Nonetheless, this did not take anything away from the movie.

You see the lady through time sin her life.  Then it gets to the current time.  You learn about her from flashbacks.  You quickly get to know her.  You learn of the way she continues to live, and not let anyone know what she can do.

Then, she meets a man.  She is at a party and she looks at him and seems to loose everything but the site of him.  He looks at her the same way.  Eventually, she talks to the man.  As good as things seem, she cannot fall in love with the man.  To do so would be to change the way she has lived and risk anyone finding out about her strange ability.

She goes with the man one day.  Things that happen during this time change her.  It was amazing.  I was so brawn to the movie at that point.  I do not want to give anything away.  But, you cannot choose fate.  It has a way of working out.  She has to make a choice.  Live her life running, or just tell people what she can do and allow herself to fall in love.  Then, once that choice is made, if it ever is, fate has a way of finding out and brining her life to a somewhat normal state, for the first time in a long, long time.

This was a great movie, one that I will buy and look forward to watching.  Also, it was cool to see Harrison Ford.",1434499200,7,1811,3.925207756232687

7234890,3,B00YS4V5BC,"I had never seen a movie with 25,000 nearly positive reviews before, so, of course, I had to buy it, thinking it was going to be SOME movie.  Turns out it was as ordinary as can be.  Similar to many age reversal themes - she can't die, she outlives everyone, (spoiler: ) she finally finds a way to die.  It was all right, but not the amazing story 25,000 reviews lead you to believe it was.  Hopes too high; therefore, major letdown.  If you don't go by the amount of reviews, you may find it interesting.",1530144000,,505,4.21875
7234891,4,B00YS4V5BC,"I loved the theme of this movie and enjoyed most of the performances, but there were just a few things that kept it from being 5 stars for me.

SPOILER ALERT!!!

-- Blake Lively is a beautiful woman, but she's too wooden in this performance. When you watch the other actors, she's so outclassed. Harrison Ford and Kathy Bates acted better with just their eyes than BL did in the entire movie. It's not that she was bad, she just wasn't good.

-- A rich, good-looking guy is so enamored with Jenny that he ignores all of her rudeness, etc? Uh, no.

-- The creepy factor of knowing that Jenny had slept with the father of her current love just had a stomach-churning factor of 100%. When lover boy is finally told her secret, how does she keep that from him? Is everyone expected to pretend it never happened? Of course, it's possible, but...

-- The big twist at the end was so obvious that it was no surprise at all. Even the comet tie-in was predictable, BUT it was still a logical ending.

Watch this movie as a two hour escape from reality and you'll enjoy it. Just don't examine it too closely.",1529971200,,1098,4.357843137254902

7235060,4,B00YS4V5BC,"A very interesting concept done well. How bizarre to watch everyone you know, including your children, grow old and die while you stay the same age. Over and over again. The premise is highlighted as Adeline grows weary of her situation through her pets over the centuries, hundreds of pets that she has to lose, again and again. An allegory of her existence. Beautifully filmed and acted and thoroughly thought provoking. Recommended.",1514937600,,435,5.055555555555555
7235061,4,B00YS4V5BC,"The easy way to see Blake Lively is a teen star who married well and became the breakout star amongst her ""Gossip Girl"" cast.

""The Age of Adaline"" kicks the dust out of that easy way to see her. Combined with her lead role in ""The Shallows,"" these features make it clear that Lively has a great career ahead of her, if she can convince more directors to give her a shot. This is as gorgeous a romance film as anyone has seen in 2010s, a film in a dying genre of epic romances, and her presence helps to make it as magical as you hope it will be.

The premis isn't very believeable - a lightning strike prevents Adaline from aging normally for nearly 100 years - but if you can buy it, the rest of the film plays out with sensitivity and beauty. Women will probably gag at the idea that staying forever beautiful can be a hassle, but a hassle it is for Adaline, who must become an expert at forging fake identities and hiding from prying eyes, while denying anyone attempting to know her, for fear that she will have to abandon them later, just to survive. When romances begin to overtake her mission to go further into hiding, Adaline allows herself to feel emotions long forgotten, and Lively's performance is luminous throughtout.

If you like an epic romance, beautiful people, fantastic acting, and watching a star asending to a new level, ""The Age of Adaline"" is for you.",1514851200,6,1377,4.434782608695652

7235074,1,B00YS4V5BC,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I'm very confused about why feminists were passionately recommending this one to my wife for so long. It's filled with the deeply troubling man-as-romantic-hunter trope that is antithetical to modern feminist thought. The romantic leads grow closer only through a series of invasive gestures performed by the male lead, including blackmail and stalking. The female lead's boundaries are continuously ignored, and it seems clear that there is no attention paid to her autonomy as a human being. Instead she is expected to go through the same, tired motions required by the textbook romantic arc.

What I've mentioned above is not what earns this movie 0/5 stars, however. It's how cripplingly boring it is. It's a slog to get through, the characters uninteresting - particularly the female lead, who is predominantly reactive. The physical chemistry is mediocre, the romance contrived, the immortality gimmick unnecessary and poorly utilized. The drama is tawdry. It doesn't matter how many times the elements stop the main character's heart if you can neither surprise me with your script nor delight me with your execution.

This is garbage.",1512777600,,1192,5.203125

Michael Huisman is equally charming and fun to watch (Daario Naharis for those GoT fans). Unfortunately, the storyline is nothing new and as soon as the voice narration -accompanied by the familiar fairytale music- began, I felt like I had already seen this movie. Though the pace is slow and scenes are predictable, the little surprises kept the movie interesting. Ellen Burstyn as the daughter for example. Just when I was about to give-up on this movie, Harrison Ford appeared and saved it for me! He and Kathy Baker. I agree with one of the other reviews that his performance in this movie is one of his best. The birthday speech is very moving. The whole dynamic of the film changed when Harrison filled the screen. He just has such a commanding presence and dynamic quality that out-shined the other actors. It was like a completely different movie with Harrison.

The Blu-Ray video quality was a huge disappointment.  I've seen this film several times on streaming video (Netflix or Amazon Prime) and the clarity was much better than the Blu-Ray version.

Because old Harrison Ford hadn't entered the pictured yet.

It started as your average very nice 4 or 5 star mysterious romantic drama. Good acting, a little too simple a little too cheese, but very well done regardless.

And first hour and a half I enjoyed movie.
But.. last 30 minutes it was the worst possible combination of cliches especially cliches about aging! Ughhh.... I want to give this 1 star just because of how horribly banal they made the ending but that wouldn't be exactly fair, there's quality after all.

But the idea of that movie.... and cliche drives chiche.... UGHHH GOD! So, so bad... I haven't cringe that much even at far worse movies..

If you are looking for romance you are sure to be disappointed by the lack of chemistry between Blake Lively's character and the primary love interest. There is nothing great or provoking about their relationship, if anything it comes across silly like the whirlwind romances of a children's movie where you find yourself saying ""Wait what? Since when are they in love, they've known each other like 3 days!"" From a science fiction stand point the movie is truly truly disappointing. A dull voice actor prattles on for the first 20 minutes of the film describing the utterly rubbish reason why she doesn't age. I would have been more satisfied if she was literally under a magical spell than I was with the underdeveloped ""scientific"" explanation they gave. Not to mention Adaline has only lived 107 years but is posed as being immensely wise and knowledgeable as someone who had lived many lifetimes might be. Most if not all of the characters feel unimportant and consequently just about every scene in the movie feel irrelevant as the plot is never really defined. Only thing that made this film watchable was Harrison Ford's performance.

7235496,4,B00YS4V5BC,"I did not have high expectations for this movie, and it started off as a solid 3 star.  Blake is good and credible - but not amazing.  The love interest is aptly played by the lead actor - fairly standard romantic movie stuff, with a time bending twist.  And then, half way through, Harrison Ford and Kathy B show up, and all of a sudden the movie is jolted to life.  Ford is amazing, and you can see that just his performance makes the rest of the cast up their game.  The result is a surprisingly satisfying and enjoyable movie, better than expected.",1497744000,,552,4.320388349514563

Very late on watching it but once i saw that it was on amazon prime i had to and not regret a single moment of it. The movie was shot in the absolute most beautiful of scenery and blake livelys performance in it was exquisite. She spoke wisely and her voice spoke so of a 107 year old woman. The ending was not of expected. My prediction was completely different. This movie was not corny at all and spoke with intelligence. Also brought a tear to the eye but did not cause a horrible emotional heart break either. 10/10 would recommend,1496793600,3,609,4.304347826086956

7235541,5,B00YS4V5BC,This was perhaps the best version of this story I have seen. The premise is nothing new and even the surprise events are something we've seen a dozen times before in movies of the same style. But the performances and narration make this worth watching.

It's nostalgic, quirky, fun, romantic, and if you love historical trivia, then this movie is the whole enchilada for you! I had never heard of Blake Lively, but then I don't keep up with the ever growing influx of young actors. However, she really impressed me, and I'll be on the lookout for her future films.

7235585,2,B00YS4V5BC,I didn't care for this film. I watched it because it had a four & a half star rating. Now I know to not pay attention to the rating.,1495238400,,132,3.586206896551724
7235586,5,B00YS4V5BC,"So says Adaline to a young man who has no idea who he is talking to.  Adaline knows.  She has lived the majority of her days trying to blend in to her surroundings and never getting too close to anyone (except her dogs) for fear they will find out her secret, one which almost took her away from her daughter.  But her curiosity for people, history, and things of beauty and meaning attract people to her.  She comes from another place and time, speaking, dressing, and acting accordingly.
The music was ethereal but subdued from start to finish and the narrator allowed this complex background to be weaved together with the present. And although we get brief glimpses of earlier eras, beautifully detailed and wonderfully integrated, I almost felt cheated because there were many potential story lines that could have been explored, so much so that it could have been a mini series, but that would have taken away the magic.

The acting was stellar with perfect casting of all involved.  Seeing the notations about other actors who had originally been considered for the movie, I just can't imagine it.  I loved the relationship Ellen Burstyn and Blake Lively created between Flemming and Adaline, and each of the other actors -  Harrison Ford, Kathy Baker, Michiel Huisman, and Amanda Crew, as well as the rest of the supporting cast played their roles wonderfully.  You believed they were a family during the Trivial Pursuit scene.

Obviously I loved this film, this love story, but I will also keep an eye on the writers J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz, and the young director Lee Toland Krieger who has the kind of skill for telling a story that cannot be learned.  I hope some time he does a period piece as I agree with Adaline:  ""I don't think I'll ever understand why so few people care about history.""

As an aside to the history comment, if you are lucky enough that your grandparents are still alive look at the pictures they have on display and ask them about the times they grew up in.  Really listen to what they tell you, and record it.  The things they experienced are our history, but it was their life and they have much to teach us.  When they are gone, so is that chance.  Do it today!

and if nothing else, enjoy the movie!",1495238400,5,2254,4.606516290726817

7235608,5,B00YS4V5BC,Amazing absolutely amazing. A little creepy she loved both father and son. Astounded by the small note of showing her wanting to learn braille. The poise she held from being born when shivery and women showcasing a soft demeanor carried on throughout time with her.

7235609,5,B00YS4V5BC,"Movies like these are rare for me to find. I often find them by randomly flipping through channels, searching through discounted movie racks, and looking for something different on Amazon. I remembered watching the previews for this maybe a year or two ago and I always found it fascinating, but I never got a chance to go to the movies and see it. I've only had this sort of catharsis with books of the same subjects where my mental movie went as quickly as my eyes could skim the words. I found this view on love and nostalgia, although highly romanticized as all movies are, was relieving. I personally could not fit in Jenny's (Adaline's) shoes as culturally our experiences would be different. However, her search for love is inspiring and gives me hope in this hole I find myself in.

7235614,5,B00YS4V5BC,"Amazingly absent of corny over-the-top fantasy (they actually did strive with realism and projected what they couldn't into a future discovery) and instead correctly sprinkled the main character with nuances of the generational norms and preferences in cultural taste true to the supposed age of someone who suddenly lived on as a 29 yr old ""forever young"" character from 1937 onward.  Most enjoyable were the tidbits in costuming such as the scene where the jewelry is a locket necklace and hints of clothing taste leaning to when this woman would have been in her prime mid-years.  Fully agree with others that the narration was done at the right time and places in this film. Supporting cast was akin to being spoon-fed dessert all the way through.  My main criticism would be: was left thinking the whole 'men in black' FBI thing was not coherently explained in a scene leading up to the attempted abduction, and yet it was the main reason she lead her life in eventual flight or fight response mode.",1494633600,6,1004,4.825581395348837

This would not have been a big deal if the movie had not made such an effort filled attempt to make its audience believe what was happening was plausible.

Now if unlike me you are able to break out of your scientific mind then you will be met with a movie that is cliche and over all uninspiring. From classic lines straight up copy and pasted from well known love stories such as Casablanca. To poorly over saturated shots that could be awe inspiring if they had simply toned down their coloring department.

SPOILER:
Adaline's interaction with the father while intriguing and cute at first quickly morphed and reared its head as gross for me. I felt this was the moment I truly disconnected from the movie completely and had no desire to finish but for the mere realization that the run time left was only 15 minutes.

7235673,4,B00YS4V5BC,"""The Age of Adaline"" is a romantic drama starring a winsome Blake Lively as Adaline Bowman who is a who is a demure, intelligent but emotionally closed off woman due to having had an incredible near-death accident that ended up unnaturally prolonging her life so that she wouldn't age.  This drama is bathed in a pervasive sense of sadness but is not weepy, and Adaline's character is never put upon but is reasoned and assured, and careful.  She does not want to fall in love again because she knows that in time she will lose her love and her secret which she has been so careful to protect against all save her daughter Flemming (played by Ellen Burstyn, and those scenes are hard to get ahold of as our senses don't want to allow the young woman--Adaline--who is relating to the grandmotherly woman--Flemming--to be that of the mother relating to the daughter, it messes with the mind).

Adaline when she was still young had given up on a romance, a true love that still haunts her.  In the present day she meets an exceptional young man, Ellis, and despite her best efforts falls for him and allows herself to begin a relationship with him at her daughter's urging.  Knowing what this will eventually entail she goes ahead anyway and when she finally meets his family she meets someone whom she never expected to see again!  As her past comes back to haunt her she has to decide whether or not she will embrace and live a life that is alternately blessed/ cursed or if she'll retreat to the safety of her carefully cloistered relationships.  The acting, pacing, and pathos of the film is pretty spot-on and while the movie doesn't reach beyond being a satisfying romantic drama with a sci-fi twist that's okay because it hits its mark.",1492214400,,1740,4.62987012987013

Or better yet: HIRE MORE WOMEN WRITERS & DIRECTORS. And honestly, if she's been in hiding for 50-odd years, ya don't think she'd be a better actor? The confrontation scene w/ H.

7235703,4,B00YS4V5BC,"[Spoilers] I didn't find this film to be very enlightening or thought provoking. Basically, the dramatic tension revolves around the fact that Adaline doesn't age so she can't form meaningful relationships because the inevitable death of her loved ones was too painful for her. Of course the ending of any good relationship would be painful. But the film courses through decades in minutes, making the false impression that relationships are more about the inevitable end than the many quality years they can enjoy before the end. The reality is, chances are, everything in this universe has an end, including any living being, our civilization, the earth, the solar system, the milky way, and even the universe itself. No matter how long anybody lasts compared to others, s/he will die. Not aging only changes your life expectancy from about 80 years to a poisson distribution and nothing more.

On a positive note, the acting was superb and Blake Lively is still gorgeous as ever. Worth seeing if you just wanted some chick flick to relax to.",1491609600,,1044,4.965714285714285

Stuck at the age of 29, she never ages, never grows grey hair or wrinkles, maintains youthful energy. Minor characters in the movie even comment how she could pass for even younger than 29, but she remains honest and insists she is 29, the the age at which her freak accident occurs.

Yet Adaline experiences immortality as a curse, and lives a life of quiet fear and dread of ever being found out. The only one who knows her secret is her daughter, who ages beyond her mother and cannot even maintain a healthy close relationship with her because of Adaline's condition.

Lively plays an excellent role in this movie, and portrays a maturity that reflects her advanced years in a young woman's body.",1491350400,,809,4.855072463768116

It does not explore all the ramifications of immortality, except the inevitable loss when Adaline is forced to change locations or situations because people begin to become suspicious because she is not aging. WARNING: SPOILERS. The most poignant loss was actually the death of her dog, emphasized as she looks through the photo album of all the previous dogs she has had. The hope for the future is exemplified by her new puppy. Blake Lively does a good job in this film, far better than Katherine Heigl would have done (apparently she was originally considered for this part). The ending was a little cliche but that's okay, it is in keeping with the rest of the movie.

7235768,2,B00YS4V5BC,"What a waisted opportunity for such an interesting sci fi concept! Great science fiction helps us understand more about our own life by presenting us with seemingly unfamiliar characters and stories that turn out to be surprisingly human. There is a lot to explore when considering the possibility of immortal life. One may wonder what a hundred year old person would think about and how they would treat others and the world around them. The biggest questions would revolve around those issues most humans hold dear, such as finding life's meaning, and in the case of a romance movie, what is love and how does one love if there is no end to your life's story?

This movie missed these chances to thoughtfully explore such fascinating ideas.

The main character was too weak to carry the mantel of a 100+ year old human. She was portrayed as knowing trivia and being highly attentive, but did not have the gravity or substance in her personality, or way of thinking to be believable as having that much life experience. I was rooting for her at the beginning, but her actions surrounding the romantic portion of the story were like any old teenage love story. I get the whole love makes anyone act naive or irrational, but this story was so bad it took it to another level - totally breaking the believability of her character.

The romance was not that good either. Ellis comes across as overly pushy and crosses the line of hopeful suitor to creepy guy who doesn't respect boundaries. I understand Hollywood likes to portray the pursuing male trope, but he is so overt that it also weakens his character. I found myself being happy when the main character initially rejects him. I did not find him worthy of a hundred year old person's love. I would have expected a lot more depth. But then again, when they water down Adeline's character as the story progresses, I can see why they end up together - but for the wrong reasons.

As the magic of the initial concept wears off, the story becomes bizarre as you find it hard to believe the writers are really asking you to buy into what is happening. Ellis's dad's storyline was also promising, but also falls flat due to the weakness of Adeline's character. I couldn't believe Ellis's dad could be that smitten with someone like Adeline. She had no magic in her character by that point in the story. Then we are asked to put up with the idea that Adeline slept with both Ellis and his dad and now the whole family is going to have to live with this truth - like some just strange dark family secret.

Please don't watch this, it is painful if you like good storytelling and high ambitions in the movies you watch.",1490400000,,2664,4.576519916142558

7235893,1,B00YS4V5BC,"Suspension of utter belief. Trying to pull emotional strings to string together a totally unbelievable story, e.g. if she really was suspended at around 30, why only one daughter? Just because the reality of someone in their 30's having more children would have made the story too complicated. Besides medical facts were not believable. Also, if you are not aging, does not mean you are immune to death: probably more likely to get killed in an accident or have some disease etc.",1487894400,,479,4.853658536585366

7235914,5,B00YS4V5BC,"Lee Toland Krieger did a great job directing The Age of Adaline.  It has a unique, original story that shows the life of a girl constantly on the move to prevent the authorities from turning her into a study specimen.  The idea of 29-year-old Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) having an accident that stops her from aging may seem unrealistic, but this film makes it work.  With the voice of Hugh Ross narrating, the science behind Adalines agelessness is explained in a well thought out way that goes well with the gentle tone of the film.  Adalines heart stopped while she was under water, and a lightning bolt hit her car and revived her just as defibrillation would do.  The reasons for her agelessness will not be discovered until the year 2035, which gives you reason to believe it.
 On New Years eve Adaline meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), who is on a mission to get a date with her.  This part of the film is just the average, predictable romance story you would expect, but it is worth the watch because when Ellis takes Adaline to his parents house the film transforms.  Elliss father, William Jones (Harrison Ford), recognizes Adaline from his past.  Her secret is not safe anymore.  William realized Adaline was the girl he had planned on proposing to, and helped her decide to finally stop running away just as her daughter (Ellen Burstyn) had been telling her to do.
Harrison Fords performance along with Blake Lively, Michiel Huisman, and Ellen Burstyn just make the film even better.  Blake Lively has the difficult task of playing a wise 107-year-old trapped in a 29-year-olds body, but she does it without flaw.  She is consistent with her line delivery and everything seems natural.  You can see her emotions just by watching her face.  Harrison Ford is convincing in his role with his expressions, body language, and lines.  These actors all let you experience their same emotions.
The story of Adalines past with William was shown effectively through flashbacks.  They showed firsthand how close her and William had been.  These flashbacks used costumes, hairstyles, and features to show how Adaline changed with the time, but also how she was the same person who had lived whole other lives.  There are smooth transitions into the flashbacks, like watching an old film and looking into a picture of the memory.
There were also different camera shots and effects that add to the soft, delicate tone of the movie.  Several times the camera looks straight down on the scene making you focus on specific things from a different angle.  There is also a nice contrast in the sounds between the loud crash and the quiet water when Adaline has an accident.
 Lee Toland Krieger was successful in creating a film that has the perfect mix of unpredictability and happy romance.  After you watch this film you will think more about how you live your life.  It shows what it would be like to have a never ending life, but not ever really being able to live.  It disproves the idea that living forever is ideal, and shows the value of mortality.",1487721600,3,3054,4.751423149905123

7235937,5,B00YS4V5BC,"At first, I was concerned that it would resemble the movie, ""Benjamin Button"" (which I loved and thoroughly enjoyed).  I was pleasantly surprised it was not. Many times, you hear the hype behind a movie and go to the theater to watch it nonetheless, to later be disappointed that it did not meet the expectation you were looking for.  I really liked the character development  (and time period segments) that made it flow seamlessly.  The look-backs also gave me insight and, while it didn't reveal everything, gave you enough history to understand her plight. I would watch this one again and again.",1487635200,,600,4.852941176470588

I think what makes this story so good is that relatability factor - we can relate. Some of us have had the ""one that got away"" experience, so we know what it's like - the unanswered questions. Thoughts of what if.... What went wrong, etc... Harrison Ford was very believable. Even got to see some of his old bad-assness when he busted down a door.
Blake Lively was beyond amazing - authentic, deep, real. All of the actors were. This was a total sleeper movie for me meaning that I didn't expect it to be that good. But it was...",1486684800,3,759,4.352112676056338

The romantic elements of it are very cute however the science really leaves a lot to be desired.  I have no problem with far fetched plots, but the way her non aging was explained and then during denouement just felt like a very lazy, half formed thought.  Then at the end all of the problems are sort of magically resolved.  Over all pretty interesting but the ending kind of made me feel like why did I bother.

Yes, the whole premise is unrealistic and it was awful easy to hide for all of those years. But aside from that, I love Blake Lively's performance and the twist with the main guy and his dad (although yes, it's a little weird).  Harrison Ford's facial expressions are amazing; exactly how I would expect I would look to encounter a ghost love from the past that you have never really stopped pining for. My 9 year old walked through and watched just a touch near the end and said ""he looks very confused"". Yes, what an understatement!

Showing is a very important aspect of a movie if you're going to have fake science; Benjamin button did something similar but in my opinion, that movie was done well.

7236697,5,B00YS4V5BC,"I have no words for this movie, I think there is so much to it that no other Love story ever has. Deffinatly one of my favorite movies of all time. I cried so many times.",1486080000,,170,3.75
7236698,1,B00YS4V5BC,"From the opening voice over, the narrator tells us about the year 1908 as the character of Adeline pulls out an Edison Newsreel from the year 1906!!!  The movie is a mess of inconsistencies from that point on.

Shortly after the inaccurate newsreel/voice over which begins with the April 16th, 1906 San Francisco earthquake and immediately flows into the birth of Adeline on January 1, 1908, we are told that the film is about the beginning and end of Adeline's life, both of which occurred at the same time.  This is yet another deception, because, at 111 years old, there are 110+ years that occurred prior to this chapter of her life.  It may be the final chapter, but there were dozens of chapters before this.  Her life has been shaped by EVERYTHING that has happened up to this point.  If this is about something other than her life, or a chapter of her life, it is unclear what that is.  If the story is supposed to be the first time she's been in a true romance, it negates the love she felt for her husband and the sadness that she supposedly felt when he died.  We did not feel either, as their romance was shown under narration and we never got to know the man, nor did we see any of their relationship.  THAT might have been a better movie...

The acting is superficial at best and, aside from Harrison Ford, it is unclear what any of the actors are feeling at any given time.  The worst part is that Adeline is supposed to be 111 years old, yet she has the morals of a woman raised in the 1960s.  She has sexual intercourse with a man after their first date.  Even if she were married previously, her values, after living for over 100 years, would not have altered so significantly.  This is completely erroneous for a female born before or after the 1920s, but, as with the rest of the movie, nothing else makes sense, so why should the main character's sexual principles?

The best part of the film is Harrison Ford's portrayal of a man who has lost the of love of his life, only to learn that she is right in front of him.  This subplot is destroyed when he lies to his current wife, telling her that SHE'S his soul mate and love of his life after we had just heard and saw that he felt the exact same thing for Adeline.  Any positive effect this film may have is immediately destroyed with a contradiction.

Paralleling the opening of the film's voice over with the  fallacious dates, the film closes on the voice of the same narrator talking about a meteor hitting the moon in the year 1178 (this is NOT a typo)!  Then the narrator tells us about an event that occurred 78 years later, because of the effects of that initial meteor strike.  Again it makes no sense that an event would be caused by a meteor strike exactly 78 years later, but to make matters worse, the event in the film actually occurred 838 years after the meteor hit!  Why would the filmmakers include dates if they were going to be paradoxical, when dates are usually inserted to create a sense of time or place?

The most specious event is the car crash.  A truck plows into a car.  After the truck hits the car once, to illustrate the force of the collision, the director repeats the crash multiple times.  After the truck drives away, the camera pulls back to show that the driver's body was thrown out of, and directly in front of the car, even though the truck impacted the driver's side, which would have trapped the body inside.  While the truck imploded the driver's side window, the door was undamaged and flung open.  This fits right in with all the other key moments that made absolutely no sense.

Finally, whoever made the choice to steal key plot points from previous films, made yet another set of fatal errors.  There are too many examples to list, but the two primary episodes are as follows:  first, when snow hits a second, yet very rare occasion the description is right out of ""Edward Scissorhands"" and when the male lead tells his father why he loves Adeline, his words are directly out of ""Titanic"".

Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with a film that had no business being made in the first place!!!",1486080000,4,4123,4.434262948207171

7236971,4,B00YS4V5BC,"Sort of vague spoilers:

Blake Lively is a better actress than you expect, sometimes.  This was a sweet/bittersweet story.  Adeline comes across as a person that belongs to another time and place.  You can imagine her coming from an earlier, more modest, less narcissistic time period.

I thought the whole ""government is out to get me"" angle was a stretch.  It's hard to imagine that they would even have noticed.  But maybe I'm not paranoid enough.

The father/son thing bordered on weird, but I think they handled it well and it was an interesting surprise ending, if a little unlikely.",1485820800,,589,4.82

This was a first for me - the first time time that I've seen Blake Lively perform. She is wonderful - she is outstanding in what is otherwise a dull and predictable movie. Why does she fall in love with Ellis, the dull and clueless boyfriend?

But she shines and it is worth watching the movie simply to see her performance. Yes, she's lovely - I don't know a living actress who has hands so lovely and graceful - but she is also, if this is a sample of her talents, a terrific actress.

Suffer through the other horrible performances (has Harrison Ford ever been this bad?) and keep your eyes on Lively - she's amazing.",1485388800,,648,4.338842975206612

7238181,2,B00YS4V5BC,"Wasn't too bad of a movie after the plot was established. What is wrong with it, is that for the first 30-45minutes, we get TONS of not so subtle references that she is old. I'm serious this really bugged the crap out of me. Yea yea Adeline, we know you've had lots of birthdays we get it. We understand you been around the block. I got that point in the previews pretty easily; I'm not sure why they worked so hard to establish that for such a large part of the movie.
Besides that its a good movie. Harrison Ford gives a great performance in the second half, and that really made it for me.",1485216000,,592,4.156521739130435
7238182,1,B00YS4V5BC,Every story has a happy ending no matter how contrived - actually the whole plot was beyond absurd. Even that might have been tolerated if it weren't for the pseudoscientific explanation of why she stopped aging and why she started up again. Who in Hollywood thinks people are gonna pay money to see these crappy movies? And how do they get decent actors like Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker to be in them? I wanted to like this movie because Hello! Daario Naharis aka  Michiel Huisman but it was not worth the slog.,1485216000,,514,4.526881720430108

7239064,3,B00YS4V5BC,"It'd get another 1 or 2 stars but for the ending.  The acting is amazing and the romantic tension is palatable, I just would've changed the last part.  I don't wanna spoil it but to me it felt like a cop-out, the character already made a choice for how to live and it didn't need to have another storyline force.  I don't like plots that put in an interesting element that effectively erases itself later, I just wish they'd committed to their premise all the way through and let love find a way even with quirks.  Aside from that fanfiction twist though, fantastic acting, the lead actress portrays a 29 year old going on 100 + about as perfect as I could imagine, and after so many male sex-symbol immortal portrayls that feel super tacky, she gives us a glimpse of what immortality, and love and heartbreak as an immortal would feel like.  Unlike all the elves and vampires who just stop caring, she cares more than ever, she never stops being human, just...timeless.  I would have followed a movie just about that.

I'm not normally one for romances, but the premise caught my eye, I like that fantastical sci-fi stuff, and they dealt with it in a really grounded way.  Again, change the ending, and I'd be slapping that 5 star rating on here right now, still, fun story, great acting, and characters and a past I came to care about and love.  More storytelling like this please, just keep the fantastical element next time.",1484438400,10,1428,4.546875

The director, the leading actress are both the major contributor of the believability of the unbelievable premise.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Harrison Ford was all right in this for his role but I felt his star power did not mix well with the rest of the relatively young crew which were unknown to me.

I gave it 5 stars because I enjoyed the fantasy type aspect of the plot where some may not . I didn't care much for the bits that were narrated but it does add a bit of dimension to the movie overall; I wouldn't lower my rating based on it. Definitely recommend but not if action adventure is the only thing that can keep your attention. Quite dramatic and sometimes even a little strange, curious fantasy type movie.

Blake Lively was fantastic, and all of the settings and scenery were incredible.  Overall, they made something supernatural (the lack of ability to age) into a beautiful, touching love story that was sad at times too.  I was enchanted the whole time!

However, like others said, I was left wanting more depth and exploration of what it would really be like to not age. So much potential here for the complexities of knowing everyone you love will die before you. The last 15 minutes rather ruined it for me, which is why a potentially 5 star rating is bumped to four. It seemed that they decided to tack on the classic happy Hollywood ending at the last minute and it just wasn't believable. Was this a book? I'd really like MORE of this theme.",1483488000,,562,4.466019417475728

7240659,4,B00YS4V5BC,"Thus is not the only story that has probed the difficulties of living ""forever"" (potentially). However, this one sees things from the viewpoint of people that come into contact with the long-lived person.

By contrast, the traditional presentation, for example in Virginia Woolf's ""Orlando"", has its focus on the person who keeps losing the ones to which [he/she] becomes attached.

By seeing the life through the perspective of the people who relate to the protagonist, we find ourselves thinking of the hurt inflicted upon so many acquaintances who invest their friendship and care in a relationship with this woman, only to have it vanish without a good explanation.

I gave it four stars instead of five only because the last couple of scenes were too predictable. However, perhaps that suggests the inevitability of the events that take place.

At any rate, seeing things from the other peoples' viewpoints certainly contributes to the emotional investment of the viewer, who increasingly longs for Adaline to take the risky plunge Into a long-term relationship. I am sure that, as noted by other reviewers, this film generates many post-viewing discussions.",1483401600,,1163,5.236559139784946

7241122,4,B00YS4V5BC,"I loved this movie for the romance.  The storyline was interesting and I found myself wondering if that were me, what would I do and how would I react.
Adeline survives a horrific crash and later discovers she does not age.  Her secret is discovered and government agencies are interested in finding out more.  She has a daughter and rather than dragging her into a life on the run, she tells her what's up and leaves without her.
Years pass and loneliness takes its toll.  Adeline drinks in facts about the world and becomes very independent and knowledgeable on many subjects.  She refuses to fall in love until one day her distant past comes back to  confront her.
It is a good movie, some things are a bit of a stretch but I loved it and so did my 30 year old grandson.",1483315200,2,773,4.370629370629371

I liked the love story a little bit, but would have loved to see more development in their relationship. Most of their interactions were of the typical superficial love story that occurs in the majority of romance films, and I think there could have been much more. I also would have liked to see/hear more of Adaline's life story. I was constantly asking myself questions about her, but would only get answers to the basics of the movie. Still a very good movie. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a solid 7.",1483142400,,660,4.330645161290323

That is hopefully the only ambition of this movie as it is the only thing that it does well.

7241323,5,B00YS4V5BC,"It's woodenly acted in some places, and lacks some of the emotional depth you might expect at certain turns. However, it's thought-provoking and tender in a way that would only be evocative to those willing to internalize and associate. If you're well into your years (and experiences), chances are you've wrestled with some of the more bittersweet sentiments and longings portrayed in this movie. As a single dad of 3 daughters in the midst of a relatively calm divorce, I decided to give it a chance and watched it alone. Water came to my eyes in two places in the film, one moreso than the other. I believe the movie relies on a conceptually precarious premise, but it nonetheless explores the heart in new and compelling ways. What is it to grow old? And, concurrently, what is to have never aged? The heart, wrinkled and weathered as it may become, forever dances in the firelight of playful youth. A good spend on 2 hours.",1482969600,58,928,4.664634146341464

I loved how it sounded very technical and I didn't care about the validity of the information since this is a fictional story.  I thought the acting was great, and Harrison Ford was splendid.

7242744,4,B00YS4V5BC,"I did like the movie...very enchanting in a Nicholas sparks kind of way, but did NOT care for the creepy, twilight zone-y narrator. For an otherwise fairly well written piece, this element was awkward, distracting from the cadence of the rest of the picture. The explanations he provided could have easily been done in a more subtle, perhaps artfully mysterious way and seemed more like a natural part that flowed with the story.
The story was good, romantic, and worth a watch even with that cheesy guy.",1482105600,,504,4.804597701149425

The beginning portion of the movie, watching Adaline come up through the decades was beautiful and got me excited for what was to come, needless to say I was a little let down with how the middle of the movie handle things. The ending was to be expected as it is a romance movie. I wouldn't watch this movie again, but I do believe it is one worth seeing if you are looking for a romance with a splash of science fiction.

7242946,2,B00YS4V5BC,This was an unfortunate pick of my fiance's.  A crude attempt at a romantic drama Age of Adeline is the tale of a young woman whom loses control of her vehicle during a snow storm. What ensues next leaves her mysteriously unable to age. She awkwardly moves from town to town when friends and neighbors become too suspicious. And then guess what. Falls in love with a smitten suitor. (Who saw that coming?) Whose father (played by Harrison Ford) was a passed lover of our ageless protagonist. Although Harrison Ford's name in the credits is usually a good reason to sit through a film.

7243048,1,B00YS4V5BC,"This movie has an interesting premise but is so poorly written and executed, it's almost painful. When Harrison Ford enters, the whole movie takes on a different tone and one realizes how much better it could have been with a better script and a better actress. Blake Lively has no idea who her character is and no idea how to act mature inside. Such a frustrating movie, nothing adds up and the big moments are absolutely hollow.",1482019200,,430,4.597402597402597

7243121,4,B00YS4V5BC,"It's a little slow at times, but it's cool and worth watching. The overall concept is really cool. And it's well made.

Blake Lively is a woman who stops aging in the 1930's. So she avoids long term relationships and photographs of herself so she doesn't get found out or hurt. But of course that plan doesn't always work out the way she plans and drama ensues.

It's a good movie. If you are looking for a sci fi film, this isn't is. Despite the overt theme of immortality there's nothing truly sci fi here. It's not Highlander.

It's a unique original concept. That alone makes it worth watching.",1481932800,,598,4.467889908256881

As a six year old child at play, I shoved my head inside a tall narrow box and walk about, until I fell off a ledge. While encased within the box, I landed on my face, causing a concussion, along with too ugly black eyes that shamed me at school. Many years later, on my way to work after dropping off my two children, my car was forced into the divider strip on the freeway, before crashing into the cement wall at an estimated speed of 60+ miles. Of course there was no car left, however after five days of total amnesia, I attempted to return to work. The Traumatic Brain Injury had jarred my memory so badly, I lost my job. I worked for some generous accountants, who arranged to subsidize my pay and I worked at a plant nursery for a year, before leaving to become the internal accountant for a 13 branch bank that spanned three Coastal California Counties. Discovering acupuncture and participating in the evolution of health care advances, my most recent physicals are somewhat unbelievable, and yet by all appearances, I have no residual appearance of the impact and usually nearly as strong as if it had never happened.

7243871,1,B00YS4V5BC,"I was yelling at the screen the whole time. The 'love interest' is so one-dimensional it might as well have been satire. He does nothing other than repeatedly ignore her polite and forceful 'no thank you, I'm not interested's, violate her privacy by finding out where she works AND lives, and pale in comparison to *spoiler* his dad who she--much more believably--loved in a past life. I didn't even watch the ten last minutes because I couldn't muster the care.

On another note, Blake Lively is as charming and lovely as usual. Daario Naharis, though, can find his way back to Essos or wherever he is tagging along after Khaleesi lately.",1481587200,,639,4.756756756756757

7244228,5,B00YS4V5BC,"This is TRULY a story of a nearly 30 year old lovely, blonde, woman (as of 1937) , crashed in her car, while driving north of the Golden Gate Bridge (which had been just opened in that year) in Sonoma County,
surviving at the EXACT SAME AGE and LIVING FOREVER at that.

Time spent through the present day:
Pre-2014 years>2014. In other words, this 1:30 film (perfect length, the minimum actually as a 2 hour or even longer length would do even better!) ins't even a half hour over when our heroine (Blake Lively) is in the present
decade (2010s).

Some notable anachronisms that, especially the third, can be, esepecially with watching any movie, be overlooked..and this movie is pretty irresistable at that:
Both of the first concern that iconic red Golden Gate Bridge. Our friendly Rod Serling-like narrator Hugh Ross (he himself MUST, like Blake Lively's Adaline, be stuck in a MUCH older body--he sounds like
someone that Rod Serling on some 1950s oldtime rado Twilight Zone got to mimic him in Rod's absence. He's excellent for a modern day ""His Twil-life:The Timely Rod Serling Story"".:-)) tells us that it's
January(?) 1929--WHAT--the longest bridge on the bay and then, except I believe for the Florida Keys R/R bridges, in the world,  the poorly underrated San Mateo Bridge (my alltime favorite of the bridges)
hadn't even been opened (March 1929), nor the Bay Bridge (November 1936) either! (The Golden Gate Bridge opened in July 1937.) Also, right before the momentous part, Blake Lively's driving north on her 29th birth in
January 1937, the bridge's own (fictious) ""anniversary"", and again it was open then but in 1937. But that's just one part of this. The other anachronistic thing isn't even that noticable: The Skyliners's (including the ill-fated Janet Vogel,
who'd been tragically killed in a fire many years ago), famosu hit ""Since I Don't Have You"", which (coincidentally, also by Lionsgate), this year's equally amazing (differently though) ""Nerve"". The song occurs sometime around
when Adeline's daughter Flemming (later played by the rather ""comeback"" Ellen Burstyn, also in 2014's ""Oscar-nomated/win ""Interstellar"" as well, as a constrastingly(indeed!) much older elderly (resspectfully) woman in the current era),
and Adeline are in church, in mid-1950s. Record didn't even hit until 1959 but still is a throwback (the Skyliners ""Since I Don't Have You"") that Johnny Ray style that immediately predates rock.

Now, on to the main thing and aside from the anacrhonstic stuff, other than the highly originaly and entertaining gimmick of Adeline'[s lifelong timelssness. Back to the January 1937 date:She arrives in a pitfall late in a snowy night, the first ythat the area's had in ages, (California having had her share of SNOW a LOT in the mountains as much as any midwestern or eastern city, just odd for Sonoma County) and is plunged into icy water and then died but as our Rod Serling tells us, lighnting lends a helping lend in THREE ways:brings our heorine back to life...makes her TWENTY NINE years YOUNG ,, and IMMORTAL (though see near end of this review).

So we now have our gal heading through several post 1930s decades, with her daughter, aging as most do, with her, (including the church with ""Since I Don't have you"" a little bit before it actually was a hit), then through the 60s dates a man and then his son in the modern decade only TO FIND that the first one, is the father, (now HARRISON FORD) and, this is shown for the first time--we don't see him before this as a younger man, and so, Adeline is remembered and later admits
to being the former flame but, fo course, this older man's married, his son's with Adeline, and she drives off. But all through this film (in the opening of which we're told by our guy in the sky that Adeline never again told anyone through her Jenny and other identities who she was UP UNTIL THIS point, and only due to her identity AS her new boyfriend's dad's FORMER flame being revealed. Yeah, a bit confusing..) we're treated to great, relaxing date/visit scenes with Adeline's hopeful buea as he shows her a inside theatre, Candlestick Park and other places in San Fransisco. We ALSO get, between the flashbacks where his dad is revealed to be a ""non Harrison Ford""-boyfriend sometime in the mid to late 60s, that now infamous horse joke the two share while walking through park one day (to quote a famous and beloved song much older than Adeline herserl) where a horse plays baseball..(maybe due to Candlestick Park's presence there)?

Finally Adeline near the end crashes again in a different place but in the same county, and killed AGAIN, and brought back life again, electrically but with human hands, and either before or just now, she is gaining
immortality as well as having two lives and being ageless the second time, and is all of that, so she can continue on! Maybe the medics involved know something about the powers of lighnting and were able to transfeer
it human power. I also hope that I am not giving away this..too much

Amanda Crew (""Sex Drive"",""Charlie St. Cloud"") plays Kikki, the leading man's sister, and Kathy Baker (who I confuse always with Kathy Bates! Must be the same first name and alliterating between the two last names of these
very different performers). is Kathy (this isn't based on a book as the character was anmed for her..obviously;) An earlier movie of hers, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" from 2013 also had flashbacks where there could have instead been opening ""earlier in the life of"" scenes). Very good extended easygoing scenes between the flashbacks that tell us something about this hopeful fiance/husband's own dad and the ""finding out at the dad's (Harrison Ford) and mom's (Kathy Baker's)"" house.",1481500800,,5717,4.8815653964984556

Now I am not sure why I found this movie, and what made me want to watch it since I usually stick with comedies. However after seen it, I am not as afraid of getting old, why would I be.

7244521,4,B00YS4V5BC,"I may have included a few minor spoilers in my review. Be warned.
This movie was not what I'd term a nail-biter.  It had a moderate pace. Though, I did not find myself bored at any time. It is just that I tend to favor action movies. However, I enjoyed ""The age of Adelaine,"" quite a lot. Blake Lively was amazing in her ability to keep her character consistent as many decades of world change flew by.  Her ability to show emotion and more than that, show contained a motion,  shows a rare gift in an actor. Too many people go over the top,  in my opinion. She played it just right. It was odd seeing her and Ellen Bernstein (forgive me if I've miss spelled her name) in the role of mother and daughter, considering the elder looking woman was actually the daughter of Blakes character. They pulled it off beautifully! The man that played Ms. Lively's final love interest played his part well. His love for Adaline came through  in a very appealing way. Then, as he grew to totally love her, he showed his intensity in a very powerful display  of human emotion .
I must say that the outstanding actor in the film was Harrison Ford. Ok, so I am a fan.  Being a fan does not take away from the facts.  His  reaction to seeing Adaline once more, after many decades, was remarkable. Their love was a special one. It was her first love when she was still living what I would call her ""first life,"" for lack of a better way to phrase it. When Adeline, (then Jenny in her latest new identity) and her love interest (can't remember his name, sorry) visit his parents, it turns out that Harrison Ford's character was his father and the man she loved so many decades ago. Harrison's initial confusion and doubts about who she was and  wondering whether or not he was losing his mind  in thinking it was HER, was so powerful.  I felt his every emotion.
 This was an unusual film, I admit.  There is some narration to set up the story and to fill in the gap's.  It seemed the best way to handle all of the information that needed to come out.

7246335,5,B00YS4V5BC,This movie truly pulls at the heart. Instead of growing old and reflecting on life she lives and faces her past along with her present.  As the viewer you take on her point of view and her personal hardships which are madly conflicting as true love never dies.  Not to mention the the soundtrack features classics from Jefferson airplane to newer independent artists like the antlers which also shows the lapse in time from past to present.,1479513600,,440,4.701298701298701
