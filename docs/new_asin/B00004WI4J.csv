3664645,2,B00004WI4J,"I teach in an EMS program and bought the video to use in teaching. It was even less informative than the shows you see on TLC or Disc channels. I realize this is a very dark subject, but the video boasted how informitive it was; it wasn't. Luckily it had a 100% satisfaction return policy.",999302400,12,289,4.2727272727272725
3664646,5,B00004WI4J,"Unlike the last reviewer, I am not in the forenics field.  I'm an average Joe (or JoAnne, being a woman), and I couldn't disagree with the last reviewer more.  I know nothing about pathologists except for what I've read in novels and seen in movies and I must say that this video did shatter the myths.  I found it fascinating to peer into the lives of people who would choose working with the the dead as a profession.  Also, the autopsy sequences were amazing and moving.  Sure, it's not wall-to-wall autopsy (go buy a ""Faces of Death"" video if that's what you want)but there's plenty of ""shocking"" footage.  I feel that this video was not meant so much as a teaching tool (or a how-to-do-an-autopsy-guide)but more as an enlightening and revealing look at a seldom seen - and very important - medical procedure.  To be honest, this video is not for the squeamish.  I've seen images here that I'll not soon forget.  It showed me that the human body is also beautiful on the inside - - and that the people who work as coroners and pathologists should be respected not ridiculed. This is one great documentary. 2 thumbs up.",970099200,12,1122,4.57
3664647,1,B00004WI4J,"I teach forensic science and grave excavation. I was hoping this tape would take me and the students into a morgue ""setting"" when we  couldn't actually go. I liked the first 15 minutes of the tape, because it  actually had to do with autopsy...but why did you have to do a background  on the medical examiner's.  We work in this environment too.  We can't  possibly think the public thinks so small that they wouldn't think M.E.,  police officers, etc. have no life but in the lab/morgue/streets? Do they?  Anyway, I hoped the tape had more autopsy material, but it didn't.",966643200,12,573,4.66

3664649,1,B00004WI4J,I can't give it any stars. (Had to give it one to submit my review.  The Audio did not work.  Could not hear anything.  And we have not had any issues with other movies and shows audio from amazon prime.,1426723200,,203,4.025

3664652,1,B00004WI4J,I ordered and paid for this. No subtitles and no sound. Complete waste of money!,1407888000,,80,4.4
3664653,5,B00004WI4J,Used this in the classroom and  was very educational.  Only complaint it was vhs so not as clear as dvds!,1360540800,,105,4.2
3664654,2,B00004WI4J,I thought this was going to have more in depth autopsy action.  It has a lot of footage of the pathologists. A better title would have been PATHOLOGISTS TALK ABOUT THEIR WORK AND SHARE THEIR FAMILY PHOTOS.  Bfirst time I'm disappointed in an Amazon purchase.,1358812800,,258,4.711111111111111
3664655,5,B00004WI4J,"This video is probably the best I have seen of autopsy videos for educational purposes... Provides a great view from different camera angles, and a thorough description that makes it easy to understand what is going on. Very tasteful and done with respect. A must see for all A&P and Advanced Physiology students.",1265328000,2,313,4.9245283018867925

3664657,2,B00004WI4J,"Personnally, I thought it could of been in more detail.  There were alot of discussions with Doctors, so I was disappointed in the video. I'm not certain as to what I really expected, but I didn't think it was going to be as much talking as there was.",1031702400,5,251,4.229166666666667

8314748,3,B00004WI4J,"Now that my nausea has subsided......  This mini-doc on forensic pathology taught me some things such as; We are all pink and stinky on the inside and look like baby back ribs, I don't want to die, pathologists are weird people, I don't want to die, dead people look rubbery, I don't want to die.
  This true life film starts off with a bang as we watch an autopsy from 'Y' incision to brain removal. There are multiple interviews of forensic pathologists, who incidentally, insist they are normal people. They are not. One female Dr., who's rocking her mom jeans, is seen stroking her giant pet snake as she talks about her work and her hobby of riding roller coasters. One Dr. states he has no social life because he likes removing people's brains too much. Another talks about deceased hot chicks and necrophilia.
  This doc. delves more into the lives of the forensic pathologists and is only slightly interesting. It is graphic and shows snippets of an autopsy. The quality is ok, it's from at least 20 yrs ago and reminds me of the type of filmstrip we would be forced to watch in health class.
  Overall, not bad but there are better films out there which are more interesting and up to date.",1456876800,2,1199,4.5488372093023255
