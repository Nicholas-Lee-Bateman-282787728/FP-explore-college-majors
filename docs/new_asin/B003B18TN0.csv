8395907,4,B003B18TN0,"Firstly I will say that I purchased this with some trepidation. I generally only purchase Blu Ray items from the Main Stream Studios. But I must say I was pleasently surprised..Apart ftom the Title Credits that still had considerable ""noise"" and ""artifacts"" through it, the rest of the movie has had some work done it, and the result is a very watchable good quality Blu Ray..I believe at time of writing this review, this is the only Blu Ray of these two available in English...Bring them on. The sooner the better..",1301184000,2,517,4.6923076923076925
