5078970,5,B007D0FVRM,I had read a collection of interviews by Tarentino and wanted to revisit these movies. It is a good collection with 3 different DVDs.  Has commentary on each disk & trailers. This would be good for any private collection.,1375056000,2,221,4.666666666666667
5078971,5,B007D0FVRM,"I think when a scene cannot be missed and you have to pause, that's intense. Excuse the punt, but I enjoyed the movie, it wasn't recommended, I'm glad I bought the 3PK",1370736000,,167,4.25

5078977,5,B007D0FVRM,All of these movies are worth watching.  Pulp Fiction is a classic and Jackie Brown is a continuation ... though not as good as Pulp Fiction.  I have not had time to view the last movie in the set.,1358467200,,197,4.0256410256410255
5078978,4,B007D0FVRM,"All three movies have terrific themes. One of them lags quite a bit in delivery style, but makes up for it in casting.
Frankly, Tarantino relies on superb casting to carry ocassionally lame plot lines .. but pulls it off splendidly.
In short, these are cult classics .. not Cinema Classics.

5078980,5,B007D0FVRM,"For less than $5, free shipping, this was a steal. Took about a week and some change. I could have sworn that I bought this used but it came new, still in the plastic (no complaints!). The discs were unblemished in any way. I'm looking forward to the Tarantino experience this week. The man's a genius.

That last pic is just to show that the case is still normal sized, for 3 discs.",1505692800,2,383,4.2465753424657535

8514860,5,B007D0FVRM,"Spoiler warning-
I bought this mainly for Pulp Fiction, for that movie alone, the price was right.  Reservior Dogs was a little stupid, it felt like I was watching a stage play with every other word being obscene.  Jackie Brown was a little better, but the plot, sub-plot, mini-sub-plot, micro-mini-sub-plot, was just too twisted for most people to follow and enjoy.  The twists were overkill, with FEWER twists you have a much better movie.  (A little) ""Less is more"" is what this movie needed.  I'll enjoy Pulp Fiction much more often than the other two, while, to me, the other movies are ""bonus"" material.",1512432000,2,609,4.8173076923076925
