8424301,5,B004CZRE6C,"Very good late 50's thriller.  A little boy witnesses the killing of his mother's employer and wander off in a state of shock.  Meanwhile his mother has been kept hostage by the killers, three juvenile delinquents.  The boy is picked up but since he is in a catatonic state the police, including his detective dad, separated from his wife, are scrambling to find her with no clues.  The Columbia Pictures DVD-R release is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.",1434326400,3,461,4.935064935064935

8424304,4,B004CZRE6C,"After watching most of the 234 episodes of Leave it to Beaver more than once, it was unnerving to see Beaver (Jerry Mathers) cast as a boy who witnesses a crime that leaves him in a state of catatonic shock. With his mom held hostage by 3 teenaged punks, it's up to his police officer dad, played by Philip Carey, to solve the whereabouts of his hostage wife.
Pretty standard fare for the 1950s but the 3 hooligans are true to type.",1399507200,,432,4.280487804878049
