8281123,5,B001B18720,"I bought this collection for ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte.""  I ended up becoming a fan of ""Don't Say A Word.""  This is a terrific Michael Douglas film...  perfectly written and directed.  You'll love it.  Special features are included with this edition and they are quite good.  The back-story concerning the making of ""Hush, Hush"" is even better than the film itself and tells much about Joan Crawford, who was originally part of the film, and Bette Davis. Great price... fun films!",1328227200,2,482,4.888888888888889
