5735002,4,B00CQO9YO6,"GREAT LITTLE COMEDY. . . Not listed on the web. . .Guess since its Italian, it doesn't meet the bilingual languages that the USA has become!",1414886400,,140,4.423076923076923
5735003,5,B00CQO9YO6,"Funny, quirky, sweet tale.",1412294400,,26,5.75
5735004,4,B00CQO9YO6,Very well done,1412121600,,14,4.0
5735005,4,B00CQO9YO6,"Though it has subtitles, due to being in Italian, it is an enjoyable watch.  As in the movie, life is real, the parents and family already knew.",1391904000,,144,4.333333333333333
5735006,4,B00CQO9YO6,"Sub tiles were very fast.  Really had to exert effort to keep up.  So four stars.

Regular family stuff with people who were in the know.  Matthio had unfounded dread of being ""discovered"" and lost a lot of time fearing.  The story was quick paced, but got all the essentials  in about family life and coming out for a young man.

Would recommend to any young person who is fretful about being him/her self.

Matthio could be a dead ringer for Justine Timberlake!",1390435200,2,463,4.493975903614458
5735007,5,B00CQO9YO6,"Matthia is a young Italian man, deeply closeted as he lives with his divorced mother and feisty, germ-phobic grandmother.  When he meets Eduard, a tourist from Spain, they fall in love, and make plans for Matthia to move to Spain so they can be together.  He lies to Eduard that he has come out to his family, assuming they would never meet.  Matthia panics when Eduard announces a surprise:  he will fly back to Italy  tomorrow, at a scheduled family dinner to say goodbye  so they can drive back together.

The actual title for this 2012 movie from Italy is Come Non Detto (Nevermind), but it was renamed for the DVD release in the US.  It is a very sweet coming-of-age story, to which anyone can relate.  The acting is first rate, and colorful supporting  characters add to the fun.  Would be rated a light R for sexual situations.  DVD has no extras other than the trailer.  Five stars out of five.",1386633600,7,902,4.493827160493828
5735008,5,B00CQO9YO6,This Italian film is a gem. Very very funny and a brilliant script and  superb acting. Truly one of the best gay films of the year. Don't miss it. A true feel good  gay movie.,1386374400,2,175,3.9714285714285715
5735009,4,B00CQO9YO6,"This was a good movie. My only issue was that the captioning was out of sync with the scenes, other than that it was good non the less.",1483920000,,135,3.857142857142857
5735010,4,B00CQO9YO6,"Fun comedy with a bit of an unexpected twist at the end.  Kind of a typical story.  I found myself saying, ""Just tell them"" during the story--would have been the ""real"" solution rather than the zany turns the story had to undergo to get to the conclusion.  Fun and gave me a smile, nonetheless.",1483488000,,294,4.407407407407407
5735011,4,B00CQO9YO6,Nice story.,1480291200,,11,5.0
5735012,1,B00CQO9YO6,"Somebody obviously has a ""loose chain"" or is it ""a screw loose""  Didn't know they could speak so fast  in Italian!
Otherwise,  another senseless, dumb film (senseless even in English).  Ciao ( or Caio )  Whatever!  ""Aufwiedersehen""  !!",1479859200,,235,5.026315789473684

5735014,4,B00CQO9YO6,A very good & honest movie. The only problem is the English subtitles go very fast so loose some dialog.,1478390400,,104,4.25
5735015,3,B00CQO9YO6,"I think the story itself was good, but the captioning was really quick, and it seemed to not exactly fit the immediate scene.  The cinematography was really nice, and the actors were good.  My only problem was the captioning, otherwise I did enjoy the movie.",1477267200,2,258,4.711111111111111
5735016,2,B00CQO9YO6,"This movie felt like it was more about coming out to your family than it was between the relationship between the two guys. So as far as my rating, it wasn't what I wanted.",1476835200,2,172,4.088235294117647
5735017,5,B00CQO9YO6,Very realistic. I recommend watching if you don't mind sub titles. It really relates what the protagonist is going through to the audience. It's enjoyable and not to heady. It's nice to be able to find a film like this.,1476748800,,219,4.5

5735021,3,B00CQO9YO6,A light hearted production. I enjoyed it and only got a bit lost because the time given to read the translation  was such a small amount of time !!!  SO THAT BEING SAID - Story 8. acting 9  FIT FOR TRANSLATION 3.,1475884800,4,212,4.0
5735022,5,B00CQO9YO6,"A delightful comedy, sweet, well-acted and fast-paced. This film is worth the time and money invested. And yes, the subtitles can speed by.",1475452800,2,139,5.086956521739131
5735023,5,B00CQO9YO6,"Very cute movie, very funny, descent romantic ending but seems they could have let the families get together with the boyfriend more.",1463443200,2,133,5.090909090909091

5735025,5,B00CQO9YO6,"Original title of this was `Come non detto' roughly meaning best left unsaid. Released as `Tell no one' which makes it sound a tad sinister but it is actually a very warm comedy. It is all about Mattia who is gay but is too ashamed / afraid to come out to his parents, he has to his friends and has had to suffer abuse at school too. So he is moving to Madrid to live with his boyfriend - Eduardo. The thing is he has told Eduardo that his family are all in the know and are all happy swinging liberal types who welcome his gayness.

The problem is that his father keeps displaying behaviour that is almost homophobic, his mother is a bag of nerves, his sister is a resentful baby making machine and his 83 year old gran keeps applying for any job that is advertised irrespective of how unsuitable that it may be for her. Then on the eve of Mattia's leaving, Eduardo tells him that - big surprise - he is arriving in Italy that night for his farewell diner party.

What follows is a very funny, often a bit madcap but always entertaining romp as Mattia and friends try to stop his whole world from blowing up in his face.

I really enjoyed this, it is well acted, over the top when it needs to be stupid in the right places and with good translations in the sub titles; everyone was engaging and even the end credits were good. This is one that it is very easy to recommend and I hope you ruddy well enjoy it as much as I did.",1447200000,3,1426,4.140794223826715
5735026,4,B00CQO9YO6,I liked it. A very fast paced film with some good casting. I laughed a few times over the course of the movie and enjoyed the plot. The grandmother is a trip ! A sweet pg13 foreign film about coming out to the family. Ones out and proud and the other is finding it hard to do. Dont want to give to much away. One thing you need to know is that the subtitles pop up fast and go away even faster. You have to be a speed reader.,1427328000,2,425,3.7865168539325844
