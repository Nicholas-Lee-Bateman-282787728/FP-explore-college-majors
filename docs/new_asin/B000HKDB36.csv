2638543,3,B000HKDB36,"The mish mash of modern and traditional costuming in this opera is very distracting and spoiled enjoyment of the opera for me.  Norma in priestess robe singing to a Roman soldier in a blue striped suit, idiotic and unecessary props like modern kitchen chairs and dressing tables with photos plastered on the mirror, all seem totally unecessary for the plot.  One person has sarcastically labelled this all too common trend in modern opera productions as ""Eurotrash"".  Much as I dislike the connotation, I must admit that it applies to this production.  A shame because their is some beautiful singing from Hasmic Papian and Irini Tsirakidis although not all support roles were impressive.  Another peculiarity, which I noted in a couple of other Blue Ray opera productions, was an uneveness in the volume of the voices at times plus a strange echo which appeared to be in the stage as it disappeared when the curtain dropped.
For once I looked at the ""extras"" before viewing the main event but they failed in preparing me for the odd approach to the opera with the Druits sometimes in casual modern dress but other times dressed up in the sort of religious garb appropriate for the context of the story.  In summary, perplexing and confusing.
So, overall I cannot fully recommend this disc.  Like the curates egg, it is bad in parts and sadly, there are too many of these.",1254441600,6,1372,4.788135593220339
2638544,4,B000HKDB36,"I was unprepared for the presentation and was initially irritated by the opening which brings ancient Rome backstage of a modern opera house. It all looked as if I was in for another of these modern and all too often pretentious productions. (I am generally a traditionalist and prefer to see what the composer would have had in mind). I had not done any home work and had not grasped what the producer was up to. The playing and singing is however exceptional and as the disc progressed I forgot my initial dislike and came to enjoy it more and more. This is an excellent disc, but go to the extras BEFORE you watch the opera. You will then avoid my mistake and be able to follow the production so much better. This is not the traditional Norma but neither is it the dreaded 'dinner suits on an empty stage'. The blend is quite skillful and once one accepts the revised plot the disc can be fully enjoyed. My initial reaction was to send it back, I will now keep it and expect to watch it many times. Get it, it is visually and sonically outstanding.",1226102400,20,1051,4.36734693877551
2638545,1,B000HKDB36,"This is that ridiculous Norma dvd from a couple of years ago, yet again. Changing the package, and the technology is not going to make it any better. Another ""concept"" on a masterpiece. This time we are backstage with the singers, making entrances and exits. None of it makes any sense. Norma makes her first entrance done up like Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard. What has that to do with anyting in the libretto? From there it is downhill. If the singing were great, maybe, but it isn't. Why bother. Get the Caballe Normas from Orange or Barcelona. Magnificent. When I first ordered this mess I played it several times to see if it had some redeeming factors. I sold it online for $10.00.

2638547,1,B000HKDB36,"I wish Mr Rishoi would post his evaluation of this Norma here. I believe he said it was the worst production of Norma he had ever watched. I agree totally.

I almost went to Amsterdam to watch this production. I'm glad I did not. Instead of Bellini's great tragedy of sacrifice, forgiveness and reconciliation, we are treated to a story about two sopranos fighting for a tenor, and who happened to be singing Norma. So the story of Norma becomes relegated to become the backdrop for the real drama on-stage.

I would not pay to watch an opera about 3 singers who happened to sing in an opera which roughly reflected their 'real-life' situations. Neither would I have paid for this DVD.

I found the whole production so distracting that I could not listen to the music except by closing my eyes. But then Papian et al are nowhere near the likes of Callas, Sutherland, Caballe or even Scotto as Norma to merit such a listening.

I will not want to watch it again.

Stick to your Caballe DVD.",1166572800,15,989,4.5027932960893855
2638548,1,B000HKDB36,"Oh, you're gonna love this one. Let's see here if I can do

justice to this spellbinding mess, and sort out the story

behind the story behind the story, the disaster behind the

disaster within another disaster.

We learn from the opening shots that this production is

going to endeavor to make Bellini's masterpiece ""more

interesting."" To improve upon it. During the overture, we

see a Pavarotti-type tenor dressed in a faintly 1940s

gangsterish suit come out onto a stage. The stage has black

shiny-mirror-enameled floors, with a huge fallen tree

across it. The tenor positions himself in front of a

dressing-room makeup table with lighted mirror, sets his

crested helmet down, and sits in front of the table. He

pulls out from his bag a Madonna figurine (not the pop

star), kisses it, sets it on the table. He picks up a

magazine, a ""Il Mondo Dell Opera,"" with himself on the

cover, and looks delghtedly through it. He decides to have

some coffee and spills it all over the table, whereby he

cleans it up. A severe-dressed stage assistant smilingly

brings out his gilded six-pack abs breast/torso plate,

along with a dozen roses; they kissy-kissy. He generously

shows her his magazine. She climbs onto his lap and they

start making out. A male figure - director? - comes in,

as she makes her exit. They pantomime chortle to each other

- ooh, that's one hot chick they seem to be saying. The

assistant gives the tenor a newspaper - Il Giornale - the

tenor looks at it anxiously, and slams the paper back,

scratches his forehead anxiously. Another hatted, spiffily

dressed gentlemen - the Oroveso - comes in, sets HIS stuff

down on another dressing table, in front of the tree. The

three commiserate over the newspaper. The Oroveso takes his

score out, sets it on the the fallen tree trunk, and starts

studying it. Overture ends.

The chorus, in their civilian clothes come out, and begin

milling around behind the tree. The Pollione takes his

roses and sets them over at yet another dressing table.

The Oroveso, in full 1940s civilian clothes and overcoat,

lifts his leg up, sets his foot on the fallen tree, places

his score on his knee, and begins singing ""Ite sul colle.""

Nice, solid tone. The chorus, dressed in dapper civilian

clothes, many with roses in their hands, places them around

the center dressing table. Pollione, as the chorus exits,

reads the cards on the roses, anxious as to who they're

from. The Flavio comes out, in full 1950s Gladiator Gear,

and he and Pollione proceed with their scene. The tenor

sings ""Meco all'tar di Venere"" with a bright, loud, bugly

tone. The high C kicks in after a slight hiccup. Lots of

extraneous stage business. Just before his cabaletta, the

chorus comes out, and Pollione begins changing into his

costume. One verse of the caba-clatter-etta. Choked high

C.

For Norma's entrance. The chorus, standing behind the tree.

 They start clapping, applauding. Flashbulbs go off. A

prima donna figure, complete with shiny silver raincoat,

head-crown-turban, Lana Turner styled sunglasses, fur

stole, comes in, delighted at the reception. Starts signing

autographs. Walks grandly over to her dressing table,

unloads her gear, gets undressed, assistant helps her with

a red Classical Norma gown. Admires her roses.

""Rehearsal"" gets under way, with ""Sediziose voci."" During

Oroveso's interlude, she checks out the dressing table in

which Pollione has placed his red roses (there is a point

 here, stay with me). Norma has a pleasing timbre, but her

tremulous singing does not bode well. ""Casta diva"" is

adequate, no more. The line is loose, not ideally bound,

the top pushed. No real mezza-voce. One verse of the

cabaletta, clumsily sung, the coda trimmed. Converts words

into ""ah"" for the florid passages. Meantime, a younger

woman has come in, looks imperiously over at the Norma,

sits at the the dressing table with the Pollione-laden red

roses.

The younger woman turns out to be the Adalgisa. An

attractive, raven haired Greek woman. In an ingenue-type

dress. Takes costume out of suitcase, places it in front of

her. Steps cautiously to the front of the stage, and

pantomimes being a prima donna acknowledging applause.

Adalgisa has a pleasing, creamy tone, and sings her sortita

nicely. She and Pollione get into their duet, taking place

in the ""dressing room.""

It's obvious by now, that this staging is mixing both the

backstage element with the opera pushed to the background:

a real life triangle with the opera's. The Pollione is now

infatuated with the Adalgisa, spurning the aging prima

donna Norma. Only the Adalgisa is not a sweet young thing.

Her backstage persona is scheming, calculating, while she

sings the vestal virgin's lines.

The Buster Brown-attired Clotilde come up from a trap in

the floor with Norma's 2 Dutch children. They play around

her dressing table. It commences with Norma in her motherly

dilemma. Norma and Adalgisa proceed with their duet, but we

see Adalgisa looking contemptuously at Norma - oooh she's

got an agenda.

Pollione comes onto the scene, and of course the ""double""

meaning of the trio is supposed to be manifest. Norma is

in dire straits vocally in ""O non tremare,"" the C's pushed

out painfully. Her high D capping the act achieves at least

3 different pitches.

Norma, Pollione and Adalgisa go back to their dressing

tables, miffed.

For act two, same stage. Adalgisa at her dressing table.

Kids asleep on the floor. Norma comes out in this white and

red Quo Vadis gown adorned with gold, and a big red fright

wig. Dutch kids see mamma brandishing a knife (none too

convincingly), run over to nanny Clotilde, and are sent

back under the stage. Norma and Adalgisa go through their

paces in the duet - higher key, both strained, tremulous

on top, not ideal.

Oroveso's Norma-Getting-Ready-For-Her-Final-Scene interlude

is fully staged in costume: combination Viking, Fractured

Fairy Tales. Several of the chorus, including Oroveso has

little mistletoe wings on their heads.

When Norma finds out of Pollione's existence in the

temple/opera house from Nanny Clotilde, she goes over to

his dressing table, grabs the chair and starts smashing the

mirror with the leg of the chair. She's a bit angry. Each

hit is sorta kinda timed with the gong, but it's off.

Having Expressed Anger, Norma tosses chair aside.

 ""Sterminio"" comes out as ""Her minio."" A Freudian slip??

Pollione comes back out -in civilian clothing. Yes, amongst

the fully costumed cast. He looks aghast at Norma's knife

brandishing.

Curtain closes. The duet commences in front of the red

stage curtain. Pollione's smashed-mirror dressing table

off the left. Norma leans on it, folds her arms

petulantly, and mildly goes into `In mia man."" They have a

little spat. ""Agalgisa fia punita"" disappears, not at all

audible. At the end, we get the two freeze-framed in

place, Norma pointing her knife at Pollione. The director

told her to Do It That Way.

Confession goes off without a hitch. Ditto without a shiver

of emotion. Red wig dramatically removed. Attendants strip

her of her gold adornment, baubles.

As Norma sings ""Qual cor tradisti,"" Pollione gradually puts

back on the rest of his civilian clothes. So does Norma.

Silver raincoat. Fur stole. Hat box carried thoughtfully by

 Pollione. (Or is it a makeup case? I was left wondering

for the rest of the opera.)

All of a sudden Norma realizes she has two Dutch kiddies to

think about. Begs Papa to take care of them. Norma, smiling

beamingly at Oroveso, sits down in relief. Papa comforts

her further, to more smiles.

Norma picks up her stole, wraps it around her, and she and

Pollione begin to leave the company. Then. Oh. What's

this!!?? It's Adalgisa!! Adalgisa ritorna! Vincitor!! She

is wearing Norma's costume with red wig! She has stolen

Norma's Mistletoe-Cutter and is NOW THE NEW younger

NORMA!!!!! Old Norma, smiling unconcernedly, caterwauls

""addio"" along with Pollione, and sweeps out as grandly as

she entered. Oh wait! Pollione is torn. He does not know

whether to follow Old Norma to Desmond Country or stay and

share victory with Young Norma. Being as Young always

wins, he drops Norma's hat box (I'm still trying to figure

out if that's a hatbox or a makeup case well anyway), he

inches longingly toward Adalgisa, I mean The New Norma, as

the curtain drops to a happy ending!

Bellini's devastating ending has been totally aborted here.

See the parallel? All About Adalgisa.

But it gets even better.

Along with this expensive two-DVD set comes an ""Extras""

feature. It should be called Extra Extra Special feature,

because it is every bit as mesmerizing as the allegedly brilliant

staging.

The feature is about the making of this production. Julian

Reynolds talks about how the prima donna made it possible

to do this Norma. We see the prima donna complaining to the

costume designer that the gold-leafed Druid tiara is too

thin and doesn't fit. But oh, she tells him, it's a

beautiful, beautiful thing. Then she gives it to the

costume designer, and jokes to him, ""Can you put some voice

in that as well?"" And she cracks up, overjoyed at her

scintillation.

The prima donna, imperious, complains about the paint on a

dressing room wall. She is anxious. Allergic, she says.

Interviewer asks her: Do you worry a lot about your voice?

Answer"" We are paranoiac, yeah."" Nods vigorously. ""We...( I

mean)I wake up in the morning and I'm frightened to say

""good morning"", because I'm frightened...We are very fragile,

very vulnerable."" She says with an obviously forced laugh.

She is trying to laugh off her anxiety, but is not

succeeding. And tries to explain what can affect the

voice. She pulls up every reason possible. We see her in

rehearsal, checking everything to make sure it won't

interfere with her voice. She is reassured that the smoke

won't affect her. It does...oor something else.

Apparently, it WAS the paint or the smoke, created from

ice. This is the production where Nelly Miricioiu was

supposedly ailing with a throat infection, and Lucia

Aliberti sang for her in the wings for the premiere.

 Hasmik Papian came in for the rest of the run, as Aliberti

wasn't available for further performances. Miricioiu takes

up most of this documentary. We see her rehearsing ""Casta

diva,"" and not doing very well with it. Nothing of an

illness seems wrong with her during the making of this or

through the rehearsals. It is obvious that her voice is no

longer up to doing this role: all her protestations about

the ""fragility"" of herself seem to be self-validations, in

attempt to reassure herself that it's something else, not

her, that's caused her vocal deterioration.

We then see the last part of this documentary with the

younger Papian taking over. Papian comes across as

thoughtful, modest, a bit reticent, but appealing.

As in the opera, the younger woman has come in to take the

veteran's place. Unfortunately this documentary is not at

all flattering to Miricioiu. She comes across neurotic,

paranoid, and posturing. And a little pathetic. You see her

vainly trying to hide her anxieties about what she knows is

the truth. I think she came into this production knowing

she was not up to the role, but was going to make a valiant

attempt anyway. And canceled because by opening night,

knew it wouldn't work.

Callas fans be warned: both the tenor and conductor give

their opinions on her. Of the ""she was great but..."" vein.

They averred that Callas, when she declined vocally,

defaulted, to make up for that decline, to a ""verismo""

approach. Conductor and tenor don't approve of verismo in

bel canto. And the conductor tries to sell Miricioiu's

completely ""different"" approach. Hmm.

  If you're looking for something remotely resembling

Bellini's opera, you can safely stay away from this one.

But if you don't want to play it safe, and need something

mesmerizingly terrible to watch, then this is your fix!

By far, the worst Norma I've ever encountered. Why? Because it replaces Bellini's and Romani's Norma with an American movie plot. The designers, directors and producers evidently felt the opera was not good enough to stand on its own.",1162771200,14,12283,4.906908378245958
2638549,4,B000HKDB36,"What should contemporary stage directors do with a classic operatic masterpiece like Bellini's Norma whose story seems so totally defined by a certain time or place (in this case Roman-occupied Gaul)?  In this Dutch production, the director has tried to breathe new life into the work by making the two female leads (Norma and Adalgisa) competing contemporary opera divas who are also participating in a production of Norma--and they are competing for the real-life love of a tenor who of course is also in the opera.  Sometimes this multi-layered conceit works and sometimes it runs directly counter to the words of the libretto (especially at the end when the Norma diva is portrayed as having won the battle and going off stage to live happily ever after with her tenor/lover while the chorus sings of the funeral pyre and Norma's tears--she's smiling!).  So it is altogether an interesting but uneven attempt to bring a fresh perspective to this beautiful score.  Musically the performance is very good, especially the orchestra and Norma herself (Hasmik Papian).  Adalgisa is a bit shrill (Irini Tsirakidis) and Pollione (Hugh Smith) has to huff and puff to get through his part.  Certainly this is not a first choice for anyone unfamiliar with this opera (there is a great performance on DVD by Caballe and a very good one by June Anderson)--but it's an interesting addition to the catalog.",1162771200,12,1396,4.995689655172414

8140088,3,B000HKDB36,"Oh, but it's a beautiful, beautiful thing, says deposed diva Nelly Miricioiu (who was to sing Norma here in Amsterdam in 2005, struggled on opening night, and was replaced for the filming) in a revealing making-of feature on this DVD. She is referring to a prop tiara she finds too thin and too light. She could be describing this production: a beautiful, beautiful thing that is too thin and too light. This theater-world mashup of an opera house circa mid 20th century (around the time of ALL ABOUT EVE, the obvious influence) and the almost parodistic traditional NORMA that the company is seen rehearsing, is undeniably attractive to look at.

The concept: The reigning opera diva playing Norma is in love with the tenor playing Pollione. He either was in love with her and now no longer is, or never was to begin with. He is a playboy with an eye for attractive support personnel. A younger singer playing Adalgisa, moving under a smokescreen of flattery and faux-innocence, schemes to take the Norma's place in the tenor's heart and as queen of opera. In this production, Adalgisa is sung by a mezzo-soprano. So, as far as the professional half of her agenda goes, it is a little like Elna Garana trying to bump off Anna Netrebko as reigning diva. Or, if the gender were switched, Mariusz Kwiecien plotting to be a bigger star than Jonas Kaufmann. But never mind. We are not supposed to think about such realistic matters as voice type. And some Adalgisas have become Normas, or vice versa.

The wisdom of the basic concept can be debated. It would be reasonable to point out that the ""innovation"" here, the thing that is supposed to make NORMA more relatable to a modern audience, is simply the augmenting of one very familiar story (the NORMA libretto, with roots as far back as the ancient Medea plays) with elements of a story that, to an audience of 2005, may have been even *more* familiar and well worn: ALL ABOUT EVE and all the ""aging star/young rival"" showbiz tales that preceded or followed it.

Let it be said that Guy Joosten, the director, is a competent pro. This is not idiotically done. I have seen such updates work *better*, but it mostly comes off. Joosten finds humor at moments, such as when Norma encourages Adalgisa to embrace her, and Adalgisa shakes her head and makes a face like ""Eh, I'm good over here, thanks; I don't think we need to *hug* over it,"" and Norma turns her back in disgust like ""Oh, *fine*, be that way."" Or when Oroveso, the bass being portrayed as the most professional and prepared of the singers in the NORMA-within-a-NORMA, has to prompt the Norma by whispering the beginning of a line in rehearsal. The others have been tangled up in their love triangle; he is the one who is getting no nookie and has been diligently studying his score. Or when Norma suggests that Adalgisa be a mother to Norma and Pollione's children, and Adalgisa is like ""Whoa, Nelly [even though Nelly had to leave the production]. I want the sexy guy, and I want to be queen of opera, but let's hold off on this children business."" Or when Pollione sees second tenor Flavio (nicely played by Carlo Bosi as a comprimario who is everyone's flamboyant pal) in gladiator gear and a terrible wig, and cracks up.

On the other hand, when you try to tell one story within another, and you cannot write new dialogue or add new scenes, inevitably confusion is sown. Not every narrative loose end here can be covered with the ""rehearsing NORMA"" conceit. Most of the snags come in matters relating to Norma's children with Pollione. They really were able to be kept secret? What on earth is Clotilde supposed to be, the woman who runs the basement daycare of the opera house? And Norma really is leaving her two kids in the care of her bass colleague at the end, as she...retires from music? Finds a new home company where she can leave these bad memories behind? Works the recital circuit? Joins a faculty?

We are tantalized in the staging of the overture with Pollione being upset by something in the newspaper, after he had been in a very good mood over a puff profile of him in a glossy magazine, this production's equivalent of OPERA NEWS. But the staging can never show us (as a movie would do) what is upsetting to him in the newspaper. Bad reviews for something else he has done? Bad reviews for an earlier performance of this NORMA? Reports of his real-life affairs? ""Dewey Defeats Truman""? I have no idea. Later, the Oroveso is carefully clipping something out of the same newspaper with scissors, so if I had to guess, I would say the tenor got a detailed negative review but the bass was praised in one sentence near the end for being dignified. Or...maybe Pollione was upset that a newspaper feature on the new NORMA production focused only on the big star singing Norma, and not him. Then the Oroveso, who seems close to the Norma, is clipping out the article for his soprano colleague's scrapbook. But it is anyone's guess. We just have to go with ""Something in the newspaper makes Pollione unhappy, but Oroveso is fine with it.""

Here is the biggest problem with this. You can set this opera in another time or place, fine. It does not have to be Gaul a hundred years B.C. The characters do not have to be wearing Druidical robes/gowns and Roman armor...which they *are* doing half the time here. All I think you need to do is find a temporal correspondence worthy of this music. Bellini's music in NORMA speaks of titanic things. It speaks of storms and flames, of tragedy, or life-and-death matters. When he was setting the text of SONNAMBULA, Bellini wrote a very different kind of music to match the situation and tone of SONNAMBULA, though still music with his hallmarks. Every note he wrote for NORMA followed an impulse to match the scale and stakes of the NORMA story.

A wealthy and beloved opera singer being unfortunate in love and having to yield her place in the opera world to a younger rival may be poignant, or bittersweet, but it is not *tragic*. So we are looking at something that might work if a bel canto equivalent of ROSENKAVALIER were playing over it, while the music is persistently reminding us of something far grander, far graver.

Julian Reynolds, leading the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra and Chorus of De Nederlandse Opera, conducts very well, if you can acclimate yourself to what he is going for, which is a sort of Historically Informed chamber-orchestra NORMA: light, crisp, and intimate, probably a reasonable scholarly attempt at a NORMA of Bellini's time rather than the heavier, post-Verdi/verismo attempts of classic recordings. Reynolds accompanies singers very well. He impresses as a conductor who wants his cast to sound as good as they can sound. He is a major asset.

Of the four principals, only Giorgio Giuseppini, an excellent Oroveso (""dignified,"" one would even say!), seems still to be having a busy career. That in itself is troubling, because all of these singers are relatively young as filmed. According to Operabase, lead soprano and tenor have sung nowhere since 2013; mezzo has done two operas in her native Greece in the last six years.

Hasmik Papian has an attractive tone and is a handsome woman, but she is doubly miscast, first because much of this florid music is beyond her technical set and she is challenged by its wide range, second because she looks and was very young. At least Miricioiu would have been ""senior"" enough to sell the concept. Papian should be commended for stepping in and saving the show, but it is doubtful she had much time with Joosten to have his ideas drilled into her, and she imports little force of personality on her own. She makes a very likable Norma. Is there anything worse I could say than that?

Neither Papian nor Irini Tsirakidis, the latter done up in homage to the young, pre-glam Callas (but thinner), really thrives in those long Bellinian lines Tsirakidis too has a pleasant timbre and does some things well, and she is a charming actress who does a good job with the agenda-concealing ingenue. Joosten's most literal homage is a direct lift from the Davis/Baxter movie, when Adalgisa holds a costume in front of her and bows for an imagined audience.

The 6'5"" Hugh Smith suggests Corelli in his complexion and the styling of his hair and eyebrows, but sounds more like Jon Vickers as Pollione. Startlingly so at times, as in ""In mia man."" He phrases nicely while pushing his bright tenor hard. Registers are not well integrated, and the top sounds to belong to a different voice, highest notes abruptly jammed in, stabbed at.

Recommendable? Well, it is entertaining in its fashion. It is also wrongheaded, and inasmuch as the three principals have their strengths, they do not seem me to be the right ones for confronting this music. If I did not have as strong reaction against it as you may expect, maybe that is just the tale of a decade of opera productions since 2005 wearing me down. If you can watch this without getting angry at it, it might be a pleasant way to pass a few hours. I may even watch it again. But it will be the NORMA of no one's dreams, other than perhaps Guy Joosten's.",1475712000,,9142,4.670807453416149

8140094,1,B000HKDB36,"Bellini's Norma is set in ancient Rome, which carries druids and centurions. The struggle between love (family) and religious obligation (state) are central issues. Time and space are well defined.

In reading nutty Guy Joosten, the story takes place in the U.S. of 40 years. Nothing against the transposition of time. Many directors did it masterfully. But the buddy is lost, its reading of the work shown wrong in every way.

Standard is met with flashes, like a movie star. Transforms the story into a plot of American film cheap. Both compete for Pollione in a production of Norma (I think you get the idea). Moves the end of opera. Norma has the arms and live happily ever after with his beloved while the choir sings the sadness of his departure.

The soloist are median and lost in the confusion created by re-reading of the director. The orchestration is normal. Ridiculous costumes and scenery. The label Opus Arte always very quality, this time missed ugly.

People, Shelves in them. This deserves to be buried under the sacred tree druid

Prateleira Neles:Gravaes que merecem ficar mofando na prateleira

Norma de Bellini se passa na Roma Antiga, onde circulam druidas e centuries . A luta entre o amor (individual) e a obrigao religiosa (Estado) so questes centrais. Tempo e espao esto bem definidos.

Na leitura amalucada de Guy Joosten, a histria se passa nos EUA dos anos 40. Nada contra a transposio de tempo. Muitos diretores fizeram isso com maestria. Mas o amigo se perdeu, sua leitura da obra se mostra errada em todos os sentidos.

Norma  recebida com flashes, como se fosse uma estrela de cinema. Transforma a histria em um enredo de filme americano barato. Ambas competem por Pollione em uma produo de Norma( Acho que deu pra entender).Muda-se o final de pera. Norma acaba nos braos e viver feliz para sempre com seu amado enquanto o coro canta a tristeza de sua partida.

Os solista so medianos e se perdem na confuso criada pela re-leitura do diretor. A orquestrao  normal. Figurinos e cenrios ridculos. O selo Opus Arte sempre primou pela qualidade, dessa vez errou feio.

Amigos, Prateleira Neles. Esse merece ser enterrado embaixo da rvore sagrada druida.",1264982400,,2183,4.8861788617886175
