8641862,4,B00IFE97DY,"Act 2 is not quite as varied as the first collection of UVERworld music videos. The reason for this is that the band has unfortunately been on a kick where they love the idea of the ""live at Avaco studio"" video - and with a couple of exceptions, that's where ALL of these videos were filmed. The fan base by now is a little impatient/resigned at the thought of yet another UVERworld-in-a-circle in a big/small room video, but what can you do...

Having said that, I still feel this DVD is a should-have for UVERfans.  I was half afraid that seeing the Avaco videos all together in a collection might get old very quickly, and I was WRONG.  A fair amount of effort has gone into making these unique by virtue of lighting, presentation, props, choice of studio room, etc.

Anyone who has the LE version of The ONE cd album also got the first group of Avaco PV's as a bonus, so there is some repetition there.

Also included on this DVD are the videos that were done for Sora and =, which haven't been seen in years, and these are a very nice addition.  In addition to all this, there are short ""making of"" films of many of the videos.  The menu for this is a little confusing since these are in the same order as the videos themselves, and at first glance you think you've just gone in a circle in the menu. Not so. At the end of the videos, keep pressing ""next"" and you'll get to them.

If you haven't seen the vids for REVERSI or Wizard Club, they are some of the best. My only wish for this collection was that the live video of ""massive"" had been included, since it features a number of split views where cameras were attached to the guitars and bass.

Here are the videos. I've asterisked* the ones at Avaco.
