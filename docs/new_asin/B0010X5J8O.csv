A lot of scenes of just wandering down dark hallways and wandering in the woods with Scriabin's music playing as background... like the producer wanted it to be some sort of horror flick.  There are scenes of rooms and paintings, but we're never told if these belong to Scriabin, or are just settings that meet the horror flick theme.  They also refer to Alexander Scriabin's son as his ""brother,"" so I'm uncertain how many of the other facts they lay out in this very short biography are actually true.  We see a pair of plastered hands, but are these of Scriabin's hands?  Who knows and at this point, it would seem who cares.  The only thing that might save this from total obscurity might be the few pictures they show of Scriabin, his wife Vera and mistress Tatiana, some of which may be difficult to come across.  For it's viewing enjoyment, however, I would definitely say this is one to pass up.",1207872000,5,1025,4.5683060109289615

Like Mussorgsky, he had a musically-talented mother.  Like the Beatles, he looked to India for inspiration or repose.  His hand was broken at one time and it was questioned whether he could ever perform again.  This reminded me of Denzel Washington's character in ""Mo' Better Blues"" got his lip busted and couldn't play his trumpet anymore.  Though Scriabin lived into part of the 1910s, the work never mentions World War II or the Bolshevik Revolution.

This work is dark.  It has pencil drawings and black-and-white photos.  There were no colored images of modern Russia or the former Soviet Union.  Even B&W stock footage was chosen for some scenes.  The work has long musical interludes, but the titles of works and their level of popularity is never stated.  They show a painting of Chopin and a huge amount of time lapses before the narrator says, ""Scriabin was deemed the Chopin of Russia.""",1205193600,3,1054,4.826815642458101
