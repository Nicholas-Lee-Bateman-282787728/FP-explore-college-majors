4860715,1,B005R08HMQ,"I can not say how disappointed I was with both Bruce Willis and Forrest Whittaker.  Willis (my hero) has, basically, two short cameo appearances. I have to presume he needed the money. Whittaker's character was not interesting or intriguing at all. This movie is a total bust. I felt like I had wasted 90+ minutes of my life.

4860720,1,B005R08HMQ,"Bruce Willis is my favorite actor hands down but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Bruce and Forest Whitaker both do an excellent job with their characters but I'm still trying to figure out how they possibly read the script and said ""SIGN ME UP! I'd like to do that movie""?

Meet a trucker at a restaurant and take the truck from him. Things do not go as planned and secrets begin to come out, as well as bullets. This movie was a surprise. After watching ""Set-up"" with Bruce Willis (who was in it for about 5 minutes) I was skeptical. While he is not the main star in this one either this one actually is a pretty good movie. This movie reminded me a lot of ""Pulp Fiction"" in the way that it jumps back and forth all the time until you have every part of the story. Akerman and Whitaker do a great job in this and for someone like Malin Akerman to take a role in an action movie and pull it off as good as she does is also a surprise. While not a top notch action movie this one is still very much worth while and will not let you down. Overall, a very good movie that is well worth your time. I give it a B+.",1322956800,21,994,4.025252525252525
4860722,3,B005R08HMQ,"The title ""Catch .44"" appears to be some clever play on the phrase Catch 22, i.e. as in a double catch 22 as well as a .44 caliber bullet. The movie really isn't that clever, but pretends to be. I was confused by the beginning. The film opens with Bruce Willis (Mel) talking to an unseen person who he has worked with for seven years but doesn't trust...cue credits. The music is Mexican-Cowboy grindhouse stuff during the credits. We see Tes driving...Then we see three women in a diner, they are talking about living in a man's world , the apparent theme of the film, when they attempt to rob the place and one of them gets shot...more credits and the music is ""Fox on the Run."" We have ventured into some kind of ""Pulp Fiction"" diner scene flashback scenario. The names on the girls flash on the screen by their face, which has come to be the rule rather than the exception in modern action films.

Tes, the leader of the group, works at an exotic dance bar. They work for a drug dealer named Mel. The whole diner scene we saw earlier is about a drug deal. While there are cell phones, Mel talks on a red rotary dial phone to Tes in a remote phone booth, apparently something that still exists in Louisiana.
While the girls are driving to the restaurant, there is some subplot action that is going on that appears unrelated.

The movie swaps back and forth between the restaurant shoot-out action and various flashbacks leading up to the scene. The film is supposed to be a Tarantino style grindhouse, but doesn't really work that well as the characters aren't that great. There is no clever grindhouse dialouge. The flashback scenes don't work that well. Forest Whitaker uses different accents during the movie which doesn't appear to be by design. The movie lacked great action.

4860723,2,B005R08HMQ,"This movie was briefly, and i do mean briefly, available on PSN, as a see it before it hits theaters. Oddly enough, it comes out on DVD about 11 days after the theatrical release. I'm confused. This is another train wreck of a film, much like Trespass with Nick Cage and Nicole Kidman. Only this time we have Bruce Willis as a head con man, Forest Whitaker as another con artist/killer, and Malin Akerman whom i only know from 27 dresses. Two big name stars, one an Oscar winner, the other an action icon. This is Bruces second ""stinker"" straight to DVD (the first being Setup), and now Forest has jumped on board?!! Come on. This movie takes itself to seriously and can't decide whether it wants to be a dark comedy, drama, or crime action thriller. It succeeds at being none of the above. Just feels that the story was thrown together in 10 minutes, the script seems to be read line by line, and the plot is just plain stupid. Although it tries to be clever. I give up on most of the stars i grew up with. I love all of the ones i listed and can't figure out ""why"" their movies are being snuffed out. I really have nothing else to say about this film, so as not to spoil it. But it's just more gun play, drugs, sex, and cursing, thrown together for a quick flick. Believe me, most of the films on PSN, or Xbox 360 that say see it before it hits theaters. There is a reason for that. :) 88% of fans want to see it according to Rotten Tomatoes, that will be a LOT of disappointed folks.

Btw:Bruces character ""Mel"" may remind you of the similar part he played in The Whole Nine Yards, but don't let this fool you. It's not even close to that. Also he looks horrid, like he lost about 50lbs. Lets hope he picks up at the box office before the end of 2012. :d",1322697600,12,1757,4.182890855457227

4860754,3,B005R08HMQ,"Catch 44(released Dec/11)stars Bruce Willis as Mel,Forest Whitaker as Ronny,Malin kerman as Tes,Deborah Ann Woll as Dawn,Nikki Reed as Kara,and others in this tight little mix-it-up filmed in Louisiana. The film certainly betrays its low budget roots(most of the action takes place in side somewhere;a definite sign),but the production staff ends up pulling off what I think is a decent enough thriller/drama within the confines of its restrictions.
The story involves the boss Bruce Willis and his right hand man Forest Whitaker. Malin is a waitress in a dump of a strip club Willis runs,and Whitaker has a crush on her. She had been angling for a chance to meet the head man and finally gets it. After the meeting Willis hires her to do jobs for him. Malin hires two other girls,Woll and Reed,as her assistants. They mess up one job and move on to an interception of some drug money at a remote diner. They sit in the diner and the rendezvous time comes and goes.
At just after 3AM they get up and hold at gunpoint all the patrons and demanding to know where the truck is. After the dust settles both of Malin`s associates are dead and she is in a Mexican standoff with the cook,who also happens to work for Willis. In walks Whitaker who has been prowling the town and its environs for the last few hours. He killed a cop and had been riding in his car. He also had pulled over Malin and her friends earlier,but she didn`t recognize him. It seems she only met Whitaker for about 15 minutes when he originally took her to see the boss many years before. Now Whitaker is telling Malin he loves her and wants her to shoot the cook. She balks once but finally gets up enough nerve to shoot. As she suddenly turns towards Whitaker(we saw that coming a mile away!),the camera pulls outside.
Later,Willis finally arrives and finds the diner littered with bodies. He sits down in a booth,loaded gun on the table,across from Whitaker,who is bleeding from his left ear area. The movie up to this point had been plot jumping;reach one stage,jump back to explain events up to that point,go ahead a bit more and jump back to explain that,and so on. Well,this is the place where the movie initially came in. Willis tells Whitaker a parable about Running Bear,then after all is said and done,he shoots him dead. Before he leaves he puts the song of Running Bear(Johnny Preston)on the jukebox. As Willis is about to exit he hears the click of a trigger and looks around. Malin is still alive,and she shoots him. The camera leaps outside to Willis` chauffeur who hears two shots ring out. As he gets out of the car,gun in hand,Malin is there to disarm him and off she rides with the drug money on the seat beside her.
Willis plays his part well,as does Whitaker,who plays a psychotic,with multiple personalities beautifully. Everyone else does a good job also on the acting front. The film itself is done well,but there is just nothing here to suggest the wow factor. It goes along at a good clip,is executed nicely,but I just couldn`t see anything else in it that would make me give it any more marks than I did.
Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extras are the trailer and some commentary.
All in all a decent enough thriller that is raised to a better level thanks to the performances of its main stars Willis and Whitaker. The rest of the cast does fine work also,but it isn`t enough to get this film any higher than 3 stars.",1355529600,,3462,4.549679487179487
4860755,2,B005R08HMQ,"This one is probably not worth your time. It begins with a scene of 4 girls in a country diner and escalates to a shooting scene.  It's a movie that jumps around in time a bit (back and forth to a certain shoot out scene.)  Everybody is a thief and a liar, trying to steal from each other and out to kill somebody.  Drugs and money are also involved.  Bruce Willis is some kind of crime lord and his part is really not very impressive.  The only one who really does a good job in the film is Forrest Whittaker.  He does an excellent job with his part in this lousy movie.

There is lots of blood, murder, foul language (""F"" every couple of words) and doublecross.  Unless you are seriously bored,don't waste your time with this movie.",1353801600,,734,4.268115942028985
4860756,1,B005R08HMQ,"Aaron Harvey, the writer and director of Catch .44 wants to be Quentin Tarantino so bad that he has transformed himself into a zeroxed black & white copy of the great man. Evident by this film, which barely was given a theatrical release last winter and is now out on DVD and blu-ray to sucker unsuspecting poor souls who are going to say, well it's got Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker in it, how bad can it be. Trust me, it can be bad, it can be real bad.

One of the executive producers is David Willis, can you guess who's brother this is. I suspect that David got on board this picture, and brother Bruce did him a solid by appearing in it, thus not only giving the movie credibility which it did not deserve, but also attracting other name actors. It should be noted though, that Willis is not the film's star despite what the marketing tries to convince you of, in fact, he has a rather small role. At least it can be said, he has the movie's best role, which still falls short of memorable.

Filled with lots of lackluster dialogue used in long uninteresting speeches, filtered with endless profanities, used by lowlife characters. This picture knows what it wants, to be a Tarantino film, just doesn't have the slightest  idea of how to achieve it. The movie begins in a diner, is filled with flashbacks, has grindhouse style cuts and fade-outs, and even goes for a cool/hip ironic post modern sense of humor, evident in a scene where characters listen to a old cassette tape of Bruce Willis music from the 80's, ho ho. Filled to the gills with unresolved loose ends and dead ends. If this is all too much for me to stand, and I have a pretty high tolerance for this sort of stuff, I really pity the poor soul that rents/buys this thing believing that, well it has Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker in it, how bad can it be.

We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.

The movie is about the lives of three female assassins: Tes, Dawn and Kara, who work for Mel who is a drug boss.

Mel tells them to intercept a truck driver who is distributing drugs from rival groups to a get together at night.

The women are there but the driver does not show up, they draw their weapons on the staff and customers and the plot takes a sudden turn as their drug boss had gotten them involved in what he said was ""one last job.""

A shootout brings these women into a bizarre situation that involves a psychotic hit man, a trucker and a delusional line cook. Not the best of films, not fast paced action, performances were not that great, but as usual Bruce Willis saves the day.",1346630400,,1097,4.47

4860763,3,B005R08HMQ,"There was so much to expect with Catch. 44 - especially with the likes of Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker as leads. And while Forest especially provides a convincing, if not disturbing portrayal, ultimately the weak script doesn't provide enough leeway for even these seasoned actors to overcome.

Throughout the movie, I kept waiting for that breakthrough moment where something deeper, more unusual emerged to bring the story tracks together. And, ultimately I was disappointed by a fairly simple plot, with a focus on high body counts and violence than any sort of depth of character. It's as if the filmmaker was trying to reach for a ""Pulp Fiction"" level of cult delivery, sadly missing in delivery.

So, that being said, if you're looking for a high-body-count movie with the guys, some brilliance from Forest Whitaker's disturbing portrayal, and nothing more than go for Catch. 44. Otherwise, move on, don't even look, you're going to be left disappointed.",1334102400,,964,5.094936708860759

4860766,2,B005R08HMQ,"Despite the overwhelmingly negative reviews it has garnered, there are two good things about ""Catch .44"": stylish photography and nice soundtrack music. As to the rest of the film, like storytelling, characters or acting, Aaron Harvey's crime thriller needs much improvement, or at least some originality.

The story is about three young women Tes (Malin Akerman), Kara (Nikki Reed) and Dawn (Deborah Ann Woll), sitting and chatting in a midnight diner. Apparently they are there for a ""job"" that is offered by someone named Mel, but their plans - whatever they are - go terribly wrong when someone gets shot.

Except the last part of someone being shot, this sounds pretty familiar. Those who remember Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer in ""Pulp Fiction"" (who doesn't?) know what I'm trying to say. Using flashbacks (or flashforwards), ""Catch .44"" will show us how Tess and her cohorts ended up getting into big trouble. Forest Whitaker and Bruce Willis also appear, though Willis's role (second-billed) is rather an extended cameo.

Like a puzzle, each piece of the fragmented storyline fits in the right place, but watching the process is not very interesting. What makes Tarantino's film a classic is missing here. The dialogue lacks wit and power. Characters are types and their motives do not convince. What happens to each character is predictable. What will Forest Whitaker's character do next? Who will get killed or survive? You can guess it pretty easily.",1333843200,,1459,5.096234309623431

None of the characters are likable and by the end, I wished they would all die. Also, for a short movie, it seems there were a few scenes just to stretch it out. For example showing the girls driving around with loud music and smoking.  10 seconds of that was enough to get the feel for the scene.  It seemed like it dragged on for 3-4 minutes. I fell asleep during part of one of those long drawn out scenes.

Dialogue heavy:  check
Colorful low-end characters:  check
Nonlinear plot:  check
Elements of 70s pop culture:  check
Quality:  NO NO NO!!!

If there's one thing I hate, it's ripoffs that don't credit the person/film being ripped off, but what I hate more is ripoffs that suck, like ""Avatar"" and ""Never Back Down"".  This movie lost me within the first 10 minutes, when we opened in some low-end greasy spoon out in the middle of nowhere with three part-time hitwomen discussing the nature of compromising in a relationship (could ""Reservoir Dogs"" be ripped off any more?) then turns into a robbery (shades of ""Pulp Fiction"", anyone?) and then we jump back in time to get to know the hitwomen a little better (""Reservoir Dogs"" again) and find out how they ended up there.

The only problem is that by this time I'm so past the point of caring about these characters is that now I'm counting the minutes until it's over; even the appearance of Forest Whitaker as a chameleon-like Spanish hitman (yeah, I'm scratching my head at that one) and Bruce Willis as a nut-munching mob boss suffering from 70s fashion sense can't raise my interest.

There's something about a drug deal or maybe a double cross that brought them all together, but by now I'm watching only to find out how it ends, which thankfully it does.  In the end, there are a lot of bodies and revelations and double crosses, but who cares?

The movie's main problem is that Willis is barely in the movie. His character is interesting, but you don't see enough of him to validate his presence on the cover of the DVD. This was obviously done to capitalize on his star power, but it's still annoying to see the studio exploit the people like this.

The film is violent, very violent. If that's what you want to see in a movie, then by all means give Catch .44 a shot. I'm not against violence in film, but I do like something with a bit more substance. Catch. 44 tries to be a Tarantino rip-off and it fails miserably in that regard. It's often slow, boring, and lacks enough substance to keep me interested.

I don't recommend Catch .44 to anyone unless all you want from a film is violence and hot women. It's obvious than Whitaker and Willis did this solely for the money. Even though you might be a fan, try not to reward what they've done here.",1331424000,,1184,4.372727272727273
4860775,1,B005R08HMQ,"Rebecca: This is so bad it's almost good.

Enid: This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again.

Aaron Harvey's ""Catch .44"" reminded me of Gary Lennon's horrible 2007 opus "".45""  and reinforced the notion that any movie that includes the diameter of a gun barrel in its title is something to avoid.  Whereas Lennon's gimmick was unconvincing moronic violence spliced between segments of documentary style parody, Harvey relies on unconvincing moronic violence spliced into a scrambled timeline.  ""Catch .44"" might be dumb-downed relative to "".45"" but it does have better lighting and color.

While not quite a constant 94-minute mockfest moment, there is much unintended humor in observing how obviously close-to-laughter Forest Whitaker and Malin Akerman are as they desperately struggle to keep straight faces while dealing with Harvey's silly dialogue and inept acting for the camera direction.

In the now de rigueur tradition of recent ill-advised attempts at cinema, the director and his editor inflict a pretentious commentary on anyone masochistic enough to select the audio commentary option on the DVD menu. In this the delusional writer/director appears to sincerely believe that he has made a cutting edge film.

Even a casual viewer can see that this thing failed before it got out of the starting gate because of Harvey's second rate work in pre-production.  The obvious question being; why don't these direct-to-video geniuses use some of their budget to hire competent re-writing staffs before taking the project into production?

Unfortunately, even if you are able to suspend disbelief enough to self-knowingly go with this thing (a well-practiced skill for anyone who watches student films); it never engages.  There is simply no flow, fun, suspense, or surprises in this grim and overwrought melodrama, and Harvey appears to have forgotten to include a climax.  Flow is an especially difficult dynamic to get right in a scrambled timeline story and Harvey and his editor are simply not skilled enough to effectively manage the task.

The movie might have worked if released as a parody of a Russ Meyer film, if forced to view it again I would pretend that it was.

I do agree that the scene where the two guys and the gal are trying to figure out who shoots who was a little bit cheesy but going back to earlier times helped hold it together to make it at least palatable.

Forrest and Bruce are nut cases and so are the girls.........its entertainment, I don't care so much for realistic or probable just something to keep my mind numb for 120 minutes or whatever it was.

It is supposed to be some sort of heist where three girlfriends team up to be gun wielding tough girls handling transaction of the drug money.  There are reference to Bruce Willis (who happens to play a role in this movie) and his movies form the 80s.  I guess it is supposed to be a nostalgic backdrop to the fact that three leading female actresses were probably born in 80s when Bruce Willis was making it big in the action movies.

There is a lot of story telling and joke telling in this movie.  It is a futile attempt to get action moving from one point to another.  Bruce Willis' performance is his typical role: self-centered bad guy with plenty of female companions that are in his company for one purpose only (I will let you guess which one).  It is Forest Whitaker that give an amazing performance in this movie.  He plays delusional psychopath who can do many accents and even perform some impressive stuttering impressions.

In any case, if you are in the mood for goof ball movie with some recognizable (actor) faces, lots of shooting and funny comebacks, this is a perfect movie.  Otherwise, do not waste your time and money.  It is a low budget, ""let's fill our time with an easy project"" kind of a movie.",1330300800,,1272,4.439655172413793

The audio is English Dolby Digital 5.1.  The SETUP allows you to choose AUDIO COMMENTARY with the director and editor.  The SUBTITLES options are ENGLISH or SPANISH.  There are no SPECIAL FEATURES.

Bruce Willis has a total screen time of about 7 minutes, Forest Whitaker about 25 minutes, and Malin Akerman about 75 of the 90 minutes.  The Bruce Willis character isn't interesting, but Bruce does a decent job with his performance.  Forest Whitaker gives an interesting performance playing different personalities, but the characters are not intriguing or interesting.  Malin Akerman plays a tougher character, but her character isn't someone worth caring about.  This film felt more like a fun exercise for these actors. None of the performances are memorable, and neither is the film. The film starts to get somewhat interesting about halfway through.  Too many boring or slow scenes. The story is simple, but quite average, scoring a rating of 2.5 out of 5.

As for the cinematography, the camera work is also average with a few decent and great frames, but most of the film's composition is just plain.  A lot of dark and yellow tinted scenes. The film's look is grainy at times, and it does help the atmosphere of the film.  As for the music, the particular rock music chosen just doesn't fit with most of the scenes.  It sounds okay for two or three, but it really doesn't help the film at all.

I'm not sure why Bruce Willis would have signed on for this (much less why he is on the cover--his role is quite limited), much less Forrest Whittaker.  I guess the script must have looked like it had some promise.  Ultimately, this film is very dark, takes a while to get going, and then substitutes painful amounts of violence and some ""edgy"" time cutting for an actual plot.  Unfortunately, the ""cut back and forth"" thing has been done a lot, and doing it originally or in your own voice is harder and harder to do.  Here, it seems to echo a lot of the action films told in similar ways.  Some folks have referenced Tarantino, and I think that that is a pretty good reference.  Tarantino's insistence on comic book violence also comes through here.  Anyway, on the bright side, Ackerman is actually effective as an action heroine, and I just wish she had more to work with.  I'll recap the plot, but it is kind of beside the point--Ackerman and co need to wrangle a truck away from its driver at an out of the way diner.  The truck is supposed to be filled with goodies (drugs/money).  A simple plan, but we all know that simple plans never go according to plan.  Forrest Whittaker plays a sheriff (sort of, don't want to give away the thin plot) and...well, hilarity ensues.  Ok, not hilarity.  Shooting.

The plot is along these lines. Willis' character is a quirky drug dealer with some hot accomplices (actresses Nikki Reed, Deborah Ann Woll, and Malin Akerman) who have to go out of town to make a big score. The movie starts at the end and is told through flashbacks, so viewers know this scheme is not going to go well.

There is nothing wrong with this Pulp Fiction-esque storytelling and plotting, except well, Catch .44 is fairly obviously trying to do what Pulp Fiction did. In terms of characters, plot, dialog, and camera work, Pulp Fiction did it first and did it better.

Viewers who want to see Bruce Willis play a good role and have some bloody/action-y fun will probably enjoy Catch .44.  But if you compare Catch .44 to other movies of the genre it comes off just ok.

Of course there is a lot of girl talk about their mission, an interruption by a madman Ronny (Forest Whitaker) who earlier has murdered a sheriff and poses then as the sheriff to add to the mess. At the diner things just progress from bad to unbelievable, as nearly everyone is brutally murdered and it all ends in a reduced cast (many are dead by now) cat and mouse game that is as dull as yesterday's lunch.
There are some night at the gas station scenes a la Ed Ruscha by cinematographer Jeff Cutter that are artsy, but the rest of the film is a waste of talent.

No real saving graces to this film.  Grady Harp, December 11",1324857600,16,1556,4.5321428571428575
4860802,2,B005R08HMQ,This movie looked like it was trying to be a Pulp Fiction imitator but failed miserably. Not the worst movie I've seen and nowhere near the best. Oh well live and learn!,1324771200,,169,4.3125
4860803,1,B005R08HMQ,"Revember when Pulp Fiction, Memento and even 21 Grams came out and challenged the audience to rethink how movies could be done. They can be done backwards, they can be done out of order or they just didn't have to be so straight forward. In all three of those movies, the way the story was told added to the movie. They were unique and challenging. CATCH .44 appears to be doing the same thing, but for different reasons. CATCH .44 is doing it because they wanted to.

There is no reason to tell this movie out of order. Personally, I find it hard to believe and painful to watch as three people in a restaurant hold guns on each other, sweating with intensity, scared that the other is going to open fire, but telling each other stories as to how they each arrived at their locations. For ten minutes, guns are trained, stories are being told. I wanted somebody to just pull the trigger, right in the middle of those stories and then turn the guns on themselves.

CATCH .44 is a jumbled hodge podge of who really cares stories as to who is loyal to who and who made deals with who and they all would have faired better had we just seen the whole thing played out in real time, instead of seeing the bloody aftermath in the beginning and then again with a little bit more revealed, and then again with even more revealed and so on.

It's a bad movie, and there's a reason why a movie that learned it's technique from gems like Pulp & Memento, and has Forrest Whitaker and Bruce Willis, went straight to video. It's bad and is just a pretender in its artistic attempts.",1324771200,2,1568,4.3447098976109215
4860804,2,B005R08HMQ,"Been 20 years since 'Pulp Fiction' and still some filmmakers *have* to try their hand at their version. We need to be honest: The 99% Fail Rate for plagiarism is something that needs to be beat into this new generation of filmmakers, actors and producers. S-T-O-P. If we don't, we'll keep seeing this kind of dung being pooped out forever because they're not receiving honest critique. False compliments and unconditional love from family members is not an appropriate formula for film productions and cinephiles.

The unseemly addiction to Tarantino is sad and looks to yet infest another generation. The first step in rehab is admitting you have a problem.

But I give '.44' credit - this one has Bruce Willis in it. But ol' Bruce has been doing quite a number of pure money gigs the past couple of years. He's done a bunch of throwaway performances that I believe are setting up his retirement fund; a fruit orchard in the French countryside with his visiting grandkids.

I digress.

This film lacks any emotional content or context; one of those productions where every single character is intentionally worthless and unredeemable. There's no connection to be made when everyone is a pure unadulterated scumbag. In fact, the flick's would-be heroine is a slimy fast talking manipulator whose ability to steal is matched only by her apparent skill in smuggling cocaine. Again, that's the lead character. Yay?

The only interesting character of note, and he's no peach, is Forest Whitaker's mentally unstable hitman. But despite the amazing skill he showcases as an actor - it's not unique. We've all seen Forest 'do' crazy and off-kilter before. It's old hat for the artist and nothing that I would call attention to unless the film itself sucked.

And this film sucked.

Additionally, it would be an understatement to say that the script reads like a rip-off of every Tarantino-esque script, sans the cleverness or edged timing. One will never achieve success if all you do is ""homage"" other creators.

I suspect Writer/Director Aaron Harvey wanted this, in part, to be a female empowerment flick. But I'm not clear on how drafting the characters as completely worthless human beings as being empowering. Pure strength doesn't equate empowerment. That would be the moral equivalent of pointing out various dictators across the globe and saying that's the kind of behavior one should attempt to emulate since they're using pure strength for success.

Really?

Finally, it will be a day too late when young filmmakers finally stop using the stop-the-film-to-add-graphic-names/titles-to-the-characters. It was old and tired a decade ago. It definitely hasn't improved with age. Now it just looks tacky and weak. Again: S-T-O-P.

No surprise - this is Director Harvey's second feature film. His first? A slasher flick.

4860807,1,B005R08HMQ,"The overall storyline had some potential but failed due to really fragmented pieces amongst which was the scene of our three women holding up a diner which was repeated/looped so many times as the story progressed that it felt like it occupied half of the movie. The background of the girls provided almost zero insight into their characters other than they liked to argue over nothing which occupied another 25% of the movie. The final 25% was Willis, who this past decade or so is just stuck in a rut in repeating his patented, conditioned to sell but admittedly provides a great income for limited on-set time, bad-ass behavior that has gotten so old it feels like grandpa reliving his youthful fantasies.",1324684800,2,708,4.811475409836065
4860808,3,B005R08HMQ,"It's pretty obvious during the five minute conversation between the wanna-be Charlie's Angels (Tes, Kyla, and Dawn) that this movie desperately wants to be a Quentin Tarantino film.  Which was bad news for me because I don't really like Tarantino's films.  ""Reservoir Dogs"" is pretty good.  That's what this seems to aspire to, though it doesn't quite make it.

This is the kind of movie where a lot of it is told in flashback, but I'll give it to you in chronological order, without trying to spoil too many surprises.  As I said at the outset there are three young women Tes, Kyla, and Dawn.  The latter two we can forget about because they die in the first ten minutes of the movie.  Tes (Malin Ackerman) is a former strip club waitress/pickpocket who works for crime boss Mel (Bruce Willis) around the New Orleans area.  She and her crew are assigned to go to a diner in the middle of nowhere to intercept a drug shipment (or something).  The drugs/cash are the film's MacGuffin, the thing everyone is fighting over and yet they don't really matter.

But as we see early on things go wrong and Tes's underlings are killed.  There's a double-cross and then another double-cross and then another double-cross.  It'd take too long and spoil too much to say who all is double-crossing who.

Anyway, like the earlier ""Smokin' Aces"" this is a film by a Tarantino disciple that tries to mimic the master's work, but never quite gets there.  It's got a lot of the same pieces, but feels too derivative.  (Which is maybe why I never heard of it before it showed up on the Vine newsletter and was released on DVD.)  If you're a fan of double-crosses and gore then this is a good rental, but I wouldn't buy it.

BTW, like the earlier ""13"" I got from Vine the DVD includes no extras.  I don't know if the actual sale version does or not.  If it does I can't evaluate them since I couldn't see them.

That is all.",1324684800,2,1904,4.463768115942029
4860809,1,B005R08HMQ,I don't know how the director/producer conned such acting talent into doing this waste of time/money.  I paid $1 to rent it and still felt ripped off.

4860810,1,B005R08HMQ,"This has got to be one of the worst, most stupid and dull movies I have ever seen.  Three female killers are in a shoot-out in a diner.  The story goes back and forth but...there is NO STORY.  There is never any explanation for why they are there, how they are connected to each other, or what was supposed to happen.  The appearances of Bruce Willis and Forest Whittaker are little more than cameo appearances, especially Willis.  Their roles are as mysterious and meaningless as the three women's parts are.  It is quite obvious both Willis and Whittaker were simply involved to pick up some easy money with no real acting involvement.  Willis has done a few lousy movies like this lately, and I'm astounded he isn't worried about damaging his brand as an actor with tripe like this.

Do not waste your time or money watching this film.  There's a reason you never saw it advertised or shown in theaters.  It is garbage.",1324684800,,922,4.567073170731708
4860811,1,B005R08HMQ,This is one of the worst movies in a long time.  Basically just a whole movie of the F word and then shooting people.,1324598400,,117,3.875
4860812,2,B005R08HMQ,"Red flags started going off the moment I saw the movie box. First of all the title is too clever for its own good and really exists entirely BECAUSE someone thought it was clever. It has actors who've appeared in great movies but these same actors have appeared in terrible movies *cough* Battlefield Earth. It also uses the desperate, ""In the Tradition of..."" on the back of the box referencing several movies that Catch .44 is nothing like. The movie has one thing going for it, Forest Whitaker. I could watch Forest Whitaker knit a quilt and probably enjoy it. Unfortunately Forest talks with this bizarre Scarface accent that sounds increasingly silly as the movie progresses. The back of the box also advertises that it ""co-stars"" Academy Award nominee Brad Dourif who appears for about 2 minutes in a scene completely divorced from the rest of the movie.

The plot of the movie is pretty much irrelevant and the movie gives away the ending in the first 10 seconds. It's all just a vehicle for shooting and f-bomb dropping and the pivotal scene where Whitaker, Malin Akerman (Watchmen) and some other dude find themselves in a three way Mexican standoff with guns pointed at each other. This scene goes on FOREVER. I swear it's like 30 minutes of `drop your gun', `no YOU drop your gun', `no you drop YOUR gun'. There is rambling about money and drugs and setups but it's all so dull and tedious.

If I were not obligated to review this movie I would have quit early on. At the 20 minute mark I could not believe that it had only been 20 minutes. The movie is padded within an inch of its life and the dialogue is insufferable. With lines like, ""I'd say you got some BALLS, woman."" I often felt embarrassed for the veteran actors reading these lines. There is a lengthy scene at the end of the movie with Bruce Willis (looking very old) and Forest Whitaker (continuing to channel Scarface) that is PAINFUL to watch.

This movie is not a realization of anyone's vision. It's made strictly to part fans of mindless violence and gratuitous profanity from their money. There is a scene where Whitaker is in a cop car and hears a thump from the trunk. He opens the trunk and shoots a guy several times. Who is this guy? He can't be the cop because that guy got shot in the head. That's about as gratuitous as violence can get. Although with the utterly pointless scene with Dourif I have to wonder if this movie was dramatically cut down in which case I applaud the produces for sparing the viewers additional torture but it makes for an incoherent mess. Catch .44 reeks of desperation and has all the hallmarks of a straight to DVD movie. The last two straight to DVD movies I reviewed actually surprised me being better than anticipated but this one just exists for no good reason. Skip it.

BTW: I know that even good movies have been using CGI blood splatter but it REALLY looks stupid and cartoonish. I wasn't a fan of it in Kick Ass but at least that WAS a cartoonish movie but in a movie trying to be gritty it just looks ridiculous.",1324598400,3,3040,4.511796733212341

8483943,4,B005R08HMQ,"When I give this movie four stars, please understand that I am not saying that it is the least bit edifying. Even to call watching such stuff a guilty pleasure is a self-serving euphemism; the French know what it really is: nostalgie de la boue, nostalgia for the gutter, by which is meant a desire, a craving, for degradation and depravity. As addiction becomes more and more the metaphor for American life in the 21st century, we all crave as entertainment that which is brutal, senseless and amoral. Hollywood exploits this craving, of course, and Quentin Tarantino is its current El Chapo.

So here is my capsule review of Catch .44: the story at first appears intricate and seemingly senseless, which is accomplished mostly by Aaron Harveys scrambling of the sequential narrative, much as QT likes to do.  This technique makes a pretty threadbare story appear more complex and mysterious, because it forces the viewer to make sense of it, which would normally be the job of the writer-director. As with QT's scrambled narratives (ie, ""Pulp Fiction""), if the viewer manages to unscramble ""Catch .44,"" its narrative becomes more sensible, and also more pedestrian.  Forest Whitaker's character is a homicidal maniac, such as other homicidal maniacs would consider an imbecile. Bruce Willis's character chews pecans and spews lines befitting a genuine comic book boss of bosses. Both characters talk too much.  QTs movies have lots of flannel-mouthed homicidal sadists too, minus the pecans.  As for the girls, well, what can you expect from them?  Betty Boop pole-dancers who are supposed to be expert assassins  a downright banal vocational blending in a QT movie.  Harvey has also learned Quentin's first rule of bad plotting:  when the plot has backed the writer into a corner from which he cannot extricate himself, the next script direction should always be, and then they all get blasted by shotguns.  But hey, I don't want to spoil the ending for you.

I can't see why this movie has received so many bad reviews.  I'll bet that many of those who gave it one and two stars have given four and five stars to Quentin Tarantino's junkiest efforts.  As I have detailed in the previous paragraph, this movie is a flagrant knockoff of QT, but as such it is not half bad.  ""Catch .44"" is derivative, but Harvey is a competent mimic. Where's the love, people?  His ""la boue"" and Tarantino's are almost interchangeable:  is it possible you folks are slaves to name brands?

Truth is, I like this stuff.  I'll bet Stephen Hawking did too. What I don't like is the need of the grifterdom of Hollywood to conflate ""la boue"" with art.  After all, pornographers do that, and what has Hollywood to do with them?? (:D)  Purveyors of junk should accept that junk is what they purvey: no extravagant praise is due from critics, no lavish sphincter-smooching awards ceremonies, no presumptions that great works of cinematic art are afoot. ""Catch .44"" is junk for junk junkies, which is what all of us patrons of the arts really are these days. Overall, Harveys WWTD (What Would Tarantino Do?) template works about as well for him as it does for Tarantino.  There isn't much difference between them.  Junk gourmets like you & me could do worse than this derivative barrel of slaughterhouse droppings, and things being what they are, we probably will.",1521417600,,3340,4.874336283185841
