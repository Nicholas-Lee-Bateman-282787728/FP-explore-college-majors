2711126,3,B000LP5D4W,The little rascals are always fun to watch.  It's neat to see how these great works of art continue on.,1397433600,,103,4.15
2711127,5,B000LP5D4W,"I absolutely loved this too funny collection of shorts! Growing up I was always a big fan of The Little Rascals, so watching this DVD brought back the memories of coming home after school to oreos and milk and The Rascals! This is a wonderful DVD to share with your children too. It reminds us of a time where things were more innocent and simple. This release is a great example of classic comedy.",1396137600,,398,4.391891891891892
2711128,5,B000LP5D4W,Purchased this for my grandkids and it is one of the original Little Rascals . We have enjoyed it very much,1390953600,,107,4.142857142857143
2711129,4,B000LP5D4W,"We haven't watched this yet, but it came quickly, well packaged and is as described--I do not anticipate any problems.",1357084800,,118,4.95
2711130,5,B000LP5D4W,Loved seeing this version in color!  The picture was crisp and clear and in color.....how this brings back memories when I was a child I would watch the Little Rascals every Saturday morning.  It was such a delight to reminisce about the days of yore!,1355184000,,251,4.555555555555555
2711131,2,B000LP5D4W,"I was bummed. My disc was slightly damaged and skips. It didn't have the episode I really wanted, but I thought I would give it a shot. The episodes given are still funny but not a huge variety I should have purchased the complete set of Little Rascals. And I don't like the episodes in color. Why mess with a perfectly good thing?",1305244800,2,331,4.26984126984127
2711132,5,B000LP5D4W,"Even at 80-90 years old, they are timeless classics that never lose their luster. I remember watching these when I was a kid, and I still love them and not just as a walk down memory lane. They are great family views because everyone of all ages can enjoy them. It's sort of like Loony Tunes that way. That while it may have been written with kids in mind as the main audience, adults can certainly enjoy them too. It is a bit slapsticky at times, but the kids ""one-liners"" will never fail to put a smile on your face. I just wonder what they would have had to say if you told them at the time that people would still be watching them nearly a century later.",1267920000,2,658,4.1484375
2711133,5,B000LP5D4W,"""Superstars of Our Gang"" continues the line of colorized Little Rascals compilations from Legend Films as its third piece.  As I've detailed in my other reviews, these DVDs are an excellent resource for both the casual and hardcore Our Gang fan, because they've cherry-picked the very best episodes from the show's quite broad canon.

 In addition to the quality improvements inherent in DVD over pre-existing VHS, Legend has gone the Lucasfilm route and employed its advanced colorization technology to not only add color to existing film, but also to completely re-master the black and whites themselves, dramatically improving the visual quality from tapes you might've seen in childhood.  Yes, this disc contains both colorized episodes and black and white episodes, so you're free to take you pick based on personal preference.  Judging from my own experience, the younger generation is likely to be more receptive to the colorized episodes than to the black and whites, but at least this disc allows you flexibility either way, for substantially the same price as other Little Rascals incarnations.  Additionally, this DVD contains some harder-to-find material that is sure to delight the hardcore Rascals fan, including rare cuts from Rascals' appearances on other contemporary shows.",1227657600,14,1291,5.398009950248756
2711134,4,B000LP5D4W,"I give this only four stars because all of these have already appeared on DVD, restored from 35mm, so there is little new here.

It seems that kids don't like to watch B&W movies, so lets COLORIZE The Little Rascals/Our Gang! But purists can also watch them in their original B&W, which is good since the colorization looks cartoony & unnatural.

If you don't have the old CABIN FEVER DVDs you may want to build up your Little Rascals collection with these.  Hallmark seems to be taking their time releasing their DVDs.

I just could not pass up the extras that are included on these DVDs.

SUPERSTARS OF OUR GANG has
The Jackie Cooper go-cart race with The Marx Brothers,
Our Gang old & new FOX Movietone Newsreel clip from about 1936, probably during the filming of 'Reunion In Rythm'.
""Little Rascals Follies"" preview trailer from the 1950's Allied Artists re-issue.
Clip of Alfalfa's appearance on ""The Roy Rogers Show"".

Oh, yes.. there are the comedy shorts.  These are all from 35mm 1950's RE-ISSUE PRINTS, not the same MGM transfers as the Cabin Fever / Hallmark DVDs.  But they are 35mm prints and they look very good.  There is a variety of title sections representing almost every company that re-issued these shorts in 35mm, including Official Films which I never knew made 35mm prints.

SUPERSTARS OF OUR GANG
""SCHOOL'S OUT"" - MGM Our Gang titles minus the roaring lion. This was one of my favorites as a kid, but it has trouble holding up today. Basically the teacher Miss Crabtree would be in jail for what she does.
  1) When Joe Cobb says he can't sit down in the car because his father gave him a wipping with the shaving belt, Miss Crabtree just laughs. Today she would have to report this child abuse.
  2) Since Joe can not sit down, Miss Crabtree allows him to hang on to the side of the car as she drives to the schoolhouse. What state would allow this today? The police would certainly stop her for this.
  3) During school recess, Miss Crabtree leaves the children at the schoolhouse, unsupervised, while she goes into town. Allowing a stranger to enter the schoolhouse and ask the kids about her.  Imagine the lawsuite this would bring today.  This would be child endangerment and she would be out of a job.
  4) There are also the usual black jokes prevelent at this time. Farina talks of how his mom keeps marrying men so much that it has gotten to be a habit.
  Times have changed alot since this short was made, and it is most evident in this one.  You can enjoy it if you remember that this is not happening now. It took place over 75 years ago when life was a bit more simpler, safer, cars did not travel very fast, and wippings were more standard with families that remembered the ways of 'the old country' they came from.

""FREE WHEELIN'"" - Official 'Famous Kids' titles - Stymie runs a TAXI service with Spanky as his #1 rider.  They try to help a sick rich kid with a stiff neck, who just seems to be sick of being a shut-in rich kid.

""FOR PETE'S SAKE"" - Interstate Television titles (the title card looks like 16mm, but the credits & short are 35mm)- The Gang tries to raise money to buy a little girl a doll. After some comic failures they try trading Pete the Pup to the store owner for the doll.

""DIVOT DIGGERS"" - Allied Artists titles - The gang invades a golf course. This timeless tale is as funny today as it was 75 years ago. Possibly the best in this set.

""WALDO'S LAST STAND"" (only non-Roach comedy here) - MGM Our Gang titles minus the roaring lion.  Made after Hal Roach sold the series to MGM, this is more of a musical comedy with polished acting.  Still enjoyable, and an example of how the series turned out.

The shorts are offered in both Colorized & original B&W restored versions, but switching back & forth while playing the short is not possible.  The bonus material is B&W only.",1170979200,5,3841,4.474137931034483
