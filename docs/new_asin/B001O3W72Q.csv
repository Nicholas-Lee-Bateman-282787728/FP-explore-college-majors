8329211,2,B001O3W72Q,"The movie was quite disappointing - I wouldn't watch it twice and would not recommend it to my friends. The plot is rather weak and the acting was flat. There were attempts at comedy but they were not well executed so the humour was lost. Also, I think the lesson that it's not right for a guy to date two girls at the same time didn't come through - the criticism was more on the girls for wanting the same man. At the end, the message about acts of righteousness needing to be done selflessly was good but came too late - I had already mentally switched off and was just waiting for the movie to end.",1330905600,2,602,4.153846153846154
