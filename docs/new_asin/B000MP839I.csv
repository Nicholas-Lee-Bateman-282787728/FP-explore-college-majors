8170462,4,B000MP839I,"First, longer, epsiode from '53 is a New Year's Eve show with the main players and a guest shot for Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. But there's more: we are treated to a huge night club set, and a big chunk of the Dorsey ""set"", all live on kinescope. A sensational take of ""Marie"" is featured.

This is not the Honeymooners of the ""Classic 39"", which had absolutely no ""show-biz"" themes, and stuck to 328 Chauncy Street. It's one of the best of the long sketches, but suffers somewhat from the predictable plotline.

The later episode is ""post-'39'"" and is fascinating to watch, as the set is strictly the Kramden kitchen/living room, with the same accoutrements as the filmed shows (though we are back to the Ed Sullivan theatre and away from the Adelphi). Some of the spirit of the ""39"" is lost, however, and the wrap-up is very disappointing.",1277596800,2,837,4.610738255033557
