341895,1,6301670167,The video does make a mistake in caying that Muhammad learnt religion from christians and jews. It does go into history of islam and the caliphates. A good intro to the topic. The prophet Mohamed Peace upon to him didn't learn from Jews and Christians; Jews and christians of his Time didn't say anything. This video is propaganda of Jews and christians.,996451200,34,354,4.725806451612903
341896,4,6301670167,"This video is a very good video, providing a good historical framework of the religion. Though the video is dated and is obviously a remake of 1970's film, it still provides a wonderful explaination of Islamic  history.
Though it occassionally gives inaccurate information, (ie  claiming Prophet Muhammad learned about Monotheism from Christians and Jews  during his travels) the inaccurancies are not as significant as the  information it does give about ISLAM.
Since it is a Western based  historical account, the video holds some Eruo-centric assumptions, but is a  wonderful example worthy of being an introduction to non-Muslims, since it  is not published by Muslims, but rather non-Muslims.
I was quite  surprised by it's depth since it went way beyond the Arab cultures. I  encourage others to consider this video in their resource library.",947548800,35,848,5.315789473684211

7813581,1,6301670167,"The worst documentary I have ever watched!
Besides the fact that it's dated, all it does is glorify the, expansionist, movement of the islamic people across the world. This is the same thing Alexander the Great did, the Romans, the Mongols, etc.  The biggest difference seemed to be the islams said it was in the name of their God. Everyone else at least admitted it was for power, and conquest.
There was very little information about the islamic faith.
A complete waste of time.",1362787200,3,480,4.714285714285714
7813582,5,6301670167,"I found this to be a lively, informative, reflective and carefully constructed documentary on Islam.  I am planning to use it in a college world history course I teach.  All but one of the reviewers slams it for not being the kind of film that THEY would have made on this controversial topic. One reviewer was a middle school teacher disappointed that the material didn't fly with her 6th graders.  The contradictions in the other reviews are breathtaking.  One Israeli saw it as pro-Islamic propaganda.  The others, clearly Muslim fundamentalists, attacked the film because it didn't present their picture of Islam. If you don't share the concerns of these reviewers, buy this video; you'll probably like it.",1288224000,2,710,5.034188034188034
7813583,1,6301670167,"Not really what I was looking for. I'm sure that in it's time it was a Master piece, but, now a days we just need more info.",1287014400,,124,3.6296296296296298
7813584,2,6301670167,"I had flashbacks of school where the teacher would turn the lights out, the reels would start spinning and you know you're just minutes away from dreamland. This video was made in the 70s and although it was probably pretty good at the time...it definetly looks dated! I think the info is probably still accurate, but it didn't keep my attention...I still haven't finished it?!",1217203200,7,377,4.815384615384615
7813585,2,6301670167,"I'm not Muslim, and don't know as much about Islam as other reviews seem to.  What I do know is that this is not a very interesting video.  I got it to use with 6th graders studying the origins of Islam.  I found only about a 7 minute segment which was usable in a classroom setting.  The rest was very tedious and just plain boring.  (I usually show 15-25 minutes of documentary video, which is all that holds their attention at that age.  But it was hard to get then to sit through just 7 minutes of this.) I got rid of it after using it one year, and have ordered a PBS video on Islam which will hopefully work out better.",1092700800,19,625,4.081967213114754
7813586,1,6301670167,"The video is a sole propaganda  against Islam by the producton house which made it.
They don't even admit that Muhammad ( Peace be upon Him ) was a prophet.
Its totally baseless and useless effort. looks like a work of fiction then history.",1076371200,20,240,4.454545454545454
7813587,1,6301670167,"This is not recommended to anybody wants to know the true history of Islam with an open mind. Prophet Mohammed was an illeterate which is endorsed by all the historical facts - there is no contradiction about this. There is no way that he read the bible or anyother holy book as he was illiterate. This is a propaganda film to tarnish Islam, the only true religion of God, through media. God will surely punish whoever tarnish a true religion with all the misleading facts.",1073347200,14,473,4.576470588235294
7813588,2,6301670167,"This pro-Islamic western account does not do Islam Justice.  It doesnt examine the inner meaning of the Koran nor does it look at the true similarities between Judaism and Islam, namely burial practices, circumcision, diet and dress.
Unfortunatly the film is meant to be viewed by westerners who want to convert, it is not an objective account of a religion that totally mystifies so many.
Probably the only accurate part of the documentary is the fact that Mohomed learned religion from the Jews and Christians.  Mohomed set down to create the Koran as a new new testament, building on the flaws he saw in the Jewish and Christian Faiths.  THis movie explains how his intractions with Jewish and Christian tribes heped him form a theology that married both(incorporating the life of jesus but the laws of Judaism).
Unfortunatly the documentary leaves out some essential history of Islam.  It doesnt discuss the controverisal elements of the Koran that command men to 'Jihad' and the parts of the Koran that are sued to justify the suppression of women.  It doesnt shed light on the enslavemend and killing of non-Muslims.
All in all this documentary lake almost all the ones that you can find is biased and not accurate, better to go buy some books on the subject.",1067385600,13,1265,4.865116279069768
