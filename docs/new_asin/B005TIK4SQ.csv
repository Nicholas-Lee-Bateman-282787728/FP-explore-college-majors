4890865,5,B005TIK4SQ,"In a clever move the writers and directors of this film start with a lovely innuendo in the title and deliver on this promise in the end scene with plenty of bedroom buffering....

Nicely and deftly done, in a none smutty way taking a look at the phenomenon of people making amateur porn and selling it on line....in this case to make ends meet and save their home from repossession. It's part of the zeitgeist and everyday life and why not shine a spotlight on it in an entertaining way...which this film does.

The whole concept has a neat timing giving the world wide recession and economic turmoil but it doesn't preach - it entertains and moves swiftly as a film. A great soundtrack thrown in to boot as well as some buff boys, a crazy sex shop owner and some clever wordplay.  It's more of a dramedy than a comedy but that's no bad thing.

As you count the bills from christmas have this playing in the background...it will raise a smile and a giggle guaranteed..

4890866,2,B005TIK4SQ,"Good story, pretty good acting and production values. But adding straight sex scenes into a gay film ruined this one for me. That's not what I want to see, it just grossed me out!",1324684800,23,179,4.294117647058823
4890867,4,B005TIK4SQ,"Buffering is a British gay sex comedy, that has far more sex than comedy. This isn't entirely a bad thing, because it is sexy. Just don't expect near as many laugh out loud moments as there were in gay sex comedies like Another Gay Movie and the Eating Out series. And in Buffering, the best is saved for last. The foursome that concludes the film is hot and contains some full frontal nudity. And the soundtrack consists mostly of catchy dance-pop. Worth watching.",1323734400,42,465,4.614457831325301
4890868,2,B005TIK4SQ,"I must admit that I had read those two very positive reviews (posted on Amazon.co.uk) before I decided to watch ""Buffering"". Full of enthusiasm I pressed the play button and?
The plot is as simple as every teen comedy, so don't expect too much. In this case we have two gays, no cash, but a cam and LAN and a lot of energy to burn in bed. I spare you details.
Jokes? Well, they circulate around one subject (sex) and aren't particularly elaborated.
Acting - so so. I liked the girl. The owner of sex-shop seemed the most experienced of all.

In my opinion it's one of those films, that viewers will fall in love with or loathe it.

If I had paid closer attention, I would have seen it was made by the same people that did ""Shank"" and ""Release"", both of which were mediocre at best. This one was even worse.

4890885,2,B005TIK4SQ,"Just finished watching ""Buffering.""
""Buffering"" could have been a great sex farce in the Benny Hill tradition.  Yet, it's a pleasant movie about  Seb and Aaron; twon under-and-unemployed blokes, who hit the sheets as Internet sex performers to pay the bills. Add their lady friend who pretends she's a gay guy; and the straight, but progressive guy next door into this mix and you could have had one hoot nanny of comedic potential.
Still, ""Buffering"" does have its moments - sadly thought, only a few.
Recommended only if you need a mild amusing video to pass some time away.
Two-and-a-half stars.",1396742400,,598,4.910891089108911

Of course, even Z&M's porno had a gay segment, but I still see where ""Buffering"" is coming from. Not a particularly BAD idea, but not a really ORIGINAL idea either. (I'm not even saying that Z&M was the first 'porn for rent' movie either). It caught MY interest, and it IS a good fun/watch with friends movie.

4890899,3,B005TIK4SQ,"The cheesy title and photo picture made me think this was not going to be very well done. If all you have going for you is three naked guys, then buyer beware. But the characters were fun and there are some nice visual touches - especially sight gags referring to other (and better) movies made by this team (Release,etc). The addition of the woman is interesting. Time spent with the guy next door (as opposed to the dumb scenes in the sex shop - really, open mic afternoon with a live band in a sex shop?) would have made his joining the party more intriguing.

4890908,5,B005TIK4SQ,"I thought this was a fun movie for a rainy day rental on Amazon.  I also think it's interesting that it has a character who is a female-to-male-trans-identifying-gay-male...which is more common than most people know.  This is a female who wants to be a male and date other males...and I happen to know three people like this in real life, but this is the first time that I've ever seen this depicted in a movie.

I think this is a fun look at the rise of amateur porn in recent years.  I don't know of another movie that covers the fact that a lot of people in real life are turning to make a few bucks on the side by putting their home adult movies on the net.  That's happening, and it's not going to stop soon, but this is the first movie I've ever seen that showed any of that.

For a gay movie, the story was pretty good and the characters felt real.  I have no idea where in England this movie is set but it's also always fun to see British cities and get a little ""tour"" of a new area by way of a film.",1356912000,,1009,4.040201005025126

So nice to see a gay-themed movie rise above the mediocrity that is so pervasive in gay offerings available from Netflix.  Thank you, Amazon!  The writing was humorous, not gut-busting funny.  The four principal actors are likable and believable, oh and did i mention all very attractive? The standout performance came from the gorgeous and dumb-as-a-door-knob-next-door neighbor. That actor easily had the best comedic lines and comedy timing among the four principal cast members. The sole female among the four principals was as lovely and talented as her male costars.  Her talent for understated physical comedy was impressively subtle.",1351641600,,754,5.410256410256411

The committed and comfortable connection between the leads was a perfect note.  The Mary Jane aspect of the young ""friend"" is a bit off, but not enough to turn me away from the film.

He started using a teddy cam to capture sex with him and his partner (without his partner's knowledge) and the profits grew more.  Eventually, his partner gets wise and almost leaves for good but instead he decides to play the game.  Eventually, they get advice to expand their show to include audience participation and kink.

4890916,4,B005TIK4SQ,"This is a new film from the makers of `Shank' and `Release', the first was great the second a bit poor, but this is ruddy brilliant. Once again based in Bristol, this is about partners Aaron (Connor McKenzy) and Seb (Alex Anthony). They have both come a cropper, job wise in the economic downturn that the banking crisis has caused, but as neither of them are bankers there is no Government bail out to keep them in jobs.

As the bills pile up and the beloved Mini gets repossessed ( I have one and love it too) Aaron hits on a novel way to make some cash, he will film their love making and post it on inter net `interactive hand relief' site `Hot X Buns'. He is amazed as the money starts to roll in, but he hasn't told Seb. Well he finds out anyway and after issues of trust are sorted out they agree to carry on.

Enter ex flat mate and sexually complicated Jem (Jessica Mathews), she knows a bit about inter web pay per view as she has been working in Thailand quite well known for its liberal attitudes to all things kinky. She decides to spice things up and spice them she does. We also have a hot neighbour Mitch who does a great homage to the `Cool Hand Luke' car washing scene, only this time it is window cleaning and pumping up a tyre - fab.

This is a very funny, laugh out loud movie, that has a big feel good factor and some brilliant one liners, we even get golfing innuendo - `hole in one' etc. A brilliant sex toy shop which has the most nervous tissue monkey I have ever seen. The bedroom scenes are a bit on the tame side; with far too much duvet than is necessary for decency purposes and the music by `Nancy' is a bit sugary but really gets better.

Writers and directors Daren Flaxstone and Christopher martin have made something to be proud of and I wish them all the best for the next venture. Fans of Andrew Christian clothing are in for a treat as that is all they seem to wear including in bed and make a note of the background as we have some great touches like an advert for their bank `Gapingwide' (a play on building society/bank Nationwide for non UK types).

Whilst a comedy it deals with other issues too and is quite grown up about how it deals with emotions during stress and how far we can go when trust is abused.
