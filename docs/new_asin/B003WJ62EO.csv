8526062,1,B003WJ62EO,"worthless DVD.  I do not understand why someone would want to see such a thing. It is not even 35 c worth.  I cannot understand how someone can demant $ 35,00 for such a garbage. A remark: my review refers not to the 10 DVD Set. You must pay attention by buying: you get the box with the 10 DVDs show but alongside it you can choose by mystake ONE DVD ( I thought I made a bargain). This DVD presents a documentation about Paulo Gracindo, that's all. Has nothing to do with the telenovela itself, a true garbage. So, ATENTION.",1411171200,,526,4.198019801980198
