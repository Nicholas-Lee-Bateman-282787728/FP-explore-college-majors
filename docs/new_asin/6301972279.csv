407705,3,6301972279,"You know its a weird thing. When I was a kid I ate this movie up, strangely compelled by its goofiness and marital strain. It probably didn't hurt that my little mind was trying to fit this into the I Love Lucy show while at the same time recognizing that it didn't actually fit. I watched it whenever it popped up on TV. Now as an adult, after probably 3 decades from last seeing it (and being married), Ive watched it again and wondered just what I found so appealing about it from when I was young. I understand it better now but like it less. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz never really seem to fully commit to each other as a married couple here, its like they're dancing around each other the entire film afraid to fully confront the other and share what they're fully feeling. Of course theres highjinks aplenty including some great moments like when the trailer gets stuck in the mud in a rain squall or the trip along the mountain that is fingernails on the chalkboard tense but in the end I found myself strangely upset at both of their characters for being too afraid or too proud to embrace each others fears and foibles. This now feels more like the relic of a bygone era and while I miss aspects of it theres a lot that I don't miss too.",1489017600,,1248,4.2923728813559325

407767,5,6301972279,"The only time you see a mobile home traveling these days is behind a delivery truck. There was a time when people took these on the road and winged it. ""The Long, Long, Trailer"" is set in those times. People, like Ricky and Lucy, underestimated the difficulties of hauling a long, heavy, tube on roads that were not super highways. A lot of mishaps must have been the end result. In this case, there are many, but humorous incidents when these newlyweds take their new home off to seek adventure. Long, Long, Trailer has plenty of laughs. The trip across the country is scenic and the color is stunning. There's a wonderful supporting cast too. Retro fans will like it too.",1488499200,,673,4.570247933884297
407768,4,6301972279,"The movie itself of course is great, but I want to mention and confirm something I read from another reviewer. The 2006 edition lists the run time of the movie at 103 minutes, but what you will get is in fact the shorter 96 minute version. Also mentioned was the thin translucent case it comes in; mine did as well though not an issue to me.
Even knowing it would likely be the shorter version, I still wanted to own it and the $6 price was hard to pass up, but just want to raise awareness for others. I also reported the incorrect page information and would encourage others to do the same so that they may correct it!",1488067200,9,620,4.218487394957983

408009,4,6301972279,"I still like it but it wasn't as funny as I remembered it to be from previous showings. I used to own this movie  not sure what I did with the disc but I borrowed it from the New York Public Library last week and it somehow seemed different on this viewing than when I saw it years ago.

First, my interest in this movie was piqued again after I went to Jamestown this summer and saw the trailer model in the Lucy Desi Museum. I'm not sure what's different exactly on this viewing but it feels like parts are missing and I just wasn't laughing as much as I thought I did previously.

Don't get me wrong  I love Lucy and Desi and there are a lot of funny moments in this but I felt frustrated by their stupidity in certain places. There were definitely scenes or chunks of scenes missing, which I don't understand because it's a DVD  you usually get more on a DVD, not less. I get cutting it up for TV because of timing considerations but never on a DVD.

Other than my general observations above, I do have to say that this film was beautifully shot and I liked seeing Lucy and Desi NOT as Lucy and Ricky. Desi does do a bit of singing (of course) and Lucy gets into a lot of physical comedy, which was part of her genius so there are some Lucy and Ricky elements to this.

The costumes are beautiful and there is nostalgia in this for this time capsule of an American decade that was kind of the beginning of the modern era.",1478822400,,1425,4.141304347826087

408658,3,6301972279,"I am not writing about the merits of this movie; there are plenty of reviews available for that. I simply want to point out two things about the May 2006 edition that I received. First, this is the SHORT version of the film at 96 minutes. The product details shown here are wrong; this edition is NOT the 103 minute version.

Secondly, this edition does not come in a standard dvd case. It comes in one of those ultra slim translucent cases. My case arrived broken. With that in mind, this is the only version available on dvd that I am aware of and the price was certainly inexpensive. I deducted a star for the misleading product information and another for failing to disclose the non standard packaging.",1464307200,4,707,4.5234375

The action includes some beautiful scenes from Yosemite National Park (back then before it got crazy crowded) and a romantic dynamic to die for!

408902,5,6301972279,"Who does not love Lucy? I'm a huge classic movie lover and this little film between Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz is a rip-roaring, laugh out loud comedy gem. If you are already a fan of 'I Love Lucy', consider this film as a prequel to the show (even though the film was made during 'I Love Lucy'). It is exactly what a young Ricky & Lucy Ricardo would have gone through, before they moved into the Mertzs East 68th Street apartment building. In this film they play Nicky and Tacy, a young, recently married couple who purchase a trailer to head into their honeymoon and life together, and nothing but mishaps and misadventures ensues, exactly correlated to the trailer. Tacy is exactly like Lucy Ricardo, in terms of spending money and coming up with funny schemes to get her way. Nicky is exactly like Ricky Ricardo in that he is conscious of spending, very logical, and always ends up getting the brunt of the pain, when things inevitably go wrong with Tacy's plans. The only thing missing are Fred & Ethel Mertz but the parade of characters makes up for the friendship and kinship dynamic. A very funny movie and one that I've watched over and over again.",1461024000,4,1158,4.545454545454546
408903,4,6301972279,"I fully expected to dislike this, but it surprised me completely; and it won me over with one line of dialog.  After a series of misadventures, Lucy and Desi have gotten stuck in a mudhole on a logging road.  Desi has just dug the jack out of the car, and as he slogs through the mud over to the trailer, Lucy informs him that it's starting to rain.
""Naturally,"" he says, in the most perfect resigned deadpan I've ever heard.",1460160000,,425,4.3

The movie tells the story of a young couple who decide to live in a trailer so they won't have to be separated by the husband's work, which takes him to different locations for months at a time.  Because it stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz it is in some ways like a two-hour episode of ""I Love Lucy"".  It's still a fine adventure story, set in a time when a passenger car could tow a heavy trailer and you could find beautiful campsites by the side of the road with no one else around.  Anyone who has towed a trailer will get a kick out of the husband's efforts to back the trailer into his inlaws' driveway.  When the wife gets the idea that if she were to ride in the trailer the last hour of the day's journey they could have dinner ready to eat as soon as they parked there is a hilarious scene where she tries to prepare dinner in a moving, bouncing trailer.  One of the high points comes when their efforts to drive through a mountain pass are hampered by the collection of small boulders she has been squirreling away in every storage compartment in the trailer.",1451865600,,1261,4.220833333333333

It's not only a rare chance to see them in color, along with some incredible mountain scenery.  Even though the movie is supposed to take place in Colorado, it was filmed in Northern California, which doubles quite convincingly.  Having just come back from Colorado, I was able to relate to Desi's panicked look as he navigated along through the mountains.  In addition to the comedy we've come to expect from Lucy and Desi, they both give great and convincing serious performances as well.",1442361600,,591,4.699029126213592

410151,5,6301972279,I watched this movie as a child with my parents and enjoyed it. Next I viewed it on television as a medium aged adult. Now I have a copy of this movie and still enjoy it. Lucille Ball was a comedic genius and Desi Arnaz  was not far behind her. This is one of the funniest movies I ever watched. I love the scene where Lucy is trying to cook a delicious dinner in the trailer whle Desi is singing as he motors on down the road. That was hilarious. This is just one of my most favorite movies ever. It has a happy ending and that is what I like. Lucille Ball has given so much pleasure to so many people for so many years.,1426118400,,621,3.9285714285714284

Quite honestly, I would have been just as content had Lucy and Desi used their real names in the movie rather than that of Tacy and Nicky, simply because we'll always remember them in their roles, which will never fade away.  And as an earlier reviewer pointed out, it does seem as if the DVD lacks some scenes which were in the television broadcast version many years ago, so I will have to rely upon that reviewer's accuracy where they described the missing scenes.  I think we fans would have preferred that this DVD was the original, totally unaltered version as was initially broadcast.  I'm not aware whether or not the VHS version of this movie differed in this regard.  Overall, I'm happy with adding this to my collection and would recommend it to fans of Lucy and Desi.  I'll still give it five stars.",1423958400,,965,4.5813953488372094

Lucy and Desi have different character names and are newlyweds. Desi plays a civil engineer who has to travel to various projects around the country. Lucy thinks having a trailer so they can take their house with them is a great idea. Desi, not so much. Misadventures ensue as they travel cross-country with their trailer.

410501,3,6301972279,"The Long,Long Trailer(released Feb/54)stars,among others  Lucille Ball,Desi Arnaz,Marjorie Main,Madge Blake and Keenan Wynn. This was a chance to see TVs reigning couple in glorious colour at the theatres. The b/o receipts were strong,but the film is actually a roughly 1 1/2 hour sitcom,with cute moments throughout,but nothing to distinguish itself.
The story is pretty straight forward. Desi has a job which takes him all over the place and wife to be Lucy comes up
 with the idea to buy a trailer. Initially Desi balks but when Lucy digs her heels in it is all over but the payments. Not only does the cost of the trailer soar but poor Desi is stuck buying a new car,and installing a trailer hitch and electric brakes to boot.
The two are soon married and off they go in their traveling home. It takes Desi quite a while to overcome his nervousness about driving with the trailer and after a few faux pauxs on both of their parts, their relationship starts showing the strain. They get stuck on a dirt road which soon becomes a mud bath(with the trailer tilted to one side),they visit some relatives of Lucy's and Desi ends up wreaking havoc trying to back the trailer into their driveway,and the straw which breaks the trailers,er,camels proverbial back,is a trip up and down an 8,000 ft.incline. Lucy cannot bare to part with hundreds of pounds of rocks she has collected as souvenirs,not to mention all the jars of preserves she has amassed. The added weight makes their trip up that mountain a pretty dicey one.
After this trip Lucy takes off with the car and trailer leaving poor Desi stranded. He eventually finds her as she is about to sell the trailer to an older couple. Love works in mysterious ways and in the end the two make up and forget their trailer woes.
Lucy and Desi made a solid team on screen and their chemistry here,like their show,was palpable. The show could have been a 1 1/2 hour I Love Lucy Show,and I dare say THEIR writing team would have produced better results. The two play a good every man and woman but they needed better material than what Warners gave them. There are quite a few draggy spots,and it is a credit to the both of them that the film wasn't worse than it was. Marjorie Main(currently starring in the Ma & Pa Kettle franchise) and Keenan Wynn co star, but have VERY short entrances and exits.
Technically speaking the film its in its original full screen a/r and generally looks quite good. Extras include the trailer,a Droopy cartoon and a Pete Smith Specialty short.
All in all a nice and pleasant 94 minutes roll before our eyes with two of TV's most well known icons,Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. The two make the best of the simple premise and resulting stilted writing. Should have been better,but it is nice to see the pair in their prime together and in colour.",1419811200,,2820,4.626746506986028

410708,5,6301972279,"Well, it's Thanksgiving and with our tradition we watch Lucy. It may have been fantasy land, but we loved this couple. We watch I Love Lucy occasionally, and this was kind of an extension of those antics minus Fred and Ethel.

Lucy and Desi are a young couple bound for a construction site that requires a long travel, and Lucy in her usual dizzy fashion decides on a 40 foot trailer! Sometimes it seems the trailer is one of the characters.

There are many short comedy scenes of Lucy trying to adapt to trailer living, and Ricky pulling her out of her messes. Lucy was a comedic genius.

My one small gripe is--I wish this movie would get the DVD treatment it deserves. When watching this movie on our big screen TV, the ratio is off and everyone looks short and fat. I've played this on various devices and the result is always the same. Besides, they could give this cover a better treatment. When you get it, it's a thin, sparsely decorated plastic holder. Shame on MGM!

Other than that, please do yourself a favor and watch this. Take a vacation from reality for an hour and a half and see how wonderful our country used to be--innocent, decent, respectful manners and kindness. Virtues missing from society today.",1417046400,,1221,4.561643835616438

We backed the pickup trucks into my driveway, threw old blankets and pillows in the beds of the truck after a meal of hamburgers, hotdogs and baked beans.  Set up the movie screen and projector in the garage, made tons of popcorn and had movie house style boxes of candy for the kids.  Kids got in the beds of the trucks and covered up and relaxed with punch, popcorn and candy.  The adults in lawn chairs relaxing with non alcoholic drinks, popcorn and candy boxes.
We loved the movie shown drive in style or as close to it as possible for a garage and driveway.  We laughed at Tacy's antics from her cooking in a moving trailer to her pouting in the back seat of the car.  Nicky's breakdown at trailer brakes when trying to find a place for all his stuff in the trailer had us in stitches.  Tacy and her rock collection would be a stunt I would pull.  The scenery is gorgeous and we really find that Lucy and a nice voice when singing ""Breezing along with the Breeze"".  This movie brings back memories of traveling mountain roads and how scary they could be although we never towed anything behind us.  Its an easy movie to watch with friends and family and suitable for younger kids to understand.  This movie is layered with beautiful scenery, music and fun.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend and our barbecue and a movie night in my driveway <drive in style> was a hit with this movie.  All my neighbors loved it and applauded at the end amidst laughter and talking about their own experiences with the first time pulling any type of trailer.

The rocks she hid before they had to climb the steep grade up the mountain pass had me cracking up and biting my nails as the weight of them nearly sent the long trailer down the mountain.

As for the movie, it is very entertaining, funny and even a bit dramatic. This story of a newlywed couple to start their life on the road in a (RV style) trailer is already funny. Having Lucy and Desi as that couple makes it hilarious. With excellent direction (Vincente Minnelli) along with some notable character actors of the time makes this movie a winner.

Except for the fact that the trailer didn't have slides, they haven't really changed a whole lot since the early fifties.  I loved seeing the appliances and refrigerator from those days.  It's makes me feel nostalgic.

411724,5,6301972279,"Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz are probably best known for their TV show from the 1950s. Here they do something a little different, they are a married couple.....oh, wait a minute, that's what they did in the TV show. Anyway, they play a couple of people who meet and fall in love almost at first sight. Desi plays a nerdy scientist type, and Lucy...well she plays herself. Once in love the obvious next step is marriage. But even beyond marriage, Lucy's character is dreaming of the proverbial home with a white picket fence. BUT before the home and the kids and the dog and the mortgage, they decide to take a road trip as a part of the honeymoon. What begins as a little camping expedition in a small trailer and Desi's old car escalates to unbelievable proportions! What happens after is hilarious. But to be fair, there are times when you may become a little irritated with one or the other or both of these newlyweds. This may be the characters, but it may also be the sociology of the times, the 1950s, that reminds you that this is not a movie made yesterday. Some of my favorite parts: arriving at and meeting Lucy's family and the dinner being cooked by Lucy as Desi drives along singing the praises of what will be ready for dinner when he stops the car. As you know Desi and Lucy were married in real life until they divorced in 1960.

412100,5,6301972279,"This is one of my favorite Lucille Ball movies. I just watched it recently for the first time in years, and I had actually forgotten how funny it is! Like a long ""I Love Lucy"" episode, Lucy and Desi banter their way across the country in a trailer. We all love the scenes where Lucy attempts to make Desi a beautiful meal in a moving vehicle and it's a total disaster. Getting covered with a bag of flour and doing slapstick is classic Lucy, but I get a kick just from the eggs flying out of the frying pan!

However! Who sponsored this movie? One of the trailer companies? Seriously, this movie made me scared ever, ever to ride in one! OK, so the scenes where Lucy's rock collection (which also cracked me up) started emerging from their hiding places was so funny. But, that ride over the mountain was so nerve-wracking. In a funny way, but still. I would think the sponsors would be horrified! OK, I guess if I actually had an opportunity to go camping, I'd go. After all, mountain roads aren't that harrowing anymore, right? It WAS 60 years ago after all...",1373241600,,1062,4.418367346938775

It's not the usual sit-com family writing that you see in her TV shows though...this movie has some legitimate, first-class comedic tension that really sets it apart from some of their other work.

Filled with typical Lucy/Ricky (Nicky in the movie) pratfalls, The Long Long Trailer is a must see movie for I Love Lucy fans.

There are cameos by the actors who played Floyd 'the barber' (Andy Griffith) and aunt whatshername on the Batman TV show (actress Madge Blake). I love the nostalgia of that era, but the tension I felt of the challenges were not fun for me. I could feel the tension of them bringing that crazy thing up a winding mountain.

412399,4,6301972279,"The Long, Long Trailer is a movie sharing the honeymoon on wheels taken by Nicky and Tacy as they bring their trailer to their future home in Colorado.  They pick a trailer because Tacy really wants to set up house with her husband not just an apartment wherever they need to temporarily  rest their heads as he is a civil engineer who must travel and remain in various places for his career.  Living in a trailer seems a dream come true to Tacy who really doesn't want much more than a nice home for her and Nicky.

As Nicky and  Tacy embark on their honeymoon it all seems quite sweet and quaint.  In fact, it can make a person kind of want a trailer home themselves, and then the difficulties begin.  As idyllic as driving a trailer on a honeymoon sounds, it is a long, long trailer and moving it is not as easy as it looks, but there are great places to visit and fun and quirky people to meet.  Troubles come and go sometimes with big laughs and other times with sweet charm.

What I liked:  First of all there was not a lot for me to not like in this film.  When I first saw it as a child, I was enchanted by the idea of taking a trailer on a honeymoon.  As an adult I am charmed by old trailers and actually would love to get a nice small trailers for a little camping hop here and there (I would especially enjoy something vintage and quite similar to what Nicky and Tacy first look at when they are shopping).  I know much of it was on a set and looked it, but it kind of made me appreciate not only the film but the time frame.  That is simply how things were done then.  For me it doesn't even take away from the film.  It is like a time stamp.  I loved looking beyond the story to the props (even the cookware).  Lucy and Desi were a great team.  They worked well with each other on film.  I enjoyed the larger than life supporting cast too.  They were all certainly characters and added to the fun of the film.  The Long, Long Trailer really reminded me of what I like about old films and comedies.  There is an innocence of the characters and the circumstances and although we know that historically there was certainly bad in the world, it is easily escaped by movies such as these.

What I didn't like:  I am fairly certain that the movie was a bit longer.  It was cut down, but I do not know why or exactly where.  It was a long time since I first saw it, and in the long run it really didn't take away from the film for me.  I loved it.",1359244800,,2454,4.088050314465409

412633,5,6301972279,"This is a great film that was made and released during the popularity of the ""I Love Lucy"" show, starring Hollywood's Sweetheart Couple, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.  It is truly one of my favorites, full of slapstick humor from beginning to end.  My younger daughters and I love to watch this film over and over, which is beautifully set in the breathtaking scenery of Yellowstone National Park.  It is also a good film about beginning challenges of marriage life.  Lucille Ball plays Tacy Callini (not Stacy??) and Desi Arnaz plays Nicky Callini, a traveling engineer.  Well, Tacy shows her smarts when she strongly suggests that she and her husband-to-be purchase a trailor home, since they will spend their marriage life traveling town to town and state to state.  Brilliant idea!  But when they actually purchase a long, long trailor form a trailor show, things begin to look more daunting then they could ever have imagined.  Challenges such as taking a shower, living in a trailor park, and sleeping in a slanted trailor in a noisy, dangerous neighborhood can all have their share of problems and ordeals, they soon find.  Lucille Ball pretty much plays her usual, stubborn, air-headed character. Desi displays some very impressive operatic singing during a hilarious scene in which Lucy is attempting to create a Caesar Salad and accompanying meal in the back of the trailor, while Nicky is driving, oblivious to her being ""tossed around"" herself in the back. Lucille Ball surprised me with her great singing voice also in this movie--which is often ridiculed in the ""I Love Lucy"" show.  She and Desi sing a rollicking version of ""Breezing Along,"" a song that perfectly fits the mood of this film.  Veteran actor Keenan Wynn is featured as one of the ""co-stars"" of this film, although his featured part is very, very small--although worthwhile.  Seems to me that the actor who is featured at the beginning and end of the films playing the trailor owner had a much bigger role than Keenan Wynn and should have been named as a co-star instead.  I don't know his name, but I remember seeing him on an ""I Love Lucy"" episode playing a judge.  Other co-star Marjorie Main has a little larger speaking part (actress who starred in many ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" movies) and is also effective.
  One of the funniest scenes of this film is when Tacy and Nicky visit Lucy's relatives and Nicky attempts to back up the huge, monstrous trailor into the side of their house--with hilarious consequences.  And I often wonder how Director Vincente Minelli did such a great job of filming the scenes of the trailor as it ascents onto the high park mountains, barely missing an avalanche fiasco as it barely makes it way around the narrow ridges.  All in all, a great classic film of 50's style escapism and family entertainment.",1335139200,,2813,4.8128898128898125

The movie is a must for any Lucy fans, but it's especially fun since it shows different sides of both Lucy and Desi that were not often seen on the show. Arnaz exceeds in broad and physical comedy bits that he did not often tackle on ""I Love Lucy,"" and Ball shows her skills as a romantic lead.

412752,4,6301972279,"As the title of this review hints, I'm a big fan of the major elements that the amazing director, Vincent Minnelli, used to create a family-appropriate film that's still funny and heartwarming.  The heart and warmth of I Love Lucy is apparent in tender scenes that give us a glimpse into the real-life marriage of the show's co-stars. In their last years, each of the two, long since divorced, declared that the other was the love of their life.  You can't fake chemistry like that and this 'Trailer' is simply bubbling with that chemistry.

Another element is the glorious Technicolor photography that still looks pretty true, but this DVD image isn't the best, looking a bit grainy.  Even still, Lucy's flaming  Red hair is clearly framed by the azure western sky.  Watching original Technicolor films like this makes me long for a return of the process.

Finally, what makes the film more than an average mid century comedy is the way it captures the look and feel of the 50s, showing us how gorgeous and uncrowded highways and national parks looked. I happen to think Americans dressed better, no matter the income level, in the 1950s than ever, and the film's wardrobe department outfits Lucy with some stunning dresses, offset by Ricky's perfect slim ties, navy suits and well-shined shoes.

The slapstick moments are sprinkled throughout, and who was doing better female slapstick 'bits' than Lucy back in 1954?  Desi does what he did best in the sitcom; he usually suffers his mate's harebrained stunts (ie loading every available trailer bin, closet and drawer with sizeable souvenir rocks and endangering the vehicle's steep ascent up a gigantic mountain)..with strained calm and forgiveness.

America Loved Lucy and was learning to adore its automobiles in 1954.  This uplifting comedy will help explain the infatuation and leave you wishing you'd been along on that excursion..30c/gallon gasoline being worth a glimpse, alone.",1320192000,2,1938,5.062893081761007

412814,5,6301972279,"I used to watch this all the time, when local stations would show it on TV. It seemed inevitable that Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz---who were already successful with the ratings giant ""I Love Lucy""---would parlay that success into a motion picture contract (their next effort, ""Forever Darling"", came out 2 yrs. later). Although ""The Long, Long Trailer"" was little more than a big screen version of their antics from the TV series, it proved that both Lucy & Desi had the moxy to entertain audiences outside the tube. Desi demonstrated he was more than just a ""second banana"" to his wife, and then there was Lucy, who was so good she could engage an audience or provoke a laugh just by flashing those wide, expressive eyes. But what gives the film its timeless appeal is the premise: Bride Lucy convinces Groom Desi to buy a ""home on wheels"", selling its pros over having a standard home. Soon, Desi gives in, soon regretting his choice as he begins experiencing ""living nightmares"" over extra costs, trailer breaks & simply trying to manuever a 40-foot long monstrosity across the countryside. Nearly any married couple who made what they thought was a ""sound"" decision could readily identify with the situation.
Some familiar faces appear here: Marjorie Main lends her blustery persona, already famous for the Ma & Pa Kettle series over at Universal; Keenan Wynn has a brief but memorable appearance as an impatient traffic cop; and Madge Blake--who would become famous as Aunt Harriet in the 60's ""Batman"" TV show--as a relative whom the trailer effectively demolishes a portion of her home.
Liza's Dad Vincent Minelli directs the film, holding the reins gently while letting the story & situations steer the picture. For lovers of ""I Love Lucy"", you'll certainly enjoy this one!",1307836800,,1779,4.913621262458472

412870,4,6301972279,"Just interchange the characters' names and THE LONG, LONG TRAILER could easily pass for a feature-length ""I Love Lucy"" episode, but that's precisely why it remains such a well-loved comedy favourite.  In THE LONG, LONG TRAILER (1953), Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz team up with director Vincente Minnelli for a zany comedy that cashed in on the white-hot popularity of ""I Love Lucy""; but in perfect time-capsule fashion, the film also embodies the sunny, post-war optimism of the 1950's with all of it's shiny technological advances and uninhibited consumer spending.

Newlyweds Nicky and Tacy Collini (Arnaz and Ball) decide to forgo the traditional house and white picket fence, and instead invest their money into a deluxe trailer-home.  Tacy's exuberance for the new ""adventure"" is matched only by Nicky, terrified at the sheer prospect of towing the monstrous trailer through tiny suburban streets and down busy freeways.  Their honeymoon gets off to a brilliant start - Tacy feigns a twisted ankle and is doped up with sleeping-pills by a well-meaning ""trailer-ite"" played by Marjorie Main; and Nicky makes one hell of a first impression on his in-laws, destroying half of their prized garden whilst trying to park the ""home sweet trailer-home"".

This movie is such a joy.  Director Vincente Minnelli adds a realistic touch to the performances of Ball and Arnaz as they play the feuding honeymooning couple, surrounded by a delightful supporting cast (Keenan Wynn, Madge Blake, Moroni Olsen and the aforementioned Marjorie Main).  What makes the film so endearing and universal is that everybody can relate to ""nightmare travel"" stories, but I doubt anybody has ever endured shenanigans on the same scale as Nicky and Tacy!

A relative was on the shoot for this movie.  Those rocks that fall as that trailer goes up the mountain?  REALLY WERE FALLING.  That entire section was filmed as it happened, and one driver bailed because he was too scared to continue that drive.

Another very funny sequence is the wedding, in which the bride and groom barely have a chance to say a word to each other.

The ability to make people laugh is such a special gift and I'm so glad she left her mark on the world with this DVD and so many others. And she and Desi Arnaz together, there was definitely chemistry. In The Long, Long Trailer they play a newly married couple. Tacy Bolton-Collini and Nicholas `Nicky' Collini make a 3 ton trailer their new home (Nicky wasn't happy with the idea at first, but Tacy talked him into it).

The 40-foot trailer had Nicky flustered for a while but he got the hang of hauling it around eventually, but then all kinds of problems and unexpected expenses arose. Although I felt bad for Nicky when he had to back the trailer into the driveway when they visited relatives, it is one of the funniest scenes in the movie; especially when Tacy takes charge of the situation.

The Long, Long Trailer is a movie I'll watch any day of the week and especially when I need a good laugh. Miscommunication, arguments, failed plans, dishonesty, mistrust, stubbornness, pride - none of these things are good but Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz made them entertaining!",1272412800,,1180,4.641148325358851

The show was the greatest, and the famous TV couple was one of the hottest (even though they did have some devastating troubles in real life). But would it be too much trouble to actually watch a movie that stars Lucille and Desi? We still get to watch them on television for free. The simple answer is no, it won't be too much trouble. ""The Long, Long Trailer"" is a great 50's film. Not only do you get to see these two fine actors onscreen, you also get some dazzling cinematography (the beautiful shots of Yosemite are a must-see). And of course, you get a wide variety of comedy that involves family, money, love, and of course, the trailer. The only downside to this film, at least in my opinion, is that it's right below the entertainment value of ""I Love Lucy."" The jokes aren't as clever, and the sight gags aren't as hysterical. But perhaps it's not trying to be like the show. This features a completely different environment, and the film's overall charm and beauty is what distinguishes itself from the TV show. Overall, this is a very well-made 50's motion picture that every ""Lucy"" fan must have.

Recently, my wife (who is an avid ""I Love Lucy"" maven) received the complete set (all 194 episodes!) of ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD. I surprised her with a copy of ""The Long, Long Trailer"" and she was delighted.

The movie is every bit as much fun now as when I first saw it back in the 50's (my age is showing). The chemistry between Ricky and Lucy makes the plot go at full throttle. The premise for the plot is that they are newly-weds who decide (or more accurately, Lucy decides) to make their home in a trailer rather than a more stationary target. Ricky's job, it seems, involves much travel, thereby inducing Lucy to suggest that their residence become a ""moveable feast"".

The sight gags work as well as ever, and the dialog between the principles is comparable to the formula that worked so well on the television series. Without divulging too much, Lucy manages to get her way (as usual) with Ricky, ultimately resulting in a near-death experience on a mountain road. Beautiful scenery from Yosemite National Park as well as other ""on the road"" locations form the backdrop for their tumultuous ""honeymoon"", which alternately nearly both kills them and causes them to break up before it is over. Never fear: all's well that ends well. And we can all enjoy a good belly-laugh vicariously.

Several of the key elements for humor where there...the rock collection, running over the flower beds, etc.  But I recalled other parts of the movie that were  not on this DVD.
There was alot more character and story development in the original version shown on T.V.  I remember Spagehtti going all over the place...not in this DVD; and when Lucy (Tacey) was in the trailer with a sprained ankle, there was more in the sequence than shown (Marjorie Maine had a lot more speaking parts).  Overall, it was fun seeing the highlights again, but I wish the entire movie had been shown. I'm wondering why they deleted some of it.",1252368000,59,787,4.553191489361702

If you think the RV's of today are ""big rigs"" then you ain't seen nothing yet.  This is a hilarious move from the 50's when you could actually move huge mobile homes via car.  Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz are classic in this film about a newlywed couple opting to buy a mobile home to take cross-country on route to a job in Colorado.

Yes, cross-country, with Lucy and Desi, pulling a humongous trailer via car through ""shortcuts"", mud roads, mountainous terrains, and busy streets.  Lucy even does some of the driving which is everything you can imagine!

If you have ever RV'd you can relate to the majority of the situations in this hilarious movie.  If you have ever wondered about RVing this would give you a great laugh at some of the outrageous situations you can encounter.  AND if you are a Lucy fan this is definitely a must have.

Priceless sight gags that were mentioned, like Lucy struggling to put together a meal when the trailer's actions sent all the ingredients flying, and the pans rolling across the stove. Or when the trailer got stuck and Lucy ends up in a mud bath. I was definitely with Lucy when she nervously looked down the ravine as Nicky was navigating the mountain road. It was really funny when she took over the driving, scaring her husband out of his gourd. As for all those rocks, poor Nicky thought Tacy had obeyed his order to get rid of them, only to find she had hidden them inside the trailer walls.

The novel was made into a movie in 1954 starring Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Marjorie Main, Keenan Wynn, Bert Freed, Moroni Olsen, Gladys Hurlbut, Madge Blake, and Walter Baldwin. It was directed by Vincente Minnelli working from a screenplay by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich.

According to Turner Classic Movies' host, Robert Osborne, the studio was not sure if this film would be a success because they thought that people would not pay money to see Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz in a movie when they could watch Lucy & Desi on television for free (I Love Lucy). So Desi made a $25,000 bet with the studio that the movie would make more money than the current highest grossing comedy at that time (Father of the Bride starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor and also directed by Vincente Minnelli).

But do it only if you can laugh at yourself. Watch this movie not as a warning, but watch it to peer into the proverbial crystal ball to see what could happen, and usually does, when someone wanders into a boat show, car show, home improvement show, etc., and buys something that seems so perfect at the time, but ends up being one of the worst decisions ever. I'm guilty of this. Life is filled with bumps that make our dreams go off-course, and this movie is all about this, as told from a first-person narrative (initially) after a husband and wife buy an RV trailer.  This movie is hilarious, and although the movie is from the 50's, the humor can be easily related to life today. Lucille Ball falls in love with a lovely trailer and also falls for the ""perfect dream"" of camping and traveling and living the ""good life"" that awaits all RV-ers. She convinces her husband to join the ""dream"" so they buy the dream trailer. The movie follows their many bumps of trailer life that almost causes a divorce. How many people, when traveling on vacation, collect things like cups, shot glasses, etc. to remember their visits?  Lucille Ball does one better.  She collects rocks (virtual boulders) and fills the trailer with them, and the scenes of Desi Arnaz trying to maneuver their 30ft, overweight trailer up and over the Rockies afterwards is worth the purchase price.

413361,5,6301972279,"Watching the Lucille Ball/Desi Arnaz film ""The Long, Long Trailer"" some 50+ years after it was made, is a rather surreal experience. By 1953, The ""Baby Boom"" was indeed booming, tract housing was all over the place like crab grass, trailer parks multiplied like jackrabbits, and Americans were inundated with the wonders of ""space age"" technology. Big, flashy-looking cars, refrigerators, TV sets, ""streamlined"" furniture, and snazzy clothes were the things that everyone wanted to have. It was as if America wanted to wipe away its gritty, unglamourous past and face the space age all polished and waxed and Simonized. To see Eisenhower's America as depicted by MGM in better-than-real-life Technicolor and filmed largely on MGM's backlot (interspersed with location photography of Yosemite Park,etc) I feel like I'm watching home movies that were shot in a suburb of a distant planet!  ""The Long, Long Trailer"" was made to capitalize on the overwhelming popularity of TV's ""I Love Lucy"", which finally made a star of 40ish Lucille Ball, who had never really achieved ""big stardom"" in the 20 years she had been in showbiz. So, if you REALLY loved Lucy, you could go and spend money to sit in a theater and watch Lucy and Desi on a big screen in an ""Air-Cooled"" theater in COLOR, and with no commericials! This film has always been a favorite of mine, ever since I first watched it with my sister on our parents' blonde wood console black-and-white TV back in the mid 1960s. See Lucy fall in the mud (I have to admit I get a rather sadistic pleasure out of watching this bit over and over again). See Lucy try to prepare a gourmet dinner while in a moving trailer, with disastrous results (God, the things they did to this lady!) See Desi perform a medley of songs while driving a huge convertible, pulling an even MORE huge trailer, all in stunning Technicolor. How could you NOT like this film? I must have seen this film at least 50 times when I was growing up! Detractors call this film one long ""I Love Lucy"" episode which, of course it is, but it certainly isn't dull, and Lucy and Desi were very talented, hardworking people. Who cares about their less-than-happy personal life?  The supporting cast is great, filled with many characters actors who had long, long careers, such as Marjorie Main, Keenan Wynn, Moroni Olson, Madge Blake, and Bert Freed. The picture quality on the DVD is beautiful, with crisp imagery and breathtaking color. One can really understand why Lucille Ball was dubbed ""Technicolor Tessie"". She looks great. The location photography is picture-postcard lovely, and all of the pathologcally ""Fifties"" trappings, such as the Helen Rose clothes and humongous cars, remind us of a VERY different time. This film is a real time piece, it brings back very fond memories of a time that really seems ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....""

There are two several scenes that are our favorites. 1) Tacy (Lucille B.) fixes dinner in a moving trailer (HAH) 2) Nicky (Desi A.) freaks out trying to get his golf clubs to fit in the trailer; 3) Tacy and Nicky try to get over the high passes in Colorado with a rock-filled trailer); 4) a mechanic explains why trailer brakes are soo important.

One disaster after another, and you will be howling with laughter, along with sympathy for her dear hubby, who has to put up with not only her, but this trailer of all trailers!

413386,4,6301972279,"""The Long, Long Trailer"" is a terrific piece of 1950's comedy, with many laugh-out loud moments, lots of slapstick, and no bedroom or bathroom humor. This was when comedy was king in Hollywood, and Lucy and Desi were at the top of their careers as a team. I've always felt that as a comedian, Desi was every inch Lucy's equal, and he does a shower scene that is priceless, as he struggles with an uncooperative showerhead. The highlight of the film however, is the upward climb to the elevation of 8000 feet, hauling their jumbo-sized ""home"" behind them, as they try to alleviate the tension by talking about a movie neither of them can quite remember. It's a scene that always has me in stitches (as Lucy's rock collection emerges from its hiding places), and it's a remarkable example of classic humor, and perfect comedic timing.

Behind the camera there is more talent than what one would normally get in a family comedy, with Vincente Minnelli directing, and the great Robert Surtees (Oscar winner for the 1959 ""Ben Hur"") as cinematographer. There are some lovely vistas of Yosemite National Park, and among the cast in small parts are Marjorie Main as Mrs. Hittaway, and Keenan Wynn as a policeman.  This is all Lucy and Desi though, and they make the most of every moment. They also reaped many rewards from it, as the film was a huge box-office success for MGM.

413388,5,6301972279,"Into the third season of their highly successful TV sitcom ""I Love Lucy"", the then married Lucille Ball (1911-1989) and Desi Arnaz (1917-1986) starred together in a hilarious 1954 film entitled ""The Long, Long Trailer"".  Lucy played the character Tacy Bolton, who is engaged to Desi's character named Nicholas 'Nicky' Collini.  Because Nicky's job involves a lot of travel, Tacy believes that the best way for them to be together is for them to live in a trailer.  Begrudgingly, Nicky goes along with Tacy to a trailer show, but the trailer that Tacy had seen advertised is much smaller than she expected.  However, across from it is a 40-foot monster that Tacy insists that she & Nicky just go and look at.  Not long thereafter, Nicky is signing the purchase agreement for the then very expensive trailer.  Since Nicky's car isn't heavy enough to pull such a large trailer (it weighs over three tons), Nicky has to then trade in his car for a much larger and expensive one that he must then have customized with a large trailer hitch.  The mechanic that installed the hitch (played by Jack Kruschen, 1922-2002) gives Nicky a driving lesson to learn how to operate the trailer brakes with the car.  Nicky is so traumatized by the experience that he can't stop hearing the mechanic saying, ""Trailer brakes first!"", as well as the squealing brakes.

Once the trailer is loaded, Tacy & Nicky drive off with their ""forty feet of train"" behind them and are heckled by passing cars.  When they stop at their first trailer park (which seems highly idealized), instead of having their wedding night to themselves, other trailer park residents invite themselves over.  They include Mrs. Hittaway (Marjorie Main, 1890-1975, better known as the character ""Ma Kettle"") and Mr. Hittaway (Howard McNear, 1905-1969, better known as ""Floyd"" from the 1960-1968 TV sitcom ""The Andy Griffith Show"").  Later, Tacy and Nicky are slated to stay with her Aunt Anastasia (Madge Blake, 1899-1969, who played ""Aunt Harriet"" in the 1960's live action ""Batman"" TV series); but Nicky has some difficulty backing the trailer into their driveway, so their stay isn't as pleasant as expected.  Two of the most entertaining scenes include Tacy trying to prepare dinner in a moving trailer and Nicky & Tacy driving the trailer on a narrow road over an 8000-foot Colorado mountain pass, which is made more difficult with Tacy's heavy rock & jar collection.

Overall, ""The Long, Long Trailer"" is a hilarious, entertaining and engaging film that I wholeheartedly rate with 5 out of 5 stars.  It was also one of the most successful films released in 1954 and is still just as funny today as it was then.  The film ending is also very endearing.

If you are one of the millions who loved Lucy, you'll love the Long, Long Trailer!
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were one of the great comedy teams, and The Long, Long Trailer was one of their most successful films.

Before their marriage Tacy Bolton and Nicky Collini decide (well, Tacy decides and Nicky goes along, reluctantly) to buy a trailer so that she can follow him and make a home for him while he travels to construction sites.  Unfortunately, he has never pulled a long trailer and it proves almost too much for him, not to mention that it is a ""budget buster.""

This is a typical situation comedy of the type that Lucy and Desi did so well.  A laugh a minute is guaranteed!

Everything starts out well enough until a series of mishaps incur and almost drive the couple out of their minds.

413473,4,6301972279,"Directed by Vincent Minelli, this comedy, starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnez, was filmed at the height of the popularity of their television show, ""I Love Lucy"". In this film, Lucy was never funnier, and Desi was never better as her comedic foil.
The plot is surprisingly simple. Tacy Collins (Lucille Ball) and Nicholas Carlos Collini (Desi Arnez) are about to be married. Tacy persuades him that having a trailer home would be ideal, since he has the type of job that takes him away so often. This way, she could always be there to take care of him no matter where he is working, as their home would always go with him, wherever he may be. Nicky buys into her logic, and the rest is history.
They purchase a top of the line trailer home, a new car to tow it, and get married. Tacy and Nicky then hit the road and have a number of very funny adventures. They will have you belly laughing, as the personas of their film characters do not differ greatly from that of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, the characters of their television show. If it ain't broke, why fix it?
Keenan Wynn has a small role as a traffic control cop whose path briefly crosses theirs. Don't blink, or you may miss him. Some of the footage is shot in gorgeous Yosemite National Park and the cinematography is a treat, with beautiful scenic vistas replete with mountain views.
Not only was this film a hit for MGM in 1954 and the best grossing comedy of the year, but it was also their best grossing comedy to date, beating MGM's previous record holder, ""Father of the Bride"".

A couple notes of correction to an earlier review by ""fddoepke"" of Claremont, CA: this film was not only quite successful in its time, it was MGM's top-grossing comedy of the year; Lucy and Desi also made one more film for MGM release (in 1956), FOREVER, DARLING, costarring James Mason, which, though worth a look for Lucy and Desi fans, nowhere near approached the ""gem"" status of THE LONG, LONG TRAILER.",1014076800,6,788,4.676258992805756

This movie is a must if you are a fan of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. I have viewed the VHS/PAL version and it is one of the best things done by that fabulous comedy couple from yester Year.  There are several other supporting characters in this very
funny comedy. The end result just pure harmless happy fun.
The story centres on Taci ( Lucy) and Nicky (Desi) as they travel across the wide open spaces of the United States of America  in a new caravan ( trailer) and a new car and morgages of thousands of dollars. The story centres upon ALL the problems thatface these novice caravaners, they have to buy a new car  ""It will be a big saving in the end "" advises the salesmen. The completed demolition of Tacy's aunt's front
garden and their side driveway by Nicky in the reverse up the driveway scene. The cast is filled with funny supporting characters like Marjorie Main, and Keenan Wynn
who has five words in all as he plays the cop on point duty. He was perfect for the roll. Lucy and Desi singing ""Breezing Along With the Breeze,"" with the back drop of that famous beautiful Yosemite National Park another great moment.
The scene where they have collected rocks and assorted fruit /jams and are so over load the caravan now weights five tonnes. They struggle up the eight thousand foot
high mountain road with Nicky not knowing why the brakes are over heating on the down grades and the motor is working hard to climb the next hill. All is revealed at the very top of the mountain when the caravan almost collapses from the strain and
stress of the climb. At the very end of the movie as the greater part is told in a single flash back the story and the viewer catch up with the pair, they kiss and make up in
true Hollywood style. There are some small faults such as boom shadows and cars changing make and model on the mountain external scenes in the production however they are minor and do not detract from the finished product. A great movie with two
Super Professional Stars in the Old Hollywood tradition. The end result was a box office hit for the 1954 season.
Great work , great movie and five stars all the way.",1003795200,2,2155,4.3959899749373434
413501,5,6301972279,"Lucy and Desi, (or Daisy and Nicki as they are known in the movie), have the chemistry that it takes to hold your full attention through this hillarious comedy.  As newly weds who have bought their first ""home"" on wheels the adventures never end.  We can all relate to that first year of marriage, and then add to the mix the comedy of the Ball/Arnaz duo and you have a feel good movie filled with all the emotions newly weds go through.

413502,5,6301972279,"Because fans stayed away from this film in droves, Lucy and Desi never made another movie together. Too bad, because the film is far superior to the series. Credit should go to veteran director Vincente Minelli and his sure hand in balancing the material. Against all odds: Ball's slapstick is drained of usual shrillness, Desi's star is allowed to shine, situation is raised above personality, and peripheral crowd scenes are heightened to hilarious commentary on busybody middle America. In fact, this is one of few 50's movies to capture spirit of a rising middle class: the buoyant optimism, the credit card dependency, the aping of upper class tastes. All is accomplished, nevertheless, with an underlying sweetness that might not be expected from two overaged stars then in the process of subduing the tigers of TV land. Moreover, the choice of a trailer gimmick for the comedy setting was an inspired one. A true little gem and document of its time.",1001894400,33,956,4.98125

413549,5,6301972279,"Unavailable on video for many years, ""The Long, Long Trailer,"" a 1950s ""on the road"" film, stars the comedy team of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, as Tacy and Nicholas ""Nicky"" Carlos Collini. Directed by Vincente Minelli, the film rolls along (after an opening flashback) by showing one silly mishap after another as Tacy and Nicky take a honeymoon trip in their trailer. This elegantly mismatched couple go through the inevitable period of adjustment that comes after marriage, with the added stress that comes from trailer living for the uninitiated. The allure of this film is multilayered: a carryover of the 1950s traditional husband-and-wife roles from the popular television series, ""I Love Lucy""; humorous vignettes about visiting relatives; vacation miscues and misunderstandings, which are so frustrating at the time but make for great stories later.
My favorite part of the film is when Nicky is pulling the long, long trailer behind their new car up a narrow mountain pass. The brakes are heating up furiously, and he discovers the reason for it. Tacy has been collecting rocks as souvenirs from all their stopping places, which she had hidden all over the trailer. This scene is classic Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz bantering: he had told her to get rid of the rocks (as the pragmatist), but she would not (as the sentimental). Here is a clear example of subversion of authority, a conflict which creates the tension and the comic relief needed to move the plot (and the trailer) along.

It's strange, because the team's second full length feature (FOREVER DARLING) was a complete flop (with the masses and the critics, anyway) and the hour long Lucy/Desi shows seemed forced -perhaps it is in the timing and the writing that the 180 episodes of I LOVE LUCY work and these longer features don't..........
