2625901,5,B000H3A226,This is the best training video for Kite Sailing.  My wife and I watch it before we go out for a session.  Highly recommended.,1311379200,,126,4.208333333333333
2625902,5,B000H3A226,This DVD is the best I have seen in clearly showing you how to Kite board. It is worth every penny.,1309305600,,99,3.761904761904762
2625903,5,B000H3A226,DVDs are not a substitute for professional training.  Kites can be very powerful and dangerous.  I have not found a better series of training videos than these and I have purchased several over the years.  You will want at least the beginner and intermediate volume 1 in your collection if you are relatively new in this sport.  There are good tips to help you advance and to correct your mistakes.,1299542400,2,398,4.642857142857143
2625904,5,B000H3A226,I bought a few other DVDs.  This one is so well made that it really will help you as you take your lessons. After a few hours with an instructor you can kick back and watch this to understand what went wrong and how to do it better.  OF COURSE it shows you common mistakes.  How else can you learn?,1274054400,,298,3.933333333333333
2625905,5,B000H3A226,"Progression is a well-produced and informative product.  Even though I have yet to kiteboard (weather conditions were not favorable), I feel as though I'm ready to master the kiteboard.  In this DVD, you will learn everything up to jumping and soaring through the air.  It's certified by IKO.  So, it may just as well be the training plan you will use at any reputable kiteboarding school.  If you plan to kiteboard, I suggest reviewing this DVD a few times before you go.  As a result, you will enjoy training even more.",1194393600,6,521,4.670329670329671
2625906,5,B000H3A226,good to watch before you take lessons. learn the terms and lessons will come faster when your paying by the hour.,1410998400,,113,4.428571428571429
2625907,4,B000H3A226,"Thought the DVD was very thorough and covered a lot of details that are not in other beginner DVDs. It's not filled with a bunch of sick tricks and jumps. I did wish it had showed more wrecks or bodydrags on the beach ,just to impress how dangerous it can be without proper instructions. If nothing else it should keep you from looking like a total dork during your first lesson(s).",1363564800,,382,4.394366197183099
2625908,4,B000H3A226,"This is a fairly well made comprehensive review DVD for the kite-boarding beginner.  It progresses logically, and emphasizes certain techniques and moves.

I found it helpful.  It isn't going to replace 6 or 8 instructor lessons, but it does illustrate things that can be done to facilitate learning.

It is worth owning.",1362182400,3,321,5.115384615384615
2625909,4,B000H3A226,As a BEGINNER kite boarder I found this DVD very helpful. It walks through each step of the process and has a nice use of split screens to show up both what the kite is doing and what the person is doing. I would recommend this to my friends.,1350604800,4,242,3.9591836734693877
2625910,5,B000H3A226,"Excellent video for beginners.  Very helpful for reviewing skills necessary for kiteboarding.  Each step in setting up the kite to launching is clearly shown, with many skills shown in slow motion.  Not a replacement for a qualified instructor.",1342828800,,244,5.368421052631579
2625911,5,B000H3A226,"Be warned, there are many ""learn to kiteboard"" DVD where some ""pro"" rider ran out with one person & a handycam and shot a video in a day, and are trying to make a quick buck... this video however is extremely well done... the information is provided in chapters, and then the chapters themselves are logically broken down covering the overall concept, the important individual elements, and then common mistakes.  If you are learning or wanting to learn to kite, get this DVD.  Learn everything on this DVD to be a safe & accomplished kiteboarder.  Make sure you watch & then practice things like body dragging to your board & self-rescue.  Don't make the mistake of watching the DVD and then thinking you know how to self-rescue.  Practice safely, if you mess up, watch the DVD again to correct your mistakes, and then go do it again.  While I was learning to kite, I watched this DVD many times over.  Its paid for itself 100 times over and then some.  The intermediate DVD is really good too, but start with this one.",1339977600,6,1020,4.565934065934066
2625912,4,B000H3A226,"Very well put together  instructional DVD. Good chapter set-up. We can't all remember everything our in-person kite boarding instructors yell to us over the wind while running our equipment upwind over wet sand. This an awesome DVD that you can leisurely watch for specific areas/techniques (chapters) to find out or reinforce what your instructor actual said. Next time out, you're sure to show progress. Background music a little grating after awhile. Please don't use this DVD as a substitute for professional kiteboarding instruction, yes ,its expensive but cheaper than ER visits and broken equipment!",1330560000,4,606,5.446808510638298
2625913,3,B000H3A226,"I did not like it, fell short of instructions, the kiteschool DVD [..] OR [..] is much better. It's a French made DVD but available in English in the US, they go slower, deeper and further in the instructions.",1324339200,7,209,4.384615384615385
2625914,5,B000H3A226,If your learning how to kiteboard than this DVD is for you!!! Start here then go to a trainer kite.  Easier to throw out a few bucks for a DVD then an entire kite if you realize this isn't for you.,1315267200,3,197,3.8048780487804876
2625915,5,B000H3A226,"I'm new to the sport of kiteboarding and wanted an instructional video that would allow me to learn the basics prior to my first lessons. This DVD did an excellent job of taking the viewer (me) step-by-step through the fundamentals of kiteboarding. I really enjoyed the split screen feature that shows the positioning of the kite while simultaneously showing a close-up of the kiteboarder during every technique. I also enjoyed the segments of the common mistakes one will experience while kiteboarding. I went back and watched them after my lessons and learned what I was doing wrong. Lastly, I videotaped my first lessons so I could compare my positioning and technique to the this instructional DVD. Since lessons are very expensive, I feel this DVD was a good value for me as it allowed the instructor to accelerate through segments I already knew from watching the video and spend more time on areas that I was having more difficulty grasping and answer questions the video didn't cover.

The only slight criticism I have is the background music during transitions to the next segment. I found that it gets annoying but this is easily fixed by hitting the mute button and then turning the sound back on when instruction is being provided. I highly recommend buying this instructional DVD to supplement the learning experience with kiteboarding lessons. I have also purchased the next videos in the Progression series as I aspire to advance and improve my riding skills and don't want to pay for expensive lessons to accomplish this.",1313884800,5,1537,4.957364341085271
8136130,5,B000H3A226,"I wish I had seen this before I flew to Maui for a few lessons.  I really like the layout and I can tell a lot of thought went into the order the information is presented.  Seeing the demonstration videos really helps me understand what the instructors were teaching me.  I am far more confident that I understand the skills I am trying to master and look forward to my next chance to continue with another lesson.

If you have never taken a lesson but plan to my recommendation would be to watch the video a couple of times without really trying to memorize any particular part.  Your instructor may use different words but I am confident he will be saying pretty much the same things.  You will be more receptive because of the excellent graphics and info in this dvd.

If you are already taking lessons or are a novice already then the visuals and clear explanations in the dvd may very well clear up confusion you don't even know you have.",1496188800,,943,4.416184971098266
8136131,5,B000H3A226,"A must see for all beginners , covers it all.",1491523200,,45,3.6
8136132,5,B000H3A226,Great!  Well done.,1475884800,,18,5.0
8136133,4,B000H3A226,monotone but quality information. still rewatching it although I'm taking lessons in person,1465430400,,91,6.076923076923077
8136134,5,B000H3A226,They deliver the video they said they would!!  If you are going to try kite boarding watch this FIRST!!!,1457481600,,104,4.473684210526316
8136135,4,B000H3A226,"Good, but should concentrate more on the use of the kite.",1438646400,,57,4.2727272727272725
8136136,4,B000H3A226,"Lessons are OK very detail but some sections the presentation is very boring, made me fell asleep. Background  music also getting extremely annoying as all chapters use the same short track and loop infinitely... I think the DVD will be much better without the background track..",1434844800,,279,5.065217391304348
8136137,5,B000H3A226,"I found this DVD to be just as useful as a lesson. I'm not saying this DVD takes the place of a lesson it does not. Im saying this is an excellent supplement for learning how to kite board. This DVD goes over everything you need to know as a beginner, from kite setup, staying upwind, to sliding turns. It also breaks everything down into simple well-explained steps. I have had a total of four kite board lessons and can say that this video covers almost everything my instructors have taught me. The fact that I can, pause, rewind, fast forward, and select whatever it is that I need to work on makes this invaluable.",1432512000,,619,4.391304347826087
8136138,5,B000H3A226,Nice into video and it gave me some ideas on what to do next. I think it might be become even more useful once I get some initial lessons,1430352000,,137,3.7586206896551726
8136139,5,B000H3A226,"Most excellent format to understand, then take it to the water",1424044800,,62,4.7272727272727275
