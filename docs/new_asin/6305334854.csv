Since then I'd sought out and  seen all of Jim's other films..loved them too..I really want to check out ""Charlie's Family"" Mr. VanBebber's latest..

1050174,2,6305334854,"Movies are made for our enjoyment. How good or bad they are is a matter of opinion. This movie however is really not open to too much debate. In the same vain as Vigilante and the Warriors (both much better films) this is the story of Goose played by Jim Van Bebber as the leader of a viloent street gang named The Ravens. Danny ,Paul Harper, is the leader of a rival Street gang named The Spiders and Hates Goose. Goose's girlfriend an Ouija reading weirdo trys to gets Goose out of the gangs. He finally relents and quits. When he dose the Spiders and Ravens join together. Danny sends two goons to kill Goose however they just beat his girl to death with golf clubs. Goose is crushed and hides out with his bum of a father for a while before finally just hitting skid row. The new leader of the Ravens get's Goose to come back to the gang's for one last job. I will not go into any more detail becouse the movie is not very long after that.
Deadbeat At Dawn is obviously an ambitious film from Van Beeber however it just never, and I mean ever, comes together. Had the movie focused more on Goose getting revenge for his girlfriend death it may have been a better film. The acting is really poor and the pacing is really off kilter. The movie has some very graphic moments and they do nothing but take away from the movie. Seeing a close up of someone getting there throat ripped open is not my idea of great filmmaking. You leave the movie finding it hard to hate but not easy to like. Van Beeber tries and just fails to produce a good solid movie, but at least he tried.",1026604800,,1575,4.235880398671096
1050175,5,6305334854,"Finally, Jim Van Bebber's immortal exploitation classic is back in print,  and it's a beauty. Shortly available in a badly tranferred, overly bright  VHS tape from Ketchum Video and a staple of video bootleggers everywhere  (with some of the boots outshining the original), this is probably the best  we will ever see the film look. As it is quite grainy and dark at times,  the image is sharp, the colors are stable, and Van Bebber's gritty  aesthetic shines through.
However, I take offense to the remarks made by  Andrew MacEwen concerning this motion picture. It appears that Mr. MacEwen  is the one who (as he snidely puts it) feels as if it makes a serious  statement about modern society. Sir, you can feel however you want,  but....Deadbeat At Dawn was a film intended for the drive-ins and hearts of  B-Movie fans everywhere. While it may be about a very depressing scenario,  Van Bebber's movie is meant to be little more than dumb gory fun and  succeeds admirably. Maybe you should take out the pretentious attitude and  rewatch the movie from another viewpoint.",967939200,2,1073,4.824175824175824
1050176,5,6305334854,"Well now - this is what underground film was meant to be like.  Lot's of blood, lots of gore and knife fights, and a few heads rollin'. The Trailer for ""Chunkblower"" is a must see.",963964800,,180,4.142857142857143
1050177,4,6305334854,"With such a meager budget, it was only natural for the film to seem royally tacky and cheap at times, but somehow Van Bebber was able to make the film effective in its own right.  Basically 90 minutes of Van Bebber  wandering aimlessly around the ghettos of Dayton, Ohio (I didn't even know  such a place existed), the film really picks up once he rips off  $100,000.00 from a particularly violent gang of redneck and trailer  trash.
This film is the epitomy of the trashy backwoods midwest mixed  well with the wrong side of the tracks in an urban nightmare.  We have  sleazy losers doing drugs and beating up their girlfriends, later  philosophizing about their place in society while they stab and shoot each  other.
Van Bebber really found his nitch with this film in the annals of  White Trash filmmaking, and made it exciting enough with non-stop violence,  gore, and chase scenes to get the blood going (literally).  It's too bad  his career never took off after this film, and as I've heard his rampant  drug use played a major factor in that... plus he spent a long stay in  prison recently for rather dubious reasons.  Deadbeat really shows how  multi-talented Van Bebber can be with his mind set to it; he acted,  directed, did the fight chooreography, and the gore effects...  which were  pretty darn impressive.",958089600,,1324,4.719298245614035
1050178,4,6305334854,"This is what low budget, independent film making is all about.  Want to see what can be done with a little money, a lot of guts (figuratively and literally) and chutzpah?  This is the one for you. Goose decides to leave  his gang for his girlfriend, but his rival kills her.  On a drunken binge  and suicidal, one of Goose's old gang buddies smacks him back into  soberness for an armored truck heist to be pulled off with Goose's rival's  gang as partners.  Of course, it's a ruse, and Goose's gang is wiped out,  leaving only him to fight the good fight and attempt to get the stolen loot  to his dead girlfriend's sister.  Very violent, very gory, very exciting.  Sure it looks grainy, but the action's fierce, the dialogue is convincing,  and everything just seems to click.  Probably the best backyard Urban  Action Flick there is, and well worth the money.",932169600,7,862,4.578947368421052

7891871,4,6305334854,"Jim Van Bebber's break-through feature is a display of wild ambition and ingenuity that truly captures the spirit of the Independent filmmaker. Shot on 16mm film without a single trained actor over the course of four years, DEADBEAT AT DAWN wears the badge of low-budget cinema proudly, with an uncompromised vision of gritty street violence. DEADBEAT AT DAWN follows Goose, a former gang member who sets out for revenge after his past rivals murder his girlfriend in cold blood. Van Bebber stars in the leading role himself, while also serving as the stunts coordinator and make-up department for the film's many action sequences and special effects. The production includes everything from martial arts to car crashes, weapons mastery, and even a vertical descent down the side of a building, and all on a non-existent budget. Despite the steady stream of bloody violence and gore, Van Bebber never loses focus on the story or characters, and delivers a powerful revenge plot that echoes elements from DEATH WISH to THE WARRIORS and COMBAT SHOCK.

7891872,5,6305334854,"DEADBEAT AT DAWN was the first full-length film from underground legend director/actor Jim VanBebber. Released in 1988 but filmed over the course of the previous year or two (utilizing equipment from Wright State University when possible), DEADBEAT AT DAWN is the ULTIMATE expression of what ambitious, never-surrender, indie filmakers can accomplish. Shot on a budget that virtually did not exist, VanBebber and his acolytes' passion to make this film shines brightly and is much of what makes the film work. Despite the budget, the film is just so compelling and from the gut that one cannot help but be amazed...

The story is rather simple (if you don't wanna know how the film ends, etc., skip this paragraph). Goose (played by Jim VanBebber, who also does all his own stunts, many of which are jaw-droppingly dangerous) is the leader of the Ravens, a rag-tag street gang caught in a violent war with a rival gang The Spiders led by the sadistic and crazed Danny (played by actor Paul Harper who delivers one of the greatest villain performances ever). After a brutal knife-fight in a cemetary between Goose and Danny, Goose's psychic girlfriend Christie convinces him to give up the gang life-style. After more violence Goose reluctantly agrees. He'll leave the gang after one last large drug-deal. While Goose is making the drug transaction, Christie is murdered and mutilated by the drug-addled Bonecrusher (a truly amazing performance by Marc Pitman who would deliver another knock-out performance as Tex Watson in VanBrebber's epic THE MANSON FAMILY) and another of Danny's henchmen. Goose returns home to find his beloved dead and after disposing of her body in a trash-compactor(!!!) vows revenge. But first he goes on a suicidal binge of alcohol and drug-abuse and is saved from self-destruction at the last second by the new leader of the Ravens (who have now teamed up with The Spiders as one super-gang) in order to pull off an armoured-car heist. Goose at gunpoint is forced to participate. After successfully pulling off the heist the Ravens are double-crossed by their supposed allies The Spiders, and everyone but Goose is annihilated in an orgy of uzi-splattered ultra-violence. However, Goose escapes with all the money from the heist and is pursued for the rest of the film by The Spiders (led by the hated Danny), whom one by one Goose gradually escapes from and disposes of in many creative and always highly gory ways which often include some pretty exceptional martial arts techniques. The film ends with one of the all-time greatest fight to the death sequences between Goose and Danny (seriously, this fight is so vicious, so realistic, and so graphic that it is unforgettable) and with a mortally wounded Goose giving the money to Christie's younger orphaned sister before staggering out of the alley and onto the sidewalk of downtown Dayton, Ohio (where the film was shot), and collapsing dead but victorious, while passer-bys ignore him and side-step his corpse. A truly AWESOME ending that is legitimately a piece of brilliant film-making.

Now if you simply judge the film by the plot it's hardly original. But after VIEWING the film you'll feel as if VanBebber has just re-invented multiple genres! There's kung-fu, revenge, hyper-extreme violence, truly CLASSIC moments of dialogue, outstanding acting at times (so good that it outweighs the weaker moments of acting in the film), amazingly realistic and disturbing gore as well as classic splatter, outstanding villains (many of whom would re-appear in VanBebber's other films like THE MANSON FAMILY, MY SWEET SATAN, etc.), black comedy, social satire, and an energy level and vibe that is totally unique. This film is truly an instance of capturing magic in a bottle...HUGE honorable mention to producer & cinematographer Michael King who perfectly captures the desperate terrain of Reagan-era inner-city America and the deadbeat characters (especially the awesome Bonecrusher played by Marc Pitman and Goose's junkie-PTSD Vietnam Vet father briliantly played by one of the many local & amateur actors who make this film so great) of the film and whose skills as cinematographer, etc., would only grow more refined as his career progressed along with VanBebber's.

So if you love exremely violent, action-packed, gritty independent films then DEADBEAT AT DAWN is a MUST SEE film. It's one of those rare films that has SO many different sequences and pieces of dialogue that you'll find yourself and your friends re-enacting and quoting the film after only a viewing or two. This is a true-blue cult classic of the highest order. SEE IT!!!!!!

Now to the release. This whole 2-DVD set is simply amazing! Not only do you get the lovingly restored/remastered DEADBEAT AT DAWN, but you also get VanBebber's short-films, most importantly the totally brilliant and mega-disturbing MY SWEET SATAN (a must-see bridge between DEADBEAT AT DAWN and THE MANSON FAMILY and considered by some to be VanBebber's greatest achievement, despite it not being a full-length feature), the sicko-classic ROADKILL:The Last Days Of John Martin, DOPER (a interesting but rather dated documentary shot in the mid-80's about potheads), KATA, and the very early INTO THE BLACK. There are also TONS of bonus features for DEADBEAT AT DAWN. Killer outtakes these REALLY make you appreciate VanBebber as a stunt-man...wow), a great (but too short) feature documentary about the film, called DAD: HALF-DESPERATE, HALF CRAZY, AND TOTALLY DANGEROUS which includes interviews with VanBebber, etc. There are also behind the scenes, still gallery, etc. Dark Sky Films did a simply marvelous job with this release and thank God!!! Because DEADBEAT AT DAWN is a film which has so much to offer that it would have been tragic had it been lost to time and VHS.

Quite simply, if you're a fan of 70's and 80's grindhouse movies (and even great spaghetti westerns like THE GREAT SILENCE, CUT-THROATS NINE, BULLET FOR THE GENERAL, DJANGO, etc.), independent cinema (like Richard Kern's early-mid 80's NYC short-films) , genre-films (from kung-fu to Italian crime thrillers of the 70's), etc., this release will BLOW YOUR MIND!!!! As VanBebber so perfectly and understatedly described DEADBEAT AT DAWN, ""it's just a simple revenge, kung-fu movie"". True, but one high on crank, grim yet exhilarating, and one of a kind...AS GOOD AS IT GETS!",1357084800,5,6381,5.155405405405405
7891873,5,6305334854,Jim Van Bebber is a director that will inspire you to go out and make your own movies! Once you watch this movie you'll want to watch it again and again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,1355616000,2,172,4.242424242424242
7891874,5,6305334854,"The last 15 or so minutes of this movie are 15 of the best minutes of fighting/violence ever. The violence is very realistic, and the use of the nunchucks is great. It is a well choreographed fight scene which has lots of VERY realistic gore and blood-shed. This is what a true fight to the death would look like, and it's not pretty!!!

7891875,4,6305334854,"Deadbeat at Dawn has a lot going for it.  As a filmmaker myself, it's hard not to notice things like stitled dialogue here and there or extremely low budget production values and editing that could perhaps be tightened up a bit in places; however, Van Bebber's directorial abilities and sheer raw talent manage to overcome all the film's shortcomings.  This disc is especially a must for anyone who is tired of the Hollywood factory way of churning out product, and it's always great to see something produced by someone who really loves and understands genre material, such as Van Bebber obviously does.

Having said all that, I really dig the scenes where the character Goose (played by Van Bebber) rips out the throat of his gangland archrival with his bare hands or seeing the character dispose of his girlfriend's murdered body in a garbage dumpster.  This is classic stuff.

I also want to quickly put in a plug for Van Bebber's latest, The Manson Family.  For underground, low budget filmmaking it's an absolute masterpiece.  I'll even go as far to say it's a materpiece, period.  I'd really love to see what Van Bebber could do with a multi-million dollar budget.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.  Oh, yeah, it's also got tons of violence and nudity.

Another bonus feature of the Deadbeat at Dawn disc is Van Bebber's short film My Sweet Satan.  This is hands down the best short film I have ever seen in my life.  Its production values and acting are also quite a bit more polished than Deadbeat at Dawn, although a little rough in places.  None of that matters, though, because the film has an undeniable power and gritty realism to it.  Jim Van Bebber plays Ricky the Acid King who takes revenge in an extremely nasty way on the stoner kid who rips him off.  This is definitely a must see, and the addition of this feature alone makes it well worth the price of the Deadbeat at Dawn disc.",1117324800,2,1906,4.594674556213017
7891876,4,6305334854,"Anyone who has ever worked in films knows how costly and difficult and so damn rare it is to end up with a good film after all the toil and sweat --let ALONE accomplish something worthwhile on a meager budget. And this is exactly why my hat is off to Mr. vanBebber. He has pulled off a tremendous feat here. Yes, the acting is far from great--but there is so much here that deserves our respect. It is easy to see how much hard work went into this film and, frankly, am amazed that Jim van Bebber was able to pull it off.

Give the man a decent budget--and see what he can do!

This is a far greater accomplishment than El Mariachi, in my humble opinion.",1116288000,4,654,4.141732283464567
7891877,5,6305334854,"The company that released Jim Van Bebber's low budget cult classic ""Deadbeat at Dawn"" had an amusing if slightly disturbing experience with this director. Several years ago, right after releasing the disc, you could go to Synapse Film's website and listen to one or two messages Van Bebber left on the company's answering machine. It was quite the experience. You could tell immediately that Van Bebber was less than happy about the DVD release. In a torrent of language best left omitted here, the director accused Synapse of messing up the picture quality during the transfer to disc. There were a few other problems Van Bebber had with the DVD that I don't remember now, but the whole thing allowed a rare glimpse into the sometimes tempestuous behavior of artistic types. And Jim Van Bebber is an artist if ""Deadbeat at Dawn"" is any indication. Made for under ten thousand dollars in the early 1980s, the movie is a massively entertaining action/crime film about two gangs fighting, robbing, and loving in the gritty back alleys of Dayton, Ohio. While the picture quality of the DVD might not reach Van Bebber's high standards-a claim I happen to disagree with, by the way-the disc is a worthy addition to any B movie fan's library.
Van Bebber not only directed the film, he starred in it as well. He plays Goose, the tough as nails leader of a gang named the Ravens locked in eternal struggle with the Spiders. A violent showdown towards the beginning of the film reveals in bloody detail how much enmity exists between the two groups. Goose challenges Danny (Paul Harper), the head goon of the Spiders, to hand to hand combat in a cemetery. As the other gang members look on, the two beat and slash each other before the police arrive to break up the fight. Later, at home with his girlfriend Christy (Megan Murphy), an argument erupts between the two about Goose's involvement in the gang. Christy wants a normal life of jobs, kids, and a house while Goose isn't willing to give up the lifestyle of a criminal. Eventually, love conquers the day as the Raven's leader agrees to change his life for the sake of his woman. He just needs to do one more deal so the pair will have enough cash to start their new lives and then he leaves the gang. Unfortunately, Danny isn't about to let Goose off so easily. He sends Bone Crusher (Marc Pitman) and another ruffian to Goose's apartment to rough up Christy and thus teach his nemesis a lesson.
Things rapidly go to far, as an action designed to intimidate turns into murder. Predictably, Goose arrives home, finds the body, and vows revenge against his enemies. He soon finds out that the Ravens aren't that interested in allowing Goose back in the gang. Aside from the fact that he left his comrades in the lurch, the new leader is working on an alliance with Danny. Only if Goose accepts the role as an underling will either gang have anything to do with him. This he does, but only so he can bide his time until the moment for revenge arrives. He doesn't need to wait long. Danny, a criminal with grandiose ideas, decides to use the two groups to rob an armored car. The crime goes off as planned, Danny gets his big bag of loot, and Goose exacts his revenge. He snatches the money right out from under the noses of the Ravens and Spiders and runs. Both groups now start searching for Goose, leading to a series of violent confrontations that culminate in the ultra bloody conclusion to the film. The last twenty or so minutes of ""Deadbeat at Dawn"" consists of one slam-bang scene after another, scenes guaranteed to warm the heart of the most fervent action film aficionados.
This summary leaves a lot out. I could mention the religious symbolism in the movie, or the film's unnerving and pervasive nihilism unfolding against the backdrop of a blighted urban environment populated by individuals with absolutely no hopes or dreams. The scenes between Goose and his father, perhaps more than any other, underscore the despair of life in the inner city. Christy and the love that she offers represent a flicker of light in this otherwise dismal picture. Her demise, and Goose's plans to avenge her, thereby allows him to transcend his wretched existence. Perhaps I am reading more into ""Deadbeat at Dawn"" than Bebber intended, but I don't think so. The last line of dialogue uttered by Goose is compelling evidence that the creator of this film intended his project to be more than a gory, shoot 'em up gang picture. Violence is central to the plot, however, so the viewer can sit back and enjoy watching the mayhem even as the message of the film slowly filters into the mind. Too, the acting goes a long way to realizing the vision Bebber intended. A few of the performances go over the top, especially Bone Crusher's misanthropic soliloquy on murder, but most of these amateur actors do a competent job. Yep, ""Deadbeat at Dawn"" is a worthwhile experience for the lover of low budget cinema.
The Synapse disc contains scads of extras, including a commentary with Van Bebber and producer Mike King, outtakes, a massively disturbing trailer for a film called ""Chunkblower,"" and a short film entitled ""My Sweet Satan."" Starring a creepy looking Jim Van Bebber, this little picture is the story of a devil worshipper caught up in several unsavory activities. Expect to see some extremely disturbing gore in this short nightmare. The ""Deadbeat at Dawn"" DVD is a can't lose proposition. Add it to your list of must sees soon.",1087171200,15,5473,4.708029197080292
