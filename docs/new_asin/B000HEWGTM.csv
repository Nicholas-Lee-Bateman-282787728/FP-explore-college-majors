8166897,5,B000HEWGTM,"Adapted from an autobiographical series of graphic novels chronicling the author's time spent inside the walls of a Japanese prison, ""Doing Time,"" is a fascinating look at the very unique way Japan's penal system operates.  Everything about it - the living arrangements, disciplinary structure, daily work routine, emphasis on hygiene and cleanliness, free time activities along with meals - is unlike anything you've ever seen in your typical American prison flick.  If the prison movie genre is your thing I definitely recommend that you give this one a try, just don't expect any violence.  For everyone else this film is still worth a view for the unique portrayal and commentary of Japanese society, along with an engaging storyline, characters and awesome display of the terrific food the prisoners are fed throughout this film (no joke!).",1204070400,5,845,5.2444444444444445
8166898,5,B000HEWGTM,"I actually bought this movie by accident, and after watching it I was very glad I did.  Great acting, interesting characters, and a facinating glipse at what life is like inside a Japanese prison.  It has an almost documentary like feel to it that works extremely well.  This sat on my shelf for months before I finally decided to give it a chance, and I literally could not take my eyes off it once it started.  Well worth watching, I truely can not recommend this movie enough.",1179619200,4,479,4.471264367816092
