8376034,1,B002OID4SG,"I only saw one disc in this set: Disc 10, the Korean War.

It came packaged with another, Disc 9, which is War in Europe with Walter Cronkite.  This disc did not function.  It would spin with a loud grinding noise and then stop.  At first I thought it was my disc player, but every other disc works fine; so clearly the problem was with that disc.  Be warned.

As for Disc 10, it played perfectly, but it was entirely propaganda.

For example, the chapter on the dismissal of MacArthur by Truman makes MacArthur seem a wronged saint and Truman a villain.  It never mentions MacArthur's intent to drop A bombs on and invade China.  Truman's statement, that MacArthur would have precipitated World War III is entirely accurate.  Instead of giving this background, the film shows MacArthur and his wife and son debarking down the plane steps at night, heads hung low, as though the firing was merely personal, and an attack on his family.

Another example, the chapter on the air war.  It's entirely a puff piece.  It starts with how great the F-86 was and is.  It never mentions how the US and company were surprised by the sudden emergence of the Mig 15 which was able to blow all their bombers out of the sky.  Then it launches into paeans of all the (largely obsolete) allied fighters which were used thereafter for ""pinpoint"" attacks.  No, they were used for indiscriminate attacks, as all bombing at that time was.

The entire thing is like this: rah rah all the way.

I don't know how the other discs are.  Clearly, not Disc 9, the defective one.

I would strongly urge anyone to check this out of a library first.

(I checked out this set, which was the only one available.)",1394323200,,1679,4.511627906976744
8376035,5,B002OID4SG,"These DVD""s are awesome !! I recommend any person interested in history or just world news to view these. It does some time to vew them all but differently worth every minute.",1331596800,2,175,4.5
8376036,5,B002OID4SG,This is a worthy war documentary for anyone interested in the subject. It is all genuine war footage from archives with interviews and commentary.  There is an interview with a japanese war spy in hawaii about pre pearl harbor activities and actual interviews with generals and those who were there including the incomparable walter cronkite who in addition to narrating the ww2 part is interviewed about his war correspondence experiences by charles kuralt another cbs great. The documentary covers all warfare of the 20th.century. This is a must for those interested in war history. Unlike other documentaries with some actual war footage here is a documentary with interviews of those wih first hand knowledge of what happened in the footage. I strongly recommend to get this while it is available. It is sure to disappear after awhile and you will not find this kind of gem again more than likely.,1293235200,9,901,5.006666666666667
