1876901,4,B000092T6O,"I liked the laid back feel it has.
What I remember most about the movie is the couple and their relationship. I like them because they are witty and strong, and they love each other in a sweet, loyal way that is the total opposite of the saccharine, phony romances I keep seeing in Hollywood films. They are grown-ups and they look like real people and they're charismatic individuals. That's a very needed break from all the bratty, spoiled silly, no-brain teenage movies the movie industry tries (to no avail) to force down my throat.
If it were a samurai movie or something, placed in such an alien and exotic place that your moral code somehow doesn't apply anymore, I wouldn't wonder ""Why am I rooting and feeling for a couple or payed assassins?"" But although it is placed in our world and our time it's like it's another dimension where it's OK for criminals to be talking to you about morals. They make me want to believe, which just might be the best compliment one can pay to a movie.
I would definitely buy it. And the boss is the giant in Harry Potter.",1069372800,7,1064,4.461538461538462
1876902,5,B000092T6O,"This has become one of my all time favorite movies, such a shame it never got the proper audience it deserves. The characters are great and the movie is fun to watch--with a feminist's touch. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again--just fantastic!",1331251200,,265,4.541666666666667
1876903,5,B000092T6O,"This movie blew me away. Perhaps it's because I'm a huge fan of Kyra Sedgwick in The Closer- she's a beautiful, tough but soft woman, and this family of thugs reminded me of her LAPD team. The relationship between her character and Stanley's.. deep, committed, no need to speak about it Love. (I couldn't help but think that once upon a time, Claire was a Kitty.. and he ""took her away from all that,"" and for this, she will always be indebted to and in love with him. but there's no foundation for that offered in the film)

John Ritter's appearance as the charismatic ""self help"" guru was brilliant (man, don't you miss that guy?), with, quite possibly, the best self-help advice ever (figure out what YOU need to do to make your life how you want it to be, and DO IT), and even though we love to hate Duncan, Philip Seymour Hoffman is an excellent actor, and played the heck out of that role.

I kept waiting for Kitty to have a Niagara, Niagara moment.. and I was not disappointed.

No, it's not set in Montana (although it never really identifies its location or time frame, does it? it's ""anytown, USA."" for all we know it *could* be Missoula, 2050. the story is timeless.)
But Montana scenery graces both the beginning and the end of the film.

If you can suspend your disbelief a fraction to allow for a world where people indiscriminately kill and maim pretty much everyone and there's nary a siren in response, this is a GREAT movie.

If you want to solve the puzzle,  you have to pay attention. you can't miss anything- many people don't like to put that much effort into watching movies, and for those people, this movie will probably be a disappointment.",1326240000,,1667,4.503311258278146
1876904,5,B000092T6O,"I'd been looking for this movie for years and had no luck because it was out of print.  So imagine my delight when I found it here and for a great price!  I ordered it the end of the week, figuring I'd get it in a couple of weeks, but it arrived the first of the following week and in the condition described!  THAT'S WHAT I CALL SERVICE! THANK YOU SO MUCH!",1314057600,2,357,3.9305555555555554
1876905,3,B000092T6O,Great cast and great premise but the movie lagged a few times and seemed to not know where it was going. Some entertaining moments though.,1283385600,,138,4.56
1876906,4,B000092T6O,"Critics usually use the term ""underappreciated"" for films like this. In numbers, it's probably true of ""Montana"", too, but not for those who ""know"". Never known Tucci to do a mediocre job and as the dying sharpshooter in this film he maintains his high standard. Kyra is a hoot: tough, loyal right bower to Tucci and (to an almost-fatal degree) to her undeserving boss, she's the right mix of velvet and steel. Strong cast (Hoffman, Tunney, Ritter).",1264550400,2,449,4.8441558441558445
1876907,5,B000092T6O,"The entire family enjoyed the movie much more than I thought they would. Definitely a movie to see for those who appreciate Kyra Sedgwick, Stanly Tucci, and Robin Tunney... Even John Ritter is in the movie.
Though it may seem like it's going to be a dark movie, humor is spread throughout to keep it light. All I can say is the movie was very enjoyable and we've watched it several times since it's purchase.",1235520000,,408,4.453333333333333
1876908,2,B000092T6O,"There are many weak moments here, in writing, acting and directing. At least it's consistent! At first the script is decent and the actors ok, but the director is bringing nothing to the table. Then the writing and acting start to falter but the director begins warming to his task (maybe realizing this film has NO HEART) and tries to spice things up with a few nice shots and starts blocking scenes more wisely. By the end, however, the mish-mash nature of it all took me nowhere.

There's not one character to care about, which is what makes crime dramadies worth seeing: feeling for people you normally could not. But here everyone is unsavory and if I don't like even one character, why should I care what happens to them? [Spoiler coming...] That they all die excepting one or two makes it even less pleasant.

The only highlights for me were Hoffman and Ritter, both of whom excel as sleazy bastards, and add some of the only relief, comic or otherwise, in this film. Sedgwick is weak and unconvincing and Tucci is better but still merely competent. Their romance has no spark and feels posed.

There are many many better movies of this sort around. Watch one of them instead.",1198713600,,1183,4.623809523809523
1876909,5,B000092T6O,"Aside from its refreshingly stripped-down plot, MONTANA is a pretty complex film. I say this because it works on so many levels, and is essentially impossible to pigeonhole stylistically. I suppose it's a crime drama more than anything else, but it's also hilarious, very violent, and not without a healthy dose of action fireworks.

Kyra Sedgewick is amazing as Claire, the only female part of a syndicate of hitmen. Her partner and possible love interest is terminally ill Nick (also played to perfection by Stanley Tucci). In charge of the whole operation is The Boss (Robbie Coltrane), and his assistant, Duncan (Philip Seymour Hoffman). When the Boss's mistress, Kitty (Robin Tunney) runs off, he sends Claire and his son, Jimmy (Ethan Embry), to go retrieve her. Once they find her, Jimmy attempts to rape her, and with nothing else to lose, Kitty shoots him in the head. This, of course, puts Claire in a very bad position.

Every aspect of this film is great. The screenplay (by Erich and Jon Hoeber) is witty, quick, very real, and devoid of convention. Leitzes's direction is down-to-earth, but hardly amateurish, and again, lacking any indie arrogance or MTV trickery. And you couldn't ask for a better group of actors -- there's a real chemistry there.

MONTANA is not going to change your life, but it is a truly exceptional film, and should certainly be unearthed from obscurity.",1090454400,21,1393,4.944444444444445
1876910,5,B000092T6O,"It is easy to see why this movie has with DVD reached cult status. It is John Woo perfect on the conflict between loyalty and integrity, with only two-thirds of the blood. ""I love bananas because they have no bones and I hate peaches, because they have stones"" - you gotta love it.",1083456000,9,281,4.320754716981132
1876911,3,B000092T6O,"I wish if someone could help me telling me the names of the groups (or musicians) who make the soundtrack of this movie, because I found it real great.
Thank you.",1072828800,3,162,4.258064516129032
7988612,5,B000092T6O,I had seen the movie a few years ago and it was better than I remembered. The price was well worth it.,1508716800,,102,3.6818181818181817
