8746302,5,B019ZQ8ZKG,"To start, I want to confirm that this blu-ray disc WILL play on a ""Region A"" player.  The Amazon description says it will only play on a ""Region B"" player.  It will play on both Region A and Region B players - though I do not know if it will play on a ""Region C"" player.  I tested this disc out on my U.S. ""Region A"" PS3 player and it played just fine.  The audio is only in Italian - DTS-HD MA 5.1 - or - LPCM 2.0.  Also, ""English"" subtitles are available on this disc.  The Aspect Ratio is 16:9.

As to the movie, this has become one of my favorites.  I had not even heard of this movie until I happened across it on an online streaming service.  I was immediately hooked and just had to have a copy for myself on blu-ray.  This is everything one wants in a good crime thriller movie.  The cinematography throughout was beautifully done.  The acting was top-notch by little-known actors (at least here in the U.S.) and it was very refreshing to see some new faces of superb talent.  The direction was spot-on.  The editing was flawless.  The pace of this movie keeps you glued to your screen with unexpected turns around every corner.  This is a brutal movie (strong sex, violence, drug misuse, language) but flows beautifully from scene to scene.  It is also very personal and emotional between the characters.

So, if you love films of this genre, do not miss this one - you won't regret it!  A lot of attention to detail went into this movie and the result is outstanding!",1515801600,,1477,4.324817518248175

8746305,5,B019ZQ8ZKG,"Set in 2011 in the port of Ostia (Rome) we meet a plethora on neer do wells from politicians, gang types, and just low downs caught up in a bigger plan. That plan is to turn the port into a modern day Las Vegas (I mean really!!). This entails  a gangster called Samurai in buying up all the real estate in readiness to cash in.

The problem is the politicos have a taste for young flesh, hard drugs, money and power which equals corruption. Throw into the mix the Vatican connection a whole traveller network of crime types and you have all the ingredients for a roller coaster of a film.

I thought this was superb, the acting and style were all seductive. The violence visceral and brutal  yet seemingly expected. It is one of those films where the time just flies by and almost makes you hold your breath. It has made such an impact that, according to IMDB, Netflix are making a series to follow this up, I am glad a that I subscribe as if it is half as good as the film it will be well worth the fee.",1473811200,2,1004,4.186528497409326
8746306,4,B019ZQ8ZKG,"""This is today. You were, and I am."" The ambition of gypsy and young blood mobsters saying ""no"" to traditional Mafia power. Does it work?

Suburra is carefully crafted Italian cinema that lovers of gangster films will find rewarding. It's even worth watching based solely on its merits of cinematography and acting, if you can tolerate numerous acts of violence through its course. Rome!
The plot involves an assortment of Romans, from high-priced call girls to the highest levels of government (and a Cardinal thrown in for good measure). Nearly none of the characters are likable, which doesn't sound too promising until you remember you're looking forward to their demises.

While the gratuitous nudity is an added bonus, Giulia Elettra Gorietti as Sabrina and especially Greta Scarano as Viola also have acting skills put to good use. Viola doesn't seem integral to the plot until you realize she is; while she and Sabrina are two of the wildest wild cards, there are a few other erratic characters. But 4 stars instead of 5 due to predictability, because at the end of the day we know the dog is going to eat somebody, and we know the most respected [feared] O.G. is going to draw his last breath before the closing credits roll. Although honestly, who doesn't like it when mobsters get their just desserts, and would we be disappointed if they don't?

A couple of memorable lines:
""Want me to get pissed off in church?"" (the guy asking is not a guy you'd want to piss off anywhere)
""If I'd had a brother like you, I wouldn't be a hooker.""",1463788800,,1544,4.711111111111111
