They are incorrect, the singer was Tony Christie (clearly stated in the credits) and he had a minor hit from this song in the 70's.

2090650,4,B0002F6B38,"""Dummmmm-dum-da-dum-dum.."" - the theme song. That's what I remember most about this show; that and Robert Vaughn feeding his dog from the breakfast table in the title credits and Tom Jones singing the song for the closing credits. Each episode is 1/2 hour long and features interesting stories shot in different European locales.

Gerry Anderson produced this show about a 3-person team of detectives and it has the same look and feel as the Saint and the Avengers.

Its better than most of the stuff on TV now.",1102464000,5,511,4.795454545454546
2090651,4,B0002F6B38,"Being a fan of Robert Vaughn from his Man From UNCLE days, I purchased this set on a whim at Tower Records over three months ago (why does Amazon say it will not be available until November?) and was pleasantly surprised.  These half-hour episodes are cleverly written and entertaining.  The European locales also add an extra bit of flair to these shows. The acting is good--especially Space 1999 alumnus Tony Anholt.  When will the Second season be released?",1093305600,10,460,4.871794871794871
2090652,5,B0002F6B38,"This is one of a series of British television programs that shared the same pool of scriptwriters and directors.  This series includes The Avengers, The Saint, Secret Agent Man, and The Persuaders.  If you liked any of these you will like The Protectors.
The Protectors is a high-class detective agency that gets involved in international crime and espionage operations.  Very much like The Avengers, the woman of the group, Nyree Dawn Porter, is very intelligent, resourceful, and attractive.  She was the first choice for replacing Mrs. Peel when Dianna Rigg left The Avengers.",1087862400,15,579,5.193548387096774
8027642,5,B0002F6B38,"Great DVD set of season one of the 1972 UK ITC Gerry Anderson live action series starring Robert Vaughn as Harry Rule (London agent), Nyree Dawn Porter as  Contessa Caroline di Contini (Rome agent), and Tony Anholt as Paul Buchet (Paris agent). The organization exists to protect those in peril, its members being super-agents from the world's best detective agencies. Every Protector keeps in close communication with his colleagues so they can draw on the collective intelligence and skills of these international networks. It is a private organization, unrestricted by the technicalities, which so often hamper the law. Protectors can break through handicapping legal red tape and international frontiers, their methods often being as unconventional as they are hazardous. Money is no object. The Protectors are expensive to hire and are called upon not only by private individuals but also by powerful groups. Those bodies employing them know they are hiring not only individual and collective skills, but also the latest scientific devices. Bonus features includes audio commentary and photo gallery. Must have for Robert Vaughn, ITC or classic TV fans!",1472169600,,1158,5.397790055248619

I didn't remember until I saw it on Spy Series Dvd Collection.

this series. I recommend anyone who love cool spy mystery shows.

8027645,5,B0002F6B38,"My entire family really enjoyed these episodes. Each episode is around 25 minutes and so they make for a fairly quick storyline which means no wasted time on sidelining and sidetracks. For an old t.v. series, they were pretty good and interesting as well.",1287705600,,255,4.818181818181818
8027646,4,B0002F6B38,"Not everything can have lots of depth. This show certainly is fast paced and entertaining and yet we don't really get to know much about the people in it.
This show which ran in 1972 holds up well as a spy show although we don't know who the protectors work for. They are against drug smugglers though and that's enough to tell you that they are the good guys.  This show aims to give you a thrill ride often and it delivers and it reminded me of todays action movies in which character is put in the back seat to the overall action.  Robert Vaughn of course adds his acting prowless to this and that helps as he is the leader of the group. His chain smoking countess assistant? , is as good with a gun and her fists as any man too.  So if you are in the mood for some face paced spy or crime fighter shows then you'll be ok on that level. This is no Callan though which is a realistic spy show but a james bond done in 30 minutes type of exploit. So on that level it deserves 4 stars for being well made and entertaining. but as others pointed out if  you put this on the drama scale it would probably be 2 stars because we just don't get any feeling for the characters often , or why things are happening. They needed a hour to expand this show and it would have been a really good bondian spy show.  But if you want fast paced slick entertainment without much depth of character like the flick ""shoot em up"" without the cgi and other effects then you could do worse. If you want drama then go someplace else.",1277424000,2,1511,4.1084745762711865
8027647,5,B0002F6B38,"After the cancellation of THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. and appearences in some successful films (most notably the McQueen epic BULLET), Gerry & Sylvia Anderson inticed Robert Vaughn to return to the small screen in a 30 minute action-adventure series. As Harry Rule he runs a small security service that takes on special cases. Carried in syndication in the U.S. in the early 1970's, it was a pretty decent show that was to capture in 30 minutes the excitement of shows twice as long.  A difficult relationship between Vaughn and the Andersons brought this show to a close after only 2 seasons.  Sadly both Nyree Dawn Porter and Tony Anholt have passed away in the intervening years.  Vaughn can currently be seen in the British series HUSTLE.",1222214400,6,738,4.841269841269841
8027648,4,B0002F6B38,"A 30-minute detective/adventure show? It might seem lame, but it actually works.

The Protectors are an international detective agency specializing in unusual cases: everything from stolen art, finding missing persons, or providing bodyguard services to high-profile clientele.  The three main 'leaders' of the organization are Harry Rule (Robert Vaughn), the Contessa Caroline di Contini (Nyree Dawn Porter) and Paul Buchet (Tony Anholt).

From a creative and technical standpoint, the direction is exceptional for its time.  Excellent camera angles, top-notch editing, unique visuals and exciting music to enhance the action sequences.  Many of the shows are shot on location, specifically Europe.  We get to see London, Paris, Rome and Berlin as it was during the 1970s.  And it's all 'for real' imagery.

During the 1970s (and before), women protagonists in television were presented as 'secondary' characters and shrinking violets.  The Protectors contradicted that sterotype.  The Contessa di Contini is portrayed as intellectually resourceful, financially independent and consummately adept at personal combat.  She is an expert with an pe, a shotgun, a handgun, and -- if the need arises -- she can disable an opponent with physical force.

The stories are very good.  For instance, one episode features the Contessa and Harry enduring a fake car accident (""Thinkback""). The villains of the piece are intent on 'tricking' the Protectors into revealing the location of a person testifying against a Mafia-like organization. They use drugs, illusions and false-doctors to extract the witness' location from the Protectors.  But the Protectors are resilient.  The Contessa and Harry realize the deception. They save the day.  During the save-the-day sequence, the Contessa rolls under a sliding door and utilizes a movie prop-sword to halt the adversaries.  So cool.

Wonderful entertainment.

The Protectors is a show that can be viewed on many levels.  30-minutes of compressed drama and action and international intrigue.  The most important part is that the Contessa is way ahead of her time.  She is akin to Mrs. Gale and Modesty Blaise (see my other reviews).

The world is filled with strong women.",1212796800,3,2210,5.4733727810650885
8027649,3,B0002F6B38,"Generally speaking, if you enjoy British spy shows like ""The Saint"" and ""The Avengers"", you will probably enjoy this series.  However, the 30 minute format of the series precludes any significant character or plot development, and ultimately results in a less than satisfying result.  There are a few stories which extend to two episodes, but they are so few that they do not make up for the limited development of the other episodes in the series.

I'd suggest sticking with the one hour format shows.",1186963200,,502,4.882352941176471
8027650,2,B0002F6B38,"""The Protectors"" was a British television show (ITC) back in 1972-74. It was an attempt to capture the spirit of ""The Avengers"" and ""The Saint"", and to capitalize on Robert Vaughn's fading ""The Man From UNCLE"" popularity.

The best part of the show was its catchy ""Avenues and Alleyways"" theme song played at the beginning and ending of each 24-minute episode. New viewers will find even 24 minutes too long as the low budget and lack of talent (both writing and acting) doom things from an entertainment perspective, unless you can find unintended humor in the idea of an action adventure show in which action and adventure are conspicuously absent.

Vaughn plays Harry Rule, a member of a three-person team of freelance troubleshooters based in Europe. A fair amount of each 24-minute episode is taken up by scenic ""establishment"" shots to make it appear that the show was produced on location in a variety of exotic European locales.

Harry appears to be the leader of the group, if only because he has the most screen time (although slightly less than the amount devoted to the establishing shots). Tony Anholt plays the gadget guy (today he would be the team nerd). He is definitely a third wheel, rarely starring in an episode and by the second season rarely even appearing.

My theory is that ""The Protectors' target audience was nursing home residents with bad hearts, who wanted to see a secret agent type show but could not survive exposure to things like action, suspense, humor and hot romance.

Which is about the only way to account for the casting of Myree Dawn Porter as a character called the Contessa di Contini. Despite her exotic name, the Contessa was about as antiseptic and sterile as a wax figure. It is likely that the character was meant to be a slightly more sophisticated version of Emma Peale, but the Contessa avoids all action and contributes nothing in the humor, parody, or seduction departments.

Since the popularity of this type of show requires a fair degree of sensual energy, the nursing home explanation is the only way to account for the casting of an actress in her late 30's, especially one clearly showing a lot of mileage. She was certainly no Alexandra Bastedo (""The Champions"") and the show's frequent close-ups of her face were not a good idea.

If you have nothing better to do than watch this series, watch for the absence of young attractive actresses (a staple of every Saint and UNCLE episode) as villains or heroines. Apparently Porter had a contract clause specifying that no ""featured"" actress could be younger than her; and they wonder why these things don't get better ratings.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1169164800,3,2682,4.802603036876356
8027651,3,B0002F6B38,"This wins honors for doing as much with a 30-minute segment as any retro chic secret agent thriller can.  But while fast action, variegated plots and European settings are all to its credit, its improbability and inability to develop depth of any kind relegates it to something recommended primarily for aficionados of Man from UNCLE or of Robert Vaughn.  Others seeking spy or crime thrillers might look to other items I have reviewed, either American or British.",1162252800,7,464,5.012987012987013
