7864954,5,6304189559,I've watched this Christmas movie since I don't know when at Christmas time. The story follows a young bear and fox that accidentally board a freight train and are taken to the city. Santa then has to take them home in time for Christmas Eve. It's one of those cute ones you take out year after year.,1164844800,,300,4.280701754385965
