8450526,5,B004ZYXI60,"Paul Baloche is one of the leading writers and performers of worship music alive, and has been since 1992. His heart for leading people into worship is genuine, and his passion for helping people develop comes through in this collection of videos. Every song from the 2009 recording ""Glorious"" is taught through a detailed and professionally recorded instructional video, complete with real time chord diagrams. Also included are extensive interviews with Paul and his band mates, as well as live recordings of some of the songs. Highly recommended for worship guitarists.",1465862400,,572,5.2967032967032965
