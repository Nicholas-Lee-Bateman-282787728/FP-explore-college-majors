8287119,4,B001CDFY6O,"FEAST (2005) is a really terrifying bloodbath of a dark comedy, one that's a perfect Halloween season film. Frame for frame, it just may be the goriest, grossest picture ever made. The violence is unrelenting!

I love this one's humorous touches, like freeze-framing on each character to put up a spoof bio on them. At the very start of the film, the hunky one identified as ""HERO, LIFE EXPECTANCY: Pretty effin' good!"" comes bursting into this rundown desert tavern and tells everyone present to prepare for an attack from flesh eating monsters.

He shows them a trophy: this ghastly, alien-looking head with a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth. ""Bartender"" (Clu Gulager) asks, ""Who the hell are you?"" as Hero backs towards a window. ""I'm the guy that's gonna save your ass!"" he declares, back to the wall. A creature reaches through the open window, and our hero with a darn good life expectancy has his head bit right off. Arterial blood soaks the room as the headless corpse teeters on its feet then falls over.

That's just the start of the fun!

Obviously, this Wes Craven-produced movie is not for the squeamish or anyone wishing to avoid having frightful nightmares. For the rest of us scary picture fans, FEAST is exactly what its name implies: a smrgsbord of mayhem that offers no logic or explanations and spares the lives of few of its participants. It's gut-level entertainment of the most basic sort: kill or be killed, and get the hell out if you can!
