8414025,2,B0009OHBQ8,"The title of this review pretty much says it all.

The print Critic's Choice uses for Way Down South, a remarkable film by the way, is passable - barely.  The print for Fisherman's Warf, a really nice movie, is an embarrassment.  It's nothing but splice cut.  ""Digitally Remastered"" my eye!

My advice is to seek out other DVD copies of these great movies.  In the long run the few dollars more you'd spend would be worth it. They are worth having, just not from Critic's Choice.  I'll never buy another Critic's Choice DVD again.",1202601600,3,530,4.574468085106383
8414026,4,B0009OHBQ8,"Bobby Breen had a stellar (if brief) movie career: eight starring roles from 1936 to '39, plus one final 1942 appearance (in ""Johnny Doughboy"") along with other former child phenoms Jane Withers, Spanky McFarland and Alfalfa Switzer. In his youthful prime, Bobby was the most famous boy singer of the 1930s, performing songs in English, French, Italian and Spanish.

The soprano-voiced Canadian-born Breen got his start in nightclubs at age 7, appeared on the Eddie Cantor radio show in 1936 and quickly moved on to Hollywood. Four short years later with the onset of puberty, Bobby suffered the fate of many child stars-- his remarkable career was virtually over. In 1967, the Beatles used his image in their celebrity collage on the ""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album cover.

BOBBY BREEN Double Feature, Vol. 3 contains Bobby's sixth and seventh movies.
