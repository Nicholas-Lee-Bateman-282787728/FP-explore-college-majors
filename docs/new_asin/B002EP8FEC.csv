8367979,5,B002EP8FEC,"Lots of complex characters and character development.  I liked that the bodyguard Leung was quiet and watchful and that his charge Chloe was portrayed as an every day person.  Even the son Yuen, whom I at first detested, developed.  The acting was well done, and I cared about these characters.  I found the fight sequences amazing.  Some plot points were glossed over a bit, but that did not affect my enjoyment of the film, which was shot on location in Hong Kong and the UK and in the Cantonese and English languages.

Overall rich in detail, performance, and action.  I highly recommend it, though not for children.  The R rating is relevant.",1441238400,,646,4.705357142857143
