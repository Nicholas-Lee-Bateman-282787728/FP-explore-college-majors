1342438,3,B00004REJJ,"This film has got a really bad reputation, but mostly cause the people that criticize it is used to see hollywood megabudget movies like Gladiator and Pearl Harbor. But we, who are familiar with the work of Jess Franco and Eurocine, won't be that surprised. Ok, the theme is not sex in this film, it's a typical lowbudget zombie slasher of the early 80's. And in fact it's really good. Mostly cause it's shot on location and using real people in the crowd scenes in the city (some of them looking into the cameralens). That almost gives the film some weird, crude and spontaneous documentary feeling in contrast with the obvious sets and photomodel actors in films like the Scream trilogy. The special effects are not that good, but much better than Zombie Lakes. The strange organ music in the film also adds to the weird atmosphere. It's hard to know how many stars I should give this film. The script is very stupid and the film look like it was made in a few days, but at the same time it's very entertaining and much more fun than the Friday the 13th series or the Scream trilogy. Well worth a look if you are a Jess Franco fan. Other people will probably just hate it.",993600000,3,1174,4.439814814814815

Its Francos cheap idea of a Zombie film. I am a franco fan and just had to have it so its worth buying if your a fan of the man.

1342493,5,B00004REJJ,"Jess Franco must be one of the most frustrating directors I know: every time when I think I should just give up on him after sitting through three of four atrocious pictures, you get something like `Oasis of the Zombies', which makes you realize just why you sat through the previous duds. There's no director more unreliable than Franco, but when you think about it this may not be so strange after all. When you look at even the most talented directors in the world, like Sternberg, Hitchcock or Fellini, in the end they didn't make more than, say 10-20 films that were really great, if that. So it's obviously not fair to expect something else from Jess Franco and the only problem is of course he made so many of them!  The sifting through can be rather tiresome at times, but I suppose it goes with the territory and ultimately makes those few pearls all the more satisfying.

Watching this immediately after `Zombie Lake', the first thing that really surprised me was that this blu-ray looks even better than the Rollin and I still can't believe how good this actually looks! From the rich vibrant colors of the beginning to the muted browns and grays of the unforgettable climax, this is a very consistent and pleasing transfer, making it one of Franco's most satisfying movies on a purely visual level. My favorite Franco movies tend to be his more abstract and meditative ones (think `Succubus', `Countess Perverse' or `Macumba Sexual'), so this is just my cup of tea. I realize however that I always seem to be one of the few who see it this way, as most people seem to hate precisely those movies I tend to love, and `Oasis of the Zombies' seems to be no exception.

Part of the problem seems to lie in expectation patterns and what you could term esthetic baggage: people always have a hard time swallowing a movie when it doesn't conform to what it seemed to be on the surface. Besides that, I've always found a well-developed sense of avant-garde or experimental film has served me extremely well when watching exploitation, because it makes it so much easier to wrap your head around the more abstract ones when you realize a movie is so much more than just drama, story or action. I'm not at all saying exploitation and the avant-garde are one and the same, but I am saying they are often much more closely linked than most people seem to notice, especially because they find common ground in their mostly limited budgets and often the willingness to go much further than mainstream cinema would ever tolerate. The line between exploitation and avant-garde is so often perilously thin.

Which would already explain the limited appeal of something like `Oasis of the Zombies', because people would be much better served to approach this movie as more in the spirit of, say, Nathaniel Dorsky than George Romero. One of the most obvious signifiers Franco is not looking to make `just' another zombie movie, is his use of fragments from another movie. He rather obviously uses whole stretches of some big budget war movie, which in spirit seems to be much closer to the avant-garde practice of found-footage than it is to the common Hollywood trait of using stock footage. Rollin uses it too in `Zombie Lake', and while both his and Franco's use of borrowed material are obviously motivated by economic factors, they result in something quite different: in `Zombie Lake' the cut between the stock footage and his own is just jarring, because it never even comes close to matching. The same goes for Franco, but he goes one step further and pushes it to delirious extremes, giving the movie something of an instant feeling of termite art - to borrow Manny Farber's famous phrase. The result is much closer to Gustav Deutsch's `Film Ist.' than it is to Ed Wood.

The rest of the movie is such an obvious Zen-like meditation on the genre than it is a straightforward zombie flick and I think it would be very useful to compare `Oasis of the Zombies' to Franco's brilliant take on the slasher film, `Bloody Moon' - both from the same year. In the latter, Franco more or less explodes to genre by pushing everything to its most extreme, while with `Oasis' he goes exactly the opposite way and seems more interested in imploding than exploding. He strips the genre completely to the bone, leaving nothing of the genre except its clichs and iconography, barely there except in skeletal fashion. It resembles a tabula rasa more than any genre film I've ever seen.

If I had to give a description of this movie it would have to be something like ""Nicholas Ray's `Bitter Victory' by way of Alain Robbe-Grillet"", which probably sounds very outlandish, but then again, `Oasis of the Zombies' is a very outlandish movie - in a very subtle way. There's more than a touch of Ray in this film, especially his triptych `Bitter Victory', `Wind Across the Everglades' and `The Savage Innocents' with their common theme of man fighting both himself and the elements of nature and the question whether or not to give up in the face of so much adversity. But trying to push this point too hard doesn't really get you anywhere, because Franco is either unable or unwilling (it really doesn't matter which) to truly develop these themes which I suppose is both his fatal flaw for most mainstream critics as it is what makes him great. As with most of his movies, `Oasis of the Zombies' is almost maddeningly underdeveloped, almost a rotting corpse itself instead of a healthy human body, to use a rather obvious metaphor.

And this is probably the most subversive (and most overlooked) aspect of Franco's oeuvre: his seemingly total disregard for his audience. Because a movie like `Oasis of the Zombies' begs the question: who was this made for? Obviously not the legions of sexploitation and horror fans who always tend to have a very hard time when something promises to be sex or horror but turns out to be something else entirely. If Franco doesn't deliver the goods in terms of tits and ass or splatter, but instead takes the abstract route, he's deliberately alienating exactly those people who form his fan base. But even as most genre aficionados tend to be confounded by Franco's more abstract movies, they are obviously much too sleazy or at least not `serious' enough for most lovers of experimental cinema. Which of course gets him in almost the exact same position as Alain Robbe-Grillet and Walerian Borowczyk always have been: that strange shadowy neverland between art and sleaze, which unfortunately so few people can seem to navigate. In the end, I can't help but be constantly reminded of Ross Care's very apt description of Ken Russell's utterly crazy `Lisztomania': ""a sadly dangling, brilliant film in search of an audience that perhaps does not even exist.""

1342494,3,B00004REJJ,"Once you become a Jess Franco fan and you try to view as many of his titles as you can find, you will discover many instances when he either believed in the project or just went through the motions.  This film 'OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES' aka 'LA TUMBA DE LOS MUERTOS VIVIENTES' aka 'L' ABIME DES MORTS-VIVANTS'- 1981 is a perfect example of the latter. This is the Franco film  which many Horror fans were turned onto and disappointed with when released on VHS by the Wizard label in the mid eighties and probably turned many viewers off to Franco's films from then onward.  It also belongs to a series? of Nazi Zombie movies that erupted at this time including Director Jean Rollin's 'ZOMBIE LAKE' aka 'LES LAC DES ZOMBIES'- 1981 and Director Ken Weiderhorn's 'SHOCK WAVES'-1977. The son of a Nazi officer who was under Rommel's desert army tactics decides to take a bunch of friends to the North African desert to satisfy his curiosity on his fathers demise. It also involves buried treasure which coincides with a sub plot involving a survivor of Rommel's army searching for the spoils also and whose party is spoiled when his digging causes the buried dead soldiers of the German squad to rise and wreck havoc protecting the treasure resembling the plot of Director Edward L. Cahn's superior low budget entry 'ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU'- 1957. It sounds good on paper but it is definitely a low point in Franco's filmography.  Releasing the film under the Eurocine label of which he directed some of his best work, here he is just merely slumming through the proceedings with only an occasional location site to wake up the viewer.  The film was released in French (which is represented here) and Spanish versions of which, unfortunately, Redemption does not include in this release which means that it has never been released world wide and seems to be the one to view because it includes Franco muse Lina Romay and Spanish actor Eduardo Fajardo in the roles played by Miriam Landson and Henri Lambert in the French version and is edited by both Franco and Romay. This Blu-Ray release is the identical version released by Image Entertainment over a decade ago and is much sharper and clearer but even the format cannot transform a sows ear into a silk purse. The viewer will notice that the desert scenes seem to be culled from footage to an Italian film directed by exploitation master Alfredo Rizzo 'I GIARDINI DEL DIAVOLO-' 1971 which as yet has not seen a digital release (and probably won't) and do not match the film stock in Franco's film.  The three stars is for the music score by Franco alumnus Daniel White who never disappoints.  The film can be viewed in both English and French with English subtitles and has other Redemption trailers as its extras. With mediocre makeup effects and poor continuity, this film is recommended for Jess Franco and Zombie film completists only although a Franco film is never a complete time waster for this viewer, however, if you have the Image DVD, it may not pay to upgrade for the price is a bit steep for the Blu-Ray edition .",1362268800,2,3070,4.684601113172541
1342495,2,B00004REJJ,"Two stars because this was Jesus Franco's worse movie and Grindhouse Zombie-ploitation movie. You wonder why this got such a crappy release and no improvement done to the film well that is simply easy because it was so bad no one really cares to improve the picture quality. I never loled so hard at the terrible transfer of this film, you would think the studio who had balls to even to release on DVD would try to improve something but nah, obviously it was released by some 2 cent studio. I would say watch it to see one of the many Grindhouse movies that was so bad that for some reason it was entertaining and the transfer I am talking about is from Around The World Film release.  Oh yes even the prime streaming version by Synergy Ent. is terrible (well pretty much most of Synergy Ent. release are just VHS copies transferred to DVD with no improvements).  So watch this movie for the LOL.",1344988800,6,897,4.430303030303031
1342496,2,B00004REJJ,"This is complete cheese, even for my B-movie standard expectations. The general plot idea here about an Afrika Corps unit being killed in battle while transporting some gold during WWII is not a bad one. However, everything beyond that point goes bad overall, including the acting, dialogs, connection between scenes, etc. Indeed, I tried hard to understand (without success) why we had killed Nazi soldiers returning to life in the first place. There was no betrayal or something like that here; they just lost the battle. So, you get slow moving zombies here, no running victims, some ok to bad gore scenes, and some women nudity. As suggested by other reviewers, this one is for zombie and/or Jess Franco collectors mostly (my case). Even so, I suggest you to be patient and look for some ""used - very good"" copy from Amazon (as I did) so that you spend no more than 10 dollars for your copy. Otherwise, you will regret it.

Technically, picture quality of this Image release is generally fine, with dark scenes a bit difficult to follow, and a few overexposed desert scenes probably shot near noon time. As declared on the covers, format is widescreen and running time is 82 minutes. Audio is in French or English, and no subtitles are provided. No extras either.",1332028800,2,1267,4.7853881278538815
1342497,1,B00004REJJ,"The movie is so bad that it even has bad cinematography! However, it is a must have if you collect these old zombie movies. Night of the Living Dead wasn't in Panavision either, you know!

It is a fun movie that you can watch with friends and make sarcastic remarks about!",1324684800,2,272,4.333333333333333
1342498,2,B00004REJJ,"This movie begins with some promise.  A couple of girls are wandering through an oasis.  We see close-ups of their behinds trying to sneak out from under their shorts.  The next thing you know, it is zombie feast time!  Then we see a flashback to World War II.  Germans travel to the same oasis.  Allies are hiding at the Oasis.  We see a big battle.  We see lots of shooting and blood and other war related stuff.  The director had an array of actual armored vehicles, which impressed me.

We move into the future and see the former German commander dying and suddenly everyone is after Nazi gold left by the Germans.  There is only one minor obstacle.  Nazi zombies are guarding the gold!

From this point forward, this movie is a lot like watching someone grind meat.  Only instead of stuffing the meat into the grinder, they very slowly move the meat toward the grinder, and then they very slowly stuff it into the grinder.  Yes, this movie is much like the awful B-movies of yore where everyone is in great physical shape and can run like the wind, yet the slow, shambling zombies with various body parts in various states of decay always manage to catch up to them.

Since this movie is European (I am unsure whether there was a particular country involved; the beginning said Eurocine), there has to be at least some nudity, and there is.  We see some brief nudity in the desert and then there is a somewhat torrid love scene.  I was thinking that zombies might eat the two lovers during the love scene.  I leave you to learn whether they did.

Before I forget, one line from this movie is highly memorable.  Near the end of the movie the zombies are attacking a group of college students (have you ever noticed how frequently college students manage to get themselves into these situations?), and one of them brilliantly says something along the line of ""Let's get some bottles and make Molotov cocktails, like in school.""  I am wondering what kind of school these kids attended.

There are some good scenes in this movie.  Considering that the zombie makeup alternated between some junk slapped on faces and full masks, the zombies looked okay too.  The problem remains that a dozen or so slow, shambling zombies managed to ""sneak"" up on healthy young adults and have people sashimi.  Another problem is that group after group go into the oasis, none of them getting the hint that the oasis has a zombie problem.  Many horror movies seem to work only because people keep denying the obvious until something bites, claws, stabs, eats, etc., them.  I should also point out that the movie drags a lot too.  I guess the naked women were in there because the director was running out of victims to feed the zombies.

Unfortunately, the few good or interesting scenes in this movie are unable to overcome the boring scenes and the general silliness of creeping zombies ""chasing"" people and catching them.  The plot has more than a few holes in it.  I know, you cannot expect Shakespeare in a horror movie, but at least some coherence and excitement would be good.  This movie gets two stars because there are a few interesting scenes.  Otherwise, this movie would be a one star movie.

If you are a huge zombie movie fan, this one might be for you.  Otherwise, I am unable to figure out who might like this movie.  Therefore, I can only wish you...

Good luck!",1315699200,5,3363,4.589915966386554
1342499,3,B00004REJJ,"Oasis of the Zombies is a 1981 film by cult director Jess Franco.  The plot is basic.  Somewhere in the desert lay buried a a fortune in Nazi gold protected by dead soldiers.  Chronicled is the journeys and misfortunes of those that seek it.  (No other story points need be mentioned as the details make no difference, here.  Remove the undead from this movie and there's nothing left of any real value.  It's flat.)

Still, I didn't think the movie was that bad.  I expected worse.

The zombies were put together fairly well; they had a unique look to them.  I'd compare a few of them to Grandpa Sawyer, if you'll allow the reference.  There were others with odd eye designs that I was digging on, too.  The zombie variables were individualized and fun to pick out.  My favorite was a man with bulbous fake eyes protruding from a damaged face; he looked startled every time he came limping onto screen.  My point here is that the film's proprietors clearly put some pride into their work.  It's appreciated.

Aside from that, there's not much to say.  The kill scenes are sporadic.  Some are gory, some are clean.  There's bits of nudity, (full), and the cursing is kept to a minimum.  It's your basic low-budget zombie flick without the heavy screaming and overacting that you sometimes get from the genre.  If anything, I'd say the performances were a maybe too melancholy for my taste?  I've never had my thigh chewed on by an undead soldier, so I suppose I'm in no position to judge, but I think I'd be a little more excited than this crew.  At the most, they peaked out at, ""alarmed"".

And there it is.  My review of, ""Oasis of the Zombies"".  But before I go, I'd like to throw in my three favorite parts of the movie:

1.  In the beginning, two women come across piles of Nazi military equipment and start messing around in them.  One gets scared, decides she'd better leave, and when they zoom in on her face, we find she has a slight mustache.  Win.

2.  While recovering from battle, a captain falls in love with, Ayesha, a sheik's daughter.  In one scene we find her posing while he draws her.  The sketch is horribly executed.  The man has no business drawing people.  He gave her a Colin Hay eye.  Double Win.

3.  In the final battle, when the zombies are closing in on the young protagonist and his friends, they decide to attack with fire.  During the melee, one of them yells, ""LET'S GET SOME BOTTLES AND MAKE MOLOTOV COCKTAILS!  LIKE IN SCHOOL!""

Nice.

1342533,4,B00004REJJ,"Someone already gave a summary of the movie, so I'll get straight to the point... This movie got lots and lots of terrible reviews, a lot of people consider it to be the worst zombie movie ever and it has an overall rating of 2/10 on IMDB, but it really doesn't deserve all of that hate... Sure, it's not very good, it's pretty boring (well, I'm patient, so I didn't find it too boring), some scenes last too long for no reason, it has a couple of goofs (some characters (the main character's dad and the sheik) look the same exact way 20 years later), the main characters are pretty stupid and sometimes emotionless (They don't really care that their friends die and they don't look scared enough when they see the zombies)  and it doesn't have any gore (Well, some girl has her guts ripped out, but it's not very graphic), but there's nothing wrong with the plot, the atmosphere is pretty creepy (when the zombies come out of the ground), some of the zombies look great and it's much better than Zombie Lake (ok, that's really not saying much, but still...). Overall it's a piece of crap if you're only into good filmmaking, but you might enjoy it if you like ""so bad it's good"" movies.

It doesn't deserve more than 3 stars, but it deserves more than 2.5 stars, so that's why I rated it 4 stars. I have to mention that I WANTED to like it though, so maybe that's why I didn't find it too bad.

This was the third nazi zombie movie the other two being the excellent ""shockwave"" and the ok 'zombie lake"", If something made money then jess would eventually get around to his take on the subject.  And he did that here with this one.  This was made in 1983 and the hairstyles reflect that but that was common back then. As you are making a movie for a 1983 audience so the zombies have way to much hair for world war 2 era soldiers but that is no big deal. This is what you'd expect for a low budget horror flick about nazi zombies: they protect the oasis and kill and eat anyone who shows up.  They did the best they could with what money they had and the acting isn't too bad.  This is a good one for a late night viewing. It's not great horror but it's fun enough.

1342540,5,B00004REJJ,"This zombie movie is according to most people one of the worst ever made and I don't agree.  I really can't get enough of this one, and I certainly don't mean this in any sarcastic way. As a mater a fact, I have nothing with zombie movies really, except with the teriffic punk-spoof ""Return of the living dead"" - and this one, ""Oasis of the living dead"" (as my own VHS edition is still called.)

So what's wrong with it then, hey?

Let me post the opposite question as an answer: so what's to be liked about this then, hey?

I like it's amateuristic-looking aproach: it gives you that delicious documentary-feel. This is mainly thanx to the constant neuroticly zooming-in of the camera; first it's irritating, I admit, but after a while it becomes part of that swinging cinema-varit style, and you start to appreciate it, that is of course, if you're on the same radio-frequence here as I am.

Then you have this wonderful eerie organ tune, which is as simple and effective as the theme music of such flicks as ""Halloween"", ""Suspiria"" and ""Phantasm"".

Then there are the sublime moments of quietness throughout the movie, in which only sounds of nature is heard, like wind or birds. Together with the locations, from worn-down houses in nameless sun-blazed town, to the dessert and the sinister oasis itself, it works.

And talk about music: how about that sound that can best be described as ""blood flowing through veins"", like some chirurgical instrument is pressed against someone's arteries. It's all clever stuff the makers came up with when they knew their budget (which was, I guess, no budget at all) could not provide them with a full blown orchestra - and thank God for that.

It's an overall eerie tone and dense, hot-blazing atmosphere here. The effect of all this is hightened by the zombies themselves who do not howler, scream, run, jump or act in any frantic way - they just emerge from the sand, they simply ""are there"" all of a sudden, and then they overcome, and allmost seduce in stead of maim.

The result is still death and mayhem, but almost in a hypnotic sense.

1342566,2,B00004REJJ,"Oasis of the Zombies (Jess Franco, 1983)
First, let me emphasize the good thing about this movie: the incredible score. Were it released now, I'd call it an interesting mix of trance and pseudo-ethnic music (rather like Muslimgauze, but with not as deft a touch), with undertones of death ambient and noise. But since those genres didn't really exist at the time, Franco was well out on the bleeding edge. If you must see this film, see it for the soundtrack. As for the rest...
Jess Franco has directed almost two hundred films in his long and completely undistinguished career (which, I might add, is still going strong, with two films released in 2002 and one slated for release in 2003 it doesn't look like we'll see until 2004). A large number of them have been softcore films. There's far more of Tinto Brass than Lucio Fulci around Jess Franco, which makes me wonder why on earth I'd have been expecting Oasis of the Zombies to be a decent flick. Oh, well, it's a Nazi zombie movie, and I got it cheap.
Yes, a Nazi zombie movie. I had always thought Shock Waves to be the only one of its kind, but it seems there's a whole subgenre of them (all inspired by Louis Pauwels' supposedly-nonfiction book The Morning of the Magicians). And of those I've seen, Shock Waves still remains far and away the best of them. But I digress.
In this one, the Nazi zombies are guarding a treasure in gold bars they'd taken from the Afrika Korps during World War II. The gold, however, never made it out of the desert; in fact, it never made it out of the oasis where the ambush was staged. After fierce fighting on both sides (`what? no one told me this was a war movie!""), the only survivor is the commander of the Afrika Korps. You know he leaves a son, because said son gets a telegram upon his father's death, revealing all this to him. So he and his friends head off to find the fortune. While they're gathering everything up, two other groups try to get it and meet the expected ends, along with a pair of coeds who stumble in by accident in the movie's opening scene. (One wonders why Franco has the zombies attack them before getting in a little gratuitous all-girl sex, but unfortunately, they die with their boots, and everything else, on.)
And with this mishmash of a plot comes one of the most boring zombie films ever made. Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals is a masterpiece in comparison. (At least Joe D'Amato remembered he was a softcore director while filming that one.) Don't bother, unless, like me, you have a thing for Nazi zombie movies. And even then, you're better off just watching Shock Waves again. * ",1072051200,6,2617,4.5210970464135025
1342567,4,B00004REJJ,"Two sexy, nubile half naked young girls on a trip to the desert wander off into a grave of supposed long dead Nazi's
(obviously awakened by the wiggling of bum's in tight sports shorts!) for whom they quickly become lunch.
Then in a rather lengthy flashback the story of lost gold and Nazi's is explained and a greedy young pup through his
connection with his father, is now on the trail of the lost gold.
Eventually he and his amigos arrive in northern Africa, to find the German Captain from the convoy of Nazi's, on the brink
of death, after he and his entourage were attacked by the gooey zombies after trying to recover the lost gold.
Despite warnings from the superstitious locals about the ""walking dead"", and the death of the German officer, the greedy
young uns are still intent on going to the oasis to find the gold.
Finally they arrive at the oasis and find some of their recent acquaintances slaughtered by the zombies.  The night is upon
the young scallywags and soon too is the living dead.  But, they pluckily fight them off with Molotov cocktails (which they
learnt to make at college!!) and torches (flames not batteries!).  At which the zombies graciously shuffle off their immortal
coil.
There are not many zombies in here, maybe a dozen or so, so it aint exactly ""Dawn of The Dead 1978"".  But what we do have
is a pretty dry and flaky bunch, with the occasional gory, gooey, worm ridden phisog.
Oasis isn't exactly fast paced, it takes a hell of a long time for the young gold hunters do actually get to the desert, and even
longer to get to the oasis.
These Nazi zombies must have rotten wooden limbs as a creaking always precedes their appearance, like 2 tree branches
rubbing together in the wind.  And talking of wind!  Though there is a lot of desert wind sound effects on the soundtrack, I
can't remember seeing a single grain of sand being blown about!
There is really only one gory death in there, where a woman is stripped (of course! It is Jesus Franco movie after all!) and
has herself promptly disembowelled.  The rest of the zombie munchings are quick and nowhere near as gory as this one
scene.
The print of the film looked quite good for such an obscure piece.  The lighting looked a bit screwed, though maybe this was
the fault of the dodgy ""Saturn Productions"", extended play video version I saw.  All of the night-time scenes were either
filmed during the day in dark surroundings, big trees and all that, or were shot when it was time for the sun to be going
down.  So there are a lot of shots of dark images of people in the foreground with lots of light in the sky in the background, I
guess this is ""day for night"" shooting.  Whether it is genuine day for night shooting, or just Franco shooting against the sun
I'm not so sure.
Not Franco's best but seemingly not the worst zombie movie of which ""Zombie Lake "" holds the title, but which, as of yet I
have not seen.  It's also not the only Nazi Zombie movie, there are supposed to be quite a few, one which comes to mind is
""Shock Waves 1975"" with Peter Cushing, John Carradine and an early performance from Brooke Adams. Shock Waves for
sure though is better than Oasis, and actually does have a couple of good scary bits in it, which well Oasis, I think, lacks.
Franco uses the pseudonyms of A.M Frank for director here and Daniel Le Soeur for producer.  Word has it that another
version out there (isn't there always with Franco movies?!)  a Spanish version, has Jesus Franco's wife Lina Romay, in a
small part,  and is seeminlgy a better version than the one I  saw, with better music, and a couple of extra scenes, which may
sound like total masochism, but it seemingly makes for a better film.  This other version is called Tombs Of The Living
Dead and is out on DVD somewhere.",1022284800,13,3777,4.46656976744186

However if you have a soft spot for zombie flicks and horror eurotrash from the 70s and 80s this blu-ray might as well as be a not-so-bad addition to your living dead collection. But before watching it, make sure you grab a couple of beers. Just in case.

Some crazy stuff you'll find in Oasis of the zombies:
- A jeep with two giant JVC decals on the hood.
- The (Spanish) plate of the aforementioned jeep tricked out with cuttings from the word VHS (from JVC decals).
- A map purportedly showing an Oasis somewhere in North Africa which is actually a map of the Western part of Spain. The Spanish-Portuguese border can clearly be seen as does some of the cities' names.
- No matter which language you choose from the audio menu, their lips - if they move at all, are barely going to match what you are actually hearing.
- The zombie depicted on the blu-ray cover not only is not part of the film itself but it is like the best zombie make-up you will find in this blu-ray
- WWII battle scenes shot in an oasis from another movie  ingeniously added to the film.
- A sex/love scene involving two actors with near zero chemistry between them.
- And so on...

In my opinion 2/5 for the movie and almost 4/5 for the blu-ray edition (at $19 or so it feels a bit pricey. I miss some featurettes on either the making of the movie , the Eurotrash cinema from the 80s or Jess Franco's long-standing career).
A reversible sleeve or a folded poster inside with a small booklet would have been a very welcomed additions too.

7920909,1,B00004REJJ,"When you go into a schlocky film like this, done by one of the masters of such, like Jess Franco, you need to tailor your expectations. But with this boring and muddled mess of a movie, you need to remove all desire to see anything even remotely entertaining.

In ""Oasis of the Zombies,"" the story revolves around a shipment of Nazi gold that is lost in a desert oasis during the war. Now three groups of people seek out the hidden oasis when it might be found, only to learn that the area has now become a cursed place, where the undead rise to protect their gold from any trespassers!

The premise is pretty hokey, but it still had the potential for some b-grade cheesy fun. Sadly, that doesn't happen. Badly edited and dubbed, you never come to care anything for any of the characters. From the former soldier who was there at the first battle and seeks to reclaim the gold, to the grandson of the sheik who knows the secret location of the oasis, to the professor and his students looking to find scholastic glory in the endeavor, you never come to care about any of them. None of the performances are memorable or even interesting. They seemed to almost sleepwalk through the scenes.

The insipid script gives you nothing to really hold your interest, either. The story of the grandson, learning of his true origins with the sheik, are built up in the first half of the film, only to be abandoned in the second half. So much wasted potential. And for a supposedly ""lost oasis,"" it seemed remarkably easy for all our groups to find. The whole plot is just a half-baked concept, that no one ever developed properly.

With this being a low-budget affair by Jess Franco, you'd think there would at least be decent gore and nudity to be found here. But flesh fiends and gore hounds will be supremely disappointed. There is only one small scene of nudity and the gore in the zombie attacks is almost non-existent. Even the zombies themselves are an uneven hodgepodge of special effects. Some look almost scary, while other are so obviously fake that it almost hurts! The one sequence in the whole mess that actually works, is the flashback to the battle at the oasis during the war. It is the singular bright spot in an otherwise dismal effort from all parties involved.

Low budget horror films, especially older ones like this, are usually a mixed bag that you need to take with a grain of salt to enjoy. But you'd need a grain of salt the size of a Utah salt mine to do so with this stinker. In the world of zombie films, this clunker has to be near the bottom of the barrel (and easily one of the worst films Franco has his name attached to).
