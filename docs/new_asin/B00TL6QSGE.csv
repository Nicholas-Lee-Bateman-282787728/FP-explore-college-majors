7012853,5,B00TL6QSGE,"After listening to these thrilling performances on my 5.1 system (Oppo Blu-Ray Player, Marantz SR 7009 pre-amp receiver, and Rotel power amp with Magnaplanar speakers) I turned to these reviews astonished to see all the complaints about compression. I was personally impressed by the contrast between the many very softalmost inaudiblepassages and the powerfully loud ones. Gergiev's conducting is intense and electrifying.

I don't much enjoy the shots of Gergiev's craggy, sweaty, grizzled face and his comically tiny baton; most of the time the camera is focused right on the instrumentalists being featured at the moment in a way that really enhanced the performances for me. Russians are famous for not smiling in public, and it was amusing to spot just one violinist who seemed to be barely doing so. But never mind, they play magnificently.

Rare coughs were distant and almost unnoticeable.

I wondered why the texts of the sung portions were not printed in the lavish hard-bound book that comes with the set until I realized I should just turn on the subtitles.

I have been an audiophile and music lover for many years and have built up a large collection of SACDs and Blu-ray discs. These sound just find to me, and I bet they will to you too. My suggestion: order the set, play one of your favorites, ad if you don't like the sound, return it.",1474070400,4,1355,4.852813852813853
7012854,2,B00TL6QSGE,"I love Shostakovich's music. One of the best concerts I went to was his Symphony No. 4 early this year at Seattle Symphony. The sound, the contract, the oppression, the irony in the music was simply astonishing. So, when I saw this set, I couldn't be happier. But as one reviewer pointed out that the sound engineers had basically castrated the music, it made me wait.  But after a few months, I thought, how bad could it be? I could always re-sell it if the sound is truly unacceptable.

Oh the disappointment for the sound dynamic compression is indescribable. It broke my heart, my spirit. The sound I heard from my home theater made me feel like I was listening to elevator music (albeit a beautiful one); FLAT. It was so flat the air in my living room stop moving (or maybe just my heart sank so low). I wondered where I was. I had no idea this got released!! I feel SO bad for the fantastic musicians, the phenomenal conductor. The camera work was great, the picture clear and sharp, the content quite thorough.  But the soul of Shostakovitch--his music--was once again oppressed; first by the Soviet and now by the sound engineers. Except this time the sound engineers succeeded.

You can't do that to Shostakovich's music. You just can't!  Yes we can still hear the sound coming out of the speakers, but that is NOT him. I stopped my blu-ray player and put everything back in the box with heavy heart. Shostakovich does not deserve this. The great Mariinsky Orchestra does not deserve this. (If there is a bright side of this atrocity, it's I can't wait to go out to experience and appreciate live classical music performances again).  I can't play these blu-rays again. I don't want to talk about it any more. I will stop writing this review now. Bye.",1469664000,6,1760,4.589171974522293
7012855,5,B00TL6QSGE,"Many of the capable reviewers on these pages are musical evaluation experts, performers or students. I am none of these and do not pretend to be. I am though a classical music lover from my earliest exposure to the genre around about nine years old or so, the early 1950's. I had piano lessons from age eight or nine, but, never really developed an ability to play well. I have just always enjoyed music. And my exposure began before the days of Stereo LP recordings and FM Stereo on the radio. One can only imagine then my impression of this Blu-ray collection of the Shostakovich Symphonies and Concertos. My serious exposure to Shostakovich began with the Haitink 11 CD collection of the symphonies and the Previn/Ozawa/Ashkenazy 3 CD collection of the concertos. However this 4 Blu-ray disc collection of the Shostakovich symphonies and concertos is the absolute pinnacle of the CD/DVD choices that are available today. Arguably no living conductor is a more capable interpreter of this music than Valery Gergiev, a Russian born and Russian trained musician. He provides a short narrative at the beginning of each selection assisting the understanding thereof. And the collection includes a 150 page book, not a booklet, providing much information about Shostakovich and this series of performances at the Salle Pleyel in Paris in 2013. The actual audio and video of the performances are as good as any that I have seen and much better than most. This was simply an outstanding effort to recognize the Shostakovich centenary and to acknowledge that ""beyond any doubt Dmitri Shostakovich was a musical genius"".",1468627200,3,1613,5.022388059701493
7012856,4,B00TL6QSGE,Gergiev is a great and I hesitate to criticize but I just disagree with some of his tempi.  Otherwise the recordings are wonderful.,1466380800,,131,4.695652173913044
7012857,4,B00TL6QSGE,"Great performances, so nice to get the whole collection. The percussion playing is not on the level of top 5 orchestras, behind many American orchestras. A great way to experience Shostakovich for anyone, awesome way to learn the music.",1458691200,,236,5.076923076923077
7012858,5,B00TL6QSGE,"This  collection of performances contains some of the best  Shostakovich I have ever heard, live or recorded.  They surpass, in my opinion,  Gergiev's previous recordings of this music.  The interpretations and the orchestral playing are just about perfect, at least to my ear.  Shostakovich has the reputation of creating massive walls of sound and whipping up the orchestra  to create  tremendous climaxes.  When called for in those kind  of  passages, Gergiev does not disappoint, and when the orchestra goes all out, the results are thrilling  But what makes these performances so special is the beautiful playing in the soft passages where a  a single flute or clarinet  holds forth or where two or three sections of the orchestra pass the music back and forth, and once again the results are thrilling.  The percussion sections are also quite wonderful, and the final bars of Symphony #15  are otherworldly.  The recorded sound in the stereo version  I heard was first rate and the visual production  never less than interesting. Lovers of Shostakovich will love this set.  For the newcomer to the musical world  of Shostakovich, a set of this size containing all the symphonies and concertos may seem overkill,  but both the quality of the performances and the quality of the various works themselves make the investment worth it. Recommended highly and with enthusiasm .",1453075200,3,1378,5.085201793721973
7012859,5,B00TL6QSGE,"I have now had the opportunity to listen to all the music in this bluray box set, and I am frankly astonished at the carping both on this site and Amazon UK  regarding the dynamic range of these recordings. I have neve attended a live concert featuring any of these works, but I do have full symphony set by Rudolf Barshai, plus various single discs of certain symphonies. I also have blu rays of Nelsons playing #8 and Sado doing #5. The latter has louder climaxes than Gergiev's #5, but I find Gergiev's interpretation less hysterical than Sado's.

So i figure there's about 16 hours of music in this set. Even if there are two or three works here that don't pass muster, how can you complain? It's not like there are any rival video sets of all the symphonies plus six concerti! Let alone anything by a conductor who understands this music better than Gergiev.

You can now buy this box for between $125 and $145 depending on the day from Amazon. I picked up mine used (mint) for $90. Keep yours eyes open.

I know I heard most of this stuff years ago in my vinyl days, but not with this sound. Don't let the purists or those pefectionist audiophiles talk you out of this music. I'm not a crazy $25000 audiophile, but my set-up is a halfway decent  NAD surround receiver, top level Mirage speakers and Samsung player, going into a 50"" Sharp TV so I have about $4000 invested. Most people will hear and see everything they need to from this set.
There's not a mediocre performance in this group. Just try the first piano (plus trumpet) concerto. It's a knockout!

I don't know of a better bargain in the blu ray classical arena. Especially when most discs have less than 2 hours music on them, and some are even fake HD, converted from regular dvd's.

Buy and enjoy!",1448409600,8,1768,4.455108359133127
7012860,5,B00TL6QSGE,"If you have any interest in Shostakovich, this set is a must.  I own the blu-ray version, and as others have said, the video is superb.  Ive listened to these symphonies countless times, and Ive seen #5, #7, #10, and #11 live, but these discs put one literally INSIDE the orchestra.  This is the way to really understand these complex works, if there is any hope of truly understanding them.  The performances are superiorcheck out, for example, this review:  http://bachtrack.com/review-dec-2013-paris-mariinsky-shostakovich-4-9.  The subtitles lend an additional aspect of understanding.  Its one thing to listen to the symphonies and follow along on paper, but quite another to watch the singers, their facial expressions, and the words as they are singing them.  To me its like hearing some of these works for the first time.

To address the compression issue:  yes, Id say its a bit compressed.  Its particularly noticeable in the balance between woodwind and brass, where the woodwinds are just about perfect, but the trumpets are not blazing out the way they should.  Really, though, to me this is quibbling.  The overall sound is fineexcellent, evenand the only time I might notice the compression is in the really big climaxes.  With high quality headphones (Sennheiser HD800 in my case), this is a minor technicality and in no way diminishes the performances.  Why headphones and not surround sound?  I like to hear every nuance (and in this recording you canpage turns, microphone stand bumps, traces of mumbling by, presumably, Gergievbut in a good, unobtrusive, you-are-there way).  The surround sound mix is decent, but the stereo mix in headphones is, to my ears, better.

The packaging includes a hardcover book with essays, photos, and bios.  Nicely done.  There is also a video biography of Shostakovich using extracts from the performances and from Gergievs audio introductions.  As an overall package, this is one of the most impressive Ive seen.
Hint: I got my set from Amazon.co.uk.  Even with the currency conversion, much cheaper.",1432512000,9,2054,5.179331306990881
7012861,3,B00TL6QSGE,"This could have been the best release of concerts on video ever. The performances and camera work are first rate, and the timbral palette is rich and often spectacular. But, alas, anyone who listens to Shostakovich knows that in many of the symphonies the dynamic range is huge. The quiet parts can be very quiet and the loud ones are very loud. This has been compressed here so the quiet parts are not so quiet and the neighbors would not complain about the climaxes. (The 14th and the concertos are spared.) As a result the louder symphonies don't feel like Shostakovich.

The sound engineers' job is to ruin the sound and they did a good job here. Like most sound engineers they probably listen more to rock or metal than to classical music, and are hearing impaired. Would they care to apply the same audio-massacre to other staples of the repertoire in need of taming? Mahler? Richard Strauss? Wagner? The neighbors need to sleep.

I would still recommend this release because the camera work is so gorgeous that you can really see how these works are performed - you can't get this visual experience from any seat in a concert hall. I've never seen better video on any concert on blu-ray.

Update July 19, 2015: replaying these blu-rays has left me even more dismayed at the disaster inflicted by the sound engineers. What is the role of dynamics (degrees of loudness) in musical expression? Whatever it is, it is more important in Haydn than in Bach, more so in Beethoven, much more so in Mahler, and then there is Shostakovitch. I cant think of another composer where dynamic extremes and contrasts play a greater role in musical expression. The dynamic compression employed by the sound engineers doesnt rob the listener only of the satisfaction of explosive climaxes - it also kills the quiet passages, since they are boosted (made louder). Take the 6th, for example. Normally it starts loud enough, then the second half of the 1st movement should become hushed. The middle movement is an ironic scherzo and the Presto finale is pure low comedy. Its second half should be muffled - Shostakovitch says something here; that under Soviet censorship no one is allowed to express grief? Whatever it is, the dynamic extremes are an especially important ingredient in the composers arsenal of musical devices of expression, and is part of this works passionate language, that spans from the tragic to the comic. The compression employed by the sound engineers (not to mention other bizarre choices and odd instrument balances - why can't I hear the piano clearly in the 7th? ) completely distorts this work, as nothing is ever hushed. You can reconstruct Gergievs insights into this work from what the engineers give us, but it remains a disaster - this just isn't Shostakovitch's 6th. Its clear these engineers are completely deaf to this musical landscape and most likely to classical music in general.

8702193,5,B00TL6QSGE,"I am not a professional musician, but I love watching Classical Music performances, and while this is a rather expense box set, I must say that it is probably my most favored collection of not just Shostakovich, but of all of my recorded performances, including my beloved Claudio Abbado and his complete Mahler recordings..

8702194,4,B00TL6QSGE,"How dare that unshaven toothpick Maestro curse this iconic performance as he did the mariinsky Shostakovich audio performances? He's got the Midas touch... He ruins everything he touches!
I sold the mariinsky audio box set to get away from the Russian drunken fool's grunting and moaning and heavy breathing. It sounds like grandpa is coughing and snoring with every quiet passage.
With every change in tempo and with every tender Adagio; THERE IT IS AGAIN!
SHUT UP YOU SELFISH OLD FOOL!!!
 I would love to take that toothpick from his fingers and staple his fool mouth shut to stop the noise!
Something as special and precious as these Symphonies don't deserve that sort of treatment from an overrated Russian bum.
Why couldn't they have found some other director... ANY other director to head up this once in a lifetime project?

8702195,5,B00TL6QSGE,"Always a fan of the music, these performances added a whole new dimension in being able to watch them being performed - certainly no small feat! At then end of Symphony 6, I expected the entire orchestra to be lying on the stage panting for breath. Again and again the fairly young (and often very good-looking) group met the physical and musical challenges. I own a number of Gergiev blu-rays that I like, especially Prokofiev's 5th with the Vienna Philharmonic. Quite a character conductor, but I note that the orchestra seems to be in constant visual contact with him - more so than most orchestras I've seen. Of course his movements do seem a bit minimalist and they could be trying to focus on that toothpick with which he conducts (found myself wondering what he does with it after the concert - collect it, use it again, pick his teeth or throw in in the trash?). The soloists were all larger than life and fun to watch. I thought it was a great value (though I couldn't afford it) and recommend it to anyone who finds Shostakovitch's music a bit daunting.",1501977600,,1063,4.570680628272251
8702196,4,B00TL6QSGE,"Ive avoided buying this set until now, largely because of the reviews discussing compressed audio but finally did once the price was right.

After listening to the first symphony, I had some theories as to the compression issue which reared its head on the first big climax.  I don't believe this is simply a case of the French radio audio team not knowing what they're doing and applying heavy handed compression during the actual recording.  Not impossible, but very doubtful.  There are an awful lot of mikes used in these recordings and many were right on top of the musicians.  I believe that limiters (not compression) were set for each track during the recording process to keep all those close miked instruments from clipping.  I think this is the case because the soft sections do not seem compressed and because the smaller works (like the concertos) seem less affected.  In fact, the solo piano during both piano concertos sounds very dynamic regardless of how loud or soft the passage.  These recordings were made for a live TV broadcast, not radio. In TV, heavy compression is added at the broadcast stage.  That would make more sense to me than the compression being added at the recording stage.

But all of this is really mute for me as Ive been enjoying this set so much!  These performances are so engaging; so committed. Really fantastic!  I gotta say its one of my favorite classical blu-ray sets ever!  The audio quality for much of the set is very good (sometimes excellent) and my ears adjusted to the sound of this particular hall quickly.  Speaking of the hall, its not much to look at but there is some really unique (in a good way) camera work going on here.

The introductions are short but informative.  The included book (not booklet) and hour long bonus documentary are likewise excellent.  There is nothing else on the market quite like it.  Best bang for your buck for a classical blu-ray set of any release Ive ever seen by far.

Finally, any audio issues perceived or otherwise has nothing to do with the amount of material on each disc.  All 4 discs are blu-ray 50s fully capable of holding all the data without the need to compress anything to fit.

An exceptional set at an exceptional value for any Shostakovich enthusiast!",1501545600,,2262,4.719387755102041

Listening to this music puts you directly in front of the most spectacular orchestra I have ever experienced, with superb audio, videography, direction, and performances by those incredible Mariinsky musicians.
I have a fairly high end audio system with JBL 5.1 speakers, 150 watt per channel,receiver, and 55 inch TV. I have never experienced Shostakovich like this ever before. I have a large Shostakovich CD collection and he is my favorite composer. This set does him proud.
Prior to this set my favorite Blu-ray Discs had been the complete Mahler with Abbado but this is significantly better.
I can't imagine more perfect recordings of Shostakovich and how anyone could one up this set. Arthaus has laid down the gauntlet and kudos to them!
The audio is so perfect and anyone who says it is compressed is listening on the wrong system with the volume too low. This is totally demonstration worthy audio. Kudos to the audio engineers here. I do wish it had been 5.1 instead of 5.0 so I could have used my 12"" subwoofers but the tuba and kettle drums sounded totally natural. My front and middle speakers go down to 45 Hz and tubas go down to 38 and they sounded deep and rich.
And the camera angles were so much more interesting than those used on the Lucerne Festival Orchestra and Mahler.
I am SO glad I bought this set and I give it the highest possible recommendation.
AND there is so much incredible material here that it will take me forever to work through it.
The finish of the 15th gave me goosebumps and the 9th tempo was a romp like Bernstein's version and that's how I like it. I twitch at the thought of working through this set and really studying it.
