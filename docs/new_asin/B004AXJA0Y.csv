4312552,4,B004AXJA0Y,"Big Sur Celebration:  This DVD has some great performances and a few interesting occurrences that show the good and the bad of the era immediately after Woodstock.  All the music is very good and well worth the purchase.  The film shows the early signs of the idiotic presumption that all music ought to be `free' (un-paid).  This has the finest moments of `hippie' music, and shows the realization that the `movement' was as dead as a doornail.",1323388800,3,445,4.740259740259741
4312553,5,B004AXJA0Y,I was at this celebration and in the audience and on the road walking in the movie. Anyone else that was there?,1308787200,2,111,4.090909090909091
4312554,5,B004AXJA0Y,"Though the ""name"" isn't Woodstock...it's from the same time, generation, vibe. The footage I've seen (youtube) is more intimate and the vibrations from that day seem to leap out at you (imho).  The list of musicians also isn't as diverse as Woodstock, BUT there's a ton of collaborations and  a shared stage  (wouldn't you expect it at a hippie fest like this!) with among others CSNY, Joni Mitchell, John Sebastion, etc...So there's lots to like about this dvd!  I'm writing a review before the release date so...as far as the sound/picture quality...who knows, man...but as a ""document"" it is a must have. Peace and Love!",1297987200,10,623,4.904761904761905

4312557,5,B004AXJA0Y,Remarquable film musical sur ce joli festival. On y retrouve les stars des annes 70 au mieux de leur forme.,1376784000,2,107,4.4
4312558,5,B004AXJA0Y,I loved it. I  wish I was there. watching this just shows how festivals have changed. those were the days.,1367280000,3,106,4.3
4312559,4,B004AXJA0Y,"I would actually give this 4.5 stars - the only other video similar to this (that I can think of, though the Isle of Wight festival is pretty similar in its feel ... Altamont was totally different ) would be the  Woodstock video ... that one is a 5 star movie, and there probably isn't anything (of a similar genre) that can match  it, so Big Sur Celebration 1969  gets 4.5 stars.  I actually had never heard of this video until a few days before I ordered it.  I had been watching a documentary-like video of Joni Mitchel (who I consider to be unsurpassed as a musician artist of the last 45 years), and somehow (can't remember exactly how) from that video, I became aware of Big Sur Celebration 1969, in which she appears.  Since I missed her in Woodstock (I was there, she wasn't), decided to buy this.  Unfortunately, I never saw her in concert.",1367193600,2,849,4.403846153846154
4312560,5,B004AXJA0Y,"So great to see this movie finally in DVD format.  Much more rootsy and quaint than Woodstock. However, the spirit of the concert and the times is evident and touching.  I am so pleased that we can see the Gods in their prime in the holiest of places.",1360022400,,251,4.208333333333333
4312561,5,B004AXJA0Y,"I enjoy the music and footage of all the bands on and off stage.  I enjoy listening to songs by JOAN BEAZ, DOROTHY MORRISON AND THE COMBS SISTERS, JONI MITCHELL'S version of GET TOGETHER.  JONI MITCHELL'S version of WOODSTOCK on the piano is such so rewarding to listen to. More important, this version should have been a major hit.  Plus, I love to listen to JOHN SEBASTIAN and STEPHEN STILLS performing MOBILE LINE, especially STEPHEN'S guitar playing on his MARTIN D-45 acoustic guitar.  Now for the highlight of the film, watching CROSBY STILLS NASH AND YOUNG performing SEA OF MADNESS is such a pleasure to listen.  The guitar and organ riffs and harmony vocals bring this song to together.  Plus, them performing DOWN BY THE RIVER sounds a whole lot better than NEIL YOUNG'S solo version, especially with STILLS AND YOUNG'S dual lead guitar, the harmony vocals (especially the 2 part harmony of STEPHEN AND NEIL that reminds me of MR. SOUL), and organ by NASH.  This is a must have for all CSNY and  WOODSTOCK fans.",1353024000,7,1021,4.728813559322034
4312562,5,B004AXJA0Y,Wanted this for csny footage 5 stars Joan Baez very good as well  some parts ordinary but for what I was after fantastic,1335571200,,120,4.217391304347826
4312563,5,B004AXJA0Y,"This item is listed here as 57 minutes long. IMDB lists this feature (originally titled ""Celebration at Big Sur"") at 82 minutes. Did they really cut 25 minutes from the original film and re-title it for DVD release?",1333843200,,215,4.684210526315789
4312564,5,B004AXJA0Y,"I loved the whole thing, the only problem I had was that the audio was a little off from the video, not a lot... just enough to notice. I wish they would have fixed that. That one little thing shouldnt deter you from buying this however.",1328572800,2,237,4.173913043478261
8421152,2,B004AXJA0Y,Having attended this event many years ago I was greatly disappointed as the editing was poor.,1505779200,,93,4.875
8421153,1,B004AXJA0Y,They took this beautiful film and converted it to a wide screen format. In doing so it distorted the image to a point that it is unwatchable. Why would some fool do this to a work of art ? It was disappointing and a waist of money.,1482364800,,231,3.9361702127659575
8421154,3,B004AXJA0Y,"old grainy film, still worth se3ing and hearing these icons and inhaling the air of the '60's.",1442534400,,94,4.588235294117647
8421155,5,B004AXJA0Y,I can't even say the movie is bad for it describe all those historical moments very clearly in details. But you might not expect higher video resolution quality within.,1442448000,,168,4.827586206896552
8421156,4,B004AXJA0Y,"A trip back in time. I loved seeing the scenery, the people, the dope. Reliving my youth. Music was only so-so. There were a group of gospel singers that I didn't like which took up much of the music time. CSN, Joni Mitchel were in fine form.",1420243200,,242,4.170212765957447
8421157,5,B004AXJA0Y,Loved being able to see and hear Mimi Farina even if it was just for a couple of seconds. She was always very special.,1418256000,,118,3.9583333333333335

8421159,4,B004AXJA0Y,"The Big Sur Celebration was a much more low key event than Woodstock or Monterey and was attended only by a couple thousand people. Apparently there were folk festivals at Big Sur a few years running but this is the one that was captured on film. I believe Joan Baez's sister Mimi Farina was involved in the organisation of the festivals.

The film footage is a lot more amateurish but also a lot more intimate than most of the other festival films from this era but like Monterey, it mostly documents the flower generation at their nave and idealistic best. (Although Stephen Stills does manage to get into a ruckus with a spaced out punter.)

There are some memorable performances. Crosby Stills Nash and Young's ""Down By the River"" is brilliant.  Their Sea of Madness only a little less so. Stephen Stills doing a solo ""4 + 20"" takes me back to my teenage years. Joan Baez is beautiful as always particularly on Sweet Sir Galahad. For me the standout performance is Joni Mitchell's solo piano and vocal version of Woodstock which is just sublime.

The other great thing about the Big Sur Concert is the way the performers sat in with each in various combinations over the course of the weekend. Overall the footage is dominated by Joan Baez and Crosby Stills Nash and Young, particularly Stephen Stills who backs about every second act and duos with John Sebastian. Where else would you find footage of Joni Mitchell, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and John Sebastian singing together on stage (doing the Youngbloods' ""Get Together"".  The Big Sur concert captures most of these performers before they became superstars in a relatively intimate albeit outdoor setting

Other performers include Mimi Farina and Julie Payne, Dorothy Morrison and the Combs Sisters are an excellent if a little limited gospel group and Carol Ann Cisneros who sings beautifully in Spanish and plays a nice acoustic guitar. We don't get that much Spanish influenced folk music in Australia but she reminded me a little of Tish Hinjosa.

A great film that will warm the cockles of old Hippies or Hippies at heart.",1409011200,4,2103,4.825
8421160,3,B004AXJA0Y,A bootleg of an amateur movie ...an interesting piece of history in the beginning  of the career of Crosby Stills Nash and Young . It must have been made on Bell &Howell 16mm cameras. I knew it was cheesey ... I knew what it was going to be ..I saw it when it first came out... I just wanted to see it once more. Glad I got it.. wish there was more .,1404691200,3,350,3.7945205479452055
8421161,1,B004AXJA0Y,The disc was defective (shut down with a couple of tracks to go - it did it each time I tried) and I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning such a low cost item.  I did enjoy the portions I was able to view.,1396396800,,218,3.6382978723404253
