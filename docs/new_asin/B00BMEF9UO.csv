8570793,5,B00BMEF9UO,"This movie is hilarious! Joan Davis is great! Some will think it silly, but, that is why I enjoy it! I recommended this movie to my friend and her whole family loved it. She is searching to buy a copy. If you like old black and white movies, you will like this.",1410566400,3,261,4.038461538461538
8570794,3,B00BMEF9UO,"A B-movie but not a bad one. Almost like a western set in the Middle East before WWII. It has a lot of jokes, some funny scenes, but with its thin plot it's no Casablanca. Some bits are just confusing if you actually know anything about Arab culture and history but if you get past that it isn't bad.",1404777600,,300,4.101694915254237
