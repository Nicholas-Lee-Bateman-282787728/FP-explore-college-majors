5317640,5,B009D4SQEQ,So glad that they picked up this series and are going to make more seasons.  Love the characters and the setting is so much different than any other series out there.  Can't wait for the next one to be released.,1353628800,2,211,4.25

5317642,5,B009D4SQEQ,Once you see the first set you are completely hooked.  This series and Midsomer Murders are my all-time favorites and I am anxiously awaiting set No. 5. In the meantime I have watched  the 4 sets over  and over and find something new to see each time  If you love real mysteries these are for you.,1352332800,4,297,4.25
5317643,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I was introduced to Murdoch Mysteries through my Amazon Prime account.  I absolutely fell in love with the series and its characters.  Set in Victorian Canada, the TV show revolves around 4 main characters and their ability to work together to solve murder mysteries.  The program is a little whimsical, a bit humorous, and of course has a little romance, too; something for the whole family to enjoy.  I highly recommend it!",1352246400,51,425,4.861111111111111

5317645,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Murdoch Mysteries  is a very enjoyable 'period piece' Television series (1890's Toronto). There's a little history, a little humor, a little romance, a little scientific discovery (late 1890's style) and lots of Mystery. Yannick Bisson (Detective Murdoch), Thomas Craig (his boss, Inspector Brackenreid),  Jonny Harris (Murdoch's  assistant and partner Constable George Crabtree)  and Hlne Joy ( the coroner and love interest... Doctor Julia Ogden) are endearing characters and perfectly cast for their rolls.

We came rather late to this series.... and have found 'Murdoch' to be one of the 'best.'  It's right up there with Poirot, Midsomer, Foyle's War, to name just a few.  We've typically had to head across the Atlantic to BBC/ITV for good mystery TV.  Who knew that our neighbors to the North were doing such a stellar job with this series?  Highly recommended...",1350000000,104,870,5.291970802919708
5317646,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This is an AWESOME series!  Canadian TV has produced a wonderful murder mystery series that takes place in Victorian times, presenting social issues and lots and lots of early scientific methods for solving crimes.  The actors in this series account for one of the best ensemble casts that I've ever seen.  Our entire family views this series, over and over again, and we sincerely hope that it does not see cancellation for many years to come!",1349654400,116,444,4.815789473684211

5317726,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I was not prepared to like this season  because I knew Murdoch and Dr. Ogden did not get married at the end of Season 4 as I thought they would. When I gave Season 5 a chance though, I found I liked it better than some of the earlier seasons and am now looking forward to Season 6! My friend and I especially loved the episode about the invention convention, which was quite amusing and made you use your brain, something many shows today do not do.

5317846,5,B009D4SQEQ,"this series is such a change from other tv series that overdoes the CG, (melo)drama or sex and actually relies on plot. Placed at the turn of the century, it's very interesting to see how they show policing methods back then (yes, I know it may not be totally accurate but neither is the super precise accuracy of CSI!). It also is interesting for how they weave so many turn of the century inventions, inventors or historical figures into the plots. Did I mention ""plots""? The plots actually take into account human nature and their predilections, along with weaving in how the main character, Murdock, deals with real moral conundrums. On one hand the viewer is placed in the position of reconciling their modern viewpoints of ""why doesn't he go for it"" while on the other hand we're placed in the role of trying to understand how society was back then for a person of real moral character and how a ""gentleman"" would act. Very refreshing compared to modern series where anything goes.",1442016000,,987,4.710982658959537

We started watching on Netflix but since they only had 3 season we turned to you since they couldn't tell us when and if they would ever have the rest of the seasons.

Its as good as Sherlock Holmes mysteries, but Murdock is really smart in math & engineering. He creates new things to use in his investigations, including finger prints.

5317890,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This series is possibly the best police procedural I've ever watched.  Every week the mystery is first rate, but the added bonus is that the writers always take one invention or issue every week that was new in the time of the series but has advanced (or, in the case of some issues, not advanced) so much in the intervening 115 years.

The writing is first rate, the casting superb, and the characters well developed and interesting.  There is a lot of humor in the show as well.  All in all, I have to ration my watching if I'm not to run out of episodes to watch before they release a season.  Actually, I've failed that test, but at least I know they are still making the shows!

If you like mysteries, history, science, and humor you simply can't go wrong buying this series.",1432425600,,780,4.381944444444445

5317901,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This truly interests, entertains and fascinates me at the same time. Set in the late 19th century in Toronto, it is about a young Detective named William Murdoch.  The detective displays a ""genius"" when it comes to solving crimes.  He is most resourceful and at times will ""invent"" devices to help him in his work.  Along with the rest of the Constables and the Inspector at Station House 4 it makes for a most enjoyable mystery with a touch of humor.  Highly recommend it.",1429833600,,473,4.595238095238095

5317967,5,B009D4SQEQ,"A smart and entertaining mystery series with a sweet love story sub plot.  The series is well written, with interesting plots, and refreshingly little graphic violence.  The lead character(Detective Murdoch) is a reserved Catholic with an interest in tinkering with technologies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The way the director weaves the mystery, gadgetry, comic relief and a love story together allows for many interesting diversions in the story line while the ingenious murder mysteries unfold.  The characters are believable and while personalities are embellished a bit for dramatic effect, they are not overdone or overacted.  I have enjoyed every episode of this series and look forward to each new one.",1415577600,,727,5.342105263157895

Sometimes famous people appear on the show like Winston Churchill or Nikola Tesla.  The stories have a group of characters who work well together from the tough inspector Brackenreid to the comical constable Crabtree.  It also addresses some politically charged subjects such as abortion and birth control and women working with Drs. Ogden and Grace. Murdoch during this season loses this love of his life to another man Dr. Darcy Garland.  Garland is for the most part a great guy and difficult to hate.",1415232000,,684,4.921739130434783

It's a delight watching Murdoch solve a murder......and I love to see how they bring in and introduce the inventors of things we are so familiar with today.  Yet to them, they were brand new and they wonder if they can possibly work........and they do.  This is a great series and I have watched it over and over and never tire of it.....I catch something new every time I watch it.  The only thing that grosses me out is the fact that they don't wear any gloves in the autopsy room.........OMG.........can't imagine it......but I guess they haven't been thought of yet...........!  I guess you would have to say that this series is a cross between CSI, Sherlock Holmes and MacGyver.....!!!!  100% enjoyable.....!!!!",1409270400,,790,4.99236641221374

I love the background it gives on social and political issues at turn of the century, something we see very little of today and even though it is not a documentary, it has that flare of a docudrama while being entertaining with an excellent storyline that makes fans want more and more.  You also love the very believable cast and their different personalities.  All I can say is ""Great Series"".  I hope it continues for many more seasons.

5318046,5,B009D4SQEQ,"William Murdoch - the anti James Bond - a handsome but straight laced, devoted catholic dedicated to solving crime.  An avid reader and amateur scientist, William Murdoch anticipates future inventions such as sonar, wire tapping, a fax, etc.  At other times he uses technology not in wide use during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as finger prints, blood testing, etc.  He often combines forces with famous historical figures such as  Annie Oakley, H G Wells, Nikola Tesla, Arthur Conan Doyle, Queen Victoria, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Henry Ford, Sir Winston Churchill Thomas Edison, and others.

It's done with a humor and sometimes heart tugging pathos, but always with a good mystery complete with lots of clues and suspects.  Great fun!

UPDATE - I now wish that I and so many others had not been so lavish in our praise.  Amazon saw that something this popular should not be ""free"" with Prime membership, so they came up with an some excuse to get big bucks from those who are hooked on this series.  Well, I'll just get the DVDs from Netflix and don't think I'll be needing ""Prime"" any longer!",1408924800,,1115,4.765625

5318062,5,B009D4SQEQ,"MURDOCH MYSTERIES SEASON 5 BLURAY is still going strong with a continuation of the story-line from the cliff-hanger type episode from last season!

Again as with previous episodes, the story-lines are well-written, intriguing, with tongue-in-cheek nods to present day items and this time around Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) encounters Jack London, Henry Ford and Alexander Graham Bell, as he continues to struggle between his faith (don't let this put you off since the character isn't preachy or anything like that, but he is a Catholic and time and again -- because of clever and strong writers -- Murdoch must question his religious teachings because of incidents that come up as he solves various crimes) and sound reasoning.

There's also a shake up at the City Morgue as Dr. Ogden (Hlne Joy) hires an assistant,  Dr. Emily Grace (Georgina Reilly) introducing a new character to the already strong foursome core characters of Murdoch, Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), Constable Crabtree (Jonny Harris), and herself. Dr. Grace eventually takes over as the City's Chief Pathologist for Dr. Ogden who decides to open her own practice. At first, I wasn't sure if I would like this new character but it works and Dr. Grace grows on you. Also returning in Season 5 are Constable Henry Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch) and Dr. Darcy Garland (Jonathan Watton).

The gorgeous costumes and scenery is back and this season uses other locales that lend to visual interest (or maybe it's because they're showing the characters outside of work, which makes it seem like they're using more locations, at least to me) and the stories also have some returning characters/villains from previous shows who aren't part of the core group.

And this Bluray set has lots of extras!

5318122,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The Murdoch Mysteries were written about a time then all the forensic science we now see televised everyday was in it's infant stages.  The writers used a kind of 'tongue-in-cheek"" humor in their approach with references being thrown in about things we now take for granted.  The series is part romantic comedy and part crime drama with lots of intrigue and plenty of suspense, with intricate twists and turns that leave the watcher literally not knowing the outcome until episode's end.  There is no predictability here.  Not a series to use grotesque violence and vulgarity for the sake of ratings, the show offers all the modern conflicts and often leaves the viewer on the edge of his or her seat with plot twists thrown in when least expected.  Despite the occasional violence this is still far more appropriate for the entire family than a good deal of what is offered up as family fare on the US market.",1406505600,,910,4.734177215189874

5318210,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This is set at the turn of the 19th century with appropriately dressed and spoken characters, and terrific character development. The characters are fleshed out wonderfully so you want to meet them and find out more about them. It has intriguing mystery-story lines which often interweave historic characters into the plot line which I find interesting.  Often their portrayal of a historic figure has caused me to look up more about that specific person.  The science is quite accurate for scientific development at that time which is the best!  There have only been a few scenes in which we found the use of something that could not have been 'around' at that time period (and no, I won't give a spoiler!).  My husband and I are both chemists as well as we enjoy a good mystery; this brings both and does it well!  I started because I enjoyed Yannick Bisson in Sue Thomas FBEye and caught his name in this show; I continue to watch it for the story!",1404950400,,951,4.603550295857988

5318248,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The rating I gave Murdoch Mysteries reflects the satisfaction I receive when I watch this tightly crafted, intelligent and non-pretentious 19th Century series.  Each episode gives me a different historical/scientific figure or fact woven into the fabric of the murder du jour.  Murdoch is religious, without being preachy.  Intelligent, without being cocky about it.  And moral to the point
of madness with the ladies in his life.
The people around Murdoch have their unique contributions to the mysteries. The women involved with the plots are usually independent and quite bright, as opposed to other stories set in this time period, where women are portrayed mostly as defenseless victims.
I like the reliance, primarily, of brain over brawn investigations.  I like the compassion Murdoch shows for all concerned, without being a mawkish sentimentalist.  The supporting cast is perfect and add much to the tone and fullness of the story line.
I see no down side, other than frustration that Murdoch and Dr. Ogden never cemented their relationship.  But, that is just me.
I would recommend this series to anyone who likes a good period piece with little or no special effects, and storys that do not insult the intelligence of the viewer.  Each episode is a satisfying, crisp ride.  Enjoy!",1404086400,,1291,5.138755980861244
5318249,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I love this show!  Set in Toronto in the very late 1800s, Murdoch is a very clever copper who reads and studies and is fascinated with new inventions.  He uses them all to solve cases in a way that shows how new techniques advance the  world.",1404000000,,242,4.217391304347826
5318260,4,B009D4SQEQ,"I have watched all the seasons of Murdoch and have kept on going.  I may have to stop as I don't feel that the episodes are worth the money that they are asking for in season 6.  I  can only describe it as a cross between a British mystery period piece and an American mystery like Elementary because of the wit or comedic elements.  That being said for free on Prime, well worth your time.",1404000000,,390,4.16
5318261,5,B009D4SQEQ,I love the series and Murdoch is definitely easy on the eyes.  I hope they do a 7th season.,1403827200,,91,3.789473684210526

They have two plots their is always a who done it plot along with the romance of the detective with Julian the forensic expert who helps him solve murders.

Set in Toronto at the cusp of the 20th century Detective Murdoch uses the latest technology, often creating it, to solve murders.  Many episodes refer or often star a historical figure of the time Tesla, Conan Doyle, Houdini and on.  Clever writing and well acted. His love life troubled do get somewhat tedious, but that's a minor quibble.

5318290,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I truly love mysteries and history, so this program with its references to historical events and people really fits the bill. The characters are so interesting and have great chemistry. I just can't give it justice. You have to watch for yourself.",1402876800,,247,4.904761904761905
5318291,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Like the other reviewers, this is such a great series. Quality programming that one does not see here in the US, any longer.  If you are mystery buff you are going to get hooked!",1402790400,,178,4.235294117647059

are well worth watching, you will enjoy all of the mysteries.",1402790400,,140,4.6
5318293,5,B009D4SQEQ,History and Mystery wrapped up in one.  I enjoy it very much.  So does my husband and we don't agree on very many shows.,1402704000,,120,3.9583333333333335
5318294,4,B009D4SQEQ,I think Murdoch Mysteries is the best Canadian detective series. It's set in the late 1800's in Toronto Ontario Canada.,1402704000,,119,5.0
5318295,5,B009D4SQEQ,This season was the best yet.  The storyline just keeps getting better & the relationships between the characters are developing in an intriguing manner.  Very well done show.,1402704000,,175,5.214285714285714

5318297,5,B009D4SQEQ,I thoroughly enjoyed the Murdock Mysteries.  The plot line was always exciting.  I enjoyed the historical references and the inclusion of famous people from that era.  I am eagerly awaiting the time when Prime will include the next season.,1402617600,,239,5.076923076923077
5318298,5,B009D4SQEQ,These are clever and largely historically accurate from the checking that I have done.  I don't mind all the people from REAL history affected by meeting Murdoch.  It is very much like Forrest Gump and all the history he changed as well ... I think it is very cleverly done.,1402617600,,274,4.46

5318307,4,B009D4SQEQ,"I've been with this since season 1.  The characters have evolved, and unlike other shows, they have done a good job in the keeping the core of the characters.  Murdoch did have a big change and did something very out of character at the end of last season, but with an great reason.  It added something more genuine to his character.
The reason I give it a 4 instead of 5, is that they lost a little bit of the 'Murdoch innovations' that you would see almost every show in the beginning.  if not innovations of the time, there would be well know characters of the time period showing up.  Perhaps you can only have so many of those before you run out of well known  figures and characters.
The show still maintains the mystery of the crime in each show, with twist and turns and some great surprises.
One thing I especially like and have liked all along is the little innuendos about something that may or may not be useful int he future (their future), like a device that would instantly heat up food or coffee.",1402444800,,1012,4.3563829787234045

5318311,5,B009D4SQEQ,The lives of our heroes are still developing as they continue battling Toronto's turn-of-the-century criminals.  The use of before-their-time science is a fascinating part of the show.,1402358400,,184,5.814814814814815
5318312,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Please see my comments on the Murdoch Mysteries Collection: Seasons 1-4. And yes, the series is highly addictive. The only known antidote is another episode ....",1402272000,,161,5.230769230769231

5318318,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This series is one of my favorites. Each episode brings new characters and strange crimes set in late 1800s Toronto, Canada. Great special effects and an original, forward thinking take on how policies for today were created.",1401926400,,225,5.108108108108108

5318328,5,B009D4SQEQ,It follows a good story line that keeps you interested and amused. You don't have to worry about bad language. It is a series I would recommend to a friend.,1401408000,,156,4.233333333333333
5318339,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Season 5 continues the tales of Detective Murdock.  I highly recommend this series (all seasons).  A very entertaining mystery series.  I do fell sorry for Murdock as he just cannot get himself to express his feelings to women!!!  With all the insights the character has in solving crimes, his social skills are lacking.

A more sane caring Sherlock as well as a little bit of all the great inventors thrown in.",1401408000,,411,4.732394366197183

The characters are intelligent, funny, compassionate, it's set at the turn of the century a time when the world was changing and developing - the ""on the verge"" time. great combination of personalities that operate as a well oiled, protective family with all the dysfunctional elements. it's just fun. it didn't take long for me to become involved in all the characters and plots. clever. only problem is i have to wait for Season 6 & 7 to become available without an additional charge on Amazon prime. Either that or i'm going to have to move to Canada!!!!! good job.",1400889600,,744,4.643939393939394

5318354,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I was pleasantly surprised to find Murdoch Mysteries and have watched all the first four of them and I'm hooked.  I love the enigmatic  character of Murdoch---one moment shy and respectful and the next moment strong and angry enough to right a wrong.  I love the character of Murdoch's Chief and his subordinate sergeant.  The independent character of the female doctor---there is not a weak or misplaced character in the Murdoch mysteries.  What I loved about this series is---no explicit sex, no explicit or vulgar language--good clean acting and interesting plots.  Thank you to the writer and producers---I hope it is never ending....",1400716800,,638,5.145631067961165
5318355,5,B009D4SQEQ,This season takes Murdoch on an emotional roller coaster and thru the occult. Constable Crabtree and the Inspector have their own adventures and adversaries. The season left me wanting more.,1400716800,,190,5.366666666666666

5318358,4,B009D4SQEQ,"The series ""Murdoch Mysteries"" was a rather different mystery series from it's beginning, when a setup to demonstrate Edison's scheme for electric power is tampered with and a pretty model is electrocuted. Among the suspects--Tesla, who happens to be in Toronto at the same time with his competing proposal for electric power.

From there, the series just got better and better. Season 5 is perhaps the best yet (I haven't had the chance to see Season 6).",1400544000,,455,4.909090909090909
5318359,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The characters are well developed, and so much fun.  The forensics and stories are intriguing.  I especially enjoy those that include famous, historical characters.  The only frustration, common to this kind of series, is the long, drawn out love story between William and Julia.  Six years of on and off romance is about five years too many.  Their story could be just as interesting if they were married.  Check out Bones, it works!  Cannot wait until the next season.",1400544000,,470,4.8734177215189876

5318361,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This series is Canadian nice.  It tastefully deals with sex and violence with Canadian values of integrity.  If the same series were American produced, it would have chase scenes full of special effects explosives, and plots of betrayal portrayed as the values to be lived by.  The mystery plots are good, and deal with various social issues of today, but portrayed in an 1890s setting.  A wonderful series with great Canadian actors.",1400544000,,434,4.986111111111111
5318362,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I find this a very refreshing mystery series without the gratuitous gore that modern crime shows have.  Of course you see a dead body, and in the later series there are more autopsy scenes - but it is brief and you don't actually see someone being brutalized. I also like the historical aspect.  I have looked up just a couple of things after shows to see if they were accurate with respect to Murdoch's use of ""technology"" of the day - and they were.  I enjoy the four main characters and  they wear well over time.
I can't wait for seasons 6 and 7 to be available on Prime!",1400544000,,575,4.247706422018348

5318367,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Same rating I would give every season of Murdoch.  I appreciate each character in these mysteries.  It plays well in the time period in which it is set, yet it shows us what some ""forward thinking"" individuals could have foreseen for the future we live in now.  Murdoch is a man of morals and struggles at times (as do we all) to live up to his convictions.  Any goriness is kept to a minimum, unlike so many of today's popular mystery and medical shows (I like those too, just not so much gore).  I do not have any criticisms of this program, except I do not get enough of it.  When I don't like the regular television fare at anytime, I just put on ""Murdoch"" and enjoy my TV time.  Please keep this one among your selections.  Thanks.",1400284800,,736,4.282608695652174

5318370,4,B009D4SQEQ,I recommend this show to anyone who likes a good who dun nit.  I particularly like Murdock's use of science to help solve the cases.  The setting of the show makes it different and even more interesting.,1400198400,,203,4.45945945945946
5318371,5,B009D4SQEQ,great just as good  as the rest - see the 3rd review  wish there were more shows to watch-  my favorite show,1400112000,,108,3.8181818181818183

The character, George, is one of our favorites to watch.  He is funny, loyal and smart.  Great personality.",1400112000,,276,4.934782608695652

5318374,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I was not sure if I'd like this series because I've never watched Canadian shows before but I love it. I recommended it to my daughter and now that she's finished Season 5, she's having Murdoch withdrawal!",1400112000,,205,4.5675675675675675

5318376,5,B009D4SQEQ,This is an excellent mystery series that engages with wit and humor and no traces of cheap and tawdry exebition. In the Sherock Holmes type of tradition. Highly entertaining.,1400112000,,174,5.0344827586206895
5318377,5,B009D4SQEQ,This is a wonderful series! The cast is wonderful and have great chemistry. It is also wonderful how Murdoch thinks of things way ahead of his time to solve crimes like finger marks. It is just a very enjoyable series.,1400025600,,218,4.475
5318378,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Great time travel and even though you can't take it seriously, it is wonderful to see a storyline with Conan Doyle and/or alternatively a fake but very interesting Sherlock Holmes, Nickolas Tesla, Annie Oakley (last heard of in Christmas Story), etc. The actors are great though the main love line is tedious as they desperately try to drag it out but the actors are doing their best to make it believable. My favorite is actually sergeant Crabtree and his love interest: Dr. Grace. Of course it is hardly believable to have these gorgeous woman as medical examiners and all that romance (not to mention eating) in the morgue over corpses. I can see that they have appropriated quite a lot from Bones. But it is a lighter and for me a lot more entertaining series and they still manage to bring up important themes like the poor women's lives before family planning, but they always remain highly entertaining. The only negative thing on top of the main lovers being seemingly quite idiotic in managing their love lives is the super villain. I hate super villains with a passion, let it be Moriarty though him at least I understand, Doyle wanted to get rid of Holmes so he had to create an adversary worth of his hero, but here we have one who keeps on returning and I just wish he wouldn't. Superheroes bore me to tears, super-villains are even worth. Just put in the work to think up brand new stories for new episodes please. And one final thing: don't tinker with the hair colors of your heroins: Dr. Ogden's hair gets lighter with every episode in an age where there was no hair die. Please. Love the dresses though.",1400025600,,1621,4.593103448275862

The women's costuming is simply gorgeous.  But it's the characters and relationships that matter most, and they are top notch in this series.  The dialogue is witty, the plot lines are intriguing, and there are some compelling romances.  The perfect ingredients, perfectly blended.",1399939200,,425,5.461538461538462

5318386,5,B009D4SQEQ,Mr. Bisson is excellent as the understated Detective Murdoch and the supporting cast is well balanced.  The part of Constable Crabtree is excellent in its supporting role.  The introduction of scientific inquiry of crime scene investigation at the turn of the 20th century is not only interesting but also entertaining.,1399507200,,319,5.36

5318388,4,B009D4SQEQ,"At this point in the series, Constable Crabtree proves to be the most consistently entertaining character. He's also not a cliche - as second banana Nigel Bruce was in that series of Sherlock Holmes stories. By this season,  the writers are exposing - and making fun of - Murdoch's faults. You start to wonder if maybe Dr. Ogden should just get rid of all the men in her life and join a telegraph dating service. But the show is still good fun, the plots are solid, the history and nods to the future intelligent, and no matter how many suspects Murdoch interviews, none of them act as if they've done anything wrong, even when they have, and many of them aren't the least bit contrite when fingered.",1399420800,,700,4.511811023622047

5318406,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Season 5 was really a great series. It is hard not to watch each episode. The drama with the relationship between Murdoch and Dr. Ogden is the undertone, but the mystery solving Murdoch keeps the interest of the viewer. I like the introduction of early technology that occurs, and the occasional insertion of sci-fi. The ending was super. I would like to stop watching here, but my wife insists we watch Season 6, and more, when they come available.",1399248000,,449,4.69620253164557

The fiery captain, the ever calm, cool, and collected Murdock, and the sometimes amazingly astute or totally out in left field constable all add to the fray.  This series is good for the whole family.  I appreciate the fact that there isn't unnecessary cursing or nudity.  Everything is very well done.  They even touch on modern day issues, which you wouldn't think possible as it is a period show.",1398816000,,464,4.679012345679013

5318414,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This turn-of-the-century murder mysteries series is one to be commended.  Yannick Bisson does an astounding job of portraying a conservative, scientific detective who upholds the law while remaining true to his faith and beliefs.  Dr. Julia Ogden, played by Helene Joy, is the progressive female physician who's mission is to secure more rights for women, especially when it comes to contraception and family planning. At the turn of the century contraception was still illegal and Dr. Ogden's passion rises above the law when she is found teaching contraception to worn out mothers.  Dr. Ogden's stubbornness and passion for women's rights lands her in jail only to be persuaded by her husband, Dr Darcey Garland played by Jonathan Watton, that she and him can fight this together and that she must, for now, uphold the law.

This season is filled with twists and turns and returning characters from previous seasons.  Constable George Crabtree played by Canadian comedian Jonny Harris, continues to provide a light sense of humor and his child like beliefs in things unexplained bring a charm and progressiveness to his character.

I highly recommend this TV series to anyone who likes history and mysteries!  The writers do a superb job of accurately researching the customs and laws of the 1890s and I thoroughly enjoy how they incorporate subtle hints of inventions yet to come through character dialogue and discoveries.",1398816000,,1426,5.173913043478261
5318415,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I've been watching this show off and on for over three years now.  I wish all the episodes were offered around the same time but that can't be helped. I find it a nice change from most of the mystery shows.  I'm not going to describe the show in detail, others have done that. My suggestion would be to take an hour and watch one episode and decide for yourself.

My opinion, to be brief: the show does not insult you intelligence, it does not rely on over the top violence or gratuitous sex to keep your attention. It's a well written show with fine actors and great scenery (period piece).  For the most part it's appropriate for ages 12 and up.

Just give it a watch.",1398816000,,670,4.244094488188976

5318420,5,B009D4SQEQ,I just love this show. But I was disappointed when I tried to watch the 6th season and saw I would have to pay for it to watch it.

An ending that combines the best sentiments of the 'Murdock Mysteries.' I'll leave this series here rather than chance disappointment in future seasons!

Murdoch is a young detective in Canada who is years ahead of his contemporaries, while at the same time is very conservative and conventional in his private life. He solves difficult crimes with unknown techniques which he keeps up with by researching the latest methods from all around the globe.

By now the setting and characters are becoming very familiar but there's still lots to like about Detective Murdoch and his companions. I'm growing particularly fond of Inspector Brackenreade and Constable Crabtree. A new character is also introduced this season - Dr Grace, who is something of an apprentice to Dr. Ogdon. Some aspects of this show are still too modern for the era (attitudes and social mores of the characters) but presumably this was done to keep the characters and situations sympathetic for modern viewers.

5318443,4,B009D4SQEQ,"Coming off Foyle's War and Inspector Lewis (both of which I thoroughly enjoyed), I stumbled across Murdoch Mysteries and was instantly hooked. To best enjoy Season 5 from Amazon, I strongly recommend that viewers take the time to first see all of Seasons 1-3 (free on Netflix), and Season 4 (free on Amazon for Prime Members.)

The mysteries are fun, occasionally intriguing, but the series is carried by the evolving core characters and their relationships, especially the one between lead detective Murdoch and the city morgue's pathologist Dr. Julia Ogden. A very sweet (if rather slowly developing) romantic relationship ensues.

I say slowly because after four full seasons and ~52 episodes, even when they are deeply attracted to each other, difficulties & hurdles impede their progress. The romantic tension is so vivid that when they even manage a kiss, fans all over Canada (and the US) broke out in applause (so say online fan discussion boards). The moralities and strictures of the late 1800s are much in play here.

Detective Murdoch is a university-trained man at a time when Constables and Inspectors in Canada were rarely that. He uses his knowledge to imagine and even invent modern police technology, so viewers will see the early use of ""fingermarks"", metal detectors, matching bullets to guns, and much more.

Add to that, cameo appearances of historic figures (or imitators of them) like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes himself, Nicolas Tesla, Emma Goldman, and (again) more. Add for car buffs the earliest appearances of the horseless carriage? The early battle between gasoline and electric powered vehicles? And how about a road-race between the two?  It's great fun.

I've commented here on the whole series, not just Season 5, because I think that background essential for readers who consider buying this video but have not seen the series. For those of you already caught up through Season 4, you don't need my words about Season 5 - you're already hooked.",1397865600,,1992,5.07645259938838

P.s. I'm not a prude, I use to watch all types of shows. But after a while the drama and killing and everyone cheating on each other has gotten old for me. I wish more shows were as good and clean like this one. I believe our society shapes our kids.
Great job guys, I'll miss the show when it ends...",1397347200,,556,4.110091743119266

Sad to know I am at the end of this awarding winning series and hope the writers can come up with another excellent story line.,1397347200,,357,4.220588235294118
5318464,4,B009D4SQEQ,"We are hooked on this Canadian crime drama series set in Victorian-era Toronto. This well-written drama has an inspector who is honest and scientifically curious, and who makes various devices to help solve crimes. Good costumes, contrasts between rich and poor, greed, corruption and a tantalizing love interest between Detective Murdoch and the doctor who works with him as coroner. A great deal of actual late 19th and early 20th Century historical fact has been woven into the plots.",1397347200,,487,5.177215189873418

The relationships between charterers is good and you just have to keep watching to see where they are going to go.  Not too predictable, but somewhat.  Just fun to watch.

5318470,5,B009D4SQEQ,There are many shows out there today that claim to be mysteries and they fail miserably. Murdock is not one of them.  He has a mystery to solve and he does. In as much as any series there will be an episode now and again which you will not like. Murdock has very little to none of them.,1396915200,,286,3.9310344827586206

5318473,5,B009D4SQEQ,"We absolutely love this series.  The characters are very well developed and the acting is excellent.  It's so refreshing compared to what else is available.  Maybe we Americans can learn something from our neighbors to the North?  I can't wait to see season 6 on Prime - and then can't wait to have season 7 (this year) become available.  If this keeps ups, we might have to move to Canada :-)",1396828800,,393,4.47887323943662

5318475,5,B009D4SQEQ,"So glad for the return of all my favorite characters. Excellent series. Really it improved every season and Season 5 was the best yet for creativity, romance, mystery and innovation. Cleverly written and amusing the way the script works in historical characters, inventions and happenings. Very different TV series.

5318478,5,B009D4SQEQ,"While the production values are a bit skimpy, the nicely-drawn characters and enjoyable plots kept me coming back for more. The gimmick of guest appearances by famous people of the day- Tesla, Houdini, Conan-Doyle, etc. adds extra flavor every once in a while. This is a thoroughly enjoyable series for those who want a cosy-type level of period mystery.",1396656000,,354,5.016949152542373

5318483,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I came across this show via reruns on the weekends and fell in love with it.  Unfortunately reruns are selective and often repeats.  I liked the reruns so much I started searching and found the collections here on Amazon.  I ordered seasons 1 through 6 and finished watching all seasons in appx 3 weeks.  The quality of the BluRay disc is amazing, clear, crisp, great quality pictures.  I enjoyed the series' so much I can't wait for season 7 to come out on DVD/BluRay.  Meanwhile, I have ordered and just received the Murdoch Mysteries Movies DVD and hoping it will be as good as the TV series.

Highly recommended if you are a mystery buff.",1396483200,,642,4.530434782608696

5318487,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I don't usually give a show a 5 star rating. I like to leave room for improvement.  However, I have enjoyed this series so much and I haven't found any need for improvement.  I encourage anyone who can accept a premise with an open mind who enjoys something different, that is done well, to watch this series.  The characters are wonderful, the actors talented, and the story lines wonderful. I have watched all 5 seasons and am, very much, looking forward to the 6th season.

5318491,5,B009D4SQEQ,A mystery series set in Toronto in the 1800's. The plots are well done with history especially some science mixed in. The characters are very well done. Some romantic relations and sub plots but do not really get in the way. It is really a great entertainment and a way to perk up your interest in history.,1396396800,,306,4.385964912280702

BUT,,, beware - - you have to sit through about 10 minutes of ads BEFORE you can watch it
Can't get rid of it - - just just plan on starting it 10 minutes early,,, grabbing something to eat, and wait for the theme music to start.
ANNOYING as hell to pay for commercials.",1396310400,,349,4.117647058823529

5318497,5,B009D4SQEQ,Best mystery series anywhere!!  The Canadians are lucky to be watching Season 7 on their TVs every Monday night.  This show is not so readily available in the US.  Ovation station (a cable station) runs it but there are varied times and older episodes (still really good).  Watch it if you can find it.  It's worth the search.,1396137600,,326,4.551724137931035

5318499,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I really like this mystery series. It keeps me on the edge of my seat. It's a ""who done it"" and detective Murdock always solves the crime. He is not as clever when it comes to his heart...naive to be exact. Watch and see.",1396137600,,221,4.045454545454546

The main character, Detective Murdoch, is a delight as are most all of the characters in this series.  Season 5 has Station #4 going through several changes and ends up with the main characters celebrating the turn of the century together.

5318511,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I watched the first 4 seasons and loved all of those and what I have watched of season 5 is just as good.  I wish they would continue it right on.  It's just one of those programs that I could  watch every day all day long but I know that these folks would get awful tired of filming that much.  It would be nice if they could continue the program on for another few years.  I think BBC has cancelled the show though and season 5 is the last season that it will be shown.  The actors all did a great job and if they ever make more, I won't complain.  It's one of the few shows that I can enjoy without all the cussing, sex, nudity etc, etc.",1395705600,,640,3.9147286821705425

It's shot in Canada.",1395446400,,109,4.0
5318520,4,B009D4SQEQ,"I liked the clever story lines of the series.  The positive connections in the relationships of the actors was developed quite well and the moral character of Murdoch was a refreshing surprise in today's culture.  The development of his relationship with Dr. Ogden was handled well in the beginning, but then took a disappointing turn with the introduction of her having had an abortion for which she didn't seem to have any remorse. Admitting and repenting of the evil we do is far more admirable than ignoring or justifying it.
For those of us who wanted Murdoch and Ogden to love, court, marry, & maybe have children, to then have her marry another guy seemed in-explicable.  So then the writers face the dilemma of what to do with the new guy... so there solution is divorce, so that Murdoch and Ogden can still be an item.  It could have been so much better.",1395446400,,863,4.620915032679738
5318521,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The show is well written, taking a look at life during the late 1800

5318532,5,B009D4SQEQ,"As I have said in reviews of the other seasons - this is one series you can't watch out of sequence.  There are continuing stories/relationships so to watch the episode or season out of order would spoil the 'will they or won't they' and 'I can't believe that happened now'.  Lots of surprises in Season 5, and plot twists.  One was a little dark, more like Criminal Minds than a CSI, but again you have to have watched earlier seasons to know the characters that reappear.  I only have one episode left, and think this will be one of those series that I watch time and again.",1395100800,,576,4.355140186915888

It was insightful how so many inventions impacted our society.  This series was a precursor to the current ""Bones"" series with the post mordem scenes. Certainly kept me interested from all angles.",1394841600,,323,5.0754716981132075

In the fifth season it's starting to feel a bit like they're trying too hard with some pretty outlandish plots.

Julia has married another and a broken heart Murdoch starts out the season trying his hand in the Klondike Gold Rush. All is soon righted as Murdoch cannot escape his best destiny, being a detective, and he resumes his position with the Toronto Constabulary. Dr. Ogden only occasionally interacts with William while the new coroner, Dr. Emily Grace, seems to have eyes for Constable Crabtree. New adventures with famous names such as Henry Ford and Alexander Graham Bell, plus a hint of tools of the future with the inventive mind of Murdoch and his enthusiastic and imaginative cohort, Crabtree, make for another enjoyable set of stories. I just wish each season had 23 episodes instead of the abbreviated 13!",1394582400,,832,5.08029197080292

This is a historical crime series set in Toronto in the late 1800's filmed by CBC. It's all about a Toronto detective who manages to use inventive forensic modes now common in today's crime solving venue - he is sorta like Sherlock Holmes but better. It is interesting how future inventions are woven into the story and how they bring in characters like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Alexander Graham Bell, etc. Murdock loves inventing things and he is good at it.  This is not only a crime series but also has humor and is a love story- it has it all. Yannick Bisson is perfect for Murdoch and does an outstanding job. The other actors are very good as well. Love Crabtree's humor. I wish this was aired on a station in the US - much better to watch than some of the reality stuff that is on.",1394582400,,918,4.30635838150289

5318554,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This is a great mystery series.  It includes ""common"" murders, social issues, terror attacks, political issues, and a lot of fun remarks on the future.  The drop in characters include Nicola Tesla, Henry Ford, HG Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Jack London.

As with most fiction, they insert themselves into history--the main characters have so far provided story ideas to Wells, Doyle, and London.  They also like making comments about the future--what may happen or may never happen--often backwards.  Ford: ""The price of gas is low and will always be.""  The safety of Canadian Bonds vs. Stock Market (referencing a portfolio that includes Ford, GE, Standard Oil, and Bell stock).  Gives the show some light-heartedness among the murders.

I highly recommend.",1394496000,,761,5.231404958677686

Our only regret is that it doesn't air in the U.S., at least not on our cable system (Comcast in New England).  Very well written, which is probably because Maureen Jennings, the woman who wrote the books, is directly involved in the show as a consultant, and she has even directed an episode or two.",1394236800,,492,4.395604395604396

He is a very funny character.  Good family fun.  Typically, there is a murder to solve in each episode.  We checked the actual number of murders that took place in Toronto during the time period: there was only 1 murder from 1895 to 1900 or so.

The storylines are great - they incorporate historical figures and events of the time with local crime.  Detective Murdoch is constantly constructing ""new-fangled"" contraptions to help with the forensics in the case - forerunners of moderate investigative equipment.  Constable Crabtree's speculations about future appliances such as cordless phones and surveillance cameras are met with rolled eyes and doubt and so entertaining.  Of course, there is also the seemingly thwarted romance between Inspector Murdoch and the female medical examiner, Dr. Ogden, not to mention the comic relief of the irascible Chief Inspector Brackenreed.

5318595,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This detective series is so amazing on so many levels!  Most detective dramas drag you through the darkest and most twisted gutters of crime, violence, and human depravity--and often leave you there.  Murdoch Mysteries retains only the necessary suspense and shock of the reality of crime, and homicide in particular, but, as do the best of this genre, focuses on the mental acumen required to unravel mysteries and find perpetrators--and save and protect the innocent.  The leading characters are imperfect, but so likeable.  There is an endearing quality of Victorian prudishness, and a focus on morality that is actually refreshing to see on the screen.  Watching the series, I feel like the creators have combined The Wild Wild West, Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, and probably a few other entertaining gems into a new and enjoyable amalgam which shares the best of its predecessors, but offers a new direction and original experience.  I sense that it is directed to a younger audience, but even a geezer can thrive on it.  I love it and I hope you will too!",1393372800,,1066,4.955056179775281

It is not written by formula like so many crime shows are.  In many shows the person who is guilty is introduced early and briefly, then the cops go on a wild goose chase until they come back full circle to the character lightly touched on and realize he/she is guilty.  Murdoch Mysteries is a true mystery whodunnit, and offers fascinating ideas which are seeds for today's technology.  Weaving in famous characters of their time, Alexander Graham Bell, Sir Arther Conan Doyle, Annie Oakely, and Wild Bill Hitchcock makes it even more fun.",1393372800,,663,4.689655172413793

This series has interesting in-depth characters, morality, modern interest roots, very little blue language, nothing to mock parental rights or control, and always well thought out subject lines the trail of which keeps your interest, keeps you guessing and keeps you learning while having fun getting there. Great show, amazing characters, writers who do a lot of research and wend history into the overall story with characters that leave you wanting more info into the past.

5318618,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Just started watching this series on Ovation as ""The Artful Detective"" and recently found it on Amazon as ""Murdoch Mysteries"".  I prefer the viewing experience with streaming since it removes the commercials.  I enjoy watching the actors' portrayals of 19th characters which are both intelligent and likable.  I also enjoy the writers' obvious fun in including historical characters such as Winston Churchill and Murdoch's inventions such as the ""Truthizer"" (the predecessor to the polygraph).  It is refreshing to see a character like William Murdoch who is so honest and principled yet still a human being with personal faults.  I would describe this series as a blend of ""Sherlocke"" and ""McGyver"".",1392940800,,700,5.327272727272727
5318619,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This is one of the best tv series ever.  Didn't read the book so I can't comment on whether it's as good or not as good but some of the best parts occur when a character foretells an event that will come about in the future such as when Constable Crabtree and his partner are heading toward the phone kiosk and Constable Crabtree states that he sees a time when everyone will carry a little phone that's no bigger than their hand and his partner says ""that's ridiculous George, wires would be everywhere and it would scare the horses.""  The series is full of gems.  The entire cast is perfect.  I look forward to the next season.",1392854400,,629,4.35042735042735
5318620,5,B009D4SQEQ,I feel this is one of the best programs ever on TV. They amaze me just what great writers they have. I love the way they work different people from history into the stories. I wish the american tv could turn out stories as good as these. Seems like we have to go to England and now Canada for the best writing. ENJOY!,1392854400,,317,4.0476190476190474
5318621,2,B009D4SQEQ,"The writers should have had Darcy killed off, as people did not 'separate' during this time period. Dr. Ogden was dressed contrary to her character and the occasion (again) and looked like she might have been a 'dance hall girl' rather than a doctor. The first time occurred when she and Darcy had been entertaining in their home shortly after they married. And the closing scene - Murdoch and the doctor turned floozy - adds to the destruction of Dr. Ogden's respectable and proper reputation.",1392854400,,494,4.823529411764706
5318622,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I originally found this show on Pivot and was intrigued by how they wove well know ideas, such ""finger marks"" ,into the show as inventions/discoveries of the era. It takes place in the late 1800's and the sets, clothing, language and literally everything else is carefully conveyed. The plots are engaging as are the regular characters of the show. I binged it and watched the last episode with much regret for it being over.",1392854400,,425,4.756756756756757
5318623,5,B009D4SQEQ,"A great detective story with a twist, maybe because it's Canadian or because it's set in the late 19th century.  Acting is good with the lead person (Murdoch) using methods way ahead of his time.  A little bit of romance with some suspense there also.  Can't wait until Season 7.",1392854400,,279,4.54

I've enjoyed the entire series and have watched it twice but the very best thing about the entire series is the ending. The final episode of Season 5 has one of the most romantic moments I've ever watched on television, or in movies. It was perfect.",1392854400,,425,4.2592592592592595

Most episodes include an introduction to the creation of some bit of technology, often with a walk-through by the inventor.

This series has interesting characters with more than one characteristic!  i.e. Constable Crabtree, believes in UFO's and such, but takes the initiative to check into the various crimes in 1890's Toronto.

5318743,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I was introduced to Murdock Mysteries some time ago by a friend. It is another one of those shows where the longer you watch it the better it gets. I love the primitive forensic tools, the novelty of the crimes and primarily the characters. Some series you may watch for the computer animation, some because they make you think and some because you become invested in the characters.

5318757,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The acting is great and the character development gets better and better over time.

5318771,4,B009D4SQEQ,"Murdock is a Canadian based lighter version of Masterpiece Mysteries from the BBC and seen the the U.S. on PBS. The program is set in the late 1800's and early 1900's.

The writers have done an excellent job of incorporating inventions that might be forthcoming in the future, such as a lie detector. The casting has been masterfully done and after only a few episodes you are drawn to the characters as well as the story. The outcome is a little easier to figure out as compared to an Agatha Christie story but still fun and entertaining.

Using Masterpiece Mysteries as my highest standard I feel Murdock rates four stars. Another mystery series comes from Australia. Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries. It's available on Amazon. Extremely entertaining and sometimes risque'.

Also available on Amazon that is very good: Inspector George Gently. It is set in Northern England and is very compelling.",1388793600,,896,4.96

I enjoy the clever way the show has Murdoch, living in 1899, inventing and using devices and procedures we take for granted in modern crime fighting today. The dawn of the new century brings new technologies to the show like moving pictures, electric cars and electroshock therapy. The romance between William and Julia continues. I was disappointed not to find season 6 episodes on Amazon Prime. Maybe soon?",1388793600,,445,4.868421052631579
5318773,5,B009D4SQEQ,Very entertaining. I love how Murdoch uses futuristic ideas to solve his mysteries. I also like the inserts of thoughts and ideas.,1388793600,,130,4.954545454545454

5318776,5,B009D4SQEQ,This show has handled the dynamics of the development of more involved story lines which the talent of the cast has handled beautifully. I look forward to having new seasons added for viewing by those of us who are not Canadian.,1388707200,,228,4.585365853658536

I love the inclusion of science and inventions (circa 1899) and the appearances of historical figures that we've all read about (Tesla, H.G. Wells, Jack London) who make it all seem so real.

5318781,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This has been one of our favorite series, along with Foyle's War. The costumes and the language are so well-researched and carried through, the characters believable and egaging. We have just started the Inspector Lewis series which pales by comparison with this fast-paced show that makes guessing who-done-it almost impossible. Highly recommended that you start with season 1 as the character development and story-line among the characters is as important as the individual cases. We started this on Netflix, but continued on with seasons 4 and 5 which were only available on Amazon. We have not yet watched season 6, and I may break down and actually PAY for it.",1388620800,,666,5.0636363636363635

Have thoroughly enjoyed all the seasons 1 thru 5 and wished there were more.  Have just the last episode of Season 5 to watch and enjoyed all.  Heard there was a season 6 but so far have not seen anything about it.  The actors may get tired of doing the same Characters, but watching them has been a great pleasure.

5318786,4,B009D4SQEQ,"The Murdoch mysteries have two fantastically attractive leads, Yannick Bisson and Helene Joy, who make it a pleasure to view.  The storyline is cleverly done with some tongue-in-cheek references to inventions not then perfected but being worked on by the ever cleve Murdoch.  Historical characters make appearances when they pass through Toronto.  Larger issues such as faith and abortion and women's rights also weave in and out of the plots.  All told a completely satisfying viewing experience.",1388448000,,497,5.415584415584416

5318797,5,B009D4SQEQ,A very interesting series of mysteries that are solved through deduction and scientific discoveries.

5318805,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Complex characters..you feel you get to know them as real human beings. It's fun to see what new invention Murdock is going to come up with each week. Of course, there's the ""who dun it"" element with lots of twists and turns. Finally, there's the little bit of angst of a star crossed romance. What more could you want?",1387756800,,319,4.423728813559322

I can't stand CSI-type shows, but setting this one in 1890s Toronto and giving it a steampunk twist, has me hooked, hooked, I say!

5318810,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I love Murdock movies. Here is a devout man. caught up in the life of severe criminals, and crime. Doesn't carry a weapon during normal work. Will do so if needed. Yet he always gets his man. A low key romance existing between him and his autopsy Dr.in the morgue. Works closely with the police chief, which with the higher ups, at times isn't all that comfortable. Murdock has a cute sense of humor, and never looses your attention.",1387497600,,433,4.493670886075949

5318814,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The conceit of setting Murdoch in Victorian times might be expected to wear thin after several seasons, but what keeps this series fresh and entertaining is the fine ensemble work in it. Most every character is fully formed and likable. It is also great fun to see how (and how well) historical characters and issues are incorporated. Much more than a simple mystery show.",1387497600,,372,4.828125

5318817,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I discovered Murdoch Mysteries on Ovation TV (under the name ""The Artful Detective""), where I doubt it will get much promotion and it will be very difficult for the U.S. audience to discover in the ""high numbers wasteland"" of cable TV. This series is a terrific mix of slightly-steampunk Victorian costume drama, MacGyver-tech police procedural, X-Files-meets-Scooby-Doo unmasking of the supernatural, and clever mysteries and secret histories sprinkled with quirky comic moments and all the struggles of true love. Murdoch Mysteries has the addictive quality of genre TV even as it defies or transcends all categories. It crosses the intelligence of British TV with the pacing and eye candy of American TV, and produces a miraculous hybrid.

Murdoch Mysteries is set in Toronto, which for most U.S. viewers will be the equivalent of another planet, but this isn't ""alienating"" at all - the time period is familiar enough that the location could be Any City in the Victorian Era. Better yet, this series is Mom-safe: the humor doesn't go near the toilet (though it often finds its way into the morgue) and the modernizing values are cloaked in old-fashioned courtesy. In fact, I bought this series for my Mom for Christmas, and I know she's going to love it. Yet there's plenty for younger demographics to enjoy, from clockpunk gadgets to shipping favorite couples. (Though I must admit that the show occasionally teeters into rather awkward fan service on the shipping front - I'd rather see the passionate kiss than Constable Crabtree musing on when those crazy kids will get together.) Also, there is enough ""angst"" and outright depressing turns of events to enthrall the moodiest of Millennials. What more can the sick-of-reality-TV jaded American TV watcher ask?

Murdoch Mysteries is now in its 7th season in Canada, where the show is a big hit and the quality remains high. I just hope it will somehow be discovered by American viewers soon so the syndication money will pour in, and this wonderful show will continue for years to come.",1387152000,,2043,5.041420118343195

5318824,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I'm hooked.  I like that it is a period piece that is done very well (contractions are not used in dialogue).  The stories are well written and acted, with tongue and cheek moments occasionally supplied intentionally or not.  It is a series that's not always true to it's time period but neither is CSI.  I enjoy the show enough that I went on line to see if it's still being produced.  It is.  I hope amazon gets season 6 soon!!",1386979200,,429,4.3

5318844,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I have loved Murdoch Mysteries for years!  I was so sad when it looked like it would be canceled by the network, and then so excited to hear that another network picked it up.  My father and I have watched every episode together and it is one of the only shows we can agree on.  The characters are warm and the stories invite you in.  Canadian shows just seem to have a way of making you invest in the characters, no matter what the show is about.

There is a sense of coming home when you watch Murdoch Mysteries, the good guys work hard and get the bad guys in the end, without a lot of car chases and sex.  While I don't mind watching car chases and sex scenes, it's so nice to have something almost wholesome to watch, without being preached to.

I hope the series runs for many more years because I will keep watching!",1386028800,,823,4.170886075949367

5318853,5,B009D4SQEQ,I enjoy watching the ensemble interact with each other respectfully without the use of vulgar language.  The cases are solved using period technology  with historical reference. Unique and entertaining.,1385683200,,202,5.931034482758621
5318854,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Love the series, I am a big fan of British TV.  When are you getting season 6/7?

5318855,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Murdoch Mysteries has been a favorite series of ours since we discovered it.  We've been waiting for Season 5 to come available, and it is just as good as we remembered it.  We've watched two of the shows and look forward to watching the others in Season 5.",1385510400,,257,4.333333333333333

5318857,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Murdoch is one of the best shows in a long time.  On par with BBC quality, but from our brethren to the north in Canada.  Smart, fascinating, historical, fun, witty, charming.  Murdoch is just a lovely show.  Terrific acting (got to love the Chief Inspector!!!).  You'll be hooked!  If you love Foley's War but are looking for a bit more humor, and maybe a bit more romance, then look this up!  It is no silly US melodrama!  It brings history alive and dares to dabble in modern technology!  ""George!!  What have you!?!?!!""",1385164800,,523,4.586956521739131

5318859,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I'm giving this a 5 Star rating, even though I've only just begun to watch this Season, based on the previous seasons and what I've seen so far. Unlike many series that sort of 'lose it' after a season or 2, this one has stayed strong and remained fun to watch, with continuing 'surprises' in characters who are introduced, either briefly or as part of the story line who lived in this time period, and went on to be well knows.",1384819200,,428,4.296296296296297

5318862,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I was hooked from the first season. This is a great criminal adventure with perfect casting and writing that creates a fun, entertaining, quirky crime solving crew. I fell in love with each character and the way all their lives intertwine all while solving some very creative and keep you guessing crimes. This gets my highest recommendation. :)",1384732800,,345,4.9655172413793105
5318863,5,B009D4SQEQ,What a great series. We can hardly wait for season 6. I love the way that Murdoch adapts new discoveries from the beginning of the 20th century to his crime solving techniques. We only have one episode left to watch - and we almost hate to watch it becuase we don't know when the next season will be available.,1384646400,,310,4.271186440677966
5318864,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I enjoy this series so much, I did not have the patience to wait until the most recent season was free to view. I was willing to pay for it!  It is one of my favorite programs - and I've recommended it to dozens of people who also love it! Start with season one and by the third or fourth episode you are hooked! An 1800's CSI with key characters that are well developed during the series. The inclusion of all the new science that is coming into play during that time is an intriguing aspect, as well. Humor, mystery, history, and very likeable main characters.",1384560000,,562,4.30188679245283

5318888,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The Murdoch series has been an unexpected delight. It is clever, well-written, well-acted, and put together with high production values.  Set in Toronto around 1899-1900, the series presents intelligent and fun mysteries investigated by the redoubtable Detective William Murdoch of the Toronto Constabulary, a prescient detective using modern methods, many of his own device, to solve brutal crimes. There is romance -- two of the major characters are interesting, educated women -- a good deal of humor, and cameo appearances by some of the world's luminaries, including Arthur Conan Doyle and Nikola Tesla.

A terrific series.",1383091200,,628,5.53125

5318894,4,B009D4SQEQ,"Murder mysteries can be lots of fun, trying to figure out whodunit and all. When they're also period pieces, then they take on a different level of interest; provided they're clever with the setting and history. In the Murdoch Mysteries, there's plenty of ingenuity in the plot, and the setting is novel enough to capture and hold the viewer's interest. Additionally, there are historical hooks to science, ""current"" events, and celebrities that add extra interest significance to the stories.

As the stories begin, we've tried to determine who the suspects are, and who actually performed the crime(s) in question. While we've guessed correctly a couple of times, only once have we actually solved the crime before the end. And that just barely so! My wife and I give the plotting and story lines a couple of hearty thumbs up.

The characters are fun too, and by the 5th season they've (mostly) grown with the passage of time. Sadly, Murdoch himself is the only one who seems to be a bit ""stuck"" in his role and growth. The tired clich that he never quite gets the girl has been overplayed. Other than that, we've thoroughly enjoyed watching these stories and will watch them again in the future. There are plenty of hidden bits yet to find...",1382918400,,1245,4.786046511627907

Inspector Murdoch invents fingerprinting, surveillance cameras, and with help from his friend Nicola Tesla, microwaves and other electronic gadgetry -- all before the turn of the 20th century. Almost all the stories are ripped from today's headlines (US intelligence agents interfering with neighboring governments, for example) and moved back more than 110 years.

5318903,5,B009D4SQEQ,Detective Murdoch of the Toronto constabulary willing uses new and emerging early 20th century techniques to solve murders within his city.

It really holds my attention.  I do, however, get tired of the way the authors constantly write their liberal social & feminist agendas into a Victorian Age story.  I find the Dr. Ogden character to be especially annoying.  The writers' layer modern liberal social and political views onto an otherwise great story.

5318928,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I'm afraid to comment without giving spoilers, but enjoyed the way in which the season moved from the beginning of it to the end.",1381708800,,129,4.416666666666667
5318929,5,B009D4SQEQ,I like this show as it's entertaining and there is no bad language or blatant sex.  Also like the location and era.,1381708800,,115,4.2272727272727275
5318930,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I absolutely love this show, and so does my whole family.  Think of it as a turn of the century CSI, and you will have a good idea of what this show is about.  Excellent writing and memorable characters give this great cast something great to work with. They turn in fantastic performances throughout every episode. Give this a try, you will probably get hooked like my family did!",1381708800,,381,4.507246376811594

5318932,5,B009D4SQEQ,My favorite show on Amazon Prime Instant Video.  Watched all 5 seasons.  The plots are so interesting and entertaining.  Acting and cast of characters is great.  Hope that season 6 will be on Prime Video when it is released.,1381708800,,224,4.666666666666667
5318933,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Both my husband and myself enjoy each and every episode and wait for more.  Quirky, lots of imagination with many historical facts thrown in.  If there were six stars I would have highlighted them all!",1381708800,,201,4.714285714285714
5318934,5,B009D4SQEQ,"This is a show that the whole family can enjoy.  In fact it mixes historical figures and interesting detective stories in a very inventive way.  The show is a international hit and for good reason.  I do enjoy racier tv shows like 'copper' (rip) and many bbc series but it's good to know that a show that anyone including smaller kids can enjoy is out there. And this is not a kids show but a detective show but the family can sit together and know that they will be entertained and learn about history as well as deal with a good crime case story. The dvd looks great and the only complaint I have is that it's not a blu ray as this was shot in hd.  But parents who often fail these days to do their jobs should be happy to have such a show where good men fight evil and do it with style.  It just goes to show that some parts of the past were superior to the present.  This can be enjoyed from everyone from the most conservative person to someone like me who enjoys totally adult and racy stuff. Because the stories are good. sadly the doctor character has left the series and her romance with Murdoch; which was so Victorian ,  is missing here.  But maybe Murdoch , that brainy and painfully shy man will meet someone else.  Watch this show! it's really good and the actors are first rate and engaging too.",1381622400,,1310,4.228915662650603
5318935,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Although not as good as the previous seasons, I still love this show! The interaction of characters, the old-time setting, the unique plots all work to form this Canadian mystery series that takes places near the turn of the century. I would highly recommend to start with the first series.",1381622400,,290,4.82

5318939,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I loved this series, it was based somewhat on history and introduced historical figures and I loved the science that was show as emerging in that century.  Murdock was an honest and good man who faced his problems with truths and doubts just like many of us.  Also it was a different Canadian point of view.  The supporting actors in this series are also a wonderful mix of humanity and make the whole show fun and interesting.  I would recommend this series to anyone who loves mysteries but can do without the ""in your face"" violence of most of the shows on TV today.",1381449600,,569,4.4423076923076925
5318940,4,B009D4SQEQ,"Great development of characters where each individuals are grown to be loved in their own way. In the end they stick together and help each other out. Interesting storyline that relates to the future. I like that specially when Tesla showed up in the first pilot I was hooked...
The love conflict adds a good twist. Interesting culmination of stories and almost linking the the sherlock holmes and moriarty conflict. Overall I like the show which interesting to watch and find out who done it style without predicting in the beginning...",1381449600,,537,4.912087912087912

5318946,4,B009D4SQEQ,"High production quality, lovable characters, and all around good story lines.  This is mystery the old fashioned way.

Very well done. The actors are memorable. not surprising the show is still going.",1380931200,,144,5.304347826086956
5318953,5,B009D4SQEQ,Funny.  Great character actors.  It does not take itself too seriously.  It has lots of fun with the genre and a stiff main character who is a perfect parody of the slick modern hero.  Murdoch only goes into his own when he has the mystery solved.,1380931200,,247,4.304347826086956

Please keep'm coming!  :-)",1380844800,,299,4.98
5318961,5,B009D4SQEQ,I love this show and would like to see more seasons.  It is interesting as well as education showing what was going on in the world at that time.  It was an age of inventions and industry.  It shows how people were trying to cope with every day life with the changes going on.,1380844800,,276,4.074074074074074

5318964,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The Murdoch Mysteries are good, clean entertainment.  These shows are the kind one can sit down with the entire family and watch, not having to worry about whether something will flash on that is not appropriate for all to see.  Just good stuff!",1380844800,,245,4.674418604651163
5318965,5,B009D4SQEQ,I have watched every episode offered on Amazon and I can watch them all over and over again. Every character on this show has something good to offer. They all tug at your heart and your imagination. Murdoch's essential to everyone to make the show flow but each character has something interesting going on at the same time. Murdoch always does the right thing even when it's the hardest thing. And then he surprises greatly in one episode that shows what a good man he is. Right when you already think he's the perfect person he shows just how human and imperfect he is. He is his own toughest critic.,1380844800,,603,4.490909090909091
5318966,5,B009D4SQEQ,Can't wait until season 6 comes out.  I only wish that the series would focus more on the detective part and less on the problems of Murdoch's romance.  Its becoming more of a soap opera like the Americans tend to do with a good enjoyable detective series.,1380758400,,256,4.425531914893617
5318967,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I own all 5 seasons of the Murdoch Mysteries and plan to buy season 6.  I fell in love with the series while on visit to Toronto where I saw a couple of episodes on TV.  When I returned home, I bought the first four seasons.
I find the plots interesting, especially the use of modern techniques that were in their infancy at the time of the fictional detective Murdoch.  For example, finger marks as a prelude of finger prints; plotting a picture from a telegram using black-gray-white pencils for what today would be a computer or television screen.
I also like the subplots that depict the prejudices that existed in the late 1800's like:  discrimination of all religions except protestants; treatment of minorities; social issues like homosexuality and abortion; and equal rights for women.  These prejudices were not unique to Toronto, but were also prevalent in the USA.
I find the series entertaining and at times thought provoking.",1380758400,,938,4.8742138364779874

5318970,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Here is a wonderful detective with forensic skills portrayed by a wonderful actor Yannick Bisson who portrays one of the first forensic detectives and explains it to a audience who just soaks up his words and deeds in solving every murder.  Also, he has a on-going romance with the lady coroner Julia, portrayed by Helene Joy, a lovely actress who  enhances every story she and Detective Murdoch are colloborating on including the growing love and respect they have for each other.  The other actors in the series are equally enhancing and it is one of the most enjoyable detective sets I have in my collection--right up there with Poirot and Sherlock Holmes.
The setting of being at the turn of the century is equally wonderful and the sets are authentic.  The Alaska episode was beautiful and I was so glad I have this set in Blu-Ray.  A pure joy the whole set and I am awaiting the release of Season 6 in December as a pre Christmas present from my husband, who doesn't know he is giving it to me for Christmas.",1380758400,,1014,4.549450549450549

5318978,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I suppose it's a bit of an homage to the old U.S. show ""The Wild, Wild West"" but it's a lot of fun to watch and very creatively written. Watching Murdoch come up with his crude versions of modern technology so many years before their time is quite fascinating. Also, seeing people struggle to express their feelings about another person when such expression was hampered by the customs and mores of the time was quite fun and interesting to watch. And now that Amazon has removed the block on Season 3 to us Amazon Prime members, I'll finally get to see the whole series. Woo-Hoo!",1380499200,,580,4.533333333333333

After that we couldn't stop watching. Don't judge this show by the first episode! I thought they did the quick zoom way too much and the cuts were too abrupt, but now I love the first episode. I think they were just trying to fit everything in and rushed instead of taking a beat, like I'm used to, but I really like the story. Interesting mysteries, great cast and surprisingly funny moments make this show a must see at my house.",1380412800,,585,4.327272727272727
5318985,4,B009D4SQEQ,"I stumbled across this series while browsing Amazon's Prime Streaming service. What a great find. This is a Canadian production. The stories are different and intriguing being a period detective mystery containing loose references to scientific fact. The acting may not be the greatest. However, the stories do not insult your intelligence. The series is way ahead of most of the drivel that comes out of American produced TV, especially the current crop of so-called reality TV, mind numbing junk. I look forward to each year's addition to the streaming library and mourn the fact it will end at some time. Highly recommend taking a look.

Watching this show is like taking a time machine back to the birth of modern policing and forensics.

Murdock Mysteries is kind of like Sherlock Holmes, only transplanted to Toronto, and Murdock is a policeman, rather than a private investigator.

The female roles are played quite well, even if it is hard to believe women at that time were so 21st century in thought and actions.  I also like the the chief character Detective Murdoch, who is conflicted, as we all are, between religious, moral and ethica, the law,l questions.  Man never seeks the law but justice and that conflict creates most of the moral judgments and dilemmas we face on a daily basis.",1379116800,,577,4.797979797979798

5319026,5,B009D4SQEQ,I love this mystery series! I enjoy the time period represented in the show and the characters are wonderful! The actors who play these parts do a super job! I love the sense of humor in each and the scientific - early CSI - approach Murdoch uses to solve the mysteries. I really appreciate the fact that a woman plays the M.E.

5319029,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Sometimes by the fifth season of a show discrepancies begin to show up within the script and the arc of the storyline. However, the writers of the Murdoch Mysteries pay attention and the series is written with long range story lines. Of course, the series could be canceled at anytime, but I think what keeps drawing the fan base back each season is the attention to historical detail as well as the personal growth of characters. In other words-- this is a layered series, a bit like those you see on PBS Masterpiece Theater.
But be prepared-- the fifth season has a bit darker tone. The murders and the historical settings seem to bring out the dark underside of the Victorian era. The portrayal of issues that society still struggles with today-- equality of women, abortion, mental illness, racism and class distinction against the backdrop of scientific and technological advances (the Age of Enlightenment) are presented in such a way that it promotes discussion. It's always good to remember what King Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes,"" There is nothing new under the sun.""
All in all it's a great series, family friendly and worth the watching.",1378944000,,1149,4.897435897435898

What intrigued me when I first started watching Murdoch Mysteries was that, being a period drama, story lines included ""advanced police detection,"" historical scientific and cultural happenings and encounters with historical figures who are part of the story.

It seems like the plots are kind of mechanical, rather than original and fun to watch. I think this happens with a lot of tv shows that run for more than 3-4 seasons - they run out of steam. Still, I like the characters, enjoy seeing the inventions appear, and if there's another season I will watch it, too.

Buying season 5 was a no brainer after this and the blue ray is of outstanding quality and works out to less than streaming HD would have cost.  Canadians are watching season 6 now and I'll snap that up when a Blue ray is issued.  This series is great and in the same intelligent style as some of the English Mysteries but better production and less accent to deal with.

I discovered the series about 2 years ago and fell in love with its ""procedural show-meets Victorian era drama- meets homespun"" appeal. Murdoch has grown as a character throughout the span of the series, as have the supporting characters. He finally finds love with Dr. Ogden after her marriage and societal complications of the previous season. Constable Crabtree continues to delight as a supporting character --he, too, has grown in depth since the first series. Looking forward to more episodes",1374278400,,595,5.208333333333333

At first I wondered about the need for this new addition to the cast, but it makes sense in the end.  I will not give anything away but Season 5's storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat. I recommend this entire series (you must view from the beginning) for the entire family.  Refer to my review of Murdoch Mysteries Seasons 1-4).

I miss Dr. Ogden/Helene Joy and wonder how and when she and Detective Murdoch will reunite. I enjoyed the story about her efforts to teach contraception and birth control in this season, and she makes an unexpected return in another episode, enough to suggest that we've not seen the last of her or of her romance with Detective Murdoch.

It's a pleasure to watch Constable Crabtree's/Jonny Harris's character develop, as he becomes more adept at solving crimes, publishes his first novel, and acquires greater self-confidence.

The device of posing current-day technological questions in the context of nineteenth century social and forensic issues is fascinating.

I've watched Seasons 1-3 on Netflix and 4-5 on Amazon. The backstories of the characters never suffer in order to make the stories more sensational, something that often happens in American series television. I'm very fond of the main characters and look forward to Season 6.",1373760000,,1048,5.333333333333333
5319080,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Season 5,as with all previous seasons, brings variety of issues that Murdoch and company deal with along with solving the murders. The characters grow, past characters come back in some episodes, and you feel apart of history as you meet now-famous people and see how events shaped the future.",1373760000,,293,5.0
5319081,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Both my wife and I are surprised that one of our major networks hasn't picked up or copied this series.  It is defiantly a unique and interesting show.  Touching on actual events of the time and even some that hadn't quite occurred yet makes this a ""must watch"" series.  Can't wait for more.",1373587200,,291,4.452830188679245

It's wonderful family entertainment complete with action, witty dialogue, and humor plus a mysterious murder to solve in each episode. We now watch the whole series a couple of times each year. The characters and plots are memorable and you'll want to seen the episodes more than once. I found the final episode a somewhat improbable but satisfying conclusion. It's well worth the money for great fun entertainment. I wish they'd make more series like this!",1373328000,,517,5.023255813953488

5319094,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Murdock returns with more classic plots and iconic figures from the turn of the last century.  The new doctor in the morgue is Dr. Grace who has a thing for George Crabtree.  Fans of the series know that romance in this show comes to a boil as slowly as a gallon of motor oil over a birthday candle, so don't expect fireworks, but it is fun to watch.  Helene Joy doesn't look so good as a blonde in this season, and she gets awfully political (and I think rather out of character), but they bring it all together in the end.
We also see a major discontinuity when Murdock imagines himself in the future, and sees his own son by Dr. Ogden -- were we not told that she refused Murdock because she could not have children???  Never the less, the series is lively and inventive and does not fail to satisfy its fans in the 5th season.",1372032000,,830,4.234177215189874

I love the combination of History and Science woven throughout the story lines and I lie the civility that Detective Murdoch and the Toronto Constabulary use throughout each and every case. The hardest part of living through the niter 5 seasons was waiting for Detective Murdoch and Dr. Julia to finally reveal their love for each other.

We got impatient waiting for season 5 to appear on either Netflix or Prime so for my wife's birthday I ordered the Blu-Ray as soon as it was available.

The story lines are interesting, the acting is great and the production values are fantastic.

If you haven't seen any of the Murdoch Mysteries I would recommend watching them on Amazon Prime (or Netflix if that is what you have access to).  You won't be disappointed.

And after you have watched seasons 1 - 4 order season 5!",1368662400,,565,4.5

I was not able to get season 5 through either of those sources.  I could have waited until they became available, but I've become so enthralled with the show that I just couldn't wait!  This season is really good, but maybe not quite as good as the other 4 seasons.  Having said that, I still am really glad that I purchased it.

I love to see the program in which the inventor Tesla appears. I do hope that the writers will step up and actually write a marriage of Julia and William and not kill her off afterwards. Good writers can write about a married couple who team up to solve mysteries. We have watched some of the series on Netflix but its not the same as owning a DVD of the series.

The quality of the DVD was excellent, we look forward to the next series. By the way the humor is a great added feature which enlivens each program, especially in places which could become a little dull.",1368316800,,690,4.18796992481203
5319140,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I saw Murdock mysteries listed on a steampunk media website.  This is a quality production, that stays true to its characters, providing insight into life during the early 20th century.  A new murder mystery is solved in each episode using resources from that time period.  The unique characters experience life in completely different ways, at the same time working closely with one another.  it's fun to watch their amazement, confusion and tolerance for each other.",1368230400,,468,5.2

5319143,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Murdoch is a GREAT show. I always keep wanting more. The characters are great, and the writing is great. It takes place in 1899 and Murdoch is at the beginning of forensics. In this season Murdoch comes across Jack London and Alexander Graham Bell. In previous seasons he has come across Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Harry Houdini, Nicholas Tesla, Buffalo Bill, Annie Okley, and H.G. Wells. Just a wonderful show. I can't get enough of it. The show is VERY well done and one of my very favorites. Season 5 is great, it just keeps getting better!! I gave my sister season 1 and she's hooked as well.

If you enjoy period pieces and you like murder mysteries, I highly recommend!!! Very entertaining! I can't wait for season 6 to come out on DVD!",1368057600,,739,4.514925373134329

5319145,5,B009D4SQEQ,"Quite honestly my wife and I love this clever and sometimes funny series.  We live on the Eastern Coast of the US, but we are both from the MidWest.  Some have accused this series of being explicit, but this series is not nearly as explicit as movies and TV in the US that children are exposed to every day on television and at the theaters.  I can assure you they are far better off watching this series that shows the history behind the rights of all, especially women in the coming century.  This is truly family friendly entertainment.  We can't wait until the sixth season that was recently televised in Canada becomes available on DVD and Prime.  We know a Seventh season is to follow and we can only hope that in the near future this will be televised on an American network or Canadian or British channel available in the US.

5319146,5,B009D4SQEQ,Both funny and dramatic Murdoch is the true detective that old time dective magazines were made  from! Sometimes he runs into Alexander Gram Bell or othe notaries to help solve crimes (most in the perry mason method of the  ad guy jumping up and claiming guilt). Keeps you guessing what clues fit where....he always gets his  man!,1367625600,,330,4.754385964912281

5319148,5,B009D4SQEQ,I love this series.  It is captivating and refreshing.  It's a delight to watch something without language and sex.  It is wholesome  entertainment.  I love how historical themes weave throughout each episode.  The characters are realistic and well protrayed as loving humans in an imperfect world.,1367452800,,298,5.369565217391305
5319149,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I've enjoyed every episode of Murdoch Mysteries.  The characters each have their own charm and they interact with each other in an interesting and often humorous way.  I like the references to the future when a certain invention comes to light; for example, Murdoch was skeptical about investing money in Standard Oil, Coca Cola, Edison, etc., because the ideas were so far-fetched.  There is never anything offensive in the episodes beyond a bit of blood, and I appreciate that.",1367452800,,479,5.037974683544304
5319150,5,B009D4SQEQ,"The term ""steam punk"" catches the whimsical quality of this show, set in the early days of steam power. What it misses is the intelligence of the show----of the way events, procedures, and historical persons (e.g. Jack London, Oliver Wendel Holmes) of the era are woven into the plot. It also does not do justice to the decency of the main players. There is a certain poignance in the effort of the characters to be true--stay true--to codes of decorum and personal ethics that have waned, if not disappeared, by now. In its own easy way, the show is a morality tale that plays sweetly in today's cultural free-for-all.

Anyone who enjoyed the old ""Northern Exposure,"" will welcome ""Murdoch Mysteries.""",1367452800,2,702,4.85

5319152,4,B009D4SQEQ,"Most of the episodes are funny and clever with very interesting plots and themes.  I love how they use some of the early scientific discoveries to help Murdoch solve his cases. I love the actors and the acting!  But sometimes there are episodes that seem to get a little weird with their themes.  Maybe going beyond the general criminal personalities of good, bad and clueless to slightly weird and twisted.  I found I did not enjoy those episodes as much.  Murdoch remains the gentleman star of the show. But I also love the supporting cast.  Overall would recommend.  But some episodes would not be, in my opinion, kid safe, which is too bad because I think they could have made them so and not lost any quality of programming.",1367193600,2,729,4.604651162790698

I especially liked the the time the stories take place (late 1800's-early 1900's) and the location (Toronto). You really get into the story line and become aware of the inventors and inventions that come upon the scene during this time.

Netflix is too slow to offer this series so I am resigned to buy the seasons when they are available.  Very entertaining, funny, warm, frustrating at times.

CANADA IS COMPLETING SERIES 6 NOW AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO BE AVAILABLE TO WATCH ALSO.

YOU WILL BE DRAWN INTO THE MURDOCK FAMILY OF CSI BRECKENREID, DR. OGDEN, CONSTABLE CRABTREE AND OF COURSE MURDOCK. OVERALL THE MURDOCK MYSTERY SERIES, EVEN THOUGH SLIGHTLY!

I don't have to be bombarded with slang such as ""like"" injected into a sentence numerous times.  Or ""you know"", etc.  Plus there is a refreshing lack of profanity.  It kind of reminds me of the days when Red Skelton could entertain your family for a hour and you didn't have to worry about something ""coming out of left field"" you didn't want your kids to hear.  If all of you that enjoy this series enjoy it as much as us then contact Amazon with the feedback button and tell them you want this series to continue.  I did.  The more requests the better.  There is a season 6 that has 13 episodes ending in Canada on April 15th and there is going to be a season 7 next year with 18 episodes.

This season, our hero runs across historical characters Jack London, Henry Ford and Alexander Graham Bell.

The Inspector Crabtree character becomes more 3-dimensional, showing a keen eye for stock investing, identifying some promising firms that we all recognize today as industry titans.

Cheap and sleazy (some very unnecessary shots of prostitutes and the whole theme with Murdoch was uncomfortable and ridiculous). The new coroner gal is terrible... a pretty face with a flat personality. (If you wanted someone for Crabtree what happened to the telegraph girl? That was a character!) And Murdoch and Ogden... get over each other. It began dragging in the last season; this one just bottomed it out. Seems the theme for a lot of shows of late. NCIS, Merlin, Mentalist and on.

5319202,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I am a big fan of this late 19th-early 20th century period mystery series from Canada. It combines great stories with wonderful characters. Willliam Murdoch is a detective with the Toronto Constabulary. He gets involved with fascinating mysteries - usually involving murder - that involve new technologies as well as some famous historical characters such as Nicholas Tesla, Arthur Conan Dyle and others. He met his love interest, Julia, when she became the Toronto medical examiner.  I don't want to give anything away, but there are developments both professional and personal from season 1 that begins in the 1890's, and season 5 that begins in 1900. It's crime, mystery, suspense, romance and science all rolled into one.

I was also disappointed in the fourth season, especially the ending. But new money was found and the original actors returned so I bought this fifth season on faith. I am really impressed.

You can view season 5 as a stand-alone season, but trust me, you DO WANT every episodes.

Yannick Bisson's leading Murdoch role is rejoined with his boss, Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), Crabtree (Jonny Harris), in all episodes; and Dr. Ogden (Helen Joy) in most episodes. Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch) misses only one. A bright new star in coroner Dr. Grace (Georgina Reilly). Her saucy flair turns Crabtree's eye. Mine too!

SDH SUBTITLES for all 13 episodes, each near 50 min.
Season 5 (2012) episode synopses--without spoilers--if you like detail.
1 Murdoch of the Klondike --Dawson City gold fever dwindles, Murdoch tries forgetting unrequited love. He's befriended by Jack (Aaron Ashmore). In Toronto newly promoted Chief Constable Giles (Nigel Bennett) gets pushy. Can Murdoch clear Elizabeth (Jill Halfpenny) of murder?

2 Back and to the Left -An Irish Catholic suspected of a murder in a failed Protestant Mayor parade assassination. Murdoch & Dr. Ogden work closely--too close. Constabulary confiscates cameras and considers bullet trajectories (Reminiscent of JFKennedy & Dallas).

3 Evil Eye of Egypt --Ultraviolet light reveals a clue to deaths linked to Egyptian antiquities. Is it a mummy's curse as Crabtree's new novel, ""The Curse of the Pharaohs,"" suggests? His writing fame is comic, amid the diabolical mystery.

4 War on Terror --A homemade incendiary bomb explodes a shop & knocks about Crabtree and Higgins. Canada gov. man Meyers is responsible for security to a pending U.S.President McKinley's visit. Meyers is played by Peter Keleghan, Red Green Show ranger, and he has an annual appearance in a Murdoch episode. Also a romance buds. Matthew Bennett plays Clegg, anarchist or US agent?

5 Murdoch at the Opera --Understudy singer poisoned in rehearsal. Was Rosa the intended victim? Surprise opera fan, Brackenreid is bodyguard volunteer to the diva--thus causing his wife's (Arwen Humphreys) jealousy.

6 Who Killed the Electric Carriage? --Battery inventor murdered, perhaps by an electric vehicle designer (Peter Stebbings). Just as likely a suspect is Henry (Todd Hofley) Henry Ford. Is Brackenreid's wife now unfaithful? Crabtree spies to find out.

7 & 8 Stroll on the Wild Side parts 1 and 2 --The abduction of Lucille Messing (Tori Anderson), librarian with a secret past.  Murdoch's former love, librarian alias Anna Fulford (Lisa Faulkner), once ran away from the Black Hand crime syndicate. Dr. Ogden's jailed for illegally instructing in contraceptives, the act also opposed by her husband, Darcy (Jonathan Watton). Constabulary station #4 fields a baseball team. A most creative finale.

9 Invention Convention --See many early inventions while a disliked suction cleaner inventor Karl Schreyer is shot during his winner's speech at a convention--this after telling Murdoch of the threat. Can Alexander Graham Bell (John Tench; ep. 9 & 11) provide clues. Arguably the best Murdoch episode ever.

10 Staircase to Heaven --A guest in a remote house is murdered, in front of another guest, Dr. Grace. At Station 4, Brackenreid and Crabtree guard Watts, a man turning evidence against a killer--if they can.

11 Murdoch in Toyland --A kidnapped child is swapped with an Edison talking doll. The doll asks Murdoch to play. Dr. Ogden visits Station 4 (or is it the detective?) and suggests revenge with Murdoch as target.  Mike Senter returns from 2009, again playing Gillies

12 Murdoch Night in Canada --A hockey player is killed in the locker room. Driscoll (Jake Epstein), Crabtree's friend who wed Lydia, Crabtree's former love, is suspect, making relationships awkward. Dr. Grace has her own problems with her ex-fiance, also hockey player (Mark O'Brien).

13 Twentieth Century Murdoch --Gideon Turner (Joe Cobden) attacks Brackenreid, prevents a Santa from shooting a man, claiming he's a time traveler via Prof. Harms' (Colin Buchanan- D. I. Pascoe) time machine. Romantic threads aplenty in the 1899 Christmas stockings. Crabtree wants a date to the New Year's Ball. Brackenreid gets an Ottawa job offer.  Happy New Year, and you see suggestions concerning plots for season 6, when Murdoch investigates into the early 20th century.",1359158400,25,4742,5.565277777777778

The mysteries are set in the late 1800s at a time when H.G.Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Nicola Tesla were alive and in their prime.  Murdoch uses the latest (1800s) techniques to solve fairly complex crimes.  All of the characters, from constable Crabtree to the Medical Examiner to the Irish chief of police are well developed and seem extraordinarily real.

5319215,5,B009D4SQEQ,"I am  another addict.  Well  written, excellent period settings and costumes.  A superb cast.  I enjoy  many  of the British  shows  for  many  of the same reasons.  It  is a joy to  watch a  well written  show  with acting  that  is believable, not like the rubbish  American  TV  is  putting  out.  We  use Amazon  Prime  and  other  similar  services to view  quality programing  in  places  of  survivor,  and the rest  of American  TV  rubbish and  sports.  I just wish  we could get  programing this  good  in  the US.",1354665600,,524,4.431818181818182
