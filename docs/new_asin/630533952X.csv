7888603,5,630533952X,"`THE AFTER HOURS' remains just as fresh and effective as when it was first aired on June 10, 1960 and its lingering haunting imagery remains engraved into one's subconscious. Who can ever forget Anne Francis as Marsha. Her impeccable performance and exquisite face are indelible. ""Marsha"" that very name and the way it was repeated over and over was so eerily unsettling sending chills down one's spine. This episode when compared to `WALKING DISTANCE' demonstrates the great versatility of Rod Serling as a writer. `WALKING DISTANCE' is probably the best prose that Serling ever penned where every bit of dialogue was so heartfelt and moving. In `THE AFTER HOURS' Serling gives us a more visual tale where the storytelling is more dependent on the images. Serling gives us a story of two strikingly opposite worlds that co-exist within a department store. The vivid contrast and the realistic depiction of those two worlds is at the core of this story that has a strange tinge of melancholy about it. Thanks to effective lighting, production design, photography, Douglas Heyes' Direction and impeccable acting it succeeds on all levels and is one of the definitive episodes of the series. In `LIVING DOLL' Charles Beaumont gives us a somewhat similar view of a child's doll as `THE AFTER HOURS' showed us manikins. All similarities end there however. `LIVING DOLL' is photographed pretty straightforward and it boils down to a duel of wits between a not-so-nice stepfather played by Telly Savalas and his stepchild's new doll and companion, Talky Tina. There is no haunting imagery to be found in `LIVING DOLL' yet Talky Tina is creepy to say the least. As the story unfolds and one looks back on this episode the viewer actually begins to empathize with the Telly Savalas character. Talky Tina is so unnerving a creation that the plot develops into a duel between the lesser of two evils which is very apparent in the final shot. Bermard Herrmann once again shows a brilliant stroke of genius with his score for `LIVING DOLL' by going against the obvious. He could have given us an eerie and suspenseful score. Instead Herrmann opted for a 1960's modern `Space Age' sound that is overlaid with childlike taunts and teases that perfectly captures the confrontation between a real human and a very realistic doll and at the same time swings the viewer's pendulum of sympathies. `LIVING DOLL' is an excellent episode from the 5th season which aired on November 1, 1963 and is also one of the definitive episodes of the series. `THE DUMMY' written by Rod Serling has a ventriloquist played by Cliff Robertson believing that his dummy has a mind of his own. This is a low-key and well-filmed episode where Serling once again explores the psyche of a man who has seen better days. It still holds one's attention. `THE FEVER' which aired on January 29, 1960 seems more relevant today as a morality tale. This is an interesting story and memorable episode of addiction written by Rod Serling. Can a one-armed-bandit really talk? Veteran character actor Everett Sloane is brilliant as a conservative husband who disapproves of his wife's petty gambling, but once he gives a one-armed-bandit just one try he gets `THE FEVER' which is like no other and can only be found in ""The Twilight Zone."" This is one of the best ""Twilight Zone"" DVDs.",986947200,,3331,4.897345132743363
7888604,5,630533952X,"I am eleven years older than my sister, and when she was in grade school (mid 1970's) . . . I used to tell her stories about an old television show called (of course) ""The Twilight Zone"".  It was not ""on the air"" for a period of time, and then suddenly, one day, I noticed a local station was running it during the 10 o'clock (p.m.) hour.  Sister and I stayed up past her bed time, sneaking quietly into our parents' bedroom to watch that second T.V. set while ma and pa were in another part of the house.  The first few nights we tried this, some of the (rare) less frightening and weaker episodes appeared.  I was having trouble explaining myself at this point, and good natured criticism and teasing from little sister was mounting at a fever pitch!  Then one night, ""Living Doll"" made its presence. Most unforunately, little sister has never been the same since.  Oddly enough, I went to the dumps a few years later, and found a doll that amazingly appeared as the mirror image of ""Talking Tina"".  I brought it home for a second opinion, and my then junior high school sister was virtually in shock (as was I).  The doll interfered with our everyday peace of mind to the point where I eventually (like Mr. Savalas) was forced to get rid of the doll (radial arm saw destruction was not attempted).  I tossed the doll in the  (outside) garbage can moments before the garbage truck picked up, and clamped on the metal top! Needless to say, I did not take my eyes off the garbage can until I witnessed its contents actually land in the truck!  ""Living Doll"" has been subsequently imitated on several occasions but this was the original and most effective chiller!  The other episodes on this DVD are worth viewing as well.  ""The Dummy"" is excellent, and  ranks among the best Twilight Zones in the spine tingler category.  ""The Fever"" is the weakest of the episodes on this DVD but it still rates average or perhaps even above average.  Finally, Ann Francis is superb in another eerie episode featuring one or more manequins.",969580800,4,2025,4.537190082644628
7888605,4,630533952X,"Vol. 11 is a collection of very good Twilight Zone episodes. Not the best, but good ones none the less.
EPISODE: ""The Dummy"" DESCRIPTION: ""A ventriloquist is convinced that his dummy, Willie, is alive and  evil. He makes plans for a new act with a new dummy - plans that Willie  does not support!""  REVIEW: Very good paranoia script and absolutely  creepy ending. The ending actually makes the watch well  worthwhile.
EPISODE: ""The Fever"" DESCRIPTION: ""Tight  fisted Franklin Gibbs is not pleased when his wife wins a trip for two to  Las Vegas. But things change when he falls under the spell of a slot  machine that calls his name!"" REVIEW: Probably the weakest of the four  episodes. Script tends to go over the top at times, but when slot machine  calls out ""Franklin"", you get the chills. Ending goes a bit  overboard.
EPISODE: ""Living Doll"" DESCRIPTION: ""Erich is  displeased when his wife buys an expensive doll for his step-daughter. He  becomes even more displeased when the doll tells him it doesn't like  him!"" REVIEW: A very good episode with creepiness throughout. Dolls  threatening people always makes for good entertainment. Ending is  predictable, but very effective.
EPISODE: ""The After Hours""  DESCRIPTION: ""A woman discovers that the floor of a department store,  on which she bought a gold thimble, doesn't exist - and that her  'saleslady' is really a mannequin!"" REVIEW: Would be regarded by  critics as the best episode of this volume, and most definitely is.  Combines a compassionate script with some genuine spooks. Good ""moral  of the story"" message.",955756800,3,1578,4.9884615384615385
7888606,5,630533952X,Each one of these episodes are classics and the end of each one will certainly have your mind doing circles. Must have for all Twilight Zone fans. Even non Zone fans will enjoy these.,951868800,2,183,4.411764705882353
