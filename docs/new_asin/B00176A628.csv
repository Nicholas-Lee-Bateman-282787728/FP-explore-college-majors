8265023,3,B00176A628,"I now own all 6 volumes and I'm wondering where is Ready or Not? Where is the Pizza song that Jenn and Chatts sing? They're both on the advertisement (along with some kind of circus skit) that plays before all the movies start so why is it not on any of the DVDs when 5 Senses, Feel the Beat, Underwater Adventure and NSEW are each on 2 separate DVDs? I can't help but feel a little bit swindled when songs in the advertisement never show up. I could get Hi-5 hits but not sure if I want to buy another DVD just for one missing song. Then there's the complete box set of every episode ever made option. But the reviews on that are HORRIBLE! Bad quality, bad volume control, extremely hard to navigate menu and if your familiar with the show they play the song of the week at the beginning and end of every episode. As much as I love Robot Number One, I don't want to hear it 10 times just to get to the next theme. For a show that was nominated for several Emmys you would think they would take more time and care with planning of their DVD collection, but since this was released in 2008 and it's now 2015 I doubt they will change anything.",1455235200,,1141,4.1441441441441444

8265026,5,B00176A628,"Bought this DVD for my nephew, because this Hi5 version is the best! my kids still sing and dance their songs, and recently saw my nephew dancing to it. Love Hi5!",1379635200,,162,4.258064516129032
8265027,5,B00176A628,"This is another great Hi-5 DVD. Me and my daughter really enjoy watching and dancing along. One of the great things about this DVD is that it is continuous with many different statements from different episodes. It also has a karaoke part to sing with at the end. Some other DVDs I did not like how the episodes were set up because it put them into sections which had the opening song playing back to back several times. This DVD however does not repeat opening songs. It is a compilation of specific sections which makes this different from all the other DVDs we have.

I recommend this DVD for children ages one and up. Even littler ones enjoy the music and stories. My daughter is five years old and loves to watch this DVD. I am an adult and love to watch this DVD. This is great for the collector of hi-5 videos as well as someone who is new to this children's entertainment video.",1335312000,,886,4.36969696969697
8265028,5,B00176A628,"My baby girl don't even blink when this DVD is playing,she sings and dances and want to watch it over and over, one of the best DVD a parent can buy for they children. About 10 years ago the children I used to babysit use to watch Hi-5 and  loved it, now my daughter watchs it and I still think is great and even better then ten years ago...Love and reccomend it!!!",1298505600,,365,4.069444444444445
8265029,5,B00176A628,My granddaughters love Hi-5.  It is wholesome and entertaining for little kids of all ages.  And it is not a cartoon but rather people acting out animals and characters in neat ways.  Kids can relate to the segments and interact with the characters.,1254700800,,249,4.744186046511628

8265032,5,B00176A628,Both the American and the Australian versions of this great kid's show are popular with the kiddies.  The songs are catchy and keep them dancing around and the little stories and routines teach them a lot of little things which expand their vocabularies and knowledge bases.  It is a great series for the preschool and toddler sets.,1235347200,,332,4.807017543859649
