8522635,5,B004LQGSIW,"I speak english and couldn't understand any of the words. Still, I understand much of what I saw. This family went to live with this tribe in the jungle - to learn their language and culture. The father helped the people end a senseless war. The mother was doctor to several people and saved lives. The teenage daughter fell in love with one of the young tribesmen, but sadly he died. The young daughter and son broke through cultural barriers and fear and became friends with the tribal children. The tribal chief and tribes people also moved beyond cultural barriers and fully accepted the german family. Pretty darn good movie, even without understanding the languages. However, I would love to see it with english subtitles or dubbing.",1494374400,,739,4.826771653543307
8522636,4,B004LQGSIW,"Although I don't know German, I was still able to know the basic story.  Great soundtrack too.  The locations and sets are great.  Well made movie.  I have the book.  They should put this out with English subtitles for wider audiences.  I couldn't imagine giving up what I have here to move to such a foreign land with my father and family.  An incredible true story.",1478304000,,367,4.46969696969697
