Synchronicity pulls these two men together.  Each is the other's shadow side, complete with revulsion and attraction.  Opposites attract and without any regard for the moral rules of society, the evil side of human nature is brought to the surface and acted out.  This is not a new idea, but the characters discover the power of love and that death is not the answer.  Facing life is the hardest thing to do.

872196,4,6304431856,"I happened upon this movie by Accident. And despite is poor production values and some what non-sense scripting, something about this movie struck a chord with me. Keep in mind the quality of this film is Very Low Budget Early 90's. But If you want to watch a Different Kind of ""Gay"" film.. I reccomend this. Also when I say gay, this movie is not about being gay at all, the two main characters are gay and are involved in some psycho-sexual adrenaline fueled relationship, but the fact that they are gay is somewhat incidental. Both of the men are HIV positive and dealing with that in their own way. One has just found out and is going through a phase of depression and isolation while the other is on some self destructive path of violence. They end up on a road-trip to escape the law that is evocative of ""Thelma and Louise."" The movie is really a commentary on the preception of HIV/AIDS at the time the movie was made from the view of two people afflicted with the disease. In true indy style, only the Author knows exactly what the point if this film is while the audience is left to come up with its own interpretation. But it is a movie that will make you think, it's got some nice eye candy, and an interesting story line. I reccomend this to anyone who 1-hasn't seen it yet & B- Is looking for maybe an angry movie featuring gay characters. I bought this movie on DVD at Amazon.com after watching it several times on Netflix, so that oughta tell ya something.

872197,4,6304431856,"Gregg Araki is a brilliant director that finds in subversive and polemic subjects a complexity and richness that would pass unnoticed for other filmmakers.

""The Living End"" is a story that deals with death. However, unlike most movies Araki has found a balance between Freudian Eros and Thanatos. The life drive and the death drive are equally as important for Jon and Luke, the protagonists. They alternately assume different roles regarding impeding death. For Jon, at first, is denial when he confronts the fact that he has AIDS. He trusts in his doctor's words when is told that this diagnosis does not equal a death sentence. Not just yet anyway. Luke, on the other hand, has a clear self-destructive tendency; he seems to be wandering off amidst repellent streets and dangerous highways, with no goals and no real desire.

They meet. They have sex. But here sex is devoid of the Freudian libido. Sex at first may be a consequence of the life drive but ultimately it's but an act of despair, it's the result of an undeniable lack of hope. And what is hope in the end? Is it an abstract concept or rather the force that prevent us from languishing in a situation in which our success is never guaranteed? I'd venture to say that hope comes down to one element: creation. And it's clear for the viewers that Jon and Luke will never be able to create a life together, their existence has already been forfeit.

""Afterlife is just this pathetic notion people cling to in order to avoid confronting their own mortality"" explains Jon to Luke. And according to Slavoj Zizek he is absolutely right. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Plague-of-Fantasies-Second-Edition-The-Essential-Zizek/dp/1844673030/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Plague of Fantasies (Second Edition  The Essential Zizek)</a>&nbsp;Zizek explains that fantasy gives structure to reality. Fantasy is what allows people to confide in the symbolic order, fantasy is also more powerful than people might expect. Fantasy is the imaginary support upon which we build everything: we don't see human bodies we only see bodies through a certain fantasy; in fact, certain neurosis consist in seeing the body as it is (a disgusting cumulus of fluids, excrement, viscera and blood), and as a result there is a complete rejection of the other, or the constantly paranoid fear that contact with others will bring forth contamination or filthiness. Fantasy also structures desire (""what am I in the eyes of the other?""). Is Luke this rude, gay-macho version of Clint Eastwood or is this irresponsible, childish guy that makes Jon laugh with his nonsense? Is Jon this well-behaved gay, a productive member of society, or is he an absolute desperate person (willing to embark upon a nearly suicidal road trip with his newly found lover) that seeks out an indefinable truth that will give meaning to his remaining days? Fantasy also allows people to understand abstract concepts. What is a nation, for example? Benedict Anderson defines nations as ""imagined communities"", id est, arbitrary creations upon which people agree on.

Nevertheless, the most important conception of fantasy here is that which veils and hides the real. Fantasy secludes oneself from the awful truth. Fantasy nurtures mythological and theological narratives that deal with something that has frightened people since the dawn of time: death. Sometimes, fantasies that veil the horror of death are as clumsy as the nice and tidy instructions and warnings one receives in every flight concerning the possibility of an ""accident"" (one has but to wonder what use a fastened security belt has when most airplane crushes end up turning people into a pulp, scattered tissue, that prevents even dental records to be obtained from the wreckage), but also as influencing and historically relevant as the heaven versus hell narrative that church still proclaims to this day.

What is ""The Living End""? It is a glance of what happens once we withdraw from fantasy. Araki's film shows us what happens when death is no longer an abstract concern but a certainty. It demonstrates that a once life-driven Jon can lose all hope thanks to a medical diagnosis and thus embrace a death drive; it demonstrates that for all his bravado, Luke might not be the overtly self-destructive, death-seeking guy we saw in the first scenes. Life drive turns into death drive and vice versa (the extraordinary last scene condenses a powerful eroticism in contrast with an incontestable death wish). But one thing is clear: The veil has been removed and death no longer hides from mortal eyes. It's there, looking Jon and Luke right in the face. And they are looking back with a very fearless and subversive expression.",1320624000,3,4755,5.1688311688311686
872198,4,6304431856,"A film I enjoyed far more than I 'should' have, given how many individual moments I disliked.

Full of somewhat forced, wanna-be John Waters style humor that is sometimes funny, but
often just over-arch and clunky. And some of the acting is weak, the rest only pretty good.

Yet underneath it all there is something moving, raw and honest in its punky rage at the world

872332,3,6304431856,"This tiresome exercise in sexual and political button-pushing from gay arthouse director Gregg Araki is guaranteed to provoke renewed controversy in this tricked-out DVD release.  Whether it deserves the attention is another matter.

For this ""remixed and remastered"" DVD, some images have been tweaked and the sound is noticeably altered.  Fans may complain that all the raw edges of the original print have been filed down for a mass audience, and they'd be right.  Araki, who has only recently begun to live up to his early promise as a director, provides a smart commentary in which he compares THE LIVING END to a certain classic screwball comedy.  (I won't spoil the surprise by saying which one -- though film buffs will probably guess the title right away.)

As for the plot, in which an HIV-positive film critic hits the road with an HIV-positive hustler, it's mostly an excuse for mindless violence, anti-Republican propagandizing and assorted beefcake shots.  That said, the sex and violence in this film are not nearly as graphic as they seem, and much of what was deemed groundbreaking in 1992 barely raises an eyebrow today.  Although THE LIVING END is often touted as a major work of the New Queer Cinema, even Araki seems to understand how badly his film has dated.",1212192000,,1281,4.925581395348837

Two HIV Positive men, meet, are drawn to each other, head out on a rampage causing as much distruction as they can.  At the time it was controversial due to a rape scene.  The movie can lead to some interesting discussions and is probably more fun to watch with some friends than by yourself.",1207785600,,399,4.223684210526316
872334,2,6304431856,"AIDS may well be a disease allowed to fester and grow as the result of U.S. government policy. That IS the belief of many activists. And yet, today (2005) we see that even with all the information, the cautionary advice, knowledge about how to prevent and avoid AIDS, many in the gay population are ignoring that advice and eschewing any protection and even refusing medication as some believe that there is NO such thing as AIDS. Rather it is the medication that is causing the sickness.

When this film was made, it was full of sound and fury signifying ""something"", I'm sure. However, in retrospect, it is quite obviously a first attempt by a freshman director at writing and filming a feature film. On that front, it does not work.

The acting in The Living End is so poor that it was painfully difficult for me to watch the film through to the end. The staging and premises were stilted and hackneyed. It would seem that the actors were cast for their ""hunk"" factor and nothing more.

Araki has gone on to make more fully developed and complete films. The Living End is a film that started his career (though it wasn't really his first film) and certainly garnered him praise by the gonzo film set.

However, if you are looking for a fully realized film like his own Mysterious Skin - don't look here. Parting Glances is a film that provides a far more full realization of the anger that some feel regarding AIDS. So too is Longtime Companion. The Living End tries to be a gay/AIDS Thelma and Louise. It isn't.

I give it two stars for its efforts, but that is stretching it even in my book...",1132185600,2,1598,4.496551724137931

It is ""irresponsible"" in its depiction of violence and even violence between the lovers, but it's a thrill ride of a movie that has some sense of resolution and some sence of acceptance that I appreciated.

872338,5,6304431856,"Probably the greatest -- certainly the angriest and funniest -- film ever made about HIV+ young men.  It is 'dedicated' to a Republican government (George I) that cares nothing for its citizens with AIDS.

""The Living End"" is a remarkable love story.  It begins with Jon (Craig Gilmore) being rather glibly told that he is HIV+.  A mild-mannered film critic who never rocked the boat, Jon is dazed and confused.  Just as he is wondering what he will do next, Jon meets Luke (perfectly played by Mike Dytri), a stunningly handsome trouble-magnet (and the sweetest hunk you'll ever see) who is on the lam.  Their lives are changed forever.  With a super-heated film chemistry, Jon and Luke fall in love.  With nothing to lose, they set out on a darkly comic and violent crime spree -- Thelma and Louise with a twist.  The world around them is dangerous, and the road of love is rocky: they fight, break up, make up, make love, but find that, in the end, they still have each other.  Theirs is, quite simply, one of the most gut-wrenching and genuine love stories ever filmed.

This film masterpiece deserved a first class Criterion remastering, but the Strand Releasing version is the next best thing.  The picture is bright and clear and there are lots of extras. You will not be left unscathed, or untouched, by Araki's powerful gospel of Jon and the beautiful Luke.",1058486400,32,1366,4.69327731092437

Still, it has its moments, telling the story of two HIV-positive men who have nothing to lose, literally, including their lives.

 This is a love, all of us dream about! Luke is wild, physical and a little on the crazed-side, handy with a gun. But, he still can relate with his tender side as shown in the shower scene and his admitted love for Jon, as he tells Jon ""you will never find anyone who loves you the way I do"" And Jon soon realizes this ;  although he doesn't like the way Luke snuffs-out homophobic red-necks, he cannot tear himself away.
 At one point Jon kicks Luke out,then cannot get him out of his mind.
 Luke returns, enters Jon's apartment and Jon awakens to Luke standing before him with the gun in his mouth(this is one of the greatest scenes ever). If for no other reason, you have got to see this scene.
 They have their fights, but Luke always maintains his love for Jon. And you feel the deep love Jon has for Luke.

872426,5,6304431856,"""The Living End"" is an independent film in every sense of the word: no music, no production design or apparent costume design, no special effects or widescreen ratio, and no Hollywood gloss. What it does have it a simple story of two men involved in a ""Thelma and Louise"" storyline who share an offbeat, unconventional yet touching romance. Moments of black comedy tinged with violence and preachy dialogue provide a nice collaboration, though there are a few pitfalls involving the inclusion of supporting characters.
The story goes like this: two guys are introduced to us in separate lifestyles. Jon has just discovered that he is HIV-positive, though his outlook on life is not so hindered as he expected it would be. Luke, a drifter, makes his way to the city, where, upon brutally murdering three gay-bashers, he hitches a ride with unsuspecting Jon back to his place, where quaint small talk turns into a night of passion.
Right from the beginning, their attachment to one another is kinetic and bursting with energy, moreso than in the regular romances Hollywood pelts us with. Yet they have their disputes, and after a fight over Luke beating up a gay-basher, Jon demands that he leave, only to find that he cannot stop thinking about him. When Luke returns, he reveals that he has killed a cop, though Jon seems unmoved by the revelation, and continues to hold and embrace him, a very touching moment.
The two embark on a journey to nowhere, where they discover their love for one another and the many differences they share on their outlook on society and life itself. Luke knows that he loves Jon more than anything else in life, but Jon becomes unsettled by Luke's violent acts and short fuse. The movie then generates into a question of whether they will be together in the end or not.
Their relationship is unlike anything I've ever seen in a movie. At times, the rebel storyline takes a backseat to the passion shared by the two lovers. Luke's revelation of murder to Jon while in his arms is a very affecting moment, while sexual scenes shared between the two evolve into something more passionate and intimate, becoming more than just sex. Director/writer/editor/photographer Gregg Araki balances the sexual with the intimate in just the right manner.
Araki also balances their relationship with violent acts and black comedy, the kind which leaves us confused as to whether or not we should laugh or think harder. The dialogue shared between Jon and Luke involves a lot of societal discussion, mainly about how AIDS has become a social disease instead of a physical one. Luke's disdain for society's treatment of him leads him on in his rampage, while Jon follows him because of his deep emotional attachment to him.
More than just an examination of societal issues, the movie also uses the relationship between Jon and Luke to look at differences that can occur in a relationship. Jon is put off by the violence in his newfound love, and does not share the same beliefs as Luke. But that doesn't stop them from being together, nor does it succeed in tearing them apart. I think this is probably one of the strongest movie relationships portrayed in a film ever.
The convincing elements of the movie are due in major part to actors Mike Dytri, playing Luke, and Craig Gilmore, playing Jon. Their chemistry is full of sexual and emotional energy, and in these types of scenes, their talent is beautifully put to good use. Dytri does a good job of portraying Luke as hardened but retaining a soft spot for Jon, while Gilmore portrays Jon as timid yet strong.
So many good things come from this movie that my only complaint arises from the somewhat uninvolving storyline centering around Jon's friend, Darcy (Darcy Marta). While Jon is away on his adventure, she waits at home, sitting by the phone waiting for his call, driving her cheating boyfriend crazy. Her character seems a bit misplaced and uneven, though Marta's acting is certainly high-caliber.
I remember, in my preteen years, I once wrote a small series of short stories involving adventures between two men in love. Seeing ""The Living End"" brought back memories of those stories, while also moving me in a way that seems hidden from me. I can't really say why this movie hooked me as it did: perhaps the wonderful acting and the articulate romance, or the offbeat feel of the movie that is a welcome touch after so many glossy movies. What I can say is that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the most convincing. See it for what it really is: a heartfelt passionate love story amidst angst and societal furor.",993772800,22,4613,4.7675

7870794,4,6304431856,"A grim, nihilistic portrait of life on the edge.  Luke, a hustler, and Jon, a reviewer, both find out they are HIV+ in the early 1990's when the only medical treatment available was AZT, if it even worked.  Luke has already decided that there is nothing left to do but create mayhem in a world that's always been a battleground.  Jon, on the other hand, is simply beside himself.  Driving through Los Angeles, he runs into Luke who flags him down for a ride after committing a serial murder.  They become belligerent partners in crime, driving north to find a haven where they can live and die.  To understand this film at all, you have to appreciate the time in which it was made.  The queer rights movement was bogged down fighting the government over funding for AIDS research, better care for those infected and better access to experimental drugs.  (All of this could have gone more quickly had the government reacted appropriately to the epidemic when it first emerged instead of engaging in what can only be called homicidal neglect.)  There was no talk of gays in the military and not even the faintest glimmer of hope for something like same-sex marriage.  Basically, this period was the nadir for all queer folk, particularly those with HIV.  With this in mind, the writing and the character portrayals are entirely realistic.  It's all coarse and brazen but subversive - no one would expect ""pansies"" to act like this - and that's what gives this film a touch of very dark humor.  The acting is intensely neurotic, a somewhat dated style but well done nonetheless.  The direction and production quality are poor but this film barely had a budget so smooth camera work and even, textured directing were impossible.  Ultimately, the film's greatest achievement is the historical moment it captures and the desperation and desire for control over the inevitable that so many, so sadly had to deal with.",1494892800,3,1910,4.798165137614679

7870796,5,6304431856,"Gregg Araki is an auteur of the gay themed art house films genre. Living End is difficult to watch. Especially if you are HIV+ or have ever had a dysfunctional relationship. It is like a gay Thelma and Louise, but more brutal.
A character who has just found out that he is HIV+ meets a James Dean type rebel who is also HIV+. Together they decide to go out in a blaze of glory and hit the highway. The climax is brutal and disturbing. But living with HIV is not all happy trails.
If you are into the gay themed film genre, or specifically the HIV genre, Living End is a must have.",1457481600,,580,4.1415929203539825

7870798,5,6304431856,"shockingly good. Greg Araki= director, excellent. Shows how some people desire to escape the real world and seem to have more fun while others play by the rules but miss out on fun. An epic ending you will never forget, a movie you will always remember. You WILL want to watch this again, at some point. Beautifully done. As classic a movie as the breakfast club, only filled with sex and enduendo. The straight-laced guy reluctantly picks up a hustler on the run, and grudgingly is charned into romance while he convinces the hustler to not always play it safe and tries to show the hustler that love can be real. Both are forever changed. Don't expect happy endings in his films, but often are open ended and leave you both feeling good, wondering, pondering & contemplating. Par Excellente' A++++",1430611200,,799,4.714285714285714
7870799,3,6304431856,"Hey, remember the early 90s and there was this Queer cinema movement. Well i do, and this was one of the stand out films.
  The idea was better then the film the premiss, being a newly diagnosed HiV+ man meets another sexy brooding trouble maker for a road trip of distraction. The men fall more and more into trouble which would of made for a great subversive film. But Mr Ariki more interested in coming off as cool then making a really good film , fils the dialogue with very annoying and inaccurate political banter and band name dropping that the film come off as a sort of excersise in ""look how cool we are gay people like Ministry too"". This self conscious hipness and the lazy politics discussed throughout the film make it kinda annoying so you want them to just shut the hell up.
Mr Araki is a good filmmaker thoe which he proves in later years with films like Mysterious skin, its just the constant need for hipness both dates and makes the film very un hip , like the old saying if you have to say you like something you don't really like it. Well thats how allot of this film comes off. To bad a good revamp of the script and they would of had a better film.",1418860800,,1172,4.251121076233184
7870800,2,6304431856,Again another film with stereotypical uninteresting characters and very poor production values and third rate acting. What a waste of time.,1396137600,,139,5.666666666666667
7870801,4,6304431856,"I found this movie strangely mesmerizing.  Two gay guys from very different worlds are thrown together, and the strength of their attraction for each other overcomes the deep divide between them.  But will it last as they begin their ""Thelma and Louise"" drive around the western U.S.?  The ""bad guy"" is very sexy.",1393027200,,313,4.867924528301887
7870802,4,6304431856,I choose this rating because this move has some real twists and turns.  I liked this movie because it moved at a pace that you didn't know what was going to happen next.  I think most people would enjoy this movie.,1392163200,,214,4.195121951219512
