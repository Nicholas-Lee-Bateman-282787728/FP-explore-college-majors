1882733,5,B00009CHEA,"This is one of the finest live recordings ever!  It's also great to see the late Carlos Vega playing.  Remember, it's recorded almost 18 years ago!  Never done before ...",1034985600,,170,4.6
1882734,3,B00009CHEA,"With some of the best musicians, scores and recording producers and equipment in the business why use ""Image Entertainment""? I am now the sad owner of 2 of Image Entertainment's DVD's and in both cases they couldn't even get the action sinked with the music. I assume your buying your favorite artists music to injoy the visual and musical performance, this will only drive you crazy.",987292800,,384,4.833333333333333
1882735,5,B00009CHEA,"Carlos Vega, Abraham Laboriel, Lee Ritenour, Dave Grusin, Phil Perry... what more can one say about such a talented and powerful team like that? If you still haven't listened to Lee Ritenour's ""Collection"" CD  Album, you'll probably say to yourself ""Okay, no big surprise""  but if you take a better look at it, you'll notice that both percussion and  drums are played at the same time by Carlos Vegas (In the song ""Early  A.M. Attitude""). So incredible! And in Ritenour's Album, the person  responsible for the percussion is the wonderful ""Paulinho da  Costa"". What a major responsability for Mr. Vega! And he pulled it off  big time! And I'm not gonna say anything about Mr. Perry in the final song  ""Countdown"". He's one of the best male singers in the world, and  I'm not just saying that. You know what? Just see it for yourself!",962928000,,833,4.689655172413793
1882736,5,B00009CHEA,"This DVD is a must for any fan of these two modern jazz giants. Although I must admit that the video is a bit dated in appearance (just check the Miami Vice-style clothes and hair), it is truly a joy to watch.  Rit and  Dave deliver the goods as usual, and their choice of backup musicians only  lends another positive aspect to the performances.  Ivan Lins is  enthralling with his performance of ""Harlequin"", while his  beautiful voice hypnotizes the listener on ""The Island"".  Great  to see the late Carlos Vega on drums as well.",962841600,,532,4.585106382978723
1882737,4,B00009CHEA,"Very nice concert, with good sound and good transfer to DVD. I especially  appreciated the participation of the Brazilian singer Ivan Lins. If you  like Brazilian Music (as I do), there is another DVD from Lee Ritenour  called Lee Ritenour & Friends #1 & 2 (1991) with the participation  of  Joao Bosco.",961372800,,303,4.75
1882738,4,B00009CHEA,What can I say? These guys are the cream of the crop. The flute performance by Dave Valentin is worth the price alone. I sat in awe watching some of my favorite musicians treat the crowd to a spectacular  show. The only complaint I have is that its too short. There was alot of  music played at this concert but for some reason they chose not to include  it all.,948153600,,362,4.142857142857143
1882739,1,B00009CHEA,"If you like smooth jazz maybe you'll like this DVD. I have a cd of the GRP All-Stars Big Band and those guys really smoke! This is a very lame, very smooth, very boring performance, an example of good musicians playing  extremely dull music. I've heard them do better.",947635200,,268,4.469387755102041
7990555,4,B00009CHEA,I haven't given GRP Super a fair listening as yet. The others are fine,1515715200,,70,4.071428571428571
7990556,5,B00009CHEA,recommend product arrived at the right time! as far as possible met my expectation. probably go back to buy. Quality product.,1399593600,,125,5.0
7990557,3,B00009CHEA,"Cool to have such an old piec of history. Very good instrumentalists, but I must agree I've seen them do better. One song is awesome - the reason I bought this DVD - the song `Countdown'. Marvelous! But the rest is a bit disapointing.",1276473600,,234,4.340909090909091
7990558,4,B00009CHEA,"This music video (DVD) is a display of fantastic musicianship fron Dave Grusin, Lee Ritenour, Ivan Lins, and Carlos Vega as main performers. Abe Laboriel (bass) and Larry Williams (keyboard) lending support. Sound is great even though this was originally in VHS format. I particularly enjoyed Harlequin sang by Ivan with a lot of emotion and Mountain Dance one of many Dave Grusin signature hits. It is well worth the steep price I paid for and a great addition to my Dave Grusin collection.",1268611200,,491,4.857142857142857
7990559,5,B00009CHEA,"I have a VHS of this concert I got from the library, and it's fantastic! And the sound seems ok for VHS. Am I to deduce by the comments herein that the sound on this DVD is of lesser quality than could be expected on a 20 year old VHS??? Was hoping the $70 might offer some improvement. Anyone?",1150416000,,294,4.0
7990560,4,B00009CHEA,"I remember first seeing and hearing this music when I was in Music college. The quality ofthe recordings was, at the time, unequalled in instrumental music.

My bandmatess and I even learned 'Rio Funk', and played it regularly. It is great to watch Carlos Vega play the drums again, and to see just how bad the hair and clothes were in the mid-80's (Lee Ritenour has a pastel outfit on that would have made Miami Vice think twice) If you want to watch a superb ""live-in studio"" recording with some master players, this will not disappoint!!",1121817600,,540,4.625
7990561,4,B00009CHEA,"First, to Mario Toni in Zagreb: ""Oasis"" is a Dave Valentin song, originally from his album ""Jungle Dreams.""  It is out of print, but follow eBay or other places to get used stuff.

For Balonkuada5, the ""GRP Super Live in Concert"" was taped in Japan in 1987.  As for ""Live in Session"", well, sit back, I got a little story to tell.  On August 14, 1985, a concert of GRP artists was held in the big room at the Record Plant.  It was recorded for both audio and video release.  The lineup was Dave Grusin (keyboards), Lee Ritenour (guitar), Dianne Schuur (vocals), Dave Valentin (flute), and Ivan Lins (keyboards, vocals).  The backing band consisted of Larry Williams (keyboards, sax), Abraham Laboriel (bass), and Carlos Vega (drums).  A special guest, Phil Perry, was brought in to sing on Lee Ritenour's ""Countdown.""

This single concert was released to the public in several variations - none of them complete.  There was a CD called ""GRP Live in Session"" and a video called ""GRP Live in Session"", with identical covers but different tracks.  Then there was a LaserDisc/VHS release called ""GRP All-Stars Live from the Record Plant"" with yet another combination of tracks. That's the DVD you're looking at now.  There is also a release called ""Dave Grusin & Lee Ritenour Live at the Record Plant""; it appears to consist of the performances not on the ""All Stars Live"" release (although, its title notwithstanding, it features Lins and Schuur spotlights).  Confused yet?

I've been hoping for years that there would be a single release of the entire show, end to end and in original sequence, but I've stopped holding my breath.  The rights to both audio and video are scattered and long since left the domain of the esteemed Mr Grusin.  But still, if you get the two DVD's I mentioned, you probably have everything there is to have, which is a rare combination of talent, inspired performances, and exquisite sound & video quality.",1095638400,,1932,4.8090909090909095
7990562,4,B00009CHEA,"I have a copy of this concert on vhs and it is great, but I am still not sure should I buy the dvd or not, because of the reviews about the sound quality. But, the main thing I am writing this is to ask if any of you could help me and tell me whose song is this song ""OASIS"" originaly and on which cd is the original studio version of that song. I searched the whole net and still could not find anything about this song!!! Please help!!!!!!!",1094688000,,442,3.922222222222222
7990563,4,B00009CHEA,"This actually a question rather than a review.  I just would like to know what is the difference between this video compared to the ""GRP Live In Session"" or the ""GRP Super Live In Concert"" video",1075248000,,194,4.388888888888889
7990564,4,B00009CHEA,"This is an excellent live recording.  While Lee Ritenour is an incredible guitarist, playing with Dave Grusin makes him even more impressive.  I would highly recommend this disk to anyone that enjoys Lee's work.  You won't be dissapointed.",1036713600,,239,5.2368421052631575
