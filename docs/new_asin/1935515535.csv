203446,4,1935515535,"We purchased little pim in Russian for our 18 months toddler just two weeks ago. First she wasn't very interested but now she gets very excited when I turn it on and asks to replay it several times. She doesn't repeat the words yet, but watches the dvd very carefully. Actually she repeats the words but in English. Like a translation. The program introduces simple words of every day use: names of food,simple actions...  So I'm thinking that in the long run she'll learn enough of the basics of Russian.",1271116800,4,505,4.611111111111111
203447,5,1935515535,Love the short episodes and little Pims gorgeous voice. My 16 month old has never watched tv and is not usually interested but this held his attention for the right amount of time and encourages interaction.,1267315200,,207,4.777777777777778
203448,1,1935515535,"The producer's name is Pimsleur, but this is misleading because she has absolutely no affiliation with Paul Pimsleur, the language scholar, nor the world-famous Pimsleur approach to learning languages. Julia Pimsleur piggybacks off of his name alone to sell these language videos for kids, and does not use any of the Pimsleur techniques, such as graduated interval recall. Don't buy this set for the name, it is a sneaky, underhanded dirty trick.",1257552000,22,447,5.222222222222222
203449,4,1935515535,"I recently heard my three-year-old daughter telling my younger daughter, ""I know another way to say 'milk'.  You say 'leche'.""  That was after watching the first DVD about four or five times.  My children just love Little Pim! They seem to learn from him so quickly.  He is cute, funny, and informative; he does a great job keeping them riveted.  I like that he is the only one that talks because then the accent and pronounciation are uniform for the child to copy.  The immersion idea is great, though I've been very thankful for the English subtitles when watching them for the first time.  My only complaints are that on one occasion, Little Pim acts like a dog in a crude effort to be funny, and that sometimes the mothers' necklines are a bit too low for viewing-comfort, but I would highly recommend these videos as the best thing I've seen for children learning Spanish.  I wish they would make a follow-up set for the next age-group.  This set of videos was well-worth my money.",1242345600,16,987,4.594285714285714
203450,3,1935515535,Videos are ok.  Not very exciting.  My child still prefers Yo Gabba Gabba.,1240617600,2,74,4.615384615384615
203451,5,1935515535,"My son showed interest in Spanish while watching Dora so I bought this video to take him one step further when he was almost 3. I was amazed to see that not only he sat there watching with interest but he also repeated words and small dialogues in Spanish. He would never talk Spanish with us (we don't really speak anyways) but when we met a couple of Mexican friends this summer he could exchange greeting with them and answer simple questions such as what color is your shirt or what do you want to eat. They were amazed at his accent and said he did not sound American at all (however it did not work on me who is trying to learn with him, I'm probably too old to get the native's accent).
On a technical point of view, the program is very well done,  A succession of short sequences keep the interest and attention of the young viewer alive. A little gap after each word or sentence enable the child to repeat or internalize the vocabulary. The same words are presented in different scenes. I guess I don't really need to develop on this with all the awards it received.
In short I really recommend it and I'm delighted that I have discovered it.",1222041600,62,1151,4.328703703703703
203452,5,1935515535,"My 2 year old son loves to watch this series.  We've had it for a month now and he still asks for it daily.  He's said one word in Spanish so far, but I think is really taking it in.  Although I speak Spanish almost fluently, I didn't know where to begin with teaching my son so I think this is a good beginning.  It's far better than some other programs I've seen which are either boring or just a word here or there so they don't learn much.  I'd like to try the other languages too.",1203638400,7,485,3.9587628865979383

203454,5,1935515535,"We just got this yesterday. I showed it to my 2 year old son a few times throughout the day and he was getting into it. Then he woke up at 4 am to bring me the box so he could watch it. I made him go back to bed, so he cuddled with the box and fell back to sleep. I love these videos that make learning so much fun for kids. I'm really excited to see his Spanish vocabulary expand from these.
In addition to these, I also HIGHLY recommend the Preschool Prep DVDs. They have English and Spanish, and son was recognizing his alphabet, colors, numbers, shapes and sight words by the time he was 12 months, and starting to say them all at 15 months. They are wonderful.",1421193600,2,665,4.045454545454546

203459,5,1935515535,"For this review I chose the Spanish DVD  - PLAYTIME from Little Pim. I decided to check out the Spanish DVD so I could brush up on my High School Spanish - It has been more years than I care to admit since I took Spanish in High School but I still remember some.

I had the opportunity recently to try to understand and converse with someone who speaks mostly Spanish with a little English - It was easier since I have been watching the Spanish DVD with my youngest from Little Pim.

The DVD is cute, and the panda is adorable and I love the Option of adding Subtitles (so I can cheat when  necessary - lol)  The complete Immersion method makes it so that the child (and parent) watching the DVD hear the same word or phrase repeated over and over in the language they are trying to learn - it helps when I encourage my daughter to repeat the words or phrases with the Panda on the screen.

If you want to have your child learn a second language, and are willing to start them young - then Little Pim does have great quality products to assist with that.

203462,4,1935515535,I bought the DVD so my parents could play it in the car while babysitting. The 7-year old is less impressed but still learning while the 3-year loves it over the other educational DVDs in the car. She will randomly start counting and greeting in Spanish.

203464,3,1935515535,Purchased these for my toddlers. They didn't love them but they are nicely done and hold their attention long enough to make a snack. Nice music and good for teaching early Spanish.,1385251200,,181,4.6875
203465,3,1935515535,"I can see this video being quite useful if your child is older than 1 1/2 years. I got this video for my nephew & he was totally uninterested with the video. It's pretty slow moving & not very entertaining. Even I was bored watching it. There would basically be an apple and they would say manzana very slow, and repeat it maybe 15 times, then move on to maybe a banana, and do the same for that. This was the whole video. Maybe when my nephew is older he will be more interested in the video.",1372636800,,493,4.092783505154639
203466,3,1935515535,"I checked these DVDs out of the library and am glad I didn't buy them.  They cover a lot of vocabulary and are entirely in Spanish, which is great, but they bore my 3-year-old (& me) pretty quickly -- it's just one word or phrase (with short video clip to show the meaning) after another -- there's no story.  My daughter doesn't get to watch much TV, so it's a real treat for her; nonetheless, she was totally not excited when I suggested she could watch these the second time around.  Little Pim also shows the word or phrase in writing (which is helpful for me, but not yet for my daughter).  I would recommend the Whistlefritz Spanish for Kids DVDs over these because they're more engaging -- they have a bit of a story, interspersed with fun songs.  If you've seen all of those, you might try supplementing with these, but don't be surprised if your kid doesn't want to watch them.",1370822400,28,886,4.411042944785276
203467,4,1935515535,Not as good as Fritzi but we like them.  They have a review after each section to reinforce the learning.,1369526400,,105,4.25
203468,5,1935515535,I bought this for my little granddaughters.  They love it!  They now are using Spanish words and have increased their chances of being able to communicate with some of the many Spanish speaking neighbors.,1369440000,,204,4.970588235294118

203470,4,1935515535,"I like this set, but I feel I made a mistake in purchasing it for my five-year-old. It simply isn't challenging enough or entertaining enough for her age level. I am keeping the set because I also have a one-year-old and I expect in about a year it will be perfect for her. It is a good starter set but in no way a complete curriculum.",1361404800,,335,4.090909090909091
203471,3,1935515535,So far both of my kids enjoy watching Little Pim and I do hear them reapeating a lot of the Spanish. Especially my 2 year old daughter. I like these movies very much. The only down side I find is the length of the videos. For 45 dollars they could have given you at least 45 minutes to an hour on each video. I do think they are over priced for their movies.,1355875200,2,358,3.9178082191780823
203472,4,1935515535,Volume one had actual chinese characters.  This volume does not.  Regardless my baby is mesmerized by it.  It is the only DVD she sits still for.,1355270400,,145,4.5
203473,3,1935515535,"After winning Little Pim Spanish Bop, viewing Little Pim Spanish Volume I and deciding to purchase the rest of the Spanish and Arabic programs, I've got one major issue and I feel like the Jimmy Dean sausage complaint caller a little but: why isn't the Arabic version available in Volume II? where is the Arabic Bop? I'm serious! Those are my number one and two complaints! Music is KEY! Where is Arabic Bop!?! We have lots of Arabic children's music but I want Little Pim Arabic Bop songs that focus on activities my one year old son does on a regular basis.

I do NOT like the transliterations that Little Pim placed all over the place. For one thing, they aren't the same ones that are commonly used by others that include the use of numbers to denote certain sounds that we don't have in English. For another thing, they are silly and somewhat defeat the purpose for people that actually CAN read Arabic and want their children to be able to read Arabic. When I read books to my son in Arabic, they do NOT have transliteration. Where does one even get such things? In any case, they have Arabic script.

This is the single most annoying thing about Little Pim videos: these weird, useless transliterations. If I had to guess about one single reason why the Spanish program has taken off but the Arabic one hasn't, it's because of these transliterations. People that are teaching their children Arabic are either already going to know the Arabic alphabet OR they are going to find out very quickly after watching Little Pim that they need to learn it or they won't be able to use anything BUT Little Pim while teaching their kids Arabic. It's a mere annoyance for those who belong to the former category and it's a hindrance for those in the latter.

But this is the most important thing: those transliterations are only annoying to ME, the ADULT and this program is NOT for an adult learner of Arabic. This is for kids. If you want to learn Arabic, you should buy the adult Pimsleur products. As far as Little Pim goes, my kid is NOT old enough to be offended at the use of transliteration instead of good old Arabic script. And for those who argue that it's not helpful for parents counting on Little Pim to teach their kids Arabic, seriously!?!

If you are counting on ANY video series to teach ANY foreign language to your kids instead of (not as a supplement to) your own usage (in conversation and with books YOU read and songs YOU sing), you might be a tad bit disappointed because I can tell you--as someone who not only knows multiple languages myself but has been both a military language instructor and a certified K-12 bilingual teacher in two states read: understands how both adults and children learn--that is NOT how children learn more than a smattering of words in any language. So, how DO children learn language?

For one thing, the first words children learn are usually the ones that are most relevant to them, not the fancy schmancy ones that impress adults. I've tried several programs--in fact, I was initially put off by Little Pim because I thought it would be too ""teacher-ly""--but this is THE most age appropriate foreign language program I've found for my son who does not have any use whatsoever for knowing his ABCs, or 123s (as commonly addressed in other foreign language programs) when he can't even talk yet, much less go to school!

He eats, drinks, plays, sleeps, laughs, cries, poops and pees. Like Baby Signing Time, Little Pim realizes that my son isn't going to use language that impresses people but rather, language that helps him accomplish his daily activities. I talk and read about these things (eating, pooping, sleeping, etc) in these languages on their designated days (we use a language of the day format because we speak three languages at home) but it's still nice to have video and music (where is my Arabic Bop!?! where is it!?!) that reinforce this vocabulary.

Which is why Plaza Sesamo, Alwan, Little Thinking Minds, Iftah ya Simsim, Lulu wa Marmar, Tareq wa Shireen and Whistlefritz just aren't cutting it in this household. Sure, they are a bit more entertaining than Little Pim. However, I also find one word picture books abysmally boring while still ensuring that my son has a good collection of them because I know how important they are for HIS development, read: his development is more important than my entertainment.

So, that is why I give this product three stars. What? After all that you only give it three stars. Uh, yeah. Because there is no MUSIC!!! Babies like music and it makes these boring programs more tolerable for adults. If it had music it would get a four, just like Baby Signing Time. Unfortunately, Baby Signing Time doesn't  speak Arabic so Little Pim it is. What about a five? Well, throw in some puppets and you get a five. No puppets, no music? No five.

It costs too much as well but ALL children's DVDs cost too much IMHO so I won't hold that against them.",1353628800,3,4954,4.632118451025057
203474,5,1935515535,"My son is almost two years old now. It is difficult to encourage my son to imitate words and sounds. He mostly listens and he seems to prefer signing to speaking. Imagine my surprise when we were watching Little Pim for the first time together and he said new words! As I do with all his educational programs, I played ""his part"" repeating the important words and sentences. He usually doesn't join in, but while watching Little Pim, he said, ""papa"" for the first time, making his father very very happy. He only used a sign for daddy before! I'm very pleased. The method of teaching language is very intuitive, and even I picked a bit more Spanish up since I'm just a beginner myself. This is going into regular rotation in our house.",1351468800,,735,4.492537313432836
203475,4,1935515535,"Very expensive the content seemed boring to me. However, my 3 year old likes it I think because it shows kids eating and sleeping

203476,5,1935515535,We are a bilangual household and this just what we were looking for to distract our 2 year old while feeding our newborn. It is simple and accurate. This isn't a program to teach your little one another language but rather to reinforce language skills that are already being taught.,1344297600,,282,4.66
203477,5,1935515535,"My son loves Little Pim.  He asks to watch ""The Panda"" everyday.  He repeats the words & phrases and really enjoys learning.

My wife speaks French with him and teta (grandma) Arabic. Contrary to the other reviews where somebody criticized the volume of the background music, I found this not a problem. The music is a bit annoying as is Pim's voice (too high pitched for my ears) but my son seems to enjoy watching them and there is a good mix of playful ""cartoon"" elements where Pim and his friends play around with ""academic"" elements where words are repeated in German. I will buy the remaining DVD's in this series and am happy with the purchase.",1315008000,,664,4.588235294117647

For the most part, the videos are good - appropriate subject and vocabulary selection, fun little panda to watch and hear, and clips of little kids showing the topic.

However, for someone trying to use this video to build language abilities, it will hinder literacy because the words are displayed in Latin letters instead of Cyrillic.  These transliterations are often inaccurate and inconsistent.

Also, when teaching shapes and colors, it was difficult for my daughter to tell which was being said, the color or shape.  I was able to help her out, but a parent who doesn't know the language may have a hard time as well.

It also would have been nice to hear other kids saying the words, but that would require the producers to actually create separate videos for each language.

Overall, with very little competition, this series was probably the best buy for children's language DVDs.",1309305600,,1069,4.709677419354839

He is 19 months old and doesn't speak - either English or French. So, I can't tell you how effective this is for acquisition of another language. I can just tell you that he watches this for between 10-15 minutes with absolute attention. A short break once or twice a day for me to get the dinner fixed without too much guilt that I am rotting his brain with tv. In fact, I feel that he is learning something.

We also do French class once a week and there is no question in my mind that these DVDs are better value for money at present. I wish there were more available for him. Something a little more exciting for me would be good!

Having said that, my Dad is also trying to learn French and he loved Little Pim for the pronunciation of difficult words. I have to agree that I am improving in that respect too.",1308355200,,962,4.161290322580645

With this 3-DVD-pack, you get something that, I believe, could have been packed on only one.

The Box states it contains a ""parent guide with helpful tips"" : well, you'll find a sheet of paper with some obvious tips or remarks that I would hardly call ""guide"".

The Episodes inside are not too bad, if you accept the fact that it is all VERY simple : no background story, no introductory context. It directly begins with the animated panda, and then young children in close-up eating or drinking (dvd 1). (I'd think you'll first learn how to say ""hello"" for instance ?).
The scenes are nice, colorful, and the words clearly spoken (by one voice only), and it's true to say that toddlers and young children enjoy seeing children at the same age.

I really miss three things here:
- some event simple background story/plot line that
- lot more interactivity (questions + time to answer them)
- songs and rhymes !

203488,2,1935515535,"We received the 3-DVD Arabic set as a gift and were excited because my husband is from an Arabic-speaking country and because there are very few resources for US children to learn Arabic.  I have studied many languages and, based on my experience, this product is not particularly helpful for either children or adults to learn.  First, rather than making the DVDs culture-specific it seems that the producers just shot one set of scenes and then overdubbed each language. The Arabic ""eating"" DVD teaches you about tortillas! Second, the language is taught not by building blocks like ""I"" plus ""want"" plus ""banana"" but rather they will say the word for banana and then use it in rapid succession in 3-4 sentences, then the DVD moves on to another concept.  The sentences are stated quickly and there is no opportunity to repeat what is said.  There is also no dialog or conversation on which to model behavior or imitate, such as the child asking her mother for a banana (or pencil etc) please, receiving it, and saying thank you; manners are omitted altogether.  Many of the sentences are in third person (such as she stretches, he wakes up) which is of no interest to a young child who at this age is still quite egocentric.  The child quickly loses interest in watching.  The parents can't keep up either, because the DVD goes too quickly so you can't possibly simultaneously process the English subtitle and the phonetic Arabic script and the poorly-enunciated pipsqueak Panda voice, which many times bore no resemblance to the phonetic Arabic provided and which was not on the screen long enough to read.  The phonetic Arabic is maddening, because if you are trying to learn Arabic you probably have in the household a native speaker or an adult also studying it, and in this case the phonetic just blows your mind.  I do wish this came with true Arabic script, and a module that taught the letters individually and in an ABC-type song, which might help one actually learn the language.  If they are going to stick with phonetic they should at least highlight the letters in yellow as the panda is speaking them so that you can better understand the panda voice.  I also wish this were supplemented with just vocabulary, either on screen or in flashcard form, so that children could learn the individual words and form their own sentences rather than trying to memorize long fully formed sentences which may never be applicable in that exact form.  Finally given that there are many different dialects of Arabic, each with completely unique vocabularies, I wish the producers had either included these different dialects or at least revealed in the packaging exactly which Arabic language the DVDs contain, so that a consumer can make an intelligent decision regarding usefulness.  We'll give the DVDs a few more tries but I don't hold out much hope for it teaching us anything.",1298160000,32,2883,4.835365853658536

Even my 4,6, and 8 year olds watch it and are mesmorized.  So glad we found this!  Great start to the German language. Wunderbar!!!!",1292889600,,261,4.14
203491,3,1935515535,"Good product (I like everything ""Pimsleur"" actually) but I gave it only 3 stars - I really don't understand why they could make subtitles in Chinese characters (in Chinese Mandarin version) but couldn't do the subtitles in Russian letters here? Why ""VADA"" (in latin letters) insted of how it is written in Russian (cyrillic letters) for example? Or are Russian letters more complex then Chinese Characters for making subtitles? It looks very strange and annoying for me and I suspect it is wrong for learning Russian language.",1276732800,9,526,5.057471264367816
203492,5,1935515535,I got this DVD for my 4-year old granddaughter who is taking several languages.  She already has Little Pim for Mandarin.  Her father transferred both language DVDs to his iPod Touch and she uses them frequently when she has a few minutes in the car or other quiet times at home.  This is a GREAT learning tool. I should mention that she does not watch TV; she plays with other toys and her Little Pim DVDs.,1273104000,5,407,4.328947368421052
7801948,3,1935515535,"Bought these for my son.  He is just barely over the recommended age range.  He didn't like them.  He said he often had trouble knowing what they were talking about.  Say they were going to teach the word egg.  They say the word in Japanese and show eggs over and over while saying the word.  Great idea, great method to teach a language, but my son said while they were saying the word, too many things were on the screen and he didn't know which one went with the word.  I took some Japanese so I didn't notice that at first, since I knew most of the words, but after he said that, I realized that he is right.  It made it tough to associate the word with said item because, in some cases, it just wasn't clear.  It is a great idea, but it just didn't work for us.",1513209600,,766,4.053333333333334
