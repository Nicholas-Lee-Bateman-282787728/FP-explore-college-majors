8455243,1,B0053HLZSG,"I have been a dancer for 20 years and did a lot of country two step in the 90's. I forgot so many moves and there are many I never learned. I want to get back into country two step dancing and need some good moves, turns and patterns. I bought the first two dvd's in these series of eight and I am very, very disappointed. Shawn is always very slow for experienced dancers when giving lessons, and on the first two dvds he has trouble speaking clearly and is not smooth. The amount of material on each dvd is extremely limited and a real ripe of at the prices being charged. The site does not explain what is covered on each dvd, so buying them is a shot in the dark. Very disappointing for experienced dancers because the pace is way too slow and very little material is presented. On top of that, some moves seem awkward and impractical for the dance floor. I will not buy any more dvds by Shawn. They are good for the very beginner, but almost worthless for experienced dancers who want to pick up new moves and patterns.",1491004800,,1024,4.256410256410256
8455244,5,B0053HLZSG,Really love these videos I love the tie in from the previous lessons really make it feel like im in the studio with him. The fact that the go over both partners parts in the dance really helps me out so I know what's going on from both sides of the floor. I would recommend these to anyone.,1436400000,,290,4.017241379310345
8455245,5,B0053HLZSG,"I cant say enough about these DVDs.  Shawn and Nicole make learning the two step fun and easy.  The Moves and Patterns DVDs help you reinforce your basics and push you to try new moves all at the same time!  I really love how each DVD has an overview of what youll be learning at the beginning, and then has a bonus section at the end that where Shawn gives you a variety of options of ways you can incorporate all the new moves into your dancing.  I cant wait to get on the dance floor and try them out!",1394582400,,504,4.01
8455246,5,B0053HLZSG,"Vol. 2 continues to build off Vol. 1., focusing on hand changes, special techniques for outside torque turns/ guy turn/ lady free turn/ wrap.

This is another of my favorite volumes because these moves are very popular in the country dance halls, which some guys do incorrectly.  It's one thing to go through the motions on the dance floor, sure you can stumble through it on a dance floor, but it's quite another to hit the move with good hand placement, in step, with rhythm.  Shawn and Nicole teach you key micro hand movements along with many tips that guys MUST do (and girls MUST learn what the guys are trying to do) in order for the moves to work properly.

You simply cannot pick up the subtle hand changes or hand placements by observing people on the dance floor because it all happens way too fast; the moves will be invisible to you.  The instruction from Shawn and Nicole are superb, as usual!  They breakdown these subtle moves piece by piece so you can perfect them.

Let me give you an example of what happens if you do NOT use the tips Shawn teaches in the video: When I practiced the sequence of dance moves (in Section 1 of the DVD, outside torque turn + 1 guy turn + lady free turn) over the weekend at my local country dance hall, the girls spun too fast, or too many times, or were confused.  Why is that?  Because ""I"" failed to execute the moves correctly!  When I went back to the DVD to see what happened, I noticed I was not using the tips Shawn taught me!  I needed to stop the girl from turning by using the little trick (for guys) Shawn taught in the video.  That's why it's so important to use the tips Shawn/Nicole give you, otherwise you're just going through the basic motions.  You should practice exactly what's in the DVDs, and go back to review to check if you've missed anything, often you'll see that extra tip you need to add into your moves.

Nice to see the different angles. I would definitely recommend this Volume.",1368403200,,1960,4.393351800554017
8455247,5,B0053HLZSG,"In Volume 2 of Two-Step Moves & Patterns, Shawn breaks down wraps and turns that look complicated but within minutes you're dancing right along with him.  Using my very basic knowledge of Two-Step, I was able to learn all the moves in a short time.  Can't wait for the next Volume.",1310342400,,281,4.490196078431373
8455248,5,B0053HLZSG,Wow! I am really pleased with this latest set of Two-Step DVD videos from Shawn Trautman. I have several of his previous videos including the Basic Two-Step three DVD set. The first two DVDs of this intermediate level set that I have studied are just awesome. This second DVD in the series covers the cape and wrap patterns that will be the foundation for more patterns. The pattern moves are repeated several times and shown from different angles so that you can see all the subtleties of the different patterns presented. Then there are review and practice chapters on each DVD. And then there is a bonus chapter on each DVD with optional moves that can be added to the patterns presented before. I really feel that now I can go out on the dance floor and look like I know something about this dance. I am looking forward to the release of the remainder of this set of DVDs. I would highly recommend this new DVD set to anyone wanting to improve their Two-Step knowledge.,1308355200,,973,4.534090909090909
