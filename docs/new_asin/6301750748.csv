and his boyish charms makes it special. This is one of his lesser known films, but well worth purchasing.",1418169600,2,243,4.674418604651163

367533,5,6301750748,"One of my all time favorite James Cagney movies. James Cagney is arrested as vagrant, Tom Richards (who was a newspaper reporter), comes into a corrupt town run by a crooked politician and assists this old woman Vinnie McLeod (played by Grace George); who runs a newspaper and is fighting the corrupt city officials. Richards is referred to as a ""Johnny Come Lately"" by those crooked politicians because he wanders into the town and assists Mrs. McLeod and her newspaper in their battle. This movie also has Hattie McDaniels as Mrs. McLeod's housekeeper and Marjorie Main as a saloon keeper. A Great story and even better movie.",1399248000,3,628,4.878504672897196
367534,4,6301750748,"Disciples of James Cagney may be a little surprised to see the actor in such a tender, atypical Cagney movie as JOHNNY COME LATELY (1943).  Not only does he portray a less angry, much more subdued character than in his other films, but this story also takes him out of his usual modern big city setting and places him in a 1906 rural village.

Jimmy plays a vagabond reporter, who briefly interrupts his wanderings to help a kind, lovely old lady newspaper publisher fight political corruption in her small town.

Produced by Cagney and his brother, William, as the initial offering of their independent film company, the entertaining picture exudes charm over violence, though there is one exciting action sequence when Jimmy stops the local toughs from murdering his elderly employer.

Broadway star Grace George, in her first and only screen role, almost steals the film from Cagney, playing the quiet, gracious lady whom he befriends.  The capable supporting cast is headed by Marjorie Main, Hattie McDaniel, Marjorie Lord and Ed McNamara.  William K. Howard directed.

367537,3,6301750748,"It is not often in any James Cagney film that anyone else manages to steal more than a few scenes. Cagney did get top billing in JOHNNY COME LATELY, but he does not even make an entrance until way past the first reel. When the film begins, Grace George, who plays newspaper publisher Vinnie McLeod, is seen as the dramatic center. Her newspaper is going broke, mostly because of a local corrupt politician who is angry over the muckracking editorials of her paper. Along comes an erudite tramp Tom (Cagney), who promptly gets arrested for vagrancy but is saved from the chain gang by Miss McLeod who offers him a job as a reporter. At this point, I was not sure whether the film was headed for the land of romance (Marjorie Lord plays Miss McLeod's niece who breaks up with her boyfriend) or the gritty and sordid world of realpolitik journalism, sort of a pre-WW2 ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. Part of the problem that director William K. Howard failed to resolve is that he could not set a consistent tone with which the audience would feel comfortable. Further, Howard hints at a romance between Lord and Cagney that fizzles out, leaving Cagney without much to do except go after the town bad guy. Still, Cagney manages to infuse JOHNNY COME LATELY with the vitality that his fans had come to expect. There is even a badly choreographed fist fight between him and Lord's boyfriend that ought never have happened, but director Howard obviously felt the need for the two to duke it out. Since Cagney was limited to muckraking, he shared center stage with a bravura performance by Marjorie Main, who plays brothel owner Mary McGregor, who whoops it up and rouses the town against the evil politician. For those who have a sharp eye for second tier actors, keep an eye out for Arthur Hunnicut, who later starred with Miss Main in the Ma and Pa Kettle film series. There is also Hattie McDaniel, who as Aida the maid, is again the brusque Mammy from her GONE WITH THE WIND days. JOHNNY COME LATELY is far from Cagney's best, but it is a tribute to his talents that he can make a grade B film seem far more interesting than it would have been without him.",1053907200,5,2147,4.536082474226804
367538,3,6301750748,"The great stage actress Grace George (she looks like an elderly Billie Burke) is okay in her only film as Vinnie McLeod but one thinks she could have found a more suitable vehicle. As the itinerant journalist who's  jailed for vagrancy, Cagney does as well as can be expected as Tom. Main  steals the show as Gashouse Mary (her ex-husband was addicted to catsup!),  and there is Margaret Hamilton and Hattie McDaniel (as Aida) in supporting  roles. Marjorie Lord is pretty enough to look at yet strangely lacklustre  and wooden. This rather feeble comedy-drama was produced by Cagney's  brother William and although the period costumes are authentic, the script  is lame. Based on the novel ""McLeod's Folly"" by Louis Bromfield,  this film is pleasant enough, but it simply never catches fire.",947116800,7,792,4.99236641221374
