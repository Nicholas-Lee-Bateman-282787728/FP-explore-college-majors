7906951,5,B00000F6TZ,"Yes, this documentary dates back from the 70's, yes elements have been disclosed since, but it still is relevant at the time when a petition is being laughed to have Ethel Rosenberg exonerated, and when lots of elements of the trial are still kept secret by government agencies.",1478563200,,278,4.8125
7906952,5,B00000F6TZ,Very interesting documentary that is presented well and proves in my mind that two people were murdered (I believe Ethel was Innocent and Julius was guilty of crime that didn't deserve the death penalty) more for being Jewish than for spies.,1455148800,,241,4.902439024390244
7906953,5,B00000F6TZ,The Rosenberg story is a sad one about working against your own fellow Americans and your country.,1427414400,,98,4.823529411764706
7906954,5,B00000F6TZ,"Making Examples by killing parents of children is sick.  Other worse spies got away in the 40s and today and ones working now will get away sometimes.  Read books about spies during The American Revolution.  Some ignorant people still believe that spies did NOT allow The Russians to get The Bomb quickly; they think it was Science at fault.  Sure, The Russians were just as smart--they eventually made the biggest H-bomb ever detonated--but spies only need to pass on a few blueprints and not so subtle hints and thus so-called Big Secrets fall.  Yes, Science has no Ten Commandments about uses; many protested the A-bomb but were stifled.  Marie Curie put vials of radium in her pocket and eventually paid the price.  It is a long an horrifying history.  The sci-fi masterpiece THE STARS MY DESTINATION describes a material that goes off explosively JUST BY THINKING ABOUT IT.  No one knows what may be next in reality.  Ask Hyman Rickover; he predicted nuclear Armageddon.",1423612800,,975,4.890243902439025
7906955,3,B00000F6TZ,"This documentary was done in 1978 by PBS as a retrospective of the infamous espionage trial in 1953. It has some original photos and film clips which make it worthwhile; however, it's not an unbiased examination of the facts of the case. It's a one sided presentation that leans toward the defense, calling into question the evidence, reliability of witnesses, selection of the jury, fairness of the trial judge, prejudices of Supreme Court Justices for appeal, and the hysteria of the times.
The prosecution's case is given much less exposure. The film director even goes so far as to interview Roy Cohn, one of the prosecutors, with a portrait of Joe McCarthy in the background! Of course, this trail had nothing to do with McCarthy, but the fix is in as to the conclusion the viewer should come to.
This overt bias isn't inadvertent but deliberate. In light of the conclusive evidence against the Rosenbergs (as well as Alger Hiss) revealed in the 1990's, namely the Venona transcripts, KGB files, and FBI files, this film 's real value is as an example of the leftist media's denial of their complicity in covering for Red subversion, both at the time and for decades afterward.",1358467200,9,1182,4.827586206896552
7906956,4,B00000F6TZ,"The documentary is older, but the value lies in the wealth of original file footage that is shown all through the video. There are readings of trial transcripts by actors, and heavy emphasis is put in the right places for scholars and beginners wishing to have a basic knowledge of the trial and susequent deaths of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Actualy FBI case files and letters are offered as supporting evidence, and it is a well documented piece with a minimum of bias.",1019433600,9,472,4.698795180722891
