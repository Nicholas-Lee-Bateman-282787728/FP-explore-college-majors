7944892,5,B00005M2C8,"This is an incredibly sexy movie directed by Roger Vadim, set in the lust in the dust scenery of Southern Spain. This is my all-time favorite Brigitte Bardot movie. I like this film much more than God Created Woman.  I think Brigitte is more natural in this movie  and the animal that is Bardot is truly showcased. It is also a very impressive early movie for Stephen Boyd (of Ben Hur Messala fame). For a leading man to actually grab peoples attention in a Bardot movie was unheard of  but at the time, Stephens performance really stood out and gained him renown as having starred with the notorious starlet.  Stephen and Brigitte had some tension initially (he referred to her as a panther on the prowl and she pranked him on their first meeting but greeting him in the nude!), but they eventually became good friends (a friendship that would last all the way through the 1970s). They would even be linked (by the tabloids) several times, and ended up shooting a western Shalako in 1968 together.  A middle-aged Alida Valli is especially elegant as Bardots sexually repressed aunt. The plot is not really that important in this movie Vadims goal is to reveal the animal within Brigitte Bardot as it comes to blossom with her love (lust?) for the rugged, virile Boyd after he fails to win Vallis protection after accidentally killing her husband.  Bardot and Boyd go on the run in the wild mountains of Spain. Boyd eventually ends up running across the hills and fording rivers with a lovesick Bardot, a mule and a little cut pig in tow. Vadim works in some great Virgin imagery in this  Boyd and Bardot on the mule are like Joseph and Mary; a Virgin Mary statue is noticeable in the background when Bardot loses her virginity to Boyd in a beautifully filmed bedroom scene. Physically, Bardot and Boyd make a stunning pair to watch. He is truly a throwback male in the Gable mode, but with even more muscular power; and Bardot  of course!- becomes more and more Bardot as the movie goes on, and he wardrobe becomes smaller and more tattered.  The climax (of sorts) is a wild roll in the dust  over the little pig that Boyd is intent on having for supper (since the pair is now reducing to almost starvation) and Bardot is intent on defending. Bardot accuses Boyd of murder (since he did murder her uncle), and Boyd falters, and then proceeds to make love to Bardot. Vadim pushes the limit of Bardot wardrobe to the limit, and she eventually disrobes altogether. The end is a very melodramatic shoot-out with the police and the pair of lovers as Boyd is trying to do the right thing and deliver Bardot back to Aunt Valli. But tragedy strikes, and the police carelessly kill Bardot!  I think this is a beautiful film- very exploitative, but the colors and the people are absolutely gorgeous to behold. Enjoy!",1438819200,,2807,4.616465863453815

7944894,1,B00005M2C8,"Vadim is a crude writer and in this film an unbelievably clumsy and crude director. His idea of a subtle revelation of unspoken feelings is laughably seen in the funeral scene, where the cortege is implausibly stopped exactly where the widow can exchange glances with her wooer. She then is made to lift her veil (so the whole village can share?), exchange long looks with the man, while Vadim clubs us with a series of increasingly close close-ups of the eyes of the pair, each cut accompanied by a portentous stroke of the tolling funeral bell.",1406505600,,546,4.697916666666667
7944895,4,B00005M2C8,"Unlike some of Brigitte Bardot's films, this film has a recognizable plot.  She plays a young woman sent to live with her aunt and her aunt's husband in Spain.  The husband makes a pass at Bardot, but is turned down.  She prefers the young rebel in town played by Stephen Boyd.  They run away together after Boyd kills the aunt's husband.  The reason I bought this film is for Bardot's two or three nude scenes.  I didn't know nudity was allowed in 1958 when this film was made.  It's another Roger Vadim film.  I think Vadim and Bardot were married when they made it.",1376524800,2,568,4.394230769230769
7944896,4,B00005M2C8,"The Brigitte Bardot of the 1950s was just developing her sex kitten style, provocatively posing and walk-gliding, teasing with a minimum of nudity (half-exposed breasts and backside), showering - in a bikini! - and otherwise doing gratuitous things like pillow fighting and mock bullfighting.  She is lovely to watch, and Stephen Boyd is her sulky, smouldering lover who murdered her rich uncle, his former employer, and is now on the run with Bardot trailing along.  The story is similar to Godard's ""Breathless"" though not as good, a much better effort was ""Contempt"" which Bardot filmed for Godard in the early 60s.  Though the story is thin, the rocky Spanish countryside scenery is lovely, as was the young Bardot.",1337731200,3,719,5.076271186440678
7944897,3,B00005M2C8,"The movie is not as good as expected. Brigitte Bardot is lovely and beautiful. If you like Brigitte Bardot It is worth
to watch the movie though it is a 40 years old.",1278979200,,166,4.0606060606060606
7944898,3,B00005M2C8,"In 1956, Roger Vadim made a sensational debut as a motion picture director with 'And God Created Woman', a daringly erotic film that challenged conventional views of romanticism... Vadim presented the nude body of his young wife, Brigitte Bardot, in all the splendor of CinemaScope with beautiful Technicolor photography...

Along with Francois Truffaut, Louis Malle, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Demy and Agnes Varda, Vadim was one of the founding members of the revolutionary French New Wave, to push the sexual archetype...

His subsequent films revealed him to be an accomplished European filmmaker with an eye for visual beauty and decorative elegance, but in content, his films have often been superficial and lacking in narrative strength... Sexual relations have been a recurrent theme in his films, the plot of which have often revolved around the undisputed beauty of his succession of wives - Brigitte Bardot, Annette Stroyberg, and Jane Fonda...

""The Night Heaven Fell"" is the second collaboration between Vadim and Bardot... Vadim seems to have attempted to recapture the freshness and essence of the 'B.B.' he had helped to shape, but the re-creation escaped him, despite the careful choice of Albert Vidalie's novel and the casting of Stephen Boyd as leading man...

Bardot's innocently natural mannerisms had disappeared, and it seemed that she no longer needed Vadim to make use of her talents as an accomplished actress... Claude Autant-Lara succeeded much more with his film, 'Love Is My Profession,' playing Brigitte opposite Jean Gabin and Edwige Feuillere... Bardot came off as more than a sexual image, her persona giving life to the character she portrayed...

Filmed in Franco's Spain, ""The Night Heaven Fell"" is a sunburned film noir, beautifully photographed in Color and CinemaScope...

Bardot plays Ursula, a beautiful convent girl vacationing in a small village in rural Spain where her patient and passive Aunt Florentine and her rude uncle, the Count Ribera (Pepe Nieto), live... Upon her arrival, she's hunted by the handsome and forceful Lamberto (Stephen Boyd), who's looking to avenge the death of his poor sister...

The sexually repressed Florentine desires intensely Lamberto who kills her husband, seduces her, and escapes with her rebellious, capricious and highly provocative niece Ursula...

The air of harshness is at the heat of all of the main characters: Ursula's challenging sexuality; Count Ribera's lecherous advances; Lamberto's acts of vengeance; and most of all, the unusual beauty and natural charm of Florentine, played by the great Italian actress Alida Valli, from Carol Reed's The Third Man.

There's a scene in the film that takes place during the Count's funeral where we see Alida Valli stopping in the village streets and a veil covers her face... In front of Boyd, she takes off her dark veil, and stares, in silence, at his face... Her new feminist disposition was loading all her unconscious feelings...

In the fifties, Bardot emerged as a new type of sex symbol, flashing her sexual exuberance... Her performances as a child of nature responding to the call of sensuality, were a deliciously strange elixir to all of us growing up in that time...

Clothed in a breakaway towel, dcolletage, bathing suits, or nude, this truly luscious coquette was enough to drive us into a kaleidoscope of dynamic excitement...",1166400000,8,3374,5.264432029795159
7944899,2,B00005M2C8,"Although the scenery is memorable in this Bardot film (including the female scenery), the direction is awful. And there are a few embarrassing moments. The worst is a stage-bound windmill (a la Don Quijote) scene where the shadow of the sails falls regularly on the background painting of distant hills! In short, Roger Vadim is a hit and miss director. He misses with this one. I only give it 2 stars for BB, the obnoxious pig whose life she saves, and the donkey, who seems to know the cinematic mess he's got himself into.",1084838400,5,525,4.595744680851064
7944900,5,B00005M2C8,"This was a very interesting film. The dynamics between the main characters was very intriguing. While she may not have been the greatest actress of her time, Brigitte Bardot was good, and she is soooo beautiful. I found Bardot to be very expressive vs. the rather wooden Stephen Boyd. The scenery was beautiful, and the movie was a pleasure to watch. Highly recommend this for any Bardot fan.",1019433600,10,392,4.779411764705882
7944901,3,B00005M2C8,"While there is one raw sequence of frank sensuality between Bardot and Boyd, the impact of this film lies in its subtle underplayed performances--Alida Valli gives one of her best portrayals  as the  ambivalent rival aunt to Bardot in conquering Boyd... the stud of the  piece.. Only Vadim could have such a role reversal in  late 50's cinema!  Excellent scoreby Auric and sumptious location photography. Bravo!",963273600,11,411,5.166666666666667
