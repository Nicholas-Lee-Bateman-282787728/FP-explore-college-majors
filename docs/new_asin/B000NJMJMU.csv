8178419,4,B000NJMJMU,"This is a surprisingly good indie horror flick.  Shot on digital video in Vermont in the early 00's.  It surprised me with how decent it was.  Good atmosphere, some very creepy scenes and a decent amount of suspense.  The ending is pretty severely cheesy, but still, this is a solid indie effort.  Way better than you'd think.  Recommended for regional horror film fans.",1400457600,,370,4.7936507936507935
