7842853,5,6303293158,"My three-year-old son is currently into all things orange and all large cats. We checked this DVD out from our local library and he loved it so much that I ended up buying a copy. He loves the superb videos of the cats, especially the one of the tiger striding toward the camera at the beginning. I enjoyed it since it discusses everything from house cats to the large cats. I'd recommend this to any cat lover, whether he/she loves small cats or large cats.",1330992000,2,458,4.4
7842854,5,6303293158,"I bought this for my son when he was almost 4.  Now he's almost 7.  He still watches it and seems to really enjoy it.  I think the fact that we have 2 cats in our household helps.  He even occasionally quotes lines from it...maybe he's watched it TOO many times.  I've given it 5 stars because, considering the price and the number of times by son has watched it, I have DEFINITELY gotten my money's worth.

Overall, I have been very happy with the Eyewitness series.",1264723200,,467,4.310344827586207
7842855,5,6303293158,"This video covers all types of cats.  It tells you what makes them all similar, and what makes them different.  It provides loads of facts and enhances that content with excellent production value.  I always value a video I can watch with my children and we enjoy it together -- this fits the bill.",1098576000,,298,4.481481481481482
