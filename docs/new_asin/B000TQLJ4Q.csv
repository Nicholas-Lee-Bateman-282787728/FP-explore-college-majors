2907698,5,B000TQLJ4Q,These movies have become a family tradition for our family.  We know Christmas is getting close when we watch these three movies.  Tim Allen is great!,1230076800,,150,4.730769230769231
2907699,4,B000TQLJ4Q,All the dvd's are great but the cases are really thin. This isn't a big deal just not exactly what I had in mind. Otherwise....happy!,1229385600,,133,4.36
2907700,3,B000TQLJ4Q,"THE SANTA CLAUSE: 3 MOVIE COLLECTION is a three DVD box set that includes all three movies of the Santa Clause trilogy from Walt Disney Pictures.  The three movies included are:

THE SANTA CLAUSE-Scott Calvin is a divorced Dad. Much to his ex-wife's chagrin, his six-year old son still believes in Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, an unexpected visitor falls off of Scott's roof. All that remains of the visitor is a sleigh and eight reindeer on Scott's roof, a red and white furry coat, and instructions that if involved with the accident to put the coat on.  Scott does and soon finds himself zipping around the world delivering packages through chimneys. He eventually winds up at the North Pole and is informed by a group of elves that he's the new Santa. Scott believes the whole thing is a dream and goes about his regular life. But as the year progresses Scott's hair turns grey, he gains a ton of weight, and his face doesn't stay shaved. Scott has to either accept his new job or disappoint children around the world, including his own son. Special features include ""So You Wanna Be an Elf?""; Santa's Helper - a trivia adventure game; and ""Making Santa snacks with Wolfgang"".

THE SANTA CLAUSE 2: THE MRS. CLAUSE--Eight years have passed since Scott Calvin became the new Santa Claus and the elves at the North Pole think he's the best Santa ever.  But there's a problem. It turns out there's another clause to the agreement that Scott made years ago and Santa has to be married. Santa has a year to find a wife and get married. Otherwise the elves' favorite Santa will be gone with no memory of what has happened. Special features include deleted scenes; a gag reel; ""Operation Toy Box: Save Santa"" set-top game; and the making-of featurette ""Inside the North Pole With Curtis"".

THE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE--Things have been going smooth at the North Pole for over a decade. Santa has taken a prominent place at the Council of Mythical Leaders and has been a strong opponent to Jack Frost.  Frost doesn't like it and believes if he was Santa, the world would be a much better place. His cold heart leads him to discover one last clause to the Santa agreement. If he can get Santa to say a particular phrase he will be zipped back through time to the moment he became Santa and someone else can take his place. Frost plots his move carefully and Santa soon finds himself zipping through time and living as Scott Calvin in a miserable world that would make Mr. Potter from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE very, very happy. Special features include a blooper reel; alternate opening scene; ""On the Set with Tim and Marty""; Christmas carol-oke; and ""Greatest Time of Year"" music video with Aly and AJ.

THE SANTA CLAUSE is the best of the movies in the set and the films progressively decrease in story development and entertainment value through the series.

The only major complaint I have about the set is that the films are all in fullscreen with no widescreen option. I prefer watching movies on my regular television in the widesreen format.

Overall this is a nice holiday collection available at a reasonable price. THE SANTA CLAUSE is the only film of the three that might someday be referred to being a classic, but they're all decent movies that the entire family can watch together.",1227052800,34,3299,4.652920962199313
2907701,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"Everyone I know prefers FULL SCREEN, so I don't know where the handful of reviewers for this movie came from? I have not met one single person in real life who likes wide screen. Why would I pay to watch something that only takes up half my screen? If I want that, I'll go the movies. Maybe one reviewer here isn't buying this because it isn't wide screen but that is exactly why I DID buy it! This is a great series and I am thrilled to be able to watch it in my home on the ENTIRE television screen instead of half of it! Thank you for making my shopping easier! I just had to look elsewhere for a DVD copy of Christmas Vacation because you don't sell new ones in Full screen, so maybe the disappointed shoppers should purchase that movie instead! I was already let down once today by that so I am thrilled to be able to own these 3 classic movies on full screen. Thanks so much and please keep making movies on full screen! Also, thank you for selling all 3 of these together!",1226448000,2,979,4.157894736842105
2907702,4,B000TQLJ4Q,"The three Santa Clauses films were a cute franchise for the Disney company. Tim Allen was and still is a hot Disney Property. The first  film is a modern day Xmas classic. The other two films  were good, but didn't live up to the first films promise.

Disney has smartly gave the public a gift, wrapping all three films in one package. However this version is full screen and formatted to a TV set. Others have remarked that is a problem, I don't like  it..but many of my friends and family don't care if the film is the same as the cinematic focus. So I know what people are getting for xmas this year

So at the price of these films it is a good buy at the price and a great holiday gift

2907703,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"I LOVE this movie and am disappointed that others cannot just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is...a family movie to share with your kids and/or grandchildren. Every year after Thanksgiving when we come back from vacation we put the movies in and put up our tree and decorations. It has become a HUGE family tradition with us and it would not be Christmas with out it. I am thrilled they put it in a set and cannot wait to purchase it for one and two share it with my own family, I think this is our generations Miracle on 34th street like someone else said and am glad to have it to share.",1222387200,5,600,4.136752136752137
2907704,1,B000TQLJ4Q,"Wow, wish they had made this WIDESCREEN, then I would have bought it. If they ever do, I might by it as I don't have any of these on DVD yet! Until then I guess I will just have to figure on buying the individually when I finally get around to it.",1222214400,18,247,3.769230769230769
2907705,4,B000TQLJ4Q,"These movies are great for everyone in the family. I love that there is nothing remotely offensive for children's viewing. Many movies these days sneak in stuff you wouldn't want young children exposed to. The storylines to all three are very imaginative and each one is clearly linked to the previous one. Only bummer is that it will be released in full screen and not wide screen, considering how many people have gone to wide screen tvs.",1221350400,2,440,4.7272727272727275
2907706,1,B000TQLJ4Q,"I've been waiting for them to get smart and put out a three disc set of the three Santa Clause films, since I don't have any on DVD yet.  I agree with most critics in thinking that the first is the best (in fact, I think it's our generation's ""Miracle on 34th Street""), the second not as good and the third not as good as the second.  I still like some aspects of the third film though, especially the whole ""It's a Wonderful Life"" aspect of what would have been different if he had never become Santa.

So what do they do?  They put out the trilogy in a reasonably priced set, and they only make it available in full screen!!!!  I think that DVD sales have shown that most fans want the films in widescreen, so this is ridiculous.  I've got to believe that the only reason they're doing it is because they still have a huge inventory of unsold full screen copies, so they're hoping that releasing it this way will move some of them.  Well, I didn't buy them in full screen when you put out the first two as a set that way, and I won't buy them now.  I guess I'll keep waiting for them to put out the set I want.",1219881600,98,1112,4.092165898617512

2907717,5,B000TQLJ4Q,Have loved these movies for years and watch them every year but our DVD version were having issues. Probably wore them out so we upgraded them to BluRay. I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite of the 3 because they are all well done. I'd like to see them do another one with their child grown up but sometimes pushing a franchise can ruin it.

On the other end of the Sister Spectrum, I cringe at just the thought of these ridiculous, goofball movies.

2907839,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"WARNING!!! There's a high probability that you will receive something different than the item being displayed on the Amazon website. I ordered The Santa Clause 3-Movie Collection on Blu-ray, which is a box set, not the 3 individual movies, which is what Surplus DVD Source is sending to their customers. Yeah, it's essentially the same thing, however I wanted the box set in a pretty compact packaging. If you want what's pictured, spend a few extra $$ at wally world, they have it. You've been warned...

I grew up having to watch Miracle on 34th Street and It's A Wonderful Life multiple times during the holiday season, because those were my mothers FAVORITE Christmas movies. She'd always have tears of joy at the end, which I thought funny as a kid. Now that I'm an adult these Santa Clause movies are my favorites and I ""get"" the tears of joy those movies brought to my mother (M.H.S.R.I.P.).

As for the difference in quality between the DVD & BR, there's a noticeable difference in picture and sound, just not a spectacular difference. Is the cost difference worth it, certainly, IMO.",1481241600,,1092,4.772486772486772

2907852,4,B000TQLJ4Q,I thought this would be a box set of some type as the photo indicates. I thought maybe it would have a little book or something extra because it is a special box set to celebrate all three movies. It actually three separate movies that are shrink wrapped together. So you could go buy the three blu rays individually and get the exact same product. It is fine. I just expected more of a collectable box set than the three movies shrink wrapped together.,1480982400,,453,4.404761904761905
2907853,2,B000TQLJ4Q,The picture shows that this is the box set but the Bluray movies I received were each individual movie. Also these don't appear to have been digitally remastered in anyway. The quality of picture is not that of a Bluray. They work and seem to play fine but I'm not overly thrilled with this transaction. I feel like it was a bit of a trick.,1480982400,,340,4.246153846153846

I thought I was getting a ""BOX SET"" as it was advertised, with a ""BLIZZARD OF BONUS FEATURES"", nor is it an actual ""collection"", as it was stated in the picture.  I received all three movies wrapped in cellophane together, but there's no special BOX to make it an actual ""box set"", and they are just regular Blu-Ray movies like you'd buy in a store.  There are not that many bonus features, and nothing special about the movies whatsoever.  I'm happy to have the movies now, but it isn't the beautiful packaging as shown and it isn't anything more than what you'd buy if you got them individually at WalMart.  Shame on you freaking people for advertising something you don't actually provide.  There is nothing special about these movies.  I gave it two stars because I love the movies, but come on now.

I am a mall Santa and I bought this for reference.  Many kids have seen it and ask questions about Bernard and Judy.  I wanted to be familiar with this alternative take on Santa, so I can answer the children's questions.
Although dated, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" is a far superior movie in my opinion and tackles the question of the existence of Santa Claus in a more thoughtful way.",1473984000,,503,4.329787234042553

2908252,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"Review of: The Santa Clause: 3 Movie Collection.

Tim Allen portrays Santa in these three Santa Clause films which, by the way, have proven to be a financial windfall for Disney.  The first movie, The Santa Clause, has become a Holiday classic and set the modern tone.  The Santa Clause 2 & 3 are good but require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief (which says a lot concerning the entire storyline).  This package of three discs are full screen versions which are formatted for TV.  The price is fair and are a great purchase for Christmas.  Well done.  It is nice to have all three in one box.  Five stars.",1439164800,,617,4.495495495495495

2908254,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"Great price for all 3 movies.  I tried to buy just the first one and I saw this set for a few dollars extra and I am so glad I did.  My son loves all 3 of these movies, he likes to watch them all year, not just at Christmas time.  There are extra scenes and deleted scenes.  Personally, I think the 1st one is way better than the other 2, but my son seems to like them all equally.  The boxed set has each DVD wrapped individually, it is not one of those sets that has a flimsy holder for each DVD all in one case, there are 3 standard DVD cases for the 3 movies and they all fit into the boxed set.",1437868800,5,599,3.76

2908591,4,B000TQLJ4Q,I bought this Blu-ray collection thinking that it would be in 16.9 format wrong. It is my fault for not researching it better. To bad it would have been nice. I don't get it; why would someone make a Blu-ray and not put it in a wide format. And also when it was recorded the sound is very low. To hear the sound the volume needs to be around 45-50 or better to hear the voices; and then when something dramatic happens in the show the sound is blaring. So you will need to hold on to the remote. I kind a wish I would've never bought the DVDs. Too much of a hassle. And then hearing people yell turn down the TV and your killing yourself trying to find the remote. I was happy I bought the DVDs. but then I got them. Kind a sucks.,1417132800,,730,3.9727891156462585

2908621,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"After ordering this set, I began to have reservations due to the complaints about the description and format of viewing the movies. I am watching The Santa Clause right now! I'm so happy!!! Not only did the set arrive in two days, the package was carefully wrapped. The original cello wrap around the entire set. Then, each disc in it's original package, were also cello wrapped. There are extra scenes, deleted scenes and other extras on each of the discs.

I don't know why some had problems with the picture not filling up their widescreen tv's. Written in very small print, on the outside box and each of the plastic cases it says to be played on a Blu-ray 1080p format. Perhaps their tv's aren't set to the right format. I hope this helps some of the people who are having trouble with the movies. Maybe they can adjust the zoom or picture size on their tv's if their widescreen aren't 1080p. If I should have any problems with the rest of the discs, I'll update this review. A+ seller and set!",1406160000,44,999,4.489010989010989

2908642,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"The original ""Santa Clause"" is one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time. It's up there with ""It's a Wonder Life"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"", and ""A Christmas Story"". Now that it is on Blu-Ray makes it even better. I was so excited when I ordered this before last Christmas. My previous copy was an old DVD version and the quality was not very good.

""Santa Clause 2"" is pretty good, but it's not as good as the first one. The adventure that Scott Calvin has to go through in order to get a wife is great. The problems that the North Pole has with the alternate Santa is not very good. The special effects and the set for the North Pole do not look like top tier quality coming from Disney. I think they could have left that part out. The Blu-Ray still looks good. The colors are very vivid and the picture is very clear.

I watched ""Santa Clause 3"" when it first came out and I won't watch it again. The case is still in the wrapper from this box set, and it will probably stay that way.",1392681600,,994,4.171875

2908644,2,B000TQLJ4Q,"I can not say there is a big picture quality upgrade from the DVD as the picture looks better than your local tv station that shows Taxi reruns but worse than typical NetFlix streaming. The extras are scant and the packaging is rather huge for simple three disc set. Also, the lack of digital copy deducted another star. It would have been nice to have digital copies on this catalogue release for the option of portability or salability (depending on your desire).",1391904000,,465,4.682926829268292

I couldn't wait to watch my favorite Chrismas movie series, and of course none of the movies were able to play in any of my DVD players, my blu-ray player, my PS2, my XBOX, or in my computer. Nothing was able to read the disk since it was formatted to only watch on devices made in the UK. And I find it very funny that Amazon keeps asking me only to review this purchase, which is the only one that I was disappointed in.

2908741,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"You know it occurred to me while watching the first movie again on blu ray that they actually killed off santa claus. I've never heard of anyone else doing that. Granted they did so in a way that was hilarious but not as traumatic as you might think for kids. But, they did need to set the stage for tim allen to take over. I won't go into details of the movies as most people know it and the others should experience it for the first time on blu ray without having me inflluence them. The first two are great, and the third is good, way better than it was said to be at the time. The only thing I thought they could have fixed is there is a plot development that puts the hero out in the cold, but it is resolved way too quickly (Martin Short is rather grating at times, I am not a big fan, but Jack Frost is supposed to make you hate him, so that works in his favor). I think they should have made it longer and maybe make it more of a struggle, maybe get allen's character to realise just what he had, and see just how much the children loved him. I think it would have benefited the movie to have taken it's time and worked longer on reaching the turning point. But overall these are great movies. and should be watched over and over. Looks great on blu ray. I highly recommend.",1361145600,2,1282,4.091269841269841

Still, it is a treat to have all three ""Santa Clause"" films and for the sale price of $19.99, it's a great deal. (The price has gone up since then.) Tim Allen is a riot as Scott Calvin AKA Santa Claus. Although 2 and 3 are enjoyable, my favorite is still the original ""Santa Clause.""

They are well made and bring in that holiday cheer! Merry Christmas!",1357257600,,603,4.129310344827586

2908869,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"The Santa Clause movies are some of the best Christmas movies.  Well, not the third one as much, but the first two are great.  I remember seeing the first with my dad and brother.  Good memories.  The movies are about a man who is going through a hard time.  Him and his wife are no longer together and he has a hard time figuring out how to act around his son.  Well, It's Christmas and the son is staying with him.  Something happens that changes the mans as well as the sons life.  It is a movie you will always remember.  I could have went into more detail, but I do not want to ruin it for anyone.  This is a great movie for the entire family to watch.  You can watch it again and again.

I can not give to much away, as I said I do not want to give to much away.  But the second movie is about the man getting used to his new responsibility.  Not just him, but those who are part of his life.  Also, The man has had his job for about 10 years now.  But there is something that he needs or he may not be able to keep the job.  Do I hear bells?

The third movie....  well, the man has someone trying to take his job.  This movie did not seem to fit with the others at all.  It just went a little to far with some of the stuff.  But, if you have seen the first two, you minds well watch the last.  Kids will like the third one.

Here are the special features for each movie.  I got this from another site.  So it is accurate as far as I know.  If anyone knows of anything that is different, you could put a response in to let me and anyone else know.

You save money by getting this set.  The blu rays by themselves are about $14.00 which makes all three come out to around 42.00.  So, you can get the collection (at least right now) for $34.99.  Save yourself some money and get the set!!!!",1343347200,5,2679,4.292

Meanwhile he has to keep his son out of trrouble. In the third and final one Jack Frost tricks him into wishing hed never become Santa Claus. Meanwhile his wife is pregnant. Theese are good movies.

2908919,4,B000TQLJ4Q,"These truly are some great movies.  The first one has become an annual tradition for me.

Our series stars Tim Allen as Scott Calvin, a divorced dad who doesn't have a good relationship with his son.  In the first movie, a Christmas Eve accident finds Santa dead on Scott's front lawn.  When he puts on Santa's suit to appease Charlie (Eric Lloyd), he finds himself under the Santa clause.  No matter what Scott wants, he is going to become the next Santa.  This is by far the best in the series with lots of spot on laughs.

But the time the second movie rolls around, Scott has grown to love his new identity.  So when he comes under the Mrs. Clause, he scrambles to find a wife by Christmas Eve so he can keep being Santa.  Yep, we've got another Christmas romantic comedy.  But it works quite well and is enjoyable.

The third movie finds Santa dealing with a disruptive Jack Frost (Martin Short) who wants a holiday of his own.  While he deals with his in-laws and other visiting family, his wife is about ready to have a baby.  Will that be enough to make him trigger the Escape Clause?  This one is more silly and slapstick.  I enjoyed it more on the first viewing.  Again, it doesn't hold up to the original, but it is still fun in its own right.

This set contains no new extras.  You get the three individual releases in a box, so if you already have one or more of the films, there's no reason to get this one.  Additionally, if you prefer widescreen movies, you'll want to skip this set since these are the full screen releases.  However, if you don't have these films, this might be your best way to get them.

Granted, all three movies are fairly predictable.  But they also offer great Christmas laughs.  I know I'll be enjoying them for a long time to come.",1259280000,2,1773,4.3547400611620795
2908920,5,B000TQLJ4Q,THis is one of our daughter's all time favorites.  We watch it as a family every year!!,1259280000,,87,4.117647058823529

2908935,5,B000TQLJ4Q,"We bought these movies because they are simply some of the best!  Thank you, Tim Allen, for making our lives happier!  Also, we like the fact that they are in no way offensive, they are funny, they have suspense, comedy, joy and capture the wonder of children and Christmas!  We will look forward to watching them every year!  As for the format, we LIKE full-screen!  We have 4 older tv's that will last a long time yet and we will watch a wide-screen movie, IF, we have too.  BUT, we bought this set because it WAS full-screen.  Almost everyone WE KNOW, has older tv's, too.  I guess anamorphic might be a solution???  Or full-screen on one side, wide-screen on the other.  But, we are happy with this set and would buy again!  Good price, too!",1231718400,,745,4.444444444444445

2908942,1,B000TQLJ4Q,"Like any fan of Christmas Movies these 3 are a great interpretation of the Santa Claus Tale. I love these movies they are funny and get you in the Christmas Spirit!

However, This ""Holiday Complete Collection"" as they claim to call it leaves a lot to be desired; Like the WIDESCREEN VERSIONS OF THE MOVIES!! Any true Cinema fan knows that Widescreen is the only way to watch movies, you see the director's whole vision, not just what will fit in the screen, and particularly with the Sweep of Flat Widescreen TVs over the OLD CRT TVs, you would think that a WIDESCREEN collection would be a no-brainer for a commercial money giant like Disney.
I agree with the another AMAZON reviewer who said it's like they repackaged the UNSOLD FULLSCREEN DVDs to CON you into buying them in this set.
Don't waste your time or money, you might as well buy the Widescreen versions individually, and save yourself a disappointing headache and get what you really want!
Love Tim Allen, Love the Movies, currently MAD at Disney!",1230508800,13,1010,4.674157303370786

I am glad that I was able to get this group of movies in one package and at a great Price. I would recommend this to any one as a family-friendly movie for the entire family.
