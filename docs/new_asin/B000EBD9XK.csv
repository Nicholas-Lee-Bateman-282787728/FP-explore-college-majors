8601639,5,B000EBD9XK,"A stellar documentary about hope and belief.. ""if you build it they will come"" never was more true than in this case... the makers of this film have captured the essence of our youth and the outlet they have found on the blacktop and the importance of team man-ship. With The support of what seems like all of Bedford Stuyvesant, the makers of he film put their very soul into presenting the ""Kevin Bushnell"" classic every summer.  With NBA stars such as Stephon Marbury, Rafael""skip to my lou"" Alston and a babyface Jamal Tinsley amongst the alumni this is one tournament that has had impacts on all that have participated, from both current and from the past... This being done with the support from the community and themselves, there are no big time sponsors of the tournament, no coverage in the major newspapers, nothing of the sort... just heart and soul and desire to take care of our children and give them something to be proud of... this film gives you hope and makes you smile as you watch... and the soundtrack captures the essence of the children and the game... a definite pickup...",1141603200,,1097,4.654639175257732
8601640,4,B000EBD9XK,"Gritty and gutsy, a penetrating inside look that on the surface introduces you to a remarkable 12 and under summer basketball league in Brooklyn New York, but also digs deeper to identify and explore the support system making this league and the children who participate in it grow as players and people year after year. A true look at what the phrase 'it takes a village to raise of child' really means. Including great archival footage of current NBA stars like Stephon Marbury and Jamal Tinsley. This is a must for any fan of youth sports, sociology, the conditions of our urban homes, and more importantly hope.",1140998400,,615,4.757009345794392
8601641,5,B000EBD9XK,"It should really be sub titled....

""A Film About Basketball and Life"".

What you have here is a group of Black men engaged in doing something that Black men aren't supposed to be interested in doing. That is caring enough about the future to spend their ""free time"" working with younger people, providing them with direction and fun at the same time.

This movie takes place in Brooklyn's financially impoverished, heart of gold Bed-Sty neighborhood. It's the story of how a summer basketball program has sustained itself and become a community institution, not only for the basketball players it has produced, but also for the type of young people who emerge from it.

An excellent movie especially for those who are cynical about today's younger people.",1140998400,3,756,4.976190476190476
8601642,5,B000EBD9XK,"This brillant film comes at the right time for many different reasons. Mainly because of the amount of bad influences and stories we hear about inner city youths, here is one of triumph despite adversity with leadership coming from within the community. Not since ""Hoop Dreams"" has there been such a remarkable documentry. And even though most of these young warriors won't be successful in the NBA, I'm certain that because of the guidence this organization has given them they will be able to find success in life.",1140912000,,516,4.875
