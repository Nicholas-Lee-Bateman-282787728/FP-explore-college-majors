2920146,5,B000UAE7DQ,"Growing up I watched a ton of Cop shows on TV.S.W.A.T.,Baretta,The Streets of San Francisco,The Rookies,Starsky & Hutch,McMillan and Wife and My Favorite: Columbo. Luckily these series have begun to make their way to DVD.On Dec. 18,07 comes the 1st Season (Vol. 1....Don't You hate when the season is broken into volumes !!??!!?? I hate it !)of The Mod Squad.
During the late '60's-early '70's I never watched Ironside. I don't know why. About 3 years ago I came across repeats of Ironside on a local Albany,NY station. It aired early Sat. and Sun. mornings at 3am. I watched one episode and was hooked. Every Sat. & Sun. am there I was watching Ironside. Then after about 5 to 6 weeks after discovering this gem.the station replaced Ironside with Perry Mason episodes. Soon afterward I learned of the upcoming DVD release of Season 1.
With Raymond Burr in the lead role of Chief Robert Ironside. The series brings great expectations after His Film career & many, many years as Perry Mason. His relatively unknown co-stars,Don Galloway,Barbara Anderson and Don Mitchell played off well against the veteran,Burr.
Taking on the topical issues of the day,racism,abortion & the growing drug culture, Season 2 is a strong follow up to the 1st. The 2nd Season attracted a lot of great TV & Film Actors,Joseph Cotton,Burgess Meredith & Bill Bixby among them. A couple of standout episodes are A Matter of Love and Death,where Eve goes undercover to find an Abortionist responsible for a young Girl's death, and I the People, guest starring Milton Berle,who even wrote the episode. It was way ahead of it's time with Berle as a talk show host (much like Morton Downey Jr.)who angers a viewer enough to want to kill Him.
The Tormentor,with Gary Collins,about a Blackmailer & Not With a Whimper But a Bang,with Ed Asner,about a Bomber with a grudge against a College newspaper are other standout episodes.
If you're looking for a great example of TV circa 1968-69. Try Ironside. The well written plots & the banter between Ironside & His Associates make it well worth viewing.",1195948800,6,2066,4.872159090909091

2920148,5,B000UAE7DQ,"The wheelchair-bound San Francisco Chief Robert T. Ironside, paralyzed by a would-be assassin's bullet, is back for another season of exciting and thought-provoking episodes in this award winning Classic TV Detective series. Second season episodes, from 1968, continues the high quality writing and acting that was the hallmark of this show through its five year run. Stories run the gamut from racial strife, fortune telling to the shooting of one of Ironside's team members!

""Ironside"" was one of the best detective shows of the 1960s and remains a classic of its genre. Memorable characters, brilliant acting, well-crafted stories and unforgettable theme music written by the legendary Quincy Jones, ""Ironside"" brought the beloved actor Raymond Burr back to series TV after a nine year Hall of Fame portrayal of the most famous lawyer in TV history: Perry Mason. The series was created by Collier Young. The decision to make Burr disabled was remarkable for the era, as few TV leads were ever depicted as anything but able bodied and still are not.

Determined not to be trapped in his wheelchair or give up his career, Ironside volunteers to work within the police department as a ""special department consultant."" Ironside drafts two young law enforcement officers, Detective Sgt. Ed Brown, portrayed by Don Galloway, and Officer Eve Whitfield, portrayed by Barbara Anderson. He also hired delinquent-turned-bodyguard Mark Sanger, portrayed by Don Mitchell, as his ""legs."" During the series, Sanger, an African-American with a chip on his shoulder and a hatred for the police, eventually went to law school and became an attorney. Ironside's consultant status was granted by Commissioner Dennis Randall, portrayed by Gene Lyons, who also frequently clashed with his long-time friend over Ironside's investigative methods and his willingness to break the rules to achieve true justice.

Whitfield, who was hugely popular, left the series in 1971. Elizabeth Baur joined the cast as Officer Fran Belding and remained until the series ended in 1975, but never found the fan base that Whitfield had enjoyed.

All 26 episodes remastered for DVD from the second season are included:

""Shell Game,"" pits a notorious jewel thief against Ironside; ""Split Second to an Epitaph Part 1"" and ""Part II,"" Ironside is the only witness to a murder, but has to go into hospital for exploratory surgery.

2920149,5,B000UAE7DQ,"This is a show I always watched as a kid in the sixties.  When the first season came out on dvd, I was prepared for disappointment, was I misremembering how good it was.  It was better than I recalled.  The only thing that dates this show are hair and clothing styles.  The plots are every bit as good now as then.  The ensemble of actors gathered here make these characters their own.  Leading the way is Raymond Burr.  Just when you thought he might be typecast as Perry Mason, he is Chief Ironsides.  Expect a nicely wound plot with a twist or two along the way.  This is great entertainment.",1187481600,7,595,4.336363636363636
2920150,5,B000UAE7DQ,"Thank you ShoutFactory!  I made sure I bought SEASON 1 for myself and also for my father-in-law.  Everybody who loves IRONSIDE should be sure to buy it for themselves and to give it to anybody they think might like it so they'll keep putting out the season sets!

For some reason, IRONSIDE wasn't syndicated much in my area (Oklahoma City) since it's original run from 1967-1975.  I'd caught maybe two episodes on TV (in Texas) since the original airing by NBC, at least before Columbia House put out 20 episodes in 1999.  I was pretty sure all along that I liked Raymond Burr in IRONSIDE even better than I liked him in PERRY MASON, and I do.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's great in both shows, but I just like the in-your-face attitude of Robert T. the best!  And, on both shows, the supporting cast is superb!

Therefore, run and Shout(Factory) to order as many copies of SEASON 2 of IRONSIDE as you can!",1185494400,6,907,4.454545454545454

2920159,5,B000UAE7DQ,"I love Perry Mason, but the nature of the role and the show limited the ability of the producers and the actor to develop the Perry Mason character.  Not so with Ironside.  Although nothing can compare to the Perry Mason series, Burr's acting abilities are center stage in Ironside - a character with a real backstory and life outside the office.  If only Della could have met Ironside -- she would have been a happy girl!",1417737600,,422,4.526315789473684
2920160,5,B000UAE7DQ,"Raymond Burr managed to find a second vehicle for his considerable talent when he took on the role of wheelchair-bound detective Robert Ironside.  This show is intense, cutting edge for its time (the mid-1960s), and includes off-beat stories, characters, and even musical performances.  The supporting cast is terrific and diverse (a black man who lives with Ironside and a female detective).  I love this show, and I hope eventually all four seasons will be available.",1410998400,2,469,5.226666666666667

2920175,5,B000UAE7DQ,"I'm glad to see all the positive reviews, however I guess Amazon did not sell enough of Seasons 1 and 2 of Ironside, so the 3rd season is now only available through the Shout! Factory.  This was such a great TV show ... I remember watching it with my dad all the time. I wished I could work for Robert T. Ironside and live in his cool digs. It's a slice of American history in the late sixties and early seventies with cool cars, realistic San Francisco scenery, great style (Eve's outfits), and relevant story lines.  For music buffs, this is another of Quincy Jones' distinctive style that a person recognizes from the first few notes. We want more seasons to be available!!",1264982400,4,676,4.487804878048781

Ironside, Hart to Hart, Barnaby Jones, The FBI!!Ironside and Hart to Hart only have 2 seasons out and the other two shows have yet to be released. I continually see a lot of junky TV released quickly on DVD that most people didn't enjoy when it was originally shown. I can understand some of the better shows like NCIS but they are not even off the air yet. Why don't they put out shows that we haven't seen for a long time? No logic in their thinking, I guess. They better get them out while we older fans are still around to enjoy them!!",1251676800,5,600,4.136752136752137
2920177,4,B000UAE7DQ,"Ex-Chief of Detectives Robert T. Ironside, is wheelchair bound after surviving an attempted assassination.  He now serves as a special consultant to the San Francisco police department.  His staff consists of detective sergeant Ed Brown (Don Galloway), officer Eve Whitfield (Barbara Anderson) and personal aide Mark Sanger (Don Mitchell).

The Ironside team is like a family unit.  It couldn't exist today, and perhaps not even then, but it is the package viewers are asked to buy.  A group seldom acts and reacts as quickly as an individual, and the stories often have a deliberate pace, with Ed and Eve handling most of the legwork.  The Chief can move quickly in a crisis, but it's not how he normally operates.  Ironside has more of a thinking man's approach, looking for leads to a trail, and then following through with dogged determination.  There usually aren't a myriad of suspects to consider, and the focus is often on the episode's one or two main guest stars.

The writers did a good job in the first season of establishing and building up the Ironside mystique, while also including intriguing episodes that featured the staff in some personal crisis, such as when Eve kills for the first time in the line of duty, or when Mark's date turns up dead of an overdose in a public bathroom.  Ironside himself falls in love with an amnesia victim.  With a colorful palate already established, the bar was set pretty high for season two.  And the writers respond with a nice variety of stories, blending pure crime episodes, with those with a personal angle, or off beat slant.

Among the notable is `Desperate Encounter' where The Chief and Mark stumble into a dangerous situation in a small town, and Ironside demonstrates that although in a wheelchair, he is not to be underestimated.  At the time, the special relationship between Mark and The Chief was making a significant statement about race relations.  And it is explored further in `Robert Phillips vs. The Man' where Ironside must clear an Afro-American leader (Paul Winfield) of a murder charge.  Here, Mark comes full circle.  At one time he was the one looking at Ironside with distrust and scorn, now he defends him.

'Reprise' is quite an interesting retrospective, as when Eve is shot, the story of how the society girl became a policewoman is revealed.  There's intrigue on the bomb squad in 'Not With a Whimper, But With a Bang', where the police are called to handle a series of bomb threats.  Funnyman Milton Berle goes way over the top as a provocative talk show host in 'I, The People'.

Some of the best stories concern those with personal ties to Ironside.  In 'An Obvious Case of Guilt', Anne Baxter plays an old flame whose husband has disappeared, and Ironside is determined to solve the case no matter what.  Perhaps the best episode of season two is 'Puzzlelock', which features the format that would make Columbo a television classic.  Simon Oakland plays a friend of The Chief, who executes an intricately planned murder, and then uses Ironside as his alibi.

With a little less focus on the staff's personal lives, the tenor and type of the stories in season two, continues much in the mold set in the first season.  There are a few missteps, and some episodes seem to end abruptly, but overall Season Two is quite solid.  Image quality of the 26 episodes is very good, but unfortunately like Season One, there are no extras.",1250553600,5,3416,4.794871794871795
2920178,5,B000UAE7DQ,"I am so happy that Ironside is coming out in good quality dvd's.  I now have seasons 1 and 2.  Raymond Burr has always been one of my favorite actors.  The Perry Mason series has also been a favorite of mine.

2920179,5,B000UAE7DQ,"I read a review somewhere that tells that the second season of ""Ironside"" was weak. I wholeheartedly disagree. Mind you it started off with ""Shell Game"" which was the weakest of all the second season. It makes up with the 2 part episode ""Split Second To an Epitath"", also ""Desparate Encounter"" which is downright intense, ""I The People"" is a terrific showcase which showcases Milton Berle in a drama, and he proves he can straddle comedy, and drama, and also can write a really good script, ""Why The Tuesday Afternoon Bridge Club Met on Thursday"" is a bit hokey with a bunch of elderly ladies helping Ironside, but creating a story line where the Dr. Crippen murder from 1910 was a stroke of genius, ""Obvious Case of Guilt"" is a mindbender where you don't know what's going to happen next, ""A Drug On The Market"" is probably the most intense episode on this collection I know that when I heard the voices I was a bit spooked, and finally on Disc 7 It ends with ""Not With a Whimper, but With a Bang"". I am now going to look over Season 1, and can't wait for Season 3 to come out on dvd.",1203379200,6,1085,4.349753694581281

I bought Season One on DVD last year and it was just - ok - at best. It was very dated and not written very well as the show was just finding it's way. I debated getting season Two, but I did and VERY GLAD I did. Season Two is MUCH better than Season One. Still a little dated but better written and much closer to the show I remember watching in the late 60's and early 70's. And even then I knew I was hearing one of the FINEST TV music scores of all time from the late, great Oliver Nelson. (I wish they would put out a CD collection of Oliver Nelson's TV score work from Ironside, Six Million Dollar Man, Longstreet, etc, it is much different than his jazz CDs. Look him up.)
