2678431,5,B000JRYOME,"The title of my review is one of the first lines of this film and it sets the tone for an exploration of contrasts and growths within a nation incomparable in the world.  The ""Discovery Atlas"" series are celebrations of nations and cultures.  As a celebration, the series is more hopeful than critical.  The (brief) stories of each nation are interwoven with the individual people the documentary crew follows.  Another documentary was produced recently by Discovery Times called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Rises-The-Oldest-Civilization-on-Earth-Reborn-4-Episodes-on-2-DVDs/dp/B000J2KVK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Rises - The Oldest Civilization on Earth, Reborn (4 Episodes on 2 DVDs)</a>, it is available on DVD now and is almost twice as long, but the production value is much lower (an example would be the difference in soundtracks: This Atlas edition of China has a soaring, busy, and at times, ancient, musical score while the ""China Rises"" documentary pales in comparison).

What follows in this review are statistics and quotations taken directly from the film (I wrote them down while watching and pausing the video).....

It is now predicted that the Chinese economy will be the largest in the world in little more than 20 years.  China has 1/5 of the world's population and now consumes almost 1/3 of the world's steel and almost 1/2 of its concrete. In any single minute the Chinese nation now burns almost 2,500 thousands pounds of coal, 24,000,000 watts of electricity  and 200,010 gallons of crude oil. It has been estimated that in 30 years we will need another planet earth to satisfy China's ever growing appetite for raw materials.  But for all this explosion of industry, China still rests on traditions that are thousands of years old, like the patty fields on terraces in Long Shen. One terrace worker said, ""We get up at 6...we don't come back home until 8 or 8:30."" These terraces are known as the ""Dragon's Back.""  For all of its vast area, less than 10% of China can be farmed.  One worker remembers the terrible famine of 1959.  Until 1978, the Communist Party directly controlled all of China's land, but then the announced an extraordinary change in policy: hand the land over to the peasants to run themselves.  The average peasant income rocketed by more than 15,000 %.
The Communist Party has announced to businesses in the city, ""To get rich is glorious.""  10s of millions have abandoned farming life for city dwelling.  Already 8-times the size of New York City, Shanghi is expanding every day: investors are pouring more than 10,000,000 dollars a year into the city.
China covers over 3 million miles of land and there are over 50 different peoples.  The people of Inner Mongolia still hold on to their traditions.  China is a nation so diverse, its people speak 7 different languages and over 80 dialects.  There is just one bond between them all: the Chinese calligraphy.  Kung Fu (Wushu) is a Chinese contribution to the Martial Arts.
The most populace nation on earth, China has 1.3 billion people nearly double the population of all of Europe and America combined.  Every minute another 34 Chinese children are born, every year the population grows another 7 years.  In 1979 they instituted a one-child-policy; this policy has recently been relaxed but nothing without an entire generation of only-child families.
In one of Beijing's largest restaurants, 100 chefs cook the evening meal.
In 1966, Mao stood on the balcony of the Forbidden City and declared the Cultural Revolution.  Beijing's bow makers were a target of Mao's desire to destroy many of the traditions of China.  After 2 decades, the bow makers are back at their craft.
The Great Wall of China is a testament to the power of old China.  600 years ago the Ming Dynasty decided to close off the northern boarder of China: 4,000 miles.  A million laborers were put to work; they build a wall wide enough for 5 horses to ride alongside each other on the wall.  With 1,000 garrison towers over 100,000 troops.  Now, China is building again with similar ambitions.  There are more construction projects going on in China then in anywhere else in the world.  There is a new middle class in China.  12 million new faces join China's job market every year.  Drugs are problem for modern China, heroine especially.  There are over 750,000 Chinese on enforced government detox programs.  Overall, it is estimated that there are between 7 and 10 million addicts: a 10 fold increase in just 5 years.  One taxi driver is shown on the documentary to be in possession of drugs, he was smuggling them across a boarder; he later faced the death penalty for drug smuggling.",1171670400,17,4722,5.050322580645162
2678432,5,B000JRYOME,"This is a visual splendor to behold.  Anyone who has watched the Discovery HD Channel will understand what I mean.  This is even better that on Direct TV.  There is absolutely NO macro blocking and other artifacts you occasionally see with a satellite HD feed. This is an awesome DVD both visually, and sonically.  The theme, places visited, and material covered is very appropriate for a documentary of this nature.  GO BUY IT NOW and show it to your sophisticated friends they will enjoy it!

This isn't material to impress a 16 year old male who plays video games all day!",1171152000,6,575,4.643564356435643
2678433,4,B000JRYOME,"A beautiful documentary and one that I had to have on DVD after I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

It gives you a little background, but in the majority of the 100 minutes you follow several people such as a young gymanst, a window washer in Shanghai hoping to find fortune, a family who still works in the rice fields, a young martial artist, a policewoman in the Gansu province, and several others.

You are able to follow them and understand their way of life in this fascinating country. It is interesting and yet almost sad at how technology and the future is hurting some of the ancient traditions and ways of life in China.

My only complaint is that in the middle of the documentary, it gets a little slow, and I would have preferred to hear more about the actual country, but it's still a fabulous documentary.

The narration is great, music is beautiful, the design and feel of the documentary is fantastic. All in all, I loved it and enjoy watching it very much.",1169942400,21,974,4.455056179775281
2678434,3,B000JRYOME,"This 100-minute documentary, narrated by James Spader (who plays Alan Shore on ""Boston Legal""), explores life in contemporary China, highlighting the opportunities and challenges of life in the world's most populous nation and fastest growing economy.

You'll meet a twelve-year-old gymnast hoping to make the Olympic team; a window cleaner in Shanghai who moved there for the economic opportunities, while his wife and child live in the country; a young woman who gets plastic surgery to improve her prospects in the business world; nomads of Inner Mongolia; a wealthy property developer; rice growers; a master of martial arts; a woman who works on the drug squad; and the last of the imperial bowmakers.

I was disappointed that almost nothing was said about how the Chinese government and economy actually work, and I would've liked to hear more about the effects and side-effects of the ""one child"" policy. I like James Spader, but his narration struck me as excessively earnest and dramatic, as did the musical score, especially given the film's rather bland, ""safe"" content.

A much better documentary about contemporary China is ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-From-the-Inside/dp/B000LXHK0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China From the Inside</a>.""

2678436,5,B000JRYOME,"""China Revealed"" follows several individual Chinese as the oldest continuous civilization on earth transitions into a leadership position. Its 1.3 billion people are expected to become the next superpower, and the world's largest economy within twenty years. All despite being comprised by over 50 different peoples and 7 major languages, fortunately united by the common ability to read and write Chinese.

Viewers begin by seeing incredibly terraced 8 century-old rice fields in a mountainous region, and learn that less than 10% of China is arable (large desert and mountain areas). The ""good news"" is that peasant income has increased 1,500% since they were given control of their lands in 1978.

Urban residents, however, have fared even better. Shanghai is 8X the size of NYC, with 20 million inhabitants, vs. NYC's 8 million. One new immigrant from the rural areas is followed as he works long hours cleaning skyscraper windows and saves his money for his family back home.

""China Revealed"" also follows a 12-year-old girl selected for training in gymnastics beginning at age two (6 hours/day for six days/week), a young female computer worker who undertakes cosmetic surgery to improve her chances of promotion, Inner Mongolians following traditional ways while worrying about change, and a rural female police chief who has risen above traditional Chinese sexism.

Overall, ""China Revealed"" is an impressive depiction of an impressive people moving forward.",1217030400,,1467,5.393013100436681

2678439,5,B000JRYOME,"I fell in love with this series on Discovery HDTheater, and was one of the first discs I ordered on BluRay. Unlike most documentaries, Discovery Atlas follows the lives for a year of a handful of people in this country. All the footage was filmed with state-of-the-art HD cameras, with the result being the single most beautiful thing ever shot in HD, with a story that will keep you glued to the set.

Being an early BluRay release, and a disc version of a TV show, some may be turned off by the lack of HighRes sound, and the 1080i source, but do not let that turn you off. The high-bitrate of the video means much higher quality than anything you will see on your satelite or cable HD feed, and unless you have a 70 inch 1080p screen and are looking for the differences, you will not notice the difference between 1080i and 1080p. The audio track is quite agressive for a Dolby Digital Plus soundtrack, and amazing considering its a documentary.

Being a direct transfer of the original HD source, you will see no pixelation, the edges are sharp, detail is thrown at you from even the tiniest of objects in the background, colors are vibrant, and blacks seem to be true.

Bonus features include the making of the series, and a few promotional clips that were shown on the Discovery Channel. Bonus features are identical on each disc in the series.",1214784000,2,1350,4.524590163934426
2678440,5,B000JRYOME,"Having studied and lived in China for over a year I was delighted with the fact that it focused on China's true treasure, its people. There are many books and videos that will give the tourist views of the Great Wall, Forbidden City and the many sites of Shanghai. This DVD will put a face to the country we across the world hear so much about and brings back fond memories of the friends I have made while in China.

Unbiased and well executed but if you are looking for the history of the Great Wall look elsewhere. This is a story about the people of China and the daily struggles and triumphs they have in becomming a modern, industrialized nation.",1212192000,2,652,4.3884297520661155
2678441,3,B000JRYOME,"The videography, the production values, and the mellow tones of James Spader, and the HD DVD itself are excellent, but that's it. Call this educational if you want, but its more about polishing up the image of China for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. This documentary reveals startling facts about China as being the world's most consuming nation of raw materials on earth simply because its 1,300,000,000 people have gotten a taste of capitalism and they like it. It features video of a country that for a long time was synonomous with Communist tyranny. Even though the Chinese have made great strides in improving their lifestyles since the Red Guard  plundered through the countryside trying to  strip away everything cultural and uniquely Chinese, there is still much oppression. Just look at the recent political unrest regarding Tibet. This documentary highlights different families in the ""new"" China and how they fit in with the rest of the world. I think the producers at the Discovery Channel were sincere in their efforts to present an unbiased look at China, but they look at it with a different set of eyes than I do. I for one thing think that Chinese manufactured goods, while they may be cheap, are substandard and in some cases, dangerous.  I still look at the Chinese government as being typical for communist countries, and cannot be trusted. While the Chinese people now have more economic freedom and more opportunities, they are not free, no matter how pretty they try to package it.  Dan Casey",1211846400,,1517,4.9140625
2678442,2,B000JRYOME,"This video has all the great HD quality in 1080i, but I was not too thrilled after viewing, it is basically about urbanized China, little on nature view.  Excellent picture on cities; however, if you looking for landscape, mountains, terrains, etc.. for your HD TV, not recommended, because you will see none and disappointed.",1210723200,4,326,5.037037037037037
2678443,5,B000JRYOME,"It is a shame that there are people who don't bother to READ what these documentaries are about BEFORE they buy them and are disappointed.

The oft-stated aim of Discovery Atlas is not a history lesson ... it is a unique look at countries through the eyes and personal stories of a select group of individuals.

What better ways to learn the true feelings and emotions than by this manner.

Exquisitely shot, wonderfully narrated, these videos provide a unique look into each of these nations that one would not otherwise EVER be party to.",1198800000,8,539,4.712765957446808
2678444,4,B000JRYOME,Overall not bad.  But not much scenery of the China's.  There are stories about different people.  Wished it had more native sceneries.,1196380800,3,135,5.045454545454546
2678445,3,B000JRYOME,"This is a well-photographed look into modern Chinese culture with a focus on human-interest-style narratives. It follows a gymnast, window-washer as (to lesser degrees) policewoman, master bow-maker, rice farmer and Kung-Fu instructor - and examines the diversity of their daily lives. While there is some exploration of the wealth of natural and man-made majesty of China (the great Wall, the Dragon's Back, the Forbidden City), this is not the focus of this film. If you are expecting a geographical tour, with a history lesson and insight into the enormous cultural diversity of this country, this is not the place. But it is an engaging exploration of modern lifestyle and ambition, giving the viewer a glimpse into the lives of diverse people, along with their motivations and aspirations. I would buy it again, but it leaves so much unanswered that additional titles are warranted.",1195948800,6,887,5.20979020979021
2678446,2,B000JRYOME,"I was expecting a little better production than this. With the vast area that is encompassed by China, with its ancient culture and history; one would have anticipated more coverage of that rather than the excessive coverage of the country yokel who seeks his fortune in the big city and the young female olympic hopeful. Also, I have to agree with the other reviewer about the quality of the picture. Perhaps after watching Planet Earth I'm a bit spoiled; but I didn't think this dvd deserved to be advertised as high definition .
Finally, I wouldn't purchase this dvd if given the chance to do it over again.",1189900800,3,610,4.657407407407407
2678447,2,B000JRYOME,"Having traveled to China 10 times in the past 8 years, I was eager to show family and friends some of the places I have been.  I expected much more footage of the Great Wall.  I spent 5 hours walking on the wall...China Revealed spent about 5 minutes covering the Great Wall.  A large part of China Revealed was about a young Chinese athelete and her hopes of winning Gold for China in the 2008 Olympics and of a window-washer in Beijing and his travels home for Chinese New Year.  Both were interesting segments, but not what you expect in a high definition disc.  If I had had the opportunity to preview China Revealed before buying, I would not have purchased it.",1187827200,10,666,4.426229508196721
2678448,5,B000JRYOME,"Where to start. When I originally seen this I assumed it was an ordinary documentary covering history and culture. However, this wonderful series took a step in a different direction by getting more into the lives of current residents, and how current life ties into the history of the country. There are many comparisons of the original culture to currrent culture, including the parts of the country that are conforming, and the parts that choose to keep everything in its purest essence. Overall, you will enjoy learning of parts unknown in this very nicely captured and directed contemporary documentary.

Also to note - the quality of the video is very nice - I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.",1182297600,7,702,4.754098360655738

8152689,5,B000JRYOME,"Excellent documentary.  Even though it is a few years old (made when China hosted the Olympics), I still use it in my classroom as a cultural viewpoint of China and what the future holds for the world and China due to this fascinating culture and country.  Everyone who watches it, even though it is quite long, comments positively on it.  I have shown it in middle school and college with positive results in both.  Very well made and put together--it holds your attention well.  It highlights several different people in varying areas of China and the struggles they have faced, are facing, and anticipate facing in the future.  It follows a young child trying to achieve a place in the Olympics and discusses the changing roles of family and the one-child policy--how it affects those singular children.  It also follows several women trying to make adjustments to attitudes about women entering the workforce in China, trying to compete against a Westernized thinking world, and how traditional roles of women/men are being challenged and altered.  It compares/contrasts the struggle young people are faced with in so far as remaining true to past traditions, yet seeking out the more modern roles that are so adamant within the world today.  This movie spans all areas of China--doesn't just focus on one area, and spans several different topics as they relate to the culture of the China, as well as their role within the span of the world.  It does a good job of comparing and contrasting China's culture with that of the Western cultures and discusses traditions, future problems that China is going to have to deal with (as well as the rest of the world), and the young vs. the old in so far as thought processes politically, within the business realm, professionally, traditionally, and culturally, as well as family roles/responsibilities, changing perspectives about men/women's roles within Chinese culture (jobs, family, societal, etc.), touches on a bit of the history of China and how that is presently affecting some of the choices the Chinese are faced with and making, the industrial side of China, farming, arts, writing/language, etc.  Very well-rounded documentary that is filled with a lot of good information.  I hope Discovery can make another more modern version of this film in the future--it was well put together, but what it contains, is still very viable in any classroom that might be dealing with China, change, world relations, changing working roles, the future of the world in general (in a business and economic sense), cultural family roles, traditions, etc.  Even though it is a bit outdated, most of the information in it still applies today.

Of interest is the kung fu practice from the Buddhist temple and the horse riding in Mongolia with the geographic stars pin on a China map which included Tibet and Sinkiang.  This program however, does not cover the China history from 1840 to 1949 which witnessed imperialism and colonialism on this ancient country doped by British opium into""the sick-man of East Asia"".  But with Deng's 1978 reformation and opening, China grow by leaps and bounds with admirable progress to catch up.

China has been a leader for thousand years.  The latest catch up development is to restore and reclaim its glory.  In free trade, China always gains surplus as in 19th century and now.  British pushed opium to reverse the deficit by waging wars while now China was accused of currency manipulation as the number one creditor.  Is it true or just sensational for political gain?

8152696,2,B000JRYOME,"Most other reviews are for the standard-definition DVD version.  And for regular DVD, ""China Revealed"" probably looks great.  BUT NOT ON BLU-RAY.  For a Blu-ray disc, this ""hi-definition"" tour of China has some of the worst video quality I've seen for a released BD.  It may have been okay for their ""broadcast"" where signals get highly compressed any way, but an actual Blu-ray disc can allow for a much better signal.  The blockiness and poor video compression of this BD often makes people's faces look like they were built out of legos and the details of the supposedly amazing vistas look like they've been smudged, crushed or created with construction paper cut-outs.  I was so looking forward to a beautiful tour of China; and although the subject matter is often amazing, it is only a mild exaggeration to say that you can download better picture quality off of YouTube.  Many PlayStation Network downloads do look better.  It was disappointing to see the marvelous colors of such a rich country so poorly compressed.  See the documentary, learn its lessons about China, but don't waste your money on the Blu-ray version. Buy it in standard-def (which probably was the original source).  A travelogue or Blu-ray title that should be LIVING on its video quality should LOOK much, much better than this.  And I would expect better from a name like ""Discovery HD"".  These images are blotchy, blocky and jagged.",1231286400,6,1415,4.924050632911392
