1714008,2,B000067D8W,"This is one of my favorite shows, but I am disappionted that they decided to put two inferior on the DVD. This show stars the always amazing looking Tom Welling as Clark Kent, Kristen Kruek as the sappy Lana Lang, Micheal Rosenbaulm as the furture nemasis Lex Luthor, and Allison Mack as the Lois Lane parralel Chloe Sullivan. In the first episode they put on the DVD, Pilot, it goes through all the basics, how the Kents found Clark, the meteor shower affecting everyone in Smallville (one of the things that did not happen in the comic book, but after you see the better episodes you forgive the wroters for putting in), Clark's crush on the pretty but oh so annoying girl-next-door with the jelous boyfriend played by Eric Johnson(she gets less annoying in later episodes),Clark saving Lex's life and consequently becoming his best friend(a courageous but greatmove by the writers)and of course the X-Files like villian trying to kill people in Smallville. The chram of the epsiodes make you forget all the glaring faults, except for Lana, about Smallville. The second episode a bug guy attacks Smallville. Frankly, Iwas very uoset when I lerned that they were putting these two episodes on the DVD because besides for Reaper and Drone these are the two worst episodes although the premeire provides information thet you need to understand the future episodes. If you can possibly see other episodes I highly recommend it, but as for these two don't waste your money.",1023667200,,1470,4.884
1714009,5,B000067D8W,"That would be great, even though ""Smallville"" has just ended its first season. I've seen every single episode of ""Smallville"" since Day One, so I can easily say that this was one of the best new series on TV...despite the fact that it's a ""teen show"". A lot of critics tried to compare ""Smallville"" to ""Alias"" and said that ""Alias"" was better (later on during the season, after they had already said at the beginning that ""Smallville"" would be a great show), but I also saw ""Alias"" and I have to say that I enjoyed ""Smallville"" a lot more--and I was never even a huge fan of Superman!
""Smallville"" is a show about the teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling), living in Smallville, Kansas and who will someday grow up into Superman. But for now, he is trying to fit in with the normal human being life of a teenager...all while trying to win over the girl of his dreams, Lana Lang (formally known as Lois Lang in the Superman comics and movies), played by Kristin Kreuk. Then there's the rich Lex Luther (Michael Rosenbaum), who is friends with Clark but also trying to find out how Clark saved him when he hit Clark while driving and crashed into a river in the Pilot Episode, which you will find on this disc. Lana is also going out with this guy named Whitney (Eric Johnson), who later in the show becomes so-so friends with Clark when they start to trust each other. Clark lives with his parents (played by Annete O'Tool and John Schinder, I think that's how you spell their names) on the Kent Farm and Clark has two best friends, Chloe and Pete.
In every episode, you watch Clark Kent save at least one person from the ""ultimate danger"". Every episode gets more and more interesting, until you get hooked on the show and can't stop watching it (that's what happened to me!). The entire cast are all very talented, and the screenwriting is excellent. The special effects are also quite amazing, too. And Tom Welling is very hot, and even more hot when he takes his shirt off! So besides this cast being very talented, there's also some great ""eye-candy"", too.
As for this disc, it contains the full ""Pilot"" episode and the second episode, which is called ""Metamorphisis"". It's a Canadian Import so you can only buy it from Amazon.com, but if you love the show then it'll be well-worth it. I hope this means that ""Smallville"" will get ""complete seasons of"" DVD box sets, but they'll be released here in the United States, too. I can't wait for next season because ""Smallville"" is the best new show on TV. If you haven't seen it yet then you are seriously missing out! I highly recommend this DVD to all fans of the show and to those who didn't catch the show but would like to try it to see if it's your cup of tea. But trust me...all the better episodes come on later during the season, so don't just judge by the first two episodes!",1022976000,12,2829,4.463320463320463

1714011,5,B000067D8W,"This disc containing the first 2 episodes of the series have been combined to play as a movie length episode which follows how it was played on television as a repeat. The advantages of watching this exclusive Canadian import - where the series is filmed - are the extra features and the pleasure of being able to watch it over and over without degradation. I'm interested in hearing the audio commentaries and would really like to see some outtakes or deleted scenes on the disc.
The fact that this DVD has come out so soon after the show first aired is something in itself, since the first season has only just finished airing on TV.
The cool thing about the show are the great special effects which are in ample supply in about every episode and the very likeable young cast. The first of which I had seen of 2 of it's cast members - Tom Welling (Clark Kent) and Kristen Kreuk (Lana Lang). Michael Rosenbaum is also great as Lex Luthor. The Theme song ""Save Me"" by Remy Zero is also a great choice for such a show as Clark ends up saving at least 1 person in each episode.
After watching this movie it will be easy to get hooked to the show. One stand-out scene in particular involves the meteor shower at the start. All-in-all I think the mix of drama, humour, special effects and the great looking cast all combine to make this show one that will appeal to all age groups.
I'll be looking forward to when they have the whole series on DVD as I'll be one of the first people to buy it...",1022716800,13,1491,4.328571428571428
1714012,4,B000067D8W,"WB's new top-rated show, Smallville, has finally hit DVD! For those who are a bit fuzzy on the details, the show revolves around the teenage years of Clark Kent, whose destiny eventually leads him to become Superman. I'm not completely sure of the specs of the disc, but appearantly it includes the Pilot episode and the second episode (Metamorphisis), a deleted scene from the Pilot episode, an audio commentary by the producers, and an interactive map of Smallville.
Admittedly, these two early episodes don't represent the best of what Smallville has to offer. Critics who think of the show as a Buffy/Dawson's Creek clone will have plenty to pick on here: we get a homecoming dance, teen angst over the girl next door (Lana Lang, played by an amazingly beautiful Kristen Kreuk)a 'freak of the week' who can control electricity (and later another one in the 'bugboy' vein), actors way too old to be in high school, and a typical 'Buffy-esque' plot: Boy likes girl. Girl has jealous jock boyfriend. Jealous jock boyfriend strings up boy in cornfield with kryptonite draped around his neck. And yes, the ending is overly sentimental and melodramatic, but like all hollywood teen flicks, it'll still manage to break your heart.
However, the show still offers plenty of good stuff, for both newcomers and devoted Superman fans. The interaction between the characters are dead on, as is casting. The guy from the Dukes of Hazzard and Lana Lang from 'Superman III' (sorry, I can't spell their names) are perfect as Clark's parents. Tom Welling, Clark Kent, besides being a great actor, resembles previous Supermen Dean Cain and Christopher Reeve, and carries on the torch well. You'll forget about how old Welling really is five minutes into the story. Perhaps the show's riskest gamble, introducing a young Lex Luthor as Clark's big-brother/mentor, is it's biggest payoff. Michael Rosenbaum steals the show as Lex Luthor, and the show does a great job playing on the irony of his friendship with Clark.
There are also several Superman references for fans, as is the norm with each episode. Be on the lookout for Clark in a symbolic red Superman cape, and the familiar 'S' shield in the most unlikely of situations.
I highly recommend this disc. While the episodes are somewhat weak, the quality of the show has increased with almost every episode, and there's still enough goodies in here to warrant a look. Heres to hoping Smallville will be a very successful series.",1022630400,9,2466,4.944578313253012

1714018,5,B000067D8W,"Just finished watching Smallville on a streaming service for free.  Wanted to own the set because I love Clark and Lana's love story and their chemistry. Best Clark Kent/Superman IMO.
I had to return this set once, and I'm now commenting on the replacement set. I just sent the first set back today.  Each set had discs that were scratched and smudged.  I took the good discs from the 2 boxes of Season 1 to make a complete undamaged Season 1 and did the same thing with Season 2.  Both discs 6 of S2 were damaged.  The one I kept didn't have major scratches/smudges. But it takes a while to start and then it skips and can see blue,orange and gray squares and lines when it begins.  After waiting a while, it did play.  Watched 2 episodes, and the last episode will not play right.  It skips and stops/starts.  So one whole episode is missing because it will not play.  So I've just ordered a third set.  I only need Disc 6 on Season 2, but of course that's not an option.  Boxes look used.  First set didn't have the new repackaged disc holders and the plastic inserts were loose and 1 disc wouldn't fit on the holder at all.  It was the most damaged.
I see others have had complaints with their copies also.  I wanted to order the 10-season set, but after reading reviews decided it would be better to buy these.  Guess I was wrong.  I'd just give up, but I really want this series...at least through Season 8 when Lana and Clark are torn apart.  I've ordered Season 5, but it's so banged up I'm afraid to open it.",1483488000,,1517,4.30035335689046

The entire fist season was awesome and worked great. However, the first disk of the second season wouldn't play on anything I had. I tried my pc, Xbox, playstation, DVD player, and even Blu-ray player and nothing. This is a great purchase don't get me wrong, but I'm a little disappointed that I can't continue with seasons 2 until I buy a new DVD set. I'm also kinda surprised that nowhere on this page could I find a ""Contact seller"" option. If it had one,  it would really help, but again...all in all,  I would recommend this product to all if not most of my friends.",1475280000,2,727,4.417910447761194

had to create an alter ego in able to fit into society which as

I love this series and I embrace it for what it really is, relating to those who are afraid sometimes to be who they really

are in society in fear of persecution. Growing pains are represented here as well which is why I think it is relatable

The show could bring in yet another pathetic teenager who has been infected by the meteor rocks and goes down in another pathetic stand off against the incredible dull and loser Clark Kent. Need I say more???

How about a history lesson?

Clark Kent is not actually real, but a disguise to hide the identity of Superman. He came to earth as a baby (NOT a toddler) to survive the destruction of his home planet Krypton. He grows up as a farm boy in the town of Smallville where his powers appear and mature. He has no friends, (no Chloe, no Pete, and especially not a young Lex Luther) but there is a Lana Lang who is his love interest. He can never be with her because she can never know his secret. Clark grows into a young man and then assuming the role of Superboy where he deals with foes with extraordinary powers that come from outer space, other dimensions, and areas OUTSIDE of Smallville. That us when he becomes brief friends with Lex Luther and fatal disaster destroys their relationship and thus becoming enemies. Finally as he becomes a man, his destiny is complete by taking up the role as Superman. In order to fit into society he disguises himself once again as a news reporter for The Metropolis Daily Planet and meets his true love Louis Lane. And still the foes come stronger and harder then ever, even the dreaded Doomsday. Thus there is the life of Superman WHO BECOMES Clark Kent.

SEASON ONE: Toddler Ka-El comes to Earth during a meteor shower and grows up into high school freshman Clark Kent. (Who looks like he's been held back for four years along with everyone else attending Smallville High) He learns of his origins and deals with special powers that arise which help him with the lame and everyday events. They also help him deal with troubled residents who have been affected by meteor rocks and keeps on screwing up his chances of getting a girlfriend with either the beautiful Lana Lang or his friend the article writer Chloe. After saving the life of a Lex Luthor whom is in his twenties, Clark becomes best friends with him, which only complicates the burden of keeping his powers and origins a secret.

The only thing that this season had going for it was cute young women and an okay soundtrack. The crisis that arise become so repetitive that you just wished they would stop showing up, but then you'd have to watch an hour of a teenager and his friends hanging out trying to hide their true feelings from another. The special effects are cool but that's all that matters to these days now isn't it?

SEASON TWO: More of Clark's powers surface to help him do battle against pathetic threats and his friendships either grew or slowly begin to fall apart.

Once again this show is very repetitive and only has pretty women, a good soundtrack, and cool special effects going for it. You keep finding yourself wanting to scream; ""JUST PUT CLARK AND LANA TOGETHER SINCE YOU'VE KILLED THE STORY OF SUPERMAN!"" At least Christopher Reeves makes an appearance but his part is so boring you've got to wonder how much the show paid him to be in it. The finale is interesting because Jor-El finally shows up and demands Clark to face his destiny.

SEASON THREE: After fighting his addiction to red kryptonite, Clark returns to Smallville to try to fix and pick things back up with Lana.

The premiere was okay because it was dealing with Superman ideas, and so was the episode where a drunken Perry White makes a stop in Smallville for the same reason. Other than that, things are the same for the story line and the effects. Once again Christopher Reeves makes an appearance, which is just beyond me knowing why. This season was the most disappointing of all because the viewer was expecting Clark to at least become Superboy, which he never did. Jor-El calls Clark home and the finale ends there.

SEASON FOUR: All that can be said is that it returns in September and a young Louis Lane comes into play.

Hopefully when Clark returns from the Krypton dimension, he will assume the role of Superboy. (That's probably asking too much though isn't it?) This show should have been canceled long ago during the first season and should have been an embarrassment to everyone involved, but I guess everyone is on drugs. What the writers and creators don't get is; Superman is always Superman, he can never stop being him. Clark Kent is just a disguise to hide that fact. This show is not about Superman and sadly it's not even about Superboy. It's about a boy named Clark Kent, who has a Jonathan and Martha Kent as parents, has a friend named Lex Luthor, lives in a town named Smallville, and just happens to have super powers that helps him in a crisis, but the show is not about Superman or Superboy. I am disgusted to see the Superman emblem on this show.",1092009600,5,4863,4.56651376146789

The DVD set has some beautiful interactive menus and this thing is loaded with extras, which is unusual for a television show on DVD.

1714058,5,B000067D8W,"The popular TV series on the WB channel follows the life of young Clark Kent (Played by Tom Welling) as a teenager. He discovers his amazing super-powers, grows up with the girl he has a crush on Lana Lang, and develops a friendship with a a evil genius, who will in time become the bald Lex Luthor.

1714060,4,B000067D8W,"At first the idea of another Roswell/Buffy with a superhero twist doesn't exactly bode well for a genre that is already being done to death in the marketplace.  So it was with no small amount of apprehension that I found myself viewing the pilot episode of Smallville one sunday afternoon on UK Television.  Although familiar with the comics I was and am no big Superman fan yet within 20 minutes the show had me in thrall and I thought - Jesus, this is actually a good show.  Sure the X-Files villian of the week idea couldn't work forever but that soon became secondary to the characterisation that the writers and actors bring to this show.  Clark alone is a contradiction of Freudian proportions - strong yet insecure, handsome but lonely, secretive (out of necessity regarding his powers) yet warm and open.  And then their are his parents - brilliantly portrayed by veterans Annette O'Toole and John Schneider who provide a caring and supportive backbone to Clarks 'different' adolescence.  But out of all the characters none holds the show quite so well as Lex Luthor played by Michael Rosenbaum.  In direct contrast to Clark, he is the one character that we all know will one day become the villian of the show and yet you cannot help but feel sympathetic to Lex.  Michael Rosenbaum brings an overwhelming humanity to the show that stems from Lex being unloved by his father and the unenviable position of outsider as a result of this and the meteor crash that left him bald.  My upbringing was similiar to Clarks but in one episode when you see Lex stare at Clark and his family hugging after a life threatening incident you can't help but feel his pain and envy.  Yes it is that good a show - even the coldest heart will find comfort here.  The DVD is a nice transfer and the extras a pleasant surprise considering Warner normally limit such things especially on TV Show DVD's (Babylon 5 The Gathering springs to mind!).  The commentary is a bit dull though with little given away, instead the creators just rehash what the viewer could gleam from watching the pilot themselves.  Perhaps if they release the first season as a box set (the smart money says they will) the actors themselves could do the commentary as I'm sure this would be more entertaining.  Saying that its a nice little DVD and exclusive to canada as well.  Recommended.",1032393600,,2349,4.681265206812652
1714061,2,B000067D8W,"This is one of my favorite shows, but I am disappionted that they decided to put two inferior on the DVD. This show stars the always amazing looking Tom Welling as Clark Kent, Kristen Kruek as the sappy Lana Lang, Micheal Rosenbaulm as the furture nemasis Lex Luthor, and Allison Mack as the Lois Lane parralel Chloe Sullivan. In the first episode they put on the DVD, Pilot, it goes through all the basics, how the Kents found Clark, the meteor shower affecting everyone in Smallville (one of the things that did not happen in the comic book, but after you see the better episodes you forgive the wroters for putting in), Clark's crush on the pretty but oh so annoying girl-next-door with the jelous boyfriend played by Eric Johnson(she gets less annoying in later episodes),Clark saving Lex's life and consequently becoming his best friend(a courageous but greatmove by the writers)and of course the X-Files like villian trying to kill people in Smallville. The chram of the epsiodes make you forget all the glaring faults, except for Lana, about Smallville. The second episode a bug guy attacks Smallville. Frankly, Iwas very uoset when I lerned that they were putting these two episodes on the DVD because besides for Reaper and Drone these are the two worst episodes although the premeire provides information thet you need to understand the future episodes. If you can possibly see other episodes I highly recommend it, but as for these two don't waste your money.",1023667200,,1470,4.884

I think it is the best television show ever made. Period. The first season is only a preview to what is ahead in the latter ones. But it is a solid telling of what drives Clark Kent to the point he puts on a red and blue suit to fly around the world saving people.
It's not Superman's story, but Clark's, and Welling does a fine job at it, growing with the role through all ten seasons.

Now, all we need is a reunion show entitled ""Metropolis!""",1494460800,,599,4.067796610169491
