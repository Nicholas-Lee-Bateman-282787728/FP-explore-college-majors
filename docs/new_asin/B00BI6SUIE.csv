5622822,5,B00BI6SUIE,Great movie. I just wish that at the end they would show the real people at the end of the movie along current info and success rates of the Hive.,1370908800,2,146,3.9
5622823,5,B00BI6SUIE,"This film is a realistic dramatization of at-risks and troubled youths facing incredible odds to stay safe and out of prison. As someone who grew up in violent street gangs and have worked with incarcerated teens, I applaud the writer and director for illustrating how children are often exploited by their own parents. The scenes are powerful and the acting (all around) is superb. Some of the reviewers have commented about the film's ending, but to me, it's perfect, from the standpoint of getting the message across regarding the life and death proposition that many youths face. The support system and structure that organizations like In the Hive provide is inspiring and they do work, when resources are adequate and caring, competent staff are in place.

5622826,5,B00BI6SUIE,Great story wish the end was better. All actors roles were strong and breath taking. Michael Clack Ducan was excellent,1368662400,2,118,4.95
5622827,5,B00BI6SUIE,I just got this movie and watched it its a very touching movie but very good love it. Loretta Devine and Vivica Fox played very well in the movie it just show that there are kids out there like the kids in this movie that need people to care about them and believe in them,1367971200,3,272,3.963636363636364
5622828,3,B00BI6SUIE,"I usually don't watch this type of movie.  However, I found it to be interesting and had to purchase it.  I found it to be better than I initially thought.  It is worth watching.",1367971200,2,178,4.176470588235294
5622829,4,B00BI6SUIE,"This film should be shown at High Schools, Youth Centers and Church Groups every where. It is a really great film, to be honest this is the first movie in along while that I have enjoyed from Robert Townsend, this is some of his finest work from this decade.

This movie will have you dying to see the end, and what happens with the main characters, because you will get the sense that these young men are real, that they do exsist and in some ways they do, there are young men for various reasons who join gangs, or take the low road in life. And this movie potrays it perfectly, its not at all cheesy or preachy.

I must warn that the ending is a cliff hanger, so you will feel a little disappointed at the end. I think this would have made a great show, and its one of the last works by Michael Clark Duncan (RIP)

The Hive is an alternative school for young men, who have troubled there way out of the public school system, you will follow the life of one young man, with a history of gang life running deep in his family. And also get a glimpse at 3 other young men who are his classmates.",1365465600,11,1094,4.126760563380282

5622831,5,B00BI6SUIE,"This movie should be part of every young man's requirement to entering eight grade or sooner. It's as real as real can get. Michael Clark Duncan, my he rest in the Lord, portrayed the the perfect role model for every young man that doesn't have a positive male figure in his life to guide him. He provokes young men (and women) to thick twice and three times about the choices they make because they really do last a lifetime -- good or bad. The move caught  and kept my twenty-one year old's attention and that's hard to do since he thinks he already knows everything he needs to know to get through this life. Great job Robert Townsend and cast!!",1362268800,29,648,4.4

5622870,5,B00BI6SUIE,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is about a troubled young man who is accepted into an inovative program called ""The Hive"". It details how the program changed his life despite family and gang affiliations trying to keep him from improving his life.  In the program he meets people who see his potential both staff members and fellow students. Their encouragement helps him to see himself in a different light.  I love how this movie exposes the pitfalls people have when they are trying to improve their lives but also shows that things are not always hopeless.",1398988800,,560,4.762886597938144

5622873,5,B00BI6SUIE,This is a must see for anyone who has teenagers....who thinks that the world is against them and things will never change...young men need to watch this film with a father or male roll model,1397433600,,190,4.457142857142857
5622874,4,B00BI6SUIE,I think this movie gives a very raw look at life on the 'streets' and how 1-2 people can make a difference in a child's life.,1395964800,,125,3.8461538461538463
5622875,4,B00BI6SUIE,"The basis of the Hive should be extended nation wide to ensure we save as many of our young men as we can from gangs, violence, drugs and prisons.  The USA is  know for the country with the most prisons in the world.  The Hive proves that with love and guidance our youth can be deterred from a life of crime or from being thugs.

5622883,5,B00BI6SUIE,"I would recommend this film to those who wonder why it isn't  ""just a snap"" to turn a young gang member's life around.
It is agony.",1391558400,,131,4.038461538461538

5622885,5,B00BI6SUIE,"I loved ""In the Hive"" so much that I watched it twice and I emailed the principal of my school and asked her to view it.  I am a teacher at an alternative school and the movie encouraged me to keep on working with the school population that we have.

This is a ""Amazon Verified Purchase""",1391385600,,287,4.107142857142857
5622886,5,B00BI6SUIE,"I'm glad that I took a chance in owning this film in stead of viewing it through Netflix first. This movie is brilliant. This is a gem,especially for those who like movie to watch that dill with adversity among our young people.",1391385600,,228,4.4523809523809526

5622888,5,B00BI6SUIE,"I was tempted to go with 4 stars, due to profanity and the opening scenes, I shut it off. Then I watched it again and so glad I did, as I watched it another 2 times the same day. I love & miss the late Michael Clark Duncan, (Bear in Armaggedon) who was so great in that role. First I am not racist! I am white and retired, but grew up in the Midwest. My neighbors, best friends and dance partners were black, as well as our Prom Queen. My first taste of rasism was on vacation to FL in 1969. Where I got in trouble because I served the maid lunch! One of the nicest people I ever met. I went there for 10 days and left less than two days later, because of what I saw and was told I cannot do! This movie has every race and you will fall in love with most all of them, as you follow their lives.
I can take a few curse words, save for one, GD, but it actually fit this movie. These young men get a second chance at the Hive or jail time. The teachers were mixed, most new and scared to death. You actually see them grow as well as these troubled young men and they way they live, gangs, home life or lack there of.

Loretta, (I love) and always great, (up for a NCAAP award she better win) as she was over the top in this movie! Nobody could have done it better. Casting couldn't have been better. Vivica Fox was almost unrecognizable, but great too. Jonathan McDaniel, (I believe was his debue film) is destined to be seen a lot more. You are in for a real experience, emotional, furious and deeply inspiring trip, that's very thought provoking. In the end you will be standing and cheering for this movie. We should certainly be demanding more places like the Hive and want every young person out there to have such a second chance! Not to mention the staff of people that work there.

Buy or rent this movie and I assure you, it can be life changing. Did you guess? I loved this movie!",1387929600,,1887,4.097297297297297

5622891,4,B00BI6SUIE,"Michael Clark Duncan was always a favorite of mine, may he rest in peace.  Loretta Devine is another who really plays her role excellently, no matter what.  This movie is an eye opening type movie and I rated high just because of the issues we still face in America today but may forget it's still happening.",1383177600,,308,4.482142857142857

5622901,5,B00BI6SUIE,"I agree with the person saying this movie should be mandatory! A great movie! In the end, the young man showing that inner strength, gave me chills and strength and courage. One of the reasons it should be mandatory",1374796800,,215,4.538461538461538
5622902,5,B00BI6SUIE,"Great movie.  I've already shared it with others.  It does open a person's eyes to what our youth are faced with on a daily basis . . . from drugs, gangs, babies, etc. A must watch for the entire family.  There is some profanity, which should be blocked out for children, however, the message is relevant and real for today.",1374192000,,324,4.366666666666666
5622903,4,B00BI6SUIE,"This movie was very revealing of the types of things we need in our society today especially for the young african american young men today.

5622910,4,B00BI6SUIE,"Not at all what I expected.  Shows that good can be pulled out of anybody that wants it bad enough.  But, sometimes ""bad"" is generational and almost impossible to re-direct.  I tip my hat to all teachers who truly care about the students they are trying reach and trying to teach.  Teachers can make a difference!  It's high time they get more appreciation; more support; and more money  for the difficult job they do. Loretta DeVine is ""devine"" in this movie as she is in all her roles.  Michael Clark Duncan (R.I.P.) was outstanding in this, his final movie role.",1372291200,,565,4.59
