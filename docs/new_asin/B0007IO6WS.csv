2213933,5,B0007IO6WS,I liked season 1 but season 2 is by far the best I've seen in this series so far. Personally I think that what did it for me is the season 2 finale where Jackie bought pot for god knows what when she had given it to Hyde the police gave it to him even though it wasn't his. That was great. I can't wait to see the rest of the whole series myself!,1110153600,5,346,3.689189189189189

Thank God the fine people at 20th Century Fox are smart enough to start releasing the DVDs of That '70s Show close together and just releasing them at all. I can't wait for future season releases and more of THAT '70S SHOW!

2213936,1,B0007IO6WS,"This item did not match what I ordered. The picture of the item is the Slim Set version of  season 2 with a specific cover I was looking for to complete my collection. I was very disappointed to open my package and find the bulk/box version of season 2 with a different cover. Although this is still season 2 with all the same shows, it is not what I was looking for and not what is pictured. I wouldn't mind as much if I wasn't looking for a specific cover.

I hate leaving bad reviews but like I said, I was very disappointed.

On a good note, the packaging was great and i received it on time.",1495324800,,596,4.076923076923077
2213937,5,B0007IO6WS,"This is a show that reminds me a LOT of my childhood in the 70's. Hanging out in the basement watching TV and all! Topher Grace stars as Eric, a nerdy yet kind teen. Mila Kunis stars as the snobby yet sexy girl we all seem to know at least once in our life. Ashton Kutcher plays Kelso, a wild teen with not a lot in the brains department but Jacke(Kunis) doesn't mind. Tanya Roberts of Charlie's Angels fame stars as the neighbor's wife and Donna's mom. Laura Prepon plays the role of Donna, a VERY hot looking girl that has it in all the right spots and is Eric's girlfriend. Danny Masterson plays Hyde. Hyde is into some ""stuff"" that leads to all sorts of basement parties and illegal substances that cause raucous laughter out loud comedy gold. More stars as well including guest stars that you will easily recognize with constant 70's references to other shows like Chips(starring Erik Estrada), Charlie's Angels, Happy Days(RIP Erin Moran), and Grease(the movie). This will bring back memories and make more of 70's legend.",1493337600,,1028,4.653846153846154

2213950,5,B0007IO6WS,"The series returned for a full length season with over twenty fabulous and funny episodes. This terrific cast included Ashton Kutcher, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis, Laura Prepon, Topher Grace, Kurtwood Smith, Wilmer Valderamma, Lisa Robin Kelly, Tanya Roberts (Charlie's Angels) and Don Stark. Set in 1977, the friends Michael Kelso (Kutcher); his annoying rich girlfriend, Jackie Burkhart (Kunis); Donna (Prepon); Eric Forman (Grace); and Fez (Valderamma) get together in Point Place, Wisconsin and usually at Eric's basement. His parents (Smith and Rupp) are believable and likable as Red and Kitty Forman. They are friends and neighbors with Donna's parents, the Pinciottis (Roberts, Stark).

There are plenty of laughs along with surprise guest appearances like Marion Ross (Grandma Forman) who reprises her role. Lisa Robin Kelly plays the slutty college dropout older sister, Laurie, and the apple of her daddy's eye. Mom and Eric don't buy Laurie's act as daddy's little girl. A lot takes place in this season like Red losing one job and getting another. I enjoy the fantasy scenes where Red and Kitty are in a seventies soap opera or Donna and Eric are Archie and Edith Bunker.

The extra features feature webisodes and behind the scenes of the first season and an interview with director, David Trainor. I was surprised that Lisa Robin Kelly isn't featured prominently in the extras. Since she passed away so young from drugs, she was terrific actress in her role as Laurie. Her replacement couldn't measure up in the role anyway. Her loss is still sad for the fans. The second season featured a Halloween episode where Fez gets to trick or treat.

Donna loses her beloved cat and her parents' marriage is on the rocks as well.  Jackie and Kelso break up and he dates Laurie. Red loses the job at the plant and gets a new job at Price Mart in town. Eric gets a job there too. The men and boys go hunting. The cast and crew do a terrific job and they all look like they're having a ball on the set as well. It's rare to see a show where the ensemble are so together as a team effort. Plenty of memorable moments, I would love to watch it again.",1456099200,,2149,4.737967914438503

It may have been rescanned, but the picture quality looks close to the dvd version (don't get me wrong it always looked great on dvd as well). and the sound seems to go back and forth, when you watch the menu the sound is way too loud and seems a bit distorted the sound in the shows seem level and accurate. While this is a great show, and I personally wish all tv series were on blu ray to fit my collection better, there are times when I wonder if they know what they are doing when they put older shows on blu ray, you figured they'd have a test audience to see what their thoughts were.

You really don't notice, frankly.  And, most of the original music is back in the releases.  If you are wavering on this purchase, don't.

2213997,5,B0007IO6WS,"I have to admit that it was hard for me to believe that ""That 70's Show"" was actually filmed in 16x9 widescreen, but it was.
For the new Blu-ray release, Carsey Werner went back to the original camera films to create these new transfers, not the old analog standard defention 3x4 videotapes that the old DVDs were mastered from.

Not only does this mean a wider picture, but it means a sharper picture with even more detail and vibrant colors! The films were not scrubbed of grain, so it still looks natural like very fine-grained film.

The composition of the widescreen image presents some interesting visuals. Since the producers knew that the FOX Network was going to CROP the image for a square screen broadcast, some shots such as those around the kitchen table or riding in the car are clustered together in the center with dead space on the sides.  Other group shots will add cast members to the sides of the shot who were not originally seen in the FOX broadcast & DVDs.  So purists may argue that the show was composed for the square picture, but I tend to like the widescreen as originally filmed.

I can't wait for the later seasons to get re-mastered from the original widescreen films.

Now if only Joss Whedon will re-release Buffy The Vampire Slayer in the widescreen like it was filmed (the U.K. DVDs were in widescreen 16x9).",1355184000,5,1343,4.621848739495798

2214005,3,B0007IO6WS,"this is a pretty small complaint, but in case you didn't know, the band who wrote the themesong , ""Hangin' Out"" was a group from the early 70's called BIG STAR. For some reason, their music from their 1st record must've held a sentimental place in the hearts of this show's producers. As I mentioned, not only was their song the show's themesong (eventually re-recorded by Cheap Trick members) , but it was often heard at touching, poignant moments of the early episodes (notably on season 2, in the ""Vanstock"" episode, where Donna & Eric are talking in their sleepingbag, but also in Eric & Donna's final scene together on the last episode). The songs are delicate, gentle 70's pop, but very endearing and I've always mentally connected them to this series (I'd bought the BIG STAR CD a month previous to the show's premiere). So, I was REALLY disappointed to see the music removed from the ""Vanstock"" episode!! Evidentally, it was cheaper than giving the band/record company a piece of the DVD profits. I haven't gotten the last season to see if they repeated this travesty again on the scene I mentioned--I really hope not; the music chosen had matched the scenes perfectly and made for a very charming television moment. This magic was lost to me on the DVD of this episode on season 2 as opposed to the original FOX broadcast episodes..",1341187200,,1341,4.7106382978723405

2214007,3,B0007IO6WS,"5 stars for the actual show which is one of my all time favorites and I highly recommend. I kind of grew up along side this show and it remains pretty much the only thing I can watch Ashton Kutcher in without instantly wanting to punch him in the face, so that must be saying something right there.

0 or 1 star for the packaging which is by far the CHEAPEST I have ever seen. Some might notice when searching that there are two versions of That 70's Show Season 1 (and Season 2 as far as I know): one for $15 and one for $40. Now you might be wondering why one is so much more than the other. Does anyone remember the little paper holders that computer restoration discs used to come in or that people made to hold CD's/DVD's because they were cheap and easy to make?? Well that is exactly why one is $15 full price, because the DVD case is simply a holder for these cheap pieces of paper. It's kind of sad that the company could have saved money and plastic by making the outer case smaller since it doesn't support any type of swivel/peg DVD holder and it is simply normal size to make you think you bought a normal DVD.

Basic rule of thumb in all my movie shopping is that the cheaper the price, the cheaper the packaging, and the higher the risk of the disc becoming damaged and needing to re-purchase it. This is especially true with movie bundles and TV series since the manufacturer can cram multiple discs into dirt cheap packaging.

I have also posted this same review for Season 1 because I was so surprised at how pathetic the packaging was when I bought the two seasons together.",1330992000,3,1593,4.285714285714286

And I defintely didn't realize it was as funny, hilarious, and cute as it is.  I by-passed it many times while channel surfing and now regret it.  My son got hooked on it while at the beach this year; staying up until 4am watching a marthon of them.  He asked for a set of DVD's for his birthday so for some reason I got Season 2 instead of starting with Season 1.  It didn't matter.  I picked right up with it since it was the only thing on our television for a week and the more I watched the more hooked I became.  Each character gives so much to the show and is so well acted.

The censors let some things that were very commonplace at that time make it to the air, which is pretty unusual in this PC era. I don't like canned laughter, so I appreciate the fact that it was taped before a live audience. The only season I don't particularly care for is the last one. No Topher Grace, no Ashton Kutcher (not on a regular basis, anyway), Donna had gone blonde (what??) and there was that new guy.. can't remember his name. The show was pretty much finished by then, which is unfortunate, but nothing this good could last forever.

2214038,5,B0007IO6WS,"The second year of That '70s Show took an already great show and completely amped it up (even the theme song got a small change).  Knowing what worked and what didn't work from a very solid first season, the writers and actors were able to deliver a sophomore year that was superior to Season 1.
The year starts off with a true gem; in ""The Garage Sale"", Hyde (Danny Masterson) bakes ""special brownies"" to help out at the Formans' (Topher Grace, Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, and Lisa Robin Kelly) garage sale to raise money, now that father Red is out of a job.  Despite Eric's pleas to not do it, he unknowingly gets Eric's Vista Cruiser sold when Red, Kitty, Bob (Don Stark) and Midge (Tanya Wright) sample some of the drug-laced chocolate.  What follows is one of the shows most hilarious ""circle scenes"" with the parents talking nonsense while under the influence of the brownies.  And that is just the beginning of the season...
This year, a few story arcs develop.  Donna (Laura Prepon) is put through a painful ordeal when her parents' marriage begins to crumble, Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) and Jackie (Mila Kunis) face trying times for their relationship when Kelso begins sleeping with Laurie Forman, Hyde gets a job at the Photo Hut, and we meet Leo (Tommy Chong), a burnt out guy who is the source of so many funny lines.  Eric and Donna take some big steps in their relationship, while Red continues his search for a job.  Finally, Fez (Wilmer Valderama) continues his search for a girlfriend, and hopes that Jackie will be the one for him.
One of my favorite things about this show is the cutaway bits.  Some of the funniest moments this year involved either dream sequences of cutaways to bizarre 70's references, such as when Fez wished that they could be cartoon teenagers, just like in Scooby-Doo.  Next thing you know, the rest of the scene is animated!  Or after Eric went to see Annie Hall with his mom, he sees himself as Woody Allen and Donna as Diane Keaton.
Season 2 had so many great episodes, I still find it hard to believe that the show's been on for 7 years.  One might think that due to all the greatness this show has displayed in the first 2 years, it would have run out of ideas long ago, but it is still going strong.  Anyway, some highlights of the year include ""The Garage Sale"", ""Vanstock"" ""The First Time"", ""Afterglow"", ""Eric and Kitty's Night Out"", ""Halloween"", ""Hunting"", ""I Love Cake"", ""Parents Find Out"", ""Moon Over Point Place"", and ""Burning Down the House"".
The special features are much improved over season 1 (although, most television shows on DVD aren't too strong in the specials department on the first season releases).  We have a few commentaries, some making of features, and a few featurettes.  Also, the episodes seem to be in sequential order throughout the set this time (it seemed as if some of the episodes were in the wrong places on the Season 1 release).  This is a strong set, and I highly reccomend it.",1115424000,25,2964,4.619047619047619

Everything is completely genuine, and nothing ever seems forced.  I have the first set and I loved the packageing and the layout of the menus.  The studio stuck to the exact same format for the second season as well, there are no annoying credits to go throw each episode, and this time around the opening song isn't repeated on every episode, it just goes straight to the story which is really convienant.

The packaging is the same as well, which is a plus,  4 individual  slim cases insted of annoying fold out cases that seem flimsy.  I love That 70's Show, and I love the DVD sets.

2214041,4,B0007IO6WS,"Season two of the hit Fox series, That 70's Show continues on with much of the same coming of age humor as season one.  Much as in season one, the six friends, Eric (Topher Grace), Donna (Laura Prepon), Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), Hyde (Danny Masterson), Jackie (Mila Kunis) & Fez (Wilmer Valderama) hang out in Eric's basement, get high and think about sex.  This season has a couple of running plots including Eric & Donna trying to finally do it and Kelso juggling his dating both Jackie Eric's sister Laurie (Lisa Marie Robinson who becomes a full cast member this season).  Eric & Donna finally do get together in the extremely funny two parter, ""The First Time"" & ""Afterglow"" (which contains a hilarious animated takeoff on Scoobey Doo).  Some highlight episodes include the season opener, ""Garage Sale"", where Red (Kurtwood Smith), Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), Midge (Maude Adams) and Bob (Don Stark) eat some of Hyde's special brownies and Red ends up selling the Vista Cruiser, ""Red's Last Day"" where Red and the guys get drunk at a bar, ""Hunting"" where the guys all go hunting while the girls stay at home and play cards and ""Burning Down The House"" where Jackie tries to make Kelso into something he's not at a party at her house and we learn a secret of Bob's.",1114128000,3,1262,4.671171171171171
2214042,5,B0007IO6WS,"That 70's Show is greatest show on TV.  The show's cast is fantastic and all have great chemistry with one another. Every one of the characters is as hillarious as they are diverse.  The show revolves around the gang of 6: Main character Eric Foreman, his next door neighbor and girlfriend Donna Pinciotti, Best friend and Zenmaster/conspiracy theorist Steven Hyde, the wild and less than intellegent Kelso and his spoiled rich girlfriend Jackie, and of course Foreign Exchange (Z)Student: FEZ.  Other characters include: Eric's parents (who are equally central) Hardass Reginald ""RED"" Foreman and wife Kitty.  Also Donna's parents and Hyde's hippy boss Leo (Tommy Chong).

All of these characters are hillarious and original.  That 70's Show is a character driven show.  To really get addicted to the show you have to get aquainted with the characters to a certain degree.  The show is histerical but it is also about more than comedy.  There is a lot of character development and serious moments over the years.  The show is NOT about the 70's, it only takes place in them, that is one reason why it is so sucessful; it is really timeless in many ways.

Season 2 is excellent and is a huge step up from the 1rst.  The first season was great but this is the year that the show really starts to take off and find it's zone.  The show just keeps getting better from here on out.  Kelso is a fan favorite but he isn't the highlight of the show in these earlier years. The show is revolved around alot of things but the relationship of Eric and Donna is at the center, especially in this season.  The best storyline of them is the episode in which Donna tells Eric she loves him in which Eric replies ""I Love Cake"".  Freaked out about the turn of events he turns to the guidence of his friends.  There are few story's with Hyde and Fez this year but there presence is still central and they are still hillarious. There are great storylines with Eric's parents and Kelso's messed up relationship with Jackie and a new relationship between Kelso and Foreman's sister Laurie.

One of the best aspects of the show is the extreme creativity. Among the best creative sequences include the circle scenes in which virtualy every line is a punchline. And the fantasy's which aren't really a major part until the 3rd year. Other great features are the phycidelic scene changers. Everything about this show is 100% original, that is a huge part of it's allure.

As far as the DVD's are concerned I was a little dissapointed.  First the absence of the original 70's music played between scenes. I understand why they are cut from syndication, because of the price.  But we payed to get the original network broadcasts and FOX couldn't dish out a few bucks!!! The music is important, it gives the show a nice feel of authenticity and many times it provides the central atmosphere.  FOX really slapped their fans in the face.  The special features were also a let down.  What sitcom on DVD has NO bloopers??? There are also no deleted scenes and I KNOW they had some.  The behind the scenes looks are very short and mostly uninteresting. They aren't what you'd expect at all.  Plus there are no interviews with the cast.  Regardless... this set is a MUST BUY for fans of comedy.  That 70's Show is non stop hillarity.

Some of the best Season 2 moments include: Kelso's attempt to cheat on Jackie, Kelso setting Jackie's house on fire.  Red's friendship with ""dumbass"" neighbor Bob Pinciotti.  Hyde's zenmaster teachings.  Foreman's screwing up with his relationship with Donna. The 360 smoking scenes.  The many punchlines of FEZ.  The gang getting into trouble.  Any scenes with Leo. ECT... ECT.... That 70's Show is one of the best shows ever. It is very underrated.  This DVD set is a must own.",1113955200,4,3781,4.684370257966616

8047659,2,B0007IO6WS,"I liked most of season one of ""That '70s Show,"" especially the episodes that highlighted events or culture during the 1970s. The episode where Gerald Ford gave a speech in their town was one of the most fun historical episodes. But toward the end of the first season the show began to focus more and more on sex and dating, was usually tacky in discussing those subjects, and mostly dropped the historical references. I became increasingly disenchanted with the show, and when I continued with season two I was disappointed to find that the trend continued and in fact, overall the show became increasingly tasteless. Why does anyone want to watch a sitcom where every character is mean spirited? The final straw for me came with the episode (can't recall the title) where Eric ran over and killed his girlfriend's cat, and appallingly the incident was mostly played for laughs. If one of my cats were killed, I would be very distraught for a long time, but the girl acted as though she barely cared. You might say, ""Well, that's just one episode,"" but it's typical of the mean spirited nature of ""That '70s Show."" I stopped watching the series after that episode.",1509408000,,1164,4.738916256157635
