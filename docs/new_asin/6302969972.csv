525936,3,6302969972,"""Coneheads"" is a very well made comedy, with Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, David Spade, and Chris Farley. The plot is original, with cone-headed aliens trying to adapt with surburbia, their daughter dating a  human, and trying to decide whenever or not to go home. Rated PG for adult  situations and mild violence.",953424000,3,310,4.9423076923076925
525937,5,6302969972,I could watch this movie over and over. It has the humor most movies don't have today. There was only one problem. There are parts in the  original movie theatre version that are not on the tape.  But I do highly recommend  it!,943488000,6,227,4.232558139534884

526078,5,6302969972,"DVD is widescreen, picture and sound are both great. I'm very impressed by the transfer quality for an otherwise hard to find movie.
This movie is a masterpiece. The acting, writing, directing and pacing are all fantastic. The comedy is dry and subtle, and requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate. My favorite thing about this movie is how fondly it depicts the American Dream, showing an immigrant family rise from one station in life to the next through hard work, budgeting, devotion to family, involvement in the community, and kindness towards neighbors, bosses, customers and strangers alike. It's a beautiful ode to a healthy nuclear family's American experience in the 2nd half of the 20th century.",1498694400,,713,5.155172413793103

While Coneheads is totally farcical and ridiculous to the eighth degree, there is a certain endearing quality to it as you have these alien lifeforms quite literally in this case, adapting to life in a new location and ultimately sacrificing for the very humanistic ideal of happiness.

526597,5,6302969972,"From the creator-producer husband-and-wife team of Bonnie and Terry Turner, the same people behind ""That 70s Show"" and ""3rd Rock From the Sun"", comes one of the FUNNIEST sci-fi comedy movies EVER to hit the airwaves about stranded aliens on Earth who try suburbia (AND, with super-hilarious results, too). This has a VERY similar premise to the 1970s Saturday morning cartoon ""My Favorite Martians"" which is just as every bit as zany and hilarious (or at least in my book anyways, classic old-school Filmation there to me).

The movie zeroes in on married alien couple Beldar and Prymaat Conehead (Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtain, respectively) who decide to settle down on Earth after their spaceship breaks down as they await word from their supreme leader on their home planet of Remulak to send a rescue ship to deliver them. So, in the meantime, however, they decide to work their way up on the American dream with Beldar taking on various odd jobs as a taxi driver, auto mechanic, and so on, while his wife Prymaat stays home, keeps house, and gives birth (in which her water breaks, literally) to a girl, Connie (Michelle Burke), who grows up as an alien, like her parents, but with all the trappings of American family life (going to the beach, ballet dance recitals, high school swim meets). But it's even funnier watching the sparks with Connie squaring off with her parents, who's SO Americanized, doesn't even go off in the monotone ""cone-speak"" like her parents, takes on a tattoo on HER cone, much to her parents' chagrin. Still, however, just like her parents (how the apple never falls far from the tree LOL), she's also got her own wacky alien traits (devouring a Subway in one gulp) while she maintains a romance with an overbearing clod played by the late SNL great Chris Farley. You'll also see numerous cameos by Michael Richards and Jason Alexander (Seinfeld), Sinbad, Drew Carey, Ellen DeGeneres, Michael McKean (Lenny from LaVerne and Shirley) as well as SNL regulars David Spade, Kevin Nealon, Julia Sweeney, the late Phil Hartman, Garrett Morris and Laraine Newman as Prymaat's sister, Laarta.

Say, does this even come with the music video showing Beldar singing ""Oh, You Can't Just Leave Your Cone Alone"" and a spaceship giving off neon lights ""Move it, or park it, Pointy-Head""? Should be on YouTube  LMAO X-D

527048,5,6302969972,"I enjoyed the movie!  The main downside is that they did not include any of the cutscenes which really help the plot.  For instance, the dining hall scene when they first get to Remulak introduces Laarta and her boorish husb... (ahem) geneto-mate.  It kind of shows that Beldar and family are not the same cones that left Remulak and have changed.

I see how some people can diss the movie, it isn't the greatest comedy ever made.  However, at least for me, the nostalgia level and family level comedy more than makes up for it.  This is a movie anyone can watch.  It might even be too much of a ""kiddie"" movie in some ways (simple villains, dumb jokes, little exposition... etc) which might be why some people pan it.

Definitely worth a watch if you need an old film to pass a Saturday afternoon with!",1438992000,,803,4.4520547945205475

Jan Curtain and Dan Akroyd  were fabulous in their comedic portrayal of these beings from another planet who seem to go unnoticed, and fit in with society.

CONEHEADS: It's not just a one-gag movie; actually, they never use the same gag twice. Running gags, however, concern the Coneheads' ability to ""consume mass quantities"" of anything, and their attempts at disguising their skyscraping skulls to escape detection. The flick also contains gently chiding satire of Middle American manners and mores, and a veritable parade of bit parts by standup comics (Sinbad, Ellen DeGeneres, Drew Carrey, Tom Arnold), and comedians from Seinfeld (Jason Alexander, Michael Richards), SCTV (Thomas), and Saturday Night Live (Spade, Farley, Phil Hartman, Jan Hooks, Jon Lovitz Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Julia Sweeney, Tim Meadows, Kevin Nealon, Garret Morris). Aykroyd, with his pop-eyed smile, stilted language, colorful descriptions and whiny, helium-sucking monotone hasn't been this funny since ""Ghostbusters."" It's a fun, no-brainer, live cartoon.

Alas, the movie tanked, so we get a bare bones DVD with nothing but the film's trailer.  From the technical side, the sign is enhanced for 16X9 TVs and the picture is fine.

527519,5,6302969972,"I bought this several years ago when it first came out. For some reason the studio has never offered a Blu Ray version with deleted scenes. There is a whole scene on Remulak  in a cafeteria which was cut from the movie and used to be available on You Tube. I love this movie because it brings back fond memories of live broadcasts of early Saturday night Live shows. The Coneheads and Mr. Bill were so popular that people would often ask the host of parties I attended to turn on the TV so they could watch the skits. You know it's a good skit when it can interrupt a big party ! The movie doesn't disappoint the viewer because it manages to retain the zaniness and off the wall aspect of the original material while providing a interesting story at the same time. I was hoping Beldar would be offering six packs of brewskies and fried Chicken embryos to trick or treaters in the movie but he didn't. No Shell no pest strips and fiber glass insulation snacks either. Still, the movie manages to provide the viewer with many sight gags and funny juxtapositions and the Coneheads still claim to be from France so it's still a hoot.to watch.

Dan Akyroid and Jane Curtain reprise their Saturday Night Live roles as the extra-terrestrial cone-heads.  What could have been a movie disaster is kept afloat by the continual tongue in cheek humor that none of the characters can see.

The movie opens with a bored radar operator watching Star Trek while he oblivious to a real ""space invasion"" that has begun on his radar screen.  When the Conehead space craft drops into New York Harbor, a couple necking on the bench is too busy to see it.  And so on through the over-zealous INS agent "" Isn't that for the Air Force Sir"".  ""Oh sure, until they try to find work, then they are mine"".  Everyone seems to adjust to the Conehead family until the INS agent has his promotion held up and reopens the investigation.

As with other fantasies, the humor is looking at ourselves in a make-believe setting from a non-threatening perspective.  So enjoy and look for yourself - you're in there somewhere!",1390608000,,1027,4.655555555555556

  What starts out as Beldar Conehead having no love for human beings or tolerance and is quite narrow-minded but a great sense of family , has a growth of love and understanding that maybe in today's world, is a lesson we all need to learn.

528536,5,6302969972,"When this film was released in 1993 I was only 7 years old and I can't count the amount of times I have watched this movie since then. Every time it just gives me a nice warm chuckle, yet presents a very good message for the wider movie go'er demographic. Featuring some of the biggest names in American comedy, including the legendary Dan Aykroyd as the main man of the movie, there was no doubting this would be comic gold.

The story focuses around Beldar & Prymatt Conehead who are aliens from another world. Whilst on a scouting mission for planet conquest, they are inadvertently left behind. Whilst waiting to be rescued they decide to adapt to life on Earth and become illegal citizens of America. During that time they have a daughter, are constantly on the run from the INS and try to live a normal American sub-urban life.

Going from the story you are forgiven for thinking that it just sounds like a stupid comedy movie, but the involvement of the great comedy minds are what make this movie work. The adaptation of the aliens into American suburbia is the obvious standout feature of the picture. Beldar (Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Curtin) present a relatively creepy persona of the Conehead aliens, yet what they actually do is present a very accurate idea of illegal immigrants trying to integrate into this suburban lifestyle.

The film is very metaphorical in that respect, as the mixture of the Coneheads culture and ideas with that of Americans is in a sense ""Alien"" and represents that idea we have of immigrants moving to a strange land. Upon the birth of their daughter Connie (Burke) that American culture becomes even more Alien as their daughter is one of them, but not only that, she's a teenager.

Throughout the film there are some genuinely classic moments that have me in tears every time, especially the time when Eldar becomes a cab driver and to hide his conehead he dons a turban. Brilliant in my opinion and I think I will have many people agree with me on that point.",1234828800,4,1999,4.6543909348441925

However, it was decidedly entertaining all the way through, never boring and pretty tame profanity-wise. There were a number of sex remarks and innuendos, maybe to make up for the little profanity but by today's standards this was an inoffensive film. The only scene that offended me a quick anti-Biblical cheap shot right near the beginning of the film.

It's an hour-and-a-half of goofy humor played by the same people (Dan Achroyd, Jane Curtin, etc.) who made this couple famous on television.",1233705600,,772,4.915384615384616

They even have a girl named Connie. Soon, the Coneheads are brought back to their planet, Remulak and Beldar is forced to battle a monster.

Even with their weird habits (sleeping upright), advanced science (high speed lawn mower, super power vacuum cleaner), nuclear flash fire works and odd appearances, they still pull off jokes about typical North American work and family life.  I busted a gut over the alien wife's insecurity about her husband's love.  (She buys a shopping cart full of women's magazines to research relationships.) Good, clean entertainment.

528564,3,6302969972,"Graduating characters from sketches on Saturday Night Live to a feature-length movie is not new; but the timing was fascinating for the big-screen reprise of the family from the planet Remulak.

Released in 1993, it seemed like the period of comedic relevance had passed by Beldar (Dan Akyroyd), Prymaat (Jane Curtin) and Connie (Michelle Burke). But armed with a neat movie tie-in with Subway, cameo appearances by many past SNL cast members and a script heavy in cartoonish skits, Coneheads was clearly pointed in the direction of a fun romp.

Michael McKean and David Spade are the stumbling and bumbling antagonists, in their roles as officials of Immigration and Naturalization Services. There is a good dossage of special effects, but the monster, Garthok, steals the show in all of its low-grade madness.

The main characters may have lost a bit of their edge from SNL, but that isn't the point; Coneheads keeps it light with laughs, while not taking itself too seriously.",1204588800,4,979,5.030864197530864

In 1993 a new Saturday Night Live fan base was already established and it had been more than 10+ years since the Conehead craze. Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin had fully established post-SNL careers, but who knows why they went ahead with it? Regardless of why, Coneheads the movie was very amusing and had a super all-star comedy cast.

Aykroyd and Curtin were solid in their reprising roles and Beldar and Prymatt. The movie made for a more personal/emotional plot which was never seen in the SNL sketches. Chris Farley is great as Connie Conehead's boyfriend. It was though Michael McKean and David Spade that stole the show and provided a humrous take as the antagonist INS duo.

Oh sure, there are parts in the film where people get freaked out, but no one runs away, so the Coneheads actually start to blend in.  When that happens, the Coneheads just aren't as funny.

This film is full of SNL alumni,including original member Garrett Morris,Kevin Nealon and Chris Farley who plays Michelle Burke's love interest. Burke portrays Connie in the film. After a disasterous date with Connie,Beldar finds Farley's character unacceptable. Farley was a member of SNL when this film was made.

528689,5,6302969972,"I suppose I will like any movie that Dan Aykroyd plays in, that's how good I think he is as an actor.  Belder Conehead and his wife crash on planet earth while on a mission of conquest.
While waiting to be rescued they begin to adapt to our lifestyle and have a child. Unfortunately they are being chased by the government who knows something is not quite right with this family.
 After they are rescued and taken back to their planet, Belder is told to come back and destroy planet earth.  Now he has a choice and this is where the heart of the movie is.  I think this movie was good. I didn't like the part where they mocked the Bible and really didn't think they had to put that in, but besides that it was entertaining and Dan Aykroyd stole the show as usual.",1064102400,10,763,4.205479452054795

Spin-off of the 1970s Saturday Night Live skit has the family of cone-headed, robot-walking-and-talking aliens (from the planet Remulak) landing on earth in an unsuccessful mission where they adjust to New Jersey suburban life, and are unsuspectingly pursued by INS agents. Enjoyable family comedy is silly and odd if unexpectedly delightful, with a lot of sight and sound gags, some will go over a young one's cone. Surrounded by the terrific Aykroyd and Curtain (who you can tell perform earnestly) are over dozens of SNL veterans and present cast members. Written by Aykroyd, his daughter, Danielle and younger brother, Peter both give cameos. Running Time: 87 minutes and rated PG for some crude humor.",1056931200,4,1113,5.476744186046512
528691,4,6302969972,"Coneheads is one of the best ""Saturday Night Live"" movies. I was expecting a light comedy but what I got was a whole lot more.
Following a similar plot to the skit, Coneheads is the story about the Beldar Conehead family who crash on earth during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good.
This is where the movie shows its heart. It could have been a movie of comedy bits but by the end, it is about happiness in a stable family, which is quite refreshing in these days of depressing movies about divorces and unmarried couples. It is nice to see Beldar be a father figure to his daughter rather than the ""Let Your Kids Be Who They Are"" mentality of these days. The direction of the film in excellent, setting up many nice visual gags and shots that are very impressive for a comedy film. And at times, the film feels ""epic"" as you see the family on the run from the INS, to moving to the suburbs to returning to their planet.
There are great performances throughout the film and the many cameos are perfect. Look for funny scenes from Jan Hooks, Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, and Garrett Morris. Michelle Burke makes a nice debut as Connie Conehead and I expect to see more of her in the future.
On the surface, this seems like a dumb movie and it has received many poor reviews. But if you sit back and let it take you on an adventure (and if you can keep up with the way the Coneheads use different words for common items) you will be pleasantly surprised.",1045440000,68,1551,4.3517241379310345

528694,3,6302969972,"The Coneheads followed The Blues Brothers and Wayne's World as Saturday Night Live ideas transferred to movies. Coneheads is arguably based on a funnier idea than either of the other two, but for some reason the film it produced was less successful. The idea had already been used for a thirty minute cartoon ten years earlier, and this script is based on that cartoon. The fact that the material has been stretched to thrice its original length shows slightly with some padding material.
Ayckroyd and screen daughter Michelle Burke are fine in their roles, and quite endearing to watch. You might think differently, but for me, Jane Curtin doesn't quite have their charm, although it's interesting to see her develop some of the mannerisms she would later use in Third Rock From The Sun. 23 year old Michelle Burke and 29 year old Chris Farley play the two teenage lovers and Spinal Tap's Michael McKean plays the villain. Surprisingly this casting works. The youngsters appear younger than they are and McKean shows his range.
There is some clever defamiliarisation satire on the American way of life, the English Language, and on immigration policies. This cleverness works in tandem with the silliness of the piece to give an enjoyable, if flawed movie.",1010102400,3,1257,4.962085308056872

There are bit parts with great actors, Aykroyd must have tossed bones to all of his friends.  What I really like about this film is that it's more than a comedy.  The relationship between Akyroyd and his daughter is exceptionally sweet.  As an obstetrician the birthing scene kills me. ""Beldar, I am with cone"", what a riot.",989366400,8,501,4.7011494252873565

7832811,4,6302969972,"RELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Steve Barron, ""Coneheads"" chronicles events when a couple from the planet Remulak, Beldar (Dan Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Jane Curtin), are mistakenly ditched on Earth, during a reconnaissance mission for planet takeover. Their misadventures include: Dodging the INS (Michael McKean & David Spade), moving to suburbia and having a kid (Michelle Burke) and meeting all kinds of colorful people (Sinbad, Jason Alexander, Chris Farley, etc.). In other words, theres a constant string of guest stars that were popular at the time, mostly comedians.

I had my doubts about this movie because I didn't think they could take an amusing 9-minute SNL skit and effectively make it into a film ten times longer. But the flicks funny from the get-go and the writers wisely change settings & peripheral characters so regularly that the story never gets dull.

On the female front theres Lisa Jane Persky as a voluptuously winsome neighbor and the mind-blowing Michelle Burke as the Conehead daughter, Connie (a role that Laraine Newman fulfilled on TV, but she was considered too old for the role in the film at 40). The creators wisely showcase Burkes beauty without resorting to tasteless sleaze. The third act features a well-done sequence on the Conehead homeworld, Remulak.

Critics may have hated it, but Coneheads competently entertains and amuses on several levels.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 28 minutes and was shot in New York City; Paramus, New Jersey; and Cerritos, California.
