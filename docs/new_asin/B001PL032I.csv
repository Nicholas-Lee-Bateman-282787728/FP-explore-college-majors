Gurutej instructs live, in an outdoor setting with 3 students.  She begins with a detailed description of the chakras and how the body and mind is effected when one is out of alignment.  The dvd is chaptered so that you could work with a particular chakra,  however the exercises flow so well together that I see myself  always committing to the entire hour.  Having done Kundalini chakra practices taught by Raviana and Maya Fiennes,  I will say that this practice is a bit less polished.  There is no fancy studio or constant soundtrack.  That being said,  I rather liked the bare-bones feeling of this dvd and felt that the kriyas really made an impact on me.  Some of the exercises were challenging,  but most were able to be modified. I will definitely purchase more of her dvds.  A mat or soft blanket is all that you need.  Sat nam.",1437523200,4,967,4.534883720930233

I did her dvd for mental clarity and had some powerful results and have had some great experiences from this dvd too.  The first time I did this workout for a couple of minutes I felt this complete peace and centeredness which is hard to explain but was incredible.  I find this workout makes me feel more balanced and centered, it's a really great dvd.",1419638400,2,454,4.369047619047619
8333641,5,B001PL032I,"Awesome dvd! I did kundalini yoga a few times in class, but the closest class is 45 minutes drive each way. My teacher suggested Gurutej video for me. Gurutej's video is helping me SO much - the breathing has opened up space in my back - I feel like I'm a kid again. I had been struggling with back pain for so long. I still continue to do my physical therapy, but what helps the most is the belly breathing in conjunction with the kundalini. WOW, I love it. I never thought I'd like video learning, but I was wrong. Gurutej is a great teacher and communicator, you can't go wrong! Just click the CART button now, don't even think about it. Give it a try. xo, Janet",1376611200,6,665,4.203125
