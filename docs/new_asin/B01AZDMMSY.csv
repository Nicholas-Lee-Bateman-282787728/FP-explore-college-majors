8748952,4,B01AZDMMSY,"This is definately a show to watch, but there is an error in the way it is listed. In the language line of the disc information it is posted as only language being Japanese. This is not true. It is a choice of both Japanese and English with the English sub titles.",1346544000,13,264,4.096153846153846
8748953,4,B01AZDMMSY,"It's been a few years since I've seen this, can't believe Amazon still recommends it to me. Me and a friend rented all of them. It was very cute, good for kids (and adults!) The only thing that irked me was the girl Saga. She yells at Sugar all the time, making her very annoying. Yes Sugar can be a bit annoying at times, but I think Saga is plain mean to her at times, even making her run away in a later episode.

 Overall the show was very  cute and a refresher from many disappointing animes I have sat through. There was no lame sex/love stuff (eechi, dumb ""I just met you but I love you"" stuff, etc) since it is considered a children's show. The innocent whimsical fun was MUCH appreciated. Though the whole ""Twinkle"" thing (which you will hear lots about if you watch this) drove me crazy. It's not that I didn't ""get"" it, however I had many ideas-variations of my ideas on the concept but I prefer concrete answers.

So..Cute Show, has it's minor flaws but worth a go!",1287964800,7,977,4.293478260869565
