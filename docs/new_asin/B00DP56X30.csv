The parks are under siege all the time.  I happen to be an old man & would like our youth to see what our predessors did for us.  You can do the same for your children.  As an oldster, I have need for English subtitles on a DVD.  The recorded programs I have have excellent closed-captions, but CCs are not playable on DVDs if you have HDMI hook-ups.  I am in a small minority.  If you hear well, these programs are invaluable. Watch them if you can.  You will not be disappointed.",1389830400,,655,4.209677419354839
