I think this should be called Yoga for Energy and Renewal, since she describes it as helping you hit the reset button. Some of the moves feel like qi gong, where you sweep away the bad, and bring in the good. I would love it if the other practices for complete Mommy yoga (pregnancy and postpartum) were included. Her music is a great motivator, too! Happy, Happy! My toddler even says ""Are you happy?"" after I finished  Thanks, Maya!!!",1527033600,,593,4.390909090909091
8758640,2,B01EGQB6II,"not what i'm expecting, I thought this is a prenatal kundalini yoga dvd.  i love maya fienne's instruction, so i was super excited to hop on it. i found a lot of poses laying on stomach, then i realize this is not for prenatal... i think this is for people before they get pregnant and want to be pregnant, this might prepare you for that.... just not what i'm looking for and the title and the description is a bit misleading",1473120000,,426,4.2592592592592595
