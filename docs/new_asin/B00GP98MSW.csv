he has people who orbit within his eyesight but there is no connection. he loves a dog but will not fill up the water bowl. JOSH is a piece of whiteboard and we just paint our experiences on to his surface. there is no there, there. putty boy",1514073600,,414,4.1234567901234565
8626087,5,B00GP98MSW,"Love, Love, Love this series. Straight, Gay, or otherwise, its a fantastic cast and story line -- the word hilarious doesn't do it justice!",1497398400,,139,4.833333333333333
8626088,5,B00GP98MSW,"This series is one of the most satisfying I have ever watched.  The writing, acting, direction, music are all top notch. So much more development in all areas than most American series of this type. I recommend it highly. One caveat: it is next to impossible to find this dvd outside of Australia, so you will need a multi-zone dvd player. Worth it to buy one to see so much excellent programing from around the world.",1396742400,9,418,4.5
