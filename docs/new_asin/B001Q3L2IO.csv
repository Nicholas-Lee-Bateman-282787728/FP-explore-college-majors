I saw ""Dual Cell"" on YouTube, where it is available, because I did not want to pay ten dollars for the film in case it sucked. After years of purchasing films that are now collecting dust on my shelf, I am getting better at not doing things like that. Now, I will preface this short review - how do you adequately review a six minute film? - by saying that ""Dual Cell"" is incomparable to ""The Exorcist,"" but it is also not comparable to ""The Room,"" either. In essence, it is not bad, nor is it good. It is just okay. I am not begging for the return of six minutes of myy life - it definitely made me think about it even after I had watched it - but I am also not jumping for joy about how spectacular it is, either. I would not go out of my way and recommend it to all of my friends, but I would never say, ""Don't watch this movie; it's terrible!"" if someone were to ask me whether or not to watch it. So, readers, if you want to watch this movie, instead of paying ten dollars for something you may regret purchasing, search it on YouTube. Wanting a return of six minutes of your life is better than wanting a return of six minutes of your life on top of the return of ten dollars of your hard-earned cash.",1306108800,,1347,4.026119402985074
