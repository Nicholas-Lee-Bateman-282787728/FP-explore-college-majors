7800307,5,1605298921,"This is a good workout for intermediate, but uncoordinated exercisers like me. Chris Freytag is on top form here. Her motivation is contagious and her instructions are easy to follow. I like the short sections provided as well as the 8 mins power workout. Good to mix the routine around, especially on days in which you are short on time. I have done this workout several times. It's one of my favorites!",1305763200,2,404,4.625
