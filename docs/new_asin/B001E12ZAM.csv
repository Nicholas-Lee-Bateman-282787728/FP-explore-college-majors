3545199,5,B001E12ZAM,This is a great bargain. $30 for three of the best Monty Python features. With hours of special features there's something here for both the hardcore Monty fan and the Python Noob.,1233187200,12,180,4.65625
3545200,5,B001E12ZAM,"I've been trying to determine which 2-disc versions are in the box for a couple of weeks now, finally found some info elsewhere on the web:

Six-disc set includes ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition),"" ""Monty Python's Life of Brian (The Immaculate Edition),"" and ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (Special Edition).""

I was hesitant to order it until I knew what I'd be getting, and then figured I'd post this, as I may not be the only person wondering.

Now where did I leave that shopping cart?",1232841600,119,512,4.666666666666667
3545201,5,B001E12ZAM,"This DVD set is a MUST HAVE for any of you Monty Python fans. Every movie included is hilarious! I say it's comedy at its best.

For those of you who are offended by religious humor, don't watch. This is for the open-minded only.",1232668800,3,229,4.204545454545454
3545202,1,B001E12ZAM,Amazon should carry ratings and warnings for DVD/video products.  These movies were beyond the R ratings (which were not disclosed beforehand) and should have had an X rating.  What a waste of money!,1232323200,6,199,5.0
3545203,5,B001E12ZAM,"What can I say...Monty Python is so funny!!  I nearly pee myself every time I watch the Life of Brian!  We haven't had a chance to watch the bonus/special feature discs, but it was so good to watch all three movies on DVD -much better than the old VHS we had that it is worn out it's not even viewable anymore!  They honestly don't make comedy like this anymore!",1231891200,4,362,4.217391304347826
3545204,3,B001E12ZAM,"Having seen all three of these movies in the past (and for the most part having enjoyed them) I think it would be safe to say that I am a MP fan.
Given the nature of this comedy,and being a fan of MP humor,I consider myself to be fairly open-minded.

However I am also Catholic and I feel that naming this dvd set ""Holy Trinity"" is out of line and beyond good taste.

The Holy Trinity (Father,Son and Holy Spirit) is the very foundation of Catholicisim. If this set were making a parody of Judaism or any other religon for that matter,I don't believe such a bold title would sit well with most.

Comedy certainly has it's place (we all love to laugh) but there are also other aspects of life that deserve just as much attention. It seems we now live in a time where entertainment takes priority over spiritual values.",1230768000,10,817,4.3618421052631575
3545208,5,B001E12ZAM,Great service and quick delivey. All time classuc movies that I am happy to add to my collection. Must have for any Monty Python fan.,1398643200,,133,4.36
3545209,5,B001E12ZAM,Packaging was great. Delivery was fast. I love having all 3 of together in one package! Wish there was one that included a Fish called Wonda.,1393113600,,141,4.461538461538462

3545215,5,B001E12ZAM,"I had forgotten how the film ""Ends.""  So, for a bit thought that I had a problem.  Then, I remembered the exact same recollection upon first seeing the movie.  Good Seller.  I'll be back.",1376179200,,187,4.411764705882353
3545216,5,B001E12ZAM,We loved the series and wish we could get those on disc as well. These movies are classics to us. These are great comedic additions for our home library.,1359590400,,153,4.310344827586207

3545218,1,B001E12ZAM,"Yes you get all 3 in 1 case,but tbh its a waste as you can get the 3 special editions for close to 40$ (Blu ray edition) 50$ (DvD Edition) Before you spend the 100$ look around and you'll save lots",1333756800,7,197,3.8292682926829267
3545219,5,B001E12ZAM,"I didn't like Monty Python back when; I do now! How do they think this stuff up? This is a great set of DVDs; I recommend it. (I bought more than one set.)

When will Monty Python movies and TV shows be available for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch? I can find nothing on the subject.

Monty Python is classic; it never goes out of style. There is nothing produced of this high caliber these days. MP is rolling-in-the-aisles funny.",1320537600,,428,4.3375
3545220,3,B001E12ZAM,"This is a great item, but incredibly overpriced on Amazon!!  I just bought these for $40 at a major bookstore right down the street.  Usually Amazon is the way to go when it comes to value, but they have struck out on this one!!",1288656000,7,228,4.159090909090909
3545221,5,B001E12ZAM,"Service was great, and the movies came in excellent condition. Love the dry humor of Monty Python...you have to watch one of the movies several times to catch all the hilarious details!",1285718400,,185,4.8125
3545222,5,B001E12ZAM,"I wanted to see why those movies are the ""cult"" ones.

3545248,5,B001E12ZAM,"Box art is amazing, all three movies are packed with their respective special features disc, and you get three awesome Monty Python movies to add to your collection.  I still have yet to see ""The Meaning of Life"", but that's really my fault.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase as a Monty Python fan.  If you don't own any of these movies, I recommend the buy.  Totally worth it to me.  ^_^",1265155200,,396,4.36986301369863

3545254,5,B001E12ZAM,"It's hard to believe that the Python's work was over thirty years ago.  It's still so fresh, irreverant and funny.  Whenever we need comic relief, we put on a Python video and are never disappointed.  I honestly don't know how they did it.",1238716800,2,239,4.511627906976744
