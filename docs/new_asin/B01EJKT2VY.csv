8758929,5,B01EJKT2VY,"Did not know what to expect, I'm glad though that I ended up purchasing this.  It's is such an unusual script and plot. The casting was on the dot, the camera work, dialogues, editing, above all the performances stand out. The girl a bit did the overkill but every other actor nailed it.  The grandfather was the winner though. You can't really predict what will happen in the movie, the screenplay keeps your interest until the very end, this is one movie that was worth every minute.",1499040000,,485,4.563218390804598

8758933,5,B01EJKT2VY,"The ensemble cast is superb with a special shout-out to Rishi Kapoor for his excellent portrayal of the grandfather.  Although the plot is sometimes painful, it does hold true to this family and its friends.  I recommend the movie.",1473292800,2,231,4.897435897435898
8758934,5,B01EJKT2VY,"This was a good movie.  It's about family drama but the plot line was compelling.  I don't know where the movie was shot but the scenery was very nice.  I don't know any of the actors but all of the performances were really good.  Having said that, I did think that the young woman maybe over did it a bit trying to play the part of a ""hip bohemian.""  It was good nonetheless.  It even addressed a topic that is very controversial and not addressed very often in India.  It was well done without being preachy.  Well done.",1469923200,3,522,4.255102040816326
8758935,5,B01EJKT2VY,"Interesting movie. Not what I was expecting at all. A great look into a typical desi family. Nothing is what it seems and that is awesome. Good movie. I love that it shows how a family is day functional by their own secrets and that in times of need , we need to find a way to pull together and put our ego aside.",1469404800,3,313,3.90625
8758936,4,B01EJKT2VY,Wish soundtracks were like the movies of the early 2000's but the story is terrific.,1469232000,2,84,4.666666666666667
