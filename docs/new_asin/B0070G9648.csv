Aradia teaches a cute Saidi step combination.  And I really enjoyed Jamileh teaching style and now would jump at the chance to take a workshop from her! She teaches a cute combo for a drum solo.  Paulina and Celeste have have some interesting combinations as well.  And if you are looking for some unusual drum solo combinations, Dondi  teaches two that are not only interesting but also challenging.  Her teaching style is as fun and inspiring on this DVD as she is in person! You will certainly get your money's worth out of this DVD!",1365292800,,1109,5.7607361963190185
