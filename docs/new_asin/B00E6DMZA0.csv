5893300,5,B00E6DMZA0,"Glad to have a second set of young people's concerts by Leonard Bernstein.
Accompining book would be nice to have.",1390694400,2,114,4.75
5893301,3,B00E6DMZA0,"Leonard Bernstein did 53 young people's concerts.  Kultur has now released the long awaited second volume.  However between the two sets they have included 52 of the 53 episodes.  Yes, frustratingly they have omitted one episode!  The missing episode is one dedicated to Copland's operetta for children, The Second Hurricane.  This is an episode of particular historical importance since due to the close relationship between Copland and Bernstein, there is no doubt that Copland was involved in some capacity in this rarely performed work, even if it was only as an outside adviser.  I would love to know the reason for this omission!  It's kind of like buying a box set of the Beethoven quartets only to find that they omitted one quartet.  Except you can't buy another label's edition of these programs.  So annoyingly frustrating!  I'm giving the this outstanding set of programs 5 stars but but give Kultur 0 stars for issuing an incomplete set.",1390262400,23,950,4.993630573248407
5893302,5,B00E6DMZA0,"Though, by 1960, I was in high school, I remember watching NY Philharmonic maestro Leonard Bernstein (pronounced Bern- STINE) present his hour-long concerts for ""Young People"" on CBS-TV. The episode I most remember is ""What is Jazz?"". Here was a well-known orchestra conductor explaining it in simple language - with a bit of humor. (I seem to remember an episode on ""Humor in Music"" where I was introduced to ""Til Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks"". I'm told that both of these episodes are on the first volume of shows from Kultur - though I haven't seen that volume.

THIS volume with 27 (!) previously unissued shows (wonder where they found them) is wonderful and - honestly - I'm only partly through the set (it runs almost 27 hours - though, since the commercials - remember this was CBS - have been excised, each episode runs only 52 minutes), but learning something new in each episode.
The shows (the series ran from 1960-72) are from videotapes in black and white. The camera work is wonderful, showing not only Bernstein and the individual players in close-ups but the young (and old too) audience members in Carnegie Hall where the programs were recorded.

The DVDs are indexed so that you want watch a full show or chose a particular performance. Many of the episodes have a theme : ""Forever Beethoven"", """"Liszt and The Devil"" and ""Aaron Copland's Birthday"" (with Copland in attendance!"". But there are none ""Younger Performers"" programs, with ""stars of the future"", though I have to admit that the only name I recognized is pianist Andre Watts.

These programs are like a time capsule and this was apparent in the most interesting episode (so far) titled ""Unusual Instruments, Past Present and Future"". In 1960, when this was recorded the ""synthesizer"" had not come into popularity and the Theremin was considered ""new"". The ""future"" composition that Bernstein and the orchestra perform is a ""Concerto for Tape Recorder and Orchestra"". This is followed by another concerto, this time "".. for Kazoo and Orchestra"".
The 9-DVDs are accompanied by a 20-page booklet which provides the list of compositions, performers and date the show aired. I don't know if there was an essay about the show, it's origins and impact, in in Volume 1, but there is no such info in this volume. It might have been worth repeating in this set as well.
For those who remember the series as children - or young adults - this is a great way to revist those days. For parents who want to introduce classical music to their children, this is a wonderful vehicle due to the 52-minute length and the communication skills of ""Uncle Lenny"", who does not talk down to the children but ads some humor to his commentary.

Thanks to Kultur for discovering these ""new"" episodes and making them available with good images (they really are) and great sound (better than I expected). And this is a must-have for every school music department.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

(Because of the Dec 2013-March 2014 winter's duration, I also got volume 1 !!) I never mind snowy/homebound days when I have can give myself a special treat like this!

I watched the first concert....and was delighted! Maestro Bernstein is personable, presents well and I enjoyed his enthusiasm in sharing music with children....he doesn't ""talk down"" - he SHARES his love and enthusiasm and musical knowledge with you in a totally enjoyable way.",1400457600,5,677,4.991150442477876
8601982,5,B00E6DMZA0,"I waited *years* for the second volume of Bernstein's Young People's Concerts. You can see my review of Volume 1, as well. I finally watched all the programs of this set, and it is a great complement to the first one.

We're very lucky to have these documented records of one of America's greatest talents in the golden age of TV. He was a force for music and music appreciation - charismatic composer, concert pianist, conductor, teacher, and writer. In every program, Bernstein is passionately engaging, informative, and lucid. He shows you why he loves classical music, why others love classical music, and why you can love classical music, too.  These are experiences to share.

The 52 concerts of both sets may be divided into the following categories:

- Music theory & forms (ex. what is a sonata?  what is a concerto? what are modes?)
- Featured composer (ex. Aaron Copland, Beethoven, Shostakovich, Hindemith, Mahler, Sibelius)
- Young musician performances (see below)
- Analysis of famous classical works (ex. Rite of Spring, Also Sprach Zarathustra, Symphonie Fantastique, The Planets)
- Exploring music genres (ex. Latin American, Folk, Nationalism, Impressionism)
- Orchestration and the sound of Instruments (ex. Old instruments, the sections of the orchestra)

What has been said of Vol 1 may be said of Vol 2, with the one difference that Vol 2 contains the majority of young musician performances (see below).

If you're new to classical music, you'll acquire a basic understanding and vocabulary from which you can branch out on your own.

If you're already a lover of classical music, you'll derive much pleasure from the remembering why you love this music and seeing famous artists when they were kids. Artists such as: Edo de Waart, Lynn Harrell, Andre Watts, Lawrence Foster, Gary Karr, Seiji Ozawa, and many many others.

Then, if you haven't already done so, check out his Omnibus programs and his Norton Lectures at Harvard.",1397779200,8,1951,5.052959501557632
