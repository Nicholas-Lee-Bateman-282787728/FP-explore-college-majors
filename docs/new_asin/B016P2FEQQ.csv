8736978,5,B016P2FEQQ,One of the best series I have seen.  You quickly learn all of the quirks of the characters and feel that you have known them for a long time.  Every show has two or three stories going on that gets you hooked on the outcome.  Wish there were more seasons to watch!,1472169600,2,264,4.038461538461538

8736980,4,B016P2FEQQ,"Short final farewell season of only eight episodes.  Still has all the gritty day to day drama of life in the Canadian arctic. Still, change comes to Buffalo Airways.  This was the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things.  From the rampies who prep and load the planes in subfreezing temperatures. To the pilots who navigate their planes through fire storms and blizzards, smoke and fog.  To the mechanics that keep the ragtag fleet of aircraft operational.  And to the management that keeps on top of all the insanity to provide air service to the ends of the earth.",1456012800,4,579,4.808080808080808
