785686,3,6304114605,"Released in 1965 and directed by Robert Day, ""She"" is an adventure/fantasy starring John Richardson, Peter Cushing and Bernard Cribbins as Brits in Palestine immediately after WWI. They decide to make a risky desert trip to the legendary desert-city of Kuma in Northwestern Africa after obtaining a map. Once there, they meet the immortal She Who Must Be Obeyed (Ursula Andress) and her High Priest (Christopher Lee). Havoc ensues.

I was surprised at how dull ""She"" is considering the adventurous plot and the great Hammer cast. The flick starts out promising and the journey through the desert is good despite a partially lousy score, but as soon as the protagonists are taken captive and, later, arrive to Kuma the movie becomes set-bound cheesy with interminable dialogue. Some of the talk about immortality is interesting and Ursula is stunning, but these positives can't pull the movie from its unrelenting dullness. The 1968 sequel with Olinka Berova is actually significantly better (albeit not great or anything).

The movie runs 106 minutes and was shot Negev Desert, Israel and England (sets).

785879,5,6304114605,"Great Sixties nostalgia! Takes me back to my adolescence when I first saw this gorgeous and exotic fantasy film in an elegant old movie theater, and I was thoroughly entranced by it then! So glad to find it again!

I do smile with a sad wistfulness to remember how this film seemed so ineffably beautiful, so haunting to me back in 1965, as I watch it now with more critical, jaded adult eyes. It casts a less powerful spell over me now, but fortunately it still evokes much of that old enchantment. The musical score is still amazing, even if a bit overused in places, particularly during the long desert trek. Ayesha's theme is one of the lushest representations of feminine beauty ever written. And as someone else mentioned, the echoing trumpet call is THE perfect theme for any lost civilization!

The stars Ursula Andress and John Richardson seemed like the two most beautiful human beings on Earth to me back then - like gods! It's amusing now to learn that their spoken performances were so bad that Hammer Productions had to dub over their voices - Ursula's Swiss accent was so strong that she was unintelligible, (Ursula was also dubbed in the James Bond *Dr. No*), and John's delivery was so monotone and boring that it sounded like he was reading a dull legal document (which explains why the incredibly handsome Richardson's career never went very far).

Ah, but the magical craft of cinema overcame these limitations and created this fantastic illusion that will always enchant the young teenage boy inside me.",1431475200,2,1524,4.787072243346008

The theme music is famous (two main themes - desert journey and She herself) and the journey through the desert ""on location"" to the lost city is great. The eventual too-obvious set work takes some suspension of disbelief that younger audiences may struggle to overcome, but it's still a great adventure classic. Some good morals in here for those whose goal is to seek fame, power and glory and perhaps even a woman with the beauty - and jealousy - of Ayehsa - Ursula Andress! John Richardson is fine as the hero, and great opportunity to see Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee together who are excellent in their roles.",1422835200,,793,4.705035971223022

785963,4,6304114605,"Any movie with Peter Cushing cannot be bad, and the appearance of Ursula Andress as a 1000-year-old goddess can only add to the proceedings. Bernard Cribbins is his usual witty self, but John Richardson has done better as the hero/leading man. He has the choice between the blonde (but cruel, selfish) goddess who murdered him in an early incarnation, and a dark-eyed, dark-haired beauty who is vulnerable and mortal (and tragic, as it turns out). What happens to the secondary female almost ruins the movie for me, but her fate is part of the tragedy. Leo Vincy (Richardson) cannot seem to chose between the two women and what eventually happens to him is probably what he deserves.

This is supposed to be a bigger-budgeted entry for the Hammer Studio, and its lavishness shows on the screen. If you like fantasy, then definitely add it to your collection.

786035,5,6304114605,"A great deal of Ursula Andress' performance is owed to Monica Van Der Syl who re-dubbed all of her dialog.
The story has been filmed many-many times (this remains my favorite version).  It's an adventure, part road trip, as three hapless idiots cross a desert following a map that looks more like a bad painting (they're also aided by a fancy ring and a delusional visitation with a really-really old lady).  It's a sad, cautionary tale of a scorn lover who kills her boyfriend then lovingly preserves the body in a box until she can get her hands on his reincarnated duplicate centuries after the fact.  John Richardson plays the look-alike sap willing to risk all to be with the woman who already killed him once.  (She even saved the fancy blade she stabbed him with as a souvenir!)  If that's not love, what is?  Naturally, things do not go smoothly as another woman falls in love with the sap.  Heedless to say, all hell breaks loose as the sap in question just cannot keep his lips to himself (prearranged ownership belonging to SHE who must be avoided).  Yes, there's a moral: careful what you fish for.

This movie also stars the incomparable Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  Poor Lee has the misfortune of ending up wearing a gold beehive hat with a crown on top (talk about overkill!), and yes, his dignity suffers for it.

For a DVD-R format, it's a nicely preserved piece of 60's kitsch.  Glad to finally have it in my collection.",1400112000,2,1445,4.6015625

And why would Ayesha have been white?...perhaps I should read Haggard's book.
Andress is sort of harsh-cute, and there are a couple of shots of her floating in people's dreams in a faintly erotic way.
But her acting is plain awful. I read somewhere that another voice had to be dubbed in , due her strong accent. About as beguiling as a bucket of cockles.

French actress Genevieve Page was working in English by about this time, and she carries off the Beautiful haughty conniving role so well elsewhere.

Richardson....ploddy. Cushing, wonderfully distracted and superior. Cribbins...under-rated, as always. This show needed more of his clowning.

Fair SFX. Bizarre costumery...?Romans?
There is one scene, where Cushing encounters the chamberlain/high priest in a chamber containing the remains of his predecessors...and a chilling reminder that that is the fate of all, ultimately. The only real bite in the whole show.

Well, Ursula Andress as everything I remembered-beautiful and imperious and every bit the goddess she was made out to be. Her male lover, Leo Vincey, was even more spectacularly handsome than I had remembered. The movie itself, was not so. Much of the movie is a very long drawn out showing of the trip to the lost city. There was little or no attempt to recreate the lost city. The love conflict between the slave girl and Ayesha(She) was not well sketched out.

The purse strings have been considerably loosened for SHE, and the resultant film, if not quite an epic, is still lavish enough to be thoroughly entertaining. A great story and some fine acting effortlessly carry the weight of the film.

 At loose ends in Palestine at the end of the great war, Major Holly (Peter Cushing), his valet Job(Bernard Cribbins) and fellow soldier Leo Vincey(John Richardson) become involved in a search for the lost city of Kuma, with its promise of eternal life. Peter Cushing is wonderful as the mature voice of reason wrestling with John Richardson's obsessed, driven character. And Bernard Cribbins adds just the right amount of light humour. They make an attractive trio of adventurers. On the distaff side, Ursula Andress as SHE is well cast. Her impassive icy beauty works well as the cold-hearted, omnipotent ruler. In contrast,smoldering Mexican beauty Rosenda Monteros, as servant girl Ustane, provides the heat, desperately in love with her Leo. A wonderful performance from her. Hammer stalwarts Christopher Lee and Andre Morell round out a fabulous cast.

Partially filmed in Israel, this widescreen, colour production is a treat for the eyes. The special effects are a bit wobbly at times, but that shouldn't distract from this hugely enjoyable fantasy adventure. A treat for young and old alike! Enjoy!",1332806400,2,1500,5.139344262295082

Finally, a Reg. 2 edition was released, however soon after Warner Archive released their edition, and having become familiar with the quality of their on demand work, I realized my Reg. 2 would not suffice as it had many imperfections including a large scratch from the beginning and washed out color.  Hammer went all out with their re-make, and later repeated their success recipe with another re-make of ""One Million B.C."" starring Victor Mature which became in 1968 ""One Million Years B.C."" and made a star of Raquel Welch.  The original ""She"" with Randolph Scott and Helen Gahagan had made the mistake of transferring the setting of the book from Africa to the Arctic.  Both Hammer films mentioned co-star the handsome John Richardson who was featured in the sequel to ""She"" but the flame of youth eternal shone brightest upon him in 1965 as he was cast opposite Ursula Andress as Haggard's ""She Who Must Be Obeyed.""  Oxford University Press in the publication of Haggard's classic novel have Andress gracing the cover.  With a screenplay by David T. Chantler, a fine score by James Bernard and photography by Harry Waxman, Hammer made a smart choice also with Robert Day as director as he had experience on Tarzan adventures.  This is the definitive re-make, an original of sorts since Hammer made the impressive sequel, ""Vengeance of She"" in 1968 with Richardson and an exciting new personality Olinka Berova, but it was as with the new adage of re-makes and sequels that the original is always better.  Olinka never got past this landmark.  1965's ""She"" transports the imagination to a fantasy world deserving of rich color, music and sequences and Warner Archives's treatment does it justice.",1321315200,4,1787,4.93

786198,3,6304114605,"This film is one I saw often as a child in the 70s on tv.  Ursula Andress is stunningly beautiful as ""She: Who Must Be Obeyed.""  Her acting chops as the Egyptian princess banished to the desert Kingdom of Kumer are not as impressive.  A campy performance by Christopher Lee (later Count Dooku in Star Wars) as Bilayly the High Priest of ""She"" is a highlight.  Peter Cushing turns in a sterling performance as the Professor.  The weakest part of the film is the acting of the male lead, John Richardson as Leo, ""She's"" reincarnated lover.  His acting is wooden and amazingly he seems to have no chemistry or sexual tension with Andress.

The plot is set in the Middle East in 1918. Leo is discovered by ""She"" or ""Aiesha's"" agents and lured to Kumer by the ravashing ""She.""  Leo and Cushing and a man servant venture across the desert.  When they finally encounter ""She"" they find her regime at Kumer depends upon slave labor, fear and brutality.  Although ""She"" offers Leo immortality it proves a curse.

The film is vintage fun, although a bit slow by modern standards.  Clearly the budget was spent on the star's salaries as the sets are horrendous.  When ""She"" shows Leo a supposed ruined Egyptian city, it's a model made apparently by a four year old.  Also modern viewers will be shocked by the racist depicions of the dark skinned Africans (?) with bad plastic wigs.  The novel that ""She"" is based upon is part of the ""Orientalist"" tradition of literature and the film neatly recaptures much of its racism. Despite these flaws, ""She"" is good old fashioned low budget entertainment.",1290816000,,1586,4.675090252707581

786272,4,6304114605,"I don't know if SHE was the most expensive film Hammer ever made but it sure looks like it. Of course it's not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA or ZULU but it does try to cash in on those two films at a fraction of their cost (and length). In addition to Ursula Andress in her prime (in fact ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" is the role she was born to play), we get Hammer stalwarts Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee both giving really strong performances especially Cushing who is unlike any other character I've ever seen him play in a Hammer film. John Richardson, who starred with Barbara Steele in the iconic BLACK SUNDAY back in 1960 and would be opposite Raquel Welch in ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. the following year, makes for a strong and attractive Leo Vincey. The different ending (from the book and other versions) gives the film a surprising poignancy you wouldn't expect.

H. Rider Haggard's novel of an ageless queen and a forgotten city has been filmed many times starting back in the silent era and as recently as 2001 but only this one and the 1935 RKO version have had any kind of staying power. Comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges. One is in B&W, the other color, one is set in the Arctic, this one (like the book) is set in the desert. The '35 version has tremendous art deco sets, Nigel Bruce, and the legendary Gustav von Seyfertitz. Helen Gahagan was regal as SHE but Andress is exotic and very desirable. While the settings here aren't nearly as lavish, they were influential and this version was a favorite of countless impressionable minds during the 1960s including future filmmakers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. This Warner Archive edition stops short of a full restoration but the widescreen transfer allows us to see SHE in all its glory.",1271376000,10,1769,4.598101265822785

This movie has been unavailable in dvd format, and kudos to Warner Brothers Archive Collection for finally allowing us the pleasure of seeing this the way it was meant to be seen - the picture and colors are superlative and even help justify the hefty pricetag that comes along with it.

786290,4,6304114605,"Hammer's 1965 version of She can't match Merian C. Cooper's 1935 version for spectacle but it's still rather more handsomely mounted than you'd expect from the studio: location shooting, numerous sets and more extras than usual even if these descendants of Ancient Egyptians seem to have an army consisting of Roman legionaries. The most commercially successful adaptation of `the famous novel by H. Rider Haggard' (as the credits bill it), even inspiring a dreary sequel, The Vengeance of She, it's also surprisingly good, with rather more substance than you might expect.

Played partially as an old-fashioned adventure with far more action than any other version, the story is updated to post-WW1 Palestine, its explorers (Peter Cushing, John Richardson and mild comic relief Bernard Cribbins) now reimagined as demobbed soldiers uprooted by the war. ""She who waits"" is introduced into the picture surprisingly early and long before they reach her domain - here it is Ayesha herself who urges Leo to make the hazardous journey to prove that he is the reincarnation of her lost love. The second half makes more of the battle for Leo's soul, with more of an argument made against the temptations of eternal youth than in other versions, and the film goes to much darker places than its predecessors: this time Leo is lost long before the blue flame appears, and the end remarkably bleak. Being Hammer it also ups the sadism, not only in a mass execution of chained slaves but in the manner in which one character is `returned' to their family.

With Haggard's novel touching on the worship of beauty and youth above character or even basic humanity (She is so in thrall to her image of a lover that she blames herself for his infidelity) it's actually rather fitting that both leads are dubbed: Ursula Andress because of her thick accent - but then, no-one ever cast her for her voice - and John Richardson because, well, with his zombie-like vocal delivery that made him the Clive Owen of his day, acting never was his forte as long as he had the looks to get away with not having to. It's left to the bearded Peter Cushing's Holly to provide the weight of authority and make the case for growing old gracefully, which he does with effortless professionalism, while Christopher Lee's ambitious high priest Bilali is a far more interesting and less blindly devoted character here, adding another layer of moral decay to the crumbling kingdom. The production design makes a virtue of its relative economy, Kumar past its prime and on the edge of rebellion, the lost city itself long crumbled and the kingdom retreated into the very mountains, though the fact that the sets are smaller than they look and shot with long lenses to look larger is occasionally given away by distortion in some of the panning shots thanks to the still far from perfected Scope lenses. The special effects, though not always photo-realistic, are rather good in their old-fashioned way while James Bernard's score features a particularly memorable desert trek theme. All in all, one of Hammer's finer hours, and still highly enjoyable.

Warner/Canal Plus' Region 2 PAL DVD boasts no extras but an acceptable widescreen 2.35:1 transfer, though the title sequence looks somewhat faded.",1197763200,6,3260,4.956124314442413

Ayesha believes that one of the Brits, Leo Vincy, is the reincarnation of her former lover, who she killed in a jealous rage a thousand or so years earlier.  (Ayesha is immortal.)  There is more to the story, and in fact it all makes for a pretty good yarn.

It is he that the story is centered on. For Leo is the object

of desire for the beautiful and undying Ayesha, eternal queen of the lost city of Kuma. A fabled city who's wealth and

power and greatness surpassed that of even Egypt itself.

 Ayesha believes that Leo is the reincarnation of Kilicrates.

Essentially, Ursula Andress (who is also in the fantastic epitome of the rainy Sunday afternoon stalwart...'Clash of the Titans'), is the Queen of a strange forgotten land who has lived for centuries due to a life giving fire, and who awaits the re-incarnation of the lost love she murdered centuries ago in a fit of pique, and this transpiring only then to be thwarted by the intervention of the jealous high priest (Christopher Lee). The book on which the movie is based is somewhat less Hammy (if you'll pardon the pun), but still the whole film has a certain class and if you like Hammer films, it is one of the best.
The ending is what makes it though...the special effects here are not so much sophisticated as downright terrifying and as a youth gave me awful nightmares for a while afterwards...didn't stop me wanting to see it again though as soon as I could.

A blonde vision of incandescent loveliness that can but only fill our hearts with indescribable longing. Yes, we are talking about actor John Richardson. He plays war veteran Leo who is first seen watching a belly dancer with his ex-pat chums. He is eyed up by the servant girl of Ayesha, whom we meet in the next scene and is played by some actress called Ursula Andress. This servant girl immediately and understandably falls for the astonishing Mr Richardson, who is the only man in the world who would still look good in a mullet. After a brief flirtation with whats-her-name, Leo and chums set off for a hazardous desert trek to find the lost city where she hangs out. Leo looks stunning throughout, although half dead from injury and thirst. In a delirium he sees a vision of Ayesha with outstretched arms saying ""come to me, Leo!"" I know just how she feels. I mean, he feels. He must find her, but instead he is caught and is tied to two posts by some natives who need a human sacrifice. With shirt torn open, muscles rippling and blue eyes flashing like mesmerising rare gems, Leo thrashes his head from side to side as the spears get closer, closer! The bongo drums play louder as he sweats and writhes. My God, how much more of this Adonis....I mean, suffering can we take? Luckily he is rescued by soldiers from the lost city and laid to rest in bed for a while. His chest is incredible, even the hairs seem to be made from the golden fleece. Suddenly we cut to Ayesha heaving in her bed. Yes, yes, but let's get back to Leo. Later, they are both re-united on a balcony over looking the lost city and Leo is dressed in white silk with an open chest. Oh God, why did they leave out the whip? Ayesha expresses undying love and Leo's chums decide to leave. Disgraceful! They can't leave Leo in the hands of that...that...women. But fate plays a strange hand and the true message of the film emerges. It is better to resist the monstrous regiment of women and discover the true meaning of love and loyalty, that is the kind found when hanging out with one's chums. Leo is left an immortal, his beautiful face and taught, proud, sinewy body of a stallion doomed to stay young forever. I'm sorry, this is a tragedy? It's the happiest moment of my life.

The 1935 edition has them trekking through a glacier and this one through the African desert to get to the lost kingdom where SHE resides. Both renditions have some really cheesy scenes. But the story is glorious reminding me a little of Lost Horizon. I will be perfectly clear. I bought this to gaze at Ursula Andress in the prime of her beauty. Her voice is beautifully dubbed because she could not speak English. My disappointment is they did not display her beautiful body to immortalize her on film, the way they could have (I am not talking nudity); let's just say she was conservatively dressed.
