8317850,1,B001LDROZE,"Here is EXACTLY what this is:

1) Someone takes the DVD ""The Beach Boys- An American Band"" which is a great documentary type film with songs and interviews through the years.

2) They edit it to remove all the interviews and just retain the songs (complete or not).

3) During their DVD transfer the audio input is too loud so a distorted sound is recorded.

4) They distribute this rip-off to cash in on the ""Beach Boy"" Name.

I can't get any more accurate than that.

This deserves NO stars but that's not an option.",1239667200,24,518,4.4
8317851,2,B001LDROZE,"If you think you are buying a collection of live performances of The Beach Boys from various stages in their careers, which is the impression one gets from the packaging you will be disappointed. Some pieces are performed live but many others are the boys on various T.V.appearances lip-synching to the music. For the die-hard fans there are some filmed performances from their 1969,1970 and 1971 period when they performed live backed by a small horn section. If anybody was lucky enough like me to see their live act during this era of the band's history, you will wish like I have for years, that hidden somewhere, in some vault, is a complete live set with a good sound track documenting this incredible time in their performing career. What a find this would be because this is when the band was a tight oiled machine performing obscure songs with crisp musicianship and spot on vocal harmonies from the Smiley Smile album right on through Surf's Up. This was before they were held hostage in later years to Mike Love's insistance on staying locked in a timewarp of surfing and car songs. The best we have is The Beach Boys live at Knebworth, which is a pretty good concert with decent sound but it was filmed a decade later in 1980 when Mike Love reigned supreme, Brian was a bloated zombie and Dennis was already on his descent into heavy drinking and drug use that would have it's tragic end in the cold winter waters of a California yacht basin.",1238889600,10,1454,4.617760617760617
