8494434,5,B0067R3LMO,"Great documentary. The story follows animal families and communities in Yellowstone park, a nice variation on many Yellowstone Doc's that focus on geology. This is a fun, easy watch full of cute and enduring moments. The narration is informative and easy to listen to. The ecosystem and animals lives are so interconnected - It's so incredible to see how so many individuals interact and depend on each other. Otters are shown frequently and are so cute!",1501286400,,454,4.9868421052631575
