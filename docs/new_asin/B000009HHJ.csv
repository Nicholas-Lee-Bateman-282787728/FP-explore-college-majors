8508276,2,B000009HHJ,"I saw this film in the theatre on a Chow yun fat film festival. I found the film very amateureshly written. I know action films suspend belief, but this was ridiculous (a woman gets shot in the head, but dosen't die for  about 7 minutes, chow recieves over 30 bullet hits in the filnale, but  survives.) The story itself was intriguing, but the gun battles were ver  outlandish, and out of place (shing fui on's demise is particularly  laughable). I can take many stupid violent films of the eighties  (AMerican"" Lethal Weapon, HK: Tiger on beat), but this one goes too  far. It should have stuck with it's story, and not tried try solely to live  up to the better tomorrow body count. Danny Lee has a particularly good  cameo.",932688000,3,727,4.538461538461538
