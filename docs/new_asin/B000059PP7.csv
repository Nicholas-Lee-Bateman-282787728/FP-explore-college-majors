1408384,4,B000059PP7,"I remember seeing this film in the theaters when it was first released over 20 years ago (1986) based on the TV review by Siskel & Ebert. But I couldn't remember if it was a documentary or a fiction piece. Now that it's on DVD from First Run Features, it was time to revisit it.

As I realized once the film started, this is a totally scripted film using unknown actors. The writer and Director is feminist Lizzie Borden and the lead female character, Molly (played by the best actress in the film - Louise Smith) is a lesbian turning male tricks. So the women have more interesting lives than the men characterized in the film. The budget was low and there wasn't much that could be done to improve the quality of the image. I guess it fits the mold of the sexploitation films of the 1970s.

There really isn't a plot to speak of. The day starts, some of the hookers come and do their shift. Others call in sick and some work ""OT"". And then the day - and the film - ends and everyone goes home!

I made it through part of the commentary with Director Borden, the Director of Photography and one of the actresses. But, I can't say it added much.

It's still an interesting film to watch from a sociological angle to see the various reasons the men come to have their fantasies fulfilled. And you will get a glimpse as to how boring it must be to be a hooker as well as learn what the current ""prices"" were in 1987.",1188518400,,1414,4.245353159851301
1408385,4,B000059PP7,"First - for those who may be confused a bit - this is NOT the Melanie Griffith / Harrison Ford movie - Working Girl !!!!
This film, by independent filmmaker Lizzie Borden, caused quite the stir in it's day. When first released, on a very limited basis, it was hailed for it's true-life, non-glarmorus dipiction of prostitutes.
The film has aged fairly well. The fashion, however, has not <G>.
The story follows Molly, a working girl, on a day in the life sort of journey.
The filmmaking is sparce, but effective. This is no ""Pretty Woman"", nor is it intended to be. We're presented with a Big City Brothel and it's employees. There's nothing fancy or particularily beautiful about them - though some of the ""girls"" are attractive.
The main point, I believe, is that this is a JOB. It's a harsh reality look at what some women do for money. It's not slicked over and it's now over-drawn, the film presents prostitution clearly and, more importantly, without judgement.
The script is on the money and a good script is always a good place to start.
There are no exotic locales - we're mainly invited into the brothel - an upper class condo/apartment. It's a bleak sort of existance.
I'd recommend this film to the Independent Movie lover. It's one of the first and finest examples of what a limited budget, a good script and a good director can do.
Recommended.

1408386,4,B000059PP7,"Working Girls (not to be confused with the singular and singularly awful Mike Nichols movie that features Melanie Griffith vacuuming a carpet, nakedly) is an easily underestimated accomplishment, and despite the rampant nudity and unblinking depictions of adult sexuality, a guaranteed sex-deterrent.
It's hilarious, embarassing, grim, deeply disturbing, cynical, touching, clinical and creepily locker-room-intimate, all at the same time.
There will be those people who can't make it past the low budget  vibe that (admittedly) permeates the whole movie, but anyone who criticizes its occasionally stilted acting (and it's an easy target) misses the point: it's PROSTITUTION. Which is to say that paid sex is possibly the root source of all bad acting. Even having said that, the performances are deceptively understated in their squirmy, quasi-nude ease.
The characters of Lucy and Dawn especially, are horrifically too-true. I walked around mimicking Lucy's idiotic ""What's new and different?"" for weeks. Dawn's gum-snapping hostility, and her impromptu James Brown imitation (""Good God, Mollie- you're a whoooore!"") are as grating as they are winning. Singling these two actresses out is unfair though; their characters are especially dynamic, given that they're essentially opposing ends of the same spectrum of self absorption.
Even the least likely supporting roles are realized with unexpected complexity. Witness Lucy, the house's madam, reprimanding Mary, a mousy new 'girl' for her unappealing wardrobe choice on her first night on the job. When Lucy reminds her condescendingly that she is to dress as though she ""just came from lunch with her mother, and is on hew way to meet her boyfriend for drinks"", Mary replies in a small voice, with a discomfiting mixture of stubborness and shame, ""This is what I  wore.""
Possibly the most remarkable aspect of this movie is the realization that prostitution, at least at this elevated level (the 'girls' work in a clean, modern apartment, and schedule 'appointments' through phone ads listed mostly in upscale skin magazines) is just another daily grind, a job, plain and simple. Ellen McElduff's Lucy is every thoughtless, self-absorbed boss you've ever wanted to throttle; the difference is that she's seen you naked, and can talk about your sex life with no legal repercussions.
That's glib, of course; each of the 'girls' is seen to struggle with the work, and what it means in a larger sense, politically and personally.  Finally though, just as it seems uncompromisingly grim, the film sneaks in a remarkable twist. It's essential to watch to the very end of the closing credits though, or you might miss a moment that offers a lovely moment of reassurance, and tender domesticity.",988243200,22,2742,5.342592592592593

WORKING GIRLS: They prefer to be called working girls. A small but classy apartment in a fashionable Manhattan district is home for this small business that employs a number of ladies of the evening (and of the afternoon). Molly (Smith), a lesbian on the verge of 30, does it to support her career as an artist. Dawn (Goodwin), a chesty blonde bimbo with an attitude problem, is putting herself through college. Gina (Zach), swarthy and sweet, knows no other life. This Day In The Life of a House (as in of ill-repute) takes us from nooners through the night shift, allowing us to sit in with the girls (who range from nervous first-timers to jaded old pros) as they see customers of every type: young and old; shy and arrogant; white, black and Asian; good, bad and ugly.

Discussion: Admit it: If you work for a living, you're selling your bodyor at least renting it. Its the same for these hostesses. Its just a job. They work their [expletive deleteds] off (literally) for Lucy (McElduff), a fussy den mother full of house rules who still denies she runs a [expletive deleted] house, rather than a nice place where nice people meet each other. They sit around the living room, waiting for their appointments, chatting and griping about the boss, the job, their mates, and life in general, just like at any office. They have pet names for all their regular johns: Fantasy Fred, Honeymoon Joe. They share insights and tips (One good thing about this job is that Ive completely lost my fear of men, they all agree). And we sit in with them, eavesdropping on their sessions, sharing their secrets. There is plenty of drama in the interactions, along with a plethora of practical details.

This fascinating film is just too matter-of-fact (and often too damn funny) to be erotic, obscene, pornographic or even very titillating. Its more akin to a documentary, in which everything you ever wondered about prostitution is revealed, stripped of all mystery and glamour. In the end, sex to these working girls is just another day at the office.",1423008000,,2294,4.673267326732673

7933922,4,B000059PP7,"I'm just so amused that 15% of people found themselves in the wrong place and went off and bought that piece of crock featuring Melanie Griffiths and Harry Ford.  Wrong choice people!  But in truth, this is worth a look but I wouldn't say worth spending much money over.  The soundtrack is by Adele Bertei, however, and that IS worth paying for.",1309305600,,345,4.532258064516129
7933923,5,B000059PP7,"Lizzie Borden's ""Working Girls"" excels at giving us a fascinating slice of life and insight into the lives of women working in ""the world's oldest profession."" The cinematography and choreography are good; but when you watch this you can tell that the film was made on a shoestring budget--the sets aren't exceptionally complex. Then again, however, the sets don't really have to be anything terribly special to tell the story and get the message across that prostitution is a daily grind for these women who aren't always all that happy to be ""working girls.""

First off, we quickly meet Molly (Louise Smith), a lesbian whose partner doesn't even know she's a prostitute for men in a high class apartment bordello. Molly, like the others including Dawn (Amanda Goodwin) and Gina (Marusia Zach), must see one man after another all day long, pleasuring them all by indulging them in their fantasies and more. Their boss Lucy (Ellen McElduff) is a selfish, mean spirited tyrant who always manages to throw things in ""her girls'"" faces in order to make them do whatever she wants such as working much later than planned with no advance notice.

The plot isn't really the reason you should watch this. Instead, see this for the insight you'll get from a slice of life film that pulls no punches about prostitution even when it's framed within a superficially genteel, well-kept apartment in which women service male customers for as much money as they can get every day. The interactions between Molly, Dawn and Gina are particularly interesting; and we see what happens when two new women join Lucy's ""girls.""

The DVD comes with some extras including photo stills and a very good optional running commentary that goes with the feature film.

Overall, fans of cerebral, gritty dramas that also deal with social issues will want to add this to their collections; and anyone studying prostitution would do well to get this, too.",1308700800,5,1923,4.925925925925926
7933924,4,B000059PP7,"The Bottom Line:

Working Girls is a fairly slight piece of filmmaking depicting a day in the life of an upscale 1980s bordello; it's never especially compelling or transcendent, but it's unexploitative and features many interesting scenes that just manage to make it worth recommending.

7933925,5,B000059PP7,"A 1986 independent film which won a Special Jury Prize the following year at the Sundance Film Festival, was written, directed, produced and edited by Lizzie Borden and centers on three women who are working in a Manhattan brothel.

With a documentary feel to chronicling a day in their lives, the main characters are a struggling Yale graduate, a college student who has dreams of becoming a lawyer and one who is trying to accumulate enough money to start a business.

What is captivating about the movie is Borden's story-telling technique; the women are as much psychologists and mothers to the men, but the danger is real when they cannot control every moment of an encounter.

Based on a number of interviews with women and research which spanned six months, Borden presents a real portrayal of a profession which conjures up instantaneous opinions, which may be totally inaccurate.",1218758400,,888,4.986486486486487
