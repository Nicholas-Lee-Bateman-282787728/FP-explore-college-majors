8516652,3,B007HDOZSG,"While this instructional DVD set was interesting, it was not very helpful. It lacked heavily in the ""instructional"" department. Starting out by a fast paced demonstration of a large section of the form then ""breaking down"" the steps. Very little detail is given about proper form and is just shown very quickly, too quickly to follow along with. It is also presented with only one camera angle, so you never know if your angles are correct or if your butchering the forms.",1523923200,,472,4.7682926829268295
