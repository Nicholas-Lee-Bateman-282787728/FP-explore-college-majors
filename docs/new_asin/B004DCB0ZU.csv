4332035,5,B004DCB0ZU,"This is a wonderful DVD set to watch with your kids now and be able to share your memories with the ones your kids are forming today.

This is a collection that just lets you watch how 40 years of talented people can make great television.

If you were looking for a set that celebrates only the old show from the 70's, you need to look at the title.  This is a celebration of 40 years of Sesame Street and not the first 10.  Elmo has been around for 25 years in his current incarnation and has clearly been the favorite character for the last 20, so he should get more air time than minor characters who were on the show for a fifth the time. Go order ""Old School"" DVDs if you just want early episodes, and don't rate this DVD based what you wanted versus what it said it was, a compendium of ALL 40 years, not new old episodes.

So, if you just want a great sampling of why Sesame Street is beloved by generations, this is the perfect DVD.  There's a little something for everyone to smile about.",1260403200,6,998,4.171875
4332036,5,B004DCB0ZU,"This collection is awesome.  Since its just a collection of their best clips from each season, it is very entertaining for both my kid and me.  Lots of great songs and classic skits.",1259712000,,182,4.484848484848484
4332037,4,B004DCB0ZU,"What a fantastic dvd combo, Who could forget Mr. Hooper's Store. This brings back great memories when i saw how young Bob and Louise were. And Kermits News Flash , forgetful Jones . Sesame Street 40 years of great television.",1258588800,,225,4.65
4332038,3,B004DCB0ZU,"This DVD set was nostalgic and at times almost brought tears to my eyes.  For those parts (The ladybug picnic, The pinball counting to 12, the cartoon typewriter, the cast iron ""I"", etc) I would give it ten stars.  Sesame Street literally shaped my life as a young child.  I watched it religously until age seven (I'm thirty-five now).  The reason for my three star rating is because of the lengthy songs and dull skits, which unfortunately took most of the time.  Leena Horne singing didn't do it for me at five and she especially doesn't do it for me now at thrity-five.  Sorry, but same to you Diana Ross.  I wanted to see more of the aliens (""yep, yep, yep...nope, nope, nope""), Bert and Ernie, Super Grover, and the Tiddly-winks (who were suspiciously absent).

Watching this DVD made me realize how they should now call Sesame Street, just plain Elmo's World.  That's who it's really all about now anyway.  I loved the good old days when ALL the characters received equal billing.  Now it seems like the first forty minutes of Sesame Street is just filler until Elmo, the big star, shows up.  Don't get me wrong, I like Elmo, and so do my three little ones, but all the other characters have their own personalities and ability to teach as well.  This DVD is a reminder of that.

So CTW if you're reading this, I would buy every single episode of Sesame Street from 1974-79 if you put it out on DVD.  Stop teasing us with these short DVD releases showing only clips.  To those of you who are thinking of purchasing this DVD set, I would get it, it is worth it.  You're sure to see something that will bring back a memory.",1258502400,207,1627,4.4425675675675675
4332039,2,B004DCB0ZU,"I am/was a fan of Sesame Street, was born in 1971 and followed much of the show up until about 1980.  As the Old School sets were released, I purchased them, and although they are not perfect by any means, they are a great look back at much of what made the show so magical.  When I first learned about this DVD I was a bit hesitant thinking it would be repeating much of what is shown on the first 2 ""Old School"" sets, but because there were some segments that I felt the Old School sets were missing(The ""O"" song, Lowercase n and a few others), I thought I would give it a try. Well, sad to say, the first disc 1969-1989 is basically the best of the old school dvds crammed into one disc, sure there are some ""new"" segments, but much more that I would like to forget (Mr. Hooper surfing in Hawaii...was his back really that hairy?..some creepy Televisionmonster thing). So...if you are a fan of the Old School Sesame, then stick with the Old School sets, and skip this one. Hopefully they will eventually release complete seasons so we get to see ALL the good stuff.",1258329600,28,1068,4.308457711442786
4332040,3,B004DCB0ZU,"First, a proviso.  I love Sesame Street.  Love it.  Or at least, I loved it from when I was a child--from its inception until approximately 1980.  So, I write this review with a heavy heart.

Second, I was always looking for the Old School content on this DVD.  I would rather Elmo and the post-racial rainbow kids had never been invented.  Roosevelt Franklin, writers who met social, racial and class conditions head-on, the music of Joe Raposo--this is what I wanted.

How disappointing.  There is a minimum of new material from the Old School DVD collections.  And Joe Raposo's name is not even prominent (is it even mentioned?) in the book that accompanies the DVDs.  I'll have to read it again, but Jon Stone is fronted and Raposo is definitely in the background.

Anyway, I'll just have to keep hoping that the marketing gurus at Sesame Wallet Project see fit in the future to release our childhood memories more systematically and completely.  We trusted you.  Now give us back what we invested in you!",1257897600,48,1009,4.724137931034483
4332041,5,B004DCB0ZU,"I grew up with Sesame Street, and now that my kids are 1 and 3, I'm falling in love with Sesame Street all over again.  This is a fantastic DVD!  It's literally packed with wonderful songs (like the Lady Bug Picnic), ABCs, counting, story time - all the things myself and my parents loved about the show when I was little.  My son's favorite characters are Ernie and Bert, and some of the stand-alone DVDs I've bought for him over the past year barely mention them.  With over 5 hours of Sesame Street on this set, Ernie and Bert get a little more screen time.
It's a good value too - the individual DVDs are ten or more dollars for 30-45 minutes, and this HUGE set is only 20.  I'm very happy with my purchase.",1257811200,81,711,4.237037037037037
4332042,5,B004DCB0ZU,"If there was a person raised on Sesame Street, it was me. I was 3 years old when Sesame Street first aired on TV. I don't recall much before the age of 3 but I do recall Sesame Street.

Every day my mother put it on our Montgomery Ward, black and white 13 inch TV and we watched and sang along. After I grew out of Sesame Street I would revisited it while babysitting my cousins. Then again, when I was in my late teens, while getting ready for work, I would occasionally put it on. We didn't have cable and there was nothing on beside the news. So, I would go back to something that was comforting and comfortable. With 13 channels you didn't have much of a choice back then. However, when my son was born and I had all the choices in the world, 180 something channels and all the VHS and DVD tapes a child could ever want, I still put Sesame Street on for him.

Why? Well, easy, it was something I respected. Something I knew he would love and something I could deal with. I have always felt that too much TV is not the problem for children. It is what they watch, and Sesame Street for me has good morals, is educational and entertaining. We still watch it everyday at 7:00 a.m.

When we received the DVD set in the mail I was so excited to show the kids. We watched it in two days.

In A Nutshell: I loved sharing songs I remember with my kids. They were surprised at all the songs I knew. What I also liked and appreciated was how fast Sesame Street moves along. Back in the 60's the colors weren't as vivid the effects not as eye catching but this DVD is fast paced. Basic Sesame Street logic, keep things moving and colorful and kids will watch.

The set also comes with a book full of colorful photos and journaling about the inception of Sesame Street and behind the scenes which were really fun to see.",1257811200,14,1812,4.180515759312321
4332043,5,B004DCB0ZU,"I am so glad I bought my Sesame Street 40 Years of Sunny Days.  I just happen to be the same age, 40 to be exact, as the Street.  This is the best title ever released of Sesame Street.  It has footage, most of it, that does NOT appear on either of the Old School volumes.  Two discs seems like small potatoes, but they're chock full of classic footage.

If you're a fan of Sesame Street, grew up with it, or just want the cream of the crop from the Street, buy this DVD package.  Not only is it a classic collector's item, but will remain so for years to come.  The Street has come this far, and they're no end to it.  God bless Jim Henson, Frank Oz and the other geniuses that created this show.

In closing, come with me for a romp down Sesame Street, and a waltz down memory lane as well.  That's what this is all about.",1257811200,46,823,4.0246913580246915

I personally, feel as if its a pittle dated the new modern sesame street is waayyy better in several ways to me. However I was born in 96 which may be the reason why I could really care less for these older skits making up this dvd collection. I think my daughter will learn wayyy more with the year 2010+ so if you come across that collection let me know",1514505600,2,532,4.174757281553398

4332089,4,B004DCB0ZU,"I do have one minor problem with this DVD set- it is not closed-captioned. I myself am not hard of hearing, but I did want to simply read some of the lyrics of the songs, just for fun. I turned on the captioning on my TV set, and there were no captions. Nor is there a ""language"" menu on the DVD set to activate any captioning, either. The carton makes no mention of captions, either. So if your audience is hard of hearing or deaf, you may want to skip this DVD set. It's a shame it's not closed-captioned, which is pretty surprising, for an educational DVD.",1512432000,,559,4.233644859813084

4332170,5,B004DCB0ZU,"We don't let the kids watch much TV. But the little they do watch is relatively disheartening, and I've been searching for something better. I was watching an episode of Scientific Secrets for Kids Who Thrive, and professor Vishton mentioned that Sesame Street is still one of the very few shows for children that was developed by educators who took into account the latest research about childhood development. Lots of shows, DVDs, etc., put on an educational faade, but Sesame Street was the real deal. Well, why not, I figured.

It wasn't a hit at first with my kids, which discouraged me. But then it started to catch on, and now it's actively requested. It's massively un-hip and horrendously dated, but those tunes, those loveable characters, those guest stars - what a piece of work. And you can see the kids absorbing the lessons despite themselves, hungering after the numbers and letters and life lessons and absurdity and humor. I watched SS only very fleetingly as a child, but the whole family is loving it now.

I just wish it was 12 hours long - it'd last an entire year that way.

It's a fun way to get to know Sesame Street if you don't already, and I use some of the clips when teaching. I have also given it as a gift to friends with young children, and it has been a huge hit with all of them. I personally enjoyed seeing all the old school clips I remember from when I was a kid, and I delight in newer ones such as ""Case of the Missing M,"" which is a parody of Law and Order, or Cookie Monster eating fruits with Matt Lauer on a mock TODAY show episode.",1391817600,,643,3.992248062015504

4332205,4,B004DCB0ZU,"I grew up watching Sesame Street like most of the people my age (28).  We purchased this set for our daughter's first birthday and I watched it with her.  I loved seeing the stuff from the early years and I recognized a number of the songs and animations from the time period when I was a daily viewer of the show.
I wish they had included longer pieces of material.  I realize it's 40 years worth of a show, but I would have happily paid a little more money for a larger collection of material - it's all packed onto 2 DVDs with very little bonus material.
I would have liked to see some behind the scenes stuff with Jim Henson and the rest of the Muppeteers, like what is on the DVD of The Labyrinth.
Mr. Hooper had already died by the time I was born but I must have seen old re-runs of the show at some point because I remembered the character.  It's very touching to see that Big Bird still has the drawing of Mr. Hooper in his nest, I hadn't noticed that until recently.  Sesame Street has always found ways to teach, entertain and help kids understand weighty issues, I think the way they dealt with the death of Mr. Hooper and the hurricane that destroyed Big Bird's nest were poignant and appropriate - I admit, both made me cry.

In all, it's still a great collection well worth the price, I just wish there were longer clips and more of them - maybe for the big 50th anniversary of the show they'll expand upon this set.",1365033600,6,1431,4.242647058823529

4332209,5,B004DCB0ZU,A trip down memory land and a way to catch up with artists and performers from the years I missed viewing before I had my own kids!  This set is an awesome resource for preschool children through about age eight.  All the original Sesame Street characters are represented and the more recent additions are included too.  You'll love it as much as your kids because it's one of those rare sets you won't mind watching over and over again WITH your children.  There are so many sunny days that it takes awhile to get through them all anyway!,1358985600,,539,4.469387755102041
4332210,2,B004DCB0ZU,I bought this for my pre-schooler thinking it was various full episodes of Sesame Street.  Perhaps I missed in the fine print that this is merely clips of various segments throughout 40 years.  It seems to be more focused on clips with famous guest starts than it does actually teaching the young viewer..... and many of the clips are with people whom my child would have no clue as to who they are.  I'm very disappointed in this.,1357603200,,431,4.5

4332214,5,B004DCB0ZU,"Being someone who was raised in the late 80's, early 90's this had a lot of my Sesame Street in it.  When I was a little kid and now as an adult I especially like the slapstick scenes most.  Like Ernie harassing Bert.  Or Grover as a waiter messing up Fat Blues orders.  It
was always nice how they were humorous for the adults while they were educational for the kids.",1350432000,,369,4.154929577464789

Elmo comes out a lot and it has good music with great artists. Its one of the best distractions she has...she watches it over and over and doesn't get bored.",1346112000,,295,3.774193548387097
4332216,5,B004DCB0ZU,"I thought this was an excellent product for the money! For me, as well as many others, we knew exactly what we were paying for (you really expected 40 complete seasons for $20? That's 50 cents a season... come on.) This is basically the 'best-of'... there are 2-3 segments from the first 40 seasons of the show. My kid absolutely loves it, and if you feel like watching it with them but are interested in any historical facts or tidbits, there is a special feature to turn on the pop-ups facts while you watch. (Which kids will decide if they want to pay attention to or not, but I think they're cool. Like now I know that Big Birds birthday is Nov 2nd!!)

As far as the episode of Mr. Hoopers death, the adults explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper is not coming back, ""Just because."" It's not scary - it is sad, though. But death is a part of life. They don't say ""he was old"" because children think their parents are old, and they don't say ""he was sick"" because children get sick and their friends get sick all the time. ""Just because"" was good for Big Bird to hear. All in all, for $20 this is 2.5-3 hours of good entertainment for the lil ones... and admittedly, I liked it too. :)",1343692800,17,1185,4.243362831858407

(spoilers end)

I do have one minor problem with this DVD set- it is not closed-captioned. I myself am not hard of hearing, but I did want to simply read some of the lyrics of the songs, just for fun. I turned on the captioning on my TV set, and there were no captions. Nor is there a ""language"" menu on the DVD set to activate any captioning, either. The carton makes no mention of captions, either. So if your audience is hard of hearing or deaf, you may want to skip this DVD set. It's a shame it's not closed-captioned, which is pretty surprising, for an educational DVD.

I was also disappointed that some of the segments I remember most do not appear on this set (""The Telephone Rock"" song; ""The Word Is No"" song; ""Elmo And The Lavender Moon"" song; ""I'm A Little Airplane"" song; ""Monster In The Mirror"" (Celebrity version); Elmo's ""Imagination"" song; ""The African Animal Alphabet""; ""I Don't Want To Live On The Moon"" song; ""Under The Street"" song; etc.) But I realize that an entire collection featuring EVERY segment ever produced might be about 12 discs and 60 hours long!

I think they include pretty much all the popular ones here; not everybody has a TV memory as good as mine! But I'm hoping that CTW will someday release a Definitive ""Ultimate Fan Collection""- that would be great.

Until then, we'll be more than satisfied with this memorable, very well presented DVD set.",1342656000,174,14761,4.626386233269598
4332218,5,B004DCB0ZU,my 3 year old grandson LOVES this video....so glad that i fell upon this at amazon....classic and up to date...it is great!,1337904000,,123,4.636363636363637
4332219,4,B004DCB0ZU,"The first disk brings me back to my childhood, and I remember some of the skits. The secnd disk is the newer stuff, and includes great musicians and songs tailored for kids. Very entertaining and enjoyable.  It is good practice for older kids who already know numbers and letters, but I wouldn't expect a child to learn the alphabet from it, as it just does one randome letter at a time, etc.  But it is definitely great for all the reasons we love Sesame Street! Each skit is short and sweet. The songs are very catchy, and I often find myself singing them throughout the day, but since they are sweet songs, not annoying, it just makes me smile. I think my 19 month old is too young for it still, but he will get more out of it when he is older.",1329350400,,747,4.216783216783217
4332220,5,B004DCB0ZU,I would recommend this not only to those with kids but to those who grew up on this legendary show...a dvd chronicling the first 40 years of Sesame Street is definitely something to have in your collection.,1326499200,,206,4.594594594594595
4332221,5,B004DCB0ZU,Wonderful sampling of Sesame Street skits. We don't have tv where I am so my parents got my 3.5 y/o son this collection and has never been so engaged in watching something. I would definitely get this for your young child I do wish it was a bit longer but I will probably be getting those other classics Sesame Street DVD's (hope they get the 80's ones out since that's what I grew up with),1325462400,,390,4.213333333333333
4332222,3,B004DCB0ZU,I thought that this was all the episodes complete and it isn't. It is just a couple bits from each season. There are no full episodes and as far as I have gotten through so far there is no segments on the characters just being on Sesame Street and interacting. So far it is all the little cartoon bits that Sesame Street had. But it is still a decent DVD for the little ones and is something that will entertain them. Not a horrible DVD to own. Just not what I expected so I am a little disappointed.,1324512000,2,500,4.112244897959184
4332223,5,B004DCB0ZU,Don't waste time reading my review just buy this essential collection before the world economy collapses and you lose your chance.  Preserve this for future generations!,1323820800,,169,5.5
4332224,5,B004DCB0ZU,"Simply, both my kids and I love this awesome collection! The mix of old and new episods are great. Totally worth the cost and recommended for all generations..",1323648000,,159,4.714285714285714
4332225,5,B004DCB0ZU,Love this. One of the best purchases I have ever made. It is so great to be able to relive some of my best memories...,1323216000,,118,3.76
4332226,4,B004DCB0ZU,"I purchased Sesame Street: 40 Years of Sunny Days as a birthday gift for my 2-year old grandson - I had hoped to introduce him to Sesame Street and the wonderful characters his mother enjoyed as a child.  Although he had seen Elmo in live shows and had a number of Sesame Street themed books, he had not yet watched television.  Unfortunately, I enjoyed Sesame Street: 40 Years of Sunny Days far more than he did.  His only question was ""Where's Elmo?""  Unless a vignette contained Elmo, my grandson was not interested in watching the DVD.

If you are purchasing Sesame Street: 40 Years of Sunny Days for the nostalgia factor, you will be very pleased with this item.  If you are purchasing this for a child whom you hope to introduce to Sesame Street, you may not be pleased with the purchase.  In light of today's technology, the older clips seem quite antiquated and ""homemade.""  Some of the scenes containing famous actors/actresses/singers are just plain bad - the jokes are trite, the dialog stilted, and the topic unappealing to a child of the 21st century.  While charming 40 years ago, they no longer seem relevant or fun.

I rated Sesame Street: 40 Years of Sunny Days as a 4-star product because I have fond memories of the show and the characters it introduced.  If my grandson was rating this, he would probably have given it 2 stars - but, he's only 2 so his vote is being disregarded for purposes of this review!",1322697600,7,1427,4.578740157480315
4332227,4,B004DCB0ZU,"This is a good set, I brought it for my 2 yr old who just completed the baby can read program. He loves it. He likes the first 20 more then the second 20 but everyone is different. I think I will purchase the full old school set for him shortly. A lot of classics here from my childhood. its a Good beginners set to gauge what your child enjoys more the new style sesame street or old then you can direct your future purchases toward the era they enjoy. the Educational value is high since my son was only mildly introduced to numbers after mastering letters. Now (still 2) he can count to 20 with John John. Thnx pbs =)",1322438400,,620,4.132231404958677
4332228,4,B004DCB0ZU,"As a product of the 1980s ... I grew up on Sesame street as did many before me and it is a great show for kids. Of course I stopped watching that show in my early teens and now that I have a kid of my own I am re-grouping and it's almost a shame to see what it has become.

So I decided to acquire a lot of the older stuff for my kid to watch ... and she loves it much more than the new stuff ... but this dvd has old and new items ... kinda like the best of both worlds and it's quite entertaining.

More importantly, the kiddies will enjoy it while you could rest back and say ... hey I remember that!",1314576000,,603,3.703125
4332229,5,B004DCB0ZU,It was Great! Watching the DVD with my 1 yr old son was a great experience even for my self. It reminded me of my childhood days with Sesame Street. I sang along with most of the episodes. I couldn't beleive that i remembered most of them. Glad i can pass it on to him. He Lovessss Elmo. I rate it 105 percent if i can. :),1313366400,,322,3.8208955223880596
4332230,5,B004DCB0ZU,I ordered this DVD set here on Amazon for my 12 month old. He is now 17 months and still watches it like everyday! HE LOVES IT!! There are alot of songs and fun clips in this set. And they are all short clips so it keeps my son's attention VERY WELL! But it is jam packed with fun songs both old and new. Gets 5 Stars from us!,1313366400,,326,3.739130434782609
4332231,5,B004DCB0ZU,My only complaint is that they didn't put Grover's secret song in here. Other than that it was a joy to watch. I love this show! It's a great show to watch and enjoy with your children. I highly recommend this dvd to anybody that wants to feel like a kid again. Children will enjoy this dvd too.,1303603200,,295,4.103448275862069
4332232,5,B004DCB0ZU,"My 16 month old got this for Christmas last year and it was worth every penny! It is such a great compilation of some very memorable moments on Sesame Street.  I enjoy watching it with him so much!  He loves it so much he even carefully gets it out of the case, puts it in the DVD player, brings me the remote, does a dance, and asks for ""Elmo, Elmo, Elmo!"" The songs are great, and as always, it has the high educational quality that we all expect (and appreciate) from Sesame Street.",1303257600,,485,4.204301075268817
4332233,5,B004DCB0ZU,"I love watching this with my son. He loves the same segments that I loved as a child. Honestly, how many tv shows/movies can 2 generations enjoy?

It's also fun to see Sesame Street before too many ""cooks"" got involved. Having segments cut because of public pressure is just silly in my eyes. If I don't want my son to watch something, he won't watch it.

My only complaint is that you can't skip to the menu. You have to watch the feel good commercial about PBS/Sesame Street EVERY time you watch a SS DVD. Do you know how many times I have watched that thing? I can recite it, in Whoopi's voice, in my sleep.",1303171200,,610,4.25

4332235,4,B004DCB0ZU,I am an American living in Norway and bought this for my 2 year old so that she could hear more spoken English. Her and I both thoroughly enjoy watching these DVDs. It is so fun that she enjoys a show I grew up watching. This is a good mix of old and new skits and songs. It is nice to see that kids can be entertained by shows that are not animated and they actaully might be learning something also.,1297641600,,401,3.962962962962963
4332236,1,B004DCB0ZU,"I ordered this DVD set thinking that it was seasons 1-40. It is not! Each season has a few segments from a few episodes. It is not like a normal season set, like disc one...episodes 1-7. This DVD set has about 3 segments per season. Not what I thought it was at all...I was really bummed out, I got this for my one year old son to start watching. Nick JR it is.",1295654400,8,361,3.958904109589041
4332237,5,B004DCB0ZU,I am very glad we got this DVD for my daughter who is 15 months old. It is so much fun! It gets her attention for a long time.

When ever I am at my mom's I put this on for her and we both enjoy it. She loves all the songs and in my opinion the ""old"" Sesame street kicks the ""new"" sesame streets butt!! It has wonderful songs like ""rubber ducky"" and ""the lady bug picnic"" and lots lots more. Mostly songs!!! Which is nice for the children. It also comes with a lovely little book for older kids and grown-ups that talks about the puppeteers. My mom remembers all the old stuff because I was the youngest of 4 we all watched sesame street growing up. It is great to share what I remember with my kids.

Educational and fun!!!! Trip down memory lane, great sentimental value.",1287964800,,794,4.089743589743589
4332240,4,B004DCB0ZU,"I LOVE all things Old School Sesame, because I'm a nostalgic mommy.  I love almost all of the clips on the first disc.  I remember SO many of them!  But I was a bit annoyed when I realized that many of the clips are already on at least one of the Old School DVDs; furthermore, many of the clips aren`t even presented in their entirety; they are VERY doctored.  But what bothered me the most was the inclusion of Mr. Hooper's death in the middle of the disc.  Quite without warning.  I felt a bit panicky as I thought, Okay, now I am going to need to answer some questions.  I remember that episode from when I was a kid.  But this is a DVD that I bought for my kids, and everything is cheerful and happy and then suddenly...BAM.  Couldn't CTW have added that as a ""bonus feature"" so that parents could discern the time to show it to their kids?

Next comes the second disc...except for the first little bit, it's crap.  Destiny's Child on Sesame?  Yeah, let's take some of music's sleaziest girls and let them sing with Elmo!  Great idea.  And then there's the oh-so-politically-correct female Muppets, ALL of whom are so annoying they should be immediately retired - Zoe, Rosita, and now Abby...OH, the HUMANITY!  CTW seriously wonders why female Muppets don't catch on?  Well, why do they all have to whine?  MUST they all have these high-pitched, whiny voices?  Prairie Dawn's voice didn't sound like nails on a chalkboard.  UGH!",1285632000,5,1432,4.5234375
4332241,5,B004DCB0ZU,Just a great CD to share with your new baby.  It should bring back many childhood memories of learning the lessons of Sesame Street.  (It is fun to note that the Cookie Monster has learned to eat Veggies as well as cookies.),1285459200,,224,4.309523809523809
4332242,5,B004DCB0ZU,"I love this DVD set and my daughters (1 & 3) do too!  I wanted something for them to watch in the car with short segments & lots of stopping points, and this is perfect.  There are a few segments I could do without - specifically Luis & Maria's wedding and Big Bird finding out about Mr Hooper dying, but otherwise I'm happy with what is included.  It's so fun listening to it bc I remember so many of the segments, so even though I'm not watching while i drive, I know exactly what my 3yo is talking about when she tells me what is on the screen or brings it up later at home.  And we LOVE the Lena Horne segment - we sang it on the way to her first day of preschool :)",1284681600,,670,3.9044117647058822

Gives a great variety of memorable clips (as I was a avid Sesame Street fan in the 70's as a child) up to current characters and clips (the second CD of seasons 21-40)--claymation, animated, celebrity, etc., which I'm just getting use to for my one year old neice, who seems to be following in auntie's footsteps in terms of her love of Sesame Street.

4332246,3,B004DCB0ZU,"I bought Old School Sesame Street Volumes 1 and 2 many years ago and have been waiting for a 3rd volume release because our family just LOOOOOVES these two. In fact, the box is falling apart because of overuse. When I saw the 40 Years of Summer Days, I actually thought this was the 3rd, so I got it right away. I didn't realize that 40 years means up to today (because that's about my age). I am disappointed to see a lot of Elmo and the other new muppets in there. I'm sorry but I never grew up with them so I find them annoying. Ok I admit it. I bought this as a gift to my 4 year old but it was mostly for me. But even my son grew up watching the Old School Sesame Street so even he is not crazy about the new guys. So now we just gave it a run-through and it's back in the box. Why? Because most of the clips are already in the 2 volumes we have. They just added the new episodes circa late 80s and 90s. Ok to be fair, there are nice clips that I totally don't remember, like Maria and Luis getting married and having a baby, and the death of Mr. Hooper. But you don't really want to keep watching those over and over, especially when you grew up thinking it was Maria and David! I was hoping to see more of the animated clips, more of ""The Number Painter"", more of the clumsy baker that falls down the steps, and more of Joe Raposo's genius compositions, Ernie's old pranks on Bert, and the phonics (You take the P with the ""ph"" and the AN ""an""... put them all together and they spell PAN, thats PAN... P-A-N, PAN....). That would've been great for my preschooler. Oh well... I still rate it with 3 stars because after all, it is Sesame Street and I have great respect for the people behind this production.

If you're a 40 yr old Sesame Street fan and you don't have Old School yet, get those, absolutely. Hold off on this one unless you want to collect. Hope this review has helped you.",1280016000,206,1894,4.091397849462366

4332249,3,B004DCB0ZU,"Definitely worth a look to anyone who, like me, grew up on the show in the '70s and '80s, but I have to agree with the reviewers who wanted more of this era. I didn't even bother to watch the second disc, which concerns itself with 1989-2009.

4332262,5,B004DCB0ZU,"This anniversary collection was obviously put together with care.  Most of the songs on ""Sesame Street Platinum Hits"" are here on video, as well as plenty of muppet action, educational video and all of the creativity and joy that make up Sesame Street. I found nuggets from my childhood that my daughter seems to love too (Remember Lady Bug Picnic?)  A couple of the celebrity songs feel dated (the Spin Doctors?).  But, there are great songs here from Feist, Alicia Keys and others.  Sure it does include a couple of the more emotional episodes from Sesame Street's past including the passing of Mr. Hooper and the loss of Big Bird's home in a bad wind.  But, they are here for how well these difficult times were dealt with.  Enjoy and share!",1265760000,5,744,4.641221374045801
4332263,1,B004DCB0ZU,"Yes, I love Sesame Street, but included in this video is the episode where Mr. Hooper is no longer alive. They were remiss to include the episode, because it is very suddenly sad. Your child may not have any experience with death/ loss of a loved one, so it could be quite confusing, especially when taken out of context! Or, if you have had a recent loss, you may not want this video around in your collection.",1265241600,11,411,4.35064935064935
4332264,5,B004DCB0ZU,"We ordered this for my daughter.  She loves it and we love watching it with her.  It brought us back to our own Sesame Street experience.  The only thing I would have liked more is MORE of each season.  It really just gave a couple of clips for each season.  Left me wanting a bit more, but I still give it five stars.",1262822400,,318,3.984126984126984
4332265,4,B004DCB0ZU,"The first DVD (1969-89) is the best one.  My 5 year old is enjoying it with me and normally she says she doesn't like Sesame St.  I think that's because the new episodes are all Elmo now, which my 2 year old loves.  I've had to explain a typewriter and a phone with a cord :)  Some of the 1989-2009 stuff we already have on other DVDs.  Overall I think it's a good buy.",1262822400,4,369,3.9324324324324325
4332266,3,B004DCB0ZU,"I was a Sesame Street fanatic as a small child, and some of my happiest memories are of curling up with my sister to watch Bert, Ernie, and the rest of the gang. Now that I have a daughter of my own, I wanted to share these memories with her. I was disappointed. Although each of the forty seasons of Sesame Street is represented, the later seasons include more celebrity performances than actual bits by the characters themselves, and it's HEAVILY based around Elmo, Zoe, and Abby instead of including more of the traditional characters. It broke my heart to see Cookie Monster lectured about eating cookies; they have revamped the older songs to be more ""hip,"" and they've included musical performances by bands/performers I would never choose for my toddler/preschooler to listen to (Destiny's Child, the Goo Goo Dolls, Feist, etc.). Let kids be kids and enjoy musicians and performers geared at younger children.

Don't get me wrong: the first DVD is a great walk down memory lane, and there were some fantastic clips not included on the Sesame Street Old School Vols. I-II. I'm not sorry I purchased this set, but we will be watching the first disk and skipping the second.

If you are a parent who's looking to relive your Sesame Street memories, spend your money on the Old School dvd's instead - this will be a disappointment to you.",1262649600,17,1341,4.726495726495727
