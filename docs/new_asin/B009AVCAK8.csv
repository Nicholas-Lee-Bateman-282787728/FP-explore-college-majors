I can tell you from the first three minutes that it does, indeed, appear to be movie length according to the little time bar on the bottom..

I believe it was Nietzsche who said ""And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.""

Anyway, this movie was free on Prime and my daughter wanted to watch it. I already knew it was bad. I didn't realize how bad.

I know how this character got its start on YouTube. I've heard the first two movies are awful too. But, the reaction I've had to this movie was visceral. That voice alone is enough.

I turned it off. I told my daughter that under no circumstances is she allowed to watch anything with the word ""Fred"" in the title, or any variation of that name. Which is good, because I'm proactively putting the nix on Freddie Got Fingered, which, by comparison, is a better movie.

Existential crisis? Absolutely. Maybe more like existential/cosmic horror. Just as gazing upon Cthulhu would drive you insane, so will this.

I was appropriate and funny for my 10-11 year old students.  I was a little nervous about the name of the camp that Fred visited.  (Iwannapeepee)  That's about as close to the line as it got.  Fred's mother was quite a character too, but some of my students could relate.  :(  Bottom line, a good movie for pre-teen kids.
