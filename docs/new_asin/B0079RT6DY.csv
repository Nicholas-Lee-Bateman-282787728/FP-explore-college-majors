Wendy's DVD takes you from buying your material, to cutting, assembling and finishing with lots of handy short-cut tips along the way.  In less than two weeks time, I had a finished quilt that I'm using as a tablecloth for special occasions.  I can hardly wait to try another of Wendy's quilting DVD's.",1343001600,2,347,4.564516129032258
8512999,5,B0079RT6DY,"I purchased this dvd about 3 weeks ago and now have a beautiful Hugs and Kisses lap quilt completed.  The directions are easy to follow, the tricks shared by Wendy that her Aunt Mary passed down to her are so fun and really made the quilt come together beautifully.  I can't wait to buy another when they are released!",1332806400,,318,4.372881355932203
