8229720,3,6301103394,"This was a good video of the Lakes amazing 1987-88 season.  However, it is somewhat disappointing as well, especially when comparing it to ""Home of The Brave"", which came out a year earlier on NBA Entertainment.  For example, not much is revealed about the Laker opponents and what other teams were doing that year.  It is purely a film from a Laker fan's perspective, meaning that it is somewhat dull and one-sided.  However, Laker fans of the 80s would love to watch how their team won their 11th NBA title.",1014595200,,509,4.622222222222222
