8374414,3,B002MZZTZ2,"This black-and-white Eurospy yarn from 1964 skips much of the more fantastic, exotic elements of the Bond template in favor of procedural detective work.  Dominique Paturel plays Francis Coplan, a tough spy whose partner (more of a sidekick really) Fondane (Jacques Balutin) is never too far behind.  The pair soon suspect the beautiful criminal Ingrid Carlsen (Virna Lisi) and her accomplice Rochon of having stolen SR 712, a nuclear rocket propulsion system.  Ingrid has used and discarded one of Coplan's previous partners (sidekicks), so the two have a history.  More troubling is the somewhat silly gang of villains also after the device under the direction of ""Tex"".  You will suspect the only character with a Texas accent right away (everyone not tagged as ""American"" has a more non-regional American accent dubbed in), but Coplan doesn't quite put it together until the end.  Thankfully, ol' Tex has a soft spot for the ladies...

Despite claiming to be set around the Riviera, there is nothing referenced in the film to add that flavor.  The story is heavier on dialogue and slower than one would expect (not necessarily a bad thing), but, being dubbed, I had to take it back and rewatch it in a few places to catch some of the more subtle details of how and why Coplan moves from interviewing one character to the next.  There are a couple places in the last scene where the audio drops out altogether, but one doesn't seem to miss much.  The print that Sinister Cinema is using is obviously unrestored and is likely the best one can find of such an obscure film.

This film is enjoyable if you are interested in the Eurospy genre, but doesn't really take us anywhere new.  The atmosphere is more akin to early spy shows on TV (think very early Avengers without much wit) than to James Bond.  I would recommend Sinister Cinema's Seven Golden Men to this any day, but I'm certainly not sorry that I came across this DVD.",1295222400,2,1930,4.74251497005988
