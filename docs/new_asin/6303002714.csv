7901877,5,6303002714,"I purchased this video tape the year it came out.  The best part of this tape is the subconscious messaging at the end.  It really works to help you get a perfect tempo in your golf swing.  It also teaches you how to breath correctly before and during the swing, which are critical elements for power and tempo.  I highly recommend this tape for anyone needing to learn the mechanics as well as the subconscious programming part of the swing.  This is one of the best tapes I've ever owned.  Too bad it doesn't come in DVD.",1344729600,,523,4.34020618556701
7901878,5,6303002714,"This video breaks down the golf swing into easily understood segments. The exercises if followed will ingrain the dynamics of the swing so they become automatic and you won't be standing over the ball with random swing thoughts. It is well organized and the trance like video portions are unique and effective. This is a video that you can go back to when you start losing it, as we all do at times, including the pros. It is not a quick fix, but if you follow the instructions and stick with it, your game will benefit immensely. I would recommend this tape to any level golfer.",1019001600,,579,4.471698113207547
