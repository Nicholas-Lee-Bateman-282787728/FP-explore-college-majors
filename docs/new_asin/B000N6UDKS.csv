8175297,5,B000N6UDKS,"This is as nice as vol.#2, and everything that was said in that review holds true for this vol. as well. If you are interested at all in railroading, these two albums should be in your collection.",1389052800,,196,4.324324324324325
8175298,1,B000N6UDKS,It was more about the trains and equipment than the actual travel and scenery.  We were very disappointed and are not interested in Volume 2.,1387411200,,141,4.64
8175299,1,B000N6UDKS,"Color is horrible, picture is blurry, whats with the GREEN COLOR?
This is an insult to the Switzerland that my Ancestors came from
and I seen in person which was Beautiful Country!!
Don't Buy this is GREEN MONSTER MESS!!",1294444800,,220,4.666666666666667
8175300,3,B000N6UDKS,The qualkity of the colour was disappointing - proabaly because of the difference inthe systems in South Africa and the USA.  Scenery stunning.,1285718400,,143,5.217391304347826
8175301,3,B000N6UDKS,"Both tourists and train buffs should appreciate these two episodes; lots of scenery, lots of rolling stock. Trainspotters: keep pencil handy; many engines identified by number in Episode One. Probably late '80s. Transfer from tape satisfactory but not pristine.",1243468800,4,261,5.717948717948718
8175302,2,B000N6UDKS,"The picture, obviously from a VHS, was a little grainy, and not really up to date close to this year.  More like it was filmed in the 1980's.  I would think twice before buying this.",1241136000,4,182,4.171428571428572
8175303,5,B000N6UDKS,"Both of the trips on this DVD were well done.  The earlier VHS tapes made in the early 90's covered different areas of the Swiss rail system and were done by a UK group.

There is an incredible amount of information about the rail system and the rolling stock. The Swiss for a small country have developed an extensive rail system through some of the most beautiful scery in the world.

The high use of the rail system comes as a result of not only the topograpy of the country, but the desire of the Swiss to not create an extensive 4 lane highway system through valleys that are already congested with existing roads and the rail systems.

The pictures were shot during the springtime so that sometimes the scenery
was muted with the fog and rain.  When not raining or foggy, the views are spectacular.",1222646400,7,804,4.47945205479452
8175304,5,B000N6UDKS,WOW !!! This is a beautiful and breathtaking video . Scenery was out of this world and I am extremely glad I bought it,1211155200,3,118,3.9583333333333335
