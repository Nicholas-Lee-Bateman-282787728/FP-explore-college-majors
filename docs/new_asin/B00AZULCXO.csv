5538614,5,B00AZULCXO,"Movie was wonderfully made movie.  It poignantly portrayed the ups and downs of depression; the feelings of those dealing with it (the deep dark sadness, the shame, guilt, worhtlessness) as well as the hopefulness that this too shall end and how if you surround yourself with the right people, (i.e. good therapist, psychiatrist, understanding friends/family) and learn how to take the best care of yourself, things can get better.
It is not sugar-coated, just the facts. I will recommend to all my fellows who battle this in the hopes they can glean some good from it and possibly share with their close significant others. Bravo!!",1470614400,4,632,5.019047619047619

5538618,4,B00AZULCXO,An important film which helps us understand how we can not only recognize but deal with clinical depression.

8559897,4,B00AZULCXO,"Well done, speaks to the reality of day-to-day clinical depression even when the diagnosed is medicated. This is an insidious and potentially fatal disorder, which for me needs daily monitoring and maintenance. What has worked best for me is the combination of talk therapy, medication, exercise, vegan diet, and sobriety. Please don't give up. you don't have to do it alone, but you do have to do it.",1514246400,,401,4.911764705882353
8559898,4,B00AZULCXO,"I've had non-treatable, clinical depression for six years. I found the people telling their stories much more helpful than the rest of the movie because I found the actors' characters so unlikeable. If you know nothing of clinical depression and were to see only the actors' portrayal, your view of the disease would not be accurate. The character of Mel is shown as a whiney, b*tchy woman who sits around feeling sorry for herself. A more sympathetic actress would have helped, but the script doesn't show the pain she feels, it only shows her behaviours. I found myself wanting to slap her, if that tells you anything. Dom's reactions were accurate, but his beer drinking did not add anything to the story. This show has good information, but most of it doesn't do anything to change the public's view of mental illness. The most important part of the movie is when one man talks about the difference between being depressed and clinical depression. I suggest fast forwarding through to the real stories which start at the movie's beginning and are shown approximately every ten minutes. If you want to skip the whole thing, just read this:

 ""I think depression is a terrible word to use to describe this illness because people use it to describe two different things. Theres clinical depression, which is a biochemical illness, and theres just being depressedpeople that are upset about the economy, or losing a girlfriend, or a death in the family. They are really two different things and I think that people who haven't gone through clinical depression assume that people who ARE going through clinical depression are just depressed, have the blues, or are upset. Thats why they always ask you, 'What are you depressed about?' Im never depressed about anything when Im going through clinical depression.""",1506470400,2,1811,4.953947368421052
8559899,4,B00AZULCXO,"This film is a great exploration of the topic, and I really appreciate both the format (going back and forth between the narrative and others' experiences) and the honesty.  In fact, some of the scenes were a bit too awkward, just like real life.  But I do a bit of exception with what I find to be the message:  that if you could just ""reach out"" and get help from the professionals your depression will get better.  In my experience and that of those very close to me, that is not the case.  Recently I attended a lecture on depression and heard a neuroscientist say that antidepressants only work for 60% of the population.  She was damned if science knew why.  I have had lackluster experiences with therapists, and my husband has had worse.  Getting the right therapist-client relationship is absolutely paramount; I know it takes time and an openness to trying different ones.  But there is only so much money, and just as important, perseverance.  If I'm suffering from despair already, constant disappointment is not so helpful.  I am not opposed to suicide on principle:  It is quite reasonable that many folks do not have the constitution to make it in this world, and it is a rational choice to end the trying.  I also believe depression is just like Parkinson's or Lou Gehrig's or cerebral palsy ... a horrible disease for which some treatments work for some people and some don't.",1502064000,,1393,4.683127572016461

8559904,5,B00AZULCXO,"This film is all heart. Powerful and poignant. Giving us a look into the life of someone who is as vulnerable as any of us and who have had to endure depression, or know anyone who has. Jules Bruff comes out the other side with a bit more hope and the viewer is all the wiser for sharing her journey. Well done. An Indy gem.",1480118400,,324,4.0
