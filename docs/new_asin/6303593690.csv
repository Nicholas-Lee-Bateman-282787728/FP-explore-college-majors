7850855,5,6303593690,"From the opening moments of gay laughter and silliness to the closing shots of a lost Russian social class fading into time, Nikita Mikhalkov's film 'An Unfinished Piece for Player Piano' is perfect Chekhov. Drawn from  'Mr. Platonov', the story circles around a group of relatives and friends  at a country estate. Everyone is giddy with boredom until a woman arrives  who was Platonov's youthful love in past years. This arrival stirs up old  memories and questions Platonov has never resolved about the former  relationship and his life direction. Others are affected by his changed  mood, and they too begin to question certain relationships among them. In  Chekhov there is never tragedy in the sense of anger, betrayal, and death,  but rather in nuances of missed opportunities, regrets, and critical life  insights always achieved in hindsight. Most of his plays leave you with a  feeling of sadness and yearning for character types that no longer exist.  The turn-of-the-century people he presents are part of a fading aristocracy  that will be eliminated by the revolution of 1917. In this production, the  ending is sweet. I have read and seen Chekhov's plays, but until you see a  fine Russian production such as this one, you can never quite experience  the tone and color of the story as Chekhov himself intended. The acting is  superb (and includes Director Mikhalkov himself). A must see.",938995200,31,1403,5.034782608695652
