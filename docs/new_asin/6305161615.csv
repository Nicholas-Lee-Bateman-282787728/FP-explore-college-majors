982487,5,6305161615,Just what I had heard.  One of the classics.  Glad to have it for my ever expanding collection!  Stephen Chow rules!,1375660800,,116,4.428571428571429
982488,3,6305161615,"A Stephen Chow movie! Awesome! Unfortunately, I am unable to watch it. There is no English dubbing and, for some reason, on my copy, the english subtitles do not work. So I guess my choice is to either learn Mandarin or Cantonese or watch a properly subtitled version on YouTube. Honestly though, I wanted it for my collection.",1371772800,,327,4.655172413793103
982489,5,6305161615,"If you like Stephen Chow, you may like this film.  It's one of my favorite films to watch after a long, hard day.  It's just so silly and cartoonish, and is a story with a lot of heart.  I would definitely recommend.",1362960000,,216,4.095238095238095
982490,5,6305161615,"I got this for my girlfriend a few years back. And I was shocked, it was pretty good and very funny. If you love Asian films and can get it for a good price, I say do it.",1333670400,,170,3.5
982491,5,6305161615,This movie is straight up hilarious.  Stephen Chow is so funny as always and this is one of his strongest comedies.  A must see!!!,1283904000,,130,4.375
982492,5,6305161615,"The greatest shaolin kung fu movie ever made! The ultimate Chinese movie! Grotesque, irreverent, vulgar, and profound in its disrespect for all things sancti-money-fied. A candidate for the funniest film I've ever watched. The humor is doubled by the chop suey English of the subtitles, and if you happen to speak any dialect of Chinese, make that tripled!

""The God of Cookery"" is a parody of a genre that's already silly in its own right, the Chinese version of magic realism best known to Americans from the film 'Crouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger'. Director Stephen Chaiu (given as Chow in the subtitles, aptly enough) is also the star, a nasty cocky restaurant tycoon who is ousted by ""The Triad"" and who fights his way back with the help of allies including street thugs, a disfigured maiden, and a Buddhist abbot. Lots of cutlery flashing in mid-air, scatological humor, and some vivid impressions of the actual culinary artistry of Hong Kong.

You'll have to see it to believe it.",1277164800,,985,4.892215568862276
982493,5,6305161615,"After this, I think Stephen Chow tried to broaden the appeal of his movies to Western audiences (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), but IMHO, lost some of the quirky charm in the translation. I've been a Stephen Chow fan for years, ever since my aunt foisted an unlabeled VHS tape on me containing ""Hail the Judge"". I eventually tracked down most of his movies (on cheap VCDs) through the magic of the Internet. They are a bit formulaic, with him playing an initially heartless S.O.B. who gets into trouble and has to crawl his way back to the top while learning some humanity, but ""God of Cookery"" absolutely nails it, and I was laughing hysterically most of the way through. Of course it's funnier in Chinese, and if you're familiar with all the genres being spoofed (Iron Chef, wuxia (superhero swordsmen) serials, gangster movies, supernatural comedy/drama, etc.)

Great performances all around. Stephen Chow's arrogant chef manages to be corrupt and greedy without being completely repulsive, so his eventual turnaround is believable. Karen Mok is just as good as playing a disfigured woman who runs a streetside noodle stand and a small gang, who help him when he hits bottom. Everyone is insane, down to the woman who judges the final cook-off at the climax of the movie. The discussion of the merits of the ""folding chair"" as a martial arts weapon! Shaolin internal energy methods applied to cooking! ""Explosive Pissing Beef Balls""! And much much more, all carried off with tremendous style and energy.

I love it!",1252454400,,1520,4.910505836575876
982494,5,6305161615,"Had to buy this movie after seeing it at a friend's a while ago. Absolutely ridiculous, and you'll appreciate it more if you're familiar with Iron Chef. The English subtitles are pretty bad but that only adds to the appeal.",1238198400,,223,4.6
982495,5,6305161615,"Me and my friends stumbled upon this movie, and watched it without really knowing anything about it. We were all pleasantly surprised to discover that it is one of the most hilarious movies ever written. Many people say you have to understand Chinese culture to understand this movie, but I don't know much about Chinese culture and still found myself laughing throughout the enitre movie. While I have to admit, the subtitles aren't always up to par (they repeatedly use the word ""satin"" instead of ""Satan"" and there was one sentence that was so bad I had no clue what it was supposed to mean), but that doesn't take away from the glory that is this movie! If you want to see a really fun spoof that actually will make you laugh out loud, I highly recommend this!",1223424000,,764,4.543478260869565
982496,5,6305161615,"Wow!
A uniquely funny and poignant film.
So unique that I cannot classify it.
Both a comedy and a tragedy
and so much more.
And amazingly beautiful to look at.
I would have appreciated it more,
if that is possible,
had I understood more of Chinese
philosophy and culture.

The English subtitles,
which were necessary for me,
were very poorly done.
The dialog is probably
far superior than that of
the subtitles unless
the only mistakes
were spelling and grammar.
A film of this quality,
a true classic, deserves to
be translated well for
English readers.",1222905600,,554,4.770833333333333
982635,5,6305161615,I got this movie based on a reccomendation by Alton Brown and I'm glad I did.  Steven Chaiu is one of the funniest film makers coming out of China right now.  It does contain a bit of cultural humor so if you don't know much about Chinese culture you might not get a lot of it.  It's a bit silly by American standards.  All this aside I watch this over and over again.  Very funny movie!,1210550400,,387,4.0394736842105265
982636,5,6305161615,"Stephen Chow made his main American breakout with Kung Fu Hustle, another good film, but prior to that he had a long career in cinema.  God of Cookery is hillarious in a simlar way as Kung Fu Hustle, but it has the bizzare cutness that it didn't which Chow made a name on.  Think of an Iron Chef episode and mix that with Shaolin Socccer style fighting (another golden Chow Gem) and you have Cookery.  it is a Rags to riches type story as many Chow films are, but it isn't the typical one.  A tongue in cheek movie with good dialogue and an amusing love interest this film is good even on sequential viewings.  I was introduced to this about 5 years ago or more (less? been a while) and I still watch it on occasion and laugh.  It is ok for the kids too though there is some ""harsh language"" in terms of swearing but not in too bad of a way.  Go ahead and get it, you know you want too.",1203811200,,886,4.057471264367816

982638,3,6305161615,"Unlike the previous reviews I don't think yo have to speak Chinese to enjoy this movie . You get the jist from the subtitles. It is a big spoof on the whole Iron Chef popularity. It was funny even though the jokes were based in Chinese culture. Most of the jokes are sight gags anyway. It is a movies for a good laugh, nothing heavy.",1165017600,,333,4.138461538461539
982639,4,6305161615,"Ok I have seen three Stephen Chow movies.  God of Cookery, Shaolin Soccer, and Kung Fu Hustle.  Kung Fu Hustle is by far the worst movie he's made, but the most catered to American audiences.  Therefore, if you liked Kung Fu Hustle, chances are you are not going to be a horribly big fan of God of Cookery.  I adored God of Cookery myself.  I thought it hilarious and entertaining and not at all hard to follow.

Shaolin Soccer in my opinion is a superior film to God of Cookery, but God of Cookery is just a small step behind.  I enjoyed it immensely.",1136246400,4,552,4.25
982640,1,6305161615,"It's hard to believe I watched the same movie as everyone else here. This movie fails on every level. It isn't a good action movie, or a good silly movie, or a good comedy, or a good satire ... or much of anything but an endless parade of lame gags, terrible dialogue, weak characters, vapid plot, and so on. There isn't anything redeeming about God of Cookery. Don't be fooled into thinking you'll like it because you like Shaolin Soccer, Iron Chef, Rumble in the Bronx, Ong Bak, or almost any other far-superior show or movie to which it might be compared. God of Cookery is just painful, feeble, and empty.",1134086400,2,609,4.495495495495495
982641,4,6305161615,"The movie was funny and pokes fun at a lot of chinese movies, but the subtitles are horrible. I'm a mandarin speaker and I had to watch it in cantonese (which i'm not very fluent in), so i lost a lot of the stuff that was going on. too bad my b/f doesn't speak chinese at all, but even he managed to laugh sometimes :-D

anyway, if you are a stephen chow fan cuz of kungfu hustle, u will not get this movie much, cuz they talk very fast and a lot of the humor aren't targetted towards a universal audience.",1132531200,3,506,4.00990099009901
982642,3,6305161615,"I was really taken by Kung Fu Hustle - I thought it was extremely unique and a whole lot of fun.  After watching it, I backtracked and watched Shaolin Soccer.  I enjoyed that movie as well, and then found myself on Amazon looking up other Stephen Chow movies.  I found this one, and looked it up at my local video rental stores.  No dice.  So I went ahead and purchased it through Amazon.  Now that I've watched it, I will say that I enjoyed it, but I didn't need to purchase it.  If you can find some other means to see it, by all means do so.  If the only way you can see it is by purchasing it, read on...

This is not a bad movie by any means.  It's just not a movie that was made with a US audience in mind.  And there's no reason it should have been - it was not released stateside like Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle were.  Be that as it may, the English subtitles have been done by someone whose primary language is not English.  And hey, that's not a bad thing.  I'm sure that whoever did the subtitles did the best he or she could.  Being a person who has tried to speak and write a foreign language myself, I can understand the task the translator had to take on.  But the reality is this; for an American viewer who is counting on those subtitles to follow the story, a very literal and often times confusing translation is presented.  I found myself constantly having to think ""what does this actually mean?""  For instance, does ""fairy"" really mean fairy?  Or does it mean angel?  Or does it mean ghost?  Or (more likely) is there not a corresponding word in the English language that really conveys the true meaning conveyed in the movie's native language?  By the time all of those thoughts run through one's head, a couple of other subtitles have already come and gone that you have not devoted that kind of thought to.  In short, it can be a little hard to follow.

I also second the comments from some earlier reviews; the humor here is not as universal as it was in Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.  It seems to be very specific to the Chinese culture.  Again, I understand that there is no reason it should be anything but what it is.  I'm just trying to give ""average Kung Fu Hustle fan"" a heads up here.

What I found most fascinating about the movie (i.e. - the reason I did enjoy it at all) is the fact that this was a movie that I assume isn't the least bit self conscious of its culture - it just is what it is.  Given that, it's arguable that something like this can be a more interesting look into Chinese culture than some National Geographic article or TV special like ""CHINESE CULTURE:  What it means to you!""

So in the end, if you're looking for another Shaolin Soccer or Kung Fu Hustle (and English is your native tongue), I would say that this movie IS NOT what you're looking for.  But if you do watch it and are interested in peeking in at other cultures, you might come away with something else...",1126742400,51,2940,4.250902527075812
982643,5,6305161615,"I Just want to say something about the ending, which is absurd to some. Some previous reviews say that was beyond comprehension. I guess it takes a little more understanding about the Chinese mythology and traditional stories to comprehend that scene. In some Chinese myth, gods would sometimes be punished to go through normal men's life. The purpose sometimes is for them to gain experience and to understand and be able to correct their misdoings. It could also be that two gods hated each other be put on the earth as humans like you and I do without remembering they were gods and be tested in occassions similar to the quarells they have had in heaven when they were gods. This is often for them to understand ""an eye for an eye"" is not a proper way to solve the problem, which sounds quite an essential part to the Chinese, or maybe Buddist's philosophy, in my opinion.

But, anyway, Chow, the fat guy and the manager was somewhat like the gods that has been put on the earth. Chow was the God of Cookery. The manager was a dog in heaven - Yes. There could be animals in heaven too. But, of course, ""God of Cookery"" (the movie) did not explain why they were put on earth.

I hope this helps people who don't understand enough Chinese mythology to make sense of the ending of the movie. But, sadly, I realize and I agree many Cantonese jokes do not translate quite well to English.

I am form Hong Kong and, so, I understand everything very well. But the down side is that my English ability may not allow me to make my point.",1117929600,62,1532,4.406360424028269
982644,5,6305161615,"This movie is hilarious. It's a relatively narrow spoof of HK movies such as God of Gamblers, which itself is a spoof of the HK gambling movie genre. So many western viewers may not see the humor, and find this exercise strange and pointless. OTOH, those with at least some sensibility of Asian pop movies (including martial arts flicks like Crouching Tiger) should like it just fine. Besides, Stephen Chow is the king of HK cinema. So anyone purporting to like HK films needs to see at least a couple of Stephen Chow movies.

Oh yeah, it's also a sendup of the Japanese cooking game-show Iron Chef, which is itself pretty self-consciously over-the-top. So that this movie would seem somewhat extreme is not surprising.

The plot follows the basic Stephen Chow template, which is very formulaic yet somehow satisfies every time. Lovable loser/ underdog Stephen Chow rises to beat the bad guy and win the girl. I guess in this case, it's more like top guy falls down, then rises to beat the bad guy...but you get my point. Anyhow, it works really well for him so I wouldn't change a thing. His movies are filled with really wacky cornball humor, yet have have a lot of heart at the same time (by heart I mean in a Rocky 1 sorta way, not Steel Magnolias.)

The most recent reviewer before me mentioned not really ""getting"" this movie. I can sympathize, yet at the same time I thought the movie was...yes...LOL funny!",1107302400,15,1414,4.625498007968128
982797,5,6305161615,I was introduced to this movie by my good friend and I can't keep it out of my DVD player!!!  It's a great movie that will make you laugh ... especially the bad translated English sub titles ... but you get that sometimes!!,1042070400,6,223,4.186046511627907
982798,4,6305161615,"okay, lets start with this:  the movie is a comedy.
Have you seen Iron monkey?  Think something along those lines.  cheezy dialogue, improbable martial arts stunts, and a completely ridiculous plot.  Including a musical segment.  If you aren't into b-movies, this isn't for you.  But I promise, it is absolutely hysterical.  Watch it with friends, and you won't stop laughing.",1038873600,6,376,5.166666666666667
982799,5,6305161615,"Wow! God of Cookery is one of the funniest flick I have ever seen. The tempo of the movie, the insanely clever dialogues, and the razor sharp parodies all add up to a great movie experience. Even though my wife does not speak Chinese, she thought it was wonderful. If you know Cantonese or something about Hong Kong cultural history, THIS IS IT! You will pick up subtle references that will bring back Hong Kong circa late 80's/early 90's.
A Chinese movie that is finally willing to make fun of itself. No genre is safe: God of Cookery pokes fun at old gangster flicks, gambling flicks, the silly montages, Hong Kong soup operas, Iron Chef, martial art movies, politics, class, food, food, food...",1013990400,32,697,4.67479674796748
982800,5,6305161615,"but this... was... AWESOME!!!!!! if you consider yourself a fan of HK cinema and HAVEN'T seen this, well, YOU LOSE. oh man. we all know HK flicks pack it all in; tears, laughter, fighting, melodrama, the supernatural... and this is no exception. and the darn movie is about CHEFS for crying out loud. this is a very unique movie. and if all these 4 and 5 star reviews don't convince you, i hear they're re-making this in hollywood with Jim Carrey. (?) i just finished watching it and it is so very good. i was amazed. i think i am going to start buying more stephen chiau stuff. karen mok is wonderful. yes you've seen her in ""black mask"" and she's funny, adorable, but here she's adorable even while acting under disfiguring make-up. and i totally dug the scene where chiau jumps from the boat, ACROSS the water and then into the competition. totally crouching tiger. yes, chefs can fly too. yes. rent, borrow, BUY this movie so in the future you can say ""oh i saw that movie way back in...""",987811200,7,992,4.456043956043956
982801,5,6305161615,"Listen up, this movie is fantastic, it encapsulates the bizarre chinese psyche and their love of the downright strange. Admittedly I understand Cantonese and some of the translation is dodgy, but this shouldn't stop you rushing out and buying this.
Contrary to what has been written before, this isn't a parody of Chow Yun Fat's 'God Of Gamblers' but rather the trilogy of 'Saints of Gamblers' films (itself a paroday of God of Gamblers, yes complicated but bare with me), which, you've guessed it, stars Stephen Chow too. These are in the same vein and I would encourage anyone with an open mind to watch these too, you won't be dissapointed.",986256000,5,643,4.801801801801802
982802,2,6305161615,"Perhaps I've seen to much Jackie Chan to be able to properly appreciate this movie, but I found myself sitting on my couch at the end of the movie wondering what had just happened.  ""God of Cookery"" is certainly a movie that tries hard to please its audience, but somewhere along the line (I think maybe at about an hour into the movie) it simply abandons its plot and moves into the realm of the incredibly bizarre.  It certainly means well, but it has no idea what to do with itself.
""God of Cookery"" is apparently a parody of sorts of the Chow-Yun Fat classic ""God of Gamblers"".  Unfortunately, I haven't seen ""God of Gamblers"", so I can't give you a comparison as to how effective the parody is.  However, in its own right, I don't know how well it stands.
Certain parts of the movie have a definite zany flair that make you like them in spite of what you think of the movie.  The whole ""West Side Story"" sequence involving two local gangs fighting over control of one restaurant's recipes is a very cute sequence that had me smiling for days afterward.  Even parts in the monastery sequences where Stephen Chow's character is learning cooking skills are funny enough to stand on their own merit.  However, other parts - especially the final battle/cooking sequence - simply go too far around the bend for me to be able to appreciate them - or even laugh.
None of this is helped in the movie by the progressively deteriorating English grammar in the subtitles, either.  I try not to be picky about typos or small problems in grammar - after all, Cantonese to English is by all accounts a really tough translation - but there were entire scenes that I could not understand due to the grammatical confusion.  By the end of the movie, practically every sentence was confusing.
All in all, I find myself not hating this movie.  When movies try as hard as this one did to get you to like it, it's hard to hate them.  However, I was disappointed by it.  I really wanted to like it a lot more than I did.  Perhaps I just don't have the hang of proper Hong Kong comedy, but I found myself feeling puzzled when others were laughing hysterically.  So, in retrospect, I would say that if you've heard good things about ""God of Cookery"" and are looking for a mindless Hong Kong action comedy then go for it.  Just be warned, though, that it may not necessarily be what you're looking for.",983577600,3,2380,4.464203233256351
982803,5,6305161615,"I remember the first time I watched this film, I was sitting in a motel with my brother watching the international channel. For the entire movie, our jaws were on the floor, because what was on the screen was so absurdly bizarre that we didn't know what to think of it.
So we went out and bought the DVD... for 40 bucks, which was the price of this for the longest time. Good for everyone else that the price tag has dropped down to 17 bucks.
This movie is downright hilarious, and is perhaps one of my favorite comedies. Despite the terrible subtitles (ie: fairy = angels), the content is great.

On the contrary, if you want to have fun, laughing  throughout a film, feeling tounched by the romantic love story and  witnessing a change of an arrogant business man to a true chef, don't miss  this great film!
I appreciate the rhythm of this film very much. It's  fast and smooth as well as stylish. I've noticed that it only spent about  half an a hour to clearly show how Chow's characteristic is, and how  successful he was before getting bankruptcy. The sequences of the motion in  the first half hour is unforgettable to me.
Besides the great  performance of Chow, Karen (Sister Turkey) was outstanding as well. Her  acting was extremely exaggerate, but this was really funny.
One demerit  of this film was the ending, it was really strange and hard to accept. But  anyway, it carries some meaningful messages which can compensate somewhat.
Overall, I highly recommend it to everyone. No matter you can understand  Cantonese or not, see it! If you're going to see just one Chow's movie,  make sure that you see this one.",946166400,20,1177,4.705882352941177
