5556908,4,B00B58FUBA,"I have not yet seen ""Aloha Fluffy"",but I own his other 2 shows.  He breaks my Mom and I down to tears; He is sooooo funny!
  I have a feeling that ""Aloha Fluffy"" will be just as funny. I will Definitively get this DVD.",1365552000,,218,3.909090909090909
5556909,4,B00B58FUBA,"I was there at this show, and I personally thought Gabriel's energy was a little low.  He, Martin and some of the other comedians in his entourage were under the weather and not feeling well.  You can hear it in Gabe's voice if you listen carefully.  Martin was even encouraging Gabe to cancel, but I'm glad Gabe decided to go on with the show.  Having said that I would rate this performance similar to his ""Hot and Fluffy"".  Topics Fluffy covers include some of his experiences with local Hawaiian culture (including some hilarious references, i.e. ""shootz & roger dat"", ""mahu""), his girlfriend, Frankie, and of course, performing for a prince in Saudi Arabia.  All of it induces side-splitting laughter.

IMO, the ""I'm not Fat I'm Fluffy"" performance at El Paso was hands down the best which makes it extremely difficult to follow up.  In ""Aloha Fluffy"", Gabe recycled some material from last year when I saw him in Hawaii, which was slightly disappointing, but hey, it's genuine Fluffy with Fluffy-delivered material.  He can tell the same jokes and still make it funny as hell.  One of the highlights of the evening was when G. Reilly told HIS side of the ""racist gift basket"" story.  As Gabe puts it, this joke was 7 years in the making!

Overall, this was a great performance, and if you're already a fan, don't hesitate to get this DVD!  If you're new to Gabriel's stand-up comedy, I would recommend viewing ""Hot and Fluffy"" first, followed by ""Aloha Fluffy"", and end with the best of them all ""I'm not Fat I'm Fluffy"".  As long as you know beforehand that Frankie is Gabriel's adopted stepson, the order of events that unfold in Gabriel's life won't throw you off.",1365465600,18,1673,4.70446735395189

Two of his travelling buddies came on stage first telling very discusting ""jokes"" about men menuastrating. Then they did a sales pitch for ""Fluffy "" carnival quality items. Fluffy finally came on dressed as if he was about to do yard work. There wasn't any kind of music, backdrop or innovative lighting or props. The most
entertaining portion of the show was when a teen in the front row got hauled out for taking a photo , Fluffy called him on his cell phone in the lobby and his mom, who was sitting in front of us, got callled out and then
mom got to bring him back. If this show had been in a local Boston cllub, we would have just gone elsewhere.",1473465600,,760,4.248275862068965

5557415,5,B00B58FUBA,"Another great special from Gabriel Iglesias. Not quite as good as ""I'm not Fat...I'm Fluffy"" but still a good experience. Brand new stories, along with a healthy dose of his life with his girlfriend and her child. Like his other specials, his comedy focuses on events in his life, stories of odd events he has experienced. Very little politics, no real controversy, and amazingly funny. His fast-paced and manic style is still very much in evidence, and his voice range hasn't changed, allowing him to continue his incredible imitations. Very good, for those who enjoy quick, vignette style comedy.",1403654400,,598,5.05050505050505

There is about 45 minutes of encore MISSING from the video format. This is NOT the same as the album (mp3, whatever). If you were hoping to see him do the Magic Mike story, or the Siri stuff you will be disappointed, it is not part of the video.

Very disappointed in this :(",1403481600,10,356,4.071428571428571

5557422,5,B00B58FUBA,"We saw ""Hot and Fluffy"" on vacation a couple months ago; Gabriel is very funny and pulls all of his material from his life. He's smart and kind and his humor is never mean.

5557423,5,B00B58FUBA,My husband and I have watched several of his shows and we love his humor.  In this particular performance he touches on some of the local nuances of Hawaii.  Having lived there for two years we found it absolutely accurate and hilarious.  He also addresses some other cultures and their fun quirks.  He is truly a funny man who knows how to 'keep it real'.  The only reason to not watch this is because you don't like to laugh!,1400544000,,427,4.3544303797468356

5557448,5,B00B58FUBA,"Aloha Fluffy is in my viewpoint one of Gabriel Iglesias better performances for couple of reasons.  Reason one being it is roughly an hour and half comedy special.  Reason two would be the prank he did to his son in order to get him to put on his deorderant (have to order the show to see what I mean by the pank).  Reason three would have to be the bonus section with the Magic Mike story as an exrta to the show.  Reason four is the trip to Saudia Arbria and who he preformed for and the story behind that was very funny and enjoyable.  Almost the whole show made me cry from my gut hurting so much from the laughing, but reason five and the best one in my viewpoint was the Racist Gift Basket he did to a comedian friend of his (you have to buy the show to see the whole story behind it).  Though the whole show in my eyes he still stands out as a very funny comedian who can make your eyes water from laughing so much and so often.  If you need a good laugh, don't mind a few bad words being said on stage then buy this comedy show and enjoy a night of laughter.",1399593600,,1066,3.976525821596244
5557449,5,B00B58FUBA,"It is difficult for Gabriel Iglesias not to do an excellent show. His choice of material paired with his trademark delivery makes great comedy. Aloha Fluffy is just excellent. This special uses more personal  material. At times the show seems more you are having a peek at the fun and craziness of his career and family. Everyone will enjoy Aloha Fluffy, but ""Picachu's"" fans will enjoy it doubly so.",1399507200,,400,4.797101449275362

5557482,5,B00B58FUBA,"This was pretty funny.  I'm a big fan of clean humor and while this is not completely clean. I would say PG-13, most people would day R, the only issue is language (some of the times).  Still it's a very entertaining comedy show and the first I've seen of this comedian.  I will be sure to check out his other works as he is very funny.",1396137600,,336,4.0606060606060606
5557483,5,B00B58FUBA,Gabriel is very funny! It is even more funny than his previous specials. I was wondering if he could get any better and I have to say he has. My family watched this over dinner and we laughed so hard. I personally never seen my wife laugh the way she did. And I laughed so much I got a headache.

5557520,2,B00B58FUBA,"Let me begin by saying that ""I LOVED Hot and Fluffy"" so I bought Aloha Fluffy ... which I did not even finish.  So disappointed! Unfortunately, Gabriel Iglesias decides that his comedy act is the forum in which to share his parenting techniques as they relate to his 15-year-old stepson ... And his stories are NOT funny. At best, I felt sorry for the teenager.  I also felt tricked because the Hot and Fluffy guy was NOT in this video.  BUYER BEWARE.",1385856000,,451,4.475609756097561

He definitely needs to stick to the storytelling, and cut most of the joke-based stuff out. All of the ""inside baseball"" Hawaii jokes should not have made the cut for the special. Its not going to resonate with anyone outside of the theater audience, and he should have known that.

The day after I placed my order on Amazon, saw his Aloha Fluffy on Comedy central, I regret it afterwards, the material was not funny, Fluffy has peaked out, he is on a downward trend.

5557690,5,B00B58FUBA,"So funny, buying this will not disappoint.  Even though we watched the specials on comedy central this has more material than what aired.",1367712000,,137,4.956521739130435
5557691,5,B00B58FUBA,"This DVD is totally awesome!
Gabriel did it again, making everyone laugh until you cried!! Bravo, Gabriel! You are the best young comedian around!!",1367712000,,147,5.166666666666667
5557692,5,B00B58FUBA,i laughed so hard through out the entire performance. whether he was talking about going to different countries or being in a movie it was pure comedy gold,1367625600,,155,4.571428571428571
5557693,5,B00B58FUBA,Fluuuuuffffyyyyy!!,1367539200,,18,18.0
5557694,5,B00B58FUBA,"If you liked him in his previous three special as well as ""Stand-Up Revolution"" Seasons 1 and 2 you will love this.",1367452800,,115,4.2727272727272725
5557695,5,B00B58FUBA,"I was not happy that Comedy Central aired this special in two parts, but got over that quickly, when the DVD arrived.  He is still real. He is still approachable. Like most comics before him, his language has started getting a bit rougher, but he is still very much a family kind of guy. To me, he is the best ""plus size"" role model on the planet.  He is losing weight, for the sake of his health, but as a fan - I am happy that he is closer to ""Husky"" now, as opposed to ""DAMN!"" (Thankfully, he never came close to ""Oh HELL NO!"")  I can hardly wait for his next special!!!",1367452800,,573,4.053097345132743
5557696,5,B00B58FUBA,Great comedy Gabriel keeps you laughing throughout the full 90min. You could never go wrong with fluffy go and get his other comedy special you won't regret it. ( hot and fluffy) ( I'm not fat I'm fluffy ) those are his other specials.,1367366400,,235,4.363636363636363
5557697,5,B00B58FUBA,"Very Funny DVD Would definitely reccomend to everybody to buy wthis DVD, Gabriel Iglesias is a very funny man YEAH",1367366400,,114,4.75
5557698,5,B00B58FUBA,I LOVED this new DVD.  Gabriel is just as funny as ever.  It was even pretty much kid appropriate.  My 12yr old son laughed his head off with me.  I would totally recommend this to everyone out there who wants to add a great stand up DVD to their collection.  Well worth every cent!,1367366400,,282,4.148148148148148
5557699,5,B00B58FUBA,"Fluffy is the man! No recycled jokes from his Stand Up revolution show, which is good. There is also a segment with my favorite comedian that he has introduced us to, Alfred Robles. That alone was a big push for me to make this purchase. There's also a surprise comedian appearance towards the end of the show. I won't say who (even though it's mentioned in other reviews here), but its a great close to the show in addition to the few encore jokes done as well.

I got to see Fluffy in Norfolk VA during his 2012 tour and many of those jokes were here. So that is great to hear them again and the stories about Hawaii were new to me as well. Please do yourself a favor and see this man and his entourage live. They are a riot!

I also want to address what I read in another review here about his Saudi Arabia story. I don't think it was politically motivated. That makes no sense, like Fluffy has said; He is just a funny storyteller. I was in awe and glad that he told this story in Norfolk, a huge military area. Im sure he touched some cold hearts with that one. Though one of the funniest jokes he told at that show wasn't even a joke "" Who here voted for Obama?"" he asked probing for a response, The response was just a handful of claps in the front rows. Other then that; dead silence, well besides me laughing at the response. Good one Fluffy! Nothing against the president, just not the right crowd jaja!",1367193600,,1413,4.210332103321033
5557700,4,B00B58FUBA,I have been a fan of Gabriel for some time now. I order this and was told it was going to take 3 weeks for me to get but they shipped it sooner I received this my DVD in 1 week.,1367107200,,177,3.341463414634146
5557701,5,B00B58FUBA,"FLUFFY RULES!!!  A Must if you are a Fluffy Fan. very funny all new material and the ending is to die for, laughing of-course",1367107200,,125,4.208333333333333
5557702,4,B00B58FUBA,This guy is a funny man. He could make you laugh so hard with his fluffy jokes. I didn't think he was as funny on this show then the other shows he s done.,1367107200,,155,3.588235294117647
5557703,5,B00B58FUBA,Funny as hell! XD the third special of Gabriel Iglesias and it didn't disappoint its funny and its a good quality,1367020800,,113,4.428571428571429
5557704,5,B00B58FUBA,"VERY FUNNY! i seen Gabriel perform live .. i recommend that 200% but if you can't i recommend his dvds/blu-rays
i like his first two more because those were his first two but! at the end of the show there is a hidden clip talking about his *racial Gift basket* very funny clip . you get the poor person who the basket it was for .. so enjoy! Gabriel #1",1366848000,,352,4.042857142857143
5557705,4,B00B58FUBA,This was another hit by Gabriel.  He once again proved he was a funny and fluffy guy. I would recommend this if your looking for a good laugh,1366761600,,141,4.035714285714286
5557706,5,B00B58FUBA,i have seen fluffy on you tube and was immediately hooked. he is one of the best stand up comedians with such original jokes! you will be laughing so hard through out the whole show! Buy it now!!!,1366588800,,196,4.184210526315789
5557707,5,B00B58FUBA,Gabriel Iglesias never disappoints and his newest special is a prime example. He's so funny and so personable. It's no wonder he has millions of fans. Good stuff.,1366588800,,162,4.821428571428571
5557708,5,B00B58FUBA,just as i figured gabriel put out yet another great dvd. He also tells the story behind the gift basket joke,1366588800,,108,4.190476190476191
5557709,5,B00B58FUBA,I bought Gabriel Iglesias special Aloha Fluffy through instant video and was very happy. I am able to stream it on my desktop and was able to connect it to the tv to watch it. Gabriel is one of the funniest comedians out there who is himself. I didn't get to see his second part on Tv but decided to buy it. I was not disappointed. This special is very funny.,1366588800,,359,4.070422535211268
5557710,4,B00B58FUBA,I purchased this after attending one of his shows locally here in Biloxi Mississippi. He really connected with the crowd that night and this was money well spent on that show. While some of the material here on the Aloha DVD is funny he does not appear to connect with the audience like he has done in previous dvd's. Don't get me wrong the dvd is funny just not as good as other shows transferred to dvd's.,1366416000,,407,4.298701298701299
5557711,5,B00B58FUBA,"As usual, Gabriel is hilarious!!!  His stories and sound affects are so amusing.  You will not be dissapointed in this DVD.  Enjoy!!!",1366329600,,133,4.954545454545454
5557712,5,B00B58FUBA,"Great show as always, never a dull moment with any of his comedy. That's why I chose to purchase rather then just rent it....",1366329600,,125,4.25
5557713,5,B00B58FUBA,A must have for any of his fans. His voice imitations are awesome and hilarious! His jokes about Hawaii are to die for!,1366156800,,119,4.217391304347826
5557714,5,B00B58FUBA,"My wife and I just recently saw him Live! @ Radio City Music @ NYC and the show was very similar in material to this one, which I expected since he mentioned it during the show...

This was pretty good and as much fun as watching him in person -if you are a fan already you will enjoy this show (also)... definitely recommend it, especially since I have seen it more than once already.",1366156800,,385,4.202702702702703

5557716,4,B00B58FUBA,Very funny - kept us entertained throughout the entire show.  Like his energy and perspective and that he apparently hasn't let fame go to his head.,1366156800,,148,4.6923076923076925
5557717,5,B00B58FUBA,"Gabriel Iglesias will definitely become one of the greatest comedians to hit the stage. In his new special, Aloha Fluffy, we get to see further into his personal life and the hilarious stories in which he has lived through. I will agree with some of the other reviewers that Aloha Fluffy should be watched after Hot and Fluffy, his special from Bakersfield.

The vibe from Aloha Fluffy was more of like a sequel to Hot and Fluffy. He delves deeper into his personal life and we get a more sense of the ""real"" fluffy in his Hawaii special. For pure comedic genius, Hot and Fluffy is where it's at. For the first time viewer, this Hawaii special may not be as big of a ""hit"" for you.

There were a couple of parts where the energy was low. Non-the-less, I laughed at all his jokes.

If you're a first timer to Fluffy, watch Hot and Fluffy first! That way, Aloha Fluffy will flow with your humor more now that you know it.",1366070400,7,919,4.3313953488372094
5557718,5,B00B58FUBA,"It doesn't matter how many times I watch his comedy specials I still laugh my butt off.  I love his material, especially the part about Hawaiian time being ""we'll get there when we get there"", I have only been to Hawaii once but that was one piece of information I learned pretty quick!  :)  Anyway, I highly recommend watching this, your stomach will hurt from laughing so much.",1365984000,,379,4.544117647058823
5557719,5,B00B58FUBA,"This dude is so funny. I hadn't seen any of Gabriel's previous work, and that makes me unhappy because I've missed out on watching one of the very best comics I've ever seen! BUY THIS! You won't regret it.",1365897600,,205,4.282051282051282
5557720,5,B00B58FUBA,Gabriel is always hilarious and I never miss a chance to watch him either live or on video. I have not bought any movies or dvds in the last 5 years but for Fluffy I made the exception.,1365724800,,185,3.8947368421052633
5557721,4,B00B58FUBA,"Watched the first installment on cable the other night - and immediately noticed the absence of his characteristic cartoon voices from earlier shows. Bummer! He's still pretty funny and there were some good laughs, but I have to admit it wasn't quite as funny as the older ones.",1365638400,,278,4.8125
5557722,5,B00B58FUBA,"Its Gabriel being Gabriel what can I say.
