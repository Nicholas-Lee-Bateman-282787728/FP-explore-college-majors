What would have been nice is if there was a photo gallery menu of Sherri on this dvd, but there's not.
Overall, I enjoyed watching Sherri. You see a differrent side of Sherri. She's sweet and funny. If your a die hard fan of Sherri, I say get it.",1365120000,,296,4.033898305084746
8456972,5,B0054RK1MG,"I always loved watching Sherri Martel as a Manager, now I'm glad to say that I know she was as nice in real life as she looked on TV, & She was very respectful of Male Wrestlers Wives because before she would Manage a Wrestler who was Married, she always went talk their Wife & let them know that she wasn't going to do anything but be there Manager, in other words, She always let them know that whatever she did was going to be Professional, & it was great hearing her talk about her real life Friendship with Robert Parker, & how years before they did a ""Love"" Storyline, which by the way was Funny, not Dirty, they were close Friends & lived  in the same Apartment Complex, & they would always visit each other, & just like Robert Fuller, she doesn't have anything bad to say about anybody, that's the best part of this Shoot Interview, no harsh criticism.",1364860800,,860,4.341614906832298
