8747887,3,B01AO6WLG0,"This movie provides a good argument for just staying at the airport if you've got some time to kill between flights! Unfortunately for the trio of friends in this German 'torture porn' flik - they decide to venture out into the streets of Frankfurt, Germany for a few hours B4 their plane takes off and, instead of 'killing time' - they end up 'meeting the reaper' in particularly nasty ways. The Germans have produced some gritty and grim 'horror' films over the years and this one ranks right up there - it reminded me of similar fare from the likes of Germanic U.G. indie film-maker Andreas Bethmann. Following in the foot-steps of the 'Hostel' franchise this 2009 production reprises many of Hostel's core elements: principally the concept of a group of innocent young tourists getting abducted into a weird snuff club environment that caters to rich sadistic deviants.

After a prologue that purports the 'story to be based upon true events' - The film starts in an up-beat  manner introducing the 'victims' via some hand-held cell phone videos taken by one of the group. The 'group' includes a guy and his black (blind !) GF and their female friend 'Dodo' - who is portrayed as a feisty individual. The 2 girlz are leaving on a holiday and the boy-friend is 'seeing them off' - with some trepidation about their safety. They all venture into a 'bar' that turns out to be a fetish club and things go 'south' rather quickly as they are confronted by some aggressive folks and next thing ya know they are all drugged and carted off to a remote subterranean lair where they become the unwilling participants in an organized ring of wealthy sadists who like to torture and kill other people for their own perverse enjoyment. The duration of the (relatively short 78 min.) run-time is devoted to the torments that the trio are subjected to.

The Director has filmed all of this nefarious action in a jerky hand-held fashion to give it a more 'realistic / snuff film' ambiance and the lighting and such are often intentionally dim and grainy. The S&M 'club' - ""Le Maison de le Petite Mort"" - is ruled over by a female domme that everyone refers to simply as 'Mom' and she is a nasty piece of work who really seems to hate men. The male of the tourist trio finds this out as he has his eye gouged out with a knife, is brutally castrated (in a particularly graphic cringe-worthy scene!!), and finally eviscerated. His two female companions don't make out a lot better but their tortures aren't quite as heavy-duty.

Whereas one might argue that Eli Roth's (original) ""Hostel"" had a bit of 'lightness' to it - ""Petite Mort"" certainly DOESN""T! I found this to be a pretty grim little bit of torture/horror porn with a nihilistic vibe from beginning to end. Despite some obvious attempts to build a 'rapport' with the victim characters in the plot - once everyone was in 'the dungeon' it became difficult to recognize who was who and there wasn't a lot of empathy developed for anyone. I'd imagine that fans of this type of stark gore-fest would enjoy this film because it is very graphic (at least in the 'un-censored/un-rated version!) - but I found it to be sorta un-engaging beyond the visceral imagery that it portrayed. Minimal female nudity in this one - however - nakedness IS displayed by the hapless male of the group as his junk getz sawed off (yeowch!) - German lang. w/ English subs. The only extra is the trailer for the film. Certainly not 'original' in its' concept - ""Petite Mort"" would doubtless appeal to anyone who thot that films like ""Hostel"" fell short of being violent and graphic enuf. Definitely NOT one for the kidees!",1469232000,3,3639,4.672386895475819
