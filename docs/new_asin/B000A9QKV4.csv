2382716,2,B000A9QKV4,"Buyer beware, the quality control on this and other strawberry shortcke dvd's is questionable. My daughters own all of the SS dvd's and at least half of them freeze up and shake, no matter what TV or dvd player it's on. Very frustrating, and disappointing for little ones. The stories are cute, just be aware of the return & exhange policy in case of this and other SS dvd items don't work correctly.",1134777600,6,400,4.493150684931507
2382717,5,B000A9QKV4,"1st Story: Not judging by appearance but by what's inside is taught by the 4 girls plus Huck, Apple and Blueberry (and a quick glimpse of the pets) using a spin off from Cinderella. Strawberry as Cinderella feels unworthy because of her tattered clothes but has a sweet heart and catches the eye of Prince Huck who sings to her about the lesson to be learned. Some sensitive viewers (my 4yr. old) will see Strawberry's tears and Blueberry, Ginger & Orange pretending to be mean.  Soda is in this story but not Peppermint.  She shows up in Strawberry's scrapbook and then again for a split second as a carriage driver.  2nd story: Don't judge a person before you get to know them, uses the 4 girls plus Peppermint & Blueberry meeting Rainbow.  The 5 girls are excited and friendly but Peppermint is mean, rude and rejects Rainbow's looks, way of living, etc. hurting her feelings and upsetting the other girls.  But Peppermint learns differences are important when Strawberry throws a party intending to ""trick"" Peppermint into seeing her mistake - it works. The fact that she comes around in the end is nice for young viewers but realistic? Who cares.  Honey is also in this story but only for one minute. Even though the DVD cover illustration does not in any way match what you see on TV (as with all SS videos) the stories, picture quality and especially the music still rate high.",1134345600,,1384,4.651639344262295
2382718,5,B000A9QKV4,"This is a great movie. It teaches children how to accept others for who they are, rather then laugh at them because they are different... Peppermint Fizz may be bratty at times (and lets face it nearly all kids go through a ""bratty"" phase), but after learning how to properly treat people she no longer makes fun of them for being different. I don't see how something that actually TEACHES children an important life lesson can be considered bad.",1130803200,5,446,4.658227848101266
2382719,3,B000A9QKV4,"My 3.5 year old daughter LOVES everything to do with Strawberry Shortcake and princesses so I thought she would flip over this DVD.  Indeed, she loves the first story on this DVD which is a take-off on the Cinderella story.  We've watched it like 10 times already.  However, she is less interested in the Peppermint Fizz story about not liking Rainbow Sherbet because she's ""not like me.""  It does have a message that people can be different and still be friends...but this part of the DVD doesn't appeal to my daughter quite as much.  She just wants to watch the princess part over again.  So a mixed review for us on this one!",1129852800,,628,4.513274336283186
2382720,2,B000A9QKV4,"The first story here is a Cinderella story with Strawberry Shortcake dressed up and playing Cinderella.  It was sweet, and my 3 1/2 year old liked it.  But the second story was about the gang meeting Rainbow Sherbet, and Peppermint Patty was a nasty little girl mean to and talking behind Rainbow's back because she is 'different' since she lives on a boat, saying that was the most rediculous thing she's ever seen, plus she dresses differently.  She was mean and Rainbow was crying.  Yeah, there is a lesson here as Strawberry tries to explain that if we were all the same how boring the world would be, but this is probably lost on my daughter as she's sitting there starting to get a bit bored by the slow story that comes off way too negative for the typical movies that are so upbeat and fun.  There is a contrived ending where Peppermint realizes she was wrong, but I still recommend the new Moonlight Mysteries way over this one-- that's my daughter's favorite.",1129852800,5,969,4.578034682080925
8076601,5,B000A9QKV4,I watched this when I was a kid. I absolutely love that my daughter is now a fan and likes watching it. Super cute movie that teaches friendship lessons and is entertaining for little ones. I highlused recommend it.,1460246400,,215,4.538461538461538
8076602,5,B000A9QKV4,"Am impressed by this company.  They provided the dvd fast, it is as described and when I erred in evaluating same, they followed up with me.  While my error, they were very generous in offering assistance.  I highly recommend them as a source for you Strawberry Shortcake dvd's",1339545600,,277,4.729166666666667
8076603,4,B000A9QKV4,"Of the two stories on this DVD, my daughter loves the Cinderella one. The second story is not as entertaining, it has a good lesson.. to accept people's differences.",1296000000,,165,4.724137931034483
8076604,5,B000A9QKV4,This Was The Best Dealer I Have Ever Delt With On Amazon I Had A Problem With My Orignal Order Working And She Sent Me Another One Free Of Charge And A Little Present For My Daughter,1288051200,,182,3.945945945945946
8076605,5,B000A9QKV4,I remember my daughter loving Strawberry Shortcake. I just had to get this for my granddaughter. I was great to watch.,1257465600,,118,4.666666666666667
8076606,1,B000A9QKV4,"My goodness!  My toddler is in love w/ her Strawberry Shortcake books and I rented this from the library becasue I thought she'd love it.  Well, she does, but I HATED it!

I can't stand the almost anime look, but mostly was horrified by the substance.  In one early scene, Orange Blossom and Gingersnap are arguing over a dress to wear to the ball.  They're the wicked step-sisters in this ""Cinderella"" episode.  They are obnoxious and bratty and there is no positive or correcting counterbalance to their nastiness.  Lo-and-behold, I overheard my daughter re-enacting the scene w/ her dollhouse people about an hour later.

That DVD is going back to the library tomorrow!  I'll stick to the books where I can determine the tone of voice used.",1177459200,,743,4.78740157480315
8076607,4,B000A9QKV4,"Just when I though I could not stand watching Belle, Ariel, Cinderella, Snow White or Jasmine ONE MORE TIME, along came Dress Up Days for my daughter's 4th birthday. It's adorable. Yes, it's contrived. Ever watched a sit com? Fake problem cheerfully resolved in a half hour? Sounds pretty contrived to me. MOST TV IS CONTRIVED! So all the ends are neatly wrapped up, with a lesson in friendship and morals. Is this the biggest problem with kids' TV today?

Personally, if I had an  hour to spend watching TV, it would not be Strawberry Shortcake, but I am not 4 years old, either. My kids LOVE this DVD, choose it often, and completely understood the lessons here: clothes do not make the person, don't judge a book by its cover, get to know the person within, it's fun to make new friends. What's not to like here? I only allow an hour per day of TV and strictly limit the content to age-appropriate, family-friendly viewing. I find that Strawberry Shortcake and friends are just fine for my girls to watch.

We bought our copy 8 months ago and have never had any problems with the DVD.",1156118400,,1087,4.50761421319797
8076608,4,B000A9QKV4,I have 4 yr old fraternal twin daughters and they both love Dress Up Days.  We own all of the Strawberry Shortcake series and this is one of their favorites.  Can't comment on the quality of the DVDs since we have VHS only.,1137974400,,223,4.162790697674419
8076609,2,B000A9QKV4,"We got about 5 minutes into the video when my 4 year old started crying, it had frozen, wouldn't work at all. We returned one, got a new one, it freezes too!  We have almost all the Strawberry Shortcake DVD's, and this is the ONLY one we have had a problem with, and the story looks so cute. I think the mass production on this one really got screwed up and I caution buyers to beware.",1136419200,3,385,4.065789473684211
8076610,1,B000A9QKV4,"I had to exchange this dress up days dvd since it kept freezing up . . . and when I put the ""new"" dvd in the player, the dvd wouldn't even load. For some reason many of the SS DVD's tend to skip and freeze, I suspect due to poor quality manufacturing. Save your $$ and rent this once from the video store for a weekend.",1135123200,4,319,3.8484848484848486
