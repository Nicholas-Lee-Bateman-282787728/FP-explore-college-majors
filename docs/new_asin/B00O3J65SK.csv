Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, Combat Zone Wrestling, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood with this event being their annual singles tournament with the winner being able to have any type of match against whoever they want in future.  It should also be noted that P.W.G. expanded the tournament to 24 competitors spread across three straight nights (first two nights were opening round while night three was the rest of the tournament) leading to various debuts & returns former TNA commentator Todd Kennley doing the ring introductions for the first night & having some fun at the expense of his former employers.

Night One:
Bobby Fish made his P.W.G. debut against the returning T.J. Perkins in a match that featured both men focused on grounded mat wrestling with various submissions being used along with series of counters & reversals focusing on a specific body part.  Tomasso Ciampa met Michael Elgin in a match that started off intense with a delayed vertical suplex & top rope tumbleweed to the outside in the opening minute and continued to the point where one move executed actually broke the ring in a specific area.  Other matches include the debut of Biff Busick vs. Roderick Strong in a back & forth match, Cedric Alexander vs. Trevor Lee in a match that the commentator described as ""the dropkick has been the story of this match"", the return of A.J. Styles vs. the debut of Brian Myers (WWE's Curt Hawkins) in an athletic contest that stayed on the mat & in the air, and the debut of Drew Gulak vs. Kyle O'Reilly in a very technical match that based off submissions & mat wrestling along with aggressive strikes.  Other non-tournament matches include P.W.G. Tag Team Champions World's Cutest Tag Team vs. Inner City Machine Guns vs. Christopher Daniels & Kazarian in their returns as individuals & their P.W.G. debut as a tag team in an evenly matched contest followed by a six man tag team featuring Mount Rushmore (Adam Cole & Young Bucks) vs. returning Kenny Omega & Chuck Taylor & the debuting Zack Saber Jr. in a match that featured non-stop action along with entertaining moments including a special appearance.

Night Two:
Candice LaRae faced off against Rich Swann who was looking to continue what they started from the previous night with him having a rare size advantage & didn't hold back including huge chops & even a pimp slap with Candice giving as much as she took & more.  ""Motor City"" met ""Inner City"" as Chris Sabin returned to P.W.G. to face Ricochet in a match where one man relied on a more technical style while the other was more high risk & strength oriented with both men being very impactful in what they executed.  Other tournament matches include Johnny Gargano vs. Chuck Taylor in a back & forth match that had some entertaining moments in the ring & the action taking place on the outside, Chris Hero vs. the return of Matt Sydal in a competitive match, Adam Cole vs. Zack Sabre Jr. in a back & forth encounter, and ACH vs. Kenny Omega in a match that so many references from video fighting games to one moment that had the crowd on it's feet for several minutes chanting ""STONE COLD ACH!""  Other non-tournament matches include the tag team debut of reDRagon vs. Drew Gulak & Biff Busick in a heavily submission & strike based match as all involved were known for their reputation as technical wrestlers along with Kaz & Daniels vs. Young Bucks where all four men had similar styles using unique double team & high risk offense plus taking advantage of the referee whenever possible leading to more than one innocent man being taken out by these two teams.

Night Three:
The last night of this event featured the last three rounds (quarter, semi, finals) of the tournament but was held under a ""blind bracket"" meaning that none of the competitors or audience knew who they were going to face each round in advance. Quarter final matches featured Johnny Gargano vs. Candice LaRae in a match that featured many series of reversals & counters along with attempts at submissions, T.J. Perkins vs. Ricochet with T.J. having a funny response to the chants he was originally receiving before going into a fast paced technical encounter with each man heavily targeting on area of the body, Michael Elgin vs. Trevor Lee that was big impactful offense from both men, Kenny Omega vs. Matt Sydal in a competitive contest, and A.J. Styles vs. Roderick Strong that saw a completely different side of Strong than we normally see from him that definitely left a controversial impression on the tournament in more ways than one, and Kyle O'Reilly vs. Zack Saber Jr. in a heavily mat wrestling submission based match.  The semi-finals were Trevor Lee vs. Johnny Gargano where both men traded momentum & kept chopping each other on the floor including their chairs broke followed by Ricochet vs. Kenny Omega in a very competitive match to the point where one man tried to show off on commentary only for another man to pay for it leading to the finals being a triple threat match with Ricochet vs. Gargano vs. Strong in a short match but filled with non-stop match with each man wrestling his opponents into exhaustion.  A non-tournament match featured Mount Rushmore vs. ACH & Brian Myers & Chris Sabin that saw so many moments including one man getting a receipt for the night before, a near fall happening by the most unexpected man in the match, and the worst ending to a crowd surf ever leading to the phrase uttered on commentary ""THIS IS CARNAGE!""  The other non-tournament match was a 10 man tag featuring Cedric Alexander & Biff Busick & Tommaso Ciampa & Bobby Fish & Drew Gulak vs. Chris Hero & Willie Mack & Joey Ryan & Rich Swann & Chuck Taylor with one of the match participants actually doing commentary during the match along with other moments such as who decided to twerk on the top rope & what Tomasso did that grossed everyone out leading to Chuck Taylor demanding that things slow down & got his request...literally.

In the end, each night was filled with quality action but the bonus of all the returns & debuts from talents allowing fresh new matches & different styles leading to this being on the biggest action packed wrestling events of the year that I recommend.",1414368000,2,6630,4.768090671316478
