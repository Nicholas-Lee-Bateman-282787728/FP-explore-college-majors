8413023,5,B0041KXJEY,"Cheap . . . but well-loved.

Here's the little I know about this:

1.  It was never aired in the U.S. or the U.K.  It was, however, aired to death in the Middle East, North Africa, and a couple of European countries.  Hence there's a lot of people who have a soft spot for it because they grew up with it.
2.  But the quality of the animation is not good.  However, it's better than a lot other low-budget animated specials.
3.  It is an adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""Old Curiosity Shop.""  You can learn more about it by going to the Piccola Nell page on the Italian Wikipedia.
4.  There are four discs herein.  Initially it's gonna look they didn't do a good job with them, but on closer inspection the quality of the transfer and the physical preparation of the discs are revealed to be of high quality.
5.  I do not know of any version anywhere of this available in English, even just as subtitles.  The edition you'll get from this Amazon page apparently comes from Italy:  you can choose to have the original Japanese audio or an Italian dub, and you can also choose between Italian subtitles or no subtitles.  And that's it for your language choices.",1329177600,3,1158,4.421800947867299
