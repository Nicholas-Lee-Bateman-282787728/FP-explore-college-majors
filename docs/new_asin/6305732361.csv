1064134,3,6305732361,"Admittedly I had sky-high expectations before watching Guinevere, but expectations are created to be met...and Guinevere falls short, given the track records of all involved.
The director is Audrey Wells, who wrote  the witty, lively The Truth about Cats and Dogs.  The cast includes Neil  Jordan's champion, the sublime Stephen Rea; future major-league actress  Sarah Polley, capable of both edginess and vulnerability; and Jean Smart,  perfect as an upper-class matron of  staggering viciousness.
What went  wrong?
A precious script that too often lapses into references to art and  anecdotes, for one.  A high-mindedness that drags like dead weight,  resulting in a sickeningly cheesy dream-sequence ending.  Some poor  supporting turns by the unversatile, pouty Gina Gershon, a shamefully  melodramatic Grace Una, and a lacklustre Sandra Oh, stuck with a minute  role.
The two main characters created in this film are truly memorable,  thanks to fascinating turns by Rea and Polley.  Polley captures her  character's tentativeness and bursts of personality beautifully, and Rea is  a marvel -- first cleverly straddling the line between heartfelt artist and  pedophilic exploiter, then showing off a touching vulnerability when  Connie's afflictions start catching up with him.
So why the low grade?  The ending, which romanticizes a relationship that was already powerfully  romantic, making the delicious subtext a sugary piece of blatant  advertisement; disgusting overuse of music; too many winks at  ""post-modern"", MTV-influenced technique (the jump-cut is one of  the most overrated devices in post-'90s film).  Guinevere lapses too easily  and too often into that dreaded situation of ""too much of a good  thing"", and ends up beating many of its own strengths to death.",953596800,7,1780,5.541044776119403

Guinevere is about an older photographer  be-friending and falling in love with Sarah Polley, who is a teenager. It's  a movie about two people coming together during a certain period in their  life - regardless of how old they are.

1064268,2,6305732361,"Crappy film posing as art. Older man, younger woman. Why does she want him? B/c he manipulates her constantly by promising to teach her the art of photography that throughout most of the movie she has no interest in learning. He calls her Guinevere, as he calls all his ""pupils"". She continues to let him call her that even when learning of all his other ""pupils"". Realistic in the way that the only way an older man could get a young girl to satisfy him and support his unemployment is through intense, cruel manipulation of a hopeless wanderer with the self-esteem of a gnat. The end was not realistic in the slightest. Loved Sarah Polley in ""My Life without Me"" but she did her career injustice by doing this film. And her grill looks so messed up.",1282521600,2,751,4.489051094890511
1064269,2,6305732361,"When I read Sarah Polley's remark about how ""Avonlea"" became too Americanized in its latter seasons, I didn't understand what she meant, so I decided to rent a couple of her movies to see how a Canadian influence was different than an American one, and since watching this (and ""The Sweet Hereafter""), I have to say, I am not impressed.  Sometimes indie films try to be so artsy-fartsy, they end up being overlong and boring, which is what this was, not to mention pointless.  A movie can be light on plot, but it still has to be entertaining, or at least though-provoking.  This was neither.  Jean Smart was the only interesting character in this entire film.  Harper Sloane (how pretentious a name is that?  Not saying I don't like it though) seems to have went through her entire life never being praised for anything (is that possible?), which is why it takes Connie Fitzpatrick, a very unattractive, old and washed-up, pseudo-intellectual photographer taking a flattering, candid picture of her, to give her confidence and help her find herself/her inner artist.  Connie was nothing more than a sleaze, picking up vulnerable young girls, turning them into his muses (an inexpensive, long-term prostitute) and then moving on to his next ""Guinevere"".  Had Harper had any self-esteem, this guy wouldn't have gotten her into his bed, even if Sarah Polley is somewhat homely.

Jean Smart's character, though a lush, was lucid enough to understand why Connie went for the young girls (besides the obvious physical reason), and that is because of their awe.  To someone like me, a grown woman, I would see through the intellectual, sensitive artist facade, but to someone younger just starting college, probably on their own for the first time, he would seem hip and sophisticated.

The closing scene where all the Guineveres (which I likened to a group of polygamous sister-wives) get together for a reunion is just silly, and the afterlife ending was absurd.  Was there a particular reason, or symbolism, why he dabbled in every color of the rainbow (all the different hues and races of the women he screwed)?  This movie took itself way too seriously.",1267142400,2,2152,4.92797783933518
1064270,4,6305732361,"I had the unbelievable good fortune to stumble upon Guinevere, starring Sarah Polley and Stephen Rea, this week. I really enjoyed this movie.

Polley plays Harper, a young, insecure woman on the brink of attending Harvard Law School. At her sister's wedding, she meets Connie Fitzpatrick, an aging wedding photographer. He strikes up an easy rapport with her, guessing quickly that she's not cut out for law school and flattering her with a compliment or two. Connie also slyly accommodates her request not to be photographed in the traditional wedding shots, but he surprises her with a beautiful portrait that he took (featuring only her) in an unguarded moment. When Harper visits Connie to thank him for the portrait, he invites her to stick around with him and learn about . . . art.

Before she knows it, Harper is chucking the idea of law school and moving in with her new lover. The two seem oddly happy together, though Harper's own low self-esteem and Connie's need for adulation are more than a little self-destructive. Harper soon discovers that she's one in a string of Connie's many ""pupils"" - all young, all insecure, all taken in by his talk of art and his Irish accent. Connie has fed them all the same lines, tried to inspire all of them to create art, called them all his ""Guinevere."" Despite that, however, Harper decides Connie's a better bet than her own dysfunctional family of backbiting lawyers. As the viewer knows from the start, Connie and Harper must eventually have a sad parting.

The film comes full circle four years later, when news that Connie has been stricken with illness reaches his former loves. The women all gather (without malice, no less) to say goodbye, and, strangely enough, most of them have gone on to become accomplished artists - painters, photographers, etc.

I thought this movie was very interesting and very well-done. The characters are not always likable - Harper, jealous of her older sister's close relationship with her father, runs to Connie as a substitute; Connie, though an excellent photographer, is also an old lech with too much of a taste for girl-flesh; Harper's family is made out to be an intelligent but thoroughly hatable group whose main characterization is their vocation - law.

Rea and Polley hold the film deftly in ther capable hands, and their performances are wonderful. I'm beginning to really love Polley. I thought she was stunning in My Life Without Me and I LOVED her in The Weight of Water. Jean Smart provides a biting turn as Harper's mother.

Though there is a little nudity, some sexual content, and plenty of profanity in this one, I thought it was very much worth watching.",1220140800,,2666,4.8355263157894735
1064271,4,6305732361,"Sarah Polley fans, especially ones going all the way back to ""Ramona"", are generally big-time ""Guinevere"" (1999) fans simply because it is the film in which she peaked physically. And Director Audrey Wells picked up on this during casting, seeing in Polley (at that time of her life) someone physically perfect to play her heroine Harper Sloane. Wells needed a young woman who simply glowed in front of the camera, whose face looked better ""without"" make-up, and who projected both innocence and restlessness. With Polley she also got a bonus, one of the most talented actresses of her generation.

In this sense Wells resembles Alfred Hitchcock, a director with an uncanny ability to identify actresses at the one moment of their lives when they are physically perfect for a particular role. Sylvia Sidney in ""Sabotage"", Nova Pilbeam in ""Young and Innocent"", and Joan Fontaine in ""Rebecca"" come to mind.

Wells, who also wrote ''The Truth About Cats and Dogs'', captures that moment in some young women's lives (yes, the film could be considered a feminist statement) when they are able to break free of expectations and programming. The Harper Sloane character seems so authentic and the portrayal so lacking in glib cynicism that it most likely has a lot of autobiographical elements.

Harper is tracking along toward Harvard Law School when she meets Cornelius Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea), a middle-aged Irish artist who has been hired to photograph her sister's wedding. His well-practiced seduction technique and irreverent world-view causes a major attitude adjustment and she abandons her career track to become his protg and lover.

The story is told from Harper's point of view and the viewer soon learns along with her that this is not the traditional ""Pygmalion"" scenario. While not exactly a rogue and a rou, ""Connie"" is a compulsive Henry Higgins who has repeatedly played this game with repressed young women. He goes into these relationships with a five-year time limit.

Consistent with the POV factor, Harper's story is told with intelligence and compassion, with a lot of emphasis on the fragility of a first love and the pain of a trust betrayed. The film's feminist slant is revealed not so much by what is explicitly shown but by its failure to bring any dimensionality to Connie's character. No clues are provided to explain his aversion to a long-term commitment, Harper discovers that his promises are empty ones but she never learns the roots of his insecurities.

Although Polley's best scenes are those with Carrie Preston, who plays her best friend and confidante; the most entertaining scenes are those with her mother (Jean Smart), an unstated version of Susan's mother on ""Seinfeld"". The dysfunctional nature of Harper's family and her mother's unfulfilled life are slowly and somewhat comically revealed, but the bottom line is that her mother is sincerely trying to shield her daughter from mistakes.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1188345600,2,2979,5.092213114754099
1064272,5,6305732361,"I'd highly recommend this film to anyone, but especially to any

female artist, musician, actor who has come of age.  This isn't

so much about a May-December romance:  it is about the student/mentor bond which can be incredibly strong and intense,

and an aging artist who through Harper, is trying to hold onto

his past youth and the artistic potential he once had.

This could have been such a sappy movie, but the acting and writing kept that from happening.  I agree with another reviewer - it was NOT predictable, and the acting was so real.

Sarah Polley is great, but Stephen Rea absolutely broke my heart.

These characters were not romanticized: they were multi-dimentional, human.  There was good and not so good about them.

Connie Fitzgerald did manipulate and seduce Harper, but it was also clear that he really loved her.  It was clear as well, that Harper knew what she was getting herself into and it was her choice ultimately.

My only reservation was that some of the family members (father,

sister) were one-dimensional to the point where it was hard to

believe.  Perhaps that was how Harper saw them, or perhaps that

was done to set-off the volatile emotional intensity of the mother (Jean Smart, who was also good), and the repressed/about-to-emerge artistic intensity of Harper.

I am a die-hard Stephen Rea fan after seeing this film.",1121126400,11,1362,4.843478260869565
1064273,4,6305732361,"At first glance this film seems like a bad American TV movie, it is certainly shot like one. However 10 mins in you start to realise that this film has a little bit more going for it than that. The film follows the story of a girl in her early 20s and her journey into adulthood. On the way she falls for an older man, battles her parents and gets more than a glimce into the life of an artist. This film is perfect for anyone struggling with artistic asperations, think ""American Beauty"" meets ""Lost in Translation."" That's all you need to know, now go buy it!",1121126400,2,561,4.252336448598131
1064274,3,6305732361,"The best scene in ""Guinevere"" belongs to Jean Smart and it is also the scene that exposes the fatal flaw in this 1999 drama from writer-director Audrey Wells (""Under the Tuscan Sun"").  Smart plays Deborah Sloane, who has discovered that her 20-year-old daughter Harper (Sarah Polley) is shacked up with Connie Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea), a photograph and drunk (not always in that order) who is older than Deborah.  Harper is the latest in a series of young girls that Connie has taken under his wing as his ""Guinevere,"" but Deborah does not know about all that.  What she knows is that someone older than she is happens to be having sex with her daughter, and Deborah has a theory as to why this is happening and why Connie does not like women his own age.  When she asks what Harper has that she does not, her answer is ""awe.""  Harper can look at Connie with awe, whereas Deborah, who has been around, cannot.  The problem is that neither can we.

You have to understand that Deborah is a rather unsympathetic figure in this film, destroying a dinner with her family by her insistence that they read the fortunes in their fortune cookies and add ""in bed"" to the end.  But she is devastating right about Connie and that is why this film does not work for me.  I have no problem with the idea that a story about an artist who goes through a series of young women who act as his muses and protgs.  We meet most of the rest of these Guineveres during the course of the film and some of them are played by Gina Gershon, Sandra Oh and Jasmine Guy.  But what we do not get to see is any evidence that Connie is any sort of artistic genius.  There are some decent black & white photographs but basically you have to take the film's position that he is worth of emulation let alone awe.  The most demonstrative talent Connie shows in the film is to (euphemism warning) make her extremely happy while she is still dressed (okay, not so much a euphemism as being extremely vague).

There is even less of an idea in the film that Harper would be a worthy protg, or muse for that matter.  This is rather odd because as an actress Sarah Polley usually makes her characters seem pretty smart (not Julia Stiles smart but certainly in the Jodie Foster range), and here she only comes across as clueless without a sense of direction.  Connie must look better to Harper than her family or going to Harvard, but that is not really saying much, and when we see her at the end of the film and she is clearly a confident young woman, there is no real reason to give Connie the credit.  So I cannot help but think that if Connie wants to do the Svengali routine, he could do better than Harper.  If I am thinking that, then clearly ""Guinevere"" is not working despite the solid cast.  The fault is not in the performances, but in the script.

Admittedly the problem can be that I am of the wrong gender to appreciate a film that is essentially a female coming of age story.  Certainly that is an almost microscopic movie genre in comparison to male coming of age stories (which might actually cover most movies being made today now that I stop and think about it).  I also have a problem with the idea that given a choice between Jean Smart and Sarah Polley (abstracted to the general level of a woman in her forties versus a woman in her twenties) the choice is obvious, and that would be because I know what the former has that the latter does not.  But the main complaint remains that while I might be able to buy Harper and Connie are lovers I cannot accept them as student and teacher, and ultimately that is what is supposed to make ""Guinevere"" more than just another older man/younger woman movie, even if it is told from her perspective.",1115251200,5,3721,4.4

The age difference here wasn't the only issue, oddly enough--rather it was the strange turns that inevitably develop between people who knowingly enter a relationship where tutoring is an intended part of the romance.  Rea's artist has a long history of shacking up with young women and turning them into ""true"" artists, be they painters, sculptors, dancers, or in Polley's case, photographers.  And although I normally would balk at the willingness with which these women handed themselves over to Rea's well-worn lines and drunken philosophies, _Guenevere_ managed to avoid the squeamishness that I feel, for example, whenever I see Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones together.  Be sure to pay attention to Jean Smart's dead-on analysis of daughter Polley and Rea's relationship; it's eloquent and brutal.",1010534400,12,1070,5.5

1064367,1,6305732361,"I felt as though some writer in Hollywood was desperately trying to convince me the lifestyle of this sleezebag was desirable and could even be realistic. This movie wants me to believe for at least two long hours that a dirty, old man actually convinces about 6 or so young women to live with him 5 yrs consecutively and in chronological order AND for the writer to think this  is to be considered even plausible to any jab at reality is absurd--(once the girls get a little too ripe it's perfectly natural to dump them and of course only the cool girl walks away calmly without an objection)  If that isn't enough of some writer's fantasy, then all of the young girls gather at the brooding intellectual's death to show him their breasts for one last hurrah. It is at this point the writer wimps out while trying to give the film a sensitive feel good explanation about the end of a man who doesn't know God and I'm afraid whose end in real life, not fantasy, would probably have been a little more frightening than having his own picture taken. The simpering explanation of the end of life reminded me of conversations with evolutionists trying to explain the ""moment"" life begins. The stammer at the explanation of death is not surprising for this writer. Obviously it would have been wiser to leave the subject of death out of the film since the ability of the writer to deal with it was like a big blue candle on top of a Volkswagon bug:the main object is okay(not great) , but it really looks stupid with the finishing touch!

1064368,3,6305732361,"A young woman living in San Francisco, who has just been accepted to Harvard, decides upon another path after meeting and falling under the influence of an older man, an artist, in ""Guinevere,"" written and directed by Audrey Wells.  Sarah Polley stars as Harper Sloane, who lives with her career oriented, rather self-absorbed family-- her parents, Alan (Francis Guinan) and Deborah (Jean Smart), and her older sister, Susan (Emily Procter).  Rather self-conscious and unsure of herself, Harper has allowed her parents to plan her future-- a career in law, though it is decidedly against her own wishes.  Then at Susan's wedding she meets the photographer, Connie Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea), an artist, who quickly gains her confidence and lures her into his own bohemian lifestyle.  She moves in with him (unbeknownst to her parents, who think she's staying with a friend for awhile), and he becomes her mentor; she is his ""Guinevere,"" and the only demands he makes of her is that she ""create"" something every day.  The choice of her artistic endeavors is entirely up to her; photography, painting, writing, dancing.  but she must create.
 Inevitably, of course, their relationship develops beyond the mentor/protege stage, and she learns some things about him that ultimately lead to complications.  And she discovers that her reign as Queen Guinevere may not be all that she had expected it to be.
 Wells convincingly presents the allurement of a lifestyle free of constraints and overwhelming demands, which makes it quite understandable that the indecisive Harper would choose to go with Connie, rather than adhere to the wishes of her parents, who are rather cold and impersonal and altogether controlling (especially her mother).  The fact that Alan dotes on Susan and could seemingly care less about Harper, as well as Deborah's apparent lack of actual concern for Harper, qualifies the facility with which Harper is able to effect her plans so readily.  And even when Deborah finds out what Harper is up to (which, of course, was inevitable), she seems to take it as a personal affront more than anything, and is content with merely denigrating the relationship into which her daughter has entered, rather than even trying to change it, which ostensibly at least, would  be the appropriate reaction of a concerned parent.
 Polley is well cast as Harper, as physically and emotionally she is able to fit Harper's profile perfectly, and she gives a credible performance, though given her unassuming manner and fairly nondescript appearance, it says more about Connie than it does about her.  And what you have already been able to deduce about Connie from his pursuit of Harper is further underscored during a scene in which Deborah confronts him with her views on the situation (which is arguably the most powerful scene in the film).
 Rea is perfectly cast, as well, affecting a patient, reserved manner, touched with an almost forlorn weariness evocative of a certain wisdom-of-the-world attitude that makes Harper's attraction to him believable.  And as the story unfolds, he very subtly allows you to see more of what lies beneath the surface until, in the end, you have a concise picture of who Connie really is.  It's a fine, understated performance, and a good bit of work by Rea.
 In a supporting role that demands mention, Jean Smart gives a smoldering performance as Deborah, a woman of seemingly insatiable needs and an overwhelming desire to dominate.  And Smart plays it perfectly, from the look in her eye to the telling way she carries herself, making the most of her limited screen time and making Deborah the most memorable character of the film.
 The supporting cast includes Gina Gershon (Billie), Paul Dooley (Walter), Carrie Preston (Patty), Tracy Letts (Zack), Sharon McNight (Leslie), Sandra Oh (Cindy), Grace Una (April) and Jasmine Guy (Linda).  Though not a film with which you can get too emotionally involved, ""Guinevere"" has it's moments and does manage to maintain interest.  The characters are real enough, but they evoke a sense of ambivalence; these are not people you are necessarily going to like or dislike.  In the final analysis, it's a good film, and worth seeing-- but with the possible exception of Smart's character, there is nothing especially memorable or compelling about it.",989107200,,4327,5.097733711048159

1064370,3,6305732361,"I was really impressed with this movie, but wasn't a big fan of the very artificial scenes that provided the movie's epilogue (for me they really robbed the story of its power). Other than that, though,  ""Guinevere"" is a gem, and a unique one.  It's beautifully photographed, and although the story itself is bittersweet and deals with a cliched situation, nothing about what we see is a cliche.  Audrey Wells has written a wonderful script here, warm and funny, sensitive, and very honest, and it's gorgeously acted by Polley and Rea.
Polley's sweet, nervous, and insecure Harper is the key to the story -- awkward and shy and filled with self-doubt, she's really unlike anyone I've ever seen Polley play -- her characters, even in Atom Egoyan's films, are usually so confident. It's fun to see her act the goofy kid here, giggly and nervous and all hands and feet.
And Stephen Rea (whom I've loved ever since ""Crying Game"") is equally good, and in fact probably has the tougher job of making us like this guy who really should be fairly repellent.  The fact that he somehow remains someone to care about -- that the script cares enough not to make him a villain, but a complex person - really elevates the film to another level.  Whether or not it's a comfortable topic, his character does honestly care about Harper, and he is one of the few characters in the film who seems to realize how special she is.
""Guinevere"" also features a gorgeous soundtrack by Christophe Beck (and featuring Sarah Polley on vocals!), is beautifully photographed (Polley has never looked prettier), and features a great supporting cast.  Jean Smart, as Polley's onscreen mother, is especially worth noting:  She turns in a performance so biting and proper and acidic and yet secretly painful that if she isn't nominated for a supporting actress Oscar, there is no justice. Her big scene with Rea is, on its own, worth the price of the film.",970012800,2,1922,4.753753753753754

Stephen Rea portrays the manipulative Svengali with his usual glazed, expressionless mask (one of those actors who directs all his energy into the character's ""rich inner life"", or just a consistently wooden performer? Discuss). Sarah Polley gives an understated performance as Rea's young ""student"".Some of Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"" territory is also retread, but the performances are compelling enough to keep your interest. There is a near Oscar-worthy supporting performance from Jean Smart, as Polley's outspoken mother, who really eats up her limited screen time; she is quite memorable in a key confrontation with Rea's character where she verbally takes him apart, but in a sly and subtle fashion. The movie is marred by slight over-length and a final scene that seems out-of-place and a bit too theatrically ""stagey""; but definitely is worth a look on a slow night.",969840000,3,1232,5.323076923076923

His seduction is not really about sex,  although that is part of it. Instead, it is more of an emotional seduction  that involves his creating a symbiotic mentor/protg relationship that  puts him in control while feeding his ego. His latest conquest is Harper  Sloane (Sarah Polley), a recent college grad from a wealthy family who is  all set to go to Harvard Law School. Clearly lonely and vulnerable and not  used to the attention of men, she falls prey to the charms of this free  spirited older man and eschews law school to run off with him and live the  artsy life.
Director/writer Audrey Wells, whose best previous writing  credits were for ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" does an  excellent job bringing this story to the screen in her directing debut. Her  shooting of the scenes was sensitively done and brought forth a lot of the  emotional elements of the story and the characters. It is clear that this  was a labor of love for Wells, but as is often the case, directing one's  own work takes away the objectivity about the script leaving most of the  plot problems intact.
It is believable that an insecure girl could be  lured into a relationship by a charming older man who overtly appreciates  her and believes in her abilities. May/September romances (or more aptly in  this case April/August) are common and usually happen for all the reasons  depicted here. The biggest problem with the story was the introduction of  Billie (Gina Gershon), one of Connie's earlier alumni, so early in the  story. Billie warns Harper of the specific manipulative lines that Connie  uses repeatedly with each of his love interests, almost by rote. She gives  great detail right down to the way he touched her and the fact that he  calls them all Guinevere.
At that point, Harper does exactly what one  might expect, she leaves him. Shortly thereafter, the story loses all  credibility as she eagerly goes running back to him, knowing full well that  she is being totally and impersonally manipulated. The entire relationship  after that waits for an emotional explosion that never comes. The whole  thing just sort of withers away with the eventual breakup being no more  than a fait accompli. The breakup scene was weak and cowardly, which  detracted greatly from the dramatic potential. If Wells had put Billie's  scene closer to the end of the story to create the last straw it would have  been more effective.
Wells also misses a great opportunity to add  fireworks by not emphasizing Harper's relationship with her mother (Jean  Smart). There was a natural emotional tension between the two and she was  the one character who had complete clarity about the relationship. Finally,  without giving too much away, the gathering of the five Connie alumni at  the end was a bit goofy and highly implausible given the gravity of the  situation. However, Wells does eventually redeem herself with a good ending  and some of the best imagery of the film.
Sarah Polley was well cast in  this film and exuded the pure naivety of a young woman inexperienced in the  ways of love. She was wonderfully awkward and vulnerable and it was very  believable that she could fall prey to the ministrations of an older man.  Polley has a Winona Ryder quality about her and has excellent potential as  an actress. It remains to be seen if she can break out of the role of  quirky teen.
Stephen Rea was hopelessly miscast in this role. He didn't  have the emotional horsepower to play this character. His acting is  somewhat stoic and wooden and this character needed to be charming,  passionate and obsessive. The part required an actor more like Michael  Caine.
The best performance of the film goes to Jean Smart as Harper's  outspoken and gregarious mother. She completely steals the movie with her  confrontational scene with Connie, explaining to him why he can't make it  with women his own age. She is terrific in every scene she is in and the  fortune cookie scene is fantastic.
Overall, I rated this film a 7/10.  This film will probably be most appealing to men over 50 and women under  25. None of the flaws were fatal, but the pace was slow and the plot  implausible in parts. That detracted from an otherwise engaging story and  some very good technical filmmaking.",955929600,3,4446,4.7902374670184695

I couldn't find a sloppy phrase anywhere. Harper Sloane (Sarah Polley), an awkward beauty, who struggles for the bon mot, has a knowing grin that suggests she's smarter than she lets on. She's set to be 21 in a bit. Connie Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea) is a 50 plus fine art photographer, who turns into a wedding photographer when the rent is due. He clearly has a thing for this young woman, whom he, at once, names Guinevere. The why of his nomenclature becomes clear.  He quickly assumes the role of her self-ordained mentor; she his unintended apprentice and lover.  There is much more to this film than first meets the eye. It's smart and insightful and quite successfully executed. The cast is well-chosen, the acting impressive.  I leave the rest of the story to you. Applause to cast and crew.

The family relationships, both real and ""adopted"", kind of draw you in.  I would tell you that there wasn't any slow,boring bits in this movie. Definitely recommend it. If you take a chance on Guinevere and DON'T like it much, at least catch the last scene.... it's strange...... and Wonderful!",1375833600,,418,4.726027397260274
