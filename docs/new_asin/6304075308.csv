7860366,4,6304075308,"Like the 1960's classic film, ""Mind's Eye"" has one of the main characters programmed to assassinate a visiting Klingon governor.  This is one of the rare occasions where the story line rests squarely on the shoulders of Geordi la Forge (Levar Burton).  While it doesn't allow him much of a stretch, Burton does get such much-needed screen time in a show with seven principals.  Veteran actor Larry Dobkin provides an air of respectability as a Klingon ambassador that may not be as he appears.
This installment of the series has the distinction of being one where the ominous, shadow-laden Romulan commander appears.  Her identity when revealed will prove to be one the show's most memorable and surprising revelations.",1047081600,,719,5.067796610169491
7860367,3,6304075308,"En route to the planet Risa, Geordi is kidnapped by Romulans who want to make the Klingons and the Federation bitter enemies.  Rigging his visor to send his brain instructions to murder a prominent klingon, LaForge returns  to the Enterprise unaware of the incident.  Data senses E-band emissions  aboard the ship, but will he stop Geordi in time?",963792000,5,347,4.931034482758621
7860368,4,6304075308,"Well, now, this is quite a surprise. Seems like I'm not the only one who has acquired this ""Next Generation"" Star Trek collection. Because the last time I checked this page on this site (I access Amazon.com almost  daily, by the way), there were no existing reviews. However, I do indeed  fully agree with the previous individial's opinions that this is a great  set which deserves to be continued. It begins with ""A Measure Of A  Man"", where Data fights for his right to be free in a JAG courtroom,  then there's ""The Offspring"", where Data uses new positronic  technology to create a ""daughter"", after that, ""Hero  Worship"", where Data rescues a boy from a shipwreck, and the boy copes  with the loss of his parents by imitating Data's looks and mannerisms, and  finally, the two-part ""Descent"", where Data's evil twin brother  (there's a passe cliche if there ever was one) returns and manuipulates  Data's and the Borg's actions and emotions with a chip that their creator  made. I had bought this video set at a local Suncoast because I had wanted  to have both parts of ""Descent"" to own. I enjoy these episodes a  great deal, and I would also like to see a second set released, possibly  including either ""The Schizoid Man"", ""In Theory"",  ""Masks"", ""Inheritance"", ""Datalore"",  ""Brothers"", ""The Most Toys"", ""Phantasms"",  ""Time's Arrow"", ""A Fistful Of Datas"", and especially  ""Data's Day"". This set is definetly quite entertaining to watch,  and I hope to acquire more great STTNG material in the future. Get this  soon, it's quite ""intriguing""!",948931200,51,1548,4.876923076923077
7860369,5,6304075308,"Fans of Brent Spiner, AKA Commander Data, will love this gift set of some of Data's best episodes, including ""Measure of a Man"", ""Hero Worship"", ""The Offspring"", and the two-part Data/Lore  episode ""The Descent"" (which also includes the re-appearace of  the Borg, Hugh).  The videos are clean and beautifully mastered; and the  packaging (complete with an outer box and inner box featuring a full-face  portrait of Data on both, and an ""information wheel"" which gives  a short synopsis of each episode featured in the set)is sturdy, easy to  display on any bookshelf, and in full color.  All of it does Spiner and his  fans proud.  I'm looking forward to seeing if they come out with a  ""Set 2"" (with, hopefully ""Brothers"", ""A Fist Full  of Datas"" and other episodes included).  I'd buy it in a microsecond.  This is worth the money, people.  It's a great gift -- even if you're just  buying it for yourself.",948326400,12,908,4.7612903225806456
