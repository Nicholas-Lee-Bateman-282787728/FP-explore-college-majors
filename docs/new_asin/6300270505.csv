305244,2,6300270505,"since i've never heard of it, and being an american of irish-catholic decent naturally i was excited! with an  amazon ""5 star"" rating, i was ready for something like ""in the name of the father"" or ""michael collins"" or like caliber. unfortunetly this film (athough somewhat interesting) was nowhere near that quality. this film once again proves my theory,""If you've never heard of it there's a reason for it!!!",1080691200,3,410,4.942028985507246
305245,5,6300270505,"A sad but engaging story about a sensitive young Irish lad, who reluctantly works for the local IRA, and helps kill a policeman, only to later find himself befriended by the man's unsuspecting family.  The saddest thing about this movie is how little has changed since it was made.  Nice chance to see Helen Mirren early in her career.",1039478400,12,335,4.661016949152542

305349,5,6300270505,"I had been looking for this movie in a proper (USA-compatible) format for YEARS! I first watched it over a decade ago--love the story, love Helen Mirren--and had bought the VHS. This DVD played beautifully, and I'm so pleased I can watch this movie--and share it with friends--whenever I want. Thank you!!!",1399507200,8,306,4.903846153846154
305350,4,6300270505,"Storyline on fringes of reality, but as in other of Helen Mirren's work, is very believable and deep. Much of the low-key plot development is not without realization of ""something's around the corner"", which seems to be a hallmark of Ms. Mirren's impressive career. Level of anticipation is built tastefully and one isn't quite aware of how involved one has become (not hard on the blood pressure).",1389139200,,398,4.955223880597015
305351,3,6300270505,"The film is okey, although it doesn`t meet the thrill of the book.
There is one big disadvantage: the film only has subtitles in Spanish and Korean.",1357516800,,148,4.518518518518518
305352,1,6300270505,"Incorrect item sent.  I thought I would receive a cd that played in American cd players, but actually received one that was for another region - not ours.",1347926400,,154,4.5
305353,5,6300270505,"I first saw this movie after watching Siskel and Ebert give this ""two thumbs up"" back in 1983. I was captivated by the story and felt empathy for the dire predicaments of both Cal and Marcella. The favorable prior reviews of this film explain the plot. Following the movie, I read the book Cal by Bernard MacLaverty and have become a devoted reader of his works. I strongly recommend the book Cal, to which the film was faithful.",1297641600,,429,4.512820512820513
305354,4,6300270505,It's too bad that this isn't available on DVD. It's a must for anyone who really wants a full Mirren library.,1273363200,,109,4.238095238095238
305355,5,6300270505,"This is one of the saddest, most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  John Lynch and Helen Mirren give radiant performances and bring human faces to the struggle that is no-win for everyone.  The members of the IRA are shown at once as monsters and victims and neither ever becomes the dominant way to view those who carry on the violence.  Mark Knopfler wrote the soundtrack -- it only adds to the poignancy of the film.  You can't miss w/ this one.",1163808000,6,447,4.481481481481482
305356,4,6300270505,"I saw Cal when it came out in 1984 at the Harvard Square Theatre, back when it specialized in classic American films, what we call now independent films, and small foreign movies.  That theatre in this form doesn't exist anymore, nor do films like this one.  The demise of both is a shame.  The fact that there is no DVD version of Cal speaks to how even today a film with the scope and subject of this particular one might seem less than economically viable to a distributor.  Like the wonderful short novel it is based upon, and adapted no less by the novelist himself, Bernard MacLaverty, Cal is a bleak, dark film--depressing even.  How could a film about the Troubles in Northen Ireland not be?  Nonetheless, it is a beautifully filmed movie, its scope honed down to the bone so that through the story of Cal McCluskey, reluctanct IRA getaway driver, and his terrible guilt for his role in the assassination of a local Protestent cop, followed by his love for the dead man's widow, Marcella, we see the whole awfulness, madness, and tragedy of the Troubles.  That's a lot for a film this small to accomplish, yet it does, all the while never overstepping its modest style and approach.  What makes this film work is the artfully understated performances by all its cast, but in particular John Lynch as the inarticulate young man at the center of the story.  Then there is Dame Helen Mirren in one of her early film roles.  She's young here, younger than you remember her ever being, but she is still Helen Mirren, one of the great actors in contemporary film.  And in the unflashy role of the young widow, she is, naturally, excellent.  So is the haunting, Gaelic tinged score by Mark Knopfler, one of his best.  Is this a great film? No.  But it is a film that is uncompromising about what it wants to do: to show how war and bigotry affect the innocent.  If you want that kind of movie, then this is worth spending 5 dollars on.  Or much more.",1160265600,6,1951,4.5
305357,5,6300270505,"This superb gem deals with the tribulations, disappointments and disillusions once the ideals face against the crude reality. John lynch is Cal a teenage boy who wants to sever his ties with the IRA. But the other side of the dramatis personae resides precisely in the fact, the widow of the policeman he helped murder, falls in love with him and he doubts if he must tell the sordid story or not.

Helen Mirren won her First Prize in Cannes as best actress in 1984 with this towering performance; (the second Prize in 1995 was awarded by The madness of King George). Ambitious and mature film that share all honors together with Hidden Agenda of Ken Loach.

A legendary icon of the Eighties.",1135468800,10,692,4.617886178861789

7808969,5,6300270505,"Movie was amazing & the seller first class will be ordering more from this Gentleman. However on a product review the transfer from  VHS to DVD was very poor . Picture & sound quality was awful.
This of course is no fault of the seller I will continue to buy my discs from him.
Great customer service, & delivery time was spot on.",1456012800,,330,4.238095238095238
7808970,5,6300270505,"I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it in the late 1980s and was delighted to find it on DVD.  The music alone is enough to keep me coming back to watch it again and again (I also bought the soundtrack), as its sorrowful poignancy illustrates so well the heartbreak of ""troubled Northern Ireland"" of that time.  Largely undiscovered (at that time) Helen Mirren and John Lynch commit themselves to authentic if unorthodox roles as ""star-crossed"" lovers; I became a fan of both immediately upon watching this film and haven't stopped following them since.  I got one of my first tastes for the Irish ""situation"" from this film and have gone on to become a student of its development.  ""Cal"" is a great place for anyone who wants to understand the conflict to start.  It will haunt you forever.",1454025600,4,806,4.608391608391608
7808971,5,6300270505,"Not a movie with a happily ever after ending, but I saw it when it was first released and I remembered it.",1446681600,,106,3.8636363636363638

7808973,5,6300270505,"This is a well-acted, sad story of a group of Irish people, during the ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland, and deals with assassination, guilt and trying to keep a crime secret.  Helen Mirren was quite young then, and marvellous in her role as the widow of a Belfast policeman,  It is interesting to see a very young John Lynch (the senior policeman, Jim Burns,in The Fall) playing without a beard and with long, flowing, hair.
It was a pity not to find this film on DVD, but the VHS was fine, as I have retained my VCR just in case I wanted to replay my many video cassettes.",1436745600,,572,4.336448598130841
