While watching the DVD, I remembered there were scenes with Dessie's father, played by Joss Ackland, that were not included. It is also not the same aspect ratio as the PBS version.",1108771200,12,294,4.9
1677946,5,B00005YUND,"Unlike many Shakespeare enthusiasts, I adore modern adaptations and staging of Shakespeare's works.  One of the reasons his plays have endured is that they have a timeless quality that is understood generation after generation.  His stories capture something essential about human nature that cannot be confined to a historical period.

Some modern versions of Shakespeare use original dialogue with updated settings, costumes, and character relationships.  This sometimes works very well, as in Ethan Hawke's Hamlet or the Julie Taymor's Titus (my favorite).  In this version of Othello, however, the dialogue has been modernized to match the setting.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I saw it in a class on Shakespeare's Tragedies at Syracuse University which was taught by a reknowned Shakespeare scholar.  This was her choice as the best film version of Othello to show us.  Othello is a story which translates particularly well into a modern version because it deals with issues such as racism, jealousy, and insecurity that make it applicable to a variety of situations.  The acting in this movie is excellent - very believable and powerful.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether or not you have previous experience with Othello.",1102377600,17,1249,5.321428571428571
1677947,5,B00005YUND,"I first saw this rendition of ""Othello"" over a year ago on PBS, and I was absolutely enthralled with it.  Unlike other modern renditions of Shakespearian plays, this version replaces the iambic pentameter with a natural scripted dialogue without losing the meaning and power of Shakespeare's orginal writing.  You will fall in love and emphathize with Walker's powerful portrayal of the ill-fated Othello, and you will scorn and shudder at Eccleston's perfectly manipulative Jago.  This is by far my favorite version of Othello.",1061942400,11,528,5.337349397590361
1677948,5,B00005YUND,"I'm one of those people who hates when the classic's are changed in any way, shape or form.  There are 4 actors in this film that I like, so I decided to give it a go.  Friendly advice: pretend this movie has nothing to do with Shakespeare's Othello.  You'll enjoy it and appreciate it much more.  The acting was supberb and it was put together very well.  It really held my attention.  Give it a shot.",1053820800,5,402,4.223684210526316
1677949,5,B00005YUND,"I normally dislike movies that dispense with the words of Shakespeare.  But for some reason, I loved this modern retelling of Othello.
It didn't feel false, like the so-called 'William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'.
The acting in it is superb.  Eamonn Walker really grabs ahold of the role of John Othello and makes it perfect.  I honestly cannot think of another actor that could have played this role to such ability.
Christopher Eccleston's casting to play Ben Jago was the perfect choice. He really gets to the heart of the role.  The friend, passed over for the job that was his.  The words he uses as narrations are well written, and perfectly acted.
Overall, I give this retelling of Othello 5 stars.  Though now, maybe someone can do a full telling of the traditional play in this medium.",1014422400,6,798,4.746376811594203

7957245,5,B00005YUND,"Othello has always been one of my favorite Shakespeare plays and this modern day retelling certainly does it justice. The main reason I traveled over an hour to acquire this DVD was for two reasons. The first was that I loved the BBC serial Tipping the Velvet and this is done by the same scriptwriter (Andrew Davies), director (Geoffry Sax) and includes two of the star actresses for the two leading female roles in both films (Keeley Hawes and Rachael Stirling) and the second was as I said Othello is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. One thing I am glad about was that Davies decided to use modern language. I for one dislike it when they use the original script from Shakespeare's plays in modern adaptations because I feel that that just makes it anachronistic like in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet. This was a great rendition because like a good cover of a classic song, it is still recognizable as the original yet the creators made it distinctly there own. All the major actors played magnificently here especially Christoper Eccleston as Ben Jago. He was just so manipulative and evil, but yet convincing that it chilled me at times. Him breaking the fourth wall was an interesting decision and I felt that it worked well. Overall this was a magnificent work I would recommend it to anyone.",1309305600,,1304,4.698689956331878
7957246,5,B00005YUND,"""Othello"" is a timeless classic, proven by the many adaptations of Shakespeare's universal work.  This version, starring Eman Walker and Christopher Eckleston, is thought-provoking and unforgettable.

John Othello, (Walker) is a police officer who is given the opportunity to become the first black Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London.  John's mentor and close friend, Ben Jago, was next in line for the job.  Spurred by irrational anger and a twisted love/hate relationship with his protege,, the unscrupulous Ben Jago determines to have his revenge.  John has married Dessie, (Kellie Haus), much to the chagrin of her snobbish, upper-class father.  Jago calculatingly manipulates situations and weaves a poisonous web of deception as he forces John to question his wife's fidelity.

The Bard's classic language is replaced by modernday English, and there are several liberties taken with the plot.  If you are a purist, you will probably be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for a fresh, vibrant examination of Shakespeare's masterpiece, then I'd recommend this gem.  Walker is unsurpassable: his Othello is brooding and unflinchingly flawed.  He is also strong, and the viewer takes to him immediately.  Walker has brilliantly portrayed the original character of Othello in the Globe Theatre production, which is available on DVD as well.
Eckleston is chilling as Iago: his high-pitched, smooth voice will soothe the viewer into a lethargic, honeyed trap.  When his true intentions are revealed, the viewer recoils as if from a repellent serpent.  I'd love to see Eckleston try his hand at Shakespeare's original work.

Please give this riveting film a chance.  God bless.",1273276800,,1698,5.423664122137405
7957247,4,B00005YUND,"The final result in this version of Othello is like that of the original: The green-eyed monster wins.

Fortunately the BBC decided to use the concepts of Shakespeare's Othello but not to try to adapt the words to a modern setting. In this version, John Othello is the head of the London police force during a series of racial crises.

After losing at his own game of office politics, and realizing that Othello does not see him as a lover, Jago's plotting uses race only as a weapon. His hatred and revenge are much more personal.

John Othello's tragic end is like that of the Moor: He realizes too late that while Jago/Iago has betrayed him, Othello has eagerly participated in that very betrayal and his own self-destruction.

Well written and well acted, this movie demonstrates the dynamism of the old story of a man ""who loved more than any man should.""

Like other versions of the story: Not for the faint of heart.",1240099200,,923,4.603658536585366
7957248,4,B00005YUND,"This video was a great contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello.  The the country's racial tension, Othello's insecurity, Desi's innocence, and Iago's master manipulation were clear for the modern audience.  I still love the original, but this was great too.",1209772800,,266,5.794871794871795
7957249,4,B00005YUND,"I teach ""Othello"" in an intro to literature course for non-liberal arts majors; it's their only chance to study literature at my college, and I find this a well-balanced counterpart to the 1995 Oliver Parker-directed film dramatization starring Laurence Fishburne & Kenneth Branagh. My students tend to prefer the ""original"" with Shakespeare's language to this BBC-CBC production, but I like this for the energetic gallows humor it provides. While some of my students have seen ""O,"" made around the same time as this Masterpiece Theatre version, this is more adult, and less teenaged in its appeal. It's grimmer than ""O,"" and moves rapidly.

The performances of not only Eamonn Andrews and Christopher Eccleston (who I enjoyed so much in Danny Boyle's ""Shallow Grave"" in an earlier, equally unhinged role) deserve acclaim. Cass and Desi and Lulu (=Emilia) all do well in difficult scenes, and the conflation of the Rodrigo character into the officer pressured by Jago into recanting his testimony provides a challenging example of how a modern adaptation can alter the original plot and alter characters into this admittedly manic, compressed, and entertaining version. Issues of race, gender, class, and trust all are explored efficiently; how the storyline places Desi's earlier dalliances into her now-faithful relationship with Othello again moves the story into current sexual realism and cultural mores.

Still, even if ""Othello"" appears to be the play that replaces (as in my textbook anthology!) ""Hamlet,"" it cannot be glossed or streamlined. It is a tale of unrelenting deceit and unforgiving revenge. Trendy topics aside, at its dark core, Othello remains a depressing play, and the ironies and sarcasms of Jago, as with Iago, can be disheartening as you see Desi and Othello trapped. I suspect students recoil at how evil the villain is, and how, in this 2001 version, the contemporary twist at the end only seems to emphasize how our standards may have slipped even further from those of Shakespeare's cloak-and-dagger era.

A final note: the use of technology to enhance Jago's entrapment, using cameras, stalkers, the Net, tape recorders, and good old gossip, updates the story well into our own decade. Similarly, the race riot and nod to Brutus' ""I have not come to praise Caesar"" speech plays off Andrews' own quiet strength as well as the scene in the restaurant where he reveals his own ""race card"" in another episode that makes the story even more relevant to today's multicultural but still tense urban society. And, don't forget the substitute for the handkerchief: a nimble plot device! I daresay this improves on the original-- many of my students have a hard time ""believing"" the awkward manner in which the Bard drops the handkerchief into the storyline!",1192665600,13,2780,5.159645232815964
7957250,5,B00005YUND,"I loved this ""Othello"" and as such, I highly reccommend it, for all that's worth. Especially if you are an English teacher looking for  a successful and interesting transformation of Shakespeare's Othello into a contemporary context. This masterpiece theatre 2001 production is an excellent example of what is possible. Remember to look for the related Materpiece Theatre website resources that accompany the production.

This ""Othello"" has been translated into the modern language/ context of a London Met Police Department and you should be aware that this is not a direct ""loyal"" adaptation of Othello. It is a contemporary response to Shakespeare's ""Othello"" making several significant changes to the narrative detail whilst still maintaining thematic integrity. It has the potential to leave an audience divided over the ending and provoke much intelligent discussion in response. Whilst this ""Othello"" was made in the same year as ""O"", I personally believe that it leaves the Amercian film for dead. This film has a strong visual style and all the acting performances are strong. Especially Christopher Eccleston's Ben Jago with his manic asides directly to the camera which I personally really enjoyed.

Whether you watch for it pleasure or for study, this ""Othello"" deserves to be on your Shakespearean radar.",1191974400,5,1317,5.383495145631068
7957251,4,B00005YUND,"...and I think quite good, actually.

Don't expect Shakepeare's Othello and you won't be disappointed. This retelling of Othello dispenses with Shakepeare's poetry, replaces it with modern dialog and drops the story down into modern day London. This adaptation also uses the maybe too clever device of having Iago speak directly into the camera and letting the audience know what he's up to, a device lifted from BBC's political thriller, 'House of Cards.' If you're not a purist, it all works. While the Shakepearean language may be missing the core of the story, jealousy, obsession and power come through stunningly.",1163462400,10,619,5.19
7957252,1,B00005YUND,"This is a terrible adaption of Shakespeare's Othello. It's more like an adaption of someone's interpretation of Othello, one that I do not necessarily agree with. This movie steers so off-course that it doesn't accurately follow the storyline in the original Othello, thus changing everything and really not having anything to do at all with Shakespeare's play. There is virtually no acting going on in this movie. Instead, there are a lot of in-your-face shots of the characters, giving the viewers a forced set of motivations for the inevitable to happen, which are not convincing in any sense. Sure it happens in the original play, but it is not convincing enough in this version.

Instead of the climax becoming Othello's growing rage and madness, the climax in this movie is when the Iago character perches nude on the edge of a bathtub in a very gargoylesque pose. It becomes obvious why they chose this particular actor to play Iago, or Jago as he is called in the movie, with his ugly gargoylesque looks. It all goes downhill after this scene. The Iago character is constantly shown in close-up, advising viewers ""This is a tragedy"" or ""It's all about love."" I guess a viewer could never be sure since it is not obvious in this movie's plot.

Besides of the tragic element in Shakespeare's Othello, there is also a thin thread of dark humor, the misunderstandings newly weds may have with each other, the miscommunications between the sexes, the blindness of love that sometimes blows things out of porportion, the bitterness and disillusionment of older married couples. All these elements that add another dimension to Othello are completely omitted in this version, since as we are informed by the annoying Jago character, ""It is a tragedy.""

I would highly recommend skipping this one and watching ""O"" or ""Switchblade Sisters"" instead, two non-Elizabethan versions of Othello that are more on cue, and American-made versions incidentally, and perhaps surprisingly.",1134172800,5,1976,5.0552147239263805
