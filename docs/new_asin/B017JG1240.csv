8739491,5,B017JG1240,"Both of these movies rely on atmosphere and period drama.  Woman in Black has Harry Potter himself in the starring role and is a creepy ghost story.  Woman in Black 2 takes place during World War II and has a group of orphans moving into the same gloomy house as takes place in 1.  If you are looking for blood and gore, this is not for you, but if you go for more ghostly chills, then I recommend these 2 movies.",1456963200,8,413,4.074074074074074
