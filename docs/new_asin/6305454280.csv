1044566,3,6305454280,"Since this video was titled the ""Best of Raw vol. 1"" I was kind of hoping for a complete history of WWF Raw.  Instead we see the best of Raw for only the past two years.  To make things worse, they are showing  pay per view highlights!  This is Raw.  Not pay per view.  Does it get any  worse?  YES!!  Michael Cole is the host.  Anyway, enough complaining.  The  best of Raw is only for you if you do not already own any WWF videos.  Otherwise, leave it on the shelf.",937958400,3,467,4.0
1044567,4,6305454280,"This video highlights RAW from the beginning of 1998 on.  It highlights it person by person, showing the biggest moments of theirs's, like Stone Cold's zamboni incident, or the birth of Mr. Socko.  It only has the best  guys highlighted though, no midcarders.  Buy if you want to bring back the  memories.",931910400,,305,4.788461538461538
1044568,4,6305454280,I think this what was a very good video.  It bought back alot of memories very entertaining.  I  like the recap of the Vince and Austin war.  The Val Venis angles and etc.  My favorite part was when Austin got Vince arrested  and yes folks it's worth it.  All the parts from this video were right on  point I love this video.  Like they say Raw is War and WWF is sports  entertainment.,930268800,,385,4.1506849315068495
7891119,5,6305454280,"Wrestling at it's finest! ""The good ole days"" of wrestling! Rock, Austin, mankind, and undertaker are all on here! Great rare title to add to the collection.",1455408000,,157,4.851851851851852
7891120,3,6305454280,This is a good tape of wwf during the attitude era it tells you about one of the greatest wrestlers in wwf and the best moments but you probably don't need it because you can get the wwe network and they should all the episodes,1400630400,,227,4.066666666666666
7891121,5,6305454280,"WHen I decided to sit downand wright a review for this tape I read the other reviews that decribe the tape as.. Not the Best of Raw, or A Waste of time.  If your looking for Wrestling matches, Dont watch it, if your looking for a bit of History of the WWF/E Then watch it, I love to take a step beck in time and relive the best and worst moments in wrestling history.  Every twist and turn in the story line is in this video.  The Video Highlights what angle each super stae was taking and what happend in certion years.  If your not sure about it then go to your local video rentle store and rent it first, but as a collector of WWE Entertainment, its worth it.",1075248000,,662,4.069230769230769
7891122,2,6305454280,"O.K. It goes like this: I recently sold my copy of this tape because I never watched it anymore. The first few times I watched this video (after I bought it) was fun. But after a while, it got boring. Most of the stuff on this video is just scenes & moments of the Austin-McMahon feud. If you want a video on the rivalry between S.C. Steve Austin & Mr. McMahon then go buy the McMahon vs. Austin home video.
This video is uncensored too. That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There's a scene in which Cactus Jack is cutting a promo in the ring, and he says the GD word twice.
Also, there's a part where Val Venis is about to be castrated by some enemies, and you can see his nakad behind when security breaks into the locker room.
The story of The Undertaker & Kane is kind of cool, but nothing much. This video focuses on the feud between Austin & McMahon too much. Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Find something else to buy.",1035936000,,955,4.139784946236559
7891123,3,6305454280,"This was a waste of time it has stuff from '97 to late '98. But
the short parts with mick foley D-X and the nation was interuppted by the austin mcmahon battle. And don't watch this if you have bad eyes, the part with kane and undertaker will kill
your vision its mostly red and blue. DOnt buy this its not worth it...",1022371200,,318,4.063492063492063
7891124,4,6305454280,"Boy some WWF fans just have nothing better to do but complain.  The Austin vs McMahon Feud was the backbone of RAW.  It deserves the amount of video time it received.  I would have liked a bit more focus on The Rock. I like the Val Venus segments.  They definitely were worth a chuckle or two.  Some of the Undertaker/Kane stuff dragged on a bit in spots.  Jackie vs Sable does not actually stand the test of time.  However, the good clearly overshadows the bad.  Dr Austin is the house.  What more could you want?",993600000,,514,4.326315789473684
7891125,2,6305454280,"This video is not worth the money. It was alright though, it had KANE and UNDERTAKER it has some of THE ROCK, it also has MANKIND, VAL VENIS, SABLE, and DX. But the mane focuss is vince and AUSTIN. But the hole video is pritty much talking.",992304000,,240,4.127659574468085
7891126,1,6305454280,This isn't the best of videos from the WWF. Should have improved it by adding the 1993 - 1996 years. If you want to waste your money then buy this. It does include the forming of Dx & the impersination from Dx of  the Nation but there are only clips of it. Very dissapointing.,963705600,,276,4.111111111111111
