8541312,4,B009GKU5IW,"My son and I are doing this course together.  The lady that does the signing does a good job.  She repeats each sign verbally and physically 3 times before going on the next sign. She is also good to give tips(if there is one) to help you remember why the sign is a certain way. At first I thought this is easy to remember and that we could watch the session only once and we would be good.  However, we find ourselves not remembering quite that easy and quickly.  By watching only once, it doesnt put the sign to good memory.  Since we have started watching each session for a few days in a row, we are remembering better. There is also some interesting information on deaf history that is good to know.  I am happy with my purchase.  I recommend this course.",1393891200,4,760,4.2727272727272725
