8078690,4,B000AL4712,Decent video how to set sails and spinnaker (asym & symmetrical). However didn't show specifics of fine tuning sails. Almost there though.,1363564800,,138,5.318181818181818
8078691,4,B000AL4712,"The price on this DVD is way out of whack with the amount of content.  The content is good, but needed far more.  Check it out from the library.",1363305600,,144,3.9310344827586206
8078692,3,B000AL4712,"Good tips - ended abruptly after 30 mins or so...No wonder I couldn't find out how long it was before I purchased...

So yes content good - but paying too much for such a short video...Shape-up Bennett Marine Video!
