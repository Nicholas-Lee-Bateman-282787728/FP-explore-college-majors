5752572,1,B00CYOVV0I,rather childish with rude crude sexual jokes and stereotypes.  I couldn't finish watching since it was slow and rather pathetic.,1388275200,,128,5.4
5752573,1,B00CYOVV0I,"Skip this movie unless you enjoy REALLY poor acting, with an even worse script. I've seen porn movies with better plot lines. It's horrible. It isn't worth the money to buy a match to burn the film.",1388102400,,198,4.378378378378378

5752579,3,B00CYOVV0I,I expected more action and for it to be alot more like Hot Dog: The Movie and Out Cold. If I had it to do over again I might rent it but not buy it.,1374364800,3,148,3.257142857142857
5752580,4,B00CYOVV0I,"The original Canadian title for this film is ""The Movie Out Here,"" neither of these titles have anything to do with the plot. Adam (Robin Nielsen) plays a straight man to the sometimes zany comedy of this feature. He is a low level corporate Toronto lawyer who returns to his home town of Fernie to close a deal...a deal that will take his friend's Theo's (James Wallis) Business. Wallis comes across as a light version of Zach Galifianakis. Let's throw a party to save Theo...

We add to this comedy, Sasquatch, a bad engagement (Lisa Durupt), a bad boss (Karin Konoval), two local cops (Nils Hognestad,Artine Brown) and a series of running jokes. The humor ranged from mildly humorous to a good over the top belly laugh. This is a typical 3 star teen-type comedy with the addition of a few great scenes such as the bathroom scene and the nursing lady (Rebecca Husain) on the plane.

Worth a Redbox rental for a fair comedy.
