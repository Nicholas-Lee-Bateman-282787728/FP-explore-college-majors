8000134,5,B0000D9PH4,"Excellent DVD! My 17 month old daughter loves Barney. We love singing and dancing to the songs. Even Daddy has joined in singing, and is often singing one of the catchy tunes with our daughter. She likes to watch it in the morning when she first wakes up, it keeps her engaged for about 30-45 minutes, while I prepare breakfast. And when Daddy gets home she usually asks him to put in a Barney dvd while they are playing in the living room, while I prepare dinner. It's educational with sweet, simple lessons. My daughter definitely prefers the older episodes...... and I can see why. The older episodes have much more interaction, singing and dancing with the children, rather than just the dinosaurs (Barney, Baby Bop, BJ, and Raz) breaking out in song and dance, like in the newer episodes. This episode is an oldie and a goodie! My daughter loves it, one of her faves. It all started with a few Barney DVDs my sister gave me, and our little collection has grown since then. This is a great addition to my daughters Barney dvd collection and at a really great price!!!",1477872000,,1071,4.55440414507772

8000138,4,B0000D9PH4,this is perfect for small children learning about emotions and expressing themselves. It was a gift for my two year old and since he has watched it his is able to tell me how he is feeling and the facial expressions associated with the emotion,1318464000,2,243,4.4222222222222225
8000139,4,B0000D9PH4,This is a pretty good dvd...It would have been nice to show more vivid expressions of the children in the video some are not as noticeable as others but my daughter seems to like it. My daughter loves barney and this will remain in our collection !,1274054400,,248,4.297872340425532

8000141,5,B0000D9PH4,This was onw of the first Barney DVD's my twins really loved. They couldn't talk yet but they had lots of fun making all the funny faces that they show in the DVD. My husband and I laughed and laughed at there attempts to immitate the characters. This is a great one and one of our favorites...we have watched almost everyone made.,1156636800,4,331,4.354838709677419
