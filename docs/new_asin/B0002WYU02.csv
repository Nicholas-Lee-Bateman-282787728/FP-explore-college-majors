2129134,5,B0002WYU02,"I'd like to breifly say somthing in context to this review, and that is that this film is one of the most hilarious Blacksplotation films since ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka!""

  The film is a great example of how two B-Rate director/writers like the Wayans can turn a lame story and script into a gut-bustingly Black comedy.

Now for the bad news.

THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THE HEADS OF AMAZON. COM. The audio sample clips have been removed from your music section, and I am one PISSED OFF customer. How are we as consumers to know what were buying if we can't even sample our CDs?!

 I DEMAND to have these clips (in both instrumental and artist recordings) returned, in full album, or else my membership (along with a good number of my also PISSED internet advocates) and shopping selection at Amazon.com, to be cut.

Be sure that my numerous reviews and stars will also be withdrawn.

2129157,5,B0002WYU02,such a funny movie starring Shawn and Marlon Wayans. this was one of their funniest movies since the first two scary movies'(they were only in 1 and 2 for some reason. they play as undercover cops who have to become women in order to solve a case. overall outrageously funny.,1513036800,2,275,4.52

2129160,5,B0002WYU02,"White chicks is one of the most hilarious movies that has ever existed. Actors Shawn and Marlon Wayans play FBI agents in this movie that came out in 2004. Directed by, Keenen Ivory Wayans, this movie has a lot of crude jokes but is very funny. Other actors seen in this film are Brittney daniels, Terry Crews, Jaime King, John Heard, and many more. This film has some extreme bathroom humor and side plots.
 In the beginning of the movie, FBI agents, Kevin and Marcus start off by messing up a drug bust, they are on thin ice with their boss, Chief Gordon (played by Frankie Faison). When a new case opens up, Kevin and Marcus want on it. The case is about two rich sisters, Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, who have a suspected kidnapper that is after their money. Kevin and Marcus get on the case to pick the girls up from the airport and end up getting run off the road by a trucker and the sisters get a fat lip and a gash on their noses. Refusing to go to their weekend away at the Hamptons with their faces looking like that, Marcus and Kevin hire a geek squad to transform them into the sisters. While the real Wilson sisters are at a hotel in New York, Marcus and Kevin fool everyone that they are really the sisters.
  I thought the jokes were hilarious and the movie had some romance, action, and comedy in it, which in my opinion, is the perfect combination. The thing that stuck out to me the most in this movie was how well they guys did convincing everyone that they were the sisters. I know it's a movie and all, but I feel like you would just be able to tell and suspect it. I mean, maybe that is part of the humor of the movie.
 The plot of White Chicks was really good. I cared about what happened to the characters and certain things kept drawing me and focusing me on the movie. In one part of the movie, Terry Crews keeps bidding on one of the sisters to go on a date and ended up bidding 50,000 dollars, which had me on the edge of my seat during this process. I thought that the acting in the film was excellent; I am a huge fan of the movie and thought the jokes and humour of the movie were hilarious. The story itself was just so unrealistic, but I think that is what made the movie funnier. I also think that they way the movie was shot also was real good for being a movie shot in 2004. The movie was filmed in British Columbia, and parts of the Hamptons. The scenery and places that certain scenes were shot were also very pretty. The Hamptons have gorgeous houses and beaches.
 In conclusion, I thought that this movie was a really good and would recommend watching it, only if you like crude, a little racist, and rude jokes. I think this movie was really funny and got through the plot unlike some movies that have multiple plots and don't even get through them. This movie was funny, sad, and a little romantic, but also a really great movie.",1509580800,,2872,4.252747252747253

If I had known I was going to get that version I would not have purchased it.  All of the other movies I have that Are UNCUT/UNRATED are just that.
 It was an ok movie. I most likely will not watch it again unless it is a last resort.

This movie is one of the classics of the early millennium.
While this satire movie can be considered very colorful in nature its done so in a way
you will laugh the whole movie and the wonder if you should have. Its a movie that break down
the often stressful situations of race in America. And brings it full of humor in a movie unlike any other.
This is a must see for anyone of any age over 18.",1461715200,,438,4.045977011494253
2129275,3,B0002WYU02,"2004 saw the release of a Wayans Brothers buddy comedy starring Marlan and Shawn Wayans, younger brothers and partners of their famous oldest brother, Keenan Ivory Wayans, who pioneered in the 1990s with In Living Color on the Fox Network.  Since the end of their sketch comedy show, the Wayans brothers went on to produce a variety of raunchy comedies which are lite on story but fun for the audiences.  Despite it's mostly negative reviews, this film has gone on to become a sort of cult classic.  Firstly, this is not Oscar material.  If you think this could be Oscar material (outside of the special effects make up), then there are some serious issues at work.  Wayans Brothers movies are full of racial, sexual, gender and toilet humor, sort of but not really ""guy movies"".

Two FBI agent brothers, Marcus and Kevin, have blundered a drug bust in a convenient store.  Their supervisor gives them another chance at remaining in the agency by assigning them a babysitting job.  The Wilson sisters (a thinly veiled fictional characterization of the Hilton Sisters) were coming in for a big weekend in the Hamptons and there is a kidnapping threat against them.  On the way to their Hamptons hotel, they get into a car accident that leaves the Wilson sisters with bumps and scrapes that leaves them too insecure to be seen.  Not wanting to loose their jobs, Marcus and Kevin call in the special FBI make up teams (if such a thing exists) to make them up into the Wilson sisters and they will pose as them for the weekend.  A variety of screwball comedy antics ensue as they meet with Brittney and Tiffany's friends and attempt to play wealthy young white women, the advances of a professional football player, Latrell (played by Terry Crews in his wonderful comic turn), attempting to identify the kidnappers, Marcus's suspicious wife chasing after him, and the two rival sisters attempting to thwart their social success.

While this movie is far from superior and has obvious flaws (their putting the make up on instantly rather than the hours upon hours it took to get it right behind the scenes, all around them seem to have no idea these two look a little odd, etc.), this is a good time in seeing them attempt to do a lot with so little.  Have a good laugh at their antics and physical comedy.  It's a good time.",1460678400,,2320,4.6683046683046685

2129511,4,B0002WYU02,"When watching White Chicks viewers will have a good time if they do not watch the movie with a critical analysis of reality. With a plot of two African American F.B.I agents Marcus and Kevin (actors: Marlon and Shawn Wayans) going undercover at the Hamptons as two young white socialites, Tiffany and Brittany Wilson, the movie can be judged from the get go because of the prosperous idea of an African American man dressing and passing as a white female socialite. I encourage looking past the twisted actuality, so that the movie can be enjoyed as is; a comedy.
 As the F.B.I. agents discover that they will need to go undercover as white females, they call in a makeup team to make them look the part. Here is where there should not be a critical analysis of reality, because for it is obvious that Marcus and Kevin do not look vaguely like the Wilson sisters. Nor do they even look like a real women considering the immobilizing rubber prosthetics used. It is hard to imagine that anyone at the Hamptons who knows the Wilson sisters would believe the undercover agents to be them, and it is hard to look past the visuals. The performances given make up for the shoddy makeup jobs.
 The performances are overall quite worth noting. It takes a lot for a man to dress up in womens clothes and act feminine, and the Wayans brothers gave it all they had. If it was from walking in high heels to wearing mini skirts and wigs, the brothers did it all. Terry Crews, who plays Latrell Spencer, becomes infatuated with who he thinks to be Tiffany Wilson (Marlon Wayans.) During his performance, Crews give emotion to his character and puts his own twist on what Latrell Spencer should act like. The actors/actresses become the character they are portraying, and this makes for believable acting.
 Overall the movie White Chicks is a quotable one-liners kind of comedy that leaves open minded viewers laughing. When I say open minded viewers I mean those that will look past the noticeable quirks and enjoy the raw comedy and plot. This is a comedy, but it also provides action, suspense, and romance and ultimately what is the purpose of comical movies? Not to be exact reality. Movies are meant to entertain viewers, even if that means being ridiculous.",1411516800,,2248,4.686075949367089

I find the absurdity hilarious - including the ridiculously unbelieveable aspects of two black men dressing up as spoiled society chicks and not being called out by their big hands and feet, their masculine mannerisms. This takes one back to the comedy of Abbott and Costello, Milton Berle, even Monty Python, etc. However, I find this so much more funny and original (with the exception of Monty Python, who were the greatest at hilarious absurdity). My favorite scenes are the dance-off (so hilarious and well done), the restaurant fart scene, the face off ""your mother"" jokes, the bathroom scene, and the take off on ""One Thousand Miles"" - really hilarious. I read all the negative comments and don't find this movie racist at all (and I'm white). It is a situation comedy in the mode of Bosom Buddies - two guys passing as women so far removed from themselves, they go into outrageous character.

The movie was so entertaining that I didn't care about the sub-plot of the kidnappings. I just wanted to see more scenes of Marlon and Shawn - very good comedians, especially Marlon. I'm not a movie buff and have a hard time having my attention focused on anything too long - this movie was able to keep me at attention and wanting more.",1286064000,3,1344,4.647058823529412
2129795,2,B0002WYU02,"Every bad movie has to have one good side about them, and this one had a name: Terry Crews.  Maybe it's because of his recent rise from ""Everybody Hates Chris"", a bit role in ""Click"", and the Old Spice commercials, but I kind of like his character as a wealthy basketball player who's hitting on one on the Wilson sisters, who's really Marlon Wayans in disguise.  Seeing him go nuts trying to win a 'girl's' heart as well as him singing a Vanessa Carlton song was entertaining, and outside that one scene regarding a lot of farting, he's pleasant to watch.

Although, I might be making such a statement as a desperate attempt to find anything positive about this film.  ""White Chicks"" is the type of film in which one looks at the movie cover and realize this is a bad idea.  The jokes are stale, predictable, and a little bit offensive such as the first scene where the Wayans bros. dress up as Hispanic clerks and overblown their acting for far too long; some parts of the humor rely on being gross, which has never been good.  The make-up on the fake heiresses is monstrous and the characters are too dense to notice the disguises, even the FBI who should've easily noticed the difference between the fake and real heiresses, the FBI that Shaun and Marlon's characters are working under and part of a secret operation that their superiors didn't know; also, I find it hard to be that the brothers, when normal, can reapply such an elaborate make-up in less than 30 seconds.  Even more insipid is the reporter, who's involved in a cliche sub-plot where Shaun Wayans' character pretends to be rich to get her attention, and she must not be good at her job if she didn't notice the blatant lies like Shaun being attacked by a guard dog in what his character called his own house.

Even with such flaws, this movie manage to make an impression on me.  It's not a funny impression nor a satisfying one, but it made me gasped in horror for almost the entire duration.  As grotesque as the whole premise is, I just couldn't look away.",1276819200,,2030,4.506811989100817
2129826,2,B0002WYU02,"NOTE: This review refers to the unrated version.

I guess the Wayans Brothers didn't realize that the ""men in drag"" premise is now old and tiresome. I mean, take a look at Some Like It Hot, Tootsie, or even The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The same premise was used, but plenty of brand new elements were added. White Chicks also has some new elements (placing two African-Americans under lots of makeup, and turning them into blond female teenagers), but it just doesn't work. The disguises of both Shawn & Marlon Wayans are so grotesquely ugly that that it's more painful than funny to look at. Just take a look at the front side of this DVD case, and try not to cringe at the mere sight of it. But it's not just the horrible makeup, but it's also the unfunny jokes that make this movie a big disappointment. There were only few jokes that made me laugh; those that were unfunny felt very forced, and these make up 109 out of the entire 110 minutes of the film. The Wayans Brothers are much better than this. They've made the first Scary Movie & Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, both of which I enjoyed immensely. White Chicks fails as a comedy, but it's hardly the worst I have ever seen. The Hot Chick makes this one look like Spaceballs.

I'll admit that when I first saw White Chicks I had mixed feelings about it. At first I thought it was sporadically funny but at second look its pretty funny and is the last of the funny Wayans Brothers we knew.

Two disgraced FBI agents go way undercover in an effort to protect hotel heiresses the Wilson Sisters from a kidnapping plot. These two also go through a lot of hijinks involving keeping up the charade as well as dealing with nosy girlfriends as well as the real heiresses' archenemies.

Funny Scene#1: The beginning where Marcus was in the shop trying to pass himself as as Hispanic was pretty funny. Especially when he broke singing Guantanamera.

Funny Scene#2: The scene where Marcus is in the car with Latrell and he breaks out into song had me laughing till I was breathless.

Funny Scene#3: The date scene with Marcus and Latrell is the funniest part of the movie hands down. Have you ever met a guy so oblivious and desperate that his desperation matches Wanda's desperation off of In Living Color? I mean I had to hold back the laughter just to watch the rest of the scene! Funny Scene#4: The department store scene is not too far behind when you talk about the funniest scenes in the movie. There were some pretty clever and not subtle jabs at the insecurities women have about their weight. Sure it was over-the-top but remember this is a comedy.

Funny Scene#5: The dance-off scene in the club was hilarious. Watching those girls shake their flat rear ends then to watch them getting disgraced by White Chicks duo on the dance floor was too funny for words.

Funny Scene#6: Kevin gets attacked by a rottweiler. ""He's not my dog, he's family"". Lol!

In conclusion If you can handle this type of comedy then go for it if not don't waste your time. To me White Chicks is laugh out loud romp and is the last of the funny Wayans Brothers movies.

2129907,2,B0002WYU02,"Role-reversal, gender bending comedies are hardly original, but in a truly enlightening and entertaining edition, there is typically a cultural, sexual, or stylistic lesson.  In White Chicks, however, there is nothing redeeming or worthwhile whatsoever.

Bumbling, sibling FBI agents (Shawn and Marlon Wayans) go undercover by putting on rubbery body padding, off-white paint, and contact lenses to become the Wilson sisters (a copycat movie portrayal of the Hilton sisters).  Apparently the Wilson sisters are mutants, transvestites, or perhaps hermaphrodites who look like Tori Spelling.  Either way, their appearance is as ridiculously unconvincing as the Wayans' brothers acting.  All that said, and there's no need to even go into the fact that neither of them acts feminine in any way, making the premise even more pathetic.  The fact that their friends don't even notice that the Wilson sisters transformed from beautiful, thin, young women into gawky, masculine, drag queens is outrageous, and a reason to simply ignore the rest of the movie.

Even before seeing the movie you know the script.  Insert lame racial joke here, act out clichd stereotype there.  Rich chicks can't make it to the Hamptons for whatever contrived reason and the Wayans step incognito as replacements.  I think it goes without saying, but just in case there was any doubt, there is definitely a dancing scene where people can't believe the white chicks can break it down so well.

At best it's nothing more than unfunny garbage.  Instead of this drivel the Wayans should have worked on the next Scary Movie sequel.",1217116800,,1598,5.223529411764706

2129914,1,B0002WYU02,"With White Chicks Keenan Ivory Wayans and the Wayans Clan have shown us they've lost touch with their cinematic roots and become totally disconnected from their viewing audience. Like Robert Townsend before him did with B.A.P.S., Mr. Wayans and his clan have made the film they parodied with relish twenty years ago in Hollywood Shuffle.

Shawn and Marlon Wayans are two bumbling FBI agents who screw up a drug bust. To redeem themselves, they take a case to stop some kidnappers. They go the airport to pick up two snooty rich heiresses and take them to the Hamptons. When a car accident leads to some minor facial injuries on the rich girls they insist on staying in a Manhattan hotel for corrective surgery. The guys go get made up and dress up as..White Chicks. That's what we're told. That's what they want us to believe. But only the Emperor in his new clothes would fall for that make-up. It doesn't even cover the actors in a lot of frames!

As soon as the movie heads into the Hamptons the plot falls apart and the movie enters the MST3K realm of stupidity. The only way anyone could find this ""movie"" funny is by making their own jokes and crass comments about all the plotholes and story inconsistencies. I'm not even going to finish synopsizing the plot because it makes my head hurt to think about it. I just want to know: How does anyone believe these two guys are women with their broad shoulders and those rubber Michael Jackson masks? How does anyone on a crowded beach not see Shawn Wayans casually walk into a ladies cabana a ""White woman"" and come out a well-dressed black man? And in the same sequence how does Marlon wear a low-rise bikini and not one of the women notices something isn't right? How does Shawn pass off another guys' house as his own when he doesn't know where anything is? There's suspension of disbelief, but come on, no one can stretch their disbelief that far.

Ugh. The acting here is HORRID. Any actor involved in this dreck should take this movie off their resume and never mention to anyone they participated in it. Ever. Shawn and Marlon aren't funny at all here. The weak gags have no-set up so the comedy duo's timing and execution are way off. Terry Crews hams it up as a basketball star with a fetish for one of the ""White Chicks"". Not his best work. Brittany Daniel looks better than she acts in this movie. The talented veteran Frankie Faison is the only one who manages to pull a decent performance out of this material. I don't remember most of the cast; the movie was so bad I want it erased from my long-term memory.

This movie isn't the Wayans family in top form. Even with all six Wayans doing screenwriting, the script is a mess not fit for a home video. It's clear the Wayans didn't have any understanding about what they're writing about. Did the family do any research before setting pen to paper? Did they consult any rich women while writing this parody? There are more things to make fun of about rich women than tasteless sex jokes and stereotype Valley girl gags from twenty years ago. The young jet set is different from city to city. What's hot with Paris and Nicole in L.A. is not cool in the Hamptons or Martha's Vineyard.

Watching this movie I wondered what happened to the Wayans family? Twenty years ago they were masters of satire and parody that tapped the Black cultural pulse. Hollywood Shuffle, I'm Gonna Get You Sucka, In Living Color, A Low Down Dirty Shame, the Wayans Brothers, and Waynehead were brilliant pieces of Black satire that showcased the tremendous talent the family had for humor. With this movie and Little Man it seems like they've lost their way.

Here's some advice to the Wayans clan: Pick Up Hollywood Shuffle, I'm Gonna Get You Sucka and A Low Down Dirty Shame. Go get the Old In Living Color tapes.

I thought this was going to be a derogatory movie that berated white women. I finally caught this on TV last night and I laughed my butt off. This movie is not at all what you might expect. It is truly great comedy. If you like movies like ""Shallow Hal"" and "" Miss Congeniality"", you will probably enjoy this one. A bit irreverent about young high society ladys, but done in a way that deserves much more than a look. I've been a big fan of the Wayan's since their ""In Living Color"" TV series. This comedy will be on my shelf quite soon next to ""Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle"". This breaks the typical comedy mold with some outragious ideas.

It strikes a new chord of comedy that is bold yet familiar. Bold in it isn't like any other movie, but with a taste of a familiar comedic style like Saturday Night's ""A Night at the Roxbury"" by having a great cast and comedic style that makes it seem almost familiar to previous Wayan's works. The story centers on two black male FBI agents put in charge of guarding two white rich society girls from being kidnapped while they are on a weekend trip to a model show. When the two girls faces are slightly injured they refuse to go and the FBI agents must improvise to make sure they appear at the show. What ensues is borderline hysterical comedy. Excellent comedy writing, great acting, and some fantastic make-up make this a joy to watch. The soundtrack is super as well and would be well worth having. If you enjoy the Wayan's or just good comedy like the movies I mentioned previously, you will want to see this movie. I highly recommend it.",1166486400,3,1763,4.342424242424243

I had misgivings due to bad reviews, but I'm now more apt to ignore the 'pros' and rely on my own judgement and that of regular viewers.

I think this movie is successful in terms of making people laugh. Some people also find this movie heavily racist, and that is the question most people think is interesting, is this movie a racist movie?

Just by watching the movie, I have to admit that it is in some ways racist. It exaggerates the stereotypes of both White Americans and African Americans. For example the ""white trash"", ""dumb blondes"" and also the ""ghetto African Americans"" stereotypes. These stereotypes are also what made the movie so funny. However, I don't think people should make a big fuss over how ""racist"" it is, because instead of trying to make fun of the stereotypes, the movie is at the same time trying to make you laugh and also trying to raise the awareness of racism.

The movie is racist, but in a positive way. It raises the public awareness of ""stereotypes"" of whites and blacks, at least to me it does. I think the movie makes you laugh but also it makes you think while you're laughing. ""Why are the girls so stupid in the movie? Whites are not all like that in real life!"" That's one of the thoughts I had while I was watching the movie. Most people watched the movie, laughed the crap out of it, then eventually they forgot about it. I think the audience tends to not realize the purpose, the meaning behind the movie. I think the movie does make a point, it does raise the awareness of racism in the United States.

In general, I strong recommend the movie to anyone who's ready for a stomach-aching laugh, but I also hope that you would pay a little more attention to racism in the United States after watching the movie. Think about the things in the movie.",1148515200,2,1832,4.5120481927710845

But alas, my friend, who claimed of the movie's humorous qualities rented it so I could finally see it. And that make-up job was still so terrible.

All in all, it was an ""okay"" movie. I'm one who still appreciates gags, so of course the most hilarious scene was definitely the bathroom fart scene.(I'm a 24 year old female too, so quite grown up). I'm neither black nor white, so the only little ""poke"" at racism that kinda bugged me for a short minute was at the beginning when Shawn's character claimed his IQ was ""lower"" as he was dressed in Hispanic garb.

As a whole, though, I don't think the movie was really well thought-out. I mean, it did have its several funny moments, but eh...not enough to make it a great comedy.  It was totally stupid, but in a funny way, so you can't really take a movie like that too seriously. Some of the humor was tasteless and corny and kinda disgusting, like the girl slumber party scene. I'm not sure which version I was watching, but the humor in that scene doesn't have a place in even PG-13 movies, so I'm guessing the uncut version was rented.

Anyway, I recommend this movie only for people who don't take movies seriously, for those people who appreciate the stupid funny movies, for those who like gag humor, and for those who can truly make themselves overlook the fact the make-up is horrible but characters stupidly never notice, etc. But if you just happen to be a rich, but sensitive white girl, then you might want to look elsewhere!

Is it feasible for Jim Carrey to find a magical mask that makes people turn into worse versions of themselves? Did it keep us from enjoying The Mask? Is it believable for a boogey man to kill teenagers in their dreams who live on Elm Street? Did this stop A Nightmare on Elm Street from being a good scary movie?

Credibility only matters in actions and dramas: not in comedies and horrors. The only obligation of a comedy is to be funny, not to be artful or classy. This single obligation is also the reason why standards for comedies are lower than for dramas, and why comedies hardly ever get nominated for Oscars unless they are ""arty.""

If you hate White Chicks because you DON'T think it's funny, fine. Everything is not going to appeal to everyone. And this is one thing not enough reviewers respect about eachh other: what appeals to you won't be something everybody gets. It doesn't make anything WRONG with them. I will say I haven't laughed this hard at a movie since Mean Girls, which was uh, only a couple of months ago, but I digress...

While the Scary Movie series was gross more than funny, the Wayans show some restraint with White Girls and actually spend more time trying to make us laugh rather than make us hurl.

White Chicks does not disrespect whites or blacks. It makes fun of rich socialites who happen to be white. It also pokes fun at the stereotype of black athletes with white women.

Once again, there is nothing wrong with people who find this movie good or people who don't.

2130002,2,B0002WYU02,"I'm a fan of the Wayans brothers - loved Don't Be A Menace and generally liked the Scary Movie series - but this was a real let-down.  One of the curious things about their movies is there's usually an undercurrent of sexual ambivalence there.  In this movie that's ruthlessly shut down from the get-go, so in the first scene in which the guys appear in drag as the white chicks, when some other guy makes a pass at them they immediately break character & turn macho because they're so appalled by the idea such a thing would happen.  Since they've disguised themselves as (supposedly) pretty girls their reaction to what was inevitably going to happen makes them painfully dumb and it's hard to care about dumb characters.

I happened to finally catch up with Zoolander the other day and it shows that you can combine a thriller plot with comedy to good effect.  Here the rather po-faced thriller element totally fails to mesh with the comedy, & the conventional romance sub-plot is a yawn.  I don't mind things being ludicrous, but they must have some sort of internal logic to them.  At one point there's a dance-off competition where our heroes throw down with all manner of fancy moves.  Who knew that all FBI agents were such good dancers?

I actually liked the fact they looked kind of hideous in drag & make-up but still everyone believed they were the real girls.  But even there construction was slack: in a scene where one agent is trying on a dress one of the real girls comes into the dressing room to help 'her' change.  The real girl wrenches the guy's underpants up into a thong style, leading to him whooping in pain.  What's slack is that she doesn't notice that this 'white chick' has a brown ass.

Maybe I zoned out right at the start (a very unfunny stakeout-gone-wrong sequence) but who was the guys' special friend who had all this amazing make-up & a team to apply it?

Another example of general laziness is that the 'girls' never worry about wigs or make-up going awry (not even when break-dancing on their heads) so the suspense of being in disguise is mostly thrown away.

It seems pointless to point out all the gaping holes in the plot but one example would be when one of the agents' wives thinks he is cheating on her.  Now he could tell her the truth: that he's undercover.  But instead he doesn't, leading to more senseless complications generated, I suspect, by a desire to give the sistas a slightly higher profile in the movie.

This could have been a really funny film.  It could have made some sharp points about race & gender.  It could - like the Wayans brothers' other flicks - have been a fun send-up of (in this case) drag movies.  Instead it was a chore.  You know when you find that you've wandered off to the bathroom or kitchen without pausing the dvd player?  This is one of those.  I got the feeling someone came up with the idea & then imported the Wayans brothers to make it into an appealing package - promotion-wise, that is.  They are, as always, charismatic and watchable, but for me this was simply a dull film.",1130544000,,3068,4.524500907441016

Sporting two of the worst make-up jobs in motion picture history, Shawn and Marlon Wayans play incompetent undercover FBI agents who dress up as a couple of blond bimbo socialites to nab a kidnapper.  Borrowing virtually all of its plot points - and none of its style - from that gender-bending template, ""Some Like it Hot,"" ""White Chicks"" hits a new low in cross dressing comedies.  Not only are the makeup jobs repulsive and thoroughly unconvincing, but the humor rarely rises above the waistline.  About half the jokes center around flatulence and the other half around bodily functions in general.  Unlike most actors stuck in a turkey of this caliber, the Wayans have no one to blame but themselves (and their older and presumably more experienced brother, Keenan Ivory, who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with them).

This is about as completely unfunny as any comedy could ever hope to be, but what I really want to know is how a movie that uses transvestism as its theme can still manage to trash gays every chance it gets.",1128729600,5,1052,4.7845303867403315
2130026,3,B0002WYU02,"This film is called the worst film of the year and has been on numerous Top Ten worst film lists of 2004. It dosent deserves that. Its not a great movie. But deserves a bit more dignity.

The film follows two F.B.I. agents Kevin Copeland (Shawn Wayans)and Marcus Copeland (Marlon Wayans).They are two agents that cant get a break in the bureau. While they are on a babysitting job protecting the Wilson sisters. They decide to disguise themselves as the them and find out who the kidnapper is.

This movie is misunderstood by many. Its called rascist,stupid,crude & unfunny. I mean yes it has really weird moments & some really crazy humor that relies on stereotypes. But all the jokes are not meant directly to offend people but to make people laugh.

Ok the real problem about this movie are not the jokes or the humor or the stereotype. But the plot. First of all let me say i like the Wayans Brothers i think there talented comedians since In Living Color. But they made a few mistakes in the film. Like the makeup. That is the worst makeup ever. It would be impossible to put F.B.I agents like that and pass as two white chicks. But others would say that add to the stupidity of the movie. Most of jokes were funny. But some just went a bit over the top & overacted sometimes. And the plot wasn't gold. But they could have done a better job. My gripe is that the whole movies purpose was jokes and two black guys disguised as white chicks right?So then why does the movie tries to go serious by explaing the plot. You get to that part and you fell like we don't need this exsposition. But what can you do. You cant have everything.

My amazement is i don't understand what people expected from the Wayans Brothers. Some people get too hateful on films. What were you expecting a masterpiece. When you go to see this movie you expect something to make you laugh. Its not the the worst movie of 2004. But when you go to M. Night Shyamalan movie you expect some kinda twist in end that will blow you and be entertained. We were expecting something great in The Village. But we didn't get great we got bad.

Well, the opening scene didn't get any chuckles out of me and 45 minutes into the film I still hadn't even broken a smile. I think I have a pretty good sense of humor, but this movie just didn't cut it for me. The makeup jobs were horrible. You could tell they were men wearing makeup. I figured it looked so bad because it was a very large screen. When I noticed it was on Starz! I thought I'd check it out to see if it was any more convincing. Nope!

The agents hope to thwart a kidnapping attempt on the girls.  The agents hang out in the Hamptons, turning the youth scene upside down and ensuring the scene will never be the same.  Of the agents is single, the other married.  The single one pursues a pretty reporter, while the married one's wife is hot on his trail, convinced he is cheating on her.

The Wayans are at their very best while portraying the girls.  They have the accents and mannerisms down pat, and one of them has the most hilarious laugh.  I love how the ""girls"" form genuine friendships with some of the non-snooty Hampton girls.  They even teach a rich girl to value herself as more than a booty call and stop being a doormat for this worthless rich guy.  Out of makeup, the brothers are wooden and poor actors, all dialouge sounding scripted and rehearsed with no real feeling.  When emotional scenes come on, this horrible canned music comes on that is totally out of place and really makes those scenes stink!!!

I love slapstick, but about 30% of the jokes were so vulgar they were insufferable to sit through.  These jokes include talking about doing Pam Anderson when she has a yeast infection, a long farting gag, and another farting gag, a panty-smelling F.B.I. agent, and date rape drugs causing men to bed each other.

Terry Crews was so uninhibited and delightful as the black guy who falls in love with one of the white girls.  The more she rebuffs him, the more intrigued he gets.  There is a lot of priceless comedy here.  Definitely worth seeing!",1116806400,11,1699,4.666666666666667

I read some of the reviews for this film and found them to be truly stupid.  People are saying that the film is racist.  Well if you look at the history of theatre you'll find that it was racist long before the Wayans Brothers came along.  What about white actors in Black face.  Why do you think Black people went crazy when Ted Danson did that Black face bit.  How many white people have you seen play Native Americans in Westerns and why is it in every Western the Native Americans are depicted as wrong when the bottom line is Europeans came over here and took over a land they had no right to.  So before you start screaming racism when a Black person makes a film poking fun at racial feelings you need to look back and see the blood on the hands of theatrical and film productions done by white people.  Also remember that at one point Black people couldn't even get in theatres unless they were the cleaning crew.  This film was funny for what it was depicting and the people who starred in and produced the movie were excellent for what the plot and purpose of this movie was about.,1115164800,28,1250,4.349137931034483

I was persuaded to endure this mindless goop against my better judgment, and I will forever regret never being able to reclaim those precious, lost minutes of my life.

Where does one begin? The makeup effects are horrendous, the alleged humor is tasteless, vulgar, obnoxious, and moronic, the acting is like an elementary school play, and the fact that no one in this movie can tell that the two ""white chicks"" in this film are guys with all purpose flour on their faces defies not only logic, but sanity.

I suppose there are plenty of people out there who enjoy an endless barrage of fart and excrement jokes, but for those who are not five years old, this ""film"" has no real humor to offer. There are also those who enjoy the stereotyping of blacks and whites in a debasing and defiling manner. For those whose I.Q. reaches above the average price of crude oil, there are far better comedies out there with real humor and comedic timing.

Some reviewers like to point out that this movie was never touted as high brow entertainment, that ""it is what it is,"" but it is a sad day when a large part of the population considers this sewage "" great entertainment.""

2130134,3,B0002WYU02,"White Chicks is a mixed bag among movies. It offers some good, funny comedy brought to you courtesy of the Wayans brothers; with Shawn and Marlon Wayans taking center stage as the main performers in the movie, dressed in drag, and Keenen Ivory Wayans taking over duties as director.

This movie is the most humorous when the two guys are dressed as women and are trying their best to act the part. Particularly funny is when the guys suddenly forget they are men and let their true voices and mannerisms creep out from behind the white masks. Another funny part of the film occurs when a man tries to ""hit on"" one of the ""girls"" not knowing she is really a he.

But there are some flaws with this film, in spite of the laughs. First of all, the plot isn't very good and it's full of holes. The guys disguise themselves as women to foil a kidnapping plot of two blonde haired beauties, but the plot is so empty that viewers will find themselves not really caring. I watched the movie a couple of times, and it made no real difference to me how it ended. Second, there is an element of stupidity with this movie because, even though anyone can tell these two guys are not really women, the other actors and actresses in the film carry on like they cannot tell.

Another thing that might bother some viewers is the use of stereotypes and racial talk. This comes up every now and then and is meant in a fun way, but more sensitive viewers will not appreciate what they hear.

Two brothers who are FBI agents must protect two heiresses *who are based on the infamous Hilton sisters* from a kidnapping plot. To do this, they disguise themslves *quite hysterically* as them and must blend into the socialite scene. Hilrarity ensues. This movie is full of one-liners that will have you laughing for weeks.

Face it, when you have two black men pretending to be dumb blondes, the results are going to be funny. This is highly recommended but only if you have a sense of humor.

Who else has ever exploited ancient racial stereotypes to present a humorous take on the differences between caucasians and african-americans? The answer: no one, at least no one as brilliant as the brothers Wayan. But fear not, white citizens of America! Do not feel alienated by the countless inside ""black"" jokes in the movie; there's plenty of racial comedy to go around. One would think that White Chicks would be a pathetic, useless attempt at something close to a satire considering its close follow up to the release of the award-winning classic ""Soul Plane"" but every hilarious quip regarding hip-hop music or malt liquor is hilarious, and every scene is visual poetry. So I say: marvellously done. Truly a film like this only comes along once every two to three years!

The boys look nothing like the Wilson sisters they're impersonating, but that's okay, that's what it makes it so hilarious.

Yeah, it's a no brainer, but I love the Wayans anyway, so I was rooting for them before I even saw it. To me, it's just the boys laughing at the human ability to create issues out of irrelevant things like race and gender.

Talented as the Wayans are, the superb Terry Crews almost steals the show as Latrell Spencer, right down to his Eighties pickup lines, robotic dancing and his singing of Vanessa Carlton's A Thousand Miles, which appears more than once in the movie. The most entertaining appearance was when the 'girls' and their three friends are heading out in an exotic open-top car and the song comes on the radio; which they sing along with, before switching to a 50 Cent rap number.

Stage actress  Jennifer Carpenter again grabs the limelight in a brilliant performance as the weight/body image obsessed Lisa. The scene in which 'Shawn' is watching her change into a stunning black outfit is hilarous, but also undesrcores the point that many women who are already slim and beautiful have poor self-image due to all manner of insane social pressures.

This is probably the ultimate guys dressing as gals movie in so far as it is gutsy enough to try some very experimental makeup techniques, of the kind normally reserved for Alien characters in Sci Fi movies. While the guys don't actually end up looking much like the Wilson sisters, if you can suspend your disbelief for long enough you can just enjoy the crazy events as they unfold.

It's a complete BabeFest too, right down to the inevitable Bad Girls played by the stunning Jaime King and Brittany Daniel. The Making Of and other Features are superb and give you a sense of the fun the whole cast had making this movie.

The brother had to act so rude to get him away and nothing worked til he revealed who he was at the end of the movie. The other one went on a date with a reporter.

2130203,1,B0002WYU02,"I'm trying to think of reasons for anyone to rent this DVD. I like the comedy of the Wayans family. But this movie is not very high on the must see list.

 I watched the commentary bonus feature after watching the film. I found out the whole conception of White Chicks was based on Shawn Wayans seeing Paris Hilton in a magazine with here little Tinkerbell. He then brought that idea to his brother Keenen Ivory.  This idea passed the family input and White Chicks was born.  Watching the Wayans family trying to pull this transformation off was like a real life rectum logy. (Very painful and discomforting for a long, long time.) This movie has nothing new in the comedy genre besides the obvious black to white and male to female jokes.

  I remember Damon, Shawn and Keenen Ivory performing in the classic career launching TV show ""In Living Color."" Keene Ivory created In Living Color. Who could forget Homey D. Clown and Fire Marshall Bill. White Chicks is forgettable in every aspect. Keenen Ivory's short script writing and character development was dead on in those unforgettable In Living Color skits. Can we get some of that gut busting laughter back again?

  The one bright spot in White Chicks is the comedic timing and ad-lib of Marlon Wayans. Shawn and Marlon being FBI agents and horrifying makeup job were very unbelievable. The fart and high society white girl jokes are not enough to carry a movie.

Pass on purchasing this DVD.",1099526400,8,1448,4.7063492063492065
2130204,2,B0002WYU02,"I am usually a fan of men-in-drag comedies. But for some reason ""White Chicks"" just did NOT hit the spot. Perhaps because the plot was so completely ludicrous (two black FBI agents masquerading as white women complete with latex costumes and wigs), or perhaps because the jokes were just not that funny (Such as the scene at the beginning where the Wayan brothers were pretending to be Puerto Ricans and kept uttering silly pseudo-Spanish phrases), which, quite frankly embarrassed me rather than amused me.

If I could wrap my mind around the whole idea that two FBI agents MIGHT be persuaded to handle the cases these two were assigned to, there's the costumes themselves. They looked quite painful. Demon-blue contacts, and fake botox-smile faces quite frankly were scary rather than funny. I guess I just can't get into a film where the two actors look like they are being tortured by odd makeup.

There were a few funny scenes, like the rich ball star who kept hitting on one of the agents, and the cute little fuzzy dog. But these were few and far between.

Overall, I found White Chicks about as funny as a funeral. If you want to see a few good humorous movies with the same theme rent the Birdcage, Tootsie, or Some Like it Hot. Two stars for an honest effort....It just didn't work for me.",1099526400,2,1299,4.639130434782609
2130205,3,B0002WYU02,"I was not expecting much from the movie White Chicks. In fact, the Wayans brothers make two extraordinarily ugly women and the commercial left me wondering if I really wanted to see this DVD.

I must admit that it really had some funny stuff, and Marlon Wayans impressed me with his comic timing. Some of the dialogue was bland, but Marlon gave it a sparkle that his brother just did not pull off.

I also had to dig deep to believe that the brothers disguised as women would fool anybody, but that is the beauty of fiction versus reality. Sometimes you just roll with it.

I have to confess that I would have given this movie a C or C+ if it weren't for two key scenes. Both had to do with bodily functions, so I am revealing a bit of my demented guy humor, but the scene with Marlon in the bathroom rivals that of Finch in American Pie. Marlon's scene in the restaurant reminded me of the family in Eddie Murphy's The Nutty Professor.

So take note film directors and screenwriters: if you want to score a laugh with me, insert the right amount of fart and poop scenes/jokes, and I will bump my grade up by at least  a letter or number.

Extras on the DVD include commentary, several featurettes including a few behind-the-scenes shorts, and previews.

I watched this movie the other day and I was just appalled at how stupidly absurd everything was, and I love stupid absurdity!  Most of the time it's funny.  This movie was not funny.

2130238,3,B0002WYU02,"The movie itself was very funny.  The jokes were hilarious.  Here are the reasons why I subtracted the two stars though:

1) I bought the uncut version in hopes that there would be much more gross-out comedy bits added to it that they were forced to cut out.  I wanted a little Scary Movie comedy, instead of PG-13 comedy.  The new scene with the dildo wasn't really that funny,  but the extended version of the panty sniffer made me shed a tear.

2) The concept itself is way over-done.  No more movies or shows about dudes dressing like chicks, it's just not right.  Thank God that The Wayans Bros. are as funny as they are, because they are the only ones that could have pulled off another drag queen movie

In conclusion, it's funny, but I wanted more from the uncut version.",1099353600,,779,4.422535211267606

2130242,5,B0002WYU02,"The Wayans Brothers have managed to create a very funny film despite the obvious ""drag-queen"" gags and stabs at the differences between blacks and rich whites.

This movie is laugh out loud funny and you may even find something in it to make you even laugh at yourself....we are all at risk when the Wayans are involved! Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and starring his two hilarious brothers, Marlon and Shawn, there are so many silly moments it will keep you in stitches. Marlon and Shawn are FBI agents who begin by messing up a stake out in a convenience store only to embark on another case in which they must pose as two rich heiresses in order to protect them from a kidnapping. Needless to say it sounds impossible for two handsome black men to suddenly become two likable white chicks but somehow the makeup artists manage to almost pull it off. While the initial gag rests in the fact that men are attempting to act like two cute women the true gags come in the surrounding material, with an excellent cast of comedians pulling it all off with brilliance.

Marlon and Shawn Wayans are truly funny in their roles as rich white chickies, they perfect the mannerisms and accents of spoiled ""valley girls"" while retaining just enough of their bumbling machismo to make the act even funnier. The reference to botok and silicon only makes their plastic made up faces all the more believable because we all see enough of those zombie women running around to believe a frozen cosmetic face works in our society. Surrounding the brothers is a great cast of characters all playing up the snobbish idea of life as a rich white Hamptonite complete with shopping tips (wear open toed shoes if you have a size 14 foot and buy a 12!), cosmetic slumber parties, valley girl music and Prada, Prada, Prada. The funniest character in this film however is played by Terry Crews, as basketball player Latrell Spencer, who has an appetite for rich white meat. With every stereotypical slap presented Crews just plays along and does so brilliantly and he shines during a scene where he serenades his date with a very frilly white chick song!

This movie is great for a day of laughing, at yourself and others. It is silly and meant to just be entertaining. Although the Wayans brothers could never be mistaken for real women this movie would have failed if they had perfected the art of real drag-queens. The true creativity in this film comes exactly from the imperfections, something we all have but too many of us try to cover up under layers of plastic at least the Wayans can still smile and laugh under theirs.",1099008000,,2603,4.654347826086957

I didn't go in expecting to see the best comedy of the year.  Just a few giggles here and there to past the time.  Get a sense of humor - people!!",1098921600,,492,4.170212765957447
2130244,1,B0002WYU02,"I'm not sure who the reviewers are that are raving about how hilarious this movie is, but I can be certain that they haven't TRULY seen a good comedy yet.

Maybe their young and haven't checked out previous comedies that actually ARE FUNNY. Like Trading Places, Coming to America, Caddy Shack, Bachelor Party, Dumb and Dumber, FAST TIMES or if you want an example of the WAYANS' at their funniest... rent I'M GONNA GET YOU SUCKA'.  NOW THAT'S FUNNY.

WHITE CHICKS is not only the Wayans' worst movie, it's the worst comedy I've seen in a long time.

Sorry... but I don't find fart jokes funny anymore, or obnoxious girls shrilling about going shopping, or of course you have the SEEN IT A THOUSAND TIMES BEFORE dance off scene where the Albino white chicks whip out moves from the old school and everybody oohss and aaahhhs... or the guy as girl in the women's dressing room... oh... and just because you whip out a dildo in a scene and start flopping it around, doesn't make the scene funny.

What is going on? This movie made me laugh... ONCE. The scene in the car when the big strong Latrell Spencer, played by Terry Crews, started singing the pop song and moving his head to the music...

HOW ARE THESE MOVIES GETTING MADE? Is there even a screening process anymore? Who's in charge? 12-year old boys? 45 year-old men in suits who act like 12-year old boys?

The comedy and the story are complete cookie-cutter trash. Ridiculous. Predictable. Run of the mill and when the credits roll... I said... so what, and thank god...

Not to mention, you have to suspend belief for the entire movie that these Albino Wayans' look anything remotely like the 2 girls their supposed to be.

Maybe the Wayans should have actually produced the original screenplay's concept that rumor says they STOLE from a unknown screenwriter and skewed it into this mess.

Maybe Hollywood should stop doing favors for already established Hollywood hacks who steal material because their out of ideas and start looking harder and elsewhere to produce things that are actually funny... instead of trash like this.",1098921600,6,2087,4.740331491712707

1. the friends in the movie made it seem too sappy... i.e. "" ohhh he does not notice me...""  who cares!!!!

2. some of the jokes took too long to get to the punchline

3. marlon's wife had too many parts... she was annoying most of the time....

but the highlights of the movie went to the latrell (the big black guy), the dance-off (the white girls doing the famous Janet jackson movie)  and the ""thousand miles"" scenes....
