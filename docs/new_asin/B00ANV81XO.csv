8554937,4,B00ANV81XO,"I'm delighted ""Alien Invasion"" debunked a myth commonly expressed in science fiction movies.  Aliens will not come to earth in order to obtain water, metals, or any minerals.  There is more water on Saturn's moons that found on earth.  All the metals and minerals found on earth can also be found on the asteroids and other planets in our solar system.  If there is anything valuable that aliens would want on earth, it would be our entire ecosphere.  In that eventuality, they would come to replace us.  Alien Invasion:  Are You Ready,"" explains how aliens could virtually exterminate humanity without harming our ecosphere.  To end on an optimistic note, this documentary suggests that we could successfully employ asymmetric warfare to drive them away.  Trouble is, it would not work that way.  We would not survive an EMP attack, followed by impact induced tsunamis, followed by targeted biological attacks on humans.  If aliens want our planet, we have no realistic chance of stopping them.",1481587200,,995,5.042944785276074

8554939,4,B00ANV81XO,"This is NOT a documentary, okay? It's the fictional story of an alien invasion presented in a pseudo-documentary form. I have no problem with that at all, as I rather enjoy the pseudo-documentary form of story telling as well as science fiction in general. I appreciate the fact that the film makers consulted scientific and military experts in the making of this production, as this makes the scenario more realistic than it otherwise might have been. But that doesn't change the fact that this is story-telling, not a presentation of actual or events highly likely in view of current events. Don't get me wrong. I like this little film, and I recommend it to anyone whose imagination soars high and wild. Even so, this is fiction, not fact, and we should be extremely careful about blurring the distinction between the two.",1451952000,,825,4.858156028368795

While not an in depth study of what might happen with respect to an alien invasion, it provides an interesting foundation. Readers and viewers of SF would probably enjoy it well enough.",1400112000,,249,4.681818181818182

8554944,5,B00ANV81XO,"Howdy;
I do love those Alien Invasion movies and documentary programs.  To me, it just shows humankind's arrogance. No matter how advanced the aliens are, the humans will always kick their butts...  I DON'T THINK SO!

Now, to the extra feature, ""Alien Planet"". It was longer than the main feature and the CGI was really sic. It did remind me of home a bit.

All-N-All, this is a good deal with three features and desent price. If you like space stuff (?) this disc is for you.  Its a good addition to my collection.
