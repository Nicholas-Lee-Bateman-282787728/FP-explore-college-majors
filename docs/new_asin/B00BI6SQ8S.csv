8568916,1,B00BI6SQ8S,I don't like having to adjust the aspect ratio on DVDs but unfortunately EOne Entertainment has screwed up on this one.  Unless you like your gals fat you need to correct the stretched 2.35:1 aspect ratio to the correct 1.78:1. BTW - non-anamorphic. In 2011? Shame EOne,1492732800,,269,4.723404255319149
