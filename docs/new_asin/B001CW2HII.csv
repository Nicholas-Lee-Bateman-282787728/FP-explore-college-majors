8290097,5,B001CW2HII,"Roland Kirk, master and monster.  This DVD offers the rarest of treats, to see Rahsaan Roland Kirk in '60's performances in Europe.  Two dates in '63 and one in '67.  Because of his showmanship and ability to play a multitude of instruments at once, this DVD seemed like the obvious Jazz Icons choice for visual interest.  Saw RRK in Carnagie Hall later in his career, and the performances presented here are equally as good, and the whole personality of this great, rare talent who drew from everything he heard, is compellingly clear.",1343606400,2,536,4.793478260869565
8290098,5,B001CW2HII,"If you thought that Roland Kirk's rep rested on the novelty of playing as many as three reeds simultaneously, check out this DVD. The man could play.",1301443200,2,149,4.555555555555555
8290099,4,B001CW2HII,"I purchased this last year as a gift for my hairdresser who is a 62 year old black male.  He had previously, mentioned that he liked this artist and was unable to find his work locally.  He loved this and said that he would recommend this to jazz lover or those who like this artist's work.",1275264000,,290,4.160714285714286
8290100,5,B001CW2HII,"A magnificent taste of art in motion, created by an individual who still inspires and teaches. Rahsaan was an amazing thinker, seeing through sound, sensitive to his nation's problems of race. He overcame so much, moving, inventing, creating, performing, teaching, befriending and spending himself entirely in the exhausting quest to manifest his inner heart in art. He's gone but never forgotten as we are lucky to have these little gems. In life we rarely see but disbelieve, rarely smile and cry inside at the same time. Rahsaan is up with other giant achievers, those jazz individuals who expressed their own art while instructing by force of example in creativity. Ellington, Armstrong, Parker, younger Miles and Coltrane, Mingus, so many others, gave us the love of listening and the will to play, sing, compose listen and aim at inner peace and greater understanding. Rahsaan lives for me; I played two saxes, not so well but joyously, since 1964, after hearing of him(not any actual sound) and reading in Downbeat magazine. I found I could hear riffs and phrases at least, could aim to expand thought, and even to stop my fellow musos as they laughed and wondered. Rahsaan may help a new multiple approach to expression in all arts to happen...one day. But there was only one, an under-rated and exquisite performer, full of fun, mischief, bold concepts, social awareness and unique skills. He gave the impression of such assurance, I don't recall a mistake, a notable flaw, a pause of self-doubt. So good.",1244678400,4,1514,4.988142292490118
8290101,5,B001CW2HII,"Having seen Roland Kirk three times, and spoken to him on one occasion, I was truly interested in this installment of the Jazz Icon series more than most. Little video exists of Rahsaan so this would be rare indeed. I was not disappointed.

  Here is Kirk, a decade before I would see him, playing much of the repertoire that I came to love. Also here is Kirk with the woodwind acrobatics that few could copy: playing three horns at once, playing for seamless  minutes through his ""circular breathing"" technique, and pulling out his little noisemakers (whistles, music boxes) to add punctuation to the songs.

  True to form, the three shows on the DVD are from Europe, where jazz has a much greater following than here, but who cares? Here are the shows for you and me to see. The black and white camera work is very good and the audio is clean.

  If you know about Kirk, you should have this. If you don't, this is a great introduction to one of the special musicians in jazz.",1231804800,11,979,4.480225988700565
8290102,5,B001CW2HII,"I'm so glad i found this DVD.. it's the epitome of ""cool"". did you ever want to be a beatnik? see Jazz from before rock & roll? this guy RRKirk is awesome. did you know he once fronted for Frank Zappa and they were so blown away that they gave over their time to him and then jammed together... sure would like to have filmed that!
audio quality is marginal and the video can get a little jerky, probably from converting from film to TV back in the day and then back from video tape to this DVD. doesn't deter the experience tho.
buy it for any musician you know.",1229385600,2,563,4.127272727272727
8290103,5,B001CW2HII,"Yes!!!!! from all the Kirk's released footages, this is the DVD, great images, good restoration and audio!!!",1225152000,4,108,5.411764705882353
8290104,5,B001CW2HII,"There are simply no words adequate to describe the phenomenon that was Rahsaan Roland Kirk. Dreamer and prophet are in the mix, although iconoclast probably comes closest. The fact that Kirk was blind yet could play three horns simultaneously made him the most unusual and perhaps the most inspiring figure in jazz history. Yet both those facts take a back seat to his peerless musicianship, unimpeachable swing and unlimited soul. During his all too brief career (he died in 1977 at 41), Kirk defied expectations and set standards of experimentation and achievement that few others could match. He didn't really fit into any one musical bag, although he was most conversant in the interrelated languages of soul jazz, blues, gospel and hard bop. There was certainly nobody else like him, which the performances on this Jazz Icons DVD illuminate with striking clarity. Kirk is seen in a segment of a 1963 Belgian television series; a filmed nightclub gig in Amersfoort, Holland that same year; and at a 1967 Norway jazz festival. Despite the lack of an audience in the first segment, Kirk and his bandmates (George Gruntz on piano, Guy Pedersen on bass and Daniel Humair on drums) manage to fill the television studio with some genuine musical heat as they work through a program of original material and several standards stamped with Kirk's inimitable genius. The live ambience of the nightclub setting, again featuring the same band, seems to push Kirk to an even higher level of energy and inspiration. (And it's a kick to watch the Dutch hipsters in the club drinking and smoking and grooving to Rahssan's sounds.) The jazz festival gig also finds Kirk in excellent form, this time backed by pianist Ron Burton, drummer Alex Riel, and the great Danish bassist Niels-Henning rsted Pedersen. The footage in all three segments will be a revelation for those who never had the opportunity to watch Kirk perform. Ironically, his awe-inspiring technical facility tended to overshadow what an amazing soloist he was. Unlike many of his more celebrated peers whose reliance on favorite licks and phrases sometimes compromised their spontaneity, Kirk never repeated himself, never stumbled over notes, never seemed at a loss for ideas. And always, truth and beauty and hope and sadness poured out of his horns. Anyone even remotely interested in the transformative power of jazz (which Kirk astutely dubbed ""black classical music"") needs this DVD in his or her collection.",1224460800,19,2468,5.08128078817734
