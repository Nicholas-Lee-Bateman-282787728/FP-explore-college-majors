7854200,5,6303875807,My child loved it when he loved to look at construction equipment. Also he learned much from about construction of the houses in simple manner where young children could understand and like.,1385596800,,190,4.96875
7854201,5,6303875807,"This is such a great movie, so educational... My boys and husband watch it again and again..... Love it!",1189209600,,104,4.526315789473684
7854202,4,6303875807,"My son can't stop watching House Construction Ahead! It's a good thing the music is so upbeat and great to listen to, because I have to play this movie for him at least 3 times a day. It not only shows how a house is made, but also shows where materials used to construct a house come from. My son's favorite part (and mine too, I must admit) is the blasting scene at the rock quarry. Watching what goes into building a house is really interesting to see, and this movie presents it in a fun and engaging way. The host is excellent, and explains things in really kid-friendly terms.  Forget Bob the Builder - this is one video you could put up with playing over and over and over......",1139184000,,685,4.269230769230769
7854203,5,6303875807,"This video has my two-year-old twin boys enthralled. Great footage of tools in use and their all-time favorite sequence featuring logging machines. There is some overlap with road construction ahead, but they don't mind a bit. Its all exciting stuff. I'm very picky about what I will let my kids watch. This is educational, exciting and, after watching it myself a hundred times, has nothing that might annoy adults. Two thumbs up.",1011398400,5,431,5.0
7854204,4,6303875807,"I have three young boys, ages 6, 4 and 2. This is one of the movies they like watching most, especially the 2 and 4 year old. I recommend it for young ones. If you are looking for a video devoted to the details of framing and finishing a house, this is not the video you are looking for. It is a general video that is fast paced and entertaining to young viewers.",976665600,5,363,3.9863013698630136
