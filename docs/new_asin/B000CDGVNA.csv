2458850,1,B000CDGVNA,Releasing 27 episodes for a volume 1 of the Rescue Rangers was a good idea... why is volume 1 of goof troop only 6 episodes?  Do they not plan to release this show much at all?,1135987200,11,176,3.888888888888889

2458923,5,B000CDGVNA,It seems amazon posted reviews for the older single disc release of Goof Troop volume one. Some of these reviews need to be moved to the sellers with the single disc. This set is 3 discs with 27 episodes each. The episodes are pretty good quality although the source was a video tape. The episodes have nice color and stereo sound. This show is great for the whole family.,1425859200,,372,4.405797101449275

if you have Goof Troop From the Disney Exclusive The Menu is the Same. It-is Great that Disney releasing their Disney Afternoon Cartoons on DVD's. Goof Troop is one of my Favorite Cartoons of all times from the Disney Channel & Goofy is my Favorite Disney Characters there are only 2 Volumes of Goof Troop.

2458928,4,B000CDGVNA,"This DVD set contains 27 episodes of the great Disney and Toon Disney show Goof Troop. The quality is great, the menus are nice, and so is cover-art. The only complaint I have had is that on Amazon it says these episodes have English audio and the French dub, but sadly it doesn't have the VF.  Hopefully Disney will release a final set with the remaining 25 episodes in the series.

2458929,3,B000CDGVNA,"I only received this yesterday on release day, but I was instantly disappointed to find that, while there are 3 discs of episodes, there is NO list of episodes on the case or paper insert, and ALL 3 discs rest in the same tray stacked on top of each other -- that's right, no separate slots for each disc, no separate cases, no episode list, etc. It's crazy. Talk about a ""bargain"" release. It's clear Disney put zero effort into this release. The upside is having the episodes, the downside is terrible, lazy presentation.",1421193600,17,523,4.574468085106383

2458956,5,B000CDGVNA,fun to have cartoons that you can actually let your kids watch. Grandkids love it.  parents love to watch with their kids.,1371772800,,122,4.545454545454546
2458957,5,B000CDGVNA,My grand children love the movie and have enjoyed having it in our home collection. There are never enough family movies that are clean and that you don't have to view before you kids watch them.  So we loved this movie.,1367280000,,220,4.365853658536586
2458958,2,B000CDGVNA,"This isn't a VHS, Disney! I'm very disappointed that this only contained three episodes when I was hoping for a decent set to repeat a few more times. Despite how much I love this show, this many episodes on a single disk is going to get boring to watch very fast.",1359244800,,264,4.196078431372549

2458962,1,B000CDGVNA,I should have read the reviews. I assumed that volume ment like a season. Sadly that's wrong volume for darkwing duck means 27 episodes but for goof troop you get 3 way to short. What a cheap cop out.,1346112000,,200,4.153846153846154
2458963,1,B000CDGVNA,"the fact that this disc only includes 3 episodes was so disappointing. I was expecting a collection of episodes instead I got a select, sub-par few. gave it away to a coworker and will download it from a torrent site.",1333929600,2,217,4.45
2458964,3,B000CDGVNA,"There are ALOT of people telling Disney to re-release this with more than 3 episodes. But guess what?Now that no one bought this they're not gonna release any more. The poor sales mixed with the lousy reviews means that disney won't release any more. So for loyal GOOF TROOP fans like myself we'll live off of GOOF TROOP vol. 1,the one episode that comes with A GOOFY MOVIE DVD,and the old VHS releases.",1310774400,,403,4.534246575342466

2458966,4,B000CDGVNA,"I used to watch this cartoon when I was a kid! Max is my favorite. This dvd has only three episodes the one I like is ""Wrecks, Lies, and Videotape"" that one was pretty good. But I wish Disney didn't hog all those great cartoon shows they had like goof troop, Pepperann, or Recess and Release them in complete seasons on dvd. The Disney channel today is not good like Disney Afternoon or Disney's One Saturday Morning they should bring back the old Disney cartoons from the 90s. YOU HEAR ME DISNEY FOR GOODNESS SAKES BRING BACK THOSE GOOD OLD 90s CARTOONS AT LEAST!",1289865600,,564,4.4326923076923075
2458967,3,B000CDGVNA,"Hot on the heels of the successful TV shows such as DUCKTALES, CHIP 'N DALE RESCUE RANGERS, TALE SPIN, and DARKWING DUCK, Disney decided to cast Goofy in a serial of his own, 1992's GOOF TROOP.  Here, Goofy is a surburban dad raising his 11 and a half year old son, Max, while dealing with his nasty nextdoor neighbor, Pete.  The show, very cartoonish in style and in its animation, somehow skillfully manages to make Goofy blend in with the obviously ""out of touch"" 90's era, while providing for some appealing new characterizations, not only in Max, but in his best buddy PJ (Pete's much nicer son), as well as Pete's wife and daughter, the short-tempered Peg and precocious Pistol.  There are also some very hilarious nods to the classic ""How To"" Goofy shorts in more than one episode, particularly when Goofy picks up a book which gives him instructions and we hear a stentorian narrator giving a lesson on how to perform a certain task.  (This provides for many hilarious ""breaking down the fourth wall"" moments, particularly when Goofy does something contradictory to the directions.)  GOOF TROOP was a huge success, with more than 78 episodes produced.

Given the success that Disney had in producing three-disc DVD sets for their previous shows, one would expect a similar treatment with GOOF TROOP.  Unfortunately, Disney has opted to give GOOF TROOP a single DVD release with only THREE cartoons and zero extras.  Very disappointing, but worse still, there are no plans to release the rest of the show in any format!  Such is the frustration of fans.  That this is a rather lacking compilation is all the more disappointing, as GOOF TROOP is a lot of fun, and the three episodes on this disc are laugh-out-loud riots.

""Slightly Dinghy"" -- Max manipulates everybody to go on an outrageous fishing trip to pick up some treasure in order to procure himself a videogame.  They encounter rowdy fish, a mechanical shark, and storms.

""Wrecks, Lies, and Videotape"" -- This is one of my favorite episodes on the show, in which Max tries to give his father a free vacation to Hawaii but getting him to do a stunt for the famous TV show ""America's Most Painful Videos"" (get the joke?).  Unfortunately, he lets Pete take the video to the show... this results with a hilarious nod to Goofy's role as Jacob Marley from MICKEY'S CHRISTMAS CAROL.

""Shake, Rattle, and Goof"" -- Max and PJ want to start their own rock and roll band, a wish that they later regret when both are conned into a ripoff contract with the greedy manager of Suave Records.

As mentioned, there's nothing bad about the cartoons on this DVD.  It's just that there are so many other episodes that are dying for a DVD release and that this is the only thing we've seen of GOOF TROOP on DVD at all is very unfortunate.  Disney seriously needs to give this show a better treatment.",1272758400,3,2846,4.69215291750503
2458968,1,B000CDGVNA,The first time I saw that vol. 1 of goof troop was finally on dvd I was very happy. It wasn't until I got the dvd that the happiness I felt turned into disappointment. Volumes of tv series usually consist of episodes 1-22 or 1-16. This dvd only had 3 like the previous reviews have already pointed out. On the bright side I did enjoy having goof troop on dvd and seeing the classic show again but not only 3 episodes. They really let me down. For a hardcore fan of the show it's a must have but for someone who is expecting more than three episodes...I'd say pass and wait for another release.,1248566400,,593,4.2105263157894735
2458969,4,B000CDGVNA,Our youngest son is developementally delayed and has loved everything Disney all of his life.  His Goof Troop VHS quit working and was he ever pleased to find it on DVD!!!  (and so was I!!),1239062400,,189,4.371428571428571
2458970,5,B000CDGVNA,"Another great Goof movie. The only slight disappointment was that Maxx has a very high pitch voice in this video but, you get used to it. The rest of the DVD is great full of adventure like only Disney can do. My three year old has already watched it many times. Goofy is both of our favorites and we are proud to add this DVD to our collection!",1236211200,,345,4.088235294117647
2458971,2,B000CDGVNA,"Ok this kinda makes me mad. I really always loved goof troop. It really makes me mad how disney has only released 1 dvd and it only contains three episodes. Its called volume 1. So where is volume 2?? its only been what like 4 years since this one was released? i don't get why they cant just release boxed sets like they have chip n' dale, duck tales, tale spin or darkwing duck.",1221696000,7,380,4.148648648648648
2458972,5,B000CDGVNA,"My 15 year old niece went nuts when she received the first 3 episodes of Goof Troop. I was unfamiliar with the show, but knew it was her favorite.
I would be interested in purchasing more episdoes when they become available.  I understand there are 79 in all.",1199664000,,259,4.395833333333333
2458973,1,B000CDGVNA,What you thinking Disney?  Do you think the fans who have supported you over the years so stupid that they will consider three episodes slapped on a DVD acceptable as a 'Volume 1'????  This is honestly quite offensive.  I loved this cartoon and want to see it done justice with a DVD set like DuckTales or Talespin.  And while you're at it how about doing the same for The Little Mermaid and Aladdin series.,1186185600,12,407,4.45945945945946
2458974,2,B000CDGVNA,"This series came out with about 78 episodes, and to only put 3 on volume 1 is rediculous. I hope the second will be better.",1167264000,2,123,3.96
2458975,2,B000CDGVNA,"As a child, I grew up watching The Disney Afternoon. Goof Troop was always one of my favorite shows of the bunch, and Goofy still stands as my favorite Disney character ever.

That said, I was extremely disappointed by this DVD. It only contains 3 episodes, like the Quack Pack DVD released on the same day, while the previously released Duck Tales and Rescue Rangers sets had 27. That's 1/9 of the episodes for about 1/2 the price. Adding more insult to injury, the Darkwing Duck and TaleSpin sets released since had 25 episodes. It almost makes me regret spending $10 on this disc. It just screams ""rental.""

Still, I have faith that with the release of Darkwing Duck, TaleSpin, and Gummi Bears on DVD, as well as second helpings of Duck Tales and Rescue Rangers, Disney will give Goof Troop, as well as Quack Pack, the DVD treatment it deserves. Until then, I'll just have to be optimistic and view this disc as the mouse's way of testing the waters to see if fans of the show will go for it on DVD.",1166659200,7,1002,4.440217391304348
2458976,3,B000CDGVNA,"hmm....its nice but it could be better, i hope the second volume will be better. because three episodes is not a good deal. and honestly thats why i gave it three stars.",1142553600,2,169,4.3125
2458977,2,B000CDGVNA,"This DVD release for Goof Troop is very disappointing, especially considering Disney's recent, multi-disc DVD sets for Rescue Rangers and Duck Tales.  Instead of those types of set we get a stripped down, single disc release with a mere three episodes on it.  Goof Troop of course features the adventures of long-time star Goofy and his son max, a typical, rebellious kid. Also in the cast is long time Goofy foil Pete, his wife Peg, and their son P.J.  In all Disney made 78 epidodes of the series so to give fans merely three is perplexing at best.

The shorts are ""Slightly Dingy"" in which Max and PJ go fishing with their dads and the dads wage a contest to see who the better fisherman is...

""Wrecks, Lies, and Videotape""  Max hopes to win a trip by sending in home video of his dad to The Worlds Most painful Home Videos.

""Shake, Rattle, and Goof""  Pete and Max try to form a band but their dads interfere.

The shorts are OK but hardly the best the show has to offer.  The toon's don't look like they've been enhanced in the least from their original TV appearances, only making this offering seem all the more cheap.",1140048000,46,1126,4.4487804878048784
2458978,2,B000CDGVNA,This was a great Disney serial that my boys (now young men) watched when they were little.  I have to agree with a previous reviewer who stated their displeasure that Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers and Duck Tales Volumes 1 were released as 27 episodes and Goof Troop and Quack Pack are set to be released as 6 episodes.  Disney should go for the full meal deal or not release the dvd at all: this gives the consumer a real price comparable to $67.50 retail where the other two came in at around $40.  Who's getting goofed? The consumer.  Do it right or don't bother!,1138752000,24,566,4.3619047619047615
8097888,5,B000CDGVNA,"What can I say? I love Goof Troop and all the original Disney Afternoon classic cartoons from the 90s. Although I am very thankful that Disney released these on Amazon, I do realize that if you want to purchase the entire Disney afternoon streaming collection currently available on Amazon, it is very expensive. But I did it anyways because these shows are incredibly difficult to find and I want to show my support for them so that hopefully Disney will release the rest of the missing Disney afternoon shows such as Darkwing Duck, Gummy Bears, Quack Pack, Bonkers, The Mighty Ducks, Alladdin and Marsupilami. Classic Disney cartoons in general are a hugely missed opportunity for Disney. Other toons I would love to see released are Disney's Recess and the Wuzzles, The Little Mermaid, Timn and Pumba, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Mickey Mouse Works etc In addition to all the Walt Disney Treasures films that were sold on DVD inside collector Tins. All of that should be available for streaming but it's so incredibly hard to find still. That's a ton of money that Disney could be making on streaming purchases. But this is at least a start. I really hope the fans speak with their wallets. Money talks! I love streaming Goof Troop! So many happy memories of a good show from my childhood.

8097897,5,B000CDGVNA,"Goof Troop was originally previewed on The Disney Channel from April 20, 1992 into July 12 of 1992. Goofy, a single father, moves back to his hometown of Spoonerville with his son, Max. As it happens, Goofy and Max end up moving in next door to Goofy's high school friend: Pete, a used car salesman and owner of Honest Pete's Used Cars; Pete's wife Peg, a real estate agent; and their two children, son P.J. (Pete Jr.) and younger daughter Pistol. Max and P.J. become best friends and do practically everything together. A large portion of humor comes from the relatively normal Max's personality sharply contrasting with his father.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1-Angel-cat-Angelcat-book-of-beginning/dp/1466322527/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1: Angel cat: Angelcat  book  of  beginning</a>",1515024000,,830,6.016949152542373
