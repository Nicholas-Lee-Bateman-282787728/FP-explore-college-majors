In fact, the most fun I had watching these was making up my own comments and jabs.",1261008000,3,252,3.9215686274509802
8164878,5,B000LXH0BI,"This collection should be entitled Alien Invasion. If you're like me, you hunger for SciFi movies you haven't seen 100 times. I'd only seen one movie in this collection. Most are decent enough, from classic Japanese black and white kid's movies to 1970's color Star Wars wannabes. For the price, how can you go wrong? I spent an entire weekend watching these. If they were edited a whole lot better, they'd actually be pretty good. It depends on you. If you're a SciFi fanatic,  this is a great find.",1219622400,17,500,4.617977528089888
