Gil is outstanding in these episodes and they are a bargain. buy it! it you don't like the vhs tape, just convert it to dvd and give the tape to your local library. and then buy the dvd set season 1 or the many CH dvds although they only go a bit into season 2. CH stopped making the dvds in 2004.

comments on the dvd set (season 1) (please go to the dvd section)

I hope new viewers of the show don't think that because Rawhide is in black and white that means it's old and therefore it won't be any good. That was my first reaction a long time ago and I made the mistake of not watching the show for a while. Once I saw an episode I realized how good the show was and I couldn't believe how good it was. So I urge new viewers to this series to be open minded and give the show a chance. Most of the best classic stories were written hundreds or even thousands of years ago so please don't get caught up in this modern way of thinking that 'newer is better' because that's not always true.  We need as many sales as possible from new viewers so they will release Season 2. This  DVD set Season 1 was listed in the top 100 Amazon sellers when it was realeased so hopefully that's a good start towards Parmount making their numbers.

Rawhide is a show with unique qualities that are hard to describe, buy it- you'll love it, and you'll find the black and white beautiful once you get over the brain washing we have al received by watching everything in color (it took me a few months to realize how much I liked the black and white) not that color is bad it's just were after quality not color so please don't let the black and white affect your decision. I think most of the population has this mindset of avoiding black and white and I just don't understand it.

here is a post below from another viewer that I thought might answer why Clint Eastwood never mentions Eric Fleming.

Unfortunately, the role of Rowdy Yates was never drawn to carry the show. (And the fact that he couldn't fill Eric Fleming's shoes is probably the biggest reason why he refuses to discuss the issue today.)

the ridiculous artwork

the artwork in color which is an unforgivable crime to put the most classic black and white series ever made in color.

I can't even imagine Rawhide in color so thanks to Paramount for hurting my eyes with that. I can't even look at the cover box  for more than a second and will most likely destroy it so it doesn't damage my mind! At this point though, I just want the series, so if they feel it's a good marketing method I guess do it, I just think it would be better like Columbia House did it in black and white. They could misguide new purchasers of the series also into thinking it's a color series.

Note this series is way less than what Columbia House was charging so buy it. It's a bargain.",1156550400,5,2984,4.1975524475524475
