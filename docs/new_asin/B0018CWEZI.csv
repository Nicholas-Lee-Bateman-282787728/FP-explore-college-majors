3415312,2,B0018CWEZI,"The fact that they did not bother to bring the show back after the strike, and one only recently started showing reruns leading up to the season primiere tells you that there were problems. I am hopeful that Shondra can turn it around for season 2.

I'll stay away from giving away any storylines and just give my views. My biggest problem is that you have these succesful, well established. middle aged doctors running around like kids who just moved into thier first apartment. It's hard to believe Addison Sheppard can't find a guy to give her the time of day. I can tolerate and actually enjoy this type of behavior on Grays Anatomy  because 1) they are younger and just out of med school it seems more believable 2) it was original when they did it.

Unless they make serious changes, this show will fail for all the reason the Apprentice 2 with Martha Stewart failed. No one wants to see a lesser version of a popular show. especially with an out of place , inferior cast.",1219449600,8,978,4.48314606741573
3415313,5,B0018CWEZI,"I loved this show from the beginning and I couldn't wait for season 1 on dvd and can't wait for season 2 to start, Check it out it's really a great show.",1219104000,3,153,3.8125
3415314,5,B0018CWEZI,"this is not as dramatic or polished as the show it spun-off from, grey's anatomy, but its still a nice dramedy with some fine acting from Kate Walsh. Fun and sunny, its worth your time if you love the character of Dr. Addison Montgomery.",1219017600,4,237,4.409090909090909
3415315,2,B0018CWEZI,"Shonda Rimes, famous for the groundbreaking and all around excellent medical soap opera ""Grey's Anatomy"" has made a big mistake. That mistake, deciding to produce and create the super dud ""Private Practice."" While the idea for the show was fresh and witty, it came out terribly. First of all, the show has none of the soap opera goodness, it is a boring and unbelievable episodic dramedy. The characters are all wrong. KaDee Strickland's role as the painfully annoying Charlotte King is in no way amusing. Also, Audra McDonald truly can not act, and Taye Diggs character was not adapted enough. He was more of a secondary character. It is especially painful to watch because the show could have been good. I just hope Shonda Rimes will make a few changes before season two airs. If the show were more soap operatic with recurring plots and had better writers and actors it might be something.",1218412800,6,892,4.798701298701299
3415316,5,B0018CWEZI,"Private Practice was a sleeper when it came out, meaning, it came out of no where and with each episode it got better and better.  I don't think anyone expected it to do well, I still think a lot of people haven't given it a chance.  DO.  It will be worth it.

The format for this show is the same as Grey's, a mix of medical drama and character drama/storylines.  Both are entertaining, fun and intelligent.  I am so pleased with this season of PP.  I was worried it might bomb, but every week the show got better & better in my opinion.  In part, it always takes a while for the characters to sort of grow on me.  More and more I found myself anticipating the next show and enthralled at the character developments.

If you missed the first season of PP, get it on DVD.  Don't miss the second season, I have a feeling it's only going to get bigger & better!",1215561600,13,859,4.176829268292683
3415317,5,B0018CWEZI,"I absolutely love this show (I saw almost all of it when I was in America and thankful for that because Australia is last again).  It's fantastic and addictive and funny and so enjoyable.  If I'm going to be completely honest, the main reasons I began watching this is because of Tim Daley and Taye Diggs.  Especially Tim - he's so cute.  But I found myself getting really involved with the story lines and the characters and now have a new favourite show.
After the initial episode of seeing the crossover from Greys to Private, we see the first episode called In Which We Meet Addison, a Nice Girl From Somewhere Else (all the episodes are called In Which ...) where she joins the Oceanside Wellness Group where she was offered a job.  The clinic is mostly owned by one of her best friends in college.  One of the other workers there is Dr Pete Wilder (Tim Daley) who throughout the season, she has a strong strong chemistry with.  It makes for very interesting situations.  Some of the episodes are written by Shondra Rhimes so they still have a Greys feel to them.
I have to say that I really like this more than Greys.  The characters are all fantastic and complex and that helps make this show great.  I'm so lucky that I got to see a lot of this when I was in America last year because as usual, Australia is behind the rest of the world with most things and I have no clue when we are getting this.  I just hope my copy of this dvd comes before we get to FINALLY see it over here.  I love this program and can't wait to own the dvd.  I highly recommend it.",1212537600,21,1564,4.261016949152542
3415318,5,B0018CWEZI,"This show just got better and better with each episode.  It came into its own, finding a great balance between comedy and drama.  The acting is wonderful, Kate Walsh is SPECTACULAR, she just keeps adding more and more layers to the character we have all come to love as the beautifully complicated Dr. Addison Montgomery.  Amy Brenamann is wonderful as the talented and flawed Violet. Tim Daly is great as the sexy complex quack Pete.  Taye Diggs is deliciously HOT, funny, somewhat dorky, but still manly Sam, Audra McDonald is great as the ex-wife who is trying to keep it all together but you can see that she is on the brink of breaking down completely, and Paul Adelstein is a maverick of talent.  LOVE this show I definitely see nominations for the show and the actors in the near future especially for our AMAZINGLY talented leading lady Kate Walsh.

I am so excited for this series to come out.  I miss this AMAZING show.  I can't wait till it comes back this fall.",1210982400,22,973,4.551724137931035
3415319,5,B0018CWEZI,"Private Practice - a spin-off from the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy - debuted in September 2007, with Addison Forbes Montgomery (the beautiful Kate Walsh) starting a new life in a private practice medical clinic in LA.

Many have tried to compare the show to Greys, which should be avoided as it has an entirely different tone - lighter, funnier & less OTT-angsty than Greys.  It also benefits from being set where it is actually filmed & features location filming out-and-about in LA.

Kate Walsh shines as Addison & easily carries the show.  She is surrounded by a small core cast of experienced & talented actors - Tim Daly, Audra McDonald, Taye Diggs, Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Chris Lowell & KaDee Strickland.

After a rocky first episode, the writing improved as the series progressed & the show started to find its own identity & distance from Greys.

It was the highest-rated new drama this year & one of the first freshman shows to be picked up for an entire 22-ep run, but sadly the US writer's strike shortened the season to only 9 episodes.

ABC have chosen to re-launch their successful new shows in Fall 08, which is when Private Practice will return with Season 2 to anchor the Wednesday night line-up.

The extras for this DVD release are -

1. Kate Walsh - Practice makes Perfect (Working Title) - spend some quality time with Kate Walsh & get a taste of her life beyond the confines of the Private Practice Set
2. Alternative Ensemble : Behind the Scenes of Private Practice
3. Two Extended Episodes
4. Deleted Scenes
5. Bloopers
6. Audio Commentaries",1210464000,26,1578,4.7299270072992705

BUT.  I AM EXTREAMLY UNHAPPY THE REST OF THE SEASONS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE WITH AMAZON PRIME.
THIS SHOW (PLUS 2 OTHERS) WERE THE MAIN REASON I SUBSCRIBED TO PRIME.

3415397,5,B0018CWEZI,This was a great reunion to Private Practice. Enjoyed seeing the characters from the beginning. I am confused to why this is being deleted from options to view by Amazon. They had done the same to Grey's Anatomy which I really miss now.,1389916800,,236,4.511627906976744

3415399,4,B0018CWEZI,"I'm very 'behind the times' in renewing my interest in Private Practice.  I was looking for something to use on my one month 'free trial' of Amazon and this fit the bill.  I like following the characters in medical dramas and the unusual situations addressed.  It is a time filler when I have an hour or 2 to relax here and there.  I'm getting a little tired of the personal conflicts and would like more emphasis on medical issues, but that is what most series succumb to eventually.  But, fun to fill time.  I absolutely LOVE Grey's Anatomy, so that is where my interest in Private Practice originated.
I do not enjoy the fact that Amazon is NOT compatible with Chromecast.  I have to watch on my IPad right now.",1389312000,,714,4.446153846153846

3415416,5,B0018CWEZI,"Great spin off of Grey's anatomy. Love the continuation of Addison Montgomery's story. I will add, you don't have to be a Grey's fan to watch/like Private Practice. There are plenty of other characters and a great story line for first timers",1384387200,,241,4.761904761904762

3415419,5,B0018CWEZI,I absolutely adore this show!!! <3 :-) It's so compelling and intriguing. I can't get enough. I'm so glad I've found a way to watch seasons 1-5 all at once rather than waiting a week for a new episode. Definitely a better way to go if you can wait.

3415460,5,B0018CWEZI,"This was an exciting series for me because I loved the actor ""Addison"" on Grey's Anatomy.  It all starts with Addison joining a new medical practice located down by the beach with several college's and a best friend.  Theirs lots of fun times being together but helping their patients and saving lives are the norm.  You will find drama, romance, and friends helping friends.  This is a medical practice with  five doctor's who grow to like one another and it is like a family of sorts.  This is a series suited for the adult viewer or very mature teenager's.  Give it a viewing, I think you'll like it.",1374537600,,603,4.527777777777778

Did this go on for at least 8 seasons? Sometimes I'll skip ahead, hoping the first few episodes were just struggling to find its flow.  Maybe I'll do that.  I watch Grey's Anatomy, which I found annoying for a while, till the characters started acting more like adults. Even then, though, some plot lines are tiring. Then they work a 'spin off' with Addison?  Of all people.",1372204800,,528,4.898876404494382

3415466,5,B0018CWEZI,"My wife started watching this and I'm not usually a fan of weekly TV series however; now that I can watch them whenever I want using Amazon Prime, I have become a convert.  On Private Practice the writing is great, the actors are great and the characters they play display all of the foibles of everyday people, even though almost all of the main characters M.D's or PhD's.

Again, I have to give Kudo's to the writers of this series. There are surprises at every turn, some deeply emotional and some that are just downright hilarious. It's definitely worth watching but be careful, it's like a page turner book. You can and will watch episodes one after another until you realize it's Midnight and should have been asleep hours ago!

Plus, it is definitely for mature audiences so that makes it even more attractive to me to me watch.

We've just finished Season 3 and like a number of other dramatic series on other streaming channels, we watch an entire series from Season One to the last available Season pretty much back to back.",1370390400,,1034,4.603260869565218

3415480,4,B0018CWEZI,I really enjoyed watching Private Practice just as I enjoy Grey's Anatomy. Both shows are a roller coaster of emotions and senerios. A lot of romance and heartache. Definately worth watching!,1366243200,,191,5.193548387096774

3415523,4,B0018CWEZI,"I was skeptical at first about the show Private Practice.  I only discovered Grey's Anatomy about six months ago, and was immediately hooked.  I love how it makes me laugh and cry in all the same episode.  I wasn't a big Addison fan in Grey's Anatomy.  I actually disliked her a lot in the first season, but warmed up to her in the seasons to follow.

When they introduced the Private Practice cast in an episode of Grey's Anatomy, I was pretty intrigued with the characters.  I thought it was neat how they looped the two shows together.  I decided to give Private Practice a shot when I was completely caught up with Grey's Anatomy, and I was glad I gave it a chance.

Addison's character is a lot different, in my opinion, in Private Practice.  It's almost like she's not the same person as she was in Grey's Anatomy.  The character is written a bit differently, but is still likeable.  The show does have a lot of emotion in it, which makes for a good show.

Give this show a chance.  You won't regret it!",1352851200,,1009,4.360215053763441

3415525,2,B0018CWEZI,I have to say I thought I will be glad that my favorite character from Grey's will get her own show. But this show is under mediocre. There is no gripping atmosphere we found in GA. A small clinic and there's nothing they actually doing. Talking about sex and relationships and solving medical cases. I'm disappointed with the lack of brilliance in the writing. I don't know if it improves but I didn't like this first season. 6.5/10.,1324684800,2,434,4.576923076923077

3415528,3,B0018CWEZI,"Funnily enough Addison is my least favourite character in Grey's Anatomy, but in Private Practice she takes a much more likeable role. This spin-off has nothing on Grey's but it is strangely addictive. Violet is bit annoying, but Cooper and Del are the real stars. The paediatrician and office manager are a likeable pair, and make the story lines a little bit more believable. The plots are a bit off the reality-scale in general, but it's easy-viewing.",1302393600,2,454,4.909090909090909

Although I do not think it is as good as Grey's it's entertaining in its own way. The set up is definitely more laid back and the show doesn't move as fast or have the same degree of melodrama as Grey's either. If you are a Grey's Anatomy fan, enjoy medical dramas or even soapy primetime tv, I would check this out.",1284076800,,436,4.2023809523809526

3415553,5,B0018CWEZI,"This was a great season 2 of Private Practice.  I love the ensemble of actors they have for this show.  It's the grown up version of Grey's Anatomy without being boring or too serious.  It's based on the same concept of dealing with patients and their problems and having those mirror what's going on with the characters.

I liked the point in the season where you see the practice kinda take on the effects of Sam and Naomi's divorce fallout. These 2 characters were a married couple and started a whole body medical practice.  When the series starts in Season 1 they've gone through a divorce and still maintained their medical practice and are almost ""too fine"".  They juggle joint custody of their daughter and they're just very civil.  By Season 2 you start to see how their break really affected their practice.  Naomi's management of the practice sees some financial troubles and she avoids telling the other partners. They are very upset and when they confront her a coup ensues and it really tears things apart.  They survive of course.

There are other relationship melodramas and a key partner of the practice gets seriously injured by a patient.

It's just really a well told season of stories that go together.  You get to watch the characters grow up and love and heal their patients.
I love this show.  Thank you Shonda Rhimes!  I'm not sure if it's my age or what but, this is exactly what tv needed her creative genius and writing style.  I'm a huge fan of Grey's and this is better!",1271894400,,1500,4.607547169811321

3415555,2,B0018CWEZI,"Spin-offs of TV series are rarely as good as the original, and ""Private Practice"" is a perfect example.  Some reviewers have cautioned us not to try to compare this to ""Grey's Anatomy,"" but that is impossible--for me, at least.  ""Grey's Anatomy"" was about the journey of five young interns on their way to becoming surgeons.  The first two or three seasons were fascinating, but then it faded, and out of that fade was born ""Private Practice.""

Set in Los Angeles it is about doctors who treat people with holistic medicine, acupuncture, psychiatry, doctors who do not dress like doctors, doctors who drink white wine and look as if they just dropped in the office from the beach.  The story lines are most often about people problems, rather than medical problems.

And as such, I just didn't find it worth watching when there are so many other better things.",1267056000,6,860,4.777027027027027
3415556,1,B0018CWEZI,"In this spin-off, the meanest, dullest, least-liked character of Grey's Anatomy is plucked out and given focus in an entirely new show. One of the dumbest ideas in the history of television.

3415557,1,B0018CWEZI,"I love when a favorite show gets a spinoff...it's like ice cream on cake, whip cream on your cappucino.  Not this time.  Great actors completely wasted by no story or drama or development.  Gossip, sex, doctors treating patients is boring and worthless without characters that are likeable and actual storylines that lead to and from the gossip, sex and medical stuff.  Sadly, Four episodes later it still seemed like pointless gossip, arguing, sex and medical stuff with no depth.  BORING and the most disappointing part is it was a spin off of a great show.  Even worse, it got renewed, while other great shows were cancelled, just because it was a spin off of a great show but not any good on it's own.",1242864000,2,705,4.645161290322581

But, I love this show now and forever!  I was soooo disappointed when the writer's strike interfered with the show, and then it didn't come back to finish the season!!  I can't wait til season 2 starts and I find out what happens with Addison and the cop...and Addison and Pete!",1222214400,3,446,4.273809523809524
3415579,2,B0018CWEZI,"I rather like ""Private Practice"".  It's often implausible, but that's one of the features of escapist entertainment.  The cast is talented and attractive.  I'm looking forward to watching the new season.  But I can't give this first DVD set a good review, because it just isn't a good value.

Due to the writers' strike, Season One of ""Private Practice"" only had 9 episodes.  A normal season is 22 shows.  But this collection's list price is the same as for a full season.  The producers, having taken a major financial hit by not having as much advertising revenue as expected, are trying to recoup some of their costs from us by overpricing this set.  I can't condone that.

I rate this collection 3-4 stars for quality, but only 0-1 stars for value.  That gives a combined rating of 2 stars: disappointing.",1220659200,30,809,4.707142857142857
