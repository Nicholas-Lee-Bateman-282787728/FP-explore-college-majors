8104012,4,B000E1NWNM,"Despite years of frustration and disappointment, Jeremy Gilley continues to believe that he can make a difference.  I admired his courage and his steadfast devotion to a day of peace.  It is an inspirational video about pursuing your dreams.  One of his key points is that we have this day set aside for global peace...and no one knows about it.  So watch the video, and spread the word.  As Jeremy says, we may not see it realized next year, or in our lifetime, or even in 100 years, but at least we will have tried to establish peace for a day!",1361059200,,546,4.366336633663367
8104013,3,B000E1NWNM,"its a sweet story but this documentary was pretty boring to watch I couldn't finish it too much of nothing happening, I give it 3 stars for the idea its good",1202256000,,157,4.096774193548387
8104014,4,B000E1NWNM,"I liked how different this documentary was, about a man trying to get a day of the year designated as ""World Peace Day"" by the United Nations.  It's educational regarding how the UN works, but not very entertaining.  Still worth watching.",1199232000,,238,4.780487804878049
8104015,5,B000E1NWNM,"Have you ever wondered if individuals can make a difference? Then you will be amazed by the drive of Jeremy Gilles who in this documentary puts his life and passion behind his dream to globally establish a day of ceasefire and peace.

Jeremy writes to every head of state and Peace Nobel Laureates about his dream. He meets Kofi Annan at the UN, the Dalai Lama and many presidents. If you are somehow interested in a better world then this movie is for you! To see Jeremy's drive and the ups and downs of this campaign are incredible.",1184889600,2,534,4.448979591836735
8104016,4,B000E1NWNM,"The British film maker Jeremy Gilley documents his personal campaign to establish a single day of global peace and non-violence. In fact, he discovered that Costa Rica had won approval for an original international day of peace back in 1981, so Gilley's quest was to reinvigorate the day with a new and fixed date, September 21 of every year at the United Nations. It took five years of meetings with school children, Nobel Peace laureates, heads of states, NGO bureaucrats, media moguls and even the Dalai Lama, but on September 7, 2001 the United Nations voted unanimously to approve a resolution to designate every September 21 as the new International Day of Peace. In the bitterest of ironies, Kofi Annan was scheduled to ring the peace bell and proclaim the change on September 11, the last day of peace before the new, fixed date on September 21 took effect the following year. Yes, the documentary includes Gilley's naysayers who derided his quest as a hapless and romantic gesture, but I for one join those who saluted him for doing anything and everything to encourage humanity to forsake violence and war.",1169596800,3,1116,4.878947368421053
8104017,5,B000E1NWNM,"I bought this DVD after searching on-line for an input for a day of retreat for a group of ""associates"", women and men who share the spirituality and mission of our religious community, and some religious sisters who were drawn to the title, ""Peace One Day,""  All were deeply moved by the story of one person trying to make a difference, a real peace-maker.  All were surprised that we had not heard about this in the U.S. media.  Several individuals plan to gather small groups of neighbors and friends to show this in their own homes.  The fact that the day of this retreat was right after the starting this year of the UN General Assembly and the anniversary of 9/11 added to the impact.  It was a very well made video.",1163030400,5,722,4.4393939393939394
8104018,5,B000E1NWNM,"See the power of one man's conviction to make the world a better place inspire the UN to create a worldwide ceasfire day.  Sound overly-idealistic?  Sound like just another ""day"" that comes and goes like any other?  Not quite.  This movie shows the strength of the human spirit and the ability each one of us has to improve the human condition.  Watch this movie and dream big.",1145923200,9,377,4.567164179104478
