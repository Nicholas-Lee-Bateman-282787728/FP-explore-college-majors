8657511,5,B00KC8UZTQ,"Kevin Miller takes the audience on a inside view of what long-suffering means. As he develops relationships with the homeless and the men and woman who have dedicated a part, if not all of their life, to love and care for the marginalized daily. It cuts to the quick in exposing the attitudes, beliefs towards the men and woman who have been looked at as less than because of their choices in life that led them to become homeless. Kevin helps their voice be heard and shows there's a real need to come together and help out whenever we can. You cannot just throw s*** at the problem and expect it to go away. I was touched and moved to tears many times throughout this documentary because personally it showed me what long suffering loves looks like with flesh on in our daily routine. One by one we can make a difference in the lives of those who struggle with their humanity and need our help. I recommend this documentary highly !",1411344000,,934,4.436046511627907
