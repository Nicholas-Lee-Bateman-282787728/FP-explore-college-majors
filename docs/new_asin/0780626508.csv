7789622,5,0780626508,What can I say I loved this video. To me Kevin Nash is one of the best big man(if not the best)in the business. He helped revolutionize wrestling. This video shows just how creative this guy is. It also shows great highlights of some of his best matches and promos. I guess the only down side is that its not long enough and to me giving Nash just an hour or so video is a shame. I can't blame W.C.W. for that because D.V.D.s were not as big as they are now and its not like they could come out with a three tape deal. Over all this tape is a great buy for any true fan. Together with Nash speaking on the video and of course the N.W.O. stuff it is great addition for any true wrestling collector or historian. I feel anytime you get old W.C.W. tapes you should grab them because it seems that the W.W.F. will never truly release all the great stuff from W.C.W. and the stuff they have released is good but true fans want and demand more. I ranted long enough so quote Nash BUY THE VIDEO!,1252713600,,988,4.097938144329897
