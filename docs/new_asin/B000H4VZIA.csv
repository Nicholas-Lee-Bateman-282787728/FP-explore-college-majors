8136277,3,B000H4VZIA,"The main draw here is the production by Pier Luigi Pizzi, taped in 2005 at the Liceu in Barcelona. Pizzi takes Ponchielli's opera seriously and manages a coherent point of view. His design is no-fuss -- stairs are a prominent feature, with twin sets on either side of the stage sometimes joined into one, recalling Svoboda's famous minimalist VESPRI. But with its built-in canal and gondolas, stage mist/fog, and severe color scheme (the impressive costumes dominated by reds, blacks, and grays, from which Gioconda's bright blue dress provides relief), the production nevertheless manages specificity and atmosphere. Pizzi's dramatic focus is harsh, anti-romantic. This Venice is a bleak world, rotting with corruption, evil people at the top easily goading the simpletons at the bottom into mindless cruelty. Within this miserable environment, the few sympathetic characters cling to what decency they can find: Gioconda to her old and enfeebled mother, Gioconda and Laura to the shaven-headed seaside thug Enzo, Enzo to the matronly and unglamorous Laura. Pizzi is sensitive in his treatment of Gioconda's relationship with her mother. Early on, daughter hugs mother affectionately as the latter claps along to the regatta chorus; their bond is established in a few light strokes. The director also does good work with the chorus and supernumeraries, who effectively convey the mob mentality at its ugliest (bullies block and taunt Gioconda, as if playing ""keep-away"" in a schoolyard, when she attempts to prevent the lynching of her mother).

The most noteworthy video competition is the DVD (formerly on Image, now Kultur) of a 1986 Vienna State Opera production headlined by Eva Marton and Plcido Domingo. Which one is to be preferred seems to be a matter of disagreement. I will start by saying neither is anything close to a great representation of the opera (a work for which I easily admit fondness and, yes, respect) on the musical level. But the first buy of those presently available should be the '05 Liceu production under review, which has a real, engrossing production. The Vienna is an old-fashioned, lifeless, and ultimately tiring stand-and-sing affair. The Liceu shows infinitely more care for matters of blocking and attitude, and this counts for much when dealing with a video recording. Pizzi does not have great actors at his disposal, but he gets the best he can out of them; their Vienna counterparts are largely on autopilot. The Liceu also has the better Act Three ballet. In fact, the erotically charged pas de deux of Angel Corella and Letizia Giuliani, with the 12 supporting ballerinas dressed in a rainbow of colors, deservedly gets the loudest and longest applause of the evening.

Vocal comparison between '86 Vienna and '05 Barcelona is not a rewarding undertaking. This is a difficult opera to cast satisfactorily, and there is not much good news in either performance. The newer release's one truly great contribution is the La Cieca of Ewa Podles; it is a treat to hear this music sung by a genuine contralto rather than a second Laura faking depth. There is also a correct, reptilian Alvise from Carlo Colombaro, outclassing the bass on the Vienna DVD. Elisabetta Fiorillo, once Cieca on the Urmana/Domingo audio recording, has been promoted here to Laura, with unfocused, viscous results; a slight edge to Vienna's Ludmila Semtschuk, who is not stylish or subtle but sings as well as Fiorillo does and has a more elegant carriage on stage. Carlo Guelfi's Barnaba is colorless throughout his range, pinched and nasal on top; he is less effective than Vienna's aged but sure-handed Matteo Manuguerra. (Guelfi loses one more point late with the feeblest solution to Barnaba's final vocalization -- the wordless grunt/groan/scream of frustration at Gioconda's ""escape"" -- in my memory.)

At the top of the order, there is not one stellar performance among the pairings of Deborah Voigt/Richard Margison (Barcelona) and Eva Marton/Plcido Domingo (Vienna). Voigt was recently status post gastric bypass and had lost plushness and support. There are some nice moments along the way, but the wizened, hollow middle that would be even more of a debit in Italian rep by the 2010-11 centenary FANCIULLAs was already in evidence here. She makes the role sound more physically strenuous and draining than one might expect from a working Isolde and (recently) Brnnhilde. There is commitment but no particular profile to her acting; fierceness and animal intensity are not her strong suit. Margison's is the kind of unexciting and unlovely performance, without major calamity, that one calls ""professional."" This match-up, then, seems to favor vintage Marton/Domingo, but neither heavy-hitter is in best form on the '86 video performance we have. The soprano has poor control over an instrument of impressive size; the tenor, then recovering from surgery, sounds tired and strained. Much of the music lies uncomfortably for him, and some high notes are obviously tracked in from another source, audio being out of sync with picture. Surprisingly, Domingo's much later audio recording on EMI is a better official souvenir of his Enzo.

Conductor Daniele Callegari leads the Barcelona performance with greater vitality and connection to this idiom than are managed by Adam Fischer, whose Vienna performance begins with out-of-tune strings in the prelude and never recovers from that inauspicious start. This is a reminder that even the most prestigious ensemble is capable of a listless, out-of-sorts showing if not motivated and galvanized.

Picture and sound of the Barcelona set (the opera is spread over two discs) are very good. The subtitled English translation of Arrigo Boito's much-mocked libretto evidences more grace and discretion than the one on the Vienna DVD. This opera is going to have its share of ripe, pulpy dialogue no matter what, but the wording and syntax choices made for the earlier release do it no favors -- they make it seem indefensible.",1308873600,8,5992,5.198757763975156
8136278,5,B000H4VZIA,The ballet scene in this opera made it a must. I played it over and over. The rest of the opera is good but not great.,1234051200,,118,3.576923076923077
8136279,4,B000H4VZIA,"Let's do some justice here;there aren't many grounds to stage such an ordinary opera and its ridiculous plot just as ""La Gioconda"" surely is. A fine and powerful soprano performing the title role would be a strong reason to do that. You must to hear the thing at live once to catch that;clearly,Deborah Voigt's straussian voice is a challenge to the best of sound engineers,especially in its top register. So,I agree to Mr. Mardigan and maybe some of rewiewers bellow should scrutinize their stereo systems,then turn over and over again the Barcelona production in order to discover an infallible,golden tone-Gioconda that puts on shame most of Voigt's so acclaimed predecessors on this atrocious part. Especially amazing is her performance on final act;there aren't a single evidence of weariness in her voice,not even on that kind-of-coloratura duetto with Barnaba on last bars of the score. The only reason to one regrets would be her decision on devotes herself to such a poor music like this one(oh,please;go back to R.Strauss!).Anyway,besides the pleasure to watch her video premire just here,my opinion is that Barcelona team provides an enjoyable performance,well staged with ""gondolas"" and beautiful wardrobe. Margison sings a fine Enzo,even it's hard a bit to conceive a bald and some overweight leading man in these High-Def times. Guelfi,Podles and the conductor are just ok if not all that great but Liceo's audience was very kind about its ""La Cieca"" that evening. Seconda Donna,Elizabetta Fiorillo runs attempting ""to get the better of"" for trying to crumble her colleagues so obviously. However her old fashioned singing and acting are just a gross performance of Laura Adorno;honestly,I was satisfied because she's sleeping most of time. Orchestra plays just ""on average"";my former Liceo dvd experiences(Wagner,Britten)and this one are not the best ones;surely there are problems to solve,especially on horns section. Much better was its big chorus and the couple of principal naked dancers.",1195948800,6,2008,5.3575949367088604
8136280,5,B000H4VZIA,This is the most satisfctory of DVD opera recordings.  All of the singers project beautifully and the ballet is memorable.  The only downside is the lack of hair on the hero.,1178409600,4,174,4.580645161290323
8136281,5,B000H4VZIA,"Excellent conducting, wonderful Deborah Voight, and all other principles make for a gripping experience of this often ridiculed opera. The Cieca, Barnaba, Enzo, Alvize..all are superbly sung, and this is a very demanding opera on all voices..but here there is sheer beauty and high drama and high notes in all the designated places, not short tops with Deborah Voight, ever!

Since Voght has lost so much weight, she acts with great force, and her voice now has those high notes, heretofore not focused at all.

The sets are very sparse, but it really is the vocal drama that dominates this, and here it is very compelling.

There are other versions, but this is the best, and there are CD versions to match..especially Callas' La Gioconda and Marton's on CBS. Avoid tat Umana one, but Placido Domingo is great.

Buy this and revel in the romance and the vendetta and that blazinbg final scene..all there before you in tantalizing sound!",1165363200,14,937,4.8742138364779874
8136282,4,B000H4VZIA,"Ponchielli's La Gioconda is exceedingly difficult to mount, largely because it requires six principal singers who are not only larger than life but required to sing very difficult music. There is no completely satisfying CD set of the opera, and the same is, alas, true of the choice of DVDs. This one has some things to recommend it, not least the stylish, almost minimalist but still traditional staging and sets by Pier Luigi Pizzi. Among the singers the standouts are the Barnaba of Carlo Guelfi and the Alvise of Carlo Columbara. Ewa Podles's La Cieca has its moments, but there are also some passages where the voice turns a bit fuzzy. Her acting was excellent, however. The Laura of Elisabetta Fiorillo is frankly negligible, both vocally and histrionically.

Which brings us to the main characters, Gioconda and Enzo Grimaldo. The Canadian tenor Richard Margison is a fine dramatic tenor and his performance overall is quite good, and I found his 'Cielo e mar' to be stirring. He is not a great actor, but the noble and stalwart character of Enzo doesn't really require much in the way of subtlety. This performance was recorded in 2005 and Deborah Voigt, the Gioconda, had lost a good amount of weight but it sounds as if her voice had not quite settled with the change in her body. Still, the voice rides above the ensemble when necessary. Her big aria, 'Suicidio', is not a triumph, however; there is a husky quality that creeps into the voice during that so-important dramatic third act aria. Otherwise, she was a believable and generally enjoyable Gioconda, especially in the lyrical passages.

By far the high point of this production is the Dance of the Hours in Act III. Choreography is by Gheorghe Iancu and it is utterly charming. Basically there is a corps de ballet of twelve women representing the twelve hours of the day and night and two soloists, ngel Corella and Letizia Giuliani, the latter virtually topless. The solo dancers'  choreography is both virtuosic and erotic. There is no doubt about why the audience went crazy at the conclusion of the dance. And it deserved all the applause it got.

The orchestra of Barcelona's Teatre del Liceu, under Daniele Callegari,  is excellent and they are particularly good in the gossamer passages of the Dance of the Hours.

This is not the ultimate Gioconda but it will do until something better comes along.

8136283,4,B000H4VZIA,"Ponchielli was a contemporary of Verdi. Arrigo Boito, the composer of the opera Mefistofele, and the librettist of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra and his two final masterpieces, Otello and Falstaff, wrote the libretto for this opera. La Gioconda is a beautiful opera although not on the level of Verdi's best scores. But it contains a few hits like the soprano beautiful aria Suicidio or the tenor very famous aria Cielo e mar. The baritone act one monologue O monumento is very close to Jago's Credo monologue in Verdi's opera. And there is of course the very famous and charming Dance of the hours...

I am quite familiar with the works of the Italian director Pier Luigi Pizzi from a few DVDs of his staging that I have. I like his working method. His stage is never overcrowded and beautified a la Zeffirelli. But it is always very aesthetic and does not have a ragged look either like in the work of a few German directors that I have seen lately... there are a few ravishingly scenes, like the burning in the ship that closes Act II. The conductor Daniele Callegari is doing a fine job and the Liceu orchestra is playing splendidly.

Deborah Voigt is singing the title role. I am not completely convinced that her voice and singing is ideal for the Italian repertoire, but I liked what I heard and was especially impressed in the big ensembles when the voice is heard clearly over the loud chorus and orchestra. The Suicidio aria was done decently, but I heard better versions.

In the leading tenor role of Enzo Grimaldo was singing the Canadian tenor Richard Margison. The voice is beautiful in the lower range, but the high notes are forced. The great hit Cielo e mar was fine but not brilliant. His lover, Laura was sung by Italian Mezzo Elisabetta Fiorillo. She is fine. So is her husband Alvise, sung here by the very good Italian bass Carlo Colombara. Italian baritone Carlo Guelfi sings here the baritone role, Barnaba. He is an experienced performer, but I heard better rendering of this role. His O monumento monologue is very effective. Last is Gioconda mother La Cieca. She was sung here by Polish contralto Ewa Podles. She is a great artist with an impressive stage presence and good acting abilities, but alas, her voice here is not in good shape. I hardly recognized her voice, but the audience loved her performance...

And a few final statements about the dance of the hours: the way it is done here is absolutely charming: twelve female dancers in colorful dresses to indicate the months (?). The solo couple, ngel Corella and Letizia Giuliani is nothing less than amazing!! The audience went crazy after the dance, with very loud and long applause.

To sum up: this is not an ideal performance, but it has its fine moments. I liked it. Technical quality is first class. There is another DVD version for this opera that was filmed in 1985 at the Vienna state opera with Marton and Domingo. This version remains first choice for this opera on DVD overall, but the spectacular Dance of the Hour at the Liceu is far superior to the one from Vienna!!",1158364800,35,3064,4.666666666666667
