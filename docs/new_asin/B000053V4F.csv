1389776,2,B000053V4F,"A map purporting to show the whereabouts of a pirate ship from the eighteenth century ,together with its treasure,falls into the hands of a high schooler who ,along with his friends who are in on the story  use the cover of  a field trip to  hunt for rocks in the desert to  search for the ship. The vessel has  ended up in the middle of Arizona-quite a feat and wholly improbable !The party of students and their teachers -a likeable dweeb of a science teacher and a new young female teacher -are not the only ones in the vicinity. There is a villainous archaelogist-a tiresome nasty Englishman stereotype ,and a man in period costume claiming to be a ghost but who is nothing of the sort .

I lost interest in this pretty early .It is what The Goonies would be like minus  its talented cast and pacy direction .The cast is an ability free zone and they have all had successful charisma bypass operations .The effects are dire and the comedy tiresome

This is mainly for undemanding juvenile audiences only and even their patience will be tried",1208476800,3,1045,4.5212765957446805

7929990,4,B000053V4F,"If you like B-movies from the era, you'll like this one. Very tame by today's standards, hence some of the poor reviews. I can watch scream queen Hazel Court in anything.",1460073600,,170,4.516129032258065
7929991,5,B000053V4F,"First of all if you're not familiar with Amazon's review policy, they don't differentiate between different releases of a movie. So if it gets released on DVD in 1989, then a different version in 1998, then a Blu-ray in 2011, all three have their reviews mixed together. The user is left to sort it out.

Even worse, on rarer occasions like this one, there are 5 movies named ""Ghost Ship"" listed on Amazon. Because of this their reviews have gotten all mixed up. So the reviews for the movie I'm actually reviewing here are mixed together with 2 other movies for certain, and possibly more.

However, in this case that was actually a good thing for me. You see, I came here looking for the Julie Margulies version but then I saw the review for this 1992 movie that some reviewers have compared to The Goonies. Same idea, different approaches in my opinion. Still, I ordered it based on the actual description and I was lucky enough to discover a new favorite movie.

This version of the title is about two men who arrive in a small town to ready themselves for a desert treasure hunt. Then through a confusing mix up at a 1-hr Photo type place (remember those?) a bunch of High School kids end up with the treasure map. But is it real? These same kids just happen to be going on a weeklong school sponsored field trip for their science class. Their teacher is just the guy for the job too as it turns out when things in the desert go south quickly and he becomes Mr. Nature Survivalist Superguy!

I won't go any further, but theres adventure, drama, and some great comedy all mixed in. Watch and find out what happens. I personally found it light hearted fun and very entertaining. You definitely don't have to overwork your brain on this one, just sit back with some popcorn and a soda, or a beer, and enjoy!

The cast is amazing but especially the high school kids. Most are first/one timers who did this movie then moved on with their lives. Still, they all act together pretty seamlessly and make it better than it might have been with lesser actors. They all actually seem like real friends. Maybe they were?

So yes, I gave it a 5 stars rating because I already watched it twice in less than a week and now I want to see it again, and then again. That's what qualifies as 5 stars for me anyway. Come on, the price is really cheap so give it a shot and enjoy!",1431129600,2,2364,4.385844748858448
7929992,3,B000053V4F,"OK little un-scary ghost story.  A young couple buy a boat with a history of being haunted.  A pair of illicit lovers were murdered onboard and their spirits are still sticking around waiting for justice.  Our couple have to deal with this sticky wicket.  Plays more like a veddy British domestic drama rather than a spooky horror film.  OK for completists.  The quality of the DVD is excellent, though.",1424563200,,403,4.768115942028985

7929994,1,B000053V4F,About as sorry as they come. Bad plot and very poor acting. The action is dull and what you would expect  from todays B type movies. A lot of stuff you don't want to see or hear. It went in the trash.,1415318400,,200,3.761904761904762
7929995,5,B000053V4F,But they refunded my money and didn't even ask for one. Got a working copy by running DVDFab Decrypter on it for 20 hours to slowly read through all the errors until it decyphered most of them out and then burned a DVD that worked with only a few dropped scenes.,1380758400,,262,4.1568627450980395
7929996,3,B000053V4F,"I was looking for an old movie where the boat/ship in question is found abandoned at sea and the is a mist or fog and there are people covered in a type of seaweed looking moss that haunt the ship however this was not it, but this the one however not a bad movie for an oldie.",1293926400,,276,3.8596491228070176
7929997,5,B000053V4F,"This is by far the best print out there for this movie, if your a fan, and had only the old crappy prints, this is the one you want.
This is the orginal theatre print, not a T.V. print.",1293321600,2,185,3.769230769230769
7929998,2,B000053V4F,"Hazel Court and Dermot Walsh star as a couple who buy a ship to live on - it turns out that it is haunted ..or is it ? I won't spoiler the ending, but it is really dull throughout the movie. A little too talky and a little too many 'comical' scenes for a ghost movie. It really lacked a strong horror presence if that is what the movie was intended to be
The transfer is really fantastic, but a great transfer doesn't make a great film. It can only be a clear picture while you are watching this slow paced lackluster movie.
See Ghost Ship by Val Lewton instead...",1240617600,3,564,4.136363636363637
