I was a Seawolf, and I can say it is the only video documentary produced professionally of our squadron that I know of. The only problem is it's not available in DVD format! Starting and stopping the VHS doesn't do the tape good.
You have many Seawolves waiting for a DVD format!",1264550400,,296,4.5
7793722,2,096396982X,"Great documentary on the only U.S. Navy combat helicopter squadron in Vietnam. Superb footage, interesting interviews & snappy music, what more could you ask for? How about no ""TULLY ENTERTAINMENT"" watermark, emblazoned on the lower right side of the screen, throughout the entire program. The size of this ""banner"" is large enough to distract the viewer. TULLY, how about taking a look at some of the NBC, BBC or National Geographic documentaries to see how it should be done.",979430400,,477,5.050632911392405
