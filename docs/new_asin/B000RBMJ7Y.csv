8378785,2,B000RBMJ7Y,"Check carefully when looking at these listings. If the product originates from an outfit by the name of [...], you can expect to get average to poor copies of the show. They will NOT be the high quality you might expect from an Amazon DVD purchase. The discs are copies of German-issued DVDs and with slightly redesigned cases. (My guess is that's why they are not corralled for copyright infringement.) The cover inserts and disc labels are printed off a regular inkjet or color copier and though they are shrink-wrapped and labeled as having a security device enclosed, they are not what you would consider to be ""store bought."" Before you spend $50 on this, check around and decide if you really want these.",1246579200,6,710,4.733870967741935
