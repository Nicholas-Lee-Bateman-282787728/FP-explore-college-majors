8147700,5,B000IY04P4,This DVD FEATURES THE ORIGINAL STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE FROM THE 80'S.  THE STORY IS FUN AND REMINDS ME OF MY CHILDHOOD.  STRAWBERRY IS ADORABLE WITH HER LITTLE CAT CUSTARD.  The DVD ALSO FEATURES ANOTHER STORY CALLED SPIDER'S WEB A PIG'S TALE.,1390608000,,240,4.95
8147701,1,B000IY04P4,A rip off of Charlotte's Web and a very ridiculous one at that. The movie is made by a studio called Spark Plug famous for crapping out rip offs of Disney and Dreamworks. They make that Brazilian Animation Studio video Brinquedo look respectable. Their animation is cheap and the artwork is very generic. Their voice actors are untalented nobodies. They can't afford Dan Green or Lisa Ortiz. The movie itself is nothing special it has a plot of its own if you can call it a plot. The moral of the story is poorly implemented. In short watch it for free if you can and don't waste your time or money.,1390176000,2,599,4.405405405405405
8147702,1,B000IY04P4,"What the?!! This is a rip off of charlottes web!!! whats with all these stupid rip offs!?!?!?! I HATE this!!! I want to kill the people who made this awfulness!!!

8147703,5,B000IY04P4,"As far as ""so bad it's good"" goes, Spider's Web is the cream of the crap.  It's supposed to be a knock off of Charlotte's Web, but it gets sidetracked.  For starters, there are shrimp cops who ride on motorcycles and shoot rockets.  They come to kill you if you leave a gas station without paying.  There's also a game show where contestants get spanked by a living paddle with an evil face.  If you're still worried about showing this to your kids, remember the important morals, like how it's wrong to lie if you're on a game show for some reason.",1297209600,7,549,4.3431372549019605
8147704,1,B000IY04P4,"Thinks to youtube I didn't have to spend a single cent on this. Another cheapa** ripoff of a good movie. Another movie yanked out of Sparkplug entertainments a**. Can you guess by name what it rips off? Heres a hint it involves the relationshp ship between a friendly pig and lovable spider and ended in every child and adult crying theier hearts out. The difference is that this crap here isn't heartfelt, looks like s***, makes no sense, stereotypes everywhere, I could go on. You have to be on acid to love this movie. You have alians, walking tvs, books eating zombie cats, a game where snakes get spanked, a french bee, silverfish police on motorcycles! I don't have to say more for you to know what to do if you see this movie anywhere.",1283990400,6,742,4.503703703703704
