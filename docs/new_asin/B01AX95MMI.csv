7613856,4,B01AX95MMI,"I will only talk about the second half of this show briefly; if you want a full-fledged analysis, hop on over to the first collection and see what I have to say there. Anyways, I call this show a ""Pop of the Year"" because it was one of THE big anime to hit television...in the year it was made. It made waves, and then the fuss died down a little. This is quite different from classics like Death Note and Code Geass, where the obsession continues, and more along the lines of Kill la Kill and Steins;Gate; there was hype, the show enticed many more than just fans of the source material, and the love subsided when the show was over. One can always ask why it didn't last as long in everyone's hearts, because Akame ga Kill definitely had the potential, but here's where it falls flat:
Any attempts at creating deep emotional connections turn out tremendous flops
Unfortunately, in a world where everyone is a killer and there are so many characters to dissipate our attention and the ACTION is the focal point of the whole series, we are left with a mere thrill ride. It is beautiful and engaging, but it lasts a mere 24 episodes; this is not long enough to develop characters when all they do is fight. Not only that, Akame ga Kill does not take itself seriously. The two classics I named, as well as the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood work so well because they take everything about themselves seriously, and therefore the emotional portions are taken seriously by the audience. There are jokes, no doubt, but the underlying tone is one of realism, and therefore goofy moments are meant to lighten the mood, not set the tone. Akame ga Kill does not do this, the same way Kill la Kill does not. However, Kill la Kill was meant to be goofy, while the former ends up seeming so despite its best efforts. And where does that happen? Mostly in the second half. You see, this part 2 collection is what divides everyone with this show, and where they try to make us feel for the unfolding events without giving them time to unfold. Confusing deaths? Check. An unexplored love? Check. A battle where we do not really care who lives or dies because both characters are cool, but we are not emotionally drawn in by their exploits? Check. Akame ga Kill was very disappointing because it could have been more than it was. Some people throw this phrase around, but it really is sad to think of how different it could have been if this was character driven instead of action driven, and had a bit more seriousness to the premise. It's a good show if you enjoy bloody action, magic powers, and your typical anime shenanigans, and I highly recommend it, but it is most likely not something that will leave you with a hole in your heart, inspire you to do something great, or push you to ponder everything you know about the world. You'll like it while you watch it, but then you'll easily move on with a dry mouth thirsty for better. Take my word as you see fit.",1455062400,8,2988,4.4743589743589745
7613857,5,B01AX95MMI,"Such a good serious series. A bit dark at times but also has some moments that are funny or heart warming to lighten the mood.

I love anime have since 1963 I don't care how old you are in Japan they watch well into there 80's america is just now catch on to the greatest form of entertainment of our live time Akame Ga Kill fits into my top 5 of the best anime of 2016 and maybe my top 20 over all the box set has a hard cover book for part one and part two the red and the black both kick ass and are sure to be worth a fortune just like sword art online's limited edition box sets. look I am not saying that you have to buy the top of the line box set but you figure the figurine's run over $ 250.00 bucks this will probable be worth more than anything else that Sentia Film works puts out they have not put a lot of these types of box set well lets see no game no life, beyond the boundry, Love Chunibyo & other Delusions, knights of Sidona and one other I belive about a parasite I think .

Akame ga Kill anime takes a different yet similar route that like its manga predecessor crushes the standard anime/manga with its violent plot twists, explosive fight scenes and romantic entanglement (in a good way)!

8748775,4,B01AX95MMI,"(Spoiler Free)

It's enjoyable, people tend to dislike it due to the ending and how slow it starts (in comparison to how quickly it ends).

I watched this anime as it aired in Japan a few years back and I loved it. It has its faults but every anime does to be fair. This is one of the better anime's out there and since it is people hold it to a higher standard.

I just finished re-watching it and enjoyed it even more this time then I had the first. I've always considered this more of a tragedy anime. It likes to build it's world narrative and it does that in the form of visuals more then speech.

You tend to side with a lot of characters in this anime and not all are likeable. It comes down to the lesser of two evils really. Yes the main side is considered the good side but they all have a back story with very questionable pasts their motives are ""pure"" but for the most part it's not hard to imagine them being on the other side if one or two events from their past never happened.

War is not a white and black picture. There is a very long transition to grey in between. There is pure characters and evil characters everyone else falls in between. Can you repent for evils of the past with selfless acts in the present?

That's your choice to decide.

On a scale 1-5 (1 being horrible and 5 being flawless) I would rate this a 4. Some arguable flaws but still above average.",1500163200,,1388,4.156716417910448
