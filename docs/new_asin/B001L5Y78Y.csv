8317387,4,B001L5Y78Y,"I ordered this DVD only for the film An Angel for Satan.  In a turn-of-the-century Italian village a statue is recovered from a lake and is restored.  Then bad vibes or an evil disembodied entity starts to take over the body and soul of the returning lady of the manor.  She starts to vamp and corrupt local citizens and servants.  No monsters or ghosts, but more of a mind horror film.  The film is in its original Italian with English sub-titles.  The black-and-white photography is beautiful.  The DVD transfer is excellent.  Highly unlikely that you will find a better version anywhere else.  The transfer for The Long Hair of Death is adequate but if one wants an excellent DVD transfer of that get the Rare Video USA DVD release.  Highly recommended for An Angel for Satan.",1459641600,,779,4.661764705882353
8317388,5,B001L5Y78Y,"Here we have a new Company, Midnight Choir, marking an incredible debut in the Euro Horror department, releasing 2 impressive packages:  Bava's 'The Whip and the Body and Fulci's 'Conspiracy of Torture' (Beatrice Cenci)and this powerful double feature. Both of these films have been released in the past with horribly, shoddy transfers and 'Angel for Satan' was only available in Italian with no English Subtitles.  Both films have been presented here in their best transfers to date.  The best of the two is Margheretti's 'LONG HAIR' which is a nightmare of revenge and passion involving Barbara Steele and George Ardisson, it's beautiful photography finally getting its due. But the real surprise is Mastrocinque's 'ANGEL FOR SATAN' presented with appropriate english subtitles and enhancing the film.  My Italian is a bit rusty so watching the film without them is a grueling experience. The widescreen images looked great on my high def television and the sound is crystal clear.  For fans of Italian Horror and seeing Steele licking her acting chops, this double bill is highly recommended and deserves a place next to the best of Bava or Riccardo Freda. Lets hope that Midnight Choir continues with future releases of other Euro Horror titles that have eluded our grasp.",1275782400,5,1276,5.144927536231884
8317389,4,B001L5Y78Y,"An Angel For Satan.  1966  Italian Spoken with English Subtitles.
It is one of the last and most interesting Italian horror productions featuring the alluring Barbara Steele under the direction of Camillo Mastrocinque.  The statue found in the lake was restored to its originality by Sculpture Roberto (Anthony Steffen).  Steele begins to take on the psychotic traits of the woman upon whom the sculpture was modelled.  She was known by the towns people as much-feared sorceress of a local legend.
Curious fans of the sultry horror star will find much to enjoy, even that the film is Italian spoken. - Barbara's Steele's (beautiful Queen of Horror) performance was the strong as visuals propel the story with the minimal of dialogue.
The film is exciting with the right doses of horror, not so strong by today's standards but still frightening and tense.  It is about GREED.  The Mayors of Counts who control the territories, backed by the church, keep the townspeople under constant tension and fright by blaming a woman of a murder committed by somebody else.  They call her a sorcerer, a witch and the degrading the innocent woman by burning her at the stake.
The Black and White transfer of An Angel for Satan is perfect.  Photography is of high standard.

The DVD is a double feature with another Barbara Steele 1964 film `The Long Hair of Death'; Directed by Antonio Margheriti.  This film is English Spoken.
The story line, is about the Sheriff or Count who controls his territory.  These stories were set in the 15th century Italy. It is again about Greed and what is interesting is about the return from death of the mother of young Elizabeth who at a very tender age watched her mother burned at the stake for a murder she did not commit.  A very strong story, beautifully directed, moving from one chapter into another.  Barbara Steele was great in her part as was Kurt, played by Giorgio Ardisson.  Lizabeth was played by Halina Zalewska.  Sin never sleeps.

Unfortunately the transfer of this Black and White photographed film was rather disappointing.
Story wise they both carry a strong plot and although I'm not a horror buff, I loved them both.
The films (Standard DVD) were projected on a 3 meter screen, up-scaled to 1080p by DVD `O' equipment.",1243382400,18,2263,4.821243523316062
8317390,5,B001L5Y78Y,"Both THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH (one of my favorites) & AN ANGEL FOR SATAN (very rare & first time on DVD in the US) have now been released as a double feature. An Angel For Satan (Barbara Steele's last Italian horror film) was never released in the US, but at least we have English subtitles. The film seems more of a supernatural thriller than a horror outing. These films do not appear to have been remastered, but the original sources are much better than expected. The quality of An Angel For Satan is very good-- nice clear picture. The Long Hair Of Death is far better than any other versions out there so far. I was very pleased with this double feature--some perfectionists may not be.
Good news-- THE SHE BEAST and NIGHTMARE CASTLE are being remastered and released soon. Now lets get TERROR CREATURES, THE GHOST and HORRIBLE DR. HICHCOCK properly restored.",1234915200,46,863,4.6103896103896105
