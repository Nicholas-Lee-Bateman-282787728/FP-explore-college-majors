8061929,5,B0009JI2G6,"The common denominator in this pair of episodes from ""The Road to Avonlea"" television series is the character of Jasper Dale (R.H. Thomson), the inventive recluse of the town who makes friends with Sara Stanley (Sarah Polley) and eventually marries Olivia King (Mag Ruffman). Sara is the pivotal character in the series, which was adapted to various degrees by the Lucy Maud Montgomery novels ""The Story Girl"" and ""The Golden Road,"" along with her short story collections ""Chronicles of Avonlea"" and ""Further Chronicles of Avonlea."" All I can say is that I ordered the Disney Channel just to watch this series.

""The Story Girl Earns Her Name"" (Episode 2, Written by Heather Conkie, First aired January 14, 1990) is where Sara, who has been sent to live with her King relatives following her mother's depth and her father's indictment for financial crimes he did not commit, becomes a part of the Avonlea community. The town had sold tickets to a magic lantern show to help raise money for new books for the Avonlea school library, but it turns out Mr. Beatty is a con man who runs away with the money. Even worse, Sara makes the mistake of helping him get away. Feeling guilty Sara will not stop until she has redeemed herself and helped raise the money. When she happens to stumble upon Jasper Dale, known as the ""Awkward Man,"" taking photographs in a meadow, she comes up with grand plans for her own magic lantern show. However, there are those who still think that Sara Stanley is putting on airs and needs to be taken down a peg.

Unlike Montgomery's novels ""The Story Girl"" and ""The Golden Road,"" the Sara Stanley of these stories is not a welcomed cousin who visits Prince Edward Island each summer. This Sara is trying to find her place in Avonlea, with both her King family relatives and the locals, who certainly do not consider the young visitor from Montreal to be a true Islander. However, it is not because this is the episode in which ""The Story Girl Earns Her Name,"" that this becomes a memorable story, and not just because this Sara does not tell as many stories as her literary counterpart. The minor character of Jasper Dale turns out to become more important as we travel along the road to Avonlea and it is quite interesting to see that the only one who has a kind word for the stuttering recluse besides Sara is her Aunt Olivia. As we see in the next episode on this tape, this pays off down the road.

""Dreamer of Dreams"" (Episode 23, Written by Heather Conkie, First aired February 3, 1991) finds school teacher Hetty King (Jackie Burroughs) biting her tongue with regards to the engagement between her sister Olivia and Jasper Dale. However, that does not stop the rest of Avonlea has nothing to say about the match. Unfortunately Jasper overhears what the town's old hens have to say about the matter and becomes convinced he is not good enough for the woman he loves. Consequently, he wants to call off the wedding.. Meanwhile, Olivia is placed in charge of the Avonlea ""Chronicle"" while Sara and Felicity (Gema Zamprogna ) are working on their own journalistic endeavor. This is one of those stories were two wrongs make a right, because when Sara and Felicity's advice column ends up on the front page of the ""Chronicle"" a lot of things are brought out into the open.

The title ""Dreamer of Dreams"" is one with multiple meanings, because why it appears to have to do with Jasper Dale's preoccupation with inventions, such as a bicycle built for two and a flying machine, that is not the most important of Jasper's dreams. Besides, it is one very similar to the dream most dear to Olivia's heart as well. You will notice that both of these episodes were written by Heather Conkie, whose work on the series evidenced not only an ability to skillfully adapt Lucy Maud Montgomery's work but also to come up with solid original stories involving the characters. It seems almost every time I am impressed by one of these episodes, more often than not Conkie was the writer.",1135641600,,3998,4.666666666666667
