7951895,3,B00005R1MY,"Okay, this is a little amateurish and slow, but where else can you see gorgeous Deborah Harry circa 1976; filmed before Blondie's first album was even in stores? Unfortunately, she's not the star of the film, and director Amos poe doesn't give her much to do in her one scene where she has 6 or 7 lines of dialogue before launching into an a capella number called ""Sweet Thing"". Then she's gone, and you press STOP on your DVD player! I can't say the rest of the movie is bad because I never get past Debbie!  Amos also made three other films at around the same time, THE FOREIGNER (also with Debbie in a small singing cameo), BLANK GENERATION (documenting 1976-era CBGBs also including a section on Blondie), and NITE LUNCH, another docu-style account of the early scene circa 1975 with short clip of the Blondies. I recommend all of them for Blondie collectors and affecianados of the NYC punk era.",1035331200,18,900,4.590062111801243
7951896,1,B00005R1MY,"I will admit I bought this mainly for the appearance of Debbie Harry, but, believe me, unless you are a completist it's not worth it!  This black and white (ultra)low budget art film is badly recorded, the script and acting are terrible, and the ponderous direction makes the film crawl at a pace that would bore a snail.
Absolutely dire.  If you want an interesting film from the punk generation go for Jubilee instead.",1021420800,11,420,4.662162162162162
