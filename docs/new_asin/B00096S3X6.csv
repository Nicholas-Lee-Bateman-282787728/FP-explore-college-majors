I was not disappointed and actually was pleasantly surprised that I received so much information for such a low price! I consider this a mostly undiscovered gem of stories. Luckily for me I discovered this box set!",1179446400,,373,4.3428571428571425
8057634,5,B00096S3X6,This is a great set of DVDs. I am a World War II buff and author. These DVDs are among the best that I have found. They include much material that you would expect (and have seen before) as well as uncommon and interesting scenes. Having these DVDs made me learn how to use the player on my computer. I watch some of the scenes often.,1153180800,,334,4.075757575757576
