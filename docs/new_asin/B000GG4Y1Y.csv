it will offend...which is great...nobody does that anymore...

and we need some offending...check out Mathematics..the horse apples episode..

I wish some days there was a blu-ray version, but in hindsight the quality really isn't that bad. I highly recommend getting this if you want a physical copy of this amazing, well done, gory, satire. Though remember, you're only paying for the packaging, the episodes of Wonder Showzen are free to watch legally on MTV's website.

2608615,5,B000GG4Y1Y,"i saw this show as a kid (unfortunately) and it has been my favorite show so far. They push the boundaries with a lot of obscene content, everything offensive that you can think of is on this show and it's hilarious. Some parts have me crying in laughter, if you ever get this season, look for the Dusty the Talking Dog bit, that's my favorite out of the whole second season

They made beat kids a whole episode and clarence a whole episode and horse apples a whole episode instead of having a little bit of everything in one episode.  I got tired, upset and disappointed because it wasn't even funny it was too monotinise.  Season 2 is the reason why they don't have a season 3.

If you find any of the previously mentioned things funny in the right context then this show is DEFINITELY for you. The show mixes elements of Sesame Street, the Muppet Show and other kids based learning shows and mixes them with crude and often times insane adult humor.

2608627,5,B000GG4Y1Y,"Wonder Showzen is not something you watch with family, maybe not even with friends. This show is one of the few things I have ever seen that may be just as messed-up as I am. The humor is there, and there are some serious ""stark truths"" that may be ""soul-crushing to the weak of spirit."" So, as long as you have the stomach for something that sort of makes you mind feel like hot mush from start to finish, it is DEFINITELY a show worth watching.",1387756800,,446,4.1976744186046515

the writing is bad, the things the kids say is terrible and the puppets are sick... but you can't look away. this is worse than south park's nastiness, it was a wonder that it hasn't been canceled after the first minute it aired, but it is a good show for the people who don't know better, and i guess that's me",1209168000,2,336,4.106060606060606
2608651,5,B000GG4Y1Y,"If you watched 3 minutes of any one show you might think this is the worst show on TV. It takes a little longer to appreciate the complexity of the underlying ideas the show brings.

The creators are smart, the kids are fantastic (gotta love Trevor and Beat Kids), and the subjects are relevant. I think they must have been shocked when they were green lit for a second season. They played this one like they knew there was no way they would be asked for a third.

Tackling issues like our constitution and the subversion of it, education, gun control, war, freedom of speech, slavery, racism, the meat market, TV and the common American idiot. They present these ideas for the MTV generation. A person can easily understand (and laugh), but are left with the overall message the story's portray, obviously or subconsciously.

2608653,4,B000GG4Y1Y,"Excellent concluding season, though a bit more avant garde than the first season, sometimes to the point of absolutely absurdity, but it is at least fun to watch even if you aren't laughing guiltily.

2608654,4,B000GG4Y1Y,"The first several episodes of Wonder Showzen Vol. 2 could easily rival the first season of Wonder Showzen. On the other had, there are a couple of very weak episodes on disc two, especially the last episode which is nothing but a giant Clarance skit which turns out to be mostly white noise and is certainly not entertaining for 30 minutes. All in all, it's really good and I would suggest it to anyone who liked Wonder Showzen Vol. 1.",1194998400,,435,4.45

2608656,4,B000GG4Y1Y,"Wonder Showzen continues in its usual demented and hilarious way in the second season. The first disk is the better of the two because it has more episodes on it. Body, Time, Science, Knowledge, and Justice are the episodes on disc 1. Disc 2 contains Cooperation, Mathematics, and The Clarence special report on compelling television plus the special features. Mathematics is probably my favorite because it is the horse apples episode.",1188691200,,436,5.154929577464789

2608689,5,B000GG4Y1Y,"Not quite as nasty as the 1st season disc, but the 2nd season still makes the most offensive of South Park look like pablum. The show's creators were reportedly trying to get this thing cancelled off MTV2, so later episodes may try your patience a little. The bonuses are a bit weak compared to the 1st season set. Any chance any other network will give us a 3rd season?",1170806400,5,370,4.3768115942028984
2608690,5,B000GG4Y1Y,"You're hard-pressed to find genuine avant-garde on television, but this definitely counts. Wonder Showzen has made me laugh harder than anything in my entire life, except perhaps George Carlin.

A few of the episodes in Season 2 have very low re-play value, and are almost as annoying as they are inventive, but even they are worth watching once. The rest, however, are keepers through and through. (And the same could be said for Season 1, too, actually.)

(Also: one of the reviewers compared the Clarence's ""word on the street"" routines with Tom Greene and some other flavor-of-the-month's ""word on the street"" bits, but this is not a very apt comparison, for reasons that will quickly become clear after watching them.)",1168819200,10,723,5.016666666666667
2608691,5,B000GG4Y1Y,"And brilliant - quite possibly one of the most subversive shows on TV. It's a shame that MTV2 doesn't seem to have ordered a third season, I'd definitely watch more of this.",1168473600,7,173,4.4375

2608694,3,B000GG4Y1Y,"It only took one clip on youtube to spark my interest in this show, and after  getting season 1 i had no thoughts of not buying season 2.

Season 2 is more offensive, more shocking, more outrages and even made someone like me ask ""did they really just say that on tv?"" hell some of the stuff they say I don't think even i'd say in private conversation.

It's much of the same as the previous season, only the shock value has been tuned up. There are things I didn't like about the show, but then theres other that had me rolling on the floor with laughter.

It's like a stoned mans version of Seseme street with main charactor puppets but on an adult only wave length.

It's not something your grandparents would find amusing at all, it's probably P.O the religious communitys 100 times, and makes Borat look like an amatuer when there on fire.

If you can stand a good laugh that is more offensive then South Park & Family Guy put together then you should check this out.

season two also has a couple of episodes where the main theme is taken away and it becomes a hillbilly redneck show called Horse Apples. those where ok, but i think they where struggling for ideas when they had an entire episode of the blue interview puppet on the streets. That epsisode and another where it was purposley made to annoy you don't have any replay value for me.

the second disc is like a board game with 4 episodes and the bonus features, the extras i cant say are memorable.

Either way, it's still a funny show, and I cant think of what couldve made it better, but i will be looking for season 3 if there is one.",1166745600,4,1604,4.3023255813953485
2608695,5,B000GG4Y1Y,"If you thought Season One was funny in that cruel and sadistic sort of way, Season Two is brought back and this time NOTHING is still sacred.  It is still the same dark, twisted humor you get,....PLUS HEE HAW!!!!  Yes...there is the inclusion of various Hee Haw rip-offs that just makes it even more fun to watch while in your straight jacket and being offered medication.  So if you were a fan of the first set....get the second set.",1161129600,2,434,4.468354430379747
2608696,5,B000GG4Y1Y,"Wonder Showzen is a cult hit, and if you're reading this review, there's a good chance that you're part of the cult. I'm not quite sure how to write a review that would do this DVD justice, but I will say that this show is awesome and I like this season even more than the first one. The writing is sharper, the humor is more demented, and the kids are (for lack of a better phrase) in the zone.

If you happened to catch the tail end of a Wonder Showzen episode or have only seen one or two episodes and are on the fence about buying this DVD - do yourself a a favor and buy it; actually, the power of Christ compels you to buy it. Although there are only 7 episodes, each one is hilarious and they'll have you rolling on the floor for weeks.

For those looking for some sort of comparison, I guess I would say the closest thing is TV Funhouse. However, Wonder Showzen is to TV Funhouse what Sin City is to the Care Bears.",1160956800,11,923,4.065934065934066
