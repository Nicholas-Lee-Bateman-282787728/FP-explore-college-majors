3565210,4,B001F76OLG,I did enjoy this movie.  You have to think of yourself in make believe.  It is heart warming movie.  Only think I didn't like at the very end it stopped and I couldn't get it play again.,1260230400,2,186,3.972972972972973
3565211,2,B001F76OLG,"Admittedly, I'm not a member of the target audience for this movie. Nonetheless, I did see it recently and had a few thoughts. The premise behind the movie - that a guy meets a princess who turns out to be a magical guardian of fairy-tale animals - is cute and has potential. However, it ultimately falls short. It seemed too quick (and indeed runs less than an hour and a half) and never took full advantage of the fairy-tale creatures at its disposal. There were no magical moments with unicorns (although there was one with a fairy baby). The movie could have been extended by half an hour or so in order to play up the fairy-tale aspect. Right now, it's too similar to any other ABC love story.

Another concern is the appropriateness for kids. Some reviewers have noted one of the characters uses words like gay, lesbian, and virginal. While those certainly aren't appropriate for a kids movie, I was more disturbed by the portrayal of marriage. The main character's best friend seems to constantly complain about his marriage and the responsibility of having a baby. Fortunately, at the end of the movie he seems to have forgotten about his problems, but it was still unnecessary and doesn't portray marriage well.",1251763200,13,1220,4.727699530516432

Adorable movie. Received DVD in excellent condition & on time.  This is a movie everyone should see. You will enjoy seeing it over and over again.  Great bargain for a used DVD.",1246665600,2,349,7.923076923076923
3565213,3,B001F76OLG,"As a mother of 4, with 3 girls under 10, I thought this would be a cute movie to watch together.  I previewed it with my ten year old and was disappointed that the words ""gay"" ""lesbian"" and ""virginal princess"" were used by the ""30 something"" father - to - be in the movie, when trying to set up his friend with the princess. The words were used quickly and I'm sure younger children wouldn't pick up those words, but unfortunately my 10 year old did.  I was disappointed that abc family included them in their movie.  They weren't necessary and wouldn't have changed the storyline at all.  I also didn't see a rating on this movie but I would certainly slap on a PG maybe even PG-13 label, for the few inappropriate words used and a few scary parts with a 5 headed ""Loch Ness"" type creature.  Again, parents you preview it first and decide for yourself.  Aside from those disappointments, the movie was okay.",1236470400,32,908,4.4397590361445785
3565214,4,B001F76OLG,"This movie was actually pretty cute.  My girls, 7, 6 and 4, all enjoyed this movie.  We rented it and now I think we will need to add it to our library.  I must admit that I liked it, too.  It's a different storyline.  If you have young girls that are interested in fairytales, this would be a great buy.",1235865600,10,304,4.0
3565215,4,B001F76OLG,My 11 & 9 year old daughters loved this movie!  We stumbled upon it one night on TV now we must add it to our DVD collection.  The girls loved the dresses. The story is very cute.,1234828800,6,179,3.810810810810811
3565246,5,B001F76OLG,"Such a beautiful movie. Unlike any other fairy princess movie I ever seen. Your children will love it. This is a magical movie that shows mythological creatures, fairies, a princess coming of age, beauty and the beast. A tiny fairy gives birth to baby fairy , flying creatures.  There is so much magic in this movie and the beautiful gowns the princess wears leave you breathless .  The plot is  a princess that never leaves the castle because she is in charge of the mythological world.  All creatures obey her the next princess coming of age has to be in the castle to receive her powers or all mythological creatures will die.  Time is running out and the princess hosts a ball to get funds to search for the new princess.  A handsome gentleman goes to the ball and bids his entire savings but, adds to the deal he will bid. 50 thousand as long as he and the princess have a date outside if the castle.  She accepts and the journey begins.  I don't want to spoil it for you trust that if you love fairies and Disney magic you will love this family movie.

P.s. Disregard the negative comments those who comment negatively are those who stopped believing in magic.  This keeps your little ones believing.  My 9 year old loves watching this movie. I think you will love it as much as we do.  I also recommend Aquamarine for a little more magical adventure.  :)",1409443200,2,1361,4.439516129032258
3565247,5,B001F76OLG,A great monden fairytale with a twist :-) makes you use your imagination and inspires you to dream and think what if!,1395014400,3,117,4.363636363636363
3565248,4,B001F76OLG,I enjoy watching wholesome fairy tales and this was right up my alley. A good movie for females of all ages.,1394064000,,108,4.190476190476191
3565249,5,B001F76OLG,"Sweetest, beautifulest looking young lady, and a great actress.
Great movie for the kids, AND ME TOO.
Had my neighbor kids over to view, and they loved it.",1391299200,2,155,4.571428571428571
3565250,5,B001F76OLG,Its been awhile since I watched this but my nieces love this movie and I had to own due to that they are over alot.,1388793600,2,115,3.64
3565251,3,B001F76OLG,"If you are looking for a princess story with some mild horror elements then this might interest you. I personally didn't find it that scary and thought most of the story was rather sweet. I however would not show this movie to kids as there is a very scary monster. The basic story is that a princess lives in a castle where she heals hurt mythological creatures. There is a mermaid, a miniature dragon, a fairy who has a baby and what looks like a werewolf.

No one is normally allowed in the castle so the whole situation is steeped in mystery. The problem is that the princess is about to turn 25 at which time she will lose her powers. A new princess has to be found immediately. So the story has some suspense elements in it.

It is probably no spoiler to tell you that the prince ends up with the princess. However I was disappointed that there was no wedding at the end. It seemed the prince just went to live in the castle without marrying the princess. I think this sends the wrong message to kids. So as an adult I could enjoy most of the movie but the ending was a little disappointing.

The highlight of the movie is when the fairy baby flies. That was so cute.

3565252,1,B001F76OLG,"I especially loved the part when one character says, ""you and the virgin princess made the front page again""...I loved it when my 8 year old asked what that meant...watching men treat women like dogs, using pick-up lines to blatantly use a girl, the making fun of gay people part...and the drinking.  I say yes to all and the sooner..the better! Such a great movie for kids because we want them to know drinking is great...making fun of gay people is ok!  And virginity...well lose it as fast as you can because you deserve to made fun of if you wait!  Sarcasm Intended!!!!

Seriously, anyone who defends this movie, says it is appropriate for young kids, and then says other are too over protective is delusional.",1371254400,3,714,4.642857142857143
3565253,5,B001F76OLG,"I don't know what century half of these people are from but welcome to the 21st century.  Seriously?  Inappropriate for kids?  Well what age are they?  If they are 5 and under maybe.  This is targeted more towards slightly older children I believe.  My 8 and 9 year old GIRL cousins watched this movie and enjoyed it.  There was no crying over the ""scary"" monsters.  Maybe if parents weren't so overprotective all of the time they wouldn't be upset.  As for the use of ""inappropriate"" words such as gay and whatever, once again, it is the 21st century.  It is supposed to be a MODERN tale and sorry to tell you this but this is modern.  Kids might as well find out now rather than later what the world is like.  Otherwise they will be so sheltered when they leave the house they will be target practice.  Geez people, honestly.  My little sister has been watching horror movies since she was 5 years old.  As a matter of fact, she loves them, and this is no where near ""scary"".  And talking about inappropriate, look at some other movies you let your kids watch, I am sure there are hidden messages everywhere.  Just look at shrek, it had a curse word in it, did that stop you?",1365206400,5,1177,4.375
3565254,4,B001F76OLG,"There is nothing scary about the characters.  Love story is cute.  Great family movie just for fun, possibly for boys as well.",1354492800,3,126,4.681818181818182
3565255,4,B001F76OLG,"This movie was a huge hit with the 4 kids I watched it with - two eight-year old girls and boy/girl six-year old twins. I also thought it was quite cute and well done, especially for a made-for-tv movie. The story revolves around a mysterious princess who lives in a castle in a regular, contemporary small town, and only comes out once a year for a ball to raise money to save endangered species. A friend visiting a friend and his wife in the town attends the ball, and falls for the princess. She mistakes him for someone called the searcher and he is pulled into her mysterious life saving mythical creatures. It has heart, moves briskly, and is decently done, especially for a tv movie. Overall, a hit for sleepovers and parties, especially for girls 6-10 or so.",1341705600,2,767,4.525179856115108
3565276,3,B001F76OLG,"The movie started decently. The actors are not big time celebrities but did a good job. The princess is pretty and charming. It even has an element of suspense and surprise that hook you up to watch past half of the movie.

For five to six year old kids, it can really be scary with some of the make-ups seem to belong more on a horror flick than a fairy tale movie. The special effects with all the mythological characters are cheap and very cheesy; they move like frame by frame Gumby-like clay motion. The story and the dialogue also deteriorate when all the creatures started to appear. One cute moment was when a baby fairy was born and was shown in the palm of the princess.",1341619200,,680,4.354330708661418
3565277,1,B001F76OLG,"Sat down to what I thought was going to be fun girl night with my 8 year old daughter.  First 20 minutes have two guys drinking beer, then they decide to go to a Princess Ball even after talking about how ""gay"" it would be.  Then they talk about someone being a lesbian.  We were about to turn it off but gave it a few more minutes and this horrible creature shows up at the end of the driveway that belongs in a horror movie.  My 8 year old is almost crying telling me to shut it off.  Really?  Why would this be marketed to kids?",1331683200,10,531,3.9622641509433962
3565278,1,B001F76OLG,I thought I was going to watch a cute little movie about a Princess.  I was shocked to see the scary elements of the mythological creatures.  There is no way I would allow my children to see this.  I agree with the other reviewers as well that the guy's friend is totally inappropriate in the wording he chooses to use.  He is not a role-model I would want for my boys of what a father should be.  Overall the love story was drowned out by all the inappropriateness of everything else.,1329696000,2,485,4.285714285714286
3565279,4,B001F76OLG,"Cute movie about a girl who helps/cures ""imaginary creatures"" that many people don't believe in who ultimately set out to look for her replacement but ends up not only doing that but also falling in love in the process with a guy who didn't know where his place is in the world.",1311033600,,278,4.365384615384615

3565281,5,B001F76OLG,If you expect just a cute fairytale story you will love and enjoy this movie.  Set in modern day with the whole atmosphere of fairytale.  Very enjoyable.

3565282,1,B001F76OLG,"This movie was completely inappropriate for kids and way too stupid for adults.  If it is for children, than they need to cut the adult ""humor"".",1296259200,3,144,4.538461538461538
3565283,5,B001F76OLG,My 4 year old daughter saw this movie on ABC Family and fell in love with it.  She loves the Park Birthday Party Scene.  There are some scary parts so I recommend watching the movie with little ones the first time its viewed.,1277337600,2,225,4.209302325581396
3565284,3,B001F76OLG,"I had no idea what this movie was about when I sat down to watch, but as it began to unfold I thought it had potential. For me it just never quite acheived it. The attempt to blend the here-and-now with happily-ever-after just didn't fit this time like I felt it had in Disney's ""Enchanted.""

I'm not sure who the target audience is supposed to be. Dialogue seemed more adult in places than necessary in a kid's movie. Some of the scary fairy tale creatures might be too much for some little ones (though most kids seem pretty jaded these days), but the princess theme is obviously geared to little girls. The immature attitude of Will's friend, Louis, toward fatherhood may have been trying to play to men, though I can't see many of them wanting to sit through this movie. In an attempt to please everyone, it pleased no one at my house.

The princess is very sweet and pretty, her ""knight in shining armor"" is a nice looking average guy. There are some entertaining moments--especially the fairy baby, but overall, for me, it fell short of being a charming modern-day fairy tale.",1272499200,4,1082,4.572164948453608

8301159,3,B001F76OLG,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2008 and directed by Mark Rosman, Princess: A Modern Fairytale is a family flick about an amicable down-on-his-luck Princeton graduate (Kip Pardue) who impulsively bids his last capital on a date with a reclusive princess of an odd local chateau (Nora Zehetner). As he falls for her innocent charms he discerns that something decidedly peculiar is going on.

The protagonist has the agreeable appeal of Richard Thomas (aka John Boy in The Waltons), albeit taller. But I found it odd how he just rolled with the weird lingo and other things while dating the princess, like the perpetual talk of some mysterious searcher. If you can get past that, this is a mildly enjoyable TV fantasy flick with some magic.

The noble manner in which William (Pardue) courts the princess is beautiful and heartwarming  the express opposite of picking up a dubious chick at some sleaze joint. Zehetner is certainly winsome, but doesnt do much for me personally, but there are worthy females on the periphery. The films decent, but limited by its TV budget and inferior to Prince Charming (2001).

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours & 28 minutes and was shot in Toronto. WRITER: Heidi Ferrer.
