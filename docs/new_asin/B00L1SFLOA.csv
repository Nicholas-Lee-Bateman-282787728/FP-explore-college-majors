8663113,3,B00L1SFLOA,"Between Palmer and Smith, they've forgotten more about beer since breakfast than I'll ever know, so I don't want this to sound like I'm denigrating their expertise or knowledge or anything like that--but I was somewhat disappointed by this video. This is a good first draft, but it is marred by some editing issues--there is no excuse for a presenter to flub a line and not re-take it--and what I as an absolute newb to the hobby perceive as a  glossing over of some crucial information. Between them, Palmer & Smith could no doubt make a superb DVD, and while this is a good launching point, I just don't think it's ready for prime time.

While there aren't a ton of stammers and stutters, they're there and they're distracting. To me, that would be unacceptable and I'm surprised that those were left in. Palmer and Smith are also like deer in headlights as presenters. While there's no doubt they know their stuff, their presentation of it was wooden. It got slightly better as the DVD went on and they loosened up, but they still looked like they were reading off of cue cards and trying to remember to look like they weren't reading off of cue cards.

I also feel as though the time spent on ""arty"" camera angles showing wort boiling would have been better spent going deeper into sanitization, covering common errors that first-timers make, that sort of thing. It felt like what is probably second nature to these guys--the absolute bare-bones basics of keeping things clean, sanitized, and contained--got the ""taken for granted"" treatment. I can think of several instances in the video where, had I not been reading about extract brewing for months and listening to podcasts and watching videos and trawling various and sundry sites for information, I would have been left scratching my head and wondering how they got from a to b.

I think this DVD is a fun companion piece to a good book (and Palmer's is better than good as far as I can tell!) but it needs work to be the one-stop-newb-shop. Frankly, the videos on Northern Brewer's site and the DVD they include with their kits are packed with more information and in some instances have higher production values than this DVD. I'm not expecting JJ Abrams or anything, but I know this could be done better. In the credits, Smith seems to have taken on a lot of the film-doing duties--maybe for version 2.0, some money could be found in the budget to hire an experienced, beer-loving, film-making type person who'd be willing to sell his directing/producing/editing expertise cheap for the sake of spreading the brewing gospel to the masses?",1446681600,,2601,4.747787610619469

8663115,4,B00L1SFLOA,"Both this video and How to Brew All Grain Beer have a great deal of easy to understand information. Not too much science, not that that worries me. Actually seeing the process is a great way to learn. Gave both a 4 because of the doubled up information at the end of each video. Could have something a bit different in each.",1418860800,,324,4.241935483870968
