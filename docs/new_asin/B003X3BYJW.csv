8407729,2,B003X3BYJW,"I am an advanced stepper and pride myself on picking up choreography quickly and do not like only the basic moves; however, I was not able to follow this workout. There really wasn't any cueing of the steps, timing was off and the steps really weren't broken down so you can understand what to do in case you didn't get it the first couple of times. If there was a better instructor this could be a pretty good video. I will keep this in my library of step videos because I love step and they really do not make them anymore but it is definitely not one of my favorites. If you're new to step this is not for you.",1510099200,,613,4.116666666666666

8407731,5,B003X3BYJW,"I like this workout, but it is the same as Steppin'In Rhythm with a different picture and workout outfit on the cover.  Should have checked before I ordered.  It's complex enough to keep your attention and time flies.  It's a relatively tough workout too.",1423094400,3,255,4.75
8407732,1,B003X3BYJW,Cueing was off the music what little direction there was.. I am an experienced stepper and would NOT recommend this for anyone... very hard to follow..very little modification,1406678400,,175,5.285714285714286
8407733,2,B003X3BYJW,"I am an intermediate stepper.  I found the steps interesting and different from other step workouts I've done, but the cueing is poor.  Best if you are familiar with step or dance terminology already, otherwise, it will take some repetitions of this video to get a really good workout.  I've done this workout twice but found I needed to pause frequently to get the moves (tire tracks, etc.) correct. There are better instructors and step workouts out there.",1376524800,,458,4.846153846153846
8407734,4,B003X3BYJW,"I like this DVD. It's not one of my favorites, but it keeps my heart rate up and it's fun. The workout consists of a warm-up, the 3 step blocks, and a cool-down/stretch. The warm-up is about 13 minutes long, which I think is a bit long for a warm-up. The music is niether intrusive nor does it really pump me up. Sometimes, the instructor forgets she's mirroring the people at home and she instructs you to step on the wrong lead leg, which can be frustrating. The cueing is adequate, but instructor also doesn't call out all the moves all of the time- it's not bad, but it's enough to confuse me a little. The moves are challenging, but not as difficult as Amy Bento's advance step challenge series. Some of the synchopated moves are high impact. I would recommend buying this DVD, I enjoy it. However, it lacks the ""wow"" factor that makes me rate it 5 stars. Don't buy this DVD if you're not an advanced stepper. The workout includes lots of spins and turns and a beginner would get really frustrated. As an aside, the outfits the instructor and her back-up dancers are wearing are horrendous. I find their outfits distracting because they're so ugly.",1300233600,3,1153,4.521531100478469
8407735,5,B003X3BYJW,Really liked this DVD and was just the right pace for me.  The dance moves are great and easy to learn and there are not a lot of good aerobics dvds out there.  I use this one as my staple a few times a week thanks.,1295913600,2,215,3.652173913043478
