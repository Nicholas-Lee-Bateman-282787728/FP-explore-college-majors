7787857,4,0006588204,This was a replacement for a video.  It was what I expected.  Some of us old (mature) ladies are still using these.,1494028800,,115,4.181818181818182
7787858,5,0006588204,Please bring this wonderful exercise workout to dvd.  This exercise workout is too wonderful to not bring to dvd.  Not many people still have vhs players that can even play these anymore.  I am sure that there would be a whole new audience for this if it would be brought to dvd.,1389830400,8,279,4.326923076923077
7787859,4,0006588204,I owned a copy of this tape in the late 1980s.  I loved the music then and still do.  I may be an exercise tape but I can exercise and praise at the same time.... makes it less of a chore.  I was pleased to find a used VHS copy on Amazon.,1388361600,,238,3.5384615384615383
7787860,5,0006588204,This has always been my favorite workout.  Easy to understand and it works the whole body into great shape!  Love it!  Bought the record back in the 90's and now I listen to it (and *do* it  :) )on cassette tape.,1374537600,,212,4.097560975609756
7787861,5,0006588204,"I lost 24 lbs in less than a year using this video. It's uplifting and I'm glad I don't have to see women that are half dressed. Unfortunately I don't have anything that plays VHS anymore. Sellers, whoever you are, PLEASE make a version of this on DVD!!! I need a DVD version of this. I've been working out with this video for years and now I can't because I don't have a VCR. I only have a DVD player. it's driving me crazy! I had a baby and I'm trying to lose the weight again. If anyone sees a DVD version of this video please let me know. Thanks.",1302048000,11,550,4.009090909090909
7787862,5,0006588204,"I have had great success with this workout!  A few years have passed since it first came out but I have stuck with this routine since 1993 ... and I have never been disappointed!  With the help of this workout routine, I lost 45 lbs. and continue to go back to it, despite the endless exercise equipment and DVD's for sale.

Whenever I wonder if this workout is getting a little dated, I search the net to discover many of the  ""hot, new"" exercises are represented in this tape. (The 1980's workout clothes cause a bit of a giggle now and then but the workout itself if GREAT!!)

My only regret is not being able to find it in DVD format.",1250899200,15,638,4.239669421487603
