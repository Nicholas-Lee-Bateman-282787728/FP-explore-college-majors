Now, with the creation of the Chainsaw Sally show, I'm an even bigger fan if that's possible.  Jimmy and April Burril and family have brought old school slasherdom to new heights with the gory and humorous season 1.  Optional laugh tracks on the episodes add flavor to this tasty treat.  Each episode is about 15 minutes of pure unadulterated old school horror.  No CGI, just blood splatter and gore that way it's meant to be.  I highly recommend it, and remember:  God hates an assmonkey.",1284940800,,584,4.611650485436893
4180913,5,B003R9K0GA,"If you are not yet familiar with the Chainsaw Sally film, I'd recommend go buy or rent it first, as it explain a bit more in depth what Sally and Ruby are all about.. but even if you haven't seen the movie you can get into this, and not feel like you missed out on what the show is about, or who they are.
Azman Toy does a great job of portraying Ruby, and of course April Burril IS chainsaw Sally.
This is just pure gory fun from point a to point b. Highly recommended, especially to have running on your TV these days leading up to halloween!",1284422400,,544,4.046296296296297
4180914,5,B003R9K0GA,"I, like many, started with Chainsaw Sally with the feature film made by Jimmy O Burril and released by Shock A Rama and Forbidden Pictures. I believe the series storyline started off as a sequel that was to be called Blood Kin (though don't quote me on that). I do know that Jimmy O Burril was using the web series to show investors the viability of the character so he could get the budget he wanted to make an amazing sequel. They were short webisodes that were high energy with lots of gore averaging bout 7 to 10 minutes long (I used to watch them just before leaving for work in the morning so my frame of mind was just in the right place). I bought the original DVD release right off the Forbidden Pictures website. A great fun time for horror and gore fans with the right blend of humor mixed in. Also I thought Azman Toy was amazing as Sally's brother Ruby.",1280793600,3,865,4.280487804878049
4180915,5,B003R9K0GA,like the other reviewer i also bought the signed dvd from the sally store website and if you like indi horror this and the full lengh movie are way better than average indi horror movies the kills aren't reel grousome but a lot of blood some nudity very funny and a very good plot i also hope troma keeps the laugh track and all the commentaries i would sugest watching the movie chainsaw sally first because the series picks up where the movie left off,1279670400,2,453,4.341176470588235
4180916,5,B003R9K0GA,"I purchased the original release of the DVD from Jimmy and April directly and what can I say its one of the best purchases Ive ever made,  I have litterally purchased every DVD thats been available and I will definately be buying this again when its out on Troma (Jimmy has already said theres a load of new extra's and knowing Troma they're gonna be fantastic).  What can I say how can you posibly go wrong its Chainsaw Sally on 2 ""Tromatic DVDS"" I' hoping its got the usual awesome Kaufman Intro I can just see imagine it now haha

I absolutely loved everything about this series and cant wait for Season 2 I loved the in joke references to the classics in particular the references to leatherface and TCM in general.  I would highly reommend checking these out on the website and then buying this.  Hopefully it will retain the canned laughter soundtrack which I loved because it gave it a really cool cheesey sitcom feel but it still retains everything that made the film so good.

I honestly can't recommend this film highly enough and urge everyone who likes a good old school horror flick with plenty of laughs and a great storyline to go out and buy as soon as it becomes available.

Also every single person who worked on this show should be proud of how it turned out Jimmy O's excellent directing as well as Herschell Gordon Lewis' expert input have allowed an amazing new horror icon a chance to progress and I hope that April Burill (Chainsaw Sally) will be around for a longtime.  Also look out for Jimmy's lovely daughter Lily who plays Po who works with Sally at the library, she could easily be the next horror icon after April",1278460800,4,1644,4.493288590604027

She's awesome groovy, beautiful and a wonderful sick crazy chainsaw killer like I love. I own 6, chainsaws of my own. And Leatherface the original Texas chainsaw massacre Gunnar Hansen is my top #1 chainsaw serial killer of all time. F*** Jason F*** Freddy F*** Michael Myers and all tge others no one can take rhe place of Gunnar Hansen. I love him and wish I could've met him before he died. I have his name and a tattoo of him on my foot. Too with a chainsaw. And I own a Poulan 306A but close to the Poulan 245A he used in the classic movie
And I own the same poster of Texas Chainsaw massacre in her room like age has in hwr roim in the movie Chainsaw Sally",1517097600,,756,4.114864864864865

8403347,5,B003R9K0GA,"Growing up, my parents forced me to watch the Donna Reed show and,  those other sickly sweet 'family show's back in the 1950's and 1960's...I'm surprise, there was not a pandemic of diabetes back then,  from all that  fake sugary sweetness on television.
Chainsaw Sally...Donna Reed SHE'S NOT!!!
It would have been way, way, way cool if Chainsaw Sally had been Donna Reed's next door neighbor!!!
It would have been Leave it to Beaver meets Hellraiser or, something along those lines. Chainsaw Sally and her show is worth all the stars in the universe but, since I'm limited to just 5 stars here, that's what I'm giving Chainsaw Sally and her show. Her show is so, so, so much better then the 'family shows' on mainstream television! Keep up the great work Ms. sally!!!",1421884800,,768,4.7164179104477615

8403349,5,B003R9K0GA,"A man and his wife created a web series of family values, serial killer and hilarity.  Shoe string budget does not hurt but helps with the gritty bloody gore and black comedy that ensues",1398816000,,186,4.470588235294118
8403350,4,B003R9K0GA,"Only H.G. Lewis and Troma could produce something so sick, twisted, and hilarious. I'm looking forward to to season 2. Sally and her brother are going to go down as great cult classic characters. Campy fun for gore and Troma fans of all ages. Check it out!",1309910400,2,256,4.468085106382978
8403351,3,B003R9K0GA,"Chainsaw Sally is an odd grab bag of things, which definitely won't be to everyone's taste. It's a comedy/horror show about a serial killer living with her brother and taking out people she finds to be 'bad'- sort of like a hot Hannibal Lector with the rude food idea. Oh yeah, they also eat them, or worse. But it's some what light hearted in it's particularly gruesome content.

The first few episodes were pretty rough, but nearing the end, a log of the jokes began to shine- an over dramatized titty twister, a particularly foul mouthed lady on a motor scooter, and the silly dialogue between Sally and her brother Ruby. The plot itself also started to improve, though I can't say too much without spoiling some things. I would say Sally has gotten off a little light so far, the last season conflict being a huge anti-climax, with few things creating conflict, and therefore plot, within the show. However, the next season looks primed for bigger problems.

Season 2 seems poised for more conflicts and some better comedic timing, as well as having more recurring characters to build off of. If Season 2 follows up on some plot strings, throws in a little light drama, finds a few more laughs, and keeps creative with the kills/victims, Chainsaw Sally Season 2 could be awesome.",1305504000,2,1283,4.723214285714286

8403353,5,B003R9K0GA,"From the filmmakers behind The Toxic Avenger and Sgt. Kabukiman comes a brand spankin' new episodic marvel, The Chainsaw Sally Show. It brings great fun to your living room thanks to the great production values throughout. By filling your stomaches with enough (al)gore, this chainsaw always keeps running hot and sexy. It will keep you satisfied!",1294704000,,347,5.214285714285714
8403354,5,B003R9K0GA,"Just like the movie this show is campy, fun, and absolutely soaked in blood. Then washed in blood, then dipped in blood again for good measure. Definitely old school horror the way it was meant to be experienced. It's nice to see that the folks at Troma are still keeping up with the good work. RECOMMEND!",1294704000,,305,4.464285714285714
