7895837,5,6305788340,"This film is amazing. The plot is rather simple: a nameless woman hides a video camera under her living-room table and invites a male friend over.  The idea is to seduce him, capture the whole thing on videotape and use the  results as her term project for her cinema course.
As the film  progresses, both characters show more (and often unexpected sides) of  themselves. For a good bit of the film, the camera (which at that point is,  remember, hidden under a table) can only capture voices and the movements  of their feet. The power of the actors' body language is quite remarkable  and the idea is odd enough to make this part of the film quite amusing. A  lot is left to the imagination: you see the couple move closer and edge  apart. There are embarrassing silences, there are moments of tension, of  silent understanding.
The film progresses glibly between eroticism,  comedy, pathos, suspense and more. As the characters become more rounded,  the relationship between them changes, as does the nature of the film. This  is basically a film about different sorts of relationships. And it's a  pretty good rollercoaster ride, with a twist ending to cap it all off. I've  never seen so much done with two actors and a fixed camera. It's cinema at  its purest.
Whether you are a devotee of foreign film or are simply  wondering what to do with your videocam now you've shot your sister's  wedding, this is a wonderful film.",965174400,14,1429,4.693548387096774
7895838,4,6305788340,"La Tarea is a daring film from the new wave of Mexican Cinema. Unfortunately for movie lovers in this country we haven't been exposed to these films. Maria Rojo is fabulous along with her co-star Jose Alonzo. The  Blair Witch Project could only wish to be THIS original! This movie is  definitely only for an adult audience due to the nudity and adult content,  yet it is carried out in a very tasteful matter.",961632000,10,410,4.513513513513513
