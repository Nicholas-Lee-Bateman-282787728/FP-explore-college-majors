6132970,5,B00H5NY8EY,"The BEAN 2-MOVIE FAMILY FUN PACK brings together both Mr. Bean motion pictures together on one disc. So, for the price of one DVD you actually get two movies: BEAN THE MOVIE and MR. BEANS HOLIDAY.

Based upon the BBC series MR. BEAN, BEAN THE MOVIE brings Rowan Atkinsons famous British character to the United States. The famous painting ARRANGEMENT IN GREY AND BLACK #1 (aka WHISTLERS MOTHER) has been purchased by a wealthy American General (Burt Reynolds) and is being brought back to the United States. After failing to fire him for ineptitude for his performance, the governing board at the museum Mr. Bean works decides to send him to America for 2-3 months to accompany the famous painting (and get him out of their hair for a spell). So, Mr. Bean arrives in America where everyone calls him Dr. Bean (its assumed he must have a doctorate in some field in art). Instead of staying at a hotel, the curator of the museum, David Langley (Peter MacNicol), arranges for Dr. Bean to stay with him and his family. Of course, things do not go as expected. Dr. Beans strange behavior leads to a series of unfortunate events that threaten Davids career and family leaving it up to Bean to right the wrongs he has caused.

Although, MR. BEAN was a huge tv success in England, the show initially didn't have much more than a cult following in the United States when it was on the air. BEAN THE MOVIE seems to have been an attempt to capitalize on the British popularity of the tv show, but make it work for an American audience. In that sense, the movie fails. The character is the same, but most everything about the story seems wrong. Instead of a full-length movie about Mr. Bean, BEAN THE MOVIE is more like a series of comedy sketches lightly tied together. It reminds me of all those movies from the late 1980s and throughout the early 1990s that were based off of Saturday Night Live sketches. Most of those SNL movies were failures because a comedy sketch doesnt usually work for anything over thirty minutes. BEAN THE MOVIE isn't as bad as many of those SNL movies because the character was already a part of a much larger world in the tv show. However, its a similar concept and many of the situations and jokes in BEAN THE MOVIE feel forced.

Its not that BEAN THE MOVIE is a horrible movie, because its not. It has some really funny segments. However, the humor is uneven.

On a completely different note, it was interesting seeing a pre-NUM3ERS Peter MacNicol in a movie. I know hes done other things, but the only thing I ever knew he was in was NUM3ERS.

Overall, BEAN THE MOVIE is a funny movie that seems to have more of an appeal for children rather than adults. Its not as funny as the Mr. Bean tv show, but its not as bad as some SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE movies it seems inspired by. Also, in terms of movie history, BEAN THE MOVIE was the first movie ever to gross $100 million dollars overseas before being released in the United States.

The other movie on the disc is MR. BEANS HOLIDAY. Taking place ten years after BEAN THE MOVIE, Rowan Atkinson returns to portray Mr. Bean one final time in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY (Atkinson announced that this MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY would be the last story that he would do as Mr. Bean). The movie opens with Mr. Bean rushing to attend a charity auction and raffle. It's the big day of the big raffle and the big prize is an all-expense paid trip to the beaches at Cannes, France. Mr. Bean ends up winning the trip and is giddy as a school boy. Bean accidently takes a taxi and is dropped off at the wrong location. Using his trusty compass, he walks all the way back to the train station. While there he has an hour to wait until his next train arrives and he gets into some mischief in a restaurant. Bean eventually gets on the train and finds himself in the company of a Russian boy. He and his father were inadvertently separated at the station due to Mr. Bean. Much of the rest of the movie involves Mr. Bean trying to get the boy back to his father and make it to Cannes. Along the way he mimes Puccini's O mio babbiono caro to earn money; beats some Tour de France bicycle riders; works as an extra in big budget movie; meets a beautiful actress; and happens to become a hit at the Cannes film festival.

MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is a far better film than BEAN THE MOVIE. BEAN THE MOVIE seemed to be more focused on tying a bunch of Mr. Bean sketches together in one film and then arranging the story around those sketches. Although there are several Bean bits (both old and new) in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY seems to have been written as a story first and then had the bits added along the way. MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is just a far better story and one with a whole bunch more heart than BEAN THE MOVIE. There are some really funny parts (such as Mr. Bean trying to eat unshelled scampi or miming opera), but the movie also has a real tenderness to it. Mr. Bean really just wants to get to the beach, but he's also protective of the Russian boy he travels with. In some ways, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is the story of when Mr. Bean began to grow up.

Overall, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is a very funny, heart-felt movie. It's a far better film than BEAN THE MOVIE and is a fine way for Mr. Bean to say farewell.

There are no special features on the DVD, but if you don't own the Mr. Bean movies already, the BEAN 2-MOVIE FAMILY FUN PACK is worth owning.",1395792000,6,5394,4.364541832669323

6133001,4,B00H5NY8EY,"I love Mr. Bean the T.V. series so I thought I'd try these two movies. The first one I would watch was Mr. Bean's Holiday. It was good, funny and I enjoyed the movie. As always you wonder through out the whole film is how is Bean going to get out of this one, or out of this situation. It will make you laugh and on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it an 8. The story line was OK they could of done more, but could of been better as well as the plot. But for laughs it was funny but not Hilariously funny. The 2nd Movie Mr. Bean the Movie was a much better movie. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 9.6 out of 10. The story line and plot were very good. This movie was alittle more serious in the plot. It was funny, not Hilariously but much better then the ""Holiday"" film which was more zany and slap-stick. Both films were entertaining and I will watch them again. I am even getting the 2-Movie pack for a friend because they were funny, entertaining and enjoyable.",1455235200,4,967,3.9137055837563453
