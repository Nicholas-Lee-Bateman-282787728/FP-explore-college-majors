I didn't think it looks homemade at all, I think the set was intentional (like other exercise videos that are on the beach, etc).

Overall this workout is good. For the most part it is typical exercises...starts with a warmup(march in place), then floor legs (squats, etc), then abs(crunches & oblique twists) & floor legs(side leg lifts & inner thigh squeezes), ending in stretching.

The floor legs section was much more challenging than I had expected (in a good way).  Even though she is basically doing a side leg lift, she has you do them holding your leg up for a long without touching the ground (such as 8 mini lifts), so you'll definitely feel the burn after just a few minutes of that. I didn't even try it with ankle weights or a resistance band yet, but I'm sure that would be an even tougher workout.

The music is energetic but got a little redundant after a while.

I would recommend this for a beginner to intermediate workout.",1161388800,2,1108,4.515

Eleonora Goya is an argentinan personal trainer and even thou she knows what she's doing, I got the feeling she got some friends together to help her out and make this video.

I would not buy any other video of hers.",1153440000,,342,4.328125
