Microsoft employees who took stock options are now millionaires. The narrator says he was looking to get rich quick on stock [pieces of paper with no intrinsic value]. It begins in a bus, frenzied people gamble. They arrive at work, an impressive building. Their company has passed a government investigation. One group is given a reward. Three months earlier we see men gambling with cards. Later two men arrive for gambling. Seth dropped out of college and runs an illegal back-door gambling place. His father, a judge, objects to this. He is offered a job if he passes a Series 7 test, and drives out to Long Island, Exit 53. Men at J.T. Marline call people to sell them stock. There is a group interview. One is immediately rejected, another for his experience! He promises them to become millionaires.

They are required to work hard, pass a Series 7 test, then sell. Its not for everyone. Later Seth talks to his father, who tells him to make an honest living. He shows up and is given a list of people to call and get them interested in a deal. They don't sell stock to women. He is told how to act. You can be whoever you want to be on the phone to impress a client. Seth talks to his family at a diner. Later he visits a big mansion. They watch a movie [Wall Street which has a better story]. One call is to a doctor. We see how he is played to make a deal. The employees meet men from JP Morgan who call their business a chop shop. Back at work they are told to dress up, and pay $300 for a textbook. He gets a sales call from the NY Daily News (for comedy). There is an incident at a bar, a gang against one man. These men are described as squanderers. Returning to work he observes unusual activity. Back home he talks to Jeff about the back-room casino.

Seth closes a deal but is rebuked. Later Seth observes a meeting. Then he meets Abby at work. He calls a customer about a drug company with a new drug. Start small. He makes a sale. They celebrate by going to Manhattan. There is conflict in a tavern. One man tells his wife about his stock purchase. Abby is questioned by the FBI. Seth is told he is on the boss team! They are told about a new medical device that is revolutionary and will make them millionaires. Seth checks out the address. They are selling stock on companies that don't exist! Once its all sold the stock crashes and wipes out the investment. Abby gets a phone call. They are told to make a sale on every telephone call. Seth answers a call from a customer and convinces him to buy more at the now lower price.

His father reproaches Seth for working at a chop shop. I don't want to see you again! Youre destroying peoples lives! Harry calls again to complain. Seth confides in his father, he wants help but won't get it. Abby has a bad feeling. The next day he is arrested for SEC violations. A telephone tap reveals a conversation! Seth offers a deal to the FBI; he knows everything. Seth will take information on his last day. Can Seth get Harrys money back? He tries. Then he copies files to a floppy. [This dates this movie.] He tells Chris about his arrest by the FBI and asks for a signature on a sell ticket so Harry will get his money back. Im so sorry. He leaves as the FBI arrives with a bus for the prisoners. Then it ends.

This is another informative movie (except for the raw language). Did this tell about its speakers? The Wolf of Wall Street in another informative movie. Selling worthless stocks and bonds in the 1920s led to the Great Depression. Selling Collateralized Mortgage Obligations that were overvalued led to the current Great Recession. You can fool people when they expect to gain by the deal. One false note is the offer by the judge to go along with Seths scheme; its out of character.",1444694400,,3781,4.357446808510638
