8253342,4,B0013XX0P0,"ETAs assassination of Admiral Carrerro Blanco was probably the most far-reaching event of the post-war years in Spain, since Franco counted on him as the guarantor of the nationalist dictatorship. The film meticulously shows how a small band of urban terrorists from ETA plot, plan and carry out the murder on 20th September 1973. This helped end fascist dictatorship in Spain. Gillo Pontecorvo was a Marxist and ETA had Marxist leanings. Pontecorvo an Italian loved the neo-realist school of directing, shown to best effect in The Battle of Algiers. Like that film,this film has a realistic, semi-documentary feel to it, although its in colour. The Basque terrorist group aware they cant kidnap him due to bodyguards, decide they can blow him up. They have to carefully avoid being seen together as a group.

To achieve this the ETA cell tunnel under a road and plant enough explosives to blow the target's car clear over the buildings in the street. This results in an absolutely mind- blowing and spectacular cinema set-piece. The events that lead to the super explosion are brilliantly crafted with edge-of-your-seat suspense. The film has a quality of acting,directing, pacing-with in-between time lapses between episodes- that impeccably rivets your attention. We are engrossed by the life of the characters. There is true emotion between the cast, which involves women. Starring former Italian Communist Party member Gian Maria Volont,Operacin Ogro is a Spanish, French and Italian co production with an Italian, Gillo Pontecorvo, at the helm. English/Italian subtitles. If you like European political thrillers like Z or Army of Shadows, then this is for you.",1442361600,,1667,5.2669172932330826
8253343,5,B0013XX0P0,"I am in the process of ordering this movie DVD, albeit a bit surprised it is NOT in Spanish, but rather in Italian with English subtitles, which is not bad. I actually watched this film in a Spanish cable network, in Castillian SPANISH. I taped it on one of my empty VHS cassettes; the movie is excellent and I enjoyed it very much!! It follows through, step by step, with the task of eliminating Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, infamous dictator Francisco Franco's successor. It digs deep into the exploitation and abuse of the Basques by the regime, focusing on the youthful days and experiences of the characters involved in the bomb plot. Gino Maria Volonte was astoundingly impeccable as one of the plotters; I recall his other acting roles in Sergio Leone's Sphaghetti westerns where the equally outstanding Clint Eastwood also starred (""A Fistful of Dollars"" & ""For a Few Dollars More "" also with Lee Van Cleef). The other actors I did not recognize, but all the same, they performed their roles magnificently; all the while, I thought the actors were all Spaniards with the exception of Volonte, who is Italian! lol The film bought back memories of the Spain I used to know when vacationing there as a child (my parents would send us there to spend the whole summer with family and friends). I continue to follow that tradition to THIS VERY DAY (I am first-generation American--which means nothing to me, really---my parents were Spanish immigrants, and today I am also a citizen of Spain complete with passport and national ID card, I am PROUD TO ADD!). I highly recommend this film to students and world history buffs and anyone with a profound admiration of Spanish history, such as myself. The previous reviewer rated this one star; to each his own, but as a Spaniard, I have MORE understanding and experienced it all, and therefore can appreciate an impeccable film such as this!!!",1319932800,2,1891,4.803680981595092
8253344,1,B0013XX0P0,"This is a film essentially about a bunch of Basque terrorists in 1970s spain digging a hole under a road so they can blow up a functionary in Franco's dictatorship.

The explosion itself is well done. The rest of the film is not so good. I didn't find the characters likeable nor was the film able to rise the act above ordinary terrorism no matter how hard it tried. Its difficult to make the ETA seem like it was just an anti-franco freedom force and its difficult to see the act as having the significance the film wants to assign to it. In retrospect, the whole thing seems rather pointless. It may have seemed more meaningful years ago, but I can only review it now. I can't recreate the mentality of euro-terrorism in the 1970s.

I have not seen the copy that is for sale as this item. I've seen an English subtitled version obtained from outside amazon.",1316390400,2,860,4.436708860759493
