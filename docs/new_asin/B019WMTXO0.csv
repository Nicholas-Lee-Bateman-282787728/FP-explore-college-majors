8746166,5,B019WMTXO0,Love this movie. It's one of my favorite childhood movies! It's got Robin Williams as Batty whose hilarious! It's got Tim Curry as a character who I won't reveal so I don't spoil anything. The musical numbers(songs) are all great! Just don't bother with sequel to this movie cause you'll just be disappointed.,1474416000,,309,4.849056603773585
