7740797,5,B01EU4VA7S,"Kelly's DVDs are now my favorite workouts. When I first started buying her DVDs they were more expensive than others I had purchased, but you understand the value right away when looking at the menu. Each DVD has two programs, plus remixes. So much variety, and I like her style. Kelly is upbeat, and pushes you to challenge yourself, but she doesn't bug me! She always has someone performing a modified version of the exercises.",1464307200,5,429,4.733333333333333

One note about this: The cardio is less than one might think from the description. For the most part, this is a strength workout, which has some light cardio mixed in to help keep your heart rate at a fat-burning level.",1455926400,23,393,4.7101449275362315
7740801,5,B01EU4VA7S,"Kelly is my personal trainer via DVD. This is the sixth DVD of her's that I have bought in the last two years. I buy her workouts where she uses dumbbells throughout the routine.

I have always exercised regularly at gyms, circuit health clubs, at home with a weight machine, etc. and I can say that I am in the best muscle shape of my life using Kelly's workouts. I rotate doing one every other day. I have increased my weights up to 12 & 15 pounds starting at 8 pounds. You will know when it is time to increase when the workouts feel too easy. The thirty minute approach works better for me than one hour programs.

I REALLY like these workouts in Strength and Stamina  - the product description is very accurate - it is fast moving providing just what the title says. These workouts are an entirely different mix of exercises from the other DVD's (they are all unique) so boredom is not an issue. Kelly is her usual peppy self and the music on this one is extremely good.

I find this to be a great value product and highly recommend it.

(It was good to see Sam as always - I like the encouraging smile from her whenever she is part of the crew because it seems to occur when I feel the most tired. I did miss Lauren though.)",1455840000,19,1230,4.217021276595744

It's nice to see more males in the DVD , and I like that it uses a lot of kettlebells

I LOVE this workout!  Wouldn't recommend for anyone just beginning with weights or anyone who has never used a kettlebell before, although you could easily substitute a weight if you don't own a kettlebell and Kelly does provide a training section, although I've never watched it.  The workout moves very quickly so I'd suggest previewing it before attempting.  I really hope KCM will do a follow-up to this workout and if you're a fan, as I obviously am, I suggest checking out all the other ""30 Minutes to Fitness"" DVD's.  I really like the easy, intense moves and Kelly's great, laid-back fun personality.

8759562,4,B01EU4VA7S,"I am a huge fan of Kelly Coffey-Meyer and own/have tried most of her fitness videos. A few of them haven't clicked with me, but most of them I have loved, particularly her strength and boxing/kickboxing workouts. Although this relatively recent addition to the ""30-Minutes Fitness Collection"" is a strength workout, I was a bit hesitant to try it. Why? Because it includes kettlebells, and although I enjoy kettlebell routines, I'm picky about workouts that include them. I prefer more traditional, hardstyle kettlebell workouts, and when I previewed this DVD from Kelly, I thought that she was doing more fast, cardio-type kettlebell work using lighter kettlebells.

After reading reviews of this DVD, I decided it was worth a try and decided to purchase it from Amazon.  Kelly and her crew of background exercisers--two female, two male--are using both dumbbells (heavier for the first workout, lighter for the second) AND heavy kettlebells for this workout. (If you don't have a kettlebell, that's okay too, as ever-present helper Sam does the entire workout without a kettlebell.) And Kelly does use the kettlebell for traditional moves. In fact, both 30-minute workouts follow the same format: there is a warm-up (the same for both routines), four standing rounds, a floor round, and a short stretch to finish. Each of the 4 standing rounds consists of 2 strength moves, performed 12 reps each (with a few exceptions), repeating for three total cycles, and then, at the end of the third cycle, there is a a kettlebell move (the floor round is the same but without the kettlebell move at the end).

The Main Menu offers the following options:
*Introduction
*Warm Up
*Workout One
*Workout Two
*Premixes
*Bonus Step (22:41)
*Credits
*Music On/Off

I've provided more detailed information on each section below.

***WARM UP***
As noted above, this is the same for both workouts; clock time is 5:45, but actual time is about 5 1/2 minutes after Kelly's intro of her crew. The moves include trunk rotations, reaches, arm circles, squat, mock kettlebell swings (to get the difference between a squat and a swing--this is really the only explanation on the DVD), low back stretch, alternating knees, and reverse lunge/reverse twist. Kelly finishes with some light cardio in the form of shuffles/jacks/jogs, stretches the hamstrings with heel digs, and then ends with kettlebell halos.

***BONUS STEP***
Kelly, Lauren, and Laurie workout here, completing a total of 5 short routines. The music is high energy--although oddly, the first song used is the ""It's Time to Party"" song that is a theme for another workout series (Turbo Jam). In addition to classic step moves, Kelly adds some of her own twists, such as boxing. I expect that those who enjoy step will find this to be a nice little addition to the DVD.

Overall, I enjoyed this DVD quite a bit!  One of the things I like about Kelly is her many premix options, although I do wish that the premixes were a bit more varied here (e.g., there is no premix with just all dumbbell moves; similarly, a short cardio-only premix with all the kettlebell swings would have been nice as well). I liked the that the weight workout covered all major muscle groups and was mostly standing, although I didn't mind the last series being floorwork. I also enjoyed Kelly's choice of kettlebell moves. I did disagree a bit with Kelly's form, as she raises the kettlebell up to forehead level, almost over her head, whereas I was taught to keep it more at chest level. Also, because there is no kettlebell tutorial on this DVD, I definitely would NOT recommend it for someone who is new to workout with kettlebells. Kelly's DVDs are generally geared mainly to intermediate and above exercisers, and this one is no exception--with experience in kettlebells being a must as well. With those small caveats, I will reiterate that found this to be a great strength DVD, and I would definitely recommend it, with a final rating of 4 1/2 stars.",1526256000,13,5808,5.052192066805845
8759563,5,B01EU4VA7S,"I almost didn't give this 5 stars because the ""music"" in my opinion just sucks. Then I turned it off. OK, it's weird doing the workouts in silence with just Kelly's talking and natural sounds, but WAY better than the offbeat noise in the background. She even tells you on one of the sets to ignore the tempo because it's too fast and if you try to workout to the music you could hurt yourself.

Also, I almost didn't like the whole thing at first because I thought they were too easy. After 3 sets of each circuit you will definitely feel it the next day! I kept at them all week, doing a different workout or premix each day, and realized that they were working! I also loved the 22 minute ""Bonus Step"" option for cardio.  I added that to one of the 23 minute pre-mixes for a longer workout today.  When I first looked through the premixes I didn't think they'd be worth doing, but they really are. They make a fine mix that you can stretch out for a week or more of variety that works your whole body very thoroughly.

To those who say the Bonus Step is too fast and the cuing isn't great, I get what you mean. But if you've done any step workouts you'll catch on pretty fast. If not, just keep doing them several days in a row and you'll be able to keep up quite well. I've done it twice and I was still a bit slow on the uptake for the 3rd circuit, but I know I'd be able to keep up if I did them tomorrow (which I might, because it's fun.) Again, kind of odd to do without music, but maybe I can play my own music with it next time.

Suggestion to those who produce Kelly's workout music:  If you can give us a choice between your ""music"" selection and silence, how about an option for different types of music? Something that isn't off the count and too fast. Something that isn't this new ""techno"" crap that is almost as bad as rap crap. We used to have some pretty good rock 'n roll in my day (I know I sound like an old person), but seriously, there has to be something better than this! Led Zeppelin? Steppenwolf? Even a ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" type thing minus Richard Simmons would far surpass this really horrible stuff you've chosen! Just a single drum to keep the beat would beat this noise. Thanks for any consideration you can give to this suggestion for future videos.",1522972800,,2287,4.221967963386728

8759567,5,B01EU4VA7S,I have been working out with Kelly for years. This is a great Metabolic workout. I like this one because you can go a bit heavier than other metabolic workouts. Cathe is my other favorite instructor.,1510444800,2,199,4.555555555555555

8759569,5,B01EU4VA7S,"I have several of her videos. This is my new favorite. I really like the addition of the kettle bells. Maybe some will not like that. I have heard mixed things about the swings, like they are not that good for you. However, I love them (and the other kettle bell moves) and think it add nice variety to the workout. I even bought a set, so I don't have to substitute a dumbbell. As usual, there are many premixes on the video. I haven't even gotten to those because I'm enjoying the regular workouts so much. I rotate through her videos each week, and have been very happy. I like the 30 minute block of time, and while the music is always sort of lame, the workouts are ""no nonsense.""

8759571,4,B01EU4VA7S,"This workout consists of two 30 minute kettlebell routines, for which a dumbbell can be substituted.  Depending on whether you use lighter or heavier weights, the workout's intensity can vary, although I don't think it would be good for a beginner.  Kelly is a fabulous instructor and these are excellent workouts.  There is a third workout, which is a 22 minute step routine.  I bought this dvd, choosing it over other ones by Kelly, because it had the additional step workout.  I was very disappointed with it. The workout begins doing some athletic moves on the step that are not hard to follow.  But then, out of nowhere, Kelly gets to doing very dancey and complicated routines, with absolutely no cueing!  Not one word of instruction!  It was terrible, and I won't be able to use the step part of this dvd.  That's why I deducted one star.",1500768000,5,845,4.655405405405405
