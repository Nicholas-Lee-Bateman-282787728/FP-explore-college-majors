8037406,5,B00062J0J4,"I ran across a copy of this DVD several years ago and really like watching it.  It ended up becoming damaged and I wanted a replacement copy.

I also have the 70's and 80's versions of this set, but really this is the best one of the bunch.  The 60's in hindsight are clearly shown to be the golden age of Indy.  Starts with the end of the roadsters, mixes in the Turbine cars, rear engine prototypes, and ends with what we'd recognize as today's Indy cars.  The complete change from 1960 to 1969 couldn't be greater.  The color footage of each race highlights and the extra feature on the rear engined cars make it worth having.  The layout of this dvd is a little bit ""clunky"" but not a big problem.  Interviews with Roger Ward and Parnelli Jones may be my favorite parts of this dvd.  I wish there had been more interviews with Hill, but Stewart, Rathman, and AJ make up for it.",1352505600,,881,4.290909090909091
8037407,5,B00062J0J4,A chronological walk thru the decade at Indy. The interviews are worth the watch. The footage of which some is the first I have ever seen is incredible. A MUST purchase for any Indy fan. Found out it was a 5 DVD set and bought it immediately!,1186531200,,242,4.170212765957447
