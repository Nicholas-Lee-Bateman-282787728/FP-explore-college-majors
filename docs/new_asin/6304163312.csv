7863837,5,6304163312,"A friend of mine with one Deaf child and one hearing child recommended this video to me.  She said it was one of the few videos out there that both of them could enjoy at the same time.

The songs are catchy and fun, and the signing is more extensive than most videos (there are actually signs for the entire concepts in the song, not just a word here and there).  The signs are ASL not Signed English, which is also wonderful.

The songs on this tape include:

People are having fun

I can do anything

The Unicorn Song

I sign like this

I'll be friends with you

Open your heart America",1091318400,2,589,4.178571428571429
