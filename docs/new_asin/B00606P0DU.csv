I decided to buy this Season 1 to watch with my young sister since it's been years since it was on TV, and despite now being 19 loved every minute of it just as much as I did when I was younger!
The product itself came in perfect condition and does have all 26 full episodes. Now I'm just looking for season 2 & 3!
Highly recommended!
Each character grows over the season and you really get a sense of the relationships between them. The antics of Dexter, Surge and the sharks, along with the situations Lopaka and Flipper find themselves in teach kids about being honesty, fairness and trustworthiness.
A great time!",1422403200,,772,4.521428571428571
8490124,5,B00606P0DU,"My 5-year-old son and I love these shows.  They are high quality shows with good stories, that deal with some of the things that kids deal with:  peer pressure, fear, competition, bullying, standing up for what is right.  I truly believe that watching these shows, and talking about them as a family, can help build character for both kids and adults.

I highly recommend the Flipper and Lopaka shows.",1388966400,,401,4.768115942028985
8490125,5,B00606P0DU,My kids have been watching the Series in German but now we also will get it in English. They can watch it over and over again. It is a wonderful Show for children!,1330041600,,163,3.9696969696969697
8490126,5,B00606P0DU,"I had never seen this show before, but I decided to take a chance since it was 26 episoeds for only $13. I loved it. I finished it and started over again and again and again, etc. It's that good. And it is wholesome. No Foul language or sex. Little Mermaid type violence. The bad guys get what coming to them in the end. There are some explosions, but you only see the after effects of the explosions, not the explosions themselves. You only hear them. I would say if you are unsure whether it is age appropriate for your child watch it yourself first. I highly recommend ""Flipper and Lopaka: Complete Season 1"". If there is a Season 2 I hope it comes out soon. Above it says Lopaka is Polynesian, but he is not. Lopaka is from a mythical tribe called the Millihune.",1325980800,2,766,4.289655172413793
