6264456,5,B00IICFEX0,"The producers of this show have truly brought these locations to life through 3D computer reconstructions.  Are they completely accurate?  Of course not -- there could never be enough evidential  information to produce complete reproductions -- but they are fascinating, entertaining, and informative.  I have watched every episode, and will watch them again.  I hope this series remains on Amazon, as I will return to it again and again!",1400630400,,438,5.2898550724637685
6264457,3,B00IICFEX0,"I  have enjoyed most episodes that I have viewed, but I am tired of repeats about Palmyra and Petra. Producers need to check that links and titles are correct. I am referring particularly to the link for the episode On The Courses Of The Phoenicians. It is wrong and misrepresents its title because it really repeats the episode on Ports of the Desert. Please correct this error.",1400371200,,379,4.656716417910448
6264458,4,B00IICFEX0,"I love history and archaeological research, so I felt this series was a joy to watch!  A reminder that history is not ""dead,"" but that new findings continually cause us to reprise our knowledge and perceptions of the past.",1400025600,,222,4.6923076923076925
6264459,5,B00IICFEX0,Love the recreation of some of the historic sites. Very informative too. Can't wait to watch more from this series.,1399766400,,115,4.8
6264460,5,B00IICFEX0,Well done and most informative.  The background for the finds were always exciting and added a lot.  Ready to watch it for a second time.,1399766400,,137,4.44

6264462,3,B00IICFEX0,"I am a huge history fan, but the monotonous tone of the narrator without any interaction with an individual explaining the context is soooooo boring.  Again, love history, but why make this series so difficult to listen to???",1506297600,,225,4.921052631578948
6264463,4,B00IICFEX0,"An absolute breeze to watch.  It's a nicely paced, well narrated series.  The episodes are short and they give you a lot of information in a fairly fun way.

I'm docking a star for a few reasons.  One, the resolution is absolutely terrible, but it's old, I guess that can't be helped.  Still annoying.  Two, as the eps are short AND they give you a lot of information, they never actually go into detail about anything.  This series is sort of a traveler's guide to the ancient world, something you'd watch before heading over there yourself on a tour.

Overall, a definite A+ on my scale.  I definitely enjoyed it, and wish there were more episodes!",1505606400,,650,4.5344827586206895

6264465,4,B00IICFEX0,"Very interesting and, as some have said, highly relaxing. Beauty of this series is the very scientific, unemotional way it's delivered - wonderful shots of ancient sites, great commentary and some really interesting facts (like the lives of the Etruscans which made me realize how little I knew about this evolved and intriguing peoples). Little dated (what isn't on Amazon Prime) in screen formatting and computer graphics but with such a solid archeologically sound, scientific delivery that this doesn't matter.",1498435200,,514,5.4375

6264472,5,B00IICFEX0,"I watched the series in three days (Ok, I was sick so that was the main reason for binge watching) but it was wonderful! loved the narrator who did a great job.  The music background at times got a bit loud but you could hear clearly all said.  Only mishap is with episode 15, I did report it, first its the previous episode and second its in Spanish.  so episode 15 is missing from season. The rest played well and though some facts are guesses, its a fun way of watching places around the world I will never get to set foot in.",1486944000,,529,4.116504854368932

The cinematography of ancient sites and artifacts is breathtaking and awe-inspiring.  The only disappointment is that there are a number of factual errors in the narration (i.e., Cleopatra's ancestry); but it appears this Italian-produced series is geared for the tourism industry - so, it does a wonderful job of inspiring the viewer to want to travel to these sites.

6264749,4,B00IICFEX0,"I found this series very interesting.  I have enjoyed hearing some of the facts.  However, there was one or two I did not toally agree with, but overall it has been very fascinating.",1477526400,,182,4.484848484848484
6264750,1,B00IICFEX0,"This ""documentary"" starts with a bizarre UFO tale and then devolves into what can only be described as an attack of archaeology.  While claiming that established ""orthodox archaeologists"" (read that, people with credentials, more about that later) are closed minded and suppressing new ""verified evidence"", this proceeds to present nothing but unverifiable claims.  They start out with claiming to see UFO imagery in famous works of religious art, but are merely assigning their own interpretation to artistic symbology.  They demand ""verified data"" and then present an ""inventory"" stone that is not available to show us, and point instead to someone else's earlier writings as ""proof"" while rejecting the writings of other historians before that.  Most hilarious was their ""calculations"" that came up with correlations to distance to the sun and the direction of Bethlehem etc... I once had a ""formula"" that could be used to take the a number from the side of an HO-Scale train Shell Oil tanker car and get the calculator to spell out ""Shell Oil"" if you inverted it afterward.  You can come up with a formula to make numbers come out to any ""solution"" you desire with enough operations!  While constantly claiming to have ""evidence"" that disproves what has been taught, much of what they actually focus on is what's NOT there.  In the process, they fall into the same racist trap as many others with these theories.  They can't explain how the people of that time accomplished such monumental engineering feats so they just assume that there is no way that they possibly could have and jump to the conclusion that someone else, either alien, on in this case ""Gods"" must've done it instead!  It is an incredibly racist viewpoint.  We have plenty of evidence of advanced cultures (Mayans, Aztecs, Minoans) who were either wiped out, or conquered and their culture was lost.  There is no valid reason to assume otherwise here.

To top it all off, their ""archaeologist"" Martin Gray, is nothing of the sort.  You can find his bio here: [...] He is actually a former monk and a photographer of ""sacred sites"" who has done work for National Geographic but his only professional credentials is that he BEGAN studies at the University of Arizona but ""soon left"".  It's ironic because he early on dismisses the work of a British ""antiquities"" expert because he was never trained as an archaeologist, but neither was Mr. Gray!  Sadly, this is par for the course in the type of pseudo-science that is currently out there with the inundation of cable TV and internet junk food.  Even the ""History"" Channel has fallen prey to it.",1477440000,2,2616,4.924829157175399

Nevertheless, the few episodes that I have been able to watch are well crafted and, apparently aimed at an audience with little to less interest in archeology.

The murderous, chest opening, heart removing, human sacrificing Aztecs were glorious and wonderful. They were beaten by terrible, wretched white guys. Absolutely NO mention of the white guy's 100,000 Native allies who were happy to not see their friends and relatives murdered. No even handed mention that the Spaniards had religious beliefs also, and believed they were bringing ""their real God"" to the heathen. If the  intent is to provide propaganda to ignorant 8 year olds, this might work. But provide accurate historical information? Zero stars is too high a rating.",1474502400,,707,5.201754385964913

I don't much like the opening scenes as the CGA is really swooping and fast and gives me nausea to watch.  I'm sure the director thought it was exciting and artistic.  The closed captioning is fair but sometimes you see ""inaudible"" when I could clearly hear the word.

1. The filming repeatedly pans over the same scenes while the voice description drones on about the history. It is not so much the content, but rather the way that it is delivered that I didn't like.
2. While the voice drones on, there is music in the background that makes it even more droning, Because of this, I often find it hard to stay awake during these shows, even though they only last half an hour.",1472860800,,585,4.425925925925926

They present both sides of it,the advocates, and well credentialed professionals in the field opinions.  An Interesting look at new ideas on the age and thoughts of ancient sites.  They encourage you to actually look through the door they open and ponder, is it, or is it not a valid new idea about this site. The planet is more full of interesting sites than I was aware existed.  Now more universities are out there looking at more ancient sites.

Kemet( as it was called before the Greek name was given) literally means Black! However every single depiction and person in this episode is white. I question the authenticity of some of the ""statues"" which appear to have been lightened beyond recognition( as was done back in the day) .  I would not recommend this episode to anyone to watch, as it is inaccurate in its depictions(which is very important.).  Ps- to the guy that reviewed this episode as well and stated that Cleopatra was not African....I your dreams! She married  a Roman. But she was absolutely Black",1471132800,,703,4.745901639344262

Many artifacts discovered during the digs are shown along with skillful use of 3D imagery to portray what the buildings may have looked like when they were in their prime.
Best part is that it is not too technical nor too ""dumb"".  The episodes are only 30 minutes long and they don't spend a lot of time with interviews of experts.  Instead they focus on providing a hint of the the civilization - and if the city/country/people seem interesting, the viewer can do more in-depth exploration on their own.

The narrator has a perfect voice, both calm and authoritative, reminiscent of a firm father figure.
The only thing I don't like is the sound effects.  They are cheesy and off putting, but at least they aren't very loud.

6265150,3,B00IICFEX0,Informative but edited poorly.  Seems that one photo is repeatedly used.  Surely other photos must exist to illustrate.

6265213,5,B00IICFEX0,"Great filming with history and anthropology added to tell the story behind these excavations.  Also presents virtual depictions of structures as they would have looked when the were originally constructed.

6265217,5,B00IICFEX0,Very interesting and moves along.  Doesn't get bogged down but quite a lot of information.,1461024000,,90,5.0
6265218,5,B00IICFEX0,This covers a lot of artifacts and architecture that are usually not included in shows of this type.  He also shows how the different civilizations moved geographically and interacted with each other throughout the Mediterranean.,1461024000,,229,5.542857142857143
6265219,1,B00IICFEX0,This program uses ancient computer graphics and the gentleman voicing the ancient characters is terrible. The history portion is great.,1461024000,,135,5.8

6265227,3,B00IICFEX0,"This is a simple, introductory series to several archeological sites. It plays more like something created by a tourist board. That said, the episodes are entertaining enough, if shallow, just doesn't cover the latest findings and analysis.",1459814400,,240,5.513513513513513
6265228,4,B00IICFEX0,"I have watched several episodes, and found them all very informational; and even on cultures I already knew a lot about, I still learned something new each episode. However, because the episodes are pretty short, I would have to say, for any particular episode, the show gives more of a general overview of that culture, rather than a more in-depth look. I watch a lot of archeology shows, so can compare, and there are some, which I absolutely loved, that definitely provide more in-depth information, but this one covers a lot of cultures in a short amount of time. So, if you do not necessarily need to know a lot, but want to be informed about a particular culture, this show is great for that. This show would probably be good for any teachers wanting to supplement their classroom curriculum. It's not overly entertaining, i.e., did not have me glued to the screen or anything, but it definitely covers a lot in a short amount of time, and is well put together.",1459641600,,967,4.627906976744186
6265229,2,B00IICFEX0,"I wish I could get into this, but the narration is just too glib and silly for me.

6265230,3,B00IICFEX0,It was informative and he followed a timeline coming forward.  My husband is quite knowledgeable in this field and he spotted a couple of errors as we watched.  No Secrets here!  CJ,1459209600,,181,4.59375

6265242,5,B00IICFEX0,It is a great series. The only issue is the audio that's not synced with the video and also that the Amazon team forgot to put an image icon for it on their repertoire of movies. You can't find it from the SEARCH button.,1453507200,,220,4.0227272727272725

6265245,4,B00IICFEX0,"There are about 25 chapters in only one season. They make a quick review, in chapters of about 25 minutes, of many ancient archaeology treasures especially those located in the Aegean sea and Anatolia (now Turkey). We can saw the ruins and ancient jewelry and pottery and also the heritage legacy of especially from ancient cultures like Greeks, Romans, Egyptian, Minoans, Hittites, Arabians. Also there are few chapters about Americas ancient cultures like Aztecs, Mayan, Incas, Moches, Nazcas. And one chapter for Malta. It's a great collection for look the ancient legacy really. There is only two issues the Chapter 22 is lost and the chapter 15 about the Phoenicians is not there and the chapter 14 is streamed instead. So chapter 14 is repeated instead 15. I would like to ask Amazon to find out those two lost chapters. Of course the series is not much updated and with old content however here there is much information packet in a 25 minutes show. Most of the information and historical facts shown are current. This is a must for an Archaeology / Antropology / History student and for all like me who really enjoy the ancient history.",1447718400,2,1144,4.812182741116751

6265265,4,B00IICFEX0,"I watched Secrets of the Island of Minos and it was good as an overview, with just slightly too much focus on the myth of Atlantis (and also implying that Plato thought it was a real thing, when he actually created it as a morality tale). But it was good for those looking for an introduction to ancient civilizations, with nice graphics and good information.

6265317,4,B00IICFEX0,"While the series is enjoyable for the most part, there are some inaccuracies, and some distracting issues due to mistranslation and mispronunciation. The series was originally done in Italian and it's clear that the translator had approximately zero knowledge of ancient history. As an example, there is an early episode discussing Trajan's defeat of the Parni, described as the ""successors to the Persians"". Trajan defeated the Parthians, successors to the Persians. Where the translator came up with the Parni is not clear. A narrator with a better understanding of correct pronunciations of many ancient sites would also be helpful, or at least a scriptwriter able to provide a pronunciation guide.
The translator clearly was also unaware of the term ""ballista"", which refers to a siege weapon that is essentially a giant crossbow - the translation was to 'catapult"", which isn't the same weapon.

That said, there are great views of the locations and introductions, at least, to some places and historical nations with which many people may be unfamiliar.",1411430400,,1059,5.266272189349112
6265318,5,B00IICFEX0,Great series,1411084800,,12,5.5
6265319,3,B00IICFEX0,"Sometimes documentaries on the ancient Maya just mention things that every other documentary on the topic already did.  However, there were things here that I didn't know and thus this was useful for me.  Like always, the work touches on how great it was that an ancient society could be so advanced, but how sad it was that it had been in declines for centuries, even before the arrival of the Spanish.  It posits that human rivalries played a much greater role in the civilizations decline than did drought.
This has reenactments here.  They are not cheesy like in some old History Channel programs.  Further, they are ethnically correct.  They used dark-skinned Central Americans for the roles.  Ive seen a British documentary on the Crusades where they just threw brown makeup on a white actors face, rather than hire an actual actor of Arab descent for the role.  There is some CGI here that is great as well.
Violence is really emphasized here.  Unlike Cracking the Maya Code, in which the fallacy that the Maya were peaceful stargazers was described as promulgated by just one person, this documentary just dismisses the claim generally.  The documentary shows a painting I had seen before, but it points out that some captured people had their fingernails cut off.  It said that the huge pyramids were so tall in order to shame captured people who were about to be sacrificed.  Think about the film Apocalypto in that matter.  It showed individuals smashing up former rulers thrones.  The mutilation of lips and genitals is also mentioned.
This is a British documentary.  Usually in documentaries about places outside of the West, Ive seen scholars interviewed who were both native and Western.  This seemed to only show scholars from University of Calgary, a Canadian institution, I believe.  One scholar spoke Spanish, but quite slowly and cautiously.  One scholar mentioned that it is easier to read stone glyphs at night, rather than in the day, because theres too much brightness when the sun is out.  Like many a documentary, its emphasized how difficult it is to travel to and enter the site in question.  I always feel this is meant to paint archaeologists like they were modern-day Indiana Joneses; plus it kills time.
I thought it was very insightful that the work compared the fall of this empire to the fall of the Soviet Union.  Its not like people from that former nation disappeared; they just become smaller countries in which some are faring decently and others are not.  In Central America centuries ago, some areas fell apart while others lasted longer.  One could benefit from seeing this after seeing Cracking the Maya Code.",1409529600,,2653,4.8991031390134525
