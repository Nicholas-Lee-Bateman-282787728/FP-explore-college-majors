7009407,4,B00TGNLWJK,Any dvd w/Team Umizoomi is a keeper for my child,1438128000,,48,3.9
7009408,5,B00TGNLWJK,"This is a classic Nickelodeon DVD jam packed with lots of Nickelodeon characters. My kids like it because it has a little of everything with six different characters , so all three of them get to watch what they want! This particular title is all about S.T.E.M. topics, meaning the episodes cover science, technology, engineering and math. Now they are regular episodes that have been televised and nothing different about them, but underlaying lessons of S.T.E.M. topics. Kids won't even know they are learning! The characters are all wholesome and cute. Perfect to watch one episode or multiple ones. We watch this mostly in the car while waiting at different activities!

Lets Learn: S.T.E.M. includes the following episodes:

Blaze and the Monster Machines Tool Duel
PAW Patrol Pups Save an Ace/Pups Save the Wedding
Bubble Guppies Build Me a Building
Team Umizoomi Lets Play Math Dragons
Dora the Explorer School Science Fair
Blue's Clues Contraptions",1430092800,2,956,5.161290322580645

7009410,5,B00TGNLWJK,"We use the STEM and STEM 2 DVDs in the van to keep our 2.5 year old occupied when we're going to be in the car for a while. He LOVES them, and the variety of episodes keeps his toddler brained entertained. It's also fun to hear your 2.5 year old tell his grandparents about trajectory because he learned it from one of these episodes. If they're going to watch TV, at least these teach them something!",1493078400,,401,4.220779220779221

7009416,4,B00TGNLWJK,"We purchased a few movies for our son for Christmas and this was one of them. He already has the STEM 1 Dvd which features a lot of his favorite shows and characters. The difference between this one and the others is that this particular dvd has doubles of some of the shows. There are two Blaze episodes, two Paw Patrol episodes, and it just seems like they could have added a few of their other popular shows to this instead of doubling shows. Stem stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math and I think it's important for kids to learn those subjects since they are key subjects that make the world around us work the way it does. Still a great dvd, I just wish there were more variety on it. There is a worksheet on the back of the dvd cover, so there's that!",1483574400,3,774,4.308219178082192
7009417,5,B00TGNLWJK,"Great DVD series for the little ones. My daughter can't seem to get enough. I love that they take episodes from the different shows and put them all on this dvd.

7009426,5,B00TGNLWJK,"I have a toddler (2yo) that hates car rides partially due to the fact that I have him rear facing, but we installed a DVD player in the back to keep him happy and this is our go-to DVD for it. In fact, I rarely change out the DVD for something else because he asks to watch this one. It starts off with an episode of Blaze which is his absolute favorite show ever, he might even be a tad obsessed with it! Lol. And then it continues with the other cartoons and lasts even for some pretty long car rides,  so it's not one of those super short DVD's. Also, it auto-starts after a minute or so, which is a must have for me so I don't forget to hit play (I've done that with other DVD'S before and couldn't figure out why he was upset for a minute, lol) or have to mess with the remote while driving. Over all we love this DVD and have had it for around 3 months. For some reason I'm not too terribly sick of it yet, I try to tune it out with my music while driving, lol. Definitely recommend this for any toddlers who like these cartoons!",1471824000,2,1035,4.0

7009431,5,B00TGNLWJK,"This is the second in the Let's Learn series and includes four different Nickelodeon characters in seven episodes. Each of the episodes features a different STEM topic behind the fun adventures of the characters. The shows teach great lessons and are perfect for preschoolers. Kids won't even realize they are learning something as they enjoy the show. The episodes are previously aired on television episodes but my kids enjoy that they are all on one dvd, especially with the various characters.

I received this product to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1462060800,,575,5.117021276595745
