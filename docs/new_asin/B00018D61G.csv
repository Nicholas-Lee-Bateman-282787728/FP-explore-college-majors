8007754,5,B00018D61G,The more I watch this review the more I want to watch it. Sure it's a littleshort but at least you get true DVD digital picture qualityThe new 2005 F1 review looks like a 80s VHS tape that sat in the sun for a few years. These beautiful cars were meant to be paused and replayed in slo mo forever. Maybe somedayF1 will get it.,1149292800,,326,4.030769230769231
8007755,4,B00018D61G,"I love racing of all kinds, but F1 really gets me going. I never get to see the races on TV so this dvd is the only way that I can see it.  I loved every second of it. There could have been a lot more done with this dvd, like more in car shots or rpm shots. But this dvd is basically a review of the 2003 season.  That's all you get, just information and video clips of every race of the season.  Like anyone else, I would have loved to see more camera angles and hear more engine sounds but this is all we get so I will take it. True, it will leave you wanting more, but you'll just have to get over it unless you can go to a race or find a better dvd, both of which are probably unlikely. So if you're a fan of F1 racing then I promise you'll like this dvd.",1105056000,,759,3.73125
8007756,5,B00018D61G,"Heres one great DVD for the F1 fans. It covers the full qualifying laps of the pole sitters and the main events in the race. Actions made off and on the track. It even covers the controversy of the Michelins tires being a little too wide. Well aren't we all great to see Schumacher trying to work his talents when his car is no better than his rivals. Raikkonen scored his maiden win and so does Fernando Alonso whos two years down the road from his age. Making Alonso the youngest ever driver to win a grand prix. Raikkonen almost winning the championship pondering what it would have been if he had scored points in races he retired such as Canada and Spain, which would make him the youngest f1 driver to win the championship. but he didn't do that of course and Schumacher took his 6th world title barely. Raikkonen and Montoya took it to the wire. And its great to see the making of a new Schumacher, Alonso win his first race. Overall a great video, wether you like it or not its the only way to see these guys, champion in the making battle and find glory in what could be the best years of their career.",1089417600,3,1111,4.295238095238095
8007757,5,B00018D61G,"Formula 1 is the best form of motor racing and the true world championship. The series visits 16 countries on 5 diffrent continents each season.
