I purchased this for my son who is about to become a father, he loved this DVD when he was a little boy. I did not realize someone would actually charge that much money to burn a DVD. I would like my money back, the product could just be thrown in the trash.",1465862400,2,375,3.883116883116883

8187364,1,0843136731,"I bought this movie hoping it would be a good little movie for my son, he is a dinosaur fanatic. I was soo disappointed this movie lasted 30 min, the dinosaurs are so fake looking and they talked about maybe 5 dinosaurs. I wasted money on this. Terribly disappointed. Should have cost maybe $5.00.",1327795200,3,297,4.518518518518518
