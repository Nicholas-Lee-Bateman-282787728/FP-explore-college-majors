2649358,3,B000I0QLSM,"This movie is moderately entertaining. It is definitely B-movie quality. There is some bad acting, over-acting, and the writing is what you would expect for a B-production. I noticed a lot of exuberant reviews. I think these folks are giving the film too much praise. It is a solid 2.5-3. Your average film that will entertain, but not impress.",1360368000,,344,4.8474576271186445
2649359,1,B000I0QLSM,"I have to rate this film extra low to inject a little reason into this ridiculously high (at this time, four stars!) rating it has here.
It is not even up to the standards of an ABC after-school special.
My main complaint, after the premise, the script, and the b-acting, is the music rising and drowning out the most crucial dialog...again and again.
Somewhere there are people embarrassed by this movie, and others who should be.
Life is short, don't waste your time.",1355184000,21,469,4.662650602409639

2649361,3,B000I0QLSM,"Jaime Roland (Talia-Lynn Prairie) recently cured of cancer has to undergo one more test. It seems that she expired during the test. Stephen Roland (Billy Wirth) her father will not settle for That sometimes happens and goes out of his way to find answers.

As with all good tech-mysteries we have good guys and bad. Or maybe the equipment its self. And as with all good mysteries you may be thinking it is always the last person you would suspect. I guess you will have to watch to see.

The filming is good, the timing is well paced, and the plots are plausible.",1315094400,,563,4.456310679611651
2649362,4,B000I0QLSM,"The movie was an enjoyable thriller/mystery that features a final twist at the end which I will not spoil.  Although adequately foreshadowed, there are some events that don't quite make sense in the new light, so it's slightly unsatisfying, like it was tacked on at the end rather than building towards it.

What really bothers me about the movie is the central idea that a MRI machine can kill people due to malicious code inserted into its firmware.  The ""drone virus"" refers to a computer virus that allows PCs to become zombies and due to bidding of the controller.  This is a problem with unsecured Windows PCs in real life, but the malware here is not a virus at all, but does allow remote operation, in this case to fry patient's brains.

So, how does an MRI fry someone's brain, making it looks like some kind of unknown seizure?  They say repeatedly that it ""increases the radiation"".  Well, an MRI doesn't involve radiation of any kind, but rather uses a big magnet to align the water molecules in the body; when the field is switched off the molecules swing back, emitting a very faint signal that is picked up by the machine.  The radio frequency used might be considered ""radiation"", it is not ""ionizing radiation"" meaning it doesn't knock things loose from molecules in the body, and doesn't cause any damage whatsoever.  The only risks involve flying metal objects, and getting too hot.

I worry that this will only create fear of a machine that is perfectly safe, or perhaps is a symptom that such misplaced fear already exists in the general population.  Perhaps the book was better (more technically plausible) and the movie messed it up?

Like many movies these days, it will be enjoyed more if you don't know anything about computers.  In this case, it's also enjoyable if you don't know anything about medical imaging or general knowledge of what MRI actually is.  And if that's you, remember that this is fiction and sabotage, not an inherent danger in the technology.",1253491200,6,1990,4.747093023255814

8142712,1,B000I0QLSM,"Mr. Wirth, I love you as an actor, but the story line of this movie??  Not sure where the screen player writer was going or trying to accomplish. ( I'm using my sisters sign on.)  So the plot,  MRI machine in question.  Dr. and head of security with hospital.  The other Dr. that received the grant to continue her research.  Who beat up the MRI tech?  How was she able to locate Roland after his ship was blown up?  What was going on??????????????  And why would his baseball cap fall off when he fell in the hallway.  And other baseball players flying in the air don't have that problem.??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1504828800,,662,4.990825688073395

8142714,4,B000I0QLSM,"A man named Steve Roland (Billy Wirth) takes his daughter in for a routine MRI. All is well until she begins seizing and her brainwaves go flat. What went wrong? Why did this girl simply die? Roland wants answers. During a hospital board meeting, it is disclosed that other patients have died suddenly. The hospital, fearing lawsuits, puts all of the blame on the doctor performing the scans. Roland meets w/ the doctor and discovers that an experimental drug had been used on the other patients, but not on his daughter. He launches his own investigation, posing as a tech worker at the hospital. Roland enlists the help of another doctor who witnessed his daughter's death. Soon, bad things start happening to anyone who opens their mouth. A conspiracy is under way, and Roland, along w/ anyone who tries to help him, is in serious danger. Another death occurs during an MRI, and the technician decides to suggest that the machine be shut down. He is beaten almost to death, and winds up framed for the MRI ""malfunctions"". Roland's inquiries lead to further revelations of malfeasance and nefarious goings-on. He is nearly killed. Can he uncover the truth before his life is prematurely terminated? THE DRONE VIRUS is an excellent medical thriller in the same vein as movies like COMA or ANATOMY. There's something about the prospect of eeevil, conspiratorial doctors that's extra frightening. Makes me wonder about that last check up! Hmmm...",1390608000,3,1445,4.950617283950617
8142715,1,B000I0QLSM,"Not a quality production, to say the least.  Save yourself some time and skip this one.  It's bad.  The acting, script, sound pretty much everything feels like it was shot on a $2000 budget.",1379635200,,190,4.529411764705882
8142716,4,B000I0QLSM,"The movie was not what I had expected, but it was an interesting movie with a twist at the end that I was not totally prepared for.  The movie does not move very fast as far as action but the acting was pretty good and it had a good plot.  I gave 4 stars because I enjoyed the movie and would recommend to others if you enjoy a little suspense and mystery and not up for a loud movie.",1375056000,,384,3.848101265822785
8142717,1,B000I0QLSM,"Another in the long line of medical drama movies that seem to be all the rage.  Too bad this one isn't very well writen.  The movie moves way too slowly and is full of convenient ""twists.""  The music, as other people have pointed out, is amazingly anoying in how it becomes far louder than it needs to be during crucial moments in the film.  The ending is poorly thought-out as well. It comes from out of no where, and isn't very creative or satisfying.  If you have 90 minutes to waste, do it with a better movie than this.",1366675200,7,524,4.252525252525253

8142719,4,B000I0QLSM,I really liked this movie. It had a good plot and decent acting from the classic stuffy old guy to the beautiful woman. I must say that I did not enjoy the music though.
