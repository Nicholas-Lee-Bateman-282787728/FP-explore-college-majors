2107488,5,B0002NY84E,"Although I am not a fan of Rowan Atkinson in person, the animated Bean cartoons are great favorites in my house.

PROS:
- Soundtrack - no shouting, bragging, trash-talking, put-downs, blaring music, etc - just low-key music, acceptable levels of sound effects, and a bit of speech! (MUCH preferable to YuGiOh!)
- Humo(u)r - some sight gags, some sophisticated jokes take time to develop, minimal potty stuff, enjoyable prudery.
- Sex - we enjoy how Bean is at the same stage with relationships as my boys (girls are appealing in ways, but mainly a bit icky/scary and boring).
- Low-key - kids don't watch this and come out all wound-up!
- Exposure to something other than US culture.
- Bean loves his Teddy just like my eldest son loves his Bear!
- Values - Bean is generally respectful of animals...
- Stories are short, but not too short (require some attention span).

CONS:
- Big bazoombas on some women, a little sexual innuendo - but really not too bad.
- A fair amount of indifference to the problems he causes store clerks, etc...

We have all three box sets, and recommend them highly to all who will listen. I consider them appropriate for kids probably ages 6-7 and up (depends on kid's development). For younger kids, get Kipper and Little Bear videos.",1265414400,2,1264,4.684684684684685
2107489,5,B0002NY84E,"The whole series certainly did not disappoint. The kids and I love every episodes and wish there were more. However, I'm sure we will revisit the whole series again and again.

The only thing that was annoying was the inability to select all episodes to play in one hit. Instead, we have to play 2 titles at a time from each DVD which is somewhat of an inconvenient.

Nonetheless, we will definitely buy more if more are available!",1243296000,,431,4.512820512820513
2107490,5,B0002NY84E,My six year old and I LOVE MR. BEAN!!  It's totally laugh out loud funny!!  Wish they'd make more of the animated series!,1240185600,,121,4.217391304347826
2107491,5,B0002NY84E,"I bought the complete cartoon series for my kids after having seen the story with the fly in his bedroom, on tv. I didn't expect to enjoy the cartoon that much. When I got them, I couldn't stop watching. amazing!!! I admired how they could really transform the real mr. bean in cartoons, his mimics, his way of moving around, or driving around... the stories are hilarious, not too long, and cool. not only for kids, but for adults too. have a nice good laugh",1226966400,,459,4.411764705882353
2107492,5,B0002NY84E,"We have the entire set, all six volumes.

We have two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old. Our kids love these DVDs. The series is family-friendly and I like the fact that I don't have to suffer through an hour of ""I wants"" following a Saturday morning cartoon fest chock full of commercials.

If you have young children, this is a great buy because the individual stories run about 5-8 minutes each. You can moderate how much they watch without having to commit to a 90-minute Disney movie.

There are three sets of DVDs, each two volumes in length. The double sets are better priced than buying each volume individually. Check out my other Amazon review of the Mr. Bean animated series.",1216425600,,688,4.532258064516129
2107493,5,B0002NY84E,"If you're a fan of the original Mister Bean series, the final cartoon of this set makes the whole thing worthwhile, as it answers a long standing question about just where the heck Bean comes from.
The whole animated series is great, however, and if you like Bean, buy the animated series.",1209254400,,289,4.576923076923077

8029687,5,B0002NY84E,"My children adore this cartoon.  I have never been a fan of Mr. Bean myself.  He tends to gross me out.  I do not have that reaction to the cartoon in any capacity.  It is similar in style to the live action show, but animation is a much more comfortable medium for this sense of humor.  The animation is also adorably done and the story lines quite funny.  We have been watching this animated series for years and my children never seem to tire of it.",1416787200,,452,4.1976744186046515
