8368578,5,B002EZLOPY,"These are good copies of three good films by Jorge Negrete. They are obviously not remastered or restored, and they do not include subtitles. They were very good for the price I paid, but the pricing is volatile. If you are a Jose Negrete fan, you will enjoy these, and I'm not sure there are any plans to reissue better quality versions of his films.",1366243200,2,351,4.415384615384616
