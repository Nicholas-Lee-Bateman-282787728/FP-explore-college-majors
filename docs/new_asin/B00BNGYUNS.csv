8571622,3,B00BNGYUNS,"I bought this movie thinking it was a compilation of performances art Glastonbury when in fact it is a documentary of what the people do at the festival very little musical performances, I am disappointed because I was hoping it was more about the musicians! so if you were thinking about buying it for any musical performances don't waste your money!",1374192000,8,351,4.770491803278689
8571623,5,B00BNGYUNS,"In addition to some classic performances, ""Glastonbury:In Flashback"" gives the viewer a glimpse into what it's like to attend the Glastonbury Festival. Throughout the performances concertgoers are followed over the 3 days. My favorite storyline was ""Charlie the Drummer"" a struggling musician trying to get noticed while having a good time. A must for not only fans of 90s music, but music fans in general!",1373932800,,406,5.2615384615384615
8571624,3,B00BNGYUNS,"The box lists the audio as dts-HD Master Audio, but it's only regular lossy DTS, DVD quality. I will edit my review later when I check whether it's 1/2 bit-rate or not. There are no extras supported here. Watching ""Gravity Grave"" by The Verve, which was a terrific performance and it's a shame it wasn't presented in full, shows the poorer video sections of this movie, it's not even presented in anamorphic so you have to either zoom or just deal with the inferior choice of presenting this video source. There are other video-sourced presentations like Dire Straits' ""Alchemy"" on Blu-ray which use the full range of picture available (it's 4:3 but it still fills your screen from top to bottom with the 4:3 bars on the side) so I don't see any reason for this to have happened.

The vast majority of the festival footage does look great in high definition, and I would rate that 4/5 easily, but the other footage brings it down.

I'm not thrilled that I upgraded my DVD to this as the performance footage was the primary reasons for picking this up, but if the festival footage is what you're looking for then I believe you'll enjoy the improvements this Blu-ray offers. Shame the audio spec isn't as advertised. Still it was pretty cheap so I'm not much out of pocket.

It's a shame they don't include the bonus performances on this Blu-ray, I guess you can also buy the 4-disc set that's coming out on July 15th, 2013 in the UK to get the full performances of Gravity Grave and Make It Till Monday from The Verve as well as the following tracks on DISC 2:

Shame they didn't get the full Verve set on there with the other full gigs they're presenting, but the 4-disc DVD set definitely looks like the better option to me.",1373414400,,2826,4.788819875776397
