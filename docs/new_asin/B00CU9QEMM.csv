8586506,5,B00CU9QEMM,Kamel DVD on French Boxing aka Boxe Francaise or Savate in the earlier days is very well done.  The drills are well explained at various speeds.  BF requires a lot of flexibility as you are literally boxing with your feet.  Highly recommend it for any martial arts enthusiasts...,1423872000,4,279,4.770833333333333
