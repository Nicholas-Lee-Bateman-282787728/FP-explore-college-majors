5726749,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Finding Dory takes place 1 year after the events of Finding Nemo (2003). It surround the life of Dory, and she tries to remember her family and what happened to them. Along the way, she meets Hank, an octopus who doesn't like humans since one of them make him lose a tentacle. Pixar did a wonderful job with Hank, being that he can camouflage, and is also translucent. Overall, this movie is saddening at times, but there is a happy ending.",1527811200,,440,4.444444444444445

5726755,1,B00CMHL3GY,I bought this dvd on Amazon last year and showed it to my class.  It kept stopping. I returned it and a replacement was sent.

This happened with another dvd I purchased through Amazon so I'm afraid of using Amazon for purchasing movies anymore.,1526860800,,407,4.5479452054794525

5726801,3,B00CMHL3GY,"I must say I was captivated by Finding Nemo. This one, not so much. May be among the minority here found it a bit tedious. Perhaps the novelty of the first film had worn off. But wanted it to be over before the final act. Visually probably just as good as Nemo but found story lacking. Think Dory makes a better supporting player than a primary one.",1518998400,,349,4.223880597014926

5726837,5,B00CMHL3GY,"This was a very cute movie.  Dory begins to remember her past and sets out to find her parents.  It moved swiftly and, for us, it didn't bog down in the middle but kept on moving.  Dory figures her way out of several situations, and I think that there's a good lesson there for kids.  If one way doesn't work, find another way.  Good ending, and I would recommend this to anyone with small kids.  Or just anyone who is still a kid at heart.",1512691200,,440,4.117647058823529

5726870,5,B00CMHL3GY,"They never did find Dory. Some say they're still looking. I was knew a girl named Dory. Well, young woman. She had a completely relatively normal first name until 2001 came around and Finding Nemo came out. Then Dory became a household name and every basically terrorized her for having the same name as the forgetful fish. She owned that name though. Every time she introduced herself, she'd say Hi, I'm Dory and in the same voice Ellen Degeneres used. I'm positive she has this movie poster framed in her house. She never let the name of Dory get to her and the nearly endless references to the movie. I respect her for that. This movie is great. I know some people panned it and were critical of it. I'm not entirely certain why. For me it's Hank the septopus. Not an octopus. His cantankerous nature paired with Ed O'Neill (of Modern Family and Married with Children fame) cranky old man voice is a perfect compliment to Dory's upbeat, positive nature. Terrific.",1506556800,,966,4.622093023255814

Nemo,Marlin, the entire animated cast are back!!
This movie is thought provoking,heart warming ,Humorous and very entertaining. Each character has distinct personality traits which bring forth the best of the movie and The plot was touching/realistic. It has bold color, flawless animation ,Comedy , drama, action, kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was next. This is a family orientated movie and it has Familiar characters from last movie!! ""noggin, dude.."" lol. Finding Dory lacks in replay value meaning Its not exactly the kind of movie i would want to watch over and over again.
the movie seemed very long but its a Must See Movie!! Its great for the family and frankly people of all ages. You will fall in love with these colorful little fish all over again and gain a new appreciation for marine life. Packed with life lessons ,catchy tunes and sayings which will boost any one's self-esteem, your funny bone will be tickled. Never give up! Just keep swimming",1498867200,,1019,4.895953757225434

Although all my nephews (ages between 7 and 3) liked the movie, this isn't one they ask to rewatch...in fact when given the option recently they asked to rewatch Nemo instead of Dory. I don't think any of them have rewatched Dory since we saw it at the theater and they weren't as talkative about it as they usually are about other movies. And these are the same kids who have rewatched other Disney and Pixar movies many times.
My nieces aren't old enough to have watched it yet so I'm not sure how they're going to feel about it.

5727081,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Back to the pond for Pixar, where we find things largely unchanged from the end of 2003's Finding Nemo. As the continually-forgetful blue tang Dory has a sudden enduring flash of her childhood, a rush of recall, she gathers the clownfish for one more globe-spanning adventure. The setup is a little soft, lingering too long in the shadow of the first film, but eventually we break free of that sentiment and forge a new (if similar) identity for the sequel. The closed-in landscape of an aquatic themed zoo/amusement park feels a bit claustrophobic at first glance, but as hijinx ensue and we learn more of Dory's early years, it all fleshes out nicely. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist ""septipus"" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. O'Neill brings his usual disgruntled pessimism to the role, though, and some genuinely clever sight gags using the creature's natural assets go a long way to smoothing that over. He's overly convenient, but we're always glad to see him again. Witty and fast-paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. I laughed, I misted up, but I never quite fooled myself into thinking it was superior to the first.",1492560000,,1388,4.836134453781512

5727092,4,B00CMHL3GY,"""Finding Dory"" should not be confused as a sequel to ""Finding Nemo"" though they are, of course, connected and this movie does take place chronologically after the events in ""Finding Nemo"".  Dory is its own tail (yep, spelled incorrectly on purpose) and can stand on its own without the connection to Nemo.  Dory follows the baffled, memory challenged eponymous blue dory fish that Marlin first met on his voyage to save his son Nemo.  Dory has found a family and made a home with Marlin and Nemo and they are looking out for her.  As she has a new home and a new community her fragmented memory starts to come back and she remembers her original ma and pa and goes in search of her parents.  Her search leads her to Morro Bay in California to a Marine Life Institute/ public aquarium where she had grown up.  She reunites with old friends and makes a few new ones including Hank the always escaping octopus.  Hank is a real treat as he's acerbic but also ridiculously creative.  He's like a chameleonic ninja and his clever tricks give this film for a few moments almost a feel of a movie like ""The Great Escape"" where war prisoners are creating clever ways to bugging out of their compound.

Marlin and Nemo mount a rescue mission and Marlin and Dory are inevitably thrown together again.  Dory has a message of holding onto family and fighting for your dreams and for recognizing that everyone has their own individual strengths even amidst their limitations.  It is fun and funny and warm-hearted, though it is the inferior movie to ""Finding Nemo"" mostly because it follows Nemo's plot devices a little too closely.  Sure ""Finding Dory"" can stand on its own because you can watch and enjoy it and get it without ever having seen ""Finding Nemo"" but do yourself a favor and watch ""Finding Nemo"" as its story is tighter and cleaner and maintains a tighter focus on its characters.  Side characters in ""Finding Dory"" feel like they've been placed there to simply add lovable and/or odd side characters whereas the ones in ""Finding Nemo"" lent themselves to the forward momentum of the story.  Still, fun and worthwhile movie!",1492300800,,2123,4.672043010752688

5727111,5,B00CMHL3GY,"I liked ""Finding Dory"" better than ""Finding Nemo."" I realize this is a controversial opinion, but let me explain. First of all: the production value of both meet the same level of excellence. Now, the story in ""Nemo"" is more compelling and the pacing is better, due in part to the grand scale of the setting; in ""Nemo,"" the majority of the film takes place all across the ocean, while ""Dory"" is, for the most part, confined to a small space.

Here's the thing. I am mentally ill. It is a chronic, progressive illness, and it affects me both cognitively and emotionally. I never see movies where a character--let alone a loveable main character--is cognitively impaired, or disabled, and did not spend the entirety of the movie being so brave for dealing with their disability, or being reduced to a tragic character. The people around Dory, too, aren't portrayed as brave or burdened by her condition, either. They make concessions for her, but they're only finding ways to interact with her that will keep her safe and happy without babying her. I am getting sicker. It has become evident that I may become so ill that I will not be able to live alone. Dory cannot live alone; she needs the people who love her to help her. But they don't mind. They don't suffer. They remodel their lives to fit her into it, and they do it because they love her. I cannot express how seeing this in media made me feel. Like my illness didn't mean that I was wrong, just different. That I wasn't a burden on the people around me; they change their lives for me the way I change my life for them, and for the same reason--because that's what you do for people you love.

5727112,3,B00CMHL3GY,"I wasn't all that impressed by this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely watchable and it does have its funny moments. I just didn't find it to be anything special. I didn't think Finding Nemo was anything all that special either, so that could be why i didn't love this movie either. Nemo also had its funny moments, but it wasn't a movie that really stuck with me or made me love it. If you were a huge fan of Nemo then I think you will definitely love this one as well. Generally speaking, I love Pixar movies, but this one was just a bit of a miss for me.",1491609600,,565,4.099099099099099

Finding Nemo had a lot of emotion and heart in it and it was at its heart a story of a father trying to find his son and trying to reconnect not just physically but emotionally.

To a 5 yr old, assigning a DVD to the category of ""DVD to be watched while riding in the car"" is the highest praise. Very few of her movies interest me enough to watch them on my own, because 49 yr old men and 5 yr old girls have little in common. This one was different for some reason. I found myself watching it without her more than once.

I was at first skeptical of whether I should watch it enough but fairly I can say it lived up to it's hype. This movie had a mutual collaborative combination of laughter, sadness, and curiosity. For the most part, it was humorous through most of the movie as Dory fights her memory loss to find her long lost parents that she'd ventured away from as a small child. In my opinion, the metaphorical meaning of this movie is that despite dory's mental disability and what others think shes capable of, Dory still believed in herself and never stopped believing. As the audience we can apply that to our everyday lives. When people give up on you or show you no hope, keep believing in yourself and fight towards your goal whatever that may be in your life. People may look at this film as just a child's movie but it is strongly significant to all beings no matter who you are.",1488412800,,1180,5.248677248677248

The movie is a good movie for older kids, in my opinion maybe moreso for little girls.  It does a  lot of talking about emotions and doesn't have a lot of action.  It might grow on you but initially this is not a very exciting movie to watch",1488153600,,487,4.08421052631579

5727286,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Newly released to Netflix, Pixars Finding Dory, had people of all ages excited to watch the sequel to Finding Nemo. As Finding Dory was released about 13 years after Finding Nemo, the audience of the film was a wide variety. The main audience was young children, but also there were many kids who were older, the Finding Nemo generation, who were dying to see the film. Like Finding Nemo, Finding Dory has the same main themes: friendship, family, trust, diversity, and neurodiversity. Pixar does a great job catching the audience and pulling them into the adventure of Dory as she searches for her family.
 The movie starts off with a scene from Finding Nemo with Dory, Nemo, and Marlin, the fish are talking about families and Dory suddenly remembers that she does not remember who her family is. Then the movie jumps to one year later. Dory, Nemo, and Marlin are swimming near the undertow and Dory gets sucked away. Nemo and Marlin follow her and end up swimming near The Marline Life Institute, which accidently finds herself in. She meets many different fish and aquatic life and asks them to help her find her family. The task becomes difficult because Dory suffers from short-term memory loss, which makes her experience a lot of dj vu and that makes it really complex for her to tell others what she is trying to do. Dory meets an octopus who is missing one of his tentacles named Hank. Hank helps Dory search for her family, and they meet many other aquatic animals along the way on their search to find Dorys family.
 The biggest theme in Finding Dory is about individuals with disabilities. In Finding Dory, Nemo and Dory relate to each other because they have disabilities, but now in Finding Dory there are many more character with a large variety of disabilities. Dory has short-term memory loss, a condition that makes the task of finding her parents much more difficult to complete. You see in the movie that the other characters sometimes get annoyed with Dory and how she fails to remember certain things, but they understand that it is not her fault and that she cant help it. Nemo was born with a small fin which makes it hard for him to keep up when swimming around with other fish. And then we have Hank. Hank is an octopus, who only has 7 tentacles, so Dory calls him a septapus. There are also some manatees, sharks, and whales who have disabilities that are in the movie, which makes you realize that individuals with disabilities are just like everyone else around them. The movie teaches the audience that don't determine who someone is, and that it is okay to be different.
 The animators make their opinions of aquariums very subtle in their animations. The fish and scenery are drawn out differently when they are in the aquarium compared to when they are in the ocean. When the scenes are in the ocean, the waters are crystal clear, but then when the scenes are in the tanks in the aquarium, the waters are very murky and have a brownish tint to them, it is clear to see that they are not as clean as the ocean water. Also, the workers at the aquarium look angry and look like they do not like their job. This adds to the movie that marine life is meant in the wild, and not in an aquarium.
Although Finding Dory is a childrens movie made by Disney, there are many life lessons that can be learned while watching the movie. If you pay attention very closely to the movie you can find many hidden meanings and lessons.",1487721600,,3449,4.559677419354839

5727328,3,B00CMHL3GY,"Finding Dory was adorable.  Lets get that out of the way.  It was fun, bright, cute, inventivebut it wasn't a very good MOVIE.  It was a series of animated shorts and action pieces they wanted to do loosely hung on a plot that wasn't told particularly well.  You see, an animated short can be bright, cute, and fun just to be bright, cute, and fun.  Characters do things and nothing really has to come of it.  No one needs to have an arc necessarily, especially if you're using established characters.  But an adventure kids MOVIE needs a story, with a personal arc for the characters.  Something has to be changed about them by the end, on the INSIDE, as a person.  In Finding Nemo, Nemo overcomes his disabilities.  Marlin learns to let go of fear and worry.  Dory learns to remember things and finds a loving home, no longer wandering alone.  These are arcs.  In Finding Dory, Nemo constantly tells his dad hes a failure, Marlin is a dismissive jerk, and Dory is cute and random.  None of this changes by the end.  You could say Marlin learns to accept Dory as family, but he already did that at the beginning.  The biggest arc in the movie is that at the end someone DOESNT go to Cleveland.

In Finding Nemo there were lessons to be learned, the audience goes away encouraged by something.  Dont be guided by fear.  Sometimes your parents are right.  Your disabilities cant stop you from success.  The world is big and adventure is everywhere.

In Finding Dory the lesson to be learned seemed to be ADD is great, so do the first random thing you think of and life will be awesome.  Or, Parents love their kids?  I guess that was a lesson?

Sprinkled throughout the movie there are sweet heartstring moments where characters give emotional or inspiring speeches, but theres no real heart to any of it.  In fact, there are so many speeches and monologues in this movie and so many set pieces, with so little done to earn them that it made me wonder if this director misunderstood what made Finding Nemo resonate so much with audiences in the first place.  You see, it wasn't the just wacky adventures, those were merely action pieces to get us from A to B and provide some intensity or levity.  It was the characters and the journey of self that mattered.  The heart and humanity.  The way these characters grew and felt, being brought to us in a way that made us root for them and feel what they felt, because we truly CARED about them.  And I would trade every single speech or forced sentimental moment in Finding Dory for the one moment in Finding Nemo when Dory cries, When I look at youIm home.

In Finding Nemo they had the entire ocean to traverse, facing all the dangers therein.  In Finding Dory they just cross the ocean with no troubles whatsoever, in about two minutes, recycling jokes from the first movie the whole way.  No big deal.  That giant expanse of watery danger we spent a whole movie on before?  No worries now, I guess.  And then they get to an aquatic institute where they hope to find Dorys parents, and wackiness ensues.  With no real dangers.  No real emotional impact.  Stuff happens.  And then, SPOILER ALERT, Dory Finds her parents and its sweet.

And get used to those recycled jokes, folks.  Theres a lot of them.

In all, this movie was a bright, cute, inventive series of actions.  I didn't hate it by any means, I thought it was fun enough.  But if I hadnt already had the first movie to make me care about these characters Id never have really gotten anything out of the film.  Its missing nearly every story telling element that made the first one so impactful.  Its just kind ofOK.

About the short at the beginning, Piper.

It was cute at first, but then it took a disturbing turn for me.  The little bird tries to get food, faces dangers, overcomes its fears, learns a new way of doing things that makes everyone happy, and its great.  In fact, theres more of a character arc in the short than in Finding Dory.  But something stuck in my head and made the short really creepy for me.

You see, when one adorable creature does something it might be cute.  The little bird eating a tiny clamcute.  A swarm of birds shredding a large clam like a school of sharksdisturbing.  You see, this takes place in the Finding Nemo universe where all sea creatures are anthropomorphic.  You can tell that from the hermit crab the little bird makes friends with.  And in Finding Dory we see that clams and oysters can talk, have personalities, etc.  They are sentient creatures.  In Finding Nemo the only time a creature or group of creatures devours another it is a frightening, horrible experience for our little fishy heroes.  Now look at Piper.  By the end there is a literal feeding frenzy where masses of birds tear apart sea creatures together like piranha.  Using the emotional connections they built in the first movie this comes across just terrifying or nauseating.  You can almost hear the poor creatures screams.

The friendly creature or group of creatures turning bad is a long standing trope in films.  And when theres more than one of them working together to devour someone else, it is always meant to be frightening.  Galaxy Quest and the minor/miners.  The pterodactyls and the raccoon in Good Dinosaur.  The mogwai turning on Gizmo and becoming gremlins.  The list goes on.  So when the little bird in Piper eats a clam, it can be cute.  You can dismiss the anthropomorphism of the creatures.  When he encourages his pals to shred a larger animal together like jackals, it gets a bit less cute.  And then when following that logic, to see the little bird literally sleeping on the corpses of his victims at the end, thats just creepy.",1487203200,,5685,4.549950544015826

But it wasn't until after we got the movie on disc and I watched it a couple more times that I really started enjoying it fully.  The story includes some old friends and new ones.  I particularly like the beluga.  I also like the thinly veiled appearance of the Monterey Bay Aquarium - one of my favorite places!

The DVD/Blue Ray/Digital HD combo is also a major plus.  I like having all of these options.

As usual, PIXAR provides the storyline, characters and visual quality we've come to expect.

5727390,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Its tough to look at the endlessly expanding CG animated film realm and wonder just how different a landscape it would be today if its founding father happened to be anyone other than Pixar.  Coming (exploding) onto the scene with a succession of blockbuster films and an uncanny knack for making all the right moves, truly its impossible to overstate their influence on the field.

The trouble is, and as is so often the case, the competition has been steadily improving and while suggesting theyve ever made a poor movie is certainly exaggerating, the sheer brilliance Pixar had once been known for has become a bit more hit or miss throughout the years.

It comes as no surprise, then, that most of their effort in recent years hasn't been to forge new ground so much as its been furthering the worlds collective time spent with the host of endearing characters theyve introduced us to all those years ago; be they Mike and Sully, Woody and Buzz, Lightning McQueen and of course Nemo and Dory.

Released theatrically in the United States June 17th, 2016 (thirteen years after the original Finding Nemo), Finding Dory immediately proved that unlike the titular character, the world at large hadnt forgotten.  It rocketed its $200-mill budget to grossing over a staggering $1 billion worldwide, becoming the first Pixar film to cross the mark since 2010's Toy Story 3 and broke numerous records along the way, including the highest-grossing animated film opening of all time in North America.

The story here, much like the first one, cant exactly be described as oceanic-deep but what it lacks in plot layers, it makes up for in well realized characters and impeccable delivery.

Taking place a year after the events of Finding Nemo, Finding Dory once again builds upon the tried and true seek/ search formula.  Only this time rather than a parent casing down the trail of his abducted child, we follow the child (Dory) in her effort to track down her parents.  Their whereabouts and reason for separation isn't nearly as plainly presented as Nemos but the piece wastes little time trying to hide its intentions.  Rather, it gets underway fairly quickly and manages to fill its 98-minue run-time without relying upon cliche jokes or filler.

The plot here is more about the characters well meet along the way and while it begins by revisiting several of the gags from the first film (the manta ray teacher and his class, the burned out but good hearted surfing sea-turtles etc.), this one finds its own rhythm within the first half hour and never looks back.

Coming in, I really expected Pixar to have its proverbial hands full with trying to entice an audience of viewers who have been wowed to the gills (pardon the pun) visually throughout the years with what can be accomplished in the medium of CG but the veteran company sidestepped such concerns with ease.  After all, when Finding Nemo came out back in 2003, the charm and capability of this new animated medium for storytelling were yet in their infancy.  Each time Pixar took us to one of their worlds, it was the first time anyone had seen anything like it. Not only has Finding Nemo already awed us with what a beautifully rendered CG ocean could be all about, dozens of other studios have followed suit in the decade-and-a-half since.

No, Finding Dory would have to stand or fall on merit of its storytelling and characterization alone.  In this regard, Pixar not only proves it understands such realities, it rises to the challenge of reminding the world that story is what they do best.

So that means the film is perfect, then?  While undeniably solid, it isn't without its peccadilloes.  The pacing isn't quite the razor-sharp package weve been getting from the likes of DreamWorks of late and tends to bog down a bit, especially with a multitude of Dory being reunited scenes.  Additionally, some of the lessons presented are a bit heavy-handed; with humanity often posing the greatest danger to aquatic life, even over multitudes of natural predators and environments encountered along the way.  In all, minor complaints and surely ones that will be more forgivable for the younger audiences Disney is targeting with the film.

All in all Pixar proves to us yet again that its very unwise to doubt the companys mastery over the genre they created.  Fickle fans are often quick to write them off after releases like Brave or The Good Dinosaur, which attempt to forge a new tangent in an industry that is forever being splintered into sub-categories.  Then, just as quickly, Pixar revisits its roots and silences its skeptics with rich, character-driven story.

That such praise can be heaped upon any studio upon reviewing its seventeenth feature film accordingly is a testament to staying power that can only be achieved by understanding their audience, adapting with the times and doing what theyve always done best: Setting the stage for their characters so that the timelessness of human emotion can steal the show.",1486512000,,4991,4.87810650887574

Dory was amiable in the original ""Finding Nemo"" film.  But in my opinion, she didn't have enough depth to support the plot of an entire movie.  The constant forgetfulness also got old VERY fast.",1485388800,,304,4.574074074074074

5727615,5,B00CMHL3GY,"This became my daughters favorite movie. I was half tempted to take a star off for the # of times I've heard her say ""Daddy, Dory please!"", but it was cute, and I love her, so I'm not going to hold that against you.

This is similar to Finding Nemo, but I thought it was less scary and the emotions were a lot more complicated. I think that kids will enjoy it and find it visually appealing, but they might not fully understand the real beauty of the movie for years to come. And thats okay.

I bought the movie (vs renting) because I feel it will be something we continue to watch for years to come. I hope you'll feel the same, because it's a pretty cool movie.",1485302400,,663,4.131782945736434

5727896,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Finding Dory revisits the world of Finding Nemo - a film that doesn't require or need a sequel, but got one anyway. Pixar has an interesting habit of releasing sequels/prequels/follow-ups to films that don't really need them (Toy Story, Cars, Monsters Inc) while ignoring the films that would really benefit from them (The Incredibles). Thankfully, Pixar's track record is stellar and really speaks for itself. While Cars 2 was okay, Monsters University fun and more than adequate, Toy Story 2 and 3 just improved the same recycled formula with every entry. When you look at Finding Nemo - a story whose title LITERALLY explains the entire plot - it seems a follow-up with the same plot would be destined to do nothing more than re-hash jokes from the first film without giving any new punch lines.

Thankfully, Finding Dory is an example of an intelligent sequel that doesn't need to re-hash material from the first film to find a successful formula. While there are vignettes from Finding Nemo we revisit - returning characters, speaking whale, the ever-repeating memory jokes - they never feel forced or out of place. Better yet, the short term memory loss jokes land every time, even the second, third, and fourth times around.

It's surprising and shocking how Pixar manages to revisit their material with such ease while still making it feel fresh like we've never seen it before. Even though it's been several years since Nemo swam away, Finding Dory is as accessible to new audiences as it is to audiences incredibly familiar with Finding Nemo. Disney/Pixar delivers another endearing, entertaining film full of characters children will enjoy, jokes both young and old will laugh at, with themes and messages that remain relevant with audiences for years to come.",1484179200,,1771,5.020408163265306

5727902,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Pixar seems to be on a mission to sequel-ize many of its most beloved films.  ""Toy Story"" has already become a franchise of its own, with three movies and a fourth on the way, and ""Cars"" has not only spawned a sequel (with another on the way) and the spinoff series ""Planes,"" but ""Monsters Inc."" got its own prequel, and apparently a sequel to ""The Incredibles"" is on its way.  I'm not sure how I feel about all this franchise-ing of Pixar's movies, as I feel many of them stood well on their own and didn't necessarily NEED sequels.  Still, while some of these sequels have fallen flat for me (""Cars 2"" was a weird out-of-genre experience, and ""Monsters University"" was just blah), Pixar has a good enough track record that I have faith in most of their output, and the ""Toy Story"" trilogy turned out strong enough that I approached ""Finding Dory"" with cautious optimism.  ""Finding Nemo"" was a wonderful classic, and I could only wonder just how a sequel would turn out.

Not bad at all, it seems.  While not quite as charming as the first film, ""Finding Dory"" retains much of the humor and heart that made the first film resonate with viewers, and it explores one of the most popular characters in the first film with surprising pathos.

""Finding Dory"" takes place a year after the events of ""Finding Nemo,"" with Dory now living on the coral reef with Marlin and Nemo, next door to their anemone home.  But her newfound life is shattered when an innocent comment jogs her faulty memory... and she remembers that she was looking for her parents, whom she was separated from as a child, when she ran into Marlin and joined in his quest.  With the neurotic Marlin and snarky but still-adorable Nemo in tow, Dory sets off to find her own family, only to be separated from them and end up in a marine wildlife rescue center.  Now Dory finds herself on a tank-hopping journey to find her long-lost family, aided along the way by a fugitive octopus named Hank, a near-sighted but good-natured whale shark named Destiny, and a beluga whale named Bailey who's lost his echolocation abilities.  And along the way, Dory learns some surprising things about herself and her own abilities... and just where said abilities came from.

As to be expected from a Pixar production, the animation in this film is superb.  The aquatic environments, whether they be open ocean or a grungy bay or an indoor aquarium, are fantastically rendered, and careful attention has gone into the movements of water and the no-doubt-complicated issue of underwater lighting.  The sea animals are well done as well -- just as with ""Finding Nemo,"" Pixar maintains a nice balance between realism and style, making the characters just cartoony enough to be visually appealing but still staying mostly scientifically accurate.  I say ""mostly"" because human eyes on a fish or octopus might fall into uncanny valley for some viewers.  And I'd nitpick that fish don't have eyelids, but I do understand that leaving eyelids out might have caused issues -- how creepy would the movie have gotten if the characters never blinked?

The movie fits nicely in with the original as well, giving explanations for some of Dory's quirks and mannerisms (her ability to read, her knowledge of whale language, even her ""just keep swimming"" mantra) without causing continuity issues with the first film.  Its story doesn't have quite the epic stakes of the first, but still manages to keep one's attention throughout.  It doesn't have quite the same amount of heart and charm that made the first a winner, and the new characters of Bailey and Destiny aren't as memorable as I had hoped, but other newcomer characters (Hank, Becky the loon, the trio of lazy sea lions -- one of whom is voiced by Idris Elba of all people!) stand out well and make fun additions to the cast.  Even the original Tank Gang makes an appearance, albeit in an after-credits stinger.

In addition to the main feature, the DVD of this movie contains an ocean-themed short film, ""Piper.""  Entirely wordless and just as wonderfully animated as the main movie, it's an adorable short that makes a perfect accompaniment, whether you watch it before or after the main film.

While not quite as strong as the original, ""Finding Dory"" is still one of Pixar's best sequels, behind only to the second and third ""Toy Story"" movies.  It still elicits giggles and cheers while pulling at the heartstrings, and still packs Pixar's always-phenomenal animation and pairs it with a good story in the bargain.  It's a hit, and after the disappointment of ""The Good Dinosaur,"" it's nice to see Pixar getting back into their game.  Now to see how they manage with ""Cars 3"" and the second ""Incredibles"" movie, I suppose...",1484179200,,4720,4.767813267813268

The focus of memory loss and losing family was a hook but from what happens from there and all the little characters which come in especially the great looking octopus character...a lot more could have been built into this story as was done inf Finding Nemo.

This is a really entertaining movie and Disney does it again in instilling your child(ren) with the importance of loving others, sacrificial love, commitment, and loving someone unconditionally.  As with all Disney films, these love lessons are done in a world where God is not mentioned. The only improvement I could imagine would be to tie why we love others to the love we share from and with God.

5728208,5,B00CMHL3GY,Great movie,1483401600,,11,5.0
5728209,5,B00CMHL3GY,"We have always loved Finding Nemo, so my boys and I were very excited to see this movie. Oh my goodness. It was so great. They couldn't stop laughing, I couldn't stop crying. I tried not to let them see it, but there were so many themes in this movie about accepting one another and our differences and quirks and the little annoying things that we do in our families. About never giving up on each other. About love. It was a beautiful, wonderful movie.

This movie centered around Dory, as the title suggests. If you know anything about the Nemo world, you know that Dory is a fish who suffers from short term memory loss. Its unclear why, but at times this short term memory loss is pretty humorous. In Finding Dory, however, the loss was a little more serious and sad. We find out that Dory lost her parents. And she tries to find them again, which sets her and Marlin and Nemo on an adventure to a place they've never known.

Of course, while Dory is in this place, she leaves her mark. Even though she cant remember things, Dory is one of the most inspirational characters in the Nemo world. She encourages people to become better, braver, more engaged with the world at hand. We see this in Marlin, who braves quite an adventure of his own to try to find Dory. We see this in a new character, a red octopus who breaks out of his cage and chooses to be brave in spite of what it may cost him. We see it in a near-sighted whale, who was friends with Dory when they were kids.

At the heart of Finding Dory is a message about accepting the quirks in the people you love. At times, Marlin would get annoyed that Dory was so forgetful. But by the end of the movie, that annoyance had turned to gratefulness. Because without her forgetfulness, Dory would not be Dory. She would not take the risks she took and encourage others to do the same. She would be, somehow, smaller. Her mark on the world would be limited.
It was a beautiful message. As a parent, I sat there looking at my boys, from one to another, thinking about all their annoying little habits and behavior and personality quirks. I remembered, in the aftermath of Finding Dory, that these are precisely the things that endear them to me. Without them, they would not be them.",1483401600,,2240,4.366906474820144

5728317,1,B00CMHL3GY,"I have to be honest. I couldn't even make it past the first 30 minutes. Wow! This movie was a terrible waste of funds. It is so obvious that Disney's is completely incapable of recreating or even resembling the ingenuity, brilliance, and talent that was Pixar and was evident in the first film, Finding Nemo. Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave right now, I'm sure. The utter lack of storyline, flimsy dialog, and failure to hook you in make this a weak film. (pun intended) Sorry, it's a bad movie so I have to use a bad pun. I feel a bit bad for ripping what is essentially a children's animation, however, I felt it must be done because viewers like me who are not children and loved the first film, may get fooled into paying for and watching this one. My advice is to save your hard earned money. Even your children will wander from the screen out of boredom or annoyance for the main character, Dory who has short term memory loss and forgets everything after a few seconds. Watching the fish forget everything she says every few seconds becomes excruciatingly painful, believe me. Just like the character, Dory, you will basically need a lobotomy to enjoy this film.",1483315200,5,1172,4.533018867924528

5728338,4,B00CMHL3GY,"I like it. But... it's depressing. It's also a bit clunky, as if the writers thought of a lot of cool scenes, and then tried to tie them together into a strong to make a movie. It's fun to watch, but although kids probably follow it just fine, adults will most likely think it's a bit jarring to switch from doing one thing to something different without much transition or logic.",1483315200,,380,4.366197183098592

I honestly did not know that the voice behind Dory was Ellen DeGeneres. Thumbs up to all the cast and people behind this wonderful movie.

5728351,4,B00CMHL3GY,"There are plenty of reviews of the movie itself here.  I want to talk about the quality of the 3D and bonus features.

Finding Nemo is one of my prettier 3D discs, and Dory doesn't disappoint either.  Again, like having a 42"" window into the ocean.  And unlike some ""3D"" films (I'm looking at YOU, Star Trek Beyond), it doesn't start with a bang and then forget it's supposed to be 3D until the credits (although the credits, like in all 3D films I've noticed, are probably the most visually spectacular part.  I don't know why studios seem to put the bulk of their energy into making them look better than the rest of the film).

The bonus disc isn't that thrilling, and nearly a complete waste of time (and whatever you do, avoid the ""living aquariums"" section -- basically screensavers that are impossible to exit out of without stopping the whole disc).  The features on the Blu-ray (and presumably DVD) feature discs are a different story.  Here's the meat of the ""making of"" (combined with the film commentary), and as usual I'm always astonished at how much thought and work go into the deceptively simplest of scenes.  Very, very interesting stuff (as well as some whimsical but amusing material, like the director driving his cast into work and trying to pick up Ed O'Neill).  (But if you're like me and afraid to miss out on features but always looking to save a few bucks, again, if you find a set on eBay or something that's only missing the bonus feature disc, you really aren't missing much without it).

In summary, the 3D is worth it if you're into that.  But I wish there was a way to get not so many discs (I probably will never need the DVD, for instance) for a little less money.",1483228800,,1699,4.498371335504886

5728362,5,B00CMHL3GY,Both Finding Dory and Finding Nemo are very well done and very entertaining. Very wholesome.  Some how I can't help but also think it was a.platform to bring more awareness to the dimentia  disease. The term short term memory loss must have been mentioned 6 or 8 times through out the movie. Maybe I'm stating the obvious but I didn't notice anyone voicing this perspective. Very good movie.,1483228800,,391,4.735294117647059

5728457,1,B00CMHL3GY,"The animation was really good, but the story line seemed way too similar to the original film.  When a movie has a good script people think it's funny or touching in some way.  They almost don't even think about the ""writing"".  This movie made the writing stick out.  It was not very creative.  Dare I say it...even boring at times.  The idea was good.  Parts of it were moving due to the synopsis, but the execution definitely left something to be desired.",1482969600,,457,4.5

The only reason this gets a 4 star rating is due to the bonus content - I thought this would include the short Pixar animated story that comes on in the theaters before the start of the movie but it did not. I don't know for sure if Pixar has just stopped doing the shirts that come on before their films bUT I had anticipated them including it with bonus content - alas no such luck.

5728589,4,B00CMHL3GY,"It is a very cute, colorful movie.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because as a sequel, it did not stand up to the original (Finding Nemo) on two counts:  1) As with many sequels, Finding Nemo is a much better movie, and 2) the 3D quality of Find Nemo popped much more than Finding Dory.  Otherwise, it is a nice movie to have in the collection. Simply put, it feels like the writers and artists did not have their hearts into this move as much as Finding Nemo.  Possibly, if I had not seen Finding Nemo, I might rate this movie as five stars.",1482624000,,552,4.083333333333333

It was great to see a few characters from Finding Nemo, in this one as well. And  in the extras, you get to see even more.

For the nay sayers who worry about how the movie would affect adopted children, or fears of losing parents, I think that Dory's forgetfulness is what makes this a doable theme of finally remembering and finding her family. I loved the movie and the final scenes are just wonderful.  I also loved the little scene after the credits, and I would love to see a third movie linking up the recaptured aquarium fish with the group at the Great Barrier Reef.  Also - side note: my husband and I snorkeled the Great Barrier Reef this last October, and all of those fish are REALLY there, clown fish included!",1482192000,5,683,4.544715447154472

5728786,5,B00CMHL3GY,"I bought this movie to watch with my daughter, and I honestly got very emotional as I watched it.  I saw ""Finding Nemo"" before we adopted our son, and I honestly didn't think very deeply about Dory's situation.  But now, being the mother to a very special boy, I watched this movie and I had a hard time keeping from crying and it was impossible for me to watch it without seeing it from the lens of his situation.

As I watched how the story was portrayed of Dory's memory issues, all I could think about was the paradox that is my boy taking me by the hand and navigating and leading me out of the winding halls of buildings he's never been in before and dragging me to our very nondescript car in a loaded parking lot...and then what it's like to have had to put locks on even the dishes cupboards, because he couldn't remember that every time he threw something glass or ceramic on the floor it would break, and he would end up with cuts.  And he would just look at me every single time so confused like, ""how on earth did this happen?""  Or the lock system we have to have on our door because he can't remember that if he gets hit by a car, he's probably not going to make it out alive.

Like Dory, he lives in a world that finds at least one way every day, usually more, to tell him that it doesn't have a place for him, that he isn't good enough.  But the message of this movie for Dory and for my son is that yes, there are places for you and you are good enough, and I think that is a message every special needs kiddo needs to hear over, and over.  As my daughter says, it is very meaningful.

Because at the end of the day, I believe in my kid.  I'm more aware of anybody the challenges he faces, but as we check off one skill after another that people don't expect him to accomplish because of his disabilities, I just kept telling him ""I believe in you. You can do this.""  And I loved that Dory's parents had basically the same thing to say to her. And it's really great to have that message in some form of entertainment that isn't coming from me.  So we loved, loved, loved this movie in this household.",1482192000,23,2117,4.136585365853659

The basic plot is that of Nemo, the story starts off as a flashback then Dory ends up in a fish sanctuary in Morrow Bay. We know it is a carton but the fact that Nemo and his father work to help Dory go from the tropics to the cold Pacific ocean (where they all would have died) was stupid, the octopus character that was helping Dory at the sanctuary was dumb and Sigourney Weaver's voice over was dumb as well.

5729352,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Finding Dory

I saw this when it first premiered in theaters and once again recently at a local theater. The film was very emotional. Personally, I thought the plot was great. It gave a lot of insight into the character of Dory, which allowed character development throughout the film. Dory goes from being this small, scared character to a brave, fearless risk taker. The script provided a lot of pathos, which kept the flow of the story smooth and emotional. The film is an animation by Disney Pixar, but the film elements are well applied. In terms of editing, there is great use of fade-in and fade-out. In terms of camera angles, the film uses eye level or high angle. During scenes of suspense, the film uses low-key lighting to create these horror film like scenes. To set the tone of positive, happy scenes, the cinematographer decided to use high-key lighting. There are a lot of medium shots throughout the film. The film is very well done in terms of use of lighting to set the tone of each scene. The sound track music, which is consistently nondiegetic, aids to set the tone of the each scene as well. The film is very well done and I would love to watch it again! I honestly cried the first time I saw itit may be because Im a very overly emotional person, but I thought the plot was so well done. You really got to know Dory and see how she felt. You could relate to her as a character, just imagining you lost the most important people in your life. There are strong themes of family, love, and loss, but overall the tone of the story is positive. Dory keeps fighting to find her family. The audience also feel the emphasizes on how loss can affect someone. It is a great film to show children and adults of all ages. I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially Disney fans.",1481155200,,1799,4.451515151515151

5729361,2,B00CMHL3GY,I really wanted to like this but it's simply a cash grab for Pixar. I felt like I was simply watching finding Nemo with a few differences and less  memorable characters. Even the new characters did the same things as the old ones did in finding Nemo.   It's also really lacking in humor unlike the first one. I own this but I doubt my nephew's or I will watch it again.

I'm worried that this special 3D may not be all its cracked up to be.

The story line was okay. Let's say I didn't expect sea creatures to be driving trucks down a busy highway. For me, that went just a bit too far. I did like the Octopus character. Wish the turtle dude was in this one longer. Perhaps he needs his own movie next.",1480896000,7,575,4.088495575221239

5729473,2,B00CMHL3GY,"This is an incoherent movie. On the surface, it's a heartwarming story that teaches us to understand our own limitations without guilt, embarrassment, or fear. And yes, Dory's story will probably resonate with anyone who has struggled with a learning disability. However, the movie can't seem to cope with its own sentimentality, as it inexplicably decides to use as comedic relief two other characters who are also impaired (I can't believe I'm writing this, but the movie includes not only a mentally retarded bird but a handicapped seal for good measure).

I'm not sure how those at Pixar couldn't seem to see the irony here.

There's other issues with the script. This movie falls into all the traps of a sequel. They tried to do everything bigger, better, funnier, and for higher stakes, but the result means the story loses attachment with reality. In the first movie, the ocean was a dangerous place, and its challenges seemed important. In this movie, that sense of danger disappears. The fish hop from one tank and cup to another, each scenario more outlandish than the last. As a result, we lose interest, way before an octopus commanders a truck and drives it down the freeway.

Look, I know this is a kid's movie, but I'll call it like I see it. It doesn't deserve all these high reviews.",1480723200,,1300,4.768888888888889

5729487,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Finding Dory is a good entertaining movie.

Most of the characters from Finding Nemo do not return to this film, with the exception on Marlin, Nemo, and of course, Dory, as well as a small cameo from Crush and Squirt, and an even smaller cameo if you watch past the credits. I don't mind new characters, but I don't find the new characters in this film to be as memorable.

The plot is heartwarming, but there are some truly unrealistic moments, (and yes I realize this is a movie about talking fish,) that just don't seem to belong.

Overall any Pixar or Finding Nemo fan would probably enjoy this, and the animation is beautiful.",1480723200,,631,4.517543859649122

A sequel.
Toy Story was strong enough for 1 even 2 sequels... but Finding Nemo was a one and done - unless you're afraid of taking chances and actually embrace creativity.
So - story line is weak - definitely geared for brains 6 years old and younger (unlike other Pixar movies that were enjoyable for adults).
I thought the animation was weak too - not sure exactly what/why, but when Dory first meets Marlin, the animation looks like it went down a notch or two.
I didn't check out the extras - after reading other 4 and 5 star reviews I think I owe it to my pocketbook to at least try to find some value out of this clinker.",1480464000,2,735,4.294964028776978

5729575,5,B00CMHL3GY,Really loved this Film in 3D !! My kids actually were amazed at this film. I definitely say this is an excellent movie for both kids and adults. I wasn't expecting a great sequel but I really enjoyed the plot and message in this film. I think the animated films are so good that they not only bring out the kid in me but they have a great warm family feel to them that we all enjoy watching together. I recommend picking this one up.,1480377600,2,433,4.105882352941176
5729576,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Though I found Dory to be a complete idiot, constantly separated from her companions over and over (seriously, enough already).  Not a bad sequel.  The bonus features are worth buying!  My son would've preferred they keep the entire flying fish storyboard, it was pretty cool... but Disney would've ruined it by creating another spin-off about them.  So far, the Nemo collection has survived and Dory is a cute addition.",1480377600,,420,5.043478260869565

5729582,5,B00CMHL3GY,Best kids movie in years!,1480377600,,25,4.2
5729583,3,B00CMHL3GY,"I found the first twenty minutes of this to be painfully boring viewing, I kept wondering how practically needing a minder at all times to keep her from danger, Dory hadn't been eaten by predators in her life so far. I began to hope she would be, I was that bored and like the other marine creatures, I was getting frustrated with her saying something, swimming in a circle and saying it again because of her short term memory loss. But the movie does get better after the twenty minute mark, with the movie's only chance any character might die coming from a squid that Dory awakens by being stupid. The rest of the movie the worst thing that any character faces is being shipped to Cleveland. At least once we get to the Californian aquarium we have Hank (Ed O'Neil's Octopus character), to add some entertainment to the movie as he becomes a chameleon hiding from the staff while trying to get on the truck amongst the shipment to a Cleveland aquarium while putting up with Dory while helping her to get to her parents, with the vague information she has given him.

Kids won't notice obviously the errors such as different species (exhibits) don't share the same water, but it's wrong that the whale shark refers to itself as a whale when it's a fish. Why teach children the wrong information from the start of their lives? Not sure what the seal bullying teaches them either. Granted real seals do this but the rest of the animals in the film act like humans so this was a bit out of place.

Finding Dory isn't in the league of Zootopia and other recent Pixar films, but if you can get through the first twenty minutes it does become entertaining.",1480377600,,1652,4.503333333333333
5729584,5,B00CMHL3GY,"We all enjoyed the movie.  The only problem with ordering it as digital content is that it's just a straight 4-hour block of material.  There are no menus to find the blooper reel or animator interviews, etc.  You just have to fast forward and hope you stop at the right place.  Bummer.",1480377600,,286,4.4423076923076925
5729585,2,B00CMHL3GY,"First do not watch this expecting it being like Nemo. The Movie Starts of where Dory wants to find her parents and she eventually gets lost trying to find them.

The reason why I am giving this movie 2 stars, is because Pixar has made much better films. The movie's story lacks a lot of creativity. Basically trying to copy finding Nemo. I felt like there wasn't a lot of action sequences in the Movie. Nemo there was the Anglerfish and Bruce the Shark.
The whole movie is about Dory finding her parents, I felt that Pixar started running out of ideas. Where the film started to feel repetitive.

Overall The movie's animation was pretty good, but the story ran out of ideas making it feel quite boring.

I did laugh at and Enjoy The Seals and Baily.",1480377600,,750,4.420289855072464

5729599,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Great movie, fun for the whole family.  This movie is entertaining to people of all ages.  I was not sure if I would like this movie because sometime animated follow up films are to dependent on the first movie to be understood and enjoyed.  This film is a interesting follow up to Finding Nemo, but could be a stand alone film.  For someone who might not have seen Finding Nemo yet you could still watch this movie and enjoy the characters, and follow the story completely.  I highly recommend this movie to people who are looking for a funny, cute feel good movie to watch.",1480377600,12,575,4.438095238095238

It might not be as good as the original; it occasionally feel like a cash grab to sell kids toys.  The story is basically Finding Nemo all over again, but its so charming that I didn't even mind.  Ellen is hilarious, as usual.  The new characters are adorable.  Great for kids & adults alike.",1480291200,6,415,4.54054054054054

5729618,1,B00CMHL3GY,"Felts like a labored repeat of the first film, and frequently found this dark enough that I was wondering if I was supposed to be laughing or troubled, particularly the intro sequences with the tiny lost fish, which were just flat depressing. The rest of the film was just predictable - granted, the animation looks incredible, particularly the ""Open Sea"" exhibit at the aquarium which just looked fantastic, but the plot gets muddled and you don't really know what's going on (and the fact that the story is driven by a fish with memory problems doesn't help things.) The relationship between Marlin and Nemo seemed absent and hurried, and Dori's narrative was just not at all interesting. Nice animations but stale story-telling, plus thought the octopus character felt like another cynical variation of Marlin (with a very similar sounding voice as well.)",1480291200,2,858,5.049295774647887

5729731,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Many sequels fall short of the original, but this one doesn't. We follow Dory from the time she is just a wee baby forgetful fish through to attempting to find her parents as an adult. It is a cute film and well worth adding to any collection.",1479772800,,243,4.191489361702128
5729732,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Ive always said that Im a sucker for a good animated Disney film. Not so much the social commentary films but the out and out kid friendly movies. When FINDING NEMO came out I didn't see it in the theater thinking it wasn't my kind of movie. Ive grown more accepting of the computer animated films from Disney and Pixar. When I finally did see it I was stunned at the clarity of picture, the vast array of colors and how involved I became in the story. Im happy to say that the sequel, FINDING DORY, lives up to that first films high standards.

If you forgot who Dory was she was a blue fish with a problem of short term memory loss. She bumped into Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemos father, and ended up helping him rescue his son Nemo. The movie opens with us learning Dorys story, how she was a little girl and had a mother and father who loved her but who got lost from them. After searching for some time her path intersects with Marlin as we saw in the first film. Its now a year later and Dory lives with Marlin and Nemo and yes, still suffers from that short term memory loss. But something is happening.

Dory begins to have flashes of her life before Marlin and Nemo, memories of her parents. She wants to find them and longs to see them but they're miles away. With a little help from Nemo she finally convinces Marlin, the ever worrisome homebody, to help her get to California where she thinks they live.

Of course the usual happens with Marlin and Nemo getting separated from Dory once they arrive. Their stories run different paths with them nearly finding one another several times. The location that Dory recalls is a marine life park with various area to explore. Dory is caught up in the plastic loops of a six pack tossed in the sea and then rescued by workers from the park. She gets tagged to be shipped to Cleveland to their aquarium there and it seems all is lost.

But then she gets help from a grouchy octopus named Hank (Ed ONeill). He wants to leave the park and go on the truck to Cleveland and tells her to give him the tag she now has on her fin. She agrees if he will help her find her parents. Off the duo goes trying to find the right spot and Dorys folks. And it is the antics of not just Dory but of Hank who uses his ability to camouflage himself in some hilarious moments.

While Dory is off with Hank, Marlin and Nemo get help from a pair of sunbathing sea lions on a rock outside of the park. Their adventure sets off with a whacked out bird picking them up in a bucket of water and trying to get them to the quarantine area where Dory would have been taken, of course unaware that she is in the midst of leaving there. Will they ever find one another? And more importantly will they find Dorys parents?

Once again the movie offers us some amazing rich visuals to look at. All of the underwater scenes in the ocean are breathtaking, even if computer generated. The flow of images is so flawless that youll forget its animated at times. It is a glowing sea of color and movement that makes you wonder where to look next. Computer animation has grown leaps and bounds over the past few decades.

But none of that would matter if there wasn't a story that was worth being interested in as well. The answer is yes, it does offer just such a story. The sense of loss, the fear of the unknown, the hope that Dory will find her parents still waiting for her has you cheering her on and rooting for her to overcome her short term memory loss enough to reach her home. Along the way you also begin to realize that while Dory may have her problems and a slight attention issue, she actually remembers more than she gives herself credit for.

If you were ever lost as a child in a department store or grocery store then you can relate to the emotions of Dory as she tries to find her parents. It is a story that all children can relate to and the child within each of us can relate to as well. This movie entertains, captures your imagination and delights the eye from start to finish. You cant ask much more of a movie with the name Disney attached to it.",1479772800,,4084,4.253865979381444
5729733,3,B00CMHL3GY,"Cute movie that tugged on my emotions...but it lacks the seemingly spontaneous comedy Ellen DeGeneres developed in Finding Nemo.  Also, many of events/scenes are so exaggeratedly impossible, I found my suspension of disbelief failing.",1479686400,2,234,5.882352941176471

5729735,3,B00CMHL3GY,"I will admit that I never watched Finding Nemo when it originally came out so I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy Finding Dory.  After watching though, I will say that I liked this movie much more than I expected.  Although it was aimed more for kids with its cute factor, it was a good story with a nice message for kids and adults.  As it typical with Pixar, the animation is solid and well done.  The acting is also well done and DeGeneres makes Dory a cute and lovable character.  I didn't find it with as many funny moments as other Pixar cartoons as this one is a bit serious throughout much of the movie but I liked the movie well enough to go back and find out what I missed with the Nemo movie.

5729739,3,B00CMHL3GY,"Neither as good, nor as fun, as Finding Nemo.  While Nemo was inspiring and memorable, Dory is forgettable.  I felt like Pixar was struggling to find a plot line.  They had wonderful and fully developed characters from Finding Nemo that they simply didn't use (the Tank Gang, Bruce, Anchor, Chum, Squirt, Crush, etc.).  They also didn't really do a very good job of explaining Dory's memory issues.  They just sort of ""are"".  Hank is OK and would have made a funny new character but it was almost as if Pixar was trying to make a movie that would stand on its own...but it is a sequel.  You expect recurring characters and such and while Marlin and Nemo were main characters they more or less felt tacked on.  In the end it doesn't stand on its own or make a good sequel.  It is in a sort of limbo land that makes you say...""O...K....that could've been better"".  I was disappointed to say the least after really looking forward to watching this with my kids and ended up feeling like I need to explain parts of it as ""wrong"".  Like making fun of the mentally challenged animals (Gerald and Becky).",1479686400,7,1097,4.48989898989899

5729790,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Honestly, I thought this movie was going to be awful. I enjoyed the original Finding Nemo, so I thought this would spoil the frnachise, BUT I WAS WRONG. This movie was amazing, and this is probably the only time ill say that the sequel was better than the original. I may just be saying that because ive been watching the same movie for the past 13 years.

So first, I thought this movie was gonna be horrible because I found out that the voice of Nemo was going to be replaced by Hayden Rolence, which I thought their voices were gonna sound so different and it would ruin everything. But honestly, Nemos voice sounded the same.

I thought the plot was kind of replaying itself when I originally heard about it on IMDB. But somehow the writers were able refresh it, and I thought it was cool that they added new likeable characters like, Hank, &, Destiny.

I also enjoyed the plot that, Dory trying to find her parents, and while she was trying to find her parents, Nemo and Marlin were trying to find Dory. I also thought it was kind of cute, how Dory find them through the seashells.

I also enjoyed, that Dorys short term memory loss, was used a lot more in the plot, throughout the movie.

But I do kind of wonder why Disney And Pixar also waited 13 years to make the movie? I think that Hank being able to turn into camo was pretty cool and really added to the creativity of the movie!

Overall, I think, that if you enjoyed Finding Nemo, you will probably enjoy, this colorful, heart warming, and restoring movie, Finding Dory.",1479600000,,1534,4.402826855123675

5729825,4,B00CMHL3GY,"The best thing about this movie was the octopus. It really was amazing animation! The first movie, Finding Nemo, was more complex because we saw two different stories which started out in the same place, and then the payoff of ending in the same place. In between, we moved from one story then the other several times. That's where this story dragged. We only left Dory for brief moments, looking at whichever fish or seal she was swimming by, but we almost immediately came back to Dory. We needed a break from the main story, to add tension to that story. This was something done so well in ""Nemo"".
I enjoyed the interaction between Dory and the Octopus, Hank. As the movie developed, Hank became more enjoyable and less self absorbed.
The plot did seem to go from urgent to boring to panic and could have used better editing or better writing. Finding Nemo left me with such a warm feeling and has every time I see it. I am not sure how many times I want to re-watch this movie, but Nemo remains the better of the two.",1479427200,,1021,4.407407407407407
5729826,3,B00CMHL3GY,"It starts off with some promise and has flashbacks to the Finding Nemo original, but things go wrong with it as a family movie.  Kids who know the original at the age they are now might like it. Kids who are 5 years old or younger might be frightened by it. It has some dark and scary stuff for very young kids. Heck, I'm not even a dad and could see that in the final 3rd of the flick.  The Pixar graphics are amazing as usual, top notch stuff, but the story is too predicable and follows the pattern of Finding Nemo too much. Too many animated human scenes/human interaction out of water stuff going on...for example...they simulate the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, CA for a lengthy period. This sort of kills the whole fish world fantasy element. Also volume levels change so drastically that I had to constantly turn up or down the volume on my remote at any moment.  It's ok. Stuff we saw before with the Nemo original.  I really wish I had rented and not bought it.  Why?  Because with all it's technical brilliance, it at times almost put me to sleep.",1479427200,,1068,4.341708542713568

5729847,4,B00CMHL3GY,"I'd seen this in the theatres and wasn't sure that I wanted to own this.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie a lot.  But I've become weary of buying movies now due to the ever-changing, and thus re-releasing of movies on different formats now-a-days.  However, the wife really wanted this, so I picked it up as a pre-order.

 Personally, I think I paid too much money for this.  However, I will said that I did get a lot for the money.  This includes the 3d Version, Blu-Ray Version, DVD version, a bonus feature disk (the short animated film that played before the movie in the theatres + more), and a digital license to view it anymore.  So when I look at it that way, it isn't as overpriced as I generally think and generally provides a good value.

  I haven't had a chance to view all versions yet, but seems to be in working proper order.  The case itself is generally durable, with the disc holders functioning quite well (I've had many that were simply too lose and couldn't keep the discs in place).

 Now for the movie itself.  If you have seen and liked Finding Nemo, you will like/love this movie.  It is a good story, and a heartwarming one at that.  It's fun for the kids while being great for adults at the same time.  The voice actors are great in this as well.  I'd say this is not as funny as the original one goes, and maybe a little less imagination too.  But all in all, still a great movie I will have no trouble putting on multiple times and don't think I'll get tired of it.

 Good job Disney/Pixar, you have created another masterpiece.",1479427200,,1564,4.320689655172414

5729873,5,B00CMHL3GY,"This review is on the 3D BD combo pack, not the movie.  Plenty of reviews about the movie.  I always like getting details on what is ON the discs rather than reading someone else's take on the movie.

They have a ton of extra materials on the blu rays.  From varoious interviews with cast and crew to a lot of the behind the scenes details.  It was enjoyable learning that they made Hank a septapus rather than an octopus because he was the most complex creature they ever animated, and doing so nearly crashed the system.  So having one less tentacle to animate made him easier to deal with.

My son and I really loved the ""computer errors"" and the visual glitches.  It's short, but has some great glitches where people are turned inside out or upside down.  Anyone who has done computer graphics will relate to this.

They even have a short ""Emoji"" version of Finding Nemo that's cute, telling the whole story of Finding Nemo using emojis...

And a ""Fish Schticks"" extra is cute too.  Animators having a little fun, similar to how they goof off with ""outtakes"" from some of the pixar movies.  But it's not as good as the outtakes though, and I wish they had done them for this.

They even have animations you can leave on the TV as background sets from the movie that your TV will show as if it's a screensaver, until you select back out of it. Think of an aquatic version of the fireplace DVD some people like to use around the holidays.

And, of course, the deleted scenes are always so much fun to see, becuase often they're directions the movie never went, or sometimes they just give a little more background.  Some are just black and white outline animations, there's soem black and white outline ones with a bit of color here and there...  One is totally finished including the score and lighting (the sleep swimming scene we saw in the first trailer that didn't make it to the movie), and the rest are in between...

Another interesting bit are the various movie intros they did trying to find the right way to start the movie.

The sound is outstanding, and the video quality is awesome upscaled to our 4K TV...  Especially the short ""Piper"" which is just visually stunning.

The 3D looks good as well, despite this not being something you'd normally think of being a huge 3D movie...

We could not make it through the movie, just skipped ahead after 30 minutes to see if it ever got better, which it never did.",1479168000,11,462,4.383720930232558

5730156,5,B00CMHL3GY,"A worthy sequel to finding Nemo, if it does not quite hit the highs of its predecessor. Fleshing out Dory's backstory, and taking us on a wild trip through a Sea World type park. Some great standout new characters, particularly the Octopus. The Climax is one of Pixar's best action adventure sequences on par with the Toy Story movies.

I'll confess my only quibbles are minor. Largely revolving around my views on the Ellen Degeneres Dory character. While I think she is a fantastic character, and I don't hate Ellen, Dory is one of those characters in which a little goes a long way. There is a fine border between perfection and overwhelming verbal diarrhea with that type of character. she dances close to it at a few points. Also minor quibble, what the heck did they do to Nemo and Marlin's character models? Their faces seem too human this time. It makes them seem like characters from that creepy old Sega Dreamcast game Seamen, or the Fish from a Monty Pythin movie. Much like Dory, in the case of the clownfish there is a fine border between cute and lovable aesthetically pleasing characters and the visual stuff of nightmares. The faces get a bit close to nightmare land this go round.",1478217600,,1197,4.64622641509434

5730256,3,B00CMHL3GY,"Not as good as Finding Nemo.  Where Finding Nemo was a decent mix of drama with a lot of hilarious comedy, Finding Dory fell short of that winning formula.  There was a lot more focus on the dramatic story than the comedy.  Sure, it was comedy first, but there was just too much drama mixed in.  I laughed out loud a lot at Finding Nemo, but not so much at Finding Dory.  Don't get me wrong, it's fun and probably worth a watch, but it just doesn't meet the expectations created by it's predecessor.",1477612800,2,499,4.26595744680851
5730257,5,B00CMHL3GY,"It has been 13 years since easily the greatest animated film came out. Now, the very hyped up sequel has been released. Finding Dory brings back the fantastic characters, amazing jokes and the fun story with important morals. This movie, much like Finding Nemo is an adventurous comedy, but that isn't all that this film has to offer. It also has a good amount of child-friendly action. On top of that, the movie features many important morals that teach kids lots of good lessons. Mind-blowing animation by Pixar also impresses the audience.

Finding Dory follows one year after the events of Finding Nemo. Nemo, (Hayden Rolence), Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) are all back in the coral reef, living happily. However, everything changes when Dory gets a memory about her past and her family. They all then go on a quest to the far away coast of California to find Dorys parents. On the search for her parents they meet new friends and see old friends. Many events lead up to one main event. Do they find Dorys parents or not? If you want to find out, you have to watch the film.

As much as I enjoyed this sequel, I was disappointed as it felt like Finding Dory made some of the same mistakes that Star Wars: The Force Awakens made. Both were massively hyped films to continue a successful franchise. Both movies seemed to repeat a lot of the story line from the previous film. The events in Finding Dory are almost exactly like the events of Finding Nemo. This makes it very boring and quite predictable for people who saw the first film. On top of that, Finding Nemo is a fantasy but is done much more true to science. Some of the moments in Finding Dory feel forced even for a fairy tale. On top of that, the jokes in Finding Dory are somewhat repetitive, lack originality and, only a few times, are actually funny. What is especially enjoyable are the scenes with Ty Burrell's voicing the Beluga character. The first film was a complete success in its comedy. You could see Finding Nemo twenty times and still laugh. With Finding Dory, I'm not sure someone would watch it multiple times.

However, there is one thing I really adore about this film - the cast. Since it's been thirteen years after Finding Nemo, the quality of the voice acting was a big question. But after watching the film, I can say it feels like it was made directly after Finding Nemo in 2003. What is most impressive - Hayden Rolence who voices Nemo. Of course, since its been thirteen years, the actor who voiced Nemo can no longer do the same voice so they had to find a new kid. Hayden is stupendous in this role and I could not notice a difference between the two.
My favorite scene is when they introduce my new favorite character, Hank (Ed ONeill), an octopus. Hank finds Dory and agrees to take her to where they think her parents are in return for something that Hank needs. This scene is hilarious and the dialog between the octopus and Dory is delightful.

Finding Dory is meant for kids and thus, has nothing parents should be worried about. Because of a few action scenes, I recommend it to ages 4 through 18. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because the story is so similar to the original and seems rushed and even a bit boring at times. But the voice acting and amazing animation by Pixar makes it all worth the wait.

5730266,2,B00CMHL3GY,"I can't believe all the positive reviews here. Goodness, what a terrible plot. The movie went pretty good at first, but then got progressively worse. The story line fell apart. Dory lived more and more on luck until she made it through about 100 near death situations, each of which would have likely killed her and the ones near her in real life. The characters are weak and forgettable, nothing like the power of Finding Nemo. Even the Disney TV shows such as Sofia the Great have more reasonable plot than this thing. Beautiful art work, though. I will probably re-watch the first part of the movie.",1477440000,5,602,4.635514018691588

5730268,2,B00CMHL3GY,"**Spoilers**  But....if you have a young child with ANY kind of special need that has made you cry or feel genuine fear as parent, read it anyways. Don't get blindsided like I did. Don't get me wrong - the kids will probably love it no matter what. Parent's may not though.

 Disney decided to go another way. Rather than their usual ""kill off a parent routine"", they decided to make a movie pulling the heartstrings of parents who have real fears.  (Here's my rant) There's nothing like being blindsided by Disney.  We've come to expect some kind of tragedy.  One would think that Disney writers believe no story is worth making  unless one parent is missing from the hero/heroine's life - Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Bambi, Ariel, Aladdin, Simba, Nemo, Anna and Elsa...  you get the idea.  There's more, but that's what I could come up with in 5 seconds.  This show is no different though.  More like Princess Aurora, our little girl Dory get's lost as a kid.

We get to watch as Dory's parents , early on, pain-stakingly and patiently work hard to help her every way they can think of. They are scared she will get lost. They worry how she's going to survive.  They cry and console each other in the night, voicing those real fears that it just doesn't matter what they do, there's no way to prepare Dory or protect her from the big ugly world that's coming her way.

So...what happens?  As a young fish, Dory, being cute and as always unaware of the dangers around her, get's lost - sucked down a drain to be precise right in front of the parents.  When does this happen? Right after that big crying scene of the Mama to the Dad.  Yep...worst fears realized.  There's no way the parents can get to her ever again.  We get to follow Dory's story in the movie, but you get to see snippets of how these distraught parents spend the rest of their lives, trying to do what minuscule thing they can to help guide their lost Dory back home - even though years and years have past.

So yeah, it has jokes, laughs and what not.  But if you are a parent, and ever felt those feelings with good reason, you won't love the fact that your very real fears have been used as drama in a highly anticipated kid's movie. I don't really care if this is supposed to be normalizing for the rest of society, helping other's see things from different perspectives.  You won't care either as you sit there with your kiddos, one of whom may have made you cry in much the same way.  You will feel it and it will make you raw and a little upset that of all the stories they could have gone with, this is the one they settled on.

5730273,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Sequels are all too often unearned.  With a movie as beloved as Finding Nemo, the stakes are high, but Pixar finds new depths to the lovable short-term-memory-suffering Dory, again voiced by Ellen Degeneres.  Its not a Pixar masterpiece, nor does it pack the emotional punch of Inside Out, but it creates some memorable new characters and offers a clear and touching parable for kids who might struggle with learning disorders or autism.

The story is straightforward; Dory, living happily with Marlin and Nemo in the coral reef since their adventure a year prior, begins to sense that she has a family somewhere, and decides to venture out in search of her long-lost parents.  With the help of old friend Crush and his turtle posse, they ride another current to the coast of California.  The story is solid, the return of some old characters is welcome.

If theres a but, it would be that focusing the entire movie on Dory lessens her strengths as the funny one, the comic relief with heart, that was so central to her role in Finding Nemo.  Shes as charming as ever, but the morals and lessons of the story fall on her shoulders this time around.  Luckily, writer/director Andrew Stanton introduces some memorable new comic foils and situations that keep the chuckles coming.  Instead of another ocean-spanning search, the action quickly settles onto a Marine research park based on the Monterey Bay Aquarium with theme-park touches of a Sea World, where a variety of sea-creatures recuperate and live on display.

Ed ONeill voices Hank the cranky, escape-obsessed Octopus with ninja moves and camouflage tricks who bargains with Dory.  Caitlin Olson and Ty Burrell are Destiny the near-sighted whale shark and Bailey the Beluga whale with an echolocation deficiency.  Idris Elba and Dominic West are Fluke and Rudder, two sea lions basking on their favorite rock whose behavior is almost as funny as Dug the Dog in Up.  They love to bully Gerald the Seal, who is a new favorite Pixar character; not sure if hes just dim-wittedly stupid or evil, or both, but I hope we see many Pixar shorts featuring the whack sea lion with the Groucho brow. Becky the demon-eyed, hapless duck brings more welcome lunacy.  Some absurd and slapstick action sequences seem a bit more Looney Tunes than Pixar has ventured before, but the change in tone is almost refreshing.

The inevitable family reunion happens with all expected sweetness, with Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy as Dorys long-waiting parents (Keaton is always wonderful, but Pixar really missed a trick by not getting Levys long-time comic partner Catherine OHara to voice the mom; it would have given the couple so much more life and comic possibility).

Almost as terrific is the breathtakingly beautiful and heartfelt Pixar short feature, Piper, about a sandpiper chick struggling to brave the waves at feeding time.  Its proof that Pixar remains at the cutting edge of both animation and story forms, and will continue to be the incubator for our best stories for years to come.

CLICHES:  Lots of fishy business.
SURPRISES:  Stay to the VERY end of the credits for a bit of extra hilarity with Gerald the seal.

5730278,5,B00CMHL3GY,"I really enjoyed this movie. I found it to be just as well made as the first one in terms of CGI quality and voice acting.

I didn't think the story was as good as Finding Nemo. Finding Nemo was overall just a better adventure story with all the things Marlin and Dory had to go through to cross the ocean. In Finding Dory they have to cross the ocean again but this time they just do it. They have done the ocean crossing within the first 10 minutes of the movie. The rest of the adventure takes place in a single location.

It's still very well done and highly entertaining. But Finding Nemo is one of those rare 6 star movies that is hard to equal. Finding Dory earns a 5 star rating. Just because it's not as good as one of the best animated movies of all time doesn't mean it's not still really good.

Dory is the dominant character in this one as opposed to Finding Nemo where Nemo, Dory, and Marlin all shared screen time. In this on its 75% Dory. Hank The Octopus (voiced by Ed O'Neil) becomes the second major character. It's a cool character that shows a lot of growth from a selfish single minded mentality to someone who cares about others.

I absolutely loved the message of Finding Dory, which was all about loyalty to friends and never giving up when they need your help. There is a lot about facing your fears and finding out what you're really capable of as well. I'm a huge fan of that whole message too.

John Ratzenberger's character is REALLY subtle in this one. He's in every Pixar film. Sometimes he has a major role like in Cars. Sometimes he's a cameo. This time he's got a REALLY tiny cameo with an altered high pitched voice.

Ultimately if you liked Find Nemo, I think you'll like Finding Dory. You absolutely need to see Finding Nemo first though. This is very much a sequel where the development and introduction of the main characters is minimal. The writers expect you to already know about Dory's memory problems, Nemo's small fin, Marlin's anxiety issues, etc.",1471132800,21,1994,4.419618528610354

5730283,4,B00CMHL3GY,"2003's Finding Nemo remains one of Pixar's most beloved films, nearly as much as their Toy Story trilogy. But one thing it didn't do was demand a sequel, at least not story-wise. What were they going to do? Have Nemo get lost all over again? It's a big ocean out there but is daddy Marlin (Albert Brooks) really that incompetent? Fortunately, Pixar has found a way to craft a natural follow-up with Finding Dory, by centering the story on everyone's favorite forgetful Blue Tang voiced by Ellen Degeneres.

One of the great joys of Finding Dory is that every character you loved will be just as dear to your heart as before. The title is both accurate and a little misleading. While Dory does get separated from her friends, young Nemo (now voiced by Hayden Rolence) and his alarmist father Marlin, the story is mainly about her quest to find someone. That would be her parents, Jenny (Diane Keaton) and Charlie (Eugene Levy, who plays everyone's Dad in everything), the memory of which re-emerges suddenly during a stingray-led field trip at Nemo's school.  The flashes of recall instill in her a sense of loss she's never felt before, something Marlin can certainly relate to, which is why he and Nemo agree to aid Dory on her search across the big, wide, beautiful ocean.

One of the amazing things about Pixar is their ability to make so many supporting characters that could easily be lead characters. Finding Dory is literally teeming with them. When Dory ends up at the Marine Life Institute (where Sigourney Weaver has the best running gag), a place she remembers as part of her childhood, she is met by a number of new friends, some perkier than others, who will aid in her journey. Ed O'Neill voices Hal, a sourpuss of an octopus whose sole goal is to hitch a ride to Cleveland and a tank all his own. She also becomes pals with a hilarious whale duo, Bailey (Ty Burrell) the beluga with a broken sonar, and whale shark Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) whose near-sightedness has her banging into walls at every turn. Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo get help from a pair of sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West, total The Wire reunion!!!) with boundary issues.  All are colorful, fun, and add to the film's familial spirit and belief in a connected ecosystem.

Returning director Andrew Stanton and co-writer Victoria Strouse take a deeper dive into comedy this time around, with most of the supporting cast getting the biggest laughs. That's not to say you won't feel a little misty over Dory's sad past; it's just that the story moves along so quickly there isn't time to dwell. Along with more laughs there is also more action, although Stanton and Co. pump in a little too much in the overdone, ridiculously over-the-top finale. One ""narrow escape"" is enough, but two or three? Not necessary.

Dory's characterization largely remains the same, which is great, and refreshingly her short term memory loss isn't depicted as a debilitating handicap.  It's still mostly used for jokes, but also gives Dory a unique outlook that gets her out of jams. Don't be surprised if ""What would Dory do?"" becomes a thing all of the kids are saying.

Pixar has built up such a phenomenal resume of original films that every sequel will be compared to one another. It's not really fair so let's avoid doing that this time. Finding Dory has the same heart, charm, memorable characters and gorgeous undersea visuals as its predecessor, so don't be afraid to dive in and enjoy it.",1470182400,8,3462,4.729684908789387

Among the characters, Hank was far and away my favorite. Dory's guide and protector, his grumpy demeanor couldn't mask his fierce loyalty. And, in the final sequence, I couldn't stop laughing at his go-for-broke attitude.

Maybe this doesn't repeat Nemo's originality - sequels rarely can. In itself, though, it's good, kid-safe entertainment.

5730288,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Directed by Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, WALL-E) and Angus McLane (Burn-E) from a screenplay by Stanton and Victoria Strouse (October Road), Finding Dory is a rarity among sequels - it's at least as good as its predecessor and it tells a story that's actually worth making a feature-length movie to tell it.  It's sweetly sentimental and yet amazingly well written, a story where every detail has been thought through and serves a purpose in the telling of the story.

Finding Dory begins what seems like a short time after the end of Finding Nemo.  Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the regal tang who suffers from short-term memory loss, now lives in the same aquatic community as clownfish Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his young son Nemo (this time voiced by Hayden Rolence). While helping (or at least trying to) Nemo's fish-school class, Dory suddenly remembers that she has a family, from whom she apparently became separated from when she was very, very young, younger even than Nemo. Realizing this, Dory becomes determined to find them, even though all she has to go on are a handful of hazy memories that she can barely hang on to.

Concerned about her inability to remember things, Marlin and Nemo accompany Dory to make sure nothing happens to her.  There is, of course, trouble along the way, but as in any Disney film, she ends up getting a lot of unexpected help from a variety of sources that most notably include a cantankerous octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill) who's missing a tentacle, a near-sighted whale shark named Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) and an insecure beluga whale named Bailey (Ty Burrell) who's lost the ability to echo-locate.

As you can probably guess, dealing with disabilities is a recurring theme in Finding Dory, reminding us in a number of subtle ways that just because someone can't do everything doesn't mean that they can't do anything.

What particularly impressed me after the movie was done was how well written it was. Nothing is wasted and every detail that's introduced ends up mattering in some way, whether it's a current trait of Dory's that we discover ends up having roots in her past or something learned in an earlier scene ends up being used as the film hurtles towards its climax. It's all so neatly tied together and flows so seamlessly that you can tell that the writers put an enormous amount of time and care into the screen play to get everything just right.

Another thing that came to me after the film was over was that the title - Finding Dory - is not what people initially think. It's not about Marlin and Nemo trying to find Dory this time around. It's about Dory trying to find herself - her family, her past, and all of the little things she's forgotten but which nonetheless shaped her into who and what she is.

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who likes dazzling animation combined with memorable characters in an extremely well-written story.",1468972800,135,2906,4.796

5730299,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Okay, so lets get this straight, Finding Nemo is a huge part of my childhood, so I went into this movie with expectations.
I was bit let down.
So, warning, there are SPOILERS. I will tell you when the spoilers come up and where the spoilers end.
This movie was worth it, but there were enough problem to make me give it a ranking of three stars.
But that's start with what I enjoyed.
First off, I like the graphics. This movie was just beautiful.
I've always enjoyed the art of Pixar, but this movie is just exploding with color, especially with the coral reef.
I love the sea anyway, which makes me love this movie much more, but the movie is just beautiful. Definitely can see why it took so many years to make.
Second, I like all of the twists and turns and the action. It was a pretty predictable, some parts I'd already guessed what they were going to say or do before they did it, but I like all of the extreme action. It definitely took a large group of people to make this movie. There were so many things that just seemed like it couldn't have been done with only one person.
Third. Okay, I don't think anybody noticed this.
But there was a lesbian couple in the movie. SPOILER ALERT * Remember when Becky was eating up the popcorn and Nemo and Marlin were stuck in the bucket hanging on the tree branch? Well, on the ground when the squid and dory were by the birds, the two girls looked back, weirded out and looked back ahead, one wrapping their arm around the others. There was a baby right next to them in a stroller. * SPOILER ENDED
I'm not saying that could dismiss the fact that they were a lesbian couple, but this could definitely make more theories pop up for anyone who noticed it. Secondly, I was glad that they let a lesbian couple appear in the movie. Many may disagree on this topic of spreading homosexuality through childrens shows, childrens books etc. But I think it's a good thing. Some children need to know that you don't need to love the opposite sex. Or that you don't have to like boys or girls at all. Or that being feminine is okay.
Now, onto the negatives.
First off, most the movie felt rushed. Other times, there wasn't enough balance, which I think had to do with the people either working from behind the scenes or because they had to fit so much into a short time.
The point is, some scenes were too drug out while they should've been rather fast-paced while other scenes were too quick when they should've been slowed down. Certain pacing was used in the wrong scenes, and it definitely showed, given I had sometimes a hard time keeping up with the movie in the fast scenes, SPOILER ALERT * Specifically when Dory was about to be eaten by the one eyed squid. * SPOILER ENDED, while other times I had a hard time concentrating on the movie because I got bored in certain scenes, that, should have otherwise been an exciting scene.
Secondly, I didn't agree with some of the bullying that went on with the seals SPOILER defending their rock to that uni-browed seal. SPOILER ENDED Others laughed, but I just don't think translating bullying or mentally handicapped people into comedy is funny. Whatever the movie.
Lastly, I was disappointed with the ending and how the pacing went havoc.  No, i'm not talking about the scene where the SPOILER truck ends up flying over the cliff SPOILER END no, i'm talking about SPOILER when Dory finds her family SPOILER END.
It left me feeling a little disappointed.
Sure, a tear formed, but it got a little long when I think the writer could've done a better job condensing it, giving better and more fleshed out emotion to the scene that a slog through what should be an emotion moment. I'm not talking about the beginning of the scene, i'm talking about the middle.
So, the movie was good, I would recommend it, not the highest of my recommendations, but still good.",1468454400,2,3845,4.453900709219858

5730304,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Finding Dory is another fun filled family movie by Pixar.  I don't think it is as good a film as Finding Nemo but Finding Dory is a very enjoyable movie experience and I found myself laughing during several parts of the movie.  The film definitely stands on its own feet and can be enjoyed without seeing the first film.  I would definitely recommend the movie for anyone five years and up.  Parents will enjoy the film just as much as the children just like every other by Pixar.  Simply put Finding Dory is a winner.

I took my 4 year old daughter to see the film in the theatre.  She enjoyed the movie and stayed focused through most of it.  She started getting antsy about 2/3rds the way through because we ran out of popcorn and wouldnt sit still in her seat.  Primarily this is because we had to wait through 7 different movie previews and a Pixar short film before the movie even started.  So I would advise that if you are seeing the movie with toddlers or younger children arrive about 15 minutes late so you will miss all the previews.  I knew the short film was coming and just like all the others touching and fun to watch.  But we could have lived without half the other film trailers.

Ellen Degeneres is funny and most of this movie has to do with Dorys childhood and how she became separated from her loving parents.  Who try to help her with her short term memory loss.  Anyone who has ever lost their wallet or car keys can relate.

I think Hank the orange octopus (voiced by Ed O Neil) was the most interesting character in the movie.  Watching him navigate a stroller through the water park was thrilling.  You could understand his utter terror of being touched by human children.  The touch and feel tank scenes are smart and funny at the same time.  I think those parts of the movie really make the film shine along with seeing how Dory learned to speak whale.  The truck scenes are an absolute riot and look great on the big screen and who could forget Becky the bird.

There is a very funny scene right out of the movie Alien with criss crossing pipes where Dory is headed right toward an unknown object heading right towards her.  The bluga whale and whale shark are trying to direct Dory through the pipes using sound, it is a very clever movie drop especially with Sigourney Weaver doing the aquarium narration like in WALL-E.

The movie has charm and style even the ending credit scenes are enjoyable and interesting.  Finding Dory is the type of sequel we were all hoping for that adds to the adventure without overstaying its welcome.  Pixar has another winner on its hands.  I would rate the movie a strong 4 to 4  stars.",1468195200,2,2652,4.4235537190082646

5730306,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Disney and Pixar have done some amazing things for cinema for many years. Their success comes not only from their rich animation and detailed storytelling, but from their immensely likable characters. It'd be considerably tough for me to say which Pixar characters are my favorite specifically; only because I feel each individual one is unique in his/her own way.

It has in fact been well over 13 years since we last saw Nemo, Marlin, and Dory, but that doesn't at all mean that they are any less interesting to watch. As a matter of fact, they are just as interesting here to watch as they were in the first film.

Though Finding Dory may have shifted its focus from little Nemo to Dory; I feel the movie does a mostly successful job at doing what it set out to do. Ellen DeGeneres doesn't disappoint as Dory either, much like in Finding Nemo; she's just as entertaining and fun to watch this time around. Watching Finding Dory, I truly did feel sympathy for Dory because some of the certain issues she faces, felt all too real for myself. Seeing Nemo and Marlin return put a smile on my face, because I knew the movie would be adventurous with them around.

And that's in itself is a plus for Finding Dory. Not only is it hilarious in some parts, but it still retains that sense of adventure that the first film had; even if it doesn't always have the same amount of depth that Finding Nemo has. As with all of the Pixar movies, the animation here is done really well, and there are even some new creatures to be seen in the movie. Finding Dory doesn't just have fun as a movie, it also delivers a valuable theme that ends up being of importance in the film. Make no mistake, Disney/Pixar has succeeded once more with Finding Dory. But above all else, Finding Dory is a movie that both kids and adults will enjoy.",1468108800,4,1817,4.45045045045045
5730307,1,B00CMHL3GY,"Finding Nemo was cute. This addition was not. First of all, is Dory a girl? There is nothing about Dory that is feminine. Not even her eyes or the shape of her mouth. What you see on the cover pic is what you get. She's not pretty, sweet, charming, witty, or anything else. She's a completely asexual, uninteresting character with the ambiguous grownup voice of Ellen DeGeneres. Think of the character Pat from SNL. It felt as if a huge dimension of life, all sexual characteristics and feelings, was missing from the story. If you have a little girl who relates to being a girl, this movie will be a let down. Once Dory grows up (the first 5 minutes), there is nothing endearing about her. Perhaps boys won't care or notice one way or the other, since Dory is essentially...... not a girl.

The story line (Dory can't remember anything because she has a short term memory disability), while capturing the sympathy of adults, tends to make the movie quite boring and monotonous. Dealing with people who have memory disabilities is not something that most people enjoy, particularly children.  Even Dory's delivery of sadness at not being able to find her family is dull, devoid of feeling, and delivers zero reason for continuing to watch. If your child is over age 5, or capable of thinking for his/her self, dealing with dull Dory is going to be a drag.

Beyond the boredom and monotony of Dory, most of the movie consists of unlikely, impossible gobbledygook to make up for the complete lack of engaging characters and events. This made the movie even more tedious, having to revert from boring reason to ridiculous hype over and over, on top of Dory not being able to remember anything.  It could have been so much better. My 6yo gave it 0 stars and asked me not to make her watch any fish movies again. This movie is definitely geared more toward bored 3-4 yr olds. But don't count on it to babysit the kids while you do dishes.",1468022400,7,1933,4.578034682080925

5730315,3,B00CMHL3GY,"This was a bit mixed to my eye. Dory, who I gather is a character from the first film has memory problems but twigs to the fact she lost her parents. So, with Marlin and Nemo in tow, she sets out to find them  in California. Once there, they have some good fortune in finding helpers who contribute to an impressive ability for the fish to get around on dry land. And drive trucks and a few other things which you don't often get from fish. The stand-outs here were an octopus and a beluga whale. I have to admit I found the first part of the film a bit dreary but the imagination shown in depicting the later events was quite good.

One odd note was a strange focus on characters who were a bit challenged in some way. Dory for instance has memory problems. While she is generally treated well and becomes the hero, another example or two jarred a bit. This said, the two six year olds with me really enjoyed the film. Im not sure itll be something theyd want to watch again and again but it did the job this day.

Plus, most of the characters in Finding Nemo were so depressed and frustrated throughout the whole movie that it kind of made me feel the sameway. Finding Dory felt different to me, there were characters that showed problems but it was quickly said and didn't drag the positivity of the movie down. The movie moves at a lightning pace but doesn't get lost anywhere. Now there are less believable moments in this movie than the first one but it made it fun. I think Andrew Stanton did a great job on this more lighthearted sequel.",1467676800,2,664,4.588235294117647
5730318,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Pixar has turned out a number of sequels over the years.  While they all don't match the originals in creativity (they are sequels after all), they are still a fun way to revisit old friends.  Their latest sequel is Finding Dory, and it fits the mold perfectly.

After an initial sequences that shows us Dory as a young fish and then growing up, we meet up with Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), Marlin (Albert Brooks), and Nemo (Hayden Rolence) one year after their first adventure.  Dory is on a field trip with Nemos class when she suddenly has a memory about her family.  She knows where they live  the Jewell of Morro Bay.  Marlin is very reluctant to leave home, but soon Nemo and Dory convince them to come along as they attempt to reunite Dory with her family.

What Dory remembers turns out to be a research center and aquarium right next to the ocean.  When the trio arrive, they quickly get separated, with Dory taken inside and Marlin and Nemo trying to get back to her.  Inside, Dory meets Hank (Ed ONeil) an octopus who tries to help Dory find her way to her parents.  Will she find them?  Where are they in the facility?  Can Marlin and Nemo catch back up to her?

There are several things that keep this movie from being as wonderful as it could be.  First, Dory makes a great sidekick, and her memory loss is pretty funny for a sidekick.  However, it gets a little old when your main character is constantly forgetting things.  Its just not as funny as it could be.  Second, Marlin seems to have reverted completely back to his worrywart persona for much of the film.  One thing I liked in the first movie was his character growth, so seeing his character build from that would have been nice.

However, the one thing that Pixar constantly gets right is the fact that they don't force all the characters from the first movie into the sequel.  We get some cameos by a few characters from the original, but that is all.  And while a few of the plot points feel familiar, its never for very long.  Instead, those plot points lead us into some wild new adventures.

And the creativity that the team shows makes this movie fun.  Almost all of the action takes place around the aquarium, and it requires the fish to get from one location to another outside of water at times.  Yet, they do it in some creative ways.  Oh, I know that in real life what they do could never work, but this is a Pixar movie, and Im willing to give them a little license.

In fact, what we see over the course of the film is remarkably believable.  If you buy into the premise, youll go along for a great ride.  We meet some fun new characters as well, including the already mentioned Hank and a couple of whales with their own problems.  We also learn how Dory learned a couple of her trademarks.  All this leads up to one of Pixars patented climaxes that will not quit.  I wasn't sure how they were going to resolve things until it all came together in a very fun way.  We also learn what seals are really saying, too.

I do want to address the lesbian couple controversy.  To be honest, I had to look it up on Google afterward to see what I had missed.  Yes, its not obvious in the scene because of so much else happening, but now I can see that it was there.  Its a very very small part of the film (one scene) and not in your face at all.  Still, it is there, and parents might want to be aware of it and be prepared for it before they let their kids watch it.

As always, the animation is fantastic.  It fits perfectly with the world they already established in Finding Nemo stylistically.  Thats not to say there aren't some beautiful shots along the way just like there were in the original.

The voice cast is fantastic.  Along with those Ive already named, we get Ty Burrell and Kaitlin Olson with Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy as Dorys parents.  They perfectly bring their characters to life.

And yes, there is a short to start out the movie.  Piper is an adorable film about a sandpiper leaving his nest for the first time.  The animation on it is outstanding.  Part of it looked very real like so much of The Good Dinosaur did.

Oh, and be sure you stay until the end credits are completed.  Trust me on this.

While Finding Dory doesnt recapture the magic of the first movie, it does give us a good new adventure with old friends.  If you love these characters, youll be glad you came along for the ride.",1467590400,3,4407,4.3304773561811505

5730323,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Quite honestly Finding Nemo is a sore spot for me in the history of animation, because I feel so polar-opposite of just about everyone. To answer some other reviewers' rhetorical question of who doesn't like Finding Nemo...the answer is...ME! As far as I'm concerned that film had exactly two positives. 1. It had beautiful art/animation that looks awfully like the real ocean. 2. Willem Dafoe's Angel Fish ""Gill"". The reason for the first was that Pixar is continually adding horsepower to their animation hardware/software suite, and it shows in ambitious environments like those shown in that film. The reason for the second was that unlike the rest of the film, his character (in my not-so-humble opinion) actually had some depth. But even if you hated the first Finding Nemo film like I did you'll find a whole heck of a lot more to like this time around. As some people have said that the first film is better I think I have an obligation to break it down for those either haven't seen the second film and aren't sure they want to, or who thought the second film was better but are being swayed by the overwhelming power of public perception that Finding Nemo was some kind of classic...

Animation, Art Direction, Cinematography, Film Technique

Okay, first of all this film swims all over the first in terms of sheer cinema craftsmanship. There's better use of camera angles, better quality art, better use of color, more detail (to the point where at times it's almost TOO realistic), and in general everything is 2.0 upgraded visually. Every scene is more interesting visually than the first film, and draws you in and captures your attention. VERY well done in the film-making category.

Sound

The score to Finding Nemo was forgettable, much less so this time around. There's some genuinely BEAUTIFUL music in this film. The sound effects and sound direction likewise is more like a great film vs just ""busy"" like in the first film (ups and downs and too much going on). There's some seriously good sound design in this film used for story-telling and dramatic effect.

Script and Dialog

Oh yeah, there's a few reviews that try to break this film down into a series of simple plot points, but that misses both the content and execution of the script. The dialog is much better this time around. The jokes are actually funny and the characters aren't just flat stereotypes. Instead, (like the Angel Fish from the first film), you get a real sense that every character in this film has a LIFE. Personally I think there's an influence of films such as the Ice Age, and Madagascar series here, because those series thrived on the layers of character (to the point where critics groaned loudly about ""too much talking""). Well, some more talking that's actually SAYING SOMETHING is just what this sequel needed, and got. The dialog is much sharper and loaded with meaning this time around.

Story, and Heart...and FUN!!!!

Yes, you could probably sum up the basic story of the film in a paragraph or two (or heck even a trailer), but there's a LOT more going on here emotionally than the first film (and it manages to be the good kind, as opposed to the deeply unpleasant feeling I got from the first film's over-wrought neurotic emotionalism). The obvious of course is that Dory shifted from a goofy empty-headed sidekick to a PERSON suffering from a deeply debilitating mental disability. That whole aspect of the film almost plays out like a PG-rated Memento, as Dory has the same conversations over and over, each time discovering things anew, never realizing what she is doing or that she is being played. I'll be honest. There was potential here for this film to go VERY dark, and I kept expecting horrible betrayal and heart-break. Fortunately no such heart-break happens (yeah, yeah, spoilers, whatever). However! There IS deep emotion in this film which comes fro WITHIN the characters as they come to grips with what's truly important to them (Wow. Just...Wow).

The truth is that you or your children may learn some DEEP lessons about how to treat people with mental disabilities as a result of seeing this film, because the way it all unravels is so incredibly REALISTIC. Dory DOES have the ability to form long-term memories, but cannot recall short-term ones. This results in her stringing together one memory and landmark (memory or physical location) to the next, and living in constant fear of a short-term memory paralysis death-trap (if left alone in a maze, she would wander in circles until she dies, and she knows it). This is incredible story-telling for a children's film. Just incredible.

More spoilers: I think I've been to the places this film is based on... Yes, I'm pretty surethe location where most of the film takes place (a GORGEOUS aquarium) is based heavily on the good ol' Monterey Bay Aquarium where I spent countless childhood weekends. This new location lends a huge amount of fun to the film as it allows countless moments of excitement, wonder, and discovery, and introduces some WONDERFUL characters. It's all a bit unrealistic physically and logically (and yes, the ending will ""jump the shark"" heehee, in some people's minds), but goodness it's fun.

This film has HEART, in spades. I'd like to think that this film is the result of some spill-over emotionally from Inside-Out. That film made me cry, and I think this one got me teary-eyed, but they were the tears of feeling something deep that resonated. I'm only too happy to find that the characters from the first film (Nemo the annoying child and his even-more-annoying father), have been fleshed out to characters that even I can love and care about (I didn't care even slight about them in the first film), but I'm even more overjoyed to find that most of the new characters are similarly full (I LOVE Destiny) and even the minor ones are endearing.

This is just my opinion as a film-lover and animation fan, but I think this is a thousand times the film Finding Nemo was. I never want to see Finding Nemo again for as long as I live (I watched it and Incredibles again just to give them a second chance, and yup, I hate them both). But I'm going to own the Blu Ray of this film and expect to re-watch it countless times.

Yes, every negative people point out is true. There are some drab colored scenes when characters are sad, and that realistic ocean look in some scenes may turn some off. This is a sequel and old characters return. The climax of the film is pretty unbelievable. But personally, I loved every moment of this film and feel it's flaws are too minor to detract from the awesome (I feel the same way about Frozen).

I consider this a must-own for the serious animation fan or anyone who demands more emotionally from their animated films. Five well-deserved stars, and then some for surprising me (I suspected this would be a better film from the trailer, but the performances from actors in the first film genuinely shocked me with their quality). Awesome.",1467417600,18,6985,4.766749379652605

I originally feared it would become nothing besides the writers taking advantage of nostalgic fan service to overuse the famous characters short-term memory loss solely for laughs. Worst of all, it would dumb her down into an offensive stereotype toward people who actually have her condition. But you know what? Finding Dory instead did the opposite, showing how tragic short-term memory loss can really be for a poor little fish.

It all appropriately starts with Dory as a cute little tyke being taught by her parents how to explain her short-term memory loss to others. Then this touching opening turns immediately devastating as she wonders if she would ever forget her parents. Mom and pop simply affirm to her: follow the shells to find her way home. Then suddenly, she unexplainably appears in the middle of a dark kelp forest, separated from her parents. What happened to them? Where are they? How can she find her way home?

It would be easy, except she doesnt remember.

Now little Dory has nothing to do other than wander the ocean asking random fish where her mommy and daddy are. Yes, only five minutes in and its already the second most devastating way to start a family movie (number one being Up). Eventually, she forgets what shes even searching for, left only to wander the ocean for the rest of her life, questioning her own existence. Here is where Marlin comes in.

One year later, shes living in a coral bed across Marlin and Nemos anemone. Life seems just fine, until a freak accident causes her to remember something: her parents are in California! Thus, she talks Marlin and Nemo into going with her across the ocean to find her parents. Once a traumatizing giant squid attack follows after a trip through the EAC, Dory gets separated from her clown fish friends, ending up in the Marine Life Institute, quarantined and tagged for shipment to the Cleveland aquarium. Yet shell stop at nothing to find her family!

Yes, it is unbelievably tragic to see how her short-term memory loss got her into such a bad place; it makes her character in Finding Nemo so much deeper, accomplishing exactly what any sequel should accomplish. But she thankfully has some friends to help her along the way.

Theres Hank the cranky octopus, whose slippery tentacle movements create some phenomenal visual gags with his camouflage ability.
Theres Destiny the ditsy whale shark, who cant stop running her head into things.
Theres Bailey the beluga whale, who adds some fantastic comedic material with his whale shark friend. Theres Becky the silent loon, who pecks at anything that moves.
Theres Rudder and Fluke, the lazy sea lions who are relatively weak in spite of some definite hard-hitting laughs.
Theres the irresistibly cute otters who you just want to cuddle with.
Then theres Dorys loving parents, who undeniably care for their little girl.

Along with the memorable new characters and intense emotion, the worlds setup also adds tremendous influence on Dorys journey of literal self-discovery. While its not in the ocean, its for the majority of the part in the amusement park reminiscing Sea World. The films director Andrew Stanton has stated that Finding Dory features a new upgrade for their usual RenderMan system, allowing the animators to craft indirect light. Now let me tell you something: it pays offeach individual location has its own set of colors and textures to brim its own unique feel, making you feel like you're there. Its incredible to see how the barnacles and kelp decorate the environment, as well as how the soft, vivid memories of Dory are rendered as they come back to her. The aquariums brilliant blue fish tank looks the most visually satisfying of all the set pieces, all even more of an immersive delight in 3D. It almost seems like computer animation exists specifically for underwater animation.

In the end, the stunning animation adds so much power into Dorys discovery of her past. Its all a matter of asking, What would Dory do? I felt surprisingly empowered while seeing a seemingly hopeless fish like Dory resolved a major issue independently by learning the way around her disability. Contrary to my thoughts coming into the theater, the mentally disabled can learn quite a bit from Finding Dory.

Whether if you have Alzheimers, dementia, down syndrome, autism, Aspergers, or even are a bit short on remembering things, keep in mind one philosophy for you to live by: whatever seems to hold you back from everyone else will never hold you back from yourself. If Dory can ignore her mental situation to make it all the way to a Californian aquarium, then you can do similar. If Dory can remember little things by seeing related items, you too can do similar. Dory has her own unique way of remembering things which works toward her survival. As for you, you too have that one unique thing to help you to overcome your one unique obstacle. Therefore, I recommend Finding Dory to family, kids, teens, everyone.

Youve already heard this said many times before but here it is: Pixar, youve done it again!

5730353,4,B00CMHL3GY,"I was a little hesistant about this one. Not that I didn't have faith in Pixar, (since their track record for making movies is pretty incredible) it's just that even when watching Finding Nemo many moons ago I never really liked Dory. She just came off as more annoying than a funny, lovable sidekick.

After just now watching the movie I can say that Pixar did another great job and it was far better than I thought it would be.

Like with any classic Disney sequel, it always brings a lot of magic and joy seeing the characters reunite on the big screen again. And with this especially you really get sucked back in and immersed in the story.

Another great film by Pixar! While it isn't at the same level as the original, it still holds it's own and is a worthy sequel that belongs in your Disney collection!",1466553600,3,811,4.3933333333333335
5730354,4,B00CMHL3GY,"Theatrical review.  I wish I had watched my copy of Finding Nemo before seeing this sequel for comparison, but I didnt.  So, I have to rely on 13 year old memories, but this animated film seems to pick up where Nemo left off.  And the story revolves around a similar theme.  Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) was a catalyst in, uh, finding Nemo (Hayden Rolence), the lost Clown Fish searched for by his father, Marlin (Albert Brooks).  Its now Dory who remembers that she once had parents too.  In flashback sequences we see Jenny (Diane Keaton) and Charlie (Eugene Levy) fawning over their young Blue Tang with short term remembery (sic) loss.

With coaxing from the still young Nemo, Dory decides to cross the ocean in search for her parents.  But she needs help due to her memory deficiency.  Reluctantly, Marlin agrees to help.  What could he say, Dory was influential in rescuing his son.  The trio is headed for the aquarium at Morrow Bay, California.  They have the expected resolvable difficulties along the way and eventually make it, although Dory is separated from Marlin and Nemo.  But not to worry, she finds unexpected help from a grouchy, but inventive octopus named Hank (Ed ONeill), a farsighted whale shark (Katlin Olson) and a beluga whale (Ty Burrell) who has lost his sonar abilities.

The Disney/Pixar folks are on the top of their game as usual with their beautiful animation.  Even their often dark shots of various underwater pipes come across clear and distinct.  In darken oceans we can still see detail of sunken boats, tires and other various junk, dumped by man.  While there are certainly some funny scenes, mostly thanks to Hank and a couple sea lions (Edris Elba and Dominic West), Dorys forgetfulness begins to become tiresome.  Sorryhad to say it.  I also thought the film was a bit lacking of the grown-up humor that has been able to draw in an audience that wasn't forced to go by their kids.  As it is, this is a wonderful film, with a proper dose of charm and morality and with some engaging action sequences.  It just doesnt hold up to the studios best efforts.  Still recommended.",1466553600,2,2110,4.723287671232876

5730356,5,B00CMHL3GY,"""Finding Dory"" is brilliant. This is how the story goes: The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish reunites with her loved ones, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.

The voice cast led by Ellen DeGeneres (as Dory) & Albert Brooks (as Marlin) is brilliant. The directing by Andrew Stanton (who wrote the story & co-wrote the screenplay) & co-directing by Angus MacLane (who also wrote additional story material) is brilliant. The story by Stanton & the screenplay by Stanton & Victoria Strouse, with additional screenplay by Bob Peterson is brilliant.

The music by Thomas Newman is brilliant. The cinematography by Jeremy Lasky is brilliant. The film editing by Axel Geddes is brilliant. The production design by Steve Pilcher is brilliant. The art direction by Don Shank is brilliant. The casting by Natalie Lyon & Kevin Reher is brilliant. The sound effects editing by Jonathan Borland, Ken Fischer & Samuel Lehmer is brilliant. The sound editing by Steve Slanec & Tim Nielsen is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Chris J. Chapman is brilliant.

This is a brilliant, well-done, well-crafted and entertaining sequel that is just as brilliant as the original. This is also another brilliant film from Disney & Pixar. Ellen DeGeneres & Albert Brooks are superb in their vocal performances as Dory & Marlin. Andrew Stanton has directed another brilliant film for Pixar & Disney. This is one of the best films of the summer season and also one of the best animated films of the year, as well, too.

5730360,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Finding Dory
 Pixar, the wonderful animated film company invented by Apple founder Steve Jobs, introduced us in ""Finding Nemo"" to a big eyed blue fish named Dory.  Dory suffers from a brain disorder that prevents her recall of events in her short term memory.  Now she has her own movie, ""Finding Dory"".  Only the wonderful Pixar company (now part of Disney) could make such a colorful, fun, funny and delightful film about a brain impaired fish.  Wow.
 In the full Pixar tradition, the movie has many moments where side characters to provide humor while advancing the story.  Dory herself, Nemo and Nemo's dad provide the core characters but lots of others come in and out.  A  fast acting octopus helps Dory out, often against his better judgement.  A couple of sea lions with a London East End accent guard their sun spot rock from a goofy interloper while helping Dory along her way.  Some surf guy sea turtles carry Nemo and his dad all the way across the Pacific ocean.  Each of these characters, even ones we see only briefly, have full personalities that we can enjoy.
 Besides the inspiring story and the Pixar perfect animation we also have a collection of well known actors to voice the characters.  Ellen DeGeneres again voices Dory, the game but often thwarted fish.  Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neil (Modern Family) and Ty Burrell (also on American Family) all pitch in.  Up and coming young actress  Kaitlin Olson plays the voice of a dim eyed whale shark.  Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, Idris Elba, Dominic West (also playing the the current ""Warcraft"") and Bill Harder  all help.  Finally, Sigourney Weaver plays the voice of herself as the announcer voice at a sea life center.  Whew.
 Director Andrew Stanton won Oscars for two other Pixar films, ""Wall-E"" and ""Finding Nemo"".  He also wrote the story and the screenplay.  Angus MacLane helped write the screen play and also had a hand in other very successful Pixar projects.
 On a $200 million budget the family safe PG film took in a stellar $187 world wide over the three day week end and early Thursday night showings.  The domestic box office had a pre-weekend estimate of $100 million but smashed that by taking in $136 million to add to $51 in overseas earnings.  This four and a half saw blade movie will be enjoyed by the whole family.

5730365,5,B00CMHL3GY,"Dory (Ellen Degeneres) is a blue fish who has short term memory loss. It's amazing how she remembers everything. Pictures helped give her clues on how to find her parents. Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemos dad helps set up Dory with her adventure by asking an 150 year old friend (a sea turtle) named Crush (Andrew Stanton) to help them. Crush takes them on the sea current to California marine life institute where Dory thinks this is the place where they live. Nemo (Hayden Rolence) comes with them. The institute is a rehabilitation center and aquarium where fish get better. Dory gets seperated from Marlin, and Nemo. Captured, at the aquarium Dory meets an octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill). Hank takes Dory to several tanks at the aquarium. What would Dory say? ""Hank rhymes with tank.""  Dorys adventure gets a step back when she is placed by in a tank labeled Destiny. Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) is also a name of a whale shark. In the tank next to Destinys is a beluga whale named Bailey (Ty Burrell). Hank wants Dory to go to the Open Ocean exhibit (where her first home is).This is where Dory thinks her parents are. When she finds out they are not there, she goes back with Hank. They end up in the touch tank where the sea life is felt by many kids. Dory now believes that her parents are in Cleveland. A truck would deliver them there. Marlin and Nemo come rescue Dory with the help of sea lions, and a loon. With success, Marlin, and Nemo reach Dory. Dory tells them what she did so far. Marlin, and Nemo get separate from Dory again. Dory finds the ocean again. She is found by her parents Jenny, and Charlie. Dory comes back to rescue Marlin, and Nemo from the truck. Destiny, and Bailey help get their friends back, and everyone is happy again. The pictures in this movie were gorgeous. I highly recommend this movie to all ages. Disney, and Pixar did it once again!",1466121600,6,1874,4.511764705882353
5730366,4,B00CMHL3GY,"The Good:
From the very beginning, the film does an excellent job in catching us up from the previous Finding Nemo film. (Which was 13 years ago!) It was nice to get see so many familiar faces from the past film and to be introduced to new characters in this sequel.
Something you may notice that's a little different from the previous film is that it's a bit more emotionally rich. Naturally, you'll have some funny and entertaining moments, but this time around there are a few more sentimental moments. I don't think it's anything comparable to ""Bambi's mom dying"" level of emotional. Although, there are some moments that may cause a tiny little lump in your throat to climb up.
Ellen DeGeneres is absolutely perfect for the character of Dory. It would be simply impossible trying to imagine anyone else being Dory. Her running jokes are funny throughout the entire film. Ellen, and the writers of the movie, bring forth a lot more depth in Dory's character. She's not simply the silly side-kick character for comedic relief. They showed through her (including all of the other supporting characters) just what makes Dory such a special character.

Moreover, it was especially refreshing to see yet another female lead character, but this time around it's a disabled female lead character. If you were like me, Dory's short-term memory used to be only perceived as comedic relief. In this sequel, while there are still funny moments, there are also moments that force you to look at disabilities (of other characters as well) in a different way.
The Bad:
Even though the movie isn't long (only 97 mins), there still seemed to be a few slow moving scenes. Now to be fair, those scenes just set up another good or emotional moment. However, with children in mind, those slow moments may lose younger children's attention.
As mentioned above, this movie is a little more emotionally heavy than Finding Nemo. There are some sad moments that may just require an additional conversation from parents with their children. It's nothing over the top, but just something to keep in mind for audiences under the age of six years old perhaps.
Look, maybe this is nitpicking, (and I know that this is a kiddie cartoon) but the ending did get a little too far fetched. In comparison to Finding Nemo, even though they all go on crazy adventures, it got a little over the top even for this cartoon.

Beyond that, I'd probably say feel free on skipping on the 3D for this film as well. There just didn't seem to be any memorable special effects that would warrant spending the extra money for that 3D ticket. Maybe it was just me, but the 3D glasses also seemed to make the movie a tad bit darker, and not as vibrantly colorful as the previous film.

The Reason:
In my opinion, I think that Finding Nemo was a better movie for younger children, because it was so much more light-hearted, colorful, and energetic. I do believe that Finding Dory is a great film for kids maybe between the ages of 6-12 years. (Adults will enjoy this as well) I think that Finding Dory is a great platform to spark meaningful conversations within families about differently-abled individuals in society. This is what make movies so special. They tap into our everyday lives, and find a way to have us relate to other people in ways didn't originally imagine.
So by all means, feel free to watch Finding Dory. It's obviously a perfect family movie, and don't be surprised if you find yourself having some meaningful conversations afterwards. Oh and speaking of afterwards, watch the movie all the way past the credits for a bonus scene.
