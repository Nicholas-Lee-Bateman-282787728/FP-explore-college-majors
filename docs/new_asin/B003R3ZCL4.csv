8403164,5,B003R3ZCL4,"The Tenderfoot certainly isn't extremely corny as I thought it might be! True, one or two jokes were dated but overall I was pleasantly surprised; the plot was great with some very funny lines and situations while the acting by all was excellent. Indeed, if you ever want proof that Joe E. Brown could carry a movie without any trouble, here it is! The action moves along at a good pace; I was never bored. The sets were very well designed both indoors and outdoors and the choreography and cinematography enhance the film quite a bit. In addition, the musical score, while not extensive, enhances the film.

When the film begins we meet sharp-shooter yet very nave Texas cowboy Calvin Jones (Joe E. Brown). Calvin arrives in New York City with twenty thousand dollars (his family's life savings) in cash and he doesn't seem the slightest bit concerned about being robbed! He goes into a Jewish delicatessen where he sits down next to crooked showbiz producer Joe Lehman (Lew Cody) and it isn't long before Joe Lehman and his crony Mack (Robert Greig) sweet talk Calvin into buying what Calvin thinks is a full partnership in their latest stage production, ""Her Golden Sin.""

Of course, there are complications. Calvin has actually bought 49% of ""Her Golden Sin"" using his entire life savings; and only Joe's secretary Ruth (Ginger Rogers) begins to feel sorry for Calvin. Things really get bad when ""Her Golden Sin"" opens in Syracuse and it flops miserably. Calvin tries to help Joe and Mack in his own way but they aren't exactly appreciative! Ruth tries to convince Calvin to speak up for himself but instead Calvin buys up the entire show from Joe and Mack; now Calvin must find someone else to back the show once it opens in New York or else he'll be bankrupt!

There's more to the plot than just this; I've left out some funny scenes and I'll stop here so you can watch and enjoy this film as much as I did. Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all the issues play out.

Look also for solid performances by Vivien Oakland as Miss Martin, the star of ""Her Golden Sin;"" Ralph Ince as a man who goes simply by the name Dolan; Marion Byron as Kitty; Herman Bing as a rather opinionated chef; Nat Pendleton as a jealous husband and Richard Cramer as ""Lefty"" Duran. Spencer Charters plays Oscar and Douglas Gerrard also has a small role as a stage director.

The Tenderfoot is an excellent film for fans of Joe E. Brown and the other actors in it. Moreover, people who enjoy comedies with some romance and drama thrown in for a good effect will not be disappointed.",1367971200,5,2582,4.568034557235421
8403165,5,B003R3ZCL4,"This 1932 Joe E. Brown comedy is a dandy. He's perfectly cast as the Texas barron with lots of swagger & poise but really a giant sucker for the city slicker cons. Hence, he gets fast-talked into financing a Broadway flop by a few of these weasels. How he untangles himself from the mess he's gotten himself into is the fun. It was easy to see why Brown became one of the popular comedians of the 1930's---he combined the look of the silent clowns with the then-current talking comics. And when Joe opens that wide-slotted mouth of his, something funny's sure to come out!
A highly enjoyable comedy!",1349568000,8,599,4.555555555555555
