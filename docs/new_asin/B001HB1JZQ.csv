3627575,1,B001HB1JZQ,"Awful version of one of my favorite works. The acting swings back and forth between lackluster and cartoonishly over the top. I watched the whole thing, hoping it would improve, but it didn't. A big disappointment.",1231286400,4,214,4.972222222222222
3627576,5,B001HB1JZQ,"I do not own the DVD, but will be getting it.  Watched it on PBS this evening.  Classic, straight from the book.  The costuming is superb. Nice sets.  Kevin Kline is his usual self.  Amazingly he looks good with a long nose and lacy collar.  Jennifer Garner is a bit absurd from over acting.  Daniel Sunjata is an interesting choice for Christian and does a good job.",1231286400,5,367,4.388059701492537
3627594,1,B001HB1JZQ,dry ... might be OK if I was into old Brit Lit,1427241600,,46,2.9166666666666665
3627595,5,B001HB1JZQ,"Kevin Kline rocks Cyrano. We watch this over and over. Jennifer Garner was obviously directed to play Roxanne over the top, but still worth watching for Kline's performance.  Great intro to the theater if you have kids that you are trying to get interested in something besides action movies.",1421971200,,292,4.959183673469388
3627596,5,B001HB1JZQ,"This version of Cyrano is the best out there! it has the acting, entertainment, and vocalized clarity as to which makes it appetizing to watch! Better than the movie and other play versions",1409788800,,189,4.757575757575758
3627597,3,B001HB1JZQ,"It's difficult to imagine a better perfomance than Jose Ferrer's Oscar-winner, but much-underrated (in my opinion) Kevin Kline is one of today's great actors (my opinion) so I thought he might actually pull it off. I'll chalk it up to my long-standing love for the Ferrer film when I say I still prefer his version, but Kline is superb.

My problem with this performance is with Jennifer Garner. Other reviwers have termed her rendition as ""over the top"". I agree, but I felt that it was due to her lack of stage experience (I may be wrong, but that was my impression). I was reminded of those high school drama productions where an inexperienced cast compensates by overacting and substituting dramatic delivery with volume.

So, for me, the contrast between Kline and Garner was too distracting to fully enjoy the show, hence my 3-star rating.",1408492800,,845,4.820689655172414
3627598,5,B001HB1JZQ,"Kevin Klein gives possibly his greatest performance as the brave, brililant, but grotesquely over-schnozolad Cyrano who lives and dies with his white plume intact. In general the cast is brilliant and the play -- a classic of  witticism -- had my uncultured family cheering for more. I didn't care for Jennifer Garner's alternatingly ditzy/screeching portrayal of Roxanne -- one of the few heroines in theater who gives as good as she gets in terms of clever banter -- but I was prepared to accept the idea that being so far above everyone but Cyrano in terms of wit and intellect had driven the poor woman a little mad.",1408320000,,620,4.7407407407407405
3627599,5,B001HB1JZQ,"Kevin Kline is a unique talent, with a classic flair, a Chaplinesque sense of timing, and a relatable contemporary presence.",1401321600,,124,5.25
3627600,1,B001HB1JZQ,"This modern reading of Rostand's ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" makes use of Anthony Burgess' translation and adaptation. Lavish sets and costumes are captured in beautiful color. The well-heeled audience responds to the humor at the proper intervals. Kevin Kline does a fine job pleasing seemingly all in the house that night with his understated reading. In comparison, the rest of the cast seemed to me a little over the top.
I am not well versed in the theatre so please, do not judge this play on the merit of my opinion as I have no credentials to be a critic. I'm just a person who loves this play for the messages it so eloquently renders. The cast, while performing their lines, seems as if they're either ill-prepared or running out of air at times. Perhaps these miniscule pauses are intentional but they feel misplaced.
The greatest joys I experience from either reading or watching this story are the moments of pure vulnerability as the characters bare their deepest feelings. These moments, for me did not occur as they have when watching other stage plays or my favorite readings featuring as Cyrano,  Jose Ferrer, Peter Donat and my favorite Gerard Depardieu.",1394841600,2,1166,4.85929648241206
3627601,5,B001HB1JZQ,This was the most excellent production to accompany my class reading cyrano. All high school kids should experience good broadway,1393545600,,129,5.5
3627602,5,B001HB1JZQ,"Kevin Kline at his best. He  puts the panache in panache!  The entire cast is splendid. Timeless, classic, and witty.",1390953600,,117,4.8
3627603,5,B001HB1JZQ,A terrific story with a great cast. The movie managed to bring the vividness of the stage to life on a DVD!,1388361600,,107,3.909090909090909
3627604,5,B001HB1JZQ,"Delightfully acted and well filmed. This production allows the comic potential of Rostand's script come through, and I find Kvein Kline to be an actor who can always find that great moment in a play when a single, simple gesture can reveal a wealth of emotion and subtext.  I have used this for teaching in my theater class.  I had middle school students read the play, then we watched the movie. Also interesting for film study classes - even though this is not a film, it's interesting to contrast this modern adaptation with the Jose Ferrer film.  Even though Ferrer turns in a stellar performance, my film students found the older film difficult to invest in because Christian seemed so feminine and Rosalind so silly.  Using the two productions, I had a great place to start a discussion on the progression of gender roles from the romances of Hollywood's Golden Age until now.",1365120000,,882,4.745098039215686
3627605,5,B001HB1JZQ,I didn't expect to enjoy this...but wow! was this good! If you can get through the first 15-20 min you will be hooked...those first 15min or so are the hardest (not that it's bad) but after that ...it gets very good!,1354665600,,216,4.2926829268292686
3627606,1,B001HB1JZQ,"I know that Kevin Kline is popular and that his performance was widely praised. I have liked him in several things. But he is a terrible Cyrano. Really terrible. And it is a mystery that any man would fall for Roxanne as played by Ms Garner. If you want to see Cyrano and understand why his character is so beloved, see the Depardieu version and/or the Ferrer version. Those actors capture the soul of one of the most noble characters in literature. Depardieu's performance of the death scene is spectacular. I saw it in a theater in San Diego. When he told Roxanne that thanks to her he has had a woman friend, there were gasps and sobs from several women in the audience. You'll get no such response to Mr. Kline.",1343433600,4,715,4.424242424242424
3627607,5,B001HB1JZQ,"The only thing better then this play on DVD, would be to go New York and watch it live! This play is really done well and is a class act. The play is awesome and goes well with the movie Cyrano De Bergerac (1950).",1320019200,,213,3.8636363636363638
3627608,5,B001HB1JZQ,"Kevin Kilne's portrayal of Cyrano is so fulid and graceful. I saw the first half of this on PBS, and I fell in love with the play. The performance of Jennifer Garner is often criticized, she may not be the strongest Roxane but she is a pretty darn good one. In other review attacked the scenery, this is a staged version. I have seen the Royal Shakespeare Company production, there is less scereny in that. Also Anthony Burgess translation is amazing, it is easy to understand and follow This is a perfect show.",1309305600,,511,4.505376344086022
3627609,5,B001HB1JZQ,"Kevin Kline understands this clever translation of Edmond Rostand's play by Anthony Burgess and he delivers all the lines with panache.  The wordplay is of Shakespearean quality.  This is one of the great love stories for intellectuals.  Ah, poor Cyrano!",1283731200,,254,5.3
3627610,4,B001HB1JZQ,"Although I still favor Jose Ferrer's and Gerald Depardieu's interpretation of Rostand's ill-fated hero, this taped version of the Broadway revival still warrants your attention. Kline's take on Cyrano is a little muted compared to the other two actors but he's still effective and of course witty on occasion. As for Garner whom I think gave an understated performance in ""Juno"" she seems a bit over the top but she has her moments and is miles ahead of the vapid Mala Powers in the Ferrer film--so she's acceptable but not terrible.  As for Sunjata, I was somewhat disappointed in him since I found little in him that would make Roxanne fall for him. But Garner brings enough of the coquettishness that perhaps her broad portrayal can be forgiven and the supporting players particularly Chris Sarandon as the Captain of the guards are fine. But by all means see it for Kline's interpretation.",1266105600,6,893,4.875
3627611,4,B001HB1JZQ,"I saw this on Broadway just moments after the stagehands strike ended in December 2007. Kevin Kline takes a very understated approach to Cyrano, a character usually played with bravado and bluster. Such an approach might seem at odds with the character as written, but it really worked for me (it might be that I'm a Kevin Kline fan). His Cyrano was almost embarrassed by his acclaim, as if the people around him had built him up into a legend that he didn't want to be. Jennifer Garner and Daniel Sunjata, unfortunately, are just so-so. Roxane is such a cipher that it's hard to see what about her Cyrano is so attracted to, and without a strong personality in the role, she just kind of disappears.

I'm looking forward to seeing what was captured on video.

Now all they have to do is release ""The Seagull"" from Shakespeare in the Park 2001: Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christopher Walken, Natalie Portman, John Goodman, Marcia Gay Harden, Stephen Spinella, Larry Pine, Debra Monk, directed by Mike Nichols. Best thing I've ever seen on a stage.",1260748800,2,1071,4.752688172043011
3627612,5,B001HB1JZQ,"Kevin Kline gives an excellent performance as Cyrano.  The performance, staging, are so good in fact that even the verses seem contemporary.  My teen age children enjoyed it, and I bought it because my sixteen year old son saw half of it on vacation and wanted to see the whole thing.",1256342400,,284,4.549019607843137
3627613,5,B001HB1JZQ,"One of the best performances I have ever seen. Wonderful story, but extremely sad at the end. I cannot express how highly I recommend this.",1235606400,7,139,4.6
3627614,5,B001HB1JZQ,"A phenominal cast.  Extremely entertaining.  Kevin Kline is superb.  Jennifer Garner and Chris Sarandon are great additions to this classic romance. Cyrano is a must have.  You'll watch it over and over again and find new nuances everytime.  A shining example of what the best of Broadway has to offer.

3627615,5,B001HB1JZQ,"I was fortunate enough to see Jose Ferrer recreate his movie Cyrano de Bergerac in the 70's, live in Nyack, NY and spoke to Mr. Ferrer afterwards. Although he was the Sean Connery, in James Bond movies, of Cyranos, I must say that Kevin Kline and Jennifer Garner did a wonderful job as well. Their performance was much funnier than the original screen version. Jennifer Garner was alive and vibrant, which was missing from all other renditions.",1234742400,7,444,4.779220779220779
3627616,5,B001HB1JZQ,i am a big theatre buff and normally don't like straight plays. This show though is one of my faverates! It is one of the only 3 straight plays i want to be in as an actor! You will really enjoy this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1234310400,2,218,4.093023255813954
3627617,1,B001HB1JZQ,"Cyrano would have certainly challenged everyone involved in this lamentable production had he seen it. Kevin Kline was robotic and Jennifer Garner was wooden. The sets were ugly and sparse and the directing aimless.

See if you can find the French movie version. It is absolutely thrilling.",1234137600,4,290,5.170212765957447
3627618,3,B001HB1JZQ,"Taped during a performance in a large Bdway theater, with many cameras and American movie/tv stars to lure the public,this French stalwart emerges rather flavorless and indigestible. It was designed, directed, and performed for proscenium viewing, so the up-close cinematic techniques of the dvd work against it and coarsen everything. Kevin Kline has the chops for a good Cyrano but is not permitted to take flight--at least his vocal delivery is polished American, no exaggerated volume required. In his buffoon ""Moon"" soliloquy he rather imitates Robin Williams. Jennifer Garner is a marionette with the director frantically jerking her strings, and her girlish delivery degrades precious Roxanne--she runs through lines with no finesse. Daniel Sunyata plays the lovelorn verbally challenged airhead Christian, so just be handsome and relieved you are not required to deliver any poetry or wit--this role is pretty much a foil for Cyrano and Roxanne. Most of the dialogue seems rushed like a pie eating contest so neither actor nor listener has a chance to savor it. So this here dvd is educational, but to be moved and thrilled just pick up a copy of the play and read it.",1233619200,11,1176,5.130208333333333
3627619,5,B001HB1JZQ,"My husband and I watched Cyrano on the recommendation of our local newspaper's tv critic.  It is the best thing I've seen lately.  Kevin Kline was fabulous as Cyrano, the rest of the cast does an admirable job as well.  My only disappointment is that the show is no longer playing on Broadway; if I had known, I would have gone to see it live.  I guess, the DVD will have to do. ;)",1232323200,5,381,4.108108108108108
3627620,3,B001HB1JZQ,"Garner was awkward and unbelievable. She should stick to Alias... Sarandon, Kline (especially) and the rest of the major actors did a splendid job. I enjoyed this for the most part!",1231804800,3,181,4.870967741935484
3627621,1,B001HB1JZQ,"This version of Cyrano is just too awful to watch! With the notable exception of Kevin Kline, the acting is dreadful, and far worse than the average high school production of Cyrano. Don't waste your time on this one.",1231459200,5,217,4.589743589743589
3627622,5,B001HB1JZQ,"I thought the play was wonderful.  Kline and the rest of the cast were fabulous, I didn't think I would like it, but before I knew it 2 1/2 hours was over.  My only complaint is that I found Jennifer Garner sort of obnoxious and overdone or something. I just couldn't see why any man let alone two men would fall so in love with here.  But her rendition of Roxanne takes nothing away from the show.  Highly recommend.",1231459200,19,417,4.2405063291139244
3627623,5,B001HB1JZQ,I had the opportunity to see this during its Broadway run.  The PBS presentation is a wonderful reminder of my Broadway experience.  Kevin Kline is outstanding.  I can't wait to own this.,1231286400,6,187,4.78125

8308298,3,B001HB1JZQ,Seemed too out of touch with the depth of the play. Too much was about trying to make the story funny--which it is--and not enough about the deep pain of Cyrano's lifelong fight to reject before he is rejected.,1464480000,,210,4.410256410256411
8308299,5,B001HB1JZQ,This has been the best Cyrano de Bergerac I've ever seen. Kevin Kline nails his performance as Cyrano. It was sort of a love triangle with Roxanne deciding to love either Christian or Cyrano.,1447113600,,191,4.647058823529412

8308303,2,B001HB1JZQ,Jennifer Garner ruined this play.  Every time should opened her mouth it felt like a high school production which distracted me from the seriousness of the play.  Kevin Klein did his best to make up for her sh*tty acting.,1431820800,,221,4.641025641025641
