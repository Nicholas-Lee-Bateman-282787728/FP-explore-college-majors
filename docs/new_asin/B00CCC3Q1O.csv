8580202,2,B00CCC3Q1O,"You can't judge a movie by its cover. This appeared to me to be similar to The Men Who Built America and World Wars, also put out by History Channel. Those movies had great acting and new and exciting narrating and cinematography. This was not at all like that. It's just an old-style, typical documentary that you would sleep through at school.",1439856000,,345,4.580645161290323
