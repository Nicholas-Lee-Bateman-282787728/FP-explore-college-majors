4641009,5,B005AKG8BU,"After doing this DVD the first time, I wanted to write a review, but I simply could remember what the disc was like. Now, after a second time, I kind of felt like, ""what happened to me during the last hour?"" again. Janet has a lot of original poses or pose cominations(or at least they seem original to my experience!), so that I can't lay my finger down on it and say, ""OK, now she is doing this type of thing."" She kind of blows my conception of things, of how poses combine or flow. She adds new twists, arm balances, stretches, bends...things which are similar to things I have done, but different.

This is an intermediate disc, sometimes challenging, but not overwhelming. There are a lot of vinyassas, lunge combinations, standing splits, chair pose combinations. As I try to remember (and I just finished the disc now), I can't remember exactly!

You can always tell if a yoga teacher has actually spent time in India, and Janet has. The filming is creative, the stage set artistic and full of plays with light. The music is Eastern,  soothing, inspiring, carefully picked. The commentary is mature, interesting, real.

Overall, I would say that Janet has an honest practice. She is honest in what she says, and she is honest in her poses. If a pose wasn't exactly working for her, she changed it. She isn't afraid to do something something slightly unconventional. As I follow her flow, I thing, ""Yes, this stretch is really what my body is asking for right now."" She charts new ground led by her honesty, where she wants to go in the moment, what she wants to say. For fans of Vinyassa practice who are open to charting new territory, this is a disc not to be missed.",1320796800,4,1677,4.543046357615894
4641010,5,B005AKG8BU,"Bliss in motion is right.  Every Janet Stone DVD to date regardless of the intensity level makes me feel invigorated. The Ananda Vinyasa is no exception.  Janet's sequence, impeccable instruction and soothing voice makes me feel so powerful yet graceful.  I feel alive in a calm way. Even though I enjoy going to class I love these DVDs because I notice something different within my body each and every time.  Thanks for your dedication Janet and thanks for these 3 new amazing DVDs.",1317600000,2,484,4.795180722891566
4641011,5,B005AKG8BU,"As a yoga teacher and a devoted practitioner, I have been fortunate enough to practice with many amazing teachers from all around the world. Similarly, over the years I have watched literally every single yoga DVD I could get my hands on, always looking for the same three qualities I look for in a teacher: passion, innovation, and artistry. No one embodies these qualities quite like Janet Stone.

Janet Stone is a wonder; truly one of the most radiant and inspiring teachers I have ever known. Passion? She has it and then some. Her love for yoga, and the joy that sharing the practice bring her is self-evident. Innovation? Absolutely. Janet's sequences are some of the most innovative and exciting I have ever experienced. Artistry? No question. Just watching Janet flow from pose to pose is revelatory. Join her and you begin to create art yourself in collaboration with her golden voice and superb soundtrack.

This DVD exudes all of these qualities before you even press play, as the production quality of the packaging and disc pressing is first class in every respect. Everything you experience once the video is rolling is similarly phenomenal, from the menus to the soundtrack to the words of wisdom and meditation that permeate the practice. A bargain at any price. You deserve this practice.",1316563200,3,1305,4.927272727272728
4641012,5,B005AKG8BU,"I documented the scenes to this DVD, but as I completed the practice I realized that listing the poses could not do it justice.  I loved this sequence, a combination of strength, balance, core work, but also grace and balance.  I did have some problems with my knee during one of the sequences but think it could be easily altered.  I might have liked it if the side plank balances were held just a little longer since I have the strength but usually enter into them a bit wobbly before balancing. But all in all, this is an excellent practice. I love Janet's voice, her guidance through the practice.  I highly recommend this DVD to those at an intermediate+ level.

Here are the scenes:

Invocation (3:32):  A standing meditation

Igniting the Fire (2:20):  A pranayama between mountain and forward bend, and then warming up, moving several times between downward dog to plank.

Slow and Low (10:17):  The first movement is downward dog, low lunge, half splits, plank (one leg raised with toes against opposite heel), and Chaturanga.  Transition poses are forward bend, chair pose variations, and gentle stretches. Returning to the first movement again, this time tucking one leg to chest during plank and adding upward facing dog.  Ends repeating the transition poses again including several more variations of chair pose.

Lubrication (10:11):  This sequence builds on the main movement in Slow and Low,  replacing the half splits with pyramid pose, and the plank variations with side plank/Vasisthasana variations.  There is a brief forward bend transition, and then standing poses are added into the sequence - side angle, warrior II, reverse warrior, and triangle. Ends in child pose.

Expanding around the heart (4:44):  Dolphin, forearm plank moving hips from side to side, sphinx, cobra. Rest in crocodile, a variation on locust pose, and ends in downward dog.

Balancing Acts (6:51):  Continues to build on the previous sequences. Includes downward dog to plank variations, side plank balance variations increasing in challenge, and then building to optional Eka Pada Koundiyanasana.  There is also a nice crescent pose sequence that includes stepping out of crescent into a single leg balance with one knee raised and twisted side angle pose. Ends in child's pose.

Metta (loving-kindness) (2:29): Sit in a wide leg kneeling position, spiraling the sacrum/lower back.  Ends with a nice wrist/hand stretch.

Dance of Shiva (13:14):  Builds on `Balancing Acts', including a variation of Visvamitrasana if you are able and more standing balances. There is a sequence that includes standing splits, moving to a kneeling position with one leg folded under, and then table pose with that same leg angled under.  I may have to modify this sequence as it gave a slight tweak to my knee (that hasn't been bothered by yoga for about 2 years). Also includes some seated twists.  There are quite a few poses from this sequence that I did not list.

Shoulder expansion (6:50):  Mostly shoulder stretches, but also includes a few backbends.

Taking a seat (7:16): Seated twists and stretches. Ends with reverse plank or table pose, and then more seated stretches.

Setting it down (3:30): Supine stretches, plow pose, shoulder stand with leg variations, seated forward bend.

4641013,5,B005AKG8BU,Janet Stone is a genius yoga instructor!!! I would recommend this DVD to every yogi everywhere. Add this to your yoga DVD collection!!!,1314144000,,135,4.913043478260869
4641014,5,B005AKG8BU,"Wow!  Once again, Janet Stone has produced a rockin' yoga video series.
Ananda Vinyasa is strikingly beautiful to watch. Set to awesome music Janet offers up unique, challenging and inspiring movement, guiding us to connect the breath to the poses.
Janet's warm gentle voice, inviting and nurturing, clearly guides us through every nuance of movement, a rich paring with her impeccable demonstration of the poses.
I also highly recommend her previous videos, Radiant Flow and Mellow Flow.
Do I sound like a fan?  You bet!",1313971200,4,521,5.117647058823529
4641015,5,B005AKG8BU,"When it comes to Janet Stone DVDs, my philosophy is why have only one when I can have all of them. Each one of her offerings is unique and dynamic. This one has some great lunges, splits, and arm-strengthening poses. I usually prefer to attend a yoga class rather than clear my furniture to make space for a home session. But ever since I discovered Janet's DVDs, I've found myself rolling up my rug and unrolling my mat for a challenging workout from this inspiring, compassionate guide.",1313625600,2,488,4.620689655172414
4641016,5,B005AKG8BU,"Since discovering Janet Stone yoga it's practically the only yoga I want to do. Ananda, however, is a tough practice. As opposed to its companion dvd of Ganesha, Ananda is performed practically all standing. There are lots of warrior lunge variations and some seriously challenging shoulder stretches, but when I am finished I feel stretched out, exhausted and happy. The setting is gorgeous, just Janet on an elevated platform in a sunny room with some candles and a Ganesh figure. The music is great, and Janet's voice is pleasant. If you want a challenging but unique flow, don't pass this one up.",1312588800,,600,4.892156862745098
4641017,5,B005AKG8BU,"This is another fun and creative vinyasa yoga from Janet Stone. The focus of this practice is backbends. It is a pretty fast paced vinyasa practice with no long holds of poses that includes a lot of low lunges, half splits and side plank variations. There's also arm balances like Eka Pada Koundiyanasana II and Mayurasana, standing balances like  Natarajasana (king dancer) and standing half splits and bow pose, I wish there was a wheel pose too. I like that in between those sweaty vinyasas you get a few moments of rest like a nice wrist stretch. In the end there's some great supine stretches and shoulderstand. The music is great and you might recognize some from Yoga Shakti. The production quality is also exellent. Definitely recommended for intermediate+ vinyasa yogis.",1310860800,7,779,4.9465648854961835
4641018,5,B005AKG8BU,"I fell in love with Radiant Flow last time, but this time there is something that has finally clicked for me in this new DVD by Janet. Its a sense of awareness in the practice; not only with the breath but the way Janet reminds us to live in gratitude in the motions of the asana; especially if she says a second set ;-)
If you want a challenge but also want peace, gratitude and fun, you need this dvd.  XX Jai Ma! Xjess",1310601600,,421,4.011904761904762

8463333,3,B005AKG8BU,"I've been doing yoga for the past 11 years, aside from live classes my favorite DVDs are: YogaTopia the Art of Vinyasa Flow with Litsa Kapantais, Karen Voight Yoga Power, Bryan Kest Power Yoga, Power Yoga Total Body with Rodney Yee, Shiva Rea Yoga Shakti (moon flow is my fave), and I also like Flow and Yin a Balanced Yoga Practice with Donna Helm-Yost. Compare to all these Ananda Vinyasa didn't do for me what I am used to getting from my practice. I ended up with a tension headache and nearly nauseous and dizzy, not relaxed at all. It's too 'busy' and fast, too many poses and therefore non stop talking, I had to keep having to keep my eyes on the screen and holding my breath just to follow everything and keep up. Other DVDs that I like are much better paced and more balanced and relaxing. This was just a good work out, fast moving, many repetitions. Near the end I had to mute it because I was sick of the talking. This could be better with some poses cut out, like some variations and some repetitions, so there would be less need to commenting, and more even pacing. Some poses are held longer while others go too fast and are too short. I think I might end up selling this DVD or gifting it, don't see myself doing it again, my body got a good work out, but I don't feel well as I always do after yoga, this didn't even feel much like yoga to me. However, setting is nice and flow itself is beautiful just to watch (on mute).",1377216000,,1440,4.24
8463334,5,B005AKG8BU,I now have the complete collection of Janet's DVD's and wish I lived in her area so that I could attend her classes!  I can't even go back to other routines because I love her flows so much.  They are physically challenging and spiritual bliss at the same time!,1373155200,,261,4.3061224489795915
8463335,5,B005AKG8BU,"This DVD is yet another wonderful offering from Janet Stone. It is a quiet, contemplative practice balanced with strong poses. Great for the intermediate practioner and those with a home practice. Love it!",1362700800,,205,5.242424242424242
8463336,4,B005AKG8BU,I have really enjoyed this video so far. The workout itself is very good (if a little heavy on the standing poses). And the stretches at the end are just wonderful.,1353715200,,164,4.32258064516129
8463337,5,B005AKG8BU,"I'm an advanced beginner so there are sections of this sequence that certainly won't be accessible to me for quite some time.  That being said, I still get tremendous value and enjoyment from this DVD.  I just stay in the more basic pose until the more advanced extension of the sequence is complete and then rejoin where I can.  I like seeing the more advanced poses though. They give me something to work towards someday.  The music is great and I really enjoy the smooth way Janet choreographs her flows.  She also has a subtle humor and a great presence that comes through even on video.",1340928000,3,591,4.537735849056604
8463338,5,B005AKG8BU,"This DVD is just wonderful. I'd consider my practice to be beginner to intermediate. I was able to keep up. Janet offered some nice modifications and demonstrated a few floats that blew my mind. The flow slowly built the ""fire,"" and brought you through a calming cooldown. It's long, so I doubt I'll get it in more than once a week, but it felt comfortable and right.",1339804800,3,367,4.492537313432836
8463339,4,B005AKG8BU,"I really enjoyed this.  This is definately not for beginners.  Janet has a unique way of flowing the movements together and creating new ways of doing and being in yoga postures.  It runs about and hour and a half so make sure you have the time to devote to it.  The only thing I did not like was the very short savasana time, but you could lie longer if you like.",1329436800,2,364,4.084507042253521
8463340,5,B005AKG8BU,"I bought this DVD almost immediately after purchasing Janet's Radiant Flow.  Now I have trouble deciding which is my favorite yoga DVD: Ananda Vinyasa or Radiant Flow.  Radiant Flow is better for me on the days when I want something really energizing, and I love Ananda when I am in the mood to be very introspective.

The Instructor:  Janet's narration is excellent.  The practice is very creative, but her guidance makes it very easy to follow.  She is one of the very few instructors who I feel like I can ""trust"" to take care of me the whole way through.  In addition to excellent cuing, her commentary is very inspiring.  She reminds you continuously to appreciate your body and what it does for you.
The Practice:  As I mentioned above, the sequence is excellent.  She does a lot of backbending in this one.  Usually this is troublesome for me because it seems like most DVDs don't counterpose the backbends adequately, but that's not the case here.  Everything flows beautifully as if she can anticipate exactly what my body is going to need at each moment in the practice.
The Music:  Absolutely perfect.  It adjusts throughout the practice so it complements what you are doing very well.

Before buying Radiant Flow I was a bit unsure because the DVDs are relatively expensive.  But there is a reason you can't find anything from Janet Stone used.  This practice is worth every penny and more; I'm even debating buying an extra copy in case I ""need"" this practice some day and for whatever reason my current DVD won't play.  I've been practicing yoga for 7 years and have worked with a lot of instructors and DVDs.  Janet is the best I have come across:  better in my opinion than Shiva Rea, Baron Baptiste, Bryan Kest, Seane Corn, Rodney Yee, and the list goes on.  Her practice has clear Shiva Rea influences, but I really like the way her DVDs are put together more than Shiva's.",1322179200,4,1891,4.635542168674699
