3448265,4,B00009IB3B,"Eminem's performance was flawless.  I would love to see him do some more acting.  He has a very powerful and stark presence with no ""BS"".  Brittany Murphy was quite startling and colorful in her performance as well.  It did a great job of painting the full picture of his harsh environment and many stresses.

My only issue is with the script. I would have liked to see him work his way up to delivering a rap performance (like ""Lose Yourself""), to an appreciative audience, i.e., achieving the pinnacle of success, rather than having the culmination be the rap battle.  However, that was quite powerful as well, and something he did do in real life. I also felt that the rivalry between the two rap gangs was overdramatic.

I also think they could have had fewer buddies and given them more meaningful lines.  Often they were all bantering and there was rap music in the background and I couldn't hear what any of them were saying, but on the other hand it was not important. Mekhi Phifer was great as his best friend, and it was nice to see Kim Basinger, who also did a great job.",1472342400,,1082,4.48469387755102
3448266,3,B00009IB3B,A little slow for my taste. Limited development in plot or character despite the whole theme surrounding the main character's growth.,1471824000,,133,5.380952380952381

Inasmuch as one can take a snap shot, if you will, of a particular space in time of a life (of which I know nothing about) it has amazing beauty on the dark side of life's spectrum. This is not to say there is no light, it is all perspective and on a spectrum.  Holding a kind of magic in any color. Beautiful, scary, wonderful, dangerous, everything and nothing... Etc.

It had me laughing and crying in many parts of the movie. You could tell there was a lot of heart put into this movie. Eminem was amazing as an actor and I would love to see him in something else like this. If you don't already appreciate the art of Rap, this movie will show you how incredible it can be.

3448280,2,B00009IB3B,"The only thing I liked about this movie, was how well Eminem can rap. The movie is BORING, no real plot; apart from Eminem showing off that he could rap better then other guys at the end. A lot of unnecessary profanity, and a few sex scenes that did not need to be a part of the movie. Rented it to watch with my teen, and I had to quickly fast forward due to those parts. Don't waste your time and money on this one.",1468540800,,417,3.9176470588235293

3448282,4,B00009IB3B,"I consider this movie a slow burn. Its one that requires patience to let develop.  The payoff  especially for those who appreciate the art of rapping  is worth the wait. The entire movie builds for the final sequences.

The main character, aptly played by Eminem, lives and works in a gritty part of Detroit. Even the hues in the film are muted to add to the dismal environment that Rabbit is trying to endure.  Rabbit has skills, and his friends know he has skills; hes just got to bring it. As his talent and confidence grow each of Rabbits friends have different ideas of what success looks like for him, as well as how success might look for each member of the group.  One by one, Rabbit realizes that how his friends define success is not how he defines success. They all want the external rewards; Rabbit wants to overcome his challenges while being true to himself.  As obstacles and opportunities present themselves  such as his work at the factory, his situation with his mom, participating in rap battles, and encouragement from Brittany Murphys character  Rabbit grows in his determination and conviction.

Without giving away too much, in the final scenes/rap battle, he realizes who he is, accepts it, and proudly proclaims it, and in doing so, establishes a line that he dares others to cross.  It took the whole movie to percolate and boil over to have this dramatic ending. To me, the final sequence was so effective it made me want to know what happens next to Rabbit. This movie has no happy ending, per se; its more like witnessing the metamorphosis of a character. It would take another movie to see how far Rabbit goes with his skills and confidence.  If you're into music/rap, consider giving this movie a shot. Be patient, watch the whole thing, note how Rabbits relationships with his friends change and deepen, and see how this plays out in the end.

3448283,2,B00009IB3B,"I don't get this movie.  It doesn't have much of a story to tell so do not expect to learn anything about Eminem, I hear it's only loosely based on him anyway.  It just shows him in the club trying to insult rap- little else.  Movie needs more of everything!  More drama, more detail, more story, better acting, better everything.

3448318,4,B00009IB3B,"Far better than I expected.

Despite being a fan of Eminem's music for over a decade, I didn't see ""8 Mile"" in all that time, probably because I did see Fifty Cent's ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" and wasn't enthralled by it; I foolishly assumed ""8 Mile"" would be the same deal. Le wrong. ""8 Mile"" was a very artistic film, one of those rare movies that uses music well, without trying to hard to be ""dramatic"" or ""heartwarming."" There isn't much of a plot, but the tone of the movie absolutely engrossed me, in the same way that ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""The Big Chill,"" and ""Heavy Traffic"" did.

For the record, I normally have no interesting in ""realistic"" movies, preferring sci-fi and fantasy. But there is a small list of ""real life"" movies I love, and this one is now on it. ""8 Mile"" really does inspire an aspiring writer or artist of any kind, without falling into the cliches of most corny ""inspiring"" movies.",1458172800,,912,4.4879518072289155

3448384,5,B00009IB3B,"In 8 Mile, we are introduced to a youth who believes that his ticket to success in life is through a rap career.  He plans to achieve this by participating in battle raps.  He has setbacks that involve his own securities and dealing with racial expectations.  Throughout the film he begins to see that the better path in life would be to set more realistic goals in order to be successful.

 The message of the film is two fold.  While an individual can succeed by setting those goals and compromising on their dreams from childhood; a community can also prosper when it's citizens pull together and focus on what needs to be done.  This message is not lost on the director of this film. The setting of this film is in the city of Detroit.  A city that has fallen on hard times with the how the economy has come out over the last decade.  Several times throughout the film there are instances that show the apathy and regression of the city of Detroit while the characters stagnate.

 It is only by experiencing where his life is heading and what decisions have the most value can our main character able to move past his stagnation and begin to grow.  This tends to be true in reality as it is easy to have a perfect idea of what someone wants their life to turn out as but it is harder to accept that that always can't be the case.  Sometimes a person has to find their niche in order to find some success in life.  This doesn't always bring about instant happiness but the acceptance of this fact always the growth to happen to earn your own happiness.",1440374400,,1555,4.372822299651568

Moreover, Eminem being white is the best irony of this movie considering that the hiphop scene is predominated by the African-Americans which made me conclude that the deeper meaning of this story is the equality of both races.",1436227200,,471,4.619047619047619

3448411,5,B00009IB3B,"Eminem stars in a very dark version of ""You Got Served."" This movie is about a young man born into a very unfortunate situation: a white man living in poverty in Detroit. Of course, Eminem knows the world is against him but he got to make it somehow. That somehow is by way of his musical talent. Throughout the movie we see Eminem's struggles from living in a trailer with his mom, to working hard for very little money, and we see that he gets tricked by people he thought were on his side. The movie ends with a climactic scene where Eminem faces his enemies in a rap battle. This rap battle was just so profound that not only did it shut down his adversaries but it also caused everyone to like him. At the end of the movie Eminem walks off to work but somehow prouder.

To say the least, I have no clue what happened in this movie. I get all the parts where Eminem tries to make it through a very hard life but the ending made zero sense. He won a rap battle. Okay, and now what? What is the meaning of this? He doesn't gain anything, other than perhaps his pride. Overall this movie made zero sense and the purpose at the end was really for nothing. We had to sit through an hour and a half of watching someone struggle only to just walk off casually like, ""Yeah whatever, I got to go back to work.""

The movie features an all star cast. You got Eminem in the front but you got Kim Basinger playing as Eminem dysfunctional mother, Mrs Smith. One of the movies heartwarming moments is when Mrs Smith came back to the trailer with a bag of grocery only to reveal that she won a game of bingo and their luck turning around after a failed lawsuit with her ex-boyfriend who got up and left.

You also got a post-Clueless actress Brittany Murphy who plays Alex. She's somewhat into Eminem and they have a special bond between the two. However this relationship isn't exactly innocent. Behind the scenes Alex is trying to make it big as well by having a relationship with anyone she things is going to be successful. But whatever it was at the end of the movie we release Alex is moving away but Eminem is cool about it like, ""yeah whatever see ya around"" and just walk up like, ""Hey yo I got to get back to work.""

Overall even though this movie ended rather silly I got to admit it had a lasting effect on me. I recall watching this in my senior year of highschool and to be quite honest whenever things get ridiculous I recall various scenes from this movie. This movie is very powerful albeit a little bit on the odd side. If anything, you should watch this. It had some very intense moments and I got to admit the cast all worked together very well.",1435881600,,2653,4.257936507936508

Some of the language could have been toned down, but reality is. that's the way it is, language, behavior, etc.  Shows how to stand up for yourself, you don't have to fold under peer pressure. Not only did this young man strive to reach his goal with his music, he also remembered there were everyday responsibilities he had to maintain.  Sorry to say facts are, this is the way the average person lives, struggle for everyday things, things are not handed to you , like it was in 'Leave it to Beaver'. Not everyone has a nice house, two parent families, food, easy life, fancy clothes, or even a childhood. This is movie is several years old, but the message is timeless, it is REAL!! Rabbit's music was his escape, it was his balance. If you are looking for a cutesy movie, a feel good fantasy rags to riches movie, this is not it! This gives you a slight peek into a blue collars' life, no sugar coating, no pretending. I bought this for my nephew, a teenager, he was rooting for Rabbit during the faceoff, later we discussed how hard his life was. Good eye opener for these kids today!!!

3448466,4,B00009IB3B,"Rapper Eminem (Jimmy or Rabbit, his nickname) lives in destitution or penury (for lack of a euphemism, the ghetto or skid row) with his mother in a rented trailer in Detroit, in 1995. Early in the movie, he is on stage at a local amateur hip-hop competition. A throng of hundreds watch when he is paralyzed by fear or stage freight, and he is booed off by a overwhelmingly black audience. In these competitive skirmishes, the challenger goes up against the prior week's title holder. These two opponents square off with all the intensity of a sporting event such as a boxing match. Instead of hurling punches, they use poetic conversational lyrics to a rhythmic musical accompaniment to attack their adversary. In hip-hop fashion, acrimonious and scurrilous language is used to deride and disparage opponent. It takes a certain degree of wit in these impromptu philippic diatribes, and whoever is deemed more clever wins the approval and plaudits of their peers. In Jimmy's close-knit, inner circle of friends, mostly black, there is fervent warmth and he, being white, is well liked. In 2014, Eminem, was the number 1 streamed artist with ""Slim Shady"" streamed 331 million times according to Spotify. His album ""Shady XV"" was the 5th highest in first-week sales at 138K.",1418688000,,1271,4.971830985915493

3448507,5,B00009IB3B,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...

I saw 8 Mile (2002) in the theater when it came out.  I'm finally reviewing it!  For anybody who isn't from the Detroit area or doesn't know much about this movie and its title, 8 Mile stands for 8 Mile Rd., which is the dividing line or northern border of Detroit.  South of 8 Mile Rd. is Detroit; north of 8 Mile Rd. is the suburbs.  Anyway, 8 Mile is a movie about a rapper from the hood who tries to get somewhere in the world of rap music.  Along the way, he participates in rapping contests at various Detroit nightclubs.  Does he succeed?  Watch to find out.

This movie is raw, edgy, full of profanity, and very much reality-based.  It's loosely based on Marshall Mathers' (Eminem's) life.  Eminem does a good job acting.  The music throughout the movie fits the scenes very well.  Brittany Murphy's acting was good as well.  Kim Basinger was OK as Eminem's mother, but her hairstyle seemed too current and neat for the character she was playing (just my opinion).  This movie manages to pull this viewer into the story.  This movie can have a powerful impact on certain viewers, depending on who they are.  This movie is not for everyone - some people love it, some people hate it.  It's for you to decide.  Personally, I liked it and I give it 5 stars.

Just a quick story...

I saw Eminem at a local haunted attraction in October 2001 during the time this movie was being filmed.  He was wearing a Jason Voorhees (Friday The 13th) hockey mask and scaring people.",1402444800,,1579,4.463157894736842
3448508,4,B00009IB3B,"I found 8 Mile to be a very enjoyable movie, thus exceeding my expectations. I'm not a rap fan, so I initially thought that I wouldn't enjoy this movie. I was wrong. Even more unexpected is the fact that Eminem gives a great performance in his acting debut; he seems to be a natural on the silver screen. I found his acting to be very genuine and real. Kim Basinger does a fine job as well, though it took some time to get used to her in her role as a struggling mother in a rough neighborhood. This movie has depth behind all the swearing, violence, etc. Detroit is depicted as poor, bleak, and violent in this movie, and we never see the downtown area and its buildings. This was most likely done to give the movie a rougher edge, and show the neighborhoods as a place of immense struggling. Whatever the case, this movie delivers, and surprisingly does so on an emotional level as well; Eminem's character shows compassion for others, and some of his friends do likewise. The only criticism I have of the acting is that it felt like some of the scenes depicting threats and violence seemed to display a small degree of tentativeness, as if the actors were holding back a tad bit, thus not making certain scenes totally believable. This is just my opinion, and I deem these miscues as minor. Overall, 8 Mile is a good movie that shows a struggle to make it out of an undesirable environment. The special features are interesting as well.",1402358400,,1439,4.475285171102661

3448513,5,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile is sort of a 118-minute way of condensing Eminem's journey to fame through the eyes of a fictional character ALMOST exactly like Em, but slightly different, who goes by the name ""B-Rabbit"".

He also gets to make out with beautiful blond bombshell Brittany Murphy, if you're into that (we miss you Brittany, R.I.P.)

It is extremely entertaining from start to finish and cathartic for anyone who has gone through serious dysfunctional relationships, got cheated on, or struggled in one way or another to make a reputation out of their talent, and hopefully, get the Hell out of that trailer park.

It was cathartic to me for all 3 of those reasons!

The coolest part of the whole movie?

Awesome rap battles from start to finish. You won't believe the @#$%@$%% that can fly out of this guy's mouth at like, 256802087639596 miles an hour.

The only thing that went un-mentioned in the movie was Eminem's drug addiction (which many of his fans are familiar with.)
I wish I could have re-wrote the movie to replace his prescription drug habit with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Limitless-NZT-48/dp/B00AS662GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Limitless NZT-48</a>.

I think it would have made him become Rap God a lot faster, and maybe even a little more easily as well.

Oh well. Time to see if this NZT can make me the legend I want to be, in half the time.

3448533,1,B00009IB3B,"This film (and here I would use the term very lightly), does nothing to match the ""grand"" hope clip about ""struggling and being some sort of a hero"". I always recommend that anyone in the audience of any film look to the story, tyne script, the acting, and the production of the film. You will be hard pressed to find any of that here.

Does, Eninem (Marshall Bruce Mathers, III) rap - yes; is he the first ""white boy"" to do so - no (try Vanilla Ice of seven years earlier for starters); is he rather angry - well, if you use the F*** word in the script as a measuring device he isn't angry he is just clueless!

There is no doubt that there is a market for such &$#@! among the teenage/angst or 313 crowd but as far as presenting any ""socially redeeming qualities"", this use of film and digits has set the bar to an all new low.

Aside from the visceral regurgitation resulting from the film as a whole, there is the really poor quality of the script (see the 4-letter quotient mentioned above as an example), the overall story (where the ""clueless"" comment comes from), the absolutely low-brow usage of anything female (mother, former girlfriend, current squeeze, etc - and here I would suspect anything female that crawls), the level of gratuitous violence incorporated throughout; and the ludicrous refinement of Eminem using ""Thank you's"" and ""Please"" for the shock value as punctuation between the continuous string of F-words; just underscores how little value is actually present.

Look real hard and you might even recognize that Kim Bassinger is attempting to play Eminem's mother - for whatever that role must have been worth. In short, acting was not the purpose of the film, rather it is merely a peon to a bunch of clueless people living clueless lives.

Exposure to this film leaves nothing in its passing except dust and the long efforts necessary to reconstruct what this film trashes. No one under the age of 25 should be allowed to watch this and then only if they have something really heavy to hang on to for some sort of stability.",1393891200,,2053,4.6136986301369864

realistic, gritty Detroit and how Eminem rises from 8 mile to 8 million mile on sheer guts,grit, perseverence,despite a gun cultured, trailer/auto factory paycheck to paycheck existence, overcoming the odds, humility, brashness, dreams, hope, setbacks, belief.

God's gift of talent teamed with an immersion of the music of the time with a 24/7 obsession with creating raps and rhymes about life in the hard blue collar, industrial world and the drive to get out

from rejection to release and embrace , E transforms ""the Shelter"" from a place of hostile cold to a conquest by a man who at first doesn't fit in and is exalted at the pinnacle of his performance.  As he walks alone in an alley he almost grins to himself knowing he is well on his way...

Although partly autobiographical, the script is a fictional tale about a down-and-out white kid in Detroit trying to make his way in the black-dominated genre of rap, and Eminem is totally credible, including his interactions with Brittany Murphy, who plays his love interest, and Kim Basinger, who delivers a gut-wrenching performance as his beleagured mom.

The Scottish Highlanders proudly display their colours and bagpipes with a deep history of life and death and battles, this movie does that too. Any person that ever played in a school band will appreciate the intensity of this movie. Eminem did a great job making you believe in the movie, you forget he is a star while you watch him struggle to live. The motor city ""Detroit"" is pasted all over this film, so East/West coast might not ""show the love"", but you know they saw it and deep down liked it.",1359763200,,770,4.429577464788732

And the lead character has a dog meets girl relationship while doing his job. This isn't anything worth noting in a positive way. It is an example of the bad role model as bad role model mentality that is being sold to the public, and a mother that's an immoral or amoral person who's the same.

3448623,3,B00009IB3B,"First off, shipping was very quick (two days), so to pay more for a faster delivery is probably unnecessary.  I'm a huge Eminem fan, and I think his acting was very good.  Some things I liked were the way it starts off, and explains the setting very well.  The rap battles at the end are perfect, but they are short and the film would have been better with more.  Dislikes about the movie are the seemingly pointless events that go on towards the middle of the film.  Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but for those who don't know Eminem's life story this film wouldn't make too much sense, as the main character, Rabbit, is very similar to Eminem and faces many challenges that the real-life singer did.  For the price however, this is a great buy for those that may just want to add to their DVD collection.",1335916800,,809,4.4324324324324325
3448624,4,B00009IB3B,"As publicity-focused biopics go, 8 Mile is one of the better-executed examples. Although it's self-serving at times, this is also an impressively open and honest take on Eminem's roots and the self-imposed blockade of excuses he laid out for himself before catching so much as a whiff of stardom. The plot outside of Mr. Marshall Mathers is fairly simplistic and limited, though, with most of the cast simply orbiting the star and reacting to his angry, frustrated outbursts. I found the battle raps to be as intense and exciting as a good action scene, and the choice to limit them to a few key moments was a smart move that doubled their importance. Eminem himself is startlingly good in the lead role; it may not too much of a stretch to play yourself in the cinematic story of your own rise to fame, but I've certainly seen plenty try and fail. Authentic, street-smart inspiration that offers a fresh take on a tired old tale.",1334966400,,930,4.676829268292683
3448625,5,B00009IB3B,"The bargain-basement movie for last night was ""8 Mile"" staring Eminem. Well, I've never particularly cared for Rap music or it's Hip-Hop cousin. I don't mean to condemn the entire genre because I can enjoy a bit of it now and then and Eminem would rank as one of my favorite artists within that genre. After all, that's why I bought the DVD. But rap music just doesn't fit me. I'm more of a small town westerner than a big city ghetto dweller. Okay, okay, it has wider appeal, but there's a lot of people who just don't  care for it and I can understand their feelings.

""8 mile""was an interesting movie in several different ways. Well, you've all heard of Detroit and several other big cities that are decaying with the demise of American manufacturing. Detroit is a particularly good example because of the dramatic changes in the automobile industry. It's lost 50% of it's population! Only a few decades ago, Detroit was one of America's great cities. Would you like to see Detroit at the ground level and on the mean streets? Well, viewing this movie is a way to do it. The urban decay is just appalling and serves as some kind of warning to all of us, if only we could read it.

Rap music came in about in the late 70s. I expected it to be a short-term fad that would fade after a few years, but I was dead wrong. Rap is still with us 35 years later and is still going strong. Where did it come from? What is it like at the real base level? What's it like at a street level rap performance? Well, this movie provides a lot of views for these type of questions. Rap came out of the big city ghettos where most of the inhabitants were African American. It came out of the F-bomb dialect of American English and is harsh and grating on the ears. It's a brash and bombastic music that aggressively pushes itself into your face. Want to know what rap is like at the street level? ""8 mile"" is a fairly good depiction, I would guess. Well, who am I to say, standing on the distant sidelines?

In any case, Eminem is a white Rapper from the Detroit area and he plays a white Rapper from the Detroit area working himself into the distant dream of gaining a recording contract. The movie documents his living conditions and rise through his associates on his way to ultimate stardom. Very interesting! Without question! Brace yourself for harsh conditions and extreme language abuse and you might even enjoy it.

3448626,2,B00009IB3B,"Eminem is not an actor, and though I give him credit for not ruining it by trying to act in the movie and instead being himself, he sticks out when put in a movie surrounded by actors. All other characters appear relatively vibrant, bordering on flamboyant... like actors in a movie. And he seems like he's just a pedestrian passing through. I think this is an example of a poor idea given to decent cinematographers, to project the movie's tension to the viewer.

In the end is a movie with an awkward feel, and I don't feel like I gained anything watching this over, say, just reading his story online.",1334707200,,604,4.490909090909091

3448648,5,B00009IB3B,"8)  Mekhi Phifer.  I know that this may not mean much to a lot of you, but Phifer is a ridiculously talented actor who just hasn't received the exposure he deserves.  It's hard for African American actors in this industry, because they are all too often either cast in predominantly Black films that get no exposure or they get cast as the stereotypical sidekick.  Phifer has bared his acting chops in every role he's been handed, and this is no exception.  He really sinks his teeth into the role of David `Future' Porter, giving him a life all his own, with real viewpoints, aspirations and emotions.  He is far more than just a `sidekick', he's a life force propelling his friend to greatness.

7)  The rap.  Yeah, this is a rap movie so-to-speak, and the gritty rap battles are major highlights, especially the final ones where Rabbit grows a pair and lets it loose.  If you are a fan of Eminem as an artist, or any of his crew, then the freestyle rap-offs will have you smiling from ear-to-ear.

6)  The gritty direction.  Curtis Hanson is a phenomenal director, and that statement is made based on his flawless transference of `L.A. Confidential' to the big screen back in 1997.  He brings an even grittier feel to this film, allowing the very essence of this man's life to burry itself in every frame.  This film feels SO LIVED IN, genuinely evoking from start to finish, and while other factors obviously are in play here, it is Hanson's direction that establishes the film's core.  He understands the tale he is telling, and he pulls so much out of this cast (I mean, he gets an Award worthy performance out of Eminem, but I'll get to that in a minute).

5)  The sharp script.  This is a very smart film, because it could have easily fallen victim to the clich&eacute;s of the genre, but it doesn't; at all.  It really `goes there', creating real people with real issues and real situations that bleed so much honesty and truth.  Some have gripped about the relationship between Alex and Rabbit, but I find it truthful and earnest.  Even her betrayal reads with such gritty authenticity you can completely connect to it.  The dialog is realistic (yes, all those 4-letters words feel appropriate) and the progressive plot ends on a realistic note as well (that sense of accomplishment is never overshadowed by a Hollywoodized improbability).

4)  R.I.P. Britney Murphy.  Yes, this is one of her finest roles.  I ache when I think that such a criminally underrated star (and such a breath of fresh beauty) is gone from us.  Her slick sensuality coupled with the understanding of her character (glorified groupie intent of getting a piece herself) helps create a character we love to hate, and cannot forget.

3)  It's semi-autobiographical.  I think my friend said it best, when this film was released.  He said ""I'd love to see how Eminem got his start"" and while this is not a strict biography (it's loosly based on Marshall's life, pre-stardom) it really helps you appreciate who Eminem really is.  Taking bits from his shattered home-life (his relationship with his alcoholic mother takes a more tenderly frustrated turn in the film, as apposed to the volatile way he explains it now) as well as his talent, `8 Mile' gives the audience a glimpse into the trials and triumphs of one of hip-hops most notoriously controversial (and critically applauded) players.

2)  Eminem is REALLY good here.  I'm serious.  I never would have thought that he would hold his own, and I actually thought that casting him in the lead was a bit of a mistake, but he really blew me away with this one.  I guess it is true, that once you lived it you understand it, because nothing about his performance seems forced or inappropriate.  He's so natural here, completely bringing you along as he travels the road to personal betterment.  I don't know if I can applaud the performance enough, and it's not just because he's a rapper and acting is out of his element so `for a rapper' he does a great job.  This is just a great performance, period.

1)  Because I know what I'm talking about!  Really, I do!",1266451200,,4093,4.664335664335664

I was there the first day with a bunch of friends thinking ""Hey this movie is gonna be terrible"" the trailers were decent but it made it seem eminem was just going off this poor white boy story.

However the story shows growing up poor, the rap game underground, battling, love, betrayal, and hell it was even funny. Everyone came through with acting, even eminem, which really surprised me. It wasn't a Oscar awarding performance but it was good enough that he didn't hurt the film, he played his character well even though he stated he only lived in trailer park for two days in his life in the movie he played a kid who's lived there years.

Overall with the final battle being great for rap fans it's an enjoyable movie for all looking for a good kickback rap in the 90's type of film with a decent story following.",1259798400,,911,4.352941176470588
3448651,5,B00009IB3B,"Two kinds of filmgoers may want to see 8 Mile, fans of Rap/Eminem and those who thought Curtis Hanson's ""LA Confidential"" was one of the best films of the last few years. Eminem films are likely to be very happy. The high vote given the film by females under 18 confirms that. Eminem turns out to be a surprisingly good actor and the music is brilliant.  Followers of Curtis Hanson like me may be less enthusiastic. The film is certainly interesting and well made, but lacks the mix of excitement, tension, mystery, comedy, sex, drama and star performances that makes LA Confidential interesting to watch over and over again. Eminem plays Jimmy's, whose relationships with his friends, family, workmates and girlfriends are well handled, as are his efforts to break into the commercial world of Rap music. But this is all quite low-key stuff compared with the dazzle of LA Confidential. And Detroit at night or gloomy daylight is at the opposite end of the USA to sunny Los Angeles.  Maybe there lies a clue to why Curtis Hanson chose to make this film. It is set in a depressed area of one of the most depressed cities in the USA and so shows a side of that country that is not often seen in Hollywood movies.

3448653,5,B00009IB3B,"If you want a full review of this DVD, there are many excellent ones written here.  But here are some highlights and food for thought not covered elsewhere.  When you watch this DVD, look for these underlying themes:

+ Eminem's ""friends"" think they are talented rappers, but they all really know that Eminem is king here, and are scheming for ways to profit from his success.  Glaring examples are ""Future"" (to promote his joint), and Wink trying to hitch Eminem with his make-believe rap production connections.

+ Time after time again, his ""friends"" let him down when instead they could help. Examples:

 ++ His car breaks down over and over, and they are all standing by.  But whenever he gets his car fixed (a number of times), then they jump inside the car to have fun.  Eminem knows and has the motivation to fix his car, both of which are glaringly absent in his ""friends"".  Reinforcing young black men's cliches?  I wonder ...

 ++ His mom is in this relationship with their past classmate.  What do his ""friends"" do?  They mockingly ""line up"" to be her next mate.

 ++ On the fight scene with Papa Doc's troops, only Cheddar (Bob) comes up with a real weapon to match Papa Doc's, which flashed last time.  When Cheddar shoots himself, only Eminem presses down the wound and otherwise takes definite action to take him to the hospital to save his life. The other ones are again standing by a pole. ""Future"" dissappears to ""pray"".

 ++ Wink tries to befriend ""Rabbit"" while at the same time hangs with his nemesis ""Papa Doc"".  And lays with Alex(a) in the studio, knowing that Eminem is interested in her.

 ++ In general, his ""friends"" are shown to simply hang around and generally ""along for the ride"".  He, and in a lesser way Cheddar and Alex(a), are the only ones really showing any semblance of taking charge of their lives.  Since all three are white, one again wonders about black's cliches here.  And one wonders also about a Messianic, ""you save me"" attitude, versus an ""I take charge"" in what they can.
  However, look at the ""tough love"" he briefly receives from a coworker, and from the security guard, both of which are of color.  A break from these cliches.

+ Jeannine, Alex(a) and other girls in his life, even his mom, are shown to be out only for their cut of the pie.  His pie.
  The only ones who are a real emotional support to him are, in a small way, his mom, and, in a major way, Lilly, his little sister.  The latter is (in real life) a friend of Eminem's daughter. She did her acting in a quite realistic way, that could only come up from a real-life friendship with Eminem.

  Eminem and Lilly's filial relationship shows an emotional intensity that brings out a caring and providing Eminem.  Not what you would expect in a rapper.

  Also notice Eminem's motivation to burn an abandoned house (used in raping a little girl, according to the news) when Lilly's name is brought up in the conversation.  And Alex(a) does not miss out on that cue.

  Cheddar Bob is there mostly as a comic relief.  His name and his behavior suggests that his brain seems to have some holes where gray matter is missing.  But watch him closely, as he, Eminem and his mother slowly realize that the people around them not only are of no help, but a distraction and even a hindrance to their betterment.",1236988800,,3318,4.545762711864406
3448654,3,B00009IB3B,"I remember when this movie was coming out. At the time I thought it was supposed to be Eminem's life story or something. Then after seeing the movie, I knew it was definitely not. Maybe somewhat but definitely not what I thought it was going to be. Honestly I don't know much about his life other than he hates his ex Kim and he is ticked at his Mom.

8 Mile is a pretty good movie though on its own. The dreams of a white man making it in what most consider a black mans game. Sure, some have and were basically one hit wonders like Vanilla Ice and maybe even Snow (was he white?). Some were amazing like the Beastie Boys and even Eminem himself. Sure we never really see the rapping part take off like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hustle-and-Flow-Blu-ray/dp/B000OONQ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hustle and Flow [Blu-ray</a>], but we do see him 'battle' which is two guys facing off and free styling, which I consider harder than rapping since you basically coming up with rhymes on the spot.

Eminem plays Rabbit/Jimmy and is a kid basically living out of a garbage bag. With a dead end job for his future, the only thing Rabbit dreams for is a better future for himself and for his sister who lives with her bad/decent mom. And the only thing he has going for him is rap... and he's really good at it. He mainly just wants to record his music, but having no money, he can't really get studio time without help. So to pass the time he goes to a place where people battle to earn respect and recognition. And really that's basically the gist of the movie.

Eminem actually plays a good role, even it probably wasn't to tough to basically play himself. Kim Basinger plays his mom and does a really god job. One minute you like her and the next minute you want to scream at her saying 'WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?'. Brittany Murphy is also in here and really didn't need to be.  I hated her role. She just seemed like some drugged out hooker to me the whole time.

Though I liked the movie, I also don't really care for it... but... then I did like it also. Weird I know. Right when I would start getting bored with parts or rolling my eyes at parts, they would make me laugh or just get really interested again. For instance...one scene has Rabbit and his friend working on his car and the friend is trying to get him to come battle next week. We get it already...Rabbit is good and needs to battle. And then you hear 'Sweet Home Alabama' playing from inside the trailer and Rabbit and his friend start free styling to it and it really sounded good...which made me get interested again. I don't know...kinda hard to explain I guess.

In the end I would say rent it if anything. The last 3 battles were really good on Em's part.

P.S. Why did the only 2 other white dudes in the movie have to be REALLY dumb or REALLY redneck white trash? I thought that was funny.",1234656000,,2910,4.479245283018868

3448659,1,B00009IB3B,"I probably would have appreciated this movie more, except for the fact that i saw it at a party, which usually takes away from a movie. As i sat on the couch, during the final freestyle showdown, my friends crowded around the TV, and as Eminem, ""jammed to the sick beats"", all my friends cheered ""yo! that was some illen rhymin' dawg""...as if they understood anything he said. That kind of made enjoying the movie difficult, but the end scene was still amazing. Aside from a few silly things, this movie was great. Those silly things being that when Eminem meets some random girl, he goes and has sex with her in the most random place possible...a factory... Not entirely fitting to the situation. The other stupid thing was the idea that Eminem was poor... my take on the situation; Eminem: ""I am so poor and I live in a trailer park with my momma, but somehow I can still afford 140$ headphones"". But all in all, this movie was great, and Eminem was fantastic, although my assumption is that he's gonna think to himself ""wow this movie was so successful, maybe I should make another one"" and if this is the case, it's gonna be garbage. He had his 15 minutes of fame, now it's up, he should go back to his white trailer trash park, and continue to make up ""illen beats"" with his 140$ headphones.",1220832000,,1296,4.449579831932773
3448660,3,B00009IB3B,"Ever since his first single ""My Name Is"" hit the airwaves in 1998, Eminem has become a household name and with each album he releases, his listening audience is privy to the intimate details of his life.  His candid alliterations have alluded to his mother's drug abuse, his strained relationship and estrangement from ex-wife Kim, a tumultuous childhood and his troubles with the law.  Now comes a film that mirrors his hard-knock life and road to stardom (names and events changed for dramatic effect, of course).

""8 Mile"" (an actual road in Michigan that separates Detroit proper from seven northern suburbs) is the story of Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith (Eminem), a down-on-his-luck Detroit mill worker with big dreams.  He and pals Future (Phifer), Cheddar Bob (Jones), Sol George (Miller) and Wink (Byrd) spend their time throwing random lyrics and frequenting ""The Shelter"", a local haunt in the Detroit suburbs where rhymesters gather to quash egos.  Unfortunately, Jimmy lacks confidence and when battling one evening, he ""chokes"" and decides never to go back.  But Future has glimpsed Jimmy's unusual talent and urges him to take another shot, a showdown in order with Papa Doc (Mackie), the defending champion.  While dealing with issues of low self-esteem and a reckless home life, Jimmy meets a runaway named Alex (Murphy) with dreams of her own. Assured by his friends of his talent and an acquaintance with contacts, Jimmy has a shot at a future in the music industry.  Will he put his scruples aside and go for it or will his anxiety overwhelm him and keep him not only in poverty but misery as well?

Eminem does well in his first-ever movie role as Jimmy Rabbit, displaying a modest range of emotions and even a little bit of a soft side, something rarely seen from the man who has been labeled a hate-monger, misogynist and homophobe.  Phifer, whom I first remember seeing in the MTV Hip-Hopera ""Carmen"", does an admirable job as Future.  Murphy is merely an appendage, a love interest thrown in to produce more conflict but she does manage to create some steam with Eminem.  Kim Basinger is far from her sex kitten image as Stephanie, Jimmy's negligent and temperamental mother; after playing a Veronica Lake look-alike in Curtis Hanson's earlier flick ""L.A. Confidential"", Basinger is stripped down to the bare essentials.

Bottom line: Most people will see this film simply for Eminem's motor-mouthed pace and the climax in which he returns to The Shelter to give all those creeps what-for.  I guess the pen can be mightier than the sword in this case.  Eminem fans will love this, in particular the soundtrack that supports it with the hit single ""Lose Yourself"".  Those looking for a remarkable dramatic performance from a multi-platinum selling hip-hop artist will see only mere glimpses, with little to suggest he will pursue a career in film (he's on hiatus as far as making his own music, choosing to produce for up-and-coming talents).  Take it at face value while nodding your head at the catchy beats and crafty alliterations.",1214265600,,3051,4.950980392156863

In his portrayl of Jimmy Smith Jr.,Eminem gives the charcter depth and while watching the film I didn't see Eminem, I saw Jimmy.

Eminem is quite the rap star today. He has sold millions of copies of cds

that are excellent hip hip masterpieces. He has taken the world by storm and shown that White people can rap. But, he stretches himself and his persona into this movie and the movie itself is surprisingly simple and easy to watch. It doesn't seem like a biography movie because the character's names aren't the same as the real person's name. Probably, Eminem didn't want the movie to be like a ""Eminem can act"" vehicle for him. He had already shown his rapping skills and enforced them through out the movie, but he does pull off a good performance as B-rabbit.

Curtis Hanson, who I find to be a okay director, seemingly could've been out of place in the hip hop culture but his direction works well with the atmosphere and location of the movie as the film as the film moves along at a fast pace set by his direction. He gets the performances out of the characters that were needed. He doesn't oversell the characters or oversap them so that they become these cheesy characters. You feel for the characters after you are done watching the movie. Curtis Hanson defines the character by the way he is portrayed on screen. We see his actions and we ulitametely root for him in the end as the credits roll and we hear lose yourself by Eminem.

Brittany Murphy is quite sexy in this role & the best part, unlike Jessica Simpson, she can actually act & she makes her performance more believeable than it could be! Now, 8 Mile might not be everyone's cup of tea cause it is a drama, there is lots yelling & it is a very dark movie. But for me, that's what it makes interesting!

3448672,4,B00009IB3B,"Im not an Eminem fan and I would never have watched this film by my own choice, but having said that - I enjoyed it. So there is obviously something in there to turn it around.

Ok, so I had absolutely no idea what people were saying for vast amounts of the film, I just managed to keep a hold of what was being rapped during the 'battles' and I followed the story by keeping my wits and looking for advice from the other people watching.

The story basically follows the young white rapper 'Bunny Rabbit' (How this guy got into as few fights as we saw with that name I didn't know) as he struggled, not so much to get noticed and recognised, but to pull out of himself the raw talent he and his friends knew he had.

Until this film he was an unknown, but respected within his group as good. By the end of this film by overcoming a variety of problems, being knocked back, getting a little luck, but overall walking in the right direction and trying to keep life on track (in a very subtle unspoken way too) he becomes a man who has opened a door, expressed his talent, proven he can cut it.

At times some of the things that happen appear almost random, without justification or motive, but then, that is not to say its wrong. That is obviously the way life works here. Its not so much a feature film as a semi fictional documentary to give you some insight, some fun and some shocks. Its certainly enjoyable whether a fan of Eminem or not, in fact the only song from the soundtrack that seems to appear in the film is the title track. Its true if you hate rap you are going to hate this film, but liking it is not so much a requirement as an added benefit.

My only real down point was that come the end, it finished. Abruptly. Walking off 'into the sunset' goes our young Eminem with so many unanswered questions. What comes next? What happens to his friends? Where does 'the girl' go? But while I thought about this I think I concluded that its good it finished like that. You can make up your own answers as to where the story goes next and that's not a bad thing in this instance.",1151107200,,2087,4.2075

The main problem with the hype surrounding this movie is that it misleads you into thinking that what you are seeing is something original, something that has not been done a thousand times before. It promises us that the film will be frighteningly realistic and distrubing, with performances so honest, because much of it is Eminem's so-called life story.

The ending is so predictable you just wait there bored, waiting for it to eventually get there, and hoping that just maybe the film will surprise you along the way. It never does. This film is an embarrassment to film making!",1149033600,,803,4.714285714285714
3448674,5,B00009IB3B,"This is probably one of the best films to come out in 2002, and yet it was snubbed by the acadamy despite all the critics praise.  Eminem pulls out all the stops here with a strong performance as a somewhat alter version of himself, a white boy growing up in Detroit with dreams to be a rapper.  What makes this film better than the weight of the plot is, first the A list cast including Kim Bassinger and Mikhi Phifer but it's the brilliant script and excelent direction that picks this movie up and carries it further then plot alone would.  Yes, this may or may not be how Eminem got his breaks in life but regardless, this film, watched as a fictional story and not an autobiography will do well to make the difference.  Eminem shows true talent as his charactor (Rabbit) tries to rise above the life he was given, the drunk mother and the slum living conditions, the ex-girlfriend who took him for everything and the dead beat friends he's determined not to become.  Rabbit wants more for himself and for his family, and he's determined to work hard to get it.  Throw in a new love interest (Britany Murphy in a peformance to make you go GA'GA) and some rival thugs and you have a simple plot turned great movie with subplots that hold your interest and keep you in anticipation of the next scene.  Great film all the way around.",1146441600,,1334,4.420408163265306
3448675,4,B00009IB3B,"Eminem proves he is an outstanding actor and makes the story unquestionable.

B. Rabbit is a noone with plenty of ambition as well as his vocabulary intact, but when you're growing up on 8 mile it's not easy becoming anything, less alone a white rapper. He can't even bring himself to challenge the local rappers on stage during the weekends. In the middle of him trying to land his breakthrough he finds himself fond of the ambitious, but ditsy Alex (Brittany Murphy), but she turns out to be bad news for him. Will he stand the challenge of the Free Worlds Gangsta Boys?

It's a good storyline (nothing new, but you haven't seen it 10 times before either).
Brittany Murphy disappoints in this movie if you've liked her previous movies. This is Eminem's acting debut, but not his autobiography. It just goes to show he can both sing and act and IS truly talented.",1144454400,,864,4.603896103896104
3448676,3,B00009IB3B,"I've been trying to expand my horizons lately, which is what caused me to check out Eminem's big silver screen venture. Despite never being a fan, and despising rap in general, I have to say that this movie is better than expected. The intangibles are quite strong. The guys in his crew and the shots of Detroit are very interesting. The idea of rap jousting is also pretty novel. As far as acting goes, Kim Bassinger is a stand-out in her portrayal of Rabbit's alcoholic, promiscuous, and broken mother. In terms of the plot itself, most of it will be familiar to those who know anything about the performers' life. I'm not sure how much of the film is autobiographical but it seems like a textbook example of ""writing about what you know.""

In fact, it is Eminem's treatment of himself which really brings 8 mile down, and made it just another flick. Rabbit, as a man, just isn't realistic. He's a self-righteous martyr, and, while that might be the way Eminem views himself, such an angle makes for a really boring plot. Audiences just doesn't care much about guys who are wooden. There's nothing ambiguous about Rabbit; he's a great brother, loyal boyfriend, devoted artist, blah, blah, blah. Generally, people just aren't like that. He has a great group of friends in the movie, but frankly, I'm surprised they stay with him because he's so uptight, irritable, and melodramatic. He treats his friend David ""Future"" Porter terribly, although, for some reason, the guy forgives him. If he were able to detach himself more from Rabbit, I'm sure Mr. Mathers could have put together a more compelling script.",1144368000,,1608,4.784172661870503
3448677,4,B00009IB3B,"Something about this movie rang true about Marshall Bruce Mathers the III. It was very similar to his upbringing, which he did admit to, in interviews but stated that somethings were different so he could play an actual character rather than tell about himself which he found quite boring.

The thing I loved about this flick is the realism in it. It has a sense of history in it, not just for this character, Jimmy, but real life musical history for Rap/Hip Hop. We see his character at a place called ""The Shelter"" where it's dirty, smoky, and there are rap battles going on. Well, before rap truly went mainstream in the 1990s, rap was an underground movement, and this movie, taking place in the mid 90s, shows that fact.

Something about Jimmys struggle on its own is that he said it himself, wondering if he should start living life on a realisitic level rather than up in the clouds. And once he accepted his life as where it was, and who he was, his courage came out like a fierce lion. His talent, was undeniable.

It's funny because you get the vibe that they were really trying to make this a serious account when it couldn't be any further from the truth.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, I never liked Eminem and I never will.  I resent the fact that he's considered by ""rap"" fans (really just 12 year old girls and boys) as the best ever, that's b.s.  The funny thing is, he didn't even write the battle raps in his own movie!  Craig G did!

3448681,5,B00009IB3B,"Rapper Eminem is one of the biggest names in rap...period. He's sold over 40 million albums worldwide and has garnered Grammys and other awards over his near-decade career. With so much success, it was only a matter of time before a movie would become a reality, and 8 MILE makes a big case for Eminem's acting career. Boasting impressive settings, a really good cast, and gritty drama, this movie is fantastic from front to back.

We follow the story of Jimmy Smith (aka B Rabbit) who can flow like any rapper can, but the trouble is he is wicked shy of the crowd at the ""shelter"" where the rap battles happen. His friends Chedda Bob, Future (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who makes a strong presence here), and his other cohorts are his friends. He lives in a trailer with his alcoholic mother (played by Kim Basinger, who is vulnerable here), and his little sister. Eminem works at the Detroit Stamping company, where the pay ain't great but the work is hard, and there is some prejudice. Jimmy doesn't exactly have the best life, but he's trying to do the best that he can. His mother's abusive boyfriend, Greg, isn't exactly helping matters either...he doesn't really like Jimmy and takes every opportunity to put him down. Eminem starts to really take his rapping future seriously, though, and when he meets a new girl (Brittany Murphy), things begin to change a bit. But pressures ride as Leaders of the Free World claim to have the best raps, and after an altercation with one of the members, Eminem gets the crap kicked out of him. But this only makes him stronger, and he intends to beat the LOTFW at the rap battles. His mother strikes it big at bingo and things really start looking better. The night of the battle, Eminem can't choke like he did the first time at the beginning of the movie, so now he's gotta show that he is the man when it comes to stepping up to the mic. His relationship with his boss at work gets much better too, so work is piling up. I don't want to give away what happens at the rap battle, but I'm sure you can guess what happens. Even the ending of the movie is really strong, with ""Lose Yourself"" playing in the background as Eminem walks off into the alley, having a newly restored confidence as he strolls back to work.

The movie benefits greatly from Eminem's convincing performance. He's not just cashing the check here, he really can act. He mixes some good emotions and strong acting with impressive raps and this was bound to happen. He's good at what he does...and he's good here. The rest of the cast is good, too, with Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Pfeiffer and Kim Basinger all taking good turns honing their acting chops. Of course the rap bouts are the talk of the town, and you should find plenty to enjoy in these moments. But the quiet, anguished moments are just as strong, and the slum-like sets of Detroit ring loud and clear in this picture. All of it makes a big difference in the power and the lesson of the movie.

So Eminem fans, fear not. Eminem does just fine in his big film debut here. You'll find a lot to appreciate here, with some laughs, some tear-y moments, and some gritty street drama. While many never thought Eminem could carry his own as an actor, 8 MILE presents a strong case for his possible future in this business. This is one tough film you don't want to miss.",1136246400,,3325,4.492561983471075
3448682,5,B00009IB3B,"Once upon a time there was a young man named Jimmy. His friends called him B Rabbit. He was white and lived in a trailer on 8 Mile in Detroit, the line that seperates white from black neighborhoods, with his mother. He had a little sister that he loved and cared for like the dad he never knew. He had a hard labor job in a factory. He was sick of his life. He wanted to become a rapper. His break into the rap world could happen if he wins rap battles at a local club where he is seen as a failure. His life depends on that one shot. Will he take it?

That sums up the story of 8 Mile, a surprisingly engaging flick directed by Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys) and starring rap sensation Eminem as Jimmy in his first big budget motion picture. The supporting cast includes Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as Jimmy's helpless mother, Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's friend and coordinator of the rap battles at the club, and Brittany Murphy as Jimmy's love interest and local flirt.

What struck me the most about 8 Mile is Eminem's performance. Usually, hip-hop and rap artists can't act if their lives depended on it, but Mr. Mathers surprises the audience with a virtual emotion, humor, and subtleness that carries the film well into the climactic scene at the end where Jimmy goes against the odds to prove to himself, his friends, family, and the world that he's not just another trailer dweller from around the corner.

The movie features the Academy Award winning song Lose Yourself, co-written and sung by Eminem himself.

3448683,4,B00009IB3B,"Say what you will about him as a person, but as a performing artist Marshall Mathers (a k a Eminem) has talent to spare. And one more thing - his acting's not too bad, either.

That will surely come as a disappointment to those who were hoping for him to fall flat in his feature-film debut, ""8 Mile."" But he acquits himself nicely, lending credibility to a drama that examines not only hip-hop music but impoverished urban America as well.

Which is not to say that ""8 Mile"" is problem-free. Despite its edgy, raw-nerved approach, the film is somewhat clichs mother (Kim Basinger) in her trailer home.

But he has hopes for bigger things, including a career as an MC. However, when the time comes for him to actually perform his act onstage, he chokes and is unable to utter as much as a word.

Then a series of good things happen, including the arrival of Alex (Brittany Murphy), a would-be model who sees big things in Jimmy and encourages him. Still, that's easier said than done, especially when he faces competition from a rival hip-hop crew, and even his friends and family don't really seem to believe in him.

It should be noted that neither Mathers nor filmmaker Curtis Hanson have said that the film is a definitive biography of the controversial hip-hop star. Rather, it takes some of his real-life events and dramatizes them.

The results are highly watchable. In fact, there might not be a more rousing moment on film this year as the scene in which Rabbit finally turns the tables on his tormenters on the stage.

That's at least due in part to Mathers, who's quite believable. Of course, he's also got a talented supporting cast to bolster him in weaker moments. Murphy continues her string of solid performances, while both Mekhi Pfifer and Basinger are better here than either has been in quite some time.

""8 Mile"" is rated R for frequent use of strong sex-related profanity, racial epithets and explicit sexual talk, violence (beatings and some gunplay), scenes of simulated sex and simulated drug use (marijuana), brief nudity (flashes of male and female backsides) and brief gore.

So many, in fact, that Dwight Yoakum wrote a song about it called ""Readin', Rightin' and Route 23.""  There's even a town in northwest lower Michigan (far away from the factories of Detroit and Flint) with a southern population so large that it's nicknamed Mance-tucky (real name Mancelona).

It wasn't the best film I've ever seen, but it was still worth the wait. I've been an Eminem fan ever since the Eminem Show came out. I think he is very clever, to be able to think up rhymes like that on the spot.

It was all in the script, of course, but if this film is really semi-autobiographical, he would have been doing that kind of rap battle before he got famous - making up rhymes on the spot. Even if they are rather offensive to the opponent, some of them are still really witty.

And by the way, a lot of people I know who have seen the film say the sex scene is really explicit - but it's not that bad actually. I'm sure there's far worse. You don't see all that much.

As I have said, I've seen better films - but this is a really great film - I recommend it to all ages except those under thirteen because of the sex scene and violence. In New Zealand, it was originally an R16 film, but when it had been on for about a month, I heard that they'd reduced it to R13.

3448693,4,B00009IB3B,"Undoubtedly, the surprise film of 2002 was 8 Mile, the story about a young white rapper in Detroit who struggles with his broken family, gold-digging friends, and simply to find his identity in the nefarious world in which he lives. Starring the best-selling rap artist Eminem, 8 Mile is supposedly autobiographical in nature, portraying the true life rise of Marshall Mathers from the hardened streets of Detroit to the gold paved highways of superstardom. But the film begins and ends in the ghetto, cataloguing the time prior to the rapper's success. As a movie, it performs its duties well - virtually transporting the viewer to the crime and poverty riddled neighborhoods of one of America's most dangerous cities...

Local youth Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith, Jr. harbors dreams of hitting the big-time as a rapper (along with most of his peers in Detroit), but few are supportive of his efforts, especially his mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger), a self-centered woman who neglects her five-year-old daughter, remains unemployed, and generally wastes her life away. Her verbal battles with Jimmy are the only substantive part of their relationship.

When Jimmy gets a job working on an assembly line at a sheet metal factory, he works long hours in the dead end job making just enough money to get by. Living in a trailer with his mother so that he can save up enough money for a demo tape leads to everyday confrontations with the woman. Things begin to look up, though, when Jimmy meets Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring model who shares his dreams of leaving the ghetto and pursuing a better life. But everything goes awry when Jimmy chokes at a local late-night rap showdown.

The bad news continues when Jimmy catches Alex cheating on him, his mother kicks him out, and a gang of thugs gives him a beating - placing a gun to his head and threatening to pull the trigger.

When the opportunity arises to perform once more in the local rap showdown, all of Jimmy's dreams hinge on his ability to pull out all the stops. Can he verbally destroy his opponent and gain the notoriety necessary to put him on the map...?

A surprisingly well-written screenplay wrought with symbolism, 8 Mile vividly portrays the life of an angry urban youth who aches to express his hatred for the world around him. As the dividing line between the city Detroit and the outside world, 8 Mile represents was is and what can be. The film's ability to draw the audience into a world of which they may not be a part makes this a definite must-see film. For those conservative or older viewers who may be reluctant to the see the film because of its leading star Eminem, I highly recommend giving 8 Mile a chance. If you enjoy drama and peering into unique worlds, then you might be pleasantly surprised with this one...

3448698,4,B00009IB3B,"First off, to reply to the comments of one reviewer, who sees Eminem's character as racist, watch the movie over once again.  The only thing remotely racist Eminem says is calling Future an Uncle Tom.  That sad, in the freestyle battles and throughout the movie many degrading things are hurled at Eminem simply because he is white.  Secondly, he raps against Popa Doc because Popa Doc is claiming to be all thug and gangsta when he isn't.  He isn't ripping on him because he has a stable family situation and a better education than B Rabbit.  I am white and I rap as well, and I can tell you that I face racism and feel like I have to prove myself ever time I go on the mic.  African American rappers seldom have to prove themselves the way white and asian rappers do.  Also, the film would not be realistic without the use of profanity.  I worked for a slumlord in Milwaukee and can safely say that there is no shortage in the use of sexual epithets and profane language in impoverished areas.

That said, I found the film uneven, but still very entertaining.  Eminem does a much better job acting than he is given credit for and would outshine nearly any other rapper in a similar role.  The film moves a good pace and focuses on the elements it needs to.  Most actors do an admirable job, with the exception of an over the top, annoying Kim Bassinger.  The dialogue could be improved a little bit, and certain elements could have made the film more immeadiate and real.  Specifically, I couldn't believe  nothing happened to the gang after Em paintedballed a cop car, and then burned down a house and watched it for several minutes while sirens blared in the distance.

However, the film did not dissapoint in the areas that truely mattered.  I had heard Eminem won a freestyle battle, which eventually lead to his discovery with Dr. Dre.  So, I was eager to see the freestyle battle scenes, which were mind blowing and amazing.  I wonder how much of it they came up with on the spot, but each sequence was great.  Also, I personally liked the progression of the film, with its interesting portrayal of a inner city hip hop club all the way to the film's close with its ambigous ending.

recently I saw this movie for like the 50eth time. I still really like this movie. Eminem is one of the few singers who can seamlessly cross over from singing to acting. I do however think that we will probably never see Eminem in another movie. The only reason I saw this movie was due to the fact that I liked Eminem, but the movie holds on its own, but Eminem does real well. I've read a couple reviews where people said: ""Oh, Eminem is just playing himself, it's not even a performance.""  In a sense he is playing himself. But what people don't realize is that playing yourself is sometimes harder to do then playing someone else. This movie is very very loosely based on accounts in Eminems life, so people need to stop saying its a biography. It's NOT! Anyway, Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr, or Jimmy, or

Rabbit, or B-Rabbit, or yet again, Bunny Rabbit. Rabbit is (obviously) a white rapper living in Detroit who heads to the Shelter, a rap club, almost every night and gets stage fright, or chokes. Whatever you want to call it. The only person who sees how talented Rabbit really is, is Future(Mekhi Phifer,

Dawn of the Dead). Future is kind of Rabbits mentor. Like Mr. Miyagi was to Daniel in ""The Karate Kid"". Rabbit lives at home with his mom (Kim Basinger, The Door in the Floor) and his sister Lilly. The sister is semi-based on Eminems daughter Hailie. He works at a stamping factory and thats where he meets

Alex (Brittany Murphy, Little Black Book). Alex is kind of a free spirited...Sl*t. To say the least ya know. So, we have:

Rabbits Mom: Based on Ems Mom. Except the love in this movie is a lot stronger.

Lilly:Hailie?

So, yes. In a sense its a biography. But this is a very entertaining and terrific film. You don't have to like rap, you don't have to like Eminem. But you should like this film. A+",1107043200,,1999,4.352150537634409

This movie shows what it was like where Eminem grew up in the suburbs of Detroit. How he struggled, what he had to go through. This is a great movie for all Eminem fans, even non-Eminem fans will love this movie. I hope that Eminem plays in another movie sometime in the near future.

3448702,4,B00009IB3B,"When you look up the word controversy in the dictionary you just might find a full colour picture of Eminem as the definition. Let's face it, this is one artist that doesn't go out of his way to endear people to him. He's real, though. What you see is definitely what you get. When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was Eminem's life story, but I was sadly mistaken. Although I'm sure that there are similarities that could be found, this is the fictional story of one Jimmy Smith, Jr.

Eminem is brilliant as this struggling young man, perhaps personal experiences added to his believability, mayhap he's just a damned good actor as well as musician. Jimmy Smith is stuck in hell, literally, his life is a daily battle on more than one level. Returning home after having his relationship with his girlfriend blow up in his face, Jimmy is faced with accepting the fact that his Mom (Kim Basinger) is having a relationship with someone he went to school with and hates. Rabbit, as everyone calls him has a hard time swallowing things at home, but when the only place left is a trailer on the wrong side of the tracks, what else can you do?

Rabbit isn't content to sit back and let life screw him over even more, he wages a war with fate and struggles to pull himself out of the cesspool that circumstances placed him in. Sure, he's from the wrong side of the tracks, so what?! Okay, he's living in a trailer with his Mom? Big deal, at least he has a home. He's busting his butt to make a good impression on his boss during the day and struggling to overcome internal conflicts and realize his dreams of being part of the Detroit music scene.

It seems like everything and everyone is against this brave young man, and the harder he struggles, the deeper he finds himself. Kind of like falling into quicksand...  However, he doesn't give up. He's a lyricist of incredible talent, verging well into genius status. The rhymes he can put together will make your head spin with amazement. Music is the only thing that has any meaning at all for Rabbit anymore, it's the only thing that hasn't messed him over. And in that concept, he is definitely a soldier - fighting the rap battles - fighting for respect and to make it as a rapper.

This is a story of the street in today's world. The story of one man alone against fate. The story of overcoming the obstacles and going up against all the odds. It is a story to inspire hope and warm the heart. It is proof that it can be done. Just because life has dealt you a losing hand, doesn't mean you have to stay with it. Take another draw and don't give up, a little strength, determination, and talent go a heck of a long way. Might even be enough to set you free!

The DVD contains uncensored Eminem rap battles and a music video. There's also a segment on Eminem's personal insights into the making of 8-Mile. You definitely get more bang for your buck!

Eminem deserves awards galore for this performance! In this, his debut feature film, that shows yet another facet of this contentious and scrappy personage he is glorious. Teamed with a dynamite soundtrack, you'll be mesmerized from the very first moment until the last strains drift through the speakers.

When life gets you down, or you are in need of some inspiration, watch this flick. It'll pop you out of the blue funks and give you strength of purpose again.

3448703,3,B00009IB3B,"Imagine you've been ditched by your girlfriend (she's told you she's pregnant), you've lost your job, your mum's banging one of your old schoolmates and your car won't start - just some of the many trials borne by James Smith Jr. aka Jimmy Rabbit. 8 Mile marks Eminem's acting debut in this Curtis Hanson directed movie. Also responsible for LA Confidential and Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Hanson certainly knows how to hone an emotional edge to his films. Set in Detroit, the film charts the frustrations of Jimmy Rabbit, Rabbit because he's fast and likes to f**k a lot. It's a fairly generic tale of gangland goings-on where the dream of fame and breaking out of the ghetto keeps hope alive (vis-a-vis Saturday Night Fever, Quadrophenia or even Rocky). The quirk in this tale is that B Rabbit is a white rapper in a black man's world and has to compete and respond to the racial diss that this entails.

The film opens at a  'rap battle' at the The Shelter club where compere and friend Future (played by Mekhi Pfifer in an excellent support role) builds up 'Bunny Rabbit' to compete with L'il Tic, rival rapper of the Free World rap gang. Supported by Future and his 'brothers' from the 3-1-3 gang, Rabbit prepares for battle by heaving his guts out, locked in washrooms that you would rather not see than visit. After 'choking' with stage fright, Rabbit gets booed off the stage with contempt by the crowd of blacks and 'spics. The film then follows the following week until the mother of all rap battles takes place against the champion 'Papa-Doc' of Free World. Along the way, tramp-love interest Alex (played by sexy Brittany Murphy), the brothers and Kim Bassinger as Rabbit's trailer park mama all put in fine performances played against the backdrop of a bleak, run-down Detroit and the New Detroit Stamping Foundry. The film gets its name after the 8 mile Road, so named because it is 8 miles out from the town centre and marks the boundary between the run-down ghettos of downtown and more upmarket suburbs populated by white trailer trash and the more salubrious areas and casinos.

The plot is hardly complicated or involved, but what makes the film for me is its credibility and insight into an area of life where none of us likely want to or are able to go. There's plenty of sideline activity away from Eminem, whether it's the beautifully timed, plain dumb antics of 'spic Cheddar Bob, the home spun philosophy of DJ Iz or the wide-eyed innocence of Rabbit's little sister Lilly (played by the 3 year old Chloe Greenfield). There's no time to get bored and one can only marvel at the mental and linguistic agility of the rappers, many of whom are genuine. The story also parallels the life of Eminem who rapped, as the story goes, from the age of 4 and entered the Rap Olympics in Los Angeles in 1997 desperate to win the $1500 prize (he came 2nd!). What of Eminem? Well, aside from his obvious virtuosity as a rapper, this 'dawg' is one natural actor with a stage presence and smouldering intensity that is impossible to ignore - somewhat reminiscent of Russell Crowe, whose big break also came in a Kim Bassinger film directed by Hanson. I wouldn't be surprised if we see him in a few years again at the Academy Awards picking up another Oscar, this time for acting. The film is beautifully crafted and builds up to a worthy finale.

For those concerned about the language - yep, there's every manner of sexual innuendo but I didn't find it offensive in this context - I just had to remember to moderate the jive when taking a trip to the local 7/11. There's a modicum of violence, but much less so than in many blockbusters of today, and the sex scenes managed to convey the message without being needlessly voyeuristic or explicit.",1103846400,,3754,4.632132132132132
3448704,5,B00009IB3B,"Although Eminem set out to make the movie with the determination that he didn't want to be in an ""Eminem movie"", it is hard to argue that ""8 Mile"" is not ""Eminem movie"" completely. The similarties between Rabbit and Eminem are hard to ingore. Maybe that is one of the reasons that Eminem's performance in this book is surprisingly professional and excellent. The director used the word ""raw"" to describe him, mainly because he's never been in a movie before. It is almost impossible to spot any trait of inexperience in Eminem's acting. It almost seemed as if he was born to be a hollywood movie star and has been acting for years. That is probably why Eminem's undefeatable talent attracts millions of audience and fans.

If you like Eminem, this movie would be thoroughly enjoyable for you.",1102204800,,792,4.739130434782608
3448705,5,B00009IB3B,"Simply said, this movie is more than worth your time. Eminem, Marshall Mathers, shines in music but has also proven to shine on film. Set along the film's title, 8 Mile in Detroit, Marshall Mathers acts as Jimmy Smith Jr., a ""poor little white boy"" on the wrong side of 8 Mile trying to make it big in the rap world. In 2002, at the time of the film, 8 Mile was and is essentially the boundary between city and slum- between white and black. It is also a psychological dividing line that separates Jimmy from where and who he wants to be. Jimmy was born on the wrong side of 8 mile with the wrong skin color and on top of it all lives with his alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) and kid sister in a trailer park. Inside 8 Mile you have ""real world"" credentials, and outside you don't.  To gain these credentials in Jimmy's world you must compete in verbal rap ""battles"" where each competitor gets forty-five seconds to ad lib to music. The point: to vocally destroy your opponent. The winner: the man (or woman) with best crowd reaction. Battling under the alias B Rabbit, Jimmy Smith Jr. endures physical and verbal battles in which he and his friends are threatened, belittled, and through it all overcome.

Eminem does a phenomenal job as Jimmy Smith Jr. Emotions are written on his beaten and bruised pale white face and in his incredibly deep blue eyes. He really feels what he acts. He shows so convincingly, despair and fear, sensitivity and love. I sat through the whole movie amazed and entranced. Eminem, the vulgar, publicly criticized, outspoken, free-minded rapper brings to the public eye the pollution of innocence. He comes through to the viewer as a slightly defected angel cast in to a brutal world. Greed, power and lust rule in the world of 8 mile. Taking place in a time span no longer than a week, Jimmy amazingly introduced both his heart and his head. The setting itself displayed the sadness of the story. The scenes were gray and the lighting was dim. The city itself was dirty and sadness shone on the majority of the residents' faces. Jimmy's sweet songs to his sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield) and sincere talks with Cheddar [MC] Bob (Evan Jones) and other friends shine a light of hope onto an otherwise dreary situation.

Marshall grew up in Detroit and made his start in the local ""battles."" This movie is very possibly telling a fictionalized ""life story"" of his rise to stardom. He says, ""We took some things that happened in my life and put 'em in the movie, and maybe twisted 'em a little bit, and added some things, and took out some things. Put it this way, if it was based on my life, then it would limit me to things I could do, and there would be certain guidelines we had to follow, but with this character, it's like, it's cool because I can do other things with him that ain't me."" Influenced by everyday city life: street signs, graffiti, the coffee shop, Jimmy Smith and Eminem form the lyrics that one day lead to fame.

The reasoning behind the heartfelt acting: the movie was from the heart. Jimmy's acts of protection of his sister greatly represent the way he wants to protect his daughter, Hailie. In `Mockingbird,' he ""sings"":

""All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see

Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did...

Now hush little baby, don't you cry

Everything's gonna be alright.""

In Eminem's world, friendship means a bond just as it does in Jimmy's world. Betrayal is betrayal no matter the face that it carries. Jimmy was betrayed by Alex (Brittany Murphy) an aspiring model, just as Marshall was betrayed by his wife and mother of his child.

This is an EXCELLENT film. Whether expressing ""to date"" real life or exaggerated hardships, it is quite obvious that there is much more behind the ""gangsta"" appearance of Detroit. And to the DVD itself, there are many excellent features that lead you into 8 Mile as well as the ""superman"" music video and an interview with Eminem himself. If you are not tolerant of profanity however, you may want to reconsider this film as a ""movie night"" selection. There is very good reasoning behind the R rating of this film. The coupling of ""mother"" and it's seemingly partner word can be, I'm sure, quite offensive and is not the only `creative' insult heard. Also, there are a few lude scenes, mainly two, that are quite graphic and expressive. There are street fights and trailer fights, gunfights and fistfights. The sexual scenes are very intense, as are most of the scenes throughout the film. Intense is an excellent one-word description of 8 Mile. I loved it. I can see past the vulgarity and language, nudity and violence into the heart of Eminem and all that he wanted to express.

""Look, if you had, one shot, or one opportunity

to seize everything you ever wanted, one moment,

would you capture it, or just let it slip ""

Taken from Eminem's song `Lose yourself,' these lyrics perfectly state the main message behind the movie. You will always have that one shot... it's your choice to take it and your choice if you make it.",1101859200,,5065,4.576158940397351
3448706,4,B00009IB3B,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time... two years ago! Man... has it been THAT long already? Around that time, I was a Senior in high school. Oh how times move fast...

I remember seeing this movie twice. The first time was with my brother. The theater was packed, but we both enjoyed the film. The second time... well, it was really an unscheduled event. A friend of mine (who happens to be a girl) wanted to watch it. She begged me to take her, so I gave in and decided to take her along. We were also to see it with a friend, but she dropped out at the last minute. So... our movie time turned into an unintentional ""date."" Since then, this movie always reminds me of that. We were unusually quiet most of the time... but we still ended up having fun. Little did we realize that we would then become good friends, later to become ""more than friends."" Was it because of this movie? I don't know... but I'd thought I'd begin my review with a short background of my experience.

The ""8 Mile"" fever struck our little town on the Rez. Flocks of Eminem fans flooded the theaters. And I would be one of 'em. The story, as everyone knows, is a ""semi-autobiographical"" account of Eminem's personal life. A bummed-out Detroit punk trying to escape from the city, and the only way he can is to get a record deal. Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., aka ""B. Rabbit."" He's had a rough time with ""rap battles"" since he freezes on stage. He's got friends to provide some guidance (okay, maybe just ""Future,"" played by Mekhi Phifer). The other three involves one that preaches and [...] about how screwed up Detroit is. The other two, a big-boned fella and a junkie-looking white guy, seem to be the comic-relief characters. The ""bad guys"" are the rap battle-winning gang, the Free World.

Jimmy also has a mother (Kim Basinger) and a lil' sister. More serious problems arise in his household when his ma's place is in danger of eviction. His ma also has a man that Jimmy doesn't get along with very well. Jimmy lives there but doesn't want anyone to know. B. Rabbit also has a little ""love interest,"" though it's probably not called that. A young woman, played by Brittany Murphy, also shares the dream of leaving Detroit. You'd think more would develop here, but it doesn't. Just a steamy sex-scene, then both part ways.

Em pulls off a hell of good performance, but... to quote Ebert's buddy, Richard Roeper: ""While Eminem's role is obviously no stretch, he's really good at playing a version of himself."" But that doesn't mean Eminem isn't a good actor. He pulls off a real performance. He shows his true self. Maybe more would've been nice... maybe ""8 Mile part 2"" could have that... that is, if a sequel is planned.

The DVD has a few plus features. They talk about how each rap battle in the movie HAD to be filmed since the rappers can only pull off their performance one time. There's also some free-styling rap battles with other people who were up to challenging Em (these are real, by the way). And a ""nasty"" music video of Em's ""Superman"" song.

The movie could be inspirational for those that want to succeed at something. People, especially those around my area, are like Jimmy Smith. They want to leave their hometown to pursue the big life in a big city. Or just simply get out of town. In truth, we all want to pursue that opportunity. Even I myself want to pursue that dream. We just have to work at it, then eventually, it'll come. That's what the movie is about, isn't it? It isn't just going to see how well Eminem acts... the movie can inspire people to get that dream (though not exactly a rap career like in the movie, obviously).

Like how the song goes:

""Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted... in One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?""

Because, my friend, that's the movie's main message.

Oh well... ""8 Mile"" is still an entertaining movie.",1101168000,,3924,4.483193277310924
3448707,4,B00009IB3B,"I've never been a very big fan of Eminem/Marshall Mathers/Slim Shady.  However, his performance in ""8 Mile,"" along with the compelling plotline of growing up in a tough, primarily black neighborhood as a white kid, made me respect him a little more than I have in the past.  The story shows us the trials and tribulations of a white kid growing up in a broken home with an alcholic mother in a rundown trailer park.  He faces poverty, racism, abuse from his mother and a myriad of others, as well as the typical doubts of a young man on the edge of adulthood.  This entire film is played out like a country song in rap mode.

This is a very fine story.  If you can look beyond the vulgar language(acceptable in this atmosphere), you'll find that there is a gritty and true story to ""8 Mile.""  Even though Eminem's character has so many tough breaks, you learn that it is with a strong supporting group of friends and believing in yourself that you can become successful at anything you put your heart into.

Highly recommended, though there is a heavy amount of coarse language(as stated before, it fits this film).  Also, keep the youngsters away from this film.  It's R-rated for a good reason.  For those concerned, keep in mind that this movie is full of verbal and physical abuse and some very tense moments. It also has a little sensuality in it.

3448711,5,B00009IB3B,"Okay, to start with you want to know, ""Is a hip-hop movie starring white rapper Eminem worth my time?"" Answer: oh yes. Second you ask, ""How good was Eminem as an actor?"" Answer: you'll be amazed.

8 Mile Road in Detroit is the boundary between city and suburbs, and, at the time this movie's set (1995) was very much the color line, black inside 8 Mile, white outside. If you were an aspiring hip-hop singer at that time, in that place, it was very much a big deal on which side of 8 Mile you were born and lived. Inside 8 Mile you had real world credentials, outside you didn't. Young hip-hop artists compete in ""battles"" in which each person gets 45 seconds to ad lib to music; in that time they do their best to verbally annihilate their opponent. Winners are decided by crowd reaction; victory goes to those with quick wits, verbal capability, and a killer instinct. Jimmy Smith, Jr. (Eminem) has everything going against him in that environment: he's on the wrong side of 8 Mile, on top of which he's white, and he lives with his mother in a trailer park. All of which means, when he gets up on stage at a battle, he might as well have a big white target painted on his forehead.

Jimmy's hip-hop alias is B. Rabbit. He has a dead-end, mind-numbingly boring job stamping auto body parts in a factory, an emotionally co-dependent mother (brilliantly played by Kim Basinger), a little sister he adores and wants to protect from the crime- and violence-ridden world in which they live, and the knowledge that he can't, and, unless something major changes, nothing to look forward to but more of the same until he dies of old age and a broken heart. His only possible salvation, the only thing that makes him special, is the music in his head. Problem: Jimmy's really a decent guy, very shy, and gets so nervous and intimidated at the battles he can't even speak, let alone win. Of course there are other conflicts to resolve - Jimmy's opponent in the movie's final ""battle"" is a gangbanger who, at one point in the film, has his crew hold Jimmy down while he puts a gun to Jimmy's head and threatens to kill him. But for all of that, in 8 Mile Jimmy's greatest battle is with himself, to find the determination and self-esteem to compete and win in the battles.

It's irresistible to compare 8 Mile to Rocky. In both movies there's an event in which the main character's performance has become for him the defining moment in his life, the challenge he must overcome to have any sort of decent existence thereafter. In Rocky it's the exhibition fight with Apollo Creed. But Rocky has such a self-image as a loser, he doesn't kid himself, he knows he can't win, he's not even in Apollo's league, he just wants to go the distance. Rocky knows he's going to get beaten mostly to death, but if he's still on his feet at the end of the fight he'll feel like a winner. Jimmy Smith, Jr. doesn't have that mindset working for him....Jimmy's got to WIN.

Eminem aka Marshall Mathers does a phenomenal job as B. Rabbit. He convincingly displays a wide range of emotions: despair, fear, anger, love, hate, courage, sensitivity, it's all right there on his face, scraped raw, mostly in the eyes. Throughout the entire movie I was just amazed at how good this guy was. With his fine features, pale skin, and amazingly blue eyes, Marshall Mathers in 8 Mile looks like a grounded, emotionally abused angel.

It's tempting to regard 8 Mile as a fictionalized Eminem biography since the Detroit hip-hop battles were where he got his start. There's a small amount of truth to that. In the DVD's excellent ""making of"" featurette, Eminem says, ""We took some things that happened in my life and put 'em in the movie, and maybe twisted 'em a little bit, and added some things, and took out some things. Put it this way, if it was based on my life, then it would limit me to things I could do, and there would be certain guidelines we had to follow, but with this character, it's like, it's cool because I can do other things with him that ain't me.""

This DVD has great ""extras,"" the standouts being the ""making of"" featurette and an uncensored music video of Eminem's song ""Superman.""

One warning: this is not the movie for people who can't stand profanity. Most of the characters in 8 Mile think ""mother"" is half a word.

3448716,2,B00009IB3B,"I went to see this on my birthday the day after it was released in the movies. I did this for my late wife, and nothing else. I really really didn't like this movie at all for the most part. I admit I don't understand the rap culture, and why it's considered music where your main objective is to make the other people feel stupid. However, I can't help if my late wife may have felt in a sense that Eminem was the messiah. I mean that's the way he was portrayed in here. I know that Eminem was the only one who could reach my wife in 2002 as she went through a major depression, and felt that Jesus Christ couldn't help her, and I didn't know how to help her. Anyway why I feel that Emeinem was portrayed as Christ in this movie? I feel in a sense he was defintely misunderstood by everyone for starters his Mom played by Kim Basinger(who is one woman I would love to cream on), His mother's boyfriend who taunts, and ridicules him, and his friends who don't know about him at times with his moods, and so forth, the 2 women in his life an ex-girlfriend, and the one played by Brittany Murphy, and finally a world of upcoming rappers who aren't too happy to see a white boy rap. That's right in 2002 the world of rap was still very black, and they surrounded the curtain leading to the holy of holies where no white man ever trod. Eminem's character would break the color barrier here, and the curtain is ripped apart. Mind you at the beginning Eminem falls flat on his face when he chokes on a rap, but not everyone took kindly to Jesus's words when he first came to preach either. I feel that the last part of the movie was loosely based on the last week of Jesus with the crucifixion, and ressurection. It all begins when one of the black rappers helps himself to some Brittany, and Eminem clocks him kind of like Jesus overturning the moneychanger's tables in the synagogue, then the crucifixion where the black rapper returns the favor to Eninem, and Eninem doesn't retailiate the same way Jesus allowed the Romans and Pharissees to crucify him on the old rugged cross. Then the ressurection when Eninem wins the rap contest against that same black rapper. This is only my opinion as comparing Eninem with Jesus. No One can ever match up against Jesus. So why do I write it then? I feel that this is the way that the music industry, and Hollywood has portrayed him, and it's rather sad as all Eninem can do is write raps mostly about himself, and all the troubles he's seen. I don't know what he's going to be up to next, but I know the last song I heard from him where he samples the Aerosmith song ""Dream On"" was one of the most uninspiring songs I've ever heard. I wasn't impressed with this for the most part except for the scenes with the little girl. I found them to be very endearing, and what saved the movie from absolute ruin. Otherwise all the fame, and adulation this movie got was another time for Hollywood to utter those magical words; ""I Am Diversity"".",1092441600,,2974,4.331541218637993

Eminem) was a rap superstar with a lot of creativity for lyrics and rhymes, but when we heard that he was going to make an acting debut, everybody taught that he was a musician, not an actor and he was going to sunk the whole movie. But that wasn't the case.

 In ""8 Mile"", not only he displays his hip-hop talents, but he also makes clear that he is a complete artist with great acting skills, even if he basically is playing himself, because it's hard to step in front of a camera and give a good performance, specially when most of the people wass waiting your for him to fail.

 ""8 Mile"" is a semi-biographical movie located in the lower-class Detroit, Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" and his friends are hip-hop aficionados that have a dream: someday they will be the next big thing in the hip-hop world. But Jimmy's friends know that his buddy ""B-Rabbit"" is the best rapper around; he just needs to display his talents in some way.

 The director Curtis Hanson was able to get good performances from everybody in the cast, the pace of the story is very good also, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stellar, and the music is just great. The extras in the DVD are entertaining, specially the rap battles that doesn't appear in the movie, because we can see Eminem improvising rimes and songs.

 This is the kind of movie that is enjoyable, not only for Eminem or hip-hop fans, but it can be enjoyed by everyone. A very recommendable movie.",1091318400,,1471,4.545454545454546

The pacing is *very* slow, which makes sense for some art house film where the characters are pontificating about the deeper meaning of life, but when it's just some delinquents driving around in a big sedan rattling off the various vices they're looking forward to exploring, it just gets a little tedious.

I realize that lots of his music is controversial, but as I watched this for the second time recently, I also realized a lot of our kids are listening to him.  Word for word.  My son and his friend could sing along with much of this movie, so I think it's worth paying attention to what he has to say.  Doesn't mean I condone all he has to say or all he does, just means I think he's worth listening too.
The movie, if taken out of the context of who Eminem is and what he does, would still be  a really good film, the fact that it's semi autobiographical really makes it interesting and entertaining at the same time.

3448728,3,B00009IB3B,"Okay, so like, Eminem is a poor white rapper on the wrong side of town in Detroit. The roads are numbered, and 8 mile is the bad area where the prostitutes are. I know this, because Maleficent lived near (but not in 8 mile, heavens no!) there.
Apparently, there's a whole rap culture going on. Eminem, playing a guy named Rabbit, finally starts to realize that the world he lives in sucks. Actually, he's always known that, but he was embarassed about it. The movie is about him coming to terms with who he is and where he comes from.
And that's about it. For the most part, 8 Mile is a very clean movie. It has all the same plot of a Rocky movie -- poor guy competes against big winner against all odds. Big bad winner has an outside-of-the-competition conflict with underdgo/protagonist. There's a girl from whom the protagonist draws his strength. And he has friends who are faithful to him to the end.
There's some important differences. In this movie, the girl is actually a [...] sleeping her way to the top. But the movie recognizes that her way is just as valid as anyone else's to get out of the hell hole they live in.
Additionally, the whole final contest -- a freestyle showdown involving rap -- is basically meaningless. Winning isn't about the admiration of people who could give a crap if Rabbit lives or dies. It's about him finally putting his demons to rest by admitting he's white trash. Rabbit draws upon the raw ugliness of his background to pull himself up by his bootstraps -- not his girlfriend, not his family, and not his friends.
And for that, you can respect Rabbit. At the end of the movie, he doesn't go on to become a rapping champion or getting that sweet record deal. He goes back to work.
Formulaic? Yes. Is Eminem a great actor? Hardly. But the movie doesn't try to be more than it is, and for that it earns my respect.
The only thing that seriously mars it is Eminem's ""I'm friends to all the gays"" rap. His gay pal covers for him at work and Rabbit defends him with his rap.
If you've forgotten, Eminem was seriously slammed for his homophobic lyrics. Eminiem seems to be trying to say that's part of his language. In other words, it's not that HE'S homophobic, it's just part of his speech. Which is complete and utter crap. Reality is, the culture he comes from is homophobic, and that's just the way it is. Ironically, in trying to pretend he recognizes his roots, Eminem rejected the ugly parts.
Please -- those moments in the film reminded me that this is a movie whose sole purpose is to perpetuate the myth and legend of Eminem. A black mark on an otherwise servicable film.",1079913600,,2618,4.467640918580376

While there isn't much plot to this movie (it's just a lot of stuff that happens to B-Rabbit [Eminem]), this movie is entertaining for the freestyles (""I Live At Home in a Trailer"" is hilarious), the battle raps (especially the second to last one, against Lotto: ""Tank top screaming/'Lotto, I don't fit you!!'""), and the DVD extras including battle rap auditions and the racy ""Superman"" video. It was also interesting to see how B-Rabbit put his words together for the song ""Lose Yourself"" through the course of the movie.

As for Eminem's acting, he is surprisingly good. He's no Richard Gere but he is better than most rappers who try to act (Nas, Ludacris, Dr. Dre, Method Man, etc.). The score is also dope: since this movie takes place in 1995, all of the hot songs from that era like Mobb Deep's ""Shook Ones, Pt. 2"" and Junior M.A.F.I.A.'s ""Get Money"" are played, making me relive my high school senior days.

3448733,1,B00009IB3B,"Curtis Hanson delivers a purely unintelligible, plot less, slice of rap drama that quite frankly has been done much better elsewhere. The entire film is a big set piece that leads up to the last minute and a half of Rabbit (Eminem) winning a rap competition. That much is good but the competition itself is given minimal screen time and instead we find Rabbit and his friends in a Detroit backdrop that looks like something from Bosnia with the trailer trash appeal to woo us all into feeling for these ""kids"" (Most of them grown men living with their mothers). Contrived yes, but it get worse when Rabbit's mom (Basinger) pops out of the blue with the line ""We are being evicted"" and with that the film is lost to stereotypical black men pulling guns, insulting people and picking fights.
Very few will take this film seriously enough and although Eminem merits a nod for this performance (yes he can act) the script is like something that popped out of a twelve year old Eminem fan's computer printer, and feels like it too. Oh wait a minute - this is a vehicle for Eminem fans. A quick slice of Hollywood cash making, filmed with token characters and a story won in a packet of cornflakes. Even though I like Eminem this one is a real stinker and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor - Buy a Eminem CD or even one of his music DVDs.

3448734,3,B00009IB3B,"Eminem`s first experience as an actor is a surprising one, developing an interesting character in a good urban drama. Curtis Hanson is the man behind the camera here, and his past work in acclaimed movies like ""Wonder Boys"" or ""L.A. Confidential"" gave him enough knowledge and recognition to get his hands on this project.
The story isn`t too original, but is well told and acted. Eminem plays Rabbit, a youngster from a Detroit neighbourhood with a messed life who`s trying to find his role in the world. His main passion is hip hop, so he looks to find his future in music, getting away from a life with low perspectives and choices.
Hanson captures well Rabbit`s story and the atmosphere of the community he lives in, showing the conflicts he must face to achieve his goal. The realistic direction and the gritty, dark photography add a natural, credible tone to the movie, showing how`s life in those convulted suburbs. The plot is deep enough and never gets too melodramatic or politically correct, despite the somewhat preachy and predictable ending.
Not a masterpiece, but given that most films with or about musicians are generally weak, ""8 Mile"" stands above average and succeeds delivering a tension-filled and well-written story, with characters worth caring about. It`s also one of the few mainstream movies that focuses on how`s life within the hip hop (sub)cultures that continue developing nowadays.

They know that he's a diamond ready to be cut but before that, he needs to be made known that he's TRULY something.  Eventually, he finds the truth & that he's courageous enough to take the next step into manhood, to be somebody.  I don't need to say more about Eminem's acting capability.  He's in his element & it's surprising to note his charisma on-screen.  It's difficult to get our eyes off him.  The supporting cast is amazing.  Brittany Murphy is convincing as a white trash girl who would ""sell"" her body to get somewhere; Mekhi Phiffer (the Negro doctor in ER)& Kim Basinger are all wonderful.  What made ""8 Mile"" even more compelling to watch is the slum neighbourhood in Detroit which the Director uses to his advantage.

3448736,4,B00009IB3B,"In Brief
No matter where we live, no matter who we are, we're all bound by borders, the people of Detroit know 8 Mile is the city limit, a border, a boundary. It is also a psychological dividing line that separates Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) from where he aspires to be.  Focusing around a week in the life of Jimmy, the story looks at his highs & lows, from the realities of life to the escapism found in performing, discovering where his journey has taken him, and what he must do to strive to make the change.
Review
The hype has died down and watching this again on the small screen at home still feels as engaging as it did in the cinema last year.  The common misconception about the movie relates to how much of the real Eminem one is seeing. While some similarities occur, it is far from being about the man himself.  Yet dotted around the film are some in-jokes and sly nudges that will mean more to the true fan such as the slow track into position of Jimmy sat beaten by life outside his trailer being identical to the iconic cover image of the Marshall Mathers LP.
Rising from the grime, Eminem's performance is both powerful and competent, allowing us generally to feel the character as a real person and thus making any sudden bursts of passion or rage as justified as the silence that surrounds them.  This is not the Eminem you will see on the stage; a casual session of Mc-ing in a lunch line seems genuine as the quiet white guy chips in for the first time, and we gradually see his confidence build in front of us.  There is something, dated about the narrative of this movie, you know the story and the inevitable conclusion.  Yet it is told with a style and freshness that draws you in as you come to relate with the daily grind and suffering that the mundane existence of life inflicts upon each and everyone of 8 mile's inhabitants.  Upon a second viewing the opening sequence is as strong as ever, as the nerves of a first time performance get the better of Jimmy and we literally experience his tension from inside his head, blocking the world out through our headphones as we practise our performance from a dank disgusting toilet.
Comparisons can easily be made to the underdog succeeding movies of the eighties such as Fame or Dirty Dancing, but neither come as close or as realistically to the work on offer here in anything other than a dated format.  In all honesty it is refreshing to see a group of people depicted in a film from a poor urban environment freak out at the sight of gun during a fight, rather than move to a mass response of automatic gunfire.  To put it simply this may not be Curtis Hanson's finest work but its certainly worth another viewing if not more, we all have to endure hardships but relatively few us bother to push ourselves, this film like its central figure will succeed in the decision to do it for itself.
The Verdict
Though the star & director combined to produce a sure-fire hit, no one could have predicted if it would have any worth or merit.  Its not the finest film of all time by any length but it definitely knows its limits and works within them well.  While the DVD does seem to lack the gross of features many have today, among them are a few gems such as a never-to-be-released Eminem video & 20 minutes of freestyle battles not featured in the movie. Its still the grittiest feel good film of the year and has some of the best beats on a soundtrack in a long time.  The bottom line: this is certainly not just another hip hop flick",1073433600,,3507,4.395061728395062

3448747,4,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile, while brilliant at times, is only alright for the majority of the movie. Following a low level plot line for most of the film, 8 Mile portrays Jimmy ""B Rabbit"" Smith (Eminem), a young, poor, struggling laborer living in a trailer in Detroit with his alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) and primary school aged sister. Jimmy is also an aspiring rapper, a rather obvious part of the movie as it is somewhat based on Eminem, who creates electrifying rhymes on the streets with friends and against rival crews. This movie takes a more sophistacated look than I would have expected at inner city life in a rough neighborhood and actually creates a sense of sympathy and hope for good will upon Rabbit that you would not expect to have for a gangster rapper. Urged by his friends to battle in local rap contests, Jimmy keeps refusing until he meets a girl at work (Britanny Murphy) who changes everything. At first Rabbit has trouble in battles and is swayed not to try again. But the movie is capped by a fantastic battle scene in which Eminem is spectacular. A better job than I would have expected from Eminem and a deeper look into life than just rap in this movie, but a poor conclusion in that a sequel appears imminent just by the ending, and a low level plot contribute to why this is not exactly an academy award caliber film.",1069977600,,1333,4.535269709543568
3448748,5,B00009IB3B,"I watched this film for two reasons: to try to understand the popularity of rap and to see if Eminem could act. The film succeeded on both counts. First, I learned to respect the musical genre more than I had before, coming to appreciate the essential character of the lyrics and picking up a basic vocabulary. As for acting, I thought Marshall Mathers did a fine job. While on paper the plot is a familiar one, about a young person wanting to move beyond their surroundings and better themselves using their own talents, the film still worked because Mathers aka Eminem aka Slim Shady has a charismatic screen presence. Like Sean Penn or Frank Sinatra, he is a thinking presence and fun to watch on the screen. The entire supporting cast is excellent, with Kim Basinger as B-Rabbit's troubled mother, Brittany Murphy as fellow traveller Alex and Mekhi Phifer as the friend we all wish we had. The B actors are solid and the club extras play a big role, bringing a real heartbeat to the rap battles at The Shelter. Which brings up the music. It's an excellent soundtrack -- a mix of classic rap by Old Dirty Bastard and many others, battle songs by street rappers, and a sense of the title song as a work in progress. I defy anyone who loves music to listen to the song 8 Mile and not enjoy it. It's strong, it's hopeful, and besides, it rocks.

The dvd extras are terrific, especially the 23-minute rap battle between Eminem and the four winners of a competition between 130+ extras; it was fun to listen to what the street rappers came up with slamming Eminem and what  Em improvised back. He's very funny. One also appreciates that he is hard working and a decent guy. Also interesting in the extras is hearing from director Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential) which makes me especially sorry there's no commentary track.  There is, however, a 10-minute featurette featuring Hanson and Mathers, song information and the ""Superman"" music video.

All in all, if you're interested in Eminem, rap, coming-of-age stories, films about urban America, good acting or films in which music plays a large role, this is a film you could definitely enjoy.",1069459200,,2141,4.701333333333333

Frankly the rap battles became tiresome early on, Brittany Murphy was wasted in a boring role in which she displayed morbid facial expressions while being hunched by Eminem, also Kim Basinger's melodramatic part didn't help matters. As for rap superstar Eminem's acting, it was fine. Believe me I wouldn't have any problems bashing it if it wasn't. I was under the impression that this was sorta based on Eminem's life, it's not. Or if it's supposed to be, it's simply dishonest. So in closing.. if you like rap music with an undying passion or aspire to be a rap artist, ""8 Mile"" may be worth your while.

I've heard over and over again about how amazing Eminem's acting is - he is pretty good in the movie... but come on - anyone can act out their life. I say give him a challenge. Put him in the role of a gay guy living in the upper east side and see how good of an actor he really is! Anyway, the movie isn't horrible- it's even worth watching once. But it was predictable, somewhat boring, and uneventful. The only outcome of the ending is that he was able to beat the other guy in the rap-off.

3448754,4,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile, a new film from Curtis Hanson and starring Eminem was actually quite good.  I saw this film nearly a year ago, in theatres during its opening weekend and I must say, I wasn't displeased.  Though Emimen never will be someone I admire, I must say that he does have talent and that he can, ok hear me out on this, ACT!
  The premise of 8 Mile is nothing incomprehensible, essentially Eminem plays Jimmy Rabbit, a guy from Detroit who has nothing going for him, but wants to be a rapper.  He has some good pals, including David Porter aka ""Future"" played nicely by Mekhi Pfiefer.  Rabbit lives in a trailor with his dissoluted mother played by Kim Basinger, they're relationship seems to be volatile and unsteady.  Gorgeous Brittany Murphy plays Alex, Emimen's love interest.  The film is nicely directed by Curtis Hanson also featuring a good screenplay from Scott Silver.  Hanson who made other great films including ""Wonder Boys"" and the excellent ""L.A. Confidential,"" makes another wonderful film here.
The true, exciting parts of this film are without question the rap battles, which are masterfully done.  Though I was sort of anticipating a nomination for the song ""Lose Yourself"", I didn't expect it to actually win.  I also thought that film might receive other nods, but oh well.  All in all, 8 Mile features a good cast.
  Some things which I'm still uncertain about is how accurate is this movie in accordance to the real life of Emimen?I'm sure some of it is, but how much?  The sex scene between Murphy and Emimen's characters seemed gratuitous, it didn't seem like there was any chemistry between them and the scene didn't seem to have any special meaning or purpose.  It was also a tad long, or so it seemed, but not specifically hardcore or graphic, as demonstarted in one scene inMonster' Ball.
  8 Mile is rated R for Strong Language, Sexuality, Some Violence and Drug Use.  The language well, sure that's obvious to expect and is the main reason for the ""R"" rating.  It's fairly strong, and is also included in rap lyrics besides dialogue.  The sexual content includes three fairly explicit sexual situations including the Murphy/Eminem sex scene.  No nudity, which they could've thrown in there cause it wouldn't have hurt or lessened the rating, and surprisingly there isn't any in the ""Uncensored"" edition on the DVD.  The violence isn't all particularly graphic or brutal, mainly some fistfights and a non-lethal shooting.  There is also some marijuana smoking.  All in all, a fine movie, worth owning on Video or DVD.",1067644800,,2546,4.837962962962963

The movie comes to climax as the reluctant warrior (Daniel-San/Eminem) battles at a open-mic ""tournament."" Just when you thought your wounded hero was down for the count he delivers a crushing blow that defeats the evil bully rappers.

3448762,3,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile is quite possibly one of the most over-praised films of 2002.  This doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, just not  the great film you've been hearing about.  In my personal opinion, critics and fans were so suprised that Eminem's foray into acting wasn't as bad as expected that they were stumbling all over themselves to praise what was essentially a cliched story of a down-and-out artist struggling to make it.
All of the over-used plot points are present: poverty, raw talent, troubled youth, resistance from parents and peers, a troubled relationship with a beautiful girl.  But in the hands of director Curtis Hanson and Eminem's suprisingly good acting (although he was essentially playing himself, so I'm not sure that its much of a stretch for him), the cliches don't seem to wear on the audience as much and you seem to connect with the his character and the troubles he faces.
The real triumph of 8 Mile has to be the Oscar-winning song ""Lose Yourself,"" Curtis Hanson's unique gift of perfectly recreating inner-city Detroit and the rap ""battles.""  I am not a fan of Eminem's music at all, but the relentless and driving beats and lyrics of Lose Yourself make it quite possibly one of the best songs released in the past decade and a deserved  Oscar winner.  Moreover, the way that Hanson brings the viewer into Detroit circa-1994 and the aspects of life at that time (especially the ""battles"") is brilliant and is one of the numerous aspects of the film that helped me overlook the tortured cliches.  It really helps the viewer connect with the characters in my opinion.
Bottom line:  if you have a free night, and some extra cash rent it.  If you aren't a fan of Eminem, at least consider it.  It's not nearly as bad as you might think.",1065139200,,1759,4.678571428571429

3448764,4,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile shows how Marshall Mather's (a.k.a Eminem) life was before he got with Dr. Dre. 8 Mile shows Eminem's frustration and anger at his mom in every day of his life. The plot of the movie is very surprizing, it makes you so excited and thinking on what Eminem is going to do next. In 8 Mile Eminem plays as Jimmy Smith (a.k.a B Rabbit), who has a hidden talent for rapping but cannot express it in front of rap battles because he is scared. In his first battle he gets stage fright with people booing at him since he is the under-dog. He works as a mechanic, lifting parts of cars. He raps around his friends and on the streets and makes a big show at a lunch break by battling this other rapper that was dissing a lady who was rapping called Vennesa. He meets a girl called Alex who he secretly likes, she gives him a little inspiration on becoming what he wants to be. He doesn't go to any rap battles anymore because a friend of his called ""Wink"" told him that he could get him a record deal. Later he has problems with his Mom when he had a fight with her because he didn't want his step-dad treating her like garbage. His friend ""Future"" signs him up for a rap battle at the shelter, but Rabbit doesn't want to go so they start a fight. He goes later to a radio station where ""Wink"" said that he could get noticed there. He goes up and in another room he sees ""Wink"" making out with Alex, Rabbit gets frustrated and beats up ""Wink"". Later at Rabbit's trailer ""Wink"" shows up with his friends known as ""The Free World"" and they seriously beat him up. He realizes later that no one can get him to have a record deal except himself. He goes to the shelter for the Rap Battle Championship. He sees ""Future"" there and Rabbit apologizes to him and they become friends again. After that, the biggest Rap Battle showdown begins, he viciously disses the first 2 rappers, and he goes to the finals. B Rabbit goes first this time and disses the third rapper so hard that he chokes when its his turn and forfeits the battle. B Rabbit is the champion now but doesn't want to battle anymore and returns to doing his job as being a mechanic. This movie is very inspiring. A must-see movie for all rap fans.

3448767,4,B00009IB3B,"Rap music, popular for a couple of decades now, has taken a lot of heat lately, primarily due to it being interpreted as ""gangsta"" rap, and held responsible for breakdown in social order. The group labeled as ""right-wing conservatives"", however inaccurate this term may be, has been quoted as being against the ""phenomenon of rap music"", for the reason that such music instills debauchery, violence, lack of ambition, and disrespect for family values.
 I viewed this film while on vacation, and the splurges in free time that accompany such endeavors instigate that new things be tried: that one entertain oneself with the unusual. The persons with me on the vacation were curious as to the content of the movie, and so with popcorn, beer, and an open mind, we sat down on a not-so-comfortable couch and concentrated our attention to what some have called ""proof"" of the decline of U.S. culture.
 What we viewed was interesting, and not what we expected. But art has the habit of bringing you out of equilibrium, and this piece of art, this movie, was a pretty strong perturbation. What was observed was a character with a strong work ethic: working by day, rapping by night. A character with deep concern with his baby sister's care and well-being.  A character whose ambition to break from his routine and find something better bordered on obsession. A character who insisted on being genuine, on being honest with himself, and not masking your origins or upbringing.
 [Are these not ""family values""? Will Western civilization decay because of the practice of values like these?]
 Was he a ""perfect"" character? Well, no: he broke with his girlfriend when learning (or making the assumption) she was pregnant. He was violent at times, and followed the crowd without question at one point (the burning of the vacant house). He let himself be intimidated (at first) by an audience.
 This character clearly believed in the value of a focused life: his  extreme note-taking for his eventual musical rap confrontations. A random walk through life was not going to get him where he wanted to be. Playing bingo, like his mother, and not planning...not working, was not the way.
 The harsh language in the rap confrontations is balanced by its inventiveness, its creativity. It is actually very fun. One can get intoxicated with its free play. All discovery originates this way: the formalities come later, and these are then etched in stone, with later generations to question and possibly rebel against.",1061683200,,2498,4.973621103117506

3448769,4,B00009IB3B,"Regardless of how you feel personally towards Eminem, his lyrics or Rap music in general, you must give the rapper credit where it is due.  He has an amazing ability to link words and rhymes to make you laugh at yourself, him and others.  His talent as a writer and rapper shine in this movie.
Eminem plays a young man struggling to escape the poverty he was raised in.  Much of the story takes place at 8 Mile, a stereotypical trailer park in Detroit where Rabbit (Eminem) is forced to moved back home to when he leaves his pregnant girlfriend.  There he faces his mother's failings as both a parent and a human being, trying to shield a young sister from the horrors of life including his mother's drunken stupors and violence.
His escape and dreams revolve around rap music.  Not being very familiar with this type of music myself, I found the battle scenes very interesting and they are without a doubt the best parts of the movie.  My favorite being an impromptu rap Rabbit creates with a friend to Sweet Home Alabama while trying to fix a car.  The humor and self mockery in the situation seem to sum up the whole movie.
I would equate this movie with Saturday Night Fever.  The story line is very similar.  A struggling minority (as Rabbit would be one of the few whites attending these battles) facing poverty, growing up and facing his responsibilties.  I thing this movie may in a lot of ways bring some of the hidden aspects of hip hop life styles and rap battles to public light.
One thing I will admit to being surprised about was the lack of swearing in this movie.  Don't get me wrong, the movie did have it's share, but there was not nearly as much as I had assumed there would be.  It is still not a movie for children though.
I was disappointed with the character of Alix played by Brittany Murphy.  For the most part I really felt her role in the film was unnecessary and the sex scene was placed for shock value only.  Again though, it was one of the less racy sex scenes I have seen though.
Eminem does an excellent job acting in this movie, but it is easy to act from experience.  I will not claim he is the next cross over star until I have seen him act in a film that does not mirror his own life.

I am so unacquainted with the star, ""Eminem"" that I've just learned he doesn't spell his name ""M&M"".  But because this film has gotten so much attention, I  thought it would be good for me to check out what for me is a culture stranger than that depicted in the foreign films that I watch all the time.
The story is supposedly a fictionalized version of Eminem's own roots.  It's set in Detroit, where ""8 Mile"" is the area that separates the black and white neighborhoods.  The character Eminem plays is named ""Rabbit"" and he grows up in a trailer park with his mother, played by Kim Bassinger, who is excellent in the role.  His little sister is exposed to his mother's numerous boyfriends and it is with this little girl that Rabbit shows the most tenderness.  Rabbit works in a car plant but his whole life is about rap music and he hangs out with a group of both African American and white friends who feel the same way.
There are scenes in the film which show what rap is all about.  It's not about the big money and the trashy lyrics.  Instead, it's about disadvantaged people who communicate the frustrations of their lives.  Much of it is spontaneous.  And much of it is competitive, where insults fly and there's always a battle to see who will win over the audience.  And an audience can be bystanders by a lunch wagon as well as in a club.
I liked the part that Eminem played.  He comes across as real.  He wears a wool cap through much of the film, making his skin look very pale and his light eyes defiant. He shows vulnerability as well as strength and I rooted for him throughout.  This was not surprising because the film has a good script and is well paced with plenty of confrontations and tension.  What surprised me is how much I enjoyed the rap music.  It's all about words and being creative.  And doing it to a rhythm.  At first it was a little hard to understand.  But by the end of the film I was completely won over to rap as an art form.
I loved ""8 Mile"" and highly recommend it.",1059609600,,2125,4.302267002518891
3448775,3,B00009IB3B,"The acting debut of Eminem in ""8-Mile"" makes for an excellent breakthrough for the popular rap star. Em (real name: Marshall Mathers) is Jimmy Smith (a.k.a. ""Rabbit""), a working-class white kid from the racially-divided lines of inner Detriot.
Smith lives in a trailer park with his alcoholic mom and her much younger boyfriend but spends his days, working in a garage, and looks to make ends meet as a rapper. He has two ways of doing this: One, through battle-rapping at a club spot hosted by his best friend, Future, and the other is relying on help from a so-called talent agent.
While this movie is highly entertaining upon first view, it definetly suffers from some horrible writing and real lackluster characters (other than its lead). For some reason, all of Rabbit's buddies have nothing better to do than wait around for him to decide what he wants. It seems rather unlikely that in a movie set in 1995 when white rappers were viewed as jokes, that a handful of Smith's black followers would stand around with nothing better to do than wait on their ""white savior"". His black militant friend takes the cake as far as ""filler"" characters go. He seems to just take up space as he waits to throw out a cheesy sterotypical line about being held down. He goes nowhere with these opinions and just seems to stand around, playing the background.
Eminem, himself, is great as Smith but he seems too much like a good character in a movie filled with bad cartoon characters. He's a deep character stuck in SAVE THE LAST DANCE. That's right. This script makes some of the same mistakes as ""Last Dance"" in its belief that urban kids stand around and talk about ""hip-hop lingo"" like they are explaining it to a documentarian. To be fair, it's not quite as bad as ""Last Dance"" but it does get really annoying. The story involving Smith and his mother makes for some good moments but it still doesn't quite make up for such awful characters.
This is actually a real good movie at times but again, the script could certainly have stood to go through a few more re-writes. And while I'm talking, this DVD could have used a lot more special features such as some videos, deleted scenes, and an audio commentary.

In both the classic disco movie and this modern rap movie, music is a driving force. Also, the main characters in both movies (John Travolta and Eminem) are depressed, repressed, living in slums and beaten down by their unsympathetic families. Both have moronic (but loyal) friends who they fight rival groups with and who they perform stupid stunts with (SNF: jumping around on the Brooklyn Bridge; 8: burning down an abandoned house). Both keep their heads above water strictly because of their burning desire to perform.
Both John Travolta and Eminem took hold of their roles with unexpected fervor. Both were real and sympathetic.
I began gaining a slow respect for Eminem with his latest album, and now it is solidified with his performance in 8 Mile. Eminem plays this character with heart. This movie deserves to share the classic status of Saturday Night Fever.",1058918400,,987,4.880952380952381

3448778,5,B00009IB3B,"I've never been crazy about Eminem, but he makes an auspicious debut with confidence and command. Curtis Hanson, director, has always paid great attention to detail (think ""L A Confidential"") and, once again, uses Kim Basinger to good advantage. Eminem, indeed, had a tough role; to maintain his identity while taking care of his crazy mother, and showing genuine love for his little sister; then, to deal with a flaky girlfriend and a gang of Detroit ""Urbanites"" (for won't of a better word). His performance is complete. There's a terrific 2.35:1 Widescreen, showing all the craziness of the audiences, and the bleakness of the slums. Powerful! My only complaint is, at the beginning, the music overpowered the dialogue quite often. The Sound director got it together about half way through, but there were some important dialogues at the beginning that helped you to know what his problem was, and it required a bit of attention. Eminem's music appeals to many (he wrote ALL of the music), but I chose to buy it because some reliable friends told me how good it was as drama. Yes, it's good. It's also one of those ""David & Goliath"" films, where the underdog makes good. I actually like those kinds of films. Eminem did a fine job; but can he do ""Hamlet""? Keanu Reeves did.",1058745600,,1276,4.778280542986425

That having been said, this is a great film and Marshall Mathers was born to play this role.
In other reviews I have read accounts of actors who played one part and then faded off into obscurity, never to be heard from again. I can only hope that this is the case with Emininem. As far as I can see playing Rabbit in 8 Mile is the one gleaming jewel in this man's career.
I have no idea how autobiographical the plot is, but Rabbit's determination to persevere in the Rap Battles and the efforts he puts into his rhymes are inspirational. The ending is poetic and strangely fitting. This is not an device to promote a flash in the pan talent. It is a real film with weight and merit.
The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Brittney Murphy does drama far better than her shot at goofy comedy in that Ashton Kutcher wedding flick. She grounds Rabbit and shows that with the love of the right woman any man can be saved.
Kim Bassinger, though far too beautiful for the role, plays the trailer trash mother straight and poignantly. Her scenes with Mathers go from highly comic to suspenseful and dramatic. An Oscar nomination would not have been out of place for her work here.

He goes back to live with his mother who lives in a trailer with her boyfriend who is a trailer-trash loser and Jimmy's sister, Lili. He starts writing the song ""Lose Yourself"" and hopes to make it into a demo. He works at a factory and falls for his boss' sister.

3448782,5,B00009IB3B,"Being an eminem fan I saw this movie the day it came out in theatres. I didn't know what to expect, I knew the Eminem could rap but had no idea about his acting skills.
I'm not going to say he was amazing and deserved an award for his performance but he was better than I expected. His character, Rabbit, came off as very real (although that was probably due to the fact that this movie had a strong resemblance to his actual life). Several other characters in this movie, from his friends Future and Cheddar to his alcoholic mother were likable in there own way.
I left the movie feeling uplifted. The movie had several good lessons in it and, thank God, did not have a sell-out hollywood ending in which Eminem would be on stage rapping his hit song and getting a record contract.
The acting was good, the rapping was amazing and the storyline had a good flow to it. I suggest that anyone who is a fan of Eminem to see this movie and even if you're not, you should give the movie a chance. You may take something away from it.",1056585600,,1028,4.25
3448783,5,B00009IB3B,"I was extremely impressed with Eminem's screen debut, all the more so in that I am not at all a fan of rap.  Unlike many other musical performers who try their hand at acting, Eminem is a natural in front of the camera, never coming across like an actor wannabe, never having dreadful moments in the film like one finds in similar efforts by Mariah Carey or Madonna.  Moreover, the world in which Rabbit, the rapper Eminem portrays, lives is portrayed vividly and convincingly.  It is a bleak, unpleasant, unforgiving world that offers little in the way of a future.
It is not a perfect film.  Some of the characters struck me more as caricatures, like Kim Basinger's portrayal of Rabbit's mother.  The mixture of friends wasn't completely convincing.  Brittany Murphy's character is so vague as to be indecipherable.  But despite the holes, the movie at its core is powerful and convincing.
The central event of the film is the ""battle"" of rappers near the end.  At this point the movie feels more like a Western than anything, with young pretender to the crown of ""Fastest Gun in Town"" taking on and vanquishing all comers.  These are among the best scenes in the film.
But in the end, many crucial issues are left untouched.  One of the central dilemmas and contradictions of Eminem's career is his being white but having excelled in an overwhelmingly black musical genre.  This crucial issue in Eminem's career was not addressed as explicitly in 8 MILE as I would have liked.  It is referred to, but for the most part Rabbit's presence on the rap scene is accepted more than discussed.  The central question of why a white kid would become a rapper is in the end not mentioned at all.  Why did Rabbit cross over to a black musical genre?  Interestingly, at one point in the film a movie is playing on TV.  I recognized it as Douglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE, a 1959 film in which a beautiful, light-skinned black girl passes for white, only to meet tragedy when the white kids discover she is black.  Clearly this is intended to hint at the danger Rabbit is encountering in crossing racial boundaries, but it still doesn't answer the question of why he wanted to cross over to begin with.  Why rap instead of punk?  Why hip hop instead of a predominantly white form of music?  None of this is dealt with, but it remains the central unresolved issue in the film.",1056240000,,2365,4.6124401913875595

3448787,2,B00009IB3B,"Having grown up on 7 Mile (well, OK, far enough west of Detroit to own a horse) and with recommendations not only from 15-year-olds but my higher-ups at work, I was pretty curious to see this movie.  Besides,  ""Lose Yourself"" had already won my heart. Too bad ""8 Mile"" is not a full representation of that song, in all its angst and anxious ambition.
The plot (what there is of one) has already been thoroughly discussed in prior reviews (B. Rabbit, resident of the ""uncool"" burbs north of 8 Mile, chokes during his first rap face-off, meets a girl, hangs out with his  buds from the cool, burnt-out slums south of 8 Mile, and eventually blows away the crowd with a rap worthy of Slim Shady hisself.)Actually, there is a great deal of potential in this story, which is the greatest disappointment.
The rap scenes are great, unsurprisingly.  My favorite is the informal contest Rabbit gets into on a lunch break at the factory. And he's not Sir Laurence Olivier, but Mr. Mathers scores somewhere between Elvis and Madonna on the ""Sure, the kid can sell CDs but can he act?"" applause-o-meter. Anyway, you don't watch Eminem in a movie to watch him act, I presume;  you go to hear him rap.
The other scenes are very difficult to either sit through, or understand.  For example, Kim Basinger is downright embarrassing as Rabbit's mom.  Just what we need: a movie enforcing more stereotypes, like the welfare mom in a trailer who is oversexed, neglects her kids, and has a fake southern accent (in Michigan?).  And it took the whole movie for me to figure out that ""the 810"" and ""the 313"" refer to area codes...and I LIVE here!  The rest of Rabbit's friends' dialogue flew by so fast I frequently was lost in the dust.
Finally, the values promoted in the film seem at cross purposes.  Rabbit stands for loyalty, both to his friends and his family (even his wayward mom), trying to shield his sister from the violence that comes his way in the film.  But after his girlfriend flippantly cheats on him, her re-entrance into his life without remorse or forgiveness is completely unexplained.  (did a major scene get cut?) So is loyalty important, or not? And anger about urban blight leads to the gang burning down an abandoned, burned out house where they've learned someone was raped.  No consequences ensue.  The sentiments are understandable, but it would have been more interesting to at least touch on the fact that commiting a felony could leave a young life in ruins.  The film never addresses the subject again.
So, when he's rapping, the star shines.  When he's not, the script is confusing.
For Eminem devotees only.  Everybody else, just fast forward to the rap scenes.",1054771200,,2673,4.701716738197425

3448789,3,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile (Curtis Hanson, 2002)
I had to rent it. I had to find out why Curtis Hanson, the director of such beautiful films as L. A. Confidential, Bad Influence, and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle could possibly see in the life story of Eminem. And whether you like this film or not is probably going to rest, in no small part, on how you see it. If it is meant as a biography of Eminem, it is unforgivably revisionist; if it is meant fictionally, it's at least partially redeemable.
Hanson turns in his usual above-average direction, while Scott Silver (he of the timeless script for The Mod Squad) shows that he actually does have a modicum of screenwriting talent. His film is about as shallow as a desert pond, but he can do better than The Mod Squad, and did here. Add in Brian Grazer (a man whose output defines the term ""mediocre"") and Jimmy Iovine (I know music, I do. What's this ""film"" stuff?) as producers, and Eminemn doesn't have much going for him behind the scenes other than, well, Curtis Hanson.
Somehow, Hanson managaes to almost putt his fat out of the fire. Eminem's charisma translates well into film. but that's about all that makes it worth watching. Brittany Murphy (The Prophecy II, Cherry Falls) is wooden, and her relationship with Eminem's character Bunny Rabbit is completely unbelievable... Now, for the good parts. Greg (Michael Shannon of Tigerland fame), Rabbit's high school classmate and now Stephanie's live-in boyfriend, finally drops the idea that he's not Ray Liotta, and takes on a role that has him looking and sounding as Liotta-like as possible. It works. Mekhi Phifer (O, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), as Rabbit's best friend Future, finally gets his teeth into a role that allows him to shine. Between those two and Eminem, there's enough decent acting here to make it watchable.
But is it the biography of Eminem that word on the street had it being? No way. The Eminem who wrote the songs on his first two albums is not the blue-collar I-love-my-family-and-defend-the-concept-of-homosexuality guy Rabbit is. It is tempting to see 8 Mile as another step in the sanitization of the image of Eminem; whether it is meant as biography or not, Eminem still comes off looking like he either isn't the person on his first two albums, or is trying to repent for that person.
If you like Eminem, you've probably already seen it. If you don't, it's probably worth a rental. The documentary about the rap battles included as an extra on the DVD sums up a good portion of the reason why the parts of this film that don't work don't work. Hanson up on stage talking to a cast of three hundred fifty extras about kickin' it in rap battles and sounding Harvard-educated while doing it. Still, if you don't approach it too seriously, it's not a bad way to [spend] two hours. ** ",1053993600,,2815,4.652610441767068

Then all throughout the movie Em' and his homeboys roll through the city doing dumb stuff. But the ending is completely annoying, it needs a sequel on it to show how the rest of B Rabbit's life went on to be. Good movie, could have been better. Wasn't enough battling, even amount of sex, even amount of violence, not even comedy. But to conclude, this is a good movie.

3448791,4,B00009IB3B,"As many people have already said in their positive reviews, ""8 Mile"" is really a surprisingly good film, both gritty and truthful.  I know and you know that the film is NOT exactly what happened to Eminem, a now celebrated rapper with strong messages.  The film is a gentler and softer version of his real life, but thanks to the sure hand of director Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential fame), the total result is more than satisfactory.  And yes, though basically 'as himself', he can act pretty good.
'8 Mile' is a real place in Detroit where Eminem is raised, and here stands as a symbol of the borderline where two kinds of people meet.  Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers III) plays his alter ego Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith, who struggles to make it in rap music where black people are dominant.  But at the crutial moment during the amateur contest for rappers (the battle, they call it), his tongue which should be always acid fails him.
Then the film follows the life of Jimmy and his friends, and how he finds the way he should live his life in spite of his messy surroundings including his girlfriend (Brittany Murphey) and his mother (Kim Basinger).  The final scenes, even for the audiences like me who don't know much about rap music, are very exciting and rousing.  In fact we come to like this guy Jimmy.
For his avid fans, the film may look too tame, but you have to admit that film is made for wider audience in mind.  Jimmy has a sister, but fans might instead remember his (Eminem's) own daughter when looking at her.  But forget those things outside the screen for a while.  This is a story about an angry man who doesn't know into what kind of shapes he should turn the enormous anger.
The film has very authentic atmosphere of Detroit, and does not fail to reflect the social background of the characters.  But as I said, we should watch this one as a story with universal appeal.  If you don't like hip-hop or rap, never mind.  You just don't have to.  Because ""8 Mile"" has vast power to make you understand why he is so popular among his fans.",1053993600,,2057,4.479892761394102
3448792,4,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile isn't your typical rapper movie by any lengths.  It has established actors with a terrific director, and the big bonus is that the rapper himself can actually act.
Eminem proves to the whole world that he isn't a one dimensional celebrity and can hold his own with the best of them (i.e. Kim Basinger).  Does he deserve an Oscar, though?  Absolutely not, not even close.  But, in an increasingly popular trend where music stars cross over into the movie industry, he topples them all.  This isn't unprecedented with the likes of Madonna making the switch, but it's always intriguing and quite surprising when a rapper can make the transition so easily and smoothly.
There are some Hollywoodish qualities in the movie, and that just makes it interesting.  What movie has ever been made that the ""based on"" storyline isn't tweaked here and there to make it an interesting movie?
8 Mile didn't jump down any levels on the side stories, like so many movies in this genre do.  There wasn't a point in the movie that I felt bored or turned off, which is what one would expect from a movie with Eminem cast as the lead.
By the end of the movie, I felt a genuine sympathy for Rabbit and wanted nothing more than to see him prevail against all odds.  That's the mark of good directing and even more important, terrific acting.  4 Stars",1053388800,,1333,4.567226890756302

The story is mainly about about this guy called rabbit(eminem) who has been brought up in the poor... suburbs of detroit, and his mum(kim basinger) is very strugling with money and depending on bingo games, and rabbit is taking up a job as a car manufacturer, and he is willing to be a successful rapper, though at first he was a not so good rapper, and he is also being bullied by some blacks seeming he is like one of the only white rappers in town, and as we get closer to the middle of the film rabbit falls in love with this girl(brittany murphy), and a bit after the middle she becomes very impressed with eminems rapping and they then fall in love with each other.
One of the main things i didn't expect in this movie is the humor, i just didn't know that there would be some humor, any way yes this movie actually is quite a funny and sweet movie. The funny parts in the movie are mainly the rap battles where other rappers go against each other and humiliate each other. Now onto the sweet part of the movie, yes this movie is actually sweet. Apart from the racism and bullying, this movie is very sweet. I thought the relationships of eminem and his friends in the movie was very sweet, because they always stuck up for each other, laughed with each other and apart from those arguments they have had, they where overall best friends and where always there for each other.
Ok now im sure there are some parents who would like to know if this is suitable for their children so heres a fairly brief classification on the movies language, violence, drug use and sexual content.
LANGUAGE: This movie contains alot of coarse language, though most of the time it is used for silly reasons or as a joke. The film has alot of racism especially held at whites, so yeah be warned that this movie is high on coarse language.
VIOLENCE: This movie does not contain any deaths, though it has alot of gang fights(fights with no weapons), and this movie is very very low on gore. The goriest bit in the movie is when rabbits friend accidently shots himself in the leg, though survives. So this movie is low on violence.
DRUG USE: This movie contains a bit of drug use, though alot of drinking and drunk characters and a bit of smoking, so overall this movie is average on drug use.
SEXUAL CONTENT: This movie has about three sex scenes in it. The first one isn't to bad, the third one isn't to bad, though the seconde one is very big. The movie contains a bit of nudity, but not to much kissing. Though the all three sex scenes aren't explicit. Overall this movie is average on sexual content.

3448796,4,B00009IB3B,"I have to admit I didn't even know who Eminem was until ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" came out in the summer of 2000.  When I first heard ""The Real Slim Shady"" on the radio that summer, I honestly thought it was some kind of practical joke.  Could anyone's voice really be that nasal?
Of course, the joke was on me.  The joke's on everyone when it comes to Eminem.  The morning that ""8 Mile"" came out, I heard two radio hosts in New York City (a right-wing social crusader, and a left-wing civil rights lawyer) debating Eminem.  One host decried Eminem, while the other lauded him, and it's not hard to figure out which host took which side.  Obviously, once I heard the debate phrased in those terms, I simply had to go see the film.
""8 Mile"" is well worth owning on DVD -- if nothing else, for those of us less than fluent in hip-hop, the English subtitles make the movie remarkably easier to understand.  In the theater, the film was inspirational, without being hokey.  It stands up to repeated viewings, which is the mark of a truly good film.  Director Curtis Hanson has made increasingly solid movies throughout his career (his early ""The Little Dragons"" was banned to the purgatory of monthly airings on the Lifetime Network in the late '80s; now he's an Oscar winner) and in ""8 Mile"" he pushes all the right buttons without ever producing anything phony.
The magic element that makes ""8 Mile"" hang together is Eminem... of course.  Rabbit's an anti-hero, who picks a fight every ten minutes and loses most of them.  His film romance (with Brittany Murphy) is limited to an erotic encounter in an auto-stamping factory; the would-be couple's romantic gesture involves the middle finger.  If you're expecting ""8 Mile"" to conclude with a triumphant record deal and a marriage proposal, you're in the wrong theater.
The supporting cast in ""8"" mile is also notable.  Mekhi Phifer, who first came to my attention with an explosive recurring role on the penultimate season of ""Homicide"", is outstanding as Rabbit's hip-hop mentor and would-be sponsor.  Someone named Evan Jones is quite likeable as ""Cheddar Bob"", quite possibly the dumbest sidekick to appear in a movie since Steve Buscemi in ""The Big Lebowski"".  Sample exchange: ""I need some privacy."" ""Can I come with you?"".  The third notable character is Detroit itself.  Here's one of the bleakest movie landscapes ever, and it's all filmed ""entirely on location in the 313"", as the film's credits tell us.
The extras are a little weak.  The ""making of"" featurette runs just 10 minutes and doesn't seem to involve any original contribution by Eminem himself.  Well done, however, is the music soundtrack options, which all you to jump directly to the scene in the movie in which a particular song appears.  You can also watch the film's excellent freestyle battles this way.
The finest feature on the disc is a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of the freestyle battles.  Here we see the ""American Idol""-style selection process of four extras who'll get to actually battle Eminem in the movie.  The feature is all the more  riveting for the fact that this sequence didn't make the final cut.  This feature is the closest that the ""8 Mile"" DVD comes to actually penetrating Eminem's barriers and getting a look at the real man himself.",1052611200,,3293,4.777385159010601

3448800,5,B00009IB3B,"First of all Id like to say how nice it is to see a major DVD release that is offered in FULL SCREEN format as well as widescreen. It's nice to have the choice for those of us who prefer not to have the black bars present everytime we watch a DVD.
Now on to the movie itself. I WAS REALLY SHOCKED! When I saw previews for this movie, it made me curious, and also a bit uninterested at the same time. The previews didn't say ANYTHING about the plot or what the movie was about, basically all they said about the film was ""hey Eminem made a movie! Go watch it because he's in it!"". I hate hype like that. So I was worried this movie would be another stupid mainstream, hyped up movie that would ultimatley [be unacceptable]. But I was wrong!
The movie is roughly based around Eminem's own life; how he was poor, living in a trailor with a bad mother, and basically had a really bad life. The birght spot in his life? - Hip-hop. The character goes through a lot of drama with friends, and has to overcome both the oppression of others and his own hang ups in order to make it. Basically it's a movie about battle rapping and the hip-hop culture on the streets of detroit and how it impacted his life.
Many people won't understand the plot because they don't understand hip-hop and can't relate. But this is a pretty original story-line. It's almost like a sports movie... sort of like remember the titans only instead of football the sport is battle rap. For those who don't understand battle rap it may not make any sense or seem stupid. If you're a true fan of hip-hop you'll love this movie.
The battles are well-crafted and hilarious. I don't know who actually wrote all the rhymes but they are lyrically very nice. The acting too, is off the hook. Eminem does a really good job playin his character, and all the characters are likeable. All around this movie is well done and was a really nice surprise for me. The message of overcoming obsticales and finding your own niche in life is well woven into the story. If you hate eminem (and I know lots of parents or rap-haters do) you may come to respect him after watching the movie. I like to think little marshal has more in common with B Rabbit than he does his alter ego ""slim shady"".
Check it out before ya buy, and if it aint your thing, then you aint gonna like it (people who just watch MTV videos and have no REAL understanding of what hip hop really is), but I loved it, and I think many others are surprised that this movie was as good as it was.",1052179200,,2507,4.28

3448802,5,B00009IB3B,"Most song artists are bad at acting. Eminem is very good in this movie. He looks so into his character (probably because it's mostly his life before he got famous). I watched this movie over and over again. You can really just feel his pain. I'm not too fond of Britney Murphy so I think they could've found someone better for her part, but she did an ok job. Kim Basinger had the perfect part and she was awesome.
The movie is basically about battle-rapping in Detroit and trying to get a rap deal. He goes through everything from having to move back into the trailer with his mom....getting in fights with rival groups....and trying to not let his little sister see the bad life he lives. I can't give too much away because I'll ruin it for you. This is probably one you want to rent before you buy it if you aren't a big Eminem or rap fan. It's a great movie though.",1051920000,,869,4.2727272727272725
3448803,4,B00009IB3B,"The acting in this film is what first gets my nod. Eminem, Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy do a great job portraying different white trash lifestyles and struggles. Granted the cinematic exaggeration, the acting is so real some might think the film a documentary. That's how good the characters are played.
The second thing that gets my nod is the music. I am a fan of Eminem's music; subsequently, I love the soundtrack to this film. The title song and ""Lose Yourself"" are absolutely phenomenal songs that appeal to all music lovers (even if you don't like rap, you will at least appreciate the talent in these two songs if you appreciate music at all).
All in all, this is a good heavy drama to watch on a weekday night. Certainly not for family entertainment night, but it sure will satisfy your needs for art and realism you expect to get from a well-done drama.",1051920000,,867,4.6
3448804,5,B00009IB3B,"This movie was outstanding. Eminem does a good job in his debut and lead role as B Rabbit. From director Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) this movie is about Rabbit trying to make his way out of 8 mile mobile court. His mom is a drunk with no job, and her boyfriend is a loser. Rabbit is very concerned about his kid sister. He works at a factory and is going nowhere. He meets a girl (Brittany Murphy) and likes her. He does rap battles in hopes of a record deal. Alright, enough about the plot, I don't want to ruin it. What made this movie so good, was the comedy aspect of it. It's set in a ghetto, and Rabbit and his friends are poor, but their so funny, I laughed so hard when Cheddar Bob shot himself by accident, and the fat guy is a riot, he constantly makes hilarious jokes. I suggest you rent this at the LEAST.

3448805,5,B00009IB3B,"Hi!  I'm the rating system.  Have we met before?  I'm not sure if we have since I see a lot of people shocked by the content of the movie.  Anyway, I show up to let people know what to expect when they see a movie so that they don't witness something that they don't want to see, and instead see something they do.  Or, I give warning so that they can enjoy something they know they won't be offended by.
In this movie, you can find me shaped like a big letter ""R.""  Why?  Well to start, there's a lot of bad words.  Also, there's some graphic displays of sex which only adults should see.  Don't forget the violence too!  Now keep in mind, ""R"" means that if you're under 17, you shouldn't see this movie since you're not mature enough for it.  For the rest of you, ask yourself, ""If a 16-year-old might be shocked by this movie, will I be?""  If it's yes, don't see this movie.
Now then, if the stuff I've listed doesn't offend you too much, or you don't mind it in context with the movie, you'll like this movie!  In order to know what shape to take, I had to sit through this whole movie.  After watching it, I realized that if you're to enjoy this movie, you can't judge Eminem by the musician he is.  I know because sometimes I take the form of a ""Parental Advisory Sticker!""  See, on Eminem's CD's, he tries to shock you.  In this movie, he tries to tell a story.  He's not the same person in both!
In this movie, he does a great job of telling that story too.  You really feel like you understand what he's going through even though you might be from a small town in Kansas.  From being a shy laid back guy who's trying to keep his family going while trying to be a success, to discovering his talent, Eminem left me feeling that I want to be the best rating label I can be!  I'm sure it left others feeling like they can do anything too.  I can't promise that you'll like every scene in this movie, but as long as you take a look at what's in the movie based on what I tell you, I think you'll make the wise decision.",1051488000,,2024,4.096692111959287
3448806,5,B00009IB3B,"It helps to have listened to some rap music but it's not a requirement for seeing and appreciating this film. Eminem is nothing less than wonderful in his first starring role and brings surprising energy and intelligence to his role as would-be rapper Rabbit. Everything about the film feels right, feels authentic--including the rivalries and the affection shared by Rabbit and his friends. The big bonus is Kim Basinger (who owns an academy award for L.A. Confidential--for reasons not at all clear to me) who pulls out all the stops and turns in a stunningly gritty performance here as Rabbit's slow-witted, beer-swilling, man-hungry trailer park mother. This film doesn't feel artificial in any way; all the sets seem realer than real and the aura of poverty is almost tangible. While the story of a young man with a dream isn't anything new, the script, the performances and Eminem elevate it beyond the ordinary. And big points have to go to the non-Hollywood ending. Reality is winning the day and then catching a bus to go back to work.
Highly recommended.",1051056000,,1064,4.916666666666667
3448807,1,B00009IB3B,"To me, Eminem's music is boring, aggravating, poseur schlop. This movie is no better. This, along with xXx (aka zZz) and the Fast and the Furious (aka the Slow and the Timid), go under the category of brain-dead flavor-of-the-week ""cinema"". I quote a reviewer of Fast and the Furious: ""Is this what 100 years of filmmaking has led up to?"" It's not even worthy of any more of a review.",1050537600,,384,4.5
3448808,5,B00009IB3B,"It's good to see poverty on the big screen.  It's good for suburban vouyers to see what goes on in the ""other"" part of town, the places they don't stop to ask directions or don't care about politically.  I already liked Eminem and rap music in general, so I'm biased as hell.  But I have to admit that I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was, though the director has a proven track record.  It surely beat out ""Glitter"" and ""Cross Roads"" and whatever that cheezy Mandy Moore movie was.  Granted I didn't see those, so, once again, I'm biased as...
  The only thing that upset me was that I knew how the haters out there would react.  ""Oh, so THAT's all him and his friends think could get them out of the ghetto--RAP!  What about a good job or school, huh?""
  Well, these people obviously don't know what it's like to have dead-end jobs that pay at or just above minimum-wage dominate your area, or schools where you're more scared of being beaten or worse than why X equals Y or whatever nonsense pales in comparison to the surrounding realities.  Plus the misery that your parents go through when they're stuck in the same hopeless cities.  BUT, you see, THAT's why the message of this movie is uplifting in a twisted way.  Rap, my dear reader, is the poetry of the streets, of frustration.  It's a cry for the world that often ignores you to actually UNDERSTAND you.  (Listen to Wu-Tang's old song, C.R.E.A.M, or 'Cash Rules Everything Around Me.'  It's a classic)  And, for all of you who deplore the ""violence"" in the lyrics (funny, I never saw nobody shot with a mouth.  If you want violence, try the If It Bleeds It Leads evening news or obsessive, war-happy news), pay attention to the movie.  The ""rap battles"" that Rabbit and his friends enjoy performing in or watching REPLACES THE VIOLENCE.  These young people are actually avoiding the brutality of the street by acting out their agression ON STAGE rather than in the streets and VERBALLY rather than physically.  (imagine if world leaders, instead of blowing each other up, actually took microphones and hit the stage for a little battleing.  We could have Pay-per-view of George Bush Vs. Saddam, Noriega Vs. George Sr., etc.)  So, in other words, the internal feelings that inspire white, middle-class poets of old and new to express themselves and their surroundings aslo drives these young men and women to express themselves, and each method reflects their external world.  If you went to the same kinds of school I did as a kid, you'll remember the ""yo' momma"" jokes that kids used to tease each other with.  Well, rapping, or at least the ""battle,"" is simply a more creative, more complicated way of having fun, venting frustration, and, at the same time, tapping into the inner poet or lyricist inside.  Watch the movie with that in mind and just FORGET that it happens to be Eminem, and you might see through all the hype that surrounds this young talent.  Anyway, I'm going off too much...but..
  And don't the critics of this movie think the constant dreams the characters have of becoming a ""big-time  rapper"" has a little to do with the modern rap scene and the way in which it's portrayed on ""Music"" television/ the media in general?  To a bunch of kids who've never seen money in their lives, it's pretty tempting to see some guy on TV with champagne and hundred dollar bills and an endless supply of apparently sex-craved women and sports cars.  Rap today NEEDS more reality and less pandering to the hopes and dreams of those that would do more good for society by pursuing careers they're more likely to be successful at.  In other words, if life wasn't so miserable, then half the ""pop"" rap you see on MTV wouldn't do as well as it does.  Hell, with how the lives of most rappers on MTV are portrayed, who WOULDN'T want their jobs?  (that's why schools and communities like those in the setting of 8 Mile need attention from Washington.  So that the same old rich white guys who hate evil rap music will actually give poor kids a better chance of not wanting to grow up to be the ""evil rap guys"" they hate so much)  Anyway, the movie is well-made, well-acted, and actually has a point if you're paying attention, and even if I wasn't a fan of old Marshal, I'd still shut up and admit the movies is, let's say, better than half the ""reality"" driven movies out there on youth today.  I hope reading this was worth it, because now I regret doing such a long review.  I got so into writing this that I just missed my ride......oh well.",1050537600,,4519,4.53770086526576
3448809,4,B00009IB3B,"So here it is, the movie &#8216;debut' of Eminem, the man once referred to by President Bush as 'the most dangerous threat to American children since polio'. Directed by Curtis Hanson (previously responsible for the excellent LA Confidential), Marshall Mathers III stars as Jimmy &#8216;B. Rabbit' Smith, a wannabe rapper struggling to break of a life of poverty on the wrong side of Detroit's 8 Mile Road.
8 Mile opens with B. Rabbit about to go on stage to take part in an open mic rap contest at a rap venue called &#8216;The Shelter'. Plagued by nerves, he throws up in the bathroom and down his sweater before going on stage, where in front of a cynical and somewhat hostile back audience he completely dries up in an embarrassing case of stage fright. Homeless and car-less after splitting up with his &#8216;pregnant' girlfriend he has to return to his mother's trailer home, whereupon he disturbs his mother (Kim Basinger) mid-coital with her younger lover Greg. As if that is not embarrassing enough his mother later confides to a horrified Rabbit that she is having problems with her sex life because Greg won't go down on her.
Almost everything in 8 Mile suggests that this is less than fiction and whilst perhaps not quite autobiographical it is certainly quasi-autobiographical. Much like a pre-superstardom Eminem, his character Jimmy has an absentee father, he hangs around with a multiracial crew and takes part in rapping competitions. Jimmy's mother is a drunken fool neglecting her four-year old daughter, whilst living with a no-good loser virtually the same age as her son, in a squalid trailer. Jimmy's crew dream of becoming rap stars and see their rhyming skills as being their best hope of getting out of the inner city deprivation and urban wasteland of America's famous motor city. However, whilst dreaming of a way out of the urban wasteland and poverty that surrounds him Rabbit still has to work a day job in a steel pressing plant where his boss gives him a hard time for his time-keeping and attitude.
Eminem is not just the most famous rapper in America, he is quite simply the biggest star on the planet. In the superstardom stakes he is, if you will pardon the comparison, the new Michael Jackson (without the chimp, the plastic surgery, the dance moves and with a great deal more profanity). Of course 8 Mile isn't actually Eminem's film debut; that was in The Wash, Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg's ill-conceived remake of the 70's flick &#8216;Car Wash', where he made a cameo appearance as a phone-stalker psycho. As The Wash proved, rap artists don't necessarily make great actors or great films (remember Vanilla Ice in the cringeworthy Cold As Ice anyone?) and with the exception of Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur, very few have actually made the transition from music to movies as well as this.
Perhaps not an obviously heroic figure Eminem's public persona has been somewhat modified in his role as Jimmy &#8216;Rabbit' Smith. Jimmy's actions are anti-homophobic (he comes to the defence of one of his gay colleagues), he is positively passive (rather than verbally violent) to all the women in his life regardless of how much they wrong him. Indeed the movie opens with Rabbit having given his car and home away to his ex-girlfriend who claims to be pregnant and he returns to his mom's trailer where he raps an improvised lullaby to his little sister. For much of the movie, Rabbit is a brooding somewhat introverted character. He travels to his work on the bus, headphones on, hooded and scribbling down new ideas for lyrics. However the movie and Eminem both come alive during the rap battles, which are central to the plot, where rival rappers verbally tear each other limb from limb in front of a hostile crowd. Taunting Rabbit with cries of &#8220;Elvis&#8221; and comments about his mother and their trailer park home, this is Eminem in his equivalent of Rocky's boxing ring or General Maximus Decimus Meridus's coliseum. Rabbit must overcome his own fears and self-doubt in order to emerge triumphant.
Out-with this critics will say that Director Curtis Hanson (The Wonder Boys) has deliberately restricted Eminem to a range of acting, which does not require much flexing of thespian muscle. However, this is something of a moot point because it works. Eminem looks good. It is a credible and understated performance and 8 Mile is an entertaining and uplifting movie, which showcases his great talent. As always, Curtis Hanson's direction is flawless and he has surrounded Slim Shady with an excellent supporting cast. In particular, Mekhi Phifer (ER) as Rabbit's best buddy &#8216;Future', Brittany Murphy (Don't Say A Word) as would be trashy new girlfriend Alex, Evan Jones as the dopey Cheddar Bob and Kim Basinger are all excellent.
Perhaps not the most original story ever told, 8 Mile has been compared to Rocky, Saturday Night Fever and A Star Is Born. However, it is refreshing to see that 8 Mile is free of a traditional Hollywood ending and instead finishes on a more realistic note with an important message; Dreams cannot be realised if all you do is dream. Hard work and perseverance are the keys to success and the only person you can totally rely upon in this life is yourself.",1050451200,,5232,4.87317620650954

This movie does ispire me and I am sure many others to show that no matter how hard it gets you can always get back up.

  - The Making-Of 8Mile: It's not a huge making of, but it shows some things you might be interested in knowing.. Why did they decide to make this movie, and many other things.
  - Rap Battles: In the Shelter (the place where rap battles happen in the movie), there is the crowd who judges the rappers. Between takes, they were getting really bored, so the director made a contest: ""Are you 'good' enough to battle Eminem""? Some people tried, until four were selected to battle him. What happened? Well, watch it! Very funny!
  - ""Superman"" Music Video: This is one of the best extras. This video clip will never be on TV because it is really explicit, but it is one of Eminem's best video clips ever.. Exciting!
  The movie is rated R because of strong language (those words, you know... F-word, S-word, N-word...), Sexuality (it has three sex scenes, but not explicit ones), some violence (a Rabbit friends shoots himself with his own gun in the leg, Rabbit is beaten up, no big thing...) and drug use (Rabbit's friends smoke marijuana).

Yes, the storyline and plot is the typical underdog comes out on top story we've seen too much of in films of the past, but thanks to the smart direction of Curtis Hanson and a surprisingly solid cast, 8 Mile ends up being far better than it should be.  Eminem may not have all the acting talent in the world, but he brings a vulnerability to the screen that will make the viewer root for him whether they are an Eminem fan or not.

Rapping to be cool, fairly understood,
Pseudo-rhymes, music crimes,
Lotsa rapping lotsa times
Man in da house, expect nuttin great,
A story of grit in da face o' cruel fate
Sorry about that, but it'll prepare you for this flick. People who are about to see it are most likely carrying a heavy baggage of expectations. And to such folk, here is a spoiler: 8 Mile is an absorbing movie if you like hood flicks, even an insiring tale at times, but I wonder if it commanded the supposed accolades that critics squandered upon it. Indeed it may be the 'Purple Rain' of our decade and is similar on several levels to the famous 80's movie starring Prince who battles his way from an alcoholic family and his own childhood demons to master the villianous musicians played by Morris Day and the Time.
That said, 8 Mile is shot well and the performances are actually quite good in parts. Eminem bags special mention -- he is in surprisingly confident form given his first attempt on the silver screen. Kim Basinger is so good as the ... mom that it makes you wonder how she channeled that performance without a little trailer park in her blood. Brittany Murphy is an exception (as usual) who fumbles around in her role like Ray Charles strapped in a Tilt-O-Whirl.
Although I hate rap  with a capital C, I am glad to note that the music throughout the movie is fairly enjoyable and the ""rap battles"" are even funny at times. Some of the scenes that have the ""good guy"" Eminem ""winning"" are actually quite engaging.

I didn't see how anyone over the age of 12 would be able to sit through what I assumed would be a two hour music video.  But after I heard nothing but good stuff about this movie when it came out, I decided to give the dvd a shot.
It's not a glorified music video at all.  The story is your basic poor kid with talent struggling to make it tale.  Think ""Rocky"" with a white rapper instead of boxer.  It is well told, and never drags.
Eminem's acting was good, although a lot of that can be attributed to him basically playing himself.  But he doesn't hog the screen and turn this into a vanity piece.  Rather, he steps back and lets the other actors drive the movie.  Mekhi Phifer(I'm sure I just missspelled his name)does a great job as his best friend.  Especially in the scene where he gets Eminem to improvise a rap to ""Sweet Home Alabama"" in order to forget his crappy life or at least laugh at it.

8 MILE is 50% fact/50% fiction.  It basically follows Eminem through life in Detroit, going to various rap battles, and (possibly?) winning.  The DVD extras explain exactly what parts are true to fact, and where it goes astray.  The rap battle parts really ARE unscripted, and some of the rappers really are just taken straight off the street! (Well, they had to sign up on a list, then be accepted; but they weren't told what to say or anything.)

3448822,5,B00009IB3B,"The much anticipated first acting role for rapper Eminem, ""8 Mile"", comes together way better than i thought it would. Seeing the trailer for this movie i thought i would be a complete mess of Eminem's past-life and rappers going at it in competitions. Even with some drama and action, ""8 Mile"" turns out exactly as i planned it would (except with a whole lot more interesting scenes). To the average Eminem fan, you probably can't take in all these different actions in one movie, you would probably just buy it for your Eminem collection and say, ""it's the best movie ever!"" or something. But to someone who doesn't even know who he is (is there such a person?) he or she might say ""wow, this is an alright movie with a nice plot and good storytelling values"" (i would've said what the Eminem fan said). When i went to see the movie in theaters i thought (myself being a huge Eminem fan) that i would just think it was the greatest ever instantly, but no, i didn't.
The storyline of the movie is a little unclear at first. A gang of underground rappers get together weekly at the 'shelter' to do rap battles. The movie opens with Jimmy 'B Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) going out to battle. He loses do to stagefright and goes home (which he now has to live with his mother {Kim Basinger} because his girlfriend dumped him). I'm not going to go through the whole movie like this because that would be giving away WAY too much info, but, i will tell you some highlights. One or two scenes seem very interesting, B Rabbit tends to start rapping over anything that he can find. One scene, Rabbit and a fellow rapper that i think was named 'future' start a rap duet over ""Sweet Home Alabama"" (the song, not the movie). Some more personal scenes include Rabbit and his little sister, Lillie, Rabbit and his new girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) and Rabbit with his friend who i think is named Cheddar. The best rap scenes come about in the 'shelter', at Rabbit's work, and the previously mentioned rap duet with 'future'. Fighting and action scenes really come in handy in this film, Rabbit fights with his mother's boyfriend (i don't think their married), one of his friends for sleeping with his new girlfriend, and he gets his butt kicked by some thugs later on in the movie, too. If you want to know anymore about the movie itself, buy it.
All in all, ""8 Mile"" is an excellent debut for Eminem in the movie industry. Considering this DVD edition has already racked up over $72 million dollars in just the first weeks rental and sales, it seems alot of people agree with me. The DVD includes director's commentary, exclusive rap battles, and the MTV banned video for ""Superman"". Also buy the soundtrack to this movie, it is an unstoppable record.",1048982400,,2733,4.556910569105691
3448823,4,B00009IB3B,"Rapper Eminem makes a spectacular screen debut in ""8 Mile,"" a film designed to showcase the performer's talents as singer, songwriter and, now, actor.
In this semi-autobiographical tale, Eminem plays a young white rapper named Jimmy who is struggling to achieve respectability and recognition in an area dominated almost exclusively by black artists.  We've seen this story before in films ranging from ""The Hustler"" to ""The Cincinnati Kid"" to ""Rocky"":  the hotshot, talented newcomer attempts to make a name for himself in some specialized area (be it pool, poker, boxing or rapping) by challenging and defeating the highly respected and established reigning champ.  In terms of plotting, ""8 Mile"" offers little that is new or exciting, but what makes the movie work is the fine sense of detail and texture that writer Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson bring to the world they are showing us.  Set in 1995 Detroit, the film superbly captures the unmitigated bleakness of its urban setting:  from the burnt-out, abandoned buildings to the graffiti-covered walls to the dank, cavernous music clubs to the rundown trailer parks.  Jimmy is caught in a world that offers the poor working class stiff little opportunity for hopes and dreams beyond those he can make for himself - and Jimmy has found rap music to be the best chance for his ticket out.  Yet, Jimmy is no pie-in-the-sky idealist.  He knows that he can't afford to put all his eggs into one basket and so he remains levelheaded and pragmatic in his aspirations and goals.  Beyond the obvious handicap of his skin color, Jimmy is also having to cope with a crumbling relationship, an alcoholic mother, her abusive boyfriend and some ""concerned"" parties who, despite what they may say, may not always have Jimmy's best interest at heart.
Each of these characters has the potential to become nothing more than a hokey stereotype, but the acting and the writing keep most of it real most of the time.  Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, Britanny Murphy and several others all turn in fine performances in their roles, but it is Eminem himself who makes the film work.  Jimmy, despite all the frustration and rage smoldering under the surface, comes across as a decent guy who wants to make something of himself and to help those people who mean the most to him in the process.  Eminem is a natural on the screen, and it will be interesting to see if he will be able to so successfully inhabit a character who is not so carefully tailored to fit his ready-made persona.  My suspicion is that he will, though only time - and his next few roles - will tell.
""8 Mile"" affords a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that many of us have hitherto viewed only from the outside.  Especially intriguing are the ""hip-hop battles,"" wherein rappers come on stage and challenge one another to perform spontaneous mutual put-downs, with the audience getting to determine the contest's winner.  No matter what one may feel about rap music itself, one has to admire the talent involved in composing these rhyming verses extemporaneously.  The music may sometimes be execrable, but the love of language that pours forth out of the mouths of these young practitioners is actually quite encouraging and captivating (though one wishes that that talent would be channeled in a more positive direction at times).
An interesting side note:  at one point, Jimmy recites a rap defending a homosexual co-worker.  After all the bad blood that has gone down between Eminem and the gay community in the past, I wonder if this is the rapper's attempt to make peace and bury the hatchet.  If so, it is a gesture well worth making.",1048896000,,3654,4.864516129032258

3448828,3,B00009IB3B,"I don't know quite what to make of ""8 Mile"". I am admittedly not much of a fan of rap music or of the movie's star, Eminem. This is not to say I haven't enjoyed some rap songs, some of which were written and performed by Marshall Mathers, AKA Eminem.
The movie was directed by one of my favorite directors, Curtis Hanson. To me, it does not stand up to his best works, ""LA Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys"". Is this because those are stronger films or because the subject matter in ""8 Mile"" is less appealing to me? I'm not sure, but I do know this: ""8 Mile"" is relentlessly dark [literally and figuratively] and grim, whereas Hanson's previous efforts, though serious, were peppered with a great deal of satire and humor. What is ironic to me is that the director fails to see the satiric, humorous nature of much of rap music itself.
Jimmy [Eminem] grew up on the `wrong side' of Detroit's 8 Mile Road, which is a kind of boundary between the city's mostly black inner city and its predominately white suburbs. Jimmy is an angry young man who channels his frustrations into his rap music. The problem is that he's a `trailer trash white boy' [his own description of himself] trying to make it in a rap world dominated by black artists. Adding to his woes is the fact that, after packing all his things into a garbage bag and leaving his pregnant girlfriend, he is forced to live with his drunken mother [Kim Basinger] and her...boyfriend. The few bright spots in his life are his kid sister, his small group of loyal friends and his musical talent. Can Jimmy escape his fate through his music, or will he end up being just another [also-ran] in the long history of pop music?
Eminem is excellent as Jimmy, but whether this is because he is a fine actor or because he is playing a version of himself remains to be seen. There are certainly many parallels between his life and character he plays.
As a movie about pop music culture, this one is superior to most others. If only its outlook weren't so unrelentingly bleak!",1048550400,,2019,4.489130434782608

This movie takes you back to one of the golden eras of hip-hop. 1994-1995 was the year that hip-hop got re-invented to what we hear today. This movie portrayed all of the positive things in hip-hop. I mean the rap battle goes back to the old school Doug E Fresh and Slick Rick days. Very solid movie. Em did his thing. I mean his freestyle at the end was tight. I don't own the movie but for those of you trying to build a better collection you need to add this one to the list. Without a doubt a 5 STAR MOVIE......""Cause son they shook, cause ain't no such thing as half-way crooks. Scared to death and scared to look""....Classic Film..",1048550400,,718,4.325925925925926
3448830,3,B00009IB3B,"What I feared the most about this flick and what was in fact the main reason (along with not wanting to be trapped in a theater full of teen hoodlums) I didn't see the film in theatre despite my respect for the director is related to the soundtrack.  Being someone who hasn't listened to hip-hop consistently for four years, I didn't want to hear a bunch of songs by eminem and xzibit and 50 cent (whoever the hell that is) as the backdrop for a film.  But, to my surprise, right at the outset, we're greeted with mobb deep's shook ones and we pretty much never look back (or forward as it were) except for Lose Yourself at the credits and  a little chopped into one scene.  What you will hear is more mobb deep, biggie, tupac, naughty by nature and an abundance of wu tang as the score for the lives of the hip hop obsessed characters.  Though, this is what I would have expected had I known that the story took place in '95 as director Hansen is a master of time and place.  The free styling heard throughout is also a delight.  Without the handicap that the real eminem suffers from (namely derivative west coast production) BRabbit spills some of the more memorable battle rhymes you're likely to hear.
If you don't have some love for rap (past or present) you really should just stay away from this film because there's probably no way that it can please you.  Because outside of the music itself, everything in the film (good and bad) reflects the good and ill of hip hop.  There's a great sense of place (much like you'll find in rap) but it's very exclusionary to any virtue that is not urban.  Also, all of the hatred that the hip hop culture has for women is poured into the two female characters.  All of the scenes of male camaraderie, be it rousting about an open car hood or charging into battle with another click, rings true and reflects a certain joy and zeal.  But whenever there's a female onscreen (unless its in the person of a decidedly androgynous rappess), there lingers a foul stench of hatred and the story loses all verisimilitude.  The women - the mother and girlfriend (for lack of a better term - I'm referring to the sexy-vapid plot device in a short (frequently lifted) skirt played by brittany murphy) are self serving and manipulative and all too obsessed with either (as the mother) having a man or (in the case of the girl) using one for self gain.  It's really a shame that after all these years hip hop is still bubbling to an overflow with misogyny.  Even if they wanted to make the female characters loathsome, nothing excuse the loss-point driving action of Murphy's character felandering with one of b rabbits friends in a location where they knew he was due to show up at any second.  Just insulting to the inteligence.",1048550400,,2762,4.483033932135728

However, the acting is good (Eminem is surprisingly good), the plot is simple but somewhat novel, the editing is very good, the soundtrack is very good and the extras are very good (you have to check out the amateur rap fights).
Yes, I like Eminem and think he is one of the most creative artists of the 90s. I also like classical music and classic rock. Although he does use a lot of expletives, this is a case where the expletives are not a mask for inferior work -- his stuff is good. The movie does not have him swearing nearly as much as his music does. However, there are several sexual situations that should stay out of the reach of youngsters.
The ending leaves us with hope and comes as a real positive outcome -- not sure how a ""dark"" message could be taken from that. It seems much more mature than many ""serious"" films being done these days.",1048550400,,940,4.256983240223463

3448833,2,B00009IB3B,"""8 Mile"" had to be one of the most heavily promoted Hollywood flicks since I don't know when. Every two, no make that, one minute, you saw the ads of worldwide pop icon Eminem with his hood up while ""Lose Yourself"" is played in the background. Add to that, a huge overplayed hit(the aforemetioned title above) and Eminem's megastardom, the hype machine went into overload.
But with most Eminem work, a natural curiosity brewed up. So you'd think that things would be actually intresting.
NOT!
I actually was personally suprised how boring ""8 Mile"" is. With all the hype and all the mouth of Em, I thought things would be lively. But I was wrong. In fact,""8 Mile"" seems like every standard urban drama just with more gloss. Eminem does a good enough take as ""Rabbit"", the film's down-on-his-luck hero which is based of course on the star's real life. And you already know the whole plot but I mean, aside from some of the freestyle battles which capture some real enegery and some of the great 1995-era rap played(vintage Biggie; Mobb Deep; etc.), there's nothing in ""8 Mile"" to stand out. It's just so unremarkable.
""8 Mile"" is pretty much formulaic urban cinema that appeals to young women(the target auidence) and surburban rap fans that doesn't challenge or truly intrest. You'd think that they'd at least to try to disguise the fact that the film is basically a result of Eminem's high marketbility but it just falls flat.
I really came to it with a natural curiousity since I love music-based films and I was just left wanting more. Very overrated. One of the more duller movies I've seen in a while.",1048550400,,1605,4.6749116607773855
3448834,4,B00009IB3B,"There's so many things that could've gone wrong with this film.  It could've turned out to be another ""Glitter"" disaster.  However, that did not happen at all.  What DID happen was that ""8 Mile"" turned out to be a great success, and even critically acclaimed!  This is a great film about goals, hardships, and most importantly, getting through life without giving up.
The movie, inspired by things that had happened to Eminem in his life, is about Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith, Jr.  He has dreams of being an ill rapper, but in the beginning it only seems like that; a dream.  At the very first ""battle,"" Jimmy is unable to respond back lyrically to his opponent and walks off stage in shame.  Other things that are troubling Jimmy is the fact that he broke up with his girlfriend and is now forced to move back into his mom's trailer with his alcoholic mother and his very young sister.  Despite everything that is holding him back, Jimmy still has goals of becoming a somebody, and most importantly he has a goal of getting out of 8 Mile for good.
This really is a triumphant movie that is inspirational on so many levels.  The film was very well done on every front.  Eminem does a great job of bringing to the table his ability to act and relive some of those moments he had to deal with in his life.  Kim Basinger is terrific in her role, as always.  Mekhi Phiefer is outstanding as Jimmy's Friend, ""Future,"" and Brittany Murphy is a sight to see as well.  The movie was extremely well written and directed.
The DVD has some cool features to offer.  The picture and sound quality is really great (you can even watch it in DTS).  Some of the extras included are exclusive rap battles not shot during the film, the uncensored Eminem video ""Superman,"" the music of ""8 Mile,"" and a making of featurette.  All very cool features indeed.
I would recommend ""8 Mile"" to just about anybody I knew.  It doesn't matter if you're into rap or not (it helps, but I think one can enjoy this film without being a big rap fan).  This is a truly inspirational movie that is emotionally charged from start to finish.  ""8 Mile"" is an experience you will never forget.

For those who automatically pigeonhole rappers into unflattering catagories, this movie will force you to look a little more closely.  The beauty of this movie is that is does not try to be beautiful.  It doesn't reach, it doesn't glorify.  It shows young men and women who just want to ""get out,""  something that the young adults of America readily relate to.  It also makes a number of points that force rap's critics to take another look at the way that language is used in rap, and hopefully readjust their views.",1048291200,,610,4.654205607476635
3448838,3,B00009IB3B,"8 MILE is a good, not great, movie.  It showcases the life of a guy just trying to succeed at something that he loves.  Who of us cannot relate to that?

The film has a lot of detractors.  Some of their reasoning is valid.  The scene where Jimmy Smith defends a gay man is too contrived.  Besides Eminem's well-chronicled views on homosexuality, it's also a bit unrealistic within the context of the movie.  The plot takes place in 1995.  I cannot think of a single emcee at that time who would have stood up to defend a homosexual man (I really can't think of one who would do that now).  Other gripes are unneccessary.  Many complain that Eminem is just playing himself.  First, Eminem is not an actor, so what's the big deal?  Secondly, is it really all that easy to play yourself in front of the camera?

....

Perhaps my favorite part of the DVD, though, is when we're being shown the four rappers who were chosen to film extra battle scenes with Eminem.  This scene shows us something about Eminem that has to be admired.  This was a fake battle scene being filmed for a movie and it might or might not make the final cut.  It wasn't like there would be any damage to his career, right?  In addition, Eminem was tired, was losing his voice and director Curtis Hanson asked him to rest his voice and just let the other emcees do their thing.  After the second rapper went though, Eminem simply could not allow things to stand pat.  For the last three contestants, he allowed them to do their thing, and then responded by showing why he really is one of the best battle emcees on the planet.  He shows his talent and his competetiveness.  Those are the reasons that Eminem is still at the forefront of the nation's thoughts.",1048291200,,1728,4.419047619047619
3448839,4,B00009IB3B,"The movie starts off beautifully.  Rabit (Eminem) is in a restroom getting ready to enter a freestyle battle.  He has on headphones blasting ""Mobb Deep's"" ""Shook One's Pt II"" I'm not a big Mobb fan, but that song is nice, the beat pure fire to freestyle over.  The song makes a nice intro, to an overall decent movie. Better then decent, if you consider this is Em's first attempt at real acting.  The cast fits well here.  My favorite support character is ""Cheddar Bob"" he seems to be a bit slow mentally.  He add's some really funny moments with a few of his lines.  It's especially funny when the rest of his crew is bad mouthing ""Free World"" under their breaths, and Cheddar blurts it out, starting a near riot between the rival clicks. He is the out of place man in their crew ""313""  The rest of the crew besides ""Cheddar"" are supposed to be emcees too, but you never really get to see it, except for a moment in a parking lot scene.  I'm a long time Em fan, but even those who aren't, pretty much know the basics of the movie.  The story is well told, and well acted.  I would have liked for it to have had more ""battle"" scenes.  But they had to make the movie where it could appeal to everyone I suppose.  I also find it hard to believe Kim Basinger as a trailer park trash mom. But she a remarkable job here.  The friction between Rabbit and his mom and her boyfriend. Who just happens to be one of Rabbits old school mate, is very belivable.  Rabbit doesn't like him, and especially doesn't like the fact his mother is with a man who is his age.  The movie does however, drag at points.  There are some shots of drug usage, and sex (but no visable nudity) and of course a bunch of explicits.  But it's not would I would consider a bad movie.  The drug use, and the sex aren't displayed in a way where they're being promoted. They are just a part of the story.
Could this movie have been better? Of course, but show me one that couldn't.  Em does a wonderful job playing Jimmy ""Rabbit"" even if this is loosely based on his life.  He still did a fine job ""acting""  And true to the real man, the majority of emotion he displays is anger and hatred.  The scenes with him and his little sister ""Lilly"" though, are very touching.  Again, they mimic his relationship with his daughter ""Halley"" showing, that while he has issues, he really isn't that bad of a guy.  I especially found the one's where he was fighting with his mom boyfriend. And afterwards saw his sis in the corner frighted to have a very real feel to them.  He didn't want her exposed to anything bad, and did whatever he could to keep her away from harm and having to witniss the negative side of life.  With how it ended, I could see a sequal. I'm sure the studio is all for the idea. But somehow, I doubt that Em is going to be up for it. He didn't do this movie for the money, and he didn't do it because he wanted to be an actor. He did it because it was a role he related to, and in an indirect way it told his life story of growing up on ""8 mile"" road in Detriot.  Even if you don't like hip-hop music, I suggest you give this movie a try. It has very little actual rapping in it.",1048291200,,3156,4.163366336633663
3448840,4,B00009IB3B,"I have to say that I am not a fan of Eminem. Nothing personal, I just don't care for his music, excpet Lose Yourself, but I decided to check this out based on all the hype surrounding it and all the positive reviews it was given. It is a very good movie, and Eminim gives a dramatic, intense performance that I would never have expected. Everyone knows the premise of the film, a white rapper trying to make it. The films moves along quickly, has some intense rap battle sequences, and invloves Em's relationship with his mother played by Kim Basinger, and Brittany Murphy, the girl who convinces him to go for it all. Eminems performance is the standout of the film, but Brittany Murphy does an excellent job as Alex. She's sweet, sexy, and dangerous and it's always a pleasure to see Brittney in any film. Kim Basinger is way over the top. I didn't buy her performance one bit, and felt she was completely miscast. I highly recommend this film to all Eminem fans and even not his fans, since I am not one. I have a new respect for the guy. He is immensely talented, and now we have a reason why he is so successful. It is clear to me that it is Talent over Image.",1048291200,,1165,4.3

The whole movie all-together is really good. Plus the bonus features such as the ""Superman"" video is pretty good. Then the bonus free-style raps are definitely a very good bonus. And the other few bonus's are not too bad either. The bonus's definitely raise this DVD to a 5 star, without the really good bonus's it would just be a 4 star movie!",1048204800,,623,4.473684210526316

3448846,2,B00009IB3B,"Well here it is! The movie we all heard about. Rapper Eminem's venture into movies. When I first heard about this movie I was expecting to absolutely hate it. I thought it would turn out to be the worst movie of the year. And I thought all of this not because I'm not a fan of Eminem's, but, because I thought this was going to turn out to be a pretentious piece of junk that would have us sympathize with him and make us feel sorry for the life he's lead. And I wasn't ready to say I feel sorry for Eminem. Well, just to show everyone that I ALWAYS try to judge a movie fairly. I will admit, I liked this movie more than I thought I would. And I am forced to eat a little crow. Not the whole bird mind you, but, maybe a wing.
 ""8 Mile"" as Jimmy Smith (Eminem) tells his friends is about a bunch of losers who do nothing but talk about getting of the ""8 mile"". All they do is talk about rapping. As if that's their ticket to a better life. As I heard Eminem say this I was shocked because, this was exactly what I was thinking. And that's the downfall of the movie. It's too slight. ""8 Mile"" doesn't go that extra mile (yes, pun intended!) to seperate itself from being an average movie to something better. Why do the characters in this movie think rapping is their way out of the ghetto? How about a better job? Sticking to school? All the characters do is talk about rapping. I swear that was all the dialogue. The characters rarely speak about anything else.
 Jimmy Smith (Eminem) is trying to get by. I guess he's just finished high school perhaps college. He just got fired from his job at white castle. Broke up with his girlfriend. And goes down to a local club run by his friend ""Future"" (Mekhi Phifer). Where he competes in ""battles"". A battle for those unfamilar with the term is basically a one on one fight with rhymes. Each person insults the other while rapping. And Jimmy thinks that if he can get a demo made he'll be on his way out of the 8 mile.
 Now maybe this all sounds enjoyable to you. But, the movie never does more than create a nice atmosphere. I was expecting more depth. I wanted the movie to dwell deeper into it's characters. I didn't just want to hear about what they think about rap. And there is one character who does try to change the subject now and then and everyone tells him to keep quiet. I think ""8 Mile"" wanted to achieve what I'm talking about. It didn't want to be a ""light"" movie or a ""popcorn flick"". It wanted to be something more important. And I say that because they went out to get Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys & L.A. Confidential) to direct it. If they weren't concerned with making an important movie they could of gotten any hack director to do the picture. The Eminem audience didn't go see this movie to see how Hanson's directing would be. They went to see Eminem! But because they set out to do more with the story they wanted a talented director. And who knows maybe Hanson did make many changes in the script. Perhaps he made major improvements. But, the story still comes off too slight. Nevertheless, they are things to be enjoyed while watching this movie. Namely the performance by Kim Basinger. She plays Jimmy's mother Stephanie. A woman who is dating a guy that went to school with her son. She lives in a trailer. And doesn't seem to have much to look forward to in the future. Also there's Brittany Murphy, who plays a girl Eminem likes. She does a nice job acting. But, I felt at the end of the movie, they forget about her and never resolve her part of the story. It would of been interesting if more information about her was given. And like I said, the movie does a good job at creating an urban atmosphere. It's because I have good things to say about the movie I wish the movie would of meet the expectations that could of been.
 Another question on people's mind is can Eminem act. The answer to that one is no. Now this is not to say he wasn't good in this movie. Most people are good at being themself. But, here is the real test. Can you see Eminem playing a complete 360 from the persona he's created for himself? I mean can you see him playing the kind of roles Freddie Prinze Jr. plays? No. And if he's not capable of playing different roles that means he can't act. And I doubt he wants to start a career in the movies anyway.
 So is ""8 Mile"" enjoyable? So-so. Fans of Eminem will probably enjoy the movie more then the rest of us. If for anything reason their expectations may not be as high as our's. Their fans of his, they'll go easy on him. But non-fans will want more. And ""8 Mile"" almost gives us it. ** 1\2 out of *****
 Bottom-line: A movie that is just too slight. The idea isn't interesting enough, and needed to add another level to it to make it enjoyable. A nice try though. Some good performances save the movie from being a waste of time.",1048118400,,4836,4.251086956521739
3448847,4,B00009IB3B,"Rapper Eminem portrays Detroit factory worker and street rapper ""B. Rabbit"" in this poor-boy-makes-good story based loosely on Eminem's own life. Rabbit desperately wants to make a demo tape of his music and rap his way out of the trailer park and into a better life. He must cope with his venomous alcoholic mother, manipulative friends, neighborhood thugs, and overcome his own intense stage fright in order to get respect for his work and a shot at exposure. Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's most loyal and sensible friend who pushes him to do better and has unfailing confidence in Rabbit's ability to succeed. Brittany Murphy is Rabbit's unfaithful but supportive love interest Alex. And Kim Basinger plays Rabbit's dysfunctional mother, with whom he shares a love-hate relationship.

The verdict is still out on whether Eminem can act. Eminem is certainly convincing in his role, but I am under the impression that B. Rabbit is too close to the rapper's own experience to be an accurate judge of acting talent. Eminem's rapping talent and charisma are not in question. Even the uninitiated will be convinced that he has plenty of both, and tremendous screen presence as well. Fans of Curtis Hanson may be surprised that the director has made such a conventional  film. That's a little surprising coming from Eminem too. But the fact is that 8 Mile is a smart public relations move on Eminem's part. This is mainstream fair, complete with a mainstream crossover soundtrack. It's good mainstream fair, as is the soundtrack. And B. Rabbit is sweet enough and politically correct enough in his attitudes towards women, homosexuals and his loser friends to assuage middle-class audiences into thinking Eminem is a decent guy. I'm not saying that he isn't. I'm only saying that 8 Mile is less a convincing portrait of inner city poverty and salvation in music as it is a trailer park fairy tale, constructed in a very cliched fashion, to promote -some would say whitewash- Eminem's image for a wider audience. -Which is fine. It's an entertaining film, and Eminem has great presence. But we haven't seen the frank, brilliant, hateful Eminem who is so loved and so loathed on the silver screen yet.

After seeing the the trailers I must admit I rolled my eye's, like i'm sure a lot of people did, and dissmised it. After learning that Brian Grazer (A Beautiful Mind)was producing the film and Curtis Hansen (LA Confidential) was directing I knew that the movie would be watchable. Finally I swollowed my prode and went to see the film.
  The movie is about a young aspiring rapper from Detriot named Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) struggling to cope with life and his unclear future. The movie opens with Jimmy becoming frozen onstage during a battle. By opening the movie that was I think that you care about Jimmy right from the get go. He moves back with his mother (Kim Basinger) in a trailer park. Jimmy struggles with his mother and other rappers.
Solid preformances by Britt Murphy as Jimmys girl and Mekhi Phifer as Jimmys friend. Still the movie belongs to Eminem.
  The movie and the charactors are well devloped and the plot is simple but plauseable (The Quiet Man wasn't a big story either). The acting is very good and surprising considering that Eminem has never acted in a movie before.
  The movie also deals with racisim on both sides of black and white and for that alone this movie is worth commending.
  The music suits the movie well and even though i'm not a fan of the music on a whole I found myself humming the title song later in the day.",1048032000,,1544,4.374125874125874

Other than that, I was very very impressed.  While I think Eminem is obviously a troubled individual, this film succeeds in explaining why he is the way he is.  I can't wait until he grows a little more and decides to get on with his life, but hey, he's ranting all the way to the bank, so more power to him.  This IS a free country, and I salute Eminem for saying everything he wants.

3448852,3,B00009IB3B,"A disapppointing film about the underground culture of rap battles, modern versions of doin' the dozens that many aspiring MCs dream will make them stars.  Speaking charitably, I don't think it was the fault of ultra-charismatic rapper Eminem that he was cast in the role of Ron Howard in this inner-city update of ""American Graffiti,"" but it's still a shame that the weak script and sluggish direction didn't provide better opportunities for him to explore his acting range. While the messed-up, derelict trashiness of the blight-striken 'hoods of Detroit is shown with crisp, gritty detail, the social nuances of the hip-hop scene are reduced to a near-cartoonish simplicity, in which Eminem (as ""B. Rabbit,"" his character's street name) and his too-goofy crew run up against the obnoxious swaggering of the Free World, a musical group that has already made it, and lords it over the rest of the scene.  Too much time is spent building up numerous plot points that show how desperate and depressing Rabbit's life is -- the movie simply bogs down, and if we could have seen about half as much of this stuff, and about three times as much actual rapping, things would have been much, much better.  While ""8 Mile"" probably succeeds in making underground hip-hop culture accessible to mainstream America, it probably would have been a better movie had it been played a little tougher.  Several aspects of this film rang false, particularly the overly-likeable Fat Albert gang that Rabbit hangs out with, and the gratuitously [promiscous] scenes with his new girlfriend, played by Brittany Murphy, as well as the unfortunate absence of a wall-to-wall, booming soundtrack.  The film does access a hidden culture, but it does so at the expense of subtlety and directorial finesse.  It's surprising that Chris Hanson, who made a taut thriller like ""LA Confidential,"" could let such a juicy story like this lapse into tedium.  Plus, what a drag that Mekhi Phifer (the aptly-named Dr. Pratt, of TV's ""E.R."") was cast as Em's best bud... Phifer is one of the most leaden and overly-obvious actors around; couldn't they have found *anyone* who would be more fun to watch for two hours?  Anyway, I guess that while this wasn't the dramatic breakthrough for Eminem that many reviewers said it was, that it's still an okay film.  If nothing else, in his climactic rap-battle scene, he got the opportunity to present his blueprint for how white kids who are into rap can diffuse the race-baiting of their critics: look 'em in the eye and say, ""Yeah, so?  What's your point?"" It would have been nice if the other 110 minutes of this film offered as much of a message, but I guess you can't ask for everything.",1048032000,,2694,4.8881578947368425

8 Mile is a movie about a down-and-out underdog who rises to success in the rap world through free-style competitions. Feeling that his life is going nowhere, he pulls through and gains the respect he craves.

3448854,1,B00009IB3B,"""8 Mile"" is more or less everything the trailer promised it would be, but that's not a good thing.  In this contrived rags-to-riches story, hip hop's great white hope Eminem is Rabbit, who struggles to hold down a job while living in a trailer park with his mom (Kim Basinger) and kid sister.  But Rabbit's skills as a rapper get the attention of his peers, who try to give him enough encouragement to compete in a heated hip hop face-off which may lead to a promising record deal.  Lacking both confidence and self-esteem, Rabbit avoids the challenge until he meets his love interest, played by Brittany Murphy.  From there begins an against-all-odds story that's been done before, but better (""Purple Rain"" and ""Rocky"").  Director Curtis Hanson (""Wonder Boys,"" ""L.A. Confidential"") takes a bizarre step backwards in this movie and fails to extract any genuine emotion from the cast or its settings.  The result is a film that's as processed as a Swanson TV dinner.  Scenes that are supposed to have emotional weight drew unintended laughs from this viewer, who was left baffled as to how this became a hit other than Eminem's bankability as a star.  Women don't get a fair shake in this movie, either, for they are portrayed as irresponsible, self-centered, and promiscuous.  And the scene where Rabbit defends a gay man seems like an all too calculated move to counter arguments that Eminem is homophobic.  Speaking of Emimen, it's hard to determine how good an actor he really is based on ""8 Mile.""  To his benefit, he appears natural and relaxed in front of the camera, but the story mirrors his own so closely that one could argue that he's merely playing himself.  The concept of acting is that you're stepping OUTSIDE of character when delivering a performance.  In this movie, Eminem stays well WITHIN character, so, thusly, there's no performance.  The hip hop themes, its Detroit location, and its script provide an all too secure safety net for the rapper.  Not that it will matter to 15-year-olds nationwide.  Surely, the time will come when Hollywood makes a gritty and powerful hip hop drama, but until then, we're gonna have to settle for movies like ""8 Mile.""",1047945600,,2176,4.84054054054054

I am amazed that his name is still topic of conversation (or vigorous debate) at almost every party or social gathering that I attend.  In spite of the buzz that comes along with his presense outside of the film, Eminem manages to give a gritty, gut-level performance that transcends the hype of his musical persona(s). Yes, there are significant parallels to his life and it had to help him to draw on the appropriate emotions, but he delivers what's needed in every scene.  Despite strong supporting performances, the success of this film rests on his shoulders and in my opinion, he comes through.  The look of the film is bleak and effectively conveys the poverty (both emotional and financial) and of his character's life.

I walked into this movie expecting it to have no story, and i expected a lot of music. Surprisingly there is more to the story then just the music. Eminem's nickname in the movie is Rabbit. At first you wonder why he was given this name, but it all ties in. He shares the screen with a few other big names like Kim Basinger, and Brittany Murphy. The movie is about his struggle to become a rap singer and how he is unable to perform infront of other people. While doing this he is also taking care of his mother, Kim Basinger, his little sister, and trying to keep a job. His mother is drunk all the time, her boyfriend beats her, and Rabbit can never get his car to start. In his spare time he tries to get in down at the club so that he can participate in some rap wars. That was the best part of the movie. It's amazing to see people free style rap like they do in the movie. This movie shows there is more behind the singer then just the music. I was actually surprised to see Eminem act as well as he did. Unfortunately we haven't seen this much come from actor/musicians like Jennifer Lopez. The only delema i had was if it was worth the sex scenes and profanity you were exposed to. Well, that would be for you to decide.

I felt it almost turned into a parody in the moments where it was ""glossed-up"" (such as the scene in which Em is defending a gay co-worker).
I just felt like I just kept waiting for the Slim-Shady persona to make an appearence and put an end to all the political correctness I kept seeing.",1046908800,,734,4.304347826086956

I thought this movie was very inspirational and the music made a perfect soundtrack. I would recommend this movie to everyone. For it's use of rap expressing what things are really like in Detriot.

With me?.Ultimate street brawls is better at streetbrawls.com That said, the movie is hardly new or original. We've seen this movie a hundred million times before. There's nothing wrong with that, but some people go overboard and say what a great meaning it had. How fresh it was. There's nothing fresh about it. Eminem's acting isn't totally bad, but it's nothing to make anyone take notice either. The name of the character might be different, but it is obviously him. How hard is it to play yourself?. What acting talent do you need to be you?. He doesn't overly embarrass himself, but he doesn't do much of anything else either. It was a pretty basic role that anyone could do. Oscar nomination?. What a laugh!. The only trophy he'll be seeing for his 'acting' is an MTV Movie Award. The rest of the cast aren't too bad",1046649600,,1087,4.3861386138613865

Despite knowing that the movie is loosely based on Eminem's life doesn't take away from the credibility of Eminem as an actor. He pulls off the leap from rapper to actor with such ease that from the opening scene to the very end  you don't see Eminem as himself, the greatest rapper to enter the thralls of popular music since Tupac, but as b-rabbit a struggling rapper trying to make a name for himself. Unlike, Em's critic's I feel that this movie is a must see for anyone not just his fans, but for all fan's of great dvd's.

Yes, this film does contain alot of profanity and explicit sex scenes, but truthfully, if Emeniem wasn't in this film, no one would care.  Many are looking for a reason to put down his movie. 8mile is well acted, rapped, and written.  8mile is a far better movie than most I have seen this year.  Weather or not you agree with the way Emeniem raps, you should see this movie.  It cannot be denied that he is one of the most talented artists of our time, and all though his lyrics can be controversial at times,  many of his songs are great.  I am a woman, and if you listen closly to his ""bad songs"" he will say at the end that he is kidding.  America is a country of free speech,  so why start sensoring now?

And when you see the trailer, well.. it looks a titch autobiographical, and probably not your speed, right?
Get over that skepticism, and some night when you have little else to do, rent this. Watch it with a somewhat open mind. Ignore all the hype, expect it to be a nice and honest little growing-up film, and you'll probably enjoy it. It's very well made, and the ending is satisfying. Yes, there are cliches. Of course there are; did you really expect it to be otherwise? This *is* still hollywood. No, it's nothing like the trailers make it out to be, but that's ok; I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was anything like as cool as the trailers want you to think it is. That's the purpose of trailers, after all; to make you want to see it, awful or not.
If you've seen the video but not the film, the film will be a bit different from what you expect; the video is *not* (repeat: NOT) a mini version of the film. Some clips are used, but they're used out of context. This is not Eminem's autobiography. It's a sort of fable about a boy out of place in his world.

3448887,4,B00009IB3B,"These kind of movies have a formula, and ""8 Mile"" follows it religiously. Hose off the Detroit grit and the cliches are all there: the struggling talent; the quicksand of home life; the 'friend' with connections offering a fast track to success; the relationship subplot; and, of course, the climactic musical number that secures both moral and professional glory. So don't be surprised if you feel like you've seen this one before. But you will be surprised to find that Eminem can act. I mean really.  There isn't a single moment when you see through him, which is more than can be said for plenty of A-list Hollywood stars.  I was stunned.  Less impressive are the tortuously correct scenes where the one-time bad boy rewrites his own history by drawing a distinction between being gay and being 'a faggot'.  Yet despite such lapses, Scott Silver's screenplay forges a careful path between the irritating extremes of rap/hip-hop culture - its pseudo-intellectual ramblings on race politics, and the black fetishising of white wealth - to tell a story which is actually pro-family, pro-work and pro-individual effort. It's almost Protestant. But it still doesn't resolve rap culture's inherent contradictions. To wit: if living in 'the 313' - perfectly captured by director Hanson in all its horrific squalor - is so great, so 'real', then why is everyone, including our hero, so desperate to get out? And the villain's main crimes are to have a banal real name (Clarence), and to have gone to a private school. But where do you think little Lily will be headed the moment big bro' B Rabbit (with the no less banal real name of 'Jimmy Smith') makes his first million?  Don't try to resolve it, because you won't.  Just listen to the lyrics.  Eminem's closing track, ""Lose Yourself"", makes the argument in 5 minutes better than Silver's screenplay does in 110: it's all about seizing opportunities, about having enough faith to take a chance on yourself.  As a story about that kind of moment, ""8 Mile"" works better than most in the genre.",1043712000,,2040,4.875722543352601

The movie is - of course - about his realization of these things, and what he does to change them. I enjoyed 8 Mile. It's no revolutionary step forward in urban drama, but it's a darn fine movie.

While i know that Eminem is an incredibly talented rapper, and enjoy the radio versions of his singles, I'm not a big fan of the conent of his albums. So why did i want to see this movie? It is directed by Curtis Hanson. Having Hanson at the helm raises the quality level of the film and eases much of my skepticism about how good this movie really could be. After L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys , i knew i had nothing to fear.
I was not disappointed. 8 Mile is not merely good, it is excellent. Eminem may never make another movie, but in 8 Mile he is the real deal. His acting is fantastic and he lends credibility to B Rabbit when he must rap (and rap well). This is his first movie, and he is being asked to carry the picture. He does.

It is good that he gets it out in his music. Alot of people can relate to him in their own way, maybe not exactly what he's been/going through but around the same circle :)
I just wanted to let Eminem know that his listeners rage in large numbers from teenagers through the middle age's and beyond.

3448899,3,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile is the sleazy, urban remake of The Karate Kid. Eminem plays the Daniel character, the ""new"" kid who has been poking around where the more popular kids hang. He's got talent, but can he show this talent to the other kids (rappers)? There's the girlfriend who has affiliations with both Daniel, I mean Eminem, and the bad kids. I use the word ""affiliations"" VERY loosely here (pun unintended). There's the struggling mom who loves her kid but cannot provide the crucial life lessons Daniel/Eminem needs, so we have Miyagi (Phifer), the wise teacher/counselor/companion. But there's no Karate in 8 Mile. Just rap. So ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,"" right? Not so. There are some hurtful things being said here. Hurtful rap. And to add insult to injury--or rather injury to insult--there are young guys with guns out waiting in the street outside the ""Hall of Rap"" who seem quite willing to pop caps into people. Johnny and his Cobra gang from the Karate film seem like real pansies next to these hooligans. At least Eminem didn't get spaghetti sauce all over a perfectly good outfit at the club, though! Talk about hurt. So in the sequel to 8 Mile, Eminem will get the you-know-what kicked out of him by Johnny and his Cobra cronies (many now with illegitimate kids, beer bellies, and memories of ""the old days"").

3448900,4,B00009IB3B,"To sum this movie up in a sentence; ""better than I thought it would be!"" History is littered with musicians who've tried to break in to Hollywood and failed miserably. Examples: Lance Bass, Mick Jagger(was I the only one who saw 'Freejack'?), Madonna (I actually wasted Xmas day one year watching Evita).
Let's face it, 70% of us are going to go see this to see if Marshall Mathers can act, yes he can.  With parts of the movie loosely based on his life you can really see that he probably wasn't doing much acting. The story is good and Em just makes it seem to come naturally. Truthfully this movie keeps it real. There is no one moment where you know everything is going to be ok and our protagonist is suddenly surrounded by wealth. You just get the feeling in the end that there is hope. You really get the feeling that there is a bond between he and his friends all throughout the movie even during a small 'trife' towards the movie's climax.
I think the fact that you get to see Kim Basinger in the same frame as Em is almost worth the price of a ticket. And I am a bit confused as to whether or not I didn't like Britney Murphy's character or I simply didn't like the part for Britney Murphy, but Im leaning toward the latter.
If you're still worried that Musicians should never cross the line into acting, Forget 'Deseratley Seeking Susan' and 'Who's that girl', leave your fears at the ticket counter and give this one a chance. I think you might be plesantly surprised.",1038787200,,1480,4.381818181818182
3448901,5,B00009IB3B,"This film does a few things that I found immensly unusual, interesting and praiseworthy.
First off, although the scenes in which the main character, B-Rabbit (Eminem), turns the put-downs of his race to his advantage are both flamboyant and hilarious, the movie itself frames the anti-white racism that working-class whites routinely encounter in the same matter-of-fact style with which most of us working-class whites have learned to handle it.
Secondly, the hero-journey here is just one of the steps along the way to success, not the customary last big push before the talented but poor protaganist makes it out of the ghetto/trailer park. After B-Rabbit walks away from ""flippin' the script"" on his rap rivals, he's still in the ghetto. But, now, just a little bit better prepared to handle the challenges ahead.
Last, but not least, I enjoyed the portrayal of today's young love. The gritty Gen-Xer kind. The kind that can evolve into a ""I-love-you-so-much-that-I-know-when-to-flip-you-off-and-walk-away"" type of love. And no, I'm not being sarcastic.",1038614400,,1057,5.373493975903615
3448902,4,B00009IB3B,"I did have several complaints with this movie.  One is that the movie started to slow and two the end came on too sudden.  I was hoping the movie would explain more of how Eminem got his links into the rap world, but it really didn't go there.  It concentrated only on his very beginnings.  I must say I gave this movie a four simply for one scene.  The scene were Eminem ""battles"" (raps) in a club for the first time.  This scene was the best part of the film and the one that will probably hold the movie together.  The acting was also good.  I thought that most of the acting would be bad with the exception of Kim Basinger, but it turned out to be all right.  I have my doubts that this film will appeal to anyone who is not a fan of Eminem's music.  So if you aren't a fan, this movie probably won't change your mind.  One of the things I respect about 8 Mile is that Eminem strikes me as a person that dosen't lie much and I don't think his life differed to much from the little glimpse he gave us in the movie(and if it did differ it was probably for the worse).",1038441600,,1069,4.018957345971564

This is the first time I was able to understand the meaning of Rap. And the challenge of facing your enemy and without physical malice tear him apart with words.
Well, Em has brought me into the world of another dimension with his thumping, swaying, gesturing, it all worked and the camera was in love with him and he with the camera. It was almost a sexual thing between Em and the camera. Em with his big wild ready to take flight equine eyes. Wild but without fear, no there was no fear in his eyes, just a solid Me and don't cross that line as I have come up from lower side of eight mile and I have forgotten how to smile.
Hanson did a great job by not over directing this movie. It was natural and moved at a reliable pace. Everyone had their 15 minutes of fame. The music was mesmerizing and I found myself in an almost trance-like state when Em was on stage with his arm extended and his body swaying to the beat, a great scene.

I don't like to be on the edge of my seat and then get let down at the end. But with this movie, you had all kinds of different emotions for it. I cried, I laughed, I even got mad. But that was the good thing about the movie, it kept you on your toes.
Besides I love Eminem's singing, actually what he sings about. He sings for real, about real life and that is what I like so much about him. No offense to him. But I am not one of those crazed fans who would trip all over him because he is a star. But I am one of those fans who admires his talent and mind so much, that it would be an awesome opprotunity to shake his hand and tell him how proud of him I am and how much his words mean to me. The director of this movie knew what he was doing when he cast Eminem for the part.
I congratulate everyone in this movie and that had anything to do with this movie on their awesome work. I would watch this movie over and over again and not get sick of it. There are not to many movies out there like this one anymore, that could get me to want to do that.
I hope everyone else likes it as much as I did!

3448905,5,B00009IB3B,"For a superstar known as a ticking time bomb, Eminem is a surprisingly savvy businessman. While his pop-chart peers Britney Spears and Mariah Carey broke into film with vehicles that cemented their status as walking punchlines, Eminem assembled outstanding collaborators for his own debut, 8 Mile, which comes closer to Mike Leigh's grim working-class realism than Hype Williams' flashiness.
Directed by Curtis Hanson, co-edited by Jay Rabinowitz, and shot by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, 8 Mile stars Eminem as an aspiring rapper choking on the poverty, stale air, and broken dreams of his trailer-park life. To dull the pain of their rudderless existence, he and his friends drive around, smoke pot, burn down abandoned buildings, and generally behave like multicultural, Midwestern versions of the kids from Saturday Night Fever, another bleak working-class character study driven by a mesmerizing central star turn. But where John Travolta found escape on the dance floor, Eminem finds salvation and redemption in battle-rapping, a take-no-prisoners form of lyrical combat that places a heavy emphasis on improvisation and crowd reaction. Brittany Murphy co-stars as Eminem's unpredictable and pragmatic quasi-love interest, an aspiring model who sees him as her way out of Detroit, but who seems willing to hitch her fortunes to somebody else in case he doesn't work out.
Effortlessly authentic in its depiction of working-class despair and the hope engendered by hip-hop's promise of upward social mobility, 8 Mile brings to the forefront the lower-class anger bubbling just under the surface of Eminem's music. Scott Silver's script follows a familiar arc that takes the rapper from humiliation and self-doubt to triumph and self-confidence, but the film's absolute conviction keeps it from feeling formulaic. By this point, even blue-haired grandmas will realize that the Eminem saga doesn't end with the rapper working at McDonald's and sharing a basement apartment with Vanilla Ice, but 8 Mile plunges so deep into the hopelessness of its setting that his success never feels preordained. Since his ascension to pop-culture royalty, Eminem has transformed the messy emotions of his life into musical black comedy. In 8 Mile, that life becomes an equally riveting drama.",1038182400,,2282,5.485795454545454
3448906,4,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile, directed by Curtis Hanson of ""L.A. Confidential"", is the story of Jimmy Smith Jr., or Bunny Rabbit (Eminem), a young man who expresses himself through the art of rapping and writing raps. The story involves his best friends Future, Cheddar Bob, Sol George and a cast of other interesting characters. The story of this movie is basically Rabbit coping with his depressing trailer-park life in the slums of Detroit. One day, working at his his dull, strenuous job at the car factory, he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy) and begins a relationship. Despite all these other details, the main point of the story is Rabbit and how he raps to deal with life.
 I enjoyed this movie alot. Eminem's suprisingly good performance raised my respect for him alot. Of course, I still think he is arrogant and obnoxious, but that's besides the point. Other fine performances include a great trailer-trash drunken mother, played by Kim Basinger. Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Phifer, and all the other members of Rabbit's circle of friends gave great performances as well.
 My only problem with this movie is the relationship between Alex and Rabbit. It was a tad unconvincing. They did not have many scenes together, yet it was made out so they knew each other so well. Don't let that put you off though. This is a truly remarkable urban drama with great directing from Curtis Hanson and some great performances. For fans, there are some great rap scenes in here, even though you've probably already seen it. Check it out.

Directed by Curtis Hanson
Starring Eminem, Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, And Brittany Murphy

3448907,4,B00009IB3B,"Jimmy Smith Jr. is practicing his lines and verses in a dirty and dark bathroom before he is to hit the stage and partake in a battle, (rap-diss competition).  He looks into the mirror as he practices and practices.  He seems confident and ready, until he runs to the toilet and regurgitates.  As much as he wants to do this, he's still scared out of his mind.  But soon, it is time for him to go onstage and compete.
This is the story of Jimmy ""Rabbit,"" Smith, and his struggles and life in 8 Mile.  He has dreams of becoming a rapper, but he knows that until he is able to act out on it, that's all it is; a dream.  Him and his buddies talk about how they're going to be rich and famous, but Rabbit appears to be the only one with potential and determination.  The others, well, just like to talk, and it seems like that's all they'll ever do.  A very important figure is Future, Rabbit's friend, and the host of the ""battles.""  He sort of looks over him like a father figure, always encouraging him and telling him that he can be something if he puts his mind to it.
Things are going badly for Rabbit, however.  He broke up with his girlfriend, which means moving back with his mother and little sister in a trailer home, along with his mother's boyfriend who can't stand Rabbit, (the feeling is very mutual).  His mother doesn't appear to have much confidence in how Rabbit is living his life, thinking that he'll never amount to anything.  He works at a job in where his boss is looking for any excuse to fire him.  And as the days go on, he seems to be having more and more doubts about how things are going to turn out in the end for him.  However, there is still something inside of him that will not let him give up, no matter what.
""8 Mile"" is a sad, and yet triumphant film about how far someone will go to make their dreams come true, no matter what obstacles are thrown in the way.  Rabbit very much wants to be a rapper, and to also get out of 8 Mile, where he knows he will never fully succeed until he gets out of there.  It's a very well done movie, at that.  Curtis Hanson does a terrific job of directing, and I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that he was qualified for the job.  I don't think it would've been as good if it were done by anyone else.  This isn't a dreamy or fantasy movie; it's real life.  The struggles and achievements are real and not artificial.
Eminem brings great charisma onto the screen.  All the critics are saying how good of an actor he really is.  Although I thought he was awesome, I don't he had to do that much acting.  He just had to be himself and get back into the mind frame of a struggling kid with dreams.  However, that does not mean it's an easy task.  Eminem proved that he could do a great job on screen.
The other actors are also really great in the movie.  Kim Basinger turns out to be quite believable as Rabbit's troubled and alcoholic mother.  Brittany Murphy does a terrific job of playing Alex, Rabbit's somewhat new love interest.  (Trust me, ""somewhat"" is the right word.)  Mekhi Phifer is also outstanding as Future, and proves to be a great friend to Rabbit, through the good times and the bad.
A lot of people have said that the movie is not really based on Eminem's life, but more inspired by it.  I can see that, because seeing the movie really gives you more of an idea of what Eminem had to go through to get to where he is right now.  He isn't some white kid pretending to be from the hood; this is really where he grew up.  He's walked the walk and talked the talk.  He is the real deal.  There are things you can see where the inspiration came from; like the relationship between Rabbit and his sister is much like the one between Eminem and his daughter.  Of course, there are differences, like the fact that the relationship between Rabbit and his mother, while troubling and painful, seems to have more hope than the real one between Eminem and his mother at this current time.  (I can't really blame him, though.  Sounds like she's been terrible to him.)  Though this movie may be fiction, you can really see the truth in it all.
""8 Mile"" was a terrific film that I really enjoyed.  Do you have to be an Eminem fan to enjoy it?  Not necessarily, although it might help a little.  It is possible to still like the movie and not like Eminem.  It's a story about hardships, obstacles, struggles, and goals.  If you only had one opportunity to make it big and change your life, would you take it, or just let it pass you by?  That's what the film ""8 Mile"" asks us.  It's not about stardom and it's not a rags-to-riches story.  It's a story that helps us realize that some things are possible, but it's up to us to make sure they happen.",1038009600,,4720,4.246913580246914

3448910,3,B00009IB3B,"Don't believe all the hype.  ""8 Mile"" isn't an excellent movie.  It's good, don't get me wrong.  But it could've been better.  Controversial white rapper Eminem plays Jimmy (or ""Rabbit"" as hes called in the film) who lives in a Trailer Park with his daughter Lily and his Mom (Kim Bessenger). in Detroit.  He spends most of his time working at a car plant, very appropriate for Detroit of course.  But as we find out, that's only to make a living.  He just so happens to have mad rap skills.  His three friends keep the movie funny.  His best friend of the group it seems is David (or ""Future"") played by Mekhi Phifer (""Save The Last Dance"") who does an excellent job.  Rabbit attempts several times to try and rap in front of a crowd where he would be noticed for record deals, but ends up freezing on stage everytime because of the crowd's booing.  Eventually the plot thickens and a relationshjp with is Mom and Daughter grow. Rabbit also ends up meeting a girl with a similar background aspiring to become a model, played by newcomer actress Brittany Murphy.  This movie seemed at times to be ""Choppy"" in some parts, and the other non-famous actors didn't seem to do that well.  Oscar-nominated actress Kim Bessenger (""Bless The Child"", ""I Dreamed of Africa"") did a great job as Jimmy's mother.  The swearing in the movie was rather harsh and wouldn't be reccomended for anyone under 15.  Because this movie is semi-autobiographical (similar to Mariah's ""Glitter"" in that case), we get a glimpse into what was once Eminem's life.  After seeing this movie I also had a lot more respect for rappers who get popular by the streets as well as people who live in Trailer Parks.  I would reccomend this movie if you are a fan of Eminem, or just want a fun Hip-Hop movie.",1037577600,,1768,4.561904761904762
3448911,4,B00009IB3B,"I didn't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece.  Expectations were met in some places, and not in others.  The truth of the matter is, Eminem does a reasonable job in his first film.  The major flaw I found was that this film didn't give him all that much to do until the end, when he truly becomes the film's focal point during the climactic battle scenes.  Early on, the film can't seem to make up its mind who it wants to focus its attention most on.  The supporting cast are effective, nothing spectacular, but are an excellent foil for Eminem to work off of.
Some on here have complained about the foul language, but this movie seemed to me a great deal more toned down than I expected it to be.  I feared it would approach the excessive levels found on his album's worst songs.  Instead, it showed a different side.  It showed that there is more than just an angry man behind the microphone.  And as for what to make of the supposed defense of gays, it seemed somewhat forced, yet somehow it worked just the same.  In any case, it's not worth dissecting the movie over that one point.
If you're a fan of eminem's, definitely go see this movie.  If you're not, go see it just the same.  It offers a look into not just the life of the fictional character Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith, but also at the world of hip-hop that most people don't usually see in the day-to-day machinations of pre-fab hip-hop ""artists"" that pollute the airwaves today...  It serves double duty here in acting as a kind of eye opener to this world.  And as for those of you who claim Eminem is whining - he may be rich now, but this movie isn't meant to represent the here and now, something those of you writing such reviews might do well to remember.  Do other actors/actresses who are now rich get lambasted so viciously for playing down on their luck characters?  I've read enough to see that they don't.  So get off the random hate bandwagon and open your eyes to what Eminem can do.  You might just be surprised.",1037404800,,1995,4.389645776566757
3448912,4,B00009IB3B,"Controversial rapper Eminem stars in 8 Mile, a film that will leave viewers undissapointed despite its foul language, violence, and sex.  8 Mile is definetely not afraid to show the cold and violent streets of Detroit, where a crime is comitted every second.  Eminem stars as Jimmy Smiths Jr., otherwise known as Rabbit.  By day, Rabbit is a worker in a broken down factory.  By night, he is a rapper working at ""The Shelter"" a club where rappers face off for money.  He hardly wins because the audience always hates him and calls him a ""white rapper in black neighborhood""  After that, he returns to his trailer home (usually beaten up by the gangs that stalk the streets)where he has to deal with other problems, including his usually drunk mother (Kim Basinger) who continuously is dating people half her age.  After Rabbit gives up at a concert, his friend Future (Mekhi Phifer) encourages him to go on and signs him up for a face-off against a black rapper who currently holds the championship at the Shelter.  The movie displays a wide variety of events that happen from the the start of the week (Rabbit losing) and end of the week (Rabbit facing off against the other rapper).  Included in the mix is Brittany Murphy, who plays a prostitute and Eminem's love interest.
Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) did a fine job directing but I didn't feel like it was the right film for him to direct, partly it features so much rap and the ""F"" word is said about 175 times.  Brian Grazer (A Beautiful Mind) was a good producer and really made the movie much better though the writer added so much foul language.  Hanson and Grazer - Great combination.
Though this is a film meant for adults, some kids should be let to see it because its a very hard-hitting drama and features their idol.  Excellent film!

3448913,5,B00009IB3B,"I was talking last week to a female friend who had also seen `8 Mile.' She described it in a rather odd fashion as `ghettolicious' which kinda took me aback, but after musing on it over the time span of several classes, I realized that ghettolicious is the best way to sum up the film. It can be used to describe storyline, plot and characters, which would give me an easy one-word method for writing this review, but read on for the other words, please.
In the slums of northern Detroit, a young dreamer, Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) a.k.a. Rabbit, is stuck in a vicious circle of working in a metal-stamping plant and living at home with his alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger), his innocent younger sister, and his mother's live-in boyfriend (who happens to be basically Smith's age). Rabbit's only hope of salvation is in his innate talent to rap.
Rabbit does have one thing going for him-a solid core of friends including the influential Future (Mekhi Phifer), the good-hearted (yet argumentative) brothers, DJ Iz (De'Angelo Wilson) and Sol George (Omar Benson Miller) and the dimwitted follower Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones). Also (sorta) on Rabbit's side is his muse and lover Alex (Brittany Murphy).
In the span of a week starting when Smith chokes in a rap insult battle, the viewer sees his fall to the bottom of his miserable existence to the inevitable rising from the ashes and trailer parks of the grittiest part of Detroit, the 8 Mile district.
Firstly, I need to admit that I am not a very big fan of rap-in fact my CD collection mainly consists of artists who have been around long enough to have `Greatest Hits' albums out. Nonetheless, `8 Mile' drew me into the entertaining and diverse field of rap, which was excellently articulated in Eminem's rap-parody of `Sweet Home Alabama,' which was one of the highlights of the film. But despite the whole entertainment quality of the ghettolicious soundtrack, I doubt I will be heading out to supplement my music with rap, but that's no knock against the film.
In his screen debut, I was expecting Eminem to fall flat on his face and turn in a train wreck of a performance. Instead, he was excellent, or in other words, ghettolicious, here, displaying multiple facets of a considerable talent for characterization. It was not quite an Oscar-worthy performance, but it does stick out at me as one of the top ten that I have seen this year.
Also noteworthy was Kim Basinger's ghettolicious showing as a stereotypical white trailer-trash single woman with a drinking problem. Through her man problems to her bingo addictions to her hard-boozing habits, she walks the narrow line of being a character to be both pitied and despised for her weaknesses.
Plotwise, well there really was not all that much worth mentioning-basically, it is a musical adaptation of `Rocky' with all the suspense of the ending of `Rocky IV' (along with some ghettolicious additions that make it more pathetic in setting and up-to-date in timing)(thanks to a fellow IMDb user for pointing that out!). Look at `Rocky' vs. `8 Mile'-young white protagonist with authority problems fights his way to an improbable victory while along the way meeting a woman that changes his life. It's been done before, but `8 Mile' adds ghettolicious scenes, quite a few F-bombs and a richer (yet grittier) coating that makes the whole package seem nearly new.
Despite my lacking of a background in the world of rap (who said movie reviewers were perfect?), I was genuinely pleased by director Curtis Hanson's final product, and with maybe a bit more suspense added to the unavoidable ending, `8 Mile' would have been the best film I have seen this year. Regardless, `8 Mile' is an excellent and ghettolicious film deserving of a 5 out of 5.",1037318400,,3745,4.825816485225506
3448914,5,B00009IB3B,"It's been little more than a year since Mariah Carey proved ""Glitter"" is not gold.  A mere seven months have passed since Britney's ""Crossroads"" experience summed up the destruction of 40 years worth of feminist progress.  And now Eminem, rap's bad, white guy, takes a drive down ""8 Mile,"" making a case that he's both a serious artist and a serious actor.  Critics argue he is neither; whether it's the PC crowd from the left or the ""gotta be offended at something"" crowd from the right, it's easy to hate someone who presents such an easy target.  But, like Elvis, a figure Eminem references several times in his songs, he continues to appeal to youth and upset the adults, all while making oodles of money and, now, films worthy of praise.
""8 Mile"" (the name refers to the road in Detroit that separates the white suburbs from the black inner-city) showcases a week in the life of wannabe rapper Rabbit.  Like Eminem, Rabbit fights for respect in the black-dominated rap underground.  Like Eminem, Rabbit lives with his mother in a trailer park.  And like Em, Rabbit is desperate for a way to get out.  His friends encourage him to become involved with ""battles,"" 45-second freestyle raps where two contestants try to insult each other, and the best insults win.  Although Rabbit readily lets his rhymes slip at work and at play, when it's crunch time, he chokes.  The movie opens with Rabbit blowing a contest, and then stumbling home to explain to his alcoholic mother (a perfectly cast Kim Bassinger) that he broke up with his ""pregnant"" girlfriend and gave her the car.
The movie then moves through a series of vignettes - Rabbit at work, Rabbit at play, Rabbit in love, Rabbit rapping - with the desperation of his situation tightening like choke-collar.  The ""plot"" is loose at best; ""8 Mile"" could best be described as a slice-of-life with a ""Rocky""-like ending (like we didn't know that was coming).  The utter poverty and hopelessness which pervades the film is superceded by a single ray of hope: that there may be a way, through talent, to rise above the cycle of poverty that has dragged every one of Rabbit's friends and family into despair.  It finally becomes a decision between working overtime for guaranteed cash, or taking a risk and aiming for something more - a choice that any creative person will recognize.
""8 Mile"" works because it ignores its star and stays true to the spirit of creativity.  What could easily have been a ""look at me"" movie for Eminem remains a ""look at THIS' movie about creative people trapped in the worst of urban conditions.  The ending of the film does not have Rabbit signing a multi-million dollar record deal, or marrying the girl, or becoming a superstar.  It's a small but important victory in a person's life, and keeps the entire film in perspective.  Director Curtis Hanson did the impossible: took a musical artist and turned him into a great actor in a very good movie.  Take a walk down ""8 Mile,"" but check your cynicism at the door.

3448915,3,B00009IB3B,"8 Mile is a good movie.  I don't mean it is a good debut for a rapper-turned-actor, or it is a good movie for it's genre, I mean it is a good movie.  I'm not surprised either. I've heard all kinds of word of mouth on this film, but the bottom line is that if Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential, Wonder Boys)
decided to make the film he must have seen something.  Whether it was in Emeinem as an actor, or the story, whatever, it works.
Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks in Detroit.  He goes by the stage name Rabbit when he is trying to rap, but he has terrible stage fright.  Additionally his girlfriend dumps him and he is forced to move back into his mother's trailer.  Sounds sunny doesn't it?  His motivation is clear though.  He doesn't want to be just another loser from the 313 (the area he grew up in).  His way out is music, that's it.  This isn't Hollywood.
The film is ""losely"" based on Eminem's real life.  From listening to his CD's I can pick some of these elements out, and this is important.  Eminem is good in the film.  He has screen presence, but he did not find some glossy action flick (as say DMX did), or some cheesy fluff (as say Britany Spears did), to make his feature debut.  No, he stayed true to his roots, a smart decision.  Eminem is an angry young man.  Wanna know why?  See 8 Mile.  It may not be entirely a true story, but the point is there.  This is how Eminem, the character, was created.  His real name, like Jimmy Smith, is Marshall Mathers. There is a difference.  Is he shocking? Is he vulgar? Is he violent?  The answer to all these questions would be yes.  If this was your life I think you would be too.  After all, he's not from Commonwealth.",1037232000,,1723,4.214723926380368

Whatever the critics say about Eminem, he does have a true talent and through this movie, we see his love and passion for music.  Out of a scale of 1-10, I would give this movie a 12.

In addition, he has a mother (Kim Basinger) who is emotionally neglectful and verbally abusive, which intensifies the insecurities of Rabbit.

3448918,4,B00009IB3B,"Eminem's performance as Jimmy/Rabbit in ""8 Mile"" is as auspicious and as natural and un-mannered as Diana Ross's debut in ""Lady Sings the Blues."" The fact that both are singers, though their music is miles apart in style, should not be a surprise to anyone though, as it takes just as much emotional awareness and guts to sell a song, as it is to give a fully realized performance on the screen. Whether or not Eminem can or wants to sustain a career as an actor remains, at this point a mystery.
The plot of ""8 Mile"" is very straightforward: a quick-tempered young man from the bad side of the tracks (Rabbit) has a talent not only for rapping but also for getting into trouble. He longs to make a career of his musical talent but chokes when he is asked to perform in front of an audience. Rabbit's mother (Kim Bassinger) is not available emotionally to him as she has her own problems: dealing with alcohol dependence and relationship problems.
At the outset, I thought this film was going to go the ""rags to riches"" route with Rabbit finding success and money only to lose the love of those closest to him as in ""A Star is Born"" or ""Funny Girl."" But the director, Curtis Hanson is too smart a cookie and too intelligent a filmmaker for that. Instead, Rabbit has a small revelation, a small turnaround, and a small success in his musical career that amounts to a less than expected catharsis on our part but a more realistic one on Rabbit's. As such, Hanson is looking for the truths in Rabbit's life not the fantasies in ours. And, more to the point...it works.
The best scenes in ""8 Mile"" are the sweaty, intense rap duels set in a dark, dank nightclub. I am not a fan of rap yet I felt the heat, the fervor, and the commitment of the rappers up front and in my face. Hanson sets these scenes in such a way so as to jam the rappers and their raps down our collective throats. If nothing else, this film will serve to educate/wake people up to the emotional connection and dedication that so many young people (of all races) feel for rap. There is a transcendent and spellbinding truth going on in rap that frankly I, along with many others, felt cut off from.  Now, at the very least I understand.",1037145600,,2202,4.397058823529412
3448919,4,B00009IB3B,"I was expecting more profranity in this movie, more from Brittany Murphy's character., However, I still question which part is of Eminem's life and which isn't? I find this to be great.  This movie delivers a fine thing line between the real and the fake.  Something that I find pleasing.  I certainly don't want to watch a movie where every word, every step and every thing is predictable.
One thing I am unsure of is why Brittany Murphy's character was written into the script. The only purpose I could see for her was to include her in the final battle.  She was a love interest which I suppose is best to have in a movie.  Or was it so that we could see some more T&A?
Eminem did a good job of acting. While many may criticize him for only playing himself, I think he was acting. Kim Basinger, who played his mum, did a great job. We have heard the rumours of Eminem's mum, and if they are true, then the movie did her justice.  Having the movie based on Eminem's life, I think movie-goers can see where he comes from when writing his lyrics.
This is a great coming of age movie, that really in the end, has a point to get across. Don't give up on your dreams. Just because you fail once does not mean you cannot carry on with it. I cannot imagine that Eminem will walk away with an Oscar but, it would not be surprising to see this as one of the best movies of the year!",1037059200,,1375,4.1893939393939394
3448920,5,B00009IB3B,"I can't understand why people try to say that the film is terrible becasue there are 200+ f words, or that the rap battles are all about putting down people, or anything that is a little to harsh for their eyes and ears. This movie is an ACCURATE portrayal of what it was like to be a white male growing up on the wrong side of ""8 Mile"". The reason that there are 200+ f words is because that it was like in Detroit, 1995. Would you prefer to see a movie that tip-toed around all the bad things about its subject?, or would you rather have a movie that presents an accurate portrayal of, frankly, a terrible place to grow up?
I can respect the fact that people don't like swear words and all that, and thats fine-there are plenty of movies that don't have a single offensive line. However, if you see 8 Mile, know that it is going to be an intense, comical, sad, and disturbing look at what it would be like to grow up in Eminem's home town.
Eminem does a phenominal job acting in this movie, and there is nothing bad that you can say against him. Sure, people will try to say that it's so easy to just ""play yourself"", as Eminem supposidly does. However, do those people think that they could present such an emotional, funny, and heart-wrenching character as Eminem does for Jimmy Smith JR., even if they were only ""playing themselves""?
Mekhi Phifer is magnificant in playing ""Future"", one of (Eminem is referred to as Rabbit in the film) Rabbit's best friends, who constantly tries to push him to use his talents in the weekly rap battles. I was suprised by the relationship that Eminem had with his mother-I thought it would be much worse- but it was some of the scenes where Rabbit lectured his mom were very powerful.
I think one part of this movie that stood out to me was the fact that I can relate many of my friends to Eminem's friends in the movie. Everyone has the bossy friend, who constantly pushes you to do more, either because that's their nature, or, like Future and Rabbit, they see something in you that they think you could use to your advantage. Everybody has a friend like the charater Sol Georger, played by Omar Benson Miller, who is a huge, smart, goofy, I'd like to say kid, but adult. Then there's the hilarious Chedder Bob, who looks up to Rabbit in almost everyway, and one of the most touching scenes in the movie is when Cheddar Bob had recently asked Rabbit what a good emcee name for him would be, and when Rabbit came to visit him after he shot himself, he called out ""Emcee Bob"", over his shoulder as he was leaving. The way his face lit up sense chills down my spine.
I agree that this is not a movie for most kids to see, but that completly depends on maturaty level, so it is an individual choice. Parents, I would want to take a look in to your local theater to seen how strict they are about minors getting in to R movies because I (... was able to get into 8 Mile very easily without having an adult buy tickets.
In the end, 8 Mile is a fantastic movie that sheds light on to a world that should NOT be sugar coated with love and happiness that is not there. I strongly recomend this film to anyone mature enough to view it.",1037059200,,3166,4.287145242070117
3448921,4,B00009IB3B,"So I assume that everyone is familiar with Eminem - a.k.a. Marshall Mathers. I'm pretty sure even someone who has been living under a rock for the last couple of years could tell you a thing or two about him. That is the power of the world's most famous/infamous rapper - the white guy you either love or hate. Well, finally he has decided to join the long line of musicians eager to give acting the ol' college try. Britney Spears did it this year, as did Mandy Moore and Beyonce Knowles. So why not Eminem too?
He wisely joined with two people who know how to make a decent movie: the director of ""L.A. Confidential"" and the writer of ""A Beautiful Mind"". With this combination, along with one of music's most popular figures of today, you can't go too wrong. And the combination is a winning one, because ""8 Mile"" is also a decent movie. It plays out almost like a documentary of Eminem's life, because there are so many obvious similarities: the substance-abusing mother, the younger sister who is almost identical to Eminem's real-life daughter, and the overall story of a small-town guy wanting to make it big in the rapping industry - not an easy feat for someone who is not of the same race that dominates the genre. However, not everything mirrors real life: in the film he has gone back to his natural hair color, and his character is not portrayed as a wild, gun-toting mad rapper. In fact, it's a little surprising - and pleasing - to see that his character is actually the opposite of Eminem: a quiet young man who freezes during his first on-stage performance, who sweetly sings his little sister to sleep, who actually turns out to be the most level-headed member of his posse. This right here proves that Eminem is actually a pretty good actor, because I believed that his character, Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith, was a nice guy, and I liked him.
The only complaint I had was that I thought two of the movie's actresses were miscast: Kim Basinger, as Jimmy's mother, is hard to imagine as ""trailer trash""; even though her acting was good, she still wasn't all that believable. And Brittany Murphy as Alex, Jimmy's love interest, did a fine job, but there wasn't really a lot of chemistry between the two, even though there were rumors that she and Eminem had a fling during filming. In other words, I didn't care whether the two characters ended up in a relationship or not. But luckily, that wasn't the point of the movie anyway.
The rapping sequences are wonderful. They are sort of slam-rap sessions where two guys are given 45 seconds each to diss each other as much as possible to a catchy rap beat. Then after they are done, the winner is chosen based on the loudness of the audience's applause. If only wars could be fought this way. The final showdown is amazing, and is the movie's climax - not unlike all of the sports films about underdog teams, where the final scene is the big game: you think you may already know the outcome, but how is it going to be executed?
I made the mistake of getting to the theater at the exact time the movie was to start, and it took me forever to find an empty seat. Once the movie started, there was no empty seat left in the theater - they even had to bring in a couple of chairs for people! The audience ranged from 17-year-olds, to middle-aged couples, and everyone seemed to be enjoying it - which surprised me, because I only expected a turnout of young gangsta teens who worship Eminem for his frowned-upon lyrics. But it turns out that the older generation can appreciate him too - they may not like him, but they can't deny that he has a charming on-screen presence - and that his first movie turned out to be quite good.",1037059200,,3679,4.484351713859911
3448922,3,B00009IB3B,"I have to admit; I was disapointed.
The movie *was* entertaining. It *did* show what it set out to show. It gave all of the Eminem fans a guiding light as to how he got to be where he is now. How much of it was actually based on his life? Who knows, who cares...
Well, if it was a good flick, why then am I disapointed. 8 Mile did nothing spectacular. Eminem, from what I seen, played Eminem. Does it take any acting skills to play yourself? Nope. Am I saying that Em can't act? No way, but this movie certainly has no grounds for me to say whether he can or can't. Also, Mekhi Phifer was extremely disapointing in this movie. He just seemed to be there, which isn't what I would expect from someone who has proved he can play a totally awesome role (see ""O"").
I went into this movie hoping something in it would justify paying the theatre admission costs. It didn't. I left feeling robbed, as there was nothing spectacular about this film. Entertaining, yes, but not moving. When you see as many films as I do, you expect a picture to move you, in some way or another. Else it is just another movie... as this was, for me.
So.. aenh. Will I buy this on DVD? No. Would I recommend you see it? Yup. In theatres? Nah, save yourself a couple bucks and rent it when it comes out on DVD.

Eminem's surprising acting abilities coupled with a great supporting cast, including his mom played by Kim Basinger made the movie a success! I highly recommend this movie, though I would definitely adhere to the rated R review.  The language is exactly what you'd expect with some surprises thrown in.  There is no nudity, unless you count Eminem's butt!  Enjoy the show!",1036972800,,477,4.780487804878049
3448925,4,B00009IB3B,"I've always enjoyed listening to Eminem's music, but I never believed that I would enjoy watching Eminem follow other rappers footsteps and try his thing on the big screen.  However, I was intrigued by the trailers for 8 Mile.  Yes, the movie's plot is highly familiar: A kid, down on his luck, tries his best to make a life for himself.  He uses his talent for rap to try and make it out of the trailer park home that he lives in with his deadbeat mom and her drunk boyfriend.  Along the way, he is met by many obstacles, but he persists and makes it.  We've all seen these movies before.  What grabbed me in the trailers was the fact that you could see Eminem's acting ability just in those couple of scenes chosen to wow the audience.  I vowed to see this movie when it hit the theaters, and two days after its release, that's exactly what I did!
And I was definitely not disappointed!  Marshall Matthers (Eminem) plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., known to his friends as Rabbit, and known to the local rappers as B-Rabbit.  All Jimmy wants to do is make it big doing what he loves most - rapping.  Even on his way to work at a Detroit factory, he works on lyrics for his songs, praying that one day he'll create that killer demo tape that will launch him into stardom and out of his mom's trailer park home.  Eminem plays this role with such intensity, you almost forget that this is a rap star and not a seasoned actor.  Mekhi Phifer convincingly portrays Future, a friend of Jimmy's who also is the MC of the local rap battles.  He believes in B-Rabbit even though his last turn on the stage was tragically disappointing.  Kim Bassinger is great as Jimmy's screwed up mother and Brittany Murphy shines once again as Jimmy's girlfriend.
The storyline may be old, but it is so skillfuly done, that by the end of the movie, you find yourself rooting for B-Rabbit.  Not only did I enjoy watching the down-and-out-punk-makes-good story, but the soundtrack is awesome.  And the rap battles!  They didn't look rehearsed at all - looked totally improvisational!  Meaning: they were ""slamming""!
My advice:  see this movie - you won't be disappointed!",1036972800,,2137,4.532637075718016
3448926,4,B00009IB3B,"....First of all, let me begin by saying that I am one of the biggest movie buffs in the USA and I am a real critic and I keeps it real and tell it like it is. This movie, 8 Mile, was da bomb...this movie was the best movie I've seen this year, in the movies that is! Eminem proved not only can he rap but can act too. They said when he first came in to the rehearsals, he was horrible...terrible...couldn't act if his life depended on it but after some people worked with him, other fellow actors and director, he made his first BIG SCREEN debut performance, very impressive. I don't think he quite beats Tupac at this, you know, rapping and acting thing but he comes in second place to Ice Cube as of right now. Ice Cube is still the better rapper/actor out there but Eminem is coming up. The reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the movie ended...I didn't ever wanted this movie to end. When I was sitting in the movie theatre, nobody moved. You know how sometimes people get up and walk around, go the bathroom, get something to eat (things they should have done before coming in there anyway), they all stayed in their seats until the credits started to roll. Not one person was dissappointed after this movie went off. Everybody was laughing and cheering and clapping throughout the whole movie and that's a good sign. I was really enjoying the battles with Eminem against the opposing team. The last battle Eminem did blew me outta my F'N seat...it was spectacular. It was a wonderful movie and I recommend you go and see this movie or wait until it comes out on video and buy it, you will NOT be dissappointed.

It cracks me up to see how many reviews were written by people who haven't seen the film.  I saw it today, and while I seriously doubt this movie will win any awards, it's a solid  production (and will likely be very profitable).
Perhaps the best compliment I can pay this film is that I never had the sense I was watching  a vehicle for Eminem to capitalize on his current fame.  Mr. Mathers isn't asked to display huge range, but he does well with what's asked of him.  The rest of the cast is very solid.  The writing is decent, although the romance between Em's character Jimmy, and Britney Murphy's Alex, is so rushed and thin that it felt like it was added in a last-minute script re-write.
The best part of the movie, without question, are the ""battle"" sequences, wherein rappers compete for crowd approval by coming up with freestyle insults of their opponent.  During the final battle at the end of the movie, I was literally on the edge of my seat.  Very entertaining!
Bottom line: very enjoyable movie that does one thing really well (the battle sequences), and nothing else too badly.  A respectable acting debut by Eminem.  I'd leave the young kids at home.",1036886400,,1174,4.5476190476190474

3448930,4,B00009IB3B,"Being from Detroit, but now living in Texas, you can't help but want to see the movie 8 Mile. Well, it was everything and nothing I expected. In order for us to understand the character Jimmy and his life situation, we had to go inside the somewhat ugly and depressing world in which he lived. Trailer park, unreliable vehicles, unstable family situation, ignorant friends, etc., makes you feel blue, very blue, during two-thirds of the flick. So, on the one hand, that makes you empathize with Jimmy, and it also makes you appreciate the life that you have if it's much better than Jimmy's situation in Detroit.
The rapping, music, and some of the comic relief provided by the Cheddar character was the best part in my opinion. The dialogue wasn't the most original, but it wasn't the worst either. I loved Jimmy's perseverance in spite of his surroundings. Eminem did a commendable job. He does have screen presence, and the intense passion people have for hip-hop is evident and admired throughout the film.",1036886400,,1010,4.810344827586207
3448931,5,B00009IB3B,"Okay. I figure I was about 25 years older than the average person in the theater. Most of the people were between 12 and 24, and then, there was a smaller batch of people in their thirties through fifties-- the parents who drove the kids.
But the truth is, I was looking forward to seeing this movie and it lived up to my expectations. It was so good it could win some awards. I had some justified trepidation about my almost 13 year old seeing, but wild horses couldn't have kept him from going.
Of course, I couldn't be seen going in with him. He had to do it with his friends.
So I went in alone and sat between other parents. One was sitting with her two boys, ready to tell them when to shut their eyes during the ""too sexy"" scene. When that scene arrived, it was not graphic, showing naked erotic zones. But it was clearly quick, shallow sex. I winced that my kid was watching it as I watched this mother sitting next to me trying to get her twelve year olds to cover their eyes. She didn't succeed. They half heartedly covered half of one eye. I couldn't resist saying to her, ""You can feel your grasp on them slipping away.""
And I looked around the theater- the biggest of the megatheater's 24 rooms and saw a totally packed house, filled with kids mostly under 16.
This is a story about a kid who starts our so afraid to sing in public, in a free style ""battle"" he pukes all over himself before going on stage. He's broken up with his pregnant girlfriend, given her his car and has to, oh so embarrassingly, go back to the trashy trailer where his alcoholic, ... mother lives.
'Tis not a sweet smelling rose we watch here, but more like a coral reef, filled with beauty and sharp edges.
Eminem does a superb job playing the lost kid who finds himself and his integrity. The music is rap throughout and this child of the sixties, who used to diss all rap, has learned to like the sound. I'm a liberal, who, when I heard about Eminem, and his attitude towards gays and women, thought little of him. He makes that up in this movie.... to an extent.
It's worth seeing this. The third act shows Eminem facing his truth-- something the democrats could learn from, after last weeks political annihilation.
Now, after seeing 8 Mile, I'm ready to go to a real battle of rappers.
I still felt uncomfortable about my almost 13 year old seeing this. There was a lot of violence, profanity and three sex scenes that suggest the act. One with Kim Bassinger (probably a body double) and two with Brittany Murphy. Considering the setting for the story, the language was consistent. The sex was.... appropriate for an R rated film. The problem is, with the protagonist being a star whose fans are mostly under 16, they should have and could have cleaned up the script a bit, without hurting the story. At 57, director Curtis Hanson (also directed LA Confidential and Wonder Boys) is old enough to be grandfather of the kids in the audience.

The freestyling was pure genius, and I found myself captivated by the skill and the hilariously provoking rhymes.  Set in the grimy Detroit ghettos, the occasional qualms of morality and the sparks of humor from Em's friends bring an authentic touch of reality.  The touching sensitivity Eminem portrayed with his little sister reflects his real-life attitude, and this only furthers the originality and genuine tone of the movie.  My only complaint is the...character played by Brittany Murphy who, predictably, is wearing a new miniskirt and fishnet with boots in each scene.  She truly has no part in that movie; her acting is boring and thoroughly unrealistic--the most she does is dance like a...  However, I fully recommend this movie to everyone, excluding children, but including any rich white kid from the suburb (like those sitting behind me in the theater making cute comments throughout).

Jimmy Smith, Jr., a.k.a. Bunny Rabbit (Eminem) lives in inner city Detroit, with his alcoholic, yet highly interesting mother, played by Kim Basinger; and his younger sister, Lily, who is absolutely adorable, and Rabbit's only obvious weakness. He dreams of making it big, along with his group, 313, including Future (Mekhi Pfipher) and his buddies, including the hilarious, [silly] Cheddar Bob, and the politically active Iz.
Jimmy works in a stamping factory, where he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy), an ambitious woman with dreams of modeling, whose only real wish is simply to leave Detroit and escape to New York City. ""All I need is a plane ticket.""
Future resides over rap battles at the shelter, and, having faith in Rabbit's skills, invites him to rap. After we open with Rabbit choking on his lines, he is invited once more. Soon, we are faced with a dilemma, because Rabbit must choose between making it on his own through his talent at the battles, or his friend Wink's supposed connections at a record company, who promises to give Rabbit fame if he meets with a record producer.
Eminem is an impressive actor, though he isn't exactly stretching to meet his role. However, compared to the ""Glitter trauma"" that affects so many singers who aspire for the big screen, it's an affecting debut.
""8 Mile"" is rated R, based mainly on the language, of which the affect wears off after the first 15 minutes, but also for some graphic sexuality, including Jimmy walking in on his mom, and making love with his girlfriend in the factory.

An awesome soundtrack is sure to follow with another release of ""Cleaning Out My Closet,"" one of the better tracks, though widely commercialized.  Eminem's surfacing musicality and the heartfelt-looking trailers for the film should make for a well-spent [$$$]",1031788800,,383,4.953125
3448941,5,B00009IB3B,"Like for our lil friend maxwelle or whatever down there. I think he's confused that this world isn't perfect. And Eminem shows it how it really is. How he was mistreated and needed to find the light and he did. I sence some jelousy in maxwelle but thats his opinion. But yes ""8 Mile"" Looks like a very powerful film and it will be enjoyed by other viewers besides his fans. Eminem wasn't brought up like Vanilla Ice, Britney Spears, Nsync, and Mariah Carey. Eminem is REAL. He's been threw the things that he sings about. Vanilla ICE grew up in a comfortable background with a lot things growing for him. As for our other pop stars, you can just tell they had life made for them. But Eminem had it hard. That's what u really gota look at.",1031616000,,738,4.316546762589928
3448942,4,B00009IB3B,Judging from the trailer this movie looks like its gonna be good. There are rumors that Eminem could get nominated for an Oscar for his performance and I agree. Why didn't anybody see his acting ability before?If you listen to any of his cd's he can be all types of characters. Even though he hasn't taken any formal acting classes he still looks like he's gonna deliver a good performance....,1030665600,,393,4.628571428571429
