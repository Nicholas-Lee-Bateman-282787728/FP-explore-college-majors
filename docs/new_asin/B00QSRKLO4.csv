8692714,1,B00QSRKLO4,This movie looks like a child made it on a cell phone.,1466812800,,54,3.5833333333333335
8692715,1,B00QSRKLO4,"This is one of those movies (I am using that term very lightly) that deserves 0 stars. What a waste of $2.00 and an hour of my time. Save yourself the trouble and watch an old rerun of Gilligan's Island or Lost, you will be more entertained. Special fx? ha! Acting? Laughable. Dialogue? Cheesy. The only silver lining to this mess was that they didn't make it longer. 55 minutes was 56 minutes too long as it was.",1458432000,,413,4.3076923076923075
8692716,4,B00QSRKLO4,Fun little slasher flick from Dustin Furgeson. The lead female did a pretty good job and carries the film. Wasn't sure where this one was headed towards the end but the final scene is very unexpected and downbeat ala The Dorm That Dripped Blood. Check it out!,1448668800,,259,4.531914893617022
8692717,4,B00QSRKLO4,I discovered this movie on accident while looking for a movie by Wes Craven called INVITATION TO HELL. Glad I found this because it was actually better than the Wes Craven movie. I watched it by myself last night and actually felt spooked out. I saw another movie by this movie director called CHEERLEADER CAMP and kind of liked it to,1427760000,,334,4.491803278688525
