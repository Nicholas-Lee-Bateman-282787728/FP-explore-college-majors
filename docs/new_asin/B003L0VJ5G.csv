Would LOVE to have heard more from Denny Doherty, and Cass Elliot ... who always seem to be left behind. Outside of that ... good for any ""M&P's"" fans.",1516233600,,244,4.104166666666667

8399200,1,B003L0VJ5G,"Once again rubbish from one of the greatest bands from the 60s. Can't understand how they think that listening to old members talking continuously throughout the songs is better then hearing the great songs in their own right. Like their other DVD don't waste your money. Buy the CD instead, as their are no interruptions from broken down band members who think their opinion is more important than the songs.",1390694400,2,409,4.857142857142857
8399201,5,B003L0VJ5G,"This musical Biography is GREAT. Let me repeat, GREAT. It chronicles the fascinating life of the creative genius, papa John Phillips, and the mamas and the papas pop super group through the folksy 1950's, the psychedelic 1960's, and beyond. The mixture of sexual betrayal, alcohol and drugs, and ironically hard work, drive the classic music of the group; and, virtually all of their fabulous songs are presented throughout the film in original footage of their times. The skyrocket rise to prominence of the group, to the crash of the drug fueled addiction of papa John, his family, and the group, is realistically presented. After the unexpected death of mama Cass Elliot (purportedly by chocking on a ham sandwich), is followed by Johns redemption into sobriety. This is how the film ends. (Not in the film, is the later re-addiction of papa John and his death, and the revelation by his equally famous daughter, Mackenzie Phillips (of the American Graffiti film and One Day at a Time TV show, fame), that her father had sexually molested her). This biography was originally aired in 1988 as a TV show (which I actually watched at the time), even though the DVD and DVD jacket lists 2010 and the Czech Republic as the source of this film.",1377302400,3,1241,4.830985915492958
8399202,5,B003L0VJ5G,"This disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Straight-Shooter/dp/B003L0VJ5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Straight Shooter</a>&nbsp;is difficult or impossible to find in a reasonably-priced US release, so I decided to give this import a try. My experience with non-US discs has been mixed, but this one is fine. It was apparently authored in the Czech Republic, but is Region-free unencrypted and should play on any US Region 1 DVD player. The video is interlaced 30fps MPEG-2 NTSC at 720x480 and looks adequate; the disc itself is a DVD-ROM so no isues with +R/-R recordable media playability. The audio is an uninspiring AC-3/2 but is acceptable given the age and sources of some of the clips. Do not mistake this for a concert video or music video compilation, it is much more a documentary with music clips interspersed. Not all the clips are ""rare"" (some from Ed Sullivan Show have been around), but enjoyable for any M&P fan.",1364428800,5,968,5.591836734693878
8399203,5,B003L0VJ5G,"The live performances are really fantastic and those alone are worth it. Plus I learn some facts in this video that I did not know even though I have read Michelle Phillips' book and everything in print I have ran across over the years. Video quality and sound of high quality. Video, performances and commentary are equally balanced. Enjoyed.",1352592000,7,343,4.830508474576271
