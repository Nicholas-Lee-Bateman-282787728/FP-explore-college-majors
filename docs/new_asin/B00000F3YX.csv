7906625,5,B00000F3YX,"Fantastic example of why Harry is such a legend. Brilliant songs that tell great stories and a great rapport with his audience. Sound quality is great but the clarity of the picture is disappointing. Still, a must have for any Harry fan. Shame there's not more (filmed) concert stuff available.",1364774400,,294,4.9
7906626,4,B00000F3YX,"This was a local concert that was never meant to be anything other than a local broadcast.  So the quality is that of your local cable system.  Unfortunately it ended up being his final performance.

In many ways, this show is a time capsule.  Not only capturing Harry at his best, but showing us a time when music matter and the performer was there to entertain.  Not just there to cash a paycheck. No flashing lights and fancy dancers.  Just a talented song writer/story teller, a few musicians and an audience.

Harry gave his all in this performance, making sure the audience got their money's worth.  His interaction with the audience is priceless. Reminding an audience member that they are on Harry's time.  He will get to a song when he is ready!!

Compare that to today's ""singers"" who talk endlessly about how wonderful they are and how the next song was their favorite.

Here, its harry telling you his stories, as if you and he were sitting on the front porch talking.  it just happens that the porch is a stage and you are sharing the moment with 2,000 other fans.  Some stories told with music, some with just a few comments to the fans up in the cheap seats!

Yes, brother Steve tries to be the star at one point.  But Steve always had an issue with Harry being the successful one.  He kicked Harry out of his band several years before because he thought Harry's music would never sell.

This tape will make you wish you were there, even if you were born after he died!  If you never saw anything Harry did, this is the show to watch to understand why he is still loved as much today as he was in 1981 and wonder why he is not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Now if they would make this in DVD, I would be happy.  I wore out the VHS version.",1314403200,9,1760,4.291793313069909
7906627,4,B00000F3YX,"My theory is that Steve Chapin's involvement brought things down a notch.  Attempts at more elaborate backing vocals fall short and he seems to want to be the star sometimes.
BUT, this is a very good view into the world of a live Chapin concert.  My biggest dissappointment was ""30,000 lbs of bananas"".  They were just trying too hard to be funny.  Nothing will beat the ""Greatest Hits Live"" version.
Harry's performance is awesome and his audience interaction is superb.  He is obviously more than a little flirtation towards cellist Yvonne Cable (watch ""Mail Order Annie"").  This is a great video to have, but be sure to get ""Book of Chapin"" too-it is a far better concert in many ways.",1023580800,22,688,4.691666666666666
