8631788,5,B00HDYQGSQ,This is so much more than an interview...! When Todd White gets speaking so many incredible truths with weighted revelation start flowing from him. God's heart is heard so clearly through his words. My favorite part of this particular DVD is getting to hear about his personal story within his family life. The battle at home. Todd's wife not believing with him or in him. It was amazing to hear Todd's heart for how he lifted her up in prayer even though his heart was so pained- never once did he tell her she was wrong and he was right. How him and his daughter would just pray for 'mommy'. I won't give away anymore! Amazing back story I have never heard even though I have heard Todd speak many times before. Was inspirational Indeed! Could watch multiple times and receive more!,1391472000,,784,4.528169014084507
