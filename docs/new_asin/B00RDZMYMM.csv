8695174,2,B00RDZMYMM,"I watched the whole DVD with my wife, and neither of us could figure out exactly how a Key Man Policy worked. There were artsy kinds of screen shifts and zoom outs, but they didn't add anything to the story. If you like to see men kissing, there is a fairly prominent such kiss waiting for you towards the end of the film.",1459209600,,322,4.126984126984127
8695175,3,B00RDZMYMM,"Pretty decent Indie film. I was a bit surprised how true the set design was to the 70's when this movie is supposed to happen and the music score really served it well. Yeah, easily worth the $7 I paid.",1453248000,,202,4.075
8695176,5,B00RDZMYMM,"FULL DISCLOSURE:  I'm only giving this film five stars because my wife, Libertad Green, and her father, James Green, appear in it.

Otherwise, it's a raunchy little crime drama about an old murderer who seeks to redeem himself after he lures a poor family man into a dirty deal.

It has a 'Seventies look and sound, so I fiind it somewhat nostalgic.  I dislike the multiple screen in screen special effects, though.

The thing I dislike the most about this film is that it shows acts of homosexuality.",1452816000,,501,4.6477272727272725

8695178,3,B00RDZMYMM,"The film takes place in 1975 New England. Note the era whack-a-da sound track when they are running. Bobby (Jack Davenport) sells insurance policies and is at the bottom of his game. He is introduced to Vincent (Hugo Weaving) a man of means and culture. Vincent entices Bobby with the desire to buy an illegal policy, i.e. a Key Man policy where the Key Man refuses to be part of the deal.

The jazz sound track made the film seem better than what it was. The drama was a bunch of talking and hand shaking and then at the end, the film changes gears rather inanely. His wife (Judy Greer) was never developed. He explains the whole thing to her in one line, ""I did something stupid"" because apparently he didn't think she could understand what he did. Bobby was a spineless individual who was our new criminal protagonist pitted against an old criminal antagonist. Just not exciting for me.

The film didn't go anywhere for 2/3 of the film.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. 2 1/2 stars",1428710400,,985,4.4916201117318435
8695179,5,B00RDZMYMM,"You do NOT want to get involved with the smooth-talking bad guys in this film! Once again, Hugo Weaving shows what a versatile actor he is - from ""The Matrix"" to ""The Hobbit"" to ""The Key Man""! Jack Davenport's ""Bobby"" character, greedy for money to get the ""better"" things in life is the proverbial deer caught in the headlights, when he realizes all the trouble and danger he's gotten himself into! He's warned to stop several times, but just keeps going.",1424736000,3,456,4.6419753086419755
