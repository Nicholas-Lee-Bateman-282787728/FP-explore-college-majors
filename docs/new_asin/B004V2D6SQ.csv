8442608,4,B004V2D6SQ,"Suraj (Salman Khan) is a rich playboy who goes from woman to woman.  When he meets Komal (Twinkle Khanna), he falls in love for the first time.  Just as he has finally convinced her of his sincerity, his past returns in a very tangible way and threatens to ruin his happiness.

The plot is mostly excellent, beginning as a romantic comedy and turning into a serious drama.  Khan acts his part well, first as playboy, then as reformed man.  He is supported by a talented cast; Aditya Narayan was especially good.

Twinkle Khanna was not particularly convincing as Komal, nor was the part written well, as Komal was not entirely likable.  This detracted from an otherwise great movie.",1491350400,,682,4.728813559322034
8442609,4,B004V2D6SQ,"If you usually like Salman Khan, (he has really grown on me over the years; find him a superb actor who you take to your heart sooner or later)..., you'll like this movie. It's not one of those tough-guy movies, more a spoiled playboy falls in love with a lovely woman too refined or mature to fall for his tricks and his insistence to always get what he wants; (which of course intrigues him more). It's got a good message, a lot of touching scenes and turns out to be a very good movie.",1472601600,,488,4.202127659574468

8442613,5,B004V2D6SQ,I find that all Hindi movies have a good story line with a very good message. A good movie about a spoiled rotten rich boy that learns his lesson the hard way. Salman Khan is an excellent actor that shows great emotion at the right time. If you like romantic comedies you will enjoy this movie. Like the majority of Hindi movies they all have excellent messages.,1431820800,,362,4.417910447761194

8442616,4,B004V2D6SQ,"Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai is a very nice movie. Salman Khan is very good and is looking handsome as usual. Twinkle Khanna gives her best performance in here and deserves an award for it. The film was a hit in India and this film deserves the hit.

It's about Suraj (Salman Khan) who is a staying in London and he is a very big flirt. He's a guy who doesn't want to work or do anything. He just wants to get involved with girls all the time. Suraj returns to India back to his grandfather (Anupam Kher). One day Suraj sees a girl who he think he likes and the girl is called Komal (Twinkle Khanna). He finds out everything about her. He then realises that he is in love with her and he wants to marry her. Komal feels the same way and she then finds out that he is a big flirt and dumps him. Later she gives him 6 months to change and the two get together and Suraj changes in a big way. Just when everything was about to go right for Suraj everything turns haywire when a child comes to his doorstep sayi ng that Suraj is his dad. Who's child is this? Is it Suraj's? Watch JPKHH to find out.",1304467200,,1091,4.027649769585254
