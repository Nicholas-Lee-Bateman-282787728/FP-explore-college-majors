8339816,3,B001SFEPMU,"This very decent South African offering, while not a great film, is still worth a look. Think of elements of Murder On The Orient Express mixed with touches of Shaka Zulu. Starring Brit actor Robert Powell (also from Shaka Zulu), this period piece moves along at a fair pace. The emphasize here is on character and plot, and in that sense Pride Of Africa nods towards an earlier period of film-making, before CGI, foul language and sex became mainstays of the modern film. Although obviously lensed on a modest budget, the acting and characterizations are well done.

Powell does well as head of train security, and the characters wound around him are also well-developed. Special kudos go to Ashley Hayden and Jeremy Crutchley, who play the other lead roles. As the film progresses, and tensions mount, all the passengers stories are revealed, and what is most satisfying, all loose ends are tied up, with a clear resolution, by film's end.

Although not a blockbuster of a film by any means, Pride Of Africa is a good little picture and would make great viewing for a rainy Sunday afternoon.",1326758400,3,1093,4.808510638297872

Comments:
I think this film was a pilot for a new tv series, and I think this is the only one. Too bad! Robert was good in this part! The idea wasn't so bad (you agree with me that nowadays most of the tv series are so stupid!). But I have to recognize that a weakly point on this film was the cast: you can't put Robert with bad actors! He's marvelous as a hunter so kind and human. In this pilot you have four stories about the passengers of the train. What I learnt here is that a woman can throw a man out of a train! and the man can survive and claim revenge! ha ha. And I also learnt that the same woman can prefer Robert to his young husband, well, that's not fiction, he's so handsome!",1101686400,,860,3.976878612716763
