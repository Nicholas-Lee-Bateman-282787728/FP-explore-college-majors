8179630,5,B000NO1CTG,"I first saw ""A view from Space"" and ""A Guitarscape Planet"" and was impressed by both. I wanted to see ""New Orleans Concert"" and ""Nature's Colors"" and chose to buy the Blu-Ray starter set. It is definitley worth the money and Blu-Ray enhances each of these experiences. I would highly reccomend it!",1177286400,,297,4.730769230769231
