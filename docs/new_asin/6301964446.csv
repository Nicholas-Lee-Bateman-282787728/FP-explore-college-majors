It is simply hilarious!  The name gives away some of the plot.  Like the previous Police Academy movies, its a very funny spoof.  The twist, of course is her brand-spanking new husband, has no idea she is a spy.  I can tell no more, it would ruin every rib-tickling following moment.  But I must say I'm still laughing from two weeks ago!!!",1210204800,,548,6.144736842105263
7817870,5,6301964446,"The plot is basically simple.  Boy (Robert Hays) meets girl (Kim Cattrall), boy and girl fall in love and get married, boy and girl go on honeymoon with tickets that were given as a gift from her boss.  What the couple don't realize is that the tickets are a ploy on the bosses part to get the bride involved in another courier/spy case in Spain.  The bride, who thinks she is retired, and the groom, thinking his wife was a travel agent, now are drawn into a mess.

Some of the situations remind me of Romancing the Stone.  There are car and foot chases, trecks through the woods, searching for clues, etc.

The humor is not the classiest, but it is very funny with lots of gag humor.  My teen daughter and I laughed our way through it.

The movie, made for TV and shown on HBO, is rated PG-13 because of the language and some crude humor.  There is no nudity (well except for Robert Hays in a bath towel), no sex scenes, and little violence (nothing graphic).  The language includes one use of the F word (it goes by so fast you almost miss it), s**t is used a few times as are hell.  The term ""nuts"" is used in a crude way (again it goes by fast).  The bad language isn't over done and both my daughter and I felt it was tolerable.

It is a fun ride. If you like Robert Hays (which I do) and Kim Cattrall so much the better.  Don't expect a classic, but if you just want some fun, this won't disappoint you.

Also, try ""Murder By the Book"" if you can get a hold of it.  Robert Hays is cute in this one too, playing two parts.  The review for that one would sound a lot like Honeymoon Academy (with the plot being different of course).  ""Murder By the Book"" is cleaner and there aren't the language issues.  I would rate it PG.",1147305600,2,1729,4.153614457831325
