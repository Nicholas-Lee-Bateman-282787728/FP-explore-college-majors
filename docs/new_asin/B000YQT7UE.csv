8612722,3,B000YQT7UE,"Typical Italian/French-made, English-dubbed sword-and-sandal flick with an Arabian Nights flavor.  The usurped prince of a conquered land must regain his kingdom and the princess of his heart.  The Alpha DVD release is only OK quality but it has not been re-mastered.  The color is adequate but the picture is NOT sharp and clear.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1421884800,,366,5.1525423728813555

8612724,3,B000YQT7UE,"Conqueror of The Orient is the first DVD I have purchased from Amazon whereby it is not exactly in stock but is manufactured once somebody orders it.  I thought this would take some time to receive, but it got to me just as fast as if it had already been in stock.  The description of this movie on the Amazon web page (and on the back of the DVD) is close to being correct but in fact, it was written in error.  Watch the movie and you will see what I mean.

  The movie was made in 1960, in both France and Italy, but I'm guessing most of it was filmed in Italy because after all, it is an Italian film, and lots of the exterior scenery looks Mediterranean in nature.  Check out those giant agaves plants at the twenty five minute mark.  They are really something to behold and I can't help but wonder if they are still there.

  Quality wise, I had no expectations for a clean, crisp and colorful print and indeed the movie has way too many film/audio breaks, isn't crisp in the least and the color is a constant semi-soft blur.  Though in the film's defense, the color is still there and by this I mean that it hasn't totally bled away like so many sword and sandal movies that you get in those value-pack collections for $5.00, where it's hard to tell if the movie was produced in color or black and white.

  Despite the fact that this movie has a number of age related drawbacks, it does have its merits and I've even learned the following tidbits of knowledge from watching it:
1. It is good to curb your anger if you value your life.
2. An arrow doesn't strike into a target with force at more than forty paces.
3. You can turn a Sultan on by being haughty (especially if you are a captured princess.)
4. If one can become accustomed to a beautiful creature then one can also grow tired of her.

  The acting in Conqueror of The Orient is very good and this should not be a surprise because it stars the great Italian actor Rik Battaglia who delivers an intense interpretation of being a prince (though he doesn't know it at the time) in search of a kingdom.  Battaglia is Nadir, a youthful village fisherman who possesses all the necessary skills for being a powerful warrior.  When I first viewed this movie my aging ears had a hard time discerning what the others were calling him by name.  To me, it sounded like they were calling him My Dear.  I have to chuckle now when I thought I was hearing these muscular Italian dudes saying things like ""Don't be reckless, My Dear.""  Here I am, My Dear""  ""Come My Dear, let us go inside.""  ""My Dear, you are not who you think you are.""

  The beautiful Gianna Maria Canale (who placed 2nd in the 1947 Miss Italia beauty contest)
plays queen to the evil sultan in this picture and while it would have been an easy out to make her just as bad as the sultan, there is a somewhat multi dimensional aspect to her character that becomes evident near the end of the movie.  (Lovers of sword and sandal epics will remember Gianna as the ultra sexy Amazon Queen in the original Hercules.)

  The fine Swiss character actor Paul Muller plays the villainous Sultan Dakar to a tee.
(He looks like a stern Daniel Stern, at least to me anyway.)

  There are some outlandish scenes that you might get a laugh out of.  Nadir's test of strength at a nearby village (he goes up against a couple of wooden poles) and there is a blatant cardboard cut out used for the Sultan's palace, lit from behind with candles.

  Except for the cardboard palace, the sets used for this movie are actually quite good.  The Conqueror of The Orient film crew made good use of local ancient ruins and sprawling, rock strewn hillsides for exterior shots.  Some of the interior palace and dungeon scenes appear to have been made up of actual and equally ancient, rock walls.

  The highlight of Conqueror of The Orient is the fight scene between Nadir and Sultan Dakar.  It is full of action and it proceeds from inside the palace to out onto the battlefield below.  There is one great (but extremely brief) scene where Battaglia grabs some curtain segments and with both legs held up sails right into the camera.  (Would have been a great 3-D effect, had the film been done in 3-D.)

  The movie runs along at a good pace.  The music is more than adequate and the English dubbing is surprisingly well done.  If you are a sword and sandal aficionado, you might want to make Conqueror of The Orient a part of your collection.",1345507200,5,4440,4.3786764705882355
