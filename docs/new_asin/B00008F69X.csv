7982355,4,B00008F69X,"The film revolves around Melissa, a girl turning sixteen. The boys adore her...but they can't seem to be around her for an extended time. As the tag line declares, ""everyone is DYING to meet her"". Every boy around Melissa dies soon after encountering her. Sweet Sixteen is a cryptic film that is often enjoyable. Not often is the horror genre mixed with mystification, but in the case of Sweet Sixteen it is. Southern Sheriff Bo Hopkins is once again a crumb to watch, as he plays the role for the hundredth time. The film isn't as obvious as you might think, and it holds your interest until the finale. Few flaws in the film makes it a pleasurable viewing. You'll enjoy the film and its astounding climax. The acting is standard, and the film is as well.",1385942400,2,756,4.525547445255475

7982357,1,B00008F69X,"A pretty 15 year old ""bad girl"" named Melissa moves into a small Texas town. A couple of boys Melissa was seen with wind up dead, along with the father of a local Indian man that brushed off her advances. Everyone seems to suspect Melissa of mudering them. Marci, the teenage daughter of the local chief of police, promptly sets out to clear her name after accusing her and making her cry. Meanwhile, Melissa's mother has planned a sweet 16 celebration for her birthday to which the whole town is invited, during which the killer is revealed.

You would expect this movie to be a run-of-the mill (in a good way) slasher movie ala 'Friday The 13th' based on the cover art and it being centered around an event. But it's more like a dull made for T.V. mystery with an especially bad script with some lame slasher-like murders thrown in, that takes itself way too seriously. Like a really, really, really bad 'Murder She Wrote' episode. If you're are looking for something like 'Friday The 13th', 'Sleepaway Camp', 'The Burning', etc., look else where.",1187136000,3,1049,4.6702702702702705
