1407706,5,B000059PR9,"What more can I add ? Brilliant example of the Euro - Western Genre that has for too long been relegated to the sidelines as 'B' movie. Great performances all around,fun and enoyable. If your a serious western fan or indeed a movie collector,this movie should be in your collection. From the opening to end credits I was hooked. Now it's time for Anchor Bay to release the other Corbucci Mexican Revolution movie Il Mercenario aka:Professional Gun on remastered DVD.",1005350400,,466,4.8375
1407707,4,B000059PR9,"In my opinion this is Corbucci's best western (though some of you out there will think it was The Great Silence). It features an amazing musical score by Ennio Morricone who went beyond the usual stuff he did for the other great Sergio (Leone, the master). Franco Nero, who always wanted to shoot these films in english, but was handicapped by his heavy accent, plays a foreigner, in this case a Swede as opposed to the Polish he played on Corbucci's The Mercenary (aka A Professional Gun in the states). It also features another great actor with Tomas Milian who always went beyond his acting duties by playing the most extreme and colorful characters, in this case palying a mexican bandit that seems to have been inspired on Che Guevara (!). Let's not forget Jack Palance as the pot-smoking baddie, cruel enough to give anyone the creeps. Centered on the mexican revolution, this film is full of surprises and, akin to most spaghetti westerns of the time, twists of all sorts. Though Corbucci can't overcome the fact of adding some sort of humorous gag every now and then (after all he started as a gagman on italian films). Highly recommended, as it's chockful of action as well. The only let down is that Anchor Bay couldn't get hold of a complete dubbed version, so you'll see some bits of the film in italian with english subtitles (reason why I only give it four stars instead of the five it deserves). Other wise, the extras are great; we see interviews with both Nero and Milian. And it's also uncut and uncensored (and widescreen, of course). You won't regret buying this one, so do yourself a favor, and BUY IT!",999216000,5,1623,4.638888888888889
1407708,5,B000059PR9,"Wonderfully extravagant political western with a lovely Morricone score. The characters, as one might expect, are overdone and hammed up, but this is one of the pleasures of Italian westerns of the time.  Like Leone, Corbucci's view of the west is highly stylized, violent and compulsively entertaining.  Depending on your preferences this could well be a crude film with bad acting but if you are tuned to the right frequency the film delivers: it is a classic of this particular sub-genre, made with passion and high voltage energy, and in my opinion it also is Corbucci's finest entry along Il Grande Silenzio.  It's not up to Leone's standards, but then again, what could be?  Worth the admission, but you do need to enjoy this brand of extravagance.",991094400,11,754,4.913385826771654
1407722,4,B000059PR9,"Companeros is a movie starring Franco Nero as a swede selling arms to mexican revolutionaries and Tomas Milian as one of the rebels sent to escort him across the border to break a professor out of jail played by Fernando Rey. The professor knows the combination to a safe. Thats the only way Nero can get paid for the guns. Jack Palance is pot smoking bounty hunter sent to track the guys down. The movie starts kinda slow at first  but it picks up near the end. The ending is great. That is what saved the movie for me. Blue underground did another great job restoring this film. It looks and sounds beautiful. The extras have interviews with Franco Nero, Tomas Milian and the films composer Ennio Morricone.

1407723,4,B000059PR9,"Another fine example of the Italian political Western, albeit a comic one. The plot commingles an arms dealer called the Swede (Nero); Vasco (Milian), a Che-like, Basque-born peon with a Mastroianni facial tic who has revolution thrust upon him; John (Jack Palance), a roach-smoking American baddie with a falcon and a wooden right hand; a pacifist professor (Buuel favorite Fernando Rey); and Gen. Mongo (Jos Bdalo, playing essentially the same demagogic role he had played in Django). One trifling criticism might be that Palances overdubbed American immigrant accent jumps all over the map. Aficionados will spot allusions to Corbucci's Django and Leones For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

1407724,3,B000059PR9,"This is one of the better 'Spaghetti Westerns' out there but for my dollar, it still falls a bit short.

Here's the scoop. Franco Nero is Sergei Kowalski, a mercenary who, uncomfortably and repeatedly referred to as ""The Pollack"", falls in with Tony Musante, a bandit cum revolutionary who ends up gaining a true desire to unite Mexico. A feisty woman joins the group and they horde through Mexico fighting the Feds, while a very foppish and somewhat effeminate Jack Palance (known as Curly) tries to work with the Feds to wipe the revolutionaries out.

It's difficult to comment on the production as this transfer is pretty awful. I don't know what the original print looked like. The sound was good as was the directing. Most of the scenes moved well and the editing was smooth. But I had problems with it though in various ways. I liked the the Tony Musante character. He was engaging and he did transform from a small time hood to someone on a real mission. Giovanna Ralli is nothing if not gorgeous and her character was Okay. I thought she needed a stronger voice. My biggest problem was with Franco Nero. I just couldn't get into him. I thought he lacked presence, and he was given the annoying trait of striking his matches on whomever was closest to him. I guess it was supposed to give him some ongoing identity but it didn't do it for me. Ennio Morricone provides his usual great score and the director, Sergio Corbucci, takes a page out of the Sergio Leone book of directing by staging the final shootout in a circle.

This is one of the better entries into the genre. In my book one viewing is enough, but fans of Spaghetti Westerns should put this on their watch list.",1327536000,,1682,4.544554455445544

The cryptic right-wing theme masquerading behind left-wing themes, as is typical for western genre films of this era, makes this film a worthwhile standalone just as piece of cultural history but there's a lot more going on besides the historical significance.  Good bonuses too.",1279756800,,375,5.543859649122807
1407726,3,B000059PR9,"SHORT REVIEW: I've seen a lot of Spaghetti Westerns, and this is just another one. Not bad, not great (thus, 3 stars). Nero, Millian, and Palance are some of the greatest actors to ever be associated with SW's, but overall this is just another re-hashing of the standard SW script format. Very, very similar to the film The Mercenary (aka Revenge of a Gunfighter).The print and presentation here are great; widescreen, no dirt, good sound, nice special features.

1407728,4,B000059PR9,"Companeros! (1970) This is a very entertaining spaghetti western from director Sergio Corbucci (Super Fuzz). The story teams Italian superstars Franco Nero (Django) and Tomas Milian (Traffic) as reluctant mercenary pals teamed up to retrieve revolutionary Fernando Rey (The French Connection) from the clutches of his captors before creepy bad guy Jack Palance (Craze) can assassinate him. A safe filled with ""all of the treasure"" of Rey's hometown that only Rey knows the combination to is the prize. With a great Ennio Morricone score, a fast pace (despite a lengthy running time of exactly two hours) and a light hearted approach, Corbucci really scores with this buddy western. Nero and Milian have tons of screen presence and chemistry, and they are well matched against Palance, who is a lot of fun as a crazed pot smoking nutjob with one wooden hand and a pet falcon. As is usual with Italian films, everybody is dubbed (the Italians don't usually record sound while shooting, putting all of the sound in later in post production!) but the leads provide their own voices, and it also seems almost everybody is speaking English since the words mostly match the lip movements of just about everybody in the cast, making the dubbing far less noticeable than otherwise. The script also deserves some praise, with funny lines and salty dialogue that combine with the plentiful action and stuntwork to make this a highly recommended movie for those who enjoy a good western now and again and a must for fans. Check this one out!",1231718400,2,1529,4.953307392996109
1407729,5,B000059PR9,"Right from the opening of the film , I knew it was going to be something great. From the shot of the church to Ennio Morricone's brilliant score. There are great performances, great laughs, and obviously some cool hand held action in this film. It's a fun ride man ! Franco Nero and Tomas Milian are a great team and Jack Palance as the post smokin' bad guy is just perfect. This is one of Corbucci's last great westerns and certainly one you wouln't want to miss.

1407752,2,B000059PR9,"Many spaghetti western enthusiasts regard this as a classic of the genre and Sergio Corbucci's best film. They're wrong. ""Companeros"" is actually at a midpoint on the director's career trajectory from early classics like ""Django"" and ""The Hellbenders"" to late-period disasters like ""Sonny & Jed"" and ""The White, the Yellow and the Black."" The film is basically a half-baked rehash of ""The Mercenary/A Professional Gun"", with nothing like the former film's coherence or momentum. It takes far too long to get going, then rambles on with no sense of structure or pace, trying uneasily to mix broad comedy, political comment and Peckinpah-inspired action scenes. There are a few good jokes along the way, and the protagonists are so off-the-wall that they're curiously engaging, but it all pales in comparison to the best spaghettis of the 60s, not to mention contemporary work like Ferdinando Baldi's deranged but stunning ""Blindman.""

Visually, the film benefits from an excellent widescreen transfer, which is a relief after the hideously panned-and-scanned video we had to put up with previously, and there's a restored prologue which isn't in any English language version. The extras include amiable interviews with Franco Nero and especially Tomas Milian, plus Ennio Morricone explaining how the cacophonous music score was composed (though it isn't one of his best, I have to say).

When I first saw ""Companeros"" 20 years ago, I very much enjoyed it. But it weakens with each viewing, and even this fine version can't restore the shine.",1128988800,2,1540,5.230769230769231
1407753,4,B000059PR9,"Wow!  You get Franco Nero(Django) and Tomas Milian(Django Kill) and the immortal Jack Palance in one film!  And a fun film at that!  Both leads have good chemistry.  They basically get hooked into crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. to snag a guy who has the combination to a safe they need opened.  Nero and Milian don't like each other much, but have to learn to work together.  On their tail is that crazy Jack Palance, who's hellbent on seeing Nero dead, Dead, DEAD!  Palance has a joint in his mouth in practically every one of his scenes, and he's quite funny in his giggly, stoned and creepy performance.  This is very much a ""buddy movie"" like 48 Hrs or Lethal Weapon with the two leads who don't always like each other, exchange some funny lines and ultimately become friends.  Because of this, the tone of the film is more comedic than the average spaghetti western.  Don't let the lighthearted tone stop you from seeing it though coz it's still got the violence of a spaghetti western.  In fact, it's actually bloodier than Django.  Also, Ennio Morricone's theme song will get stuck in your head for a good day or two.  Very highly recommended if you dig westerns.",1117843200,2,1181,4.5933014354066986
1407754,5,B000059PR9,"Let me begin by saying, that the last time I saw this movie I was 8 years old in 1985, and I still remember every detail, the music, the villain, the gun fights and that freaking hawk.

1407755,5,B000059PR9,"Shot in the Spanish desert near Almeria, with an international cast of Italian, Spanish, Cuban, German and American actors, COMPANEROS describes maybe the reality of the American West of the XIXth and the early XXth century in a better way than the traditional Hollywood western. As Franco Nero points it out with accuracy during the 17 minutes interview added by Anchor Bay, the men portrayed in the westerns were European immigrants who mustn't be conversant with the English language. That's the reason the Italian actor didn't want to be dubbed in the American version of this 1970 Sergio Corbucci movie.

COMPANEROS deserves a pride of place in your DVD library, let's say between the first Leone's westerns and Damiani's A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL or THE GREAT SILENCE of Corbucci also. Nero, Milian and Palance give superb performances and the movie could have been entitled THE BAD, THE SWEDE AND THE DUMB without putting to shame Sergio Leone. The social and political pan of COMPANEROS is smartly treated by Corbucci and doesn't sound as an exposure of the American politics in Mexican affairs as it could have been. Corbucci suggests but never gives lessons.

All in all, a good job from Anchor Bay whose spaghetti westerns collection is a must-have for any movie lover.

A DVD zone last westerns.",1104796800,3,1306,4.954337899543379
1407756,4,B000059PR9,"COMPANEROS succeeds because of its excesses.  Everyone but a handful of peasant students led by an ineffectual pacifist professor (Fernando Rey) is greedy and corrupt.  The nominal bad guys don't simply kill the nominal good guys.  Rather, in a manner that would do a James Bond film proud, they devise elaborate tortures that, as a rule, provide more opportunities for ingenious escapes than lingering deaths.  If you're not convinced yet, one of the bad guys has an old-fashioned telephone mouthpiece grafted over his right ear.

 Franco Nero stars as a Swedish (!?) gun trader in turn of the century, revolution torn Mexico.  Tomas Milian co-stars as an accidental revolutionary and the two are thrown together when an impenetrable safe, presumably filled with great riches, is discovered.  Nero and Milian travel to Fort Yuma to kidnap the imprisoned Professor Xanthos (Rey), the students' hero and possessor of the combination that will open the safe.  Along the way, besides developing into a buddy film with the grungy Milian and the fastidious Nero, our heroes must conquer various groups of federales, a fort full of American soldiers and, most dangerous of all, Jack Palance's group of freelancing mercenaries.

  Palance's character is one of the strangest... he's a pot-smoking wooden handed goon whose only friend is his pet falcon Marcia, who gnawed off his right hand to free him from a crucifixion death.  If you find that more disturbing than absurdly humorous, COMPANEROS isn't for you, because that's pretty much of a piece with the spirit of this movie.

  COMPANEROS is fast moving and quite violent, but I found its exuberant, excessive and exaggerated violence as much fun as an old Warner Brothers cartoon or a James Bond movie.

 The disk also comes with 17-minutes worth of interviews with stars Nero and Milian and composer Ennio Morricone, who tells us that he conceived the choral themes for this movie as a ""Gregorian chant with a reggae beat.""  Makes sense to me.",1095724800,14,1994,5.042813455657492
1407757,5,B000059PR9,"Spaghetti westerns are, in my opinion, generally the best fictional films about the American West. You can argue that John Wayne made a bunch of great movies about life in the Old West, and you would be right to say so, but for some reason the Italians captured perfectly the specific elements of the era that made their movies seem more realistic. The frontier was a dirty, violent place full of unsavory types trying to get rich quick. Italian westerns capture this mood expertly whereas American films portray characters whose outfits look like they just came back from the dry cleaners. Hollywood films also tend to apply a black and white dichotomy onto their characters, the old ""good guys wear white, bad guys wear black"" philosophy that obscures the reality of the time and place. Not so in Italian films, where even the good guys often have distinctly unsavory traits. It's too bad spaghetti westerns went the way of the dinosaurs a few decades back; I never tire of watching these films even though I am not an expert on the genre. ""Companeros,"" part of the larger Anchor Bay ""Once Upon a Time in Italy"" spaghetti western box set, serves as an excellent example of how powerful the genre once was.

I knew ""Companeros"" was a winner even before I watched it. Why? Look at the two stars. You've got Franco Nero playing a Swedish master criminal named Yodlaf Pederson and Thomas Milian in the role of the devil may care Vasco. How's that for a line up? Anyone even remotely familiar with Italian filmmaking in the 1960s and 1970s knows these two guys appeared in at least a dozen films that would later become cult classics. And both never pulled off roles better than the ones in ""Companeros."" The plot is simplicity itself--at least initially. Once again, the action takes place in strife torn Mexico during the revolutions of the early twentieth century. Vasco, a beret wearing, lackadaisical sort of fellow falls in with a revolutionary army led by General Mongo. What Milian's character doesn't know is that the good general sent away for a tough Swede to help crack a safe in a captured village. When Pederson arrives on the scene, he and Vasco quickly tangle before the general sorts out matters. It turns out that opening this safe requires Pederson to cross the border into the United States in order to retrieve Professor Xantos (Fernando Rey), a socialist intellectual and the leader of his own revolutionary movement. He's the only man alive with the combination, and when Pederson learns that the wealth of Mexico resides in the vault, he makes tracks for the border with Vasco along for the ride.

Hijinks aplenty ensue as Pederson and Vasco run into all sorts of trouble on their quest. A routine stop by a Mexican border patrol results in a bloody shootout when Vasco fails to understand the intricacies of photography. In order to secure Xantos, the two must break the professor out of an American Army outpost, which they do by employing the services of a bevy of local harridans. The biggest problem isn't the two men's extreme dislike for each other--Pederson takes every opportunity to leave Vasco behind but somehow always runs into him again down the road--or the border guards or American soldiers. Nope, the worst obstacle in safely returning Professor Xantos to Mexico arrives in the form of John (Jack Palance), a weed-puffing thug with a wooden hand, a falcon, and a Count Dracula visage. This goon enters the picture when Xantos refuses to allow American oil interests ownership of Mexican fields if his forces come to power south of the border. Plus, John and Pederson have a rather unpleasant history that virtually assures the falcon bearing thug will gun for the Swede any chance he gets. When all of these volatile elements come together in the end, we bear witness to one of the most frenetic shootouts in spaghetti western history. And that, my friends, says something quite wonderful about this marvelous film.

I could go on and on about the great things in ""Companeros."" The onscreen chemistry between Nero and Milian practically leaps into your lap. Both men infuse their characters with great humor or gravity as the situation demands. You can't help but like them. Palance has never looked or acted creepier, and that's saying something considering the man's long career playing baddies. Perhaps the most notable feature of the picture is its heavy political themes. The realities of political corruption, American imperialism, socialism as a panacea for the suffering masses, and Milian strutting around in a beret looking like a clone of Che Guevara all speak to director Sergio Corbucci's goal of instilling in his film issues that circulated widely in the 1960s and 1970s. While I don't personally agree with left wing ideologies, no one can argue that big business interests fueled revolutionary activities in Mexico and points further south back in the day. Fortunately, the political message rarely interferes with the humor or the characters' charm.

Another important note: the great Ennio Morricone wrote the theme song to ""Companeros,"" and it's one of the best songs ever heard in a spaghetti western, right up there with the stuff this composer created for Leone's flicks. The tune sticks in your mind and refuses to leave for days. As for extras, Anchor Bay includes a trailer, biographies, and a seventeen-minute interview with Nero and Milian covering the actors' experiences with the movie. Milian admits that he is a difficult actor to work with, an assertion Nero seems to agree with in part, but you would never know it watching him work onscreen. If you watch just one Italian western--excepting Leone's stuff, obviously--make sure the one you see is ""Companeros."" You will not be disappointed.",1092528000,3,5763,4.925925925925926

1407760,4,B000059PR9,"Although ""The Great Silence"" may well be Corbucci's best spaghetti western, ""Companeros"" is surely his most enjoyable-- and probably the closest he ever comes to vivid characterization in his films.  Franco Nero's Yodlaf Peterson (aka ""The Swede"") is an amusing riff on the Gringo figure with ""much money but not much heart"" (to borrow a line from ""A Bullet for the General"").  And Nero clearly enjoys playing off Tomas Milian's sometimes buffoonish yet always committed ""El Vasco"" (meaning ""beret,"" which Milian wears throughout the entire film, Che Guevera style, only taking it off during his marriage ceremony to Iris Berben)--the two generate a chemistry that seldom occurs in spaghetti westerns, especially the highly political ones.  (""A Bullet for the General"" explores the growing alienation between the Gringo and the revolutionary, for instance; ""Faccia a Faccia"" documents the growing horror of the bandit for the Western intellectual; and ""The Big Gundown"" shows grudging respect between the American sheriff and the Mexican outlaw against the forces of capital--but no real friendship.)  Significantly, the film ends with the true *beginning* of friendship-- ""Companeros"" turns from an ironic statement by ""Il Penguino"" (the Swede) to one of political commitment and personal investment.  Against the amoral greed of prior Gringo characters (starting with Eastwood's ""Man with No Name""), Yodlaf learns by the end of the film that there is something more important than the self.  By naming himself a ""companeros,"" he effectually rejects the greed and apoliticism typical to the role.
Ennio Moriconne's music is outstanding, and, as he says in an interview in the disk's ""extras,"" he intentionally worked to create a unique ""style"" for Corbucci's film, one far different from the haunting score he had just provided for Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West.""  Unfortunately, Corbucci's camerawork is generally undistinguished, perhaps because he was no longer working with his longtime collaborator Enzo Barboni, who had gone on to make his own films.  Alejandro Ulloa's photography is far less accomplished and stylish (perhaps a reason why he worked almost entirely in low-budget, exploitative films).
Overall, a highly enjoyable movie, although the pacing (as is often the case with Corbucci's works) is at times lumbering.  One particularly interesting feature of Anchor Bay's print is its inclusion of the expository ""backstory"" of how Milian's character receives his nickname at the film's opening (the US version cuts right from the opening gunfight back in time to Yodlaf's arrival, several weeks earlier, in San Bernadino).  It's a wonderful five minute sequence, reminiscent of his ""Tepepa"" role-- and a shame that American viewers have been unable to appreciate it for thirty years.",1032912000,9,2807,5.432183908045977

What happens when Yodlof the Swede(Nero)steps of the train,fresh as a daisy (spats and all) into a dirty south of the border town is one of my all time gut-busting faves of any Spaghetti Western.

I'm no big fan of leftist politics and I thought the professors pacifistic message was interesting...being that it had to share such large chunks of screen time with machine gun battles and all.

7933788,4,B000059PR9,Franco Nero and Tomas Milian are the two best actors in spaghetti western cinema history and here they are together.  These scumbags absolutely hate each other but are forced to work together to capture a professor from the American army to get the number to a safe in which they think they will become rich.  Throughout the movie they try to stick the other in the back but are united in their quest for wealth. Jack Palance is great in his role as the antagonist as well.,1524614400,,473,4.425287356321839
7933789,4,B000059PR9,"RELEASED IN 1970 and directed by Sergio Corbucci, Companeros chronicles events during the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s when a Swedish arms supplier (Franco Nero) and a Mexican radical (Tomas Milian) agree to an uneasy alliance in order to rescue the highbrow leader of the counter-revolution, Prof. Xandos (Fernando Rey), whos a prisoner in Texas. Unfortunately for them, a former business partner of the Swede puts a wrench in their plans (Jack Palance). Jos Bdalo plays revolutionary leader General Mongo while Iris Berben is on hand as the babe of the counter-revolution. Karin Schubert has a support role as a sultry prostitute.

In the wake of the surprising success of Sergio Leones The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) filmmakers in Europe and elsewhere tried to repeat the success using the same playbook. As such, Companeros is similar to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly with Nero basically in the Eastwood role, Milian in the Wallach part and Palance in the Van Cleef role (generally speaking). Add a catchy score by Ennio Morricone and  voil  you have a new version of that classic Italian Western.

These types of Spaghetti Westerns melded the hysterically overdone Italo grand opera with Spanish picaresque convention. A Spanish term, Picaro means ""rogue"" or ""rascal"", and the picaresque yarn is usually sardonic, featuring the misadventures of roguish protagonists of low stature who live by their wits in a crooked world; and told with realistic and humorous detail. Here Yodlaf Peterson (Nero) and Vasco (Milian) are the two picaros with Palance as the wooden-handed foil.

While you cant beat Morricones iconic score to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I actually prefer this Western because it has better characters, a better story, WOMEN and superior mindfood. Concerning the latter, The Good had no depth or moral, unless you count lucre is the all and end all of life. Here there are serious deliberations on the rationalization for revolution and the justification (or not) of its proper or improper execution.

Those who favor picaresque Westerns (or stories in general) will appreciate Companeros more than me. I mostly don't like the occasional goofiness, but I can roll with it if I have to, which I did. Thankfully, the movies mostly quasi-realistic, akin to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Its well done for what it is with several highlights and novelties, including Marsha the hawk and some little turtles (youll see what I mean).

7933791,5,B000059PR9,"A story of revolution, power, and corruption. Three great actors of the western genre. Jack Palance plays the wackiest villain in my recent memory of spaghetti/zapata westerns. Highly recommended.",1441929600,,196,5.793103448275862

7933796,5,B000059PR9,"Looking at it, Companeros seems like some terrible undubbed Mexican western you'd find in a 2-for-$10 crate at some close-out video outlet, with a pan and scan fuzzy transfer, terrible dubbing, etc. - BUT NOOO, this is a great great transfer, widescreen anamorphic with rich colors and a great Ennio Morricone score. In plot and cast it's similar to 'The Mercenary' also with Franco Nero. If you love the Leone westerns and love Django, this is a must",1375920000,,451,4.794871794871795
7933797,4,B000059PR9,"This is a great genre film. As violent as they come, but smarter than most. Th revolution of the Mexican peasants was better brought to the screen by The Mercenary, but Jack Palance performance stands out as one of his best.",1369094400,,224,4.487804878048781
