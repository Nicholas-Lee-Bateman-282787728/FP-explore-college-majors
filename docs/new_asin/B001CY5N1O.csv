3520626,5,B001CY5N1O,I love the dvd because I love the show. but I was expecting more of what we didn't get to see. don't get me wrong it's worth buying but I felt it was lacking uncut footage. it is a reality show is it not,1248566400,,203,3.6363636363636362
3520627,4,B001CY5N1O,"I don't know how reality shows can hook you in so easily, but somehow they do and this is no different - I got hooked on episode one.  I knew of Kimora ages ago through her books and Baby Phat clothes and jewelry lines etc etc, and so when I saw this many months ago, I started watching and the rest is history.  This first season only has 7 episodes, but they are packed with 'drama' and good insights into the life of Kimora who is a very demanding and tough business woman, yet a loving and devoted mother to her two cute girls.  You can see her tough love approach with them and how she doesn't always let them get their own way.  I don't think she is someone I could ever work for as she would be so demanding and the stress would kill me.
Here is the way the episodes play out;
1 - FIERCE AND FABULOUS - In this brand-new series we are introduced to the fabulous life of Kimora Lee Simmons and follow her and her staff as they plan and execute a campaign for the new KLS Collection.
2 - VANITY FLAIR - Kimora tires to land the cover of Source Magazine and find drama when selecting a dress for the big Vanity Fair party (lots of hissy fits here).
3 - THE DEVIL WEARS BABY PHAT - Kimora is named Designer of the Year, and much to her dismay, she must deliver an acceptance speech.  Meanwhile, the search is on to find her a new assistant (This is where you really see how tough she'd be as a boss - I wouldn't make it through the first interview and I'm a hard worker).
4 - KIMORA KNOWS SHE CANNES - Kimora and her crew head to Cannes, where they will be launching her new KLS Collection to the European market at a huge star-studded event.
5 - KEEPIN' IT REAL ESTATE - Kimora has three days to find a fabulous new home in Los Angeles, and Mallory needs to make sure Ming and Aoki love L.A.
6 - IN STORE FOR FABULOSITY - Kimora decides to launch her new jewelry line at the Baby Phat store, and summons a feng shui expert to bring in some harmony before the big event (weird).
7 - KIDDIE COUTURE - Kimora is introducing a new line of kids' clothing in honor of Aoki and Ming Lee, and launching it with an exclusive fashion show.
Overall, this is a fun and lighthearted show.  I have to say she certainly works hard and demands her staff do the same.  She is a loving mother and a seemingly nice person, although I think there is a lot of love for herself because at times she seems like the most stuck up person in the world, but overall she is reasonably likeable and so is this show.  Her kids are cute (with the beginnings of a hint of too much self confidence already), and I think that if you start watching the first episode, before you know it you'll be totally hooked as well.  Fun to watch.",1223942400,13,2704,4.115749525616699

8290371,5,B001CY5N1O,"Please know that I understand that both Kimora Lee Simmons and Russell Simmons have successfully moved on with their love lives. This dvd caught my interest initially due to the feature of publicists and Kimora Lee Simmons self-confident and enterprising persona. This dvd of Kimora Life In The Fab Lane Season 1 is a spellbinding foray into her entourage and her life.  Dvds like this are an important study because it is common knowledge that women as successful/accomplished as Kimora Lee Simmons do not always allow the public into their lives via either a dvd or book.
