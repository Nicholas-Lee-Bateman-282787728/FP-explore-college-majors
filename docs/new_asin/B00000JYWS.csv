He sits (use to lay) with is mouth agape watching every last second. Sometimes we watch together, but mostly I use it to do that emergency job or to get us through dinner. I only let my son watch once a day for fear that the magic will wear off. This is a must have.",1023235200,,392,3.792682926829268
7913764,5,B00000JYWS,"Our grandson (now i year old) has been spellbound by Moo Moo Moozart since his mother bought the tape for him at age 5 months. His parents have used it as their dinnertime baby sitter because he will sit transfixed, staring at the TV while the tape plays. One run does it for most meals; a rerun takes care of a special dinner! We're not sure if its the visual effects or the auditory, but something about the video really delights him. It's become our first choice gift for new babies.

7913765,5,B00000JYWS,This was a great video.  My 8mth old loved it.  He seems to really pep up when it comes on.  I love the music and I think it's the best mozart video out there for babies that I have seen.,947116800,,187,3.625
