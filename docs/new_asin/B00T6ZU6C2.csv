8700670,5,B00T6ZU6C2,"A nicely done update to my favorite superhero.  It's not the TV series,  but I enjoyed watching this on the big screen,  and Ban Daisuke's cameo was icing on the cake.  Rewatching it at home,  there are little details you miss the first time that you catch when you watch it again.  Spoiler alert;  Jiro ejecting the magazines from the bad guys guns in the first fight scene (the scene flashes by in a second,  don't blink !).",1450051200,,426,4.371794871794871
