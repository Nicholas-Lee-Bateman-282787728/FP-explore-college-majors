8569723,5,B00BJN7G9A,"I earned a Master's Degree in Health Management in the 1980s and worked in the field for several years. Weight management, nutrition, diet, and their related heath effects were central parts of my work. It was a very frustrating job since even with good short term success through tremendous effort and willpower, most of our clients struggled to maintain that success for more than a year or two. This information rich documentary explains how my professors and the governmental agencies were just flat out wrong, for a number of different reasons. Fascinating, and for me, alternately infuriating and heartbreaking. This Directors cut has great interviews with many of the scientific thought leaders who have fought for years to point out the fundamental flaws in the diet dogma of the last 40-50 years. It also has an excellent lecture style presentation that gives a great overview of the Naughtons' personal journey and discoveries.",1512432000,,937,5.171052631578948

8569725,5,B00BJN7G9A,Super presentation and documentary.  Very practical approach to eating that I've adopted myself.  Ketogenic is the way to go if we want to stay healthy.  We purchased more DVDs to share the message with family and friends.,1451692800,3,222,4.945945945945946
8569726,5,B00BJN7G9A,"There are few movies about diet that aren't seriously flawed by  subjective agenda and propaganda. This is one of them (The Perfect Human Diet is another). Sometimes funny, very informative and  well done, you'll learn about the politics of food and nutrition as decided by politicians, Big Ag, the USDA, and self-appointed interest groups  backed by opinion rather than science.  This is not only entertaining, but you'll want to share it with others you love because it's an eye opener.  Like the little boy in the tale ""The Emperor's New  Clothes"", the voice of reason and common sense rarely makes headlines, or when it does, it's met with derision.  In other words if you eat like a human you  will be swimming upstream in today's river of  diet disasters like vegetarian,  veganism and the biggest fad of all, the low fat highly processed carb diet - the Standard American Diet. Watch this then purchase copies to share.",1401580800,,926,4.840764331210191
8569727,5,B00BJN7G9A,"Funny, informative and revealing,  Tom has changed the way that I think about nutrition. This documentary debunks the myths that we has been told for years about nutrition and connects the politics dot behind it.",1390262400,,212,5.057142857142857
8569728,5,B00BJN7G9A,This movie is so informative and based on REAL science.  It validates all the things that I have been reading about and helps me keep on the path to good health.  Everyone should watch it!,1384041600,2,188,4.3428571428571425
