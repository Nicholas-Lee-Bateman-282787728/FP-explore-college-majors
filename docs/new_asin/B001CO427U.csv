8288324,5,B001CO427U,"Paulina is my favorite Belly dance instructor.
I have her all 3 DVD and they are the best for my beginner level.
Very friendly and simple explanations for many moves.
A lot of practice after that.
I do not feel intimidated unlike the other instructors DVD I have.",1434585600,,263,4.5
