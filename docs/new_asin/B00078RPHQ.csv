8045921,3,B00078RPHQ,"This is a collection of historical news footage showing the president during various activities.  It's like watching those silent screens all over again. What is hard is knowing what exactly is going on as there is no sound nor any introduction via slide or sign saying what is going on.  This makes the video worthless by itself, and at times hard to discern due to the age of the original recordings, but great for avid history/Roosevelt buffs.

I bought this thinking I could use it in a high school classroom, but unless I do a grand introduction beforehand, won't be able to do so.",1254355200,,586,4.615384615384615
8045922,4,B00078RPHQ,"It shows a lot of film on Roosevelt, but the execution of the menu and ability to move around in it taxing. Buy it if you want a completion on Roosevelt.",1233014400,,153,3.967741935483871
8045923,5,B00078RPHQ,"When I was growing up people still talked alot about Teddy Roosevelt (the way people still talk about nixon today.) I always had a respect for the man and he was the type of man they don't make anymore.

It made me feel like a kid again to see movies of him when he was still alive and winning the wars for us!

I only wish I had been alive when he was president.

I was pleasantly surprised to see this DVD in stock because I thought nobody cared about him anymore.",1146787200,,466,4.043478260869565
8045924,5,B00078RPHQ,"Ii bought this DVD because I was impressed by a similar disk about the War of 1812 and wanted to see more of the older Teddy Roosevelt footage.

There is a lot of it - some as early as the 1890s and the cellloid has held up better than I would have expected. It's too  bad that sound had not been incorporated with the movies yet because I would have liked to hear Teddy talk.

Still, for what is techonoglially available this is very high quality.",1146441600,,448,4.186046511627907
