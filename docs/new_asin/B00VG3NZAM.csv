7089276,5,B00VG3NZAM,Completely satisfied with this product!,1450828800,,39,7.0
7089277,5,B00VG3NZAM,"Excellent show! I was a little surprised that each season is roughly 7 episodes, and there are some points at which continuity is a major miss....but the show began on NBC, was cancelled, and picked up by TNT. With that in consideration, the fact that the majority of the stories flow from one season to the next is amazing. The acting is great. It's a gritty show, and was maybe too strong for the mainstream audience, but it is very realistic, or so it appears.",1448928000,,463,4.458823529411765
7089278,5,B00VG3NZAM,a wonderful series that ended too quickley,1446163200,,42,5.142857142857143
7089279,5,B00VG3NZAM,"I'm not sure how to describe it. It's gritty, extremely well written, photographed, acted, edited, etc.  If you like crime stories, police stories, stories about L.A., Ann Biderman, or film noir you will want to see this series.  I watched most of the episodes when it was on tv, but they are all worth re-watching.",1440892800,5,315,4.709090909090909
7089280,4,B00VG3NZAM,"Best series ever, wish there was a true box set with extras.",1438041600,3,60,4.083333333333333
7089281,5,B00VG3NZAM,Perfect!!,1437350400,,9,9.0
7089282,5,B00VG3NZAM,"Fantastic show, good box set. The only weird thing is that they literally seemed to just grab the box set for season one, the box set for seasons 2, 3, and 4, and the set for 5, and then package them all together.

Seasons 1 and 5 say Uncensored on the boxes, while the 2, 3, and 4 box does not. Having owned the Season 1 box set, I can tell you it's the one identical to the solo set. If you have any of the pieces, it might be cheaper to buy the others separate.

This was the one thing I bought as a Prime Day deal.",1437091200,9,518,3.787037037037037
7089283,5,B00VG3NZAM,"This is one of those Cops Drama that hit all the right notes
It's close to Flawless very edgy and organic
If you wanna know how clueless and downright Stupid the Program Department over NBC is They bought this Property showed a handful of episodes didn't understand what it was and Shelved it then after a few weeks just Canceled it (Without even airing the reaming episodes)
Thank God TNT knew how special Southland was and quickly swooped in and bought the rights
Aired the complete 1st Season less edited then Started to film Season Two
On TNT it last 4 years
The 5th and Final Year IMO hard to watch Cause it has so much strange stuff going on (It's like they wanted the Series to go Out like FX's The Shield) lots of odd story elements No good Happy ending it ends on such a Horrid down beat It was kind of a slap in the face to all the fans that followed Southland over from NBC

If you love Gritty real Cop Series Like Law&Order C.I. , Homicide: Life on the Streets, The Wire, The Closer/Major Crimes,  Detroit 187,  Murder In The First, Chicago PD, Graceland  you'll fall in love with this
You gotta Check this out
The Best way to Collect this series is season by season this Box Set isn't really a box set you'll get the complete season Lumped together in a box  (You can get Season One (Super Cheap $10.00 or less) Season 2-4 You'll pay the most for but, if you look around you can find it pretty cheap now Season 5 is also very cheap $10.00 or less I'm pretty sure various Wal Marts are selling some of these seasons super cheap near the DVD's/BR's Aisle with other Police procedural crime dramas
The Series as a whole is close to Perfect Despite the very odd ""downer"" Final Season  9.8/10",1437004800,8,1700,4.330188679245283
7089284,5,B00VG3NZAM,Best tv drama ever. Sad there is no new shows coming up. Loved all the characters especially John cooper. Excellently performance by entire cast. Bravo,1436054400,4,151,5.08

7089287,5,B00VG3NZAM,"This show has me crying and smiling and questioning and then smiling again. Such great acting, writing put into one show.

7089293,3,B00VG3NZAM,Not a boxed set. I thought I was getting a Complete series boxed set. What I received was 3 separate boxes. The whole reason boxed sets are bought is have DVD of a TV series together.,1483315200,,183,4.111111111111111

7089301,5,B00VG3NZAM,"SLAM!!!!!  The series was great and so is this set!!! The way nits packed is really nice, the short blip about the season tells you just enough, and the DVD's themselves are clear, good sound and the filming is just perfect, no jumping or flickering like in others I've seen!! THANKS it was worth the wait, and for me is better than HULU!!!!",1471132800,,341,4.412698412698413

7089304,5,B00VG3NZAM,Excellent series.,1468713600,,17,8.0
7089305,5,B00VG3NZAM,"Despite being yanked from NBC after one season and then landing on TNT for four more Southland proved itself to be one of the best dramas of the new century.  Very well acted, imaginatively written and edited and consistently interesting from beginning to end.  This is your next binge watch.  One caveat, though:  there is only one character in the entire series whose life is not totally out of whack.  Everyone else of the main cast has big issues; at least it sure seems like it.  This makes for tedium and a bit of eye rolling by the last season.  That being said, Southland is treat from start to finish.  Buy it now.",1467072000,,623,4.451327433628318
7089306,5,B00VG3NZAM,I love this show and am so glad I ordered the entire series.,1466553600,,60,3.6923076923076925

7089310,5,B00VG3NZAM,"The most realistic police show I've seen being a police officer for 26 years and 20 of those as a street cop .
This should be mandatory viewing for the spouses of the officers so they will know what they are going through every day !",1456099200,,233,4.086956521739131

8710014,1,B00VG3NZAM,"I tried to like this series but I couldn't. I watched it several times and IMO things didn't click. For one thing if John had such a bad back why didn't Che retire? You eventually find out he is gay but this is just hinted at. I never saw anything on screen that proved that point. Also, Regina King is attractive. Who came up with that horrendous hair style? Too bad it could have been a better series.",1504396800,,403,4.17948717948718

8710016,5,B00VG3NZAM,A nuanced portrayal of the men and women of law enforcement and what they have to deal with. Such a shame that it only got five seasons. Highly recommended.,1500163200,,156,4.413793103448276
8710017,3,B00VG3NZAM,Received the set. Everything was great until I tried to watch the fifth season. It was in a seperate case and when I put the dvd into my xbox it would not read it. It only worked in one of my dvd/Blu-ray players.,1496448000,,212,3.953488372093023

8710019,5,B00VG3NZAM,"I saw the first few episodes on TV back when it was on the air but didn't watch it past the first 3 or 4 episodes. However, I remember liking what I saw. I recently broke my knee and needed some entertainment during recovery. I ordered all 5 seasons and loved every episode. I wish there where more seasons! While this is a fictional drama, it's gritty and somewhat real which is exactly why I loved it.",1491091200,2,403,4.246753246753247
