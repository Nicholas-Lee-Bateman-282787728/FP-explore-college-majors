But that's why this documentary was useful: as info for people unfamiliar with Pakinstan and its leaders.  This is a German production.  It's spoken in English.  There are no subtitles.  However, it still has a different feel from what the History Channel or A&E Biography would produce.  I think this must have been something being made when Bhutto happened to die.  The last 3 minutes have the narrator just reading down important dates before the leader's death.  If there were a documentary about JFK or RFK, a great deal of attention would go to their murders, but the paucity of info on Bhutto's murder must signify something.  On the one hand, Bhutto says she did much to address polio and class inequality in Pakistan.  On the other, the documentary does point to those who say she was corrupt and that her father was also.  For people even mildly interested in South Asia, political dynasties, or women in power, you may want to see this work.  I must admit that it moved slowly, however.",1212537600,4,1134,4.666666666666667
