3466954,4,B001ASPZ24,"It has a fabulous story line.  The use of female agents in WWII is reinforced again.
The acting is great.  Only draw back is it is in French - my wife does not
like to read script.",1399852800,6,180,3.8378378378378377
3466955,3,B001ASPZ24,"It's 1944 and Churchill's SOE group has their sights set on Normandy. A captured British geologist threatens to ruin everything and quite possibly, turn the tide of the war in the German's favor. They must retrieve him from the clutches of the Gestapo in France...and they trust 5 women and one man to the task.

There's a former prostitute in prison for a killing a man. She's recruited in exchange for her life. She surprised me and quickly became a favorite. Louise...is the leader, the one who feels responsible. She's hardened, and I suppose she must be after watching her husband shot before her very eyes. There's some former dancer who romanced a Nazi officer. I didn't quite ""get"" her. Woman four is a young blonde, and the fifth is a Jewish Italian nurse who takes no nonsense.

The movie is action packed and suspenseful. Shooting, torture, secrets, jumping from airplanes, escaping the Gestapo. You never know who is going to be shot next or what plans will go awry. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan, and the women are constantly fleeing for their lives or regrouping...or worse. Not everyone can withstand torture...

There's nudity. Some made perfect sense, such as the dancers distracting the hospital soldiers, but some of it didn't--the weird death scene in which the girl took all her clothes off... I couldn't figure that out.

As I said above, the former prisoner/woman of ill repute became a favorite of mine, though Louise and the Italian woman were very strong too. I could have done without Suzy and the blonde.

I must say though, the characterizations were somewhat poorly done. My favorite woman made it clear she just wanted to take the money and run after the first task, what she'd agreed to, but then suddenly she became the most gung-go, the most determined to complete the next assignment. It was never explained, this change in her demeanor. And Suzy confused me.

I have a huge quibble: The movie is French and thus has English subtitles, but when they speak English, there is nothing, no captioning for the hearing impaired, nada. Thankfully these scenes are minor and I could get the gist of what was going on, but it made me disgruntled nevertheless.

The best part though is that apparently this movie was inspired by a real woman (Louise's character) named Lis de Baissac and I feel that it made a great tribute to the women who helped Normandy come to pass and thus, won the war.",1396224000,4,2429,4.769047619047619
3466956,5,B001ASPZ24,This was a nice escape from the usual and or typical War movies. Acting and direction was excellent. Really enjoyed it.,1395446400,2,119,4.714285714285714
3466957,5,B001ASPZ24,"This was exciting, well written story of the second world war.  The story gave you a unvarnished view of activity behind enemy lines & the problems faced by people especially women in war.  The only problem is it does not worry about showing raw actions, & not for a prude.",1395100800,5,273,4.44
3466958,4,B001ASPZ24,"The movie is rated TV14, so I was taken by surprise when there was a strip-tease dance and several (five I think) scenes with extended upper female nudity. I wish I'd known that before purchasing the movie. I am very interested in World War II stories, and this one was intriguing. There was just enough suspense, lots of period costumes (perhaps a little overdone). The violence was honest, too brutal for youngsters but true to the time. Considering the nudity and violence, the rating is misleading and should be changed. This is not a movie for kids or anyone who does not have a grasp of what occurred at this point in the war and how high the stakes really were.",1392940800,11,668,4.528925619834711
3466959,4,B001ASPZ24,"""The Female Agents"" is a movie based very loosely on the true life of Lise Villameur/Lise de Baissac, who was one of the heroines of the SOE (Special Operations Executive). She was parachuted into France in September 1942 where she helped to set up a safe house in Poitiers. Her older brother Claude had first joined the SOE, and she had followed once they had admitted women.

The movie is based around an apparently fictional story of the coerced recruiting of female resistance fighters, the rescue of a scientist, and then the attempted murder of a German colonel. Sophie Marceau portrays Lise's character in the movie. In real life Lise had lived on a busy street near the Gestapo HQ, and had became acquainted with the Gestapo chief, Herr Grabowski. She had no radio and would have to transfer intelligence by traveling to Paris, or Bordeaux, where her brother, Claude, was developing the Scientist network.

The movie, directed by Jean-Paul Salome (Arsene Lupin), is a well made and suspenseful drama that sheds some light on a little known side of the resistance in France.",1257984000,18,1081,4.869565217391305
3466960,2,B001ASPZ24,"While French title Les Femmes de l'Ombre may aspire to Jean-Pierre Melville, English translation Female Agents is closer to the mark, though this surprisingly well reviewed but increasingly hokey story of a quintet of French SOE agents in occupied France might have been more accurately called Ou Babes Audace. Its group of poorly defined stereotypes led by Sophie Marceau at her most coldly unlikeable are sent to rescue a British geologist on whom the success of D-Day depends from a German army hospital in Normandy, which they manage with unlikely ease with a couple of nurses outfits, a striptease show and a lot of unlikely machinegun fire and explosions, but it turns out the gals have been misled by Marceau's estranged brother and superior in the SOE Julien Boisselier. They're also expected to assassinate a German SS officer with a severe case of vertigo (the Hitchcock kind - he's searching for a double of the French girl who jilted him at the altar and ran off to England), and wouldn't you know it, team member Marie Gillain isn't just a dead ringer for her, she actually is his ex. From then on, what had been a fairly handsomely mounted, efficient but not terribly exciting potboiler becomes an increasingly absurd mess of increasingly moronic and unconvincing contrivance and coincidence-prone hokum that loses most of its relation to reality and sheds IQ points by the reel. Naturally, the girls keep on fudging their mission for no other reason than to kill off another member of the team until it has become so nonsensical that it's threatening to outstay what little welcome it has left.

There's not much room for characterisation until the last third, which is leaving it a bit late for us to care about anyone. Moreau is at her most determinedly disagreeable, something the script does at least briefly try to address by having one character note that ""Pity isn't your strong point. Try to be a little bit human for once."" Unfortunately when she does it simply shows up her limitations, putting you in mind more of Frasier Crane's ex-wife Lilith than the likes of Odette Sanson or Violette Szabo, though she has more to work with than the clichd dilemmas facing the other characters. Will the one-time collaborator sleep with her ex or kill him? Will cynical death row whore Julie Depardieu discover idealism? Will the nice Catholic girl Deborah Francois commit suicide to avoid torture? Will a CGi-resurrected Anton Diffring and Ferdy Mayne turn up for old clichs sake? These people simply act like they're in an old war movie rather than real people, going through scenes designed as would-be movie setpieces rather than convincing or involving drama. Small wonder that Moritz Bleibtrau's German villain is the closest the film has to a convincing character: he at least behaves as if he belongs in the time and place more often than not.

There's some cynicism thrown in along the way to try to make it all seem less clichd - it's the De Gaullist in the group who cracks instantly under the threat of torture and betrays them while a black marketeer is neatly derided: ""Start with the Germans, end the war with the Brits. How French can you get?"" But at times it feels more cynical itself, with just enough tits and Tommy guns to help sell a few more tickets - director Jean-Paul Salom even makes sure that one girl is given a gratuitous full frontal nude suicide scene. When a final caption informing us that 'this film is dedicated to the women who fought against Nazi barbarity' comes up you almost expect the words 'and got their tits out doing it' to appear. Not too many pluses - the action scenes aren't very convincing, though a scene on the Metro almost works despite its unlikeliness - but at least Maya Sansa makes an impression in the film's most underwritten role. The 2-disc edition of the UK PAL DVD includes Deborah Francois' semi-improvised audition scene that hints at a more interesting film that could have been made if co-writer-director Salom had been more interested in exploring the characters, but the film he ended up making is at best overlong hokum.",1255219200,21,4105,4.821276595744681
3466961,2,B001ASPZ24,"This movie ran smoothly and sillily for its entire length. While mildly entertaining the storyline was so silly it was close too humorous - but even there it left no mark.

In many ways it reminded me of Valiant (the Animated Movie), both seem to be set with a single premise - eg. Women fought in WW2 or Animals played their part in WW2 etc. Then both are extremely poorly handled.

The merits of this film are that there is enough going on for it to entertain (mildly) and serveral actresses are pretty to look at - Sophie Marceau is very elegant and there is detail in period settings. For this it gets 2 stars.

The plot is entirely fiction and silly to boot.

Not recommended.",1254268800,4,681,4.380952380952381
3466962,5,B001ASPZ24,"I loved this film. It comes with a bonus disc...the making of the film etc.
Based on a true event. Historical accuracy could be questioned but that is not that important to me. It kept my attention from start to finish.
Purchased from Amazon UK. Very well priced.
There are a number of very well priced DVD's from Amazon UK that are not available here..ie foreign films. ie Inimate Enemies (FR) Do a calculation (Google) from Pounds to Euro to CDN or US. Delivery was about a week. Used VISA.  No customs duties. Approx $14 CDN.
I had to make a backup copy to play on NSTC. Uk is PAL version.

3466963,5,B001ASPZ24,"This is a great adventure/action film set in World War II.  With the nudity, however, you will not want to watch it with your family.",1232064000,8,133,4.32
3466974,4,B001ASPZ24,"Ok, so this isn't the best plot or most realistic war movie ever made.  The production quality is more ""tv-series"" level, with a thin plot and leaps of faith.  It seemed quite amazing that each of the women chosen for this dangerous heroic commando mission happened to be so very good looking.

But, why 4 stars then?  I really enjoyed watching this movie.  The actors took there roles quite seriously, and were compelling.  It's a great story.  Most importantly, I woke up still thinking about the movie in a ""moved"" way the next morning, and that tells me that this movie was worth my time and I'm glad I saw it.",1445904000,2,614,4.4774774774774775

3466976,3,B001ASPZ24,"Appreciative of French films, I approached viewing this film with some enthusiasm. In the event I was, however, disappointed. Despite all its glowing reviews, this had the feeling of a made-for-TV film or even a TV mini-series. Reviews I read had me preparing myself for something very grim and gritty. In  the event those scenes of nudity and torture, which I  had braced myself for, were considerably more sanitised and far more soft-edged than I would normally expect from a product of the French cinema. While the acting was quite good, I felt the cast were handicapped by an increasingly weak script which didn't exploit the potential of the basic story and was something of a mess. A film which could and should have been vastly better.",1441670400,,742,4.834645669291339
3466977,5,B001ASPZ24,"Great WWII movie, with brave and fragile French women who risked everything to save their country and the world from the Nazis.  Based on true events.  Great acting, dialogue, script, can't say enough.  Subtitled (English subtitles with French audio).  It's worth reading the subtitles and I belive you'll be glad you did.

3466982,5,B001ASPZ24,"I really enjoyed the completeness of this film. I never expected Sophie Marceau to tackle the type of film, but she surprised me. The roles acted by the actors hold true to past and soon to occur entanglements. I intend to watch this one or more times to really get into the nuances of the many sub-plots.

You forget the movie is subtitled because you can't take your eyes off it for a minute.  You almost begin to think that you are understanding French and German.  Action packed, great acting and effects.  This is a sleeper that should be known world wide instead of most of the crap coming out of Hollywood today.  I'm going to say nothing more....you're just going to have to watch it.",1418860800,4,501,4.391304347826087
3466998,3,B001ASPZ24,"Marceau is good in this movie.  Overall Ok, kind of interesting but got unrealistic towards the end.  People tortured to within an inch of their lives walking around and looking good less than 24 hours later.  A German assassination target standing alone where he can easily be picked off.  One treat is Volker Bruch is in this movie.  He had a minor role in this movie unfortunately.  He played one of the lead characters in Generation War which I highly recommend if you like European movies (Generation War is a mini series).",1418601600,,528,4.684782608695652
