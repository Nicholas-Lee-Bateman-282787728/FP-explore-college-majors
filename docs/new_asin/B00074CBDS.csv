2200545,4,B00074CBDS,"David DeCouteau has a devoted cult following and this film is an excellent example of his work.  I believe this film started out as one of the BROTHERHOOD series but for some reason has been released without that affiliation.  It certainly follows the winning BROTHERHOOD formula (except there is no lightening in this film - come to think of it, there has been none of his trademark lightening effects in any of his films since LEECHES).  At any rate, RING OF DARKNESS has a great cast, headed by Adrienne Barbeau.  Jeff Peterson (from DeCouteaus's ANCIENT EVIL and PRISON OF THE DEAD) turns up as Jonah, first victim of the evil boy band Take10.  Josh Hammond (from BROTHERHOOD) also puts in an appearance as a not so talented boy band wannabe.  Also watch for cameos from Mink Stole.  The only disapointment in the film comes from Ryan Star who mumbles her lines and has surprisingly little screen presence.  The film has all the visual flare that fans have come to expect from a DeCouteau film, beautiful cinematography, locations shots, fast editing and beautiful people.  I am always amazed at what he is able to accomplish on such tight budgets.  This is perhaps his best work since THE FRIGHTENING.  I really enjoyed it for what it is - a fun, low-budjet, goofy little horror film.",1112832000,4,1289,4.73542600896861
2200546,3,B00074CBDS,"I only bought this movie because Ryan Starr was in it, and I am a fan of hers. But she should stick to singing, she is good at that, cheak out My Religion on itunes (her single) But honestly my friends warned me about this movie because of its director, and they were right, but oh well. I wouldnt buy this movie, but if your're a Ryan Starr fan watch it(her acting skills are no match for her singing skills however)",1111622400,,417,4.160493827160494
2200547,1,B00074CBDS,"One star is being generous, this is probably the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad ones. I like B horror movies but this was WAY below that. It actually played out more like a gay porno movie than anything else with the blood ritual in black briefs? IF the movie were going for $4.99 I'd consider sending it to my cousin as a joke who loves zombie movies. But these weren't even zombies, they had grey makeup and looked kind of like the guys from V, the old movie/TV Show, but they didn't even have scales! It was just grey makeup! Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk, away from this film! Cooking with Porn stars was a better buy than this would be, and that movie was REALLY bad. I don't know who thought to sell it for $24, discounted to $22, but if they sell one at that price, it should just about cover the budget for the film with those ""special"" effects of the burnt zombies which were really piles of sand from down the beach on the same set.",1111363200,,980,4.163157894736842
2200548,2,B00074CBDS,"Where to begin with yet another David DeCoteau homoerotic piece of junk.  Oh I guess it will appeal to some men and women who like seeing pretty boys in their undies dancing and singing poorly.  Take Ten (why 10 since there are only 5 members) is a boy band modeled after N-Sync or the Backstreet Boys.  Thier singer dies of a drug overdose and the band has to find a new front man.  The truth is that their lead singer Gordo found out the ""sinister"" truth about the band and threatens to tell and is killed.

The band is managed by Alex played by Adrienne Barbeau who has proven she can still act by her performances in ""Carnivale"" and yet continues to do these cheap less than B grade horrors.  Three possible new candidates are taken to the mysterious island where the band lives and two are promptly done aways with leaving Shawn (Coltin Scott) who is joined by his girlfriend Stacy, played by American Idol's Ryan Starr.  Alex takes a liking to Shawn and he is soon sent off to a bizarre initiation as the group's new member leaving Stacy to have to rescue him.

The premise itself isn't so terribly bad and it's always fun to see ""boy band"" types get their come-uppance.  But this is just executed so poorly from a bad script to terrible performances except for Barbeau who is at least a pro.  And who decided to put Starr into a film in the first place?  As an actor she makes a great singer and she should stick to that.",1110412800,3,1428,4.350943396226415
2200549,3,B00074CBDS,"I've heard much about David DeCoteau's campy horror flicks over the years but this is the first one I've actually seen.  Three stars might seem generous but I'm rating it for what it is, not comparing it to ""Citizen Kane"" here.

Where to begin...if you enjoy looking at hunky young guys, I recommend you suspend your disbelief, check your brains at the door and enjoy yourself.  The storyline cashes in on the waning popularity of boy bands and the booming business of reality TV - A singing group, comprised of four male zombie hotties, is forced to kill their fifth (and sole human) member, the lead singer, a Justin Timberlake type, when he threatens to go public with their secret.  Once they've dispatched him, the search is on for his replacement.  Adrienne Barbeau, phoning it in as the group's manager, hosts the three finalists during their ""audition"" show down, American Idol/Survivor-style, at a remote island retreat.

The film looks like it was made with a fairly sizeable budget compared to a lot of C-grade horror flicks; it's well shot & stars Barbeau as well as real-life American Idol finalist Ryan Starr (who turns in a forgettable, wooden performance).  Even still, there are many odd, inexplicable elements - such as all the singers voices sounding EXACTLY like the original recording of the band's big hit during their open auditions (because the filmmakers were too cheap to re-record the vocal track for each actor so they all merely lip-synch to the same vocal track).  And one of the band members, who eerily resembles Eminem, being a racist who refers to the lone black finalist as an ""African American.""  How many racists do you know who refer to blacks as African Americans?  A little too obviously PC.

But other than a few glitches, this movie is a real hoot.  DeCoteau is famous for slipping double entendres into supposedly mainstream films as a wink to his gay audience and ""Ring of Darkness"" is no exception.  This actually makes the film more entertaining than if it was overtly gay.  A secret blood ritual in the middle of the night performed by four hard bodies wearing nothing but tight black briefs?  A bedroom scene featuring a bodacious Swedish groupie promising to ""share"" one of the hot male finalists with the other four group members?  Hints of a sapphic liaison between Adrienne and Ryan?  Horror has never been more outrageously kinky than this.

Last but not least, a surprisingly affecting performance by Stephen Martine, the male lead, is merely icing on this sickeningly sweet cake. If you're looking for a night of mindless good fun, definitely check this one out.",1109030400,17,2617,4.8690744920993225
2200560,1,B00074CBDS,"Ring of Darkness (David DeCoteau, 2004)

Former porn director David DeCoteau, whose most notable mainstream flicks have been the Puppet Master franchise (he directed 3, 4, and 5, the last two under assumed names), takes an absolutely brilliant idea and makes an incredibly stupid movie out of it. Now, to be somewhat fair, not only is it a made-for-TV shlockfest, but one that certainly didn't have the budget of a Danielle Steel miniseries (IMDB estimates the film's budget at three-quarters of a million dollars). Still, it would be hard for this movie to be worse than it actually turned out; about the only thing that saves it is its premise and the fact that DeCoteau took nothing seriously.

We open with Gordo (Club Dread's Greg Cipes) fleeing from a mansion. Just as he gets to the beach and seems as if he's going to get away, he's cornered by four dark shapes. Cut to an announcement that boy band Take Ten are auditioning for a new lead singer. (I'm sure you can draw the proper conclusion.) After a round of auditions, during which you're liable to get as sick of the catchy little tune they play just as much as you did any nineties boy band hit, the four remaining members of the band choose three possible replacements for Gordo-- Shawn (Guiding Light actor Coltin Scott), Jonah (DeCoteau staple Jeff Peterson), and Xavier (Baywatch's Jeremy Jackson), who are all flown, with Xavier's girlfriend Stacy (American Idol finalist Ryan Starr, whom you will be pleased to know does not sing at any point in the film), to the band's island mansion. Which, of course, looks very familiar. As the three continue the auditions in a slightly more stressful situation, weird things start happening...

With all the young-and-beautiful male skin on display, you're likely to think you're watching a Victor Salva flick. However, comparisons with the superior Salva end there; DeCoteau directs as if Ring of Darkness (the title, by the way, has absolutely nothing to do with the movie itself) were his first film, not his fifty-second. I haven't seen this much obvious shot repetition in a movie since Night of the Lepus. The acting is atrocious, as one would expect from folks who cut their teeth in T&A-fests (the two notable exceptions to this are Adrienne Barbeau, who plays the band's manager, and Coltin Scott), the script is bad even for a horror-flick parody, and the whole thing is just on the right side of unwatchable to keep you glued to the screen.

Or maybe you just want to watch a boy band get theirs. I know that was my motivation. *",1126483200,11,2550,4.762443438914027
2200561,2,B00074CBDS,"If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect:  a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs.  In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality.  Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly.  By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending.  DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods.",1124323200,,910,4.921568627450981
2200562,1,B00074CBDS,"Those of you who remember Ryan Starr from American Idol know why she quickly became ""has been"" material for VH1's the Surreal Life. Ryan Starr also happens to be the worst actress I have ever watched on film, television and or commercials.  The director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time.  Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling, expression & emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails.  That is all I can say, I would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again.",1122595200,2,748,4.405797101449275
2200563,1,B00074CBDS,"THIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST, SILLY, TOTALLY MISDIRECTED MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED ""DISASTERS IN NATURE MOVIES"". I WAS NOT DISAPOINTED. THIS WAS TRULY A HORRIFIC CATASTROPHE. THE BEST PART  OF THE MOVIE WAS.....WAS..... WAS.....I AM GETTING THERE..............  THE STORY HAD NO MEANING. ADRIENNE BARBEAU SHOULD SELL RAFFLE TICKETS THE NEXT TIME SHE NEEDS MONEY. HER TALENTS WERE TOTALLY WASTED. HERS WAS THE ONLY TALENTS BEING WASTED; NO ONE ELSE IN THE MOVIE HAD ANY.  THIS DVD ALSO WILL DO NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, AS IT IS GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE. IF RYAN STARR WANTS AN OSCAR SHE'D BETTER START BY ASKING HIM OUT ON A DATE, BECAUSE JULIA ROBERTS AND HALLE BERRY HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTIME SOON. SHE DOES HAVE POTENTIAL THOUGH. THERE WAS NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THE BAND MEMBERS. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

2200564,1,B00074CBDS,"I think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies (it is right up there with movies like ""half-caste""). This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably. It will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork. Oh and did I mention it was bad?",1117324800,,862,4.262195121951219

2200566,2,B00074CBDS,"PLOT: When the hottest boy band in the country is looking for a new lead singer, a national contest is held. One of the top three picks, Shawn, is a rebellious rock star who hates boy bands and is only in the completion because his girlfriend, Stacy (Ryan Starr from American Idol) pushes him into it. Stacy, Shawn, and the other two finalists are taken to the bands remote island where they are tested to see who will win. However, it becomes apparent that not all is as it seems to be and this boy band has a dark side.

UPS and DOWNS: The ups are that this movie is hilarious. The idea of boy bands being sinister is nothing new, just get one of Backstreet's songs stuck in your head and you'll be thinking they must report directly to Satan. Another up is that most of the actors seem to have been chosen on looks alone, so they're easy to look at. The downs are that because they were chosen based just on looks, the acting is terrible. The best actor/actress in the movie is Adrienne Barbeau, the rest are terrible. The `plot' has more holes than Swiss cheese.

Over all, if you're looking for a good laugh, especially if pop music ISN'T your thing, this is a fun movie.",1115510400,7,1176,4.316742081447964
2200567,3,B00074CBDS,"""Ring of Darkness"" shows how an ambitious musician and a supernatural boy-band use each other to advance their art.

Lead singer Gordo (played by Greg Cipes) attempts to desert the band Take Ten but is overpowered on a beach.  The band members (played by Jeremy Jackson, John Wynn, Colin Bain, and Matthew Thomas Baker) and its manager (played by Adrienne Barbeau) announce that, since Gordo just went into rehab, there will be auditions for a new lead singer.  Shawn Walker (played by Stephen Martines) believes himself above boy-bands, but girlfriend Stacy (played by Ryan Starr) pushes him into auditioning.  Shawn, Max (played by Eric Dearborn), and Jonah (played by Jeff Peterson) make the cut and are invited to the band's private island in the Pacific.  Shawn brings along Stacy.

On the island, curious individuals have a way of disappearing.  There are frequent shirtless scenes, strange rituals, two groupies, old magazine collections, and mysterious phone calls to an off-island character played by Mink Stole.  The try-out field shrinks down.  The last candidate has to figure out the most useful relationship possible with the band.

The photography and settings are good.  The direction moves the story along.  Some of the make-up special effects are too flimsy to be convincing.  The acting is a bit wooden and un-erotic, although I enjoyed Jeff Peterson (""Prison of the Dead"" and ""Ancient Evil"") and Stephen Martines as try-outs and Josh Hammond (""Alien Arsenal"", ""The Brotherhood"", and ""Jeepers Creepers 2"") as an unsucessful competitor.

There are no extra features other than the film's trailer and three other previews.",1115510400,,1639,5.2298850574712645
2200568,2,B00074CBDS,"Director David DeCoteau hits it big with this one, casting three ""stars"" to his usual unknown cast: Maude's Adrienne Barbeau, Baywatch's Jeremy Jackson, and American Idol's Ryan Starr. But try as they might, they all sink low in this supernatural, sci-fi, horror, comedy, whatever-you-want-to-call-it mess of a film.  Let just say that the premise looks interesting.  After the lead singer of a boy band supposedly enters rehab, it's up to the rest of the group to find a new front man.  Comes Shawn (Coltin Scott) who against his better judgment (for a guy who despises boy bands he sure fits the mold) auditions and gets picked among two others for the final spot showdown where only one will live up to the challenge.  Technically, RING OF DARKNESS impresses.  For a low-budgeter it sure doesn't look like one.  DeCoteau has a pro eye, despite his bad script, bad actors, bad FX...  His reputation as a lover of kitsch cinema (and of male forms) still holds out, but his execution is sleek looking.  Imagine what he could do if he had a real project in his hands. Like any boy band RING OF DARKNESS may look the part but, in the end, it's talent that counts.  Too bad DeCoteau is the only one who has some. -----Martin Boucher",1114992000,,1229,4.652777777777778
