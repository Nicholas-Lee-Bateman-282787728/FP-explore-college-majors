697922,4,6303553761,"This film is a great example of a B-movie. That does not mean it is a bad movie. Anna-Nicole Smith does a good job, the storyline is solid (better than some mainstream films) and action is done well considering budget. In a lot of ways, this is a movie you might see on SciFi with the addition of some nudity.
The film centers around Anna-Nicole's character, and it has merit. What makes it a little hard to watch at times is the bad acting of some of the others.
Overall, this is a solid film, worthy of watching and for the Anna-Nicole fans a must own for the collection, even more so now with her passing. This movie along with her other major film credit (Skyscraper) show off the fact that had she been given the support and opportunity, she had a shot at becoming a Hollywood starlet.",1211846400,4,790,4.344594594594595
697923,5,6303553761,"Whilst ""Skyscraper"" (1995) proved that Smith could effortlessly carry a big budget action film with enormous star presence and charisma, in ""To the Limit"" (1994) she impresses with her range as an actress. As undercover agent ""Collette"", Smith goes deep undercover, infiltrating two different sides in a bloody war for an enigmatic compact disc holding sensitive state secrets. Balancing a range of aliases is no easy task in this fast moving film, but Smith achieves it effortlessly. Whilst the film itself is overambitious at times, Smith's presence makes for highly satisfying viewing.",1178496000,4,588,5.4021739130434785
697924,2,6303553761,"To be perfectly honest, I bought this movie because I expected it to be horrifically bad. You know, bad acting, bad dialog, bad plot? The whole works. For the most part it succeeded in all of these areas, but it's missing something from making it the camp classic it could be. I watched it once, laughed hysterically when Anna Nicole started screaming about making babies or something, but barely chuckled through the rest of it. I'll probably watch it again while having a six pack or something just to see if I missed anything, but so far the camp value is minimal at best. Maybe this is a B rate B movie?",1174348800,3,607,4.428571428571429
697925,1,6303553761,"Dare I need tell you how greatly this softcore, action thriller sucks?  Ok.  You might think there are two reasons (besides those two) to rent this: Nudity and Hilariously bad acting.  Well, there is nudity, but not as much as you think.  If you're getting it for Anna's naked flesh, be prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button.  She's nude, don't get me wrong, in the shower, in the bed, etc., but after that first scene, she is clothed and trying to act for a loooong time before the next scene.  Her ""acting"" is probably good if you compare to how she acts on her TV show.  she at least doesn't seem stoned. There is a plot that involves...just kidding, I have no idea!  There are some actual actors and a Travolta sibling playing your typical mobsters found in these movies.  The movie only still exists because of Anna being naked in it and there is nowhere near enough of it to make ""To the Limit"" more than a free rental, if that. I should mention that this is a review for the R rated version.  I don't know if there is an unrated version, but it would have to be better than this.  For more nudity, bad acting, and a less coherent Anna, go rent ""Skyscraper"".",1070755200,17,1187,4.35

I actually watched it (well, almost finished...the 2nd Anna Nicole Smith shower scene was enough) because I knew it was going to be bad, but man this one just landed in the top 5 of all-time bad movies on AMAZON.

698007,5,6303553761,"TO THE LIMIT (1995) opens like any other action / thriller film. Within 3 minutes, a dummy is thrown from a helicopter, which explodes soon after!  Music booms, as beautiful females remove their clothing. Next, it's Anna Nicole Smith taking a nice bath, which, as we can plainly see, is quite an erotic event for her! Woosh! Now she's in bed w/ whats-his-name! Why does she even bother putting clothes on? Man! Ms. Smith certainly was a free spirit! Alright, um, oh yeah, somebody gets married, yadda-yadda-yadda. Oh no! Assassins show up at the wedding! Without invitations! Slow-motion mega-death ensues! BANG! BANG!! KA-BOOM!!! Everybody's dead, including whats-his-name, and Anna Nicole has strawberry jelly on her forehead! Meanwhile, a bald, tattooed maniac simply must take off the top of his lovely female captive! It's in the eeevil bad guy handbook! His lair is dark, except for a hanging ceiling light that is set on ""eternal rocking"" mode. More shooting, and this time... karate! More explosions too! Action Anna! She's a firearms expert, and martial arts hundredth degree black belt! Assassins attack! Anna Nicole kills them all! I forgot to mention her expertise in explosives. Oh, and she's a master of disguise as well! Her dark-hair wig makes her look like a completely different Anna Nicole Smith! Other stuff happens involving cops and mob types, but who really cares? The only reason to watch this cluster-fudge, is to witness the heavenly juggernaut of mush, that is its star. I mean megastar! Calling this movie ""absurd"" is like calling Kim Jung Un ""wacky""! However, as a sort of dream-like, alternate-reality experience caught on film, it's a masterwork! Anna Nicole Smith is brilliant! She speaks her lines as naturally as any cyborg, and her acting skills are unmatched by any, but the most finely tuned cheeeze-logs! Still, when she's bouncing across the screen, it's impossible to turn away! We know we are in the presence of some magnificent wonderfulness, and simply must tell others... P.S.- Anna Nicole REALLY loves a nice shower as well! REALLY!!...",1504569600,7,2081,5.102639296187683

698015,2,6303553761,"I had previously assumed that ""Skyscraper"" had to be the worst Anna Nicole Smith movie ever made, but ""To The Limit"" is a strong contender in every way. In this one Anna plays Colette, a CIA agent who loses her shady art-dealer husband to a mysterious explosion while simultaneously across town mobsters Frank DaVinci (Joey Travolta) and Lupe are getting married. After seeing some hilarious composite footage of a helicopter being shot down by a sociopath, numerous ninjas dressed in black with ski masks and machine guns invade the DaVinci wedding, which quickly devolves into a shooting gallery. Lupe is killed, but Frank rallies back to life while we meet the crooked crew. They all have names like Joey and Philly Bambino, and really needed a dialogue coach or a trip to Italy to master their accents. Since this makes so much sense so far, the first curve ball (yawn) involves Frank being an agent during the Vietnam war when he was sent to Hanoi to assassinate General Tang. (""You remember that last black ops we had in Hanoi?"") Ignoring the ludicrous impossibilities of that as a premise, it serves to tie the whole movie together in a way I can only guess at, while padding the running time immensely.

Colette invades Las Vegas and immediately has a shootout, steals a police car, and runs it into a helicopter (don't ask), defeating ninjas and local law enforcement officials alike. Despite numerous plot detours (the petulant runaway teenage girl, a killer nurse, the worst Las Vegas review in history, Philly Bambino's serial infidelity, Colette taking a shower, etc.) the main characters finally rendezvous in Frank's hotel room. There Colette reveals that she is a CIA operative (yeah, that's plausible), but while she says ""I was proud to work for my company"" (groan), she fell for a mobster, and went rogue. At least that's what I think was going on: between her diction and an incoherent script, it's a bit hard to tell what's happening with any degree of precision. She says she's been hiding out ""up in the mountains"" and that a CIA boss named Arthur Jameson (creepy, tattooed Jack Bannon) is the man who killed Lupe and tried to kill Frank. The raw emotion she displays when this is revealed must be seen to be believed!

This whole thing boils down to a CD-ROM that Jameson wants, as it contains information that can indict him, and which a mysterious man named China (Michael Nouri) furnishes to Frank, getting blown up in the process (don't miss the riveting monologue about playing gin rummy with Jimmy Hoffa). China advises Frank to go to the FBI, because they hate the CIA more than they hate organized crime, and with that established Colette has to jump back in the shower. Of course Frank and Colette fall for each other in a truly loathsome display. Travolta, the old goat, doublecrosses Colette and takes the disc in the middle of the night, and Colette calls Jameson in a fit of pique. After Philly Bambino gets a well-deserved Thai gasoline massage (I am not joking), a showdown is arranged between the CIA and the mob. Question: why does nobody think to burn a copy of the CD? Wouldn't that make it less worth dying for?

There is a plot twist at the end that is not totally unsurprising, so for that it gets originality points over ""Skyscraper,"" but it's just a ruse to initiate more gunplay. Just when you suspected the film could get no stupider, you will be proven wrong in a massive way: there's a hostage exchange to perform on the Hoover Dam! The swap is simple: the CD for a mobster. (Again, people, burn a copy of the CD! Hello?) The scene which follows is entirely responsible for my two star rating of this film, as in most other ways it's inferior to even ""Skyscraper."" The scene that sealed the deal for me was the hostage exchange, specifically, when Frank hands Colette the CD and she hurls it like a throwing star, embedding it deep in Jameson's skull, causing him to fall over Hoover Dam to his death. That is a priceless moment of cinematic cheese, and my only regret is that to get to it you have to suffer through 89 minutes of truly lamentable filmmaking first.",1267056000,5,4117,4.683701657458563
