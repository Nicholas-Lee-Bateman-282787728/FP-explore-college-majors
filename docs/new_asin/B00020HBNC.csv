8019588,5,B00020HBNC,"Miaka Yuki is a normal teenager in Japan studying for her high school exams. Little more is in her life other than her two loves: her best friend Yui and food. One day after school, Miaka accompanies Yui to the National Library. In the library, Miaka encounters a vision of a flaming red bird that leads her to a book called the Universe of the Four Gods.

As the girls begin to read, they are pulled into the pages into the world of the book. They are met by Tamahome, a young man with incredible skills as a warrior. But Yui is pulled away from the book and returns to the real world, leaving Miaka alone.

Miaka suspects Tamahome of kidnapping, so she follows him to the city capital of Konan. There, Miaka is chosen to be the Priestess of Suzaku and learns that she will be given the power to make wishes. Miaka's one true wish is to return home and pass her entrance exams, but finds that she has fallen in love.

This first volume of the series Fushigi Yugi by Yu Watase inclues the first seven episodes.",1116720000,4,1010,4.3052631578947365
8019589,5,B00020HBNC,"Fushigi Yugi is just about my favorite anime of all time. The animation is wonderful, Watase Yu, is an amazing artist, and the stories are so real I either laugh or cry! I am very pleased that they came out with the individual dvds because getting the box set at one time is pretty costly. This story is fantasy, drama, and romance!

This dvd has 7 episodes, just about the most I have seen on one anime dvd and it's well worth $30. Here we learn about the 15-year-old girl Miaka Yuki. Miaka and her best friend Yui travel to the national library and Miaka sees a red bird. The two girls are puzzeled and found and old ancient chinese book called The Universe of the Four gods. Suddenly a red light swarms them into the book and oddly enough they find themselves in acient China. Right when they arrived they were attacked by slave traders and a 17-year-old boy named Tamahome rescued them. Over the 7 episodes, Miaka Yuki finds herself in Conan and assumes the duty of the Preistess of Suzaku. She has to go through terrible ordeals and she must find the Seven Stars of Suzaku so she can make all of her dreams come true. Miaka finds near death, love, and regret. She has formed a strong bond with her warriors and begins to weaken. Buy this dvd to find out what happens!

Fushigi Yugi is two seasons long with four dvds each. Also there are OVAS that add even more drama to the story. It is a must buy and should be an addition to your anime collection.",1105488000,7,1455,4.326007326007326
