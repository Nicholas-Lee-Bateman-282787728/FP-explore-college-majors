8510008,4,B0074JOUN8,"I've been looking for some of these British 60's teen musicals for many years - glad that they're finally available on DVD!

Gives a good insight into the British pop of the pre-Beatles era, with artists such as Mark Wynter, Joe Brown, Jet Harris, Tony Meehan, Kenny Lynch, the Vernon Girls, Clodagh Rodgers, Louise Cordet, the Tornadoes (with Burt Heinz on guitar), Sounds Incorporated, Karl Denver,  etc.  Also features the top DJ's of the era - Alan Freeman (who narrates this movie), David Jacobs, Jimmy Saville.  The male teens wear cool Mod suits and Mark Wynter even wears a Beatle-style collarless jacket!

Some of the characters from ""A Hard Day's Night"" - the stuffy old man on the train, the tall blond guy who dances with Ringo in the nightclub scene - play a prominent role in this movie.  You can even spot John ""Mitch"" Mitchell - drummer for the Jimi Hendrix Experience - as a member of the teen audience near the end of the film.  Yes, he started out as a child/teen actor - he's also in the 1963 British movie ""Live It Up"" with another child star turned rock-and-roller, Steve Marriott (from the Small Faces and Humble Pie).  .  .",1379203200,,1147,4.610837438423645
