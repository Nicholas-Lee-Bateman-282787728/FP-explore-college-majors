8271063,3,B0018T3PDQ,"Haven't gone right through the course but the resource CD with the charts etc.. will not play/open in a number of PCs that I have tried it in. The idea is great and what is provided sounds useful, just disappointed I can't access the resources.
Supplier have sent me a zip file of what is on the resource CD.",1339200000,,308,4.237288135593221
8271064,5,B0018T3PDQ,I teach high school students how to use PA and recording systems and I've found this DVD fantastic for giving an overview of how to setup and work with live PA systems.  It is super-cheesy (painfully so) but if you can get past that you'll find that all the information is gold - and very clearly presented.,1334793600,,307,4.385964912280702
8271065,5,B0018T3PDQ,"Yeah, it's the basics. A good little resource to give to noobs who are about to be thrown into the world of pro audio. Very corny but sometimes the ""corn"" can make certain facts memorable. At the very least this video will generate questions that may spur the wannabe sound person to read and dig to learn more detail. It gets them thinking in the right direction.

This is a solid overview DVD with some practical advice to help you get on your way.
If you already have general idea of how things work you may still learn a thing or two but may be bored with an overall lack of depth on any one topic.

One possible oversight (at least I do not recall hearing it) is that viewers really should be encouraged to track down the owner's manuals for their specific equipment if at all possible. I say this because the mixer section, while very good at introducing overall use and fucntion, is also very generic. It could get confusing since features and set-ups vary. There is no substitute for knowing your gear.

On the plus side, the use of a generic mixer keeps the lesson from getting confusing by not showing us a board with a lot of features and configurations that may be unique to a particular brand or model. On the board in our church all the channel strips are NOT the same and the master section is pretty unique too. I suppose walking through very many potential variations would have been beyond the scope of and purpose of a ""basics"" DVD.

Video was pretty much what I expected and do not regret purchasing it as a tool to get into the hands of those who want or need to tackle running the sound at church. I view it as the bare minimum knowledge required for anyone who wishes to turn the knobs and push the buttons.",1325980800,,1730,4.363354037267081
8271066,4,B0018T3PDQ,This is a good tool for the beginner with little understanding of mixing boards and sound.,1284854400,,90,4.6875
