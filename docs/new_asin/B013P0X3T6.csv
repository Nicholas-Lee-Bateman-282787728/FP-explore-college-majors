The many action adventure scenes are spot on and flawless. The animation is so detailed that it is just mind-blowing.
At first I thought the film was just for little boys but after watching it, I think that little girls will love it too. The animals and the girl wizard will definitely be some kids favorites. The wizard is cute and, since she is still learning, this leads to many mistakes and funny moments. The story line includes a treasure hunt and a mystery which will capture your attention. The two story lines flow together into a fun, family-friendly, animation adventure.
The movie has great relationships between father and son. You can see all the similar qualities they share, both good and bad. The voice actors are quite wonderful and the emotions between the characters really come across. The characters show what true friends really do for each other.
The characters are adorable and the voice over work matches well with the individual characters. They are all cute and quirky. My favorites are the dragons which are surprisingly kind, not your usual breed of fire breathing beasts that want to eat or barbeque you.
The villains have a beast of their own which terrifies them. I really wanted to like them because they are funny and made me laugh. However, they are not nice and think that everything is theirs.
Mike the Knight: Mikes Bravest Mission teaches us to never give up. If you try and fail maybe you should look at the problem another way and try something different. No matter what, you should always keep trying and eventually it will all work out.
This new DVD by N Circle Entertainment is perfect for kids ages 4 to 18. The colorful movie will keep little ones entertained and older kids will love the story line.
I give this movie 4.5 out of 5 Dragons.
