8731027,4,B014K1W3WW,Great information and well made . Left out the entire first break out attempt that was stopped by a snipers bullet though. General Pillows aide caught the bullet and rattled him when he had the best opportunity to escape Grant. This went completely forgotten. But there was  information about the battle I'd not known so I still recommend it,1501113600,,341,4.779661016949152
