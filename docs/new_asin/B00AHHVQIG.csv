8551616,4,B00AHHVQIG,"Shada is an episode that only real Whovians would tolerate - hence the four stars. It switches from animated to real throughout which is distracting but was the only thing they could do to restore it because of the disintegration of the old Doctor Who episodes and what they were filmed with at the time. Finally the BBC has begun to realize how many fans Doctor Who has world wide. This was my first time watching Tom Baker and I found that, like almost all of the doctors, I liked him and ordered the set (1 or 12 depending on who is counting), which is coming out in June. Shada itself is a very interesdting Who story with twists and turns, so it is worth having in any condition. That said, my first doctor was Matt Smith and I have watched many of his episodes more than once, so I am coming to Doctor Who very late. My favorite Doctor in the old television series is Jon Pertwee. I liked him from the moment he staggered out of the TARDIS in his first episode and have begun collecting all his work in Who. In the new series, David Tennant is my favorite - sorry Matt. If Christopher Eccleston had been my first Doctor, I would never have become a WHO fan, although I really liked Billie Piper (but she should stay away from Jane Austen until she understands the Austen era better). I finally began to like Peter Capaldi just as he was leaving the series, but he was bogged down with all the episodes of death and despair and the burden of being immortal. I think the writers got carried away with that and who needs all that darkness?? Who needs some cheer once in a while.?",1528588800,,1582,4.3120805369127515

8551618,5,B00AHHVQIG,"Shada is a great story for THE quintessential Doctor, Mr. Tom Baker. It's a shame it wasn't properly finished but most of it is intact here.
If it had been completed it may well have been the pinnacle of the Tom Baker era.
Masterful writing by sci-fi comedy author Douglas Adams. He makes The Doctor quite human in this story, really fun to be with and we get to spend time with two Time Lords here!
This is a very unique adventure for the fourth Doctor, maybe the best. It would have made an excellent cinematic film!
Beautiful locations, very picturesque.
Cambridge University is lovely.
I like Mr. Baker's visual narration for continuity, when needed. His segments look very good.
It's also great fun to see The Doctor zipping around on a bicycle! So natural like much of British culture.
All the discs in this collection are oddly interactive, you are asked to make choices before you watch (Audio Navigation) but if you wait long enough it will time out and go to a menu. Very useful for the vision impaired. Reminds me of Siri or maybe Alexa?

I assume because of extensive restoration this release is higher quality than all my other Who discs. None of them look or sound as well as this one (Stereo), even though the live video looks a bit like film here. I haven't seen Shada in NTSC Region 1 for comparison.
The Shada extras disc 2 is also excellent quality.
The other disc in this release, More Than 30 Years In The Tardis has  fascinating historical information. A very well done and worthwhile documentary. Informative and entertaining...a Doctor Who celebration for all the classic Doctors! Clips,interviews and much more...everything Who for 90 minutes.
Some of the video is fair in quality but very good overall.
Disc includes a decent number of extras.

This is an essential item for Who fans!

The best Doctor Who purchase I have made, an absolute gift for all enthusiasts.

Update: 2/16/18-

I now have a 4K television & multi region player, all of my Doctor Who and other region discs have very good to excellent audiovisual quality!
I find it unnecessary to ever replace them with Blurays, they are impressive examples of video restoration.
An amazing technological breakthrough, a New Era in home entertainment.",1489968000,,2233,4.772020725388601
