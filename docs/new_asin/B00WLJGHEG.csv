Money came up missing out of the church safe, they hired a private detective to figure out who stole the money. Lots of people had the means and motive to do so. However, in the end, all was forgiven.

Now, let me tell you about my feelings.

First, I have to say, I loved it! So very thankful that I was able to review it, although very late. We have had a really bad time since last October, first with my daughters hospitalization, to the twins being born early. One being very sick, and in the hospital for most of his six months on this earth.  Then some other stuff happened and life is just starting to round right again. We have had some very hard money issues as we were spending up to $200 a week in gas just to drive back and forth to Louisville. We are still very much struggling to pay the bills. At this point, I don't even know how I am going to pay my electric and water bill, let alone groceries. However, I know that God will provide, at the last moment.

It is slowing down, we are not spending as much in gas these weeks, AMEN! But it is catching up to us in a very large way.

I said all of that to say this, I can very much relate to the thief. This person really just wanted to help this other person ( trying to not give it away I promise). We all can use a little help here and there. The Grace of God film is so inspiring, so moving, I cried. Yall I just cried. It is not even sad. I just cried.
