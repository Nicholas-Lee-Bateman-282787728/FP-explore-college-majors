1219390,4,B00000IBRS,"I remember seeing this movie back in elementary school, and I still find it entertaining today.  As the synopsis above states, the plot revolves around a ""modern"" day space explorer who gets catapulted back to the days of King Arthur.  The comedy is derived from the strange predicaments in which Dugan finds himself (the old fish-out-of-water ploy).  The movie is one of Disney's better live-action comedies.  Since much of the comedy is of the zany, slapstick variety the movie has aged well, and is still humorous twenty years later.  The style of comedy is similar to what one finds in other Disney comedies such as the Love Bug.  My six year old loves it.  If you're a collector of Disney movies definitely add this one to your library.",972691200,9,741,4.7421875

I grew up with a lot of Disney offerings, so this movie, or its production style, is really nothing new.  It is a Disney children's film, so, like another reviewer stated, it means well, but it is hokey.  The premise is a very solid one, but the old Disney formula of using basic film making techniques to make the movie more digestible for a younger audience really shows here.  Lots of basic shots, little coverage, plot devices that, well, are kid friendly.  Being kid friendly they're pretty blase.

The shooting style, the acting, the story, all of it is geared towards a very young audience.  I'm not sure today's kids would be too patient with it.  Not for lack of sophistication, but the production values, particularly in the SFX department, are a little sub par.  Notably the miniatures for the space shots and the wire work for the live action flying sequences.

I remember seeing the adds for this film way back when, and I always wanted to see it out of curiosity, but not really because I was intrigued by what the film had to offer.  I was a sci-fi snob, and had Trek, monster films, 2001, and a host of others to satisfy my craving, so a Disney offering two of my favorite genres seemed like it might be a mixed plate.

Had I seen this when I was younger, then I think given my own personal ego at the time I might have left the theatre with a bad taste in my mouth, and this review might have been much different.  As it is now, viewing it in my middle age, it strikes me as the kind of film that I think older adults think kids might enjoy, and I think those same adults would be wrong.

A reshoot would be most interesting, particularly how the ""Playtime"" mag gag might be handled by new Disney studio heads and film makers.

An interesting watch all the same.  Again, like the other reviewer stated, it passes the time harmlessly.",1408752000,,1875,4.406976744186046
1219429,4,B00000IBRS,"I don't remember why i bought this movie.  I think I might have seen part of it on TV or was told about it.  Regardless it is a silly movie with a lot of dry humor, which is just my style.  I was able to enjoy it with my family.  And, remember... ""don't point it at anything you want to keep.""",1399939200,,293,3.7540983606557377
1219430,4,B00000IBRS,"Dennis Dugan [now a director] plays a likable guy that goes back in time with an identical android that
provides some comedy to this --- favorably-remembered --- Disney feature from the days before seam-
less CGI SFX. The director of this feature was a director during the time of I DREAMED OF JEANNIE,
and assembled a film that LOOKS more like a made-for-TV movie of the week.
The FX are not convincing, but the likability of the cast makes it an enjoyable film. If you are able to for-
get the technical impossibilities of launching a spaceshuttle --- without a booster rocket --- into Earth-orbit,
from medievel times, you might rate this 5 stars.

I enjoyed the film when I originally saw it in a theatre. Bought it when it came out on VHS, but this wide-
screen transfer --- though MONO --- is a great upgrade. Watch it with the eyes of a child, and you'll enjoy
it as well!

I recommend this for that inner-child in us all.",1387843200,3,929,4.458823529411765
1219431,3,B00000IBRS,"This is a spin on Mark Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court."" I had not seen this in many years, and it is not as well known as many other Disney family films from the 60's and 70's. I think there are several reasons why it sank into the background. I cannot say that the script was the best Disney had to offer, which is a shame, since an actor like Kenneth More, and even Jim Dale (Hot Lead, Cold Feet), could certainly rise to a great role. The main character (Tom Trimble) comes across ridiculous and tiresome, even for an ""oddity."" Likewise, the heroine is too flaky for comfort. I find myself skipping over them both to watch scenes with More and Le Mesurier, which are far more entertaining. I would say that the film is better suited for children than adults except for the occasional off-color jokes revolving around a ""pin-up"" magazine that Trimble has in his possession (a little shocking for an older Disney film). The second thing that makes the 1979 film a bit of a problem for modern audiences is the space-age technology, which may have been cutting edge in 1970's culture, but is long pass now. It is not likely to appear as magical to current viewers. If I had to give a recommendation, I would steer viewers to Bing Crosby's film of the book. It avoids the space theme, so it is not ""doubly dated."" And the writing is undoubtedly better.",1379462400,,1372,4.492
1219442,5,B00000IBRS,"In the 1979 Disney film, ""The Unidentified Flying Oddball"",  also known by ""The Spaceman in King Arthur's Court"" and other titles, NASA scientist Tom Trimble is ordered to design an android to take an experimental, time traveling voyage via a rocket ship through space (since it was deemed too dangerous for a living passenger). Tom makes the robot identical to himself, and pretty remarkable by 70's standards. He even feels fear and an attraction to the opposite sex! Unfortunately, the robot, dubbed Hermes, becomes afraid to take part in the mission. When Tom comes aboard the spacecraft at the last minute to comfort him, well, you can guess what happens! Both of them end up traveling to the past, and they land smack dab in King Arthur's yard! Tom is soon taken prisoner, as he is believed to be some sort of demon or monster, and it's very hard to explain anything to these people! He fascinates them with his futuristic technology, and he does make some friends. However, Tom also makes some enemies, especially when he discovers a plot to overthrow King Arthur by the sinister duo of Merlin and Sir Morded. Luckily, Tom's modern technology may be the perfect match against Mordred and his army, with a lot of help from Hermes of course!

I will always remember seeing this movie on the bigscreen as a small child. It must have been a rerelease, or else I have a darn good memory since I was like 4 when this came out. Still, these 70's Disney flicks are some of my earliest film-going memories, even though the live-action comedies are often panned, they are some of my fondest memories too, and I still get a lot of enjoyment out of these films today! In fact, some of them I just don't get why people don't dislike so much! Yeah, they're silly and corny, but so what? There's actually a lot of good humor to them, and the stories are fun! There's a lot of great comedic acting in them too. Unidentified Flying Oddball, of course, is based on Mark Twain's story ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"", published under his real name, I believe (Samuel Clemens). But this, of course, is a very different take on the story, and a perfect film to watch before a trip to Disney World. I mean, it's Tomorrowland meets Fantasyland, and it's totally delightful. The cast is excellent, with Dennis Dugan in the role of Tom and Hermes, the great Ron Moody as Merlin, and a fave of mine, Jim Dale, as wicked Sir Mordred. There's a love story in here too, with Sheila White playing charmingly goofy peasant Alisande, who carries a gander around with her believing it is her father under a spell. The story is wacky and high energy, medieval times-like fun, with no worries about butterfly theories or any of that sort of trouble. The greatest quibble one should be able to find with this film is, well, during the rocket chair scenes, you can totally see the wires, ha. Like, really badly. But, it's easily ignored, as this movie is a hoot!

Unfortunately, the DVD offers no real bonus features. We can only say to ourselves, ""Well, at least it looks great and is in enhanced widescreen."" If all you're concerned with is the movie, this is a great release. Though, as a Disney fanatic, I would have loved to see it loaded with lots more. Trailers, commentary, a behind the scenes retrospective would all be great, but even just an episode of the Disney anthology series or some short cartoons with appropriately related themes would be nice (particularly material not already released in the Treasures sets or other Disney releases). Nevertheless, still just happy to finally have this one in my collection!",1368403200,4,3613,4.677672955974843
1219443,4,B00000IBRS,"""Unidentified Flying Oddball"" - abbreviated reading UFO - is quite a good film. It has charm, suspense and a good dose of that old British wit.

The beginning is kind of the formalities as dignitaries discuss the ethics flying a man into deep outer space, never to return. I think the American from the Fawlty Towers episode is there? No, it's just that Bruce Boa and Robert Beatty get me confused... Anwyay, they decide against it so a robot is built to do the job. However, the human who was originally going to do the mission, Tom, ends up in outer space. He arrives back to Earth at the time of the knights of the round table, in England, and the local townsfolk really don't know what to do with him.

There are funny scenes as Tom uses modern technology to help King Arthur defeat dissenters, dragging them back and forth across a field, as well as other funny scenes where Tom makes a complete fool of himself babbling on about the future.

If you love classic British comedy, like 'Carry On', then you'll probably like this; there's Jim Dale and John le Mesurier and that classic British sense of the absurd. It may not necessarily be for the Sci-Fi fan, as it really isn't about that, although the comparisons of the technologies of then and now (well, 1979) are interesting. Not quite 4 stars, probably 3 1/2, but fun anyway.",1345680000,2,1335,4.531120331950207
1219444,4,B00000IBRS,"I remember seeing this when i was a kid, about 10-11, and enjoying it.  Just recently saw it again and was surprised how well it held up over the years.  Well done for an early Disney movie and decent humor in it for even adults.  No eye popping CGI because it doesnt need any!  Just a fun story that should hold most peoples attention young and old,  and not overly long and boring at only 93 minutes.  Took me back to my youth,  loved it.",1337731200,2,440,4.105882352941176
1219445,2,B00000IBRS,"If The Spaceman and King Arthur aka Unidentified Flying Oddball merited an entry in The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it would doubtless read 'mostly harmless.' The kind of family special effects comedy that Disney continued to push out to diminishing returns long after Uncle Walt left the building and audiences lost interest, this umpteenth reworking of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in the Court of King Arthur doesn't have many jokes and even fewer of them are any good, but the film's so good-natured and relentlessly eager to please that you can't really hold it against it. Denis Dugan is the NASA scientist who finds himself accidentally shot into space in an experimental spacecraft alongside his robot double and ends up going back in time to King Arthur's court where he crosses swords with Jim Dale's evil Sir Mordred (in Disney's final attempt to turn him into a US star) and Ron Moody's Merlin, for once on the side of the villains. Nothing terribly imaginative or amusing happens, but it passes the time pleasantly enough, Ron Goodwin's score revisiting the odd motif from his earlier score for Sword of Lancelot, Paul Beeson's photography throwing up a couple of pretty images, and Kenneth More ending his movie career with his dignity intact as King Arthur, displaying some nice chemistry with John Le Mesurier's vague Sir Gawain even if it's no valedictory performance.

No extras on the DVD, which uses the film's American title, Unidentified Flying Oddball, but a decent widescreen transfer.",1293580800,2,1521,5.059760956175299
1219446,3,B00000IBRS,"The movie title alone suggests that you're in for all kinds of goofiness. UNIDENTIFIED FLYING ODDBALL is Disney's very loose adaptation of Mark Twain's classic, A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT. And for the younger kids who've played at being an astronaut or a valorous knight, they'll get a kick out of this one. I'm trying to be objective, but I have to say that I read the novelization of this film when I was growing up, even before I saw the actual film. So I've always regarded this one with nostalgia. Let's see how far nostalgia takes this.

The premise has NASA engineer Tom Trimble, in an experimental space shuttle, accidentally transported to merrie olde 6th Century England. And, in the year 508, Tom travels to Camelot and meets King Arthur and foils the sinister schemes of Sir Mordred and the despicable Merlin. Dennis Dugan is okay but bland as both Tom Trimble and the humanoid robot Hermes, whom Tom had created in his likeness (Hermes was supposed to be the only one manning the shuttle until, oopsy...). To this day, it cracks me up that Trimble, instead of properly addressing King Arthur as ""Your Highness"" or ""Your Majesty,"" persists in calling him ""King"" - as in ""I'm sorry, King, but I'm in a hurry."" or ""Here, King, you take this."" As a bit of a touch,  when Tom was still walking around in his spacesuit and bubble helmet, the 6th Century inhabitants politely insisted on addressing him as ""Monster.""

The humor is typically how Disney did it back-in-the-day. Silly and slapsticky and even fun if you're maybe a pre-teen. Nowadays, most of it comes off as dated and cheesy. Still, there are some universally funny stuff. The highlight of the film for me would have to be Tom's duel with Sir Mordred, which would've been an unfair match except that Tom had moments ago just magnetized Mordred's sword. This sequence won't remind anyone of Errol Flynn versus Basil Rathbone, but it might make you grin really big. There's Merlin's aside to King Arthur when Hermes the robot gets his head knocked off in a joust: ""I've seen similar phenomena in chickens, m'lord."" Then there's the innocent fair maid Alisande who believes that foul sorcery had transformed her father into a gander. Silly and sweet. The movie does give one adult wink when lowly page Clarence agrees to assist Tom in exchange for a smut magazine.

To be brutally honest, I think that UNIDENTIFIED FLYING ODDBALL (also known as THE SPACEMAN AND KING ARTHUR) falls only somewhere in the middle of the pack in that slew of flicks which came out during Disney's bleaker years. ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN was loads better, and FREAKY FRIDAY. I even liked TRON, THE BLACK HOLE, and CONDORMAN (yes, CONDORMAN!) better. The British cast comes in and lends some gravitas, notably Jim Dale as Sir Mordred and Ron Moody as Merlin (but the gent playing King Arthur was kind of stiff). Ultimately, I don't know that I can rate this film higher than three stars out of five (okay, 3.5!). I like this movie, but nostalgia can only carry it so far.",1268697600,,3032,4.715094339622642
1219447,3,B00000IBRS,"It has great value as a family-friendly movie. Otherwise, neither the storyline, nor the production are worth mentioning.",1233446400,,121,5.777777777777778
1219448,4,B00000IBRS,"STORY: Unidentified Flying Oddball is short for U.F.O. of course. This live action film from the Walt Disney studio is the story of Tom Trimble the NASA astronaut (Dennis Dugan) and his robot Hermes. They have a newly designed faster than the speed of light spaceship called the ""Stardust"", that is hit by a lightening bolt in and knocks Tom back in time to the days of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Thinking he has traveled to another world, Tom leaves the craft in his spacesuit. Seeing him in this spacesuit the citizens think he is a monster or dragon and attack him, sending him to prison. After being imprisoned, Tom learns of a threat against the king from the nefarious Sir Mordred (Jim Dale) who wants to take the King's throne at Camelot for himself.  Merlin (Ron Moody) is aiding Mordred in the scheme and is envious of Tom's modern scientific talents, since his own power is based on illusion. After Tom is released he begins to use technology to improve the kingdom, and along the way he develops a love interest with Alisande (Sheila White). Merlin and Sir Mordred join forces to attack the king, and Tom must help the Knights defend the King. There is some light romance, some action, and plenty of comedy. Note: For those people that are used to the kind and powerful Merlin character, be forewarned, this is an evil Merlin. All in all, good clean family fun.

BEHIND THE SCENES: Don Tate wrote the screenplay as a loose re-interpretation of the Mark Twain story, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. If the acting and productions seems at times like a 1970's TV sitcom, that may be the result of director Russ Mayberry, who worked on shows such as ""I Dream of Jeannie"", and ""Bewitched"". Shooting occurred on location in the United Kingdom with a production team formed to film exteriors at the real 11th century castle ""Alnwick"", and interiors at Pinewood Studios in England. At the castle's village, the producers hired 1,000 extras to be used in the film. The special effects crew was responsible for major challenges including the creation of the stardust spaceship with a working ramp, a moon buggy that expands to double its size, and a robot arm. Additionally they had to come up with a flying jetpack, a robot, spacesuits, a magnetized sword, and space guns. The promotional movie poster that Walt Disney studios used in the U.S. at the time had the tagline, ""Chaos in the Cosmos"".  Running time is not long at 93 minutes.

The movie went through some inexplicable name changes during production and subsequent release. The working title during production was ""A Spaceman in King Arthur's Court"". By the time it was released in the United Kingdom it was retitled  ""The Spaceman and King Arthur"" on July 10, 1979. Just weeks later it opened in U.S. theaters on July 26, 1979 under a third title, ""Unidentified Flying Oddball"". Promotional material and ads used a subtitle of ""The Spaceman and King Arthur"". When it aired on television's ""The Wonderful World of Disney"", on February 27 and March 6 1982 as two episodes, it was re-named to it's first working title as ""A Spaceman in King Arthur's Court"". When it was released on video for the first time in 1986, it was changed back again to ""Unidentified Flying Oddball"" in the US and the UK.

DVD version: The picture is in widescreen. It looks like they cleaned up the picture and color compared to my VHS version. The sound is still in Mono, but the film was made that way.  Unfortunately there are no extras on the disc. It would have been nice to see a Disney cartoon, behind the scenes feature, the trailer, and maybe one of the old space based episodes from the Wonderful World of Disney television show, such as ""Man in Space"". Still with the cleaner picture, widescreen, and longer life of a disc, I recommend this as an upgrade to your VHS copy.",1130976000,8,3853,4.674041297935103
1219449,4,B00000IBRS,"Based off the Mark Twain novel `A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', Unidentified Flying Oddball (1979) aka The Spaceman and King Arthur, may not have been one of the more popular live action Disney films of the past, but I liked it for a number of reason which I'll talk about later...the film, written by Don Tait (Hell's Angels '69, The Apple Dumpling Gang), was directed by Russ Mayberry, who primarily worked in the medium of television directing on shows like ""Bewitched"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"", ""That Girl"", ""The Brady Bunch"", ""The Partridge Family"", ""The Rockford Files"", along with many others, but did find time to do a few films, including this one.  Starring in the film is Dennis Dugan (The Howling, Problem Child, Happy Gilmore), Sheila White (Confessions from a Holiday Camp), Ron Moody, whom many will recognize as the dastardly character Fagin in the 1968 film Oliver!, and Jim Dale, a fixture in the British `Carry On...' film series.  Also appearing is Kenneth More (Sink the Bismarck!), John Le Mesurier (I'm All Right Jack, Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?), Rodney Bewes (Jabberwocky), and Pat Roach, whom you may have never heard of, but surely have seen in any one of his villain roles like in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - he played two roles in that film, one being the big Sherpa in the bar and another as the mechanic/brawler, the character of Lippe (he fought Bond in the health spa) in the James Bond film Never Say Never Again (1983), the chief guard in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and skeleton masked General Kael in Willow (1988), to name a few.

The story begins as we see a group at NASA discussing a new project featuring a shuttle called Stardust that has the ability to travel faster than any previous ship.  There's a bunch of scientific mumbo jumbo presented, but the gooberment officials are reluctant to approve sending humans up in an untested craft (it's an election year), so scientific brain boy Tom Trimble (Dugan) is tasked to build a humanoid robot to pilot the ship, which he does (in his own image), but the robot, named Hermes, was apparently made too human,  and is afraid to make the 30 year trip.  Trimble, in an effort to convince Hermes that everything will be all right, gets caught in the shuttle during an accidental launch, and both end up in orbit.  The ship does what it was designed to do (traveling faster than the speed of light), subsequently travels back in time, and, on returning to Earth, Trimble discovers he's in 6th century England, specifically King Arthur's court at Camelot!  Trimble meets a local girl named Alisande (White), and she believes him to be some sort of monster (in his spacesuit), despite his protests.  Soon Trimble is captured by the rotter Sir Mordred (Gale), taken to Camelot and sentenced to death.  It's around this time Trimble learns of Mordred's treacherous plans to overthrow King Arthur (More), and now must use his intelligence and wits to not only keep himself alive, but also prevent the despicable Mordred and his cronies from their foul machinations through.

First off I just want to say it felt good to watch a family friendly film that doesn't insinuate toilet humor into the story to get laughs...not that I mind that kind of thing, but it seems so much more prevalent nowadays for these types of films, geared towards general audiences, to rely on techniques of the lowest common denominator to try and entertain.  As far as the story goes, it was very straightforward, and moved along well.  Dugan seemed a decent choice for the role of Trimble (I guess Dean Jones and Kurt Russell, both frequent stars in Disney's mid 60's/early 70's live action pics, were busy on other projects), and he does well presenting pre-MacGyver like character who uses his intelligence to get out of sticky situations.  As far as the others, my favorite was Dale as Sir Mordred.  He did a wonderful job bringing his character to life, and could have easily been transposed to more serious films with respect to Arthurian legend despite being a bit over the top at times (what good villain isn't?)  As far as the character of Merlin, played by Moody...I thought he also did very well, but the way the character was written seemed to go against most of what I think I know in the respect the Merlin here was not a very nice guy...and what was up with his hair?  It looked like they shaved the top of Moody's head, giving him a horseshoe hair pattern, leaving a handle-like tuft at the very top....very weird...another character I enjoyed was that of Sir Gawain, played by Le Mesurier.  The role wasn't very big, but incorporated a sort of subtle humor (a slight touch of that droll, British humor) that complemented the sequences he appeared in very well.  The odd man out was that of King Arthur, played by More.  He did all right, but he lacked the majestic qualities I normally associate with the character.  It's not like he ruined the movie or anything, but he just seemed a little out of place.  The sets and costumes were very good, relaying better than average production values, along with most of the special effects, although there is a sequence with Trimble in a flying rocket chair where the wires are plainly visible, but again, this wasn't something that ruined the film for me.  My favorite sequence was the magnetized sword bit and I also liked how, through a good part of the film, Trimble was perceived by the 6th century inhabitants as not so much a dangerous threat, but sort of a pitiful oddity, one that might be better put out of his misery.  I'm unsure how kids today, what with their Harry Potters and such, would receive a film like this, but for those of us who grew up in the 70's and 80's, this is a welcome trip back to simpler times.

The widescreen (1.85:1) picture, enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs, looks sharp, but there are some very minor signs of age deterioration in the film (nothing to get too hung up on).  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through clearly, and there are English subtitles available.  There are no other special features.
