8406375,5,B003V4JU1C,"Classic cult mold breaking awesome British cop show from the 70's. Harsh, gritty, realistic and engaging. THOROUGHLY recommend it to anyone who likes 'cop shows'.",1303084800,2,162,5.52
8406376,5,B003V4JU1C,"The USA received a very strange release timeline of this show on DVD.  First, the two big screen films saw a double disc set release:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Sweeney-2/dp/B00007JMCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney/Sweeney 2</a>, which is now out of print.  A very odd way to introduce US fans to the show, considering movie versions of TV shows always play slightly off key from the original shows. Then, a different company released only series 1, with no other series releases. When it went out of print, I thought for sure the rest of the seasons would never see the light of day.  BFS apparently has the license now and is releasing all 4 seasons, so US fans can finally see the entire series.

If you like the cockney rhyming slang of this 70's cop series, you may also like another British cult show which started in 1979 and ran through to the 90's, called Minder. It ran for 10 seasons, and so far, BFS is releasing seasons 1-3.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minder-Season-One/dp/B003G4CWVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minder - Season One</a>.",1287619200,5,1145,5.7976190476190474
