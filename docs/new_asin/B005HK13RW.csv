4702054,2,B005HK13RW,I bought this to have the HD fireplace scenes along with Christmas music playing in the background when we had guests over for the holidays.  The HD video was very nice but I was also expecting a quality arrangement of Christmas music to go with it.  What we got was someone playing Christmas tunes on an electronic keyboard.  It sounded cheap and cheesy.  Fortunately we could turn off the music and just enjoy the fire.  If you do not care about the music this is nice at a good price.,1325289600,2,487,4.366666666666666

4702058,3,B005HK13RW,I agree with some of the comments about the erratic close-ups. I did not like that at all. But I did like the solo piano selections. I wish I could have them on a CD.,1417305600,,166,3.7714285714285714
4702059,3,B005HK13RW,"Great fireplace video for Christmas. The music is festive and only reason I gave it 3 stars is the fire appears to be real but never burns away. It is a close up of the fire that I believe is just a few moments that stays the same but cuts away to close-up shots of other fires burning. Not fond of the way it's put together. I have another fireside DVD that is real with real crackling and spitting and as the fire burns more wood is added. Much more realistic than this film. Would not recommend .

4702061,4,B005HK13RW,Excellent. The fire place sounds were perfect for the holiday. Never played the music track. I didn't see the point.,1389052800,,116,4.85

4702063,5,B005HK13RW,We enjoyed playing this DVD during Christmas Day while opening gifts and enjoying family time together.  It was great to have this as background music during the day.,1361232000,,166,4.928571428571429
4702064,1,B005HK13RW,"For those of you who don't like movie trailers and what to be completely surprised don't read this. For the rest of you, here we go!

We start out with really nice fire brick. And a very nice well burning fire. We have flames and puffs of smoke going up. Sparks and embers going down. And you can see it all. The relaxing sound and scene leaves you with anticipation.  This really would be a great fire to watch burn itself down to a bed of embers. It's that good. Then about 2:30 on the counter someone shoves your face four inches form burning coals. Your left to wonder, what happened to that great fire? Why is my face four inches form these burning coals? What is this long out of focus black thing in the center of the picture? Should I be watching this long out of focus black thing?  Then at around 4:40 on the counter your magically transported back to that really nice, relaxing set of burning logs. The Spanish inquisition is over. Your safe now. It's a great looking fire. The memory of what took place earlier is fading away with the gentle crackling and relaxing scene. For a few minutes all is good. Till someone shoves your face four inches away from burning sticks. Yes. Sticks. Like the sticks you pick up before you mow the lawn. Burning away four inches form your nose hair.

There you go folks! That's the first seven or so minutes of this video. Just imagine what the rest of it's like.  The producers of this film have proven one thing. The wood burned to make this video  would have been better off milled into toilet paper. Not recommended.",1353024000,14,1565,4.397923875432526

8473206,5,B005HK13RW,Such an Relaxing Christmas Music Video listening to Christmas Songs with the fire going!!!:) Gets me in The Mood for Relaxing and Happy Times and Days listening to Christmas Music in July and in December!!!:),1499817600,,208,4.9714285714285715
8473207,5,B005HK13RW,"I listen to this music several times a week and quite often more than once in a day.  The piano music perfectly fits the warmth of the holidays.  And I love Christmas!.  It's the coming together of family that does it for me.  I start singing carols to myself without even realizing it about the first week of July; never have been able to figure out why, but happens every year.  This season I ran across this 2011 dvd on Netflix and it was just enchanting.  I've heard/watched other fireplace dvds but this one is the best of the lot, in my humble opinion.  I listened (and sometimes watched) the darn thing so many times, I went looking for it for my personal library.  What a find.  I'd have appreciated details about the artist performing (Jason Retana?), but you can't have everything.  Many Thanks to that person who plays this music so well that I never tire of hearing these carols.",1489536000,,891,4.478260869565218

8473209,5,B005HK13RW,Works perfect for getting the fireplace effect during the winter time.,1451952000,,70,5.454545454545454
8473210,1,B005HK13RW,"This garbage is not as advertised.  I got this as a Blu Ray disk, but it has horrible resolution and low quality audio - definitely not DTS as claimed.  My new TV lists the resolution when disks start and this disk is only running 24 frames per second.  It is nowhere near 1080P as it claims.  I was bummed and took it back, but the store where I bought it would not take a return on it. Also, the scene does not change frequently enough either, which could cause screen burn in where the flames are white in two spost on the recurrent fireplace scene.",1447113600,,552,4.228571428571429
8473211,5,B005HK13RW,very good,1422403200,,9,4.0
8473212,1,B005HK13RW,"Only a few bucks, but still a poor value as music loop is ridiculously short and utterly trite.  Far better products available elsewhere, some even for free.  Wish I had taken the time to shop around.",1422144000,,200,4.527777777777778
