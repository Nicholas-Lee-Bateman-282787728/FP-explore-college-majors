8123168,5,B000FII2VG,"I really like the Rembrandt, Rubens, and Vermeer dvds, but It's just a preference of artists.  Some of the commentators were annoying in their speech and presentation.  Mostly though I really liked the critics' opinions.  I didn't care for the morbid art of
Bosch. And I disagreed with the opinions of a critic about Breugel's art.  I really liked the set, though, and would like one of American artists, like Sargeant, EAkins, Hopper,, and Homer.",1392163200,,447,4.92
8123169,5,B000FII2VG,"The Dutch Masters, a six-DVD set, introduce viewers to one of the most important schools in the history of visual arts: The Flemish/Dutch School of Painting of the 16th and 17th centuries.  Art scholars chronicle the life, historical context, and the most celebrated works of six major artists of this school, namely:

1) Hieronymus Van Aken, known as Hieronymus Bosch after his birthplace`s Hertogenbosch

2) Pieter Breughel the Elder

3) Pieter Paul Rubens

4) Antoon van Dijck

5) Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, and

6) Johannes Vermeer.

To their credit, art scholars clearly explain the different techniques that these artists used for their religious scenes, portraits, land- and seascapes, still lifes, and other genres.  The on-location photography mainly in both Belgium and the Netherlands give viewers a better understanding of the surroundings that were familiar to these artists.  The Dutch Masters cannot be a substitute for physically seeing these works.",1174262400,16,970,5.449664429530201
8123170,4,B000FII2VG,"These were compact 50 minute lectures packed with information and art for the beginning or middle level student. It was a GREAT selection, where oddly the alphabetical order followed the chronological order. They were economically produced and thus offered at economical price. Probably not the best you could ever find, but nice, if you want to have a review or introduction. We feel very pleased with our set.

Also makes somewhat nice ""wallpaper"" to run on your television.",1154649600,12,476,5.102564102564102
