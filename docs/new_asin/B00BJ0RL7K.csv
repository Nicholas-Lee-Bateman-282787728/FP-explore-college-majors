5625217,4,B00BJ0RL7K,"This semi comedic film sets about telling the story of one of the most colourful characters of the last century, well in England anyway. That was Paul Raymond, played by the nearly always, brilliant Steve Coogan. We start with the untimely death of his much loved daughter. He then reflects back on his life.

This is done by the film going back to the beginning of his sex empire and reverts to black and white which was a a good way to age the footage and we see how his philandering ways cost him his first marriage. We have him being a theatre impresario and the art of ladies with scant clothes on being his stock in trade. Raymond seems to like quoting Oscar Wilde which is also a nice touch. Whilst this is a comedy it is the script and the one liners that do most of the laughs. The actual on screen action is as much drama as anything else.

There is a host of supporting stars too with Chris Addison playing a very beardy Mens Only publisher. Anna Friel as Jean Raymond, Matt Lucas as Divine, David Walliams as a pervy vicar and even Stephen Fry putting in a very short appearance as a barrister. Coogans make up is excellent and he ages really well throughout the 101 minutes of screen time. The soundtrack is great too with the likes of Roxy Music, T-Rex and even Cilla Black all getting an airing. There is a fair deal of mild nudity and a lot of strong words which are all in context and not gratuitous  unlike the nude ladies that is.

It has been criticised for lack of character development, but I think that was half the problem in that Raymond did not have to develop and so got round to it too late, also it is quite difficult to do that with such a long cast list. The main question should be is it any good? Well I for one really enjoyed it, the humour was just a part of the whole story the way it is in most real lives. The acting was all great and was camped up in all the right places. The poignant scenes were played with the right amount of pathos too. It was originally to be called The King of Soho, but Paul Raymonds son Howard threatened legal action as he is working on a project of the same title about his father. All in all a really great film that I would be happy to recommend.",1382227200,5,2215,4.192488262910798
5625218,4,B00BJ0RL7K,"Going in, I knew almost nothing about Paul Raymond.  This is a lovely, very engaging film with some great performances, esp Steve Coogan & Imogen Poots. Quite funny with a great sense of London from through the 50's, 60's and 70's. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's raunchy with quite a bit of nudity, so probably not good family viewing however.",1379548800,5,342,4.7

8569237,4,B00BJ0RL7K,"Recounting the life of porn king and entrepreneur Paul Raymond, THE LOOK OF LOVE tells the story of a self-made man, born Geoffrey Quinn, who rose to become Britain's richest man.  He achieved this by buying innumerable properties and setting up a porn empire that at its height included the Raymond Revuebar, the Windmill Theatre, the Whitehall Theatre, plus two best-selling magazines, ""Men Only"" and ""Club International.""  Despite such success, Raymond - as characterized by Steve Coogan - remained a fundamentally unhappy man.  Obsessed with the idea of proving his virility, he spent most of his time bedding young women as well as taking vicarious pleasure in watching women perform various sex acts on stage.  Although his daughter Debbie (Imogen Poots) was devoted to him, Raymond remained indifferent to her - unless, that is, she could make more money for him,  He cast her in an ill-starred revue, ""Royalty Follies,"" in a leading role for which she was completely unsuited.  The only time Raymond actually missed her was at her death due to a drug overdose.  Michael Winterbottom's film makes no judgment on Raymond, but nonetheless suggests the emptiness of the world he created - neither titillating nor sexy, it simply treated women as objects.  The film does a brilliant job of recreating the seedy Soho world of the Sixties and Seventies, with its grimy streets and tatty shops.  Steve Coogan does a wonderful job in the leading role; he is proving to be a talented performer in a variety of vehicles.  THE LOOK OF LOVE contains a gallery of cameo roles from British comedians, including Stephen Fry, Matt Lucas, David Wallians and Miles Jupp; but its story remains a fundamentally melancholy one to tell.",1397174400,2,1721,5.007017543859649
8569238,3,B00BJ0RL7K,"There was a bizarre meta-moment during the screening of Michael Winterbottoms biopic of Soho impresario Paul Raymond when the audience, at a little preview screening theatre in heart of Soho, realised we were sitting in the exact room that was appearing on the screen in front of us  a scene taking place in a Soho screening room and clearly shot on location.

It isn't clear who did think it was a good idea to title this film The Look of Love but they were mistaken, not least because there was a Robin Williams/Ed Harris vehicle of the same name scheduled for release the same year. In any case, however you do choose to look at this film  a question of some perplexity as I will explain  it isn't a romantic comedy, and making it sound like one runs the risk of nixing its chances at the box office, at which it verily tanked, if Box Office Mojo is anything to go by: it seems to have made about twenty grand. That ain't going to pay for Steve Coogan's dry cleaning.

And the pictures misnaming is symptomatic of a bigger problem with the film in general: its an Arthur masquerading as a Martha. By its plot trajectory, The Look of Love ought to be a tragedy, but the characters of neither Paul Raymond (Steve Coogan, playing a role with parallels to his own lifes experience) nor his beloved daughter Deborah (Imogen Poots) are invested with the right qualities to make a tragedy work.

Tragic characters are possessed of a delicate balance of emotionally-investable virtue and repellant human flaw. This precipitates in them a righteous internal struggle which, in the end, the virtuous side must lose.  Tragedies are all about this internal struggle been light and dark.  They are not, principally, about the background facts against which this struggle plays out. The Look of Love fixes its gaze insistently on the background facts. Paul Raymond presents as a roguish northern huckster.  He has seized a large financial opportunity by riding the edge of a prurient societys mores. These mores, perhaps in part thanks to Raymonds own endeavours, are not ones with which an enlightened 21st century audience is likely to have much sympathy. Raymond is also charming with it, and as youd expect, not above enjoying the manifold fruits of his enterprise. Indeed, his wife (Anna Friel) seems to expect it too, and Raymond takes no steps to conceal it from her which, in its way, is rather decent behaviour. He is more variable in his devotion to his children: Raymond ignores his two sons and dotes extravagantly on his daughter Deborah. Hes no angel, but in sum, these are hardly Shakespearian flaws. Nor, in Deborahs case, is being spoilt, or possessing a marginal singing voice.

Nevertheless, due to an unwise screenwriting decision, we are primed from the outset to expect an unhappy outcome as between father and daughter, and so it turns out. But because genuinely tragic flaws are thin on the ground; because there is no such internal struggle, what might have been a tragedy really plays just as a downer.

So, to brighten the mood, the assembled cast (including as it does a surfeit of Noted British Comedians) works the screenplay hard as a comedy. This works fitfully, but never wholeheartedly. A lustier swing for laughs, with a more abrupt tragic turn, might have made the pathos bite the way it did in, say, Four Weddings and a Funeral.

In the meantime, to keep the gentlemen entertained there are a lot of boobs, great and small, on display. Lots and lots and lots. About this no red-blooded chap can, with a straight face, complain  especially not at the sight of Tamsin Egertons willowy frame splashing around like a wet otter in a glass-walled tank of water. It might just be attention to detail from the fastidious production design department, which has surely been at pains to attain period authenticity in all other respects, but it did feel a little gratuitous, yet without being (Ms Egertons aquatics notwithstanding) especially titillating.

This sounds too much like I disliked the film, and I didnt. I enjoyed it. The Look of Love is a handsome, well directed, well-acted picture, boasting marvellous production design, lovely cinematography and boasting an impressive ensemble performance (and a huge cast) but, if one compares it with its spiritual forebear, The People vs. Larry Flint, it did feel a little lacking in pure dramatic spark.

8569239,3,B00BJ0RL7K,"I am a big fan of Steve Coogan and that is what prompted me to watch this film. I knew little of Paul Raymond's story beforehand. There are some fine and highly watchable moments in this and Coogan does admirably in the lead role. The background and scenes in London from the 60's through the 80s are very entertaining in their own right. Given the subject matter there are a host of beautiful women in supporting roles. So far so good, right ? But overall there was something missing. The story of a man building a business empire based on soft porn and strip clubs , the inevitable use of drugs in the 80s, the tragic family relationships with his ex wife and children all may be based in fact but it seemed like a check the box exercise in a typical the higher they fly the further they fall cliche"".
It was worth a rental but in the end it's a fairly forgettable film.",1392076800,,872,4.290909090909091
8569240,2,B00BJ0RL7K,"Narration, long montage scenes, highlights of a glamorous life A  man's a rise to fame and fortune that spans decades.
The seedy side of show business. The Hugh Hefner of London. Sounds like a great story... righ?. So, why is it so boring?

 Perhaps there are too many stories here. Too many highlights. The lead character never seems to change. And despite all the various scenes. They all seem like a scene, we've seen before.
I just didn't like or care about any of these characters.

Unfortunately, I can't recommend, despite some great performances in the supporting female roles.
I think Steve Coogan was under utilized here.",1386979200,2,631,4.869158878504673
