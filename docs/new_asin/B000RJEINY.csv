8201044,5,B000RJEINY,"One of the most poignant films about the nature of family and memory I have ever seen. Davies is an artist with a viewpoint and perfect understanding of his craft. He ties the film together with popular music, understanding its powerful role in subconscious of everyday experience.",1504310400,,281,5.0
8201045,5,B000RJEINY,"It's no accident that half the viewers gave it five stars and half gave it one: it's not for everyone -- but it is one of the finest movies ever made. There's no real plot, no real action and no real resolution -- just like life. The film is a kind of memoir of Davies's childhood and the milieu in which he grew up. No one should watch it who doesn't have a lot of patience for the small beauty and poignancy of life. If you understand what you're getting into, it'll be one of the most rewarding film experiences you will ever have.",1489708800,2,534,4.144230769230769
8201046,5,B000RJEINY,This is one of the most beautiful and affecting movies I've ever seen. Davies is a master of capturing the details (and the silences) of hard emotion.,1484784000,,150,4.592592592592593
8201047,1,B000RJEINY,Only the music is good.  The plot and filming leave much to be desired. Don't bother wasting your money on this one!,1400544000,,116,4.2727272727272725
8201048,5,B000RJEINY,"A complex family story superbly directed with absolutely beautiful cinemaphotography. Best of all, the soundtrack is peppered with great popular tunes from the 1940s and 1950s. Watch it, you'll love it!",1397520000,2,202,5.548387096774194
8201049,4,B000RJEINY,"This is a beautiful film about memory, constructed around the life of a working class family in Britain in the 1940s and 50s. The first section, Distant Voices, focuses on the 1940s. It is a grim story but better told than the happier story of the 1950s (Still Lives). Davies is not a director for everyone. He requires a lot of patience but if you have that, he will generally reward you. He reminds me in this way of Terrence Malick. I actually would rate the Distant Voices section of this film 5 stars. It is just splendid. Still Lives covers a lot of time too hurriedly and lacks the sharp narrative focus of the first part. I would rate it 3 stars. But a 3 star movie by Davies still has its rewards.",1397260800,,706,4.276119402985074
8201050,1,B000RJEINY,I looked forward to watching this DVD especially as one of the actors was Pete Postlethwaite.  The dialogue was in Spanish but there were no subtitles.  I just couldn't believe it at first as this has never happened before with any DVD I have purchased through Amazon.  But trying to watch the film on friends' sets confirmed that the English subtitles just weren't available.,1366156800,,376,4.84375
