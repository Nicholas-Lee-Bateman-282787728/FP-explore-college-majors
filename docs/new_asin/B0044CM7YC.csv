4260865,5,B0044CM7YC,"This collection of workouts is the best! It's fun, you sweat, and it teaches you so much about yoga practice. I am so impressed with Rodney Yee and his ability to make yoga so much fun!!!",1328140800,,187,4.222222222222222
4260866,5,B0044CM7YC,"I have been doing beginners yoga for quite some time. I had recently decided to kick it up a notch. The yoga burn is just that.. specific focus by holding different poses. It's a great workout. The power yoga, which I just tried last night is wonderful. I watched it and didn't think I could do it. Granted, there were a few i had to modify, and a few I could not do but I enjoyed it tremendously. I enjoy Rodney Yee's tapes as he has a very calming voice.",1324166400,,456,4.0777777777777775
4260867,4,B0044CM7YC,"I am a new mom, having trouble losing the baby weight.  I am also a yoga novice.  This video collection is perfect for my needs--it is challenging physically, even giving me some cardio, yet the moves are easy to understand and the motion is slow and fluid, so that I do not feel overextended.  It also works in segments, so that I still feel like I've gotten a work out even if babe wakes up after only twenty minutes.
Highly recommended for most fitness levels, though I don't think someone who is totally new to exercise could handle it; you do need some experience with yoga and have good flexibility and core strength.",1323734400,21,623,4.495575221238938
4260868,5,B0044CM7YC,This has three dvds in  one and it is fantastic if you like rodney yee. this are intermediate-advanced level so they are not appropriate for absolute beginners.,1318291200,,160,4.925925925925926
4260869,4,B0044CM7YC,"I really liked the video, partially because I got it at a nice price.  There's three lessons, each an hour long.  They assume familiarity with yoga.  There's very little in terms of correcting common mistakes or explaining how poses work.  They have the feel of a taped yoga class, rather than a cheesy ""yoga abs in 15 minutes"" sort of deal.

My definite problem with Rodney Yee is that the difficulty seems a little off.  He does the standard thing where he starts with standing/downward dog poses, then progresses on to ground work.  His standing poses are generally quite easy, he doesn't even specify chaturangas, hold planks for any length, or other steps that are helpful for building strength.  But then on the groundwork, he is weirdly flexible and assumed the viewer is the same, doing forward bends in near-splits and so forth.

I'm interested in a ""yoga for athletes"" video for the strength benefits, not because I'm already super-flexible and want to keep at that.  Anyway, everybody should keep their spine erect at all times, particularly strength athletes.  Once he gets started on ground work I'm tempted to cut out the video right there

I found the ""Yoga Burn"" the most challenging, but also a little annoying.  Sequences are done slowly and repeated over and over.  The other videos are pretty similar to each other, but it's nice to have the variety because watching the exact same recorded sequence gets old.",1314576000,79,1429,4.851239669421488
4260870,4,B0044CM7YC,Did this one morning with several of my friends and ended up ordering a DVD for each of them too.  Keeps you moving and is easy to follow.,1305331200,,138,3.9285714285714284
4260871,3,B0044CM7YC,"I love most of Rodney's yoga work. However, this is not one of my favorites. It it broken into 10-15 minutes segments that do not play in sucession but you must select individually. that may workout well for some people but takes the fluidty out of the workout something -in my opinion- you do not want to do when you are in a yoga pratice.",1305244800,23,340,4.246153846153846
4260872,5,B0044CM7YC,"Rodney Yee is one of the best yoga instructors out there. This includes 3 full length 60 minute practices taken directly from 3 previous dvds, all conveniently included on one disc. Rodney Yee doesn't focus too much on the mental/spiritual side of yoga, nor does he only speak of the physical benefits, thereby providing a nice balance that I think would appeal to most all yoga practitioners.

His voice is soothing and his cuing excellent, making it easy to flow through the poses and achieve an almost meditative state. I firmly believe all levels could benefit from this dvd, though some prior experience with yoga is recommended. I attached links to the individual workouts included in the disc below, as well as the web address where you could find my more detailed review for each. Here I will just say that each of the 3 practices is unique and different from the others and they are all wonderful. This disc is a great value and a necessary addition to any yoga fan's collection.

4260878,5,B0044CM7YC,"I'm an experienced beginner (power yoga a few years ago) and was looking for a way to get back into it at home, so have been doing the power yoga routine on the DVD for a few months now. I like his pace and style, so it's really helped get me re-enthused, despite some physical challenges. One big plus for me is that he's very concise and neutral with his instruction. Just enough words to communicate what's needed, and zero hippy dippy BS. Really happy with it!",1497657600,2,464,4.344827586206897
4260879,2,B0044CM7YC,"I have a good amount of experience with yoga so I decided to purchase this Rodney Yee program since it is a higher level than some of the other programs I own. Since getting this collection of programs in the mail, I have been doing it almost everyday as it is convenient for me to do yoga at home instead of in an outside class. However, despite the fact that I do use this a lot, out of the three programs included in the collection, I only use Power Yoga Total Body. Buying the collection in full is simply not worth it as only one of the programs will be worth it.

1) Yoga Burn - In my opinion, this program is okay. My biggest gripe with it, however, is that the background music is as loud as his voice and the explanations are lacking, so will always need to look back up at the screen to see what is going on.

2) Power Yoga Total Body - As mentioned previously, this is my favorite program. This is because the explanations are detailed and the poses are perfect for those who are intermediate in yoga. There are a variety of challenging positions in this program that Rodney explains well, which will help you improve your yoga.

3) Yoga Conditioning for Athletes - I have done this program a total of one time and do not like it that much. I do run, swim, and play other sports but the chair stretches and other poses in the program haven't caught my interest or needs so far.

Because only one out of the three programs included is worth your time and money, I would recommend not purchasing this collection and instead only purchasing the Power Yoga Total Body Workout program&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Yoga-Total-Body-Workout/dp/B0000A2ZQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Yoga - Total Body Workout</a>. Although this does include three programs and is only $5 more than one program, if you are like me, you will only end up using one out of the three anyway so you might as well just save yourself a bit of money.",1496188800,4,1984,4.67621776504298

4260881,5,B0044CM7YC,"This is my favorite yoga video!  I'm not crazy about the one for athlete's (For one, the relaxation portion of that one is so long I get antsy), but the other two are great.  I'm not super flexible, barely able to touch my toes generally, but after doing this video I can make fists and plant them on the ground.  Rodney Yee is a great instructor.  His guidance really helps my yoga be more correct, and thus more effective.",1495411200,,424,4.329113924050633

4260895,5,B0044CM7YC,"I've been doing yoga for more than ten years now (doesn't seem like it), but I don't consider myself an expert nor a novice. I purchased this because I was looking for a more challenging, lengthy routine and adore Rodney Yee's style. I've also always been athletic and flexible, so I was looking for a yoga workout that would strengthen my core and increase my flexibility. Rodney doesn't fail to disappoint. There are three workouts to choose from on this DVD; all three are an hour long and cater to strength and core building. Each workout includes standing and floor exercises that work different muscles throughout the body. Although not mentioned, a strap and a brick (or two) might be helpful for those with less flexibility; for knee poses (child's pose, simple cross-legged, etc.) a folded blanket or soft pillow may also be desired. He moves quickly and I feel some basic understanding of yoga is almost necessary to be successful in these workouts. Other than that, I am satisfied and am enjoying the vitality doing yoga brings.",1469059200,3,1039,4.842696629213483
4260896,5,B0044CM7YC,"Rodney Yee is a great instructor. Easy to understand, clear and concise. This DVD give you a lot of bang for your buck. I've use the workouts in several ways. I've done only15, 30 or 45 min of the workout when I'm pressed for time. I've used them after a run or weight workout for recovery and cool down. Also I've use it as a warm up and pre-exaust before a workout. You can't beat for the price.",1468627200,,397,4.102564102564102
4260897,4,B0044CM7YC,"I have not seen all the different flows yet however the flow for athletic conditioning goes through great poses at a good pace. My 2 complaints are the naration of the positions is not engaging using anatomical jargon which a lay person would not use and Rodney himself is hard to look at because he is in spandex/no shirt, all bulge just staring at you the whole time. Very distracting from achieving a zen-like mood while in practice.",1468454400,2,436,4.602564102564102

CD/DVD cannot be played in my region. I'm sure I would love the workout if only I could view it. Unfortunately, the return period has passed. Fortunately, I didn't pull the trigger on the other items on my wishlist. What a waste of money. Why sell customers CD/DVD's that can't be played in their region when shipping addresses are readily available to cross reference? If you purchase a CD/DVD test it right away. Don't sit on it as I did (planning graduation festivities) and end up a*s out of money and product.",1462492800,,686,4.496

4260913,1,B0044CM7YC,"I'll start off by saying i have limited Yoga experience, but! A friend of mine recently visited and I had her try this DVD as well (she does yoga 7-10 times per week). Neither of us liked the video.
As a beginner everything was way too fast and over my head. You'd start doing a pose, making sure you have it right, and he'd already be onto the next one. I have taken regular yoga lesses before, and never had this issue! I tried two of the programs, and am not going to try the last one. After completing one full length program i just felt confused, not the ""good"" yoga gives you
My friend agreed he moved really fast. She also said he renamed a bunch of the poses. She only did half of one of the program then called it quits.

I would not recommend this DVD overall",1450569600,,769,4.126666666666667
4260914,3,B0044CM7YC,"Maybe I Moises something, I thought this was an instructional video. He goes way too fast for anyone actually trying to learn. It's as if he assumes you know all the poses and breathing technique and is simply showing you what order to do all the poses.

I would give 1/5 but again I may have missed something however this is the same issue on his dad for beginners.",1450224000,,366,4.304347826086956

There are 3 60 minute routines.  It sounds intimidating but if you have the time it is totally doable.  I love them I feel great after doing them.  Yoga burn is my favorite because it is so different.  You move so slow the the motions like you are in slow motion but you never stop moving.  It is challenging because you are not used to going so slow.  But it is very relaxing hard work.

This is nothing against Rodney Yee but if you call yourself a Christian or believe in the Lord STOP doing Yoga.

I can listen to Rodney Yee read the phone book and what he says and how he says it is a large part of how I enjoy his tutorials. I use this video along with a few of his others all the time. Three one hour work outs of which the Power Yoga is the toughest one on this disc, I find. I'm not a beginner and neither should you be with this collection. The ""Conditioning for Athletes"" segment displays three different ways to do the poses but I wouldn't want to start there if I was new to yoga. If you want a beginner's video, Rodney Yee's ""Yoga For Beginners"" is a good start and I use that one quite a bit also since it is a good start-to-finish program.",1432512000,4,715,3.9722222222222223

I have been doing yoga consistently for several months and could handle it, but my husband was brand new and tried to follow with the video and he had a very hard time as he isn't familiar with the terminology and the pace was too much. Definitely not for beginners and he is quite fast in my opinion.",1428969600,,383,4.12

4260960,2,B0044CM7YC,I have purchased 3 Rodney Yee dvd's and REALLY wanted to love them because I believe Gaiam is a trusted yoga brand and all of the great reviews online. I think his DVD's are good for beginners however I don't find the flow or instruction to be as beneficial as other online tutorials including P90X and of course in person classes which there is probably no substitute for.

4260968,5,B0044CM7YC,"I got this DVD to incorporate into a physical therapy regimen and wasn't really familiar with yoga when I bought this DVD. Slow Burn is good for days when you need to be a little more gentle, Power Yoga incorporates a little more cardio than yoga burn does (you'll feel it the next day for the first few times), and I haven't tried the 3rd routine just because I saw so many bad reviews about it, but I should probably just try it and see what I think.

Rodney is a really great instructor -- he's not too much of a hippie, which I like. His voice is calming, the routines are challenging enough for beginners (I'd say beginner - early intermediate; after that, you'll need something more challenging), and it's very easy to follow along.",1418601600,2,738,4.426470588235294

If you are just starting out with yoga, be sure to start with the first one, a smooth, flowing routine that moves at an easy pace that leaves you both relaxed and invigorated. It also shapes your body more than you might realize in the beginning. Work your way up to the second routine, also flowing but vigorous.

This is not necessarily bad, just different. For those unfamiliar with yoga, the instruction is decent, but a lot of poses/sequencing might be too advanced. A towel and block/s would be a good idea. On the plus side, there is a lot of core work and stretching in each one.",1411603200,,425,4.3924050632911396

I'm reaping the benefits of doing Yoga with a back that is now pain free, great health, happy and positive outlook on life. I supplemented that with a vegan diet, and I got a really nice, slim and strong body.

Power Yoga Collection is not an easy Yoga for beginners, but if you put your mind into it, you'll get there, and you might even start enjoying it -- tremendously. I became addicted to it. When I get deprived of Yoga due to travel or other busy life events, my body starts to feel it with tense, neck, shoulders and back. But as soon as I go back to doing it, I just feel GREAT. At the end of the workout, you'll feel very relaxed and happy inside. It will put a smile on your face... It's magical :)",1406851200,7,812,4.075

These are some serious workouts. It takes significant strength, stamina and flexibility to keep up with him in these routines. I'm not even close to that level yet.

That said, it gives me something to work towards, and I very much enjoy Rodney Yee's style. The programs are well-produced. All in all a good purchase even if it is more than I can do currently.",1406764800,6,548,4.415841584158416

However, I quickly found out in the 2nd dvd in power yoga that this is either not for beginners or this is going to take a lot more practice. I have only tried the dvd once and it was a major work out! I was sweating so bad so do not think that this is an easy alternative or something!

It is not advanced, nor is there a lot of difficult poses (just warrior 1, 2, and briefly triangle pose. This portion I feel like focuses a lot on core and spine strength and conditioning; considering the slower pace, and gentle twists.
When  I first began my yoga practice, I actually bought the Power Yoga dvd (which is included in this 3 in 1 dvd). It was challenging for me and definitely more advanced than the other two programs.
If you are looking at buying this dvd, and you are a more advanced practitioner, I would pass on this. If you are beginning your yoga practice, I would jump on this dvd as it is a great value and teaches you a lot about (correct) alignment and has gentle sequences.",1398556800,3,857,4.290123456790123

I'm a dude, and I appreciate someone who can communicate well to both sexes (that includes us ""dudes""), and Mr. Yee does this really well. I never feel too awkward about doing these routines when my roommates are home (though let's be honest... it is awkward doing yoga around people who don't get it).

Excellent replay value, and overall a great financial value that will help you get in the yoga groove if you're just getting started with the practice.

You do need to have some experience in yoga in order to perform most of the moves and follow the program correctly. There is a regular 1 hour session per program. Rodney Yee is great, his commands are easy to follow and has a Soothing voice that doesn't make you feel that you are in a rush during the program.",1395964800,,381,4.219178082191781

4261024,4,B0044CM7YC,"I would consider myself a newbie to yoga even though I have tried it in the past.  I am familiar with some of the moves but Rodney's instructions are perfect.  For the most part, I do Power yoga section the most because I want to build my strength and balance.  I know I do not do the moves perfectly but I can tell a big improvement in my upper body strength and tightness in my legs.  I've done the Yoga Burn a few times and the last video once but I do the power yoga section regularly.

I mainly use these to supplement my cardio workouts and for flexibility but they could definitely be used alone.  Last year I had to have ankle surgery to repair my joint.  The Dr. said my issues were caused by tight calves & arches which caused me to walk weird and over years of doing this my ankle was really messed up.  Post surgery, he recommended nightly stretches to loosen those muscles.  Instead of doing boring band work I decided to go with yoga and chose this video and the Flexibility.  Both have really helped me loosen up both my calves and arches.  I no longer have leg cramps and seem to sleep much better the nights I do these yoga workouts.  Plus it just feels good to do those intense stretches.

Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",1395273600,8,1252,4.254237288135593

This DVD has a variety of flow yoga routines and Rodney Yee does a great job describing where to put your attention during each pose so you get them pretty close to ""right"". it definitely doesn't replace having a live instructor who can correct what you are doing on the spot - and for yoga, to get the right health effects and workout, this is pretty important--but for the person who is willing to pay attention to the details and pay attention to their own form, this is a second best option. The Yoga Burn track is perfect to stretch and elongate my muscles before running or other training. The Power Yoga track has more of a strength and toning set of poses and gets my heart rate up a little more consistently as the poses flow one to the next. Rodney keeps the communication down to just what you need to be guided in the moves and not a lot of spiritual/evaluative mumbo jumbo (I have my own belief system on that thank you very much). The level of difficulty is good for beginner and seasoned yoga practitioner alike as long as you watch your form.",1385683200,6,1163,4.364055299539171

I'm not that fond of the athlete dvd even though I am very active myself- it uses some poses sitting in a chair, etc.  But, the other 2 dvds are great.  They are flowing routines and Rodney does a good job of describing the poses.  The power yoga dvd is your typical power yoga sequence like you'd take at a studio.  Very thorough routines that get the whole body.  By the way- this is for intermediate yoga students.  I wouldn't recommend this if you are brand new to yoga (you might try Barbara Benagh's stress relief series if you're new because it moves much slower and goes into great detail explaining the poses).",1369612800,75,771,4.298611111111111

I was looking for some guided Yoga to supplement my Yoga practice and was disappointed.  This wasn't the level I was looking for.  I'd return it, if I could. I ended up buying another DVD for beginners only because I prefer a slower pace and to hold the poses.  I was hoping to find an intermediate level DVD, but they don't seem to exist.

4261079,4,B0044CM7YC,"I started doing yoga in June 2012. I'm not yogi, by any means, but I have enjoyed doing yoga along with the DVDs I've bought. I had a few DVDs before this one, and I found them boring. They were either too repetitive (and not just because of the type of yoga practiced in the video), too easy, too hard, or I just didn't click with them.

My friends got me the Rodney Yee AM Yoga DVD for my birthday last year, and I really enjoyed it, but I wanted something that was longer (the morning one is shorter so you can fit it into your morning routine) and not broken down into body part specific workouts. I had really enjoyed watching Rodney Yee as the instructor, so I was looking for a DVD where he would again be the instructor. Just like the AM Yoga DVD, the scenery is absolutely gorgeous and breath taking. They have him do the workouts in some absolutely stellar locations.

Like I said, I'm not intensely talented at yoga, nor am I in tip top athletic shape, so I would rate this DVD as one of my more challenging yoga DVDS.

There are three different options on this DVD. My favorite is the Yoga Burn. I enjoy the slow, purposeful movements. It's challenging, but not do difficult that I cannot make it through the whole work out. It only took me a couple times to be able to complete all 60 minutes at once for the Yoga Burn workout. It gives me a really great work out, I feel very relaxed afterwards and my body has responded with greater strength and muscle control. I'm sore a bit afterwards, but just in a good way, in a way that shows me I'm improving.

I have not been able to complete the Power Yoga work out all the way through, but I am building up to that as a goal. I have gotten about 30-35 minutes through it, and hope to get to the full 60 minutes by the end of April. This one makes me very sore, but in the good way. I can feel that I engaged my ab muscles, and my shoulder muscles, which are areas I am keen on improving.

I have not tried the Conditioning for Athletes part of the DVD, just the description alone makes me think it doesn't have much application to me. I'm not an athlete, I do light jogging and yoga, nothing more. I wish instead of that routine, they had put a different yoga work out, as that one is very specific to a smaller segment of people and since this is a compilation DVD, I'd liked to have seen a broader use work out as the third choice. I'm sure it's a great work out, as Rodney's DVDs have never disappointed me in being quality, I just wish it was something different to complete the 3. This why I'm giving it 4/5 stars.

I highly recommend this DVD, it's a great price and was well worth the money.",1363219200,,2657,4.169590643274854

It is nice though because I have something to work up to. The training for athletes one requires a folding chair, which you might not have.",1362528000,,299,4.0
4261083,5,B0044CM7YC,"Can't go wrong with this.  You get 3 long workouts for about the price of 1.  The 3 workouts provide something for everyone.  Yoga for Athletes is easy gentle stretching.  It offers alternatives for you depending on your level of flexibility.  Yoga Burn is a really nice workout and includes more isometric exercise and slower movements. It's very enjoyable.  Power Yoga requires a bit more flexibility--perhaps it's a bit more advanced in some way-- so I don't use that workout.  All in all, I'm very satisfied to have found 2 nice new yoga workouts.",1362009600,,551,4.797872340425532
4261084,5,B0044CM7YC,I had the power yoga workout and gave the dvd to my daughter when she went back to college. So this compilation gave me my old workout back plus more! Both are good workouts for those days when I don't feel like going to the studio. I have not yet tried the yoga for athletes but it looks perfect for some of us who aren't flexible due to years of sports and running. Such a good deal!,1360713600,,385,4.012987012987013
4261085,5,B0044CM7YC,i wanted to target more of my athletes and challenge them with some more advanced movements!  He met and exceeded my expectations of this dvd,1360281600,,141,4.64
4261086,4,B0044CM7YC,"I truly enjoy Rodney Yee.  His gentle guide leads you through progressive poses that help you find positions without necessarily watching the video.

This particular DVD is a compilation of three previously released DVDs ... so check your library before ordering this one.
Included are:
(1) Yoga Burn: released 2005
(2) Power Yoga: released 2003
(3) Yoga Conditioning for Athletes: released 2002",1359331200,,395,5.354838709677419
4261087,3,B0044CM7YC,I've done power yoga in a gym and enjoyed it very much. This dvd is okay. Not exactly what I was looking for. Can be a bit too slow and repetitive.,1359244800,,147,3.774193548387097
4261088,5,B0044CM7YC,This would be a bargain at 2x the price. Rodney Yee is a great teacher and these are good workouts. Not too hard or easy.,1359072000,,121,3.88
4261089,5,B0044CM7YC,"The workout is not very intense...yet at the same time, I feel great after doing it.  Shows you what a brilliant series of stretches these are!",1358640000,,143,4.5
4261090,1,B0044CM7YC,The yoga video was good but the DVD did not work after only a few uses. Would not recommend and would like a refund.,1358640000,,116,3.875
4261091,5,B0044CM7YC,"Love the workouts in this dvd. I used to be more flexible, until I stopped stretching for some crazy reason :( this is helping me get back to where I was while, rejuvenating, relaxing and still helping me on my fitness journey!",1358553600,,227,4.428571428571429
4261092,3,B0044CM7YC,"I don't regret buying this, and I use it often.  However, I was looking for a highly physically challenging yoga.  There are some moves that are tough in this but not like I thought.  Also, it uses the term Slow Burn yoga.  I think they could go a lot slower and hold the poses for longer.

It is a great stretch though.  Like I said I still use it,",1357776000,,349,3.9855072463768115
4261093,3,B0044CM7YC,"This is a great DVD! I would rate myself with above average yoga skills, I thought that the DVD was comparable to my yoga class. I love Rodney Yee, he is never a disappointment.",1356480000,,177,4.235294117647059
4261094,5,B0044CM7YC,I really enjoy this DVD almost every day. I daily do Yoga Burn as soon as I get up in the morning and then Power Yoga in the morning or afternoon. His instruction is very easy to understand.,1356220800,,190,4.026315789473684
4261095,5,B0044CM7YC,More challenging than I thought it would be! I have other Yoga dvds and this one goes a lot faster so be ready for that.,1355961600,7,120,3.84
4261096,5,B0044CM7YC,"I really like the workouts on this DVD. Rodney Yee provides 3 variations of the poses- normal, for those lacking flexibility, and for those lacking strength- which is very nice for me as I lack flexibility in my legs and lower back but have very flexible arms and shoulders. He also talks you through the poses in such a way that you don't need to keep glancing at the screen.",1355616000,2,376,4.385714285714286
4261097,5,B0044CM7YC,"Rodney Yee makes Yoga peaceful, calm, and effortless.
He is easy to follow and his demonstrations are on point.
As a 50 something female, yoga is helping to restore and build my core strength, flexibility, and balance.",1355529600,,218,4.918918918918919
4261098,5,B0044CM7YC,Very good value for the money.  Push your limits and widen perspective of what you can do.  Stronger by the day.,1355270400,,112,4.285714285714286
4261099,4,B0044CM7YC,"I like this Power Yoga DVD. Rodney Yee is a great instructor. You can pick and choose shorter yoga workouts. I'm a longtime beginner, so I can't do all the moves. Sometimes he goes a little too fast. But most of the time I can keep up. I think yoga is an excellent way to build strength and maintain flexibility and mobility. Yee's DVDs also tend to be very relaxing and meditative. I own several of his workouts and will continue to use them.",1355184000,3,443,4.285714285714286
4261100,4,B0044CM7YC,"I love Rodney's videos because they are easy to follow and his voice is comforting! I didn't really like the last work out on this one, the conditioning for athletes- But the rest of this is awesome.",1352073600,,199,4.405405405405405
4261101,5,B0044CM7YC,"I have to say I got exactly what I was looking for in the yoga DVD. I am new to yoga practice and wanted to go from relaxing yoga to butt kicking yoga. Weight loss is important to me, but the stretching is essential as well due to injuries I am dealing with. In the first 5 minutes of the first workout I was sweating and amazed at how challenging it is. I love Rodney Yee and would much rather get my butt kicked with his routine than some of the others out there. this is a good add on to the cardio workouts I am doing. Love it.",1351382400,5,531,3.8807339449541285
4261102,5,B0044CM7YC,"I actually thought I would be a beginner level yogi but found that I am a bit more advanced than i thought.  I can do most of Rodney's Program except for the Bow (backward stand).. I am a Power 90, Turbo Fire, Taebo, Beachbody.com fanatic and am 51!!!  I love the Burn and Power yoga and am hooked.  I feel as if I ran a marathon after.  Am now seeking a few 30 minute sessions providing what I get from these (2) 60 minute programs.

Have yet to try the Athlete portion but will soon. Im sure it won't disappoint.  I paid but a few dollars for this disc and well worth the (3) workouts.  Your reviews are key for my making my next 30 minute yoga purchase.  I want to avoid purchasing revamped packages with similar workouts!",1350950400,,725,4.202898550724638
4261103,5,B0044CM7YC,"Have only tried one of the sessions, but love it so far! Definitely a challenge. Will update once I have done the other two workouts. Cant wait to try them! Shipping was fast.",1349568000,,175,4.333333333333333
4261104,5,B0044CM7YC,All three workouts are very different and effective. You can never go wrong with Rodney Yee. Power yoga continues to be my favorite.,1349049600,,132,4.782608695652174
4261105,4,B0044CM7YC,"I used to practice yoga daily and found it really helped me stay fit and happy. I took an extended break, and have recently decided to return. Rodney is a good instructor because he describes the poses well, so that I can follow without watching the screen. This would make the video more challenging for a beginner, which is not a bad thing, but something of note.

I am working on regaining my yoga strength, which can take some time. I like to use this on days when I have already gone for a walk or run, so that I can stretch out. I really enjoyed the Yoga Burn class. It was challenging to me, but the slow pace allowed me to work on remembering how the poses feel when done correctly. Some other yoga dvds feel more rushed, and I want to take my time and feel the benefits of the pose.

Added to this, I bought the dvd new for less than $6. Completely worth it.",1347580800,,867,4.154761904761905
4261106,5,B0044CM7YC,"Yoga Burn and Power Yoga are really intense workouts - totally awesome.  - Yoga conditioning for athletes is good for a ""rest day""",1346803200,,130,4.6521739130434785
4261107,4,B0044CM7YC,"I appreciate the repetition and clear instruction in this video. I saw Rodney in an ad in my Pilates DVD and got interested. I was a bit skeptical because I don't want the ""religion"" or the spiritual side of Yoga. I choose to worship Jesus so I don't say or do some prayer poses. The exercise is challenging and effective!",1343088000,2,322,4.383333333333334
4261108,4,B0044CM7YC,"I've been a big fan of Rodney Yee's videos for a while now and this one is no exception.  Very gentle but strong work-outs that you really feel the benefits of the following day.  There are a couple of editing issues that were puzzling, but fortunately I was looking down before the first time I realized that the action on the DVD was behind the vocal instruction in a couple of section in the Yoga Burn.",1340496000,,405,4.315789473684211
4261109,4,B0044CM7YC,video is excelent just what I was looking for. if you are loooking for a slow pace exercise this is what you are looking for plus you get three videos in one.,1337904000,,158,3.96875
4261110,5,B0044CM7YC,I love all of the 3 1 hr segments but my favorite is power yoga. He is really good at explaining the postures and has such a calming voice.  I truly enjoy doing yoga with this DVD and am looking to buy more of his DVDs. This is such a value. Thank you.,1336089600,5,252,3.7547169811320753
4261111,3,B0044CM7YC,"I am a big fan of Rodney Yee's instruction. If you're just starting out, he gives some of the most detailed and helpful instruction on video, and I highly recommend this video series for new yogis. Intermediate/advanced yogis might not get much out of it. I do the first 45 mins of power yoga as my recovery workout after a long run, and enjoy it. Yoga for athletes is not challenging and throughout the videos, most of the postures will not be new to experienced practitioners.",1330473600,32,478,4.569767441860465
4261112,5,B0044CM7YC,"This DVD contains three 60 minute yoga workouts led by Rodney Yee.
