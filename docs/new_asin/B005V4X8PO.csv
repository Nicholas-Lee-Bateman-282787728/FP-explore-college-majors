4896546,5,B005V4X8PO,"I love French movies, particularly Amelie, so this caught my eye. I saw this movie on Amazon instant video for a few weeks before renting it. I watched the trailer and it looked adorable. I loved it - I had no idea the French have this concept of ""emotionals"" - or emotifs - that are highly emotional people. Such a cultural difference with America. The movie's French title is Les Emotifs Anonymes - not Romantics Anonymous - referring to this concept of the ""emotional"" needing support groups.

Yes, the movie is predictable, but it is charming, well acted, creative, and has beautiful sets and cinematography. I loved the two main characters and watching their tentative relationship strengthen over time. The supporting characters at the chocolate factory were also a joy, even if they were comically stock characters. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Amelie. It has that same joie de vivre and beautiful sets!",1333152000,,926,4.935897435897436
4896547,3,B005V4X8PO,"It was a cute movie to pass the time. It kinda reminded me of a decent TV movie back in the 80s. But the plot really didn't bring the movie back full circle in  the end and tie loose ends up, for me. But then again maybe that was intentional given the characters' personalities . . . or psychoses. :-) It was also interesting to see how many characters were in Amelie as well. And of course the subject made me hungry for Godiva's. Yum!",1328659200,4,436,4.129411764705883
4896548,4,B005V4X8PO,"ROMANTICS ANONYMOUS (Les &eacute;motifs anonymes) is a wonder bit of French fluff that may seem like a little love story on the surface, but has a lot to say about our current state of relationships.  Written (with Philippe Blasband) and directed by Jean-Pierre Am&eacute;ris this little film takes advantage of the  fine comedic talents of the two stars and brings a supporting cast of of actors to the table who demonstrate how fine cameo roles can be polished.

Ang&eacute;lique Delange (the perky, multitalented Isabelle Carr&eacute;) cannot cope with relating to people: she is a shy young student in a chocolate class taught by M. Mercier (Claude Aufaure) who rises to the top of her class as a chocolatier winning employment in the finest chocolate business in France when suddenly M. Mercier dies.  Ang&eacute;lique is without a job and is terrified of interviewing (she belongs to a group therapy session called Romantics Anonymous where the group shares their flaws in relating to people.  She sees and interview slot for a candy business owned by Jean-Ren&eacute; Van Den Hugde (Benot Poelvoorde) - a man who is terrified of women as he works through sessions with his therapist (St&eacute;phan Wojtowicz).  Ang&eacute;lique's interview goes well and she is hired on the spot - as a sales rep!

Through a series of trial and error Ang&eacute;lique wins the friendship of the small staff (Lorella Cravotta, Lise Lam&eacute;trie, Swann Arlaud, and Pierre Niney) who understand the business is going bankrupt and together they stage a lessons on chocolate making that results is the staff learning all the secrets for the now defunct Mercier Chocolates.  Ang&eacute;lique and  Jean-Ren&eacute; seem to find an attraction to each other but their emotional timidity prevents them from connecting until a big break comes:  the business is chosen to attend the chocolate prize competition and in the midst of the trip the two seem to overcome their handicaps.  But the future isn't assured until  Jean-Ren&eacute; attends Ang&eacute;lique's group therapy session, a place where they both must confront their feelings,  and from there on the film dashes into a fun French farce.

The film is in French with English subtitles and comes off like an uncorked bottle of fine champagne.  It is a fun, light, romantic little takeoff on how so many people must join group therapy just to relate to each other.  It bubbles!  Grady Harp, November 11",1321142400,26,2443,5.128787878787879

4896577,3,B005V4X8PO,"This is a cute little love story about two very nice but neurotic people who suffered their whole lives being afraid of ""Living Life"": Afraid to touch or shake hands with another person, afraid to be the center of attention (even in their professions as Professional Chocolate-Makers / Chocolatiers), afraid to date, afraid of intimate conversations, afraid---no, terrified---of commitment.  She attends a Support Group; he sees a Private Therapist.  What ties them together in perfection, is their mutual love---of chocolate! <3

  After many humorous ups & frustrating, silly downs, they finally hit it off.  But the ending definitely leaves you with an obvious ""To Be Continued"" conclusion.  Although I wouldn't have created an ending like the one chosen here, I still feel this is a feel-good movie that does have its stressful moments, but is still a very sweet love story that's worthwhile to watch in your favorite pajamas with a big bowl of buttered popcorn & a nice herbal tea (hot or cold).",1459555200,,1000,5.060975609756097

4896655,3,B005V4X8PO,"This movie starts very well. The premise is interesting and there are a couple big laughs early. (The first dinner scene is a Steve Martinesque screech, beautifully played by both leads.) But those big laughs led me to expect more and bigger laughs later, and the bigger laughs never came. Instead the movie becomes more sweet than funny.

The characters could have been made more complex, which I would have liked. The idea of two people with extreme shyness provides a lot of opportunity to show the characters growing and for the film to say something thoughtful about shyness or opening oneself up to people - the way much better films like ""Amelie"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" did. This movie didn't really try to say anything. Instead the characters end up together because of some happy accidents (and despite some unhappy accidents) and they don't really grow up that much.

Also, a couple interwoven subplots of the movie (the issue of whether the company goes bankrupt or succeeds, and the issue of whether the Angelique can continue to make the chocolates now that people know who she is) are not really tied up very tight. We're left to assume that everything will turn out all right. This movie is short (about 72 minutes) so I infer that some of these plot resolutions were left on the cutting room floor for some reason or other. Maybe they didn't work out in shooting. But the film feels incomplete without them.

Meanwhile, there is at least one scene in the movie that served no purpose whatsoever: the scene with Angelique's mother. It doesn't move the plot forward at all and it tells us nothing new about Angelique - and we never see the mother in the film again. So why is it in there?

Still, I liked this movie and rooted for the couple. This is a credit to the actors, who pull off the professionally-competent-but-socially-incompetent thing beautifully. Benoit Poelvoorde is really funny, and Isabelle Carre is both funny and heart-meltingly cute. The scenes where she gets worked up talking about chocolate (and forgets all her insecurities) were the best scenes in the movie. I wish the whole movie had been as strong as those scenes.

Some good moments and performances in this movie make it worth a rental. But it's probably not worth a purchase.",1444521600,,2282,4.767088607594936

I can relate to being very shy and not wanting to focus any attention on myself. OK , so I was 12 not 35. If I had hiccups or sneezed, the LAST thing I would do is open my mouth as wide as possible to make for the grandest attention getting sound. Well, this is just one of many minor issues that culminated in a large deficit of a sensible plot.

I give major kudos to the script and scenes involving the appreciation of chocolate. I rarely eat chocolate, but while traveling in Belgium I ate 2kilos straight up, it was that incredible. Hence, I imagine we are not having access in the States to a delectable treat with many fine layers. C'est Dommage!

I was confused with the English translation captions. For example, how does 'Romantic' translate to 'Overly Emotional'? There were many idiomatic phrases eliminated that would have provided an appreciation of unique and refreshing french expressions.

The greatly anticipated Secret Chef reveal was about as interesting as watching paint dry. I can't conceive of a Skype call presented in this manner without any initial skepticism. What happened to the Teacher identifying a face he never forgets??

The portrayal of phobias, anxiety and severe shyness in adulthood is a serious concern and should be treated with respect. I only found this film to incite crass humor, even using a support group, to extend the joke. It should not have been the crux of every attempt at humor.

The two leads were initially endearing but I grew weary of their continual breakdowns and farcical interactions. The ending provided a beautiful setting but far from a satisfying conclusion.

Will recommend for appreciating the fine intricacies of the french language and deep love of chocolate confections. Yumm!!",1427500800,,1790,4.887788778877888

4896776,5,B005V4X8PO,"Romance + chocolate + a lot of insecurity = A cute, Gallic bit of humorous entertainment. Don't confuse this with those old Doris Day and Rock Hudson comedic romps. While there is misunderstanding after misunderstanding, none is cheesy or forced.

Two very shy people, to the point of each wanting to just run as far away from real life as possible, meet and try to convince each other that they aren't totally fearful about actually living while risking being found out. With some outside help, as in a shrink and a support group, both are forced to do what they have always wanted to do but never believed they could.

Angelique (Isabelle Carr) and Jean-Ren (Benoit Poelvoorde)  are very human, albeit awkwardly bashful, as just two people who desperately want to but are afraid of getting close to each other. There are no LOL moments in Romantics Anonymous, only enjoyably humorous scenes which will entertain you and have you smiling and quietly cheering for the two of them. 5 Stars (In French with English subtitles)",1423699200,,1023,4.8342857142857145

I was surprised by (what I perceived as) the lack of chemistry between the two leading actors, and it was hard (again, for me) to root for their relationship. It seemed a bit forced. Some scenes were, I would argue, too uncomfortable to watch. There is merit to that in that it was an honest portrayal of their struggle, but it was too much for me personally, when I was expecting a light-hearted, fun date-night film.

Frankly, they those who gave it such low ratings have a lot in common with the typical movie critic.  Which is why, in my opinion, so few films like these get made, particularly in Hollywood, where sweet equals corny, and romantic equals empty-headed.  To Hollywood, SIDEWAYS, a film about an alcoholic covering for his sexaholic buddy is ""uplifting.""

Too many cynical, jaded gatekeepers keep films like these from getting made or from succeeding when they are made.  And that is too bad, as the many 4 and 5 star reviews show:  Hollywood is missing out on piles of gold and we who have hearts are missing out on more gems like this one.",1411084800,,896,4.620253164556962

The entire cast is likeable, including those in supporting or even minor roles. There are no bad guys, which is refreshing in itself. The two leads (Isabelle Carr and Benot Poelvoorde) are superb, and the four chocolate factory employees are wonderfully true to life. My only reservations would be that bizarre, incongruous scene with Angelique's mother, which seems to be accidentally spliced in from some other movie's cutting room floor and (more damaging still) the unsatisfying conclusion. I won't throw in a spoiler here, but in my opinion, there was no reason to go beyond the final, sweet reconciliation and show . . . well, everything that comes next. Far better left to the imagination. Take out those two egregious miscalculations, and you have a well-nigh perfect little film.",1398902400,,898,4.993333333333333

4896970,4,B005V4X8PO,"I really liked this movie.  Very cute.  I grew up in Europe, so maybe I'm used to a little more of this type of humor.  If I could, I would remove or lighten up three different parts, however.
#1 - really didn't need the part where Angelique was talking dirty with the chocolates.  Sure.  It's only a short part, but totally unnecessary in an otherwise cute family movie!
#2 - Maybe a little too much with the promiscuous mother - though I know it could have been much worse, and was somewhat necessary to possibly explain why Angelique is the way she is.
#3 - Angelique straddling Jean in the hotel room.  Wasn't necessary. Didn't add to the story.  The dialogue was necessary.

Probably in a perfect movie, I also would have shown the elopement ceremony somewhere where they could begin their lives without the onlookers who so completely mortified them.

I know this makes it sound like it wasn't a good movie.  It really was!  It's just irritating when they have all these 'little things' that don't contribute in a positive way to the story and are to many, offensive.",1396137600,4,1073,4.56544502617801

Two people, too shy to connect, find each other and overcome thier social awkwardness. The humor is mostly in the expresions and fumblig dialoge.

Here is a wonderful story about a man and a woman with problems but together they become an awsome force.  If they could just get past their problems.  It is a very nice tale and even though it is in french, it does have English sub-titles, it is a very nice story made into a wonderful movie. No I don't speak french, I'm trying to learn which is why I first rented then purchased this movie.  But it is entertaining and funny.  Remember, 80% of all communication is physical, so even if you don't know the languge, you understand anyway.  It is also a great learning tool.",1390953600,,682,4.330708661417323

4896991,4,B005V4X8PO,"With intertextual nods to LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG and CHOCOLAT (amongst others), ROMANTICS ANONYMOUS can hardly be said to be particularly original in terms of plot.  The nuances of chocolate and their relationship to human behavior have been well analyzed in all types of film, even CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  Nonetheless Jean-Pierre Am&eacute;ris' film is a charming comedy set in a provincial French town, in which Ang&eacute;lique Delange (Isabelle Carr&eacute;), a genius at chocolate making who passes herself off as a sales executive, and her boss, the gloriously named Jean-Ren&eacute; van den Hudge (Benoit Poelvoorde), repeatedly convince themselves that they are not in love with one another, while behaving in precisely the opposite way.  The problem is that both of them have a chronic lack of self-confidence.  The film offers them several opportunities to get together, but eventually stages the d&eacute;nouement during the meeting of a self-help group called Romantics Anonymous (hence the title).  Several of these sequences are cleverly filmed - for example the night when both of them are thrown together in the same hotel room during a chocolate-tasting convention.  Jean-Ren&eacute; tries every trick in the book to leave the room; having plucked up the courage to tell Ang&eacute;lique his feelings, he finds that she has run away.  The main actors offer winsome central performances, and the props also help define their natures.  Ang&eacute;lique's long woolly scarf, so Seventies in style, more than aptly sums her up.",1387238400,,1557,5.458333333333333

There's humor and great situations that allow the characters to shine.  The supporting characters are also fantastic, in how well they enhance the plot. In my opinion, this is an excellent film in which a simple and realistic story is executed to perfection.

4896993,4,B005V4X8PO,"Romantics Anonymous is a delightful,uncynical French trifle or bon-bon,whipped up like a new recipe for chocolate, but having very old ingredients. A sweet and witty romance set,appropriately, in a chocolate factory. Isabelle Carre is the shy young Angelique who goes to work for the nervy,struggling Benoit Poelvoorde. They are both cripplingly shy,he has a counsillor who sets him secret tasks to overcome his problems,she attends an Romantics Anonymous group to share her problems. She knows how to make chocolate to a high standard,but packages herself for the sales-woman role. A major outlet won't accept their old product any longer,so Angelique pretends to know a hermit who has a remedy for this disaster. They use his recipe and hey presto,they're winning prizes and selling again.

Two borderline dysfunctionals finding sugary solace together while trying to get the company back on track. Of course the old hermit who is the source of their success together,is really Love,with the softest centre of all. I think they must have watched some Ealing Comedies in the way they created their little world of chocolate.",1386720000,,1125,5.284916201117318

The man owns a small chocolate factory in deep financial trouble and goes to a therapist for similar emotional struggles.  The two go through awkward attempts to connect both personally and professionally until they finally realize how much they have to offer each other.  Perhaps what we perceive as arrogance in French people can sometimes be insecurity.,1385942400,,547,5.044444444444444

I liked this film but after making me care, and root for the home team, and be upset, and then delighted, and then anticipatory in the highest,  it failed miserably to deliver my payoff and instead gave me this stoopid idiotic ending. Maybe its a French thing; I mean they worship Jerry Lewis and Woody Allen, I know, right...

It's absolutely intelligently played and musically developed. It's light and cute. In addition The overlooked cast members make this movie STELLAR- the waiter, co workers, the group members. Delightful - because I'm of french descent actually grasping the cultural significance of the relationships and maybe why some underdeveloped movie watcher didn't rate this movie appropriately. 10/10 give credit where credits due( mini rant:  I've seen TERRIBLE AMERICAN FILMS THAT GOT HIGHER RATINGS THAT and DOES NOT MAKE SENSE)",1382227200,,804,4.955555555555556

However, if you want to laugh, be entertained and watch a fun rom-com, this is the one for you.  Yes, you have to read subtitles if you don't understand French.  For a good movie, that never bothers me.  The characters very much remind me of Raj and Lucy on Big Bang Theory - use them for backstory if you need more development.

There is no violence, no car crashes, not a single use of the F word or any references to bodily functions that other people seem to find hilarious.  This is a simple little film that has lovable characters and a sweet story line about two people who fall in love and happen to share a horrible case of shyness. The ending was unexpected but I thought it was fun.  The songs during the credits were wonderful...wish there were enough music in this film for an actual soundtrack for purchase.",1371168000,5,628,4.387931034482759

4897084,5,B005V4X8PO,"This movie came across as a sweet and funny comedy about two people who, due to their love of chocolate, find each other. It's set in the world of chocolate making... which gets my attention right away:-). I learned something along the way... that REALLY good chocolate isn't just about the confection... it's the undertone flavours that go with it... and the creativity of the person who makes it.

This movie also deals with how we can let our emotions get the best of us and keep us from enjoying what life has to offer. Les Emotifs Anonymes (its original French title) explores this through the world of chocolate. I'm sure Jean-Ren & Angelique did what many couples, after all the stress of planning the wedding, wanted to do: They ran away from the wedding... knowing they already had what was needed.

Anglique and Jean-Ren are such endearing characters, quirky and sweet and, despite their loneliness and social awkwardness, rather courageous and determined people.

The speaking cast is less than 20 people in the whole film, I believe.  However, this movie is so adorable in the way they have paired together these two ""emotional"" individuals.  Both seem to find the other a sophisticated and functional human being despite that both have crippling social anxieties.  The man is often shown at his therapist's office while the woman is often shown in her support group.

Some scenes end without any sort of explanation about how a character managed to leave a situation without clarifying some absurdity.  It is not a perfect film, and I wish they had left off the final scene.

That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and I cracked up laughing when the two characters went ""for a walk"".  It's worth watching.  Smile and enjoy!

sensibility that allows for smaller surprises within the established rom-com format.

Benoit Poelvorode (in a 180 degree turn from his famous, chilling performance in ""Man Bites Dog"") and Isabelle Carre are both, in
different ways, suffering from terrible shyness and fear of emotions and attention.  Yet, when she comes to work at his chocolate
company personality and fate keep conspiring to force them together, in spite of their fears.

This has a few laugh out loud moments, and lots of smile inducing ones.  In the end, it doesn't add up to more than what it is; a
blissfully compact (78 minutes) good hearted romantic comedy done with expertise, but in a world full of painful and dead
rom-coms, this is s very nice surprise.",1357516800,2,859,4.944444444444445

4897168,5,B005V4X8PO,"I recently had someone recommend this film and I had our library order a copy....now I think I would like to buy it.  If you are looking for a light, romantic comedy that is cleverly written and wonderfully acted and don't mind reading French subtitles (unless of course you speak French) you will probably really enjoy this film as I did.  I knew nothing about it, so I didn't go in with any preconceived notions and with a romantic comedy I never really expect anything but a happy ending and a fun story to follow, so I loved the film.

The premise is two painfully shy and therapy going singles meet when Angelique applies for a position at a Chocolate Company, thinking it is for the position of Chocolatier.  To her surprise she is hired then dismayed when she realizes that the position is one of a salesperson, too shy to explain that she doesn't want the position she amps herself up giving herself little pep talks and heads out to try to sell chocolate, meanwhile her boss, Jean Rene takes the advice of his therapist and asks Angelique out and their date is quite hilarious as they navigate the situations that arise.  Angelique has a secret about her prior career and plans to try to help the nearly bankrupt chocolate company try to change their line of goods to save the company, all while she and Jean Rene realize that they are falling in love.

Predictable?  Yeah, so what, I love a good, warm-hearted, feel good movie and this did it for me.  Charming and funny with excellent acting, I would highly recommend.  Overall, a lovely little movie!",1354665600,,1562,4.56989247311828

4897170,4,B005V4X8PO,"This is a romantic comedy in French about two emotionally handicapped people who find life filled with challenges that would go unnoticed by most of us. One can only wonder what sort of influences in their lives would make people so emotionally handicapped as to prevent them from engaging in what would be thought of as normal situations and relationships.

To their credit they are both in therapy, either group as in the case of Ang&eacute;lique Delange, a talented chocolate maker, or individual, as in the case of Jean-Ren&eacute; Van Den Hugde, the owner of a nearly bankrupt chocolate factory, and seeking to reduce or eliminate their symptoms.

As fate would have it, they are thrown together at a critical juncture in their lives and discover possibilities that they could not have imagined. This story of finding each other and trying to find themselves results in a tender, sometimes frustrating, love story that will leave you smiling.

While some sections are rather contrived, the overall effect is touching and permits the viewer to develop feelings of concern for both parties. While it was hard for me to relate to the problems they had I could sympathize, at least to some degree, with their efforts to rise above their personal challenges and forge a relationship that would be of great benefit to both of them.

""Les motifs anonymes"" is a goofy little 2010 French romantic comedy (English captions) about two painfully shy chocolate makers. It is sweet (...smile...), predictable and absolutely loaded with nuts... er ... I mean clichs. This means we have no doubt as to how it will end, but know we'll enjoy the journey.

Our two leads are both so shy he is in therapy and she attends sessions much like AA or NA, but hers is called ""Romantics Anonymous.""

We enjoy:
  * Benot Poelvoorde (""My Worst Nightmare"") is Jean-Ren van Den Hugde (the ""g"" is silent), a pathologically shy owner of a chocolate factory. His company is going broke, his name is always mispronounced and he sees a psychologist regularly, but he hires her on the spot to be his company's new outside sales rep.
  * Isabelle Carr (''He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"") is Anglique Delange, a brilliant and original candy maker who is ""The Hermit,"" an anonymous maker of boutique chocolates. She hides behind anonymity because meeting people face-to-face makes her faint; the elderly distributor of her chocolates has died so she needs a new job. She is NOT a good choice for an outside sales rep.
  * Lorella Cravotta (""Amlie"") is Magda, a long-time employee in the chocolate factory who is sad to see her nice employer's business going under.
  * Lise Lamtrie(""What War May Bring"") is Suzanne, another canny employee who can see that the newly hired outside sales rep looks very, very tasty to her boss.
  * Stphan Wojtowicz (""The Hedgehog"") is a psychologist who assigns our hero exercises designed to help him learn how to interact more easily with others.

Between our two leads shuffling and stammering their way into mutual attraction, the therapist's haywire recommendations, and the group therapy sessions, it's a wonder anyone keeps his or her sanity; but we enjoy every step along the way.

The lead characters are very likable. As are the supporting characters.  It is beautifully made and it keeps a very 'light and bright' atmosphere throughout. The storyline is entertaining and different. Not your average 'meet and fall in love' movie.

We found ourselves laughing several times throughout the movie.

Since it is rated NR for now, I will let you know there is no nudity. There is one semi-sex scene in the movie when the lead character walks into her apartment and two visitors are using her apartment. No nudity, but a few seconds of sexual noise and action.

The question is, will their passion for chocolate- and their growing passion for each other- overcome their painful shyness?

4897175,5,B005V4X8PO,"Romantics Anonymous is one of the funniest and most likable movies I've seen in ages.  This French comedy centers around two oddball loners, each carrying around their own baggage of emotional hang-ups and relational insecurity, and their inevitable love connection.  Angelique meets Jean-Rene when she accepts a job at his failing chocolate factory.  She is desperate for work but tremendously ill-at-ease around others just as Jean-Rene himself is making a last ditch hiring effort to save his business but can barely handle the simple social demands of interviewing applicants, answering the phone, speaking to strangers, etc.  The story is not particularly inventive and you know the end from the beginning, but oh the journey is such fun!  What makes Romantics Anonymous succeed so joyously is the superb acting by the leads.  Both manage to create tremendously sympathetic characters with subtle performances that rely on small mannerisms, quietly awkward pauses and hiccups, and nearly restrained facial expressions that capture perfectly two individuals barely hanging on while trying to appear as normal as possible.  The dialogue is also excellent and witty, using just the right words to communicate the simultaneous discomfort and longing our protagonists share. There are numerous laugh-out-loud moments and the whole experience is heartwarming and sweet.  This is a movie that will likely fly under nearly everyone's radar, but what a shame.

The story itself is predictable but it is so funny in a subtle French way that I was laughing out loud during the whole thing.  There were moments, especially towards the end when it seemed like a Woody Allen film....but better....The shy, shlubby man and the naive sweet girl could have come from a number of his films.  During the scene where he is in the car, chasing her, and slinking down in his seat to avoid being seen, I could picture Woody. And again in the restaurant when he kept changing shirts.  But this fellow did it with much less cutesiness than Allen does and thus preserved my love for him.  Strangely, in the car scene I could see a young Mia Farrow in the heroine. There's a sweetness and innocence in this film that Allen tries for but hasn't accomplished since Annie Hall.  May this director age more gracefully.

Isabelle Carre, who plays the shy young chocolate maker is totally delightful.  Benoit Poelvoorde, her eqally shy boss, is very good in his role. The supporting cast, too, is wonderful.  I loved the boys in the bakery.

I think the title suffers in the English translation.  I hope it doesn't discourage people from watching it. It's a real charmer.",1340496000,,1401,4.582329317269076
4897177,5,B005V4X8PO,"Exceedingly rare for me to be worked up over a modern romantic comedy. So much has been lost or forgotten by the American film industry that most attempts coming out of Hollywood incorporate elements of other genres just to attract an audience. And irrespective of the mandatory high profile talent, slick marketing and overplayed sentimental chicanery - they invariably fail.

Leave it to the French to show how it's done.

Tells the story of Jean-Rne and Anglique, a pair of wallflowers who have two things in common - a deep love of chocolate and an intense inability to foment any kind of meaningful human relationship. Each suffers from shyness so intense that Anglique passes out when any situation causes even a mild rise in her blood pressure and Jean-Rne's constant companion is a business briefcase filled with extra shirts due to uncontrollable sweating.

A quiet beauty, Anglique has an amazing ability to create some of the most delicate and tasty chocolate treats. But she's incapable of even the mildest interaction with other people, so she chooses to hide behind the facde of a more famous chef. Despite the lack of recognition or respect, for her it's perfection; allowing her to be a chocolatier while remaining completely free from any faint-inducing situations. It's a happy, if solitary, life that she leads for seven years - until the sad unexpected passing of her friend and professional front.

She's finally forced to enter a world of unavoidable human contact. With the help of a support group of similarly afflicted people bolstering her inner fortitude, she takes her first steps out of a sheltered lonely existence. And the perfect opportunity has arisen - a job opening at a small out-of-the-way chocolate company.

Jean-Rne helms a once grand compagnie de chocolat, sadly now only a shallow shell of its former glory. Because he's psychologically adamant to any alteration in the patterns of his existence - it also means he's incapable of change. But change is coming whether he wants it or not. Due to falling sales, the company and its loyal long-time employees are on the brink being thrown to the streets. They're desperate. So, in a last ditch attempt to stave off bankruptcy, he's opted to hire a sales rep to hawk their products.

Guess who shows up to apply?

As each character tries to take those first daunting steps back into Life, watching them face their fears, it's the equivalent of asking an acrophobic to walk a high wire without a net - pretty darn scary. But their blossoming romance is just so sweet and their personal risks so high, it yields a wonderfully tender and excruciatingly funny film as Jean-Rne and Anglique take those awesome leaps of faith for love.

Personal Notes:

- Rented because of Benot Poelvoorde, whom I first screened in another absolutely fantastic comedy - '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nothing-To-Declare/dp/B005DUNPUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nothing To Declare</a>'. If you enjoy 'Anonymous', I strongly urge you to take a chance on 'Declare'.

- Unfortunately, I can already see some pathetic Hollywood-ized version completely gutting this amazing film. They'll do some PowerPoint presentations, pay tons to consultants for focus groups made up of donut-gobbling non-cinephiles, hire ridiculously overpaid talent, and utterly destroy the magic that is this production. So predictable it's sad.",1333756800,3,3419,5.256880733944954
