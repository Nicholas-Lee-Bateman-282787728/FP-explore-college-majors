7816677,5,6301903420,"This thing needs to come out on DVD! It has everything you'd want in a video on Brazil at the World Cup Finals (it covers up to 1986). The other thing I love about this is it has what I consider the two most insanely creative plays Pele ever did--both coincidentally misses.

Both are from the 1970 World Cup Finals. One has Pele attempting to lob the keeper from beyond the halfway line. He misses the post by inches.
The other is an unreal dummy he sells the keeper that also results in an oh-so-close miss. This move is pure genius and you'll be replaying it over and over.

Anyway, this video just oozes with incredible skill and flair of those great Brazil sides (mainly the creme de la creme 1970 side and the unlucky 1982 one). Even so I loved seeing Rivellino from 1978 and Careca from 1986.",1314230400,,799,4.355704697986577
7816678,1,6301903420,I am still waiting for the product to arrive.  I sent several messages to the seller and never received a response.  This is the worse feeling ever to have funds withdrawn from my checking account without receiving the merchandise.  I am not sure if I will ever make purchases from Amazon in the future.,1231286400,,303,4.574074074074074
7816679,5,6301903420,"I was a ten year old soccer maniac back in Cumbria England in 1970, and I had to beg my father to let me stay up late to watch the World Cup games live (England is five hours ahead of Mexico, so evening games were a nightmare to try to stay awake for!) Nevertheless, when Brazil were playing I sneaked a few cups of coffee and the problem was solved (until I hit my thirties of course---bloody Starbucks/Dunkin' Donuts!) I have never before or since seen anything like that 1970 Brazil team----every ball I kicked in the schoolyard or out in the fields with my pals was kicked not by me, but by Rivelino, Gerson, Tostao, and of course king of 'em all, Edson arantes do Nasciemento, Pele. If you don't love soccer and you're wondering what all the fuss is about, get this video. Brazil 1970 were like the Mantle/Maris Yankees, the Edmonton Oilers with Gretzky and the gang, the Celtics at their VERY best, the 1986 Bears. You must know what I mean by now. This is how the game was meant to be played.",991094400,17,999,4.347593582887701
7816680,5,6301903420,"Soccer is the worlds game. Everyone's favorite team after their home country is Brazil. This video and it's remarkable footage is an admirable homage to the Brazilian teams and the stars therein. Everyone knows of Pele but this video will show you the talents of Didi, Garrinchia, Zico, Rivelino, Socrates,.... and many more. Something in Brazil (perhaps the water) allows their player to have better dribbling, passing, and shooting skills than any other countries players. This video is worth it just for the rare Pele footage, but buy it for the others you may not know nearly as well.",976665600,9,588,4.94949494949495
7816681,5,6301903420,"This video is great because it shows some highlights from the greatest teams ever in the World Cup. We see the awesome, free-flowing Brazilians like Pele, Garrincha, Carlos Alberto, Rivelino etc etc. What a shame that football is not played like this today. The emphasis was on attack, attack and attack, and that is why some of the best goals you will ever see are on this video. Not only from Brazilians. I like this video because it is not biased heavily towards Brazil, and we also see some great goals from Hungary, England, Sweden and Italy in classic games played against Brazil. This is the best sporting video I have ever seen, and I love some of the English commentators as well!",973728000,25,689,4.609756097560975
7816682,5,6301903420,"If you are a Brazilian soccer fan this is a must buy,if not a fan the chances are very high that you will become a soccer fan after watching this video. It contains some of the best action involving Brazilian players  including Pele,Jairzinho,Rivelino and company from the legendary 1970 team  and others like Socrates,Zico etc. Watch the Samba Magic in full flow and  take a trip down memory lane.",959731200,11,398,4.739130434782608
7816683,5,6301903420,"This video summarize the history of the best soccer players in the whole world. Brazilains are the best players, and this video had given me a lot of old and new stuff about these famous players.",942105600,,195,4.444444444444445
