8323688,1,B00007H00C,"My star rating is based upon the poor product description that Amazon.com has for this movie. I took a chance an ordered this product, but Vasili Rabshtyna is correct in that there are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. I'm not sure where Thierry Rabaud purchased his copy but I suspect it wasn't from Amazon.com, at least not the one here in the USA. It looks like the UK Amazon.com has the PAL region 2 encoding version of this product, which does have English subtitles.

So, unless you speak French, DO NOT PURCHACE THIS PRODUCT!",1095033600,5,520,4.6521739130434785
8323689,1,B00007H00C,"These are  a very good movies, but the description to this particular product is wrong. If you want to enjoy these movies and don't speak french-don't buy them! Because the movies are in French and yes they are subtitled as described, but subtitled in French!!! I tried to return DVD's back to Amazon, but they say that even though the movie is in French, it is still SUBTITLED so I can understand it and can't return it because of lack in description.",1087171200,6,452,4.512195121951219
8323690,5,B00007H00C,"Is these DVDs has English subtitles?
My wife is American and doesn't speak Frnach, actually she prefer to read subtitles than listen to a dubbing in French.
Thanks for the info.
Est ce que ces DVDs ont des soustitres en Anglais?
Ma femme est Americaine est ne parle pas Francais, en fait elle prefaire lire des sous titres en Anglais que d'ecouter un doublage en Anglais.
Merci pour ces renseignements.
