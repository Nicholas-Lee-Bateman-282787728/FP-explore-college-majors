8189237,5,B000P6R5NE,"Showed this video to our New York Club and they loved it.  The Chrysler Building has always been my favorite NYC building and now I know why.  The care taken in building it, the love of art, the attention to detail are amazing.",1413417600,,227,4.255813953488372
8189238,5,B000P6R5NE,"This History Channel production, part of the ""Modern Marvels"" series, features the Chrysler Building in New York City. The Modern Marvels series is generally good and this segment is a good example of showing both the history and the ""nuts and bolts"" aspect of a subject.

The Chrysler Building started as a concept in the 1920's by architect William van Alen who was not known for designing large buildings. When Walter Chrysler, the auto tycoon and founder of Chrysler Corp., bought the project, van Alen was given free reign to design the tallest and most ornate building in the world. The DVD points out the competition with the architects of the Manhattan Bank building, also under construction at the same time, for the tallest building in the world - a competition the Chrysler Building would win and hold for only 11 months.

The DVD does an excellent job of explaining the construction challenges and techniques as well as show the viewer the beauty of the building's art deco decoration. I enjoyed the footage of the brick work, the stainless steel work as well as the wood and stainless trim, the ceiling and wall murals. The stainless steel eagles, ""radiator caps"" and ""pineapples"" are really amazing! Buildings of today are so generic and bland whereas the Chrysler Building was created by men who were more than simply workmen - they were craftsmen with marvelous skills!

This is really a very good DVD about a New York landmark that stands as American art and architecture pinnacle. I recommend this DVD with five stars.",1389398400,3,1536,4.8773946360153255

8189240,5,B000P6R5NE,"Love love love this dvd!  Tells you all about this building from it's conception to the finish, a fascinating story.  I am not going to tell you much more about it, it would spoil it for you.  I worked in the Chrysler Bldg for many years, and didn't know the first thing about it's history, all I knew was that it was gorgeous and unique. If you are interested in New York, or unusual structures, or just have a curious mind about anything and everything, this is for you. And at this price, who could resist?",1349740800,5,509,4.28125
8189241,3,B000P6R5NE,"I know the term ""Empire State Building"" more than I do ""Chrysler Building,"" but visually I would recognize the latter first.  This documentary is not afraid to admit that the building was only the tallest in the US for 11 months.  Luckily, no worker died in its construction.  When I think of the building, I think of its half-ovals.  I had no idea it had eagles on it at all.  The work does not end with the building's completion; that happened in the middle of the documentary.  Getting a 1920s building to be desirable to space renters at the turn of the millenium (sp?) took up a huge chunk of the discussion.  When I think of this building, I think of a 1960s Spiderman spinning around it, but the work does not speak about cultural references to the edifice.  I must admit that as a Chicagoan, the installment in this series on the Sears Tower kept my attention more than this installment.  Perhaps this work would be enjoyed most by New Yorkers.",1212364800,6,952,4.488372093023256
