8418564,1,B0019N8BLW,Why?  Why?  Why won't amazon make a good deal for the 3 movies...why is it cheaper to buy each movie individually??  Why hasn't this been fixed after months and months of being posted and people commenting....??  Ridiculousness!,1247011200,5,228,5.081081081081081
8418565,1,B0019N8BLW,"These have got to be a mistake, all of these new Amazon Blu-ray bundles with only 3 movies for $98.99... 28 Days Later & 28 Weeks Later are great movies and The Hills Have Eyes 2 is okay but no one, I repeat no one will buy these 3 movies for this price when they can be bought for $19.99 each...

How does something fall through the cracks like this @ a great place like Amazon?",1240876800,11,379,3.986842105263158
