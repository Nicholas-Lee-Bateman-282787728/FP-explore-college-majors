8319806,4,B001LUH0TC,I have had a very enjoyable time learning the dance in this video.  Due to the fact that I have had several years of belly dance classes the moves were almost all ones I was very familiar with and it took very little time to pick up the choreography.  My only disappointment is that I would like some instruction on how to put together my own choreography for a drum solo and that is what I hoped to gain from this video but did not.,1389139200,,433,4.08235294117647
8319807,4,B001LUH0TC,This is a great instructional video for drum solos.  She goes through different moves with the drums and then combines the moves into a quick combination.  I thought it was nicely done.,1355356800,,185,4.75
8319808,5,B001LUH0TC,"This Drum Solo with Bahaia was a lot of fun!  This was easy enough for me to learn as an advanced beginner/beginning intermediate bellydancer, and challenging enough to keep it all interesting and enjoyable.  Bahaia teaches all of the moves you will learn for the final choreography and then drills them. Then she breaks down the different parts of the choreography and practices them along with you.  60 minutes of dance just flew by, and I broke a sweat too!  Bahaia has an intelligent, sensual, down to earth teaching style. She breaks moves down so that they are easy to learn. She has a calm voice and mannerism. She is mature, elegant, and sensual. And her cueing is very good too.",1317945600,,687,4.652892561983471
8319809,2,B001LUH0TC,"I was not completely thrilled with this DVD. I had high expectations from the reviews I read, however it was not at all what I had expected. She gave very little instruction as she was teaching the combination, I was concentrating on one move and she slipped in another before I knew it. It is a good reference dvd but not good for instructional.",1300147200,,346,4.421875
8319810,5,B001LUH0TC,"Finally a drum solo that is for every belly dancer, not only advanced dancers. The movements used by Bahaia are basic to intermediate ( hip drops, shoulder shimmies, hip shimmies, chasses, etc...) and beautifully combined to form a pleasant choreography which is not too long or complicated. The instruction is very clear and there is a bonus performance at the end. Excellent!",1240444800,7,377,5.096774193548387
8319811,4,B001LUH0TC,"This is a review of one of the newest releases from Cheeky Girls Productions - 1-2-3 Drum Solo with Bahaia.

This is one of the best beginner drum solo DVDs I have seen.  It does an excellent job of describing and drilling the movements, and then the simple choreography is demonstrated in 6 sections, each with 3 opportunities to practice.  This drum solo choreography includes three different types of shimmies, and creative use of directional changes to spice up the hip and chest articulations.  Best of all, the choreography is very adaptable.  I learned the initial choreography and have already come up with some more advanced variations and ornamentation, so that I could use this choreography in my own shows.

The DVD begins with technique practice.  Bahaia explains the muscle dynamics and body positioning needed to execute the movements, and then the student has ample opportunities to practice it to movements, with variations.  This section contained 9 different techniques, including the Saidi hip drop, the choo-choo shimmy, and the 3/4 shimmy.  Next, the choreography put these movements together, with Bahaia facing towards a mirror, so you could see both the front and the back of the movements.  The DVD ends with a live performance in costume.  Because of the way the choreography was taught, I have it completely memorized only having done the video once.  I loved the fact that the full choreography itself was repeated three times.  Often, a dancer completes an entire choreography video and only has the chance to do the whole thing once - or even not at all on some videos.

Cheeky Girls Productions is known for their excellent videography and this video is no different.  The camera angle choices and panning made it very easy to follow.  As dancers themselves, the producers understand that the audience can't get enough practice, and that we love to see costumed performances by the instructor we're already inspired by.  This DVD also contains a number of extras, from a delightful performance by Bahaia to an Oriental composition, to descriptions and demonstrations of the drum rhythms used in this drum solo.  There is also the opportunity for extended practice and drilling of the technique without the instruction.

I would not shy away from recommending this video to beginner students.  For advanced students, the vast majority of the instruction would be review, although the choreography is cute - and the DVD footage of Bahaia is a nice to have.  Intermediate and Advanced Students may also enjoy Michelle Joyce's Pop, Lock, and Shimmy, which shares a similar format, but has more advanced combinations and movements.",1232236800,13,2658,5.078341013824885

8319813,5,B001LUH0TC,"I just have to rave about Bahaia!!  She has been an incredible teacher for me for the 5 years I've been studying.  She has a whip-smart & sometimes saucy sense of humor that both encourages her students, while calming frustrated beginners.  She makes us all laugh, while impressing on us a love and diligence in the study of the art of bellydance.

She is infinitely energetic, and her enthusiasm is contagious.  I see from the youtube videos, she demonstrates and teaches many things we have learned in class.  This dvd can't help but be extremely helpful and fun for dancers of all skill levels.",1227312000,3,597,4.6923076923076925
