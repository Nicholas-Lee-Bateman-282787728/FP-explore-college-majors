This book gave me insight into relationships, what the ""needs"" are of various people, male and female.  We are all different and we all have different expectations.  This program gives insight as to what others needs are as well as recognize our own and be able to share them with those around us.  Example: Some people need to HEAR ""I Love You"" rather than RECEIVE gifts or things.  Others feel loved with touch, whether it be  kiss or holding hands, etc.  Anyway, it is an excellent book, and have recommended it to my children, family, and friends.",1380067200,4,733,4.466165413533835

It is a very interesting self-discovery method and it's also interesting that a lot (most?) people mistakenly identify other people with their ""love language"".  You have to buy the DVD and find the Oprah program that Dr. Chapman appeared on to find out what I mean by that last statement.  Love the DVD!",1369699200,,514,4.483870967741935

Summary:
Dr. Chapman does a great job of creating a simple to understand way of making your partner feel more loved.
He breaks it down into the areas of life that we, as individuals, experience feeling love. What you'll learn is that each of us has a different balance of those languages of love.

COURSE EXAMPLES:
A couple examples of this are that some people feel loved with ""words of affirmation"" while others may feel love through ""acts of service"".

So, if the person who loves words always uses words, because that's what they like, on a person who responds to ""acts of service"", they are missing the target with their partner. The ""words of affirmation"" person can now adjust their way of loving by speaking their partners language and doing ... ""acts of service"".

This works the other way as well. An ""acts of service"" wife who cooks and cleans (acts of service) may need to adjust and speak ""words of affirmation"" to her partner and thank him verbally for the things he does for her. This man who only tells this wife she's great, will do better to jump in and clean dishes more often because she responds to acts of service.

Learning more about this has improved my relationship with my fiance in a very positive way.

Something to note is that the techniques can also be applied to business relationships as well as personal.
It reminds me of the book (I know this is a dvd review.), ""Who Moved My Cheese?"". It's simple, clear, and easy to implement.

Pros:
1) It's a clear recording of the seminar, so you can either watch or listen to it. I suggest watching it with your partner if possible.
2) He seems to be a genuinely loving therapist with real life experience he brings from his own marriage.
3) There are only five love languages, so it's easy to remember and think of during regular days of being busy.
4) It's only $15. For the positive shift watching might have in one's life, this is deal.
5) He's out to truly make a difference in the world.

Cons:
1) Some people may not like that he mentions God a few times. I am good with it. Just sharing this so people are prepared.

FOR SINGLE PEOPLE: I also recommend the ""The Five Love Languages: Singles Edition [Audio CD]"". This has some great ideas and techniques that will make dating and finding a match much easier.

For full disclosure, I am a dating and human behavior coach ( Inviting Mr. Right ), so it is even more important that this is a higher-quality learning tool I can suggest to clients.",1357603200,,2526,4.471739130434782
4081344,4,B0037FFC44,"I used this to counsel a couple getting married and they found it to be a great tool for them, it woke them up to a new and different understanding for each other. It is a good tool to use for everyone in a relationship.",1357257600,,220,3.911111111111111
4081345,5,B0037FFC44,This book is very helpful for bringing back that spark in your marriage. It is easy to get so busy you just assume things are ok but when you know your spouses love language you can be sure they really are feeling loved and you willtoo.

4081347,4,B0037FFC44,"The info is all here, but Gary plays to the camera too much and so his genuine down home personality doesn't quite come through. Once past that aspect, it is a very good DVD rendition of the book as well as his live lectures. It is laid out in sequences and will work for an evening or two couple's study.",1349568000,,305,4.1
4081348,2,B0037FFC44,"I expected to have at least a 30 minute video for each of the 5 love languages, plus other videos on the other chapters in Chapman's super excellent book.

Buy the book, read it, consume it, read it again and again, share it!

If you can get the video for $2.00, buy it.  Otherwise, the video is only one hour long and he covers introductory material, the test, the 5 Love Languages and conclusion material ALL IN ONE HOUR.  So, each love language only gets a few minutes.  For $13.00, you should get so much more!",1347926400,31,514,4.3125

That was a big plus for me.",1318809600,,364,4.140845070422535
4081351,5,B0037FFC44,"The 5 languages of love is very good. My Husband said it really made him do some thinking, and then he watched it again the next day. It is very direct and honest. I gave my sister and her husband a copy and have been circulating my copy around to others. I do strongly recomend this and do suggest the dvd because not everyone has time to read a book.",1316044800,,352,4.042857142857143
