I happily used MYOB Accounting up to version 10. Documentation was excellent and support was freely at hand. A move to the UK version was great until I had to deal with VAT.

FAR TOO SHORT ""FREE SUPPORT"" ALLOWANCE
Back in the USA I upgraded to Premiere Accounting 2009 which came with only 30 days of free support. A computer crash, transfer of a years accounting data and hours of pouring over on-line documentation led to a call for support after 90 days and an insistance on a $50 plus fee for supplying information that should have been clearly documented. The plan is clear -- suck you in with price and promises the cream you with support charges.  STAY AWAY!!!",1257552000,2,696,4.604838709677419
