collector & it's incredible. I saw
this tour at the old warehouse in
New Orleans & they killed! Gorham
had a broken leg but was great &
I was impress with Snowy White
despite the bad reviews he gets.
Chinatown was a great album &
this show rock with old classics
as well. Brian Downey is great
as always. The encore features
the demo version of Angel of
Death off of the Renegade LP
called 'disaster' on the label.
If you missed this tour or like
Thin Lizzy or good rock this is
the show for you. GREAT!",1249603200,,542,4.122641509433962
8012452,5,B0001GH4E8,"......this show is a PAL show, not NTSC as Amazon has listed in their descriptions of product. It was shot for the German show Rockpalast and pretty much anything coming out of Europe is PAL format, so make sure before ordering you have a PAL capable DVD player. This was shot during the Chinatown album tour and features Snowy White on guitar in addition to the usual suspects of Phil Lyontt, Scott Gorham and Brian Downey. Nice long set list that covers the earlier albums as well as the new album.",1212710400,4,500,4.5054945054945055
