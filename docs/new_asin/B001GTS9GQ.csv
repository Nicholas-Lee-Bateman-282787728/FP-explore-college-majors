Sadly, it turned out to be the same one I already had.  It's a Windows 95 platform so my classroom computer can't run it.  I thought by now there would have been an updated version because it's a wonderful program.

Now that I am an educator myself, I was pleasantly surprised to see that there is a Grammar Schoolhouse Rock DVD that I can play for my students.  The quality (video and audio) of the ""clips"" are very good and I find myself using the snippets from the songs to further reinforce the grammar concepts to my students. ( I'll start to sing ""a Noun. . .""  and they'll finish singing "" . . is a person, place ,or thing!"")
