174507,5,0983044376,"Thoroughly enjoyed. Was sorry to miss the screening when ""Run Free"" came through town; but so glad to have found it here on Amazon. While the story is about a special human who found his place on the planet, it also captures much of the essence about the roots and trajectory of the ultra-running movement. Names and faces different; but reminded of many I met in the 1980's and early 90's. Well done.",1457222400,3,401,4.506849315068493
174508,3,0983044376,"It was an interesting story of a reclusive runner who wanted to help a small tribe in Mexico.  However, it was slow moving, and some of the interviews with other elite runners, were just to ""talkie"", you get the feeling they just liked hearing themselves talk.",1456704000,,260,4.6521739130434785

7795152,3,0983044376,"It was a little too high and mighty.
The first thing: Micah True wasn't much of a boxer and that's o.k. I'm not either. His record according to Wikipedia was 9 wins - 11 losses. Two of the wins were by knockout. 9 of his losses were by knockout. The documentary would've been much more powerful (and honest) had it mentioned his boxing record. The story of him whooping two guys outside a bar rang sort of false, maybe it happened, maybe it didn't. maybe the two guy were really liquored up.
Secondly - his cause of death - this should've been brought up and discussed in much greater detail. PHIDIPPIDES CARDIOMYOPATHY is a very important thing for people to be familiar with. It doesn't affect all endurance athletes but it does affect some. Regular checkups are important. Again, he may not have had this, but it is suspected.
In the end it was an ok documentary, but it was about twenty minutes too long. Or maybe the last twenty minutes were too repetitive and could've been spent on something more important than 'remembrance gatherings' one right after the other - let's say PHIDIPPIDES CARDIOMYOPATHY.
In the end, I like Micah True.

Also, RUN FREE would make a GREAT subject for DOCUMENTARY NOW.",1518912000,,1204,4.652582159624413

7795155,5,0983044376,Great Story.  Truly inspiring.  This story and the Born to Run Story has changed my running and my life in general.,1498435200,,115,4.428571428571429
7795156,2,0983044376,"The movie spoiled the book, Born to Run. Run Free was too long  and felt like a corporate sell out  by those who wrote, directed and produced. Like many ultra races to date, the theme of running free is lost and has turned into over populated, commercialized corporate events with expensive entry fees,  goodie bags, t-shirts and giving awards to all pay the entry fee and participate regardless of performance.

Micah True slams Gold Corp. for mining practices in the canyon, who sponsored his event, but wears the event t-shirt throughout the race, a bit of hypocritical. In the book, Micha was  concerned over the exploitation of  Tarahumara, too bad that's exactly what the movie does.",1481932800,,689,4.896551724137931
7795157,1,0983044376,"Not so much about running. More about a bunch of tree huggers spouting their mantras. For example, a literal statement made in the video about rocks that you trip over in the trail, ""you have to become friends with the rocks and realize they want you to run on them."" Another statement when blanco dies talks about the trails he blessed with his feet.",1473379200,,351,4.5

7795159,5,0983044376,"Based on Caballo Blanco, a recluse who gave up his Western lifestyle and decided to live a simple lifestyle among a native tribe in the SW US. The story has been told in the book Born to Run but the documentary is so much better than the book. Providing interviews with Caballo Blanco, the race he founded, how it progressed over the years, the story of his life and the people he inspired, and ultimately his recent death. The documentary does this man and his legacy justice. As an ultrarunner I very much enjoyed the film but the story is touching and non-runners should be able to gleam from it a sense of awe and inspiration.",1471478400,5,630,4.439655172413793
7795160,5,0983044376,One of a kind. Read  the book.,1470787200,,30,3.2857142857142856
