8433111,5,B004KM2YLC,Great series. I love Martin Shaw as the Chief. Quite an intelligent series. Pity it ended after 5 seasons. He plays a Chief Constable of an Eastern County in England. Some interesting stories. Though I'm not sure a real CC would get so personally involved. the politics of the job are illuminating.,1477440000,,298,4.75

8433115,5,B004KM2YLC,"Loved Tim Pigott-Smith in the 1st and 2nd series; he's great.  Although I hated to see him go I already loved Martin Shaw from the George Gently series and the Judge John Deed Series.  If Tim had to leave, Martin Shaw was a brilliant replacement.  Karen Archer is great also; she holds her own against both these great strong characters/actors.  Can't wait to finish up with series 4 and 5.  I buy a lot of British detective/police tv series, because I am sick of American violent, bloody, crude tv. Way to go Brits!!  I might be viewing older shows but I get so wrapped-up in them when they are this good, that I forget what year it is!  This series did not disappoint.  Great stories.",1364860800,7,686,4.432
8433116,5,B004KM2YLC,"This is the UK import [Region 2, PAL] version of the complete Third Series.

Series three of this outstanding police procedural drama sees the role of Chief Constable passing from John Stafford (played by Tim Pigott-Smith) to former Metropolitan Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Cade (Martin Shaw The Professionals, Judge John Deed). This release contains all six episodes, originally transmitted in 1993. As John Stafford takes up a new position with Europol, Alan Cade replaces him as Chief Constable at Eastland, East Anglia; Anne Stewart continues as Cade s deputy. While Cade is every bit as capable as his predecessor, he finds that the challenge of frontline policing continues to be eclipsed by the pressure to manage ever-tighter budgets and justify expenditure. Sharing Stafford s tolerant but scrupulous approach, he also faces ongoing conflict with his superiors, and certain local politicians whose cavalier attitudes towards issues of civil liberties contrast sharply with his own.",1346630400,6,997,5.516339869281046
