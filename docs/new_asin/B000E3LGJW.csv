8105291,5,B000E3LGJW,"I was able to watch this video on my friends DVD player because his DVD player has Region 4 capability. When I mean Region, all DVD players have Regions, they're either Region ALL, Region Free, Region 1, Region 0 and Region 4. Since this video was made in Australia, it is Region 4 so that means if your DVD player is made for United States, it won't work. Your DVD player won't be able to play this video. Thats the only problem I have with this DVD. So if you buy this DVD, and live in the US, chances are you won't be able to watch this video. Other than that, after being able to watch it over a friends house, this video is great.",1216166400,,635,4.088
