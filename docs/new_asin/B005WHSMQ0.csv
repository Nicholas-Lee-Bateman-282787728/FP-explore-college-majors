I'm learning Spanish, and the fact they did this in contemporary Spanish is a great help.  In the intervening time, I can watch it on RTV internet, but at least I will have the ability later on to watch them on my own player.  This is a show that has a huge fan base, and justifiably.

Gracias!",1395532800,,472,4.131868131868132

This is my favorite series beacause it has a lot of action, drama, romance in other words it has everything and it is very well made. I cannot wait to see the third season.",1352246400,,263,4.176470588235294
