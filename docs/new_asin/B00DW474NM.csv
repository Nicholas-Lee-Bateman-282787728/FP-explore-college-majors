5860033,2,B00DW474NM,This TV series is great. Quality on this DVD is terrible and you need to watch a bunch of ads before watching any of the episodes in disc 1,1419724800,,139,3.8275862068965516

5860035,4,B00DW474NM,"This is right up there with Sopranos and Breaking bad...picture and sound quality are decent, grainy at sometimes and on a couple random parts throughout a couple episodes the audio sounds like it has a quiet echo, but not enough to give this masterpiece a negative review. Well worth the purchase until this gets put out on blue ray. I watched the entire series twice already and plan on watching it again years later",1397606400,,418,4.662162162162162
5860036,4,B00DW474NM,"My son liked this series. Good price & Quality! A different type of story of the under world of drugs, and other activities.  Series is in Spanish language.",1384646400,,156,4.571428571428571
5860037,5,B00DW474NM,"This is the last part of the original series about Pablo Escobar. Please be aware that I'm reviewing the 3 part dvd collection made in Mexico, which comes with English subtitles. Each set includes 5 discs, each containing five episodes from the series, with absolutely no bonuses aside of the english subtitles. As is, the episodes are uncut and uncensored, though in later episodes they've blanked out some of the swear words (something that has become the norm in tv novelas from South America).

As I've mentioned in previous reviews this is an extremely well-made tv series, that has already been sold all over the world. This is the true story of the Colombian drug kingpin who brought a whole country to its knees and finally ended miserably. As I've mentioned in previous reviews, some names have been changed, but checking on the Wikipedia page about the series you can easily see who is who in real life.

I highly recommend this series for its historical value and so that it serves as a lesson as to what a drug dealer's life is really like, as opposed to the over-glossed and glamorized versions we usually get from Hollywood. The best bet would be buying this three part dvd set from Distrimax which includes english subtitles, as opposed to the complete Colombian-made set, which not only is far more expensive, but doesn't include any subtitles.",1381017600,3,1360,4.8076923076923075
5860038,5,B00DW474NM,"I had found ""Part 2"" in the Spanish-language bin at Wal-Mart and was so intrigued that I found parts 1 and 3 here on Amazon. I was NOT disappointed. From what I understand, there were many artistic liberties taken, but regardless, it was still an interesting look into the life of an enigma wrapped in cheap clothing. How such a heartless animal could be such a devoted family man is beyond amazing. I believe this series would interest lovers of the crime-drama genre.",1379894400,2,469,4.662650602409639
5860039,5,B00DW474NM,"Again, this series is superior to anything of its kind. It's an easy 5 stars, 6 if it were possible.",1450828800,,100,4.05
5860040,1,B00DW474NM,It was sent to me in a broken box. The actual video was of poor quality and didn't work.,1450483200,,88,3.6842105263157894
5860041,3,B00DW474NM,"This is the International release. It is not the Columbian release.

They cut it from 113 episodes to 74.

So much is missing. Things seem to appear out of nowhere without explanation and there are many plot holes because of this.

Other than that, still a great series. Better than NARCOS by a longshot!

The plastic that holds the DVD's in place is cheap and breaks super easy.",1449964800,,379,4.529411764705882
