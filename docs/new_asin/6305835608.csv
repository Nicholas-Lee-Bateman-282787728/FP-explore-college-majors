7896329,4,6305835608,"Only bought the tape because Michael Nouri's in it. The guy going nutso throughout the movie made it hard to watch. I had to keep adjusting the volume because it got too loud and then I had to bring the volume back up so I could hear what they were saying. All in all, though, it is a good movie to watch. I also purchased the sequel to this movie but threw it away, it was horrible. It made no sense at all.",1310428800,,408,3.927710843373494
7896330,2,6305835608,"This film is a low budget film that stars Joey Travolta,and pop singer/know born-again christian, vanity. The story line is not to great and the acting is just ok. But the good thing is that it keeps you entertained and you see Vanity in one of her last performances, before her preaching days,also she does noy play the typical sexy vixen like she did in the past. The film is just ok.",994464000,3,386,4.375
