8009878,3,B0001BKBMU,"This was a made-for-TV movie. So you can't really expect too much. It was all right. Nothing great, but it works for a decent thriller. It start Judge Reinhold, Timothy Busfield, and Penelope Anne Miller. Basically, there's a killer implanting explosives into pacemakers. Miller is a surgeon with a shady past, Reinhold is the cop trying to stop this and Busfield is the killer. I'd say, if you can find it for a reasonable price go for it, but don't spend too much on it. It's the kind of movie I'd call a lazy Sunday movie. Kill some time, but that's about it.",1318464000,,562,4.466019417475728

I thought it was okay but, the acting seemed stilted and the story a bit too unbelievable.

Was it the worst thing I've seen this year? No not by a bit...
Would I go tell all my friends to go watch it? No not by a bit.",1187222400,3,438,3.8555555555555556
