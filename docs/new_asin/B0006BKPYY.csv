8041124,5,B0006BKPYY,"A superior video about the struggle for civil, human rights during the 1960s. Features Dr. Martin Luther King as well. Some reviews posted here say that it's not appropriate for Fourth and Fifth Grade students, but I disagree. With what many of them are able to review online, this video, in that context, is very appropriate. Has many teachable moments and leads to some enlightening discussions for students to share in--great, great video!",1432080000,,442,5.068493150684931
8041125,5,B0006BKPYY,"The single best film I have ever seen about the Montgomery Bus Boycott. A mixture of real footage, interviews, and dramatic recreations - it's a must in every classroom. A retired teacher, I bought it to show to my future grandchildren.",1428364800,,236,4.780487804878049
8041126,5,B0006BKPYY,"*Must see film* I wish it was available on dvd or even amazon prime. I'd like my children to watch it, but who has a vcr anymore?",1427241600,,129,3.814814814814815
8041127,5,B0006BKPYY,"Many folks believe that Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the person who STARTED the U.S. Civil Rights movement. This documentary film, with real footage collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center from all over the U.S.' major research and resource centers that specialize in archiving the U.S. Civil Rights movement's activities, is the very best one I have viewed (and I am a doctoral scholar in the field).

The actual people who were in Montgomery, ALA just before December 1st, 1955, when Rosa Parks' actions started the Montgomery Bus Boycott that lasted 381 days until mid-December 1956 when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down racist segregation are filmed, speak, and otherwise offer their own perspectives as witnesses to this important history. Thus, their truths are finally told and they are absolutely amazing.

""Mighty Times"" is about how a community came together to generate one of the most significant socio-cultural advances in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century. It was largely due to their efforts that the way was paved for the path towards the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The living relatives of Rosa Parks are in the film. The first words ever spoken by the man who became the leader of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, Rev. Dr. King, are pricelessly preserved on this film. It gives me chills just writing that, here and now~",1401494400,,1365,4.875
8041128,5,B0006BKPYY,7th graders enjoy this upbeat presentation of both reenactment and actual footage of key events in the civil rights movement. Narrated by kids as well as interviews with adults who knew Rosa Parks. Is video should be mandatory viewing In all schools. When will it be made into DVD?,1363046400,2,281,4.755102040816326
8041129,4,B0006BKPYY,"This is a very inspirational story of how one small voice can make a difference in the world. I found it very interesting and I was proud of the civil rights leaders and what they accomplished. I loved seeing the footage of Dr. King as well. However, most sources say it is appropriate for ""all ages"" and this is not the case. It shows multiple mob scenes with beatings and hose sprayings, a black dummy with a noose around its neck to encourage lynching, the KKK burning crosses, and photos and discussions of the bombings that occurred at the time...even to people's private homes.

In addition, it claims that Mrs. Park's 17-year old son was accused and tried for raping a white woman and it shows a black man being strapped into an electric chair. This is not appropriate for younger children. What's worse...it is not accurate. Mrs. Parks did not have any children.

There is at least one other, minor, piece of misinformation...it claims that Mrs. Parks trial for disturbing the peace only lasted 5 minutes (to emphasize the injustice, I guess) but most sources say it lasted 30 minutes. Makes you wonder what else is not accurate.

Overall an important piece of history, but not appropriate for children.",1361491200,,1211,4.757142857142857

8041131,5,B0006BKPYY,"This Emmy Award-winning documentary combines real footage, re-enactments, and interviews to tell the story of Rosa Parks from 1943 to the Supreme Court's striking down segregation in 1956. The soundtrack and editing are beautifully combined to create an engaging documentary.  My students were spellbound--there wasn't a sound in the room until the end when many clapped and cheered.  Make sure to preview the video before showing students; there are instances of mild adult language and use of a racial slur. This unrated film is appropriate for students in grades 6-12.",1134691200,7,571,5.333333333333333
8041132,5,B0006BKPYY,It is a must see film. To think that a Black woman in those times was able to stand up against the political machine and fight for what was right has got to be an inspiration to us all. DON'T MISS IT!!!,1130803200,3,202,3.8333333333333335
