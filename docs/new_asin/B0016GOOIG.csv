8262442,3,B0016GOOIG,"I was expecting an original DVD. Prices for original DVDs have gone down as Bollywood has become more accessible in the States. This DVD, albeit brand new, is pirated. The Shemaroo sticker has clearly been scanned. There are no hard feelings, however, as the print is good and the DVD is playable. It's a wonderful movie, but if only it could have been from the original manufacturer and not some bootlegger.",1451260800,,408,4.76056338028169
