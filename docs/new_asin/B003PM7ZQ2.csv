 I hope they release all the shows on DVD. There are many people who did enjoy this show.

 There are even shows out on DVD who didn't even make an entire season that they have released. I hope they put on any un-used episodes on the DVD as well. As well as some behind the scenes footage.",1091318400,7,484,3.9690721649484537

The Chris Isaak Show is one of the BEST shows to come along in a very long time. I subsribed to Showtime because of this show!
I want and will buy every DVD that is released. Here's hoping they release each season (in FULL) on DVD. Chris' music and acting leave me breathless after every episode...and wanting more...much much more!!! ;) (God bless ya' Chris! xxxooo)

5019745,5,B003PM7ZQ2,The show is such an awesome example of the killer combination of snappy writing and sensational music. It gives a bit of an insider peek into the music business and it never fails to make me laugh. They need to release both the first and the second seasons on DVD as soon as possible so more people can see the show and get ready for season three this fall!,1051574400,10,357,4.188405797101449

I wanted to turn my friend Bob on to The Christ Isaak Show because it was great and a show worth watching again. I tried to find the DVD's only to realize they still haven't been released.

5019749,5,B003PM7ZQ2,"Just negotiate a flat rate for your back catalogs already, record labels.  It'll help your catalog sales in this specific case, since all of the artists and the show itself largely appeal to the only demo that still PAYS for music (35+).  Everyone else has been robbing you blind since '99, so what possible difference does it make at this point?

5019753,5,B003PM7ZQ2,"I talked to Kenney Dale Johnson after a concert at the HOB in Chicago a few years ago.  He said that the reason the show hasn't been released is because it is virtually impossible (and/or prohibitively expensive) to get all of the record companies (representing all of the guest stars/singers) to sign releases that would allow the various songs to be used.  DVD is a different medium/format than the original broadcast on cable and there is a different contract for royalties, residuals, etc. governing the use of the music.

So...the RIAA sticks it to the common folk...again.  I would imagine even if all of the guests agreed to allow their music to be used gratis, the RIAA would fight it tooth and nail.",1334275200,15,708,4.7317073170731705

5019758,5,B003PM7ZQ2,"...Or, as the case may be, SF & LA, by way of Stockton... I wrote to Chris 2 or 3 years ago, and a nice lady from his office e-mailed me back that alas, they were being held over a barrel by owners of music publishing rights of various songs used in the show. They had no projection for when, and even if, the show would ever be released. In my case, it's the only thing I ever wanted to watch on Showtime, except for ""Penn & Teller's B.S.!"" The Isaak show was especially meaningful for those of us who've hung out at Bimbo's, and seen the real ""Dolfina, The Girl in the Fishbowl"" - that part of the show still blows me away!
But being on Showtime could be part of the catch, since a lot of people never even knew about the show. And by now it's such ancient history that Chris' people probably figure it would generate only modest sales. Meanwhile, the music royalties greed-heads likely see a killing and set their demands accordingly. From their perspective, it won't hurt them if the show isn't marketed; and if it was to be, and became a hit, they don't want to be caught not getting their ""fair"" share... (maybe someone can elucidate if I'm skewing the story somehow - who knows, there could be more to it than just business...).
But I've always thought it more sad than funny how the people that really benefit from those machinations are the fat cats like Metallica, who went after Napster, and Garth Brooks, who went after Wherehouse Records - for selling used CDs!(as well as the myriad lawyers and other ""suits""). Then the same Draconian pall almost finished Pandora a few years ago.
Well, I guess it looks like I have a reason to comb through those boxes of VHS tapes (many unmarked, of course), after all...",1309305600,9,1720,4.429022082018927

There are very few television series that are worth seeing again and again.  One was The West Wing (until the final season), another was Sports Night (written by the same guys that wrote The West Wing, imagine that!), and The Chris Isaak Show.  I kept telling everybody about it when it was on, hoping to help keep it on the air.  But of course, it was really TOO GOOD to keep.  I didn't even know who Chris Isaak was at the time (not much of a music fan but I do like most of his stuff), and the show stood up well even for a non-fan.

How old was Doogie Howser on the show - 13?  Is that the age bracket that's making these decisions?",1147305600,2,504,4.1020408163265305
5019798,5,B003PM7ZQ2,"The fact that the show lasted 3 seasons is a miracle! Usually shows that are witty, cerebrally funny and original (OK the Partridge Family did the band at home thing first) are just begging to be cancelled in a world where dogs like The War At Home, American Dad, Family Guy, and Joey get air time. The show is destined to be a cult classic, with everyone from Green Day to Barry Zito to Michael Buble guesting. It would be a great DVD release. I can only hope!",1137369600,4,461,4.25

reason they insist on play it during the day while I'm at work.

 I'm not much of a fan of Chris Isaak's music but I love the

show. I've only seen a few, and would like to see them in order.

Please release this show. I'm will to pay cash you know.

Some day, I'm sure, this show will make it to disc, but the agony of waiting is terrible.

So why do we have to endear this torture of not having the Chris Isaak show on DVD in widescreen,of course,Plus all the usual extras: outtakes,bios and spoof reels. There are those of us all across the globe WILLING to pay for this series release at any cost. I have seen him in concert numerous times and asked Chris himself about the show being released and he didn't really say anything except it was up to the ""big guys"".I still enjoy watching these shows I truly wish that there were more then three seasons. They were well written and put together. I do have all three seasons on vhs,plus a few promos on disc. But would love to have all seasons on disc and original air date order.

I promise to buy multiple copies (one for me, several for family, more for friends). What are we waiting for?

For those who haven't caught it on Showtime, the show's creative, witty, fun and just enjoyable to watch. It's refreshing, with excellent music and true character development. Well worth watching and owning.",1114819200,24,590,5.26595744680851

There seem to be zillions of us who would like to do nothing better than fork up our credit cards and buy the whole set yesterday. I got desperate and was looking at the promo disks on (an un-named auction site to comply with Amazon review policy), they were like $150 for 3 episodes, with plenty of bidders. There is $$ to be made here. What do you bet SHO is used to getting all the $$$ 'cause they own the content, but that's not the way it works this time since Chris & Sivertone write & perform the music. SHO needs to suck it up and put out the discs. They'll still get $$$. It's a win-win",1114646400,7,683,4.066666666666666

5019809,5,B003PM7ZQ2,"This is a refreshing show that blends comic timing, humor, and music into one enjoyable hour. The stars are natural and do not fit into the typical characters that abound on many shows that are currently airing.  There is no good reason that I can see as to why this show is not on DVD.  Is it a music license issue? How can newer shows with more music be released on DVD after one season? I hope the people who decide when to put his show on DVD do not wait too long. They may in fact risk losing fans of the show and or other shows that this company decides to release on DVD. It would be a shame to lose one of our best  cable tv shows that exsists today.

Saw his show during a free preview of Showtime, so I subscribed to Showtime. I faithfully recorded each episode on VHS, but only watched them once and recorded over them. Now I MUST have the DVD of the series. Showtime forget junk like the L word. Chris Isaak was almost like a reality show, watching the interaction amongst the team.

The man truly understands what ""real"" people are about. I never have to wonder if I will find an episode amusing, each one is a true reflection of humanity in all it's awkward nuances. Genius...marvelous,perfect,intriguing!!!!There also exsists an online petition to Viacom to release the show. We must get this released,it's been since never that anything has been this intelligent of a show. I've loved Chris for going on 2 decades, I think I've waited long enough. To the folks making the decisions..you're sitting on a goldmine and everyday you don't release it is money OUT OF YOUR POCKET!!!! I want Chris on dvd.
