4666644,3,B005ELVCKC,"When was it that amazon is charging for things that are actually realeased for free by the original cereators on youtube. Assassin's creed: Lineage was originally released by Ubisoft on youtube as a promotion for Assasin's creed II at 1080 p in a series of chapters. Before the game was released 2 years ago.

I can't believe this!!!

Unless Ubisoft has pulled down the video and offered through amazon this looks like a rip-off.",1321833600,5,429,4.783783783783784
4666645,2,B005ELVCKC,"I was very excited when i recieved this video in the mail as i am very much into the AC saga. The movie does have some rough lines and CG is noticable at times. It's not a big screen ""movie"" so it's somewhat expected. i opened the case put the movie in and sat back to relax and watch. I was severly let down when the movie came to an end just over 30 minutes. WARNING if you do not play or know much of anything about the game do not get the movie you will have wasted your money. Grant it the movie is a little behind where the game is but it really dropps you off expecting more. If you do know about and follow the game then dowload the movie for free, borrow it from a friend but i wouldn't pay for it. $8 for 30 minutes of movie it's not worth the money.",1321747200,6,760,3.8471337579617835
4666656,5,B005ELVCKC,This 30+ minute movie was better than the Hollywood Blockbuster movie !!!  The big budget movie suffered horribly from terrible pacing!!!  This movie however made the characters endearing & had much better timing than the big budget film.  I am not a gamer but I have friends who spend hours playing every version of this game & all of them agreed with me that the big budget film did not do the game justice & loved this film better than the big budget film.,1498003200,,459,4.440476190476191

4666658,5,B005ELVCKC,"This film gets bad reviews for being short when it's labeled a short film, and states the run time is 35 minutes. That's like watching The Little Mermaid and being upset because it's animated.

With that out of the way this film is brilliant. Do I wish it was longer? Hell yes! I would love for their to be a series on Netflix or HBO or STARZ....something. The film. Incorporates CGI back drops and sets with live action. It's done very well. Yes there are parts it's easy to tell but it's still a beautifully shot short film. It fills the gap before Ezio (our main hero of AC II) dones his father's hood. Costumes are gorgeous and straight from the game. Great story and solid film. Lots of extras to let the viewer go into the behind the scenes of the film and game.",1496361600,,768,4.296551724137931

I don't play the game so I am not really sure of the premise of the show other than political intrigue (then again, why else is there an assassin's guild....).  It is too bad that this won't turn into a series.  Even as an introductory video to the actual game, it was done in much better quality that many shows out there to view today.",1428364800,,503,4.197916666666667

4666725,4,B005ELVCKC,"Lineage provides the first live action Assassins footage and provided a higher quality viewing experience than expected.  The plot of the video seemed a little difficult to follow for my first viewing, but it worked well.  I was happy to see the character models in Assassin's Creed II are very directly based on the actors in the video.

Better yet, the bonus features of the game provided a decent look at the games available at the time and all were worth watching.",1370736000,,468,4.682926829268292

I'm not Assassin's Creed fan but when I saw the DVD movie I thought it would be an action flick - it's not. It's a 30 minute commercial for the game. I hope other game makers don't try this.

4666758,3,B005ELVCKC,"Originally developed as an online video prequel to the video game ASSASSIN'S CREED II, ASSASSIN'S CREED: LINEAGE was released in the fall of 2011 as a promotional tool for the release of the video game ASSASSIN'S CREED: REVELATIONS. The movie is a short film (about 33 minutes) that attempts to provide some back story to ASSASSIN'S CREED II. This is not an animated film; it is a live action movie. It follows Giovanni Auditore and his assignments and eventual framing that leads to his arrest and capture towards the beginning of ASSASSIN'S CREED II.

The filmmaking for ASSASSIN'S CREED: LINEAGE is fantastic. This is not an animated short, but a live action film. It's quite impressive. Most of the actors used are the same actors as they are in the video game and they are just as talented in the flesh as their voices are in the game. As explained in one of the extras on the DVD, the actors, costumes, and a few of the props are real, but everything else was created via green screen. Up to now, there hasn't been a short film like this that has used green screens so seamlessly and effectively. The technology is used so well that the scenes in the movie look as though they were physical locations shot on a studio lot.

The only real issue with ASSASSIN'S CREED: LINEAGE is that it was conceived as a marketing tool and not as a full-fledged production (short or otherwise). Therefore, there isn't very much of a story. The story that is there has a pre-determined stopping point. Also, though there is some character development, particular in Giovanni, it's not much. It would be interesting to see what the filmmakers for this production would do if they were given an original, full-length script. Fans of the ASSASSIN'S CREED games won't mind the brevity, but for a casual movie watcher, it's probably not the type of thing they are ever going to sit down and watch.

The DVD also includes a slew of extra features, though most are promotional materials for ASSASSIN'S CREED and ASSASSIN'S CREED II. Some of the extras include the short featurette entitled ""Making of Lineage"", a short motion-comic entitled ASSASSIN'S CREED: ASCENDANCE that features Cesare Borgia's rise to power; a short feature on the ""Making of Ascendance"";  a Q &A about the history of ASSASSIN'S CREED: LINEAGE and ASSASSIN'S CREED II; a bunch of ASSASSIN'S CREED and ASSASSIN'S CREED II trailers and tidbit, and an  ASSASSIN'S CREED: REVELATIONS trailer.

Overall, though ASSASSIN'S CREED: LINEAGE is a finely produce live action short, it's really just a supplement that only those who are fans of the series or those who have a serious interest in filmmaking will enjoy watching and/or owning.",1331078400,4,2684,4.836601307189542
4666759,1,B005ELVCKC,NOT A MOVIE 20 -25 MIN PREVIEW FOR GAME . ITS ACCTUALY? THE SAME PART OF ASC 2 AS WHEN THE GAME STARTS ITS AN INTO TO THE SECOND GAME????? WHATS THE POINT IT WAS OVER IN 20 MIN AND I WAS DISCUSTED!!!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY YOU CAN PROB GET THE VIDEO GAME FOR CHEAPER AND GET THE WHOLE STORY . WHAT A WASTE!!!!!,1329436800,6,316,3.803030303030303
4666760,4,B005ELVCKC,This is a well kept sleeper secret. Watching the movie was like playing the game with all the intricate details. I was pleasantly surprised. Looking forward to part 2. Definitely too short.,1327795200,,189,4.9375
4666761,5,B005ELVCKC,"Great back story to Ezio's history.  The film was Hollywood quality, it was only a shame it wasn't longer!  The makers of this film should be hired to make the motion picture!",1325203200,,175,4.4375
4666762,5,B005ELVCKC,This movie was awesome. It shows the story of Gioviani Auditore before Assassin's Creed 2. I recommend this for any Assassin's Creed fan.,1324598400,,137,5.0
4666763,4,B005ELVCKC,"Let me preface my review by first explaining why I have given it 4 stars instead of what probably should be 3 or 3.5. If the price were set the same as any other retail Blu-ray, it would be insulting and a waste of time for those who aren't into the Assassin's Creed universe but it's not - it's the exact right amount for how much footage there is on the disc.

If you're not a fan already, you probably don't care about all of the developer diaries and trailers for the first two games. Maybe they might spark some interest for those who are curious but it's really just all there to appease the fanbase. The real meat of this disc is the free-to-view-online Lineage motion picture (and I'm pretty sure you can find the making of online as well). If you just want to watch that online for free, by all means, visit the company's Facebook or Youtube pages but if you're a collector of having decent moviemaking examples on DVD/BD, it's not a bad thing to have in your library. The movie itself is short but good, telling a backstory that takes place just before the 2nd game that only adds to the series without spoiling anything.

I admit I'm biased and I mostly enjoyed the movie because I love the video game series it's based on but as someone who's studied film, I have to also state how impressed I am by two things. First, that it is good. Based on a video game and yet good at the same time! I can only imagine it's because Hollywood execs didn't play a part in its production and reducing it to a PG-13 Max Payne during the Renaissance. It feels as it's supposed to and that's refreshing. Secondly, and this is the thing that I herald more than anything about it, about 9% of this movie is real. The props and outfits are real but that's it. The backgrounds are generated from content in the game itself and the effects are all added in post and all of the sequences are shot completely in green rooms. The chairs are real but the table is green, the windowsill is green but there's diffused light coming from behind it, Giovanni is climbing a green rock wall and After Effects is used to track the camera movement to the pre-rendered wall done in Maya or whatever. Watching this movie and then watching the behind the scenes footage makes you wonder why they dropped the ball so hard on Sky Captain or Casshern. THIS is what can and should be done with an all green-screen movie.

Reviews of the film and how it's made aside, the disc gets a 4 because it's cheap and essential if you're a fan. If you're not a fan, well, there's still no reason for the average to be so low for something made this well. Find it online first and if you like it, consider having it between your copys of The Seven Samurai and Crank.",1323734400,9,2725,4.328767123287672

I'm so annoyed with myself for not reading the fine print! I've seen this on youtube for 'free'. I thought this was and extended version. I would love to see this in a full length movie.",1528070400,,313,4.147540983606557
