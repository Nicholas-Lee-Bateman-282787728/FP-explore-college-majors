326847,3,630133275X,"If you're a Godzilla completest, this is a must have but truth is this film falls very short coming after the masterpiece of Gojira and before the great fun of King Kong Vs Godzilla.  It's not a bad film but the effects and music are just not as good (blame that on rushed production), and to be perfectly honesty it's pretty much downhill after the big monster fight which actually happens in the middle of the film.  There's still some great shots and cinematography sprinkled in here and there, and finally the extras for this DVD are really enjoyable highlighted by a short bio on Mr. Godzilla himself Haruo Nakajima and the art of suit acting.",1476835200,,648,4.577586206896552

326849,4,630133275X,"This second Godzilla movie picks up shortly after the first, but, without giving anything away, the monster is not the same Godzilla. Also, it pits the titular monster against Anguirus, a mutated ankylosaurus, and Toho's second kaiju. Like its predecessor, this film serves as an allegory for the aftermath of the atomic bombs dropped at the end of World War II. Additionally, due to the filmmaker's clear understanding that they now had a franchise, it ends differently than the original movie in order to speed that process along. This edition of the DVD contains both the original Japanese film with English subtitles and the English-dubbed American cut of the film.",1469923200,,669,5.090909090909091

And as Daisuke Serizawa, the inventor of Oxygen Destroyer, is dead and his formula destroyed, they fear its DOOMSDAY for them.  There is no way to destroy Godzilla.  And as if thats not bad enough, a truckload of prisoners escape, causing an explosion massive enough to gain Godzillas attention.  Will no one save them from this scourge!?

The English version has been messed with drastically & edited with some really stupid additions which make no sense. The additions were added by an American director or something who thought he could make it better by changing monster names, monster roars,  and adding silly silly additional footage & stupid dialogue which was just plain tacky & stupid.

The characters are pretty obnoxious, and have very little identity. I also get the impression that some of the scenes would have been more dramatic in Japanese, than it was when dubbed in English (like when the scientist explains what Godzilla is).

326971,4,630133275X,"This is one of the funniest of the Bad ""Suitmation"" features from the Godzilla franchise. The acting is SO bad it's funny.
The writing is so crappy, you can tell when the translators were stumped on how to say something - it's almost Engrish! Not only that, they decided to tell SO much exposition, that there are a record number of closeups on A WALL SPEAKER announcing several mile-long announcements that help fill in the plot. Lots of unnecessary characters introduced and sequences that don't do anything for the plot - why the Convicts-Escaping sequence? Why the Business-Dinner sequence? This should be a primer on how NOT to write a script!
Adding to (or subtracting from, if you're expecting an actual GOOD film) this mix is the directing of the actual suitmation sequences. Unlike the more carefully directed episodes, these two rubber-suited characters look more like an episode of Mexican Wrestling than two giant reptilian foes. Really! The fight scenes go from the usual slow motions of (what should be) giant beasts, to rapid jumps and spins and some shots that look sped-up for effect!
The models are SO second-rate, you can see them tremble sometimes, and the couple of ""outer-space"" rockets in the opening setup actually have that wonderful ""Flash Gordon"" effect where the smoke drifts ""up"" somehow in ""outer space"".
It's always great to hear dramatic music and a slow closeup on some stoic Japanese actress trying to emulate ANY emotion.

""Godzilla Raids Again"" is the first direct sequel to the original Godzilla.
Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this movie is that it's also the first time Godzilla fights another giant monster - named Anguirus - while laying waste to the portside city of Osaka.
While not the best of all the Godzilla sequels, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" does at time has an inante campy charm that makes it fun to watch.  Or in other words, don't take this movie too seriously.

327028,3,630133275X,"The power of the first movie is lost in this sequel to the impactful Godzilla (1954)

Plot:
Two pilots stumble upon an island where they encounter the dreaded Godzilla along with a new monster called Anguirus (who are both in mid battle when they fall into the ocean and head for Osaka). Now the two towering monsters are roughing up the area while our two pilots and a group of scientists are trying to find a way to stop them.

Review:
It was okay, thats really the best overall feeling I can explain about how I felt about this film. The story is weaker and so are the characters (I got confused on whose was in a relationship with who at some points). The fights are decent (but some scenes of them fighting sped up made me laugh instead of grief at their horrid destruction). As said before the power is lost but as a film on its own it is still quite entertaining. Its shorter and more to the point that the original which is something I can agree with being a good idea. The first movie established what Godzilla is and in this sequel it brings him right out into the for front and says that ""that this is going to be the star of the movie""

Score:
Not as good as the first If anything it is sped up as much as most of the footage of Godzilla and Anguirus Fighting Which works for this movie but it isn't a marvel to listen to

Cinematography/Atmosphere:
The film is black and white but it does not have that same dark atmosphere which that Godzilla (1954) had plus the Cinematography isn't as horrific ether.

Bottom Line:
All this should scream STAY AWAY but if you want to be entertained for an hour and a half or so I recommend it. Although if you want to have a masterpiece and cant get the original out of your head then you might want to stay clear of this one. Also Anguirus is a cool monster but I do wish we got more of him. At least as much as we saw Godzilla.",1416960000,,1878,4.191135734072022

327030,4,630133275X,"Let me start by saying that there are ONLY two reasons to ever sit through the American version of Godzilla Raids Again:
1) to listen to the rather superb enentertaining and informative commentary from Steve Ryfie
2) to hear George Takei voice over the main character in one of his early acting roles, delivering the infamous ""BANANA OIL!"" line.

That being said, this is a great movie.  Nowhere near as good as the first,  but it's rare that a sequel ever is. No longer as somber and serious as the first, but not as kitschy as the later sequels, this movie falls somewhere in between with a decidedly melodramatic feel.

Also it should be noted that this is the first movie to showcase the idea of ""Godzilla vs another monster"", which would become a staple of the rest of the series.

In regard to the VS element,  one would be remiss not to discuss the actual fights.  In subsequent sequels the fights were all done in slow motion to give them that sensation of laborious massive action.  This movie shows the fights with the camera playing back extremely sped up. That gives the fights a more visceral frenetic frantic look, which adds to the viscous frenzied feel of the action (think documentary footage of sharks thrashing around).

Keeping in line with the original movie,  there is a strong human element to the story,  again centered around a romance.  It's a decent story and helps you feel for our main heroes as the action gets really serious by the end of the third act.

All in all, it's not an amazing movie.  But it's not a bad movie either.  Nowhere near as good as the first, but a good sequel that sets up the formula for many sequels to follow.

Hope you enjoy.",1415059200,,1682,4.5198675496688745

I watched it a little while on Prime Instant Video to see what all the fuss was about.
True, the English dubbing left something to be desired. That's usually the case with translations even to this day. I always choose to watch a foreign film in the original audio and suffer with the captions. You are guaranteed to lose nuances when not listening to the original. Often even entire meanings are lost. This one is not as bad as some howl about, but it does change a bit here and there.
To be fair, the English version DOES mention ""Gigantis"" (Godzilla) types being able to be resurrected by NUCLEAR fallout during a reading of a textbook in the beginning of the movie. Why ""Gigantis"" rather than ""Godzilla""? It appears to be simply treating the original ""Godzilla"" as a proper noun name for the 1st beast (Gojira) which everyone knows was killed off in the origanal ""Gojira"" movie which kicked off the whole genre. So it does make sense from their point of view. Later movies go back to calling them all ""Godzilla"" as if it is the  name for the entire sub species rather than Gigantis.
Anyway, the film is otherwise a treat for what it is. Don't over think it.",1413849600,,1210,4.45045045045045

327056,5,630133275X,"It is altogether fitting to compare this film. ""Godzilla Raids Again,"" with ""Invasion of the Astro Mnster"". Of course, one does not expect great art from one of these fantastic productions, but instead the indulgence of an acquired taste. Viewers, in general, who do not understand the enthusiasm for Godzilla, and the rest of the menagerie, would probably consider others who seem to take the films seriously at all, as suffering under some kind of mental deficiency. Well, be that as it may be...the in-crowd does not have to explain - just enjoy. Beside the lack of monster action, another objection to the ""Astro Monster"", is the high resolution and brilliant colors - which largely remove the ""dream-like"" quality captured by ""Godzilla Raids Again"" and similar earlier productions. One power of these earlier films is the grainy, black and white aspects induce a mental state akin to a ""Night Terror,"" where the partial paralysis of the logical, prefrontal lobes of the brain allows the irrational limbic system to generate so much delightful nonsense. ""Invasion of the Astro Monster"" does not have this power, but ""Godzilla Raids Again"" definitely does, and is therefore a completely different experience, where the skeptical point of view loses credence. Possibly, the creators of the Astro Monster either did not understand this aspect of the film's effects, or were catering to viewers who thought if a film were not in color, ""something was inferior,"" and not worth watching. A third possible analysis might be that the characters in the ""Godzilla Raids Again"" have  a child-like quality about them - much like that in myths and fairy tales: The men, impossible incons of virtue, and the women saturated with the sweetness of feminine simplicity, and doll-like beauty, traits no longer in vogue today. In ""Godzilla Raids Again""  is  a ballad sung to an audience of dancing teenagers. The photography, the melody, and the enchanting songstress create a moment of pure, innocent devotion - a touch not added to any of the subsequent Godzilla creations.  In summary, one might say the ""Astro Monster"" is enjoyable for the ""completist,"" but does not serve as the basis of convincing doubters of the charm of Monster Movies. Wheres, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" casts the creators at the peak of their creative abiities, who, in their youthful enthusiasm had an essence no longer accessible as they matured.",1412380800,,2406,5.098984771573604

A sequel to the 1954 Gojira made quickly and on a shoestring, it is no masterpiece, but it is still an interesting and engaging movie.  It has some flaws in logic and production, but what do you expect from a movie about giant reptiles that can't simply be blown to minced reptile with 1955 munitions?  The musical score by Masaru Sat is applied sparingly.  Not as lavish as Akira Ifukube's scoring of Gojira, but still quite good.

I don't recommend watching the American release version because Godzilla and Anguirus's roars are swiched and Godzillais called ""Gigantis"". And plus then there's the bad English dubbing. I watched it in the Japanese original version and I loved it! Its great, because you can actually see the emotion from the actors, rather than the dubbed in plain emotionless English dialogue. The acting really is good and the story is really suspenseful. The special features include a 14 minute look into the art of suit acting. Its really interesting.

Not as good as the original, but still a worthy and enjoyable sequel. I gave the film three stars on Netflix, but that was the American re-edit. This DVD includes both the American and Japanese edits, and the Japanese edit is by far the superior one. I liked the story, a good follow-up to the original, like the original it was  portrayed seriously, and the Japanese edit has some great performances in it; the redubbing on the American version was crap though. On the American version they even renamed Godzilla to Gigantis. But you get both versions here on this DVD.

Plot:

When two pilots make an emergency landing on an island, they encounter two giant monsters fighting with each other. One of these creatures appears to be Godzilla who was thought to have been destroyed. When the two pilots get back to civilization and inform the authorities, it is discovered that the creatures were Anguirus (a spiked-covered beast) and Gigantis (a creature of the same bread as Godzilla). Now Japan has not one but two monsters to contend with this time as Godzilla and Anguirus battle it out in the city of Osaka, destroying everything in their path.

In preparation for the immanent release of the new American Godzilla, I've decided to go back and watch a bunch of old Godzilla movies. Today's installment is Godzilla Raids Again

I didn't even really know this movie existed. I always thought it strange that Anguras didn't have a VS movie against Godzilla before he started showing up in all kinds of Godzilla VS (insert monster here) films but as much as I looked I couldn't find this mysterious film that I always knew MUST exist but could never find. Well, here it is, and for once I'm glad my younger self couldn't find this movie. Its awful. Absolutely and without question, awful. Normally its a general rule for me not to review any movie that I haven't finished, you know to give it a fair chance, but I just can't make myself go back downstairs and finish this piece of crap.

There's a fundamental difference between novels and movies this movie doesn't understand. See, in a novel we get exposition and narration because we can't see what the author wants us to see. He has to describe everything. In a movie though, we can see everything that's going on so narration becomes redundant and pointless. Whoever made this movie didn't get the memo though because THE WHOLE THING is told like a book on tape. Every single scene is narrated. Every action explained. Main character picks up the radio? Narrator tells us he picks up the radio. Godzilla attacks a city? Narrator tells us he's attacking the city. Instead of letting the visuals speak for themselves they decided to have a narrator speak for the visuals. Its not a movie, its a book on tape with moving pictures.

I love the original Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Ive been a huge Godzilla fan all my life. But this POS doesn't deserve the positive reviews it gets on Amazon. There's not a thing about it that's any good. The plot makes no sense, there are no characters to speak of, and to top it all off Godzilla doesn't even have the right roar. Why does his roar like Angarus? Why does none of the dialog make sense? Why do they reference back to the original movie and yet never actually call him Godzilla?

True blooded Godzilla fans will watch this movie regardless, so this is for all the non-fans who want to give Godzilla a shot. I know this is one of the few G films on netflix, but for the love of God stay away. Your first Godzilla film shouldn't be this horrible, horrible movie.",1399075200,,2633,4.546413502109704

Godzilla kills angulas within the first hour and osaka is destroyed. You can tell the dream team that made the famous godzilla movies of the 60s was NOT apart of this movie at all.

They don't seem to be friends, however, and their quarrel destroys half of Osaka.  Much less dark in tone than the first, but not as cartoony as the later films, this film is the first to feature Godzilla fighting another monster, (and you can tell, because the fights are pretty much two guys in rubber suits smacking each other and wrestling) which later became a trademark of the series.  It was also the last Godzilla film shot in black and white.  Though not as good as the first movie, it is still very enjoyable.

The dvd comes with both the American and Japanese versions of the film (with the American title ""Gigantis, The Fire Monster"" being changed) and has a few bonus features.  The picture and audio quality isn't too great, but it doesn't look bad.  The packaging is also very cool.  The case is very thin and opens like a book.  Inside the front cover is a rather nice picture of Anguirus, and on the disc are small outlines of each monster in the film.  It's an all-around attractive package, if that matters to any of you.

It's just great seeing it again after all these years and I have been around for a few years and watched a lot of the older movies on a black and white TV.

As for the story, the original story focuses on a pilot and his company as they are the first to discover the reborn Godzilla, and to their horror, a second beast, which they name Anguirus. And this time there's no Oxygen Destroyer and no genius scientist with a Deux Ex Machina to save the day! What are they going to do?

327359,3,630133275X,"In a rush to return Godzilla to the big screen, Toho producer Tomoyuki Tanaka would replace the great Ishiro Honda (who was busy on another project) with director Motoyoshi Oda. As a result, the hastily-written script and uninspired direction make this a far cry from the original, but GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN does begin the long-running trend of giant monster battles that would dominate the series from this point forward. Two fishing scouts discover a new Godzilla battling the spiny dinosaur Anguirus off of the coast of Japan, and it isn't long before the two creatures move their brawl to the mainland! GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN is a talky sequel that is bogged down by ineffectual characters and stagnant filming. No one seems overly surprised by Godzilla's presence, or affected by his destruction. When the canning company is destroyed in Osaka, the board simply moves camp Hokkaido and resume operations as if nothing ever happened. Shoichi Tsukioka takes over as the lead, but his uninvolvement with the military and lack of heroics make his presence unnecessary. The underlying threat of nuclear disaster is minimized as well, although the presence of a second Godzilla perpetuates the notion that as long as nuclear power persists, there will always be another Godzilla. Oda stretches scenes out well beyond their usefulness, especially in the final air raid against Godzilla. Oddly, he has also kept scenes that have clearly been filmed in double time, making for the unnaturally fast movements of his monsters. Eiji Tsuburaya and Akira Watanabe are the only real heroes here, coming through with more fantastic miniature work and winning costume designs for both Godzilla and his four-legged foe Anguirus. GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN is a victim of poor planning, but still serves as passable entertainment for monster movie fans.

I have two reviews for this film, I'll start off with the Eng Dub. I honestly don't no were to start, because I have so many complaints about the Eng version. I'am going to make this review as short as possible. Why did the Americans had to edit this film so badly is beyond me. I have only watched the Eng Dub twice, and will Never, Evvveeer!!! Watch it again! I'll be honest with you, if you plan to get this film. (This Goes Especially For Godzilla Fans!) Do Not! I Repeat, Do Not! Watch the Eng Dub. It is that bad, even if I'am a Big Godzilla Fan myself. The uncessecary schooling at the beginning, and the atrocious Eng Dub, makes you want to  do something else with your time. Off that subject, now for the Jap Dub. I have to say, I'll only go back, and watch this film because of two things. 1, I Love Godzilla!, and 2, I will only watch the Jap Dub version! Because, I guess during that period, there were still hidden agenda's between the Americans, and the Japenese. And I do completely understand that. But come on! Be reseasonable! If your gonna edit a film like that so pourly, why bother waste your time editing it at all. It may not have been a top notch Godzilla film, but come on! Thats just bieng cruel. Should've just kept in Japenese Dub, with japanese subtitles first hand. Then maybe, just maybe this film would've gotten a little bit more credit. Get this film solely for the Jap Dub version.

327425,3,630133275X,"Unlike its historic predecessor, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" (1955) is totally content with being a B-grade monster movie. On that level, the quickie sequel remains fairly entertaining. In fact, the production would have fared better if Toho invested a little more time and money. Though Eiji Tsuburaya's special effects run hot and cold, ""Raids Again"" delivers plenty of Godzilla for the buck.

327426,3,630133275X,"Overall, Godzilla Raids Again is a good monster film, and an oddly scary one, which also has more indelible nightmare images than any other Godzilla film in the series after the initial one. Could both versions have been better? Of course. The American one could have definitely cut Keye Luke's narration by 75% with no loss to the tale, and even an enhancement of it. But even that film is a nice bridge to later Godzilla films, with an odd dj vu feeling that it is to the original film what Son Of Kong was to the original King Kong, a quicky sequel made to capitalize on the first film's success, is definitely inferior, but, compared to later sequels, far better than its critics claim. This is especially true for the Japanese version, scripted by Shigeaki Hidaka, Shigeru Kayama, and Takeo Murata. The DVD treatment given to these films is a pleasure, even if it does not include computer enhancements, because too often these films are considered punch lines for condescending critics who will rave on about infinitely inferior films from folks like George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. They are not punch lines; they are interesting reminders of a past, just like the atomic monster films from the same era were, save that these films often featured more pathos and humor. Great art? No. Great entertainment? Yes. Deal with it.",1340236800,,1332,4.7956521739130435

327428,4,630133275X,"Let me state up front that the Japanese film is FAR superior to the Americanized version. This first sequel in the monsterous Godzilla franchise is an entertaining motion picture, but it doesn't quite measure up to the classic original. Yes it looks like the monsters are sumo wrestling in a cardboard Osaka, yes the other special-effects are below par, and yes the story is mediocre, but there are a few welcome tidbits of humor/daily life sprinkled in and the production is rich in Japanese culture. For such a rushed feature, the studio did a decent job on this film.

There's no way getting around it, the Americanized version is simply awful. Dreadfully awful. Being heavily edited with changed plot lines, too much spliced in stock footage, supremely corny dialouge, messed up sound effects, and very annoying (non-stop) narration, I found myself actually hoping the film would end as soon as possible (I'm sorry to say). Indeed, while watching it I thought this would be the perfect representation of an infamous Ed Wood ('Plan 9 From Outer Space') movie, if he had ever been given the helm of a Godzilla picture. Ugh!

For the price of this DVD, the value is obtained from the Japanese version alone. I'd recommend that even diehard G fans avoid the Americanized version as it is just terrible on all counts. It's really nice to have this somewhat obscure picture now available on DVD, as long as you stick with just the credible Japanese version (note: I am discounting the 'bonus' Americanized version - which would warrant 1 Star - for purposes of this review).",1332460800,,1572,4.840148698884758

327432,3,630133275X,"Unavailable to Godzilla fans for years and years in the United States, Classic Media finally releases Godzilla's second outing to DVD. The fact that this disc contains both the Japanese and US cuts give it an edge over previous releases, and allow younger fans of the character to catch up on both in one fell swoop. Unfortunately, the video quality on this release is marred by numerous problems with both versions, some on account of trying to cram the two cuts on the same disc. The audio fares much better thankfully, as do the extras, but the overall package leaves some to be desired from the first title in the self dubbed ""Toho Master Collection"" line. To be honest, I was hoping that the blemishes found on the video presentation of Classic Media's Gojira - Godzilla would be some rare early problems as the company worked toward turning over a new leaf as a firm one could expect for solid releases. Unfortunately, with this title, that doesn't seem to be the case. To be totally honest too, the video quality here is actually even worse than the company's second release of the 1954 classic, as the DVD displays a wide range of problems in its video presentation. Chief among these is simply the print damage present, including tons of grain during a number of scenes, scratches and some annoying light flickering. The English version is also plagued by some of these, although features far more scratches than the Japanese version does. Suffice to say, I'm not sure where Classic Media is getting some of these prints from, but if they are coming from Toho perhaps they should just opt to use the video feeds on the previously done region 2 DVDs from the company?Anyway, the problems don't stop there, as the Japanese version also features an unstable frame on a few occasions along with a brightness level that's too high and washes out some details. There is also a huge dilemma in the transfer process that occurs a little past the hour mark due to interlacing, causing details to look incredibly jarring in motion as seen here. Thankfully it only lasts a few minutes, although it's none too pleasant to experience all the same. To follow up on this, some have told me that the problem has been fixed for later issues of this disc, however, comparing my copy from 2006 with the one I recieved in February of 2007 generates the same results: 2006 vs. 2007. Reportedly, I just had some bad luck in the second copy, though, as apparently this has been fixed on the majority of releases. In regards to the US version, it fares even worse, as it was obviously heavily compressed in order to fit on the same DVD with the original Japanese version. This means one can expect a much softer look, as details are more blurred, while shimmering and other overt signs of compression are apparent. According to the audio commentary on this release, it seems that the DVD was originally going to be double sided, with each version on a different side. That plan seems to have fallen through, but at least the company had the foresight to heavily compress the US version as opposed to the original Japanese cut. As an interesting side note, if anyone is wondering how the title screen for the film is handled, it removes the ""Gigantis the Fire Monster"" part in favor of a new title card that displays ""Godzilla Raids Again"", as seen here. On the bright side, at least Godzilla Raids Again is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 in both versions. Godzilla Raids Again features two different mono audio tracks, one in Japanese and the other in English, both of which are attached their respective versions of the film. The quality of both isn't bad, although not perfect. The Japanese audio tends to fare much better, while the English dub isn't as clear as it could have been, but both are more than serviceable without much to raise complaint about. The Japanese version can be accompanied with, removable, English subtitles. After a lot of extras were withheld from the company's Gojira - Godzilla release, they finally make their way to the public via these later titles from Classic Media. As it turns out, it was a pretty good thing many of these features were delayed, as titles like this would have seemed very barebones without them (unless one wants to count the US version as an extra), considering even a trailer for the production is lacking. In terms of the added video content here, it's a short 14 minute documentary on suitmation for numerous Toho science fiction films done in the Showa era. The short provides a great deal of background on the actors behind the costumes, and is overall a very recommended feature. Next up is a short ""Poster Slide Show"", which isn't bad although the quick editing and close up pans get to be a little annoying. A feature that would have let the viewer browse through them at their own pace, instead of seeing them quickly shown over a minute's time, would have been much more preferable in this case. Finally, the last extra on this disc is an audio commentary for the US version of the film done by Steve Ryfle ""and friends."" The billing for the commentary might seem a little odd, but after hearing the track it's quite clear that nearly 70% of this is Ryfle talking, as he will ever so often ""pass the mike"" to another commentator like Ed Godziszewski who will throw in some more background information. Sadly, this commentary isn't nearly as good as the ones found on Gojira - Godzilla. Not to discredit it completely, of course, as it's still very informative. The problem is simply that Ryfle's attempts to riff the movie, sometimes in a style reminiscent to Mystery Science Theater 3000, tend to fall flat in their bid for humor. Still, due to the wealth of information present, this is still suggested listening for anyone with more than a passing interest in the title character. Bottom line, I'm sure many fans of the franchise are thrilled to finally see this movie, which has been out of print in the US for more than decade, but this certainly isn't the best release all the same.",1325635200,,6057,4.682926829268292
327463,3,630133275X,This is a follow up to the original 1954 Godzilla film. Godzilla isn't the same monster as in the original film but in the line of the same species.  A relative maybe? It's cool to see Angurius debut in this movie. He and Godzilla kick each others asses all over Japan. Godzilla eventually defeats him. I heard they used the wrong speed on the cameras when they were filming it. As you will see the monsters look like they have ADHD and are hyper as hell. With todays technology they probably could get the original film and correct this and release it on Blu-Ray.

Now obviously, as a dramatic piece and an excellent story about life and death 'Gojira' is the best of the series. However, if you take it in the strict sense of a monster movie, then this film comes out ahead. That's not to say that you won't also enjoy the drama and the few hints of comedy, I did because overall it's just an excellent film. This is the kind of Godzilla I know and love, playing the villain. The monster battles look somewhat like Sumo matches, but the film is so action packed and full of destruction that you won't mind that bit of goofiness. Without question this is more of a dark film though and there was a lot less dialogue than I expected. At least in the Japanese version, which are typically the only versions I will watch. If you want to really capture a performance of great emotion (fear, relief, happiness) then you need to be watching films in their original language.

It's also in Black and White and starts that long standing tradition of Godzilla duking it out with another giant monster, in this case Anguirus(look him up if you really wanna see what he looks like).  The fight scenes are a bit different here as they are done in a sped up stop motion animation at times.  Looks kinda cool, I wonder why it wasn't used again.
Well, Gigantis threatens Japan for a bit, but the showdown comes later on an arctic island as he fights a Japanese aerial assault.

Godzilla looks ""vampiric"" with his large fangs and pronounced teeth.

327506,4,630133275X,"The first of many sequels to the original Godzilla, this relatively obscure film suffers in comparison to its predecessor, yet still stands out as an innovative entry in the series. In 1955, Toho was just cutting its teeth in the daikaju genre, but managed to produce a film with some remarkable special effects work and atmospheric cinematography. Viewed in context, Godzilla Raids Again remains a treat for Godzilla fans.

Giant monster movie fans may remember this 1955 sequel to Godzilla, King of the Monsters, by its original American release title: Gigantis, the Fire Monster. This excellent Classic Media DVD release presents both the original Japanese version as well as the 1959 American release, and features an informative commentary by daikaiju authorities Steve Ryfle, Ed Godziszewski, and Stuart Galbraith IV.

Unlike the original Godzilla, which was a powerful allegory about the horrors of nuclear war, Godzilla Raids Again plays more as a standard 1950's monster-on-the-loose melodrama, and stands as the first in the cycle of monster-vs.-monster movies for which Toho is famous. However, the often-superb special effects and moody cinematography elevate this one well above most of its contemporaries. Godzilla's first foe, Angilas (who, over the course of the Godzilla series, became one of Toho's most popular daikaiju), makes a striking debut in this picture.

Unfortunately, the Americanization, supervised by Paul Schreibman, is a farce, and results in the entire production playing as unintentional camp. Flawed though it might be, the original Japanese version stands as a noteworthy entry in the Godzilla series, and is highly entertaining in its own right.",1265500800,,1683,5.4653846153846155

327508,4,630133275X,"Godzilla Raids Again has a few distinctive qualities: it was the first Godzilla sequel, the first to have Godzilla fight an adversary, the first to feature a score by Masaru Sato, and the last to be filmed in black and white.  Despite all this, it still suffers from sequelitis, probably due to its rushed, six-month production schedule.  After the first Godzilla was killed by the Oxygen Destroyer in the previous film, a new Godzilla is discovered battling another monster called Anguirus.  Unsuprisingly, the two end up duking it out in Osaka.  Godzilla ends up killing Anguirus (though he somehow reappared in three or four more Showa films) and for some reason heads to an icy island, where he battles the air force.

Godzilla Raids Again suffers from a bland love triangle and tedious sequences involving how the monsters are affecting the Japanese fishing industry.  Hiroshi Koizumi would go on to be a series regular and Takashi Shimura reprises his role as Dr. Yamane in a brief cameo.  The action sequences are okay, but the fight between Godzilla and Anguirus looks very odd due to the cinematographer under-cranking the camera instead of over-cranking it the way he should have (Eiji Tsuburaya liked this effect and kept it in for some bizarre reason).

That being said, the film has an effectively eerie mood thanks to its creepy, atmospheric score by the brilliant Masaru Sato (who would go on to score three more Godzilla films after this), and a script that takes the subject matter seriously.  While the grim, bleak tone of Honda's first film is mostly gone, Godzilla Raids Again is still a straight-faced sci-fi thriller without the camp of the later films.  While Gojira was done in the style of a disaster film, Godzilla Raids Again plays like a war movie, with Japan readying itself for an inevitable attack by unstoppable enemies.  The scenes with the coastal cities enforcing a blackout as Godzilla approaches are eerily effective, and bring back images of the Allies' conflict with Japan during WWII.  In addition, Godzilla's climactic battle with the air force is one of the best- and most original- action sequences of the Showa era.

If you want to see this, stick with the Japanese version, as the American version has Godzilla's roars replaced with Anguirus's (seriously) and has the voice actor for Tsukioka incessantly- and infuriatingly- narrating every tiny detail in the film, right down to what he's doing on camera!  The American version also adds pointless (not to mention idiotic) stock footage and replaces Masaru Sato's score with inferior stock music from Hollywood B-movies.  Godzilla Raids Again isn't a classic; it's talky and obviously inferior to the original, but at the same time it stands out from the rest of the early Godzilla films because of its unusual mood and tone.",1262908800,,2821,4.985074626865671
327509,3,630133275X,"If you watch ""Gojira"" the first movie featuring Godzilla, it's a much different film from most of the usual entries in this long running series. Instead of a monster smackdown where most of Tokyo gets destoryed, ""Gojira"" is a dark and sombre film showcasing the fears of the atomic age.

""Godzilla Raids Again"", the direct sequel to ""Gojira"" starts to take the series in a new direction. Godzilla comes back to Japan, this time accompanied by another large monster, Angilus. Kind of porcupine-like thing, walking on all fours and featuring a turtle-like shell covered in spikes. While these two begin slapping each other around Osaka, lots of fireballs erupt and miniatures get destroyed. ""Raids Again"" features a lighter tone than the first film and gives Godzilla (called Gigantus throughout this film though) a large adversary to fight..a keystone to almost all future entries in the series.

""Raids Again"" is a fun movie, that begins setting the tone for what is to come later in the series. One of the highlights of this film for me is the relationship between the two pilots, Shoichi Tsukioka and Koji Kobayashi. The two friends, both working for the same fishery, find themselves caught in the middle of the Godzilla madness. Their relationship as things unfold is one of the more entertaining aspects of the film, specifically the comic relief provided by Kobayashi.

I think the reason this is the ""forgotten"" Godzilla film is that it's probably has the most limited appeal to a Godzilla audience. Too serious a tone from the later entries in the series, but a much lighter tone than the first film. Add in that it's a black and white film, and you'll eliminate a good many folks as well.

327538,4,630133275X,"In 1954, a giant monster stomped onto the streets of Tokyo. Destroying buildings and causing lots of mayhem. After meeting a terrible fate with the oxygen destroyer, the beast known as Godzilla fell. But was Japan really declared safe? And if so, for how long? In 1955, the Toho Company produced a sequel to the hit monster movie 'Gojira'. That sequel was called 'Godzilla Raids Again'. Originally released in Japan as ""Godzilla's Counterattack,"" this is the second entry in the long running series. It's the first Godzilla movie to feature a battle between two monsters. In 1959, the film was released in the US under the title ""Gigantis the Fire Monster."" That was due to rights issues. Luckily, the folks over at Genius Products have given us fans the privilege of watching the movie in its original full form. If you're looking for a review on the 1959 English release of Godzilla Raids Again, then you're in the wrong place. The version of the movie I'm reviewing for you is the original Japanese cut, which is about 4 minutes longer than the American theatrical release.

In Godzilla Raids Again we follow two pilots named Tsukioka and Kobayashi. They are flying in planes to scout out schools of fish for a tuna cannery company. Kobayashi's plane malfunctions and is forced to land near Iwato Island. The island is an uninhabited strip of rocks formed by volcanic eruptions. In an attempt to save Kobayashi, Tsukioka lands his plane and finds him safe near the shore. The two pilots then face a horrible realization, as they witness a fight between two giant monsters. Tsukioka immediately recognizes one of the monsters in combat; It turns out to be Godzilla. Not the same monster that was killed, but a whole new Godzilla which bares the same looks as the one that destroyed Tokyo. The two monsters continue to fight and eventually fall into the ocean. Tsukioka and Kobayashi head back and report to the authorities in Osaka. There the two pilots were able to identify the other spiky creature as yet another monster that lived during the dinosaur era.

The monster is named ""Anguirus."" While doing research on Anguirus, the scientists learned that it's a monster that hates hostile creatures, which explains the intense rivalry between Anguirus and Godzilla. This is one of those Godzilla movies you may not have heard about. That's because it wasn't well received. 'Raids Again' is a rushed sequel that failed to satisfy many expectations upon its release (especially in the US). Although it is the third most-attended Godzilla film to date, it was poorly received by fans and critics alike. It was rushed to the theaters six months after the release of the first film. The movie suffered heavy editing in the United States, and was given a title change which took its focus off of Godzilla. With that said, it's pretty obvious why I found the Japanese cut to be a lot better. Although Godzilla Raids Again is not the most popular film in the franchise, I still enjoyed it for what it was. I'm not very picky when it comes to movies in this genre.

I did however find it to be a little long, which is my biggest complaint. Other than that, I found the movie to be pretty enjoyable. The American cut however is unwatchable. Don't bother wasting your time with the chopped up American version of the movie. Unless you want to see ""Gigantis"". For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, ""Gigantis"" is actually Godzilla's name in the US cut of the movie. This was to give the audience the impression that they were seeing a whole new monster. Scenes with Godzilla shooting fire was cut out, and the voice effects were changed. You can see why I'm telling you to stay away from that version. Stick to the original cut of the movie; you'll be pleasantly surprised. Anyway, what makes this movie good is the fact it's the first time we get to see Godzilla face another monster. As far as the action goes, this movie has just about everything. Explosions, destruction and a great battle between two foes.

The fight between Godzilla and Anguirus is remarkable and bloody near the end. The fight scenes are my favorite, not so much the story and pace. I personally believe that Godzilla Raids Again is almost as good as the first movie. ""Almost"" is the keyword, because it's still lacking in those other areas. Not to mention ""Raids Again"" doesn't carry the grim seriousness of the original. Still, it's a good movie that's been under looked over the years. Genius Products did a fantastic job with the re-release of Gojira. The company does another fine job here with this DVD. They've remastered the picture and sound, and added in a new featurette; plus a commentary track. In the featurette ""Art of Suit Acting,"" you get a brief history on the actors who wore the costumes. That's as far as the features go, there really isn't much in here. The DVD isn't jam packed with extras. Still, if you're looking to expand on your collection of monster movies, then you have to pick this movie.

327540,5,630133275X,I have been a fan of godzilla for many years. So when this rare picture was released i had to have it. Overall the original japanese version was better. It explained maney points that was left out of the american version. Also you get a better feel of the charaters. If you buy this picture you will be able to see and compare both versions. I watched the dubbed version out of intrest because i had never seen this movie and i was pleasently surprised that the original is better. I believe any true godzilla fan should get this movie.,1182902400,,536,4.37
327541,5,630133275X,"I had bought a low quality VHS of the English version of this a few years ago, and couln't believe they had dubbed Godzilla with the voice of Anguirus! I thought something was wrong with the tape. Anyway, this package with a substitled Japanese version, never seen in this county, as well as a better quality dubbed US version, gives an interesting comparison. I can only guess that either Toho did not authorize the US version, so they called Godzilla ""Gigantis"", and dubbed Anguirus's call to him as well, to avoid being sued, or for reasons unknown, Toho did not want the name Godzilla used. Another strange thing about this film is the fight scenes between the monsters:there is a lot of jerking, suggesting these  parts used stop motion, or they just speeded up the action.",1180310400,,778,4.720588235294118
327542,5,630133275X,"Wow! I'm impressed.

All these years I knew this fim as ""Gigantis:The Fire Monster""

All these years I was watching a complete farse. This is really a great Godzilla movie. It has such a dark overtone to it and the scenes at night when Godzilla is lurking in the bay have such an eerie silence to them that it actually comes across as nightmarish.

Godzilla looks great with his ugly teeth and the special effects are outstanding for that time period.

I am so glad that I got this. I had a VHS copy of ""Gigantis:The Fire Monster"" and I never really liked it. After viewing this film the way it was meant to be seen, this has rapidly become one of my favorite Godzilla films.

This is a movie for serious G-Fans. I would not recommend it to smaller kids because it moves a little slower than some of the later entries into the series such as ""Final Wars"" and ""GMK"".

I totally recommend it to all other fans of Godzilla and Japanese Monsters!

I have always liked Godzilla movies and after viewing this marvel, I only embrace the series all the more.

327574,4,630133275X,"For serious Godzilla fans, this is obviously one to order sight unseen. The first Godzilla sequel, which also includes the first ""Godzilla vs."" fight (against Anguirus), was never as popular on TV (in my memory) as a lot of the later sequels like Godzilla vs. Mothra and Destroy All Monsters.

It's definitely a quickie ""cash-in"" sequel but it's still a fun little piece of movie-monster history. This film is particularly notable for a (purported) accident which caused the fight scenes to be filmed in fast-motion instead of slow-motion. It actually looks pretty good, somewhat akin to the stop-motion animation in King Kong.

As with most Godzilla sequels, the plot is pretty light and non-sensical, and the monsters don't really go at it until pretty late in the movie, but it's a good time. Casual fans can skip this one, knowing they haven't missed anything essential, while hardcore Godzilla fans will eat it up.

Classic Media has done another great job of production and packaging, once again including the dubbed American version with the subtitled Japanese original. For this disc, they also include a short featurette on the history of the rubber monster suits and the actors who wore them. It's a somewhat rushed and breathless recitation of facts, names and dates, but still fairly interesting, and it's great to see these unsung heroes of the movies getting their due.",1179878400,,1383,5.03056768558952

Godzilla, King of the Monsters.  Both versions are included on this Toho Master Series dvd plus great extras including a fascinating audio commentary on the American version.

This was the first movie that was shot as sequel to the original godzilla.

I also thought I'd inform you that this is not the dvd formated version I'm review this is a quick time video format version of the movie that is broken up into 14 segment last about 2 to 6 minutes each that was download on two you tube a couple of years ago. I highly recommend you get the dvd and do not copy and paste the links on too your computer unless you have a really big hard drive of at least 5 gigabites in size or big these videos will take up alot of memory if you copy the whole movie it will take over 50 kilibites of your memoryy to paste one whole copy of the movie on your desktop if it's broken up in to segments.

Can the japanese forces once again save all of Japan and the rest of the world from otter destruction find out in the thrilling conclusion. Due to midl scifi action violence this movie might not be appropriate or may be questionable to kids under ten years of age depending on what there parents our guardians thinks is appropriate for them.

In addition for the American version Godzilla name was altered fromn goldzilla to Gigantisis for the american version then was changed back to godzilla for all the films that follow after it.

327580,5,630133275X,I'm rating the vid cause it requires a rating to post a comment...but I actually have a question for you all.  My two biggest complaints for the previously released Godzilla movie were one that fact that the Japanese version of the movie looked clean while the American version looked pretty bad.  I guess this is the way it should look though....however my second complaint is that the subtitles in the movie where really bad to read...almost needed a telescope to read them and they were kind of drowned out in parts of the movie so you couldn't see them in the picture.  Did they do anything to clean up the subtitles in these two current releases to make them easier to read? Normally I can read subtitles just fine in a movie with them in it...so it's not a genearal problem...just a specific problem with the subtitle in the previous Godzilla DVD.,1177113600,,853,4.598684210526316
327581,4,630133275X,"It's hard to review this disk, because it contains two different movies, the original Japanese version and the version as redubbed for American release.  I recommend watching the Japanese version and leaving the dubbed version to rot in silence.

There some flaws in the japanese version, due to the fact that it was made in a hurry to take advantage of the popularity of the first movie, but on the whole it is a fairly good movie, with a reasonably well developed plot.  To the science fiction fan, there seems to be a lot of time spent on developements that don't have much to do with Godzilla and his foe Anguiras, but it does have a lot to do with the relationship between the two heroes, Tuskioka and Kobayashi. there is also the matter of Godzilla's teeth.  As fans may know, there were actually two forms of Godzilla ""costumes"".  One is the rubber suit with an actor inside. In this movie, the actor had actually gone to work with the maker, and the suit for this movie was actually somewhat better than the one for the first movie. The suit was capable of better range of motion and, in my opinion, slightly better proportioned.

The other ""costume"" was, basically, a hand puppet showing only the head and neck.  Obviously, the people who designed the puppet did not see the suit.  The head was a different shape and the teeth stuck out in every direction but the right one.  No wonder Godzilla had such a temper!  No living animal possibly eat anything with those teeth. The poor creature was starving to death!

But with all these objections, the movie was not that bad.  Certainly not a classic like the first one, but good enough for an evenings entertainment.

But then somebody got up the idea of releasing an English language version, and everything went to pot.  The first plan, apparently was to produce a movie with English-speaking actors and insert action scenes from the Japanese film, much as had been done with the first movie, but that plan fell through.  So what they did was dub in an English narrative and english speach over the words of the actors. We know that the english speaking actors used were, in fact, very talented people because they were later to give outstanding performances (particularly George Takei), but no actor can give a good performance without a good script and the script for this show was a certified, lead plated, clunker.

You might remember that, at this time, science fiction and monster movies were mostly aimed at a teenage audience,and most teenagers were considered to have the maturity and comprehension level of a twelve year old with an IQ rating of 101.  But apparently the producers did not want to deal with such a highly intellectual group.  This script was aimed at ten year olds with an IQ of 90. For one thing, the narrator never stopped talking, even when there was nothing to say.  For another thing what was said was totally stupid. At one point, the hero, Tsukioka, shouts ""banana oil"", a slang term from the 1920's, which no teenager had ever heard, and so,had no idea what it meant.  Another thing that I found objectionable was the addition of a plot line which has the hero, Tsukioka, being afraid and trying to overcome his fear. The man had, according to the plot, served as a wartime combat pilot and had just performed a daring rescue of his buddy Kobayashi from an island occupied by two monsters known for the habit of burning planes out of the sky. Nobody familiar with the history of WWII would even think of accusing a Japanese combat pilot with cowardice. The whole concept was just too ignorant for words.

It is sad that the audio commentary is added only to the english version and is thus compelled to a discussion of the miserable voice-overs.

I suggest that you watch the Japanese language version with the subtitles, and leave the English dubbed version for ten year olds with IQ's below 90, though you will have to explain to them what ""banana oil"" means. ( the more modern term is ""codswollup"".)

One thing that almost makes the disk worth its price without the movie is the featurette Art Of Suit Acting. It's worth watching if only to learn who was inside those hot, stuff rubber suits.",1176768000,,4188,4.644986449864499
327582,4,630133275X,"The follow up to the 1954 classic, Godzilla Raids Again pretty much laid the ground work for the rest of the series.  I gave it a 4/5 only because the box is much smaller than the box for Gojira, and the picture above is quite decieving.  Normally I wouldn't care, but when it's being displayed atop my TV, it looks kinda funny with 2 different sized DVD cases.",1176681600,,361,4.294117647058823
327583,3,630133275X,"After the original movie that started the phenomenon, this movie was pretty much a disappointment. I have been waiting so long to see this movie since it never airs in the US and has never been released on DVD here. Sadly, I can see why this is never on TV, it lacks everything that the first movie had-including a deep storyline.

A man crashes on an island and is rescued, only to see Anguirus and Godzilla fighting for no real reason. The two go home and are followed by Godzilla and Anguirus to Japan, and the government tries to figure out a way to get rid of the two as they take their fight to the streets of the country. That is the major plot of the film, but that part of the story happens way too soon and the battle between the two monsters ends in the middle of the film and afterwards is just kind of dull. The battle between Anguirus and Godzilla was mediocre at best and nothing compared to the memorable fights such as Godzilla vs. Mothra or King Kong. The rest of the story  is about the people trying to figure out a way to get rid of Godzilla and none of that is interesting.

I give this film three stars for a few reasons, mainly being because this is the first movie to feature another monster in a Godzilla film. It may not be an exciting battle between the two, but it is historical since Godzilla finally had an enemy of his own size and was copied by every other monster movie to come afterwards. All of that is worth a star alone, but if not for that, this would get a two star rating for sure. I've been a fan of Godzilla since 1985, and I have to say that this was one of the worst sequels compared to the others. Watch it and you will agree. It was huge in its time, but it just doesn't compare to some of the later movies in the series.",1175904000,,1768,4.133720930232558
327624,3,630133275X,"I've just finished watching both the US & Japan versions of this film, as released on DVD 4/3/07. For those of you who've never seen this little piece of work, prepare thyselves, it could go one of a few different ways. I had never seen this pic but heard about it for years so buying it sight unseen was not a question.
GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN/GIGANTIS, FIRE MONSTER: Decent prints, certainly on par with the recent release of GODZILLA/GOJIRA in terms of print quality. I wasn't expecting the best prints given Toho hasn't had a print yet that screams to be called 'beautiful' of their old stuff. Well, MATANGO/ATTACK OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE is pretty dang good. Here, they're definitely watchable (each 4x3) with obvious clean up still needed, but for such a rare release in the US, it's hard to complain.
THE JP FILM: Wow....this was....eeerrrm....uh....... It almost felt like no one knew what to do with the Godzilla character or the story. It seems to drag......start up....slow down.....then go off onto some wacky escaped-convict-subplot  to get to a certain point in the story (sorry...no spoilers:-) What the....?!?! It did seem to retain SOME of the serious tone of the original but the execution was haphazard, I almost switched to the US on a few occasions, it resembled an Asian Ed Wood film so much (sorry, G' afficianados;-) And super speeded up-Keystone Cops monster battles. I had wondered what exactly it was that other reviewers were referring to and then I saw it. Talk about distracting. The film suddenly looks like it's a silent film when Godzilla and Anguirus begin battling, which is a shame, because there's quite a bit of it to watch and the suit is basically the original with more closeups (puppet & body) and clearer scenes. So those of you ever wishing you could see the original suit for longer periods of time, well, it's here.....kinda. I wish on all these newer releases they'd make the subtitles a little THICKER. They're sometimes hard to see no matter what color being so thinly cased fonts. These are no exception. Run time: 81:34.

US VERSION: This is the first time in my life with DVD's that I'd ever restarted a movie to watch it with the commentary on to get through it. I made it about 20-30 minutes into the dubbed version of the film before I couldn't take it anymore. I know it's ridiculous that a dubbed Japanese character should have a Western accent, but here the Japanese accent just sounded sooo stereotypically Asian...........which as an Asian myself sounds weird to say, but I think you'd have to watch the film to see what I mean for yourself. I kept expecting the guy to finish his lines saying ""Aaaah-soooo"" or ""me no like"" WTF!?............gaaaah!!!! Anyone moaning about the American remix of the original Godzilla with Burr, need only watch this remix to gain a new appreciation of THAT American recut. Run time: 79:00.

The commentary was nearly perfect....good mix of excellent info.....book read notes and even some parts that sounded...well ...spontaneous...lol. That was enjoyable. I'm not big on commentaries either, so this was a good thing. DUBBING PART 2:  I restarted the film because, well, I enjoy bad dubbing when in the mood, but this was a particular brand of atrocious that I was not prepared for ....maybe on another day...but not last night. The dubbing sounds read from a book, so when the character is raising their arm....the narrator TELLS YOU he's raising his arm....lol. What were they thinking!? lol.

THE CASE and INNARDS: The ads all over give you the impression it's the same thickness as the GOJIRA 2 -disc. This being one disc, the case is thinner, but same concept. The packaging is EXCELLENT. But you will need to keep the paper band around it if it is to stay closed long term as it does not clip shut on its own which is a downside. The case is a hard cardboard like the Gojira release....coated with the foiled print. Very nice..it's pretty cool looking in all of its movie poster-Japanese crowded text & description glory. And if you're a junkie for Japaneses packaging design, this is a treat. The case crackles open to reveal a clear tray to the right and a photo of Anguirus (SP? too early int the am to spellcheck lol) The disc is 2- films -on-one- style, graphics (i.el text only) on one side.  When the main menu pops up you choose one or the other (US/JP), then proceed to their individual menu. These look like the Gojira menus stylistically...i.e. poster art etc. Both have the 'ART OF SUIT ACTING'  special feature which was fun to watch if not a clinical assessment at times, but you can't go wrong. The host is QUITE informed and knows his stuff and the info is excellent, not to mention the behind the scenes photos is a treat to see. On this or the same day release of MOTHRA....there is NO BOOKLET ala GOJIRA.

OVERALL: For this price, and you now it's going to go down soon, this was a good buy, especially to see something otherwise only available on bootlegs on Ebay for us here in the US. I do wish they'd make these cases clip shut, because they will eventually not have the tightness to stay closed on their own and then dirt and junk will make their way in. But yes, overall.....cool purchase, and no complaints really, on this end. Casual fans may wanna rent this first though:-)",1175644800,,5297,4.700431034482759
327625,4,630133275X,"FILM HISTORY

This film made in 1955 is the very first sequel made to the original ""Gojira"" aka ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" in its US release. The film was rushed into production in order to capitalize on the popularity of the first film. In the US it was apparently released by a different film company than the first film, so the title was changed such that the word ""Godzilla"" didn't even appear in it! The US theatrical release title was ""Gigantis the Fire Monster."" The film has been released in the US under other titles over the years, such as ""The Return of Godzilla"" and as ""Godzilla Raids Again"" when it was on VHS tape. The original Japanese title was apparently, ""Gojira no gyakush"" or ""Gojira Strikes Again"" in English.

I am a huge Godzilla fan and have been since I was a small child, and in all the years I watched these films on TV, in the theater, and on home video, I've never seen this film broadcast on television and I apparently missed it when it was available on VHS. I didn't even know it existed until I saw it listed in Michael Weldon's Psychotronic Film Guide years ago. It seems that the fact that this film was not released in the US by the same company that released the original film has doomed this one to obscurity for an extremely long time. However, this situation is now corrected with the release of the film to DVD.

FILM SYNOPSIS, PRODUCTION TRIVIA, COMMENTS

As was stated in the original Gojira, it does turn out that there are more of these monstrous creatures in the sea than just the one Godzilla that was destroyed at the end of the first film. This film is more of a typical 1950s ""monster smash 'em up"" picture than the original film and less of a statement on nuclear horror. This sets the tone for many Godzilla pictures to come. There were also some apparent changes to the Gojira costume for this film as well as to the focus of the story. It also began the now long-standing tradition of matching Godzilla up with other monsters as Angiurus, sometimes called Anguilas, makes his debut in this film. He's the monster that looks a bit like an ankylosaur with a touch of giant hedgehog.

This film is a fairly average entry in the Godzilla series with little of the serious dramatic metaphors for and references to nuclear war so prevalent in the original Japanese version of the first film, but kaiju completists and monster movie fans will probably want to see this film because it has been so rarely seen or available up until now. The Japanese version is coherent, fairly well-acted and enjoyable. The American version is so hilariously bad that it's hugely entertaining as unintentional comedy! The American version is filled with nonsensical dialogue that has nothing to do with the original Japanese, it's loaded with cheesy stock footage that does not appear in the original film and it's voiced-over by a narrator (Keye Luke) that NEVER stops talking. Seriously, the American producer insisted on non-stop narration that never shuts up and insists on describing things that are clearly portrayed visually in the film. It's just terrible, but funny terrible! The American version would have been a great subject for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Be sure to listen to the commentary track on the American version after watching the film once without it. It's informative and highly entertaining.

DVD INFORMATION ON CONTENT INCLUDING EXTRA FEATURES

This DVD contains both the original 1955 Japanese version of the film as well as the 1959 American release dubbed in English. George Takei (Star Trek) and Keye Luke (Charlie Chan, Gremlins) both supplied voices for the English version. The subtitles for the uncut Japanese version were newly produced for this release. Like the recent excellent 2-disc DVD release of the original Gojira, this disc has commentary and featurettes by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski.

Note that the general release date for this DVD was originally supposed to be in November 2006, but it has been pushed back till spring 2007. This information comes directly from the godzillaondvd website, which is the official website of the producers of this DVD and the only place where the DVD can be purchased until general release.

I'm giving this release 3 stars for the movie and 5 stars for the great DVD treatment for a final rating of 4 stars. Monster flick fans can celebrate now that ""Godzilla Raids Again"" raids again!",1175472000,,4411,4.778215223097113

The American, quality wise, is the worse of the two. The film shows quite a bit of wear. Worth watching, though in order to see the differences between this and the FAR superior (story wise) Japanese version. The Japanese version of the film comes across as much more somber, moody and makes more sense (story wise).

  There is a comentary track on the American version that is a must listen and I hope CM will keep doing these on future releases. So far, this is ONLY available thru Classic Media's Godilla website. I ordered it right before Christmas and got it christmas eve. Highly reccomended for anyone interested in Godzilla films!",1167436800,,792,4.642857142857143

The english version is slightly poorer in quality than the Japanese version, but still not bad. Both films look better than the recent 2 disc release of gojira/godzilla, less dust etc on screen. It is not as good of a film as the first godzilla, but definately worth owning. I got mine on january 5th and there is no trace of the problems mentioned below. The commentary is only on the english version, it is very informative and you find out alot about why the film was disquised as a non-godzilla sequel in its US release as Gigantis, the fire monster. Highly reccomended for godzilla fans and sci-fi fans in general.

And, more films are on the way, the following films will be released:

GHIDORAH THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER, INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER/MONSTER ZERO, ALL MONSTERS ATTACK/GODZILLA'S REVENGE, and TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA. There are plans to follow the Godzilla DVDs with Toho's RODAN and WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS.

327630,4,630133275X,"If there was a technical flaw on the dvd stream during the last ten minutes, as some have reported, then the problem must have been fixed, because my disc played fine for the duration of the film. Since I had never actually heard of this movie until recently, I didn't have very high expectations for it, but it turned out to be a great Godzilla film. While not perfect, the positives far outweigh the negatives, making this a very enjoyable viewing experience.

The negatives: the human story revolves around two pilots, and while actors give adequete performances, the characters are not particularly interesting. There are some minor problems with the overall pacing of the film. Additionally, the film does not have the social relevance of the first movie. The nuclear war metaphore is virtually lost. The film transfer itself is grainy in some places, as was ""Gojira"". This did not really bother me, however. Its not in Tohoscope, but that's forgivable because this film was made before the debut of the widescreen format.

The positives: The special effects are amazing, especially considering when this film was made. I was particularly impressed with the flying effects. They are much more realistic than in later Godzilla films. Sure, some of the crashes still look fake by today's standards, but that's what you expect when watching a Godzilla film. I think that the effects were much better than in the first film. And having Godzilla actually do battle with another monster (creating the formula for EVERY Japanese monster movie to follow) really heightens the enjoyment. The tone of the film and the acting are still played seriously. There is none of the cheese which was established in ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"" (which, don't get me wrong, I LOVE).

All things considered, this is an excellent Godzilla film.",1165017600,,1819,4.996699669966997

327632,3,630133275X,"So while viewing the film after I had purchased it through Classic Media's website, I can see why they pushed the release date back. For some reason the quality of the video stream becomes real pixelated and wavy towards the end of the film, the BEST PART! It's annoying because it looks off and your eyes are doing a double take just to watch it. This is probably a flaw that they are going to correct for the Spring of next year, however I do not see why they were selling this item on their website even with the flaw. I am an editor at a film college and this irritates me because it is a simple ""rendering"" and ""compression"" issue that could have easily been fixed. Other than that, I have no complaints about this DVD. The quality of the film (except for the end) is good, the extra content (the art of suit acting, etc) is decent. I'm just glad it finally saw official release! I would wait until the film comes out next year because this flaw will probably be taken care of by then. Overall, an entertaining Godzilla film.

*NOTE*

The 3 out of 5 stars is due to the quality shift and the flaw towards the end of the film. This flaw is a biggie for me and takes me right out of the film. If not for the flaw I would've given it 4 out of 5.",1162944000,,1247,4.127572016460905

327655,4,630133275X,"FILM HISTORY
This film made in 1955 is the very first sequel made to the original ""Gojira"" aka ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" in its US release. The film was rushed into production in order to capitalize on the popularity of the first film. In the US it was apparently released by a different film company than the first film, so the title was changed such that the word ""Godzilla"" didn't even appear in it! The US theatrical release title was ""Gigantis the Fire Monster."" The film has been released in the US under other titles over the years, such as ""The Return of Godzilla"" and as ""Godzilla Raids Again"" when it was on VHS tape. The original Japanese title was apparently, ""Gojira no gyakush"" or ""Gojira Strikes Again"" in English.

I am a huge Godzilla fan and have been since I was a small child, and in all the years I watched these films on TV, in the theater, and on home video, I've never seen this film broadcast on television and I apparently missed it when it was available on VHS. I didn't even know it existed until I saw it listed in Michael Weldon's Psychotronic Film Guide years ago. It seems that the fact that this film was not released in the US by the same company that released the original film has doomed this one to obscurity for an extremely long time. However, this situation is now corrected with the release of the film to DVD.

FILM SYNOPSIS, PRODUCTION TRIVIA, COMMENTS
As was stated in the original Gojira, it does turn out that there are more of these monstrous creatures in the sea than just the one Godzilla that was destroyed at the end of the first film. This film is more of a typical 1950s ""monster smash 'em up"" picture than the original film and less of a statement on nuclear horror. This sets the tone for many Godzilla pictures to come. There were also some apparent changes to the Gojira costume for this film as well as to the focus of the story. It also began the now long-standing tradition of matching Godzilla up with other monsters as Angiurus, sometimes called Anguilas, makes his debut in this film. He's the monster that looks a bit like an ankylosaur with a touch of giant hedgehog.

This film is a fairly average entry in the Godzilla series with little of the serious dramatic metaphors for and references to nuclear war so prevalent in the original Japanese version of the first film, but kaiju completists and monster movie fans will probably want to see this film because it has been so rarely seen or available up until now. The Japanese version is coherent, fairly well-acted and enjoyable. The American version is so hilariously bad that it's hugely entertaining as unintentional comedy! The American version is filled with nonsensical dialogue that has nothing to do with the original Japanese, it's loaded with cheesy stock footage that does not appear in the original film and it's voiced-over by a narrator (Keye Luke) that NEVER stops talking. Seriously, the American producer insisted on non-stop narration that never shuts up and insists on describing things that are clearly portrayed visually in the film. It's just terrible, but funny terrible! The American version would have been a great subject for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Be sure to listen to the commentary track on the American version after watching the film once without it. It's informative and highly entertaining.

DVD INFORMATION ON CONTENT INCLUDING EXTRA FEATURES
This DVD contains both the original 1955 Japanese version of the film as well as the 1959 American release dubbed in English. George Takei (Star Trek) and Keye Luke (Charlie Chan, Gremlins) both supplied voices for the English version. The subtitles for the uncut Japanese version were newly produced for this release. Like the recent excellent 2-disc DVD release of the original Gojira, this disc has commentary and featurettes by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski.

Note that the general release date for this DVD was originally supposed to be in November 2006, but it has been pushed back till spring 2007. This information comes directly from the godzillaondvd website, which is the official website of the producers of this DVD and the only place where the DVD can be purchased until general release.

I'm giving this release 3 stars for the movie and 5 stars for the great DVD treatment for a final rating of 4 stars. Monster flick fans can celebrate now that ""Godzilla Raids Again"" raids again!",1159833600,,4408,4.778215223097113
327656,4,630133275X,The first of the Godzilla vs. films and made shortly after KING OF THE MONSTERS this movie begins the tradition of great Tokyo monster sequals.

327658,3,630133275X,"The original ""Godzilla"" (""Gojira"") was such a surprise smash hit, that Toho studios immediately went into production on a sequel, and managed to release  ""Godzilla Raids Again""  (""Gojira no gyakushu"" or ""Godzilla's Counterattack"") only six months after the original.

Setting the stage for all Godzilla movies to come, this is the first ""Godzilla vs. "" film, introducing a monster-sized opponent for the big fella, the Ankylosaurus-inspired Anguirus.  Filmed in black and white, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" is a bridge between the serious ""Godzilla"" and the more campy incarnations to follow.

In the story, a roving airplane discovers a Godzilla-type monster (the original Godzilla being killed at the end of the first movie) battling Anguirus on a remote island, what can only be the famed Monster Island of later films.  Notifying headquarters, the military prepares for the eventual spill-over of the battle into Japan.  And spill it does, as the two beasties tear it up in the heart of Osaka, tromping over such landmarks as Osaka Castle.  Godzilla soundly defeats and kills Anguirus, and is then chased to the Arctic where heroic Japanese pilots bury him under the ice and snow....forever?

A flawed film, and not nearly as good as the original, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" is still better than some of the overly-campy sequels to follow. It retains enough of the serious elements from the first film, including Kurosawa actor Takeshi Shimura (""Seven Samurai,"" ""Ikiru"") as Dr. Yamane-hakase.  The black and white really suits Godzilla, and adds an extra air of menace.

Unfortunately, this is a rushed production, with not enough time and budget put into perfecting it.  The most noticeable error is the speeded-up monster battles of Godzilla and Anguirus.  The director wanted to film them in slow-motion, as had been done before, but the technician accidentally undercranked the camera instead of overcranking it, resulting in the action appearing faster than reality.

The US dub of ""Godzilla Raids Again"" is one of the worst of all time, sometimes renaming Godzilla ""Gigantis the Fire Monster"" and using Anguirus's roar instead of the trade-mark Godzilla roar.  A DVD with the original Japanese language track is definitely needed to fully appreciate the charms the film has to offer.",1119225600,,2284,5.236263736263736
327659,1,630133275X,"This film is a dud.  After the impressive Godzilla: King of the Monsters, came this dull, boring sequel.

Two stupid pilots find another Godzilla creature battling a spiky monster, later named Anguirus.  They report the news to the leaders in Osaka.  The military tries to lure Godzilla away from Japan with flares, but thanks to some dimwitted escaped prisoners, Godzilla is lured TOWARD japan, by a raging oil fire.

Godzilla fights Anguirus again and whips the stupid thing in an oddly shot fight (usually the giant monster scenes are shot in slo-mo so they appear a little realistic.  Here they are apparently shot real time).  Godzilla leaves and the Japanese military follows, burying Godzilla under massive mounds of snow and ice (like that's going to stop him after countless artillery shells and tank rounds fail?).

Throughout the film Godzilla is refered to as Gigantis and rarely is his trademark roar heard.  Most of the time he sounds like Anguirus.

Anguirus would later appear in Godzilla vs Gigan & Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla (as a good guy in both), both of which are more enjoyable than this dud.

I didn't care a lick for the characters and found myself very bored, desiring the end to come quickly.  A real letdown after the initial entry, this one is notable only in the fact it cointains the first monster battle of the series.",1109721600,,1349,4.842794759825328

Godzilla then destroys Angilas with his radioactive heat beam.

327687,4,630133275X,"""Godzilla Raids Again"" is the 2nd film in the Godzilla series. It is the last black and white film in the series as well as the last ""stand-alone"" Godzilla film to air until ""Godzilla 1985"". In many ways, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" is the ideological sequel to ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"". The attitude of this film is different, far more pragmatic and martial than ""Godzilla"". Unlike the first film, the military stays in the fight for the entire film and ultimately prevails. In fact a better title for this film might be ""Godzilla : Japan strikes back"". The reaction to Godzilla in ""Godzilla Raids Again"" is one of both resignation and determination. Resignation that Godzilla has come back to menace Japan again. Determination to not let Godzilla destroy the country of Japan. Like ""Godzilla"", ""Godzilla Raids Again"" develops a substantial sub-plot following the exploits of Kobayashi and Tsukioka, two pilots for a fishing company. These two develop an onscreen chemistry that shines through the subtitles. You really get to root for these guys throughout the film. And ""Godzilla Raids Again"" lets you do so without taking away the focus from the monsters. It is in this film that Godzilla meets his first kaiju foe, a trend that would continue through 27 of Godzilla's next 29 films. ""Godzilla Raids Again"" has a smaller scale to it. The world is not so much threatened as is Osaka and Kobayashi and Tsukioka. It is this perception of Godzilla as a force that can be combated and conquered, which is much different than the feeling from ""Godzilla"". The story has the same thoughtfulness and pacing as ""Godzilla"". The military sequences are realistic and well done. A strong Godzilla film, not ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" but ""Godzilla Raids Again"" is not trying to be, this 2nd film is just trying to tell its story and continue the fine tradition established in ""Godzilla"". ""Godzilla Raids Again"" accomplishes both handily.",1080345600,,1936,4.978395061728395

Originally released on VHS through Video Treasures (now known as ""Anchor Bay""), this first sequel to the original Godzilla was also known as ""Gigantis, The Fire Monster"". Long forgotten by some fans of the classic Toho series, this one is similiar to the original in its feel though not nearly as grim.
This one concerns a group of fisherman who discover two monsters, one of them is another Godzilla while the other is a monster we will come to know and love as Anguilas. The monsters eventually show up in Osaka and wreck havoc. The military finally tracks the monsters down to an iceberg out in the ocean where the finale takes place.

Summary: Two prehistoric monsters bring their ages old battle to the city of Osaka, Japan.  Only one will remain standing ... will it be the current champion Godzilla, or the challenger Angilas?
""Godzilla Raids Again"" (aka ""Gigantis, the Fire Monster""), while far from being the greatest G film ever made, is certainly not the worst either, yet, for some reason, this entry in the series has become something of a ""lost"" classic.  Being one of the harder G movies to come by, any fan looking for this video to add to their collection should do so upon finding a copy.  I realize that I've only given ""Godzilla Raids Again"" a rating of 2 stars, but a rating of 2 and a half stars would certainly be more appropriate.
""Godzilla Raids Again"" is noteworthy mainly for being the 2nd, and last, G movie to be filmed in Black and White, and for being the first film in the series to feature a second monster, the spiky Angilas (one of my personal favorite monsters in G history).  ""Godzilla Raids Again"" also serves as a kind of blueprint for future G films (particularly those from the 2nd, or Heisei, series of G films, and the 3rd, or Alternate Universe, series of G films), in that this entry lacks most of the haunting effect the original film had and focuses more on the serious action/adventure aspect that would come to be prevalent in later G films.

327703,5,630133275X,"2001: Undeservedly rare (nearly unknown), originally titled ""Gigantis, The Fire Monster"" in North America, this movie is worth every penny you'll pay for it. The hack-job English dubbing doesn't do the movie any favors, especially a party scene which might have made sense in Japanese but speaks more about the lack of comprehension by whoever dubbed the movie when viewed in English. The climax of the movie involves the heroic/comic pilot (a well-regarded actor in Japan, this being his sole science fiction role) diving his plane into an ice floe to prevent Godzilla/Gigantis from escaping to the sea, inspiring other pilots to bomb not the monster but to bury it in ice. Try and find this movie in the original Japanese with subtitles, it makes a bit more sense that way. Though you'll want the dubbed English version first. This is prime science fiction, not to be missed.

Serious, but not as grim as ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters,"" we see the first traces of the camp humor that became a trademark of Japanese sci-fi.  It is one of the few movies of the series that does a ""hand-off"" from the previous flick.  Dedicated fans will recognize Dr. Yamane from the first Godzilla film.  In addition, Godzilla (also known as ""Gigantis"") meets Angilus, the first of many bizarre enemies.  In somber B/W photography, the story of dueling monsters on the loose unfolds.  This time it's Osaka and not Tokyo, threatened with fiery destruction.  As usual, the monsters invade populous areas, destroy buildings, and threaten civilization.  As usual, conventional military hardware has no effect.  The English-dubbed dialogue is occasionally hilarious.  The special effects and other production values are typical of Japanese sci-fi.

7811324,5,630133275X,"This GEM of a Godzilla movie unfairly & officially/universally has the distinct reputation of being the 2nd worst Godzilla film ever made, if you count the 1998 Emmerich American made ""Godzilla"" as a Godzilla movie, which is #1 worst. This movie doesn't waste time with all the hosh posh & politics & gets right down to what I strongly consider the best, most realistic & different battle between 2 very angry giant creatures. The fight is so fast paced, the hand to hand combat so unique & unusual, never seen before or since in that style in any Godzilla films.
Not much to the story: Another godzilla has emerged after the 1st one was destroyed in ""Gojira/Godzilla."" Also, another Dinosaur has emerged in the form of ""Angelus,"" a Porcupine-like creature with spikes all over its back & a dog bone shaped head. The 2 creatures cross paths and what ensues is a frantic paced battle that never slows, until it's bloody conclusion-Godzilla bites Angelus' throat as the blood pours out profusely, with the struggling Angelus valiantly trying to wriggle out from the clenched jaw & protruding fangs of a relentless Godzilla, until it finally dies & then is roasted by Godzilla to eat for later. It must be seen to be appreciated!
No other Godzilla film ever had its star move so briskly, use its hands & teeth throughout instead of just its fire breath & objects thrown & kicked as & the opponent using its special weapons combined with falling debris like buildings & flying debris from the wind created by Zilla's flying opponents. This is more like a UFC fight between 2 Kaiju, & worth every minute of your time! For me, every hour, as I've enjoyed it many many times, & shall continue to. Lastly, the ""Burial"" of Godzilla at the end is one rare time Godzilla actually dies at the end, or is at least stopped, & very convincingly. And it is a thing of beauty as well as ingenuity!
