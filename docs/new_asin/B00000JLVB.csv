7912445,5,B00000JLVB,"The first volume of Lain was really well done with moments of different placing. However, there wasn't much of it in this volume. The first episode deals with Lain's sister. Is there two of her? Yes, but which one is real and whats the point of it? The second episode opens up questions as Lain talks with the creator of 'kids'. A special program that has something to do with those children. The last episode was a little off base, but necesesary. Those men with the red lasers are actually helping Lain and want to find out more about her. There was some nice realistic virtual graphics in the last epsiode and Lain is actually now fully aware of the wired (Just look at her room). At first I kinda hated this volume, but then I looked back on it and said 'Hey, that was cool! Why didn't I notice that?'. I guess thats just the way Lain is. It is grows on you.",970358400,,862,4.262195121951219
7912446,5,B00000JLVB,"As you can see from the 60 or so 5 star reviews of volume 1, Lain is not a series to ignore. I could spend paragraphs ranting about how Lain altered my perception of reality, but you're probably sick of that by now.  I will  just say that if you dug episodes 1-4, you'll love this volume.  While the  first tape put the emphasis on creating an atmosphere of creepy uneasiness,  this one actually starts to incorporate a plot to give it a bit more  coherence.  I loved this tape, and both episodes 6 and 7 end with amazing  moments that TOTALLY alter the flow of the story.  The second best of the  series, Volume 2 threw me for a loop, and I suggest you buy it (and the  entire series) now, without even thinking.",956534400,2,713,4.207407407407407
7912447,5,B00000JLVB,"Lain gets better into cyberspace. It's almost dangerous for the little girl as she starts to abandon her physical self. ""The Wired"" offers some insight into the goings on of a twisted Nazi-like professors  who prays on children and some Men-in- Black type antagonists who may or  may not be these internet based Knights.  The second installment of Lain  gives us more of the stuff that makes Lain, for me, great animation. In  story it's similar to Ghost in the Shell. The tone is almost like Neon  Evangelon.  There is, however,  a distinct lack of overt, bash-you-over the  head violence. There is action, but there are also deep themes at play.  English band BOA provides killer opening music, and the production values  are top-notch. A great departure from the girl with big guns and or breasts  that has become standard issue in Japanese animation. I can't wait for the  next set of episodes.",939168000,5,898,4.790849673202614
