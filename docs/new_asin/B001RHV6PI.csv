3776265,5,B001RHV6PI,"In the early part of the last century Mexico became very hostile to the Catholic Church and it had to go 'underground'. But Fr Miguel Pro continued his priestly work under various disguises until he was caught and shot by firing squad. A film well made and an example to those who just 'coast along"" in their faith walk.",1375142400,,320,4.440677966101695
3776266,5,B001RHV6PI,This is a great retelling of the story of a man who loved God and people so much that he was willing to give his life for their sake.  SO imspiring.  Well acted.  You certainly get caught up in the story very quickly.  Extremely moving.,1374364800,,236,4.177777777777778
3776267,3,B001RHV6PI,"I love purchasing saint movies and this one seemed like a logical choice. I had purchased ""For the Greater Glory"", before this movie and I was hoping it would be along the same lines. The movie was informative, but not too deep. I guess I base movies on whether or not they make me tear up. This one didn't. Still it's a good movie to own and worth a purchase.",1370476800,,360,4.1571428571428575
3776268,4,B001RHV6PI,"I knew about Father Miguel Pro who was martyred for his devotion to Catholics.  The fact that he did this in spite of the socialist Mexican government prohibiting any public worship, laity dressing in their attire and persecuting people of faith.  He pays the ultimate price and does it with humility and devotion.

The film is decent but the production values are grade B/C.  The emotional feeling carries this movie about a humble but devoted Jesuit priest who wanted to serve God and fellow believers.",1365292800,5,504,4.894117647058824
3776269,5,B001RHV6PI,this is a movie that will teach you things you didn't know about Latin America saints and the struggle the Roman Catholics had to endure during the beginning of the last century,1361491200,3,177,4.5625
3776270,5,B001RHV6PI,"Padre Pio, the DVD, Meets my expectations and even succeeds them.  I have a great devotion to him as a ""Blessed"" of the Catholic Church",1357344000,2,135,4.4
3776271,4,B001RHV6PI,Es la historia de un padre que contribuyo de manera importante en la cristeada. Aunque la mayoria de los actores no son reconocidos la historia es real y muy interesante.,1349308800,3,170,4.7
3776272,4,B001RHV6PI,"This production about Padre Miguel Pro was fascinating and very colorfull. It kept my interest until the very end even though the final scene is shown at both the beginning and the ending of the film. The movie concentrated on the life of  Padre Pro from when he begins his religous training until his death in Mexico City. In between we are treated to beautiful scenes of both Mexico and Europe where he must go to continue his religous training after the socialist government of Mexico begins its suppression of the Catholic Church.  Anyone who mistakenly believes that socialism is kind and benovelent is unaware of the attempts by the Mexican government to destroy the Catholic Church in Mexico. This sad part of history is not taught in the US, even though it is of great interest to a growing hispanic population and of course to the very large Catholic community. While the movie does not get into the reasons for the government crackdown, other than the conflict over Church decrees; it does show the extreme violence that was carried out against the church. This is a good family film, that is to say it is not overly violent and as I said before it concentrates on the good works of Padre Pro.",1348099200,5,1203,4.643192488262911
3776273,5,B001RHV6PI,"After I saw this movie for the first time, I can tell this is one of the few movies that moved my heart so much that made me cry and thank God for what the Mexican martyrs did to sustain the faith in Mexico. If it were not for the people who were willing to sacrifice for their faith and the Glory of God (together with the intercession of Our Lady of Guadalupe), Mexico easily could have been another USSR-like socialist country, without any religious liberty (at least, for sure, during those years following the Cristeros defense).
This movie helped me understand how dire the situation was in Mexico after the Mexican Revolution and how fragile religious freedom can be if the government starts attacking or limiting it ""slowly in a gradual way"".
I have bought more copies of the DVD to share with others.",1340323200,11,809,4.586206896551724
3776274,3,B001RHV6PI,"We knew about Mexico's bloodshed & Martyrdom of many lay + priests but the event is easy to forget somehow.

We saw it with our kids: teaches history, church history, showcases the courage of many men/women & of course, Padre Pro and his family.

Honestly, I will probably not see it again but am glad to support its production through my purchase plus I am grateful for what it taught my kids about LOVE.

8338017,5,B001RHV6PI,Beautiful Movie in Spanish with English Subtitles.  Brilliantly Played.  Great Actors and lovely story line.  It gives a detailed look about the events surrounding the Martyrdom of a Mexican Jesuit Priest during the Cristero Movement in Mexico.,1421280000,,244,5.54054054054054
8338018,2,B001RHV6PI,"My biggest disappoint in the movie is that it seems to push somebody's notion of a social action agenda and ignores the heroic struggles of the young Padre Pio to deal with a chronic illness that plagued him throughout his time as a seminarian and especially after he was ordained. The illness mysteriously left him after he returned to Mexico, where the superiors sent him expecting that he would die there.  The characters, as portrayed by the young actors, were likeable if you ignore the real story of Padre Pio.",1389830400,,516,4.733333333333333
8338019,5,B001RHV6PI,"This religious persecution in Mexico was very real, and not so long ago. Could it happen again ? And here in the US ?
Padre Pro died by a firing squad made up of his fellow citizens. Chilling thought. Those who do not read history are doomed to repeat history.",1387152000,,260,4.22
8338020,3,B001RHV6PI,"This is a very interesting true story of Padre Pro, a Jesuit priest who was executed - for celebrating Mass and conducting other religious duties required of a Catholic priest - by the Mexican government during the 1926-29 Christero period. During that period the Mexican government outlawed the Catholic Church and the Church went underground, conducting its mission in secret. Padre Pro was later beatified by Pope John Paul II.

The drawback in this particular production is that the production is not great quality. It's in Spanish with English subtitles that are poorly translated in places. The script/screenplay is not particularly well written, the actors appear to be amateurs, props and sets are low budget and the camera work and editing are acceptable but not particularly high quality.

I really want to rate this higher than three stars since Padre Pro's story is one that really deserves to be told. But it deserves to be told in a higher quality production than this is. I hate to say it, but this production is only worth three stars.

If you want a very good, well produced movie about the Christero uprising in Mexico, check out ""For Greater Glory"" with Andy Garcia.",1384646400,,1185,4.915
