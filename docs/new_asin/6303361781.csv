7920648,4,6303361781,"For the small band of us who can never adequately satisfy our desire to see and hear British military bands and especially the Guards, this is a wonderful opportunity to experience the splendor and pageantry from our own homes.  Numerous clips of ceremonies such as Trooping the Colour, the Ceremony of the Keys, the Opening of Parliament, etc. are included.  Quality is somewhat spotty of course given the difficulty of adequate microphone placement outdoors with marching bands etc.  but all in all is quite good and certainly beats having to jostle with crowds in front of Buckingham Palace.  The sequence depicting the Band of the Coldstream Guards in their winter greatcoats marching on to the tune ""the Voice of the Guns"" is worth the price alone.",1027036800,,753,4.9523809523809526
