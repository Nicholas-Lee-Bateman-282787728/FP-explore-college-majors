8358737,3,B00011D1O0,"Dana Hershman is joined by Terumi and Norbert in this workout.  They're outside on the grass near the beach/oceanside of Hawaii and Terumi shows the modified version of each Pilates exercise.  The background music is average/unobtrusive.  The DVD is chaptered and you can choose from the section of breathing, the actual workout, relaxation and the bonus Pilates mat workout (filmed indoors with Dana alone and the workout is more advanced than the orginal one on the DVD).

Dana cues both live and in voice-over throughout the DVD.  The production value is mediocre.  It's okay, but in my opinion, not worth the price.  There are better Pilates media out there that are less expensive.",1139097600,2,686,5.017699115044247
