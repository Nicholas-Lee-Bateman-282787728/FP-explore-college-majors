2789577,5,B000O179GS,"The John Wayne Western Collection
John Wayne with his best westerns, excellent, great quality DVD's",1241395200,,99,5.666666666666667
2789578,5,B000O179GS,"I would really like to purchase this set but I am puzzled about the aspect ratio of this complete collection... is states that it is 1.33 which translates to full screen aspect when watching. In doing some research on this set, elsewhere for sale I have seen this collection listed as 'various movies full-screen and some widescreen'... are all these films in this collection full-screen? Is there a different version out that there that contains some widescreen films in this set ? It sounds like an amazing set but I don't want to purchase full screen films and then later on have to re-purchase in widescreen. Thank you very much for any assistance anyone can pass along :)",1240963200,,676,4.737288135593221
2789579,5,B000O179GS,Product was in perfect condition and delivery was speedy.  Two thumbs up in my book.,1226534400,,84,4.6
2789580,5,B000O179GS,"If, when you think of western movies, you automatically think JOHN WAYNE, this is the collection for you. Although my favorite--Rio Bravo, isn't in this collection, the 2 remakes of that great movie--El Dorado and Rio Lobo are. So are Hondo, The sons of Katie Elder and The Shootist. These movies are great alone-but put them in a collection with Wayne's ""Rooster"" in True Grit or with Maureen O'Hara in the funny McLintock, you have a winner. Let's not forget this also includes the big movies Big Jake and The Man who Shot Liberty Valance, with Jimmy Stuart. If you are a western fan, like my husband and myself, you probably have a collection that includes many John Wayne westerns, as we do. This is an opportunity to have 9 of the favorites in one package. We are happy with this collection, you will be too.",1220745600,5,813,4.575342465753424
2789581,4,B000O179GS,"For the money, this collection should be in everyone's movie library. The movies on here are all excellent, and the behind the scenes stories and antecdotes of ""The Shootist"", ""True Grit"" and others are just that much more of an attraction. See Duke at his best in ""El Dorado"", ""True Grit"" (which he one an Oscar for his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn) and my favorite, ""The Shootist"".
  I can't say enough about this collection, so do yourself a favor, and just buy it!!!",1216166400,7,470,4.650602409638554
2789582,5,B000O179GS,Got this for my father-in-law and he loves it.  I think he's watched the series a couple times since christmas already.,1213920000,,119,4.666666666666667
2789583,5,B000O179GS,"This boxed set contains 9 westerns that make a great backbone for any John Wayne Collection.  This was a GREAT birthday gift for my husband, an avid John Wayne fan.  Slimline DVD cases, cover art is ok, DVD quality is great.  I looked at several different John Wayne western collections before I made my purchase and this one had the best value for the $$ as well as a good variety of drama/comedy/action.",1213574400,24,405,4.52054794520548
2789584,5,B000O179GS,"I purchased this set to get one movie, but am happy with the whole set. I forgot how good the movies were, so now the set is one of my favorite in my collection. Certainlly worth the money.",1206316800,5,189,4.0
2789585,5,B000O179GS,"I don't know why Paramount released this collection of nine great John Wayne westerns on the same day that they released these same films plus five others for twenty-seven extra dollars in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-John-Wayne-Century-Collection-Big-Jake-Donovan-s-Reef-El-Dorado-Hatari-Hondo-In-Harm-s-Way-Island-in-the-Sky-McLintock-Rio-Lobo-The-High-and-the-Mighty-etc/dp/B000O179G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The John Wayne Century Collection (Big Jake, Donovan's Reef, El Dorado, Hatari!, Hondo, In Harm's Way, Island in the Sky, McLintock!, Rio Lobo, The High and the Mighty, etc.)</a>.

The five additional films in the Century Collection are Donovan's Reef, In Harm's Way, Hatari, The High and the Mighty (2 disc edition), and Island in the Sky. Basically, this western set is just a subset of the century collection. I would normally give this set four stars - five for content and three for value, but after all this is John Wayne! His outstanding films in any subset in which they are grouped together shouldn't suffer from a bad rating just because Paramount's home video department is clueless.",1204588800,23,1159,6.625
2789586,5,B000O179GS,"El Dorado, Rio Lobo, same movie, different supporting cast.  Still entertaining.  The entire package as group is awewsome.  Some of the Duke's best stuff.  This pack includes Director's cuts and documentaries for a couple of the movies more great stuff.  It was great to see Maureen O'Hara talking about the old days with the Duke and about her doing most of her own stunts.  It was great to see Michael Wayne inside the film vault and some of his Dad's personal momentoes from his movies, like his aging old hat and chaps.  More and More great stuff, you'll enjoy yourself for days trying to see it all and treasure it for years.",1202947200,23,630,4.571428571428571

I have watched everyone of these films and there's not a flaw in any of them.
The Picture is the very best along with the Audio.
You can't go wrong with this set.
Thank you Its a Great addition to our collection.
We are more than Pleased.",1319155200,,276,3.9464285714285716
8182686,5,B000O179GS,This DVD collection though expensive is a collection of all Good Western movies of John Wayne. I have yet to watch all of them. The picture and audio quality is excellent. I am not able to play the DVD on a PC using vlc. It plays fine on a DVD player though. If you are John Wayne Fan I recommend this.,1263600000,,302,3.9672131147540983
8182687,4,B000O179GS,Bought this as a gift. It came pretty quick. Haven't heard any complaints about it so it must be good. :D,1260921600,,105,4.0476190476190474

8182689,5,B000O179GS,"EACH OF THE FOUR WERE VERY GOOD.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ""ISLAND IN THE SKY"" ND ""POINT OF NO RETURN"" ON A DOUBLE DISK!",1256601600,,115,3.6
8182690,5,B000O179GS,"I bought this collection for my husband.  We had scouted many local stores to find these exact movies but they were never available.  What a treat to find them all in one collection at such a reasonable price.  To buy them separately would have cost so much more.  All of the movies are excellent westerns, but we especially enjoy ""The Sons of Katie Elder"".  The only downfall is, when purchasing John's other movies, these same ones are mixed into the other collections available.  Then you end up with repeats.  It would be nice to be able to get the other movies in a collection that didn't include any of these same movies.",1255132800,4,627,4.544642857142857
