862475,5,6304383657,"Have used this movie in course in social work graduate and undergraduate programs, in the human behavior and social environment (groups and communities) sequence.  Sayles' Lone Star is equally effective as it  includes families'more than Matewan.  What's especially appealing  about Matewan is that its so plausibly real-you know that this version  could very well be what actually happened.  Makes for great discussion.  In  same caterory as Grapes of Wrath and On the Waterfront.",916531200,7,481,5.493150684931507

When I watched it again just recently, I was afraid it might look dated or seem contrived (a lot of 1980's movies look that way when you look back on them), but that was not the case with this movie.  It holds up really well.  Sayles captured the feeling of the tension surrounding the conflicts in w. Virginia with this movie. It is a good film to use to discuss or contemplate how well film has educate an audience about a historical event.  While Matewan took a lot of liberties with the actual events preceding the Matewan massacre, it is nonetheless a film that should provoke someone to look more deeply into that era of our country's labor history.",1496793600,,782,4.485915492957746

862821,5,6304383657,"John Sayles has made a true classic.  It is about a coal miner's strike in the small West Virginia town of Matawan during the depression.  It has a cast of unknowns at the time of filming:  Chris Cooper, in his first film, plus  David Strathairn and Mary McDonnell.  With James Earl Jones giving one of his superb performances.  Filmed in nearby towns to Matawan, the film shows the poverty of the times, the use of  hired strikebreakers, and the enmity of racial and national prejudice.

862827,5,6304383657,"MATEWAN is an American classic.  When I first saw MATEWAN (written and directed by John Sayles) on cable tv (1987 or 88) I was mesmerized instantly by the ""the look"" of the movie (cinematography by Haskell Wexler).  At the time I had no idea who Mary McDonnel was or David Strathairn (plays Sid Hatfield!) and, certainly, had never heard of the story of this West Va mining town's struggle against the unfair treatment by the Coal Company that ""paid"" them.
I decided to buy my copy of MATEWAN for $10 and was only marginally disappointed that, well, the ""margins"" of this supposed Widescreen version (even says widescreen on my disc) is not correct.
There are no black bars on top or bottom of screen.
The fact this is not widescreen is obvious when some early credits (a 'letter' or two) disappear off the side of screen.  Happens again during closing credits.  This is a Full Screen for sure.  That said, MATEWAN'S rustic, woody, lush greens and mountains 'look' does prevail.

If you are a Sayles fan and haven't seen MATEWAN in a while you might be surprised how many of these actors he used again and again (not just Chris Cooper or Strathairn or McDonnel) but others like the Italian immigrant (Maggie Renzi) who played Eddie Cicotte's wife in Eight Men Out.  And trust me that is just one quick example.  Another actor (Jace Alexander - Eight Men Out) and actress from Passion Fish  (5 years after Matewan ) have very significant roles in MATEWAN.
And, man, are Kevin Tighe and Gordon Clapp (both in 8 Men Out) two of the most despicable ""Company"" workers ever seen?  ""Ma'am, you are the best lookin' piece of 'mountain trash' I think I've ever seen.""  You are NOT welcome to Matewan, prick(s).
John Sayles had already proven himself a solid screenwriter for Roger Corman's Lady in Red (for example) and he may never have duplicated this early directorial masterwork, MATEWAN (""Return of the Secaucus 7"" his first).
But, it has to be said again:  How come an American movie as well done and historically significant as MATEWAN cannot receive a better treatment?  This movie just screams for a Criterion Edition.",1485648000,8,2118,4.73841961852861

863432,4,6304383657,"This is NOT a family movie.  Have your Guardian ready (to remove cursing) prior to watching it.  But this tells the true story of the early battle between miners and their brutal overlords who owned the mines back in the 1920s and early '30s. My wife's grandfather was a union president for UMW back then. I interviewed him and other old miners (those who lived to tell) and studied enough history to know that everything in this movie is accurate.  Of course they have to add a dramatic storyline which may or may not have happened but all else is highly historically accurate down to the final, tense stand-off between the miners and their anti-union employers.  What the story does not mention is how union leaders came around to mines homes to give a blanket party to those who refused to join. The movie does accurately portray the involvement of communists in early union activity.  It also accurately portrays how mine owners hired street thugs and known criminals to brutalize the miners into submission any way they could.  These men lived a very hard life working from before daylight to well past dark 365 days a year with no days off ever except when they were too ill to get out of bed.  The company paid them, not in cash but in script which was redeemable only at the company store where inflated prices ensured the miners would always be in debt. The company owned the homes so if a miner quit his job he lost everything and left with nothing if he was lucky enough to leave debt free.  Listen carefully to the lyrics as Ernie Ford sings Merle Travis's song ""16 Tons.""  The song is not played in this movie but it fits.  Did you know some people thought Merle Travis was a communist for writing the song and that the FBI advised radio stations not to play it because, in the late '40s and early '50s, Communism was still touted by big business and their government cronies as the root cause of union activity in the mines.

863538,5,6304383657,"I watch this film every few years to see the best film Sayles has out there. In fact Its just a great film who ever had made it. Its a pleasure watching a near perfect cast especially David Strathairn as Sheriff Hatfield and Chris Cooper as the union organizer. The events the film portrays (the Matewan massacre) is based on fact. Miners needed to be organized considering the wretched conditions they lived and worked during the turn of the twentieth century. Matewan was only one of several large horrific incidents which occurred to make this organization possible. This story ,although not historically accurate in some areas does indeed communicate the desperate times these and all coal miners were living. There is a running narrative that focuses the audience attention to both the characters and the events which led to the shoot out between the miners and the hired detectives. Sayles has you hissing inside at the mere thought of these hired guns. In reality they were hired to evict the striking miners from company owned housing to break up the strike and have the miners return to work unorganized, starving and ill. The miners in their desperation saw no way out but violence. The union organizer (C.Cooper) is opposed to violence as a solution but the situation  gets out of hand and we as observers see that this is their only solution. We get to watch the transition of the main characters from unorganized miners to a solidarity as union members only through forced violence.  Each character comes to this solution differently .This is the brilliance of the film . Sayles takes us through this transition which is different for each .Its great story telling and wonderful character development .",1428451200,5,1715,4.910344827586207

It is absolutely one-sided, with no apologies. Sometimes bad guys are just bad guys. The coal companies owned entire towns and every soul in them and used their power ruthlessly. This is the story of people who will no longer submit. People who demand to be treated with dignity.

In order to prevailm they must overcome racism and the hired thugs brought in by the company.

The screenplay is an example of writing at its finest and the stellar cast makes this their own story. Matewan is a riveting production that will replay itself over and over in your mind.

It wasn't a well done transfer to begin with, thrown out on the market when DVD sales were taking off like gangbusters and companies were racing to get as much from their catalog of films on the market as soon as they could.

Anyway, this DVD that's now being sold here on Amz is not legit.  The first clue is when you look at the item description and there's no release date listed--all legitimate companies have made their dvd release date public knowledge months before their items hit the market; zilch for this one.  And secondly, speaking of legitimate companies...PDX? Just who the eff are those guys? I have thousands of films on DVDs, many of them obscure, and I've never heard of these clowns.

So I'm just saying, if you really, REALLY have to see this film, well...I can sympathize. I've been there myself. Just be aware that you'll get the same bad transfer that was on the original Artisan disc, if you're lucky. And if you're not lucky...probably a transfer a from a VHS tape (and won't that look great, eh?).

While I cannot remember the original film well enough to comment on the absolute quality of the""widescreen"" version of the DVD, I can say that the current version I purchased to replace my VHS is a huge improvement in terms of sound and visual quality.

The movie is careful to be accurate in story and character. For independent film-making this is a fresh break away from Hollywood's cookie-cutter portrayals of violence. In addition, cinematographically it is full of beautiful imagery. The movie has great action, but nothing you're used to. Thank goodness.",1311206400,,610,5.171717171717172
864395,5,6304383657,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a wonderful film.  As a practicing labor historian, I must say that John Sayles has done a more effective (and certainly more entertaining!) job at presenting early 20th century U.S. labor and social history than most academics!  In fact, I plan to screen the film in future U.S. history courses.  It is all here: the dangers of coal mining, the greed of corporations, the aspirations of workers, the trials and tribulations of a long strike, racial and gender conflict, and ultimately, dramatic violence.  Believe it or not, Sayles and his wonderful cast manage to convey this story with thoughtfulness and subtlety.  Chris Cooper, James Earl Jones, David Strathairn, Mary McDonnell, Will Oldham, Gordon Clapp, Nancy Mette, and the rest of the cast are just wonderful.  I could rave on about it, but better yet, just watch the film!

The U.S. DVD release (now out of print) leaves a lot to be desired.  It is in 4:3 pan and scan format and has a mono audio mix.  It is not much of an improvement over the VHS version of the film.  However, the Canadian DVD release is much better.  It is in widescreen and has an improved stereo audio mix.  You can get it from Amazon.ca or other Canadian websites.  I have the Seville films release.

There is also a 2008 edition from Phase 4 films.  I do not know whether it is any different from the 2003 edition, or whether it has any DVD extras.  Perhaps another reviewer can enlighten us.

A few years ago I read rumors that Sayles was going to release a widescreen DVD of the film for the U.S. market, with a director's commentary track.  Apparently that has not happened yet.  In the meantime, go ahead and buy the Canadian DVD of the film.  You will not be disappointed.",1305763200,5,1758,4.591639871382637

864475,5,6304383657,"One of the hallmarks of great film is that it pulls an emotional response from the viewer.  While I have been a fan of Mr. Sayles' work starting with ""The Return of the Seacaucus Seven,"" I had yet to see Matewan.  I came away from my first viewing with a renewed respect for his ability not only to tell a story, but to place characters within the story that are believable.  Not bigger than life but fully inhabiting the role so that the person portrayed becomes alive in a tangible sense.

I also enjoyed the portrayal of the struggle between business and labor and note the description on Amazon's page of ""A little-known chapter of American labor history.""  For those who are uninformed, the history of american labor movements has been strewn with the kinds of violence portrayed here, something well worth further investigation beyond the exposure that Matewan provides.

This movie is one of the few times in cinema where the setting (Appalachians), the story, the actors and an director come together to produce a piece of art that is entertaining, engaging and evokes a respect for the struggle of humanity to advocate for themselves in the face of intimidation and violence.

Whether you see this in a ""poor transfer,"" rent it from a library, or buy it at Amazon.ca as another review suggested, don't deprive yourself of one of the finest examples of american film making...that has a conscience.

If the storyline prompts you to investigate Matewan further...then Mr. Sayles and the cast will have been well served.

864476,4,6304383657,"I grew up in Dingess West Virginia which is in Mingo County where this story happened. My grandfater was one of the minors who was in the strike. We forget that not that long ago the mines was a death trap, but the only work available for the people of Kentucky, and West Virginia. Most men had black lung and died before 50 from working in the mines. My grandfather took part in this strike. My family home which is in Dingess is about a Half mile from the big tunnel, which use to be a coal railroad. Above the tunnel is where alot of the miners marched and was met with bullets from the men the coal mines had hired to basicly beat the miners into submission. Today you can still walk the path and find shell casings of the firefight. I do agree that the sound is off in some places of the movie, but this movie is so much apart of history. This is a true story for so many of us who came from the back hills of coal mining counties. I think some times that people forget that it was a struggle to get mining to the standards it is now. I remember my granddaddy once saying that hell was only a quarter mile below ground. Matewan West Virginia is a real place, and these events really happened. We tend to forget I feel sometimes about the struggles that happened to get this country to where it is now. Miners died and went through hell to help make mining safer for today energy needs. There is still a long way to go in safety as you can tell by the recent events in mining accidents. Even with the quality of the movie  being off, and the sound muffled in places, this movie is awesome in showing the events that happened to history that put a small backwoods town of Matewan on the map.

864589,5,6304383657,"This has got to be one of the best, if not the best, American films of the past 30 years. It is for me anyway. It's about a miner's strike in Mingo county West Virginia in 1920. From what I understand it's based on true events. The basic story is - Joe Kenehan (Chris Cooper) comes to town to help the coal miners set up a union. The Stone Mountain Coal Company paid little, paid in company scrip, and owned the houses the workers lived in. The company brings in two Baldwin Phelps private detectives (Pinkerton types) to fight back against this labor organization. It's a fascinating battle as the union goes on strike and the detectives do anything they can, legal or otherwise, to subvert them. Classic storytelling.

The cast was superb. Many of these guys are from the Sayles *company* so to speak - Mary McDonnell, David Straithairn, Chris Cooper and the others. Not a bad performance in the movie.

Another thing I liked about the movie is it's attention to detail. I noticed the baseball Kenehan and Danny Radnor (a young Will Oldham) were throwing around in one scene. It certainly looked like something from the dead ball era. They filmed on location. The clothes were totally from the period. They used oil lamps. All these details added up, powerfully evoking the time and place - West Virginia in 1920.

Lastly, I didn't have any problem with the DVD as others seemed to. It didn't have any extras, but I don't care about that stuff anyway, so no loss. I did have to get it used though. I'm not sure why the company isn't releasing it new. (Well, it wasn't a commercial hit and movies about coal mining strikes probably aren't easy sells. I guess that's it.)

864703,5,6304383657,"MATEWAN is set in a small West Virginia coal mining town of the same name where in May of 1920 an armed conflict between striking miners and thugs sent in by the Baldwin-Felts organization to break the union resulted in what known as the Coalfield Wars, the biggest insurrection in America outside the Civil War. On the union's side were both the town's mayor, Cabal Testerman (who was shot and killed in the battle even though he was unarmed) and the sheriff, Sid Hatfield, who survived this fight only to gunned down on the steps on the county courthouse some time later. These men and what happened to them were real. To this mix writer and director John Sayles has added a composite creation to represent the union organizers who were also present that day. His union organizer is Joe Kenehan (played by one of his stable of regulars, Chris Cooper), a man of principal and compassion dedicated to easing the life of the working man. Kenehan is a combination of all the organizers who would have flourished under the abysmal conditions of the mines and factories of this period; Wobblies, socialists, communists, and ""non-affiliated guys who just got involved."" People who never would have given unionizing a second thought if it hadn't been for the overwhelming greed and callousness of the mine owners and giants of industry at that time.

We are given a glimpse of how profound their greed really is when a new group of scabs is brought in. One of the ways that organizing was kept to a minimum was by insuring that miners wouldn't speak to each other. This was accomplished by bringing in foreigners who simply didn't speak any English at all (in this instance some Italians) or by playing on people's innate racial hatreds, the remainder of the group was composed of blacks. Once new miners were hired on they were forced to rent their work clothes and equipment from the company store as well as pay for their housing and food all at exorbitant fees. In fact everything they needed could only be purchased through the company and prices were so high that it was guaranteed that they would never be able to pay back the inital outlay of monies they were fronted so that they could START to work! It was the original vicious circle.

MATEWAN is one of Sayles earliest films and it is also one of his best. It full of powerful imagery and quiet truths that will stay with you long after it has told you its story, a story you have never heard before. Sayles is a true auteur; he produced, wrote, directed, and edited this film. He even has a bit part in the film as a fire and brimstone preacher who is another tool of the company. But Sayles' real gift is that of the storyteller. From this review you might percieve this film to be a bunch of boring left-wing moralizing, but Sayles will entertain you and keep you interested in these people and their lives. As I said, that is his greatest gift.

For those of you who are interest in such things, Will Oldham (who plays a young man who also does some preaching) has some musical fame: Palace, Palace Brothers, Bonnie Prince Billie, etc,",1204329600,3,3095,4.593128390596745

864707,5,6304383657,"I grew up hearing about these events from my grandmother, whose father was in management at a barge company that sent loads of coal from Appalachia to the industrialized cities along the Ohio River, but it surprises me how few people my age know about the Matewan massacre and the events that led up to it.

In 1920 in a small town called Matewan, in Mongo County, in the heart of West Virginia's coal belt, local families attempted to organize a labor union in order to better their lives and free themselves from the oppressive stranglehold of the local coal companies, which owned ""everything but the immortal souls"" of those whose only choice in life was to work for these mafia-like corporations. The film Matewan is an impressive production that utilizes such actors as James Earl Jones and Chris Cooper to tell the story of the misery of the miners' lives, the corruption of the coal industry, the arrival of organized labor into this boiling maelstrom, and the violent events that ultimately culminated in a brutal firefight that left nine people dead.

Matewan is heavy on characterizations and back story which is a brave and wise step on behalf of director John Sayles, and far from being the centerpoint of the picture, the bloodshed of the massacre comes only at the movie's conclusion and is not sensationalized, which only makes it seem that much more horrific when it passes. To some who see it Matewan could register as a gloomy film but if that is tempered by a comparison of how things have since improved in coal country, then the deaths which drew attention to the region, could almost be regarded as having happened with some purpose.",1188691200,4,1656,4.7665505226480835

Now, to the substance -- the movie, incorporating a figure who appeared in an interpolated story in an early Sayles novel (Union Dues) into the historical shoot-out between Sid Hatfield and the Baldwin-Felts thugs, is excellent. The pacificism of Sayles' union organizer stands in contrast to the quick-tempered violence of the miners, but both stand against the pure brutishness of the Baldwin-Felts agents. Matewan's mayor and Sid Hatfield stand as heroes, as do more than a few who pick up guns in the final confrontation. Yet the young man whose maturation we witness in the story leaves as a disciple of Sayles' organizer. He chooses words, not guns.

864796,4,6304383657,"""MATEWAN"" is an actual event in American history, the Coal Wars of 1920-21, that shows the plight of the coal miners and their families in West Virginia during the 1920's. Owners of the big coal companies held the workers in what can best be described as indebted slavery. Everything that the miner used for his work had to bought from the company and the cost deducted from his pay. The houses they lived in were owned by the company; the clothes they and their families wore, the food they ate, had to be purchased from the company store with company issued script, not real money. If they needed extras such as medicine, it was paid for by the company and the miner had to pay it back. As the cost of items used by the miner increased, many found themselves so deeply in debt to the company that it was immposible to ever be debt free. A popular song, sung by Tennesse Ernie Ford, entitled ""Sixteen Tons"" aptly describes the coal miners plight, i.e: every ton of coal he dug out just put him deeper and deeper in debt. The miners attempts to form a union were met with resistence from the company; miners were beaten, thrown out their homes and so-called ""detectives"" from agencies hired by the coal companies, were brought in to intimidate the miners. Also, blacks and immigrants, many with no coal mining experience at all were also brought in. It was at the small town of Matewan, West Virginia, that a violent and bloody confrontation took place between the miners and the company's hired guns with many dying on both sides. The end result was their story finally being heard by the world, the breaking of the companies hold on the worker's lives and the formation of a union to speak for and protect them. If you have an interest in history and how the formation of many unions was paid for in blood, the ""MATEWAN"" is a must-see movie. Stars Chris Cooper, James Earl Jones and Mary McDonnell.",1155168000,5,1900,4.542274052478134

864798,5,6304383657,"The West Virginia mine war is an essential piece of a history that is left out in most accounts of the period.  For an explanation why this and most other labor conflicts are conveniently ommitted read James Loewen's ""Lies my Teacher Told Me.""

Even without reflecting deeper philosophical and historical trends, the story of Matewan and the mine wars stand alone as a fascinatingly true event.  In fact, even if the story was made up it, the entertainment value alone would make it worthwhile. The film is exciting and poignant, rife with memorable moments (the hillbillies saving Joe from the Baldwin Felts).  Sayle's does an amazing job capturing the flavor of West Virginia ""holler"" country (employing several local actors and contributors). Furthermoe, as others have mentioned, the cinematography is excellent.

Strictly from a historical perspective, the film is rife with foibles.  For example, the 14 year old preacher and his mom were thread into history as an artificial linchpin. On a more picky note, the historical Matewan would not be surrounded by beautiful mountains (the film was shot in the New River Gorge.) Instead, the hollows at the time were treeless and repugnant from timbering--first by timber companies, then by the railroad companies to build tracks, and finally by coal companies to build towns and tipples. That being said, the central events were delineated with pinpoint accuracy.  Also, the plot and screenplay made vivid the underlying themes and surrounding context of the time.

Some commenters have complained that the portrayal of the workers vs. owners and operators was too simplistic and biased.  Whatever Sayle's personal politics may be, the capitalists were truly that ruthless.  Obviously unions are also prone to flaws, but I thought Sayles shed plenty of light on this fact by showing the racist, xenophobic, and violent elements.  Also, there wasn't much of a ""communist"" element ever in Southern West Virginia.  What trifling Marxist sentiment that did exist was introduced by the Italian immigrants.  Just because union leaders ""preached"" themes reminiscient of socialism (resisting exploitation, working class unity), doesn't mean they were controlled from Moscow.

Unfortunately, the West Virginia mine war was a microcosm of American History for the time (and maybe even today).  Huge corporations pulled the puppet strings of local, state, and even the federal government.  The state police and even the Federal Army were sent in to break up the strike before the mine war was over.  What is more amazing, I did not know that the largest labor uprising in American history occurred in WV until I took a class in West Virginia History.  Being a resident in the state, I was shocked to hear that the federal gov't used chemical and aerial warfare against its own citizens.

Most of the major ""war"" elements happened after Matewan (in fact, the battle of blair mountain was triggered by the assassination of Sid Hatfield).  For a in depth non-fiction account of the period, read ""Thunder in the Mountains"" by Lon Savage. For a historical fiction account, read Denise Giardina's ""Storming Heaven.""  Like Matewan, ""Storming Heaven"" is historically accurate to the point of describing the themes and happenings, however it too is given fake characters for coherency.",1154044800,7,3315,5.216981132075472

864898,4,6304383657,"Matewan was a pleasant surprise. The subject matter cried out 'dull but worthy' and John Sayles is distinctly hit-and-miss when dealing with historical subjects, as the problematic Eight Men Out underlines, but this is quite a superb movie with a scope well beyond its budget. Almost a slow burn western as a miner's strike leads slowly but inevitably to a violent shootout between the railroad detectives and the local lawman and strikers, it's an involving and intelligent piece of work. That's not to say it's without problems: it perhaps overstates Kevin Tighe's villainous stupidity (could he really have laughed his way through a sermon without seeing the relevance?), a scene where the white, black and Italian miners set aside their differences through music feels too Hollywood, and Haskell Wexler over diffuses the light a couple of times in that irritating late-70s-early-80s way in his otherwise exemplary cinematography. Sayles briefly offers another one of his stomach-turning cameos as a preacher, but at least he's only in it for a minute or two (unlike his genuinely irritating Ring Lardner impersonation in Eight Men Out) and he's on much more solid grounds with his impressive ensemble cast - a young Chris Cooper on excellent form, Mary McDonnell before she got irritating, James Earl Jones before he stopped acting, David Strathairn, Bob Gunton and Will Oldham among them. You get the sense that Sayles likes his characters and cares for them. It's that which prevents the film from slipping into easy dogma and posturing and which makes it still seem surprising and shocking when the inevitable violence breaks out. And it's that that helps you overlook the flaws and embrace its many strengths.",1128470400,,1717,5.157706093189964
864899,2,6304383657,"I've just read the reviews of the DVD version,and want to let people know that the sound is as lousy on the Evergreen Entertainment VHS tape as they say it is on the DVD. I bought the movie new and watched it last night,and if you don't use the close-captioned display,you miss maybe 10% of the spoken words. There are whole scenes were not a single word is heard. If you couldn't read them from the screen,you wouldn't have any idea what is being said. It also has the same problems with the nighttime scenes filmed on the mountain. The lighting is so dark you can't see a thing that is going on. It is inexcuseable for them to produce a movie without any quality control whatsoever. Hard to believe they produced and sold this tape,and nobody envolved in the process even watched it.

I gave it two stars based purely on the technical quality of the recording,NOT the plot or the actors.

Beyond that,it is a very gripping story with 1st class acting by everybody involved. I agree with the reviewers who state that the director's and producers Marxist views are on full display and distort reality to the point where ""union=good,business=evil"". Life ain't that simple. There was and is as much evil in the union management as there was in the management of any business,and nothing on earth has ever managed to match the evils of communism.

Having said all that,the union was clearly neccessary for the workers living in ""Company Towns"" in America during that period. They wouldn't have been neccessary if the Rockefellers and others hadn't tried to bring feudalism to America by buying these towns and turning the workers into serfs with no rights or freedom at all. What made this even worse were the politicians in the state capitals and in DC took company money and let them get away with it. Even FDR sent Army troops in to protect non-union workers during a coal strike,and the local DA's would allow the company goons to kill local workers without even bothering to have them arrested,much less put on trial.

One day maybe people will realize that nature will always win,and that nature demands that for every action,there is a reaction. Nothing happens in a vacuum. The communist organizers and agitators would have never been able to get in and establish a foothold without the companies being so brutal and greedy. It's a wonder to me that the workers didn't get fed up and hang the company men and owners. Many of them sure deserved hanging. In turn the unions went too far once THEY got in the drivers seat,so they are on their way out now.

At any rate,this movie tells a story that needs to be told. I doubt there are very many people alive in America today who really remember the company towns of old,and damn few under 40 who have even heard of them. These company towns were not only in the coal fields,but also in the textile belt and the tobacco belt. This is a lesson in history the younger generations need to be made aware of to prevent a return to it. This is especially true today given all the illegal aliens being brought into America to work cheap. If we are not careful it may happen again,and it may result in widespread revolution this time.

I only hope a decent DVD version of this movie comes out. When and if it does,I hope every high school social studies and US history teacher in America show it to their students and get them discussing what happened.",1123977600,16,3395,4.584843492586491

864901,4,6304383657,"While parts of this movie are historically accurate, the lead character, Joe Kenehan and many of the events surrounding him are fiction.  Writer and Director, John Sayles' communist sympathy is obvious.  His Joe Kenehan is depicted as a labor pacifist.  In reality, the communists in the labor movement of the 1920's were anything but pacifist.  My Dad, (1893-1975), a sometime union organizer and always loyal union man, had absolutely no use for the International Workers of the World (I.W.W., Wobblies) or other communist front groups.  To a man, they agitated for violent takeover of the mines.

  It was providential that ordinary miners caught between reactionary coal operators and their thugs (Baldwin-Phelps, Pinkerton, and garden variety toughs) on the one hand, and the communists pushing for violent revolution on the other, were eventually able to work their way through to collective bargaining with the coal operators.

  The United Mine Workers, under John L. Lewis, (elected President in 1920), was able to marginalize the communists while at the same time struggling against the operators.  Eventually, the coal operators saw the futility of hiring detective agents to counter union organizers and the violence subsided.

  The turning point was the July 1921 assassination of unarmed Sid Hatfield on neighboring McDowell County Courthouse steps where he arrived in response to a summons.  In the wake of all the violence, the people finally recoiled at this breathtaking disregard for the law.  After the assassination, the union organizers gained strength and upped the ante, culminating in the ""Battle of Blair Mountain"", where 10,000 miners faced off against the US Army.  As cooler heads prevailed, the miners took up the United Mine Workers cry ""A fair day's pay for a fair day's work"" instead of calls for class warfare promoted by the radicals.  When these developments became clear, public support swung to the miners.  The coal operator's resistance crumbled and the United Mine Workers triumphed.

  The depiction of the Baldwin-Phelps agents is fairly accurate.  The eviction of the miner from the Company house is right on target.  My parents were evicted in just this way.  Sid Hatfield is correctly shown as sympathetic to the union but except for local issues, he was essentially apolitical.  He and Mayor Testerman were just doing the job they were elected to do.  The evictions of the miners (constituents) in Matewan were illegal because the Baldwin-Phelps agents did not have proper eviction papers.

  Evictions were common throughout the coal fields, especially when there was labor strife.  My parents were evicted in 1919 by Baldwin-Phelps agents because some union literature turned up in the mine and Dad was accused of putting it out.  He was fired and evicted by Company detectives the same day, but that's another story ....

  In summary, the movie is well done and worth your time.  As long as one is aware of, and can get past John Sayles' shaping of the story to fit his Marxist views, it is an entertaining and educational movie.

  Remember, the real pacifists were Sid Hatfield and Mayor Testerman.  They tried to uphold the law.

  P.S.  To understand the mission of the Industrial Workers of the World, look up the I.W.W. preamble and constitution on the internet.  Also, look up John L. Lewis.  You'll probably be surprised to learn he was a lifelong Republican!",1117843200,14,3419,5.132727272727273

The union troubles in the coal fields involved long waiting-out periods, interrupted occasionally by sporadic confrontations. Not much goes on during the waiting; the violence is over in a hurry: if a movie is going to focus on these aspects only, the movie will suffer. The movie only half-heartedly tries to portray any of the people, other than stereotypical views of oppressor vs. oppressed. There are some interesting ideas here: a group of blacks are brought in to work the mines and, despite prejudice, are persuaded to join the strikers. But not much is done with this situation.

However, those others do not get the responses that Sayles has evoked because they don't have half the movie making talent that Sayles possesses. There is no fence-sitting when watching his films, and that's because his visions and messages are clear, uncompromising and passionate. Matewan is his highest achievement in those regards.
Using the coal miners' unionization efforts of the 1920s as his springboard, Sayles explores one of the dark truths at the heart of free-market capitalism: the unblinking willingness of those in power to crush--physically and spiritually--those who work.
Sayles' gritty realism, the gaunt faces of the actual citizens of West Virginia who serve as extras in the film, Haskell Wexler's recreation of a long-gone era, and, of course, the great performances all around, drive that dark point home. Sayles' script, although a little long-winded at points, illustrates well how employers pit worker against worker, worker against scab, scab against scab. In fact, the workers do as much violence to each other as the bosses do to them. Don't dismiss this as a masnifesto disguised as a film. In the tradition of On the Waterfront (also based on an actual event), the characters, situations, and dialogue are all convincing.
This is a great film but be sure to see it on video, not DVD, as others have pointed out.

864987,4,6304383657,"This 1987 film, written and directed by John Sayles, is based on a real incident from the 1920, when workers from a West Virginia coal mine went on strike.  Chris Cooper stars as a labor union organizer who comes to the town which is run the Company that  have just brought in a trainload of black men as well as a group of Italian families to do the work of the strikers.  James Earl Jones is cast as the leader of the blacks who says out loud that he understands people can't help calling him the ""N"" word, but no man can ever call him a ""scab"".  Will Oldham is cast as a 14-year old mine worker and sometimes preacher.  There are heroes and villains in this film, and Kevin Tighe and Gordon Clapp are the kind of bad guys you love to hate.
The pace is slow as the story unfolds, each actor giving depth to his or her role.  The Union is represented as a good and unifying force for the diverse types of people caught up in the drama.  The company is represented as bad.  Really bad.  Not only did they exploit their workers and push people out of their homes, they also did not stop at brutal murder.  There were enough personal stories to keep the film interesting although I found some of the speeches a little long and talky.  It was all about mood and bleakness and John Sayles sure is a master of setting the mood.  Most of the extras in the film lived in the area of Appalachia where it was shot and the close-ups of their faces added to the film's authenticity.
One of the problems was that the transfer of the film to DVD wasn't done well.  The sound was muffled and some of the words were indistinct.  And the shots set in the forest were so dark that it was hard to tell what was going on.  I enjoyed the film although I thought it was too long.  Followers of John Sayles work will enjoy it though, as well as those with an interest in union struggle.",1047772800,62,1864,4.179271708683474

I just got it from Netflix and was very disappointed with the transfer and the sound quality. I'm nothing like a cinemaphile or audiophile but this was pretty bad. The sound is especially muddy and full of hiss, when combined with the thick West Virginia accents of all the actors makes it near impossible to understand some lines. The VHS version is MUCH better, which is pretty sad, analog sound better than digital.

864991,5,6304383657,"Quite simply, Matewan is the best labor film since 1954's Salt of the Earth. There are flaws. Sayles crowds too much into his screenplay, as though no aspect of labor's long struggle should be left out. Moreover, the movie at times comes awkwardly closer to an organizer's handbook than to an artistic recreation. Still, what's up there, on the screen, far surpasses anything depicting America's hidden history in decades, including the badly compromised but award-winning Norma Rae. Chris Cooper shines as the low-key organizer, and who else but an independent filmmaker would dare present a red in sympathetic light. I like the way he thoroughly Americanizes Cooper, unlike the sinister foreign weasles of studio stereotype. Outstanding too is Kevin Tighe  as an arrogant union-buster who, as the screenplay makes clear, is also a WWI war hero, having killed many Germans and proud of it. In fact the contrast between the two sides is capsulated by Cooper's observation that the war was about workers killing workers for the benefit of industrialists and politicians. A point Tighe could never comprehend, but one Eugene Debs could not have said better.
The photography and costuming are outstanding, conveying genuine period flavor. The town of Matewan appears appropriately gritty and depressed, lending a nobility to those who defend it. Moreover, the struggle, as Sayles shows, is not only the classic labor vs. capital, but for the soul of Christianity in which Will Oldham's social gospel competes with Sayles' (in a bit part) hellfire and brimstone. Like Salt of the Earth, feminist themes occasionally surface with vivid force, such that it's no surprise when the disrespectful Tighe gets his final comeuppance from a woman. The ending is suitably ambiguous, with a begrimed Oldham staring balefully into the camera and into the future. Sayles has always had a strong social conscience. Here however he shows real guts in taking on themes that send cold shivers down Hollywood's spine as studio heads cast a wary eye toward their Wall St. bankrollers. Like so much else, Matewan demonstrates that in America, truth, such as it is, is only to be found on the margins. Thank goodness for these margins, like independent filmmaking, Matewan, and John Sayles.",1032739200,18,2265,5.1716621253406

864994,4,6304383657,"'Matewan' reeks of authentic American History.  We are so used to a certain, triumphalist, distorted version of 'America' transmitted throughout the globe, it's refreshing to be reminded that there are other Americas, other communities, other histories - some deeply shameful, some quietly inspiring.  In telling the violent, unmythic Western story of corporate greed, violence and murder against labour poverty and resistance, John Sayles seems to bring, as the cliche says, a sepia photograph to life.  From the creak of the frame buildings to the dank, dangerous mines; from the accents and idioms of dialect to various national laments and protest songs; from worn costumes to significant decor - everything in this film bypasses the museum mummifying of the period film, and feels lived in, real, the way it must have been.
Of course, this is a carefully crafted illusion that becomes increasingly apparent as the film continues.  Imposed on this meticulous atmosphere and re-embodiment is a characteristically didactic and contrived Sayles script.  The bad guys are simply vicious; the good guy is a saint too impotently good to live in such an America; the workers have the dignity of being flawed and complex.  The film is full of Ken Loach-like political speeches (at least Sayles humorously acknowledges this by himself playing a hellfire, reactionary preacher), and some of the intercutting (e.g. between a prayer meeting and a union meeting; like Pasonlini, Sayles taps into the radical, proto-socialist impulses behind Christ's teachings) is hardly subtle.  Some of the plot developments - including a misplaced love-letter, a false accusation of rape and eavesdropping in a cupboard - are the cliches of Victorian melodrama.
That none of this detracts from the power of 'Matewan' is due to the sensitvity of Haskell Wexler's cinematography; the solemn dignity of the acting; the savage indignation that went into the making of the film; and the brave refusal to dilute the stern politics with a trite love story.  More a liberal than a left-wing polemic, much of the film's brilliance lies in the way the period story reflects on Reagan's America - the hypocrisy of a conservatism trumpeting family values while allowing an unchecked capitalism that destroys those families; the glorification of selfishness at the expense of communities; institutional racism; the excessive war-mongering to deflect domestic problems, and the centrality of a gun culture - without once destroying its integrity.",1013731200,6,2509,5.366412213740458

There are no mediocre performances here -- and Chris Cooper, Mary McDonnell and James Earl Jones are extraordinary (as are many of the actors you've never heard of).  The subject matter is rather hard to watch (poor coal miners getting abused by their employers), but it's worth getting past that.

Matewan is a cold heart in american history,when workers actually cared about their fellows,and were willing to put themselves, LITERALLY, on the line. This story takes place in WestVa. in the 1920's. The always excellent Chris Cooper{a sayles staple} is brilliant as the pacifist union leader of the united Mine Workers. James earlJones,the corporate shill who  was once an accomplished actor, and turns out what might be the finest performance of his career as a poor mine worker.

Matewan offers students a rich portrait of the fight for unionization that I could not provide them in any other way. The only trouble my students had was with the Southern accents. I wrote up an outline for them, including some of the outstanding quotes from Chris Cooper's character, and that seemed to help.

865086,5,6304383657,"Everyone who loves and appreciates movies should revere Sayles as the most coherent, consistent and independent voice of American cinema. Through a succession of truly great and criminally unrecognised films (Brother from Another Planet; Return of the Secaucus Seven; Eight Men Out; Lone Star) Sayles powerfully projects the earthy, progressive and - yes - left-wing convictions that once informed the views of the majority of ordinary American working men and women. The cinema of Sayles is somewhat like the music of Woody Guthrie - grounded in the views and experience of ordinary people, tinged with melancholy, yet coupled to a vision of a better America. At a time when even an enjoyable popcorn movie like Gladiator is confused as progressive filmmaking, Sayles' movies are the perfect reminder that there is still a REAL cinema of commitment in much the same way that somewhere in the midst and to the left of the Democratic Party there is still a REAL progressive movement. Like his English counterpart Ken Loach, Sayles chooses not to shy away from progressive presumptions in his storytelling - and the resulting integrity of his work accordingly demands respect no matter what your political viewpoint. Amongst his illustrious films, Matewan towers above all as Sayles' magnificent and epic signature film. Telling the heroic and tragic tale of the Virginia coalminers' strike, Sayles sides squarely and refreshingly (for an American film) with the striking workers. As with Eight Men Out (the story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox World Series scam), his view of the interests, needs and sentiments of owners is unrelentingly unsympathetic and scathing as he reveals them for what they were: ruthless, greedy robber-barons who built their fortune on the sweat and backs of American labour. But the quality and depth of Sayles' understanding of strike dynamics allows him to avoid the potential counter-pitfall of romanticizing union solidarity. Instead, he reveals with great frankness the racism, suspicion, manipulation, violence and treachery that oftentimes see workers self-destruct their own cause. The manipulated role of religion, church and authority does not escape Sayles' penetrating gaze either as he reminds us of uncomfortable truths in the history of class struggle in the US. Chris Cooper is SUPERB as the union organizer sent South to unionise the striking miners. Sayles regulars Mary McDonnell and David Strathairn provide strong support. Strathairn - as the laconic six-gun toting local Sheriff - is particularly rousing in his role as ultimate protector of the mining community. But before you think this movie is some long, boring, red flag waving political lecture, let me give you the good news quickly. THIS MOVIE ROCKS! Sayles' decision to play it like a Western is inspired - and it delivers in terms of every aspect of expectation in this regard (including, yes, the High Noon-style showdown). Riveting, violent and riddled with intrigue, this is a film that would not be out of place next to The Wild Bunch or Shane in your collection. That it also delivers powerful food for thought and that its heart - and head - is in the right place, will make it possibly the best movie in your collection that no one's ever heard of. It's easily in my Top Ten list of all-time great movies.",989107200,6,3321,5.129151291512915
