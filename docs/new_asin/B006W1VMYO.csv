5022087,5,B006W1VMYO,"I purchased all 4 seasons from Shout Factory.  Then I tried for Season 5.  No luck.  I contacted them and was told they didn't have the license for the last 4 seasons.  I contacted Universal NBC and was told they had no plans to release the final 4 seasons.  The only thing we can do is pester them to release them.  Maybe they don't know how many fans there are out here that want the final 4 seasons.  Don't, under any circumstances, purchase one of those complete 8 season deals.  They are copies from tv and are terrible.  I did and am now trying to get my money ($130. +) back.  Here's hoping!.",1390262400,3,599,4.221238938053097

5022089,5,B006W1VMYO,"All you Ironside fans need to get a region-free DVD player so you can play back seasons 5-8 of this terrific Raymond Burr series.  Season 5 introduces Elizabeth Baur as Officer Fran Belding.  Barbara Anderson (Eve Whitfield) left the series after season 4, leaving an opening for the young, headstrong daughter of a police officer friend of Chief Ironside, who'd been murdered by a gambling concern.
In the opener ""Contract: Kill Ironside"" a gangster hires a top hitman (played by James Olsen, a terrific actor) who plots elaborate methods to take out his target, and he has a perfect record.
Baur's character of Fran Belding is fleshed out in the episode ""Dear Fran,"" in which her cousin, Bobby Adams, has jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.  But has he?  Mysterious happenings suggest otherwise -- but Ironside smells a plot.
Further episodes allow Don Galloway's character Sgt. Brown to get screentime.
In many ways season five was the epitome of the series, the show highlighting a new theme by Quincy Jones, great scores by Oliver Nelson and Billy Goldenberg's score in ""Dear Fran"" is especially haunting.",1385596800,5,1109,4.978378378378379

You must have a dvd player that can play region 4. I have one and have never regretted buying one. The picture is of very good quality, so is the sound.
