8486152,4,B005TGFBOA,"A most unusual film, featuring essentially one character, a Latin American man.  He gets a call, drives to a country inn near Ithaca, New York, cleans himself up, and then...what?  I won't tell you, but the entire film is the wait to see what is going on and why he's there.  The actor is interesting to watch, but if you don't think so, you won't enjoy the film, as there are many incredibly long scenes watching the details of his preparation.  The why of what takes place is not clear but leaves you thinking.  The film is beautifully shot.",1408233600,3,543,4.444444444444445
