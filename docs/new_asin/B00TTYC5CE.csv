7022559,5,B00TTYC5CE,Great fireplace and scenery. The music adds to the ambiance.,1451692800,,60,5.1
7022560,5,B00TTYC5CE,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD collection.  You can choose from so many options.  One DVD plays fireplace views - up close.  The sound of the wood crackling and the steady, clear view of the logs burning fill my living room with such a warm feeling.

The other DVD has various views - fireplace, candles, winter scenes.  You can choose just the image, image with music or just music.  It plays seamlessly.  The quality of the pictures are amazing, the sounds are beautiful.  The music is a soft flute playing Christmas music and then soft music throughout the DVD.  It is so treasured that I bought two and gave my mom one.  She loves it.",1450396800,,634,4.482456140350878
7022561,5,B00TTYC5CE,Two DVD's and the quality is great.  We love to have it on when we have guests and the ambiance is quiet and elegant.,1450051200,,117,3.875
7022562,5,B00TTYC5CE,"I have several Christmas fireplace DVDs (The Happy Holiday Hearth, Yule Log, Yule Log 2, etc) and this Fireplaces & Hymns has by far the clearest, crispest fireplace scene that I've ever seen on a DVD! The quality of the recording is amazing. There are several different types of fireplaces and scenes to choose from. It's important to note that only the music is on The Long Winter evenings disc, which the other disc is strictly different types of crackling fireplace scenes. Great quality visuals on both DVDs with calm, relaxing music in the background on disc 2. Great buy and a good gift to give!",1449705600,2,602,4.688679245283019
7022563,4,B00TTYC5CE,This was for the elderly in-laws. They like it and are able to navigate the various screens relatively easily.,1449187200,2,110,4.842105263157895
7022564,5,B00TTYC5CE,This is a very excellent DVD.  The fireplaces are excellent and the music with them is great.  I plan to use this DVD in a meeting I am having with a Christmas theme.  A great buy.,1447804800,,180,3.9444444444444446
7022565,5,B00TTYC5CE,We purchased this to run in our Cafe during a brunch with about 45 guests. Everyone loved it  and we're going to use it in the Cafe every weekend during the holiday season. A really well done DVD and a great bargain for the price. I don't you'll be disappointed.,1447027200,,262,4.24
7022566,5,B00TTYC5CE,"I love this DVD set.  The first DVD is the best of winter from the sparkling snow falls to the glowing candles. This DVD offers a choice of two fireplaces and the natural sounds of fire or music, glowing candles, and beautiful snow scenes. The candles and the snow scenes are ever changing in a slow relaxing fade. As with all their amazing DVDs they can be looped separately or as a group.  This gives you the best of winter without any interruption or cold, wet shoes from walking through the snow.  Each fireplace scene on the first DVD is 25 minutes of a glowing, crackling, ever changing fire as you would see in your own fireplace.

The second DVD offers you a choice of five fireplaces that burn and crackle.  Each track gives you the choice of the sounds of a real fire as it burns or lovely music.  Very relaxing and enjoyable.  I especially enjoy the Christmas music, it is professionally recorded for a high quality of sound.

 Both DVDs are professionally recorded in HD offering colors that are brilliant and clarity that is excellent. There is no panning or just half a fire on either DVD. The whole fire is shown and burns down just as it would in your fireplace.",1434758400,6,1178,4.4672897196261685
7022567,5,B00TTYC5CE,"This is my first fireplace DVD and I think it is awesome. On the DVD there are five different fires and they all look very realistic. You can hear the cracking of logs and you even think to feel the warmth that the fire radiates. Since I cannot install a fireplace in my house, this is a very good alternative, just wonderful. Now I have my fireplace and it can be seen on the TV whenever I want to. The quality of the photography is fantastic, I am very happy for the DVD.
In the long winter evenings DVD you can choose between many possibilities. There are fireplaces, candle lights and winter landscapes with falling snow. Also you can choose what you want to hear. Either real fire sounds, music or fire sounds and music together. Various songs can be selected, all suit very well for the relaxing and romantic atmosphere. The entire DVD is wonderful, but I am very excited by the fireplace with Christmas music, I love it. This DVD Set is amazing.",1429056000,5,952,4.445714285714286
7022568,5,B00TTYC5CE,"This 2 disc set is wonderful. The discs are very different from each other and you get much more variety in what you can watch. The Long Winter Evenings disc is peaceful and calming - it has BEAUTIFUL white candles burning (my favorite), fires and fireplaces and you get to choose from the cracking fire sounds, music, or both! Winter is beautiful and is especially nice to see when you don't have to be outside in it!. The winter track is so enjoyable for me to watch from the comfort of my home. The music is very relaxing, not loud or annoying. I like the fact that you have your choice of sounds. Sometimes I'm in the mood for music, other times not - no problem here - it's your choice. The tranquility of watching the candles burn and flicker is my favorite (or maybe the winter track is!). They're all so good and this is only the one disc! The other disc is all about fireplaces - it gives you a choice of 5 different fires and they're all pleasing to watch and listen to - when it's cold having a fireplace DVD playing on the TV is very comforting. The photography on both discs is excellent. Overall, this set gives you quite a bit of diversity in your choices and I'm glad I own it. That pretty much says it all for me. Great job.",1428710400,10,1241,4.2405063291139244

8703075,1,B00TTYC5CE,I recently purchased this dvd and it is a waste of money. Very low resolution recording and there is a typo on the main menu. Not what was described!!!,1478649600,,151,4.241379310344827
8703076,4,B00TTYC5CE,"I bought this item because I thought I'd have lots of choices but not really...the first dvd is
5 fireplaces with crackling sounds, nice but they are too much alike with no option to
add music... If you only care about fireplaces , then this one is for you.

The second dvd is more festive but only showcases 8 Christmas songs on a loop,
it gets old pretty quickly, another thing which made me a little angry is that the
outdoor scenery and the candles segment are the exact same ones as on many
of their other dvds , as if we wouldn't notice... It reminds me of musical CDS that
keep getting repackaged with a different title, I overall love the Ambient Collection
but this is very disappointing to a Christmas fan like me.

But the quality is great and I do use the fireplace on the second dvd because
it is soothing, not ""raging"" fireplaces with cropped images.",1478131200,,864,4.39375
8703077,5,B00TTYC5CE,"This is mesmerizing, and very relaxing to watch.  I really like it - especially at Christmas time for some reason, or just a cold winter day.",1467936000,,141,4.423076923076923
8703078,4,B00TTYC5CE,"This is a very realistic-looking fire. I especially like that it is on a continuous loop, so I can watch it indefinitely without reloading it.",1462492800,3,142,4.72
