Will vary review if they compensate. Spent $ not set aside for this for a dying friend because their prog to help those in need let her fall thru the cracks.

No matter where they perform you are in for a treat. The nice thing is I can see all this from the comfort of my home. I think its easy to get hooked on the Gaither bunch, all of them are so special. What a family of probably the best singers I have every heard. ENJOY...",1359244800,2,438,4.104651162790698

4332340,3,B004DEVSE6,"As often as I can, I collect DVD from this group. I have many, but do have two or three that are not my favorites. Nonetheless, there is something special about each one, including this one. So, I will probably get Majesty too, to show my support. (Not that I am so important, but just because I have received so much from what these folks do.)

I do kind of wonder whether to get Majesty, because this one seemed to lack something, and it was not the genre, or whatever, but something else. I am really not qualified to be too specific about what was lacking, except to say that I was disappointed. A few of the songs were very good, but, in general, something somewhere did not seem to flow.

Now, I realize that many really love this DVD, and this is good, because these are really good folks. And! Of course, sometimes one of the DVDs recorded at a particular place/time is better than the other, so I will most likely enjoy the other one more. So, I know I will give more thought to this, and may -at a future time, change my mind about this one. Stranger things have happened.

4332341,5,B004DEVSE6,I love this DVD.  The Giathers have done it again.  I love the music and the homecoming family.  I could see what troopers they are out there singing their hearts out in the cold.,1300233600,,179,4.205882352941177
4332342,5,B004DEVSE6,"Buckled up for the cold weather, the Gaither Homecoming Friends,  aboard the ms Zaandam, travel to across Alaska's Inside Passage for the Alaskan Homecoming 2011.  The backdrop is gorgeous scenery, with majestic views and the music and fun are plenty.  Sure, it lacks the intimacy and closeness from earlier concert series, but, likewise it is enjoyable.

Many of the Homecoming Favorites are here, historic music, newer songs, and some old favorites.  And what a fresh sound to the beautiful ""How Great Thou Art"", that features Reggie Smith, Wes Hampton, Stephen Hill, Gene McDonald, and Larnelle Harris, who also sings ""The Star Spangled Banner"".  David Phelps and Wes Hampton sing ""America the Beautiful"".

Some newer music,  ""I See a Crimsom Stream""  Janet Paschal, Charlotte Ritchie, Sheri Easter.  And someone new to me,  the  bass sound of Gene McDonald with ""How Big is God"". He joins others for "" Hard Times Come Again No More"";  ""Can He, Could He"" by Reggie & Ladye Love Smith;  ""Something Within"" features Stephen Hill.

I love the upbeat  ""I'm Feelin' Fine"" Gaither Friends; ""I'm Working on a Road"" with the Easters, ""I Got Joy"", and Joy Gardner's ""Joy Comes in the Morning"".

One of my favorite singers is Russ Taff, ""Somebody's Comin'"" and he sings with Michael English ""We Will Stand"".  The Gaither Vocal Band sings their ""Better Day"", ""These are They"" and the story is told on the song ""Clean"" came about.

Two favorites from the Homecoming series are the Hoppers ""That's Him"" and the Isaacs sing ""Does Jesus Care"".  One of the original Speer Family members is here, Mary Tom (Speer) on ""My Savior First of All"".

A ventriloquist entertains the audience.
