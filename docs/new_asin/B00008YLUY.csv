1867410,4,B00008YLUY,"In the urban decay of metropolitan Detroit during the somber and gray winter Nick Tellis (Jason Patric) and Henry Oak (Ray Liotta), both narcotic detectives, set out to find the killer(s) of Oak's former partner. What follows is an adventure that will surely take you on a ride through drug dealing craziness and police deceptions. Who you think is a bad guy could turn out to be the good guy and vice versa. There are enough twists and turns during NARC to keep you satisfied until the end. And to top it all off, the ending will leave you guessing and wanting more. The cinematography is beautiful -- chasing the drug addict and undercover detective down the alley in addition to four pictures in one are only a few examples. Just the creativity involved in filming NARC deserves an honorable mention. Go see this movie if you're interested in gutsy police dramas and aren't bothered by blood, guts and violence.",1042502400,2,914,4.71875
1867411,5,B00008YLUY,"Great movie. Very hard-hitting action/drama. Great ending, leaving the main character with an interesting moral dilemma and leaving the viewer wondering what he/she would do in the character's place. A great change from all those movies that show everything wrapped up in a nice neat fairy-tale package at the end.",1042416000,3,314,5.3
1867412,5,B00008YLUY,"Narc is perhaps one the most original, exciting and gritty movies on police corruption since Serpico. If you're looking for a no nonsense movie filled with plot twists, great acting, and suspense this movie is for you. Hands down, the cast was amazing and believable. I am happy that Ray Liotta selected this project because he hasn't been this good in a movie since the Goodfellas! You will leave the movie shaken as if Ray was yelling down your throat. I am also thankful that Jason Patric(who is a underrated actor)decided to stop taking useless roles such as Speed 2 Cruise Control and instead took on a role where he could show the movie audience his intelligence and rising star. Joe Carnahan also had a lot to prove as he did shed his Tarantino-wannabe style from his first movie. Other movies in the police corruption genre such as Training Day were lead by great actors as well, yet their big budget did ruin its authenticity. However even with a very small budget, Carnahan was still able to make a very authentic slick piece of filmaking. Narc was dark and gritty in many ways such as its violence. The violence was strong and brutal especially in the jaw dropping opening scene and the unforgettable ending, so do take that under consideration before taking young children into the picture. This film is a true gem, it's indeed a film worth driving to select theatres to see it, you will love it.",1042329600,24,1408,4.658634538152611
1867413,5,B00008YLUY,"This film blew me away.  From the opening scene with Jason Patric to the end, ""Narc"" had me on the edge of my seat!  I found the beginning a bit slow but the film picks up its pace and the climax is great.  This is a must see!",1042329600,,226,3.6666666666666665
1867414,4,B00008YLUY,"NARC, starring Jason Patric and Ray Liotta is a story not of good cop, bad cop, but of bad cop and worse cop.
Both are undercover Narcotics officers in the Detroit police department.  Both of their careers are in jeopardy and they are given one last chance in the murder investigation of a fellow officer.  My thoughts:
-Ray Liotta gives an extremely powerful performance.  He has a larger than life presence and as a viewer, his rage is palpable.
-Jason Patric's performance was OK, nothing special, but he and Liotta make a good duo.
-In a bit part, Busta Rhymes of rap fame, gave a good performance as a suspected murderer.
The plot and the writing are good and they do a good job of keeping things moving along.  But, it just seemed like there was something lacking, so for this reason I only give it four stars.  But, it is a gritty look at cops and their lives.",1042243200,,867,4.427672955974843
1867415,4,B00008YLUY,"When a cop drama is described as ""gritty"", you know to expect extremely brutal violence, cops breaking rules to terrorize criminal suspects into confessions, grimy cinematography, terse dialogue, and lots of shouting. It's a genre that paints in broad brush strokes, and Narc is no exception. In this case, though, the performances by Ray Liotta and Jason Patric provide the nuance that elevate this movie above your usual television cop drama episode.
A scene when Liotta breaks out in laughter when he hears Patric's theory on how a murder victim might have killed himself gave me an unusual shot of joy. It's wonderfully spontaneous. Liotta gained some weight for this role, and he moves with a certain heft and physical presence that he hasn't had in previous roles. Patric sheds all his glamor in potraying an officer haunted by his past and driven to uncover the truth about the death of Liotta's previous partner.
I could have done without director Joe Carnahan's obvious stylistic attempts to heighten the drama (something that doomed his previous film Blood Guts Bullets & Octane). The opening handheld shots captured by a sprinting cameraman made me ill, the occasional shots of Patric brooding alone in a park rolled my eyes, and the rapid flashes to the alleged murder scene at the heart of the movie actually draw more attention away from the story than it should. All the advance Hollywood buzz (the movie caught the eye of Hollywood bigwigs after Sundance and some private screenings in L.A. and Tom Cruise jumped in as executive producer) will bring the audience in. Once they're in their seats, the camera needs only to stay on the two leads to keep their interest. Fortunately, it does just that for most of the movie.",1042156800,,1736,4.908163265306122
1867416,5,B00008YLUY,"I have no idea if writer/director Joe Carnahan believes that America's war on drugs is backfiring and causing far more harm than good.  It may indeed not be fair to describe ""Narc"" as a film with a message. Nevertheless, it forcefully reminds us that the unintentional consequences of these laws result in the corruption of both the police and our overall system of justice.  Detroit Police Officer Nick Tellis (Jason Patric) accidentally kills an innocent bystander during a drug bust.  He also develops a drug dependency problem while performing his duty as an undercover narc.  Neither tragedy, needless to add, would have occurred if drugs were decriminalized.  The man is now psychological warped and finds it difficult to function as a cop, husband, or parent.  Is there any way that he might find redemption? A fellow narcotics officer is found shot to death.  Tellis is assigned to partner with Lieutenant Henry Oak (Ray Liotta) to find out what happened.  Both men are more than willing to torture suspects and violate their constitutional rights.  The end, in their way of looking at the world, virtually justifies any means. They might feel a sense of guilt, but fighting the drug war is supposedly more important than honoring the moral norms of our country.
""Narc"" is a beautifully written story containing some of the best dialogue of any film that I've seen in a long time.  The acting is utterly fantastic and the action is nonstop and brutal.  ""Narc"" should disturb any law abiding American that doesn't want our country turned into a gestapo styled police state.  One does not need to be a political Liberal (and I am not!) to conclude that something is wrong when the system inadvertently encourages such despicable behavior. This is not escapist entertainment and the ending will not be deemed satisfactory.  Why is that?  There is no way that the ludicrous war on drugs can possibly be won--and therefore any ending to such a film as ""Narc"" is doomed to be frustrating and even nihilistically hopeless.  Wars are meant to be relatively short termed events that ultimately end in some sort of victory.  That of course will never be in the case when society attempts to prevent some of its citizens from indulging in self destructive behavior.  Human beings must sometimes be permitted to go to hell in a hand basket if they choose to do so. I also highly recommend that everyone view Jason Patric's earlier 1991 masterpiece ""Rush.""  This great film similarly revolved around the human carnage resulting from our inane reluctance to legalize mind altering drugs.",1042156800,,2581,4.935185185185185
1867417,5,B00008YLUY,"I saw NARC last week, after reading a few of its excellent reviews, and thought it was terrific. The two main actors are fabulous in it.  I love mysteries and this one was great with plenty of realistic and believable twists and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat.",1042156800,,269,4.173076923076923
1867418,5,B00008YLUY,"I saw NARC at Sundance in Jan 2002.  From the opening scene I was on my chair's edge with a racing heart - don't stroll in late for this movie!  I thought I had it figured out, but I was wrong.  It kept me interested and thinking.  It's gritty and dark, but does have a few light scenes that introduce ironic levity.
It's a cop story with a brain and complexity.  I recommend it!",1039564800,15,379,4.0675675675675675

1867488,4,B00008YLUY,"Good acting by Liotta and Pactrick  Good story and a bit of a surprise ending.  It's obviously a low budget film the way and the speed it was filmed at, but well done, nonetheless.  It's a bit difficult  to keep up with some of the story line as it jumps around some.  It comes together at the end, but I still had a few loose ends I could put together.  That didn't take away from the movie so much, but would have been nice to understand what was Jason Patrick's character's problem with the dept and being fired, and the dead cops wife.  That wasn't so clear  Overall a good action, suspense movie that never really dragged out.  Very violent and the language was more than rough.",1469577600,3,683,4.31496062992126

1867493,4,B00008YLUY,"I saw this movie so so long time ago and as far as I remember, it was not so good.
I bought the dvd because of other people's good comments.
I saw it again. It was really a slow ride but one thing different was from some point till the end I was totally involved in the movie and I didn't know that the movie ended till the ending title rolled.
The movie is all about suspicion and the ending was kind of surprise knowing that Ray was actually not the one who did kill the colleague.
Ray Liotta was a bad guy for years in movies. But in this one, he wasn't.
That was the point in this movie.
And I liked it that way.
Without that, this movie could have been nothing.",1453161600,,666,3.9776119402985075
1867494,4,B00008YLUY,"Yeah, nothing like this movie man. I remember about 14 yrs. back from this movie the ""NARC"" arcade game was released, and let me tell you, it was a cool game. Many quarters spent on that. I also purchased the ""Pixies"" cover of  the NARC theme song. Very cool my friend. Now let's skip 3 yrs. from this movie and the NARC video game for PS2, Xbox, and the rare PC version was made as well, featuring voices from Michael Madsen, Bill Bellamy, and Ron Powalski. Great game, a bit more ""M-Rated"", so please, from experience, ""Don't let the kids play that"". One of my favorites in the game field though, check out their soundtrack with features from Curtis Mayfield, Lyrnrd Skynrd, as well as a second disc with exclusive songs. I found the ""missing five"" songs as well. Hits from the bong- Cypress Hill, White Lines-Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Freddie's Dead- Curtis Mayfield, The Bottle-Gil Scott Heron, and Golden Brown-The Stranglers. All in all though, a great last item before I hit my first 500 dollars spent here. Thanks Amazon ;-)",1452556800,,1046,4.684782608695652

1867537,2,B00008YLUY,First half of the movie was dragged out with way too much convoluted detail before they were able to really get into the actual story.  It was a very roundabout way to get where they story was going.,1444176000,,199,4.2368421052631575
1867538,5,B00008YLUY,"Narc is one of the best movies that I have seen in recent months, As both writer and director Carnahan is brilliant. His script is well written and has plenty of tough dialogue but it is the feel and look of the film that is brilliant. On top of the toning used to taint each scene (the job is mostly washed out blues, family scenes are reds but gradually lose their taint over the film) the film uses other tricks. The framing of shots are different for each character and it really adds to the film. If you like this film it is worth hunting out the DVD just for the extras, Carnahan talks in detail about the reasons behind the composition of some shots and it is impressive to hear and understand his thought process.
This is a story of bad cop and bad cop working together, which is a relief to me since the good cop plus bad cop pairing is too over done. Joe Carnahan shows that he is an extremely talented writer and director. Narc was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002. Which is not a surprise since this was a very good film.",1439942400,2,1071,4.229268292682927

Now he is given a second chance to help solve the death of a fellow undercover policeman who had also stepped over, but in doing so he is endangering his marriage and his future.  I think I gave it a 4 star because of the twist at the end.  Some people think that Ray Liotta played it over the top, but I think he played it just right and when he told of the young girl he found at a bust it showed a emotional level below his hard exterior.  Jason Patric turned in another solid performance.  Again, this is a gritty film that is geared to action fans of that genre.  Worth a watch if you like that type of film.",1424044800,,707,4.014285714285714

1867781,5,B00008YLUY,"Have we seen similar plots in other police dramas ? Maybe. Have we seen a police drama that sets morality vs justice in a ring ? Yes. Have we seen a cop push legal procedures to its limits ? Most definitely. But have we seen police dramas use all of the above tactics and succeed in delivering an entertaining film ? Not all the time. This film succeeds.

Nick Tellis (Jason Patric) is an undercover narcotics agent that is assigned to investigate the murder of another narcotics agent named Michael Calvess. His partner, Henry Oak (Ray Liotta) is about as unstable and violent as your worst manic depressant case. After Nick unintentionally causes a woman to have a miscarriage when firing at a drug dealer he agrees to take this case that he is assigned.

Emotions run high in this crime drama as these two partners embark on a savage journey to protect their own interests. Clearly, Nick's wife disapproves of his career and especially with this particular case. Hence, why Nick requests a desk job after the investigation. We are also given a small glimpse of Henry's life during a brief conversation with Nick. Henry is a widower whose wife died of cancer sometime ago. There is no doubt that the chemistry between Nick and Henry is there and it's very enjoyable to watch.

What makes this film so captivating is not just the opening scene where we see Nick chasing a drug dealer in a bitter cold setting but the landscape of the film in its entirety. Set in Detroit, Michigan but filmed mostly in Canada one can easily visualize an inner city cesspool of violence, corruption, poverty, and sheer abandonment. Poor color saturation maybe reduced to zero, and for a good cause, too; dominating grays, faded blues, and washed out colors add a nice finishing touch to the landscape. With very few but rich characters, abandoned structures, ghostly alley ways, and an eerie feeling of desolation we are made to feel totally isolated. One can only focus on Nick and Henry's performance. Their acting and chemistry work very effectively. I was happy to see Ray Liotta receive great reviews for this one. And I have to commend Jason Patric as well.

We are invited into the private life of Nick Tellis's character as a father and a husband. The tension is ever so prevalent between him and his wife. They struggle to manage both of their emotions in a small household while simultaneously trying to raise an infant.

The music, scored by the one and only Cliff Martinez is highly effective in delivering emotional ups and downs we cannot see nor accurately describe. I would pay close attention to scenes of when Nick Tellis is alone. The sounds and tones will literally put you inside the character's mental state. Another scene to pay close attention to is the last one.

In retrospect, this film does not reinvent the wheel in the cop drama category but offers so much emotional appeal particularly in the cinematography, score and acting. Highly recommended for any film lover of cop dramas and great acting.",1411430400,,3010,4.756704980842912
1867782,5,B00008YLUY,"This is one of the most realistic movies about police procedure that I have seen. Nothing appears sensationalized, and it leaves you with the feeling that a sordid drama like this could play out in any major metropolitan police agency. The acting is spot on. The emotional tolls officers pay in both their professional and personal lives to work the streets in pursuit of justice, and most importantly, the truth is accurately conveyed. Every sequence is carefully thought out and filmed with purpose as explained in the features.

However, this movie is very different in style and content--the minimalist approach to number of characters and intelligent use of psychological twist. Ultimately, it's more like a tragedy--about love, guilt and desire to protect. The set selection was brilliant for all the outdoor scenes. The movie succeeds to project the intensity and sensitivity of a well written short story.

If I were to compare this with other movies I would mention Seven with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Or perhaps Hoffman's 'Straighttime' with Harry Dean Stanton.  Not so much for the plot but for the gritty kind of realism of the world in which the detectives/criminals  live and operate.  It's one of those films where one does not particularly like any character.  They are all kind of tainted and their lives take on a institutional kind of greenish cast. There are no hero's here, just people particularly possessed by their own demons. The characters move through the film together, each in their own individual hell's.  The plot twists and turns, you have to pay attention, and a lot of sections are by necessity bleak and detailed.  If you don't like to follow a film closely, or expect to be entertained find something else to do besides watching this one.

But in the end, we find out that the Lieutenant should have been happy going along with the higher-ups plans, because they fit his own perfectly well.
However, I give the film three stars because I enjoyed it; and I didn't spot the inconsistency until later.

Acting 3.5 stars. Character development 2 stars. There is too much dark cinematic imagery, which takes place in small dark rooms in every scene practically. It's almost as if the whole film is in Sepia tone. By some measure, this makes it hard to follow. The storyline is pretty simple yet they forced stretching it into a 2 hour unintelligible convoluted mess. A suspended narcotics officer (Jason Patrick) is given a chance for a promotion to (Homicide?) detective if he works on the [believed] homicide of another police officer. He is assigned to work with the [former] partner (Ray Liotta), of the slain officer. The entire movie is about their shakedown of druggies/dealers, to try to find those responsible. Pretty early on in the investigation, the director leads the audience believe that Ray Liotta is [potentially] a crooked cop and (could be) responsible for his former partners murder. Yet even as Jason Patrick's character uncovers compelling evidence supporting this fact, he doesn't seem to put it all together until the very end (WHAT?). This destroyed the movie for me, because it seemed clear that Liotta had killed his partner. You knew it was true, and believed it. Then at the very end of the film they tried to (unsuccessfully) throw the twist that the slain officer actually committed suicide and Ray was innocent. Problem is, -they really didn't make it clear as to how the officer actually died. I would give this movie 2 stars, but because it is so highly rated, I have to lower it 1 star to reduce the overall rating.",1390003200,2,1714,4.793918918918919

1868430,3,B00008YLUY,"My biggest issue with a film like `Narc' is that it becomes rather one-note.  It never truly develops as an entire piece but merely remains stagnant in the mood it breeds and becomes somewhat forgettable in the long run thanks to a lack of charisma.  I know that this is a gritty police drama, and so the word charisma may seem misused, but in a way it isn't.  All films, to a degree, contain charisma.  It is that special element that keeps you glued and maintains your interest.  The brown overtones melt into a blur of sorts to create a film that doesn't contain enough layers to validate our devotion.  Jason Patrick is also sourly one-note.  If it weren't for Ray Liotta and his tremendous performance (probably his finest onscreen moment) this film would be a forgettable dud.  Liotta's eyes are incredibly expressive here, creating a character that is far more than a mere clich, which is what he could have been (especially when you understand the full grasp of who he is) but he plays his character with a solid mix of misinterpreted heroism, ingrained survival and ambiguous villainy.  The pacing drags in moments to leave the film a tad dry, but it has moments of spark that I wish were elaborated.  In the end, it is a decent crime thriller that had lots of potential but lacks the right direction to coax that promise into a rich reward.",1328227200,,1350,4.5875

The cons.

It's hard to find any thing I didn't like about this film,but there are a few things that might bother some. The film is graphic and violent with some scenes of blood and torture might be to much for young kids or adults who don't like that type of thing.

1868493,4,B00008YLUY,"The Bottom Line:

Though Narc's screenplay is built on a solid foundation of cliches, the powerhouse performances, gritty camerawork, and inspired use of location (Detroit *feels* cold and lonely in the film) allow the film to rise above its tired screenplay.",1229472000,,259,5.317073170731708
1868494,4,B00008YLUY,"All too often, quality movies are in and out of theaters before audiences have a chance to see them, Narc being a perfect example of that.  For 18 months, Detroit narcotics detective Nick Tellis has been on suspension after the end result of a chase went horribly wrong.  But now, he's being asked back to help out with the case of another murdered undercover narc detective.  Tellis is teamed with a close friend of the murdered cop, Henry Oaks, himself a detective who does what he needs to do to get to a suspect, legal or not. As Tellis and Oaks unravel what really happened, with an answer that Tellis never saw coming, his personal life begins to unravel too with his wife and nine-month old son.  From the opening chase with a handheld camera to the final revelation in the end, Narc is very realistic, almost like a documentary that shows some police procedure in a murder case.  The story never feels fake and really brings the viewer in, all which makes the ending that much more effective.  You may have missed it in theaters, but don't miss it on DVD!

 In the two leads of Tellis and Oaks are two actors who aren't huge stars, well-known yes, but that helps make the characters more believable.  Jason Patric is Nick Tellis, a detective trying to get a paycheck at first but finds himself fully involved in the murder case who threatens to push away his wife with his drive.  Ray Liotta matches Patric as Detective Henry Oaks, a veteran cop who has a reputation as a bit of a hothead but doesn't really care how he gets things done.  The teaming of Patric and Liotta works perfectly as their partnership develops, and because the two are in almost every scene together, their performances carry the movie.  Rapper Busta Rhymes and Richard Chevolleau lead the supporting cast as Darnell and Steeds, two dealers who know more than they're letting on. The rest of the cast includes Chi McBride, Lina Giornofelice, and John Ortiz.

 For such a low price, $9.99, the DVD is a steal.  The disc includes the widescreen presentation that really takes advantage of the washed out colors that add to the movie's grittiness.  A making of feature is broken up into three smaller segements that add up to about 45 minutes.  It's a good feature that shows how tough it was for director Joe Carnahan to get the movie made.  Also included is a featurette with William Friedkin, director of The French Connection, talking about similarities between the two movies as well as why he enjoyed Narc so much, and to cap it off, a trailer.

Set in dreary Detroit, two Detectives (Liotta and Patric) are investigating the murder of an undercover cop who happens to be Liotta's ex-partner. Both men have their own personal demons to deal with, and as the case wears on, both men's notions of truth and justice will be put to the test.

Two fine actors, especially that Ray fella who needs to be in more films, take a story that never reveals too much of itself until necessary, and make it work.

1868551,5,B00008YLUY,"This movie went largely unnoticed in the theaters. But it is a fine and well acted movie. Ray Liotta is often noted for his work in NYC/Jersey crime dramas like 'Copland' or 'Goodfellas' but he gives a great performance here as an intense Detroit Homicide cop. I was born and raised in Detroit so I have seen how most movies miss when it comes to portraying the real Detroit (the Detroit scenes from the ridculous Beverly Hills Cops movies for instance). This movie gets it exactly right. Detroit cops and crooks do not look or act like persons from NYC or LA and the film takes the time to show that.

NARC was filmed in the winter and you can see how the car and bus fumes change the snow from white to dreary gray. Actually everything appears gray and bleak. The action scenes, much like real life violence, are frenetic and chaotic. The screenplay focuses on new partners Nick Tellis(Jason Patric) and Henry Oak(Ray Liotta) as they form an uneasy alliance to close the case of a murdered police officer who may or may not have been corrupt. The screenplay, acting, directing are all first rate.",1140998400,2,1098,4.573604060913706
1868552,4,B00008YLUY,"I usually hate ""shaky-cam"" sequences, particularly when directors decide that they are going to use them in every other scene in order to make it feel ""raw.""

I purchased NARC for an incredibly low price and was not expecting much.  However, it was clear from the opening few minutes of the film that my low expectations were about to be shattered.

I don't have a whole lot to say about NARC that hasn't been elaborated on already by Amazon reviewers.  It is a good film and a great cop film.  Its storyline is compelling and explores both of its main characters adequately.  Most electrifying is Ray Liotta, who is just magnificent in this film.  I've never seen him this good (or looking this old for that matter).

As a second effort, Joe Carnahan has given us quite a good picture, especially considering his budget.  I hope to see more things from him in the future.  Until then, I can only recommend that you see NARC and snatch up this DVD.  It's well worth it.",1129593600,3,1120,4.567839195979899

Narc is about the down and dirty streets of Motor City, Michigan and how they work. Now in this film Liotta plays a cop gone bad because to many things went wrong in his life and I'll let you find out what on your own as you watch the film. While Patric is basically just a good tough as nail's cop who just wants a transfer from undercover detective to a simple desk job for he has seen to much and his wife wants him at home now that they have a child. However this all ends up going down the toilet when Patric starts to find out how dirty Liotta is. Yet then again the witnesses of the crime case could just be lieing for Liotta has his own story that makes sense as well. So after all the sudden twists and turns are over and Patric finally get to the truth the most unexpected thing happens ,which I can't give away and that's where my review ends. To get to the bottomline I really suggest if you liked Training Day, Dark Blue, or Heat buy Narc or at least give it a try as a rental. **** out of 5 stars",1125100800,2,1145,4.088888888888889
1868555,4,B00008YLUY,"NARC isn't really a PLEASANT movie to watch.  It's about a lot of angry, messed-up people spending a lot of time sweating and under-stress.  It's set in wintry Detroit, and the film has been processed so that all the exterior shots are tinted in blue, making the whole thing a little ugly to look at.

But it has a raw power and anger that feels genuine.  This is a story that shows how people with good ideals and good intentions can nonetheless through their own frailties and lack of foresight make a royal mess of things.  In this case, we're dealing with a couple of VERY troubled cops, thrown together to solve an ugly case...at least, it's ugly politically.  Jason Patrick portrays a somewhat younger cop, who's been in some sort of suspension since a shooting went horribly wrong.  The opening scene of the movie shows this foot chase and the unpleasant aftermath, and it gets us jumpy right away.  We hear the heavy breathing, the camera work veers far from using a Steadi-cam, and when people get hurt, they howl and scream and carry on much more like you'd expect ""real"" people to do.  Patrick is given a shot at redemption if he will partner up with Ray Liotta to help solve the murder of Liotta's partner.  Reluctantly the two team up.  Each clearly respects that the other person is an experienced, capable cop, and they have an easy coming together as COPS.  When they break into an apartment, or interrogate a witness, they work together with practiced ease...they've both seen the same streets.  But as INDIVIDUALS, they don't have much in common and make no effort to be friends.  This is not a ""buddy"" movie.  Liotta is simply seething over just about everything.  He doesn't let anyone in...he's not looking for a friend or a new partner.  He just wants the job done.

Patrick has always been one of those ""internal"" actors...few facial expressions, somewhat mumbling...not very high energy.  In NARC, we see this ""passive"" side of him...but we also get to see him let loose with some good histrionics.  It lends his quiet side more depth...we know that he's just barely keeping it together.  In scenes with his wife...who has no patience for his return to the dangerous life...we see how they've lost the ability to really communicate and listen to each other.  They have a new baby they both clearly adore...but not much else.  Patrick brings a natural sadness to those scenes.  And in his police work, he lets his justifiable anger at suspects, felons, etc. carry the brunt of his personal anger.  This might be his best performance ever.

Ray Liotta is frightening and frighteningly good.  He's a spotty actor.  Sometimes a hoot (SOMETHING WILD), sometimes simply excellent (GOODFELLAS) and sometimes generic (HANNIBAL and many others).  Here he looks 10 years older than we've ever scene him.  With his white beard and extra weight, plus thick layers of coats, scarves, etc...he cuts an imposing and dangerous figure.  He's a walking time bomb...you can tell this before he even utters a line.  Liotta has really integrated this character physically.  He is NOT someone whose wrong side you want to be on.  He also isn't trying too hard to keep his anger in check...it's right out there for all to see.  He seems like he might be a villain, or even the now clichd ""corrupt cop,"" but there's a LOT more going on there.  He's not a likeable guy, but he's still trying to do good, despite his own cynicism and disgust.  You always hear stories of how police-persons get so jaded and depressed because of what they see in their work...well, Liotta is the best example I've seen on film of what this means.  Patrick and Liotta are both ordinary guys...not brilliant detectives, not ""the next in a long line of cops in the family,"" none of the usual archetypes we see in gritty police dramas.

The plot of NARC is a bit pedestrian, though.  We follow the case easily enough, but the story seems to run a distant second to the characters.  And the climactic scenes...while full of energy and intent...don't totally make sense from a strictly ""why would he have done that"" standpoint.  It doesn't end with much of an oomph.

But let me be clear...the movie is worth seeing for the two lead performances.  It's a very adult film, with lots of harsh language and graphic violence.  It also has a dim view of the world.  But it also positively bristles.  If you liked stuff like DARK BLUE, you will probably like this.",1122422400,,4432,4.696103896103896

my favorite scene was where this crackhead didn't want to get out of his bathtub, so he put the crack into a loaded shotgun. then he lit it and took a hit and boom! you get the picture. i recommend this to anyone who likes cop dramas.",1120867200,,720,4.2101449275362315
1868557,4,B00008YLUY,"This is a very good film. It's hard edged, tough to watch at times, surprising and intellectually interesting. I've gotten a little tired of so-called hard-edged films and tv dramas that are really a bit lame, not original, like cheap imitations of real life. This film doesn't feel like that. From the very first scene it's got you gripped. This stuff happens and even if it's a nightmare in some ways it's valueable to watch and  consider. It unfolds like a crime thriller should, but the why's and how's are unique enough to mark it as special. And the two lead actors give great performances. Neither of them are prema-donnas. There's no Brad Pitt here. But Patrick and Liotta deliver the real thing - quality, understated and yet large acting. This is a treat really. I was surprised.",1116288000,4,789,4.717391304347826
1868618,4,B00008YLUY,"With the prevalence of police dramas on television these days, you'd think everyone would have had enough of this formula, but there's no denying that there's something engrossing about this dark tale of drugs, violence, murder, and guilt. Certainly this film recycles every cop clich in the book: Jason Patric plays the ousted cop who's only hope to redeem himself is to solve this one big, high-profile case that no one else can handle, Ray Liotta is the out-of-control cop whose partner was killed, Patric's wife freaks when she sees him once again vanishing into his work, the upper echelon cops just want to see somebody take a fall and couldn't care less about justice... seems to me most of these were already old hat when Clint Eastwood was making cop films.

But in what should be considered a victory of style over substance, writer-director Joe Carnahan manages to keep the tension cranked up pretty high, and glue us to our seats throughout. For fans of thrillers, there are some powerful scenes of confused, lightning-paced violence, including the shocking opening sequence. True, the scenes between Patric and his wife were not only hackneyed but pointless, and probably should have been cut. True, the stylishly avant-garde camerawork was more often annoying than enlightening. And true, it doesn't really take much of an actor to continually register ill-concealed fury by yelling expletives (sorry, Ray).

But the biggest fault this reviewer found with the film was a logical flaw in the plot which completely cut the ending adrift. Without giving away too much of the conclusion for others, consider the point in the action where a perp has been caught (and killed) with the dead cop's badge in his apartment. The Chief and the Commissioner are ready to close the case, give Patric his job back, and everybody can go home happy - with about an hour's worth of film left. Why don't our ""heroes"" take them up on that offer? The fact that they don't makes the final scene completely unbelievable, and as such I suggest that viewers just enjoy the frenetic, visceral ride, and not try to solve the mystery.",1116288000,,2120,4.9025069637883005
1868619,2,B00008YLUY,"Based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews for Narc, I was prepared for this film to rise above the conventions that frequently plague the cop genre and tell an exciting, gritty story.  Unfortunately, Narc disappoints- ultimately a victim to a filmmaker high on MTV-style gimmicks and low on craft.

The setup is familiar- not an inherently bad thing.  A Detroit narc, Nick Tellis (Jason Patric) who accidentally shot a pregnant woman must investigate the death of a fellow narc in ""one last job"" to salvage his career and his unresolved obsessions.  His partner, Henry Oak (Ray Liotta) is a hard-boiled, unstable man prone to violence.

Where the film errs is that writer/director, Joe Carnahan fails to give the audience a single character to relate to.  The gritty violence of the first scene (a pregnant woman gushing blood from her womb)is soon underminded by the one-dimensional good-guy heroism of Nick.  Carnahan's long, drawn-out shots of Nick thinking or contemplating (""about what?"" I wondered) coupled with Patric's bland performance create a vacuum where there should be a firecracker, or at least some kind of charismatic force.  In comparison with say, Willem Dafoe's cop in Mississippi Burning or Russell Crowe's Bud from LA Confidential, Nick is a total blank.  Ray Liotta as Henry fares beter because his character is inherently better written.  But in a long monologue about his dead wife, the danger and allure of Henry slips away.  Liotta has one good scene where his pungent delivery of Henry's tirade against police bureacracy sounds profanely poetic.  Otherwise, Liotta is basically left to scream the f-word and compensate for the nonexistent rapport between himself and Patric. Don't even get me started either on Nick's stereotypically beautiful and dull wife, Audrey, who predictably, wants Nick to stop the investigation and spend some quality time with her and their adorable tyke.  Carnahan predictably soaks these trite family scenes in sentimental sunlight.

Carnahan's shameless sentimentality and moral obviousness is one-upped only by his lazy freneticism.  Imagine Darren Aronofsky without the wit or sense of palpable horror.  Split screens, ambient music, quick cuts, incessant flashbacks.  What this essentially reveals is a well-deserved insecurity with his skill.  In the course of the whole film (which feels quite long) there is one simply executed scene that I recall.  And it is terrible.  While Nick interviews the wife of the slain cop, Carnahan's odd dialogue and inappropriate framing reveal nothing and say nothing, leaving the audience with a load of dead space.  From this scene it became clear to me that the rest of the film's hyperactivity was a device to layer its director's weaknesses in stylistic distractions.

Narc is an unpleasant film experience.  It has little to say about cops, narcs, Detroit, relationships, or drugs.  It failure as a genre film disappoints in an era where mainstream movies desperately need any kind of artistic jolt of credibility.",1115769600,2,3020,5.283018867924528
1868620,5,B00008YLUY,"this film was COMPLETELY overlooked by any of the major film institutions in terms of the awards that it rightfully deserved.  every single performance in the film was on par...even the archetypal junkies and police chief that aren't in the film for more than a half an hour a piece.  the direction was excellent..as well as the writing, and its no surprise that one man did both. Some may say that this director tried too hard at showing off his many styles of filming a scene (shaky camera's, blue lenses, etc)...but really, each technique was fitting to each situation.

 I know that the production of the film was almost the reason for its downfall, due to a lack of steady pay for the cast and crew memebers, but thank whoever it is that you thank in these situations that this film didn't crumble in the end.  Luckily alot of different people jumped on board after its unveling at Sundance (Tom Cruise, Ray Liotta actually produced it as well as act the role of a main character)
  Let me just say this....don't even think for one second that this is a nice, campy, predictalbe, standard cop film where they wrap it up in the end......this is so much more than that.  this movie is struggle, it's regret, the persuit of purity, and so, so much more.  if it wasn't for the slapped-on label of a Paramount Picture, this is pure art.

I do wish they had explored the relationship with the abused girl/wife more though. A definite must see.,1100476800,,425,4.605263157894737
1868623,5,B00008YLUY,"I am an avid watcher of movies, and ""Narc"" is one of the best cop films I have ever seen. Unlike most of its big-budget Hollywood counterparts, this film shows what I feel is a gritty and accurate account of what it is like to be a cop. Ray Liotta and Jason Patric play their roles to perfection, and since they are both such great actors they are able to play off each other to make their characters' shaky relationship work well.

Aside from the great, natural dialogue and excellent plotline, one of the things that I thought made this movie better than the standard cop flick is that the two main characters were actually made to LOOK like cops. Ray Liotta gained 25 pounds and wore a fat suit to give his character a more realistic, aged look, and Jason Patric looked sufficiently scuzzy, as he was portraying an undercover narcotics detective who was required to look like a criminal. What most Hollywood filmmakers don't seem to realize is that real cops don't look like Colin Farrell or Josh Hartnett, they look like real people who don't have the benefit of make-up artists and hair stylists, nor do they necessarily look like Playgirl centerfolds.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a change from mindless big-budget explosion-fests like ""SWAT"" or ""Bad Boys.""",1099785600,2,1293,4.716814159292035

However, it sure is a fun ride.

Jason Patric and Ray Liotta give intense performances as police willing to do whatever it takes.  Both are incredibly volatile and troubled individuals, and the portrayals by Liotta and Patric add great depth to characters who could easily be cardboard cutouts.  Although I haven't seen anything else that Joe Carnahan has done, I was very impressed by his work as a director.  Not since Darren Aranofsky's masterpiece have I seen a director so forcefully taken control of how the movie is looking, utilizing many different directoral styles without any of them seeming arbitary.

Although the ending leaves a lot of things ambiguous, some wisely and some foolishly (Patric's family is an integral part of the story, and the resolution of his personal life is never shown or explained) and occasionally the script moves towards showing rather than telling, this is a solid genre film, and much more than I expected.  7/10",1097366400,,1363,4.87012987012987

This film was gritty and didn't spare the audience any reality for the sake of easy viewing. This film is filled with tragedy and suspense. Narc will have you hooked from the opening scene. The last 30 minutes of this film is as intense as any other I have seen.
Ray Liotta puts on what I would say is his best performance to date. If Denzel Washington was worthy of an oscar for Training Day so is Liotta for Narc. This film puts Training Day to shame. Jason Patric also puts on a great performance. I know he had to sort of step aside and let Liotta take the spotlight. I think that's actually what makes Jason Patric so great in this film. His ability to compliment Liotta's character while at the same time making his character almost equally appealing to the viewer is astonishing. There aren't too many actors out there nowadays that can do that or are willing to. Jason Patric's un-selfishness pays off big time.

First at all Jason Patrick has grown up as an actor to keep in mind in futures releases . His performance is deeply complex , because he has three dragons to face ; one as husband for his eccentrities , another dragon is the weight of the blame as an involuntary murderer and the other is to find out who are ehind the murderer of a cop . Liotta makes an admirable work too . His rol is extraordinary well written . The dark atmosphere is a punch ; I mean : watch this artistic work , because the picture is much more than a simple case about dealers , cops and bad or good guys ; precisely this is a strong point to its favour ; nobod is innocent (like the real life). The film trascends itself to become progressively in a disturbing and provocative story . The angles shooting and the screen divided in four (previously used for Norman Jewison in he Thomas Crown Affair and more recently in The italian job) is amazing.

A very complex and perfect script support and makes of that film one of the best issues filmed in 2003 . There are shades of Serpico , Internal affairs and Dark blue but the film owns personality and too much to say.

Well he gets a chance to get a desk job but he has to go back on

1868671,5,B00008YLUY,"With recent documentaries, A Decade Under the Influence and Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, '70s American cinema is enjoying a resurgence and championed by critics as the last great decade of Hollywood filmmaking. Joe Carnahan is the latest filmmaker to draw upon '70s cinema for inspiration with his new film, Narc, an edgy drama about police corruption.
There are several extras included on the DVD that explore various aspects of Narc. First up is an audio commentary by the film's writer and director, Joe Carnahan and the film's editor, John Gilroy. The two men are obviously close friends as evident from the familiarity between them. They joke and talk about all sorts of anecdotal material about the making of the film. Carnahan, in particular, is very entertaining as he gives most of his comments a spin of self-deprecating humour.
""Narc: Making the Deal"" covers the origins of the movie. Carnahan talks about how it started off as a short film inspired by Errol Morris' famous documentary, The Thin Blue Line (1988), about the murder of a police officer.
""Narc: Shooting Up"" examines the limitations of working on an independent film. The production ran into all sorts of problems, including running out of money. Liotta and his wife spent time drumming up completion funds while the dedicated cast and crew continued to work without being paid.
The look of the film is explored in ""Narc: The Visual Trip."" Carnahan talks about how certain films were framed and composed.
Finally, ""The Friedkin Connection"" is a ten-minute love fest by the famous filmmaker who is clearly impressed by Carnahan's movie.
Narc is a gritty, character driven crime drama in the best tradition of '70s American cinema but given a contemporary stylistic update that is reminiscent, at times, of the films of Michael Mann (Thief) and Steven Soderbergh (Traffic). Paramount has done a fine job packaging a pristine print of the movie with a nice collection of extras that are a notch above the usual fluff, promotional pieces that are created for recent films.",1081296000,9,2041,5.023598820058997

Good. becuase anyone who has seen that film will find if hard to believe that the wooden, stiff and stilted actor (not Sandra Bullock) in the lead role is the same as the one in this small time independent masterpiece. but, and i assure you, it is.
Jason Patric is brilliant as the guilt ridden cop on a last case, bringing depth to the character and making the viewer feel for him when he encounters both the good and the bad through the course of this movie.
So too is Ray Liotta, whose Henry Oak character is one of the most impressive ""cop on the edge"" characters since they first started doing movies about cops on the edge.
The supporting cast is good too, especially the police chief character, the infected informant, and Busta Rhymes's near-cameo as one of the suspects.
The director also helps things along, shooting it with a gritty, almost noirish colour, and making good use of editing and flashbacks, and he keeps the action from getting over the top, letting the characters fire off far more than the weaponry, with a great soundtrack to boot.
This film was produced by Tom Cruise, and it actually reflects this: it's not very big, but is eminently watchable. independent film at it's best.",1080259200,7,1244,4.633484162895928

There's an OK twist to the story's ending, but getting there was where this movie stumbles.  Two of the major subplots (the ""bad"" cop's internal affairs investigation and the conflict between the main character and his wife) basically go nowhere.  En route to the climax, you're treated to some of the most over-the-top abuse of police authority you can imagine.  Felony assault, felony property damage, illegal search and seizure, and false imprisonment for starters.  I can't imagine how two cops could ever expect to deliver a prosecutable case when they obtain their evidence this way, let alone keep themselves out of prison.

The film is gritty and Detroit is a perfect backdrop for the gritty feel of the movie. Both of the main characters (played by Jason Patric and Ray Liotta) are driven by a sort of obsession. Liotta's obsession and zeal is not well understood until near the end of the film when it becomes clear that much of his ""unorthodox"" detective work is beyond just unorthodox. Patric is excellent as a cop brought back to active duty after an accidental shooting of a bystander on his previous assignment (for which he was placed on long-term suspension). Patric's character seems detached somehow, slipping further into his police role and further away from his disapproving wife (and their child together). (Patric's former assignment had been to go undercover and infiltrate the city's drug underworld, and apparently he had his own drug problems as a result.

1868677,4,B00008YLUY,"In Brief
When a drug bust goes awry and a pregnant woman is shot, undercover narcotics officer Nick Tellis (Jason Patric) is suspended from the Detroit Police Force.  Tortured by the horror of his work and the extent to which he had to lead the life of an addict when undercover, Tellis is not anxious to go back onto the force.  Eighteen months after his suspension, and facing a review board and he is told he is needed to help crack a homicide case.  Ignoring his wife's concerns about his mental stability & with no satisfaction away from the life he was born to lead he returns, yet the world he once knew has grown darker, no one can be trusted and nothing is as it once seemed.
Review
As Tellis stands upon the stairwell of the police department stairs after his review with the board he has a choice; either way, the spiral up or down doesn't give him a straight or clear path, yet here this decision decides the narrative of the entire film.  The subtlety that Carnahan instils in the portrayal of the confliction that Tellis suffers is always genuine and his use of environment is simple yet shows a confident filmmaker, that while capable of intense work knows when the narrative justifies it.  Nominated for the Dramatic Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah and winner of the Special Prize Policier Award at the Cognac Film Festival in France, Narc is not only directed but also written by the innovative Joe Carnahan.  I say innovative as this one of the best films I have seen in sometime, and while it may not be as fresh as City of God, it is equally shocking.
This is modern film noir: a gritty violent depraved world is depicted upon the screen and the film acts as an assault upon the senses.  Yet this journey is in no way gratuitous, with homage's to The French Connection & Serpico, Carnahan is respectful of where this film is leading on from and how it will eventually fit into same world as it undoubtedly draws comparisons to.  Narc works so well as it rests upon the shoulders of both Patric and Ray Liotta without cause for either actor to falter.  Patric is as strong as he is gentle, silence surrounds his world, and one becomes aware at just how often the world he views is seen as tight and suffocating - not only in his performance but again through the continual use of a shallow depth of field and closed shots around him.  Indeed the image of him with his baby in the shower immersed in a warm glow, following his reliving of the accidental shooting of a pregnant women, is one of the most beautiful in the film.
While both men are persecuted in their lives and carry tortured souls, it is Ray Liotta who carries this film so well as Henry Oak.  In what has to be his best work since Goodfellas, this is an Oscar winning performance if ever I have seen one.  A swollen Homicide Detective with a 93% conviction rate, Oak is a harsh bastard who has his own law and relishes every opportunity to depart justice to those he feels deserves it.  His involvement in the storyline is key and like his character is not as plane as the brashness that seems to depict him.  With an ending you won't see coming, this is a shockingly strong film that has to be seen to be believed.
The Verdict

An amazing feature that will leave you sitting with your mouth open, jaw slack, and as exhausted as the characters lives.  This is a theatrical experience that isn't about flashy CGI or camera tricks but the harshness of the world we live in.  There is one more disturbing film out there at the moment, but like City of God, nothing compares to Narc",1073433600,,3585,4.432267884322679
1868738,4,B00008YLUY,"Narc shouldn't be as good a film as it is. Not to say Joe Carnahan's diary-of-a-dirty-cop crime thriller is a spectacular movie (it isn't) but Narc pulls off a cinematic feat rare in today's motion pictures: genuine mood. The truth is that the good-cop-bad-cop scenario here has already been played out so many times that there aren't that many avenues left to explore, and LA Confidential already gave us a searing look at the dirty dealings behind old-time Hollywood. But that film's popular success was all in its style, its cinematic pizzazz, and not its storyline. Narc, to this writer, is as good as, if not better than, LA Confidential simply because it sticks to its narrative guns in the same fashion Curtis Hanson did in his opus. Both films are conscious of the limitations of the genre yet do what they can to succeed within such strict guidelines. I would not deem either film a colossal success writing- wise, because with genre pieces like these, it was all about the kinetic thrill of watching cops strategize against one another. Yeah, sure, it would be nice to get more hard-edged, more nihilistic dialogue to spice up the conflict (to its credit, L.A. Confidential trumps it in that regard), but Narc still delivers great chase, eloquence be damned. After some unbearably long production credits - there are more than ten executive producers listed - Carnahan starts us off with a bullet. As Jason Patric chases a suspect through, tragically, a playground, Carnahan shoves his herky-jerky filmmaking style in our faces. If you're not a fan of assaultive cinema - extensive P.O.V. shots, endless handheld ""grittiness"" - this sensibility will come off as overindulgent and excessive, but if you can stomach it, it's captivating.
Stars Jason Patric and Ray Liotta have some turgid, explosive confrontations that allow for both of these notoriously histrionic actors to fly off the handle, and they pull of the melodramatics with masterful broad strokes. And the film's visual style is really quite striking. Relying not just on the immediacy of ""unhinged"" handheld camera moves, Carnahan pays attention to nuances and environmental details with effective jump-cut close- ups, and is able to infuse a pretty tired old storyline with messy, frantic adrenaline. It's no wonder this is the guy poised to helm the next Mission: Impossible movie - he hasn't mastered the ebb and flow of egregious narrative like Brian DePalma or harnessed the technical prowess of David Fincher, but one can construe from watching Narc that the guy has a nice sense of artistic instinct, and has the courage to follow it. Narc is a film that follows its gut, and that makes for a fascinating ride.",1073001600,,2690,4.98

Jason Patric cast as the younger of the two cops, with a history of accidentally shooting a pregnant woman.  Liotta is cast as the older cop and he really looks the part;  he's overweight and world-weary and seems to have seen it all and done it all.  They're out to solve a murder of a fellow police officer, the former partner of Liotta.  The setting is the Detroit slums.
Patric has a newborn son and a wife who wants him to give up the job.  The murdered cop had a wife and kids too.  There's a little too many maudlin scenes about this and this is the part of the film that drags.  The action scenes never drag though.  They're rough and tough and over-the-top in their grittiness and realism.
But what makes this film different from other cop films is that, in spite of the action, it's all about the characters.  Ray Liotta has a secret, and it's not until the end that we find out what it is.  It's a satisfactory conclusion with all the ends tied up.

The performances were spare and clean.  The conversations have a reality and depth that is impressive.  The mystery element is unsolved and surprising right to the end.
Joe Carnahan is a director with a careful eye for detail and very good dialogue and storytelling technique.  I'm sure he'll soon be heading up larger projects.
Ray Liotta is perhaps the only wrong note - if only because he's played some big teddy-bear types lately and the hard-edge character doesn't feel as real to me anymore.  Perhaps someone else might have played it with more depth.

 Liotta's character has passed the thin line that divides a man in control of his emotions and respectful of law and authority, and one who cannot or doesn't want to do things in the right way: he simply has lost interest, and has too much rage to give a damn about things, so, to him the end justifies the means. But the problem is that there is no way in which this character can get rid of his demons, there isn't a way in which he can redeem himself, not with the way he decided things should be done.
 Patric's character, on the other side, also has a conflicted concious, but still believes in doing good. And to him, the end does not justify the means. He is a man who still has something to look up for, something to cherish, and does whatever he can to preserve things that way, no matter how hard things get.

1868747,5,B00008YLUY,"Filmed in Detroit and Toronto, this brilliant piece of work has some of the best acting ever captured on film. With verisimilitude and intricacy of plot, Narc fires on all cylinders: moral, emotional, and philosophical (epistemological and aesthetic). Yet I had never heard of it. Why? I would guess it has to do in part with its not being a Hollywood product. Narc did not receive oodles of money and its director and producers (although Tom Cruise co-produced after seeing how good the finished product was) did not make nice to all the people who must be made nice to to produce and distribute a film. Superficially, Narc is a genre film, a police thriller. And it also does not (again, superficially) obey the stereotypes of (what for want of a lack of a better term has come to be called) political correctness. For example, the Ray Liotta character (absolutely brilliantly rendered), a veteran undercover police offer, at one point decries to his superiors (one of whom is black) that they are all too happy to pin the murder of a police officer on a wimpy pusher (who also happens to have the deceased's badge) because it is politically palatable. So, too, in another scene (the film's funniest) a Latino without pants (his wife gave him VD), who has just used his last match to set his wife's hair on fire, requests a light to do a hit of crack. Busta Rhymes plays a bad guy-again, superficially. The whole problem with this movie, from the Hollywood standpoint, is that it fails to be sufficiently superficial. Considering all the money available to make movies, making a good movie in Hollywood is not that difficult. But making a work of art appears to be impossible. Narc is a work of art. Lucky to get a couple of stars, and threatened with financial extinction early in its production, Narc delves into depths of moral complexity unavailable to films that poll audiences to find out what they would most like. (""Entertain us,"" in the words of Kurt Cobain.) The business model for normal film making appears to be based on corporate (un)accountability: try to make something that sells but, if it doesn't, make sure no single person can be held personally responsible for its failure. This recipe leads to some above-average films, mild entertainment, and far too many cinematic atrocities (especially when you consider the money spent making them).  But too many cooks generally spoil the pot. Narc doesn't have too many cooks. It simply cooks. I loved this film not only because it is a kind of French Connection for the 00's, but also because it shows that, after all is said and done, a little true art is worth more than a truckload of money and spectacle.",1063065600,3,2674,4.7505376344086025

After that, the movie, while briskly paced, finds itself following the same good cop/bad cop routine that has peppered every police drama since Serpico. While the performances are very good, Narc never seems to come into its own. Ray Liotta, as always, is angry. Jason Patric (one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood) gives a textured and emotional edge to his character. The direction and cinematography are outstanding. The script is sharply written with natural dialogue and some truly brutal wordplay.

In any event, both Ray Liotta and Jason Patric pull off suitably good performances.  Patric has played this role before, in 1990's ""Heat"", so it's no surprise he plays so well.  But Liotta, so often mired in extremely poor B-movies of late, is the real prize.
The hand-held filming is often jarring, but no more so than your average episode of NYPD Blue.  ""Narc"" offers more dialogue than action, but it's still a solid piece of work.  Well worth owning, and definitely worth renting.",1059955200,2,706,4.624
1868822,4,B00008YLUY,"Jason Patric (in his first film role in almost 4 years) plays a Detroit narcotics cop kicked off the force following a bust gone bad.  Ray Liotta, in one of his best roles, is an unstable cop who's been investigating the murder.  Patric and Liotta are forced to work together and form an uneasy alliance.  NARC explores this case, as well as the relationships between Liotta and Patric as well as Patric's relationship to his wife (Krista Bridges) and infant son.
NARC is not anything new, and you'll likely figure out the plot twists pretty easily.  However, it's well-done, and the acting is top notch.  The director (Joe Carnahan) has done a good job capturing a raw quality of police work, making NARC much more believable than many recent police thrillers.  As a result, the relatively low budget of the film (7.5 million) doesn't show.

Jason Patrick is also a very talented actor that adds significantly to the story.
The direction is non traditional, and the set design and coloring is dark and slightly haunting.  The action and dialogue are non stop from the very opening frame which will immediately grab you and not let go until the film is over.
It's not for everyone due to the violent nature of the subject matter, there are a few scenes that are definitely hard to watch for that reason.

1868824,4,B00008YLUY,"Narc is a very decent first outing for its director, although some of the camerawork could possibly induce as much nausea as the Blair Witch Project did for some people.  The filmmakers tailored the film to match the color scheme and feel of The French Connection and Serpico.  For its writing and directing, it's about a three star film, not bad by any means, but not as superb as the films it emulates.  However, there are two reasons to make this film a must see (and these set Narc higher than the traditional three-star rating): Ray Liotta and Jason Patric.
Jason Patric plays an undercover vice cop who's been put out to pasture for an accidental wounding he caused.  He has pretty much become a stay-at-home dad by the time he is asked to come back on assignment to help solve a murder of a fellow undercover vice cop.  The tensions between his wife and his job build significantly throughout the film, particularly after Patric meets and teams up with Ray Liotta's Henry Oak character.
Like the last name suggests, Oak is a big solid heavy hitting cop, and in the great tradition of crooked cop movies, there's something just not right about him.  Nevertheless as we join the two cops on the quest to solve the murder, Liotta's character fiendishly oozes charisma (If only people had the same drive Oak's character has to channel through more creative and less brutal outlets!).  As the director Joe Carnahan commented in the 'making of' featurettes, there is a Dante-esque feel that the two cops are descending further and further into Hell, and their facades become more and more stripped away, revealing Oak to be some sort of a madman.
As is to be expected, there is a radical twist in the last few minutes of the film, that you may or may not see coming.  Nevertheless, it illustrates much like Kurosawa's Rashomon, that what you think you saw isn't always what happened--and yet each viewpoint contains a grain of truth.
To sum up: There's a good story line that almost, but not quite, outstays its welcome, solid gritty directing, and two incredibly good performances from Ray Liotta and Jason Patric.  If you see this movie for any reason, make it for the performances of the two disparate leading actors.",1058313600,,2221,4.718346253229974

The plot centers around the murder of a Detroit undercover narcotics officer during a drug buy gone bad. Ray Liotta plays Lt. Oak, a surly, grizzled veteran who was the deceased's partner. Oak is almost an identical version of Russell Crowe in LA Confidential. He loves to scrap with perps and is most concerned with ""justice"" being served. Jason Patric plays Nick Tellis who was a narc until he accidentally shot a preganant woman during a drug bust. This is Tellis' last shot at returning to the force with honor. So, Liotta and Patrick hook-up to solve the murder of Lt. Oak's partner. The results are less than thrilling, in fact this film moves so slow that it felt like I was growing moss underneath me. Patrick gives a decent performance but he's done this bit before and done it better (See Rush). Liotta is adequate as Oak but he just doesn't come off as believable in this role.

1868868,2,B00008YLUY,"To me, the best movies are those that I can get so involved in that I forget I'm in the theater (or watching my television). With a film like Narc, it's impossible to forget you're watching a very self conscious work of art. Director Joe Carnahan (who also directed Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane, a rather generic post-Tarantino action flick), along with everyone else in Narc, simply tries too hard to be original, clever and intense. Jason Patric and Ray Liotta play cops Nick Tellis and Henry Oak out to catch the killer of another cop. The film starts out with a long, stylized chase scene that ends with Tellis killing a civilian instead of the criminal he's pursuing. He is compelled to take on the proverbial ""one last case"" to avoid prosecution. Oak, meanwhile, is a loose cannon who only wants to avenge the murder of his ex-partner. Apart from the overstylized camera work (at one point, as the cops are questioning suspects, the screen is divided into quarters), which makes it very hard to get involved in the movie, the performances are all overwrought. Everyone is always screaming at someone (that is, when they aren't shooting at or beating someone half to death). Ray Liotta's character is too extreme in his anger and brutality to be believable. Narc, I suppose, is meant to portray the violent, often surreal world of the streets, but it ends up leaving viewers confused and detached from the action. Although the story isn't really that complicated --everything hinges on whether certain cops are corrupt or not-- I found Narc difficult to follow in many places.

1868872,2,B00008YLUY,"Narc (Joe Carnahan, 2002)
Joe Carnahan does not make easy to understand movies, as anyone who saw his debut film (Blood, Guts, Bullets, and Octane) can attest. His second effort is Narc, released to critical acclaim and moviegoer confusion. It's pretty easy to see why.
The first twenty minutes of Narc are about as confusing as anything released in the past half-century. Eventually, with much thought, you will crib together the following: Nick Tellis (Jason Patric, from The Lost Boys) was an undercover narcotics officer until a nasty incident involving a pregnant woman and a stray bullet. He has been suspended for a period of time (seven months is mentioned, but that makes other things not add up too well). He is asked to go back out into the field by his captain, Cheevers (Chi McBride of The Frighteners and Boston Public). He is either going back into the field to investigate the death of another undercover officer, Michael Calvess (Alan van Sprang of Earth: Final Conflict) or to investigate Calvess' erstwhile partner, Oak (Ray Liotta). Eventually, you get to the idea that Tellis is going to act as a double-agent, both working on the Calvess case and Oak at the same time.
The movie improves somewhat after the far too rushed setup, focusing on Tellis and his relationship with his wife (Krista Bridges) and infant son. Things disintegrate pretty quickly, though; once we stop focusing on the characters and get back to the plot, we feel like we're in an episode of CHiPs; amazingly, the correct clues just fall into the detectives' laps after they've spent the whole middle third of the film fruitlessly ssearching). Oak and Tellis clash for no real reason on a few occasions, the two both get bogged down in stereotype, and ultimately the story ends up being predictable, even if you couldn't follow the first twenty minutes.
What saves the film from complete disaster is some good performances. Patric and Liotta may be stereotypes, but they're well-played stereotypes. Busta Rhymes, as always, is fantastic as a trash-talking drug dealer, and McBride is also doing what he does best, as usual. But ultimately Narc comes off as Blood, Guts, Bullets, and Octane without the humor. **",1057104000,,2203,4.940700808625337

So its surprising to him when over a year later, he's asked to look into the murder of another narcotics officer that has went cold.  He ends up being partnered with that officers' partner, Henry Oak (played to perfection by Ray Liotta) and sent on a trail of addicts and dealers to solve the crime.  But in the end, how far are they willing to go for the truth, and what will it truly cost both of them?  Both Patric and Liotta are incredible in the portryal of men who have suffered great pain, and are tortured by it constantly.

1868875,5,B00008YLUY,"""Narc"" is one of those films almost everyone missed in theaters - and yet - through the magic of video, is destined to join the short list of the greatest crime thrillers ever made.
Because its plot has been previously discussed so wonderfully by other Amazon reviewers, I won't add anything more beyond saying writer-director Joe Carnahan has crafted one of the most taut and wrenching screenplays in recent memory, complete with a shocking ending that has you sighing in amazement.
You think you've seen everything in cop thrillers, and in many respects, you have indeed with ""Narc."" Yes, this is a story about two tarnished cops.
But what's compelling and different are the spectacular, wondrous performances by Ray Liotta, Jason Patric and the entire supporting cast.
Everyone associated with this production (who reportedly worked for near nothing), should feel proud of their efforts. You never get the feeling ""Narc"" is a low-budget picture. It feels like a big studio film, with one huge difference. Instead of a conventional and commercial narrative with everything tied at the end, you get something more believable.
Without giving away the ending, which initially feels baffling - when you think about it some more, you come away knowing that a legacy associated with a ""horrifying yet humane"" secret buried by one cop for puzzling reasons - is inherited with greater clarity - by the other cop for eternity.
Hands down, this is a film driven by fabulous performances, a complex script and a free-wheeling, dangerous atmosphere offering the grittiness of the best crime films made during the 1970s. If you like films like ""The French Connection,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" and ""Serpico"" - or more recently - films like ""Goodfellas,"" ""Casino"" and ""Training Day,"" you will love ""Narc.""
Yes, Jason Patric is fantastic. But Ray Liotta deserves special mention. In my mind, Liotta lays down the best performance of his career, better than his more memorable turn in Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas."" He's absolutely electric and so suited for this role that it's impossible to think of anyone topping it. It's a letter-perfect, towering role that feels improvised from beginning to end. When he's on screen, you can't take your eyes off him. When he speaks, you're mesmerized. The experience is like watching Gene Hackman come alive for the first time on his own in 1971's ""The French Connection.""
The ""R"" rating is for violence and profanity. There's no sex, no gratuitous, over-the-top filler and nothing that makes you groan with that ""I've seen it all before"" disgust. Even if you disagree with the plot, what remains is acting fireworks impossible to dismiss. No one is trying to hard to win awards in ""Narc,"" yet in retrospect, it deserved so much more from Academy members who missed it. It even plays better, emotionally, than ""Traffic,"" another fine film that won awards but had its energy dissipated across a huge ensemble cast.
That's OK. A lot of films become ""classic"" without winning a thing. ""Narc"" will be one of 'em. Wait ten years and you'll see.",1056585600,46,3063,5.019646365422397

I can say one thing I sure am glad that Tom Cruise saw this at Sundance or whatever Film Festival he saw it and decided to back it because it may have been one of those that went str8 to video after 1 month on the big screen which is a shame because I believe many will miss the opportunity to catch this gripping drama. The previous reviews does so much justice to the plot that I won't even go into a lengthy description.
Ray Liotta is compelling in his INTENSE good-yet-Hard A$$-cop potrayal(nuff said... want to know more rent the movie), Jason Patric has always been one of the most underrated actors of ""my"" time he does a Superb job as a Cop dealing with his own demons and the slow realization that there is more to this investigation than is on paper, Chi McBride has a minimal role but always love to see his acting last but not least Busta Rhymes.... I am so impressed by his increased acting roles and the growth he has shown (you go boiiiiiiii - circa Flava Flav) LOL
The story/plot is engrossing yes, the plot sounds familiar but TRUST me this is not the same ole scenario, same ole outcome. It has some scenes of violence that may disturb some. The Movie shows some day-to-day injustice that exists out there but is allowed as well as the ever problematic dual NARC life (just take enough to get them to trust you get you in...... YEA... RIGHT!!) Location was in Detroit very dark, gritty some of the scenes are shot with the ""running camera"" effect which I sometimes get motion sickness LOL but it goes with the flow of the movie, also some of the scenes were played like a comic book set-up (without the cartoon images) but in the ""4-scenes-on-the-screen"" look.

1868877,4,B00008YLUY,"""Narc"" covers old territory - the cop movie - in fairly innovative and refreshing ways. Blessed also with compelling performances by Jason Patric and Ray Liotta as two good cops gone bad [each in different ways], it is far better and more watchable than most such movies. Its main drawback is that it is relentlessly grim and humorless.
The marvelous Patric plays Detective Sgt. Nick Tellis, whose career was wrecked a year earlier by a drug bust gone terribly wrong. He gets a second chance by being offered a partnership with Detective Lt. Henry Oak [Liotta], whose former partner has been killed. The pair's mission is to find out who killed the cop and why. Their investigation leads them down a twisted path of lies and deceptions. While many viewers may think they've guessed the truth midway through the film, there is a clever final twist that is both surprising and logical.
""Narc"" shows us an older and much heavier Liotta, who seems to be turning into a much more interesting character actor than he ever was in his younger days as a `star'. Patric continues to impress as one of the great actors of his generation, one who in recent years seems much more attracted to the roles then to fame. To the stars', as well as the script's, credit, the movie goes to great lengths to show the two men as disillusioned human beings who would like to care about love and life if only they remembered how. It is as much a character study as it is an action piece.",1056412800,,1463,4.566539923954372
1868938,5,B00008YLUY,"Narc opens with one of the gutsiest and visceral sequences in recent memory.  A wildly flailing camera tracking a breathless Jason Patric, who in turn is chasing after a brutal drug dealer who's pumping passersby with lethal dope as he's running.  This is easily one of the most arresting beginnings for a film I've ever seen.  And it doesn't stop there.

Director William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist) raved enthusiastically about Narc on the DVD interview and it's easy to see why.  Writer/director Joe Carnahan employs many of the same post-modern film techniques as nine out of 10 young directors out there -- jump cuts, handheld camera, aggressive axial breaks.  But Carnahan has the good story sense to contrast these with long extended scenes of beauty and emotional exploration, contrasting the stylish parts with real restraint and expression.  Save for one scene (Ray Liotta's final scene) where the jump cuts intrude upon emotional catharsis, Carnahan's use of post-modern techniques is about as good as I've ever seen.

Jason Patric makes a welcome return to form in Narc, playing strung-out detective Tellis.  Somehow he's always been good at drug roles (remember Rush?), and his haunting performance in Narc vindicates him for some of the acting atrocities he's committed.  (Speed 2, anyone?)  Ray Liotta's character, Henry Oak, is actually much richer than the hot-tempered firecracker depicted in the marketing campaigns, and Liotta's turn is equally charismatic and emotional.  He remains a shamefully underutilized talent who deserves to be on top.  Honorary mention to Anne Openshaw, who is mesmerizing in her one scene as Kathryn, the widow of murdered cop Mike Calvess.  Carnahan's gritty dialoguing allows the actors to shine nicely, and Alex Nepomniaschy's cinematography is superb, especially given the film's mind-blowing, zero-budget 28-day shooting schedule.  That's nearly four and a half pages of script a day!

Echoes of Steven Soderbergh's Traffic are inevitable given the subject matter, the expressionistic photography, hard-edged tone, and the harrowing Cliff Martinez score.  To me, Narc is the kind of film that gives a good name to modern filmmaking, deftly balancing thematic substance, emotional maturity, great acting, and sure-handed storytelling.

1868939,5,B00008YLUY,"NARC is an art film.  True the story of undercover cops who at times yeild to the incredible pressure of their seedy lives has been told many times, but few films have presented a more savagely realistic insight into this genre than this very fine film.  The feeling throughout the movie is one of the viewer being along (in the back seat perhaps), seeing first hand the horrors of the drug world and its effects on everyone it touches.  But for once we don't have untainted 'heroes'.  We are shown the inner thoughts and very human responses of each of the characters on both sides of the law. Ray Liotta and Jason Patric give superlative, understated, sensitive performances, managing to keep us in suspense until the final black out that ends the movie. The photogrpahy tends to the artsy side, at times showing extended and important dialogue delivered by reflections in car windows - visually appealing but confusing to the senses.  I finally had to turn on the English subtitles just to hear the dialogue and to understand the multilayered conversations of narc speak, hip hop, and spanglish.  But even with these ""reservations' this is a powerful and well directed movie. Gather your courage for explicit gore and give it a try.  You'll be rewarded.",1056153600,2,1256,4.813953488372093

1868942,5,B00008YLUY,"NARC is not an action movie as its promotional items might be leading on. It's a powerful, gritty , supremely acted piece of cop fiction that pulled me into its violent, undercover, mystery world, punched me along with several of the ""perps"" from the film itself and dropped me off with a thought-provoking finish and plenty of questions to ponder afterwards. It's basically a character-driven movie, not action oriented
It's also a little ""slow"" for those unaccustomed to developed characters and family backgrounds, but I loved it all. I guess that could also be due to my love of ""gritty"" films in general though. In fact, one of the reasons that I love watching movies so much is that they represent worlds in which I will likely never find myself

Henry Oak (Ray Liotta) is a lieutenant who takes Tellis under his wings to find the killers who murdered his partner. There are plenty of imaginative scenes especially the one where the find the man in a tub and a shotgun that was used to give stimulation to the mind. This is a powerful movie that shows the corruption within the police force and the brutality that surfaces during interrogation. Oscar was blind this year. This movie is excellent. Even Busta Rhymes gives an astonishing performance (highlight of his career besides ""Halloween Resurrection""). Watch out for those junkies and stay clean!",1054166400,2,777,4.984615384615385
1868945,5,B00008YLUY,This is one of the most powerful movies I've seen.  Ray Liotta puts in the absolute best performance of his career hands down.  I would recomend this movie to anybody who likes intense and moving films.

1868946,4,B00008YLUY,"Ray Liotta was amazing in this movie.  I have always been a fan of his but he blew me away as a dirty cop in this film.  The director shot this film really well.  The only problem I had was the sequencing, I did not entirely understand what was going on until the end.. maybe that was the point?  This movie would defintely not be considered the desert of the proverbial meal.

1868947,5,B00008YLUY,"This is by far one of the best cop movies I've ever seen. From the opening burst of high octane; a foot chase through the slums of Detroit, (actually filmed in Canada) the film maintains the crescendo until the explosive and volatile end. The film stars Ray Liotta (Henry Oak) as the partner of a murdered Narc (an undercover narcotics officer) Liotta carries such force and weight throughout the film that you can't help but love his dirty and gritty tactics. Jason Patric plays Nick Tellis, a Narc himself until a botched drug bust (which is the opening scene) leaves him suspended. Patric plays Tellis with such depth that the viewer soon feels empathetic towards Tellis' agonizing turmoil and revisiting of his past.
With Oak's partner's case still unsolved, the powers that be decide to combine Tellis' street connections and Oak's ""investigative"" techniques to close the case once in for all. This is where the movie gets interesting...I won't tell you any more. There's a solid performance given by Busta Rhymes. The cinematography is some of the most ""real"" I've ever seen, Combining handhelds and a multi-screen shot, a la Time Code. The script is strong and both Liotta and Patric give SOLID SOLID performances. It's one of those movies that doesn't leave you feeling cheated, it works perfectly in and of itself, it doesn't try to be anything else than what it is. This is a must-see film for those who can appreciate a low budget film's exponential potential.",1049328000,2,1471,4.888
1868968,5,B00008YLUY,"""Narc,"" which made no money and received little major notice when it was released theatrically, was a great movie, a cop thriller full of shady characters and a twisted plot.
Ray Liotta and Jason Patric, both great character actors who deserve an even higher level of fame, create well-drawn yet haunted characters in the film.
Director Joe Carnahan is great with the mood of the piece, using bleak-looking lighting, hand-held camera work and use of harsh locations for shoots. The film is tense, dark and suspenseful. And the surprise ending, regarding the plot of who killed a cop and why, is a treat.
The film embraces and then rejects all the cop movie cliches you would expect, but the film is a rousing success for the genre.",1046995200,,731,4.7637795275590555
1868969,4,B00008YLUY,"Perhaps Narc's biggest flaw is that despite a powerful and shocking opening scene, it quickly goes downhill in the middle, becoming boring and typical, before picking itself up again for a gut-wrenching and suspenseful finale. It's not a great movie, but it sure as hell is a good one. Ray Liotta and Jason Patric are superb, and Busta Rhymes proves himself to be a worthy actor (as he did in Halloween: Resurrection, as ashamed as I am to admit that). The plot, about undercover cop Nick Tellis (Patric), who he is summoned onto the case of a murdered unercover naroctics officer because of his invaluable understanding of the streets, is captivating. Teamed with Lt. Harry Oak (Liotta), the slain cop's partner known for his unconventional administration of justice, Tellis slips into old patterns as the underworld he knows too well ultimately sucks him in. It's a film that uses surprising twists and turns to tell its story, and even if you think you know where it will lead, you ultimately find out how wrong you are. And that alone is what makes Narc so powerful and engrossing, not to mention shocking. There are the typical formula signs -- the unhappy wife, the black superior with his hands tied -- but director Carnahan tends to keep it fresh either through creative direction and spare dialogue, or by expanding a character in a way we didn't see coming. As Nick and Henry take part in a meticulous game of search-and-destroy with possible suspects, Carnahan amps up the tension, getting us to a relentless conclusion full of bone-cracking violence and heartbreaking truth. While getting there, the director falters once in awhile -- most notably with a split-screen sequence (think Time Code) -- but even in the slip-ups, the effort is still apparent. Carnahan's energy combined with the standout performances of his stars make Narc a cut above your run-of-the-mill cop drama clones.",1046390400,7,1897,4.9498432601880875
1868970,5,B00008YLUY,"NARC will leave you emotionally drained, exhilarating, and in a curious way... uplifted. It has a strong moral message about police corruption and Ray Liotta gives a great performance as a shotgun-weilding cop who likes to do things ""his way"", and Jason Patric is excellent too.
That image of the two hypedermic needles held over the flame will stay in my mind for years to come.",1045094400,,379,4.757575757575758
1868971,3,B00008YLUY,"I had high hopes for ""Narc"" after hearing rave reviews from friends, but (and perhaps this is because I am not a fan of the cop-drama genre) I didn't really find this film interesting or original. Although the film was well-shot and well-acted, and was more visually captivating than your run-of-the-mill cop flick, the directing was a bit heavy-handed and the plot was formulaic and beyond predictable. Viewers are beaten over the head with cues to the characters' emotional states about as brutally as the villains roughed up by Liotta's character. ""Narc"" really crosses over into melodramatic bathos at times, which ruins what could have been a great film. I also wasn't quite as impressed as most people seem to be with the opening chase footage. The jerky camerawork that lets the viewer see through they eyes of Patric's character as he chases the baddie is NOT all that original. I would have enjoyed it a lot more had it not been done to death in ""Blair Witch Project,"" which I hold to be the worst movie ever made, including home videos by people who put their thumbs over the lens. Granted, that shooting style was much more appropriate in the ""Narc"" chase scene -- it's just unfortunate that, several years earlier, it was featured very prominently in a famously ... film. I would, however, like to give the filmmakers props for using subdued lighting and muted colors to augment ""Narc""s air of despair, personal tragedy and futility. The atmosphere-setting use of color and light helped determine the emotional tone of the movie and heighten the taut drama between Patric and Liotta, but was subtle enough that it didn't interfere with the realistic feel of the film.",1044921600,3,1679,4.853658536585366
1868972,4,B00008YLUY,"I was hooked right from the opening sequence: Undercover Narcotics Officer Nick Tellis (Jason Patric) pursues a suspect armed with two syringes of tainted Heroin....He stabs an innocent bystander with one, killing him, then takes a young child hostage. This must be every Cop's worst nightmare...
  Things don't end well, and Tellis is put through the wringer. He's given one of those ""Only in the movies"" chances to redeem himself, though: Partner up with the thuggish Henry Oak, a Detective Lieutenant trying to solve the murder of his friend, Michael Calvess, an undercover Cop found killed execution-style. The good-cop/bad cop dichotomy is in full effect, as we see the contrast between Tellis (Who needs to stay by-the-book to redeem himself and get his coveted desk job) and Oak (Who will do anything to see justice done).
  The movie delivers some neat twists, and the final showdown is a real heart-pounder. I did find some of the revelations (I won't spoil them!) a little far-fetched, but hey, it's not a documentary. Jason Patric delivers a fine performance, but Ray Liotta steals the show as Oak. He deserves an Oscar nomination for his rich, layered performance. Oak is a scary guy, but he's not a psychopath; He has reasons for what he does, and I found myself feeling conflicted in my opinions about him when the film ended. This is, without a doubt, Liotta's best performance ever.",1043539200,8,1398,4.9361702127659575
1868973,5,B00008YLUY,"To call this movie realistic is an understatement, because while your watching it, this movie is real. The directing style is one never before seen in modern day, hollywood cinema, at least not in a way that is presented here. Joe Carnahan makes every noise, every detail matter, so that, for example when they are driving a car and tellis is talking on his cell phone, you can hear the outside noises, the car wheels against the pavement, the hum of the engine, at the exact same level and intensity as you would in real life. Thats this movies real strength; the spellbinding ability to craft scenes that are dramatic in a passerby sense; no music, no structured dialouge, lots of other noise. The performances are also excellent, and the several plot twists that this movie offers at the end will keep you on the edge of your seat. It doesnt even matter that the actual plot is generally run-of-the mill. In Narc, its not what is said, but how its said.",1043366400,2,956,4.563953488372093

1868976,3,B00008YLUY,"""Narc"" starts off well above average for a film of its type, but its virtues are soon lost in a welter of cop-movie stereotypes and clichs.  The film is at its best when it concentrates on its main character, Nick Tellis, a man who has experienced the personal degradation that comes from being an undercover narcotics officer, one who has successfully infiltrated the lowlife drug world of inner city Detroit.  As the film opens, Tellis has been put on leave for his involvement in the accidental shooting of a pregnant woman during a drug bust.  Valuing the knowledge and skills he has accumulated in his time spent undercover, the force asks him to come back and help investigate the recent death of another undercover cop at the hands of some dealers.  Joining Tellis in his quest is Detective Lieutenant Henry R. Oaks, a personal friend of the murdered man and something of a rogue cop himself, known for going outside the law when he deems it appropriate and even using violence against suspects in order to achieve his ends.  Together the two men unravel the clues in the hope of bringing the right people to justice.
For about the first half of the movie's running time, writer/director Joe Carnahan manages to elevate ""Narc"" above the formulaic limits of its genre by focusing on the personal struggle Tellis is going through.  Here is a man who is attempting to come to terms with the trauma caused by his recent experiences, as well as trying to find a proper balance between obsession over the case he's been handed to solve and the love he has for his devoted wife and infant son.  The film also does a nice job bringing to life the behind-the-scenes aspects of undercover narcotics works.  But about halfway through the film, the plot mechanics begin to take over and we are subjected to the kind of gimmicky plot twists that have become all too familiar from countless crime dramas on TV.  To make matters worse, in the case of ""Narc,"" the revelatory ""twist"" at the end of the story is one that can be detected about five minutes into the movie.  It's a shame that a film that begins with such promise should fall apart so completely, turning into little more than an overwrought, utterly unconvincing two-bit melodrama by the end.
And this does total injustice to both Jason Patric and Ray Liotta, who deliver solid performances as Tellis and Oaks, respectively, and to Krista Bridges, who provides some powerful moments as Tellis' loving but distraught wife who hates seeing her husband becoming once again absorbed by the insidious power of the career he has chosen.
You can go about halfway with ""Narc,"" but, then, why bother when you can get pretty much the same thing for free on TV?",1042848000,2,2704,4.709745762711864
