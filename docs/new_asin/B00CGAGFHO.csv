8581539,4,B00CGAGFHO,I use these videos often to instruct my seventh grade religious education class.  The students really can relate to the subject matter being presented in this clever way.  You can download some of the videos from You Tube  but not all are available online for free.  I felt it was worth the money (not very expensive) to have them all at my fingertips.,1478131200,,352,4.5396825396825395
8581540,5,B00CGAGFHO,Adorable and dynamic! The middle-school youth group loves to watch these adorable videos. I intersperse them with the reading lessons to keep things interesting and help them absorb the lessons. They are great for youth and adults alike and bring theological concepts and terms within reach.,1443484800,,291,5.3478260869565215
8581541,5,B00CGAGFHO,"Pithy, clever, theologically-sound, entertaining, intelligent but accessible- these videos are excellent for use in the classroom, parish hall, or just general education.

If I had one negative critique, some background music during the videos would be pleasant. But, that's just a matter of my personal taste, the videos themselves are great.

I highly recommend this to anyone who teaches (there certainly seems to be a gearing towards Jr. High-High School aged individuals, but the videos are accessible to younger people and informative to older ones as well) or who wishes to edify themselves in regards to the faith.",1380672000,,622,5.336734693877551
8581542,5,B00CGAGFHO,"The chapters are short, funny, good, clear and interesting.
I think it is useful for teenagers and younger specially.
A good summary about fundamental concepts.",1372291200,,160,5.44
8581543,5,B00CGAGFHO,It is a great tool to teach. Each video lasts 3 minutes with very appropriate examples. I recommend it to everyone.,1371340800,,115,4.523809523809524
8581544,5,B00CGAGFHO,"It is a great tool for catechizing, based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Thanks to God, in first place, and to Kathmedia for 3MC.",1370390400,,139,4.384615384615385
