Better yet, try:

""Day 51""

""Waco: Rules of Engagement""

""Waco: A New Revelation""",1149465600,,253,5.2
8069881,5,B0009XT8MY,"Okay, so only one of those statements is true.  It may be better than Cats, though

I received this cinematic masterpiece as an early birthday present and, although I don't speak a word of Spanish and adding English subtitles would have doubled this movie's production budget, I really felt moved by this film.  It touched me in ways that David Coleman touches young girls.

There is nary a thing about this movie that could be improved upon.  The casting was absolutely flawless: I honestly thought they had signed the real Janet Reno to star as herself. Special effects?  You would think that actual news footage was spliced in.  And the dialogue and line delivery were so fantastic that you honestly could believe that you were locked inside the shoebox with the rest of the cult members.

I have to watch this movie again, right now, and drown myself in its glory.  And I can hope that someday I, too, may have a mullet as fantastic as David Coleman.",1147996800,,954,4.630952380952381
8069882,5,B0009XT8MY,"This is quite possibly the most important film of our generation. You must purchase this film at any price. The acting, scenic design, and special effects are first-rate. Particular cudos to the drag queen portraying Janet Reno.

I wept when the little shoebox (oops, I'm sorry - Davidian Compound) blew up and caught on fire.

This puts ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" to shame!",1139529600,4,373,4.8125
