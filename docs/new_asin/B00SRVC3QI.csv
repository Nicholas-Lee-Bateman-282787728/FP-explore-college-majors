8699103,5,B00SRVC3QI,"I love this PV set. Personally I love all the songs, but that's with an Dir en grey love bias. With that out of the way, here is the nitty gritty stuff I have to say. Most of the video and audio quality was....pretty good. I wish I could say it was spot on, however I cannot for several reasons. The engineers that mastered the video did a pretty poor job with anything hard red, although I find everything that is produced in Japan has this problem. Besides that and poor CGI effects I was pretty pleased compared to older Average PV releases on DVD. I realize that this type of problem can't really be fixed without throwing more money at the production, but that's what separates this from fantastic.

The audio mixing is a different story. I noticed this had 24-bit audio, however on the only title I verified this with it's in fact zero padded 16-bit master. What does this mean? Nothing, except marketing is trying to make you think that you're getting every song in 24-bit studio quality (vs CD quality). I did find that Different Sense was 24-bits, but I haven't done a full dive analyses to see if there is any difference.

The only other thing I would want to change is to have anymore restricted versions of PVs. I still don't know why Japan still has censoring issues with optical media. But I can't see that being SMEJ problem directly. I also would rather have new live footage instead of 'Making of' material.",1431648000,,1424,4.494208494208494
