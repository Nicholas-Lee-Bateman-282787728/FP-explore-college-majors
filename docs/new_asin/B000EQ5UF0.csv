8112761,5,B000EQ5UF0,"Here's a video for your kids which dares to be gentle, sweet, and educational.  Fun graphics and animation, simple and pleasing design, and doesn't talk down to kids, or try to get them all hopped up by assaulting their senses.  Looking forward to the next one in the series.",1151884800,,275,4.591836734693878
8112762,5,B000EQ5UF0,"Our son is only 18 months old, but the video kept his attention right to the end.  He may not yet understand many of the 'lessons', but he certainly was entertained.  Buy this DVD for your collection if you want to watch a program with enough adult focused content to prevent 'Barney-brain-damage'.",1145836800,2,298,4.711538461538462
8112763,5,B000EQ5UF0,"I have a 4 year old son who loved this DVD.  The animation is so cool, I found myself glued to the screen, too!  My son really got a kick out of the ""teacher"" Dom DeLouise, he kept laughing and smiling.  Very educational, while keeping it ""real.""  Get this DVD, your kids will love it!",1145577600,2,285,4.127272727272727
8112764,5,B000EQ5UF0,"""...without question this is one of the finest educational programs directed toward young children that I have ever seen.""

 ""...I was struck by how respectful the program was of the kids. The program seemed driven by what the kids said...and in this way did indeed function `like a bridge' between their imagination and the things-of-space-and-sea...

It was safe for kids to explore, to imagine, to think about things, without seeming like `instruction'. So the program showed a deep respect

for children. Marvelous.""

"" [it] was not overly instructional [but] there were real occasions for learning... learning the names of things-- seahorses, planets, [etc.] but it also encouraged integrative thinking, too. It invited, for example, kids to think about the connection between space and sea. And, in one segment, taught a meta-cognitive skill (e.g., a mnemonic to remember the names of the planets in the correct order).""

""...It was important to have real kids featured, and to feature both younger ... and older... kids. Peer-to-peer interaction will hold the attention of young viewers, and featuring the imagination of younger kids juxtaposed with the commentary of older kids serves as another kind of developmental `bridge'. It is also important to hear the dreams of the older kids-- to be a marine biologist, or an astronaut. From an

Eriksonian perspective, hearing about the amazing exotic `big world' of adults makes the prospect of growing up an exciting adventure.""

""... high praise all-round... an enormous achievement.""
