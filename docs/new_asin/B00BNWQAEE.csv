8571748,4,B00BNWQAEE,"wow yeah i knew it was indy comedy and lower budget but it's different. unique i guess. the characters are offbeat but i loved a lot of lines, a few corny ones but overall pretty good -- - the chuck guy has a good amount of lines that stick with you but so does ""barry"" and the to-camera monologues are pretty funny imho. strange topic and strange twist but i liked it because it wasn't run of the mill. i do wish that the 'thing' ( don't want to spoil it ) were bigger or more elaborate but i guess maybe that was part of the point? i'm glad i grabbed it, i hadn't heard of it, but i give it a pretty good thumbs up.",1365120000,,617,3.9047619047619047
