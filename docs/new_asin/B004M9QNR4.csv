4429250,5,B004M9QNR4,"This was shown on the History Channel a number of times and is arguably the best mass disaster/social collapse docudrama overview made to date.  The basic scenario revolves around a global pandemic that kills off most but not all of the population in the advanced industrial world.  The fictional scenario is shown with commentary by various experts about what happened in the past and recent real disasters.  The experts are really knowledgeable in the areas they comment on, especially Joseph Tainter author of _The Collapse of Complex Societies_ which I highly recommend.  Three other things make this show stand out:  1.  This show was much better produced than most shows like it.  2.  The treatment of psychological and emotional issues was more honest and detailed than I have ever seen in a show like this before.  3.  This show is considerably more comprehensive than most others in that it addresses issues and skills of both short and long term survival and the transition between them.
  Surviving disasters that induce social collapse on an international level will involve luck as much as preparedness and this is communicated mainly by implication in this program.  Final note:  This show is for adults and not children or adults who get easily upset.

Note(01/22/12):  This docudrama is included in the History Channel's dvd collection ""The 2012 Anthology"" in its' entirety and not a fifty minute version as listed on the case in the collection.",1301788800,68,1461,5.050209205020921

4429253,5,B004M9QNR4,"Was based on a ""what if"" scenario....Thank goodness nothing that tragic has occurred in the U.S. but one never knows, it just might!
Kinda makes you think.... what if it does happen?  What if something like this does happen or some other paramount event!  WILL YOU BE READY? What will happen to me and my loved ones?????? Some people call me paranoid, but I simply respond I am probably more prepared than you are if some event were to happen!! Ask yourself that WHAT IF question. And if you have to sit there and think about it....your not prepared for anything

The one phrase I use when it comes to a lot of things is.....it's like a condom....I'd rather have it and not it need than need it and not have it!
think about it folks!",1491091200,,733,4.375
4429254,5,B004M9QNR4,"Gee?  I  wish  I'd  have  written  my  review  here,  instead  of  in  (After  people).
I'm  sure  this  type  of  film  would  probably  give  some  viewers  out  there  some  nightmares.  This  is  something  nobody  wants  to  think  about,  but  we  have  to  face  the  fact  that  it  can  happen!  Thinking  about  hiring  a  bodyguard  to  protect  you  from  every  suspicious  individual?  Forget  it!  You'll  either  have  to  stand  your  ground  or  else  it'll  feel  like  your  getting  bullied!
One  family  experiences  changes  in  reality.  The  wife  is  urging  the  husband  to  stay  home  &  not  go  to  work.  Be  supportive.  Can  you  imagine  going  to  a  restaurant  or  the  mall,  to  the  movie  theaters  &  have  the  electricity  &  water  stop  working?  &  no  matter  how  long  you  wait  you'll  never  have  these  resources  again.  The  story  takes  my  breath  away.  The  small  family  must  decide  whether  or  not  to  stay  &  struggle  in  a  house  of  their  own  get  by  with  the  food  they  got  without  the  electricity.  &  watch  the  community  &  the  city  around  them  crumble,  or  should  they  leave,  make  a  break  for  it,  &  be  willing  to  walk  60  or  70  miles.  Their  neighbor  couldn't  have  been  more  right!  Its  like  he  new  what  was  going  to  happen.  So  he  leaves  the  city  to  make  the  journey  to  Idaho,  rather  then  just  staying  in  the  city  for  the  next  2  months  like  this  small  family  does.  Normality  just  vanishes.  It  is  no  more,  &  not  planning  in  advance  is  what  caused  them  the  problems  they  experienced.
Its  quite  a  story  as  the  husband  does  his  best  to  maintain  proper  ways  of  thinking,  &  trying  not  to  get  in  too  much  over  is  head  with  some  things  if  possible.
I  got  to  admit  that  is  one  heck  of  a  scary  world  to  live  in.  The  computer,  the  TV, The  Microwave,  refrigerator,  you  got  to  forget  about  those  things.  They  can  go  to  the  junk  yard  now.  &  if  you  want  ice  you  really  have  to  go  to  a  snow  covered  mountain  to  get  it.
This  tells  the  tale  of  all  sorts  of  complications.  The  writer  did  excellent  with  this  show.  Its  perfect.
My  heart  beats  a  little  bit  while  watching  this.  You  do  though  at  times  feel  for  the  family.  Nobody  cuts  them  any  breaks.  They  get  shot  at,  they're  not  welcome  where  a  town  is  guarded  from  all  angles,  &  in  the  one  town  where  they  temporarily  settle  up  for  a  few  nights,  a  Sheriff  shoots  some  boys  after  being  apprehended  like  animals.  Several  people  come  in  on  a  large  truck,  selling  certain  items  to  people,  including  beer,  or  chips.
Mind  blowing,  interesting,  I  loved  it.
Changes  in  society  &  reality  made  almost  everybody  crazy.
All  I  can  say  is  this  opens  up  our  eyes  ears  &  minds.  &  viewers  kind  of  wonder  (What  if?)
I  own  not  this  single  episode  (After Armageddon)  But  a  3  disc  thing  entitled  (After  people)  After Armageddon  included.
Its  not  pretty.
It  just  makes  you  wonder  a  little  bit.  Wish  there  was  more  of  this.  I  mean  I  wish  there  was  more  to  the  film.
I  don't  believe  its  everything  the  director  or  the  writer  can  think  of.  If  this  did  happen  in  our  society  I  think  our  nation  would  have  to  somehow  summon  every  single  person  that  ever  joined  the  Navy,  or  the  Marines,  &  send  them  to  places  around  our  country  to  help  try  to  maintain  law  &  order  as  well  as  the  chaos  from  certain  types  of  people.  That  is  my  best  solution  to  this  sudden  catastrophe.

As  humans  we  do  not  have  to  be  or  get  crazy  out  of  our  minds.  For  what  its  worth  even  if  this  did  happen  people  should  try  &  maintain  common  sense!  In  situations  like  this  it  would  put  anyone's  mind  to  the  test.  Police  officers  would  have  to  use  their  own  judgement  without  being  able  to  contact  the  dispatcher  at  the  station.  So  to  send  backup  would  be  unlikely,  to  contact  another  officer  on  the  highway  anywhere  would  be  impossible.
Its  the  end  of  security  cameras,  alarm  systems,  all  that's  over  &  done  with.
But  its  one  heck  of  a  show  about  people  being  forced  to  change  or  get  by  with  something  they're  not  use  to!
Quite  stunning!!!!!!!
Stuff  like  this  can  be  prevented  if  electricians  work  their  hardest  world  wide.
If  we  suffer  this  fate  its  because  one  of  the  workers  out  there  did  something  wrong!  We  would all be put to the ultimate test.  We're the ones that must decide in this world to avoid the surprises around every corner.
Its one heck of  a  thing to think about.  The world is growing, & we're use to living an easy life.  It can come to an end though.  To  be  ready  for  something  like  this  you  would  have  to  get  well  stocked  on  a  certain  amount  of  items.  One  item  that  can  power  electricity  perhaps  in  a  mobile  home  maybe  a  gasoline  generator.  My  Dad  uses  those  on  the  ranch.

4429268,3,B004M9QNR4,"There are things I liked about it, and things I disliked. As other reviewers have noted, it's a story of one 3-member family and how they survived after a pandemic infection has killed much of population of the world, with the resultant loss of energy and food and clean water sources that our civilization takes for granted.

The heavy use of guns in the latter part of the film, and the return to religious fervor, as well as gangster tactics, is probably realistic. But I found the story too long and depressing, and it was hard to become attached to the principal characters. The mother seemed to erupt in tears throughout their travails, as if that would produce anything positive. And the father was rather bland, and what annoyed me about him was that throughout the film he had a clean-shaven face, which was totally unrealistic. I happen to notice things like that. At least the mother wasn't smothered with make-up, but she also had a clean face in every scene. Probably all of those tears kept the dirt washed away. Since the people they encountered were acting pretty much as I might expect, some attempt to be realistic was made, but the clean, well-shaven face of the father grated on me. The comments of the experts seemed to be appropriate, but it also bothered me when I watched several minutes of doom and gloom as the family trudged along, minus their wheels, looking for food or water, and one of the women experts made comments with a smile erupting on her face. Totally discordant. The fate of the father was rather unexpected, but by that time I really didn't care that much.

It was acted well enough, so I won't fault them, but that clean-shaven face of the father was too phony. With all of their problems, the family certainly wasn't carrying razor blades and shaving cream among their essentials.",1463702400,7,1824,4.679127725856698

To make matters worse almost no food remains and drinkable water is no where to be found. Other problems this family must contend with are individuals who have banded together to pillage the country side taking people's food and other supplies who are unable or unwilling to take defensive measures. On top of all that the lack of medications, no antibiotics etc...you get sick or cut or injured and you could be facing certain death due to infection.

This ""normal family"" is beyond stupid and annoying.  Who the hell stays in a house for 4 MONTHS while the end of the world is going on outside? By the way, for some reason most of the survivors are gangs of maniacs who steal TV's.  What you are going to do with a stolen TV with no power, internet, cable, ect.. is anyone's guess. Why they keep comparing a PANDEMIC TO KATRINA IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION.  It's like comparing the great flood.to a hurricane.
By the way, to say civilization will never be the same is ludicrous.  Europe lost 2/3 of their population in the Plague and recovered eventually.  This is a film made to create more survivalist and petrify regular people.  It serves no other purpose.",1412380800,2,834,4.601351351351352

4429291,5,B004M9QNR4,"I watched this on the History Channel. It deals with the very real possibility of what would happen after a pandemic. The documentary starts after about 25% of the population has passed away due to a virus that kills quickly. All of those things in life we are used to suddenly start to disappear. Stores are picked clean. Cable, water, and electric stop working. The police are over whelmed. What I liked about this Docu-Drama was that it showed you how someone would prepare after a major pandemic. This documentary has expert testimony as the story progressed of the right and wrong things to do as your city shuts down. Surprisingly one of the things people run out of quickly was water to drink. Of course that could depend on where you live in the country. Despite all the prepper shows on TV that showed people stock piling mass quantity's of every human need, and bunkers. This documentary focused on just the bare basic's of what you would need to survive. It is well worth watching. It is graphic, but done in good taste. For those out there that shrug this off and say this could never happen. It did happen in 1918, and 10 - 20% of the entire population of the earth was killed off by a massive flu virus.

discussed behavioral changes, lack of services, mental& medical health issues, and personal challenges.
It was a dramatic presentation as well as a documentary. A lot was packed into a few hours. The writers (and thers) did a great job in presenting the facts without beating us up with stats. Plus they related/connected it to currents evets..""this was seen during blackouts, this was seen during Hurricane Katrina...,.."". By giving such effective commentary, it was demonstrated that this world has had disasters, how can we handle them.

And this particular film tends to lean towards the absolutes that might come out of such events. Basically, your choices are National Geographic or the History Channel for these kinds of films. ""Life After People"" is far tamer and easier to watch. ""After Armageddon"" is far scarier and more a warning of things to come for those ""doomsday preppers"" out there. It gives one pause for thinking about how bad life could be for survivors of a cataclysmic event. It was worth buying, but leans more towards a bit of morbid futurism...RL",1365552000,3,643,4.649122807017544
4429304,3,B004M9QNR4,"Before watching this, I was a prepper who read a lot of preparedness and survivalist-oriented literature. This docudrama is one of the better ones that I've seen, but it is nowhere near perfect.

My primary complaint is the ""drama"" section, with an inadequate storyline. For example, one scene which occured 3-4 months after the outbreak of the pandemic was particularly flawed. Even with hundreds of millions dead around the world, these people still are surprised when their refrigerator goes out, and head down to the now-empty and deserted store. Who stays cooped up in their house for 3 months with not a clue about what is going on outside? When they try to leave the city and run into the highway robbers, they are traumatized. Wouldn't news about such things have gotten around already? The stench from all of the dead would make the air intolerable to breathe as well after a couple of weeks of the hospitals failing. This would probably force them to leave much earlier. These type of reactions are what normally happens two days after a disaster, not four months.

Later on, I am still mystified why they are so uncautious about meeting strangers. Again the timeline of the events seems questionable.

The latter part of the documentary was more in line with the general post-apocalyptic expectations, but the first part could have had a more detailed and coherent plot.",1363737600,3,1381,4.8931623931623935

4429308,5,B004M9QNR4,"I first saw this on the History Channel.  It was so good that I ordered one as a gift for someone.  It follows a family - parents and a teen boy - that were living in a regular city neighboor and house with white picket fence.

In this scenario, there was a pandemic illness that spread across the world and everything was shut off... electricity, water, empty shelves in the stores, etc.

However, it could be anything... an EMP or other.

First, they were in the dark and didn't know what it was.  But then the teen's laptop went out and he was complaining.... As things progressed, they knew something was really wrong.  They were burying their waste in the backyard at first because the toilets wouldn't flush.... They had storage, but it wasn't enough.  They couldn't carry it.

Then the criminals were raiding homes and they had to leave.  Cars were stalled on the freeway out of gas and they had to walk and also hide from the criminals.  Very realistic.

What was even better was when there was a break occasionally and narration from people who explained what happens to people psychologically in this situation.

Recommend highly!  However, review first before watching it with young children.  There are scary scenes.",1354579200,10,1228,4.726415094339623

4429310,3,B004M9QNR4,"This is the documentary that doomsday enthusiasts have been waiting for. All of the right elements are there to paint a compelling image of the end of the world as we know it. Unfortunately it ends up being sort of a tepid dishrag of a production, and I'm pretty sure that the fault lies in the direction

The documentary takes us into a hypothetical breakdown of society after an imagined influenza pandemic. In order to humanize the scenario, it is structured around the journey of one fictional, ""normal"" family through the apocalypse, from the first sneeze to the last staph infection after the antibiotics run out. This is just the thing to do, but the members of this family are dismally boring, to the point that it's hard to care whether they make it or not.

The action is punctuated with interjections from a host of experts, and most of them actually are experts of one sort or another. There are lots of academics who have presumably studied disasters, and they are generally making reasonable observations in as dull a manner as possible. The director has mixed in a few people of questionable expertise who spout off their opinions with a bit more vigor, but since they are all put on the same level in the film it's hard to tell a good source of information from a bad one.

The actual dramatizations of survival-type scenarios are middling at best. Some seem kind of plausible, but others are outright misleading. In one case, for example, an expert explains that you can boil water to make it biologically safe and the scene cuts to the family boiling rusty water drained from a car radiator. After they cook it, it's miraculously clear and palatable and that just doesn't happen. Never mind that the boiling does nothing for whatever chemicals might leech out of an old radiator. That bit of miscommunication could actually get someone killed.

All in all, the video is kind of interesting. I've watched it a couple of times. Still, it's not a brilliant reference, nor is it particularly entertaining. It's kind of a miss, but if you're into critically speculating on the end of the world you won't want to miss it.",1353456000,22,2133,4.710455764075067
4429311,5,B004M9QNR4,"Spot on! Most Americans- like so many of my friends- suffer from ""Convenience Store Syndrome."" I caught ""Aftermath: Armageddon"" on the History Channel and then ordered four DVDs for my ""Cognitive Dissonance"" friends.

Bear in  mind, it's always better to be a part of the solution than part of the problem. REALITY CHECK: If you are part of the ""problem"", the BEST that you can hope for is to find yourself sitting on a cot in a gymnasium waiting to get in line for a cheese-spread sandwich, peanut-butter crackers and a bottle of water.

4429315,2,B004M9QNR4,"Okay, to begin with the civilized world has already survived, with minor intteruptions of the time's basic services major pandemics so the entire premise of Apocalypse from it is absurd. If anything things would be LESS precious, because we'd have less demand on resources. Plus the idea that the government would simply abadon everything and everyone has already shown itself to be untrue. Were the scenario that we were hit by a meteor, I'd find this more credible. As it is---an absurd valentine to survivalists from the get go.

Even suspending disbelief and going with the premise--there's just soooooo much stupid that I found myself laughing all over the place. Water, food and fuel are precious, yet the family is able to last 4 months after the fact, still driving around in LA? They should've siphoned the fuel out of their car and ridden off with their neighbors when they had the chance. Also, they're finally prompted to leave (and are shocked) by looting. Isn't looting in LA like, basically, Tuesday? Also, why were the looters stealing big screen TVs when there hadn't been power for months? What could they possibly do with those?

Soooooo with (again) fuel and water being at a premium, they decide to go to Idaho---as opposed to the much closer Northern CA or Southern, OR where there'd be more rain---negating the water sacrcity issue. Actually, they could've just gone to the beach with 2 tarps and a plastic bowl and turned ocean water into fresh water. And even though they're gonna take a road trip and know how dangerous LA is, they feel no need to bring a spare tire or even flat fix spray.

They also don't ""get"" the concept of jam packed highways (even though they live in LA), so they have to flee the city limits on foot. Of course once out of the city, they're able to snag a new SUV off a dead guy and go skipping off on their trip through the desert (with limited water---which again, could've been avoided if they had simply headed for the Redwoods and the food and shelter they'd provide). One of my favorite vignettes during their desert trek is the dad freaking out over wasting water for teeth brushing. The mom responds with ""but we've gotta brush our teeth"". Really? in survival mode and worying about oral hygiene. I think tooth paste wouldn't have even made it into my ""bug out bag"". If I have cavity versus dead, I'll take the cavity.

During their Mojave desert adventure they save one injured dude, encounter a little girl with a 12 guage (that has no kickback when she shoots it) and the wife kills a dude to protect her man. After she blows away the guy, she freaks out and blows chucks, in the process they lose their car and all their provisions, yet again. So now they walk through the blistering desert during the day, resting at night. Except basic common sense says to travel at night when it's cooler and rest during the day.

Also super stupid? They ""save"" themselves by drinking radiator water filtered through the dad's filthy dusty shirt and then heated with a convenient car battery and steel wool (the house had steel wool and a battery, but no coffee filters?). That water would've killed them, since it would've contained anti-freeze, rust, battery acid, etc. Not to mention, there would've been water in the desert plants and cacti all around them.

As they're stupidly walking through the daytime desert, all at death's door, who should drive up behind them but the dude whose life they saved way back down the road. How convenient. He takes them to some fundy town run by its sherrif/warlord just over the Nevada border, where they're inexplicably allowed to live and join the community (as opposed to the previous guarded small town, where they were shot at).

Also inexplicably, the fundy Nevada DESERT town not only has water, but has enough that they can wash bed linens and return to normal level of cleanliness. They actually whine about how ugly their ""new"" dishware is. In the fundy town, they're safe, fed and secure--they do have to attend church and hear about how pissed off Jesus is at them AND Sherrif Warlord shoots looters in front of everyone, but hey, even super progressive, agnostic me would've been singing about my friend Jesus and keeping my trap shut. Not our idiots, they leave as soon as possible on a truck bed and inexplicably make their way to the land of promise, Idaho (where there would've been MORE freaky survivalists, but one is not supposed to know that).

In Idaho, they become farmers and the Dad becomes a naturopath---but is unable to save himself from an infected cut (ummmmm...). Fast forward 25 years, their whiney son is now a gorwn up father, the community is still under gun protection (somehow they never run out of bullets, even though manufacturing has snut down?).

And the ""experts"" blather about how there will never again be any sort of technology and no one will live in cities again. Except even that makes zero sense: Most US cities are on major bodies of fresh water---it's why they were settled in the first place. Not to mention it's why cities were settled 5,000+ years ago. Plus there's been varying forms of technology for as long as there's been civilization---developed by people with far less knowledge than we have today. Not to mention, generators have been around for a long, long time.

While I suppose one should be somewhat prepared for emergencies---and absolutely ""the big one"" could hit us at any time (at which point we'd be dead, anyway). This was probably sillier than Gilligan's Island.",1325462400,20,5529,4.738045738045738

4429319,5,B004M9QNR4,"This is really more a docu-drama than anything else.  It focuses on an ""average American"" family of three, totally unprepared as most are, and how they attempt to survive a world-wide disaster.

Various experts in survival, defense, sociology, psychology, and others put in commentary in various places. These comments are very insightful and relevant, based more on actual real-world events than just theories.

I first saw this on the History channel, and ended up ordering a copy at Amazon.  The whole family sat an watched it one night, and we paused it a lot to talk about what the actors did right, what they did wrong, and what opportunities they missed.  It served to get everyone thinking about what we could do and prepare for in a disaster situation.

Because of what I do and where we live, preparedness for a disaster, natural or man-made, is a must for us.  This movie points out many things everyone can do to have at least a minimum level of supplies on hand and how to best utilize them.  It stresses awareness and the ability to adapt to changing and deteriorating circumstances.  It also touches on security - holding on to what you do have when others will be more than willing to take that away.

Overall, this is an excellent primer for everyone.  It covers a lot of tips and techniques, touches on a wide range of scenarios, and stresses the most important thing - thinking and learning.  I would highly recommend it to everyone, even if you're someone who's already thinking ahead.",1311897600,45,1505,4.724137931034483
