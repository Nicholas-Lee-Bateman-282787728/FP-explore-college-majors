8689062,1,B00PRVPO3K,This DVD is incorrectly labeled as All Regions/NTSC.  It is actually in PAL format and will not play in USA DVD players.  It might play in your PC/laptop.  Very disappointing.,1497657600,,175,4.766666666666667
8689063,4,B00PRVPO3K,"The video is great! The only problem is you cannot hear clearly when demonstrating an event since translator and teacher are talking at the same time.
I would still but it for reference and good demonstrations.",1426032000,2,210,4.861111111111111
