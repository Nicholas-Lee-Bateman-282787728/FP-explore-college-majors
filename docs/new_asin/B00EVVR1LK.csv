5948889,5,B00EVVR1LK,"I saw this movie at a Secure World Expo in Boston back in March and have been waiting for the DVD ever since.  It was a facinating look at the history of hacking and what the future may hold.  When, oh when can I BUY it?  I want to see it AGAIN!",1379289600,,245,3.673076923076923
5948890,5,B00EVVR1LK,"Saw this premiered at SecureWorld Expo in St. Louis yesterday. Director and producer Jeremy Zerechak was on hand to introduce the documentary and for Q/A afterwards. It is a self-produced film that Jeremy says will be available for streaming online and for DVD purchase starting September 21st. Blu-ray edition will follow two weeks later. Well-done documentary starting with the technology race provoked by Sputnik, continuing through the phone phreaking era, the dawn of personal computers, and the rise of the Internet. Woven through this was the theme of the nobility of ""hacking"" as exploration of an unknown frontier before it acquired its more nefarious connotation. Well worth getting and watching.",1378857600,4,706,5.427272727272728
8609990,1,B00EVVR1LK,This documentary is about hacking and it portrays it in a biased light. The film tries to promote the idea of good hackers and bad hackers. Invasion of privacy is morally wrong and in most cases illegal. Doesn't matter if you hack someones gamer account or attack the DOD or steal a million dollars from Wall Street. Hacking on all levels is a crime. I had to roll my eyes when they interviewed hackers in a dark room so people couldn't see their faces.,1526860800,,453,4.404761904761905
8609991,4,B00EVVR1LK,"Wades around in the world of computing since its inception. Toward the end, it says that cybersecurity is a fraud perpetrated by big government by the media with the NSA winning. They are trying to scare us into giving up our privacy. Good overview of hacking and its implications. It says that technology is moving very fast and getting ahead of even the government and that the younger generation should be consulted rather than told what to do. The subject of technology and computing is too big for any one video to sum up and display. A lot of amusing footage from old documentaries from the 40's 50's and 60's. It moves quickly back and forth between this older footage and the present.",1516924800,,692,4.634146341463414

8609997,1,B00EVVR1LK,"The video is excellent but the DVD is defective. It stops approximately 22 minutes into the video. This was playing it on Windows 10 with the VLC player. Tried it on two Windows 7 pcs same stoppage at same point in the video. I teach computer classes at a local college and didn't open  the DVD until last week to show in class. The DVD is defective and it is past the return deadline to return the DVD. I ended up finding the documentary on YouTube and showing it to my classes that way. You would think the DVD would  be defective. Lesson learned, open and play video immediately.",1465171200,,582,4.330275229357798
