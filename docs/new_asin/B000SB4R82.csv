8205059,4,B000SB4R82,"I saw this stunning, beautiful 1988 on the French channel (T&eacute;l&eacute;Monde 5) of my cable television service here WITH great English sub-titles, and was so delighted that I purchased this French DVD, yet was dismayed to find, when I received this DVD that the French TV channel must have added the English sub-titles themselves.

This is shot on location in Brittany with a spectacular cast of actors & actresses, great cinematography, superb costumes and perfectly brings to life this amazing Balzac novel that is set in the beautiful but wildly chaotic and violent Directory era immediately after the French Revolution and before Napoleon. This is a time so poorly and rarely explained in history books, and yet so important to know about in order to understand the vast upheaval that followed right afterwards, when France simply attacked all Europe. The supremely pretty and whimsical settings in Brittany and
amongst the country Bretons actually make the crazy events of this pivotal time easier to understand.

The French television broadcast had also unfortunately cut off the last 10 minutes of the film, so we were also very pleased to finally see how it had ended !!",1423872000,4,1184,5.097938144329897
