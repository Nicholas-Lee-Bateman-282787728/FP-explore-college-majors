8098368,5,B000CEVC92,"This is such a fun old series of early television, I remember it as a child and was delighted when I found the DVD's.  One thing I have learned when buying these old TV series it's important to have the titles of episodes.  There's many different versions on the market and duplicates are far too easy to buy.  Bob plays both himself and Grandpa and Grandpa is a HOOT!

5 Episodes on this DVD are:
Bob Goes Bird Watching
Bob Saves Harvey
Bob Judges a Beauty Contest
Grandpa Moves West
Bob Gets Harvey a Raise",1297468800,6,508,4.315789473684211
