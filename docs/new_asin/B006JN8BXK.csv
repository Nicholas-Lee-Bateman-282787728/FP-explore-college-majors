Rick, Michele and Scarlett focuses on the relationship between these three friends, and how intertwined Rick and Michele's lives are. It also emphasizes their life long friendship as it follows them from Michele's eccentric cafe in L.A. (with many guests appearances, like the artist Ed Ruscha) to Rick's fashion show in Paris.
