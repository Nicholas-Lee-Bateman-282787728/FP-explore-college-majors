2421934,5,B000BKDO0C,"Dry Falls near Sun Lakes State Park is my #1 favorite summer destination.  The ice age flood is fascinating, and I really like this video.  The only thing it left out, compared to the video at the Dry Falls Visitor Center, is the alteration to geographic perception that the new aerial photography brought about.  The video is unnecessarily dramatic, I think.  You don't really need so many camera zooms and cuts when you're filming a geologist walking on rocky ground.  But the geologist was well-spoken and this is very good documentary.",1232323200,,539,4.8791208791208796
2421935,5,B000BKDO0C,"Once again Nova ignites the love of learning! My 7 year old loves this DVD, but then again we're locals.  We live in the middle of the Purcell Trench, drive through part of the Scablands to see one set of grandparents and were just in Missoula last summer with the other set.

Nonetheless, the formation of the Scablands is such an amazingly catastrophic event that it has to be interesting to almost everybody.  A flood averaging over 10 cubic miles an hour for two whole days has to excite the imagination, and the flood floor is fully visible.

For adults, there's a bit too much un-required jerking in the camera work. An accurate map of the Scablands, the ice dam, and Glacial Lake Missoula, each of which are roughly 100 miles apart would have been nice as well. These are minor flaws and are easily remedied by picking up a copy of the book ""Glacial Lake Missoula"" by David Alt.",1210550400,4,885,4.5125
2421936,5,B000BKDO0C,"I originally stumbled onto this video while routinely watching NOVA.  I sat spellbound and immediately ordered our own family copy.  While this geologic event may seem most meaningful to Northwestern residents, it has some ageless philosophical as well as scientific overtones.  It also provides a glimpse into the extreme natural swings in climate change that happened a relatively short time ago without any influence by man.  And it provides a classic historical lesson that valid scientific conclusions should not be based on a popular vote.",1175299200,15,545,5.376470588235295
2421937,5,B000BKDO0C,"It's 'too bad' that we may never have 'definitive' proof of the theory of a series of megafloods, combined with-demonstrated by layers of extracta from Mt St Helens that tends to support this theory now.

Wisdom has shown that as old theories die, new ones, but not necessarily  accurate ones take their place. I'm not a geologist, but these theories certainly tend to disprove certain prior idea(s) that the earth is only about 6,000 years old.

This is an EXCELLENT production that all but the least scientific among us will probably appreciate, if only on an 'armchair' basis.

So much for religion...",1147737600,5,604,4.892156862745098
2421938,5,B000BKDO0C,"As Louis Pastuer said when accepting an award from the French Academy of Science ""No new idea is accepted by science without resistance"".  This idea of a great flood was a revolutionary idea.  The resistance was based on what was known by geologists at the time.  Frequently, a new idea must wait for acceptance as a mainstream belief until the old scientists are dead and the younger scientists who grew with the idea are then in charge. I will be using this video in a geology course not just for the geology but as an example of how science works and how ideas evolve.",1140739200,25,571,4.471153846153846
2421959,5,B000BKDO0C,Lot of people do not know about this here in the northwest. It's an amazing bit of ancient history.,1447977600,,99,4.2631578947368425
2421960,4,B000BKDO0C,Good but not great. i learned a lot about the flood and that is why we ordered the DVD. It is worth adding to your learning shelf to learn more about the Northwest.,1447113600,,164,4.0
2421961,2,B000BKDO0C,Poorly written. Could be greatly improved by a smoother flow of ideas. As it is there is needless repetition.,1441065600,,109,4.7894736842105265
2421962,5,B000BKDO0C,A well-done DVD that tells of the huge floods that scoured Eastern Washington state and the Columbia River Gorge during the late stages of the Ice Age.,1439942400,,151,4.62962962962963
2421963,3,B000BKDO0C,It explains the events but the music (noise) overwhelms the audio narration at times. I also read a book about this event so wasn't a revelation to me. I love geology so it held my interest. The book explains more details about the flood routes.,1431993600,,245,4.466666666666667
2421964,4,B000BKDO0C,"Great DVD, it makes me want to visit the area.",1427932800,,46,3.7

2421966,5,B000BKDO0C,"Excellent and recent documentary on the flood that ravaged the pacific northwest over and over at the end of the last ice age, sculpting out the familiar features of Lake Pend Oreille, the scablands, the dry waterfalls, etc. Music is excellent and not a lot of dry scientists talking, but the idea of what happened is conveyed well. Suitable to use as a teaching aid.

Very imformative as well as entertaining, if you are interested in geology.",1425686400,3,444,4.766233766233766
2421967,5,B000BKDO0C,Great explanation of the Glacial Lake Missoula Flood that washed across eastern Washington and down the Columbia and even UP the Willamette before heading to the Pacific.,1424649600,,170,5.333333333333333
2421968,5,B000BKDO0C,Fascinating depiction of events that shaped such beautiful country. The story behind the unfolding understanding of what occurred is very interesting,1424563200,,149,6.142857142857143
2421969,5,B000BKDO0C,Very well done and very educational.,1422662400,,36,5.166666666666667

2421971,5,B000BKDO0C,"One of the best I've seen for science, drama, and human interest.  Even the music is good--not the sleep inducing classical of some PBS videos.  I show it to Earth Science classes after studying erosion.",1420156800,,203,4.771428571428571
2421972,5,B000BKDO0C,Excellent!  Have traveled many of the areas shown here and it give a whole new perspective on the geology of these areas.,1410739200,,121,4.5
2421973,4,B000BKDO0C,"I was born in Missoula, so it has a special interest for me, but if you are at all interested in geology, you need to check out this show.  This is fascinating!",1408233600,,160,4.0
2421974,5,B000BKDO0C,Very good take on the topography of Eastern Washington  and the Columbia river Gorge.,1404345600,,85,5.071428571428571
2421975,5,B000BKDO0C,"I am obsessed with the ice age in the Pacific NW and it's effects on Washington State. The DVD could be more detailed and show more of the scab lands and geological effects from Missoula, MT to the Pacific Ocean.",1402790400,,212,4.325
2421976,5,B000BKDO0C,"If you live in WA state and haven't seen this, you should. It's incredible, and it will change the way you view the Scablands forever. I am no scientist, but I was enthralled by this reenactment of scientific history, and everything makes so much sense when I drive east. Watch it, you won't be sorry.",1397952000,,301,4.490909090909091
2421977,5,B000BKDO0C,This documentary on Glacial Lake Missoula is extremely educational and gives an outstanding overview with empirical data of the pre-history of this lake which existed in the western part Montana and northern Idaho regions.  This well documented DVD is a must to view for all of my house guests who come to the western Montana region.  I recommend this DVD to everyone.  RDM,1394150400,,373,4.888888888888889
2421978,5,B000BKDO0C,Great book.  Love the history and story of the megaflood which affected the area where I live.  I am sharing it with my friends.,1385769600,,128,4.291666666666667
2421989,4,B000BKDO0C,"'Mystery of the Megaflood' features a geologist and his bold theory that explained strange land formations in eastern Washington State. His peers had believed that, like the Grand Canyon etc., these features had been carved out over eons; J. Harlen Bretz, however, became convinced that instead they were the result of an enormous flood. The 'hole' in his theory was an inability to explain how this happened.

Then came Joseph Pardee, who became convinced the answer came from the breaching of an enormous lake created by a glacial dam. Then, just recently, another scientist in Iceland explained how such a dam could suddenly collapse.",1376611200,,637,5.125
2421990,4,B000BKDO0C,"I teach this stuff, and this dvd made my presentation more understanding and brought geology to life for my ninth graders.",1374624000,,122,4.857142857142857
2421991,5,B000BKDO0C,"I reciently bought property near here, and this video explains a lot. It really is interesting how this area evolved.",1364169600,,117,4.9
2421992,4,B000BKDO0C,"The story in itself is fascinating. The Scab Lands (that is, the aftereffects) of this flood are on par with the Grand Canyon.
The only drawback is the presentation. For me, the music was too loud and more in keeping with heavy metal; the flood animation was used too many times (as if we had ADD). However, it is well worth the watch - and a visit to Washington State to see it
live is even better!",1363737600,2,399,4.194805194805195
2421993,5,B000BKDO0C,This is one of my favorite Nova shows.  It goes into detail about the Channeled Scablands areas of Washington State and talks about J Harlan Bretz and his revolutionary ideas about how these features were formed.  I've been living in the area of the Scablands for some years now and am constantly astonished by the incredible features.  This is probably the best overview of the whole Glacial Lake Missoula saga available anywhere in any format.  Highly suggested!,1362700800,,464,4.987012987012987
2421994,5,B000BKDO0C,"Excellent!  This DVD explores the formation of the Scablands in Eastern Washington.  Sounds ho-hum, right?  No so!  Using amazing photography and cool computer models this NOVA presentation appeals to a wide audience and vividly describes the events that formed the bizzare features that puzzled geologist for decades...until J. Harlen Bretz put forth a controversial theory. I bought this DVD to help with an undergraduate geology project and then bought two more as gifts for non-scientist friends.",1342396800,2,500,5.5394736842105265
2421995,5,B000BKDO0C,"I have always enjoyed the PBS series NOVA. I also enjoy finding out about a great mystery, especially about Geology. This DVD doesn't disappoint. There is a huge canyon that starts in Montana, goes through Idaho and ends up going through the Pacific ocean end of Washington State.
The author, a respected Geologist, knew that this wierd place was not ordinary.  His research on this mystery lasted many years. Many geologists disagreed with his theories. Finally the proof was irrefutable. Alt was hailed. Many geologists studied this incredible formation. It turned out that floods went through these lands thousands of times during the ice ages. The formations are unique to our planet.
The DVD is well made and the explainations are great. What an incredible exciting story!!
Anyone will enjoy this video.",1322870400,3,808,5.121212121212121
2421996,5,B000BKDO0C,"I didn't know much about the bizarre landscape found in Eastern Washington state but am glad I sought to learn more!  This DVD presentation by NOVA offers an excellent explanation for the odd ripples, misplaced boulders, dry waterfalls and deep sediment found in the area.

For many years geologist assumed the landscape was created over the eons by repeating floods, wind, erosion, etc... However, a new theory by Harlen Bretz in the 1920s insisted that a massive cataclysmic flood must have occurred in order to create the landscape features found.

The DVD shows CGI presentations that recreate a massive flood formed by a failed ice dam over Montana, and how a massive wall of water swept through the valley suddenly.  The film has many landscape shots of the area and shows how evidence of a massive flood (or possibly several floods) is still evident.  I highly recommend this documentary film - it's very well done.",1291766400,5,922,4.922580645161291
2421997,5,B000BKDO0C,"I grew up in Eastern Washington near Rock Lake, always used to view the channeled scablands as just part of life.  To get an idea of how significant is their existence as a part of the geology of the area is amazing.  I always thought of the crags and rocks as just barren ground that was kind of ugly.  Now I appreciate the history and phenomenon that created it and enjoy just sitting there and looking around in awe.",1241827200,,419,4.2784810126582276
2421998,5,B000BKDO0C,"NOVA at its very best deals with a scientific investigation by telling fascinating stories with pictures. This film is a superb example. We learn that during the last ice age, an ice dam half a mile high blocked a valley in Montana, creating an enormous lake behind it. Then, for reasons explained in the film, the dam suddenly collapsed, releasing a towering wall of water that pushed along everything in its way. The theory is nicely explained with a combination of footage from actual geological sites and animation that shows how these sites probably came to be. And then we learn this happened not once, but many times, as Earth went through extreme periods of warming and cooling long before humans arrived on the scene.

  Any would-be documentarian should study this film (and others like it) to learn how to get beyond tedious interviews and uninspiring B-roll footage to a truly exciting way to present nonfiction on video.",1232928000,10,933,4.8924050632911396

8087968,1,B000BKDO0C,"I found this to be a very poor presentation of a remarkable geological event. Rather than being presented in a scientific like way, targeted at a mature audience, much of it was cartoon like and noisy like a video game. If this is any indication, the quality of NOVA programing has fallen significantly.",1482537600,2,303,4.735849056603773
