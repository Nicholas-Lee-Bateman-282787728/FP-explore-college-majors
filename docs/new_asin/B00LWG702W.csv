8668544,5,B00LWG702W,"I WAS ALL OF 9 YEARS OLD WHEN THE DIONE QUINTUPLETS WERE BORN BUT, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE OF THAT TIME, I FOLLOWED THE STORY DAILY ON RADIO, LITTLE DREAMING THAT SOMEDAY I WOULD, YEARS LATER BE KNOWN AS THE MAN WHO WAS NUMBER ONE IN THE CHICAGO RADIO RATINGS 4 DIFFERENT TIMES, IN 4 DIFFERENT DECADES, ON 4 DIFFERENT CHICAGO RADIO STATIONS.....WCFL, WBBM, WLS-FM AND WJJD. THEN WHEN THE 1938 MOVIE ""FIVE OF A KIND"" HIT AMERICAN MOVIE SCREENS AND WHEN THERE WAS TALK THE QUINTS WERE BEING ABUSED BY WHAT THEY DID IN THE MOVIE, I WAS SHOCKED.  NOT UNTIL NOW, AS I AGAIN WATCHED THIS MOVIE IN THE YEAR 2013. DID I REALIZE THEY WERE NOT ABUSED.NO ONE WHIPPED THEM OR SLAPPED THEM, OR CUSSED THEM.  THEY WERE ALLOWED TO JUST BE THEIR FIVE YEAR OLD SWEET, DARLING  SELVES, AND THEY DID SO, BEAUTIFULLY.  THEY HAVE A DELIGHTFUL 5TH BIRTHDAY PARTY AND THEY SING AND DANCE, AND THEY ARE CUTE AS SWEET LITTLE CHILDREN ARE.  KINDLY JEAN HERSHOLT PLAYS DR. DAFOE, WHO DELIVERED THE QUINTS AND HE,AS HE ALWAYS WAS, IS A DELIGHT.  YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS, BUT HE PROBABLY IS THE FIRST MOVIE STAR TO APPEAR (IN THE MOVIES) ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.  BEING A MOVIE, OF COURSE THERE HAS TO BE A LOVE STORY AND CLAIRE TREVOR AND CESAR ROMERO SUPPLY IT VERY NICELY. TO KEEP THIS LESS VERBOSE, JUST LET ME SAY I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED SEEING AGAIN THIS COMPLETELY CHARMING 1930'S HOLLYWOOD FILM, AND I MUST ADD IT TO MY DVD COLLECTION.",1373068800,5,1404,4.439688715953308
