1239830,5,B00000K1VZ,"If you are a beginner and need the basic steps broken down for you, this video is the one you need.  Every step is shown very clearly from the leader and follower positions. I was an absolute beginner before I bought  this video and I was able to do 7 of the 11 steps in the first three hours  of receiving the video! Julie and Chris are incredible.",959040000,11,349,4.102941176470588
1239831,5,B00000K1VZ,"THIS IS THE BEST SWING INSTRUCTIONAL EVER!  To be honest, I have purchased other swing videos to try to learn the moves and this is the first one that actually gave me the confidence to go out and try the lindy  hop in public.  Not only can I thank this video for teaching me how to  swing but after I strutted my stuff at a club, I got a date out of it!  When will you have another video?  This has great music too.  Thanks  Julee and Chris!  I feel like i know you now!",952300800,37,471,3.873684210526316
1239832,5,B00000K1VZ,"Let's just say that it's about time someone put together an instructional video you can actually follow and learn from and then replicate in a public environment with confidence.  Guys, you're nervous for maybe 30  seconds...then watch out.  Wait till you see the expression on your  friends' faces when you walk THEIR dates out onto the dance floor and look  so smooth.
An Introduction to 6-Count Swing is a simplified, easy to  follow format on learning the basics of swing.  The video is an excellent  approach for those who are dancing inclined and perhaps more importantly,  those who leave much to be desired (myself!).  The enthusiasm of the  instructors is great and the ""live"" music made it easy to watch  over and over again.  Thanks Julee and Chris!",949881600,55,760,4.84375
1239833,2,B00000K1VZ,A very perky couple moves you through the dance steps. However the material covered was covered a bit too fast for my level of ability. Also problematic was that the rear close-up shots of the male dancer are often  obscured by his pants being too long and draging on the floor.,1171324800,4,278,4.450980392156863
1239834,4,B00000K1VZ,"Has all the right steps and moves, but the instructions are a little slow. They even talk slow.",1170720000,2,95,4.333333333333333
1239835,4,B00000K1VZ,"I agree with some reviewers that there's not much to look at when you first start up the DVD.  The 2 dancers stand very placidly in front of a small band and talk very placidly about swing.  Put me off a bit, like I bought a big dud of a video.  But once you begin dancing with them, you realize how well they're instructing you and how well-paced the whole thing is.  If it were any faster or jazzier, it would be too much for a beginning student (like me) and not clear enough.  The 2 instructors do a great job of slowly leading you through the footwork, some of which can be tricky for newbies.  No, don't expect a swing ""extravaganza""; but DO expect a well-instructed video that gets the job done, namely to get you swing dancing.",1166054400,12,735,4.251798561151079
1239836,5,B00000K1VZ,"Julee Mertz is, hands down, one of the best swing dance instructors in the US.  No kidding.  We are serious.  We hosted Julee with the famous Bill Borgida, formerly from Ithaca, NY at our dance scene several years ago.  Our students loved them (and we love them too)!  This DVD is great.  -  John & Sandra Tomeny, Upper Valley Swing Dance Network",1160524800,6,346,4.483870967741935
1239837,5,B00000K1VZ,"This is by far the best introduction to dance dvd I've seen and I have seen quite a few. Chris and his partner really knows how to break down swing and make every move really easy to follow. He goes over hand movement/position as well as body and feet position. If anything negative is to be said about it, I would say this video is too slow 'cus I'm a fast learner. But otherwise, it's great! I would definitely recommend to someone else.",1157846400,7,439,4.301204819277109
1239838,4,B00000K1VZ,"You want to jitterbug. The music gets your toes tapping. Everyone that jitterbugs looks like they are having so much fun.

This video does not overwhelm you. The instruction is easy to follow. It is given with personality. It breaks things into lessons that makes sense.  Within minutes you'll be out of your chair and moving to swing music. Before long you and your partner will have learned how to turn and release. Now you just need to buy some old Bill Haley and the Comets records!",1140825600,11,486,4.574712643678161
1239839,5,B00000K1VZ,A really good introduction for beginners who are too shy to actually take real dancing lessons. Go for it !,1128470400,10,107,4.4
1239840,5,B00000K1VZ,"This is the best video I've used for learning how to dance. I learned more from it than by taking dance classes, including private lessons. My dance partner was an ultra beginner, but he learned enough in three practice sessions to dance well when we went out. We even had another couple tell us what good dancers we were, and this was our first time out dancing together! The video does an excellent job at teaching how to lead and follow, and it shows exactly how to place your body, feet, hands, arms, etc., to execute each move. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to dance.",1127952000,18,597,4.387387387387387
1239841,5,B00000K1VZ,"This dvd is so detailed, even we dance-disabled can learn. I always had a terrible time figuring out what it meant to follow, and now I know. Cool!!",1124236800,7,148,4.321428571428571
1239842,5,B00000K1VZ,"The whole series (though Vol 3 is confusingly called ""Introduction to Lindy Hop"" compared to 1 and 2 which reference ""Swing"") is excellent.  We thought we had the fundamentals and even intermediate points of swing pretty well off - and we did - but we got a lot of ""fine tuning"" out of this series.  Some GREAT really clearly illustrated stuff on subtle hand signalling, great camera angles to illustrate what is going on will improve your footwork, body positions and your leading and following.  We also got some new moves which on the East Coast USA were new to folks around here and expanded our repertoire.

If you are beginners - this series is probably the best illustrated and paced we have seen.  If you can't get an instructor locally then this is a good start and will get you putting on a great swing routine pretty quickly.

The series of DVD's really build on the previous ones - so take them in order, p[ush back the furniture and dance with your DVD remote in your hand.  They really lend to track back and slow motion play if you want to see what is going on!",1123718400,11,1076,4.431472081218274
1239843,4,B00000K1VZ,"My husband and I have 3 Swing Dance videos/DVDs.  This was the best of the three.  Chris and Julee are younger than the instructors on our other tapes so there was more energy and bounce to their steps.  Their explanations made it easy to follow their moves.  Being younger, they are also more ""politically correct"" and they refer to the dancers as ""leaders"" and ""followers"" rather than ""men"" and ""ladies.""  This was awkward and a bit annoying (I know, it's a tiny thing).  More importantly, they go slow and repeat everything many times so you aren't forced to rewind.  A live orchestra on a real dance floor adds a little glitz and is more professional than lessons done in someone's home.",1077408000,16,691,4.661157024793388
1239844,5,B00000K1VZ,"No, I'm serious... I'm as newbie, green, novice as you can get! I decided to get into swing just recently so I went out and bought quite a few different ""how to"" videos just so I don't feel COMPLETELY stupid when I take my first lesson next month.  This one takes the cake.  It's thorough, intelligent, and well done.  I recommend it highly.",1052006400,14,341,4.380952380952381
1239845,5,B00000K1VZ,"Well done.  Better emphasis on connection and ""basics"" than your typical beginning swing video.  The teachers are fun and the pacing is great.  The video teaches on a trajectory toward Lindy Hop.  Easiest to learn from if played while practicing, you'll be dancing this Friday night!",1050192000,,283,5.086956521739131
1239846,5,B00000K1VZ,"I have always wanted to learn to swing-dance, and I never thought I would actually be able to pull it off...but this tape was really great!!  Me and my partner were able to master the whole tape within 2 days of practicing, and now Im ready for intermediate!  I thought it would be hard to learn because you have to rely on the signals and touches your partner gives you.  I thought, oh great, I won't be able to know whats coming next.  But after buying and watching this tape, you just learn the motions and touches, and eventually it becomes natural.  I compare it to learning how to drive a stick-shift car.  At first it seems hard, but eventually you just do it and don't even think about it.",1016236800,8,697,4.323076923076923
1239847,5,B00000K1VZ,"My wife and I started a beginning swing dance class last week. We were hooked. The class meets once a week on Thursdays for one hour with practice afterwords. We wanted more and couldn't wait till next Thursday, We bought 4 dance video's and this is the one we watched over and over.  Chris & Julie made it look easy and the instruction was excellent!  We are ordering the second video for the Intermediate 6-Count Swing. If you are interested in learning swing dancing, save yourselves some money, this is the video to get you dancing.",997401600,40,536,4.572916666666667
1239848,5,B00000K1VZ,"This was an excellent introduction into swing dancing.  The dancers had pep and excitement, which is an improvement on most other videos.  The video goes through quiet a few moves quickly, but thats what the rewind is for.  They show you some basic spins and cross overs, as well as open and closed positions.  Fun and enternaining, even if you have had some experience swing dancing.",991440000,7,384,4.7727272727272725
1239849,5,B00000K1VZ,"Of the 22 dance instructional videos I've purchased (mostly all on swing) this is undoubtedly the finest. It is also the perfect video for the beginning swing dancer, since it provides clear, lucid and detailed instruction on steps, arm motion, leading and following. Most instructional tapes either omit such information or do a poor job of it. In fact, this is the only tape I would recommend for beginning swing dancers. We had been dancing several months, taking very good dance lessons and still derived enormous benefit from this tape. This tape provides a critically important instruction in proper leading and following useful both to the novice and bronze-level dancer. As a first tape to watch, it provides the skills necessary to be able to derive benefit from other instructional tapes. It also teaches enough steps for your to effectively swing your heart out on the dance floor -- I've been impressing even the instructors where I take my dance lessons!",980553600,122,967,5.012422360248447
1239850,5,B00000K1VZ,"At first I wasn't sure about video-dance-lessons at all, and this one in particular (looking at the funny cover.) Now, however, I am not only grateful for the wonderful pace, great instructors, and enjoyable style, I  also wish they could teach everything this well. This is a must-have for  anyone wanting to learn swing, even if you've never danced a day in your  life (such as myself prior to this video.)",963360000,,408,4.71830985915493
1239851,5,B00000K1VZ,"This tape incorporates sound learning principles and clear instructions.  Not only that, it's a blast!  Thanks Guys.",959212800,9,116,5.764705882352941
1239852,5,B00000K1VZ,Something I never thought I would want to do (dance) was made understandable for someone with no prior lessons. I Hope there will be a follow up soon!  Thanks,959126400,5,158,4.448275862068965
7914027,3,B00000K1VZ,it wasn't what I expected.  But I can appreciate and work with it,1517443200,,65,4.0

7914029,5,B00000K1VZ,"If you take video dance lessons,  you can play it again until you get it,  even if it takes six repeats.
Only your wife will know what a slow learner you are.  (Oops, now the cat's out of the bag!)",1445212800,,197,3.875
7914030,4,B00000K1VZ,I like this video.  I have no idea what type of swing it is but it starts slow has lots of details. I goes over the leader/follower  alot but I guess that is swing dance. I just wanted some basic moves to put in a zumba fitness song. Which I found.,1282176000,,248,3.843137254901961
7914031,5,B00000K1VZ,This looks like a lot of fun.  I want to get into this kind of dance more but not enough room in my living room!,1239235200,,112,3.48
7914032,5,B00000K1VZ,I  also have to say this is the best Swing dance video I Have seen. I took dance classes before these people in the video probably were Born. But These instructors know there stuff and I learned a lot and plan on getting their other videos. I especially liked how Chris Yee and Julee Mertz showed how-to  of the basics of leading and following.,1234828800,,344,4.359375
7914033,2,B00000K1VZ,"If you're a true beginner you might get something out of this DVD, but if you have had any dance experience it is a complete waste of time. I put the DVD on fast forward to go through the steps, and it was still too slow and basic. Truly a DVD for beginners with no dance experience.",1208044800,,283,3.982456140350877
7914034,5,B00000K1VZ,"I don't usually write reviews of products I buy, but I do read other reviews and base my buying decisions on those reviews.  I was so impressed with this DVD, I felt I needed to say so here, so others considering it would know how good it is.

My husband and I are in our early fifties and never really learned to dance, so we signed up for a community education class in ballroom dancing.  We learned the steps to many of the dances, but were not taught how to lead or follow.  This DVD covers the signals for leading and following in detail.  I didn't know how simple it could be.

What this DVD teaches you in leading and following can be applied to any ballroom dancing, not just swing.  That alone is worth the price!",1191715200,4,722,4.226277372262774
7914035,4,B00000K1VZ,"Excellent but not quit what I expected would reccommend this, I plan to later buy the second DVD in the series",1186876800,,110,4.285714285714286
7914036,5,B00000K1VZ,"Great product. I bought this video to supplement my group dance lessons and it was an incredible assistance in helping me practice my steps at home. I also shared it with my friend who has never taken a lesson and she found it very easy to understand and follow along. This video will teach you all of the basic moves to be able to get yourself out there on the dance floor. I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in learning more about swing dancing whether they are taking lessons or not. Plus, Julee is a Doll !",1178496000,,534,4.297029702970297
