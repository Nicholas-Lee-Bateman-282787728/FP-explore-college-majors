2033997,4,B0001WTVO8,"A throwback to the seventies but I liked it. The guy and his gal could have used a gun but hey it modern Australia where if two or more jump you, you lose they win by default. And that's what happens. But at the end somehow he gets them one at a time and beats them at their game which I found gratifying. The other reviews talk of a set? But this was a stand alone film. You may not like it, it is violent and gory but it's Australian and I have a soft spot for those folks down under and hope one day they'll wake up and get their guns back.",1505952000,,543,3.814159292035398
2033998,1,B0001WTVO8,"Dean (Dean Kirkright) and Claire (Kahli Williams) head out for a weekend only to become the toys and captives of some small town yokels who have the proverbial remote junkyard.

The film opens with a back and white rape as if it was shot from a head cam. Why? I don't know. Nothing else is found footage, which is a good thing, but doesn't prevent this Redbox offering from being a complete disaster. I was really bored having to listen an entire song while they drove the country side without talking. Doesn't add anything to the genre.

Guide: F-word. Rape. No nudity.",1504137600,4,570,4.578431372549019
2033999,3,B0001WTVO8,Blood hunt was a decent film; the other three films were horrible.,1477785600,,66,4.583333333333333
2034000,3,B0001WTVO8,"I picked up this DVD set because it contained 'Demon Under Glass', a movie which stars Garett Maggart of 'The Sentinel' fame. I've been a fan of cheesy, low-budget sci-fi and horror movies for years, so it wasn't really a stretch for me either way.

This set is worth the listed price basically for two of the four movies contained in the two discs: 'Demon Under Glass', and 'How To Slay A Vampire'. Both are very cheaply produced, but shine despite their limitations. In 'Demon Under Glass', what seems to begin as a typical 'let's catch the vampire killer' story, becomes an exploration of humanity and the differences between good and evil. It asks the question: what would happen if a group of scientists captured a real vampire? The topic is painted less in black and white than in shades of grey. It also takes a scientific rather than supernatural approach to vampirism, which is something that is rarely done, and even more rarely done well. 'Demon Under Glass' pulls it off, and I like that it dares to be different. The acting, particularly that of the lead actors, gets no complaints from me.

'How To Slay A Vampire', on the other hand, is a great movie because it knows how bad it is. Everything that could be bad about this movie is bad, and somehow, it works! And it makes for great comedy. It breaks the dramatic 'fourth wall' as often as possible, just for laughs. The movie is gag after hilarious gag, and it's become an instant favourite of mine. If you enjoy crude humour, this movie's for you.

To the other two movies I can't be as kind. 'Blood Slaves of the Vampire Wolf' was just bad. It was apparently filmed using nothing but a hand-held video camera, which makes the audio very hard to hear. Even when you turn the volume up, you get more white noise than dialogue. This doesn't help an already bland plot. You might get a few chuckles out of the lead actor and the horrible makeup, but as a whole, it looks like something cranked out by a high school A/V club. I watched this movie third, after 'How to slay...' and 'Demon...', and after that I couldn't really get into the fourth film, 'Sorority House Vampires From Hell'.

So like I said, 'Demon Under Glass', and 'How To Slay A Vampire' are worth the full price of the DVD set. Just ignore those other two, or watch them to form your own opinion.",1112054400,3,2327,4.494089834515367
8016963,4,B0001WTVO8,"Not the best revenge movie I've seen but, it was definitely obtained. Sure they didn't do things the ""correct"" way but, who would when thrown into totally surreal, violent situations? Anyone can sit back and pick a movie to pieces. I'm happy with being interested, entertained, (whether it creeps me out or not), wondering, and not thinking about it being a movie set. Not bad acting for most of them. I almost always love sweet revenge lol.",1519257600,,441,4.740259740259741
8016964,2,B0001WTVO8,"I swear, it's really annoying that virtually EVERY person in a horror/thriller, become dumb like a rock. But hey, a rock would have been a choice weapon here. Why, after the boyfriend beats the three jerks down and gets away, didn't he drive (in a overheating car) to one of the dozens of surrounding farmhouses for help? OK, moving on. (Sort of spoiler alert): When boyfriend is hung upside down, drenched in gasoline and girl escapes, WHY doesn't she cut him down while all three jerks disperse to find her, instead of locking herself into a junked car as they surround her? This kind of stupidity makes it difficult to cheer for the victims, but easy to just find something better to waste time watching...",1518825600,,709,4.68
8016965,4,B0001WTVO8,"This movie starts out with a first person view of a rape from the victims perspective. This Australian flick is like a lot of others (Killing Ground, Lake Eden) where a couple is out on vacation, run afoul of a creepy/menacing local, run into said local later down the road, tormented/killed by local/group of locals, one of the two survives and kills everyone else. That being said, I still enjoyed the movie. It was fast paced, well acted, and I didn't look at my phone once. The lead actress was tooooooo fine, the blood was abundant and entertaining, my one minor complaint was the end, like the very end. The cover has some weird guy in a mask, which is not part of the movie. I probably won't see this movie again unless I put it on without realizing Id seen it before.",1518825600,,775,4.426573426573427
8016966,4,B0001WTVO8,Excellent second half.  First half very good.  (I am not Jennifer.  I am 'spoken' from the now-dead IMDb boards.),1514246400,,113,4.842105263157895
8016967,5,B0001WTVO8,This was a movie that made me angry it was so good. Very realistic and a messed up situation to be in. Made my skin crawl. If you're debating on watching this I'd say go for it.,1514073600,,177,3.810810810810811
8016968,5,B0001WTVO8,"Great ending, riveting, glued to the show, now only going to get a few hours of sleep before the alarm clock rings.",1511222400,,115,4.2727272727272725
8016969,5,B0001WTVO8,"So much better than the US low budget movies , We always prefer the Aussie movies as they are more real
to life , I don't know what space cadets give this movie a 2 star when they 5 star the worst US movies
that are so unbelievable and not even worth watching ! Blood Hunt is not the best movie but well worth watching .",1509580800,,320,3.8636363636363638
8016970,4,B0001WTVO8,good revenge movie - took awhile to get to the revenge but all in all not bad for a this type movie which my rating reflects,1508976000,,124,3.8076923076923075
8016971,5,B0001WTVO8,aww come on more than a 3 people gezz,1508889600,,37,3.2222222222222223
8016972,4,B0001WTVO8,"I love some of these Australian horror flicks.  My kind of movie.  A little slow in the first half, but I chalk that up to character development of the couple which pays off in the end.  The second half is when the terror or torture starts.  Wish there were more movies like this. I'm so tired of paranormal ghost stories, haunted houses and predictable slashers.",1507334400,2,363,4.538461538461538
