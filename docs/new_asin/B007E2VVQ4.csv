8515077,4,B007E2VVQ4,Has very good drills and helped me as a new PE teacher to earn some basics to teach the students.  Very Good.,1454889600,,109,3.9545454545454546

8515080,2,B007E2VVQ4,"Disappointed in this video.  I expected more on the rules and strategy of the game and that was not covered at all.  This is basically a video on basketball drills, not how to play the game.",1392681600,3,190,4.25
8515081,5,B007E2VVQ4,This video was one of the best we have seen. So good in fact that we will watch it again.,1388361600,2,89,3.5
8515082,4,B007E2VVQ4,"The video is generally good on dribbling, passing, cutting.  It would be a great video if they included a few basics on shooting.

The quality is good.  The setting is on a driveway, which at first seems odd.  But given the drills are intended to be things you can do on  a driveway or backyard court it is actually the perfect setting.  The young players/actors are engaging and the voice over is good quality.

The video would be a great help to someone who is coaching a youth team.",1372896000,3,485,4.382022471910112
8515083,4,B007E2VVQ4,"We all know that fundamentals and desire in most sports
can win out over talent. In BASKETBALL FUNDAMENTALS we
are taught the basics the correct way. There is too much content to comment on it all.
The ball handling routines seem quite elementary but have value.
The ""hesitation"" and ""cross over"" dribble are explained in detail.
The ""V"" cut and ""L"" cut are shown in slow motion and explained correctly.
I could have done without the driveway setting but let's face it, we all don't have
access every day to an indoor gym. With all this ""Linsnity"" going on, it is refreshing to
see the pick and roll explained and run correctly.
Young players can watch this and practice what they see.
It is more than just ""going up on your inside foot for a lay-up.""
This program works well and I recommend it to anyone who has
ever picked up a basketball.",1330473600,3,841,4.503267973856209
