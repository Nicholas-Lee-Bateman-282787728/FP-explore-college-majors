2509483,3,B000E8LQWY,"My son does like to watch this video (although not his favorite from this company), but I thought the exercise part of the video would actually be a little more strenuous and help on rainy and cold days that we have to stay indoors. The actor in the video is hardly in shape and puts little effort into the moves. The video itself is a good idea as far as exercising while learning letters, but the actors voice is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANNOYING!!! I have a very high tolerance, and Barney doesn't even bother me one bit if that tells you anything, but I really can't stand listening to this video. This company does make several other alphabet videos and I should have chosen another one. I just thought an exercise video for kids was a great idea, although there isn't much real exercise involved. They could have made this an AWESOME video! We LOVE the Rock N Learn collection and have close to 7 or 8 videos. I stand by this company and will definately continue to buy their videos.",1188086400,5,984,4.5027932960893855
2509493,5,B000E8LQWY,"This video is definitely aimed toward preschool age, however, all 3 of my kids, ages 10, 7 and 4, love it!  It's a great way to get them moving on a rainy day stuck indoors.",1446595200,,173,3.942857142857143
2509494,4,B000E8LQWY,"Just adorable! My daughter watched this at school, came home singing the letter ""K"". I had to ask her teacher where it was from....this video is not just alphabet but movement as well. Very fun!",1439596800,,194,4.571428571428571
2509495,1,B000E8LQWY,My daughter loves exercise videos and didn't even finish 1/3 of this. Pretty cheesy - even for a 3 year old!,1436400000,,108,4.190476190476191
2509496,3,B000E8LQWY,Hokey.  The little kids liked it :),1435363200,,35,4.0
2509497,5,B000E8LQWY,This is a great DVD for children learning the alphabet and children that can't sit still.  Children get to move and mimic the host.  I've used this DVD with kindergarten level kids and they loved it!,1426204800,,199,4.5
2509498,1,B000E8LQWY,This is terribly annoying. Our daughter is 2.5 and normally loves to sing and dance but even she got bored with this. I'm glad I only rented it on prime and didn't spend anymore to buy it.,1422403200,,188,4.108108108108108
2509499,1,B000E8LQWY,Ugh. My son was so embarrassed by the hokiness of this video that he didn't want to do it. He didn't even make it through the first exercise. I felt bad for him. The production values were so low and the lead character so bizarre that I couldn't argue my son's point. Yikes.,1419724800,,274,4.188679245283019

2509501,2,B000E8LQWY,"This video was super weird, boring, and super weird. Very slow paced, repetitive, and did not encourage much exercise in my opinion. The alphabet was broken into 2 halves with a break or rest in the middle... I guess you are supposed to stop after half of the letters and pick it up another time? My 3 year old son participated while I did the exercises with him, but wanted to quit (so did I) and never asked about it again.",1409097600,,425,4.2592592592592595
2509502,5,B000E8LQWY,My Kids love these DVD's. We have almost all of them and they are watching and learning allot.,1408579200,,94,4.277777777777778
2509511,4,B000E8LQWY,We have enjoyed the video.  Great morning starter.,1408406400,,50,5.25
2509512,5,B000E8LQWY,his alphabet actively using this video. i hated it though--burned my ears. but the most important thing is that now my 5-year-old can read everything i'm typing right now as he shares my chair with me. i actually bought this video as a present for a cousin who just had a baby. it really works.,1399852800,,294,4.363636363636363
2509513,1,B000E8LQWY,"Not much of an exercise video. The range of movements the video has are in line with things my daughter does on her own. The songs are nonsense, just random words. Like others have said, my child was bored after only a few minutes",1393027200,,230,4.25
2509514,2,B000E8LQWY,"If you liked it when the munchkins on the Wizard of Oz came out to sing their lollipop guild song then you'll like this stuff. Low quality, annoying, cheesy, cheap, etc etc. There IS a positive though - the content is actually not terrible. Its just the dude (what kind of circus announcer costume is that?), his voice, the annoying music and slightly mind-controlling background scenes.  I want my 1.99 back.",1391299200,,409,4.76056338028169
2509515,1,B000E8LQWY,"I take full time care of my 2 1/2 year old grandchild and have bought/rented dozens of educational videos. I can wholeheartedly say this is the worst thing I have ever watched. I agree with the review  that said this guy must have made it in his basement. Terrible background, ""music"", movements and voice.
Most monotonous thing I have ever seen.",1390521600,,346,4.672131147540983
2509516,2,B000E8LQWY,"My children was bored after 3 minutes. I did the video with them and I lost interest also. My children are  two and seven and will dance to almost anything, but not this video. They thought it was just a slow video..",1382572800,,216,4.142857142857143
2509517,5,B000E8LQWY,"I would give it one star because I can't stand it, mostly because all of the songs are always stuck in my head, but my 2 1/2 year old son LOVES this and watches it at least once a day.  He exercises to it and even does all the same motions that Alphabet Al does when presenting the letters.  He also loves to trace the letters at the end with his finger on the tv (resulting in me having to buy electronic wipes for sticky finger marks on our tv).  He now knows all of his capital letters and lower case letters as a result of frequent viewing.",1381104000,,544,4.018518518518518
2509518,3,B000E8LQWY,This is a cute DVD but did not hold my 3 and 5 year old attention. As a teacher I plan on using it on a rainy day with my transitional kindergarteners (4 year old). Hopefully they will enjoy it.,1380844800,,194,3.875
2509519,1,B000E8LQWY,This was an annoying video. This is probably not a good product for a two year old. I would not buy Rock N Learn videos again.,1372118400,,126,3.8846153846153846
2509520,5,B000E8LQWY,my kids love doing the exercises along with the guy in the purple.  I am very pleased with this purchase,1371427200,,104,4.2
2509531,5,B000E8LQWY,"I love rock 'n learn series!
My kids have a great time whenever we play it for them.
Great colors and songs.",1370390400,,108,3.9545454545454546
2509532,5,B000E8LQWY,My son is 6 and my daughter is 3 and they both got to do the exercises. I rented it to try it out but I'll probably buy it because it was a great video.,1368921600,,152,3.3714285714285714
2509533,3,B000E8LQWY,The video was ok. Same guy did almost all the letters which became kind of monotonous.  For exercise value it works well.,1367712000,,121,4.5
2509534,5,B000E8LQWY,"I work with preschoolers.  We needed something to help us burn off steam in the winter months.  I borrowed this from the library not knowing then that the children would love it!!!  I ended up buying a copy.  We now begin each morning with this video exercising. This video is not only good for their bodies but it is also good for their minds.  It reinforces the alphabet and words that begin with each letter.  I must say as an adult, the main characters voice was annoying in the beginning but the children loved it so much that I quickly got used to it.",1367193600,,557,4.3076923076923075
2509535,5,B000E8LQWY,"I purchased these for my twin nieces and they love these DVDs.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Entertaining and instructive, it is a good investment in my opinion.",1366848000,,176,5.0344827586206895
2509536,5,B000E8LQWY,"Excellent!!! Not only kids are learning, but they are moving and getting their work out! They guy is a little weird in his accent, i have to admit, but after the second time you watch it, you get used to it. Even grandma enjoyed doing some of the letter s exercise!! She said she would try it with her senior friends as a routine for warm up.",1366675200,,342,4.119402985074627
2509537,3,B000E8LQWY,"As a parent, this makes me want to bang my head off a wall...its so annoying. But, my 3.5 year old likes it. She does the exercises with him.",1363132800,,141,3.896551724137931
2509538,1,B000E8LQWY,"I got this for my 5yr old after he saw me exercising- cool!- learning and exercise. Well, this goes one letter at a time with simple, almost home made, backgrounds and song, along w/ moves that, aren't exercise per say, but do have movement. Perhaps torturous only to the adult, the video and song seems to last....forever. My son stepped away a few times, but did make it to V. Sadly, with a million other videos more engaging out there, I would not recommend this one.",1362441600,,470,4.476744186046512
2509539,5,B000E8LQWY,"So, this is pretty silly and a little weird for an adult, but my son (3.5 years old) LOVES it. This is the third exercise video I tried with him to give us something active to do during the winter when it is cold and dark after school. We do it together. The first two he would only half-heartedly participate in, and argue with me when I would start them up. This one, though, by the letter D for Dance, he was participating the first time we played it, and by letter E for Eagle, he was way into it. He loves this bizarre dude, and the kids who will flash through (we sometimes give them names of kids he knows from school). He loves that he knows the letters and which will come next and what it stands for in the video, and interjecting other trivia he knows about each letter as we exercise. As for people who complain about the level of exercise, I would say that this is not Insanity or P90X, for sure, but comparing it to my son sitting on the couch/floor (or even running around like a maniac), it seems to give him some varied exercise over his different body parts--enough that he welcomes the break at ""N for nap"" and the sleep at the end for Zzzzz. He is pretty young, of course, and will probably grow out of this level of exercise, but if you have a young child, I would recommend giving this a try.",1361577600,,1314,4.177165354330708
2509540,1,B000E8LQWY,"Worst money I ever spent.  This guy must have made this video in his basement.  Quality is poor.  Not really much exercise.  Hoped my 2 year old would warm up to it and get into it, but the creepy guy freaked him out.",1358812800,,217,3.9767441860465116
2509571,5,B000E8LQWY,This company has really helped me to reiterate what I teach my kids and keeps their minds working I couldn't recommend more,1353024000,,123,4.636363636363637
2509572,5,B000E8LQWY,"My seven year old daughter knows her alphabet very well and reads at a sixth grade level, but she absolutely adored this video. The exercises are effective and fun, and the gentleman who leads them has an infectious personality. I am very happy that we purchased this video and highly recommend it. As a side note, I'm sure this video would be doubly effective for children who need the ""p is for pick"" aspect.",1341878400,,410,4.554054054054054
2509573,5,B000E8LQWY,This is the best in the series...The children love to move around and follow AL....Great teaching tool for learning ABC'S.  It is a lot of fun!!,1328486400,,144,4.538461538461538
2509574,5,B000E8LQWY,"I didn't know if the kids would like this at first. Alphabet Al is kind of odd, but once one of the kids liked it, the others did too. The 2 yr old asks to watch ""exercise"" whenever it's her turn to choose a movie. She stands in front of the tv and follows along. I think it is also helping with letter recognition.",1323993600,,315,3.9375
2509575,5,B000E8LQWY,"I am very impressed by the entire collection of Rock 'N Learn DVD's. Alphabet exercise is very child oriented and inviting. It allows the children to interact with the show and physically gets them active.

I reccomend that the first few times you watch it you participate so they understand that it's ok to interact. After that you will see just putting the DVD in will have them busy all on their own.

I run a daycare and the children rant and rave that they want this video.

Great purchase and look forward to completing the series!!!",1315008000,,539,4.536082474226804
2509576,2,B000E8LQWY,"This DVD is awful! Do not waste your money. Whoever created it doesn't know much about children. I have two kids and babysit two kids. Their ages range from 18 mos.to 5 years old. None of the kids liked it. They would not watch it past the letter C! The music is bad, the exercises are mostly silly & useless and the guy in it is strange & creepy. His voice is actually very annoying. There's nothing fun or catchy about this DVD.",1304726400,,430,4.192771084337349
2509577,5,B000E8LQWY,"Well this is my first review. i don't write reviews because to me everything is either ok or not worth my time. well this Rock N Learn series is way better than ok and well worth my time. i run a business from home and dad of 2 with my oldest just turned 2 years old Nov 17th and so my wife and i bought Colors, Shapes, & Counting, Letter Sounds, Alphabet Exercise, and Alphabet Circus for her to watch while i work. too my suprise she loves them. everytime 1 is done she picks the next 1 to watch. she knows her colors, shapes, can count to 20, knows her abc's, can read 2 small books she has and will try to sound out words she doesnt already know. ok some of you might think thats not a big deal it can be done yes but the big deal is she has only been watching these dvds for 3 days! her grandma just ordered some more Rock N Learn dvds for her for Christmas so i cant wait to see how she reacts to them and how my review with them will be. this series is truely awesome! to an adult it may look cheap made and things like that but if it holds them there with out blinking and they learn that makes it 110% besides if you are an adult and want to complain about how you cant watch it because of how it looks hmmmm something is wrong lol. its a childrens educational movie not Days Of Our Lives so got over it. for the learning experience for the kids and the price you cant beat it. this series is good enough i would of paid $50 a dvd. seriously i would have. if you are thinking about trying it, just do it you won't regret it i promise!",1291248000,5,1543,3.9329073482428116
2509578,4,B000E8LQWY,"Designed for children from three- to five-years-old, Rock `N Learn's unique exercise program integrates early literacy skills with physical activity. A funny gentleman named Alphabet Al guides children through 35 minutes of gentle physical activity while clad in a blue tux: complete with cummerbund, bow tie, top hat and gloves. Al introduces children to each of the capital and lower case letters in turn, providing an active movement that begins with the specific letter. L for example is lift, P is pick and T is twist. The letters appear onscreen along with the action word and related vocabulary words that begin with the letter throughout the segment.

As the letters change, the colourful, digitally generated background that Al and his exercise mat appear against shift and the music changes as well. At times Al switches off with children performing the movement, or is accompanied by computer-animated characters. A pause is provided while each new letter is introduced, allowing for a relaxed pace that will accommodate most children. Some of the letter segments encourage children to form the shapes of the letter with their bodies, an excellent reinforcement for kinesthetic learners.

Developed in conjunction with a certified fitness trainer, a variety of balanced exercises are included: stretches, light cardio, upper body, lower body, and isometric exercises are all present. A natural intermission is provided at N for nap, providing a break that can be used to divide the workout into two segments, or just a pause before resuming with letters O through Z.

Following the 35 minutes of movement an animated guide to printing the letters and numbers is quickly presented. Encouraging children to follow the onscreen movements with their finger in the air (air-writing) is absolutely the best method for imprinting proper letter formation in young learners, so I was thrilled to see this included. The printing segments bring the discs total run time to 44 minutes.

The delivery of the exercises is fairly standard for children's programming. Big goofy smiles, wide eyes, bright flashing colours, and squeaky voices are all par for the course. Al's voice speaks in a clear rhythm, complete with rhymes as he introduces each letter, the accompanying movement and additional vocabulary words. The accompanying music varies in style though it sounds synthetically generated throughout. It serves mainly to reinforce the tempo of Al's speech and the pace of the physical movements, never forming what one would consider a proper song.

Fully chaptered, viewers can move between segments while watching, or through the excellent navigational menu. Each of the letters is available to select on the menu to go straight to its segment. A ""Play All"" option, and buttons for the numeral printing and alphabet printing segments are also provided. The ease of menu selection makes it easy for parents and teachers to reinforce any difficult letters, and to easily focus on specific skills.

It wasn't long before my daughter started offering unprompted feedback. ""This guy is so funny mommy!"" she exclaimed when he introduced the letter A. ""Oh, this is so fun!"" was her response to the letter B, when she got to bicycle on the floor with her legs in the air. Because we use an Orton-Gillingham approach to phonics which emphasizes letter sounds over letter names, she's still unfamiliar with some of the letter names, and isn't entirely confident with the others.

Though my oldest is outside of the recommended age range, the reinforcement provided by this DVD is just what she needs. We're able to kill three birds with one stone - provide an outlet for physical activity, reinforce letter names, and help her learn proper printing technique. With my three-year-old starting to count and learn the ABC song I have great hopes that this fun-filled disc will help her along in her journey towards or recognition. Educators working with young children should certainly put Alphabet Exercise on their short list of products to look into further.",1244764800,2,4052,5.177099236641221
2509579,4,B000E8LQWY,My 3yr old is totally engrossed with this video. She interacts and sings along as if nothing else in the world matters when this video is on,1240876800,,140,4.222222222222222
2509580,3,B000E8LQWY,"I bought this DVD after falling in love with it's sister Rock n Learn Phonics I&II, despite the one review. I understand that they are trying to reach kinesthetic learners here, which is great since most toddlers and small children are kinesthetic learners to start out with, and very few have the patience or attention span to do seat work. All my kids (ages 8,7,4, 20 mo.)liked it and participated in the majority of it. The moves are not strenuous (it is perfect for my physically disabled 4yo), but its enough to keep your kid moving(for 44 minutes), which is a great thing these days with video games and the dangers of playing outside keeping most kids inside. The reviewer above me said that the exercise was too easy, given that it is for a small child audience I feel that its appropriate. I mean you wouldn't expect your 4 year old to follow Jane Fonda? The video goes through the alphabet 2 times and then a third time showing kids how to write each letter.

Pros:
*exercise and alphabet introduction in one
*reaches kinesthetic learners (most kids are till grade 3)
*easy, slow paced movements, not strenuous exercise, good for kids with disabilities (lots of arm movement)and kids without
*introduces letters with stretching and warm up, ends with a cool down
*shows other kids doing movements at different intervals
*Introduces capital and lowercase letters at he same time

Cons:
*guy can be annoying, but I can't stand Barney and this guy didn't bother me.
*not the most attention grabbing video",1212537600,,1511,4.78544061302682
