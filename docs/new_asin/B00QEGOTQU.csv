8691072,3,B00QEGOTQU,"I mistakenly rated the wrong video.  This is the one that is very high impact, which was not what I expected.",1485475200,,109,4.190476190476191
8691073,5,B00QEGOTQU,"The 40-minute cardio workout will get your heart rate up. There's about 25 minutes of active cardio followed by 10 minutes of body weight training (with a cardio factor) and then a 5-minute stretch. This is followed by a 20-minute stretch routine. The two can be done together or separately.

I love this workout. It's great for when you want solid cardio but don't have a lot of time or if you just want a thorough stretch. The added toning in the 40-minute workout (including core work) is a nice bonus. There are floor moves in the cardio routine, though modifications are offered. Plus, the floor moves add a functional element--your body moves through different planes. This helps keep me limber in my day-to-day movements, so although the moves may seem a bit foreign, they're functional in nature. But again, any moves that are uncomfortable can be modified.

This will be a great DVD to take with me when I travel--doesn't require too much space to do.",1433548800,2,960,4.74251497005988
8691074,5,B00QEGOTQU,Being doing a lot of HIIT and this is less monotonous and one of the better workouts I have found (tried a BUNCH).,1430956800,2,114,4.0
8691075,5,B00QEGOTQU,This is one of my favorite workouts.  It's never stops and you sweat your butt off. I love workouts like this because there's no time to be bored.  It keeps going from one movement to another so the dread factor is pretty much eliminated.  Truly a challenging but fun workout and one of the best parts...nothing but a towel!!,1427068800,3,325,4.47457627118644

8691077,4,B00QEGOTQU,"I love Michelle's workouts, and was excited that she put out two new Bodyfit workouts in December since they're so much fun.  This Athletic Conditioning one is a solid workout, but I did find her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bodyfit-360-Bodyweight-Dance-Conditioning-with-Michelle-Dozois/dp/B00QEGLDIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bodyfit 360 Bodyweight Dance Conditioning with Michelle Dozois</a>&nbsp;to be a lot more fun.

Like the previous reviewer, I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser, and usually do workouts by Cathe Freidrich, Tonique, Dream Body, Insanity, etc.  This workout still really challenges me, and I love how it incorporates full-body movements.

All you need to do this workout is a mat; you'll also do it with aerobics shoes on.

There are two workouts on this DVD:  a forty-minute conditioning workout and a twenty-minute stretch.  The moves include things like burpees and planks, along with quite a few new moves I'd never done before.  A few of them did feel strange, though, which is why I didn't give this review a full five stars.  I've found that in some of Michelle's newer releases, including this one, she seems to want to introduce new exercises that don't always feel safe doing quickly.

On the main menu, there is a short video where Michelle demos some of the trickier moves.  I would definitely watch this since in the workout she doesn't break down the moves, but rather moves from one exercise to the next.  Even after watching the demo, I was still confused in a few places the first time I did this workout, but it was easier to follow along the second time, once I was more familiar with what was to come.

One word of warning:  in the workout, they keep their yoga mats vertical, but the first time I did this workout, I ended up tripping over mine since the rubber soles of my shoes kept getting caught on my mat.  At one point, I tripped and almost fell headfirst into my TV, so I ended up moving my mat to a perpendicular angle, and used it to cushion my hands when I was in positions on the floor.

Overall, this is a solid workout, but just be sure to modify if any of the moves don't quite feel right with your level of flexibility.",1420588800,11,2236,4.970430107526882
8691078,5,B00QEGOTQU,"I really enjoyed this dvd, Michelle is a great instructor and I did not expect this DVD to be easy and it did not disappointment me.  It is about 5 minutes of warm up follow by about 20 minutes of Athletic moves that will really rise you heart rate up and then about 7 minutes of upper body followed by about 5 minutes of core exercise and it finishes with about 4 minutes of a cool down and then you have 20 minutes of stretches for flexibility.  I was feeling  really good when I finished the workout and I think it was pretty easy to follow, I did not finds the move hard to follow at all. Just to give you a little history of me I have done almost all dvds on the market including Tonique, Insanity, P90x, Cathe, Tracy Anderson, Barre, Dream body workout, Piyo, Jari Love and Much more thanks to the exercise above I have manage to maintain my weight and a lean  physique",1417478400,8,875,4.190476190476191
