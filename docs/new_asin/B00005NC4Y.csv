1631663,5,B00005NC4Y,"After about a thousand years, Female Trouble is finally to be released on DVD this October. I've already reserved 2 copies. Grab 'em now folks. Who knows. It might go back into moratorium again. This is truly my most favorite movie on the planet!",997574400,2,246,4.613636363636363
1631664,5,B00005NC4Y,"I have been waiting for ""Female Trouble"" to come back out on video for about a million years.  It is one of my favorite movies.  I specifically joined my video store  because they have a rental tape of it, which I rent about once a year (and they require a pretty hefty deposit on it to discourage theft).  Now to have it on DVD, AND with Pink Flamingos?  I couldn't be happier if I won the lottery!
Chronicling the life of young Dawn Davenport from early JD to death-row inmate, this demented little gem is sure to make you grin.  Shot for about a buck and a half, it has scenes that will have you doubled over laughing (the one with Divine vogueing her way down a downtown Baltimore street in front of shocked and appalled suburbanites is fall-down funny, especially because it was filmed from a passing car: they would stop at the corner, unleash Divine, film her strutting by, get her back in the car, and screech off before one of the shocked populous could call the cops).  From her fury over not getting her ""Cha Cha heels"" to her final ""Dying for art"", Divine as Dawn gives a relentless, fearless, and furiously funny performance that is well matched by everyone else in the film.  Buy this DVD right now!",997142400,3,1213,4.4324324324324325
1631665,5,B00005NC4Y,"You have NO idea how happy I am that Female Trouble is finally being released on DVD. It has to be my all time favorite cult movie ever. John Waters brings so much of his trade-mark trash to the movie that it stands-out as one of his most signature early pieces, even though he had already made movies such as Pink Flamingos, Mondo Trasho and Eat Your Make-Up. Divine definately shines in the staring role as Dawn Davenport. Tired of her common social life at home, Dawn decides that she will make her own mark on the world and does so as no other woman can! Dawn goes from a high school misfit, to a go-go dancer, a cafe waitress, a theif, a high-fashion crime model, and a serial killer, all while trying to be a loving mother to her obnoxious retarded daughter Taffy, played by another John Waters star regular Mink Stole. And let's not forget about the third star of the movie who you won't be able to forget no matter how hard you try: Edith Massey! Edith, the grotesque diva that also stars in a number of John's films, plays Aunt Ida, the aunt to Divine's worthless hairdresser husband. John gives her more of a 'glamorous' role compared to her earlier character in Pink Flamingos. In Female Trouble, just give Edith a glass of Sherry and she becomes a black spandex wearing diva who can put Olivia Newton-John to shame! While this is definately NOT a movie for everyone, it is very high on humor and camp. So, if you're a big cult classic fan, and not prudish or weak-of-stomach, this is one DVD you should NOT miss out on!",995846400,31,1531,4.413427561837456
1631666,5,B00005NC4Y,"That's right, this DVD is probably one of the greatest 2 disc sets you are ever going purchase - each of these films is easily worth a million dollars as far as entertainment value goes. John Water's 2 greatest works of celluloid art that pretty much coined the term ""TRASH CINEMA"" and gave Water's his ""Prince of Puke"" title back in the sleazey Seventies. Devine turns in Academy Award worthy performances both as the inimitable and infamous dog-poop eating Babs Johnson, Queen of All Filth, in the ground-breaking disgustoid modern classic, Pink Flamingos; and in Female Trouble, as the completely over-the-top obese she-devil derelict, Dawn Davenport, unhinged on a furious crimespree rampage that easily gives Flamingos a run for it's money in the depraved and disgusting departments. Not only do you get Devine, but each of these film gems also stars the wonderful Edith Massey, appearing in both of these films also in unforgettable roles that only she could play - what a presence! I can't imagine  a better set piece than pairing these two films together - the absolute pinnacle of classic trash entertainment that will live forever...I'd give them each 6 stars if I could! Thank You Mr. Waters, you have helped make the world more fun.",995068800,9,1244,4.952153110047847
1631667,4,B00005NC4Y,"Think of the worst perversions and crimes against humanity you can. No, think harder. Now assume they're all in this movie.

It's the type of movie that you don't want your mother to know you even know the name of it. The kind of movie that some uptight video store salesman will give you ""the look"" when you ask for it. It's the type of movie that makes me hope nobody I know sees this positive review.

But it's very darn funny if you can see humor in some of the worst, most disgusting and vile things John Waters can imagine.
I know I've laughed hard each and every time I've watched it.",1206662400,,591,4.221238938053097
1631668,5,B00005NC4Y,"I was introduced to John Waters during my first year at NMSU and was immediately addicted to everything Divine and John Waters! to think this stuff was allowed to make it on film during the 1970's is quite something. John Waters loves to push the envelope and not take himeslf seriously at all. This is what makes his films so insane, delicious, campy and without a doubt NUTS! Pink Flamigos is that wild tale of The Filthiest People Alive and the lives of thos who hate them with a burning jealousy. Divine stars as well, Divine the undisputed queen of all this filth since this is her title and motto. She lives in a trailer home with her retarded mother, Crackers her insane son,and Cotton the traveling blonde companion. They live blissfully together until 2 jalous perverts, Raymond and Connie Marble attempt to steal that title away. Well, this only gets worse and the end result is a totally gross out battle, a disgusting party, a burning trailer, lesbian couples seeking children to adopt and so many insane events to mention. The next film featured here is Female Trouble with Divine as Dawn Davenport, Cookie Muller, Edith Massey,Mink Stole, and the late David Lochary. The premise is not as stomach churning as the PF however, it does have its revolting moments. The story centers on a teenage Dawn Davenport who is upset when her parents failed to give her those much desire cha cha heels for XMAS!!!! As a runaway teen she has no recourse to end up pregnant (with Mink Stole as Taffy)and winding up marrying a heterosexual hairdresser from the Le Lipstick Beauty Salon where she meets the notorios owners, Mr. and Mrs. Dasher!!! these two are hell bent on getting Dawn involved in a life of crime. What is so amazing here is the imagination that it took to dream up such weird and insane stories. There never is a dull moment here folks. But I do promise that you will feel paralyzed by Joh Waters and his legendary cast of Dreamland players. This is the stuff that would wind up on tabloids and really freak you out. This is another must have in your trash cinema collection",1089763200,5,2089,4.633423180592992
1631669,5,B00005NC4Y,"These are the dirtiest... and perhaps the funniest films ever made. I first saw Pink Flamingos when I was 14 (!) and I loved it. Female Trouble is the better movie when it comes to storylines, but the outrageousness of Pink Flamingos is unforgettable. Divine's performances are terrible, yet terrific. John Waters really knew what he was doing when it came to these two cinema classics!",1089676800,3,386,4.863636363636363
1631670,2,B00005NC4Y,"I have yet to understand why Pink Flamingos is probably one of the most popular films of Mr. Waters. Personally, I do not like Pink Flamingos, but I do like Female Trouble (minus the ending-that was just stupid). I would definitely buy the Hairspray/Pecker combo over this one. It's much more enjoyable.",1073174400,,303,4.846153846153846
1631671,5,B00005NC4Y,"...and that's just one of several dozen memorable lines to be found on these two remastered DVD's from New Line Cinema, who boast on the cover that ""we are proud to recycle our trash"". And believe me, trash doesn't get any better than this.

Though these films are not pristine due to the source material, they have never looked better. The only complaint I can offer is that in several places the subtitles are incorrect on ""Female Trouble"".

Just before we see Aunt Ida and Gator, Dawn says ""I wonder if he's a chubby chaser"" and the on screen title reads ""I wonder if he's a shelley chaser (Huh?). Then, right before Dawn hacks off Aunt Ida's hand, she says ""Ida Nelson, I'm gonna chop off your scrawny little paw!"" and the subtitle reads ""I've had enough, I'm gonna chop off your scrawny little paw"".

But that's nitpicking--I only had the subtitles on during the time that I was watching the director's commentary on both movies, which were almost as enjoyable as the films themselves.

For the poor deprived person who has never had the pleasure of viewing these before, my opinion would be that although ""Trouble"" starts off a much funnier film, it loses momentum once the ""crime is beauty"" theory is introduced, which is too bad since the first half hour is brilliantly sick and perverse.

""Flamingos"" is more consistent, with Mink Stole's ""interview"" scene at the beginning being a definite highlight. She is very underrated as an actress.

If you are looking for camp humor and some harmless sleaze, this double DVD set will perfectly fit the bill and once you have this in your DVD collection you no need longer be a ""jealous pervert"".",1070841600,2,1646,4.697916666666667
1631672,5,B00005NC4Y,"As an opening disclaimer, if you are a big fan of ""Hairspray"" (in either ints movie or musical form), these films are not necessarily for you.  Even after the films of the Farrelly Brothers, MTV's ""Jackass,"" and countless other bits of media that suggest the fall of Western Civilization, ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Female Trouble"" remain the crowning gems of shock cinema.  These films have not only crossed the line of good taste; they've taken a paid vacation to a tropical island that sits 3,000 miles past the line.
""Pink Flamingos"" is the generally recognized classic.  The film features infamous scenes of feces eating, meat smuggling, and singing rectums among its accomplishments of sleeze.  Amazing, there is still a plot that involves two families vying to earn the title of ""the filthiest people alive.""  What makes the movie work amidst its vile setpieces is the sense of fun behind it all, and the strangest delivery of some of the stranges lines ever.
""Female Trouble"" is even better.  The convoluted but followable story revolves around Dawn Davenport and her lifelong attempts to become notorious, culminating in her completely insane presentation of murder as art.  All of Waters' regulars appear once again, and the film trumps the disgustingness of ""Pink Flamingos"" (even if it has nothing quite as vomit inducing as eating dog poo).
The commentaries on these discs are as great as the movie.  I'm not a big fan of commentaries, but I always take the extra effort to give John Waters' rants a listen.  Much of the info for these films may also be found in Waters' book ""Shock Value"" (which is also wonderful), but his speaking style is really infectious and captivating.",1070582400,12,1685,4.946808510638298
1631673,1,B00005NC4Y,"So, in a nutshell...don't bother wasting your time like I did.  To make a movie about bad taste and think that it will eventually become a cult is about as dumb as voting for G W Bush and thinking that he will usher in the second coming of Christ. Yeh, right!  Left or Right....there are better things to do with your time.",1070150400,,323,4.193548387096774
1631674,4,B00005NC4Y,"It is what it is, and you certainly don't have to like it(Roger Ebert sure hates Pink Flamingos, but what does he know?  He liked Star Kid).  John Waters is truly a love him or hate him guy, especially where his old films are concerned.  If you've never seen this, take my advice:  Don't watch it with anyone prudish(unless it's for revenge), watch it with a sick freaky person like yourself.  This is the kind of film that you like to watch with people to see their reactions, but you probably won't watch it alot on your own-very much like Caligula.  Remember, Waters isn't afraid to show you anything and nothing is sacred to him.  There are at least two scenes in Pink Flamingos that will be tattooed in your brain till the day you die(for better or worse), so be prepared.  This film is labeled a comedy, but that's all a matter of taste.  I know people who DO NOT think this film is funny, but very sick and disturbing.  You gotta understand that it's all meant for laughs, but many aren't gonna agree with that, Bubba.  Female Trouble is a little more toned down than Pink Flamingos, but not much!  The Farrelly Brothers seem to be in the spotlight for grossout humor, but they have a long way to go before they can even begin to outgross the king of grossout.  These two films are the proof of that.",1067731200,5,1307,4.373443983402489
1631675,4,B00005NC4Y,"A guy, a girl , a chicken & a toolshed. Sounds like a deranged version of ""Three's company"". After watching this movie, Jerry Springer will seem like wholesome entertainment. How much you enjoy this may depend on your mood & what you had for supper.
Of course, the guy with the flexible sphincter in the party scene still makes me cringe. I would like to play this movie at a nun convention & see what happens :) Excellent soundtrack !!!",1065052800,4,437,4.475

1631677,3,B00005NC4Y,"The characters in these two movies are all strange and revolting people.  Each scene gets progressively more foul, but never fails to stop surprising you.  For some reason, the ""out-there"", obscene humor will make you let out a few belly laughs.  After watching both of these movies, which is enough to make your genitalia shrivel and your mind ill, I questioned if there was anything actually redeeming in these films.  The answer was no.  But the damage was done: some of these horrors stick in your head for a long while.
Oh yeah-- don't expect to take anything away from these movies-- except some visual images of fat crossdressers shoving T-Bones in their cooches.",1063324800,,670,4.842105263157895

1631680,5,B00005NC4Y,"You have to give it to New Line Cinema for releasing the first of three volumes in the John Waters collection -- and what a release this is!  Two of John Waters' early movies get the star treatment in this glorious edition two dvd set!
Disc one is the filthiest movie of them all -- Pink Flamingos, a notorious film that includes some of the weirdest images ever placed on the screen.  It's the story of Babs Johnson, a three hundred pound transvestite and her freaky family.  The movie is outrageous and may be difficult to take in (I admit, the chicken scene and another famous scene had me looking away), but you have to remember, this isn't really a story, but a groundbreaking film that pushes the limits of censorship.  This disc also includes a trailer and John Waters' amazing commentary.
Disc two has my favorite John Waters movie, Female Trouble.  This is by far the best Waters film.  In it, Divine plays Dawn Davenport, a rebellious teenager who doesn't get the cha cha heels she wants for Christmas.  This event leads to a life of crime and fame.  The second disc also includes another great commentary by Waters.
Overall, this is an excellent DVD.  John Waters proves that his commentary is both entertaining, scholarly, and insightful.  It comes in a beautiful case and for a great price too.  For DVD aficionados and Waters fans, this is a perfect investment!",1050537600,3,1375,4.66390041493776
1631681,5,B00005NC4Y,"i first saw a very grainy pirated copy of this classic in 1984.maybe that fuzzy illegal image added impact.i can honestly swear that this film has been a constant inspiration and support to me for nearly 20 years.i place it up there with ""Blade Runner"" as a film that communicates something very fundamental about our lives and the way we live them.sure-it has Horror,Shock,""oh my god that's disgusting""value,but don't let that blind you to what is REALLY being said here.although it may make many people pewk at the idea,the film's ""Model Family"" represent that true gritty resilience that personifies the deep core of the american psyche.take away the sensationalism and the Trailer Trash chic and you have an old fashioned story of jealousy and revenge with Right coming out on top in the end. Don't agree?-is that because you are offended?are you also offended by the spiralling crime rates and social disintergration facing america today?do you find these Lowlifers too close to reality.a reality that you run and hide from?these people really DO exist.try poking your nose out of the surburban mall and you'll meet them real soon as they rob you downtown.try going down to the racier side of town one night and you'll see that this movie is just a TAME version of what really goes on out there on the after dark streets.happy viewing! -babs",1040342400,2,1346,4.907894736842105
1631682,3,B00005NC4Y,"I liked the mastering of these movies.  I liked John Waters' commentary.  (He even makes a funny reference to Osama bin Laden!)  I did NOT like the unnecessary letterboxing of these full-frame movies (a problem that the Touch of Evil DVD also had).  I know, from reading Waters' autobiography Shock Value, that he'd cropped the tops and bottoms of these two films so the films could run in most theaters.  Still, couldn't AOL Time Warner (!!!) have put both the widescreen and full-screen versions of these trash classics onto each disc in this two-disc set?",1035676800,2,558,4.831578947368421
1631683,5,B00005NC4Y,"Although ""Pink Flamingos"" gets more attention, ""Female Trouble"" is my favorite John Water's movie starring Divine.  ""Dawn Davenport"" has got to me my favorite character ever played by Divine.  The scene where she has a fit over not getting new cha-cha heels for Christmas, priceless!  She goes from spoiled juvenile-delinquent brat, to ""supermodel"", to convicted murderer on death row.  Divine even plays the roll of the father of Dawn's illegitimate daughter, Taffy.  I love Divine's performance.  It's great to finally get this on dvd, along with ""Pink Flamingos"", a John Waters classic!",1032220800,,589,5.3478260869565215
1631684,5,B00005NC4Y,"Not since Laverne and Shirley, Knotts and Conway, and Bush and Cheney have two comedic minds meshed so well. Divine and Waters deliver over and over again in these two twisted camp classics that contain more gut busters than the Farrelly Brothers' complete works.

1631685,5,B00005NC4Y,"To have this double DVD appear on store shelves just made my year! Two of Waters classics (he is a generous fellow) that can be watched over and over again, while one can repeat line after line with the cast and never have to worry about your medication. If you haven't seen these movies, you've messed up badly and need to see them immediately. If you have, you know exactly how important they are to the American culture. Divine, Edie, Chicklet, Consetta, Gator...oh the list of mega-stars goes on!
""Pink Flamingos"" will always be treasured for it's final ""doggy poo"" scene. The behind the scenes truth is, Divine called the local hospital after filming that notorious scene, worried that she may become ill. She blamed it on her 'slightly retarded son who ate dog poo'. It's true, Pig-port and you KNOW it!
With ""Female Trouble"", which was released in digitally remastered sound and cleaned up visually, you can finally, finally hear Mrs. Davenport say to Dawn on Christmas morning, ""Those are your new shoes Dawn!"". You know what happens next. Poor Mrs. Davenport crushed under that tree!  They were the wrong SHOES!!!
Sure, most of the cast is dead, but so what!? These movies live on forever! They are stunning! ""Beauty beauty, look at you! I wish to God I had it too!""

The title up for grabs in this film is the""Filthiest People in the World""....nuff said?The people involved just keep trying to out do each other with hilarious results. And just when you think you`ve seen it all,the ending will blow you away. Incredible!!!

Because they are sooooooo good, I am unable to distinguish between which one is the better film. Both are good from start to finish, they definitely kept my interest and had me laughing to the point of tears coming out of my eyes. A true display of trash-art once again for John Waters. This man is brilliant... he is a genius. It's a shame that Divine is no longer with us, because I would like to see more of his/her movies. He/she is my favorite actor/actress of all time. I recommend these movies for anyone with an open mind and a twisted sense of humor.

I absoluteley loved it. When I showed my friends the film they were shocked, but found it hilarious also. The lines in the movie get me every time, as with all of John Waters' movies. The lines that come out of the actor's mouth crack me up every time.

1631690,5,B00005NC4Y,"""Female Trouble"" is my absolute favorite John Waters film. It isn't merely shocking and disgusting, as much of his legendary ""Pink Flamingoes"" is, but is, in my opinion, a much better film. I believe it is Waters' favorite of his early films, which comes as no surprise. The philosophy and viewpoint of ""Female Trouble"" are outrageous, which is far more subversive than just eating doggie-do. Water's philosophy that crime makes one an instant celebrity (""Everyone looks better under arrest"") is so fully, hilariously realized in this trash epic. Drawing on the sensibility of the old National Enquirer (""I cut out my wife's heart and stomped on it""), and references to crime celebrities such as Alice Crimmins, Richard Speck, and Juan Corona, ""Female Trouble"" chronicles of the life of Dawn Davenport. From teen-age high school brat in 1960, to petty criminal, to ""crime model"" for a chic fascist couple, to mass murderer, to martyr to the cause of celebrity, dying in the electric chair, her ""biggest curtain call"", Waters' superstar, the one and only Divine, gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Dawn Davenport. Dressed in clothes that one wag described as ""making Frederick's of Hollywood look like Sears Roebuck"", spouting hilariously unforgettable dialogue (Q: ""Are you still a thief, Dawn?"" A: ""Yes I am, not as much as I used to be, but I still rob houses""), bouncing up and down on a trampoline, and ""vogueing"" down a Baltimore street, Divine is, simply, a star. What a shame that he is no longer with us. The rest of the cast are full of pep, including the late David Lochary, Mink Stole, Mary Vivian Pierce, Susan Walsh, the late Cookie Mueller, and of course the late Edith Massey, play their roles with such relish, one would think their lives depended on it. And the costumes! The sets! The hairdos! Van Smith, Vince Peranio, and Chris Mason created such eye-popping masterpieces of spectacular bad taste, that they take your breath away. I've often described this film to newcomers as the ""Star Wars"" of bad taste. The picture quality on this DVD is superb-sharp, with brilliant color, and remastered sound, particularly the music. I may also add that the film has been restored to its entirety. There have been numerous VHS releases of this film, with some scenes missing in one print, different scenes in another. ""Pink Flamingoes"", the more well-known of the two films, looks great. One can actually understand what the actors are saying in several scenes, due to the sound remastering, and the picture is crisp, bright, and clean, so one can see all of the notoriously disgusting activities the way they should have been seen! There are outtakes from the film as well, along with John Waters' wry commentary. So, all you trash aficionados can rejoice in the release of this trash double feature on DVD.

1631692,5,B00005NC4Y,"Who in their right mind would ever watch a John Waters movie? (Which begs the question of who would ever make one?) These movies are vile, vulgar, rude ... and that's the entire point! Waters puts the entire concept of ""Right Mind"" on trial.
Daring to go beyond mere social satire, charging beyond the safe limits of irony & subtle overstatement, John Waters aims directly at the viewers socially constructed taboos. Well, he certainly seemed to push most of my buttons with these movies. (And even as I write this review, something inside demands that I point out I didn't pick this DVD out for myself, it was =GIVEN= to me. But an even louder voice claims, nay, it demands, that I announce from the rooftops how eagerly I accepted this DVD and how I raced to watch the movies!)
And that's exactly the point. Waters reminds us that our taboos, our ""buttons"" are conditioned. When he stomps on the teats of our sacred cows we must either turn of the TV or remember that any sense of revulsion or disgust is socially constructed--it is not real in any objective sense. At its root, the experience of these movies reminds us that what is ""nice,"" ""pleasant,"" and ""pretty"" exists only by consensus and not as some higher standard by which all must be judged.
The ""outrageous"" displays, behavior, and story lines give us the opportunity to vicariously live outside the social boundaries, whether the boundaries of mainstream society, or even the boundaries of a counter-culture. We can regress to a time when finger-painting with our own feces was a pleasure, before parental shame taught us to deny, to repress, to leave the unacceptable parts of ourselves buried in shadow.
And how could I get so far without mentioning humor? Surreal, absurdist, satirical, ironic, physical, and it's-better-to-laugh-than-to-cry ... these movies ooze humor, they reek of humor, humor that your mommy would have washed your mouth out with soap, sent you to bed without supper, and spanked your bottom with a hairbrush for. Forbidden humor. Taboo humor.

1631693,4,B00005NC4Y,"Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble are among the best films by director John Waters, and to have them TOGETHER and on DVD is a thrill.  Since I bought the disks, my life has been like a vacation!
There are one or two things, however, which probably need to be said about the DVD.  Because Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble were originated on 16mm. film, the current wide-screen transfer is somewhat of a violation.  Most of the time it isn't really a problem -- especially in Pink Flamingos.  But there are scenes in Female Trouble when the reframing necessary to approximate a wide-screen image has almost eliminated important visual information at the top and bottom of the frame.
In the Christmas Tree scene, for example, one can now only barely glimpse Dawn's slippers as she goes on her elephantesque rampage. The scene is still funny, but not as much so.  There are several other examples, but I leave them for you to discover.  I wish that NewLine had the courage to ""Window Box"" these films, or at least used standard TV screen ratio instead of cropping them into a widescreen ratio they were never meant to have.
I am puzzled, too, by some of the soundtrack from Pink Flamingos. My ancient VHS copy (and all the film copies I have seen) use music cues from ""The Planets"" for those shots where the Marbles spy on Divine's birthday party.  Though the party music itself remains the same on the DVD (and on the previous Laser-Disk), the intercut shots now have a different musical accompanyment.  What happened?
I am very pleased that the end credit sequence in Female Trouble has been _restored_ so to speak (actually, it was re-created rather than truly restored. But it's nice all the same).
Now that I have that out of my system, let me go on to say that I am looking forward to the day when ALL of the works of John's are on DVD.  Wouldn't a disk set of Multiple Maniacs and Mondo Trasho be especially nice?  Maybe they could throw in The Diane Linkletter Story as an extra feature.  Or how about a reissue of Polyester, complete with the Scratch and Sniff cards?  I could personally really go for a disk combining Water's VERY EARLY films - such as Roman Candles, Hag in a Black Leather Jacket and Eat Your Makeup.
Watch with:  Each other, of course!  What else could you possibly need?  But if you wanted to make a marathon of it, why not:  ""Faster Pussycat, Kill Kill"", ""Blood Feast"", ""2,000 Maniacs"", Querelle, or anything starring Jayne Mansfield.",1010620800,16,2462,4.625287356321839
1631694,5,B00005NC4Y,"Welcome to the world of John Waters' trailor park jet set. Dawn and Taffy Davenport, Edie the Egg Lady, Raymond and Connie Marble, Cookie, Crackers, Gator, Babs Johnson, Chiclet and Aunt Ida. Pure and uncensored psycho genius. Out of the two, I prefer Female Trouble as it has an actual plot. Pink Flamingoes is more like a perverse travelogue. These films are like nothing else you have ever seen, well maybe with the exception of Paul Morrisey's Andy Warhol classics. Here are the stories of some very colorful sociopaths who will stop short of nothing in their desire for Fame. The casts of unknowns are excellent and much of the dialogue seems to spring spontaneously from their eccentric minds. After 25 years, the costumes and make-up still look outrageous and fresh.
Towering above everyone, literally, is DIVINE. Never before and never again will a drag queen destroy all your preconceptions about the 60's, Elizabeth Taylor, mother/daughter/son relationships and the seduction of fame. These films will never be shown on the Sundance or Independant Film Chanels as they are too strange and lewd. I guess that is their power. John Waters only hit the offensive mark again with Desperate Living, his tribute to the Wizard of Oz, fugitive lesbians and thrift store dressing. His later films became sweet sendups of B-movies and with their inclusion of real celebrities/actors they lost much of their bite.",1010448000,,1411,5.060085836909871
1631695,5,B00005NC4Y,"If you want the Best in Trash films, look no further. Pink Flamingo's is as ""good"" as it gets. Pink Flamingo's is the type of film that is more fun to watch with an audience not familiar with the film or any of John Waters earlier works. The birthday party scene with the singing A-hole (to the tune of Paw-Paw-Oo-Mow-Mow) and the last minute of the movie (the dog doo-doo snack) are worth the price of the DVD. If you want to be shocked or you want to shock those hard to shock friends, then this is the film for you. Read the other reviews, they tell it all like it is. Thanks John Waters.",1006128000,,591,4.147826086956521
1631696,4,B00005NC4Y,"Pink Flamingos is what it is: extreme, absurd, hysterically funny, amateurish. But it's a must-own if you want to folllow the course Waters took to get where he is (And pick up a copy of his book, Shock Value, while you're at it, to complete the picture. It's a hoot).
The long-awaited Female Trouble is the one that has it all: Waters payiing more attention to a plot, Divine honing her acting skills with great success, and a real sense of joy that comes from this bunch of oddballs having a great time making a movie. Viewers unfamiliar with Waters always take his films so seriously, and doing so could cause distress. But it's hard not to notice that it's all in great fun--gross at times. just plain silly at others.
The best scene in the fillm: Dawn, Chicklet and Concetta in the bathroom right after Dawn is caught eating in class. Every line uttered is so funny, you'll find yourself using them in your own daily life: ""I never get enough Christmas presents--everyone's so damn cheap"";  ""I'm gonna get alot, and I'm gonna take 'em all back and get the money. You can do that, you know""; ""I hate this school and all these ignorant teachers who don't know one thing. I'm the one who should be teachin'."" It's laugh after laugh, time after time, with Female Trouble.",1005609600,2,1272,4.554585152838428
1631697,5,B00005NC4Y,"The seedy allure of these two fine films is almost too much for a single package.  The multifold disc jacket and clear holders are a spiffy touch, though one might prefer a vibrant fun fur lining. The films are both presented in their entirety, and the picture quality is a considerable improvement over the last few VHS releases.  The vibrant colors in the costuming and the sets spring out with lurid intensity; that alone makes it worth the price of admission.  Throw in some outtakes and rare goodies and you've got yourself a sale.
Descriptions of both ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Female Trouble"" generally don't do the material justice.  Any John Waters film is an experience, rather than a conventional story with an unconventional cast.  Call it slumming if you will, but enjoying these two films is hardly an acquired taste.  The things I find most enjoyable in both these DVDs are the dialogue, the plot twists, and the manic over-acting.  What a shame that so many of the Waters' troupe have passed on in last twenty + years; these films represent the best work of the original acting ensemble in my opinion.
Divine is of course the star of both films, and though some fans might think it sacriligeous, I much prefer her in ""Female Trouble.""  The latter isn't as gross-out-zany as ""Pink Flamingos,"" and its' story gives Divine a bit more room to flex her acting chops.  Edith Massey is a consistent highlight in both films, going from harmless, innocent Egg Lady to an acid-throwing harridan in pleather.  Mink Stole nabs two plum roles as well, not to mention some really nasty outfits.  The rest of the cast is unfailingly energetic, or manic, and their enthusiasm is infectious.
As '70s underground cinema goes, John Waters' films are essential viewing.  Thankfully, the appeal of his work has grown significantly with time, and that's what saved these films from bad (or non-) distribution.  Fans of Waters and Divine will snap these great 2fers up, but if you're not really acquainted with this material you have a few choices.  If you want to endure the hardcore Waters experience, this set is the one you want.  Turd eating,(. . . ) acid-throwing, hand-chopping...these films have it all.  And since none of them are more than passing images, it's safe to say you can try closing your eyes if such things bother you.  If you'd rather try something a little lighter, the ""Serial Mom / Pecker"" 2fer is your best squeaky clean bet.  If you've bought this set and want some more trash-festing, the ""Desperate Living / Polyester"" combo will more than fill you up.

1631699,5,B00005NC4Y,"It is so great to finally have these two films on DVD, and even better to have them both in one package.  Pink Flamingos is always fun to revisit, particularly with all the extras that were included in the 25th Anniversary edition, but the gem here is Female Trouble.  This is Water's crowning achievement.  He and his Dreamland crew were never sicker and never funnier.  Buy these discs and you will ask yourself the same question that has puzzled me for years: where is Water's lifetime achievement Oscar?",1003276800,,507,4.7272727272727275

Horrifyingly funny, deliciously deviant, appallingly brilliant. You gotta see them to believe them. Humor of the darkest shade.
Some of us have been waiting for YEARS to own them. Getting both in one package, especially with Waters' commentary, is just like Christmas with cha-cha heels!",1002067200,,446,5.123287671232877
1631701,5,B00005NC4Y,"...Granted, I always forward through the chicken scene in Pink Flamingos, it's waayyy disturbing. But Female Trouble is a brilliant movie, full of laughs, highly irreverant and Divine is in HER (not its, as a previous unenlightened reviewer labeled her) element. The additional scenes are great, I don't understand why they were cut out of previous VHS versions.  This is a movie to pop in every Christmas.
Pink Flamingos is a ground breaker as well (probably a wind-breaker too, but that's another scene entirely). Very funny in many parts, and the soundtrack is great, unfortunately the music on the scene where Divine driving with her son Crackers has been changed - real fans notice this stuff - it just complemented the scene so perfectly before.  Don't let that keep you from viewing trash at it's finest!

1631702,5,B00005NC4Y,"""Female Trouble"" is, by far, John Waters' best film. Ironically, it is also the most sadly neglected of all of his films. Long unavailable for several years, I am ecstatic to see it remastered and rereleased on DVD (with ""Pink Flamingos"" added in).
There's a reason why the majority of reviews of this release focus on ""Trouble"" instead of the more well-known ""Flamingos"": ""Trouble"" outclasses ""Flamingos"" in almost every respect. While ""Flamingos"" may be more visually shocking, ""Trouble"" is much funnier ... and meaner.
While Waters' skills as a director have improved immeasurably since 1974, ""Trouble"" is his best script. In conclusion, ""Flamingos"" is an occasionally funny freakshow, while ""Trouble"" is a masterpiece and should be ranked with ""Duck Soup"" and ""M*A*S*H"" as one of the best film comedies ever made.",1001203200,9,817,5.244274809160306
1631703,4,B00005NC4Y,"PINK FLAMINGOS is the film that made John Waters a household name as a director in the world of low-budget cinema! The story is about people who compete for the title of ""Filthiest Person Alive."" We have people making love to chickens, we have people licking furniture to perform voodoo rituals, we have pregnant women being kept in pits, we have people eating dog waste, and we have much, much more! The story of this film is really just an excuse to show people doing disgusting and perverted things that nobody in there right mind would ever think of doing...and I mean that as a compliment. If this film doesn't shock you the first time you see it, then nothing else will.
FEMALE TROUBLE is a classic John Waters film that tells the story of a woman named Dawn Davenport.
